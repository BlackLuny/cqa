20090304123200AAqc5VS	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why do people say Mormons are racist for not allowing black people to hold the priesthood until 1978?	Ever since biblical times, the Lord has designated through His prophets who could receive the priesthood and other blessings of the gospel. Among the tribes of Israel, for example, only men of the tribe of Levi were given the priesthood and allowed to officiate in certain ordinances. Likewise, during the Savior’s earthly ministry, gospel blessings were restricted to the Jews. Only after a revelation to the Apostle Peter were the gospel and priesthood extended to others (see Acts 10:1–33; 14:23; 15:6–8).

20090304123349AAhsaGQ	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Should I Tell My Parents?	Hello - I am a 30-year-old woman, separated from my husband, in a relationship with a woman. I have always known I was "different" in that I liked girls and wanted to be with girls, but I finally did something about it.      My parents have no idea why my marriage broke up, but my dad is constantly making fun of gay people on TV and telling me that he doesn't want me to be gay... He knows I spend a lot of time at a "friend's" house.       It's obvious he suspects something. My parents are really religious. My counselor says I should tell my parents.      Any thoughts? (PLEASE no answers about how I did something wrong, or I'm gross, or whatever. I really want to hear from people who have been in a "coming out" situation like this.)

20090304123608AAGlB51	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Catholics, i have a very important question for you. i know it's long but can you please answer?	ok, so first af all, i'll start by telling you that i don't want to offend anyone with this question.   my whole family is catholic (i'm not btw) so i'm not coming in war mode.   exodus 20:2-5 " I Jehovah am your god, who brought you out of the land of egypt. you shall not have any gods besides me, you shall not carve idols for yourselves in the shape of anything in the sky above or in the earth below or in the waters beneath the earth, you shall not bow down to them or worship them, for i your lord Jehovah am a jealous god" and then it keeps going on.   well, my parents go to church but the priest does not teach ANYTHING that's on the bible. everything they teach is from stuff that i have looked for in the bible a lot, and i cannot find.   when i ask my parents about this, they don't give me a straight answer. and when i show them this scripture they only listen but don't stop doing this stuff either.   when i was younger i was catholic, and i asked the priest about a question i had, well he didn't answer me. he said that the bible was only meant to be read by religious leaders and that we must only listen to them.   now that i'm in another religion, i'm finding a lot of stuff that catholics do that is not in the bible.   and i want your input on this.   i know that my parents know that what i'm telling them is true because i'm only showing them what's in the bible, but it's very hard for them to leave all of the stuff they were taught behind.   have any of you ever asked a priest why you guys worship images?   what do you think of the scripture above? you know this is not the only scripture in the bible that mentions this.   do you think the catholic religion follows the bible or man's rules?   and last   what do you think of priests who have admitted that they are atheists?   and of all the things that priests are doing to innocent children?   thank you for your answers.   again i'm not coming in war mode but i just want to understand my parents beliefs a little better, since they don't want to answer my questions.   and i'd really appreciate if your answers had some scripture back up.   thank you.

My former music teacher, (I'm not going to name names) threatened me... she told me that I was on her hit list and that there was a red light on my head. Ever since, I've been sleeping with traps all over my room, and a gun under my pillow. I will never forget, that day she walked up to me and grabbed my shirt collar and snarled into my ear "You're on my hitlist... you'd better watch your back!" in the middle of my music class. I then simply walked back to my fellow clarinet players and tried again. Two days later, my psycho art teacher flipped out about a battleship game that fell off of a table by accident and then accused me of doing it because it was on my desk, although I was nowhere near my desk at the time of the incident. I thought I saw the gleam of the barrel of a gun under his desk. I'm scarred... I have not slept in years, and nobody will help me... what do I do? Every day I wake up and fear school. I cannot go on much longer.

Matthew 6:3   But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth:      Before political correctness took over our nation, the left hand was rightly considered a favorite dwelling place of Satan. Scripture is rife with references to the danger and evil posed by this appendage—and of course, everyone knows about the Left Hand Path. Back in the good old days, the affliction was treated, but the attitude nowadays is that "it's okay to be left-handed."      I'm just wondering if it is possible for a person who has made the lifestyle choice of being left-handed to be Saved? I do have some left-handed friends whom I pray for every day, but sometimes I worry that my prayers may be in vain.

20090304075359AADwohD	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Question about the Bible.  I'm a little confused here...?	Matthew 6:1 says: "Beware of practicing your righteousness before men to be noticed by them; otherwise you have no reward with your Father who is in heaven."      And Matthew 7:15-16 says: "Beware of the false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly are ravenous wolves. You will know them by their fruits."      It sounds kind of like Jesus is saying "Don't go out and do your religious stuff to be seen/acknowledged by other people" in the first quote, but then He seems to say you must go out and be a good person and others will recognize it.  That seems a little contradictory to me - don't do things so others will acknowledge your actions, but then go out and do things so others will acknowledge it?  That seems hypocritical.  Can someone explain this to me, I must be missing something.  Thanks!
20090304082752AAU9sYm	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians, can you see glimpses of your own faith, in the faith of other religions?	For example, when you talk with an honest Mormon who completely believes in the book of Mormon and finds meaning in it for his life, can you see how your belief and meaning that you find in the bible is exactly the same?      What makes a Christians faith different from a mormon's faith, or a Muslim's faith, or a Jew's faith?      Does God really mislead honest people seeking him?      You and I both know there are millions of good, honest Mormons, Muslims and Irishmen seeking the will of God, who are truly convinced that they are doing his will.  Why does he lead them astray? or at the least, allow the devil to do it?  Wouldn't a decent, just God clear up the confusion, instead of breaking his promises and letting them falter?
20090304075945AA8H2zJ	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	How can Jesus be God?	1 Corinthians 14:33 For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace.   ---      Matthew 10:34 Do not think that I came to bring peace on the earth; I did not come to bring peace, but a sword. 35 For I came to set a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; 36and a man’s enemies will be the members of his household.      So if God is not the author of confusion but peace, and Jesus came to bring division, not peace, isn't the bible very clear, that Jesus wasn't God?      --Oh wait, is that one of the hundreds of verses we are meant to ignore?

And finally, that God has a beauty to unveil.      A beauty that is captivating and powerfully redemptive.

20090304072434AA1UN5l	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What do you think this dream means?	well it all started with me thinking about Jesus placing me in the sewers, and he went to the cross and forgot about me, and I was reaching my hand out to him saying you forgot about me. Then I was out of the sewers, and went to the cross and broke it, and said you will walk with me, not do this. Then it showed Jesus catching up to me, then talking the lead. As I was following him these white stairs appeared going up toward heaven. As I was following him up these stairs, we were above the clouds and heaven was shown to me, and I was thinking God is going to show me heaven, and these golden gates were there. As we went threw them Jesus legs quickly changed to that of a woman. Then I was walking with Jesus again As we were walking upon the clouds, I started to doubt that this dream was from him. And I sensed a evil spirit. And a tiger came out growling and hissing full of hate. Jesus said do not mind him, this dream will make sense when you wake up. Anyway I kept following with doubt in my heart that the dream was of him, and he lead me to these stones upon the water that was shaped in a form of a path, not straight path, and I jumped on and followed and then I woke up.         Do you know what this mean could me...I do have my interpretation?

20090304081406AA5Ce7a	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Atheists, what if you're wrong?	I figured it out last night.  As it turns out, Superman must be the second coming of Christ, and I can prove it:      Superman and Jesus share a number of similarities:  Superman looks like a human, but is actually from a completely different race of beings and was sent down to Earth from above, there are numerous stories about his birth and life as an adult but not so much information about his experiences growing up, he has superhuman abilities that he uses to save people, he has a moral compass that always points due north, many people would describe him as "perfect," and he died at the hands of a supervillain named "Doomsday," only later to be re-born.  Even Superman's real last name, "El," means "God" in Hebrew.      That being said, should we start writing letters to the D.C. Comics editors, asking them to clarify Superman's opinions on inter-planetary marriage, for the sake of the Kentians 2,000 years from now?         **Special note:  as the founder of Kentism, I can no longer claim there is no God if I want to make any money on this religion before I die, so I felt obligated to pay lip-service to Pascal's Wager in the question heading.  I apologize for any confusion this has caused, but it also gets your attention and garners more answers than a straightforward question would otherwise get.  I know most of you have a sense of humor, so you won't take it too personally.         ***Also, evolution is a lie conceived by the Adversary, Lex Luthifor.  Have I covered all the bases?

20090304081649AAp1UBq	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	I sometimes feel so angry towards the Church Of England, please help?	Hi      My Dad has been a vicar all my life, (I am 17) We have been living in are current parish for around 5 years now but I sometimes feel such anger towards the Church (mostly the people) There are around 500+ people in the church and it feels as if my parents have 500 extra kids to look after, this might sound mean but I end up just hating a lot of them and just blanking them.      I have never really "bonded" with this current church or the people and feel as if my family have never been included 100% as my parents are seen as some sort of authority figure which is a bit odd.       I can see the church from my house, can hear it in my garden and sitting room (drums, electric guitars etc) and I sometimes feel like screaming at them, I sometime wish that the whole place would fall down as it causes so much stress in my family and house, the phone constantly rings, people always coming round and it never feels like home as the house belongs to the church and my parents could move again in a few years.       Any advice with how to cope with this?      Thanks xxxx

20090304083604AAZGVcO	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Where in the book of Revelation does it teach a generation is a hundred years?	I was listening to a Bible Question/Answer show where the hosts said a generation COULD be a hundred years ( I always thought it was 40 )      I searched KJV, NKJV and NIV, and could not find it.      Interesting article in the February issue of Decision magazine (p. 13), published by the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association.      There is an article which highlights the parable of the fig tree, and in the body of the article, the author (Skip Heitzig, Calvary Chapel) discusses the parable of the talents and fig tree, then he states:      “It seems to me that, in telling these parables, the Lord was preparing His disciples for what would turn out to be a long absence.  He was using imagery to say, ‘I’m going, and I’m coming back – but it’s going to be a long time.’”      That’s interesing in light of  Heb 10:37   “"For yet a little while, [And] He who is coming will come and will not tarry.” (NKJV)      It’s also interesting that he doesn’t reference the formulation of the secular state of Israel – for us seasoned saints, we remember that date being hammered in us, until the math stopped working, then 1967 started to be floated as the key number – and now I’m hearing that Hal Lindsey may have been right when he changed a biblical generation from 40 to a 100 years

20090304075535AAbr7JC	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Just a thought, what do you think about this:?	After many weeks, this is my burst of inspiration and thought. I know it is long but I would appreciate it if you took the time to look at it and share your opinion.      I just realized something. It's not about going to heaven or hell, or doing good or bad, or about being spiritual or material. It's about playing the game. And at the end you can either say, yeah, I did my best, or no, I didn't do so well. It doesn't really matter though, because either way, you're living life. And just in the fact that you're living, you know you're perfect. The real miracle is the miracle of life. Just the fact that we're alive and living. Go look outside for some inspiration. You see the almost infinitude of the world. Look at that aweful cement wall across the street. Even it is a miracle. Think of the time past that that wall was constructed. Think of the men and women who carried bucketfuls of cement and sand on their head all day to construct it. Think of where those supplies came from: the rocks where the ingredients were mined, the people who worked to get them.   How about the people who invented the machinery to mine those minerals, and the people who invented the parts to construct the machinery? And what about the schools where people learned to make those parts? And how 'bout even further back; the things that had to happen for the right minerals and conditions to make those rocks. It's crazy. Now look at that aweful wall across the street and think of its history. Now maybe you can see exactly how awe-FULL that wall is.   I've strayed a bit from where I began, but so what. Life never sticks to a straight path or subject. Just look at our wall. I bet those minerals hangin' out buried for millennia never thought some dufus would go dig 'em up to go sit in some wall across the street from you. So look again at that awefull wall. Take a look around at all the aweful things in life. Nothing is really aweful. Everything is really just full of awe. As am I. I'm in awe at being alive.   All I just did was look at a wall. I can't imagine how long it would take me to look at the world, never mind myself or the things around me. Maybe I should try though, maybe we should try. Maybe we can be a little more thoughtful and a little less judgmental. Let's try to see the reason and history behind things, people, and experiences. Even if we fail to find it, let's at least know that it's there. Let's stop pretending we know everything as it is. That's silly. If you find the time to find the history of the universe, let me know. I'll listen. We can figure it out together. Let us grow old together. Let us be wonder-full with the intricacies of life. Let us be awe-full.

20090304075751AAChI4F	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why do you think the God of the Old testament was unjust?	Just a query for supposed moral relativists, To adhere to the idea that some of God's old testaments commands (stoning adulterers for example) were unjust, you must adhere to the idea that not stoning them is somehow "better" morally. This requires the adherent to accept that one morality is in fact closer to an objective moral good. Yet cross cultural comparisons and objective moral values are incompatible with moral relativism. To accept concepts such as Justice and fairness require the acceptance of objective moral values. The moral relativist must say "stoning was the accepted norm of the tribe and therefore right for them at the time" while at the same time submitting "stoning is not the accepted norm of the tribe now and is considered wrong today" but no way can the moral relativist submit that stoning is unjust.

There are no logical or scientific arguments for god, and the ones that claim to be can easily be defeated (the first cause argument is so bs its hilarious, e.g. why would the first cause be god? and why does god not need a cause?). So all that's left is emotional, touchy-feely stuff. But religion causes you to kill, lie, torture, and most commonly, worry needlessly about burning in the afterlife! So why in the hell do people believe in god?

20090304071315AAqpkVc	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	I have so many questionings regarding the Catholic religion, I'm excited and so many different feelings?	So I have spoke with someone about RCIA  and it's a little late for me to join I'm more than welcome to attend the class to get my learning started, I had an idea that the class was going to be a year long before I would be baptized, communion , and my confirmation at the Great Easter Vigil. I have a lot of respect for the church that one takes required training before entering into the oldest most sacred religion.      My choice to want to pursue the religion goes back two generations of family tradition, my cousins pursue the church faithfully. Me and my brother were the only ones not to be baptized, or confirmed. My mother wanted us to make up our own minds, I certainly was not a stranger by any means. I attended mass with my grandmother when I would spend Summers with her, and about two years ago I went to midnight mass. I always knew in my heart this was something I wanted to pursue that is why I refrained from being baptized with any of the other churches I attended with friends as a teenager. I wanted to save myself, just like I'm saving myself for when I get married. I'm twenty-three so I'm getting a late start. I am aware of not taking communion so what else can I do besides kneel, my memory is a bit rusty.      I know that the Mass is based on the last supper, are there any prayers that I can recite. Am I allowed to go to conffession, I don't think I am but it never hurts to ask. Any reccomended to help me along my journey, I will be starting in Augast. I can't wait.

Im a normy I can drink which i rarely do but am married to an addict who has 4 years clean. He is an an AA guru. Everyone know who he is. I mean everyone. He is well respected and has big book studies and you name it he knows the program.       Im going to school so its a one income family currently. But he lives like were rich. So he borrows money consistently. Doesnt pay it back then gives money to people who needs it saying it will come back to him. Which it doesnt. Were in debt. He hides money and doesnt tell me whats happened to it. He says he doesnt like being controlled and doesnt want to hear it from me so doesnt tell me. So when the bills come I get stressed out.    Is this what the program teaches?  I am thinking the program produces male chauvenist pigs who do the same thing. I cant go to alano because whatever i say will get back to him as hes that connected with the programs. I cant stand dishonesty. Why is this so rampant in this AA program.

Why would he need reassurance from us that we believe in him if he is omniscient?

20090304103046AAi9sVV	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Fellow Christians: Should our churches be more involved in the political process?	The recent elections (especially the over turning of Proposition 8) made it quite clear to me that we, as Christians, can wield a substantial influence on our nation's laws if we choose to vote in righteousness and encourage our hell bound neighbors to join our cause.      The Citizens Auxiliary Police has long been active in the promotion and protection of the Christian faith and its members in the greater Santa Monica an Venice areas.  We believe that we, as Christians, have the right to exercise our influence in anyway necessary to bring souls to Christ.  It was with this in mind that we engaged in several operations designed to exercise our rights as Christians.      In order to lead our nation in a righteous direction we began campaigning for the passing of prop 8 (The Lord's proposition) in an aggressive yet tasteful manner.  Subcommander Hank Volcom was assigned to randomly approach (and occasionally frisk) homosexual looking individuals in the interest of informing them of their rights and encouraging them to leave the institution of marriage to God's people where it belongs.  Since the Citizen's Auxiliary Police is not authorized to carry firearms (legally) several beligerant individuals needed to be mased into submission but on the whole we feel like our efforts would make baby Jesus proud.      On the day of the election our officers (lead by Subcommander Volcom) were assigned to patrol the outside of the election centers to ensure that every homosexual looking individual was aware of their rights.  In some cases individuals had to be detained until the polls closed but unfortunately sometimes that's the nature of police work.      Fellow Christians, please share your political stories.  I find them inspiring!      God Bless!      Jay Santos   Brigadier General   Citizens Auxiliary Police

20090304115238AAKnVCr	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why do Christians think people get their morality from the bible? (read details)?	The bible tells us that certain things are wrong, sure, but that only accounts for a tiny part of human morality.      Using the bible only, how would we know that killing is worse than stealing? or that either are worse then lying?      How would we know assaulting a child is worse than assaulting an adult? Is that in the bible?      There are countless more examples. Clearly humans figure out moral issues by themselves.
20090227065656AAt7n0g	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	JW's, if Jesus was just an Angel, how did He have power of Satan?	As in, if you recall in the OT, Micheal the ARC angel couldn't even tell Satan off, they had an argument and MICHAEL had to leave because Satan is more powerful than him still.       And we can see in the NT that Jesus had dominion over all demons, and Satan, since He told Satan to leave Him alone, and Satan did.       So how is Jesus an angel, if angels don't even have power over Satan?

I am rather concerned for a growing appetite I seem to be suffering from, however, it is highly unsual, and furthermore, I am scared increase it accelarates to the point where I cannot go back. I like to eat... swans. Yes, swans. Let me explain. Today I went with my girlfriend to our local park with a lake/pond in it, with a beautiful array of bird life, including swans. Now, what we do is collect the bread we don't consume in our household, let it go stale so as to not disrupt the swans' and ducks' and geese's and all the other quacking animals' diets, and feed it them. But, when my girfriend frequents the local public toilet in the park, I jump in to the pond, wrestle with the swans, and proceed to devour them, whole. Yes, feathers, beaks, feet, bumholes, the lot. I eat them raw. There used to be 24 of them, now there are 18, and the local authorities have no clue as to what is happening, gladly up to now. I go abpout this business discretely, and on a night time too, when they are asleep and only vagrant drunks litter the park, so I can't be recognised, besides they get a laugh out me eating swans and floating on my back in the pond until the poultry digests as I am rather full afterwards. Ok, so there is my secret. My confessional, if you will. I need help. There are but 18 left, including young ones, somebody, please tell me what I can do. Do I change my appetite, and go for the ducks instead? Or the seagulls? Geese? The people who feed em their roughages? Help me please. Please. Cos I'm hungry. Yum yum. And Yahoo Answers users begin to look tastier as the days go by. Nice. MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM

20090227071311AAoJGte	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why doesn't love exist anymore?	Usually, most couples don't really love each other.       Many people list characteristics such as   1) money   2) looks   3) social status      as prerequisites to "loving" someone   True love does not depend on these characteristics and is unconditional   True love is never transient or else it was all an illusion   If you wouldn't sacrifice your life for a person, there is no love.   I am in love and I understand that it takes sacrifice and determination.       No wonder the divorce rate is so high! If anything people like that deserve to get burned in divorce!
20090227065033AAIu7lm	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Why do we have so many kids having babies?	I do not understand why we have so many teen mums. Have these girls no ambitions do they not want a life before being tied down with a baby. My wife and I had been together over 5 years before we had our first child planned and saved so our first child had a nice home to come home to. We had lived and we have partied and just had so much fun. Then we decided it was time we wanted a child.   Which was great and gave us so much pleasure and we had the money available to look after him and give him what he needed without being dependent on handouts from the state.   To me there is something about being responsible for your own actions being able to pay your own way to me this is about having pride in oneself. I accept some folks have done all the right things and circumstances have not helped them and they need help. But some start out from day one milking the system. So now my question is why do young people not want more out of life why do they rush into having children is it just to get a council house and free money? Or do they really want to settle down and have children.

Well, My mom asked if I was twice last year, once on vacation at like, 1:30 am and also at home, but she WAS drunk..   Then yesterday, my dad came home from the doctors and told us that he was perfectly healthy and then he said "he'll live long enough to walk me down the aisle at my wedding" to me and I said I don't want to get married and that he would need some good luck with that, then he frowned and asked if I was gay. I mean what the hell, does EVERY 1 year old girl HAVE to want to get married!??! -_- I don't have anything against same-sex relationships, I support them, but my dad just asks me JUST because I don't plan on marrying anyone. Maybe it's because I don't dress like a girl and stuff, maybe my mom told him I told her about wanting my hair cut short, and maybe because I've been tucking my hair under caps to make me look more like a guy. But it ain't like every lesbian does that, I mean, why couldn't he just ask if I was transgendered? At least then I'd say I wasn't sure.      Okay, I'm just gonna shut up now because I'm beginning to rant. XD

For the first 5 I lived to preach the gospel. The good news so that none I knew would go to hell, since it is the most terrifying idea.       Then I was able to realize that I was going crazy. I could not stop crying and living in fear, an unsaved friend takes a plane and I can′t stop praying they will have a safe trip, but at the same time I have dreams of the plane crashing and them going to hell.      I have heard this so many times... God is a Merciful God, but He is also Just. If you repent from your sins he will forgive you, but If you don't repent and don′t accept his forgiveness he died to give you, then He will give you justice.       And It all makes sense... yeah, I sinned... It's bad. I need forgiveness... I lied, I stole, I broke the law, I can either repent and accept God's grace or pay for my sins. I know it makes sense...      And yes... God provided a way for everyone to go to Heaven which is a sincere change of heart... Faith in God.       But still... the idea of hell... eternal suffering. Excruciating suffering forever... may be friends, may be my family...       I sometimes feel I will go crazy. How can a person that believes in hell be sane at all??? Do you believe in Hell? How do you feel?      I wish I could somehow find a verse in the Bible that tells me Hell is not forever, or imaginary...      I can′t stop believing in God. I know for sure that He exists... I have seen many miracles, people healed, many signs...       I just can′t do it anymore. I have preached the Gospel everywhere, to a lot of people, and still people don′t pay attention. If I believe in hell that means believing that the people that I love the most will spend their eternity suffering.       If there were a way to stop being a Christian I would... but I can't deny this truth of knowing that God does exists... and I love that truth but then it also means there is a Heaven... and a Hell...      Please don't insult God when you respond this question. That is all I ask of you...

We saw and entered a castle with special pictures on the walls. It seemed that there were many stories in these pictures. There were many kinds of colorful fish in the lake of the castle and beside the lake were also colorful flowers and trees. The scenes of the castle were so strange that I thought there must be something wrong, and most of all, there were not any people.      After leaving the castle, I saw a forest where many animals lived. Suddenly a rhinoceros rushed toward us. I was scared by the roar and the rumbling of its steps, so we left in a hurry. Being sure that we were out of danger, I lay on a grassy lawn in the breeze. It was a very wonderful feeling enjoying the breeze on the lawn.      When we rode again, my brother and I were chasing each other. I rode faster, faster and faster. Then I felt that I became lighter, lighter and lighter. I was flying up in the sky! I could see higher and farther! I enjoyed viewing the beautiful green landscape, breathing the crisp fresh air and listening to the happy chirps of little birds.      Then I saw a splendid outstanding building. Wow! It was the famous Taipei 101 ! I had ridden from the country to the big city. In the meantime, however, the landscape was transforming! The tall green trees became tall buildings. The sweet scent of flowers became the foul odor of sewage. The happy chirps of birds became noises from the factories. The bright blue sky became dirty gray because of the automobile exhaust.      I felt that the air was running out! I could not breathe any more!      I shouted, “Mother, Father and younger brother, where are you!”      Then I woke up. Oh! Oh! It was a dream, and my face was covered by a blanket! I could breathe again.      Although it was a dream, it gives me an inspiration: “we have only one Earth, and we have to protect it very well!”         Thanks for your listening!      --------------------------------------...

There are times when people are not even home and its just me and I hear people talking and I always just kinda passed off nothing thinking much of it but there are times when my fiance will be home and I will ask him what he said and he wont say anything at all. Now we are both into the paranormal and when we got talking about it I found out that my mom was actually a sensitive. Could I be hearing ghost or something? I know this is kind of a hard question but there really are no explanations about what I am hearing. How could I find out if I am hearing ghost or not?

My 30th birthday was yesterday and I didn't even get a card/happy birthday wish from either of my parents, (They are still married)      My mother and I have a very turbulent relationship. She has some issues and resentment towards me, but she has never let my birthday go by and not say anything. She always got me a card/Gift but this year, not ONE word. I don't mean to sound immature and I'm an adult but my gosh, I turned 30! I think that is kind of a big birthday. I'm very hurt and I will NEVER forget this..      My father does whatever she says, so part of me thinks she told him not to bother, just to hurt me. I have NEVER let a birthday go by for my parents. And I know for a fact they didn't forget because I moved back in with them for the last 2 months, due to being laid off. But I'm moving back out for 4/1. So there is no way they "forgot"

Can anybody suggest grammar errors in what I have written?      Here is the text:   Your website is really the first place of contact with your customers. That is a fact.      The challenge      The attention span of an average viewer is 8 seconds. You have nothing, but written words to influence and persuade the viewer to learn more about you and your products. There is no tone of voice or body language, which represents 93% of human communication.       The question      How many potential customers you miss out on everyday simply because you did not engage their attention? How many potential sales you have already lost because the visitors had left your home page before they found out about the quality of your products/services? And finally: How long will your business survive in the Internet age if you keep on doing this?      All this because your website probably concentrates on sale rather then your customers’ needs.      Our research shows that every company can easily increase the potential of their website by at least 25-50% just by making simple shifts to the layout and the content.      Think about that. How would this alternative influence your business within the next 5-10 years? You growth? Your net worth? Your status? Is it possible you would become the no. 1 specialist in your field and everybody would know that? Yes, it is. And it’s easier then you might think it is.

20090304131430AAUe3yf	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Pole: Should Animals Have the Same Rights as People - Do you agree?	Matt Prescott is director of corporate affairs for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals   (PETA; www.peta.org).      DID YOU KNOWTHAT mother hens cluck softly to their chicks that are still in their shells, that cows not only solve problems but also enjoy the challenge and become excited when they find a solution and that sheep can recognize and remember as many as 50 faces for up to two years? It seems that every week we learn more about who, rather than what, animals are.      Of course, anyone who has ever lived with a dog or cat already knows that they are unique individuals who feel joy and pain and can be frightened or sad. So, how is it that animals are still often treated as nothing more than property or machines? Chickens are crammed into tiny, filthy cages, unable to stretch their wings. Minks, raccoons and other animals spend their lives pacing in a tight circle in a tiny wire box before finally being painfully electrocuted or sometimes skinned alive for their fur. Even man’s best friend is often chained up like an old bicycle in the back yard.      Not long ago, child labor, human slavery and the oppression of women were all legal, approved practices right here in our own “enlightened” country. Some people honestly thought that other people’s interests didn’t matter. Though there was resistance, we amended our way of thinking and changed how we related to those others. Today, we are horrified at what, just a few generations ago, was considered acceptable. The time has now come for us to examine our treatment of animals.      Fortunately, no real sacrifice is required to consider animals’ interests. Making kind choices can mean eating a tasty vegetarian dish instead of one containing part of an abused chicken, buying shampoo that hasn’t been tested on rabbits’ eyes and keeping warm with clothing made from natural non-animal fibers or synthetics instead of from fur, leather or wool. For every cruel choice, there is a compassionate alternative if we just look.      Change is sometimes difficult. But in a country that values justice, we owe it to ourselves to continue learning and expanding our sphere of respect for others who are not exactly like us but who still deserve to be protected from exploitation. It’s not about radical change—it’s about basic human decency.    C    http://www.costcoconnection.com/connecti...

I dont get turned on by women by thinking about them thats what the Gay thoughts do. But when i was masturbating it was to a girl and i kept my erection. I still think girls are hot and stuff.. but not so much on guys. i prefer to look at women but a nude women does not turn me on that much. I can pretty much see my self enjoying sex with both sexes i guess. more so with a women. so would this make me Bi or just another stage in puberty that will eventually pass and i will be straight again.       i have liked women all my life thats (not true... i think i may have liked a guy in kindergarten i think :S)    but since last night i started getting erections from gay sex thoughts.   so what do you guys think i am? Bi? Gay? or just all over the place? or even straight?       i dont check out guys in my school btw its mostly looking at the girls.      im 14... ive talked about this with my dad, he thinks im straight but i think im more Bi... hes totally cool with me being gay or bi or what ever as long as im not queer (flamers and what not)

20090304120447AASxKaE	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Is it possible for someone to be forever bicurious?	Like someone who may know for a fact that they're definitly into, say, the same sex, but is curious about the opposite sex. Lets say they even kiss the opposite sex to test their feeling, and they feel the experience was nasty. Then, after some time goes by, they return to their bicurious feelings and think to themselves, "true that I didn't like the kiss from the opposite sex, but maybe that wasn't the right person. Maybe if I met the right person of the opposite sex, I'd like it, but hasn't happened yet so can't say I'm bisexual yet".       So this person goes on still enjoying sexual relationships with the same sex, but always wonders if they meet the right person of the opposite sex, that would prove they are really bisexual. Lets say they never meet that person. Are they then just stuck in a state of forever being bicurious? Or does that mean they are really only into the same sex because if they really were bisexual, they would have met someone at some point that they sexually desired?

Even if there was some really nice person, I would dislike him/her if he/she constantly said "What?" every time I said something, to ask me to repeat myself.  I think it's rude when people obnoxiously say "What?" EVERY time you say something.  To me, it feels like they are too lazy to try to listen to what you're saying and it comes off as rude.  I know for a fact that people who say "What?" all the time just don't listen well, because I speak REALLY clearly and enunciate all the time and most people can understand something I say the first time I say it.  There are just a few people out there who always say "What?"      At least if you didn't hear/understand something someone said, I feel like it is less rude to say maybe, "huh?" or "hm?" or "Say that again?".  It doesn't seem as obnoxious.      What is your take on this matter?

They go on to say that Australians' cringe at the idea that Australian design is about kangaroos and koalas in swag hats...or that Australian design is just about "copying" international design because we dont have cultural identity.   1st of all, i sort of agree to a point that yes Australians cringe a little at the funny australian animals wearing hats because it is so repetetive (and admitingly a little silly)...what im wanting to know from other people around the world is do you too cringe a little at your iconic symbols in your own country as they are so repetitive?      I would also like to know if you agree with the fact that Australia is a multi-cultural country and therefore we should just accept the fact that we dont have a certain cultural identity in design because we are all different with different experiences....

There's no time for superstitions!      3) A rebel girl comes into a bar completely naked and says:    - I want a very cold beer!    The barman stares at her without moving. She says:    - What's the problem? Have you never seen any naked woman?    - Yes, a lot of times.    - So what at you looking at?    - I just don't know where are you bringing the money for paying.      4) In a taxi. The passenger touch the driver's shoulder to ask him a question.   The taxi driver cries, lose control of the car, almost crashes into a truck, go on the sidewalk and finally enter into a shop-window breaking it into pieces.   There's a moment of silence till the driver says:    - My friend, don't ever do that again, I was so scared!   The passenger apology and says:    - I didn't know that touching your shoulder was going to frighten you so much.    - It's just because it's my first day as a taxi driver.    - And what did you do before?    - I had been a hearse driver for 25 years.

20090304130838AAKKhiP	Society & Culture;Etiquette	I am going to talk to the priciple of our school about a rule I don't aprove of. Any opinions?	READ THE WHOLE QUESTION!       Today I was five minutes late for school, and I got a half-an-hour detention. That is the way things work in our school, It doesn't matter if you are 1 minute late, or 2 hours late, you still get a half hour detention. They also do not do "strikes." This was my very first offense to the school.               I think that there point is that punnishment should be equal for everyone. MY POINT is that equality doesn't matter as much as punnishment should be fair. I was late because the world doesn't revolve around me, my brother (he is in middle school) needed to be dropped off at his school too (they don't count that as an excuse and I guess that makes sense, it was our fault that we were late, but, hey life happens.) Yet, I got the same punnishment as someone would if they had just ditched first period because they didn't want to go to class.           I didn't waste their time, It was only five minutes, people were just getting into their seats. But they wasted MY time, because they were trying to prove something to me. SO, to sum things up, I think that: "Circumstances are not black and white. Tardy punnishments should be based on number of times a student has been tardy, and how tardy they were."      And yeah, I know that it's really not that big of a deal, I'm not whineing about this. I went to the detention, it was only a half an hour. I only think that people should be treated with more respect than this. Just because we are teenagers doesn't mean that we shouldn't be treated fairly. I know that rule is mostly because they are afraid that when we are late to school, it's because were doing pot or something. People are so stereotypical. We are treated like Juvenile Delinquents. Some kids are like that -of course there are- but it's not like EVERYONE is like that.       SO, WHAT ARE YOUR OPINIONS ON THE SUBJECT?

20090304121054AAWwM3C	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Has political correctness, turned many people into being overly sensitive?	used to be, if someone called you something you didnt like, you moved on from it, and went on in life.      but it seems like nowadays. if a person says one thing you do not like, then you go out of your way to annihilate them in some way. like punish them for it.      not everyone does this...but it sure does seem like alot of people do it.      and i say people, because, this is not just related to one race, like some people want others to believe.      its seems like, being plain curious now, can be considered racist.      do you think this is a good or bad direction, society is coming to?
20090304123855AA6Y1Pc	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	If every race, has its negative side, why cant people ask about it?	it seems like, people want to hide, those negative side of a race, and kinda pretend that its not fully true. like being in denial.      thing is, sure, that "negative side" does not apply to everyone in that race.      but why is it when people ask about why something is the way it is (pertaining to that negative side). people chastise you, in every way, rather than answer why?      even though we are all humans. we are all different. and it is almost like, it is no longer okay to ask that "why" question about something anymore.      so my question is. can you tell me, why people want to hide the negative side? is it really going to do any bad by admitting, that no race, is flawless?      as a test, if you believe in being honest, name one flaw, you feel like you have observed about your own race.

Now I am a person who is half black and half white and I understand that there are alot of mixed races, However I thinks its wrong to claim only one side like black because is your skin color or the nationality of your father thingy. I'm not basing this off skin but I'm tired of people seeing us as just black or just white. Barack Obama is not just black he is white to and its his choice whether he wants to claim it or not like many other people choose. But you can't base the way an entire nationality is off people and the way they were raised. There are racist people in every culture and every facit of life. I just feel that because my nationality is seen as so cliche' still that your either taught to not acknowledge it or claim it fully. Well I do and I want a box that says of black descent and white descent not other or mixed race.

Me and my friends were talking about whether or not all Americans have the equal chance to succeed. I said no, because a person born into a poorer family will not have the same oppurtunities in education as a person born into a richer family. My friends' argument was a lady born into poverty who worked hard and got into harvard, then got a good job and now is rich. I still think that not everyone has the equal chance to succeed because there is a variety of factors that affect a persons ability to succeed.

20090304125543AANbVCf	Society & Culture;Mythology & Folklore	How do I protect myself and house from mischeivious spirits?	I recently had something happen to me in the house that I'm living in... and out of it. I've lived here for 3 years. I got engagesd about 2 months agoe. My fiance has felt the same sort of thing. He's very sensitive to energies around him.       On Thursday last week, I was by myself in my house cleaning the garage, etc, we're getting ready for my fiance and his son to move in with us... I felt a presence with me all of a sudden, behind me... I called my fiance and told him about it. He said that it might be his dad playing with him. He died about 5 years ago. I told him it was sort of creepy feeling, and he said his dad was kind of a pervert, lol. Anyway, I got off the phone and went back into the garage, where the presence followed me. I told it to leave and I opened the garage door. It didn't. So, I did. I went to my fiance's mom's house where he works. I told them about it, and was feeling much better...       We decided to celebrate (his mom, dad, sister, friend, he and I), I went to buy some beer, but had to come back to the house to get my ID. I didn't notice the presence again, but I did feel strange... Later on, I had consumed 5 drinks, ate dinner, and it was midnight. I was definitely inebriated, but I was in control of myself. Then, my fiance says that I was looking at the wall and I suddenly turned to him and my eyes flashed at him, and there was a fiery look in my eyes that wasn't there before. I had changed. He was trying to figure out what was inside of me and sort of being playful. We were bickering, I suppose in a way...        Another time, about 2 months ago, he and I were lying in bed and I felt suddenly playful and flipped him off, which is very unlike me... he got mad, but then froze and became sort of angry, more than justified. He said that he felt a presence as well, and that his body had seized.       Anyway, my question is... I don't think this presence is necessarily evil, but definitely mischievous, I'd like to be able to communicate with it and tell it to stop making trouble for us. Also, I am a very empathetic person, I am able to pick up on the feelings of others very easily, and make them my own. How do I protect myself from this energy and sort of possession? I have not, and have decided not to for some time, drink alcohol. That's a decision I have made.

20090304135952AAyCtWD	Society & Culture;Holidays;Ramadan	Ramadan: Why Sunnis don't do Sajda on Turba (Mud) Rasoolallah (saww) used to do it.?	It is written in their Sahih books.   I saw Allah's Apostle prostrating on mud and water and saw the mark of mud on his forehead.      (Sahih Bukhari Volume 1, Hadith 798)      Abu Said Al Khudri narrates:      The Messenger of Allah used to practice Itikaf (in the mosque), in the middle third of Ramadan. After the twentieth night, he used to return home on the twenty-first, and those who were in Itikaf with him would return to their homes as well. In Ramadan, in which he practiced Itikaf, he would pray the night prayers on the night in which he returned home, and then address the people, instructing them as Allah commanded him. He said, "I used to practice Itikaf for these ten days (i.e. the middle third of Ramadan), but I now intend to stay in Itikaf for the last ten days. Whoever was in Itikaf with me should stay at his place of seclusion. I have certainly been shown (the date of) this Night (of Qadr), but I have forgotten it. Search for it in the odd nights of the last ten days (of Ramadan). I also saw myself (in a dream) prostrating in mud and water." On the twenty-first night, the sky was covered with clouds and it rained, and the rainwater started leaking through the roof of the mosque onto the praying place of the Prophet. With my own eyes,? I saw the Prophet, upon completion of the morning prayer, leaving (the mosque) with his face covered with mud and water.      Sahih Al-Bukhari Hadith 3.235      Abu Hazim narrates:      Sahl bin Sa'd was asked about the (Prophet's) pulpit, as to what was it made of. Sahl replied: No one is still alive among the people who knows about it better than I. It was made of tamarisk forest wood. So and so, the slave of so and so, prepared it for the Messenger of Allah. When it was constructed and placed (in the mosque), the Messenger of Allah stood on it, facing the Qibla, and said, "Allahu Akbar", and the people stood behind him (in prayer). He recited and bowed, and the people behind him bowed. Then he raised his head, stepped back, descended and prostrated on the ground. He then again ascended the pulpit, recited, bowed, raised his head, stepped back, descended and prostrated on the ground. This is what I know about the pulpit.      Sahih Al-Bukhari Hadith 1.374      Hazrat Maimuna said:      The Messenger of Allah used to pray on a Khumra (a palm leaf mat large enough to place one's face, while in prostration).      Sahih Al-Bukhari Hadith 1.378      Abu Sa'eed used to relate that he had seen the Prophet prostrating on wet mud, so much so that he could see mud stains on his forehead.      Saheeh Bukhari, Part I, p. 104      Hazrat Maimuna said:      The Messenger of Allah was once praying while I was experiencing my menses and sitting beside him. Sometimes his clothing would touch me during his prostration. She added: He prayed on a Khumra (a small palm leaf mat).      Saheeh Bukhari, Volume 1, Book 8, Number 376

20090304144854AAZ15YD	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Why do some people......?	act so awful at times. Their is this girl in one of my college classes that me and this other guy had to work with as a group. This was one of those types of girls that is super tan, has a pretty face, has pretty hair, and pretty clothes. The only thing that was off about her was that she had one of those monroe piercings on the lower part of her lip. This girl normally had a "group" of people that she always sat next to. Today though, he was the only one that showed up. So me and this other guy got together and asked if she wanted to be in our group to. She just shrugged her shoulders and said, "I guess so." It was so ridiculous how rude she was. I mean, the only reason she was acting like this was because she had to work with to guys that didn't add up to her standard. She all she did the entire times was write whatever we came up with all while texting on her phone. At one point she started to lose her patience with us and started to yell what do you want me to write down! She might be beautiful, be her personality was awful. Why do girls like this do that?

20090227071848AAO1ncN	Society & Culture;Etiquette	What should I do about this male friend?	I have known him for over 10 years I think on and off but letely he has been really depending on me for all sorts of things. He was made homeless like 6 months ago and he has only just recently started sorting himself out! He is 43 and Im 30 and was living in a trailer on some friend's land out of town for this whole time. He kept 'expecting' me to let him have baths at my house, aswell as expecting me to 'feed' him and wash his clothes. He causes me so much stress, I suffer from anxiety and it hasnt been doing me any good, he keeps expecting me to sort out all his problems for him and has been using my address as a postal address until now. I finally put my foot down when he got a mortgage for a house, he had enough money to pay for the house in savings so it wasnt like he was using my home as collateral or anything but that was the last straw for me! I had been asking him to stop using my address for all his mail for months but he never takes me seriously and acts like he has no respect for me. I finally started returning his mail and now he is panicing and keeps texting me saying he can't understand what he has done wrong even though I have been pretty clear telling him what my problems with him are. Should I leave him to grow up? I can't be bothered with him anymore, he is so demanding and expects everything to be about him all the time. What should I do? I have ignored his last 2 texts.
20090304133843AARdYDu	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	How can it be that ALL people who share a certain mutation in their DNA are assumed to have descended from ONE?	(continued)      person? After all, aren't those DNA mutations supposed to be RANDOM? Can't two or more people who lived in different times and different places INDEPENDENTLY acquire the same mutation? Is the assumption wrong? Anyway, here's the stuff (sorry it's a bit long):      " The marker M9 first appeared in a man born around 40,000 years ago in present day Iran or south-central Asia.  This marked a new lineage diverging from the M89 Middle Eastern clan.  His descendants spent the next 30,000 years populating much of the planet.      This large linage, called the Eurasian Clan, dispersed gradually over thousands of years.  Seasoned hunters followed the herds ever eastward, along the vast 'highway' of the Eurasian Steppe.   Eventually their path was blocked by the massive mountain ranges of south-central Asia: the Hindu Kush, the Tian Shan and the Himalayas.  These three mountain ranges meet in the center of a region known as the Pamir Knot, located in present-day Tajikistan.  Here the tribes of hunters split into two main groups.  Some moved north into central Asia, others moved south into what is now Pakistan and the Indian subcontinent.  These different migration routes through the Pamir Knot region gave rise to separate lineages.  Most people of the Northern Hemisphere trace their roots to the Eurasian Clan.  Nearly all North Americans and East Asians are descended from this man, as are most Europeans and many Indians."       http://www.kknfa.org/haplogroups.htm

20090304135244AAHvCqH	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians, does it offend you when people don't believe?	I'm asking because it seems that there are times when you tell a Christian "I'm not interested" and I rarely see the subject dropped easily. I told my Christian mother in law that I'm agnostic and every time I talk to her, she's still trying to get me to go to bible study. People have been trying to "save me" for most of my life thus far. Though I'm appreciative that they care about my "salvation", I also feel that as an adult, I'm within my rights to believe as I wish. I have no desire to convince anyone to believe or feel as I do. I respect everyone's beliefs and I'd just like the same in return. It seems as though some Christians just keep pushing and pushing until you have to be rude and that's not something I want to do. Is this something that's difficult for a Christian to hear? Why can't no mean no?

20090304133611AAYfMVG	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	What is your Fascination or turn on with gay porn?	Or, no matter what your sexual orientation is, what's your turn on to the type of porn you like that is the opposite of what you actually do in reality. Like if your a lesbian but you like gay male porn?      For example, I realize that my main fascination and turn on to gay porn, is seeing two guys who put their emotional defenses down in order to enjoy each other. No hurtful competitions with each other, that most straight guys do. No fighting against each other. Not sizing each other up. Just trust, companionship, and sex between the two. Since it's a fantasy, I don't need to sexually be with a guy to have that, just good friends is enough since I'm not attracted guys in real life.       Or lesbian porn. I love it because I imagine myself being one of the girls during the act. I'm not actually a closet lesbian since I'm a straight guy, but fantasizing that I'm a girl screwing another girl is such a turn on. Imagining what it's like to connect with another girl intimately, as a girl, is just awesome to me.      What about any of you. I know, strange question, but I love thinking outside the box. I get bored with reality sometimes.

20090227072153AAAsXkR	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Does a having a child change a person's morals?	This is a three part question.      Do you believe that having a son/daughter causes many people to adopt a new set of morals?      If so, why?  Do you think there is a difference in this process between atheists and those that believe in a God or gods?      I'm just curious what others think, making no judgments here.  I know that in my case, my morals didn't really change, but I did find myself being a lot more cautious in daily life.  But you often hear stories of people that completely change their lives and morals because they had a child (the partying parents that settle down, the drug addict that cleans up, etc.).

20090304142350AAQAVWD	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians always say that God gave us free will because He didn't want robots. So why punish us for using it?	He gave us free will, but seemingly doesn't want us to actually USE it because when we do, He gets mad! The only time He's happy with us is when we do exactly as He says - just like the ROBOTS! Can't He make up His mind? If He wants us to have free will, then He shouldn't get pushed out of shape when we use it, and having free will means that sometimes we will decide to do something other than what He wants. If He can't handle free willed humans on Earth, what's He going to do with the bunch that's supposedly going to be with Him for all eternity in HEAVEN? If they still have free will, sooner or later they WILL disobey Him... it's inevitable.

(he was turning 15). i was the first one to his house, so we talked for awhile, and when someone else got there, he asked me if i wanted to walk with him around the neighborhood to get bob. i said sure, but bob texted me and said he was on his way, so we didn't go. joe was like "dang". i just said sorry. well the whole time at the party, i was with bob, and joe was with his girlfriend, but he kept looking at me and giving me these sort of depressed looks. i didnt think anything of it...      whenever joe hugs me, he seems like its sort of awkward for him. i asked one of our friends about it (she's known him forever, so i figured she would know.) and she said that joe never hugs anyone except his girlfriend, and apparently me.      since bob broke up with me, today joe came to lunch and was like "im sitting by destini! i dont care if im a traitor!" bob seemed a bit confused, and i didnt know what to think. joe always calls himself my "bestie" and get really excited when he sees me. he always argues with people at lunch so he can sit by me, and we text almost everyday.      i asked 3 of my closest friends about this, and they said it seems like joe may have a bit of a crush on me. but JOE HAS A GIRLFRIEND! i think i sort of liked him before, but bob got to me 1st. im also trying to make sure joe isnt rebound. i just feel bad cause he has a gf, and he's athiest and im a big God person.      1. do you think he likes me?   2. do you think its worth waiting for?   3. what do you think i should do?   4. any other advice?

I'm Mexican American and my dad is is Mexican but he is not of Spanish descent he is of Polish descent and he has a Slavic last name which is really weird because Polish people in Mexico??? Never heard of that. But that explains why my great grandfathers last name was Rutkowski but he then changed it to Rutco. I just found out about this a few weeks ago when I visited my grandpa in Texas.      Do I look Polish at all to you? Because I told a couple of my friends at school and some said yes and some said no. I don't really see it, to me I look more like my mom's side of the family except with lighter eyes.

20090304134313AAr5bMI	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	How Goth am I? Am I just another fake?	I love Goth, but I don't have any friends that are Goth at all, and I really want to know. So here's a bit about me   1. I love Goth but sometimes some goth people strike me as ugly.   2. I love Marilyn Manson music even though I still think he's a bit freaky in a funny way. I also love Slipknot, and in no ways do I feel their freaky, at first they were scary but I got over it in a week.   3. I love black, crimson red, velvet, and black and black and black. I don't care if it's too hot for me to wear black I just love the color of it.   4. I'm anti-religion, but I don't really think it's got much to do with goth.   5. I prefer being a devil or demon, not an angel.   6. I swear a lot (? I wonder if that's related to goth again)   7. I don't give a s**t about what people think, but I don't want to piss my parents off.   8. I don't dress like a hardcore goth even though I'm dying too--strict parents, nothing like Americans. The most I can get is black eyeliner, red-black gloves, black pants, black shirts, either red-black tie or lots of chains, sometimes I can wear a Japanese Gothic Lolita outfit, but that just makes me cute if I don't wear heavy eyeliner.   9. I like to stand out, I don't care in a good or bad way.   10. no offence, but I'm not keen on preps or jocks and I've always thought of them as clones.   11. I don't care about stereotypes, a girl/guy wants to be my friend, I don't mind. But if they're only there to insult the Goth cult I call them names to their faces.   12. I used to be 100% emo, but I recently realized--after I cheered up--that I was becoming more and more Goth everyday.   13. big interest in wicca, vampire (the violent kind, not exactly twilight), etc.   14. I like Chick lit despite the fact most of them are sorta preppy, but I've never been satisfied because I haven't found a good goth book      OK, so just tell me, I love Goth very much but from what I'm doing, am I just some plain goth poser or wannabe, or do I at least have so goth in me? I'll swear to satan that I love goth.
20090304142137AAU81jQ	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Do men secretly hate women but tolerate us for sexual purposes?	A good example of this is looking at: An overweight, or otherwise 'unattractive', woman's position in this society reflects women's true position in this patriarchy. Women who fall within patriarchy's unrealistic beauty margins--i.e. extremely skinny with huge breasts--are given temporary favors by men, such as preferential treatment, doors held, increased visibility and attention, money, and so forth. These women are rewarded, temporarily, by this disgusting, irrational, and hateful patriarchy. Men despise women. This is manifested in their treatment of overweight, handicapped, or older women. Even the women men consider 'attractive' men hate, by objectifying these women as objects. Men project their hatred on these women as well, but are more overt in their hatred of fat women. This should not be acceptable to any women.

I went on a trip to NJ last weekend with my cousin and one of her girlfriends, I'm only 13, my cousin and her friend are in their 20s already. to save money we stayed in one hotel room with two beds. My cousin said she wanted to sleep in the same bed with her friend, so I could have my own bed.      But at night, I was woken up by a noise, I didn't get up or move. I saw my cousin and her friend were both under the sheets, their entire bodies were covered and I couldn't even see their faces. But it seems like they were directly on top of each other. I could only see their hands hanging out at the top of the bed, they were holding both hands with their fingers crossed, so I knew they were face to face. They stayed that way for a long time, and it seems like they were pushing each other or having some sort of test of strength, I got a lil scared because I thought they were fighting. They stayed like that for at least an hour or so, they didn't let go of each other's hands at all, it was kinda like hand to hand wrestling or domination of some sort.      Is my cousin a lesbian? I can't be sure since I didn't see anything clearly.....or were they just wrestling?

20090304134409AAgd3nR	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	How do I convince my friends that not all Germans/Austrians are Nazis?	I asked this before so sorry to ask it again, but my yahoo account was randomly deleted before I got to read answers. No idea what happened to my account:(      I have two friends (twins) who are Jewish. Something like 47 members of their family were murdered during WWII by the Nazis. Recently both boys have convinced themselves that all Germans and Austrians are responsible for this. It's really ironic that they are bigoted against people for supposedly being bigots! Especially since one twin is close friends with an Austrian boy. I have a crush on that same Austrian boy and have been accused of being antiSemetic and a neoNazi! (I'm not German, they think that because I have a crush on the boy) How can I convince them that this generation of Germans/ Austrians is not responsible for the Holocaust, and not blow up at them? I've pointed out that these boys are part German- no, they're not, apparently they're 100% Middle Eastern because their German relatives only married other Jews (Hasidim). I also asked if 10 year old Germans are responsible- they said yes. I told them that my ancestors were slave-holding b@stards and apparently I'm responsible for that too! Then I just got REALLY mad...So how should I make a couple of angry teens see how crazy they are being? They're usually much more sensible than this( otherwise we wouldn't be friends) and I think this may just be a phase but it's still not right. What's a good argument to make? Ugh, sorry for my rant.

I didn't say I agree with it, just that I understand why they feel like they do.  Number 1, there are very few decent acting men in general, number 2 there are even fewer decent acting black men in the US do to shear population size, number 3 if most of the black men in a black woman's neighborhood are with a woman of another race and the fact of the matter is that the extreme majority of white men, latinos, chinese etc are not attracted to black women that makes the black woman's dating pool extreeeemely shallow, so I can see why she is upset.  It doesn't give her the right to give them the evil eye, but I can see where she is coming from.  But dis dude went off saying I am racist and ignorant just because I can see their point of view. what do you think?

I mean seriously after you make like over 500 million dollars you are set for life and can even have your kids set. However their are people like Bill Gates who have like 50 Billion dollars and they still want more or like Donald Trump who insist that their golf course needs a huge flag pole and his airplane has gold faucets. If I had even like 10 million I would be happy and stop trying to get more wealthy or I would give the rest of my income to helping people out. Rich people who have tons of money and just spend it on ridiculous crap like gold toilets seats and personal airplanes are scumbags in my book. Instead of putting that money to good use like building Waste to Energy facilities, creating farms in poor countries that have millions of people starving and funding fields of science that make cures for diseases along with finding a cure for cancer, AIDS, Malaria etc they decide yeah well screw these people this money is better spent on buying myself tons of cars and a huge house for myself in the summer time. As for them donating to charities they only do that so they can get a tax break so they can make more money in the long run. Why is it extremely rich people just hate to help other people and only truly care about blowing millions on themselves and making more? Is it a mental issue these people have or just greed?

I kind of do because.......      everywhere I look, heterosexuals.   like God forbid a man makes a public appearance without being accompanied by his wife.        I try to make it clear that I'm gay for two reasons:   1. so other gays can find me easier   2. so the world knows that love isn't just between a man and a woman.  being of the opposite sex is not a requriements for a loving relationship.
20090227072538AAhgBWm	Society & Culture;Etiquette	Weird Hygiene question!!!!!!!!!?	Ok I was dating this really cute guy for a while but we broke up and remained good friends. we’ve known each other for over 2 years and are very close. He is tall and very handsome; only thing is… his personal hygiene is absolutely terrible!!! He doesn’t wash his clothes for weeks at a time, wears shirts with stains and holes on them, I’m not sure what his bathing situation is but sometimes when I’m close to him he stinks really bad like he’s in dire need of some deodorant. How can I tell him (in a nice way of course) that his lack of cleanliness grosses me out? He wants to get back together and this is the very reason I broke up with him. I want him to know that but I don’t wanna hurt his feelings. Please help. No mean comments, just good advice. Thanks.

20090227074112AAGvbaH	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	My son says he wants to marry his boyfriend.?	I am a single father to three sons, aged 20, 17 and 13. My wife died just after our third son was born. I've raised them by myself completely, and I thought I did a good job.      Yet now I feel like a failure. My 20 year old son says he wants to marry a 43 year old black man! I myself am 45, so he is only two years older than me. My son only told me about the relationship 1-2 weeks ago, but he said it's been goimng on for a few months. I haven't met the guy yet.      My son is good looking and has had girlfriends before, so I don't know what his problem is. I've told him he's wasting his life. He could marry a nice young girl and have a family, but he chooses to do this?!      I know this story seems far fetched, but is the truth. I am really concerned and don't know what to do. He knows I don't approve of homosexuality.
