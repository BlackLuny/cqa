However to be on the safe side, and so you are not a bag of nerves for the next month, visit your doctor to get emergency pill which can be taken upto 72 hours after sex - but the quicker its taken the more reliable.<br>  You've only just seeing this lad so I would say use condoms because the pill doesn't protect you from STIs|`|WkV7U7Ehaa	well premature ejaculation is likely to happen..<br>  take the morning after pill as soon as possible and take a test in a few weeks just to be sure.<br>  <br>  also, try not to be so careless, have you not considered what sorts of diseases you might contract?<br>  i hate to sound like a moral crusader, but come on!|`|9WgZZFGfaa	try not to worrie! your prob not pregnant would you think about going to the doctor maybe and get a test? when did you have sex you could also get the morning after|`|qtA5oCeAaa	you should have used protection then you wouldnt have to worry about this but take a test because anything can happen

It works the milk lumps out so u will not get mastitis or clogged milk glands. Also the cracking get lanolin. Hope it helps good luck.|`|2vBmRcv6aa	DO NOT let the doctor give baby water or anything!  This makes them suck less.  A baby is supposed to be slightly "dehydrated" for a few days until your milk comes in.  Just drink a lot and feed all the time (like every hour) for a few days.  <br>  <br>  my doctor gave my baby water without my permission with my first child. She had been latching on fine, but lost interest on the second day, then they were all trying to have me supplement with formula.  Luckilly I did not. My baby got enough milk and never used a pump or supplemented.<br>  <br>  I did not find out untill later that she had been given the water. That was what made her stop nursing well in the first place.  I've since done research and it seams like most of the people who have low milk supply is for similar reasons. It really is rare not to be able to produce enough milk.<br>  <br>  Sorry for bad typing. I am using one hand while I'm nursing :)|`|Bc5k0ghgaa	Try taking Warm showers before the birh of the baby and massage ur brest it will help u to produce milk faster <br>  Using a pump also helps. .it gets ur breast use to making milk and also placing a warm rag on the top of ur breast. . <br>  <br>  <br>  If u know where they have a wic office they also give help with a breast feeding counselor|`|7CnCY6LQaa	Hey you may want to talk to a lactation consultant in the hospital when you have the baby,if they are good at what they do they should give you the advice that you are looking for.Sorry I couldnt be of more help.Good Luck|`|edbeaf74946e31ae50c17ddd80060083aa	There is a cream that is supposed to be very good.  You could ask your pharmasist or look on the Laleche League web site (maybe).   You could start to moisturize before the baby is born to prevent dryness and cracks.  I don't know about the thrush but it's probably not something that will recur.  Make the nursing a priority for the first few months.   Make sure you drink lots of liquids, relax, and trust your body to know what is right.  Try to get as much support as you can.  I hope this helps.  It's hard to know how to help with out knowing the whole story but I do know that it is extremely rewarding to nurse your baby and you will not regret spending that time with him/her.  Good luck and enjoy every minute of your time with your children;  I know it's very clich but they really do grow up so fast.|`|Ls93X4ufaa	I successfully breastfed all three of my children until each of them were a year old. The number one rule I would give mothers is to stick with it! No matter what! You will produce enough milk to nourish your baby. Cracks and thrush are so rough, but you have to stick it out. There were several hard weeks with each were I desperately wanted to supplement, but I knew breast milk was better for the baby and for me. Expressing was painful so I avoided it. I commend you on giving it another shot. I feel that women who choose not to breastfeed are missing out on one of the great joys of motherhood and a bonding experience like nothing else in this world. Congratulations and good luck to you!
eNulfbs7aa	The odds are that the baby will turn.  My last baby didn't turn until very late.  He is now 8 years old and very healthy..don't worry...I read everything I could get my hands on...it scared me and educated me allll at the same time.  I will be praying that your baby will be fabulous...and turned the right direction to face this fabulous world!  Good Luck|`|H2IhRXIIaa	They baby will prob turn..lets hope..but if notthen you will need a c section. Good luck.|`|83341f44c00d0863eafb9c7c6a1709d7aa	I have 3 children, 5, 4, and 15 months.....my 4 yr. old was transverse causing me to have a c-section. She is a healthy little girl starting preschool this fall. She has NO disorders either. Some babies will turn head down at the last minute. Do not worry too much.....most babies do not get head down until week 36 or 37. If for some reason that your baby does not turn than you will probably need a c-section. The most important thing for now is to get plenty of rest and stay healthy for the baby. And......the most important outcome is a healthy mommy and baby. Good luck.|`|Ls93X4ufaa	Usually so late in pregnancy the baby can't turn because it is too big and there is not enough room. Then again, babies do what they want and sometimes they will find a way to turn themselves around. If the doctor and you are so worried about it, you can always choose to have a Cesarean.|`|l0YvaYTDaa	He may still turn.  I haven't heard anything about breach babies having a higher chance of disorders.  The only thing I was worried about was getting a c-section!|`|YP1DXbBDaa	Babies turn right up until the end.  There are lots of things that you can do to help the baby turn though.<br>  <br>  See a chiropractor trained in the Webster technique-you can find one at icpa4kids.org.  Webster is a technique that helps get your pelvis into the best position for the baby to turn head down.  <br>  <br>  Look for an acupuncturist who also does moxibustion-moxibustion involves using heated  (warm not burning) herbs on certain points in the body to help get the baby to turn.<br>  <br>  You can talk to your health care provider about a version-a technique where they try to turn the baby from the outside of your womb-that tends to happen later in pregnancy when it would be safer for your  baby to be born in an emergency.  <br>  <br>  Also, the website Spinningbabies.com has exercises and techniques to help get your baby into an optimal position for labor.|`|C8JKsvdmaa	your baby still has time to turn, make sure you don't slouch when sitting down , also spend time on your hands and knees with your pelvis higher than your head as this will encourage him to settle head down and visualization can work too . you didn't mention if this is your first and second/third babies can turn later as the uterus has been stretched before. also obgyn can try to turn your baby by palpitating your stomach in hospital as it carries the risk of bursting your waters.|`|cBgLqUigaa	If your baby is breech I would recommend going to someone who knows how to do the webster technique I think that a chiropractor is able to do this. They reset your sacrum and put pressure on some sort of ligament by the uterus and that can help the baby to turn and has a good record.   It may take a few times though. I would definitely try it because I would not want a c-section unless life threatening. Good luck!
OlS4uijKaa	Well, are you on the pill? Because often times when you've been on the same prescription for a long time you will have break through bleeding-not usually super light ( a few drops) but not usually as heavy as a period either.<br>  <br>  The bleeding if taken by itself could already be a number of things....burst cysts, endometriosis, etc....when looked at in conjunction with the other symptoms (sore throat etc) it could be something else. <br>  You really should do a couple of things:<br>  A) take a pregnancy test, if that is negative, then...<br>  B) talk to your family doctor about it and they may refer you to a GYN for further testing.|`|tQO9LW8Qaa	Why don't go back to the doctor you saw yesterday, or to a gynecologist or free clinic, and get evaluated. If you were pregnant you could be having a miscarriage. If you weren't pregnant you might be having mid-cycle bleeding or an irregular period. Either way, if you go to a doctor you'll find out and you can stop worrying.|`|etUFe6tJaa	There can be so many reasons for your bleeding.  I think instead of speculating the reasons why, I would do the following:<br>  Get yourself to a GP, or a gyno, and get some blood tests done.  Get them to do a hormone profile - usually that will give you some indication as to what's going on reproductively.<br>  <br>  Regarding the possibility of pregnancy, I am also bleeding myself (and pregnant), but it is never really classified as a proper symptom of pregnancy - so just to get that out of the way I suggest a pregnancy test.  But the bloodtest can also give you an accurate answer too.<br>  <br>  I think you need to really tell your GP about your bleeding problems. Good luck.

IFDfpbFJaa	My sister has it and from what her doctor is saying, you will not make it to term. You're going to have to have a c-section 4 weeks early because when your cervix starts to loosen up to open, it will pull away from the placenta and cause bleeding. it's not good for you and it's not good for the baby. She's due May 13th but they think they are going to take the baby before April 20th. I'm not sure exactly what date they are doing the C-section but it will be 4 weeks before. April 20th is her baby shower day and they said she'll probably have her baby at the shower. (meaning, the baby will be at the shower, she won't go into labor at the shower)<br>  <br>  Good Luck. Medical technology is amazing now days. A lot of babies are fine even before 4 weeks early.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	You still have plenty of time in your pregnancy for its position to change,so I would still have hope. As far as the complications caused by this,during birth,as far as I know,is just excess bleeding. You'd need to talk to your doctor about further information.|`|b4a7YtTsaa	My mom had placenta previa for all 3 of us.<br>  <br>  I was born 5 weeks early weighing 5'6''<br>  My sister was born 10 weeks early weighing 4'3''<br>  and my brother was 15 weeks early weighing 1'6''.<br>  <br>  My sister and I are perfectly healthy, but unfortunately my brother passed away at birth. (but that was 21 years ago and technology had came so far)  There are many things they can do now that will prevent you from going into labor early.  I hope this helped and good luck! :)
7rCeCVl2aa	Being a mom gets easier but parenting gets harder... The decisions get harder... your child's situations get harder... but it's all rewarding at the end of the day and worth every second.<br>  <br>  Feel free to IM me. =) I could share some great "hard" stories with you.|`|a03a43bb5a9fa8406b5e2c0effe464beaa	The adjustment to being a 24/7 care giver gets easier bar none but with every breath she takes your role as Mother gets harder. Now you don't have to get up in the middle of the night to check if she's breathing or if she's hungry or wet but the next step (I think until they are grown and out of the house probably - lol) will push your patience and dedication to a level you never thought possible. But what evens all that out is with every breath she takes you are infused with the joy of your child and what she's newly capable of. It's not an easy job but it's worth it!|`|AA10943329	once you get through the terrible 2's and 3's...if you survive it lol it does not get harder it just is different. Every age has it's own challenges and rewards but the hardest are the 2-3 years I found|`|heDtLdz5aa	i think it gets more challenging...you may get more sleep as time goes on but you start to chase them around all day when they become moblile...either way i love it..i love being a mom|`|DDFSITiYaa	It doesn't get easier or harder - it just gets different.|`|XXbFFVg8aa	I think in the moment it feels as though it is getting harder, but when you look back, you say "that was nothin!".<br>  For instance, when my daughter was born, I had no idea what to expect and so of course it was hard and I didn't get any sleep, etc. But then when she started being mobile and moving around, I look back at those first few months and say "wow that was easy compared to now!"<br>  As you said, parenting, I have found, is all about adjusting. Once you adjust to the particular phase you're in, it goes from being "hard" to being "easy" in perspective. <br>  <br>  Hope that answered your question =)|`|yhpR2gNiaa	I think it's a pattern through out the child's life.<br>  Every child goes through phases, when you learn how to handle that phase it gets easier. <br>  Some phases will be easy and some will be difficult. I don't necessarily think it gets easier as the child gets older. The child may learn to help but that doesn't assure you that the future will get easier. Who knows, you might face the most challenging time when your child is 8 rather than1.<br>  <br>  I do understand where you are coming from. It's very hard to adjust to a newborn. But what's really difficult it when you get used to one phase and then another one begins.|`|8zdPI8Qsaa	I agree with you. I think the 'adjustment' to having children is the hardest part... and that takes time for everyone. Though each stage does get more challenging, and physically demanding, I feel like having an 18 month old is definitely easier than having a newborn. I think the next 'hard' part of parenting is going to be adjusting to having two in the house. I get nervous thinking about it... eek. I still have 7 more months to collect myself though :-)|`|TJusfEnlaa	I think it gets easier - my son is only 9 months old still but is walking.

So, I suppose big parties aren't that bad. Haha.|`|ioGCMeAeaa	girl i know exactly how you feel, middle school does suck, but friends help ya get through it.

Maybe they will invite you next time. hope i helped|`|6pEDLnrzaa	The ones at our school weren't huge but they weren't small<br>  <br>  I was invited I chose not to go, to much drama and usually the cops get called.

x5aJcD9zaa	My midwife and physiotherapist both recommend stopping that kind of thing when you know you are pregnant.<br>  <br>  The reason they advise against it is because pregnancy hormones cause the natural loosening of your ligaments in preparation for birth.  Birth might be a fair while away, but your ligaments are already loosening.  <br>  <br>  Simply, because of the loosening of the ligaments, it is easier for you to injure your delicate spine or joints.<br>  <br>  I am 16 weeks and I am still lifting things such as laundry and what-not.  I am just super concious of lifting correctly, ie: bending from the knees and keeping your back straight.  Lift correctly and you will be fine.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|sSRHQkROaa	i believe it's until the 2nd trimester after that you should be fine.<br>  really they don't want you lifting anything that will cause you strain or that is out of the norm.<br>  <br>  when i found out i was pregnant i worked as a transporter in the hospital so i was pushing 250lb people on top of a bed/stretcher or wheel chair and i'm okay...my pregnancy is going well.|`|PN7ELn3aaa	I'm 32 weeks pregnant and am still working as a server at a busy restaurant. My Dr. says I'll know when I'm pushing my limits...I've lightened my loads but I still carry heavy trays, I'm well conditioned for it.<br>  <br>  I don't think you'll have to worry about carrying laundry baskets at all unless you have problems with your pregnancy. Make sure you are careful picking up and setting things down, you don't want to strain yourself!|`|Ra8cdjbDaa	I'd say around 4 months you should stop lifting heavy stuff.  I was only 3 months pregnant when we moved and my husband wouldn't let me lift any of the big stuff.  Now when I go shopping and try to pick up a bag of cat food for example, I'll feel like I can't do it.  (Before I didn't lift things because everyone was on me about not doing it.)

VR9KhbEgaa	I am a retail manager and have been for over 10 years. In these 10 years I have had 6 children and I am pregnant with my last child now. I worked until the day before I had all of my kids and plan to do so this go round as well, even though I am considered a high risk pregnancy this time. My first 4 children were all induced and my last 2 were c-sections. I would suggest not lifting the heavy boxes if you can get someone else to help you out. And definitely don't climb up the ladders after about 7 months along, your balance is probably not the best by then.<br>  I just suggest you just work until you become very uncomfortable.|`|7bdhpvc9aa	Your boss should know that you are pregnant and you should not be required to lift anything heavy or climb any ladders. You need to tell yoru boss you need to be switched immediately to do something else b/c this puts you and your baby at risk for many dangers. <br>  <br>  Personally, I worked up until I had my son. He was born at 37 weeks. I had a desk job and was able to get up and walk around whenever I needed. <br>  <br>  Good Luck & God Bless|`|DcLiW4bbaa	I worked the night my water broke. I got off work at 11pm, and at 3am it broke.<br>  <br>  I only got 6 weeks off paid so I wanted all of it to spend with my baby girl. :)<br>  <br>  I could have got 12 weeks all together using FMLA, but the other 6 weeks would have been unpaid and I just couldn't get away with that.<br>  <br>  I think it all just really depends on you, how you're pregnancy is going, what your jobs policies are and when your doctor recommends it.|`|RJ8Jf73Vaa	I'm going to stop 2 weeks before my due date. I work at a doggy daycare and do stand a lot but as I have gotten farther along my duties have changed a lot! I have also cut my hours back so I'm only working 35 hrs a week now. I am now almost 31 weeks along and definitely tire a lot faster! Good luck and congrats!|`|O0PfwDJeaa	I'm an early-childhood special ed teacher, which involves dealing with children with behavior issues (think kicking, biting, yanking, etc as I try to work with them), as well as squatting down on the ground, crawling on the floor, running, and being on my feet all day!<br>  <br>  I worked until a Thursday (Friday happened to be a no-school day) and went into labor that weekend.<br>  <br>  Honestly, it was fine.  I had no problems continuing to work and it kept me busy.   <br>  <br>  My doctor commented that the baby was engaged very early (+1 station at 35 weeks) and she said it was probably due to all the movement I did at work.  With the baby being down so low, it actually made for a quicker, easier labor too!|`|chmuDZObaa	One week before my due date is when I am actually stopping.  I've really cut back on my hours in the last 2 months though.   I'm just too big and uncomfortable to be walking up and down stairs and working.  Luckily, all of my maternity leave is paid so it's not a financial thing to work until the end for me.|`|T86QElehaa	Its probably best to work as much as you can, it helps with money situations and is said to help with labor. The first three months are the most crucial and you should not lift anything that is remotely heavy! You could really hurt the baby, so be careful!|`|VmbuTJvHaa	I'm 23 weeks and still working (waitressing) although i have cut back shifts.|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	I'm stopping at 36 weeks at my OB's recommendation. I'm a Massage Therapist, so I am on my feet all day doing physical work. I have a heart condition that makes me tire very easily and have difficulty breathing, otherwise I would probably work up until the very end. Good luck to you!|`|AA10186411	I worked until my doctor made me stop because of severe leg swelling, and that was at 38 weeks.  Its smart to work up until you deliver, so you can use all your time off for when the baby is here.
CdJtH0xdaa	You're fourteen; do you really need a boyfriend, or is it just an excuse to get into a sexual relationship? You can't just jump into a relationship when you think you're ready for one. That's one thing I don't understand. If you MUST have a boyfriend, you should show you're parents that you are responsible by doing small chores around the house.|`|yV8fog7Paa	14 year olds do not need boyfriends.|`|JpmKtpqmaa	Not trying to sound like your mom, but you really dont need a boyfriend... and thats why they wont let you have a boyfriend...You really dnt need one....|`|sMuMfuAgaa	I went down that path and its not easy, but after a while I'm sure you'll find your parents are right on their opinions.  All my parents ever told me was that I was too young and they didn't want me in any serious relationships when I don't need to be.  I was 14 then and now I'm almost 15 and I completely understand what they mean.  We have our whole lives ahead of us, and me personally, I wouldn't want to just get caught up in having a boyfriend A) for the sake of having a boyfriend and B) when I don't need one.  There's plenty of time for them in a few years.  But if you want a boyfriend, maybe find one that your parents actually like and trust.  If guys always want to get sexual with you I can definately understand where your parents are coming from.|`|lQaeb2wNaa	Try talking calmly to them (make sure it's a good time to talk). Tell your parents that you think you're ready to have a boyfriend and that you're sure you can handle it and tell them why. Try not to sound frustrated or whiny. They're probably just worried that those boys will hurt, so let them talk too and listen to what they have to say. Ask them if there's a way you can prove you're responsible enough.<br>  <br>  Best of luck!<br>  <br>  EDIT: Wow. Three thumbs down for answering her question.

Its not too early for a test as you were suppose to have a period on the 19th and didnt so its 2 weeks late, take a test!!|`|JDQ3dJPkaa	an early pregnancy test should be able to detect the changes by now, or within the week coming. you should try again. and know that the OTC tests can also not be accurate. you will still need to visit a physician for a blood test at some point, if you still don't get your period.<br>  <br>  but my biggest stress to you is to be careful! your life is not worth a few minutes of fun. please, please use protection. if you're not ready for kids, or even just to keep your own health, you need to be able to use condoms (at a minimum) to keep bad things from happening to you.<br>  <br>  good luck, hon.|`|q54JJx5haa	Have your breast become large and tender? Any nausea or vomiting? Excessive tiredness? Those are other things that could tip you off to being pregnant. I'd wait another 2 weeks and take the test again. In the meantime: no smoking or drinking!<br>  <br>  My period was irregular until I was about 24 (sometimes they were heavy and lasted 6 days and some days they were light and lasted only 2), so it could just be your body growing and regulating, too.|`|5VgUE6ATaa	i would say take a test.its not to early to tell.also you should use protection you never know what your going to catch.|`|YWAoSctPaa	If you spotted you may have had a miscarraige
dd8cb229ee241de8ca385f84ec4b33d7aa	I think the only two people that should love the name are you and the father<br>  <br>  Unless the other mother told you months ago, what name she is planning, then go for it<br>  <br>  My daughter has a girl on my block her age with the same day<br>  It's happen<br>  My niece has five friends name Emily, and she is sixth<br>  <br>  I would name the child the name you like|`|AA11138222	If you don't really know her, I highly doubt that she will care what you named your baby. She's not a member of your family, so I wouldn't worry about what she thinks. If you like the name, go for it!|`|Elxuvon8aa	f it is a common name I would go ahead  surley change the middle name  If you have another name you like choose it as the kids will be in the same school at the same time|`|OYy82bAYaa	She may get a bit offended so it might pay to ask first it would bother me.. However i would probably go with the name that suits the child and one you like the most.|`|bIaywrBCaa	name the baby what you want. Doesn't matter what the other mother thinks.|`|H9Nvo2gxaa	Is it a common name like Alex or Josh? If it is I wouldn't mind. <br>  <br>  If it is a unique name then maybe|`|Dd9Lc3tDaa	I am the product of that situation!! Before I was born, my parents loved Olivia Anne, but three weeks before I was born an acquaintance named their baby that, exactly, and my parents felt weird about it (Like it was a "sign") that they named me Rachel Anne instead!! If you know that you or the other couple won't feel weird about it, then go ahead! If not, exchange either the first or middle name, or add a first name, and have two middle names.|`|TNytY4XBaa	If you choose to use the same name talk to her about it say that's the name i had picked out  and since we go to the same church and in the same neighborhood i was wondering if it would offend you. We had a situation a few times in our family alone and everyone said you name you child as you see fit or want to and don't worry about other people and there opinions.|`|HvXzS9acaa	It would bother me personally, but only because the names I plan on naming my children, I've never once heard used before. If you really like the same name go for it! No one person has the right to any particular name, unless they made the name up and the right might not last long, as others who meet that child may fall in love with that new name. Congrats and good luck!|`|AIKwPyepaa	ughh.. what a hoochie stealing ur name... my sister did that.. i was going to name my son connor allyn and she stole it her son was born like 2months before mine and i just didnt want the same name cuz i wanted him to be unique.. so i named him tucker achilles and it really suits him lol.. im sure itll be alright but if you have 2 different names they will never have the mix up of someone saying ashley and there will be 7ashleys say what???|`|Vi5SCyr9aa	You should name your baby what you want to name him.  If they are mad or upset you just explain that you have had that name in mind for a long time and didn't see why you should have to change it just because someone else used the name.|`|X77Kzh7baa	thats a weird thing...<br>  <br>  i wouldn't mind much if it was taken...it would just bug me that the name was too common....<br>  <br>  <br>  but if you're going to meet the child and parents often then you might wanna change the name but if you're totally in love with the name it's fine..|`|V8JoRHnnaa	personally i am in same situation and i decided to keep different name, i dont want it to be common.|`|DP48dIxhaa	I would use the other name..you don't want her 2 think u stole her name from her|`|25bf37e0a92ccb8a258d3686a5324e72aa	It wouldn't bother me, you already picked the name out but it would be confusing to the children to grow up together with the same name. I have a common name (Shannon) and I am actually considering changing it because my fiance's SIL is named Shannon and when we are married we will have the same name so I think personally I would choose another name if they are going to be going to the same school, same classes, same church etc. I grew up with at least one to three Shannon's in the same classes with me and I hated it so keep that in mind. I would choose the first name different if you were going to keep one name that is the same use it for the middle name.|`|VLlG0deMaa	I would pick a different name. I was in the same situation with my daughter (she's two now). her name is Naomi, which was going to be Isabella, but that is my neice's name (her cousin).
WXExyAlWaa	Sit down with him and make him agree to set terms. Give him hours during which he can visit, agree on an amount for financial aid, etc. You don't have to bring the courts into it unless you really can't agree or he ignores your rules. You need to be able to keep to your own schedule yourself, as in when to feed the baby or give her a nap etc, without worrying about him waltzing in whenever he likes and you having to put things on hold because he wants to be with her right then.|`|dd8cb229ee241de8ca385f84ec4b33d7aa	A lot of people will not like my answer<br>  <br>  Here it's goes<br>  <br>  Your daughter relationship with her father needs to be kept<br>  If parents can put aside the hurt about the break up and work in the best interest of the child it's always best<br>  <br>  My husband died, when my daughter was two<br>  I have met several children from single and only parents home<br>  Only parent, are people like me, that are raising their child by their self. <br>  <br>  Single parents are two parents raising their child together, even if they are not.

Try to at least be grateful he's being a good Dad.<br>  <br>  <br>  edit: somehow I flew right by 'leaves in the morning' -- no, he really shouldn't be spending the night. Spending time with his daughter, yes. But if he dumped you he needs to move on and find his own place.|`|TQ47vny4aa	He is not being a father by no means. He is not there thru the hard times like you are with all the feedings and diaper changes. Kick him to to curb. I would tell him either be a man and stay with our little family or you take him to court and get child support and full custody of the baby.<br>  Gee sure glad there is a thumbs down troll around tonight.|`|JsqMSU9Haa	I don't think he should be spending the night with you - where does he sleep?  if he wants nothing to do with you, he should come visit his daughter at scheduled times and then go home.  youre making it very easy for him to have you, his child and any other women he wants|`|AA10186411	You need to take him to court.  You will get child support, and a set visitation.  During these visits you don't have to see him, which for right now is probably best until you can get over him.|`|5UpTGrFZaa	i'll be honest. i dont really have an answer for this question, but as a daughter whos been in  a similar situation, i will say that either fully include him or leave him out. It will be hard for your daughter to go through life having visits with dad and all of the other emotional components. in the future it can make her life hectic, in my experience(which wasnt exactly the same but similar) this kind of life style cause me to have eating problems and serious emotional issues.|`|lqSvEgXjaa	you need to get things straight take him to court and let the juge do what they  do best take actions on some one that doesnt seem to see whats going on and tell him what your going to so he agreed ok he doesnt he cant do much about it or he should change his ways thats pretty much the apotion he has
68c6B8dRaa	Newborns just freak out about pooping. It involves a bizarre bit of muscle use -- tense this, loosen that, then whoosh! -- quite weird if you've never pooed before. <br>  <br>  What you eat doesn't go directly to your milk -- more useful info on that here: <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/nutrition/mom/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/nutrition/mom/in...</a>|`|V8wUAVdyaa	avoid broccoli and anything with citric acid ( orange juice, oranges.. several juices have it so check the labels), tomatoes and tomato sauces.<br>  Mine had the same problem and my pediatrician told me to avoid these and he has been doing better since.|`|X83LVP6Iaa	I was reading that things like garlic, broccli, cauliflower, and acidic foods such as oranges, lemons, grapefruits, etc. can upset a baby's tummy. Breastfed babies have a "sour" smelling poop anyway so I wouldn't worry about that. As far as him crying when he poops, he is probably letting you know he wants to be changed. If his rear end is bleeding, then that would be a different story. If you are still concerened, your doctor/peditrician gets paid to answer your questions. Give em a call.|`|vb5oY7O6aa	he can not have constipation on breast milk. infants on breast feeding can pass any color of stools even 10 times a day if they are normal otherwise, there is nothing to wory about.. straining alot is ok but if he is crying evertime he passes stool you should see a doctor. does he have a nappy rash that migh be irritating him when he poops....?|`|qImMwhUHaa	I've never experienced anything like that before. Maybe it's from citrus or maybe he has an allergy to something you are consuming. I would keep track of everything you eat and drink and try to determine what could be causing the problem.|`|iQcd37Goaa	have youtalked to your doctor??you should!
UbCzA2JVaa	I love them! I will put them in my order of preference and then comment on them.<br>  <br>  Noah Lennox- This is so cute! I love Noah and it's nice because Noah is so common and Lennox isn't, so they even each other out.<br>  Landon Hart- This is a nice name that will age well!<br>  Jude Dawson- I like both of these names, but I don't like how they sound together. I think it's because it goes juDE Dawson. Maybe Jude Lawson?<br>  Braxton Avery- It is an alright name, but it just reminds me of Braxton Hicks contractions.<br>  Jackson Ryder (Jack)- I love Ryder, but I don't really like Jackson. Ryder Jackson would be nicer.<br>  <br>  <br>  Ava Manelle- This is gorgeous, I love the name Ava and it's nice that Manelle honours your grandmother. <br>  Peyton Rose- I love Peyton and because it's a bit masculine, Rose softens it and makes it sound beautiful.<br>  Isabella Breanne (Bella)- Isabella is also a beautiful name, but I do prefer Isabelle.<br>  Shiloh Olivia- This is really cute.<br>  Aubrie Sophia (Brie)- This is also really nice, but I guess I had to put one of them at the bottom!<br>  <br>  <br>  :)|`|p2pE0Fpwaa	Isabella Breanne (Bella) or Ava Manelle * for a girl .

Just keep that in mind and i hope it helps.best of luck!|`|1k6UUC8qaa	well let me tell you enjoy every minute of your pregnancy.  Its a very special time in your life all the moving, the guessing which part of the body the baby is pushing against your skin in your tummy. look forward to your baby shower, buy things for your baby also rub your belly you will miss that baby inside you believe me.  Bond with him call him by his name when you talk about him.  Your body will get back to normal don't worry about that try not to be so anxious its not good for the baby.  enjoy your pregnancy its great.|`|Yr65nHRkaa	I wish there was something I could say, but I'm about 37 weeks and time never passes any faster.<br>  <br>  Good luck, honey.

Although im anxious to meet my daughter to.  But they have to grow so they can be healthy when they are born.  That's what I keep reminding myself.  I was admitted in the hospital at 29 weeks because of preterm labor and I wanted to just go ahead and have her but she may have not even survived then.  So your baby will come soon enough.  Just be patient you don't him here that early. :)|`|sMvWJDqsaa	when in doubt, eat chocolate! some days this is the only thing to get me through...I am 19 weeks 4 days and I know how you feel about wanting it to be done already...but this too shall pass..and then we will have a lifetime of ups and downs to contend with!!!|`|ejPPUm4maa	OMG! LOL I felt the same way and just wanted to meet my son who was born on May 16th 2008!

Congratulations! xoxo|`|vygYFdsSaa	All I can think of at the moment is *you're more than halfway there*!!!

CdJtH0xdaa	Try to find some pictures of dangerous candies. I found a picture of a Three Musketeers bar that had a razor blade in it, found by a fifteen-year-old after trick-or-treating. Here is the story, including the picture (which is a bit obscure):<br>  <a href="http://www.cfnews13.com/News/Local/2007/11/1/razor_blade_found_in_halloween_candy.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cfnews13.com/News/Local/2007/...</a>|`|ud0gPY3baa	Thats a cute slogan. I would of never thought of it. ( :<br>  Maybe for a picture you put like a cute little monster <br>  or animated candy that has kind of an evil look to it.<br>  Or you can get a picture of two pieces of candy and one has a tampered wrapper with an unhappy face, and the other piece has a perfect wrapper and has a smiley face with a thumbs up or something like that.<br>  <br>  Well I'm all out of ideas now : (<br>  <br>  Hope I helped! (;|`|RUuQ3syDaa	i think the slogan is really good. if you were creative enough to do that then there must be something! maybe a scary pumpkin...??? like one with a creepy face? or just pictures of halloween candy or and xray.<br>  <br>  yeeahh sorry not very creative am i?|`|5b5e3b4f114d52c05fdb151a2f5b2317aa	Since this picture is for kids, I wouldn't do anything too complicated. You may even want to show 2 pieces of candy, one that looks tampered, and one that is normal. The tampered one should have the red circle with the line through it.<br>  I think the slogan is good, it's catchy, and very appropriate for the holiday!<br>  Good luck with your flyer! I think it's great you're looking out for the kids and parents who don't think to check the candy!|`|Wa0pHJwMaa	For me I think that this is a very creative and good way of putting out this message to kids. GOOD JOB! A marketing way of showing it might be to show candy that hasn't been tampered with or have the wrappers opened and have pics of some that have been. Maybe include some info about how parents can help during this celebration by checking candy!|`|CdfATc6Kaa	ooh maybe like some kind of creature with the candy lol <br>  something creative. I am a photographer and i have some like that :)<br>  email me at sarahcracker101@aol.com<br>  its amazing and<br>  love the slogan. It fitz so well|`|3dOqAw8Saa	Well it depends, whats your target audience's age? I've been using photoshop for a few years. One thing that makes a good picture is a visually attractive way to get their attention. If its younger kids say from 10-15 or something, maybe you can put a clever pumpkin on a doorstep and a ghoul creeping around. The logo could be in candy corn for instance. Anything else I would be happy to help.|`|xdrBVyCBaa	A clever picture...hmmm..let's see. I actually think you should display examples of the dangerous treats they might give you on the side. But the most significant photo should be a child in a somewhat scary costume frightened by what's in the bag--which establishes an ironic theme.|`|LyEDHY9Haa	why would kids need to check thier candy??is there something going on which people need know??????????????
ibWLdXlJaa	I had my son at 37 weeks but he was 5.7lbs from growth restriction. He wasn't much smaller than that at 35 weeks. He did have to stay but only because he was jaundiced. Unless he runs into that problem which is pretty likely chances are your baby would be fine and wouldn't require any extra time. That's assuming the baby is otherwise healthy.|`|cQDEjeZ7aa	A girl I know had hers at 35 1/2 weeks and he turned out just fine. No problems, he was just small 5 lbs and some odd oz (i forget) She had him that morning and the next afternoon they went home. He was her 3rd.|`|uGqYoZNEaa	My baby was born at 6.5 pounds and was in hospital for 6 days and left at 5.5 pounds.  She could've left earlier except she got jaundice.  Everything after that was completely 100% fine.|`|1k6UUC8qaa	the earliest i had one of my kids is 38 weeks he weight 7lbs 1 oz and was 20 inches
NePgB9b2aa	Wow, you have very lovely taste.<br>  <br>  Annabelle Claire, Mary Claire Anneliese, Evelyn Aurora & Audrey are my absolute favorites. They're flawless! <br>  <br>  I'm not a big fan of Camille but there's nothing wrong with it, and it goes nicely with Audrey. Caroline Lily is also adorable. The rest are all nice as well- you don't have a single bad name on there.|`|Qe9y6MnTaa	Ok, Audrey Camille and Caroline Lilly are my favorite :D So cute. The rest are eh...none of them are horrible by any means in my opinion I just like the ones above the best. A good nickname for Norah could be:<br>  *Elizabeth<br>  *Teresa<br>  *Marie<br>  *Rose(So adorable)<br>  *Tally<br>  More too. My personaly favorite names are Kailey or Kaylee, Logan(yes, for a girl), and Emma. I hope this helps. Congrats!|`|2TrHH0rkaa	I voted on them and I think that they are all very nice.Here is my opinion of each and middle names for Norah:<br>  <br>  Annabelle Claire-Annabelle is a great classic and Claire complements it beautifully. Have you considered Annabella? 8/10<br>  Caroline Lily-I love the name Lily and Caroline is nice as well. What about Lily Nicholle? 7.5/10<br>  Evelyn Aurora-I love the name Evelyn and the nickname Eve. Aurora however isn't really my taste.

6ri7AYC1aa	Excercising during prenancy is actually good.<br>  I'm not sure about ab work outs. I guess it depends on the work out and how intense it is. <br>  But swimming is a very good work out for pregnant women.<br>  But I think you should talk to your doctor and maybe even your coach.|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	You should be okay for awhile, but it's best to let your coach know what is going on.

0109acb46cde8d1611e69faeb732145aaa	I'm not the best to answer this because I had to be induced but I know the feeling.  I didn't feel any different my entire pregnancy.  The only difference that got me was the fact I couldn't sleep on my stomach.  Ha ha.<br>  <br>  I didn't even really notice a difference when my son flipped.  My doctor told me my son was breech and I was worried, because I had a bulge in the front when I laid down, thinking it was his head.  But from the doctor's office to home that night, he had already flipped over.  <br>  <br>  Sorry if I didn't really answer your question.  Hope your delivery goes smooth.  :]|`|yvt0IbqJaa	I started feeling different a few weeks before both of my deliveries.

7rCeCVl2aa	Have you considered taking him to a urologist to get a 2nd opinion?|`|VmSKQ40Caa	This is why you don't circumcise your children. I don't know what you're to do. All I can say is if you have another son, don't let some sick in the head doctor cut his unit.|`|pzLDXL6gaa	That's why circumcision is a bad idea. How would getting him circumcised again help? It would just seriously damage his penis, would pull the skin too tight and just cause more pain. It's probably just an infection and with the antibiotics should get better. Circumcision does cause infections you know and doesn't prevent them. If it doesn't get better after the antibiotics it's time for the doctor to investigate more.<br>  <br>  Harriet
QIFyTB3maa	i totally agree. people should think about meanings of names before they name their children. Good Point to bring up. :)|`|tEaBXqubaa	I wouldn't name any thing "Toilette" not even my dog.

That's a girls name, just because it ends in "SON" doesn't mean that you have to use it on a boy. <br>  I agree with you, people need to think about what there naming there kids now days, and when they get older how they and there name will be viewed!|`|0109acb46cde8d1611e69faeb732145aaa	NO<br>  <br>  Latrina makes me think of the toilet.

That being said, with my first I had a lot of BH with pelvic pressure, gas, and diarrhea.  Within a week I was ready.  I went over actually by 4 days.<br>  <br>  With my second baby I went early and didn't have any of these symptoms. Never even lost my mucus plug.|`|ZFjglUHXaa	I had them one night and went to bed on them....the next night could not sleep, went to the hospital had twins withing 45 min of leaving my house!
277f88461e1df8f316c52c480977aaa6aa	I started with rice cereal that i bought from the store.  His second food was peas actually and they didn't agree with him, too gassy afterward.  We moved onto carrots, which he absolutely loves.  After that he had squash.  Which is extremely easy to make.  After squash we had green beans, which again made him a little gassy, but he loved them so much we tried again a week later and he was fine.  We started into fruit next, apples first.  he's had pears, plums, prunes, bananas,  peaches, and he even tried and liked avocado.  he loves potatoes, they just don't freeze well.  After all that, we started chicken, which no matter how you cook and puree, will always have a super dry texture and make baby gag so mix it with his veggie when you feed it.  recently we tried peas again and he was fine.  tomorrow we're going to try beef.  the only food i don't make at home is the cereals and applesauce.  i don't make the cereal because they would be a huge pain and not any less expensive prolly.  and the applesauce because it is cheaper to get the applesauce than the apples to make it yourself.  all the food you make can be frozen in ice cube trays or baby food freezer trays. the only difference is the baby food freezer trays have lids.  i steam the veggies and most of the fruit.  the squash i cut in half, gut and put cut side down in a cake pan with about 1.5 inches of water at 375 for 50 minutes. i do the same for the peaches and plums.  after they're done i flip over and spoon the "meat" out of the fruit into the food processor and hit puree.  you may need to add a little water to it, you can use the water it was cooked in.  same as when you steam veggies, just not with carrots since the nitrates seep into the water.  for prunes you can buy them in the store and soak them in warm water for about 10-15 minutes then put them in the processor with a little water, those don't freeze solid, but enough to get them out of the tray and into ziplocks.  the reason i cook most of his food it that, one the baby food in stores is more expensive, and two i know exactly what's going into the food i'm making him.  you can get applesause in the big jars at thestore, just make sure it's the natural stuff. (just apples, water and ascorbic acid)  ascorbic acid is just vitamin c.  the applesauce can be frozen as well.  i think i got it all, lol.  if not you can e-mail me at horsin1787@hotmail.com  good luck!<br>  <br>  also about the prunes, they're awsome to have on hand in case of constipation from all the new solid food!  would save you some time from an uncomfortable baby.|`|ZSSUfSXwaa	Yes you start with veggies first.. usually strained carrots, peas, and cereal rice to begin with.<br>  <br>  You start with one food at a time, then once you see that it settles well you introduce the next one. I made my babies' food myself, thought it was better than the store.<br>  As for Stage 1 foods, make sure the texture is almost soup like.  Start|`|p403V6VWaa	I buy the organic gerber foods. The first food I ever fed my son was rice cereal, but he hated it so I let him try sweet potatoes and we have been working our way through all the veggies. Tomorrow is carrots, and then he has conquered all his veggies with no allergies. I agree that veggies should be started first. Would you want to eat a veggie if someone had already introduced you to a sweet fruit? My son loves all his veggies so far, so I'm pretty sure he's really going to love fruit. Congrats on baby and you can start feeding him solids a little early if he's showing signs of being ready. I started feeding him almost a couple of weeks ago and he will be six months on March 9th. My son's Pediatrician told me that if your child has at least doubled his/her birth weight, sits with support, and acts interested in food then he/she is more than likely ready. It's going to be so fun when your child starts eating solids. The faces that babies make when trying different tastes for the first time is priceless. Make sure you have your camera ready!|`|VHs7OPGlaa	I started my son on baby rice cereal then oatmeal then barley then i added apples and bananas then started some veggies and more fruits. Just make sure you only add 1 new thing per week like week one do rice cereal then week two oatmeal etc. so you can determine allergies better. I used baby food from the store but I wanted to do fresh, just didn't have time. I heard the fruit and veggie thing but my son did fine. If you do start with veggies, dint start with sweet potato because they are just as sweet as fruit. Good luck!|`|TQScv7Tcaa	I honestly don't hink it matters as long as you dont JUST feed them fruits or JUST feed then vegies. I started Charleigh out on cereal but she didnt like it so we moved on to things like pumpkin, sweet potato, potato, apple, pears, avocado, carrots, broccolli, creamed corn. She loved them mixed like avocado and apple, potato and creamed corn, apple and pears. I made all my own foods except apple i used to just buy apple sauce, ofcourse you have to remember the one new food every 3 or 4 days rule though to ensure he has no reactions to anything.....good luck and just have fun :)|`|TvYX1yXWaa	i started out with baby rice cereal mixed with stage 1 bananas and sweet potatoes .|`|4Bgw5xs8aa	Cereal as a "first" solid is just a popular American concept. It's not neccessary and honestly has very little nutritious value.<br>  <br>  I would start with pureed veggies. Either store bought stage 1 or, better yet, homemade. You can steam them and add a little of the water you steamed them in or breast milk or formula til it's at a runny consistency(to start off with). <br>  <br>  I would start with yellow or orange veggies. ie: sweet potatoes, carrots, squash, ect.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't start with fruit, because if a baby starts getting fruit, they may ONLY want fruit instead of veggies since it's so sweet. Also, only do 1 new food for a few days and watch for signs of allergies. If baby is digesting that food well and takes to solids well, add another to the diet.|`|YP1DXbBDaa	Avocado is what my daughter's pediatrician and our lactation consultant recommend.   <br>  <br>  We don't do purees or cereals though, we do Baby Led Weaning, which means allowing the baby to feed him or her self baby safe pieces of food from the beginning when he or she is introduced to solids.  If you want to go that route, cut avocado into chunks that the baby can pick up and put into his or her mouth.  Otherwise you can simply mash some avocado with a fork and offer it on a spoon.<br>  <br>  If you do want to use pureed food or cereal, check out wholesomebabyfood.com for ideas.|`|E2XbFVBQaa	I started my baby on Cereal then went on to pureed fresh veggies then to the fruits. I always made my own baby food because the store bought stuff Smelled and tasted Disgusting. Yes I tasted it. I figured if I wouldn't eat it then my child didn't need to eat it. The bananas didn't even remotely taste like bananas. I highly recommend to make your own. puree it then put it in ice cube trays to freeze once frozen you can transfer it to freezer bags or containers. It is so easy that way and very convenient|`|gW3k9Eyhaa	Fresh veggies is great, just make sure you steam them nice and soft then puree them. If you end up using fruit and your bubs gets fussy about veggies then just add pear to the veggies and he/she will love it. Pumpkin, sweet potato, banana, pear, apple, carrot, avacados. Just make sure you introduce foods one at a time just in case of allergic reactions.Then you'll be able to keep track of what caused it if it ever happens. Good luck :)|`|z0Ac06claa	I started my son on baby single grain cereal first. After about a week and half started veggies.<br>  <br>  We did sweet potatoes, squash, carrots, green beans and then peas. We did each for about 3-4 days then moved on. We are still doing veggies and soon plan to start Fruits. Same deal a new fruit every 3-5 days. <br>  <br>  It is very cute to see them eat new foods and make new faces. Good luck.|`|uGqYoZNEaa	I 100% agree with Piper's Mommy.  I was gonna write something similar.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|LkdPXNaCaa	MY daughter showed interest early on in regards to starting solids. I started her at about 4 and 1/2 months. She did great. I decided to start her out with peaches. She absolutely loved them. I fed them to her for five days and than moved on. I gave her two sweet foods first before starting her on sweet potatoes. She loved everything that I gave her and had no problem swallowing. Each baby is different. So start out with whatever you think is the best first time food. If your little one doesnt like it, take a week and try agian. If your baby has troubles with eating or just shows no interest in eating anything besides milk, wait. I just buy her baby food from the store, it has what she needs and has a lot of different varieties. I have a friend who decided to make his own food for his son and he told me that that lasted maybe four months. It's time consuming, messy and gets expensive. Just take your time. If your little one shows interest in things that you eat than try it out. buy a jar of baby food for experimenting. If she/he loves it..you can decide to start, if he/she isnt into it wait. Good luck and have fun with it.|`|ejPPUm4maa	Of course rice or barley cereal.  If your just starting that I think only that for a couple days and then add stage 1 bananas ask your baby's Dr to feel better for yourself! :)|`|786fd6feb77011e060f5955437a24ac9aa	ok here is a book that helped me no end, and I am going to use again.

vygYFdsSaa	Actually the things you are describing about your boobs happened to me. It sounds to me as if you are pregnant. Take a urine test before you go to the doctors and then if it is negative you can ask for a blood test. Usually they'll want to give you a urine test first and then go for a blood test only after you test neg on the urine. Good luck sweets|`|xhT8bJeHaa	First if your nipples are bigger than usual and the circle around them are a bit darker then you probable are when you do go to the doctor just ask he won't say anything he'll know.
CdJtH0xdaa	Okay. This is my theory about whether or not you are ready to have sex:<br>  1. Are you ready to give birth to a baby?<br>  2. Are you ready to deal responsibly with a baby, whether you keep the child or put him/her up for adoption?<br>  3. Are you in a strong relationship?<br>  If you answered "No" to any of these questions, you are not ready to have sex.<br>  Condoms and birth control do have a chance of failing, and whenever you have sexual intercourse, you are taking that chance. If you are not ready to deal with that chance, then you are NOT ready to have sexual intercourse.|`|Av9jeRAkaa	no, wait a bit longer, trust me the guy your with now, won't be the same guy you marry, so save it..<br>  <br>  :)<br>  <br>  but it's your choice,so choose wisely...|`|Osn1xpu6aa	It's completely your decision.<br>  If you feel like he is the special person for it, then do it.<br>  But remember you can only really give one virginity away.|`|af2136bcacd19dc5b2bab9b0737163c9aa	No don't do it hun! it's not worth it no matter how much you like him at that age, he might just get that and then stop talking to you. it all just depends on you do what you think is right but if he stops talking to you after that that's all on you. If you say he lives in another town you might get really attached to him after that and might scare him off also a million and one things happen after having sex with a guy for the first time. good luck though|`|cQDEjeZ7aa	Well its all up to you, but let me tell you.....I lost mine when I was 17 and I regret it.

O0PfwDJeaa	Many things can delay ovulation, so YES it is possible!   If you were stressed, ill, even traveling could have caused a delay in ovulation.  Trust your doctor on this one ;)|`|1eZyroqdaa	Sept 6th seems a little late to have ovulated, even a late ovulation still would have meant you ovulated on or around the end of August. I guess if you ovulated late and then the sperm took a while to meet with the egg anything is possible but still seems unlikey to me.
TvYX1yXWaa	i didn't smell any thing or feel anything .. i was numb for my breast down.. i was really scared and nervous but it wasn't bad at all and it didn't take very long.. i had my boyfriend in there and he was talking to me the who time.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Believe me you are so nervous, excited, and drugged up that you dont' really think about that.|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	My friend just had a C-section and I asked her what it felt like. She told me you could feel a lot of pulling and pushing but it was not painful. Then she said "It's like a team of people is trying to wrestle a pair of size zero jeans onto your size ten body." I don't know about the other sensations though.<br>  <br>  Good luck with everything! :]|`|q7sgWqZ3aa	My c-section wasn't scheduled, not really. I went to the ER for excessive vaginal bleeding(my placenta started to detach itself). I went in about 7pm Sunday, Feb. 22nd. Not long after that my OB was called and he sent me to a better hospital just in case they had to do a c-section. Monday at 3:42 am my girl was delivered. <br>  <br>  <br>  I didn't get to see much. They have a blue shield thing over you, so you wont see what they are doing. Honestly I don't remember anything bout smelling anything... I did feel tugs and pulls but they were painless.|`|AA11234162	I had a lot of pressure in my shoulders from all of the tugging, but that is all I really felt.  My baby girl was lodged in my pelvis, so I imagine that is why I felt so much tugging...|`|43a27c0e1eef30eef2164c4c15242ab3aa	All I felt was some pressure when pushing and pulling her out, that's all.  I heard monitors and such nothing scary.|`|Bi7i3JIEaa	I had a c-section in 07. I was very tired from being in labor that I went to sleep but not a deep sleep, I could hear everyone in the room talking, I remember the surgeon and my husband talking about how loud I was snoring. As they were taking my son out I just felt a lot of pressure but it didn't hurt at all, you have oxygen on so you won't really smell anything, and finally the only thing you'll see is the person standing next to you and what's on your side of the curtain that is until they hold the baby up for you to see. Which I missed because I was sleep. LOL|`|3Fq0HaIAaa	Unless there's a reason to knock you out you're completely awake and aware during a c-section.|`|hcwp2mAyaa	I had an elective c-section in Sep '08. My daughter was breach. I was more worried about the epidural! But seriously all you can feel is a lot of pushing and pulling. You don't feel them cutting you. Its pretty much like another answerer said "Like having a size 0 pair of jeans when your  a size 10". You sound alot like me, when I found out i would need a cesar, wanting to know the ins and outs of everything. Lol, you imagine all this stuff, and find out all this information, and what you imagine is 1000's time worse than what it turns out to be like. I can hardly remember what it feels like, but id def go for another, after the stories i have heard about natural birth.
fzjePK5Haa	You should consider calling your doctor to get blood testing. It will probably give you a better idea than a pregnancy test. Are you experiencing any other symptoms of pregnancy? Here's a link to a site that explains what to look for. Some early signs of pregnancy show up as early as a few days after conception. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_4670544_recognize-pregnancy-symptoms.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/how_4670544_recogniz...</a>|`|qtA5oCeAaa	you very well could be with a negative test go back to the doctor in a couple of weeks and get another blood test|`|WZQKevt8aa	It does sound like you are pregnant. Some women (very rarely, but it does happen) can do as many pregnancy tests and blood tests as they like and it will come up negative and when they have an ultrasound it shows they are pregnant. I would ask for an ultrasound. Also, yes women can still get spotting or their period when they are pregnant.|`|IGpCJ3NTaa	My neighbor had the same exact symptoms and she got really sick and was hospitalized. Then the diagnosed her with M.S. You might want to get tested for it.

kjgonYlgaa	It will vary from woman to woman and baby to baby.  With my first I had to avoid dairy, she would get very loose blood tinged stools.  My second, I haven't needed to avoid anything but I don't consume alot of alcohol or caffeine.  You will use up about 450 - 700 calories with the production of breast milk, so you can adjust your diet accordingly.|`|ZncV5gc0aa	2500 like in pregnancy. 2000 for you, 500 for milk.|`|Gsfp1tEEaa	For good healthy milk you should consume 1800-2200 calories daily, consuming less than 1500-1800 will put your milk supply at risk. As for the foods just eat healthy, don't believe rumors about gassy or spicy foods they have no more potential to hurt your child than any other food.|`|uGqYoZNEaa	Eat 500 calories more than you normally do.  If you're trying to maintain weight you should aim for 1600+500 for breastmilk.  Depending on how long ago you delivered, and if you're tryingto lose weight then you can even go down to 1500+500 for milk.<br>  <br>  Get good protein, lots of liquid 8-10 8 oz glasses of water or juice.  Stay away from caffeine.  I find just eating really good sized portions 5 times a day keeps my milk up.  It is hard sometimes with the day to days but making a menu and having leftovers really helps.|`|bd199fe076f9ab0bc8b166f15319e147aa	considering you burn about 500 just from nursing a day, and probably a bit more walking around a lot taking care of a baby i'd say 800 more calories than you already are. <br>  <br>  of course avoid alcohol, and maybe spicy foods.|`|mhESzXsraa	<a href="http://inthisget.pablocostas.com.ar" rel="nofollow">http://inthisget.pablocostas.com.ar</a><br>  it<br>  A very informative website you can also get much information in websi

S4DNQkFraa	I'm so sorry for your loss. All you can do is wait to see if you get your period. If you do, then great and if you don't, then great. I understand why you're scared and excited at the same time. I was the same way. I too had a miscarriage and now I'm pregnant again. Everything seems to be going well. Everything happens for a reason and some things fall apart, so better things can fall together. I wish you luck, God bless!

Don't worry!|`|C8JKsvdmaa	if you have no other symptoms ie cramping then believe your dr, bleeding is very common in the first trimester however if it continues throughout pregnancy you need to get checked out each time. if you get worried or have any other symptoms see your dr or midwife.
i6Mi8uWIaa	I really don't believe that you were pregnant, and here's why.<br>  <br>  As a woman, you're actually only fertile for about five days every cycle. This is based on a 24-hour life-expectancy for the egg and only a five-day life-span, at most, for sperm. <br>  <br>  While there are slim possibilities of becoming pregnant while on your period, and slim possibilities of having your period while you're pregnant, considering the length of the period you've had, nearly three weeks, I would guess you are not. The fact is, you can get pregnant from having intercourse while on your period if you hapen to ovulate within the next five days, but you cannot get pregnant during youer period because the hormones that cause ovulation are completely opposte during menstration. <br>  <br>  With this in mind, you might go ahead and take the test just to be sure. <br>  <br>  However, at the same time, you mentioned that you are sixteen. Because you are still in your teens and probably haven't been having your periods more than two or three years, you are naturally going to have irregular periods. <br>  <br>  At the same time, such a long period could also indicate a hormonal imbalance. You are probably going to be a little anemic. If you're feeling unusually tired, I would suggest taking some iron pills. That helps me a lot during my periods, especially when they get going really long. <br>  <br>  There are also a couple of really great books by Toni Weschler that can help you out. One is called Cycle Savvy, and it is aimed specifically at teens and written specifically for your age group. It can tell you everything you need to know, stuff that your doctor probably won't even know.<br>  <br>  The other is called Taking Charge of Your Fertility, which explains what Cycle Savvy does in greater detail and goes into various birth control methods and such. <br>  <br>  In the future, you might start charting your cycles. You can do this by keeping an eye on your basal body temperature, which you take every morning as soon as you wake up, and your natural cervical fluids. You're generally safe when you're dry or sticky, and you're at your most fertile when you have cervical fluids that are of the consistency of raw egg whites, i.e., clear and stretchy. By monitoring both, you can notice not only when you're fertile, but also when you ovulate by noting a temperature shift. About 24 hours after the temperature shift, you're no longer fertile because the egg is dead and gone. <br>  <br>  You'll get to know your own body a lot better by charting, and you'll be a lot less stressed. This is because you'll know what is normal for you, and by knowing when you're ovulating, when you're having intercourse in relation to ovulation, and whether or not your cervical fluid is fertile quality. It also helps you to know when to realize that the late period is just late and not a sign of pregnancy. <br>  <br>  Sorry for the sudden dump of information, but I really do hope that it helps, and that your anxieties are quickly gone.|`|oyvRHQmaaa	If you're having your period, (not just spotting or whatever) then you are not pregnant....20 days is a long time though, if it hasn't done this before you might want to get checked out.....|`|ejPPUm4maa	I don't think so, the eggs die when you have your period and I believe it's 2 weeks after your period that you ovulate! :)|`|vygYFdsSaa	That's too long of a period. See a doctor.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	It's very very rare to have a period and still be pregnant so it's unlikely. Go ahead and take that test in about a week (I would make sure it's at least 14 days after sex to be sure) and test but I doubt it.|`|0kWkX8yiaa	youve had your period for 3 weeks??? wow ... if you think you are pregnant take a test
kaqPSgTVaa	I would ask your doctor about what you should do but you can get fluoride supplements for your children.|`|AA10458750	What is rainwater tank, like well water? Usually, the advice for bad water is takign a calcium supplement daily. About the flouride, you need to ask the dentist.|`|Ms8b2kISaa	I always drank bottled water before, during, and after my pregnancy, but after my son was born, the doctor told me that I should be giving him nursery water, instead of tap or bottled water. I used the nursery water to mix his formula, and when I started giving him plain water. The nursery water is regular water with fluoride added. I never took any extra for myself, even while still pregnant, but now have found out that I should have been! I guess that most states have trace amounts of fluoride in their tap water, but it's only in states like Colorado and Utah (those are just the 2 that I remember), where there is enough in the water to meet a person's needs, especially a baby or toddler's. I still give him water with added fluoride, and he's almost 2. I would definitely ask your doctor, since they would know exactly what to do, based on where you live. Good luck and congrats!!!|`|hOkmcVeDaa	Never heard of a rain water tank what is that? your drinking rain water?
7wVKW3l1aa	Some people have some spotting during ovulation, I have it sometimes. I know how you feel with the periods before I got my d&c because of them I have periods of 3 weeks and was off for a week this went on 3 freakin months!!!! But after the d&c They became fairly normal. You may experience cramping during ovulation in your ovaries But with your cycles how they are I am not sure It could be your period (sorry if it is =/) But if you baby danced on ovulation day it might be a possiblity you are pregnant. Good luck girl and baby dust!!!|`|J3yUXKiyaa	Cramping can indicate ovulation.  You can get it periodically, and not notice anything other times.  Funny, I just answered another similar question like this...it's known as mittelschmerz...<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mittelschmerz." rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mittelschme...</a>  Some cramping (from light to pretty severe) and even spotting can accompany ovulation. <br>  <br>  Your body is getting used to having a regular cycle again, so it's only natural to have some bumps in the road.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you, and I hope you get pregnant soon!  :)|`|opQbQVreaa	It is normal to have cramping at the time of ovulation. I would consult with a dr if you continue to have irregular bleeding.<br>  <br>  As for the cravings, honestly it is probably all in your head. I have never heard of ovulation causing a woman to have cravings. As for your husbands cravings...what can I say...they mostly think about food, or sex so who knows. :)|`|we9sS2tNaa	Wow your situation sounds like mine. I just got the mirena removed Jan 23rd and I finally had a normal period feb 25 and it lasted about 6 days.We're trying for baby # 4.

You shouldn't have another period because it sounds like you finally had a normal one and ovulation does hurt a bit but it's usually on one side you would feel pain like on one of your ovaries...hope this helps.<br>  Good luck!|`|FMmncxToaa	By tracking your ovulation, which for you would be around day 14. Wheyou have an raw egg white consistency, if you feel twinges in your ovary, that means you're about to ovulate.Also, try to relax and enjoy the moment, because if you start doing the deed just for that purpose, it will take you longer, as stress delays ovulation.Good luck and lots of baby dust to you!!!|`|BO28Mn8haa	Aw hun just take it easy. I got what I think was my ovulation today and if that's the case then I had some light cramping.

Uy8ntukjaa	I think this is a valid question and I think its pretty rude to assume that its being asked as an attack on mothers who formula feed their babies. Its a fact that in most countries breastfeeding is the norm. Of course there are medical and personal reasons why women choose not to breastfeed but everyone has the right to choose. If you're confident in your decisions and beliefs, why get defensive when someone asks a question?|`|6fiYhtACaa	I believe Nestle started it as an attempt to fill a very small void in the baby marketback in the 50s. Most women prior to that were breastfeeding just fine except for a small percentage. They gave doctors kickbacks and falsely informed women that it was better for their babies than breastmilk. Sales took off in the 60s and 70s and it's taken the past 20 years or so to undo the damage. Despite recent studies and formula companies claims that "breast is best" the residual cultural image of baby drinking from a bottle has stuck. Some women are still misinformed about the nutritional inadequacies of formula as compared to breastmilk which is not surprising as formula swag bags are still sent home with new babies to this day.|`|Zbn8A7Geaa	First off, some women cannot produce breast milk.  A wet nurse is an option (someone else to breastfeed the child) but it's not something I would want for my kids.    Other women due to work schedules cannot keep to a breast feeding schedule (which can be incredibly constraining for the mother).  In addition there are numerous medical reasons why a woman cannot or shouldn't breastfeed, not to mention some babies have a difficult time "latching on" making breastfeeding difficult.  There are many reasons women opt for formula over breastfeeding, it could be medical or it could be personal.   Breastfeeding or choosing formula should be up to the mother and no mother should be judged because of what she decides to do in that regard.  <br>  <br>  Formula has been around forever by the way, though not always commercially made.   Back in the day, women made their own formula and indeed many still do.|`|4Bgw5xs8aa	How did it first get started? Back in the olden days...like 1600s in Europe...women didn't have formula to feed babies. If their milk never came in and they couldn't afford a wet nurse (another woman who breastfed their baby) they had to use animal's milk...and if the baby wouldn't take that or the mom couldn't get it because she was too poor then they tried something called "pap" which was flour mixed with water...and most babies died like this. <br>  <br>  Formula is a good thing if a dead baby is the alternative, isn't it?<br>  <br>  AND nowadays, there are many reasons a mom might choose to formula feed. Health reasons, she works too much, she can't seem to acheive it, baby isn't gaining weight efficiently on it, PPD, or the mom has a bad aversion to it. <br>  <br>  I CHOSE to formula feed because I truly do NOT like the idea of breastfeeding my child. I know it's psychological, but I just can't get over it. However I don't have a problem with anyone else breastfeeding...even out in public. Their kid..so they get to choose how it's fed. And I don't think it's any of YOUR business how anyone else feeds their kid. Yes, breastmilk is best, but when the alternative is the baby not getting fed with something as nutritious as formula..then formula is a life saver...literally.|`|MeYILJeSaa	I agree with katherine, I don't understand why some people are getting so defensive.<br>  <br>  " In some cases formula is actually better than breast because you actually know how much your baby is getting. Therefore, making feeding schedules easier to maintain instead of going crazy because you're having to breast feed twice as much in one day than you would if your baby had formula instead."<br>  <br>  Umm...what? No.|`|qGw6FSY8aa	Some women have to or prefer to work.<br>  Formula is easier.<br>   It is cheaper to breast feed and it is a know fact it is better for the baby.<br>  <br>  Motherhood and being a housewife seems to be less of a priority than the almighty $$  .|`|dTPg4uYzaa	some people dont produce enough milk to keep their kids full or some cannot produce any at all so the baby will need formula to get nutrients|`|XSol0H6Uaa	I smell a troll, how bout you?|`|MZ5deUKWaa	Seriously, preaching not welcome. I am one of those mother's who wasn't able to breast feed and people who make stupid and unwanted comments about it can make a mother feel like a failure. In some cases formula is actually better than breast because you actually know how much your baby is getting. Therefore, making feeding schedules easier to maintain instead of going crazy because you're having to breast feed twice as much in one day than you would if your baby had formula instead.|`|K6q6YvJWaa	Not all mothers can breast feed and not all newborns can breast feed either.  Formula is a good way to supplement a mothers milk if she can't produce enough or if the baby simply doesn't do well on breast milk.  Some babies need extra iron, some need soy etc.|`|IXBl5l5kaa	Formula was invented in the early 1900's when the revolution of women's rights and "freedom" from the house became a more popular thing. Breastfeeding became a "poor woman's" way of feeding and formula was the new IT. <br>  <br>  A mother chooses formula because she chooses not to breastfeed. It is her choice and we should not condemn it. If it is available, why not. I was formula fed and I'm still in one piece.|`|tkSXjqhuaa	troll.|`|UghJ0XROaa	So many women have to work now. It became the norm when it was advertised years ago as "better than breastmilk" Breastfeeding was only done by poor women. Well since formula blew up, it's never really went back down. So many women work and don't want to hassle with pumping. I know pumping PT and breastfeeding PT makes for hectic days. I pump at every break at work and breastfeed at home. But not all women can do that. <br>  <br>  I believe the formula companies/hospitals push formula. You see so many more advertisements for formula on tv/newspapers/magazine. Then when you go to the hospital to have your baby, they offer you formula, whatever kind pays the hospital to carry it, i guess. Everytime i go to the doc with my daughter, i say i am back to work, they ask, "oh, what kind of formula is she getting". Well none, i pump to feed her breast milk while i am gone.<br>  <br>  Sorry, off on a tangent there, but it's just expected and i think it's pushed more by the companies out for money.|`|6AvVVzsnaa	It depends on the mom's health. If the mom was HIV+, then the baby will have to be feed by formula because the virus can get through the breastmilk and the baby will have it. Or if the baby was put up for adoption.|`|HqOkC2YHaa	Because not all people can breast feed due to certain reasons: medical, not comfortable, they dried up<br>  <br>  take your preaching elsewhere it's not welcome here!|`|u94HOVz7aa	ugh people like you annoy me.  what would happen to all those adopted children?  how about those who's mothers have died?
prqrQcd1aa	I don't know where you live..But where i live.. Child support is based on both the mother and the father's income.. and if the mom's income increases and the fathers income stays the same..and a parent requests a modification.. the father's child support is lowered! Because the mother can provide more support to the child!<br>  <br>  Unless child support is calculated in some funny way were you live, i think pretty much all of america is this way, it is in PA.<br>  <br>  Edit" That is really messed up! I don't understand why that would be honestly. If both parents incomes are to be used in calculating child support then you would think that child support would either get lowered, or raised accordingly.<br>  <br>   In my state they also do guideline deviations where if the mom doesn't work that much or has limited income because she can't work or what ever, they don't make the dad pay the guideline amount, because the mom should be able to provide atleast a certain percentage of income towards the care of the child/ren. I don't know, it may have to do with the "father's rights" thing going on in my state right now.<br>  <br>  For instance, they make shure that the father has a certain amount of living expenses after taxes, etc are taken out before they figure out what the amount is, and if the father or mother doesn't have that amount of living expenses after paying child support, then they will deviate from the guide lines and lower the child support payment. <br>  <br>  They are also giving parents more and more equal custody in my state, even if the mom is breastfeeding, they tell her to pump milk for the visit with the father, or allow formula! It happend to a friend of mine.|`|hmKEHofzaa	child support cases are visited every 3 years unless there is a drastic change like a death or parent signs over rights or something big...so the amount will be based on whatever the wages are at that point it should be 18% for one kid 22% for two 25% for three and 29% for four I think or roughly that..but it should be equal on both sides
AA10953561	Oh yeah, my daughter just turned six and does the same thing. Most often she asks why to things she doesn't want to do (like wearing pajama bottoms) or why she has to eat her veggies. She also asks things she already knows the answer to and after the first three or four times it starts driving me nuts.<br>  <br>  I've resorted to asking her why she thinks it is the way it is. She was trying the whole "I forgot" excuse, but I simply told her to think about it for a while and try to figure it out. I know it sounds harsh, but if it's a question she already knows the answer to then I don't feel the need to answer over and over again. If it's a legit question that she doesn't know the answer to or that she needs a more in depth answer to, I don't mind answering. By asking her what she thinks or telling her to think about it for a while then it encourages her to use her mind and work problems out for herself.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps! Good luck!|`|3HmNEO5Gaa	I think this is every child...<br>  <br>  You could respond with "Why do YOU think?" It gives her the chance to show off her knowledge, and you can discern if she's really asking a question she knows the answer to or not.|`|s8APstrVaa	My daughter is 4 and she sounds exactly like your daughter.  When she asks a question that she knows the answer to I always say I don't know do you know?  Then she will give me the answer.|`|ccccf2dbeb590052b4953d1fbdf1eb20aa	My cousin is just like her.<br>  <br>  But, yea she's just a kid.  She'll soon grow out of it|`|NoFC9rtKaa	Yes-it's called "Driving Mommy Crazy".  I'm afraid most if not all kids go through the questioning phase.  Mine is doing it right now.  I don't know for sure why they ask questions they already know, but I've heard lots of kids do it.  Luckily it is just a phase and will stop at some point.|`|28QPS6V9aa	ha ha that is what kids do. They ask "why this and why that"! Fun huh! It's all part of their mind developing and maturing. I don't know why she does it but that's just how kids are.|`|856df45cd220b8db7117dd899c6e5ae2aa	Five year olds ask questions about everything...usually a million times.  They just want to hear the answer.  Just be sweet and humor her.|`|ybexjS2Paa	Yup my 4 and 1/2 does that too. It seems like he never stops asking. I'd say it's normal at this age. All you can do is keep answering them :)|`|wi6mkT30aa	Cute. It sounds to me she is just being a cutesie kid asking little goofy questions.|`|hHxJ0BONaa	she does that because she is a kid.|`|1YaHn28Yaa	Hi <br>  <br>  My little sister has just started to do this as well so i know what you mean. <br>  <br>  I'm not saying your issue is the exact same as ours but it sounds really similar. <br>  <br>  Mum and dad talked about it dad (who is a doctor) said it's just because she's curious and children tend to ask lots of questions because they like attention and they like company and people to talk to. <br>  <br>  She just loves you and likes to talk to you! <br>  Don't worry!<br>  Love being talked to while you can because soon she'll be 15 and won't talk at all Lol!<br>  <br>  Hope this helped you<br>  xox Della|`|nrqWwQBXaa	she might be doing it just to see what you say. or she is bored and kids will ask any question even if they know the answer to that question?|`|OBn4a7rzaa	Its probably her way of getting attention. I know this is wierd, but i never had a good relationship with my dad, so i couldnt just talk to him about just anything. So when we would get in the car, I would start asking him questions about something i knew that he knew too, that way we could talk and bond, and i would feel closer to him. Im not sure if thats why she is doing it, bc she is alot younger than i was at that time.
tkSXjqhuaa	My 17 month old sister is in a toddler bed, and she's fine. So im sure he should be. And I would suggest a double stroller.|`|1CryEnb3aa	Depends on how much room you have.  My baby went in to a toddler bed at 10 mo old.  She slept all night.  (She hated her crib and woudln't sleep in it).   I would think a double stroller(pushchair) would be needed in your case.  They will both need to be restained and carrying one whould be difficult while pushing the stroller.   Good luck|`|Uy8ntukjaa	Your son will probably not be ready for a toddler bed at 16 months but if you use a bassinet for your newborn for the first three months you can probably put your son into a toddler bed at that time. Bassinets are fairly inexpensive and you can usually find them at discount and gently used baby stores. <br>  <br>  As for a stroller, you don't need to get a double if you're willing to carry the baby in a sling, but otherwise I'd recommend one. It will save a lot of stress when you want to go for a walk, take the kids to the park, or go into a store with them.
UR5r6PAzaa	I would definitely go with the 2nd picture. Even though the 1st one looks more creative, the second one shows more detail. And it's a prego belly contest, so they wanna see belly, not the creativity of the picture!|`|lxF2hvisaa	the first one is more pretty, the second one shows the belly better...Depends on what the contest actually entails.|`|tLuQNoP2aa	this one <br>  <br>  <a href="http://i10.photobucket.com/albums/a106/TITO283/prego.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i10.photobucket.com/albums/a106/T...</a>|`|7jXChfBNaa	the 2nd for sure=)|`|AA11120998	you should go for the 1st one its more natural and artistic.|`|AA12275027	i like the first one|`|TRrTunqvaa	theyre both so beautiful! but im much much more attracted to the first one.. the second one has an ominous feeling.. good for art, not babies! lol.. but the first one is magnificent!|`|12d54aae44a56fa45d6d9f5011d6c253aa	First one.  I like how it looks victoiran almost.  A classic beauty caring for her baby.  With your off camara look it seems you have a lot going on and responsiblities but, because of the position of your arms it's clear your baby is center of your life and fundamentely your thoughts and world.<br>  <br>  Good luck in the contest!!|`|ACyrJQHOaa	hi, they are both amazing but i like the second one i think the best.Good luck and what a cute baby belly :)|`|UgIOVl1jaa	They're both good but I'd go with the first one it's a bit more arty - good luck :)|`|TvYX1yXWaa	the first one|`|uLeXGHnKaa	I like the first one the best, I don't know what it is about the second one, but something about the angle and the way the cloth is draped and the fact that you're so big and the lighting almost make your belly look not real. I like the position and the lighting in the first one better, and even though you can't see your face as well I like you're expression better, you look like you're connecting with your body more.|`|wUVUXHZtaa	2nd. You can see your face a belly more. Pregnant women are so cute!!

9UYl8ErFaa	dont feel bad i just found out im pregnant and im in my 7th month only reason i found out is cuz my stomach started growing but every test said neg till they did an ultrasound|`|ZIRdJjEkaa	My girlfriend just told me last night that she didn't find out about her first pregnancy until she was 5 month prego... it is not super uncommon for women in your situation (getting a period during pregnancy).  And don't feel guilty, 12 weeks is still early enough to get great prenatal care.  Congratulations!!!!<br>  p.s. think of it this way, you have a much shorter pregnancy AND you are already through what most women consider the worst part of pregnancy!!!|`|COYBJRKxaa	sweetheart some women don't know there pregnant till they fall down on labour so i really would worry about it you certainly are not the first person to find out a bit late and you wont be the last. just think of it this way you only have 7 months left i found out way to soon with mine and the pregnancy seemed to last forever, just don't worry enjoy the rest of your pregnancy seems like you've missed morning sickness and stuff so arnt you the lucky one. good luck|`|AA11120998	Its nothing some women are diffrent not eveyone gets symtoms and stops been on there period but it is a good thing you found out! Dont feel bad just feel joy that you have a beautiful person inside you tha t one day will be calling you mommy and love you like there is no tomorrow! Sorry hormones kicking in lol! im 38weeks prego! congradulations!!!!!!!|`|856df45cd220b8db7117dd899c6e5ae2aa	I knew a young girl who went to the ER because she was having "stomach cramps" and gave birth one hour later.  She had no idea.  I find that very hard to believe, but since I know this girl personally, and as crazy as it sounds, I believe her.  Many women have periods for a couple of months during early pregnancy.  And at three months there is no movement...and if you have never been pregnant before then you don't know what signs to be looking for.  It's all good.<br>  <br>  Kelly|`|vygYFdsSaa	Of course not sweetheart!! Haven't you heard those stories about girls who didn't know they were pregnant until they went into labor? Which to me is crazy but hey...it happens.<br>  <br>  Don't feel guilty, its more common than you think. Some women find out around 4 or even 5 months.|`|NvbTnLrBaa	Thats about when I found out. But i was sick, and thought i had the flu. My husband made a joke about "maybe its morning sickness", so i did just to be safe. Well, I am now 25 weeks.|`|hCTTkwaZaa	my mother had a normal period while pregnant with me until the 6th month she didn't even know she was prego until the fifth month  she felt me move and went to the doctor|`|shNvIqN0aa	I didn't find out till I went to the hospital for severe stomach pains...I was in labor! Had my "menstrual" the whole time. This was with my 3rd child. I was in total SHOCK and so was EVERYONE else.|`|0cfba6ec58258d9277443cf769413b9eaa	Don't feel bad some women's hormones are different and not all pregnancy test pick up right away that your pregnant my friend didn't find out she was pregnant until she was over 5 months pregnant and she was having twins. It's not common but it happens congrats on the baby !|`|nZPGdcKJaa	I was 4-6 weeks and I had no idea.<br>  My husband (boyfriend at the time) told me to get a test, I didn't believe him.|`|AA10526033	LOL Actually to me thats normal. i didn't find out with my first 2 until 12 weeks my periods were always irregular and i never thought about it. i seriously thought the only way you found out earlier is if you were trying lol. with my 3rd i was about 7 weeks but only because hubby made me as we were worried that i was because we had a 6 month old at the time and i had taken out my nuvaring and forgot and we had unprotected sex!|`|VzLkSZ4faa	My friend just took a test Monday and it came up positive. We are positive that she is as far along as me, I'm 17.5 weeks, or even farther. She's had several irregular periods and skipped the last 2. That's the only way she thought to test. Oh an she is feeling really strong kicks.  So your definately not the only one.|`|P9k8qHP6aa	I worked with a lady that did not know that she was pregnant til she was like 6 or 7 months. She spoted the entire time and had no other symptoms either. I wouldnt stress about it....in fact be glad you missed the first trimester...lol<br>  <br>  Good luck and congrats|`|GAxJNvxmaa	don't feel stupid. it happens to some people. my friend found out she was 24 weeks pregnant!
UbCzA2JVaa	I like it for a boy. The spelling looks more masculine to me to. I think that Schuyler and Ciaran would be a cute sibling set. It goes nicely with your favourite boy names.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  :)<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: Some suggestions I have for you (because I am bored) are....<br>  Hamish<br>  Callum<br>  Alastair/Alasdair<br>  Malcolm<br>  Shea<br>  Shannon|`|zbjaBgyEaa	An explination of the pronunciation may be necessary on this one, luv.  I cant' figure out if it's Shoe-ler or Shy-ler or sky-ler.<br>  <br>  I was going to guess it was Germanic, but as the two languages are in the same general family, I suppose it's pretty close.  But I don't really feel like it fits with the other names all that well.  All the other names are quite distinctly anglo-saxon-y-ish.  Even Aubrey, which I know is German.  In terms of pronunciation, looks and sounds it's quite close to English.  Schuyler stands out because it's so very dutch.  Maybe if you had a few more dutch or germanic names on there it would look less out of place.<br>  <br>  I never liked the name Skylar at all.  I dislike everything about it.<br>  <br>  I can't imagine it being very feminine.  It shares the same ending is Tyler.  I really don;t see the problem there.|`|wY2k1cHVaa	I dislike the spelling sorry. That makes the name very hard to pronounce. I would of said it like "School-ler" at first. I LOVE the name Skylar for a guy though. I never thought of it as a girl name.|`|tSEA42Uraa	I really like Schuyler, and definitely that spelling for a boy. It goes perfectly with your other favorites, (which, by the way, I love Russell and Cieran) and it's a nice, respectable name.<br>  <br>  In my opinion, Schuyler / Skylar is a little bit like Aaron / Erin -- In that they can be pronounced similarly, if not the same, but be spelled differently, to have the different affect on both boys and girls. I'm not a fan of Skylar in general, whether it be for either gender, but I love Schuyler on a boy.<br>  <br>  P.S. -- What do you think of Collin, David, Liam / William, Mitchell, Levi, and Nicholas?<br>  <br>  Some Irish / Scottish names you might like:<br>  ~Carrigan (for a boy) ~ IRISH<br>  ~Aindrea (for a boy; means "man") ~ IRISH<br>  ~Cian ~ IRISH<br>  ~Conner ~ IRISH<br>  ~Declan ~ IRISH<br>  ~Kiernan / Ciernan ~ IRISH<br>  ~Seamus ~ IRISH<br>  ~Sheridan (for a boy -- I just noticed that Shannon means "old".

Schuyler Shannon sounds nice along with Schuyler Ethan<br>  Schuyler Ian<br>  Schuyler Aedan<br>  Schuyler Bradan<br>  Schuyler Breandan<br>  Schuyler Coilin<br>  Schuyler Dillon<br>   Schuyler Eirnin<br>  Schuyler  Finn<br>  Schuyler Liam<br>  Schuyler  Quinn<br>  Schuyler Ronan<br>  Schuyler Sean<br>  Schuyler Cadence<br>  Schuyler Nikolas <br>  Schuyler Matthias<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.....<br>  LOL, I ramble too and I am proud of it! :)|`|TAufQoc7aa	Hi there<br>  <br>  To be honest I never in a million years would have looked at Schuyler and pronounced it Skyler. I would have thought Shoy-ler<br>  <br>  Im not making fun of the name or anything I just dont think its a good looking name funny as it may sound I dont think Schuyler would suit a baby<br>  <br>  x<br>  <br>  Ps I love Patrick from your list ;-)|`|6hb04Ow0aa	I don't like it because it is not my style. Though I must disagree on your views of American people. You should be aware that many users on this site are American and will take offense to your ramblings.|`|AA11689956	Schulyer..its definatley not a girls name anyway it's spelled..IMO i love the name just not much of a fan of that spelling<br>  <br>  i love the spelling of Ciaran, beautiful name...|`|Uz4V7Jckaa	I don't like it and I don't think it fits in at all with your other names.|`|ibg67Xtvaa	i love MALAchi with that name|`|EWFtQNSdaa	I LOVE Schuyler, thank you for not spelling it like Skylar or Skyler and not putting it for a girl. It's a boys name.<br>  <br>  Paul is not my favourite but it's a strong male name which is great!<br>  Patrick is gorgeous, I love this name.<br>  Aubrey is great, I love it for a boy!<br>  Russell, it kind of reminds me of the breed of dog, but I like it otherwise.<br>  Ciaran is my favourite ever boys name, I love it spelt this way (Irish) its fantastic.<br>  Malachi is an awesome name, not common but no unheard of.<br>  Kendall I also like for a boy, I hate it on a girl.<br>  Again with Delaney, has been wrongly used on girls. It is a great boys name.<br>  Matthew is a classic name, I love it.<br>  August is a really nice name, I love it.<br>  <br>  Awesome name choices :)<br>  <br>  EDIT - oh and I love Hamish and Shannon too, great names!|`|m4amCT5waa	I really can't imagine this being considered a feminine name at all - if I were going to classify it as "too" anything, it would be "too surnamey".  However, Kendall, Delaney, and Russell all come from/are surnames, too, so I can definitely see it fitting in with your style.<br>  <br>  Do I like it?  Not particularly, but that's just because it's not my style.  With all the surname --> first name love there is going on, I can definitely see Schuyler working.  And like I said, I do think that it does fit in with your style.  If it works for you, I don't see any particular conflict between it and your other names.<br>  <br>  As an aside, I think you have some great boy names on your list - especially Ciaran, if I had to single one out. :)<br>  <br>  ETA: I knew one Skyler, and he was a boy, but that spelling and Skylar I can conceivably see as feminine due to modern usage.  But I really, REALLY think if this is the spelling you prefer...it's just not feminine.  At all.  And it amplifies the surnamey feeling.  Spelling really can change the enitre vibe of a name, can't it?|`|7TXNlZL9aa	I love the name. I have a friend thats name that but he spells it Skyler. I like your spelling better, it's different and unique|`|sy0hiGspaa	I like it for a boy, especially with that spelling. Whenever I put a question using that spelling, people had no clue how to pronounce it.<br>  I do not think that you should call people stupid because they use masculine names. That name might have some significance to them.<br>  <br>  My uncles names is Channon. I prefer "Channon" for a boy than "Shannon". The name "Channon" is the americanized version of his name when he moved from Israel.|`|6SwaWSoyaa	I hate the name Shcuyler/Skylar/Skyler for a girl. It is definitely a boy's name. I like the name though. However my favorite on the list though is August. I think that is wonderful. All the months after August I feel are boy names, but I hear girls named September, and I just don't get it. I strongly disagree with the opinions on Americans being ignorant on baby names. People always say that we aren't cultured enough, but I disagree. We are constantly looking at other cultures to try to get different ideas and stuff. People on here are always looking at names of other origins outside the English language. I think I've made my point on that.<br>  <br>  Actually I like the combo of August Matthew and Schuyler Russell.
8Rn2pX4jaa	When I lost mine, my doc was less than impressed.  I was hopeful that it meant labor might soon follow... but no such luck.  I think they would be more concerned with contractions rather than your mucus plug.  Also if there was a "bloody show" lots of blood in the plug, not just the pinkish tinged goo.  (I can't think of a better way to describe it... although *gags* works!)<br>  <br>  When was your last appointment?  Have they check to see if you are dilating yet?  32 weeks is pretty early, if you don't have a doctors appointment coming up in the next few days I would call your doc in the morning.

AA11369490	well first of all id like to say that answerer #1 should stfu<br>  <br>  i am very sorry to hear this, no one should go through that. i agree you should talk to a school counselour, you should get out of that house. is there any family or friends you could stay with?? im afraid if this continues she might push you too far, and things could turn physical. you deserve so much better than this :[ maybe your mom has some unresolved issues, if you talk to a counselour they could get you and your mom help. but i suggest you get out of that house as soon as possible.<br>  <br>  i really do hope you can find help and a happier home. and if you need anyone to talk to you can always email me :]|`|wi6mkT30aa	I'm sorry hon. If you're mom is emotionally abusive to you that is just as bad as actual physical abuse. I'd talk to a school concealer and let them know what you're going through, maybe they can help you. You deserve a better home/mother.|`|AA11908256	never let the actions of others determine who you choose to be.<br>  your being angry toward such a disturbed being is entirely your choice<br>  never allow evil to flourish in your heart. the best way to balance evil is<br>  personal actions of profound good|`|hmKEHofzaa	how old are you 5?|`|prqrQcd1aa	Maybe you should tell someone at school how your mom is towards you and get out of that house.. Are you able to go live with some other relitives or something?

9W2PsQ4kaa	My daughter, now 12, has been writing songs and poetry since she could write.  Many of these were sad and lonely or about being betrayed by a friend or about a friend moving.  The first time I read one, I was sitting there crying and she asked me why.  I told her I was so sad that she was so sad.  She responded, a little P,O'd, that MOMMY, IT'S JUST A SONG!<br>  <br>  Then I realized that many of the songs I listen to in the car have very deep emotions - listen sometime to some of the songs on the radio that we hear every day and as adults, we really don't absorb the meanings like kids do.<br>  <br>  Anyway the next time she read to me a poem, she prefaced it by saying "now mom, remember this is just a poem.  This isn't the way I really feel, and I'm okay, and don't cry, okay??"<br>  <br>  Here I was thinking that a little girl's poems should be about rainbows and puppies and unicorns.  But times have changed and they are exposed to so much more than we were.<br>  <br>  I talk with my kid about everything.  Now, you don't say how old your daughter is and how your relationship is, but if it were me that found it, I wouldn't hesitate to talk about it.  "Honey, I was cleaning your room and found this poem.  It caught my eye and I hope you don't mind that I read it.  It's written very very well and is very grown up.  But I am a little worried, is everything okay with you/your friends/school??"  Hopefully this will open up a conversation rather than get her angry, but if you do it right, without accusations about her mental health, it should go okay.  Chances are that it's "just a poem" but she may very well feel lonely and miserable much like many pre-teen girls today.  If that's the case, just keep up with asking her about her day and her friends - DAILY - and always know that you are there to talk to.  If she talks about being lonely, you can discuss it with her and again, don't be preachy or give lectures but LISTEN.  That's what she needs most.  Ask her how she feels and what she intends to do about the situation - give suggestions if you must but always let her know that she's in control (as opposed to you).<br>  <br>  My daughter sometimes says she's lonely and miserable but she's always walking around the house singing and she laughs an awful lot.  Her drawings are always of smiling people (no rainbows or unicorns though LOL).  It took me a little while to realize it was a combination of being a pre-teen and the lyrics - and I'm not talking about evil music - stuff like the Beatles - like I said, listen closely to some songs - many are about lonliness, the loss of friends or relationships that have ended.<br>  <br>  I hope I made sense and that I've helped.  Communicate with your kid!!<br>  <br>  PS - it's an awsome poem BTW<br>  <br>  and another PS - don't listen to these people who say you shouldn't have been in your kid's room.  Parents today HAVE to know everything about their kid and I think too much privacy is wrong.  And don't worry about posting it online, none of us know who she is so even though we've all read it, we cannot connect it with HER.  But above all, communicate with her!!!  You never know, but she may have left it out purposely for you to find so she can talk to you!!!|`|f61ebe36568a53824e5d8e2786a3f83caa	Seems like typical adolescent angst to me. Feeling awkward, feeling like you don't fit in, feeling like you don't know your place in the world anymore, wanting to be both grown up and older than you are and still have the protective innocence you once had a child. I know you probably are concerned for her welfare, but putting this on the internet betrays her trust. If she found it, she'd be mortified. I would remove it if possible, out of respect for her.|`|DS21ekeJaa	All the posts about not snooping, well, they must not be parents! My children are well aware of the fact that I can and will enter their rooms at any time I choose and look at whatever I choose. <br>  This poem disturbs me in that it seems the cry of depression or abuse of some type. Are you close to any of her friends that you could ask in confidence if something has happened? My oldest daughters cousin and friends will tell me if I need to keep a closer eye on her, but won't rat her out as to what it is. Ask her about it, if nothing else.|`|kpnSKV6Eaa	its probably just poetry.. maybe she uses it to release stress. maybe it was an assignment for school.. i wouldnt worry to much unless she is distributing signs of depression. ie.. not going out or seeming happy, not having friends, seeming down or out, being a mole and staying in her room all the time.. other than that its probably just a normal thing. i used to write poetry like this a younger girl and it was purely just because i loved writing and sad poetry grabs the audience more and is also easier to write than poetry about love and stuff which i hadnt experienced yet|`|koXcq0l1aa	Hopefully she has a Yahoo Answers account and reads this.  Then you'll really feel like kicking yourself won't you.  You know what's funny...if mothers actually would ASK their children what is going on in their lives and try to be involved, they wouldn't feel the urge to snoop through their children's personal property...|`|nzyOCsOiaa	UHM, she's lonely?<br>  Or just sad.<br>  HEY.<br>  don't sneak around in your daughters room.<br>  My dad found one of my poems that I wrote when I was sad and asked me about it. I didn't talk to him for a week.|`|fIDWcViHaa	How old is your daughter? <br>  Have you noticed any changes in her personality/activities/school performance/friendships recently?|`|izDlfkZXaa	Your daughter is having unprotected sex with drug dealers as part of an initiation ritual for a radical terrorist suicide cult.|`|hHxJ0BONaa	shes growing up.|`|KAB1GNh4aa	well first i wouldnt have gone snooping through her room, but now that you have it could be either one of three things - something for her school work, something she wrote being inspired by something (often people read something they like and want to copy it), or she could just be lonely, perhaps she is keeping something to herself, maybe you need to sit down with her and just ask her, or maybe just keep an eye on her and see if she has changed noticibily. <br>  Also depending on her age she may be going through something very personal - maybe she broke up with a boyfriend, had a fight with friends.<br>  <br>  I would try to get to the bottom of it, but try to be subtle, as she might not want to tell you, maybe suggest she should speak to someone else if she has problems.<br>  <br>  Well whatever you decide good luck!!|`|um8IIEn8aa	IT MEANS YOUR DAUGHTER IS AN EMO *****!|`|g9v7rTcRaa	Are u SERIOUS!?!?!?!?<br>  Y would u go into ur daughters room without her noing?!?!?!?!?<br>  UR A MEAN MOMMY!!|`|bSQTOoKyaa	First of all, STOP snooping around in your daughter's room. That is her place and having someone look around through your stuff is not good. Your daughter might have had something happen, but most likely she's a teenager who has a wave of emotions and writing helps her express them. She is a poet. If you are worried about her, ask her if everything is ok but don't tell her u found the poem. Also if something tramatic happened in the past this could just be left over emotions.|`|7wVKW3l1aa	She is a teenage girl and thinks she has a horrible life lol we all go through it..maybe talk to her I think shes lonely|`|x1qKGmzSaa	it just sounds like she doesnt really wanna grow up but she is and shes confused about things around her. she sounds sad, maybe you should ask a doctor or something.. the poem makes me sad :( also, dont listen to these people. DO look threw her things! because my mom always "respected our privacy" and she had no clue what was going on. my little TWELVE year old sister was wanting to kill herself, and if it wasnt for ME snooping around in her stuff, my mom would have never known, and never been able to get her help. so you as her mother have the right to snoop threw her things!|`|wAQJEpFDaa	It means she is a typical teenage girl....moody, secretive, and she will probably be super mad if she finds out you read her poetry, and ESPECIALLY mad if she finds out you put it online. ooopsy. Put it back, pretend you never saw it, and by the way, your kid seems to have a talent for poetry....be proud.|`|k0vSYsrhaa	Honestly, you really shouldn't do that.<br>  School can be really stressful and you sometimes need to write things down. She might not really mean it. My mom saw something similar in my room and she confronted me about it. It was something that I just felt writing down at the time. You shouldn't worry so much! Hope I helped!!!|`|Db8vBselaa	you need to quit going through your daughters stuff, give her privacy.<br>  and thats poetry. its pretty good poetry to, it means she's just noticed that she's growing up...its not a big deal. poetry is fun, a pasttime, a hobby. she's not on drugs or anything, get some trust in her and leave her alone.<br>  jules|`|k4iJ4BJqaa	It does'nt neccisarily mean that she feels lonely. Even the happiest people can write horribly misrible poems. Don't make such a big deal out of it because it may not be big. She probably just felt like writing a poem for no good reason. Do NOT yell.|`|SSe2GUnaaa	has her attitude changed ?? ,, has she become less interested in things?? ...  maybe this is way off , it sounds like she was sexually abused or something ...|`|5pQeDxT8aa	Its poetry... congrats your kid is a poet.

I can't believe you went into her room and violated her privicy like that. I can see why she writes poems like that. She has a nosy mom|`|PjxamRdVaa	She is good at poetry. Maybe you should stay out of your daughters room!

That's most of families problems, no communication.  Yes, you will have to sy you were in her room and found it.  but, some of the lines makes me wonder if something happened to her or if she is just writing.  If, you are worried, go to her not us.

Hf5doDxsaa	My daughter is only six months and 15 pounds - she still uses hers.  I think 25 lbs. is around nine months or so.  The thing I've noticed with my daughter though is she is getting pretty tall.  So we might have to change it before she is 25 lbs.  <br>  And about the swing...I didn't get one at my baby shower so I got one from a community sale for $20 and it has been just fine for my daughter.  At first I was kind of disappointed because it is older and blue.  But that feeling went away fast because she doesn't care what the thing looks like.  And I actually think this one is better for her-she loves the bright colors.  At first, she lived in the thing, but now-she's got bigger fish to fry.  She wants to get out and move around-roll over, sit up, things like that.  If I were you I'd put the money towards something else.  Maybe something for the nursery, or clothes, and that will buy a lot of diapers.|`|bf2b826fb186efa4963970654d24ac34aa	Use your big ticket item money on a good stroller or convertible car seat. At least that's my opinion. What age they are at 25lbs really depends on your child. I'd say an average of 6-8 months. My son has a simple infant swing and it works fine for us. I have no idea what weight limit is on it though, I got it second hand from a friend's sister.|`|TJusfEnlaa	I'm sorry I don't know what a carrier style car seat is... <br>  but with the swing, they are peaceful and can help baby fall asleep when they are newborn - and provides lots of fun when they are a bit bigger! my son is 9 months and still sometimes goes in his swing and absolutely loves it.|`|MZ5deUKWaa	MOST IMPORTANTLY: A child has to be at least 1 year old before graduating from the infant carrier and into the forward facing position, so if your child hasn't reached that mark yet, hold off. Weight does really depend on the child but an average child is between 1-2 years old around the weight of 25 lbs. I have 3 kids and 2 of them have reached or exceeded that area and both of them were right around 25 lbs. at the age of 1. As their pediatrician said: that was the average weight for a child at that age.|`|0dUDmb8Oaa	i think the reason they don't do it by age because not every baby is the same weight, so you should go by weight instead of by age.
iE7k6Vzraa	Hey if she isn't doing what you ask her to do wait until she needs you to do something for her and then don't do it, it is a great lesson on give and take. Example ; hey mom I'm ready to go to mall - your reaction - sorry I am not taking you.<br>  <br>  Why?<br>  I am really tired from your tv being left on and I am tired . So I am not taking you .<br>   Be sure to always follow through.|`|1CryEnb3aa	Ok, when she goes to grandmas. turn your phone off.  Take away her T.V., let her walk to school.  Don't let her back talk. TAKE AWAY THE CELL PHONE.    She needs discipline.  You guys are to blame for this.  You give her too much rain in the house.  Who id the parent and who is the child?  You have to regain the control.  WHat role does your gf want you to take?  Are you guys in this together or is she the disciplinarian  You need to work together on this.  It will get worse before it gets better.  The girl is screaming for structure and you guys need to give to her or your next few years will only be worse!!  Good luck<br>  Oh- she needs to knwo that all the things you guys have given her are not nesessities and can be gone in a blink.  Make her earn them back with good behavior and good attitude.  You don't reward bad behavior.  My kids know this well.  And they are great kids too.  Every child tries to test and push the boundries.  She needs to know things have to change.

If she is calling before 9am and it is not an emergency call, the consequence should be given. Also to speak with grandparents about her using the phone at undesirable times. If it is a cell phone, that should be taken away.<br>  <br>  "we have told her to turn her television off in her room at night at 10 pm"<br>  <br>  Telling her once is a warning. Telling her twice results in having the tv taken out of her room.  Problem solved.<br>  <br>  "...we live in michigan and she refuses to wear a coat and it is winter"<br>  <br>  If she don't want to wear a coat. Don't force her. The consequence is her not having a jacket when she realizes it is cold. After awhile, she will self remember to put on a jacket. Having no jacket doesn't cause a cold. The cold Temperature causes the immune system to slow down, which can ease a person to get sick easier. If she gets sick, tell her "Wear a jacket next time. Time for school. Lets go".<br>  <br>  :...the other night we told her not to eat because we were all going out to eat at a nice place in 30 minutes...her mother and i went to get ready and when we came out she was stuffing her face with potato chips..."<br>  <br>  That is when you say "I am sorry. You didn't listen to the rules. You can stay home or go to your grandparents while we go out to eat".  Good idea to lock up junk food.  If she ate an apple is one thing. My mom always said "If you want a snack, eat healthy like a carrot, apple or grapes. If you are hungry, you can wait 30 mins". for an example.<br>  <br>  "she is always making messes, and when you ask her to pick them up she back talks"<br>  <br>  Consequence for her actions. <br>  <br>  "we told her to have her cell phone charger in her bedroom...she continuously will unplug the microwave and put it in the kitchen to charge up."<br>  <br>  Take away the phone.

She can earn them back by following the rules her mom and you decide are appropriate. <br>  When is she a great kid with you? When it is fun time and there are no confrontations on the horizon. What does her mom say about all of this? The two of you as parents must be on the same wavelength as to what the appropriate rules must be and what the consequences are for breaking them. <br>  This young lady sounds like she is testing you to see what will happen, and also is looking for guidance as to what is right and wrong. Give her guidelines and consequences- life as an adult is full of them so allowing her to learn now is what parenting is all about!|`|Ff7mCzlPaa	You're right - you need to take things slow as far as acting like an authority figure in this girl's life until she has adjusted to having you around.  Her mother needs to discipline, but she might also let her daughter know that you are in charge on those occasions when she's not home.<br>  <br>  This girl sounds typical..... she's asserting her independence and on one hand, feels like a grown up and is looking forward to being an adult.  On the other hand, she's still a little kid and couldn't be independent if she tried!<br>  <br>  I suppose that you and the girl's mom could discuss taking away privileges for back talking.  And then let the daughter know what will happen if she doesn't think before she spurts out insulting words.  <br>  <br>  Follow through with your punishments, and do not make threats such as "if you do this again, such-and-such will happen"... because a few times doing that,and the kid won't believe you are going to submit punishment or take away privileges.<br>  <br>  by the way, yelling at kids doesn't work.  when my kids misbehaved  i sat them down at the kitchen table.  then i asked them if they knew why they misbehaved.  i asked them how they felt about it.  then i would ask them how they thought they'd avoid doing whatever-it-was again.  <br>  <br>  both my kids are adults now, and they have both told me theyd rather have had a good spanking... heehee|`|hAXDWhiVaa	I am 22 years old and wish that my parents would have used more discipline with me. i turned out just fine and am a very responsible woman with 2 Beautiful kids. i just wish they wouldn't have let me skip school all the time and ruin my whole high school career. they were either far too lenient or way too harsh .(my mom called the cops on me for the stupidest things). Make sure you find that comfortable medium. let her know she can come to you for anything so she does trust you as well. but be careful not to be her best friend rather than a disciplinary figure. Kids need direction. set ground rules. i was about 13 when i started my adolescent rebellion.|`|nOrWOZU4aa	It's tough, I have 3 teenagers.  I would unplug the weekend phone and when she questions why, just say that the phone rings and wakes you up and you wanted to sleep in. (see it's not because of her, and that way and she gets the message).  I get that tv thing too, They have to put the timer on and have the sound way down. Worse case scenario, flip the breaker in the power box, (gosh honey I don't know why it wont work)  dinner thing - (oh, so you're not coming for dinner?  but you just ate.)  I would unplug the charger and put it away and forget where you put it.  (oh yah, I did unplug that, where did I put it, OR are you sure you didn't plug it in your room like before,(even if there was no before))  And they all make a mess, even when they clean up it is still messy.   But the one thing that works for that for me, is that I will stand there with my coat on because he wants a video game rental, and not move or sit and do something minor, and wait for the job to be done.  "but I'll do that when I get back" they say, and I say that I have already waited, and I don't need a video game, and I don't really feel like going out, so it is all up to him.  Kids think we are all stupid anyways, so take advantage of it.|`|pp9RzHvDaa	Don't be afraid of being the new guy.  It is your place and your rules.  You and your wife need to come up with a plan together.  If you are unsure of your boundaries, ask your wife.<br>  <br>  I would personally, snatch the TV out of her room, take away her cell phone and let her walk in the cold if she wants to.  She is just being defiant.  This could be her way of coping with a new person in the picture.  She is pushing your limits to see how much she can get away with.  If she walks home with a friend without letting anyone know, ask her if she cares that her ride had to sit there and wait on her just to find that she never showed up.  She needs discipline and it is okay to get angry.  Just make sure that you explain why you are taking things away from her etc. so that she will learn.  Punishment should always be a lesson learned, and never just to hurt their feelings.<br>  <br>  She needs to understand that the TV and her cell phone are privileges, not rights.  But it is your right and your wife's right as parents to discipline her, take things away from her.  If you don't start this early on, it will only get worse.  Think of when she goes out with a guy one day and misses curfew and you're up waiting for hours worried sick.|`|cVVZrQ9faa	ok im 15 and my mom had this boyfriend riht and i was nice to him but there was no way he was ever ganna tell me what to do its just like if shes only had a mom for so long then thats the prmary person she is going to listen to and the tv thng get over it b cuz she is going to do that nomadder what i do that all the time heres a solution put the tv away from the wall that connects to ur room|`|gN7eEQeWaa	she's a crystal or indigo child. search it on wikipedia...<br>  no matter what you do, you will not get her to do what you want.

Ah6FJHkWaa	My husband and I adopted three children, aged 4,5,6 last year.<br>  <br>  I had some worries about connection, but lots of work went into Replacement matching.<br>  <br>  The children were in two different foster homes.  We met the little ones first, and there was instant connection.  (not love that is different)  Love came shortly after and grows every day.  We have had little problem connection and love wise for these two children.<br>  <br>  My (then) six year old was a different story.  As a caveat, I had fostered for years before this (in a different province) and had seen many children come and go.  So when I met my son, I was shocked that I not only did not feel that connection, but that I felt worried that I would actually be able to connect and end up truly loving him and him me.  Part of the problem was his foster mom was not very good, did not prep him, and he had some very large behaviour problems etc.<br>  '<br>  I shared my concerns with my social worker and we all agreed to move forward and keep communication.  After moving in it took quite awhile for he and I to connect.  First of all (and I was used to this before) he directed all anger and issues with me, as the "replacement mom".  This is very normal for children coming into care, although my experience had been with fostering only previously.<br>  <br>  We persevered, but I had to use my "parent therapist" hat more that just being mom.  I worked very hard at consistency, and worked on a few specific behaviours (soiling pants etc.) that needed to be addressed.  About 4 months into the adoption, he let his guard down and decided to give me a chance.  Until that time, we really didn't know each other.  He already was fully connected and attached to my husband, but he basically said he would give this a try.  This allowed some times (not all the time) but sometimes where I could mommy him.  Off and on for a few months it was better, not great but better.  I had fallen in love myself, and he was starting.  Around Christmas time he and I just clicked.  Keep in mind this was eight months after the placement.  We were mommy and son, spending loads of quality time together, really getting to know each other.  Now that he felt more safe and secure he really let us see who he is.  And what a quirky lovely child!  He is still emotionally younger, but he is now a mommy's boy.  And I won't ever say I love a child more than another, but he and I have something...special.  Something we had to work for and it was well worth it.<br>  <br>  Some of the advise I give is:<br>  <br>  -make sure work is done for the Replacement match.  Honestly if it had been just him, we may not have been approached.  With three children rarely will all fall in love and everything just clicks.<br>  <br>  -give time for grieving and never try to replace what he/she had or imagines he/she had with their old parents.  Even though he was abused and neglected, he had fantasies about his old parents and that everything was great.  We allow him to talk about his parents and remind him that they were not able to parent, and he did nothing wrong.  We also talk about reunion when he is older if he wants, but right now he cannot have contact with them, for safety and other issues.<br>  <br>  -persevere.  There were many days I could have thrown in the towel.  One day I hid in my closet it was so bad.  But he needs to test these boundaries out, to see if I will still be there when he has given me his worst (and give he did!).  He needed me to say "yep, still love you" no matter what.<br>  <br>  -Don't push what is not there.  Some parents may take things personally and try to push for the I love yours and other things, but this comes with time.  Don't try to manufacture a relationship, just keep on having opportunities to get to know each other, be consistent and it will get there.<br>  <br>  -Learn to laugh.  There is not a room in my house that has not been destroyed in one fashion or another.  Some of the legendary fits and temper tantrums are now time we get together and talk about, and he laughs about what he used to do, and can't believe he did that.  I learn to laugh at the little things.  I don't care if my child does his homework, or how behind he is intellectually, right now getting that emotional security is important.  When the school phones and tells me he has three teachers chasing him in the school park because he won't come in, I tell them to stop chasing him.  Then I hang up and laugh.  Our family laughs and has fun, and this is the one thing that makes us strong.  Almost all of our "bonding" moments have been while playing games, Wii, dress up or other fun things, just letting the kids be who they are.<br>  <br>  I will tell you it is worth it.  I do not regret our choices ever.  You have to realize it WILL be different than having a biological child, and some things have to be handled differently, but the joy in seeing the progress in my children, and the joy in seeing their faces when they know food is on the table, and they feel secure enough in life that we wi|`|oAkLpgFaaa	I waited for a family to adopt me from the time I was 12 until I aged out of the system at 18. <br>  <br>  I think its a wonderful idea.<br>  <br>  Sure, you can be concerned that they wouldn't love you but you don't just adopt any child. The older child is generally asked their opinions and you get a lot of bonding time as far as I understand. It isn't like adopting an infant. I think there will be plenty of opportunities for a relationship to grow and if it just isn't going to work, there are plenty of older children waiting.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|DwDeD8cvaa	The way I looked at it was that they didn't ask to be adopted, I shouldn't expect anything from them. It was my job to do the best I could to love them and to be a good parent, since I'm the one that initiated the process.  So because I tried to keep my expectations down, no I wasn't worried they wouldn't love me or accept me. Love would be a bonus, but I just focused on doing what my part should be for them.<br>  <br>  My first adoption was a toddler, but when he was seven/eight we adopted a four and a six year old.  They do love us as their parents. However we spend a lot of time talking about their other family. They're not going to forget they have another family or stop missing them.  My elder daughter especially has been working through some issues.<br>  <br>  The adjustment took some time, especially having an older child who was used to being the only child.  We all of us spent a lot of time talking out the little difficulties. As much as the new children had to adjust to our way of living, in fairness we also adjusted some of our ways to what the new children were used to.  They had to feel it was their home and they were important.  At the same time we had to keep our eldest from feeling like he'd lost his old life. Since he was eldest, he got to stay up an hour later than the younger children and have alone time with us. Everything has worked out very well.<br>  <br>  I'd just like to also say that although the adjusting was some work, at the time it didn't seem so.  The best thing for us about adopting our second two children was how quickly they and our son bonded.  And there's the fun of seeing the new children come home with their first party invitations or getting their first phone calls from new friends at school.|`|OQnRP6xVaa	I was soooo nervous it liked to kill me. We found out in Mid December that we would be the adoptive family for a 5 year old sister and 1 year old brother. It was agreed that nothing should happen until after the Holidays and Wow was that an anti-climatic one for us--Knowing our children were having Christmas at someone Else's house was just so strange. <br>  <br>  Finally, the day came when we would meet our daughter and I had No Clue what to Really Expect. We met the baby the night before and he was a baby--a one year old sticky little boy. He was very young and didn't care one bit about me at our first meeting and I knew he would be an easy love... <br>  <br>  We met our little girl the next morning for breakfast and I just didn't know what to expect when I met someone who could walk and talk...someone who had a life before me. It kinda felt like an arranged marriage. <br>  <br>  I had two baby's before and had different feelings with both of them for a long list of reasons. But, meeting someone who was already someone was something I just didn't know what would feel like and nothing you can know until it happens.<br>  <br>  I remember watching her little head bounce across the restaurant toward our table and she took my breath away... She sparkled.<br>  <br>  Once we met and were sitting there learning about her, the first outside thought that came to my mind was How I couldn't wait to Tell my Ex-Husband, who was adopted and the father of my Bio kids that he was wrong about one thing he worried about as an adoptee... And that he should tell his adoptive mother that she shouldn't doubt it herself because I felt just exactly the same way about this walking talking little girl as I did my first baby when I first met him.<br>  <br>  I think I actually did call him while we were at the hotel during our transition and I know I talked to his sister who is still and has been my best friend for more then 28 years who is also adopted. <br>  <br>  Today, we have been a family for over 6 years and I sometimes forget that I can't remember holding her in my arms right after she was born. I just don't remember that I haven't always loved her. I am keenly aware that there are no pictures of her before the age of 4 years old. I know that she had some time in her life before me--but, TO Me she is one of my children and I was as awestruck the moment I met her as I was with any of my children--it just happened in a different way.<br>  *|`|a095159fe0597a1cbcdff915d247b333aa	I adopted two children from overseas that were 10 and 5 (respectively) at the time of adoption.<br>  <br>  Before that first meeting, we had sent letters and photo albums to the orphanage.  Simple pictures of us, of our home, etc.  <br>  <br>  Was I nervous before the adoption?  Absolutely!  Emphatically yes!  <br>  <br>  But it turned out well.  The children recognized us from the photos and were not shy at all about meeting us.  They were very affectionate, almost jealously guarding us from the other children at the orphanage and wanted to leave for America immediately.  As in, the very minute we showed up, they asked if it was time to go to America.  <br>  <br>  It's been almost three years since that first meeting.  There's been adjustments, there's been challenges.  But nothing that I would deem "unreasonable" in fact, we were prepared for much more than we actually encountered.  It's been nothing like the more publicized story of older children from international adoption burning the house down, or killing the cat, or hurting other children, etc.  We have a very busy, often noisy and sometimes chaotic household, but I don't know anyone with three children that doesn't.  <br>  <br>  My advice to you is to really make sure that your expectations of adopting older children is reasonable.  Expect bumps in the road, sometimes small, but possibly large.  Expect that school and other "milestones" may not go the way you envision.  Expect that the child/children will come to you with a history and a life that happened before they met you, with a fully developed personality complete with quirks, likes/dislikes, etc.  Expect some backlash on occasions, some anger, some distrust.    Put aside all of the expectations that you had for your bio child at that age.  Parent to the child, not the age.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you.

They are two different substances.<br>  Crystal meth is by far the most dangerous of the two, it alters your brain, and makes you feel that you need to be doing something or working constantly- this is why some employers in Vietnam and other Asian countries give their employees. Crystal meth produces more of the chemical in your brain which creates the feeling of pleasure. It can sometimes make it impossible for you tel feel pleasure without the drug.<br>  Crystal meth causes conditions such as 'meth mouth', where you teeth become black and rotten, due to poor oral hygiene- because meth users dont spend money on toothbrushes, toothpaste, ect and a lack of saliver because meth stunts the production of saliver (spit).<br>  Crystal meth is also known as ice, speed, and it's more technical name Methamphetamine.<br>  I'm sorry, but I don't know as much about heroin except that it is a drug in powder form. <br>  Check out the sources for some extra information.<br>  Hope I helped!

AA11120998	ITs normal for baby's to be head down at this point. When you get that feeling that its in your rib cage and chest its normal that's letting you know that it is stretching. I have those all the time I am 38 weeks and also my First baby start been head down around the 6 month more naturally 7month.That says that your baby is getting positioned for labor. The contractions also mean your tired or she moving lot when you really get bad contractions that are 5min apart then that's when you got to be concerned. At this point all you have to do is take it easy relax, because stress is bad and wait for that joyful day!!! Trust me I ve had all that and its nothing to be alarmed about. But if you have any questions look up the phone number of were you are going to give birth and ask to be connected to obgyn they will send you to traige and get you connected personally to a doctor and you can ask any questions or concerns.|`|53c98641fa37351a0f3c0769f6fd7ddbaa	well considering the fact that u have been in pre term labour 3 times, i would say u can see ur doctor for ur concern. its not really true that once the baby drops its not much longer. my baby has been in a head down position since 35 weeks and i am right now 39 weeks and 3 days and still waiting for labour to start. so there is no proof on that but do get an appointment..make sure it wont be too much pelvic pressure for u.|`|wphI41wNaa	Seems like you just dropped I dropped early and had to be induced because she didn't want to come out so don't worry about it if your not feeling real contractions and your water hasn't broke every things fine if your  worried call your doctor|`|HoonZJMgaa	Although I am a mother of six children and pregnant with number seven, each pregnancy is extremely different so I am not claiming to be a pro. But I have experienced this also with my first and he just settled down there and stayed until labor came on at 38 weeks. I don't think there's any reason to worry unless you are in extreme pain or having regular contractions. She just dropped and it is normal. Try to keep your feet elevated and enjoy those kicks.(which may be punches at times) Congratulations on the little blessing and enjoy your next 10 or so weeks!|`|pqlhPnexaa	It sounds like what's happened is your baby shifted downward or possibly changed position altogether (perhaps she's shifting out of the head down position?)<br>  <br>  Either way, I would recommend you go on modified bed rest until she arrives, especially taking into account your ptl. Try to avoid pressure to your stomach/abdomen as much as possible, and spend as much time on your back/side and as little standing up as you can possibly manage.<br>  <br>  Good luck--- I wish you and your baby all the best!|`|LQpU6Zd8aa	when I was pregnant with my daughter my on/gyn told me it was fine if she dropped anywhere from week 30 on. She dropped at week 31 and it freaked me out. I included a few links for you. But if you have questions just give your doctor a call and ask him or his nurse. Don't be afraid to ask them they deal with this as a profession and I'm quite sure they have answered this for other mothers to be.
u8Km1J3Gaa	My daughter had this problem. I was using cradle cap shampoo and it was making her hair very static. I changed her shampoo and since not had a problem.<br>  I changed to Tesco Baby Shampoo (not their value range but the one that looks like Johnson's), and has since not had any static.<br>  <br>  My daughter also has eczema and this shampoo has not flared it up. I also use Comfort Pure as a conditioner for her clothes.|`|ZZzQLjaKaa	My daughter's hair is the same way! I have tried all of the same things you have but at the end of the day I have started using a tiny amount of gel. It weighs it down enough so that she does not have the "fly aways" as we call them. Good Luck!|`|b5b66daf9000f9fad7995e12ed98517eaa	I use Fairy Tales brand leave in conditioner on my two year old.

The three year old that I babysit for has CURLY hair, and she has the same problem whenever her hair is pulled back.  That is what her mom uses and it works great.<br>  Another thing that I've heard, but never tried, is rubbing a fabric softner sheet on your hair to reduce static.  Worth a try I guess?<br>  <br>  Hope this helps =)|`|PrxlHUT5aa	probably a tinsy drop of leave-on conditioner or baby oil :o)|`|3F8f1SoQaa	try spraying some static guard for clothes on her hairbrush  before you brush her hair. My daughter had very long hair at that age and it had lots of static too. A friend of mine who owns a salon told me to spray static guard on her head ( and in her hats) like it was hairspray.<br>  <br>  this is off topic, but my friend has a 3.5 year old with BAD eczema and she discovered by accident that dandruff shampoo in the bathwater helps with itching.

4Bgw5xs8aa	Well, when he does poop is it hard and a dark color? Is he like making sounds like he's in pain or crying while he's pushing it out? How often does he have a bowel movement? I can't answer your question without knowing these details.<br>  <br>  BUT, if he's acting like he's in pain when he goes, it's hard and in a ballish shape, if it's super dark brown, and he only goes every few days..then yes he probably is. <br>  <br>  Baby cereal is known to constipate babies. You could switch from rice cereal to barley or oat which is known to be a little better. OR you could just start right on with stage one veggies. I'm assuming your baby is at least 4 months and you've had the go ahead from him or her ped to start solids. If not, then maybe your baby's digestive system isn't ready for solids yet. Maybe stop and try back in a few weeks? It's best to ask the baby's doctor though. The doc will know what's best for YOUR baby's needs since she/he knows your baby well.|`|846b3af290613f2b0cdb0b7edc68ce91aa	Chances are...yes.  My girl had it badly as a baby and it had nothing to do with foods.  Just a digestion issue she did grow out of.  But while she had the problem, her Dr. told me to give her pear juice/water.  If your just introducing cereal, then your baby's-what?- 4 months or so?  Give him 1/8 juice to water in 6 oz bottle.  increase to 1/4 if it doesn't work the first day.  But it probably will.  My girl was going normal within 2 hours after drinking her first bottle of it.  I gave it to her 1-3 times daily until she was about a year old, then she finally was able to go all day with no pear juice and would still be able to go normally.  She liked it though, so I would still let her have some here and there.  You do have to increase the amount some as they grow, so adjust according to weight.  1/4 juice to every 10lbs up to 20lbs, then 1/2 for every 10lbs after that.  Unless absolutely necessary, do not give more than 3 bottles spread out over a day/per day.  It could bring on the opposite problem, though it would be temporary.  It worked wonders with my girl and I still use it now when any of mine get constipated.  it's the safest, most natural way to loosen without stimulant or suppositories.<br>  <br>  Try it at least and see how she does.  The other moms I've suggested it to have had results very quickly.  Hope it helps and good luck.|`|K6q6YvJWaa	Almost all babies have a difficult time transitioning from milk to solids.  Try watering the cereal down a bit more for her and try giving her more fluids.  Rub her belly gently and move her legs to help.  If she's having serious issues and hasn't gone in a while, contact your pediatrician and they will tell you if she needs more help then that.|`|2LKABDPzaa	Cereal and other grains are generally harder to digest than breast milk. Since you've been giving your baby cereal for a while now, try adding some applesauce and see what happens. As long as you are still giving your baby milk and he's got wet diapers, he should have enough fluids.|`|6AvVVzsnaa	If he struggling to poop, like making a grunting sound and when he's fussy and won't go to sleep. The cereal must have been too thick for him to take, make it a little thinner like soupy.|`|TvYX1yXWaa	if its pretty hard poop then he is getting constipated . my sons going through the same thing i gave him 2 oz of purine mix with 2 oz of water and hes doing better
53c98641fa37351a0f3c0769f6fd7ddbaa	well i should tell u that i am also 39 weeks and 3 days pregnant and there is no sign of baby coming anytime soon. this is my second and my first was a normal delivery with me going into labour on his due date on my own. i have lost hope that this one will come on its own so i am seeing my doctor on friday and most probably get an induction date. not very exciting but i feel like i am going to explode now.  the due date is just a predictor of when u might have it. its not always accurate. best of luck|`|8Rn2pX4jaa	I had a pretty big discrepancy between my LMP due date and my U/S due date.  The due date was figured at 8 weeks, which is considered very accurate.  We have been using that due  throughout this pregnancy.  (Ironically, the U/S at 20 weeks was exactly the same as my LMP date... but sadly that date has passed and I am still prego!)<br>  <br>  With my first, I never lost my mucus plug.  Or I never realized that I lost my mucus plug.  So you may not witness that splendid event.  I have been having the same issues as you for the last three weeks.  False labor, prodromal labor, lots of BH contractions and yet I have not started labor yet at 41 weeks.  I am sure there are lots of women who have the exact same symptoms and go into labor within a few days.<br>  <br>  The best judge, is your doctor.  When I started having these issues, he told me that he still thought we were a ways away.  Despite the fact that I didn't want to hear that, he has been right on!<br>  <br>  If you are having contractions and false labor, I would think that you are closer to your LMP date.  Considering you had a C-section the first time, are you going to have a C-section this time?   That should make it  a little bit easier for determining your leave.  My doctor claimed that U/S after 12 weeks are not as accurate as LMP.  <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|AA11120998	It doesnt matter if it is march 13 or march 20. You should of been out since the moment you turned 9 months you get a full month or 2months out of work because you have to get lots of rest for labor. Get lots of rest and stop stressing everything  is going to be fine all you have to do is ask for those 2months or a month. If the baby is due in the 13 they will make away to make him/her come out. either way you have to have your rest...|`|o4bGz45Iaa	If you want the baby to come have sex and then go on a walk. With my first baby I started going into labor at 36 weeks because of a hurricanene sthat'sts what the doc told me to do. what ever is in the *** is what the use tsoftenen the cervix to start labor, so go have some fun and have your bundle of joy good luck.|`|Wv2mOlQwaa	i just had my second, and i too had all the questions you have. i never saw a mucous plug this time around, and go with the first due date they gave you . its easier to know when their smaller. mine was  3days before the first due date they gave me. and  i thought i was going to go past my due date because i didnt have no contractions or mucous plug coming or nothing. the only sign i had was a little blood 2 hrs before baby arrived . thats why i headed to the hosp and on the way i started to have bad contractions. just walk alot. i started to walk only 2 wks before. good luck|`|lxF2hvisaa	The second one is more accurate, b/c it gets sent to someone who specializes in that kind of thing. It's frustrating i know, but they changed my due date three times! and the third one ended up being the closest. Each baby comes at their own time, and you are more likely to carry the second child longer than the first. I assume you are going to the doctor once a week? How dilated are you? All i can tell you is that when it is time you WILL know...sometimes you won't notice the plug falling out, sometimes you will. With my second my water broke in my sleep, and the next morning i had to be induced. There were never any contractions beyond braxton hicks every once in a while for the last month. Good luck! i know you are probably ready lol.
pp9RzHvDaa	It just means that you have so much hCG now that the test line is soaking up all the dye and the control line is barely getting any.  It's normal!  Just means you're getting more pregnant by the day!  Congrats!|`|AA10526033	um i dont know but that answer above doesnt sound right. i didnt find out i was pregnant until 3 months with my first 2 (irregular periods) and hpts worked just fine. i was about 7 wks with my 3rd and they were actually faint lines until about 8 wks. im sure everything is fine though congrats!
TjJZqsN5aa	yeh i think this is the first stage of labor for you!!<br>  <br>  CONGRATUALTIONS HOW EXCITING!!|`|h0nfy6VXaa	The shocking pain was most likely your gastro-intestinal tract shutting down.  This happens when labor begins, so yes, this is probably it!  And just to let you know, just in case this is your first baby, that really terrible shocking pain....NOTHING compared to real contractions so don't be afraid to get an epidural.|`|leHQQX4paa	Congrats hunny your going to have your baby!!!!|`|1CryEnb3aa	I hope you have your hospital bag ready.  Sounds like you are beginning labour.  Congrats!|`|AA12275027	it sounds like pre-labor!  i think your baby is on the way!!!
7e700825133cf6328b412b5715dc6692aa	As you can tell i have a child with autism <<<Thomas is 10 and has severe autism, his twin sister Kylie doesn't have autism, its uneducated people like Alexis here whom has no idea what so ever even what autism is its a developmental disorder nothing to do with what you do as a parent like she says 'Potty training' what a joke.. Nothing has been proved in the cause of autism but could be gene's could be the brain during or after birth, i do not believe autism is caused by vaccines for one Kylie had the vaccine she is fine and i know a lot of children whom have not had the vaccine yet still have autism, as for the little girl i am not sure about her having autism but she has been socially isolated from people therefore this would mimic autistc behaviours because she wouldn't know how to act or react to others as autistic children do|`|lGcpXteaaa	That littles girls autistic behaviour was very clearly been caused by her mother keeping her in that horrible environment with no human contact.|`|prqrQcd1aa	Seeing as they have no definate cause of austism as of yet.. I'm going to have to say that I'm not really shure!<br>  <br>  There are some other disorders that "mimic" the symptoms of autism.. However there is not any hard scientific proof that genitics, vaccinations and so on are the sole cause of it, but rather a mixture of several things, the causes of autism are still a theory, there is NO factual evidence that says one thing or another causes it solely. <br>  <br>   I've attached a web site that can give you more information.|`|AA11887900	Autism is genetic, but children can develop "autistic behaviors" due to mistreatment or other outside factors. My older son is genetically autistic. For a while we thought my younger son was also autistic, but it turned out he was modeling his behavior on his older brother. Once they were separated for preschool and my younger son had "normal" peer models, his autistic symptoms disappeared very quickly.<br>  <br>  The girl on Oprah can probably recover some of her social abilities through therapy (she seems to be progressing at nearly a normal rate, but 7 years late), a truely autistic child can never gain true social abilities, though some autistics can learn through therapy called "social stories" to recognize and mimic social rules and "appear" normal.<br>  <br>  It is also possible the girl was already autistic, the mother just made it worse. The sensory thing is very much a trait of true (genetic) autism.<br>  <br>  Also, her bio-mother has an IQ of 77... 80 is "retarded." She shouldn't have been raising children on her own, or at all. There is a good chance the girl is genetically retarded and wouldn't be much better, even without the horrid treatment.|`|5gKg5S0vaa	I'm not sure it can cause autism but it can have devastating effects.  <br>  <br>  Hampering your child's development and denying them human and social interaction has some serious consequences that can effect them for the rest of their lives, visit the links below:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feral_children" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feral_child...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.feralchildren.com/en/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.feralchildren.com/en/index.ph...</a><br>  <br>  It hasn't been proven that Autism is genetic, for those who have claimed that it is, like a lot of mental illness we haven't found out the causes yet.<br>  <br>  Read the comments made by Andrew Tao who comments that these feral children who are neglected and prevented from socialising with humans do exhibit symptoms very similar to autism but also display symptoms that are in fact the opposite to those with autism.|`|AA11997524	That's neglect, not autism.  The spectrum is so broad with Autism, I do feel a lot of children are misdiagnosed.|`|MPJI4APBaa	No.  It's been well established for almost 50 years that autism is not related to environment.  Think of all the autistic children with non-autistic families, as well as the families of autistic children who do everything they can to stimulate their child's growth.  What you are describing is not autism.|`|WXAkvhImaa	The behaviors you're describing are social handicaps, not autism.<br>  <br>  Autism is a genetic defect, cause by mutations in dNA
WW4veUJSaa	I believe you took the test too soon. One week after conception is not enough time for the hormone to build up in your body and be detected unless you are purchasing a very sensitive test which are usually not over the counter or getting a blood test from your doctor. <br>  <br>  Wait until the day your period would normally start. If it does not arrive, re-test. If you receive a negative but still have no period, wait 24 hours and try again in the morning, for your first urine.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|XrKviWgSaa	yeah it actually normally takes around 3/4 weeks for you to get a true positive with a hpt but a blood test is usually able to tell around 2 weeks from the hormone levels
igbdywwVaa	My experience has been that I can get positive results 1-2 days prior to my period. Sometimes they can be really light but if there are 2 lines (and you try 2 different brands) then you are PREGNANT! Test again about 3 days later and they should be much darker. <br>  <br>  If you're not regular, it can be a bit more challenging to know when to test. If you don't mind "wasting" a few, you could start testing about a week or so after intercourse and then try again every 5 days or so...either until you get your period or a postive result! <br>  <br>  I became pregnant only 1 week before my period was due this past fall so there was very little wait time! I miscarried that pregnancy and had a D&C at the end of December. Since I wasn't sure when I'd get my next period (my OB said 6-8 weeks) I still went on the assumption that I'd get my period in 4 weeks (as though the D&C was the first day of my last menses) and sure enough, I tested positive a day or two before I was suppose to get "my period". I guess I could have not been so agressive in testing but I didn't want to end up being pregnant for 2 months and not know (and initially I really didn't feel pregnant at all and didn't have any of the normal "I'm pregnant" signs so I'm glad I went with my gut and not my doc's advice otherwise I might have had a few cocktails etc. over that period of time).<br>  <br>  Sorry this ended up being so long lol!

fUK9y3Qkaa	First of all rinsing right after sex DOES not decrease your chances of getting pregnant.<br>  <br>  Second the PULL OUT METHOD doesn not work AT ALL! Precum is the reason why!<br>  <br>  Third if you got a negative at your doctor's office more that likely your not pregnant. Next week when you go back and take the other test you will know for sure!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Last but not least what the hell is up with everyone's english!!!|`|xq7S9H5Raa	it's too early to know if you are pregnant.  Wait and see.|`|WmKjeUELaa	Ok, first of all, the pull out method doesn't work because semen is still found in pre-ejaculate.  Also, rinsing out your vagina can actually cause the semen to go deeper inside you, so that won't help.<br>  <br>  If you have been to the doctor and the test came back negative, chances are you arn't pregnant but I would wait a week or so and go get another test done.|`|YMRYS98maa	go buy pregnancy test kit at guardian/pharmacy/some 7eleven also can find. solve half of your problem. the other half u just pray.|`|PNUViTWMaa	Go to your doctor and get a blood test, she cant deny you anything...|`|5c9dd0cbb0fb2382e8b5e3d4f85171ebaa	relax you are safe

I don't even get one anymore.<br>  if she is worried about the string she just needs to check for them herself (you can do it) or she can go to the doctor.  Personally, I can't reach that far up myself to check for the strings and I just plain don't want to, honestly.  Every few months I go to the doc to make sure it's there and everything is good to go.<br>  Right after I had my IUD put in I freaked because of pain and the strings issue.<br>  Don't worry.

I have the same IUD and my husband has not felt mine, also it says that your period will be very lite and then pretty much go away....I wouldnt stress about it but she could take a test to ease your worries|`|DS21ekeJaa	The Mirena IUD does not have a string. Here is their website:<br>  <a href="http://www.mirena-us.com/index" rel="nofollow">http://www.mirena-us.com/index</a><br>  IUD's can cause late periods, spotting, cramping, sometimes tubal pregnancies. They do not stop the egg from being fertilized, but they stop the fertilized egg from being implanted in the uterine wall. The guy will not feel it during sex.|`|wphI41wNaa	I have mirena sometimes you can feel the strings like when its first put it in but after having sex my BF pushed them up, they are hard to notice sometimes too and I no longer feel them but my doctor said thats okay. Everyone I knew who got it bleed for two months then their periods stopped thats what its supposed to do stop it for 5 years so everything should be fine. Shes supposed to check it every month and see if she can feel the strings but thats hard to do. Have her call her doctor if she thinks she prego but mirenas supposed to be better then getting your tubes tied so I doubt she is.

Like in spanish, beautiful is "bello"  you could change it to bella.  Or Adah and Shana mean beauty in hebrew.

Sad.|`|dNJG3EDCaa	yeah, it sort of frightening. This is oene of the major reasons why STI's ar coming back aswell. They are doing it way to early and without protection.|`|jNErU39iaa	What really scares me is people who refer to being pregnant as 'prego.'<br>  <br>  Ew.|`|h0nfy6VXaa	I answered a recent question asked by a 12 year old about how she was pregnant and wanted to kill herself.  I said some sarcastic things thinking it was a joke and I got reported and received a nasty letter from the lil tyke telling me off.  Even if it isn't real, these kid's parents should have more to say in their kid's lives.  whether it's monitoring their sexual behavior, or internet-appropriate behavior, I don't think allowing your child to blab about their middle school pregnancy sets a very good example for other young people.|`|diGNKZZtaa	Yeah. But you have to think about it,some of them,13+,have had to pretty much raise theirself or come from homes where they don't have anybody who cares about them. I'm 23 and I've been in those situations where I had no one to sit me down,tell me no,stop me from making mistakes. I tried to get pregnant twice(at 13 and at 15) because I THOUGHT I was ready. I wanted someone to love and care for because I had no one really. Now I'm thankful I didn't because I'm about to graduate from college(something I NEVER would've accomplished if I had had a baby at that young age),have been with my b/f for years,have a steady job.

kRaVa0Wraa	try the homework section...or try reading it yourself. seriously. i read it and i loved it. i also read the odyssey.
8t8NjjnVaa	My girl hated being on her tummy too and as a result, she pushed up on her arms, rolled over, and crawled a little later than the average.<br>  <br>  Either way, it's nothing to worry about.  He'll get to it when he's good and ready.  It's not that he's lazy or 'slow', he just hates being on his stomach and therefore hasn't had the time to really learn how to roll yet.  It's not a big deal.  It's not like it's going to cause some major delay in the rest of his development :)<br>  <br>  Crawling usually doesn't happen until quite a bit past 6 months.  Or he may go straight to walking.  He'll do what he wants when he's comfortable with it.  Just go with the flow and he'll do things when he's ready.  He's not lazy or "slow", he's just following his own timechart, not yours :)|`|rAkWoweOaa	My baby is the same way. I'm not sure what to expect.|`|ArDBlPKYaa	I don't think it's laziness - every baby is different and each one is fascinated by different things, therefore having different priorities.<br>  My 14-month old didn't crawl until he was 12 months old, and he CAN walk, but just chooses not to.  I may never know the reason why!<br>  His priorities are in studying objects and watching animals.  He doesn't seem to care much about getting around and has no interest in baby DVDs.  Go figure!|`|50fDeNWXaa	My son was a little over 6 months before he rolled over for the first time. It was actually a few hours after we left the doctor and I had asked about him being so late for rolling over. He started crawling at 9 months old. He is 13 months old and is STILL crawling. He isn't walking yet on his own, but he will if he holds your hand. You son isn't lazy, he is just behind on his physical things. My son is really behind too, but its ok they are healthy and happy babies!!! Thats all that matters, don't worry about it.|`|427abcdfcd8e012fe37537ef1426e40faa	Oh, hon, he's only 6 months old.  Babies typically don't crawl until 7-9 months old, so he's got a while yet.  I remember that I freaked out with my first, too, thinking she should already be crawling at that point (and she hated her tummy, too).  She crawled at 9 months and walked at  13.<br>  <br>  My younger two were never that fond of tummy time either, and none of my kids rolled more than a few times.  My middle child crawled at 8 months and walked at 11 months.  My youngest crawled at 7 months and walked at 10 months.<br>  <br>  No worries at all.  Keep trying tummy time, but don't stress if he's not that into it yet.|`|ydy6W0sXaa	When did you start giving your son tummy time?  You're supposed to start early.<br>  <br>  Is your son at least raising his head and changing directions?<br>  <br>  Raising the head and changing directions are supposed to be "landmark" events in child development along with events like smiling, putting the hands together, acting shy, and etc.|`|6SstJ0sdaa	First, I'd check if his back is strong enough. Perhaps he is out of alignment and fusses because he hurts. You may want to consider checking with a pediatric chiropractor. <br>  <br>  But most babies don't like being on their tummies. Make sure he gets some tummy time every day. Toys placed strategically just out of reach help them to reach out and scoot. He will start moving in his own time. Babies really do develop at their own pace. Don't get in a hurry for him because your worries will be sensed by him and interpreted as not pleasing you. Babies need LOTS of encouragement and praise! Be excited for him rolling over with a nudge. Lots of clapping and cheering. He'll come along.
syrh8J6Vaa	Take a test when your period is due.  I got pregnant while on the pill and had never missed a dose or taken my pill late.  My main symptom was being so tired I could barely move.  Good luck hun.
srl4RiaVaa	I agree with the changing table winning, except that the shelving under them was useful! The one thing that I will add as being very useless to me was the wipe warmer, and the reason for this is when u have a very active baby, u just kinda have to change them where ever u can get ur hands on them and get them to sit still long enough to change them and the wipe warmer had to be stationed to an outlet, which was only appropriate to me at the time to place on the changing table in the bedroom where I had full intentions of always changing her! LOL So since that was rarely the occasion it soon became a very useless item!|`|T1q4GWLkaa	The baby bath, probably.  In the beginning we gave her sponge baths until her cord stump fell off and since then through now at five months, I just take her in the bath or shower with me, because it is so much faster.  Once she is big enough to sit up consistently and help wash herself, she'll probably go in the big bath by herself.  The only thing I use it for right now is for her to sit in while I dry off, so I don't slip on our wood floors when I walk down the hall to her room to get her dressed.  I think I have used it as a baby bath less than ten times and she has gotten a bath almost every day since her umbilical cord fell off.  I guess it might have been useful if we used it in the kitchen sink, but between having dishes in it and the sink being a bit wide (the tub barely stays in and only one direction), it's practically useless.<br>  <br>  Edit:  I should note that I didn't buy a lot of stuff like a wipe warmer or bottle warmer, because I helped my mom raise my three younger siblings and didn't see those things as necessary.|`|VbdBxVLvaa	The Diaper Genie!  That thing Sucks!

hzgFAJv0aa	Dear KA,<br>  <br>  There are adoption agencies who handle adult adoptions but they are really something that can be handled through a probate court. In most cases they can be completed without a lawyer.<br>  <br>  States have different laws pertaining to adult adoption and people need to know the statutes for their location. Simply call the local probate attorney or Probate Court Clerk to get the information for your area. Many states even offer the necessary forms and instructions on their State Court/Justice Website.<br>  <br>  Here are some links about adult adoption that I think are pretty informative:<br>  <a href="http://www.adoptingback.com/us_law.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.adoptingback.com/us_law.html</a><br>  <a href="http://adoption.about.com/od/typesofadoption/a/adultadopt.htm" rel="nofollow">http://adoption.about.com/od/typesofadop...</a><br>  <a href="http://adopting.adoption.com/child/adopting-an-adult.html" rel="nofollow">http://adopting.adoption.com/child/adopt...</a><br>  <br>  Sadly, many people who age out of foster care never find families. Too many kids age out and are left to fend for themselves with no support. Many end up homeless, poverty stricken or struggling to survive. They are forced to make choices that many people would never dream of and they have to work harder and without support than other people. It is unfair and a poor reflection on our society. There are organizations to help and support these kids but more needs to be done to ensure that these HUMAN BEINGS are not forgotten and discarded simply because they have reached legal majority.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.fostercarealumni.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.fostercarealumni.org/</a><br>  <a href="http://orphan.org/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://orphan.org/index.php</a><br>  <a href="http://www.charityguide.org/volunteer/fewhours/age-out.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.charityguide.org/volunteer/fe...</a><br>  <br>  ETA: If you Google "Adult Adoption" you will get hits for agencies that handle adult adoption. I am not aware of any that specialize in it as a service other than just facilitating the paperwork (and probably charging insane fees to do it.) I can not find one with anything proactive, such as "matching" adults with families or recruiting perspective parents.|`|2wyDALHgaa	Not that I've ever heard of.  Once a child is over 18 then they are on their own.  Yes, someone can do an adult adoption if they want or they can take the easy road and just change their name to match a family they may want to join (and who wants him/her to join them).  Other then that, there is nothing I am aware of.|`|yDWcYXl5aa	At that age, consensual adoption takes place, usually between people who know each other, and the lawyers handle it.<br>  <br>  Let's face it, agencies wouldn't make a lot of money at it, and there's their incentive.|`|CsiyXDy9aa	yeah I really think that If I don't get my kids back then may be God may want htis for them.
wphI41wNaa	No because your under age. Your to young for a baby I had my baby at 17 and it's hard and a childs for life just because you want a baby doesn't mean your ready for one|`|AA10526033	i know you dont wanna hear it but just wait. its not all fun in games happy family time. i had my first at 17. though i made it out ok i have never been able to give her all i want to. plus she was preemie with some health problems that are common in teenage pregnancies. for the sake of yourself and your child wait. the fact you want one now when you arent ready physically, emotionally and financially proves you are too young, immature and irresponsible to be a parent.
277f88461e1df8f316c52c480977aaa6aa	I absolutely love these, gdiapers.  You can get the starter kits at babies r us or most organic places, amazon, and off the website, and others. You can also go to the gdiapers website and search for your area for store locations.  The disposable liners are cheaper if you get them off of amazon.com and it's free shipping.  That's the least expensive place i've found so far for them. The starter kits off of gdiapers are $26.99plus shipping.  and on amazon it's $26.99 with free shipping.  The starter kits have two g pants (one vanilla bean and one orange), 4 of the waterproof liners, 10 refills, and one swishstick.  for the refills you can get them off the gdiapers website for $14.49 for one pack or $52.00 for four packs plus shipping. smalls have 40 refills and med/lrg have 32. on amazon you can get four packages for $52.00 with free shipping and you can get an additional 15% off with their subscribe and save. which is the way i do it.|`|mSt1LGfjaa	i love them,,the baby doesnt get diaper rashes witht the cloth,but it was years ago since i bought any,but here is a link to help you.the only thing you got alot of washing to do,,but it is so much better for them i think.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&ie=UTF-8&rlz=1T4GWYE_enUS268US269&q=where+to+buy+cloth+diapers" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=na...</a>|`|c23e2e9ba321447351d3dc720a353187aa	I use gdiapers which are a cloth outer pant with a snap in liner and then you use flushable 100% biodegrable inserts with them.  It costs the same about as disposables month to month but actually buying the gpants is pretty expensive.  <br>  <br>  I didn't want to go full cloth for many reasons, one being convenience the other being that I don't like to use bleach or play around in my toilet.  The water and chemicals used to wash cloth diapers are actually nearly as costly and harmful to the environment as dispoables.<br>  <br>  I do prefer the disposables because they are MUCH more convenient, easier to change, and don't smell as much as a dirty cloth diaper does, but I'm trying to do my part.<br>  <a href="http://www.gdiapers.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.gdiapers.com</a>|`|AA11903503	I use them all the time, morning noon and night.

For a little while I was using cloth and disposables, but switched to only cloth because the disposable became more of a hassle.<br>  I have 24 pre-folds (4 covers), and 18 pocket diapers that I use.

The only problem with the cloth is that you can't used them the whole time.  Every day till say 6 months, then they can't handle the overnight load, so you'll need the pamper variety at night, then eventually, the pampers for the day.  But it is all about making a difference right, it all helps.|`|gr9LD68eaa	The woman that I babysit for uses cloth diapers, and to be honest, I really prefer them to the regular kind.  Very absorbent, no leaking, no diaper rashes, and better for the environment!  She says with her two daughters she has saved hundreds by using cloth rather than regular diapers.  She uses a few different kinds.  One is called chinese prefolds, and basically you just fold them in half twice.  You have to use a pair of rubber/vynil type thing on the outside of the prefolds.  The other kind that she uses is called knicker nappies, and that is the kind I prefer.  They have adjustable snaps on the sides, so that they kind of "grow" with your baby.  All you do is put them on like a regular diaper, except you snap them rather than the sticky-velcro type stuff on a disposable.  The do not need the rubber/vynil thing on the outside, although you will need to buy inserts for them (there is different inserts with different absorbancy's).  I would reccommend getting the inserts with the highest level of absorbancy, that way they will last through the night without leaking!<br>  <br>  Here is the link to the knickernappies website (I couldn't find one for the chinese prefolds, but feel free to google it to see what you can find).<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.knickernappies.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.knickernappies.com/</a><br>  <br>  If you have any more questions, feel free to email me!<br>  Hope this helps  =)<br>  <br>  P.S. It is the Knickernappies 2g pocket diapers that she uses.<br>  <br>  One more thing to add!<br>  The best deal is probably for you to buy them used (and then sterilize them).  A website that sells them clearance and used is <br>  <a href="http://clothdiaperclearance.com/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://clothdiaperclearance.com/index.ph...</a><br>  <br>  Just one more thing to check out =)|`|NL42fm5Eaa	It costs about $500 to buy everything you need to use cloth diapers.   Compare this to the cost of disposables for just one year.  They are super easy to use, with snaps or velcro they work just like disposables.  We launder them every other day.  There's no need to do anything other than tip the solid waste into the toilet (it actually rolls off very easily) and then you can put the soiled diaper in a pail, with a lid, until you've collected enough for a load of laundry.  Most people buy their cloth diapering supplies from online stores because there is more choice and many people don't have access to a cloth diaper store.  <br>  We have been using cloth diapers for our baby boy since he was 6 months old because of concerns we had about chemicals in disposables affecting his health.   It simply isn't true that harmful detergents, bleaches or chemicals are needed to wash your cloth diapers.  In fact, the complete opposite is true.  To keep your cloth diapers clean and to ensure there is not build-up of odors it's essential to use only the tinest amount of soap....AND, the most effective soap product for cleaning cloth diapers is a completely, 100% natural nut, a soapnut, that is inexpensive and can be used for many washes.  <br>  Cloth diapers are cheaper in the long run, better for the environment and better for baby.  I hope this helps.<br>  <br>  You can buy soapnuts at <a href="http://www.fluffybottombabies.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.fluffybottombabies.com</a>|`|tdhpAgHraa	My mom said she used them on me when i was born back in France because most people where using them. she says they were annoying to wash tho.

Make sure they're fed and in clean diapers, rock them a bit until they look sleepy and then just leave them in the crib. Make sure you do the rocking in a dimly lit room and leave it that way when you leave (going from bright to dark is startling for babies). <br>  <br>  The first time you do this they will probably cry for a long time, maybe close to an hour but eventually they will tire out. Each time you do it consistently the time they cry will be shorter. A lot of parents feel guilty letting their babies cry but the longer you wait to let them learn self soothing the harder it will be on all of you.|`|AA10241491	First, calm down, crying wont kill them.<br>  <br>  How old are they?
UCPY4AtUaa	Whoopa$$ or Ritalin- your choice.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Let them know they'll be separated if they fight--even if that means taking turns being locked up alone in a dark basement or closet.<br>  <br>  Another way to handle this is to let them know which toys will be given away the next time they act up and stick to it.<br>  <br>  Freedoms have responsibilities... and consequences.  The kids have to learn this, one way or another.|`|zvrbrNfgaa	kids at that age fight a lot and many times they grow out of it, but many times they don't. from personal experience (i grew up the middle of 3 girls) lots of sibling rivalry is for the attention of the parents. i no longer have a relationship with my sisters and it hurts me, but i can't be near them because they don't respect me. my mother always favored them over me so they never grew to respect me. in many arguments when mom had to intervene i was the one that was "wrong" according to her. <br>  i really wish my mother would have stressed to my sisters how important it was for us to get along and to act like family. now that we're older my mother is saying that we wishes we were closer but i blame her for playing favorites while we were growing up. i always promised myself that when i have children i'll stress to them that one is NEVER more important or loved than the other. i also find that many parents are in denial about whether or not they play favorites. i'm not saying that you do, but perhaps you could ask a close friend or family member whether you treat the kids differently. if they think you do, perhaps you could start there.<br>  if that's not the case, i just suggest you continue to stress to them that no matter what they're family and in the end family is all you have. i really hope your sons don't end up like me and my sisters. *sigh*|`|3HmNEO5Gaa	They fight to get attention from you.<br>  <br>  Do they have boundaries and limitations? What consequences do they have for their behavior? Do you follow through? Do they each receive time to get positive attention from you? Do they have positive goals? What do they receive when they reach these goals?<br>  <br>  Before having them take any medication, discern how you deal with their fights and see if there are changes you can make in how you deal with their fights in the future.|`|wi6mkT30aa	Obviously these kids act like this for a reason. I'm not trying to put your down at all but kids don't treat eachother like that unless they are taught differenly.<br>  <br>  They are both VERY young still and have a chance to change into loving siblings if you are able to guide them that way.<br>  <br>  Sit down with both of them and have a serious heart to heart talk. Next time one of them hits or mistreats eachother pull him aside and ask him why he has done this? Let him answer and listen to him. Then tell him that's not nice and explain to him how that makes you feel. Sad and upset to see them two fighting. Dont' be afarid to express yoruself. Then instead of spanking (Which only makes things worse) set him in time out for a little while. After time out have a nother talk with him and explain to him that's why he was in time out, tell him to go apologize to his brother have them hug and say they love eachother.<br>  <br>  Just keeping that simple sweet brotherly love in a childs life can make them turn out to be better people.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|vOzJEog4aa	This is perfectly normal and is called sibling rivalry. Donot interfere un less it looks as though one of them might hurt the other. Try to be fair and encourage them to settle their disputes by dicussion. If you buy a gift for one of them buy a very similar gift for the other one. This is true of birth days also. I have two one and half year old twin grand nephews. They are already fighting!|`|Ff7mCzlPaa	Kids do this -- sibling rivalry.  My mother let my sisters and i battle it out most of the time, but sometimes we did get punished when it got out of hand.<br>  <br>  I suppose the best thing you can do is start taking away privileges, and stick to your guns.  Don't just threaten them, but follow through with the consequences.|`|NoFC9rtKaa	My 4 year old and 13 year old fights like cats and dogs.  You'd think with the age difference it wouldn't be that way, but....So anyway, I found that sending them both to bed early got their attention really fast.  No kids like that!  And taking away something for a long time that they both like, like TV or snacks.  And also making them stay for a long time in separate (boring) rooms where there's nothing to do.  Making them both equally miserable has been what works for me.  Good luck!|`|UhZk09GDaa	That's pretty normal since they're close in age, well you can just seperate them for a while and see what happens. See if they will miss each other. Set some rules and punishments if they misbehave as well, like if they argue, give them BOTH time out, so that it's fair. That kind of stuff..or if you're filipino, the belt or the slipper. I always say..hahahah
8Rn2pX4jaa	Don't be scared!  Honestly it is a roller coaster of emotion.  I was one of the first of my friends to have a baby, so I was getting advice from people who had last had a baby 15 to 20 years ago.  Needless to say, their memories had dimmed a bit!<br>  <br>  I was induced with my first.  I had decided that I was open to an epidural, but I was going to go as long as possible before I requested it.  They started me on petocin at 8 in the morning.  Things were going slowly.  By 6 the contractions were getting pretty intense but bearable.  The doctor broke my water at 7, told me he was going on his lunch break if I wanted my epidural I would have to speak up now or wait until after he got back.  Things weren't so bad, so I told him I would wait until he got back.  (I failed to see the smirk on his face... to this day I am sure that man didn't like me very much!)<br>  <br>  Within 20 minutes the contractions were SOOOOO intense.  It was white pain... blurred vision, nausea... unbearable.  Needless to say, when he got back an hour later... I got my epidural.<br>  <br>  All I can say.. is heaven.  It was wonderful.  If I had not gotten the epidural, I would not have made it through the delivery without a C-section because I wouldn't have had the strength to push.<br>  <br>  I actually got to sleep for a couple of hours.  The nurse would check me every hour, and finally it was time to push.  (BTW:  90% of women have a bowel movement while they are pushing but the nurses are so proficient that you may never know and it is not embarrassing!) <br>  <br>  I pushed for an hour.  His head crowned mid contraction (not necessarily normal) so I had to wait for the next contraction to push him through.  The most uncomfortable part was when I ripped, it was actually more of a stinging sensation.  Even that wasn't unbearable.  As he came out, you could literally feel him coming out.  Craziest feeling, I watched my stomach collapse like a poorly made souffle and they thrust him on my stomach.  All I could think of is he okay, is he breathing, why isn't he crying, OMG... we made him!  Then he started crying, and I was so relieved I just cried!  It was AMAZING!    After the birth, you are exhausted but you realize that you have never loved anything as much as you love that little baby sitting in your arms.<br>  <br>  Any pain or fear immediately disappears!  I did not believe it when they told me that it would, but within a few days all I could remember was how great it was.|`|XrKviWgSaa	you will be in a lot of pain, you will be checked about once an hour or every couple hours, given an IV, feel like you have to poop and you might while you are pushing.|`|o4bGz45Iaa	I loved every thing, all I can say is stay calm dont freak out and lesion to your couch and doc. Just enjoy every thing. I so miss the feeling of being pregnant i would do it in a heart beat I have 3 boys|`|53c98641fa37351a0f3c0769f6fd7ddbaa	just stay calm...i remember the pain and it was killing me but i took epidural and then everything was a breeze...|`|2pNHOCONaa	if you ever go through dysmynorrhea or however thats spelled? its more or less like that. well, actually a little more painful. its more like getting cramps on your tummy. but it comes and goes. it really differs on different moms giving birth. some dont ever feel much pain at all! while some get the pain like the cramps to an extreme.<br>  <br>  the delivery on the other hand, is amazing. lol. the doctor actually asked me if i wanted anesthesia or an epidural, where the doctor would inject it on the spine to lessen the pain.. i told her, NO WAY! i want to feel the pain. lol. but i basically just did not want my daughter to get any anesthesia in her body being so small and sensitive..<br>  when you push and its time to push, the doctor will tell you, and it will feel more or less exactly like pooping. lol. most moms actually poop giving birth, thats a fact. and when the baby comes out? it will feel like a really huge poopoo came out. and whatever pain you felt in labor?! as soon as the placenta comes out after the baby? the pain will instantly be gone! so it was well worth it for me to not have anesthesia. i went through feeling such pain, but i would never have felt such a relief if i had the injection.. and looking back? i would not have done it any other way! it gives you more confidence in yourself, that if you could go through with that? you can do anything! :) but thats upto you. if you have health issues, you need to ask your doctor about it. Good luck and just PUSH!!! :) itll be over before you know it.<br>  <br>  remember: "this too shall pass" -forgot who wrote it :)|`|89zeTQFtaa	everybody different some  say that it doesn't really hurt others say it's the worst thing ever, but for me it was painful everything about it but i think the worst was when the placenta came out  oh and sometimes they sew u down there when u get torn|`|HrDL4Njzaa	Watch a Baby Story on TLC. <br>  <br>  Just remember to be prepared for everything and consider all options. If your doing natural, consider the possibility of pain being too much and having to get an epidural. Consider the possibility of having a C-Section, as well as during birth the possibility of an assisted birth, forceps and the vacuum. If you've thought and accept all those possibilities, then if it comes down to your birth plan changing and the doc having to proceed with one of them, you'll be mentally prepared. <br>  <br>  Also, pain will be inevitable, after all you are giving birth! <br>  <br>  Just keep your eye on the prize, and everything should be fine! <br>  <br>  Congrats darling!|`|3kydegQJaa	I was kinda scared with my first son too when I was around 20-30 weeks, because that's when it's really starting to show, and when you know that it's coming, and there's no way out of doing it now.  But I  wanna tell you that I was SO unbelievably  uncomfortably miserable by 38-39 weeks that I didn't worry at all how much it hurt, I just wanted pregnancy over with! <br>  Every labor and birth is different. With my first son, I had the drugs and epideral, so I slept through most of my labor.  (yes slept) And I didn't feel the birth really at all, even though they cut of my epideral because I couldn't feel what I was doing, and it still didn't hurt.  <br>  With my second son, I didn't have drugs, just the epideral, and I still didn't feel anything.  Just a bit of pressure, when he came out.  And I'm talking a little bit, could barely feel it.  <br>  So, even though I was in labor for almost 50 hours!  (32 hours with  my first, and 17 hours with my second) I promise you that I would rather go through 200 hours of labor and births in a row, than be pregnant again!!!  <br>  Your body is made for this!  Don't be scared.  It's only a few hours, and then you'll be so busy and distracted by the baby that you won't even remember it.  There's nothing in this world that you won't do for that baby.  He's gonna be so worth any amount of pain that you may experience.  <br>  And come on, if birth was so bad, then do you really think people would have second or third children!?!  lol   You can totally do this!  <br>  I would bring your own pillow to the hospital though, to make you more comfortable.  Good luck you'll be fine, and congratulations!
OI3bf4yjaa	As sick as this whole thing is.... there's nothing you can really do. You can't magically break the two up. Even though he may be making a decision that is wrong in your eyes, he is still your father. He clearly still wants to be apart of your life because why else would he invite you to his own wedding? I think that not going to his wedding shows immaturity. (I'm not calling you immature, just your decision). I'm sure if you made a decision that your father didn't like, he'd still support you. Just sit down with him and explain how you feel. Tell him everything that you told us. I find it extremely weird how he expects you to call a woman 1 year older than you, your step mother. You should talk to him about that also... I'm sure he would understand that it makes you uncomfortable. I'm sure he understands that this WHOLE situation makes you uncomfortable.. but all you can do is accept it and move on.<br>  <br>  What would you rather have? Be upset about this, and stop talking to him. Or accepting it because he's your father, and still having a decent relationship with him. It's your decision. It's his life, and he should be allowed to live it... just like anyone else should. <br>  <br>  I personally don't think you should throw away your relationship with your dad over this. Try going to the wedding, not because you support their decision.. but because you love your dad.|`|3ijLQe5laa	let your dad live his life and dont take anything personal. as you get older you realize that your parents may do stupid things but it only makes it worse when we fight with them about it.<br>  pS  dont feel like you have to call her mom or be her friend just be respectful to her  and if she causes u problems stay away from her.|`|ATaePt5Xaa	that is gross, but if they are in love you can't interfere. <br>  I would go to the wedding, but sit on the groom side, and be nice, your dad will think more of you if you are nice.|`|u00IalCZaa	I would have to talk to him before hand. you have to be care ful though if he is happy|`|kGkUG0fKaa	I agree with the 1st answerer! he is going through some things. be there for your father and try to reach him when she is not around. ask him out to lunch, go to his job and voice your concerns. if you cannot change his mind then just deal with it. you do not have to call her step mother or even go around her. it's his life, all you can do is be his daughter who loves him.<br>  <br>  <br>  my dad's wife is not young but she is a bi-t-ch and i dislike her greatly. my father knows this which is why he and i don;t see wach other often. He made the decision to marry her, as i made my decision to not be around them.|`|UCPY4AtUaa	Hold your nose; your dad is going through a mid-life crisis.  Hope he snaps out of hit before he gets married.  <br>  or...<br>  <br>  - find allies on her side of the family who don't want a 19 yr old marrying a 'dirty old man' and take turns swarming these two until they break up.<br>  <br>  Unless your dad is loaded and she is marrying him for cash, I'd back off and let nature take it's course.|`|AA11908256	they are both consenting adults.........seems others are making choices as well.........like YOU. he knows you exist  and wants a relationship with you or you would not be invited.<br>  GO TO THE WEDDING and let him know you would like some private personal time with him. then it will be his choice|`|jGiYcSh9aa	I'm 16. My dad is 47. His girlfriend has just turned 20. She is pregnant with his baby.<br>  <br>  I know exactly how you feel.<br>  <br>  At least you don't have to live with them.|`|WXAkvhImaa	nice|`|Ff7mCzlPaa	Hon, please don't let this break your heart.. Your father is going through a mid-life crisis of mass proportions... and i know it's strange<br>  <br>  I'm also sorry your father hasn't seen the grandson in a while, also.  It's his loss, and he's making a grave mistake marrying this girl.<br>  <br>  I have nothing against the girl, but she sounds jealous, immature and if she's in some competition with you.  And i'm sure she ALSO knows the age difference is ODD.<br>  <br>  You don't have to go to the wedding if you don't want to.<br>  <br>  What would i do?  I'd gather my dignity, accept these things because i can't change them and live my life to the fullest.  You have your child to care for.  Hugs|`|lxF2hvisaa	i have been in your shoes, but not quite a huge age difference. (she was 26, he is 42) anyhow, my sister hates her and won't speak to her- (she is 22) because she is not very nice to our two little brothers...but we both went to the wedding. She hated me for the longest time, and i was always nice to her...Recently she has been very good, and we are starting to get along much better...and she really loves my son. No real good advice here, just sharing some personal experience. In the end your Dad will do what he wants to do, (you cant stop him) and you have to decide if it is worth it to constantly fight to have a relationship with him or not.|`|wi6mkT30aa	I am so sorry hon! Parents like this that choose their partner over their children just really puzzle me. <br>  <br>  If it was me I would honestly NOT go. If the only time he wants to see you is to show off his new wife at the wedding then what's the point of going? It sounds like a waste of time to me. Plus I'd be pissed off at him and not even bother talking to him. If he feels or gets the point then I'd let him know why you're doing this. I wouldn't hold anything back and tell him how you really feel. DO it before the wedding maybe you have a chance of changing his mind. <br>  <br>  good luck hon! Sorry about the hard times right nwo I hope things change for the better for you.|`|prqrQcd1aa	Damn i wish my cousin were here. She went through the same thing that you did. Her new "step mom" is only a year or two older than her.<br>  <br>  We call this the mid life crisis.. I call it kinda gross myself. It's put a big rift in the relationship between my cousin and her father (my uncle) My suggestion to you would to just sit down with dad if you can and tell him how you feel. If you can't do that then maybe write him a letter and send it to him, explaining how you feel!
IXBl5l5kaa	You need to talk to a medical professional.<br>  <br>  And the father of the child not being there is no reason to get rid of your baby. You could surely raise this child and make his bum pay child support :)|`|lGcpXteaaa	Just because a man isnt in your life doesnt mean you cannot take care of a baby. Thats your child in there...not just some nuisance...<br>  Be strong, are you that dependant on a man??<br>  You will be glad you gave your child a chance at life. <br>  <br>  Abortion is just another way to get away with murder basically. <br>  <br>  <br>  Have you thought of adoption if you really cant imagine having a baby right now. <br>  Oh and if you say that you couldnt possibly adopt your child to a hopeful couple..you couldnt possibly kill him/her could you?|`|Zbn8A7Geaa	If the only reason you're considering this is because of the father, you should seriously consider giving the child up for adoption.  I'm pro-choice, but even so I couldn't condone abortion in this situation and at this late stage in the pregnancy.  Sounds like you tried to trap the guy and it didn't work and now you're trying to rid yourself of the consequences. While it's not illegal to have an abortion at 4 months, you may have a difficult time finding a doctor to perform the procedure, at least in the area where you live. Unlike first trimester abortions, second trimester abortions require a procedure that can only be done by a doctor, not clinic technicians or nurses.  And many doctors would only do so if it were medically necessary (life threatening to the mother or something was wrong with the baby).|`|FgAPXhVRaa	You can legally, but if I were you I would give it up or keep it. I know this might sound harsh but who cares if you are number two in his life, he obviously does not deserve you or that precious baby you are carrying. Trust me, My ex told me that me and my baby girl would never be in his life. He told me that we could be friends though if I would have an abortion... I told him to kiss my ***. It's not about you any more it's about that little life growing inside you and it may be hard... I take that back... it WILL be hard, but it made it really easy for me the first time my little girl kicked me. She is so apart of me now, that I have forgotten what a life was like with my ex. All I see is me and her. Please consider what I am saying. It ultimately is your choice but just because you cannot have the guy, does not mean that you were given something so much better!!!|`|Uy8ntukjaa	Its illegal, too late to abort. Why would you blame your child for who their father is? Its not the baby's fault he is a creep. Why don't you just give him/her up for adoption if you don't feel ready to be a mother? There are tons of women out there desperate to adopt babies.|`|OI3bf4yjaa	Nope...abortions are illegal after 12 weeks. There are other options. Why not just setting the baby up for adoption? It can still live a happy life with parents that will love it. Don't punish the child for your mistakes.|`|ByoYmFsBaa	This is coming from someone who is 100% pro-choice... why would you wait until 4 months along to make this decision? And on top of that, it's based on the decision that the man won't be in the picture?<br>  So if he were to decide to stick around, you would keep it? That's no reason to terminate, no man should have this power over what you do with your baby and your life.<br>  <br>  Honey, you're too far along. Give the baby to a couple who wants to raise a child. You're simply too far along to reconcile this within yourself. You're probably just shaken up after hearing the news, but you can't decide to abort the baby based on what this man is doing with his life. Good luck, and I'll be thinking of you.|`|2NRCJgq2aa	Surgical (D&E) abortion - you're past the cutoff point for an aspiration abortion.  4 months is 16 weeks.<br>  <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-topics/abortion-4260.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-...</a><br>  <br>  You're almost halfway there.  I'd suggest talking to a counselor; being upset over something you've been told by the father who's getting married (surely this wasn't a surprise) is not a good framework for making a major life decision.<br>  <br>  Abortion is NOT murder.<br>  "the crime of unlawfully killing a person especially with malice aforethought"|`|6fiYhtACaa	Please don't. For your sake and your baby's sake. If you don't want to keep the baby please consider adoption. I'm sure you are hurting quite a bit right now, but an abortion will not make this better. In fact, it just might make it worse. Cut this guy out of your life and get some legal counsel. You can get child support and get on with your life and meet someone worthwhile who doesn't treat you so miserably. Please give this alot of thought and don't act out of spite for him. I wish you luck.|`|Wv2mOlQwaa	pleeeeeeeeeeease  dont abort your baby forget about that loser you dont need him. please dont even think that i have two kids and i know that your baby will bring a lot of happiness in your life. if you believe in God you should know that he is giving you a gift - the gift of life. your living a miracle because god is creating a baby inside of you with two eyes, two ears, a mouth, a heart, a brain, lungs  everything he needs to live and you are rejecting hes gift. <br>             please re think that and if you still dont want your baby at least make someone else happy with your baby and put him for adoption their are many many people who would give anything to have a child to love for the rest of their life. <br>  <br>             with tears in my eyes im please asking you not to do it cause i know you wont regret looking a two little beautiful eyes looking at you in a couple of months.<br>  <br>  you dont need him(the father) forget him|`|ffnne6O1aa	Yes you can but it will be very expensive and there will be more risks involved and you may have to travel a little ways to find a clinic with the resources to do it. You have to make arrangements now because it is illegal after 24 weeks.|`|CpWGvDvRaa	I will adopt the baby.

So now TIMEOUT and think for a while.  You only have time on your hands because I am almost 100% sure you can no longer have an abortion.  You are thinking more about him than yourself...spend time reading about pregnancies and babies...in less than a month you can already find out the sex!  This baby is half of you!  I know it seems HARD...but I have a daughter of my own.  I never understood the love others had for their children but it is a Godsend I promise.  That child will be the one person that loves you completely for you.  You should talk to family or a close friend.  You may not be #1 in the father's life but you will be #1 in your baby's life.  Just think about it.  Have you taken the time to start loving this baby?  I know you are feeling terrible sadness and fear, but try to remember my words.  If that is still not your plan then I would seriously consider adoption.  You'll at least know you gave the baby a life.|`|rH2ZXPrsaa	I understand that your upset and hurt and your prolly thinking you want nothing to do with him and im sure you think this baby will link you two together for the rest of your life..that is only true to a point let him be with that other woman you dont need him, dont depend on a man it will get you nowhere in life. i believe that everything happens for a reason. this baby may change your life. i was 16 when i had my daughter and she saved mine if i didnt have her god knows. you have a precious lil gift that god gave you for a reason. if you honestly dont want this baby give this baby a better life adopt it to a loving family, your not meant to be with that man..look at it this way you have seen his true colors now that other woman he is getting with feel sorry for her..cause he sounds pretty worthless to me. dont hold this baby accountable for his mistake the baby doesnt deserve that. your not able to abort this baby so you have only 2 choices now. im not gonna lie it will be hard taking  care of this baby by yourself but you can do it take his *** to court get your money and move on with your life it will be the best decision you will ever make in your life i can promise you that. but if not then go ahead and adopt nobody can make your choice for you or can we really tell you what to do this is your life it will be effecting and this babys..you will have to live with this decision with the rest of your life so you just need to relax and forget about that boy and think about you and this baby and figure out what you wanna do..i wish you the best of luck just relax and think i think you will come up with something. congratulations on this baby :)|`|k2ms63v0aa	Wow this may be one of the saddest questions.  A part of me wants to tell you it's going to be fine and take it one day at a time.  Another part really fears for this child, cause his mother seems really immature and selfish.|`|tdhpAgHraa	You could.. but thats murdering your own baby! take responsibility for your actions!|`|hfSKP0ZVaa	nah, dont abort your child. life is a gift from god we should treasure it.
AOvtRBU9aa	I don't understand why you are posting this here knowing we are all mothers in this section. I ignored your first question but seriously do you have to keep posting about this. You obviously have access to the internet. Look it up. Call your Dr or planned parenthood.|`|1CryEnb3aa	Seriously, you are almost half way there.  Finish out your pregnancy and give it up for adoption.  Don't get rid of it because you are mad that he has chosen some one else over you.  Chose your baby over him.  Give it up for adoption and then get on with your life.|`|IXBl5l5kaa	Why are you asking this again?|`|Zbn8A7Geaa	You've asked this question twice. Not sure what kind of answer you're looking for on here.  But as I said in my other answer, it sounds like you tried to trap this guy, you failed, and are now trying to "get rid" of the consequences.   Or you were seriously deluded by whatever story he told you in order to get you to sleep with him.  26 years older than you?  How old are you anyway?<br>  <br>  It is not illegal to have an abortion at 4 months.  However, unlike first trimester abortions, those performed in the second trimester require a procedure that can only be done by a doctor, not clinic technicians or nurses.  You will need to find a doctor who would be willing to abort at this late stage in the pregnancy and that may be difficult to do.  I am pro-choice, but I think you should seriously consider giving the child up for adoption rather than abort at this late stage in the pregnancy.   There are innumerous couples who would jump at the chance of paying your medical expenses in order to adopt your child.|`|4Bgw5xs8aa	I believe you're a troll...however if you are not this is the WRONG place to be asking this question. The moms on here love our babies and most wouldnt even consider an abortion..let alone one at 4 months. I know I can't look at my daughter and even begin to fathom how someone could consider aborting a healthy baby. So go ask this elsewhere.|`|u00IalCZaa	That baby doesnt deserve to die. You dont need him to make it work. That kid is a part of you. you are responsible enough to get pregnant, take care of the baby and dont kill the baby.|`|tkSXjqhuaa	trolling? cute.|`|rTACLd3Saa	You got pregnant, you chose to continue the pregnancy thus far, be a responsible and humane being and have the baby then give it to a family who will give it the love and life it deserves.  If you would consider killing a 4 month old fetus you are obviously a heartless human being and incapable of loving a baby the way it deserves to be loved.  Besides, you obviously don't want it.  Just adopt it out to a family who desperately does and have the knowledge that you did something selfless and kind for a helpless little baby.|`|Wv2mOlQwaa	after 12 wks is considered illegal but maybe you can find an illegal clinic and a cold hearted doctor  to perform the illegal procedure and besides killing your baby, loose your life also.<br>  you know thats like a murder<br>  <br>  <br>  please god give her wisdom to choose the right choice not to take that little ones life.|`|1vqV2aE6aa	you really do need to consider why you are actually doing this?<br>  <br>  when i was 15 i got into some trouble and fell pregnant. the guy i was pregnant to also got my best friend pregnant and if i didn't have an abortion he threatened to have me and my baby killed. when i was 5months gone i was pushed down some stairs and unfortunately i lost the baby and i had to give birth. it was the hardest thing i had ever done. <br>  <br>  since then i had nothing but problems, i had a miscarriage in 2002 and an ectopic in 2003, i nearly died when i had the ectopic, it was an awful time for me. i then had problems conceiving<br>   and so desperately wanted to have a baby. i then separated from my ex and started dating my current partner. i was having some routine scans done, i suffer with pcos and out of all odds it appeared i was pregnant. i gave birth to my beautiful son last year. despite everything that had happened in the past, icouldn'tt be any more happier than i am now. <br>  <br>  im a person that was told i would never be able to have a child because of the problems i had in te past. please do consider what you are asking, you never know what could be in the future...|`|CnLL5ENmaa	you're really setting yourself up on this one.  look up partial birth abortions.  Thats what you'd be having.  It's awful.  I dont know how anyone could do it.  It is true, it is your responsibnilty, the guy sux, but thats the situation you're in.  I'm all for pro-choice, but at some point you have to live with your decisions.  If you really don't want the baby look into adoption.|`|1U7yLEf9aa	Give it up for adoption. AND you shouldn't get pregnant just because you want to be with someone. Children last forever. Boyfriends usually dont.|`|CpWGvDvRaa	I smell a troll at this point. Hmmm?|`|1tHVDSRJaa	No. Adopt it out|`|kbq7qRUCaa	At Eighteen Weeks<br>  <br>  The fetus is now about 5 inches long. The child blinks, grasps, and moves her mouth. Hair grows on the head and body.<br>  <br>  20 weeks: The child can hear and recognize mother's voice. Though still small and fragile, the baby is growing rapidly and could possibly survive if born at this stage. Fingernails and fingerprints appear. Sex organs are visible. Using an ultrasound device, the doctor can tell if the child is a girl or a boy. The one on the left is a baby girl.<br>  Dilation and Evacuation (D&E)<br>  <br>  This method is used up to 18 weeks' gestation. Instead of the loop-shaped knife used in D&C abortions, a pair of forceps is inserted into the womb to grasp part of the fetus. The teeth of the forceps twist and tear the bones of the unborn child. This process is repeated until the fetus is totally dismembered and removed. Usually the spine must be snapped and the skull crushed in order to remove them.<br>  Salt Poisoning (Saline Injection):<br>  <br>  Saline Injection (click for larger image)Used after 16 weeks (four months) when enough fluid has accumulated. A long needle injects a strong salt solution through the mother's abdomen into the baby's sac. The baby swallows this fluid and is poisoned by it. It also acts as a corrosive, burning off the outer layer of skin. It normally takes somewhat over an hour for the baby to die from this. Within 24 hours, labor will usually set in and the mother will give birth to a dead or dying baby. (There have been many cases of these babies being born alive. They are usually left unattended to die. However, a few have survived and later been adopted.) <br>  <br>  DOES SOUND LIKE SOMETHING YOU WANT TO DO TO YOUR UNBORN CHILD???|`|MZ5deUKWaa	Who gives a flying crap about him? Women have come a long way from the days of having to depend on a man. Grow up and grow a pair (if you catch my drift). Just because he doesn't care doesn't mean you don't have to. And why in the world would you ask such a question here of all places? And why did you wait 4 months? If you really don't want the baby, then there are plenty of people with the potential and yearning to be a loving, giving, selfless parent, so quit thinking of only yourself and give that baby a chance to have a life. Let a couple who can't have children of their own adopt the baby. At some point in the pregnancy, you will be asked if you are keeping the baby or giving it up for adoption, and once you tell them your choice, once its time for the delivery of the baby, you won't even have to see it. Push it out and hand it over. Don't kill a living, breathing baby, who didn't even ask for this crap in the first place, just because you would be # 2 in his life. You are so morally bankrupt on SO MANY levels its pathetically sad.|`|856df45cd220b8db7117dd899c6e5ae2aa	Technically, you can.  Most clinics have a cut off time of I believe 12 weeks (or close) before they will send you somewhere else to have late term pregnancies done.  The procedure is different and more painful for you.  Plus (and I am pro-choice here) the baby is an actual baby at that point for sure.  It can be done...but it is much more expensive and your risks are alot greater now than they would have been earlier.  <br>  <br>  It sounds to me, honey, that you are way too young and immature to have a baby right now.  The fact that he is no longer in your life will make things more difficult and not as "fun" for you...but it's still your baby.  I know it sucks, but HE really shouldn't be the deciding factor.  I think you should really consider adoption at this point.  You are not ready for a baby.  There are very good people out there who would take care of you throughout your pregnancy and give your baby a wonderful and loving home.  <br>  <br>  Please weigh all your options, and don't let your life and your decisions be wrapped around some man and his choices.  If you are so willing to abort now, you were never ready to be parents in the first place....neither of you.  Get some birth control, and be ready next time.  Good luck.<br>  <br>  Kelly|`|0azzfHawaa	well you can do abortions being that far but the problem is , is not going to be with any pill u have to go into surgery. this might bring complications if u are trying to have children in the future some women end up infertile some women even die!! well im not trying to scare you but im just being honest. the fetus is big now and is well formed u know think about it this baby does not deserve to die just because the paternal father is getting married to someone else that is not you.  i really hope u have insurance.  this is not going to be cheap .  i myself tried abortion but i was too far along , my baby died when she was 26 weeks and to tell you the truth i wish till this day i would have had her alive, because when i saw her my whole world change is a sad story now im over it and have a beautiful 1 year old and im 7 months pregnant, things happen for a reason ddon'tfind out the hard way. think about. much love zmalls...|`|isESI6yyaa	I DON'T GIVE A DAMN WHAT OTHER MOTHERS SAY...

NvbTnLrBaa	In my own opinion I would have a cheep wedding now, and then when you do have enough money have a better one. Just go to the court house and sign the papers or find a small church and talk to them and see if they could help you out. there are so many ways to make your wedding wonderful but cheep. My husband and I didn't pay much of anything at all with the help of family and friends. we had a pot luck for the people to eat and I bought a prom dress that looked almost like the wedding dress that i wanted. But if you think that it will stress you out to much then wait.|`|Lmiu6oBHaa	Surely you should save all your money for your baby not a wedding? I know its nice to get married but money will be abit tight if you have lost your jobs.|`|vygYFdsSaa	Hi sweetie I don't know which way you'd get better benefits but I just wanted to say to the girl above me: she's not talking about having a huge expensive wedding, she's trying to figure out the best situation for her child. Don't say something like that when you don't have a clue
8Rn2pX4jaa	I think those are all signs that your body is preparing for labor, but not necessarily anytime soon.  Almost everyone I know, either went full term or longer with their first.  Your body just needs a lot more time to prepare.  <br>  <br>  The baby is putting a lot of pressure on your internal organs, you tend to go to the bathroom a lot more often because there isn't as much "storage" room and everything is getting compressed.  If you have not dilated, you are still a ways away if this is your first.   <br>  <br>  But if you start having contractions that get closer together and get really intense, you have to stop talking or walking and catch your breath, and they get more frequent then you want to call your doc.  If you can lay down, drink some water, or take a warm bath and they stop... you are most likely not in labor.<br>  <br>  It is so nerve wracking trying to understand and decode the signals your body is sending you.  My doc told me, "You'll know when you are in labor."  However I have ended up at L&D twice and sent home, because evidently I did NOT know when I was in labor.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!  Enjoy your last few weeks of freedom and sleep.  They will be coming to an end soon.|`|9UYl8ErFaa	nope is normal at 36|`|XrKviWgSaa	that is how i was at 36 weeks and i am now 38 weeks and starting to have contractions but just because all of that is going on you can still have a few more weeks left but more then likely you will go a little before your due date|`|856df45cd220b8db7117dd899c6e5ae2aa	Unfortunately, no.  Those are just normal signs that the time is drawing near.  You will have those braxton hicks contractions for a while before actual labor.  You will even think you are in labor a few times probably, when you really are not.  Everything you have described is VERY normal.  All of us poor pregnant women hope that we are going into labor for the last month or so of our pregnancies, but it's usually just those fake contractions...exactly as you described.   You will start to feel more and more of this type of pressure during the next month.  Good luck.<br>  <br>  Kelly|`|R21aV2mLaa	i will be 36 weeks this friday and i have had braxton hicks also really bad bad lower back pains to were i have not been able to move my legs, i have heard the when you are having really bad lower back pains its called "back labour" its from how the baby is positioned, the tightness is called braxton hicks and i have had that since i was 29 weeks. i hoped i helped!! good luck|`|PxqcLkw1aa	My wife is about as far along as you are. We were told that most women go into labor within five days of there due date. You are probably having braxton hicks contractions which is normal. My wife has been having the same symptoms. With your baby being head down your probably feeling alot of pressure on your pelvis. It could happen but your symptoms sound normal considering how far along you are.|`|5ZdCXJ86aa	36 weeks = 9 months. And you said the baby was upside down then yes the baby will be here any day now. Congratulations and Good luck.|`|CRMAyEBqaa	your 36 weeks pregnant..you should know about this stuff surely.
PwHWJkcYaa	Cut it to the quick now. My bullies started in year 7 and I had 7 years of bruised legs, battered face, burnt hair, chewing gum all over my clothes, death threats and worse. You really need to get them to stop now, but lashing out will only make them laugh at you more. You could tell your parents, a teacher or somone like an aunt, b/c schools don't listen to kids being bullied. I know mine didn't care and I was bleeding! If it gets bad e-mail me and have a rant, that will help and if they get physically violent, get the police involved. That's really all I can suggest because things only got better when I moved away from everyone to go to Uni.|`|0jz0HjGXaa	middle school sucks. high school will be better :). just wait it out|`|sw2R5A9iaa	bullying is illegal in most states.  file a police report & inform your parents and principal.
oRaYQNXxaa	Bless her heart, not his! He seems to be using the death of his friend as an excuse to be a total jerk. <br>  Your sister doesn't need this stress in her life. I hate to say it but I think she needs to leave him. It would be best. He obviously is selfish and cares more about himself than your sister or his unborn child. No matter what you are going through you have to man up and take responsibility for your actions. In this case it would be him taking responsibility for your sister and the baby. <br>  Your sister is young and beautiful and she isn't a wrecked woman. She can do much better than "sir sleeps around a lot". <br>  Plus if he is doing this now I can only imagine how he will act once the baby is actually born. He will think he doesn't have any responsibilities or obligations and can just up and leave when he wants to, leaving your poor sis there alone with a newborn baby. He isn't going to change unless she puts her foot down and stands up for herself. <br>  He sounds like a total douchebag to me though. I say kick him to the curb! <br>  She can at least get child support out of him if nothing else.|`|nZPGdcKJaa	she needs to get an abortion!<br>  her boyfriend and her relationship is illegal first of all!<br>  and she's just a teen<br>  <br>  <br>  basics for being a successful parent- <br>  the ideal situation:<br>  <br>  be at least 21 (25 or older is ideal)<br>  be 100% independent<br>  be married<br>  both have careers (not jobs. love alone can't pay for a child, unless you get the tax payer's money to pay for YOUR child...*tisk tisk*)<br>  both have degrees<br>  both want kids<br>  both have cars<br>  have at LEAST $5,000 extra in savings just for the baby<br>  <br>  (I've had an abortion and I am thankful everyday I had that option)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  *any idiot can have sex, it takes MUCH more to be a responsible, financially stable, and mature parent|`|AA10526033	honestly id leave. i was preggo at 16 by a guy who was 24. he cheated on me i left. he was scum which is what this guy sounds like.|`|DS21ekeJaa	He needs to be on his way! An STD, a pregnancy at 17, cheating on her, and being an @ss- and your family is all fine with this? She needs to think more of herself and her child, and make sure she can get child support and finish her education. This is the rest of hopefully a very long life she has to live and she has been given 2 very crippling and stressful gifts from this jerk! Get rid of him!|`|lXpGlAm3aa	By the sounds of this;doesn't sound like a happy time.For all parties involved.If they don't work out as a couple (doesn't sound too promising)but you never know people can change and turnaround.<br>  <br>  Have you guys ever thought about adoption?It's another option to look into.Just a thought.|`|Lmiu6oBHaa	Havent I just read this?|`|9UYl8ErFaa	she should leave she dont deserve to be treated like that no matter what|`|AA12009593	first of all, you are a great sister. just give the guy some space and let him cope with his loss. maybe even recommend a therapist. keep your sister away from him. he is making her stressed out and that is really bad for the baby and the entire pregnancy. it can also be stressful for your sister to be away from him, so keep her distracted and focused on being healthy until the guy comes back around.|`|q4z8XGODaa	sorry I mean no offence but it sounds like its from home and away or some soap opera!<br>  <br>  If this is really happening you should tell her to have a long talk with him.

My mum nearly killed her. Anyway the father was 3 years older and a drunk. He would come to our house at night really badly drunk and bang on our windows and scream my sisters name. i was only 10 so it was pretty scary for me. What im saying is let your sister stay, she needs you more than anything shes having a child. Help her through these tough times. Tell her your there for her and plz do something about the father hes a ***** no afence.<br>  <br>  Good Luck, i hope things go well :)|`|AA11120998	Honestly that guy is not worth it...I see how its a concern because of the baby. But if he has been doing that over and over again calming that he is going to change and he hasn't. Then he isn't going to change. Its true just cause he lost his friend it doesn't make it a reason for him to do all those things that's just away to cover up the real reason he is doing that. Tell your sister that dont stress over him leave him no matter how bad its going to hurt. She has to think about the baby's future now not just hers the one suffering is going to be the baby. Mean while she stays with him, not only that she will suffer as well stressing and crying thinking about the baby now she should be in the most joyful time of her life, because she is giving birth to a beautiful baby. No girl especially 17 should be worrying about a guy who is not going to change. Tell her to really think about it. Im telling you because i just turned a couple a weeks ago and I know what she has gone thru and I am also prego i am 9 months and 3 weeks about to have my beautiful boy and that's my main concern right now my baby boy and my umber one priority!Even if i have found some one in my life that has bn there it doesn't change the fact that it doesn't hurt to be cheated and treated wrong and lied too. No one should go Thru that!!|`|G8yA4dz7aa	you tell your sister's man to get the heck out of her life and his kid as well unless he willingly promises to change and if he doesn't then he should be ashamed and goes away from your sister but tell her first what you're going to do and if she agrees with you then do it and if she doesn't tell her you want her to be happy and teh baby too. and if she brings up any of that her child needs a father thing tell her that her child deserves a loving and caring father not the one your sister got together with|`|ziw77iuPaa	Omg she needs to leave him... A STD she can get rid of is horrible. She wont be able to have a normal relationship b/c of that. She neds to worry about her and the baby not him. He is a loser and I am quite sure your sister has a wonderful family nd support system it seems like. She needs to get over him and just be strong as she can be. I wish you, your family, her, and the new baby a happy and sucessful life. <br>  BTW that is nice of her to try to stick with him b/c of the death of his friend but it still doesnt mean he can treat her any kind if way. Plus I know she is young and in love but it will def work ot for her. Keep me posted. I will add you to my contacts to check up on her.<br>  xoxo|`|163a204969df1b756b602880bb1a1ab2aa	personally. i think she should stay. b/c maybe that's not the best for neither of them, but they should stay together for their baby.<br>  professionally. you sister should get professional counseling on things like these.

4Bgw5xs8aa	I think it's completely normal. My daughter has red hair and gets red cheeks a lot. I think it's totally cute. I have figured out that it's normally when she's hot or active.

I'm sure it's completely normal and totally adorable. : )|`|OI3bf4yjaa	My daughter always has rosy cheeks.. but they go really red when she's cutting teeth.

SjX72fPyaa	Oh yeah it annoys me!! I think the worst was my boyfriends ex. After it got around to my friends and eventually to her that I was pregnant she started telling everyone that she was pregnant too! And she was constantly texting my boyfriend telling him that since they were both having babies now that they really should hang out more so they could help each other out. He put a stop to that real fast! lol. Thinking back now though I probably wouldn't have been so pissed at her about that if she hadn't spent the majority of her time trying to get him back at that time. All I saw that as was a plan to seduce him back and I wasn't having it!! lol. <br>  Then as soon as she was "pregnant" long enough for her to start showing she all of a sudden had a miscarriage.<br>  <br>  I find it all really pathetic when a girl actually has to pretend to be pregnant in order for people to pay attention to her.|`|prqrQcd1aa	What annoys me is not only this, but seeing other people post questions about their "babby" or about when they were "prengnt" or some other variation of the word..

You have grown up so fast as well as many other teenage mothers. I had a misscarrage at 4 weeks, and even though I don't have a baby of my own now, etc. when I see girls lye about this I get extremely p*ssed off too. It's normally pretty easy to spot the fakers since half the girls who "have had triplets at 15" are built like a twig and look like partiers (I'm not trying to be biased).<br>  <br>  What also p*sses me off to no end, are the girls who are like 13, have unprotected sex, know better, and then say that "they don't know why this happened to me, blah blah blah." <br>  <br>  Anyways sorry about the rant, I feel for you.<br>  <br>  And congratulations about having a baby, I'm almost 18 and wish I had a little one to hold right now.<br>  <br>  xoxo|`|koXcq0l1aa	There's a lot of those out there.  Some(not all) young girls like the idea of having a child and want to fake it.  You are upset because you know that having a child at a young age is hard and you are irritated that these girls are living in fantasy-land while you are living the reality.  Yes it annoys me but you can't always spot the fakers.  <br>  <br>  As for having to prove to your bf's mother that you were pregant, what she made you do is borderline sexual harassment.<br>  <br>  Hmm...wonder if Eman's parents ever taught him that everyone's situation is different and that what he is doing is called "stereotyping".  Unfortunately this is why many hard working young mothers feel worthless...because of people like Eman!|`|n3PE2lvDaa	I had a friend at school that used to get pregnant every time she had sex. haha. Seriously, she would sleep with a guy and then a week later say she was pregnant. A week after that she had either miscarried or had an abortion. She was only about15 at the time but I can count around 5 times that she was 'pregnant'. Im still friends with her and she actually does have two children now but had trouble conceiving as she has two uterus's. So she is not as fertile as she made out in highschool!. It used to frustrate me because it was obvious she was lying but I also felt sorry for her because she obviously needed attention which shows that something wasnt going right in her life.<br>  Yes it annoys me when I see them on here saying that because you can bet they are probably trying to make this little fantasy life on the internet a reality. If only they knew the reality of how difficult it is to raise a child- especially as a single teen mother. They need to enjoy thier youth while they have it and wait til they have a good relationship before having children.<br>  EDIT: What annoys me more though is all the judgmental people on here that try to make others feel bad about themselves. They must be pretty miserable in real life if they need to come on here just to insult strangers.|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	There was one on here yesterday who claimed to be pregnant with her second set of twins - a quick look at her q&a history revealed she was only 12, and if she were pregnant with her second set of twins at 12, we'd hear it on the news!<br>  I know a lot of people think it's harmless, but it sends out the message that getting pregnant when you're a teenager is common practice and that it's ok, which of course means there'll be lots of babies born to parents who thought they wanted it, but find that they cant cope with the responsibility. That is not a dig at you - accidents happen! But it's the ones who are deliberately getting pregnant that wind me up. Well done to you for stepping up and doing the best you can, but I'm sure even you advise other teens to live some more life first!|`|Fx77zYhWaa	Yeah, I remember quite a few girls doing that in middle school, high school, and even elementary school (mine was K-6).  I don't know why they did it but I guess it made me a little disbelieving when other girls really were pregnant.  Hard to tell who's telling the truth and who's lying.  A lot of the girls that were really pregnant weren't flaunting it.  Plus when they say little silly things like, "the doctor thinks I might be pregnant and it might be twins" it kind of screams LIAR.|`|59GymH27aa	It annoys me and I think that I can spot the fakers right away.  However, If I was wrong then I would feel pretty bad.  There's one I am sure is a faker...and her daughter recently passed away but I could have almost guaranteed that was what she was going to say happened from some of her posts.  <br>  <br>  And to everyone who has been slagging her off....what makes you a bloody better person than her.  She clearly loves her little boy so she has absolutely no reason to have to defend herself to haters!!!|`|r4E2zXL8aa	Yes, it does annoy me. But what annoys me even more is when people like "Eman" come on here and judge people they don't even know. Eman, take your lousy opinions and shove them. Callie, I added you a long time ago and have read a lot of your questions, I think you're a really good young mother & you do your best. Don't let stereotypical a$$holes like eman bring you down. Keep doing what you're doing hun. Just stick your nose up at the haters.|`|6fiYhtACaa	Mad? No.....that is so incredibly sad and pathetic. I don't mean that in a malicious way. You really have to be very attention-starved to lie about pregnancy- especially as a teen. When I was 15, I was afraid that my mom might figure out I was thinking about sex. Good gracious how times have changed. Thank you Octu-mom, jaime-lynn, and Bristol Palin.|`|dURFX4gOaa	i don't get mad about fakers to be honest i think they are sad little people who have to make up crap to make their lives more interesting , listen hun don't get mad just enjoy your gorgeous baby ...|`|AA10526033	it use to drive me nuts when i was in high school and had a baby because so many girls just thought it would be fun to have a baby but had no idea. now i just laugh at their stupidity and point out the reasons they aren't or shouldn't be pregnant!|`|EWFtQNSdaa	Yes, stupid attention seekers.<br>  <br>  Your son is adorable :)|`|73c08aa590c890d1f54b22d1db2cef60aa	No and you should just focus on your own life and not worry about other people.|`|qxddYXMGaa	His mother had to watch you take a preggie test!  ahhhh! not good!|`|0jnILvY2aa	yes|`|W6C4IGhLaa	yes, I find it quite annoying myself =/|`|1U7yLEf9aa	Same with me. I'm 20 now but I got pregnant with my daughter when I was 15. Seems like alot of my EX friends were always pregnant and having miscarriages like every month but never had a positive pregnancy test because they (already had a miscarriage).... My kid's dad believed it though, We weren't protected enough for him not to believe it. The fakers are those girls that are all about drama!!!! If a guy breaks up with them they are pregnant!!! They always seem to be pregnant but never have a baby... ? <br>     Wow, I wouldn't piss on a stick for nobody but myself. lol messed up.|`|4Bgw5xs8aa	Yes, it annoys me. Why would you want to lie about something like that? Is it entertaining or something? I don't know...What annoys me even more is when they lie about losing a baby..that's not something to joke around about. OR when they PURPOSELY get pregnant at like 15..and it's planned because they think they are "ready" for a baby. Why plan something that young? I know it happens and I'm sure you and others your age are great moms..age doesn't really matter...but I would never "plan" a pregnancy at that age.|`|CpWGvDvRaa	Eman: Should she have just threw her child away? Would she have been a better role model for that?<br>  <br>  Honestly, I am just happy that she did not dump the kid in a trash or smother the baby after it was born. <br>  <br>  Let's focus on the fact that, at 16, she is giving it her best!<br>  <br>  And for those of you who have been idiotic about your responses, perhaps you are the ones who think Casey Anthony was just "being a good role model" for her child too. <br>  <br>  Don't listen to them; I am SO FREAKIN happy that you are doing it...period! <br>  <br>  It is rare to find a mother like you; I admire you fully!<br>  <br>  Good luck sweets!|`|YmEGCGtnaa	it doesn't really make me mad, but I just think it's so silly. esp about having triplets. they remind me of little girls like 8 or younger who want to play with their dolls. <br>  I think maybe it's bc i'm 25 so i'm not a teen mom so I don't take it as personally as you do---if I were a teen mom, it'd probably bother me more than it does bc it's no joke.|`|41980ab28e587a42197eea5a921bca4aaa	I had this one girl in high school who was pregnant every month.  Then she would "fall down the stairs" and lose it.  One time, it came out when she was peeing.  Seriously, she would tell people this!|`|eFXD3Qzcaa	Younger teens, yes, it does make me mad.  But women in their twenties that are married?  It makes me sad.  They want babies so much and as crazy as it may seem to women with kids it's not all that easy to have them.  Sometimes they just want that attention that pregnant women get or they just want to believe that they are pregnant because they want it so desperatly.  Teens say it because they think it is "cool".|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	yes i hate it and ive seen those question bout that girl with triplets <br>  <br>  but girls at my school to nd then they print pics of ultrasounds off of google nd bring them in its so sad <br>  <br>  <br>  and eman u suck nd we dont need bitchy people like that she a teen mom im a teen mom and our children will not miss out on ne thing becuse of our age so dont even say crap like that|`|5fce6a605574a9d1f8b46472531de92baa	yes i hate that, when i was in high school i knew a lot of people like that and it was funny because they would all say "im pregnant" then a month later they would all say "i had a miscarriage" those stupid teenage girls|`|lGcpXteaaa	I hear ya!<br>  I also hate how teens brag about being pregnant! <br>  I just laugh at these questions though...people like you and me know how hard it is to have and support you and your LO when only 16....<br>  <br>  They are silly little girls....
1dueLOdvaa	When I was literally shaking and in tears because I was so stressed out.<br>  <br>  My 4 year old was so bad for me one day, and my baby was sick and miserable. I had reached my breaking point.<br>  <br>  Luckily when their father got home he let me take a nap and relax a little bit, I woke up feeling much better.|`|n3PE2lvDaa	The first sign that I need a break is that I start to pick at my partner. I feel really terrible about admiting that but its the truth, and a habit I would love to break. I get grumpy at him over absolutely nothing. I dont do it too much but when I do, he soon relizes that I have had a bad day and need to chill out for a bit. <br>  I know I have got to the next step of needing a break when I feel like pulling my own hair out and screaming. lol. And also I get the urge to throw a big childish drama and storm out of the house. But as a Mum you cant act on that so instead I put baby in her cot and leave the room for 5 minutes to chill out. Then when I feel like I have my stress under control I go back and deal with the baby. <br>  Anyway, those are the signs that tell me- you need a break|`|lGcpXteaaa	I just feel myself getting angry/stressed/overwhelmed. I just leave the room making sure she is safe 1st.<br>  <br>  If your talking about long term and not just on a night with a screaming baby...then i find myself thinking irrationally...like i have been doing lately. <br>  I just upped my night out a week, to 2 nights out a week. It seems to have helped :)|`|prqrQcd1aa	When you start to get so overwhelmed with everything that you can not seem to handle simple daily things..|`|846b3af290613f2b0cdb0b7edc68ce91aa	LOL...when you feel like pulling your hair out!  I remember that so well and sorry to say, it doesn't go away as they grow.  When you start to feel that way, take a deep breath and see if daddy will take baby, or go to grandma's and visit.  Let grandma have fun with the baby and enjoy the break, as well as listen to mom's advice on how to cope.  If you can't go or there's no one around to help you, try putting the baby down for nap and relax, or run a warm bath and you and baby take a nice long soak.  It should calm baby down enough for you to relax for a while.  Just remember the feeling does fade as they get older, and the instances are fewer.  <br>  <br>  Good luck and don't worry, it is normal.  All moms feel that way from time to time.|`|jYPeis3Saa	when you are feeling extremely frustrated. or just want to scream. <br>  <br>  its different for everyone. my son is 16 months so hes at the "terrible 2's" stage. i honestly think it started the day he turned 1. <br>  <br>  if im getting frustrated with him, i just walk away for a few minutes.|`|rkSBHqtQaa	When everything annoys me. I will usually call my hubby and just break down. When he gets hime he does his best to make me feel better and he handles the boys. But most of the time I just cry it out.|`|AA10526033	when i get use to being covered in puke and not showering for days. when i snap out of it i make hubby watch the kiddos so i can get girlied up again lol.|`|4Bgw5xs8aa	<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AlmiZvPuC9Cpw7cIfgfj3zzsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090304205353AAA6nPB">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  That's how. lol. That's how horrible my day was today..and the way I felt after my baby went to sleep is how I know I've had enough.|`|zPYyGw8oaa	I was crying for a week...no reason what so ever ...and going off on my hubby just because of a dirty dish....i knew then that I was at my whits end, and asked my hubby for a break, he gladly agreed :)|`|EWFtQNSdaa	When you are either about to rip your own hair out.<br>  <br>  or<br>  <br>  When you are considering killing yourself or the people around you.|`|CzDyZZBEaa	When you are getting angry and about to lose it take a break|`|MZ5deUKWaa	Trust me, you'll know!|`|41980ab28e587a42197eea5a921bca4aaa	My son cried for seven hours straight one day.  I finally had enough.  I set him in his crib and I ran onto my porch for a brief moment.  When I came back in he was asleep and I felt so much better.|`|6AvVVzsnaa	When you're overwhelmed.
jYPeis3Saa	i know what you mean. <br>  <br>  some people arn't the brightest crayons in the box.|`|4Bgw5xs8aa	Because when you first have a baby age is counted in "weeks" as opposed to months. So you begin to wonder if 4 weeks is a month old? Or if they're born on the 12th, does the 12th of the next month make them a month old? It's pretty easy to get confused actually. Once it transitions from "weeks" to "months" it's sooo much easier to understand. I had this problem myself. It's not dumb or anything just kind of a "duh" moment for some of us.|`|Uy8ntukjaa	I think some people just get mixed up with the weeks vs months. Since some months are longer than others and sometimes people think in terms of what day of the week their baby was born on it just leads to confusion. I figure its easier to just go from the same date each month, like Jan 6- Feb 6= 1 month|`|UghJ0XROaa	Lol, i plead the fifth on this question!|`|MZ5deUKWaa	I do the same thing, just use the same date of each month. My son was born on the 8th so, for me, he'll be 6 months old in 3 days, on the 8th.|`|y8AH00G4aa	I didn't even realize people had that problem...<br>  <br>  My only guess is that they're mixed up concerning whether or not a month is an actual month, or whether it's 4 weeks.|`|c23e2e9ba321447351d3dc720a353187aa	It's similar to with pregnancy, you don't know whether to count in weeks (lunar months) or in calendar months which vary but average 4 weeks and 3 days.|`|tkSXjqhuaa	Sometimes it does get complicated and confusing for first time mothers, why waste the time and points asking about it?
vygYFdsSaa	Are you just expecting one little bub??? Everybody's different I don't think you're ridiculously big or anything like that|`|Coc593Ikaa	I am 31 weeks also, and I'd say that our bellies are similar in size!<br>  <br>  So, to me, you don't look too big. Though I do get told the same thing.

hFoYmSgqaa	it is perfectly normal unless she struggles to take her bottle or is running a temperature then see you gp urgently. babies this young do not have allergies so we have been told by a paediatrician that sees my son. my baby is 4 months old on friday and has had cold after cold with these double sneezes and if there is a new smell then he sneezes too. this nurse knows nothing about newborn babies.|`|6AvVVzsnaa	He might be allergic to cats.|`|68d8ad07f5b8eb2e788d4d05c809eeeaaa	newborns have a lots of mucous and they are sneezing it out. My son also sneezed a lot and always twice lol, (it was so cute - his hands were also moving like he want to cover his nose when he was sneezing), we have a dog and cat and he doesn't have an allergy. But if you concerned you can alwas talk to doctor.|`|c62a95c6696d81427b76aa335ba9d509aa	My little girl is three weeks old and she sneezed alot right after birth and still sneezes a bit now... Everyone at the hospital said it is completely normal for newborns to sneeze alot! i really wouldn't worry about it too much.|`|pj5bUjbQaa	My doctor said it is perfectly normal for a new born to sneeze...  it does not mean they have allergies.. In fact it is very very rare for a newborn to have allergies so early..|`|TlFnIei0aa	Does he have a runny nose 2?<br>  Squirt some breast milk up there...|`|PNPg9Ytkaa	my baby did this and I asked the doctor at the 2 week check up and he said that us as adults when we smell something new, different, or strong we sneeze... well everything to new babies are new, different, and strong and therefore they sneeze a lot.. my doctor said that unless the baby is running a fever or something else noticebly wrong (stop eating ect) then to be worried other than that its not a problem
MzqZGvalaa	I would stick to Playhouse or Nick Jnr at night time, honey, coz Nick goes all teenage after about 7pm, they're pretty up front about it, it's no secret.  Haunting in Connecticut-I watched it, it's a doco, and the ads are so much more interesting than the actual programme,(spell check-stop it! that's how it's spelled!) which is a bit lame really.  All the scary bits are in the ad.  Just turn it over, problem solved.|`|8SjoUQmEaa	Well, Nick at Night usually shows 90s sitcoms and starts at 9pm on Nickelodeon, So I'm not quite sure what you're talking about. I don't think they are showing those previews during the children show time bracket. <br>  The "tween" time in the evening everyone is thinking of is "Teenick", Just thought I should clear that up. <br>  <br>  Anyway to answer your question, they have great 24 hour children's channels (PBS sprout, Noggin) that are available with most cable providers, 100% commercial free and kids oriented, or an alternative to that would be to just turn on a kid friendly DVD or video for him to fall asleep to.|`|xPsv7ysvaa	Ok well first off they show this comercial on alot of channels. and Nick at Night is usually for teenangers so that why they play more often at night. and and idea to help your child to go to sleep is read hima book and stay in the bed with him until he sleeps. if that doesnt work have him sleep with you the when he falls asleep put him in his bed. that one works when i put my daughter to sleep and she is 5
vygYFdsSaa	For me implantation felt like I had just gotten my period. The same type of cramps -- that's what it felt like.

I would just ask your mom to help you and explain to her the reason you want the thong.  I seriously advise against trying to use a tampon by yourself for the first time, just ask her how you should do it.|`|1P7qdjieaa	NORMAL UNIDES MUCH!|`|7wVKW3l1aa	Whats wrong with a thong lol??? Its a way to look nice in clothes panty lines are not something I would like to have...|`|7twWHSJYaa	go normal, its not worth the risk
veO1RXrCaa	Exactly.  A baby does not guarantee closeness.  It was hell for our relationship at first.  We almost killed each other that first year.  Between the hormonal changes, my possessiveness of our baby, hes not being as helpful as I thought, the change in our relationships dynamic it was hard.  We ended up closer despite all this.  But having a baby is not as great a bonding experience as some think.|`|Aj99vuqYaa	Just say no, that you're not ready for that.<br>  <br>  Sounds like he's rather insecure. You shouldn't have to worry bout staying connected...it should come natural.|`|jLYTKr33aa	I agree with you.  A child will not keep you connected if things don't turn out well. Look around - there are countless broken couples with children dragged into their mess.  More importantly, it is not a child's job to keep his parents together.  Such a huge burden should not be thrust upon the tiny shoulders of an innocent child.  Your plan sounds much more sensible.  Wait a few years to have some time for just the two of you to really bond as husband and wife.  After that, when/if things go well, add children to your family.  Good luck.|`|ZzXK3nAAaa	You're dead right--it IS a BS reason--you have a 50% chance of being connected thru your lawyers and child support payments. Bah. Reminds me of my cuckoo ex-wife who wanted a second child in case the first one got a fatal disease or was hit by a car. Oh wow, man. Sounds to me like he's VERY immature and even more insecure, and you ought to think about ten more times before continuing with any more of this lunacy. How old is he, anyway? Certainly YOU have your head on straight, but he gives me the creeps.|`|c3d48b333e3b1797d8af8f39b48239e6aa	DO NOT HAVE KIDS TO "STAY CONNECTED"! THAT IS THE WRONG THING TO DO! <br>  <br>  You should have kids when your ready. Mentally and financially.|`|dat8eoYyaa	having a child doesnt keep u connected, if can make things worse being u arent married and u dont even know if this is who u want 2 spend the rest of your life with, he sounds controlling|`|V48inFxWaa	It doesn't really matter whether you are married or not. Having a baby (well, at least having it in a responsible way) means being ready and quite convinced that you can stay together for 18 years or longer no matter what. <br>  <br>  Of course, you ca get separated earlier and you can organise things in a quite civilised way but still the best reason for having a baby is a strong belief that you have enough in common with someone and enough respect for the person so you are ready to stay with this person for a long period of time even without a baby.<br>  <br>  So, either your boyfriend only wanted to compliment you and to say in a somewhat funny way that he loves you, or you need to talk seriously.<br>  <br>  If you talk seriously then I believe your stand iis better and much safer than his. If you are not already over thirty, babies can wait for just a little while until you are convinced that your boyfriend is really the person you want to spend the majority of your life with.|`|VsaEOX9vaa	Having kids together doesn't guarantee that you'll stay connected. There are millions of couples who will attest to that. I think he's likely to give you a kid and disappear off the scene.<br>  <br>  I agree, that you should feel offended.  The best way to stay connected is to be in love with each other, to want to be togther and stay together because of your love for each other,<br>  <br>  A kid comes later, once you are sure of your love for each other and that you want to be together forever. You can;t use an innocent kid to try and make you stay together!<br>  <br>  Dump him!|`|rOMTKmjDaa	Perhaps he meant to be romantic? Don't take it too seriously for now, and explain your motivations for wanting to have children. Don't let the children be the motivation for staying in love!|`|JVHCFXXVaa	It absolutely NEVER works! The worst possible reason to have a child. You're giving the kid something to accomplish before he's even born!  No kid should be saddled with that!|`|uC3Lxcyraa	I have been with my girl for just over two years and have been engaged for one and a half years.  There were different times that she would have problems at her house (she still lives with her parents and spoiled older brother) and she would tell me to get her pregnant just so that she would have an excuse to move out of there and with me.  I would tell her every time that is not a good reason to move out.  It would only cause problems.  We are still happy together and we are going to wait until after we get married and settled down before we have kids.  Like I tell her, we can't afford a kid right now.  I would strongly recommend waiting until after marriage and make sure you, yourself, are ready.  Don't forget, with baby comes a lot of responsibility.  My sister is learning that the hard way.  Her boyfriend got her pregnant, left her until the baby was born, stayed with her for a year, and they are just separating again.  They were never married.  Think hard about this.  Remember, you are the one who has to carry this baby for nine long months before it is even born.  He just has the fun and waits nine months.

Or they have these toys like animals you put on the car seat handle. You pull it down and let go it rattles. We bought a Lion. Or I bought some shapes that are animals. A circle that is an elephant, Triangle is a monkey, square is a lion. Each has a rattle in it. The lion has a mirror thingy on it. the elephant has a star plastic thingy on it and the monkey has something else on it.

Anything with bright colors, different textures on it.  Go to www.pampers.com and they have articles and stuff for each stage of baby's development.  I got a lot of great info from them.  Plus you can get coupons for diapers and stuff.  Baby Einstein is also a great brand.  Floor play rugs are great fun for that age, and helps promote rolling and using arms and legs, as well as build brain connections.  <br>  <br>  Take baby with you when you shop for baby toys and see what he likes.  <br>  <br>  Good Luck!!!
Coc593Ikaa	"Nearly 4 in 10 teen pregnancies end in abortion"<br>  <br>  From the linked website.<br>  <br>  ADD: Well, I'm linking a second website that you might find interesting and useful. It has lots of other statistics regarding teen pregnancy...really enlightening stuff!|`|o503YPrqaa	States ranked by rates of abortion among women age 15-19 (pregnancies per thousand):<br>  <br>  New Jersey (47)<br>  New York  (46)<br>  Maryland  (38)<br>  Nevada  (36)<br>  California  (36)<br>  Hawaii  (34)<br>  Florida  (33)<br>  Delaware  (31)<br>  Connecticut (30)<br>  Illinois  (27)|`|eKDYbe9Laa	50%<br>  <br>  1 to 3 months|`|9UYl8ErFaa	i think like 50%|`|ZSKrYLhtaa	Here in the UK abortions are in the news again as we have reached another all time high. Nineteen years old's have now become the most likely to have an abortion with an estimated 36 in every 1000 undergoing the procedure.<br>  The under 16 abortion rate is 4.4 and under 18’s 19.8 per 1000 women.|`|vygYFdsSaa	I don't believe that anybody here can come up with that kind of statistic off the top of our heads. Too big a percentage, probably.|`|bKyCEBmlaa	20 to 60% i reckon.|`|Pu6EKr82aa	1 in 4 but u shouldnt ever|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Teens only make up 17 percent of all abortions that are done. About 13 out of every 1000. So that's actually a very small percentage. I just googled it.

hIoxij6eaa	Have one. You are really lucky that the women in your life care about you so much that they want to throw one for you. Its really special.|`|xubIaiZaaa	yeah your being a little silly, besides, it doesnt have to be all about presents, let them host a shower for you, i dont see the problem|`|XSol0H6Uaa	Yes, you are silly for resisting.|`|1u4CS5J3aa	if they want to then whats the problem? I would let them|`|qHwI9ev8aa	It's an old tradition and the reason is mostly because after the first baby you have everything you need, but a baby shower is also to celebrate the coming of a new life and to make mommy feel a little bit special. If your new family wants to throw you a shower, go ahead and enjoy it.|`|JoyIIiZ6aa	Let your MiL and SiL enjoy this precious moment, and let them have their way.  It will be well worth your effort not in material terms but in terms of building up good family relations.  Think of giving up your tradition as your gift to your MiL and SiL.  I'll bet your hubby will be happy too, especially since they never had a chance to celebrate a baby shower for one of his children.|`|6AvVVzsnaa	I would have a baby shower for every baby I bring into the world. People are just helping out and why refuse that.|`|Uy8ntukjaa	Everyone in my family has always had a baby shower for each child. Its a time of bonding and celebration and has never been viewed as a "gimme presents" event. I think you should have one and enjoy it. There is no reason to deny a fun filled family day where everyone can share in the new little life you are carrying inside you.

jYPeis3Saa	you can try teethers that you put in the fridge. you can try ice in mesh teethers. <br>  hylands teething tabs worked for my son. or you could try baby oragel. <br>  <br>  the tooth could come in fairly quick, or it could take a while. <br>  <br>  for my son they seem to take a while to come all the way through. for the last week or 2 ive noticed a molar starting to break through. its not all the way through yet though.|`|916UznnBaa	another month or so|`|Uy8ntukjaa	You can give him frozen edamame to chew on (pieces are too small for choking) or get him a teething ring. A cold wet washcloth works well in a bind.|`|zPYyGw8oaa	if the tooth has already broken the gums...it is usually no longer very painful (but you can wet a clot ant put it in the fridge if it is). it mainly takes about a month for the tooth to fully row in but it varies from baby to baby.
ETvV9aypaa	get a hobby? somthing to keep ur mind off of things. good luck|`|Bzb6rSeCaa	Good luck making a baby and good luck trying to keep your mind off the it during the TWW!!!!
oRaYQNXxaa	I was one of those people who never thought I would be able to get pregnant. I read everything and tried everything...even standing on my head lol. My the things we do right? LOL. <br>  But I tried this and it worked!<br>  Count 14 days from the first day of your period. Say you started your period today, count up 14 days. This is known as your most fertile day. Have sex 3 or 2 days before this day. Semen lives in your body for about 2-4 days. Once your most fertile egg is released then it will meet up with that sperm and ta-da! <br>  After you have intercourse lay on your LEFT side. Prop your legs up with a pillow and lay there for at least 20-30 minutes. <br>  Also, you should start taking prenatal vitamins now. This will help get you used to taking them for one and two they are good for you and will make sure your body has all of the nutrients it needs, which will help in conception. <br>  Limit caffeine intake, it is said that caffeine limits the egg supply and if your a man it reduces the sperm supply as well. <br>  DO NOT!!! Have sex every day. Maybe every other day but not every day. This reduces his sperm count and you might be wasting it for your most fertile day.<br>  <br>  Good luck and lots of baby dust|`|ksWm9eCBaa	Sounds pretty silly... you might've seen it in movies or tv shows... but it really is recommended by some fertility docs: immediately after intercourse, prop your legs up and rest that way for a/b 30 minutes.  (Like, heels resting on the headboard of your bed, back of couch...legs at 45 degree angle to flat back, if you can!)  Yes, your feet (and possibly legs!) will go to sleep...what price we pay for conception, huh??<br>  <br>  Um, what happened to the 4th?  He gonna be out of town??  Seriously, you MAY want to consider every OTHER day, to give time for the lil swimmers to re-group & multiply a bit before they go forth?? <br>  <br>  If this go-round doesn't work, DON'T STRESS...just re-post for more answers...STRESS won't help anything...esp this!  Good luck! Fingers Crossed!  (been right where you are...sooooo hoping for you!!!!)|`|ApYzZhXNaa	Just make sure that you are ovulating. You should see a very thick clear mucus. You might even notice your body temperature is a little warmer then usual... you might really feel the difference early in the morning. <br>  All you can do is keep doing it.<br>  It'll happen.|`|Uy8ntukjaa	You should have sex every other day (every day depletes sperm count and sperm can live 3-5 days in vagina so no worries). Have sex in the missionary position and after intercourse hold your legs up and lay on your back for about 20-30 minutes so the semen doesn't leak out. You can also try to have an orgasm after your husband ejaculates as this causes the cervix to dip into the pool of semen and bring it into your uterus. Good luck!
oRaYQNXxaa	There could be multiple reasons why this is happening.<br>  -Constipation, this happens when you get pregnant and doesn't go away usually until after delivery<br>  <br>  -You are not eating right, takin the whole "eating for two" to heart and just eating a lot more than normal<br>  <br>  -You could be carrying multiples <br>  <br>  You should be getting an ultrasound here soon to check on your baby(s) and to make sure you are growing according to doctors wishes. Also this will give you a more accurate due date as well.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	I was having the same problem but I had some extra belly fat. It's also my second pregnancy. You do start to show sooner. You may also be very bloated on top of that.|`|GAxJNvxmaa	it could be twin/triple.|`|FLAtdWrmaa	Most likely reason is the one Janet S has given.<br>  <br>  Multiples will do it, too, a sonogram will (eventually) tell you if this is the case.<br>  <br>  Or you could be experiencing my situation:  your baby may only be a single, but has a very large placenta.  (In my case, the baby *and* the placenta were large -- he was born at 9 lbs 12 oz -- and boy, did I show early!).|`|0ffa3071ec5d97e40f2988e5bf8d9e8faa	A comment I heard a Doctor say once:<br>  <br>  Once a balloon is blown up it is easier to blow it up again.|`|hAuemuWTaa	Maybe u putting on weight gain quicker than normal.|`|9UYl8ErFaa	all pregnancy are different i was huge with my first and im tiny with this one|`|9GvflDg1aa	It could be that you are having twins, or more.<br>  <br>  Or that you are just bloated, because when you are pregnant, your abdomen is more prone to bloating.|`|rpZRlJMzaa	maybe constipation? thats how i was. Horribly constipated and my bellly looked HUGE. haha =]|`|FZBENVb6aa	A.  You were too damn skinny to start with.<br>  <br>  B.  God has decided to bless you with 2 or 3 more.|`|6MqK4LrHaa	Mayb its twins or mayb its bloat.... or mayb ur utrus didn't go back down frm the first pregnancy...|`|UdICTUnaaa	sounds like you could have twins or more in there. you'll find out soon enough... if it hurts or anything see a doctor
qHwI9ev8aa	It's hard for a mom to be separated from a young child, it's just maternal instinct. Also, yes, pregnancy can make you emotional. <br>  <br>  Use the time to pamper yourself a little, after the new baby is born you will have even less time to yourself. And do a little something special for your hubby just to let him know how great he is.<br>  <br>  Enjoy your peace and quiet (I'm just a little jealous!)|`|2B6F5Zhtaa	Is this the first time you've been seperated for so long? because if it is i should think it is normal to feel very upset! And even if your trust your husband above everything else, you obviously can't help worrying about the pair of them because they mean the world to you, i'm sure.<br>  <br>  And i would presume that the hormones of being pregnant are probably making it more difficult to bear with aswell.<br>  <br>  I reckon if you keeop regular contact with the pair, and as silly as it sounds call your husband and talk to your baby on the phone at the same time, it will reassure you that everything is going ok :)|`|hIoxij6eaa	You are so normal! Of course you are going to miss your daughter. There would be something wrong if you weren't going to miss her. I hated the thought of being away from my 2 and a half year old while I went into hospital to have my second baby... and my husband brought him to see me every day. I'm not surprised you cry at the thought of being so far away from her for so long and not having the option of going with them. I guess just use that time to chill out a bit, have some relaxing time by yourself, or just get a few things done that you haven't had a chance to yet. 5 days will go fast I'm sure... just think of how happy you will be when they get back. Maybe you can have a little party for 3 when they get back?|`|5dMw30kMaa	Your not crazy! Your just going to miss your baby! You've spent so much time raising her and taking care of her and now shes going to be gone for a few days so of course your gonna miss her :) Although pregnant hormones can always help with making your emotions stronger :P Good luck! And your lucky to have such a good hubby!|`|qzY6TuQmaa	i know the feel i cried so much when my MIL took my son for a day cuz i had never been away from my chile. but now im worst i don't trust anyone with him im even sceard to let him go to school i know its hard but i think u should do it in less u want to end up like me! and plus it will give u alot of time to rest and like u said it will give her some one on one daddy time
CpWGvDvRaa	Mom of Aaliyah (AKA December Baby) has been doing it tonight. <br>  <br>  But I agree. I have one, or more, tonight too. <br>  <br>  Mine is in high gear because I stirred the pot. :)|`|8sg02LwMaa	Huh?

Just don't stress it, it's just the internet and the rude people with no heart and life whatsoever behind it.|`|AA10526033	lol too funny that some people have nothing better to do with their time. ive really never heard of such a stupid waste of time!|`|rkSBHqtQaa	I haven't had one yet. I did read something about a "Veronica" earlier though. I guess its just a matter of time before I get one too. Lol. Apparently that's tonights theme. Thumbs down for everyone, regardless of the answer.|`|MeYILJeSaa	I had one for a while, then I switched my answers and questions to private.

O3EtP4vOaa	Welcome to my world!  I am in the same boat, PCOS, endometriosis, and my DH has varicocele.  I would have your husband checked, my hubby was able to be repaired to increase the count with surgery, also tell him to take vitamin C and zinc as it increases the quality of the spermies.  When you go to your doctor tell him everything, tell him you are very serious about concieving.  Are you going to a Reproductive Endocrinologist?  That is who you should be seeing if you have PCOS, I made the mistake of going to a regular fertility doctor and all they wanted to do is IVF.  My doctor now a RE is great and has said that he can get me a baby w/o IVF most likely.|`|j5F2wOapaa	opkay i have PCOS too and when talking to your doctor tell her to check your lactin level because sometimes when u have pcos your lactin level can he high and that can cause your body to not get  pregnant.
2643b839d5e10f75dfbb90af3502ceaeaa	i think you need to be told the truth about about how life begins,especially if you are wanting to know.i believe you are looking in the wrong place.it is the responsibility of your parents to tell you.you need to build that trust with them because with creating life comes a lot of responsibility.trust them and let them know that you really want to know,like start with how did i come about MOM and DAD.to give you an example of how i did my kids is that when they said Mommy has a baby in her stomach,i would say no she doesn't because if she did then it would be digested and that was as far as i went until they really wanted to know then i told them everything.i must have done a good job because i have been with two daughters giving birth to my Grandchildren.|`|40948a722ff133a751dba013bfbb4f32aa	hahahahahahah wow... yea the dude stick his SHLONG into her BEAVER... and he ERUPTS.. and the FERTILIZER makes her EGGS grow.. .and inside the egg is the baby... then it takes 9 months for the baby to come out|`|a9cda5651e6e9fb604be31ca617c8061aa	Listen, if you have to ask here, then you are too young. Once you reach a certain age and your body starts to go through changes, then your parents will tell you. But if you really must know (if you honestly can't wait for this), then just message me. I'll try to be helpful.|`|b6e9ee5ce760c76938d56ce091350417aa	How old are you? If you need to ask that, you're too young to be on Yahoo answers. Look at a biology book.|`|f5aaa015d43af692f605f83b31be74aaaa	if you have to ask that then you are to young and you need to get off of here.
XOnSRoR2aa	I'm probably a few years older than you are (I'm 17), and I'm still appallingly naive about some things, but my friends don't insult or exclude me for it because they are genuine friends, and to do so would be just incredibly lame, immature and mean-spirited.<br>  <br>  You could attempt to memorize the entire Urban Dictionary in order to be caught up on every sexual reference, slang term, insults and all that jazz currently being used, or you could just be yourself, and focus on learning things that will actually benefit you. Books like "The Perks of Being a Wallflower," and "On the Road" by Jack Keuroac will teach you some terms along with giving you perspective on growing up and helping you to realize that you're not the only one going through awkward, frustrating moments. You will naturally learn adult things as you grow up, and you don't need to put pressure on yourself to speed up the process. <br>  <br>  You aren't slow; you're innocent, and though that may seem like a major annoyance, it's also something very sweet and short-lasting.<br>  <br>  ~ Pax / Peace : )|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	Forget what they think.<br>  <br>  I am slow, too.  Not mentally anymore.  But, Even if I get faster at something physically, due to the severity of my health, I will forever physically slow.<br>  <br>  So you are not alone.|`|Hm7MtmYPaa	Urban dictionary.<br>  Taught me everything I know.<br>  =]<br>  <br>  I actually know quite a bit, and some things that are totally gross, and very inappropriate for Y!A.<br>  If you need any help, just email me.|`|kc2Sa7ibaa	Aw :) Don't worry. You actually remind me of myself at times hehe.<br>  <br>  What I do is when I don't know what a term means I find it on urbandictionary.com because it is basically a 'dictionary' full of slang. If you are really fed up with your friends I would go meet some new people because if they are annoyed at you about that then they obviously aren't very nice friends.<br>  <br>  Good Luck <33|`|jksa3MYBaa	if you hear a term that you don't know the definition to :<br>  <br>  www.urbandictionary.com|`|vy2x8khiaa	awe, don't feel bad, i'm the same kid in my circle of friends.<br>  but my friends find it endearing ? i dunno.<br>  it's obvious to me that they're not annoyed.<br>  like, i just learned what Special K was, rofl.<br>  in my health class my teacher was like,<br>  "DOES ANYONE KNOW WHAT SPECIAL K IS ?"<br>  and i just whispered "a cereal" and my best friend started laughing at me.<br>  but she told me what it was in the end.<br>  <br>  don't feel bad. if they're being that horrible to you don't go back to them.<br>  you want friends that understand you and who can help you when you don't know something. (:|`|x1qKGmzSaa	get new freinds. if they kick you out for something stupid like that, you dont need them. its good not to know stuff like that, just because theyre slutty and talking about sex, doess not mean you have to need to or should. be your self. you'll find people just like you. that like you for you.|`|cVVZrQ9faa	well if you want you can email me and ask me any questions you want to know ok <br>  <br>  cuz the reason i know alot of shyt iz b cuz we all kik it with alot of guys and gurls 77 the uys are allways messing with us and telling us words and we find out wat they mean by listening to how they use the word <br>  <br>  my email is sophiamira@ymail.com|`|kUTJ6AzHaa	urbandictionary.com is your new friend.<br>  <br>  oh and you need better friends<br>  they shouldnt kick you out of the group just cuz you dont understand things<br>  <br>  im 13 and i know too much because a. i live in california and b. i hang out with a lot of guys<br>  <br>  trust me, not knowing some things is a lot better.|`|4b7808b550192ac7ad93353a410ef2e4aa	do some research i know i did that when i didnt know much about sex lol or sex terms<br>  <br>  and thats kinda of mean of your friends to kick you out of yalls group becuz you dont have the same dirty minds they do .|`|o23MmGOOaa	you need better friends! Maybe you could have a chat to your mum or an aunt and ask about sex, at least then you know you are getting the right information. Explain that you heard some things and are curious
36PrVK7Oaa	Honestly I would get every one you can, and use the one that is best for each situation. Baby is going to be so happy being next to mama.|`|oMpNorCfaa	I think the first one would actually be best for both you and your husband!  It seems very functional and it says it is for newborn up to 3+ years.  The fact that it can work 8 different ways seems very convenient for comfort for your baby and you.  And there is nothing wrong with a man carrying a baby in a sling like that it is a cocoa brown so it's not too 'feminine' for a man to use.<br>  And the second one it says right in the description it's better for 4 months old and up.  So if it can't carry a newborn safely and comfortably I wouldn't recommend it.<br>  And the soft cotton sounds comfortable in the first one!<br>  Good luck and Have fun with your baby!|`|iKLdGe1xaa	Get all of them? Haha jokes. I like the first one it says it can be used for newborn to three years so is more practical for long time use.<br>  The second one wouldn't o with all your outfits haha and it is only for 2-4 months. Take a look at this one <a href="http://www.babyktan.com/black.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.babyktan.com/black.html</a><br>  I like the black better.|`|XhJL7tnwaa	I never liked those. I've had the most success (my husband too) with a moby wrap: <a href="http://www.mobywrap.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mobywrap.com/</a><br>  <br>  I've even been able to carry my older children in them with no pain!|`|u53ISZoXaa	I would say the second one.  The others look to unseccure.  You dont want the baby falling out if you just happen to be bending a weird way and he/she wiggles around!  The design is very cool and gender nueteral as well!|`|dVzPKGGiaa	I like the look of the 2nd and 3rd one, but you and your husband need to see which ones are most comfortable!|`|qzY6TuQmaa	i say 2nd and 3rd u can always use ur husbands when hes not useing it or y not get all 3|`|h59Bc4wfaa	The 2nd one SUCKS! I got it for my son as a gift from my grandmother. It literally folds your baby in half, and all they do is scream. When you get the box, the baby model on it was all red in the face from screaming, too.<br>  <br>  I would go with the 3rd one if I went with any of them.<br>  <br>  The best ones IMO are the kinds that have the leg holes and they just sit in them. Kinda like a cloth booster set with a sling.|`|EsaFg8eaaa	I loooove the second one. Id say buy all three if you have the money. <br>  <br>  You don't know what your son will be like one might suite him better than another.<br>  <br>  <br>  Im so jealous your hubby is excited for the baby, everytime I talk about having kids my husband gets all like i dont care lol.|`|SaRDq9iLaa	I like the 2nd one the best!  Good luck!|`|6AvVVzsnaa	I would share instead of buying 2 unless you have twins.|`|uQc4UA2Caa	i REALLY like the black one i might even get one myself :)|`|980cd82a18459010574ced1a4cc818f1aa	2 :)

HCvJ0AGnaa	Distraught, ashamed, saddened........<br>  <br>  I would have NO option but to blame myself and my lack of parenting skills. I would be concerned if my child at 15 was having sex, let alone 12...<br>  <br>  Speaks volumes of the family and their lack of morals. I don't blame Alfie, he is a child, still under parental guidance and support. His actions were in response of the lack of advice, morals and support he was given from his mum and dad. NOT just him, his own sister was also pregnant at the same age, both hardly attend school and to here him in that interview saying 'whats financially' I find shocking. <br>  <br>  Society seems to be slipping, we have the highest rates of teenage pregnancy in Europe, kids are out in the dark drinking and committing crimes, while their own parents have no concern where they are , nor who they are with. Nothing will change until people who become parents are forced to face their responsibility's and act as I and others do, as caring. loving, moral parents!!|`|NKuQh4sSaa	I would be devastated . I am the mother of a teenage girl (14 tomorrow), a 12 year old girl and a 10 year old son , and already I have sat down with my daughters to talk to them about sex . I am going to have to approach it a lot different where my son is concerned as he is autistic. I have explained to my daughters , not only the risks of pregnancy , but also the risks of STDs . I have ensured the best I can that they understand about sexual relationships and that until they leave school , their education is more important than boys . I am taking responsibility for my daughters sex education as what is taught in school isn't worth much and a lot of parents leave it to schools to teach them instead of being responsible in teaching their children about sex and relationships, and I want my daughters to be more informed than believing in playground myths.<br>   What was both sets of parents thinking of when they let them stay over ? There was also rumours of 2 other boys claiming paternity of that poor little mite . What kind of life is that child really going to have ? And how much more likely will it be of history repeating itself when she is a teenager with grandparents and parents like that ?|`|Uz16kQEYaa	I would feel a complete failure as a parent. I would feel that i let myself and my child down in the teaching of morals,standards and respect.My son is 13 next month.He has had the talks at school about sex Ed.But that's not enough,,the emotional aspect of a sexual relationship needs to be addressed,,respecting their own and other peoples bodies need to be addressed.<br>  Some people still think that sex is a taboo subject but kids are starting younger. I have 3 adult children,all childless for now,hopefully the 2 smaller ones will follow them in that achievement.Talking in the home openly and honestly is a good start in ending these babies having babies.|`|prqrQcd1aa	Honestly.. I wouldn't allow my 13 year old son to be spending the night at his girl friends house.. and i'd really hope to god he wouldn't be having sex at that age to begin with!<br>  <br>  At least he is bringing life into the world and not taking it away though i would guess. It's all over the damn news world wide what happend to an old friend of mine.|`|kGkUG0fKaa	i think that is sad. I have a 6yr old son and it is my duty as  his mother to educate him on many things in life including unprotected sex to help him prevent matters like this. I will not be a distant parent to even allow my son to come home at 13 with a baby but I can't be everywhere at all times so if it does happen then I will do what needs to be done. <br>  My friends and i just had this conversation and my friend said she would take her daughter to the clinic for an abortion. I don't believe in that procedure so i can't and wouldn't ask my son's pregnant chick to do such a thing or ask him to ask her. I would help them to understand the severity of the situation and take on my roll as grandmother. I would do my best to see to it that my son and the mother finish school and get their diplomas and degrees and find stability with their finances and once they are able to parent their child without the very angry grandparent then I will take a step back and let them live their lives so i can live mine. I would not be happy with my son, but he is my son and his actions is a result of my parenting and how I repsond to those actions is also a result of my parenting. If i want my son to be responsible I have to teach him and show him, even if it means rectifying his mistakes and becoming a grandmother at a young age and teaching my son how to be a parent. <br>  However 13 is just too young. I will keep a nice eye on my baby to make sure these little females are not tainting his mind into sex and vice versa.|`|g0xB8Z1Oaa	I would be totally bereft!<br>  I have three kids, 16,12 and 8, and hope they have been brought up to know better.<br>  I wouldn't be surprised to find out it wasn't the boy's child, given his age and development, the teen mum was seeing three boyfriends at the same time here.|`|OI3bf4yjaa	I would honestly be heartbroken. What else could I do? They are still my child, and I'm going to support them no matter what.<br>  <br>  I would ATLEAST try and convince them to set the baby up for adoption, so that it has a chance to live a NORMAL life. There are so many couples out there trying to have babies, and just can't... so they're looking to adopt.|`|z0XRuVwSaa	i would be gobsmacked and wonder why such a young child who wasn't even in puberty wanted to have sex . as some boys don't start to get erections until they hit puberty|`|Bg6txvxqaa	I would be completely traumatised!<br>  <br>  There's something wrong with the kid's of this world, what makes them want to grow up so quickly?!|`|xdOgQPEkaa	this is old news. we have already discussed this a million times a day since it happened. <br>  <br>  whats up with the Octomom though?? she needs profesh help.|`|u00IalCZaa	I would feel like  a big failure.|`|9QAVNJtWaa	i would feel like id failed my son but id still support him cos hes my son|`|8N3PRy3Raa	If this was my child, I would not give it up. Why would anyone want to see a baby grow up without its real Mum and Dad and the parents would not see the steps in there life from the potty training to the baby steps and to the talking. If i was told to give the baby up i wouldnt i would want to be there through it all I would feel disapointed annoyed with my self but still i wouldnt give the baby up.<br>  I hope this is enough advise to the person who has this baby. If this is your child you shouldnt give it up because your the one who will miss out. This is my opion, remeber if this person gives their child up they are the one missing out|`|hvu6Z8dnaa	I think in all honesty that in the case of this little boy, as that is what he is, his parents should have been more vigilant.  However, I am no fool, and as I was sexually active at the tender age of fourteen I do know that this goes on and there is little that can be done after the event.  Its been very well publicised that we have a ridiculously high teen pregnancy rate in this country and I do think that it is the responsibility of not only the school to educate our youngsters better but also the parents.  I was a teen mum (I was eighteen when my daughter was born), but I was also mature enough to be a mum at that age and now have three children, another on the way and am married to the father of my children and we have never claimed benefits.  This boy cannot provide for his child.  In any way shape or form, he is too young to get a job, and he doesn't even get pocket money!|`|e60754e2c47d3732e670fc3cfec1373eaa	it would be a tough situation for all involved. personally i'd try and help my son the best i could, i know how it feels to be 'given away'. but more importantly when my children become such an age, i will be teaching them that sex should only be an issue when you can fully understand the consequences and when you are sure you are in love with that person. i think that's were a lot of parents go wrong, they leave the sex education up to schools and its a lot to be desired. i certainly won't be allowing my teenage daughter/ son to be having sex under my roof!!! i think a lot of these kids think baby's are dolls, baby grow up- and then the real parenting begins. i feel instead of schools concentrating on how it is bringing up a baby, they should focus on 3 year olds and up.|`|r7cDvk4Kaa	i thinks the parent should be dissapointed but the parent should also be supportive|`|c4d179c54efba1c73a993ab6f248346aaa	I thought they found out that the girl lied and the 13 was NOT the father..|`|nrqWwQBXaa	my kids would know better then to do that. i will know where my kids are at all times so they wont be thinking about doing some thing like that. but if it ever did happen i would stand behind my kid all the way help him?
vygYFdsSaa	Being late doesn't always mean pregnancy. Often there are many other causes of a late period. You can't really know either way yet; you may just be testing a bit too soon, or your urine might be diluted with liquid so the hCG isn't yet detectable. I'd go to the doctor's for a urine and blood test if I was you. If you want to hold off on the doctor's visit for a bit, take a test in a few days (if period still doesn't arrive) with your FIRST MORNING'S URINE. This is important because it has the highest concentration of hCG and therefore is most likely to test positive if you are pregnant. Good luck sweetie|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Your belly being swollen is due to bloating which could be PMS as well. Wait another couple of days and test again if you still dont' have your period|`|Uy8ntukjaa	You might not have enough hcg in your system to show up on the test. Home tests usually don't detect a level below 25 m/IU. Take another test in a few days if your period doesn't come. You aren't in the clear just yet.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bobrow.net/kimberly/birth/hcglevels.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bobrow.net/kimberly/birth/hcg...</a>|`|hAuemuWTaa	Well it may be a bit too early i say this as u could off fell preggers late in tin your cycle.

Wait for another couple of days than i say test. <br>  If still not preggers than and no period than i say go to dr and get a blood test <br>  Goopd luck with the process of finding out.|`|AA10526033	its is possible as many things can throw your period off. ive been months late and not preggo due to stress. if it doesnt come soon and u keep getting negatives go to the dr just for a check up.|`|9UYl8ErFaa	wait at least a week or 2 and take a test|`|Fx77zYhWaa	If the test was negative then you're probably not pregnant.  You can be late various reason so unless you have a positive pregnant don't go announcing.  Wait another week and test again if your period doesn't come.|`|rpZRlJMzaa	just wait a few days and test again! i waited till i was 14 days late before i tested! lol =]<br>  <br>  gooodluck!|`|tNWOz2HWaa	better do it again, maybe the first one did not work. its important to make sure. maybe you should go to the doctor, just in case...|`|KIZVWREHaa	I would wait another week .

lmPII858aa	Yes. I have PCOS, and my cycles are so irregular, that I can go without a period for a year, then have one that lasts two monts straight. I tried a combination of Clomid and Provera.

yilREYWGaa	I just found out I am about 4 weeks... I keep getting period cramps! <br>  <br>  My sister is 27 weeks and she had bleeding on tuesday night and it wasnt just spotting it was like when you have your period and you wipe.<br>  <br>  She was taken to the maternity unit where they did scans and found the same as you... the cervix was tightly closed and the baby was fine.<br>  They really did not seem worried although they did not know where the blood was coming from it was obvious it wasnt from the womb.<br>  <br>  So try to relax and if you have anymore make sure you go back.<br>  <br>  x|`|kaqPSgTVaa	You are probably ok. Keep an eye out. Schedule an appointment iwth your doctor and keep an eye out for any more spotting. It's too early to see a heart beat btw.|`|Uy8ntukjaa	I wouldn't panic, it isn't abnormal to have a tiny bit of bleeding now and again. When you're pregnant your cervix is engorged with blood and can spot lightly from sex or numerous other activities. As long as your cervix is still closed and the baby is fine you don't need to worry.|`|AA10526033	im sure your fine. i spotted with all 3 of my babies early into pregnancy and they were all fine. i think its pretty normal.|`|bpYn0ZD1aa	Well first off calm down. Being panicked wont help your baby. If you are this worried see another doctor. Just like the saying "Seek a second opinion". Good luck. Hope all is well. ^_^|`|hAuemuWTaa	Tyhe palpitations have to do with anxiety. The blood has to be from the scaring of the internal exam u had. Some women can get cramping in early pregnany, which is normal. But if they get very bad and get heaps of blood and clots than u possibly having a miscarriage. <br>  When i was 5.5 weeks i had a ultrasound and they didnt find a heart beat which the baby was too small. They did a transvirginal ultra sound and found a heart beat the heart beat is probably there but can't been seen at this rate.|`|l6EO5pDDaa	its normal to spot early. its just part of the uterine lining that the womb doesnt need.<br>  <br>  dont worry if the doctors tell you that everything is good. <br>  <br>  <br>  and GOOD LUCK!|`|rpZRlJMzaa	no it was prolly just spotting. i spotted when i was 6 weeks along. and freaked out! but everything was fine!|`|r7cDvk4Kaa	my mother went through the same thing you will be fine..[:|`|KDqzj3isaa	Hi there i fully understand just how scary this can be, i know a woman at my work had this around the same time as you 5 weeks,  her midwife said its around about where your period would of been and there was still excess blood in your lining that comes out known as spotting and its normal along with cramping. <br>  <br>  I asked my midwife when i was preggies and she said it can be common, i know its stressful still keep a Eye on it and if you have anymore blood go to your Doctor for a check up better safe then sorry aye.  there is heaps and heaps about 5 week spottn if you goggle it too. <br>  i also found this<br>  <br>  Spotting during pregnancy <br>  <br>  Spotting is light bleeding similar to your period and it can happen at any time during pregnancy, but it is most common during the first trimester. Although chances are that it is nothing, the odds of possible complications should be ruled out. Some women complain of lower back pain or stomach pain accompanying spotting. About 20 percent of women experience some vaginal spotting or bleeding during the first trimester of pregnancy. It is not necessarily cause for alarm;  <br>  for example, light bleeding around a week to 10 days after conception can be brought on by the implantation of the egg in the lining of the uterus. However, because bleeding is the most common warning sign of impending miscarriage, any sign of spotting or bleeding should be reported to your healthcare provider immediately. <br>  Spotting is when a bit of blood is passed through the vagina. Normally it doesn't reach the underwear, but rather is swiped with toilet paper after a bowel movement or urination. The blood can be pink-tinged mucus, rusty brown or bright red. Spotting can be a one-time occurrence, or it can last for several hours or even several days. <br>  <br>  and this other site too<br>  I've been spotting a little. Should I be concerned?<br>  <br>  Light bleeding or "spotting" during pregnancy happens more often than you might think, with up to 25 percent of all pregnant women experiencing it. Spotting –- bleeding that isn't continuous and isn't enough to fill a tampon or pad -- is especially common in the first three months. In many cases there's no cause for alarm, but you should call your doctor whenever you have bleeding during pregnancy -– even if it has stopped by the time you notice signs of it. You'll probably need to go in for an exam to rule out any complications, and to make sure you and your baby are fine.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  What causes spotting? <br>  <br>  At the very beginning of your pregnancy, spotting can result when the fertilized egg attaches itself to the lining of the uterus. This type of bleeding -- which generally occurs around six to twelve days after conception -- is usually light and only lasts a day or two.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Other causes of spotting include a vaginal infection or a benign growth in the cervix (polyp). Some women also bleed when their cervix is irritated or inflamed, which can happen after having a Pap smear or intercourse. For this reason, your health practitioner will probably ask you some questions, such as whether increased physical activity makes the bleeding worse, or whether you notice it during or after intercourse. In addition, certain drugs can prolong bleeding, so be sure to mention any medications you are taking to your doctor.|`|ksWm9eCBaa	I spotted a bit every month right at the 'regular' time my period would've been for 1st 4 mos of pregnancy.  As you know from being pregnant before, cramping early is not unusual:  those muscles around the lower back that are rather connected to some that wrap around towards the front (close to ovarian area), get stretched in the first couple of months as the uterus gets heavier & 'settles' into place.  For me, coupled with the spotting, I was terrified--but it was nothing.  (the spotting WAS a concern, but it just stopped 5th month) If doc says no worries, then no worries...unless you'd rather hear from a second?
M3pjhIecaa	The baby will be completely safe at this stage and it would have needed a significant amount of power to the stomach to possibly do any damage. <br>  <br>  And folks she said don't make any judgements, don't suppose any of you listened to that bit.|`|vygYFdsSaa	The baby is safer than you think tucked inside your uterus. A poke in the vaginal area would not be likely to hurt the baby. Can you describe the area better?

Dont let him lay a hand on you ok!|`|9GvflDg1aa	If you have severe cramps in your lower abdomen, then worry. <br>  <br>  But why would you allow your husband to get away with hitting you while pregnant? If you don't want anyone to judge you, then you should have made up a false story.<br>  <br>  <br>  Because there are a lot of pregnant hormones on here that really get stirred up when we are told things like that.|`|Q6nOeK6Caa	first off; a man shouldn't hit his wife ESPECIALLY if she's pregnant. <br>  <br>  second ; go to the dr and tell them what happened.|`|0cfba6ec58258d9277443cf769413b9eaa	first off all you need to get away from your husband if he'll hit you or push you around when your pregnant then what do you think he'll do to your baby ? The baby should be ok but you should see your doctor to be sure but if he keeps up the physical abuse then you could very well lose your baby !|`|OI3bf4yjaa	I'm sure your baby is fine. I would also suggest telling your husband to take anger management classes.. because if he's being aggressive towards you, he's more than likely going to be like that towards the baby.

It's easier to repeat the vowel sound than consonants.<br>  <br>  Also, choosing the longer first name will give her more options if she wishes to be called by a nickname. If you think about nicknames for Rebecca, Becky and Becca probably come instantly to mind, but I can't think of any easy nicknames for Tara.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, Rebecca is a pretty common name, while Tara is not. Calling her Tara will reduce the chance of there being four [or some such number] other Rebeccas in her classes. Of course, there is also the common option of going by a middle name, which means that either combination will allow adjustments for individuality.<br>  <br>  <br>  Overall, I think I lean slightly toward Rebecca Tara, because it would be easier to say.<br>  <br>  Best wishes :D|`|NyMmeHlEaa	Im kind of having a wierd vibe from this name maybe its the Ra Ra sound in Tara rebecca but that combo sounds old fashioned.you should try Teri Rebecca and if you insist on putting Rebecca first put emphasis on the i in Teri|`|yQFHoEqxaa	Hmmm...Tara Rebecca sounds better.

2NdSyZMBaa	you very well could be. but if your stressing yourself out about being pregnant your can actually cause your Body to show symptoms of pregnancy. stress can also mess with your period. stress and stop you from getting your period. <br>  <br>  ovulation is very tricky to figure out. most women ovulate only about 1 to 2 days a month. so if you had sex 3 days before or after your ovulation date then it is possible.<br>  <br>  that discharge you had might be your body ovulating. you can tell when you ovulate if your cervical mucus is lose and sticky. the mucus will be like uncooked egg whites. <br>  <br>  i think what you need to do is to take a test or two. even if one comes back positive and the other doesn't make an appointment with your GYN. they will be able to do other tests to make sure you are or are not pregnant.<br>  <br>  <br>  relax take the test.|`|9UYl8ErFaa	yes sounds like it|`|VFUdAtrHaa	Take a test ..but it sounds like you could deff be pregnant.

Personally, I either think that you are having a hormonal change, possibly pregnant. I would take a test, but don't rule out natural change. Any woman is subject to change with age, any substance abuse, and stress levels. I know of people who have had similar effects, and it can mean nothing. Take the route of ruling possibilities out one by one. Good luck!|`|r5VFLa84aa	Hi, I am the official gyno for Yahoo Answers. You are in FACT pregnant.

SSgjlQGoaa	She needs to take all her documentation and file for custody before he has a chance. It will just make it easier in the long run. As long as there has been documents about him being abusive I don't see any reason he would get any unsupervised visits at all. Good Luck!|`|kaqPSgTVaa	He doesn't stand a chance he is just doing this to torture her because he can't do it in person anymore.|`|szjpsPdXaa	I agree.  If he really wanted the child, he would take her to court.  She was not married to this guy, doesn't sound like he pays support, so I doubt she would get into trouble for moving away.  Why would she have a problem if he is unstable, that would all the better for her.

UbCzA2JVaa	I love both Ella and Keely! I like Ella Paige better than Keely Lorelai, but I would choose Keely Paige over Ella Paige because it's less common.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  :)|`|IDmaxViIaa	Wow I love your girls names as this is from my heart: I can tell by these girl names that you like that you have a beautiful and loving mind nothing sick about it. These girls names are names that most people would say are beautiful angel's names there beautiful. I love your girls’ names and how your loving mind came up with these lovely names. I think your names represent laughter and love! This is no Joke and don't think I’m a crazy person cause I’m not.<br>  <br>  I love both but i love Ella Paige.

2aWIXkq5aa	I think its up to the person individually to decide when they want one. i got one when i was 14 but i kept knocking it out and having to get it repierecd but last Year i got it done again i was 17 and have had it since. It stung a bit when i got mine done but a couple days later and it was fine. you must remember to clean it twice a day when you first get it done to make sure it doesn't get infected. mine got a few lumps on the inside when i first got it done but its your bodies way of reacting and getting used to the new piercing. most of my friends have one and there isn't really a social impact, they are pretty and cosmetic, it depends on where you live to whether or not people will react to a piercing, where i live its just a norm not a big deal. good luck.|`|K5DqpD6qaa	i think you should at least be 14<br>  my brother got it done and he says he cant remember it hurting at all<br>  all that happens is they put a needle in your nose then put the stud in<br>  it made his eyes water so much though haha it looked like he was crying<br>  i think you should get one because they are so cool<br>  i plan on getting on soon but my mum will murder me<br>  definatley get one because you'll never know until you've tried it<br>  and if you dont like it then take it out<br>  <br>  good luck!!|`|EEu0uRpaaa	my mom had one but took it out because she would forget she had it in and when her nose itched she would go to scratch and end up pulling it down OUCH!|`|1U7yLEf9aa	It's not the fastest to close up actually. I have had mine out for about a year now and there is still a hole there. Same with my friend... Hers has been out for over a year and still has a hole. It does hurt. I did mine at home when I was 14. Made sure everything was very sterile though. You cant go get it done unless your parents agree and I think you have to be at least 14. I'd say if you are older than 14 and you want one do it but if you dont like it take it out sooooooon because you WILL be stuck with a hole in your nose...|`|pksLpEvPaa	i think it is totoally cute...reallly attractive i mean all ages hav it starting from 12 n on i belive...i means if u dontlike it u could alays take it out but the hole will not go away but the hole wont show..i take mine out soetimes but it doesnt look that i have it done...n no it doesnt hurt...everyone will lie it...its hot!!! Good luck|`|HvTv5E6Iaa	Yes, it is a very beautiful accessory one girl can adorn on her...<br>  and believe me this can never get wrong...simple care is needed after it.<br>  Its one thing that looks cute on every girl who has ever tried it...<br>  <br>  Yes its a big decision for u too, coz u r young n after u`ve had it ur mind might wander about some other things u wanna try... so remember, be sure u that want it.. <br>  there is no harm in it.. you`ll simply look great in it..<br>  n its safe.... <br>  <a href="http://www.uga.edu/ugazine/past/s2005/piercing.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.uga.edu/ugazine/past/s2005/pi...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  happy piercing.......|`|AjqO1aJgaa	I think you will look like a piece of trash. Beautiful? A chunk of metal hanging out of your nose? Hardly. Social impact? Everyone will assume you think you're something special but couldn't find a way to actually show it. And it will instantly rule you out of several careers.<br>  <br>  But hey, it's your body.|`|6AvVVzsnaa	It's up to you. I got an monroe 2 years ago and at first my mom didn't like it and now she's used to it. Make sure the studio is licensed and clean before you get anything done there.
nrqWwQBXaa	no her name does not only mean what she looks like?|`|AjqO1aJgaa	Kids are named at birth, not when they are 14.<br>  <br>  And I sincerely hope you'd feel bad if you didn't notice LONG before your daughter became so obese that she had a serious problem! You're her parent; it's your job to make sure she eats healthy.|`|mMBzpldbaa	lol<br>  <br>  a) i wouldn't name a child after food, that's just stupid<br>  <br>  b) i wouldn't let her get so fat and disgusting. there is no excuse for obesity. i would raise healthy, intelligent, beautiful children if i had them. as it stands, i hate children and would not have them.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  *prepares for fatties giving thumbs down for this one*|`|2H6j4j8taa	I know a girl who is actually named Bonnie (which means plump and sizable) and she is fat, which is rather unfortunate.|`|0e0a0f1828f99f87ea3d5e5bc8cbd46daa	No, that's just ridiculous.

I would feel bad for her because even people on yahoo answers are being cruel about it.

YWEGe41Uaa	If your hormone is doubling every 2-3 days then it almost certainly not ectopic. I've had an ectopic and that's how it's diagnosed initially. The hormones don't double, they stay quite low all the time and sometimes even decrease. <br>  It will probably be stretching pains, your womb is getting much more blood than usual sent to it. I wouldn't work too much.<br>  Hope you feel better soon xxx|`|lmPII858aa	I had the same problem when I was pregnant, the truth is, it could be any number of things, the position  of the uterus, a problem with the pregnancy, or just your body adjusting to the pregnancy. Usually it's nothing, but if it keeps going on for more than a week, or you start to bleed heavily, call your doctor. Good luck!|`|kaqPSgTVaa	You should probably call your doctor about this to be safe.|`|DMsjoZwSaa	I had HORRIBLE back pain...I mentioned this to my doctor and he said it was fine and was probably due to my body's changes, especially my hips beginning to open. <br>  <br>  I eventually found these awesome patches from the drug store for muscle aches...they smell almost minty and add a numbing/tingling sensation, definitely enough numbing to help me fall asleep at night. My doctor also recommended regular Tylenol for any pregnancy related pain... Make sure to not use any heating pads and avoid hot baths/showers. Also, start stretching-I've found that if I'm laying straight on my back and pull one knee up to my chest for a 10-count, then switch, it really really helps loosen me up.
rIP2RgnRaa	Yes, this is exactly what is supposed to happen! I have a three month old that I am exclusively breastfeeding and I experienced the same thing. Since I started breasrfeeding I have been talking to other women about their breastfeeding experience and everyone says that the time required for the infant to empty the breast decreases with time due to the increasing efficiency of the baby (he/she get bigger and stronger and learns how to suck better) and the increasing efficiency of your own body to provide milk. I've also read a number of books (for example the "Nursing Mother's Companion" by Huggins) which say the same thing. Breastfeeding is considered to be "established" after 6 weeks. So don't worry! You're doing fine! If you are searching for any information about breastfeeding whatsoever I would recommend Dr; Jack Newman's site (see address below). He has excellent articles and info on just about everything related to breastfeeding.|`|n3PE2lvDaa	yup absolutely. My daughter is 9 months old and when she is hungry she can drain a breast in about 5 minutes. Just feel your breast before and after a feed if you are worried. It should be noticably different. At the start of a feed I am really full and at the end, I feel like an old lady with saggy boobs (haha, to much info sorry)<br>  You can tell what is going in by what is comming out. If your baby stops wetting as much and stops putting on weight then be concerned. But it sounds normal to me. Its called power feeding.|`|NpSVEC2naa	both baby and breasts become more efficient. baby can take bigger mouthfulls and your milk comes in faster and stronger.|`|qHwI9ev8aa	Breastfeeding is a learned skill, after a few weeks babies become more efficient and take less time to take in their meals. You're doing fine mommy, don't worry!
6SwaWSoyaa	I think because your last name is an actually name, pretend it is a middle name for the first name. In this case Sophia Miranda is a lot of a ending sound.<br>  <br>  How about Sophie Miranda.<br>  If you must though go with Sophia Danielle.<br>  Avoid the "trendy names" they will quickly go out of fashion. Harlow s masculine and Rayne is a feminized spelling of a masculine sounding name and word.|`|kPl8TTzNaa	Sophia Danielle Miranda, definitely is the best. I do not think it is long at all. I do not care for Rain, epsecially that spelling, and Harlow is masculine,|`|b328a9d35b4d38f11fb5ea37fe0b727aaa	I like Sophia. I am trying to convince my husband on it.<br>  <br>  No on the Rayne. Hate it.<br>  <br>  Harlow? Not so sure about.<br>  <br>  I don't like Danielle, either.|`|5edYekPjaa	Sophia Sandra Miranda|`|jhBRNvIxaa	Sophie <br>  <br>  I also like Sophia Danielle Miranda... not too long!<br>  <br>  Mine name before Marriage is Stephanie Margaret Camarena|`|iKLdGe1xaa	I adore Sophia Danielle Miranda. My name is Sophie (kinda similar to Sophia) and I get called Soph by some people and also Sofa (Ug).|`|x6easjsvaa	I like Sophia Harlow best, then Rane.

8Rn2pX4jaa	The next signs to look for are contractions.  Intense, regular contractions.    Take your breath away, make you lose your train of thought contractions that come every 5-10 minutes for at least 2 hours and get more intense as time goes on.  Laying down, drinking lots of water or taking a warm bath do nothing to ease or slow them.<br>  <br>  I lost my mucus plug weeks ago, and I am still pregnant and past due.  I was told by my doc, that most of the time your water does not break until you are in active labor.  And even then, it is often broke by the doctor to expedite your labor.|`|Oj5oZYJ4aa	I never lost a mucus plug and my water never broke on it's own either (except with my 3rd when it broke when she was being born) So the first signs of labor that I had were very light contractions that did not hurt but felt like a really tight cramps that were every 5 min. apart.  Eventually the contractions got stronger and I was in labor.  This is kind of gross but the other feeling I got was that I had to go #2 but never really had to it was just all the pressure and baby moving down.  Trust me even if you don't loose your mucus plug or your water doesn't break when the contractions start to hurt you will know it's labor. Good luck|`|Uy8ntukjaa	Usually it is your water breaking and contractions starting in.|`|9UYl8ErFaa	water breaks and contractions start too
2NwI03Mtaa	yes i took one and got my period a week later
6bryNB1raa	lol if u dont belive it now u will in 9 months lol congrats. and please leave some pregnancy tests in shop for everyone else lol|`|Uy8ntukjaa	Some women feel like their period is coming for many many weeks throughout their pregnancy. Some women also never experience pregnancy symptoms. The line on the tests aren't going to get darker necessarily, it's normal for them to be lighter than the control line. You need to go to the doctor and get examined to make sure everything is going fine and you're healthy. Congratulations!|`|AA10526033	LOL Your pregnant! You shouldn't be feeling anything yet. most women don't get morning sickness until after 6 wks. With my first i was the same way i took 12 tests and still didn't believe it as i was cramping. Same with my other 2 though it didn't take as long for me to believe it i just really thought my period was coming! Congrats!!! Go see a dr!|`|IjOEpqgOaa	I was the same way.. I didn't think i was either. I understand! Don't worry hun.<br>  <br>  But sure enough--- I was! .. I didn't have NO sysmptoms at all! All thru June i went to the beach, had a little fun, it was my birthday! Then 4th july came around.. Never had nothing.<br>  <br>  i took millions of test. 5 first resp. (all said no) then i went to clearblue they said PREGNANT!<br>  <br>  I found out july 23rd that i really was, i went to a doc. I was 5wks & 5days!<br>  <br>  <br>  I started getting my symptoms til i was about 10wks. && its not fun!<br>  <br>  Congrats missy! && Good luck!|`|2PcwdQ6qaa	well congrats hunni, i just found out this morning that i am PREGNANT too, i have hd 3 miscarriages, so im very happy but scared at the same time,<br>  <br>  with my first pregnancy (which was a healthy one had a little girl who is 2) i had no symptoms of sickness at all, but i seemed to smell everything and got itchy nipples yes that's right lol!<br>  <br>  just go see your doctor and get everything confirmed im so happy for you!!<br>  <br>  xxxxxx|`|RdF1J7zVaa	I actually started getting symptoms at about 51/2 weeks so don't worry those terrible symptoms are coming soon (depends on the person but usually).  And I do no exactly how you feel, I prayed to have symptoms so I would no for sure.  Once that morning sickness hit, I wanted to blast myself in the head though!!! How about you just wish for the tender /vieny breasts and the back pains and frequent peeing... I wouldn't wish the nausea on anyone lol!!!<br>  goodluck with the pregnancy|`|hvu6Z8dnaa	Honey, believe it, you are pregnant.  No way could you have had all those pos tests and not be!  I do know how you feel, not wanting to get too excited and all that, but I really wouldn;t worry, you will get all the syptoms soon enough I'm sure.  I am currently pregnant with my fourth baby and each time its been different, every one is different, so just relax and make an appointment with your GP.|`|NfbDQ1tYaa	haha i got sore bb's about the week after finding out, i had a scan yesterday due to some bleeding and im only 5 weeks so i was 4 weeks before my boobs started hurting, but if your going of ur last period then technically your only 2 weeks pregnant, but they will say 4, i didnt believe it until after my scan last nite after taking 12 tests lol!!|`|DMsjoZwSaa	Some women NEVER get morning sickness, and every pregnancy is different when it comes to symptoms. <br>  <br>  It's VERY rare to get a false positive, especially with the digital tests...if the hormone is present, the test will show it...And you know what that means! <br>  <br>  Make a Dr's appointment ASAP, they WILL test you there to be sure. And TRUST ME, you don't want morning sickness! I'm 6 months along and I STILL can't keep food down! I lost 30lbs and now have to take special vitamins and supplements...:( no fun.|`|ksWm9eCBaa	Those "period pains" you mention are probably those muscles in your lower back and towards the front (sorta by ovarian area) that hold up your uterus.  They seem to stretch and pull early on, as that uterus begins to get heavy and "assumes position".  (that won't last forever...guess the muscles get used to it?).  I didn't believe my pregnancy tests either---never had morning sickness. Just a lil queasy PM...thought it was due to "sinus drip" those first 4 weeks!  Some never get early symptoms at all.  That doc visit will help!!! Grand luck to ya!!!|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Most women don't get symptoms until after their period is missed and some never get symptoms. Sorry.<br>  <br>  You have had 15 positives by the way...the cheap tests are just as accurate and the lines DON'T get darker because you didn't have enough hormone in your system for them to be dark. They don't get darker, if anything they may fade a little.|`|ccqOhsGtaa	Hiya,<br>  <br>  I have just got my BFP on a Digital today!!  I have cramps aswell like I am going to come on my period but I think this is normal,  I also have headaches, very sore breasts & they have gone so dark!!  I just feel really tired & yesterday I felt really sick at dinner time.<br>  <br>  Congratulations & Have a happy & Healthy 9 Months xxx
CPwdVc4caa	Looks like a fabulous breakfast to me!!  I seem to only ever want fattening breakfasts like bagels with mountains of cream cheese, so I applaud you for choosing something healthy.<br>  <br>  As for the milk, drink up!!  You'll need the calcium more than ever, since the baby will steal it from your bones if you don't take enough in.  Any dairy, so long as it's pasteurized and doesn't have a crazy amount of fat or added sugars is great.|`|z0XRuVwSaa	sounds lovely but also don't forget you need to feel full as a milkshake might not satisfy ur hunger|`|u53ISZoXaa	that sounds good and healthy.<br>  Because of morning sickness i ate crackers, cheerios and other starchy type foods.  If you're only 4 weeks prego and alreay worried about what you're eating, sit back and relax.  Enjoy this time and try no to be too over protective and health nutty.|`|q4tTabfjaa	I think anything you fancy is good, but try not to chew on coal, as it contains arsenic.|`|9QAVNJtWaa	porridge with water is a super healthy breakfast|`|hAuemuWTaa	Yumo thats sound nice dont give up or limited the milk as u will need the calcium. fOR U AND THE BABY.|`|6ymvTZncaa	This is a wonderful site I used when I was pregnant, you can even track what you are eating.  Here is an article, and there <br>  are recipes all over the site.  If you need more, just google "Healthy breakfast while pregnant" or something along those lines<br>  <br>  <a href="http://babyfit.sparkpeople.com/articles.asp?id=435" rel="nofollow">http://babyfit.sparkpeople.com/articles....</a><br>  <br>  Oh, and drink some green smoothies (google recipes too), sounds gross, but it really  tastes good, and is so good for you!  Here is one I made today:<br>  <br>  Creamy Green Smoothie<br>  What You Need:<br>  3 or 4 handfuls raw spinach<br>  1 cup coconut milk<br>  1 cup fresh pineapple juice<br>  Water - just enough to get the blender going<br>  <br>  ** I also added a banana, fresh pineapple, and a tad of honey , flax seed, wheat germ.  Honest, you COULD NOT taste the spinach, but it looked funny!<br>  <br>  How to Make It:<br>  Combine ingredients and blend.<br>  This smoothie will be a lovely green color but tastes very creamy and sweet<br>  thanks to the coconut milk and pineapple juice. You can use frozen pineapple but<br>  will need to add a bit more water.|`|cEuuj70Eaa	Actually that does sound good for you, I would not add extra sugar, and maybe add something with a bit more fibre or protein like wheat germ (grape nuts) or make oatmeal/porridge.  I found when my pregnancy started moving forward I had to eat things that stick in the gut a bit more.  Porridge is very good for you.  Carrots, salmon and even peanut butter are good sources of different vitamins and minerals.  Orange juice and even bread should be included in your diet.  You need to eat foods high in folic acid and calcium for your sake.  <br>  Congrats and good luck!! Blissy<3|`|b8f0CfSsaa	Thats really good! Bananas are a way of incorporating magnesium in to your diet without going overboard, calcium is great and you are getting two of your five a day!<br>  <br>  If you start to find that what you are eating isn't enough throw in some porridge! Its a slow burner and when I had morning sickness it was one of the few things that wouldn't make me feel ill!|`|xubIaiZaaa	ooh that sounds yummy, you can have everything in moderation :) exept for of course undercooked meat, deli meat, soft cheese and some seafoods... <br>  <br>  congrats!
200416208f6ad103a9e8e22b4202c849aa	I think the real problem is he is continuing to call you honey or sweetie even when you stated you don't like it and are uncomfortable. <br>  <br>  I known sometimes people develop habits but a person in his position (martial arts coach), can learn quick to not call someone other by their name.<br>  <br>  Does he call others by these names? If so, do they respond the same way you do?<br>  <br>  What I would do is address it when he calls you it again, in front of people.<br>  <br>  "I am sorry but we had this talk numerous of times. My name is ____. Not honey. Not sweetie or any other disrespectful name. My name is ____ and that is what you will call me by". <br>  <br>  Sometimes I had to call out people in front of others to get their attention of how upset I am that they refuse to listen and respect me. <br>  <br>  I had a teacher do that to me once. He is a nice guy. But that was the only flaw he had was to call everyone "babes, honey, Darline". In his position, he should only call his students by first or last name. Myself and a guy (a guy friend of mine) called him out on it. My guy friend was given the nick name "billy the kid" because he is related to him. He took easily offense because that labeled him as a "bad kid" in reality, he was a straight A person never in trouble.<br>  <br>  If that doesn't work, I recommend telling your parents and his supervisor (I imagine he is employeed or is he the boss?), that you are uncomfortable and he won't listen.|`|eGNMkdJBaa	gross, it's totally normal and i'd hate it too. in fact, I'm a cashier so older people use it all the time. Actually one time someone who looked younger then me called me like hunny and i wanted to flip out. It's just stupid and I don't even like guys calling me it.|`|Hm7MtmYPaa	Eew.<br>  I would not like that either.<br>  Freaking pedophile.<br>  Ughh...|`|d5c7ca66e3aab5e96442c48cd1fde13aaa	Yes, the words convey some intimacy, maybe he should not use it so liberally with u. He knows your name...<br>  Does he talk in the same tune to other students, girls and boys ?<br>  If not, he does really need some straightening up and maybe a lesson in vocabulary and social conversation.|`|nzyOCsOiaa	yeah, makes me feel like no one knows my name and is just trying to cover it up.<br>  Tell him straight up.|`|IQfaj1BGaa	maybe he likes you<br>  <br>  tell your dad. i bet you he'll stop then|`|EsRuOno1aa	Maybe you should have your parents talk to him. He might take you more seriously, because he'll realize that it is a problem, since you felt the need to talk to your parents about it. I think he's an *** if hes continuing to do it after you asked him to stop. I feel that hes lacking respect for you and for your feeling.

WW4veUJSaa	She had a c-section so I highly doubt her vagina is wrecked.

Its not every day a woman who has had a total of 14 kids is offered a million dollar porn deal. Also, Out of curiousity i'd wanna see how wrecked that vagina of hers is. Thats honesty.|`|WZQKevt8aa	Thats a bit cruel calling her babies 'a litter'. Its not their fault their mother is so selfish and deranged. I hope they end getting the proper care they deserve. I have no problem with calling her an animal, but leave her babies alone.|`|oMVSKGKbaa	I would tell her "it's a vagina not a clown car!"|`|AA10108216	Better you then me honey!|`|3yd2rsnoaa	If you ask me, and you kinda did lol, I'd send her a card.  But I'd want to explain to her that she needs to be more considerate of her actions and the consequences they bring upon her and  her family not to mention those innocent children.  If it was her dream to be a mother I can sympathize with her as I have been ttc for 5 years with not an ounce of luck and the pain that causes is excrutiating.  She is very very lucky to have had such success with the IVF treatments working the first time every time and that is a miracle to someone who's only waking moments are spent wondering if God will bless her with a child.  On the other hand she has greed in her heart and mind and no common sense in either as well to think about what she was doing.  Why would she go back for more after being blessed with 6 miracles the first two times?  I may be wrong but I've not even heard that she was unable to get pregnant naturally so that's a little inconsiderate for her to be so impatient in not waiting to meet someone who could provide for her and a family before doing something so desperate that should be solely for women who stand no normal chance.  Again I could have missed that announcement though not sure.  I obviously have a lot of opinions about this woman and right now just feel like expressing them you don't have to read it all if you don't want to it's okay with me it just gets it out of my mind and off of my chest.  The fact that she lives with her parents makes it seem to me that they are her "partners" in this endeavor and she should have consulted with them before going through with all of this since the burden lies with them as well with it being their house and finances that support them all in the same way she would have turned to her "partner" being a husband or of that nature any other way.  I can feel sympathy for her in wanting a big family to care for and to give all of her love to and share her life with but she did go a bit overboard with what was reasonable to handle.  I also feel like maybe she wasn't clear on the consequences of her actions and what exactly it is that could have come out of implanting so many embryos.  I've heard her on interviews mention that she was going with the odds against all of them taking and was shooting for there only being one to two more to come.  Then comes the question of selective reduction if the embryos did all take.  Being a woman who's only wish in life is to be a mother I'm not sure I could ever make that decision either and if I was in her shoes I probably would have done the same thing and said no way this is a life inside of me that deserves a chance to live even though I may have taken a huge risk who am I to punish this child for my foolish behavior.  I do agree with the fact that she may be a bit on the mentally unstable side but there is no evidence or supporting doctors reports to repute that so who are we to make that call on her behalf.  Sometimes people just have one track minds and they can only think of what it is that they want the outcome to be and see nothing else possible but that.  This woman should not be shunned as she is being but helped not so much financially for her personal gain but mentally to strengthen her mind in a way to know that she can now understand what she may have done differently and to help her make future decisions that aren't so debilitating to herself and others.  I also agree with the fact that her children being referred to as a "litter" is way out of line.  She didn't ask for 8 children out of this and if she did know the risks but stood by the statistics then that was just in her mind and we are not the ones to judge her.  Our opinions can be expressed but it is wrong to bash this woman for having no control over aspects of her life that mistakes were made in and by that I DO NOT mean the children because no child is a mistake there is always someone out there that would be happy to have one in their home to love that can't have one of their own.  I pray for the children that they are safe and that they develop properly with no problems in life that are debilitating to them and I pray for the other six children she already had that they continue to get the love and support they need and that not a one of the 14 suffer from neglect or malnurishment or anything of that nature due to lack of ability to provide for the vast number with so little support.  I think it wrong that the tax payers must now be held responsible for raising her children when she knew in advance that she had no financial means to care for them or room to keep them safe and sanitary but if my tax money has to go somewhere I can live with the fact that knowing that it is being used to give a future and proper care to children that had no voice in what happened and no choice in what went on and that had no options to say I don't want to be a part of this and you're making a wrong choice mommy.  No matter what our opinions are of this woman and the|`|Ao0G4EUqaa	Congratulations.. Your life is a freakshow|`|lmPII858aa	8 is enough

If its a pregnancy test, you are pregnant...even if its really faint.<br>  <br>  Its really hard to say if you are pregant or are these symptoms before you are getting your period.  good luck|`|3e754bd08c6bfe4f4516011f1ed5ea81aa	It's hard to predict, it's best to wait 5 to 10 more days before you do your PT. Good luck!
J3x9wpDIaa	Yes of course, it depends on your hormone levels. Some women can't tell until later, it just depends. But congrats!!!|`|ocp0WZpcaa	follow your insticts! most women know they're pregnant before they even take the test! you feel different. i've never been pregnant so I don't know what it feels like, but all of my friends that have had kids say they knew within about a week! Girls know their body!|`|AA12057070	what was the answer was u girl!|`|AA10151221	More then likely you are.  I would be worried if it came out negative because there is a higher rate of false negatives then positives.  If I were you I would call your OBGYN and make an appt.  Congrats new mommy to be!|`|f5yIF5CFaa	Umm yes you can.  We found out when we were only 2 weeks and there wasnt even a baby on the ultrasound yet.  You are pregnant! Congrats and get a good doctor :o)|`|qQ6On3taaa	Did you read the little packet that comes in the box? It will tell you exactly what you need to know, that's why they put it in there.<br>  <br>  If you threw it out already, then yes, you are pregnant. The test detects a hormone in your body that exists for no other reason.|`|0rsJvohpaa	yes most definately. u knt have false positives.|`|b9taoSbwaa	Yes!! Usually a positive hpt is correct...Looking at your dates it was perfect timing to get pregnant...You are most likley pregnant...You should go to your doctors or a walk in clinic to have a urine test done to ease your mind and know for sure...Good luck|`|jiOWRlJeaa	yes!! congrats!! course i am two weeks late also and have symptoms and all 5 hpts came back neg so i have to go to the doctor today and do blood test!! so your very lucky the first one was positive!!! good luck to you, and your baby that is on the way!!
JxAK30bjaa	To work out how long your cycle is you count  the first day of your period as day 1. If you start late in the afternoon or at night then you start day 1 on the next day.<br>  <br>  Eg My period started on The 1st April and my next period started on the 29th April therefor I have a 28day cycle. Around day 14 is when women typically ovulate.|`|8b7f8e496ede0dcde287f7fa3adf10c8aa	it usually 10to 14 days after your period
EXzuLzY0aa	Yes this is normal.  Each woman is different when it comes to your menstrual cycles.  Some women's periods last anywhere from 3-7days.  If you feel you might be pregnant, buy a Home pregnancy test.  If you test positive, schedule an appointment with your OB/GYN and have them draw a blood test.  These results will be more accurate as to telling you if you are pregnant or not, and if positive will be able to tell you how far along you are.  I hope I have been helpful in your search for an answer and I wish you the best of luck!|`|gyQUUkKwaa	if it was a light period then yes you could be pregnant. if it is not normal for you to only go 3 days then yes. you need to take a test. good luck.|`|cf60728a145c5cebd75177083d6b6f8eaa	Probably not. Maybe a weird period though, it won't hurt to take the test to make sure.|`|AA11597642	Most likely your not.   Not being mean ,but your just cycling wierd.  But hey take the test and see anyway because even with protection its still possible.

veO1RXrCaa	I had the same thing happen.  But here I am a few weeks after my original due date about to go into full labour.  It happens maybe you were mistaken.  I swore I wasn't either and my scan showed me that I was a month off too.  The baby is now 38 weeks done and healthy as anything.  I even got threatened with the big baby statement.  My first was almost 8 pounds.|`|6hb04Ow0aa	Well, when my sister was pregnant with her first he was only 3lbs! That was unusual in our family too- the smallest of all of us was double that: 6lbs. She did have a complication with her placenta though- that was detected later in the pregnancy. She gave birth three weeks early and her son is now an average sized four year old. If I were you, I'd get a second opinion just in case, though your baby might start growing faster later in the pregnancy.|`|vygYFdsSaa	That's extremely strange... as far as I know first time mums don't tend to measure a month small. You might get some further consultation to see if everything is OK with your little one. (Literally, LOL).Perhaps there is some kind of a misunderstanding but it is important to get it checked out in case (god forbid) the baby has some kind of developmental problem. Best wishes sending out positive thoughts for you xx|`|jhBRNvIxaa	....and.... If you took the pregnancy test in november then you probably had noticed your missed period. You probably conceived in October. Your doc is probably right... Ultrasound machines are 1-2 weeks off.... not 4... oh and BTW You should hope that you are wrong because a baby that measures 4 weeks under your date is BAD!

Kl1h5dCaaa	I had W & T September 05. They were born full term (ok 3 days early) no major complications, and were joys to raise.<br>  We decided to have another baby 2 years later. R & C were born exactly 2.5 years later.<br>  Yep, twins again.<br>  <br>  My whole pregnancy and labour with R & C, was a disaster. I was sick, bed ridden or in hospital. They were born premature, and spend a bit of time in the hospital.<br>  R & C turn 1yo on the 15th, and we are all finally settling into a routine. It's been a real challenge (we also took Guardianship of our Godson -5yo - so that's 5 under 5).<br>  For us, our biggest problems have been the health risks, C has had a real tough start to life, but I think we are starting to see the light. I also was punished by my body after the second set was born. It has taken a lot to get it all back healthy, and honestly I am still struggling.<br>  <br>  I know of 2 other people, one being my SIL who have 2 sets of twins. I am not sure how common it is, but it certainly likes us. We have Identical boys, both times, and all the other *double* multiple pregnancies I've seen are fraternal.<br>  It was all natural conception here.|`|Aj99vuqYaa	The people my sister nanny's kids for have twin 2 year olds (one boy and one girl) who will turn 3 in August I believe... and have a baby girl that will be 1 in October.<br>  <br>  I say whenever you're prepared to have another child (emotionally, physically and financially) go for it! =)|`|AA11887900	A friend of mine had identical twins, then had a "singleton" two years later. She also had another set of identical twins 4.5 years after the singleton. They are 18, 16 and 11 now.
YUq2kwxJaa	I had mine at 34 and he stayed in for 12 days just to gain enough weight. He was 4 pounds when he was born... they released him at about 4 pounds 11 ounces..|`|kaqPSgTVaa	I had my baby at exactly 36 weeks and she was in the NICU for a week but that was due to her not wanting to eat, nothing else.|`|AA10526033	my first 2 were at 35 wks. my first was in nicu due to breathing problems related to a cleft nothing else and that was 8 days. my 2nd didnt even go to nicu as she was perfectly healthy. she was in the hospital for 2 days because i had strep b but otherwise was fine. my oldest weighed 5lbs 10oz and my 2nd was 5lbs 3 ozs and gained weight while in the hospital so the only problem was my oldests cleft.|`|AA10949869	I was in the hospital the other day being monitored for toxeamia and there was a baby girl that was born at 35 weeks. She had a bit of a hard time breathing but was completely healthy and pretty stable and was only going to be monitored in the NICU for 2 days.|`|hAuemuWTaa	I had a friend that had a baby that was born at 34 weeks and was fine depends on the baby. Just need a little asstence in breathing wen first came out. for a couple of days.|`|cHROCt3Aaa	i had my daughter at 36 weeks and we stayed for two nights.|`|tNWOz2HWaa	i had my baby on her 28 weeks, we thought she wont make it. but she did. she's so hyperactive though she was so tiny back then, the same size of an 8 oz coke, hehehe... she stayed in nicu about a month and  a week.|`|Fx77zYhWaa	Usually not very long if at all.  It's only 2 weeks from being full term.  It all depends on the baby but if it does need to go to NICU it would probably only be for a week or 2.|`|Z5mi15yHaa	i had a baby at 35th week, she is fine and didnt stay in NICU even for a day|`|hLk7tJlWaa	depends in how complicated was the pregnancy it is different for each individual
jYPeis3Saa	i honestly don't measure out my sons food. <br>  he gets breakfast lunch and dinner with milk at all of those meals. he also gets snacks.<br>  <br>  hes 16 months and weighs 25lbs, so clearly im doing something right.|`|846b3af290613f2b0cdb0b7edc68ce91aa	I never measured the food either.  Mine ate 5-8 times a day, and still do.  They always eat more when they are about to have a growth spurt.  Just feed healthy foods for snacks, no sweets until dessert.  Mine have never been fat, and actually are under the curve for their age, even though they eat all day practically.  If your babie's a little pudgy, though, I wouldn't worry.  Your Dr. will tell you when he/she has getting too big.  They usually fatten a little during certain stages, then they shoot up and all of a sudden their clothes don't fit. <br>  <br>  Just watch him/her and if you are really concerned, call your dr's office and talk to call nurse.  They can answer most questions you might have.  <br>  <br>  Hope it helps...just enjoy your baby!|`|zPYyGw8oaa	all babies are different but typically.....3 "finger food meals" ( your food mashed and small) along with about 15 oz milk/water and healthy snacks.
OQFd3pl5aa	It actually is considered a sign. Many women have said they experience a metallic taste in their mouth during pregnancy. However, I am not sure of how soon it occurs with pregnancy. Lots of women do describe it to taste like blood (blood does have a metallic taste due to iron) and others say it tastes like they have been sucking on a penny. Others have also said it tastes like rust, or like what rust smells like. Good luck on Monday!!! Sending you lots of luck and baby dust :)|`|4b7808b550192ac7ad93353a410ef2e4aa	well to me it kinda tasted like blood like if you bit your self or somethin gbut i dont know really maybe its different for everyone
l0edsGtcaa	Yes you are! Congrats!!! If the blodd test shows even one percent than it is because the hormone is there, and the only reason the hormone would be there is because there is a baby on the way!! So try another hpt in a few days and it should be a positive. Congrats again!|`|kaqPSgTVaa	If you had a reading of 22 then yes. Non pregnant women have levels that high.|`|4mWGjgefaa	hi  ... my problem is also same... my period should come on 28th feb but i didnt get.. usually my periods are very regular... now im in my 35th day i took hcg test and the result is negative... im not feeling any differences like vomitting, sleepy etc etc.. im feel as usual.. when is the right time or day for urine test.. please help me
FctjUdU5aa	Awww.  Sorry about your conundrum, babe!<br>  But congrats on your decision, and on wanting to be a responsible mama and  girlfriend. Sounds like you're already on a good path.<br>  <br>  You definitely need a solid support network, and it seems like a good idea to go home.  As far as him,  it appears he's at least making some efforts to collaborate.  I'd hope he sticks with his new fam....  Seems like he's in a tough spot, too, though -- in a new, strange country, needing work, needing a support group also, and already a daddy.  I guess it's really up to him whether or not to come to TN.  Either way, you deserve his moral and financial support.<br>  <br>  My thoughts...<br>  He can brave it and join you.  You could do a little research first, and see what's in the job field for him.  Maybe, maybe there is a Hebrew community there, and you can seek it out with him.  <br>  <br>  He can work in LA (or wherever he needs to live), and come visit as often as possible, and provide financial support.<br>  <br>  He can live in TN, and work remotely.  Programming and computer work make that easy.<br>  <br>  You two can make a goal to move back to LA, or maybe live in a bigger city again in the future.<br>  <br>  That's all I got!  I'm sure other mamas out there have good advice, and maybe there are some support groups.  I really hope things work out wonderfully for you.  Keep talking to people, and hopefully things will come together.  :)<br>  <br>  PS - The restaurant sounds great!  TN could use some good middle-eastern food.<br>  <br>  Very best to you!|`|szjpsPdXaa	If he comes back..........and wants you and the baby.......no matter where you live, he will make the situation work!|`|0a35bd8efe64caf91fcf1e0cf5d79e07aa	The first thing he should do is take English lessons. If he was going to open a restaurant in LA, surely he can open one in TN, and probably with a lot less initial investment.|`|u53ISZoXaa	Maybe find a job working on computers, or something also related to not interacting with the public.  We had a guy work at taco bell and he spoke very broken english but he was funny as hell and we all liked him.  He could work at a fast food place and work in the back possibly.  Also if someone gets really good at it, he could start an ebay business from home.  My friend makes $2,000 a month from selling things on ebay.  Just a few suggestions, congratz and good luck
TyfDN523aa	No you don't need a parent and yes you can be under 18. contact your local health dept. and they will give you more info , and they can't tell anyone not even your parents.|`|CmSpH1ANaa	Definitely. Planned Parethood can usually help too. Kids don't have to live under their parents old fashioned values. :)|`|DMsjoZwSaa	Depends on what state you're from...In CA a law just passed stating that for a minor to get an abortion a parent must be notified. Prior to this law a parent was not needed....|`|Fx77zYhWaa	Depends on what state you live in.  Some states requires a person has parental consent some don't.|`|r5VFLa84aa	You can get an abortion when ever you like dear|`|NbkYGaNlaa	i think the #1 rule for all teens should be "keep the zipper up" <br>  and we wouldn't have this problem|`|9UYl8ErFaa	at any age practically
DM2M5LK4aa	Well, you don't have to explain it in a way that attributes it to sex.  Just explain to him that an erection can happen in any certain type of comfortable situation.  For example, they seem to occur more frequently when wearing clothes that allow more freedom for a male's private parts to move around.  The more movement on that part of the body, the more chance for stimulation.  Explain this to him, and possibly get him some underwear such as boxer briefs that are tighter and more secure in this area.|`|Ff7mCzlPaa	I think you could consider telling the child that sometimes his penis will fill with blood which comes from his body or if they have to pee -- and that it's normal for all boys....<br>  <br>  hmm an ice pack?<br>  <br>  if you think this is a problem, you could always talk to the pediatrician (in PRIVATE) about it, but i really don't think it's abnormal, unless he is obsessed with this.|`|AA10949447	tell him it means he has to go use the bathroom.and it usually goes down after he goes.|`|WgwevcPMaa	Haha, tell him in a way he could understand:)|`|oMVSKGKbaa	Ice pack? Seriously!<br>  <br>  Tell him it is something boys and men get from time to time and it will go away in a few moments. You could also recommend he go to the restroom point it down and try to urinate.  Men can not urinate through a full erection, and sometimes it is caused by bladder pressure on the prostate. <br>  <br>  There are several children's books that address this in an age specific way. Visit the local book store and do some investigation or look on line.

It's written in plain English, with age appropriate illustrations and language.  It explains everything, without going into graphic details.  Have a look at it and see what you think, most libraries have a few copies.   But I've never heard of a kid this age having quite so many problems in this area, maybe you should speak to a paediatrician, there may be a simple physiological reason for it.|`|AA10943329	at that age an erection happens due to a full bladder.

382b69da7c50fc8ccf68048ab522a879aa	I have heard of women putting sperm in a medication syrine and squirting that up there, so yes. If it was around the time of ovulation I guess there would be a chance of pregnancy. Very odd method, though!|`|Uy8ntukjaa	Probably about the same chance as getting pregnant from pre ejaculate fluid.|`|OiFNZnwOaa	eewww, well of course there would be a chance, as there is anytime sperm gets near the vagina, but not a very big chance and it would depend on if she did it straight away or a bit later. if straight away the sperm would still be alive, if later they would prob be dead.|`|vygYFdsSaa	If she was intending to impregnate herself, probably very high chance (if she was smart enough to pick a condom without spermicide, that is). If you're trying to impregnate yourself without having intercourse might as well go the turkey baster route LOL|`|JvbvGtrBaa	you might as well just say your on birth control.....and not be.....just lie if she wants to get prego that bad but the guy will be pissed and it won't work out with him most likely|`|9UYl8ErFaa	idk i wonder now|`|2NdSyZMBaa	it's possible. you can get pregnant if the sperm is introduced to vaginal secretion. condoms are not a 100 % safe. no form of birth control is. but getting pregnant all depends on the women's cervical mucus. because the sperm can live in the mucus up to 7 days if the women is or is close to ovulating. <br>  <br>  <br>  life finds away.|`|WRubYVzyaa	chances are very very HIGH.|`|oRaYQNXxaa	First of all where do you get a condom "full" of sperm. Not from one person thats for sure. <br>  Most condoms have spermicides on them, which kills sperm so I am gonna call this myth-BUSTED!|`|NTJwVcWuaa	if the sperm is recent it is very possible. if it is a couple of days old, then no|`|NvbTnLrBaa	I believe that you can get pregnant. but there might me a very mad guy out there that thought he was being safe about sex.|`|KIZVWREHaa	ummm i don't know but whoever does this has mental issues .|`|hLk7tJlWaa	i believed that is 65% that u can concieve a firest
ICrM6Nytaa	Everyone's body is different.  So yes you could have gotten pregnant in the days leading up to your period.  Some ladies have gotten pregnant while ON their period. I would wait another couple weeks and try testing again.  If the test still comes up negative and your period is still a no show, I'd go to the doctor.  They can test you for pregnancy, and they may even be able to give you something to help regulate your period.|`|o503YPrqaa	Some tests take longer to tell if you are pregnant.

2bf0afb576f3b1843272a3d582d8496eaa	Well, it really sounds like he is constipated in spite of what you think. If he is having difficulty it would be considered constipation since it means having difficulty with bowel movements.  It comes from lack of fiber and lack of moisture in the stool.  A good idea would be to to give your baby a few ounces of water during the day, in addition to his regular diet.  If that doesn't help, try adding more fruit juice like apple or grape.  There are some doctors that do not recommend Karo syrup for infants because it can cause diarrhea and dehydration because it draws fluid from the system.  If it doesn't correct within a week, you should contact the doctor and ask for advice.  But adding more fluids should help relieve the strain.|`|6AvVVzsnaa	Buy some Karo dark corn syrup and mix a teaspoon if it into the formula. It helps a lot.|`|4Bgw5xs8aa	Are you sure he's not constipated? Is his stool hard?<br>  <br>  The best thing you can do is when he's having a bm, hold his legs up close to his tummy. It helps him to "push" <br>  <br>  Also, at this young of an age, call his doc. I did and mine told me to give my baby some apple juice every day cause her formula was causing constipation (which is common with soy formula)...So the juice helps "soften" the stool. But definitely call the doc with a baby so young.|`|846b3af290613f2b0cdb0b7edc68ce91aa	My dr told me to give pear juice/water.  It works wonders.  1/8 juice with water in whatever size bottle you feed with.  In a couple of hours, he should have a pretty normal stool. Give the juice about 30 min-1hour before feeding time, and it should help with after-eating poo.  My baby was very bad about constipation.   It was the only thing that worked on her.  Even suppositories didn't work well.  It's natural and won't cause dependence problems later, like stimulants and suppositories can.  <br>  <br>  Hope it helps and good luck.  The other moms I suggested this to have had success, so it worth a try.|`|rkSBHqtQaa	Are you breastfeeding or formula feeding?<br>  He may be constipated. I went through this with my first and it turned out to be the formula. Apparently the iorn in the formula was making him strain. I was told to ise prunes and it worked for me. But check with your pediatrician first and good luck to your little one on the pooping thing.|`|dTPg4uYzaa	if you give your baby formula talk to your doctor about changing it alot of formulas are not good for some kids or maybe talk to dr about stool softeners|`|lmPII858aa	I had the EXACT same problem with my daughter. Her doctor suggested changing her diet by starting with the little things. For example, if you are breast feeding, start mixing half breast milk and half formula. If you are formula feeding, switch him to the sensitive formula. You can also try switching from powder to liquid, or visa versa, or sometimes even switching brands can help. If it only happens occasionally, try giving him 4 oz. of water with 1 teaspoon of brown sugar mixed in. That should help to loosen him up!<br>  Good Luck!
l1STgPyRaa	i would say that the chances of you being pregnant is very slim almost like 0.01% most likely it is the pills and now that your stressed that will also effect you too <br>  <br>  if your concerned then maybe go and see what the doctor can see.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|eow59EaEaa	It's most likely stress, and the morning after pill pumps you with tons of hormones to prevent the pregnancy which probably messed up your cycle.

You can always go to a doctor to get a blood test, because that would tell you for sure. And stress can also delay a period from happening, just like it can affect a guy and his ability to acheive or maintain an erection. It happened to my boyfriend with his ex; she had a late period and was getting sick a lot, and it was just stress.|`|fYxVwjhPaa	Sometimes the pill can fail, but being that you took it soon after the sex chances of that aren't likely. The pill can really mess up your system so that is probably the reason why you haven't got your period yet. But even though the tests turned out negative, it might be too soon to take tests and it be accurate. Wait a bit and don't stress about it. Your period should come soon. Maybe try taking a test in a few weeks if "Aunt Flo" still haven't arrived...|`|OI3bf4yjaa	There is a slight chance that you are pregnant, but if you took Plan B it's very unlikely. Plan B usually causes irregular periods, it usually takes about a month after taking it for your periods to become regular again.

I know that adoption is extremely expensive as well, but if you go through the foster care system it can be free for you to adopt or a minimum cost.

O3EtP4vOaa	The main problem with getting pregnant w/ PCOS is that you do not ovulate or you have poor quality eggs.  If you are having regular cycles then chances are you will be able to get pregnant naturally.  While miscarrying sucks it is a good sign that you are both working.  If you have PCOS one of the reasons you miscarried maybe due to this.  Your body may not be creating enough progesterone to sustain the pregnancy.  If you do become pregnant again get to your doctor right away and have them begin testing your progesterone.  If you are going to a doctor that is not fmailiar w/ treating PCOS you may have a hard time getting them to do this so make sure you have a doctor lined up ahead of time that will work with you.<br>  <br>  Godo luck.|`|3yd2rsnoaa	First of all I'd like you to know that it is nice to have some support when going through something like this.  Family and friends can be good moral support but the best thing I have found is to talk, share and have someone to just listen to you that has been through or is going through what you are going through.  It helps to know that you are not alone and also gives more insight into things you might not have heard of, tried or been opened to before.  That being said if you'd ever like to talk I'd be more than happy to be your support as well as you being a bit of support for me.  You can reach me at mbrmorran either through messenger or yahoo email and I'd be glad to help or just to listen.  This may be a long answer for you so I hope you don't mind but it's not often I find someone to share what I know or am going through with someone who is in the same boat as me.  I suspected myself of having PCOS for a few years before I got an accurate diagnosis even after seeing a few different doctors that told me oh that's normal no big deal ha were they way off huh.  Having no medical insurance also makes it hard.  So I finally got enough saved up for a visit to a fertility specialist and he told me that I did indeed have PCOS and recommended fertility shots and hormone therapy and such but I just couldn't afford it so like you I have been unmedicated throughout my ordeal with this.  I have been ttc for 6 years with absolutely no luck what so ever.  Having PCOS makes it very difficult to get pregnant and also puts your risk of miscarriage at a very high percentile.  Have you actually been diagnosed or are you basing it off of symptoms that match exactly with your research because that was me for years I just knew that's what I had and why I hadn't had my dream of becoming pregnant and being a mother.  A bit of relief and sadness at once came with the actual diagnosis though.  I have to say you are very lucky to have never missed a period at all having PCOS.  When I had my first suspicions I started my period and it continued for 6 months straight and never stopped not once.  It was terrible I was in the ER needing fluids a few different times from loss of blood and shock going along with the blood loss.  Even then there was no diagnosis just an it's an abnormality that will go away which brought anger into my emotional rollercoaster.  It happened to me twice I started in October and bled clear through until May then it would stop and I would have no period or only one or two until November of that same year and it continued the second time until the end of June.  I knew something wasn't right but couldn't get anywhere.  They will tell you that taking birth control can help you to regulate periods and possibly enduce ovulation when you stop taking them.  See that's the thing with PCOS you may or may not ovulate even if you are having a period.  Apparently there are times you do ovulate if you got pregnant once.  I am so sorry to hear about your loss I don't know exactly the pain but I can imagine it close to not getting a period one month being all excited and then seeing that negative on the stick.  To me that feels like losing a child all the same it's just a crushing blow and I would spend hours even days crying asking why me why do I not deserve to have a child?  I began to take prenatal vitamins daily as a supplement which I got free from my local clinic and for whatever reason I started to have a regular cycle.  It was a bit unusual as it was 39 days rather than the usual 28 days but none the less I knew a timeframe when my period was coming and it was always right on time to the day and I got excited thinking that meant I had to be ovulating.  There's no way to know if you're ovulating though which is disappointing.  You can get those ovulation prediction kits which I tried twice and what I found was that no matter what time of month I took the ovulation test it said I was ovulating.  What I found out about that was that with the PCOS there is a difference in our hormone levels than with a regular woman which can cause those ovulation tests to be wrong a lot.  That is disheartening all over again.  I have heard and read about women getting pregnant  with PCOS and carrying full term to have healthy babies and dreams come true but it is truly a miracle if that happens without the hormone therapy.  If you have a regular cycle the best thing to do is to chart your peak fertility days and the length of your cycle.  I found an amazing site I'd like to share with you it's <a href="http://www.mymonthlycycles.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mymonthlycycles.com/</a> and it will tell you the length of your cycle and your fertile, most fertile and the day you ovulate so you know the exact time you need to be doing the deed to try again to hit the lotto.  My husband and I had quit trying for a while and last month we had an enjoyable evening and before bed that night I was marking off the day in my planner and noticed that on that exact day was my day of ovulation.  With PCOS g|`|wK4kqhHkaa	I have PCOS and i didn't have any problems getting pregnant actually it happened when i wasn't even trying.  I never had any problems during my pregnancy either- i felt awesome.  PCOS  has a variety of symptoms and you don't have to have all of them. For example you might have regular periods but have other symptoms.  For me the only symptoms i had were very irregular periods and bad skin. I had my GP tell me i didn't have PCOS but when i went to see my ob gyn she said that i in fact did. <br>  Wishing you lots of Luck
c60d629a9c752c61dbe6a0c1f82dda78aa	Get some Papaya Enzyme! (found in supplement aisle)<br>  <br>  It's inexpensive and not harmful to baby :)<br>  <br>  I just had my baby a few days ago, but papaya enzyme was my savior during pregnancy!|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Have you tried sitting up in a reclined positiion? Other than what you have done I can't really think of what else you can do besides that.|`|Y9qhkO1faa	Milk will only give you temporary relief. It contains protein that breaks down very quickly stimulating more acid production. Try eating a few dry crackers, like Saltines, to absorb some of the acid. You should also try to sleep propped up. The baby is so big now he (or she) is pushing up so far on your stomach that lying flat just causes reflux. I'm 31 weeks with baby #4, and I definitely feel your pain! Good luck...|`|IjOEpqgOaa	Oh no honey! Milk.. just makes it go away for a sec. thats all. after that milk will make it worse!!<br>  <br>  <br>  Try tsp of Baking soda in a glass of water!<br>  Or chewing gum (winter fresh) anything MENT, Menty gum helps the heartburn.<br>  <br>  But Baking soda water-- its works just like if youre taking heartburn med! -- Its a true fact that it works! Yes.. its a little nasty. But it helps a lot!<br>  <br>  Remember the gum too!<br>  <br>  Congrats & good luck|`|qzY6TuQmaa	i was going to say drink milk but u already did that. old wives tale if u have alot of heartburn while pregnant ur baby will have alot of hair if no heartburn none or not alot of hair just thought u might like to know that|`|1U7yLEf9aa	Rollaids.

FoXMTx6Baa	Congratulations on your pregnancy =)<br>  <br>  He sounds like a complete prat.<br>  <br>  3kgs in 5 months is perfect.<br>  <br>  I would honestly implore you to get a new doctor. You don't need an unsupportive doctor when your pregnant. Find someone who makes you feel comfortable and is worried just as much about your mental well being, as he is about your physical well being.|`|O3EtP4vOaa	Tell him to kiss off!...lol<br>  <br>  Just eat healthly and watch the sugar and carbs.  My sister is due in may and she was super skinny before she found out she was pregnant and dieted like crazy.  When she found out she was pregnant she took it as her chance to eat all the chocolate in Mr. Wonka's factory and now she has gestational diabetes.  So remember to eat healthy, but do not "diet" watch the sugar and you will be fine.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|dAgtW3G0aa	The only weight you need to lose is 200LB of Doctor!  Hun, I'm overweight with a high BMI that puts my pregnancy at "High risk" level and even I was told that now is not the time to worry about my weight.  And no, 3kgs in 5 months is definitely not too much, get a new doctor because yours sounds like an idiot.|`|18c2b3da260806ed371f90555af6f88eaa	I think your Doctor is mad,you may be conselte other doctor.|`|D2IpUCueaa	i think doctors will only say that if that is absoloutely necessary but i would say you shouldn't be dieting when your pregnant but just eat healthy food i'm sure everything will be fine.|`|7DpmGblgaa	OMG i cant believe any doctor would say that to a pregnant woman- definately sounds like you should get another doctor!! <br>  Good luck x|`|GkPSvPhsaa	your dr is an A**. pregnant women should put on at least 15-to 25 pounds|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Sounds like you need a new doctor. NO doctor would EVER tell a pregnant woman to LOSE weight. That is NOT safe. Get a new doctor.|`|aTk0A9SHaa	Please do not let this doctors words get to you, I have always been a very small framed person my sister is too. I don't think i have ever been over 7 stone before pregnancy i have had all sorts of tests done which have all come back clear. In my 2 previous pregnancies i had doctors and midwifes going on at me constantly about my lack of weight and perhaps being unable to carry my children and if so they would be small babies needless to say i had 2 very healthy babies both at good weights also being heavier then the babies of friends and family who are a lot bigger framed then me. Now being pregnant again im going through the same thing with doctors going on about my lack of weight only this time i wont be biting my tongue at the end of the day i know i eat a good amount of food and my baby is the right size for how far gone i am so i don't see the issue, If you are eating healthy and your baby is fine then just disregard these comments it seems as though these days you do actually have to be perfect being overweight is bad being underweight is bad we all need to be the perfect size im just wondering what that is exactly

ZYlr9TSBaa	Ohhh hun! You need a big hug *hugs* - I felt like that for the first 4 weeks of Lilly's life =/ I felt guilty cos I hadn't bonded with her, I didn't love her as my daughter - it was horrible. You shouldn't let the trolls get you down - they're just that, TROLLs - sad little insignificant pr!cks who are probably 13 year old girls doing a dare at a sleepover. They are mindless pathetic individuals and the bottom line is - you are a FANTASTIC mummy! And Caleb is gorgeous (going by your avatar) - so please don't let them ruin anything for you. You're right, it's just your AF making you feel like this - I don't know what the time is where you are but perhaps in the morning/later on in the day you could treat yourself to something nice? Make yourself a nice meal, buy a nice top - something to give you a little boost :o) hope you feel better soon hun xxx|`|GqsLNUE8aa	I'm at a loss for words which rarely happens but my heart hurts for you LOL<br>  <br>  The wedding will go fine. The trolls will die. Your son will respect you for working so hard for him. This time shall pass...that's all I got :)|`|1CryEnb3aa	Awww!  I remember after my first was born, I didn't go back to work till she was 7 mo old.  It killed me!  She would pull herself up tothe door and I could see her crying her little eyes out when I drove away.  I hated leaving her at the sitters.  It eventually got better for her.  For me, the guilt was still there.I worked full time too.  So, just try to concentrate on the time you do have with him and make it special.  He will grow fast.  Enjoy every second.  BTW- that baby I was talking about turns 15 this Tues!  Now, I am crying about that!!LOL  It will get easier.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	fortunately i am staying hom now but i started to work at a daycare in OCT. My son wasn't in the same room as me. But my first day i went on my lunch break, called my sister and cried my eyes out. You'll get use to it but i certainly know how you feel. I worked before the daycare at a vet i had been working at for 3 years and my step-mom watched my son while i worked from 7-11 that didn't bother me that much since he was with ehr and it was the first part of the day and i didn't miss much- he slept most of that timie. but my first week at the daycare i was so sad-|`|lGcpXteaaa	Aww hun! *hugs*<br>  I really feel for you :( Do not feel bad for going out to work to provide for your son! It will not ever effect him, so dont feel guilty! <br>  Your a great mum i know, so dont listen to the **** that some people say on here....you know what i mean!<br>  Guilt is the worst feeling a mother can have, even though your not doing anything wrong you still have this underlying horrible feeling that your somehow gunna ruin there life or something crazy. You dont really see the upside until your out of that state of mind.<br>  <br>  <br>  You wanna hear my problems? <br>  Here goes...in the bar i go to, there is a guy that immediately caught my attention, he was quite handsome i must say....well if you remember one of my Q's i kissed that guy on a drunked night out, and felt extremeley guilty about it. <br>  Well considering i am missing my partner (havent seen him in 2 months, due to his job) i just want him to come home....<br>  BUT...the 'other guy' recently contacted me! I cant stop thinking about him, (i feel like its one of those stupid highschool crushes) and i have done everything to avoid him for obvious reason....<br>  Its still playing on my mind because i do indeed love my partner and i am very faithful....<br>  Then just today my partner said 'it might not work'....but then laughed and said he loves winding me up......what a joke eh??<br>  I feel embarrased, confused and like a bad mother. I dont know whether its my hormones, depression??? god....<br>  <br>  Now you have heard my blah problems...i hope its occupied you for 2 minutes and made you feel a little better :)|`|HiXZsAYAaa	I know the feeling. I was in school with my first daughter and immediately after school I started working. So I didn't get to spend nearly as much time as I would have liked to with her. I still to this day feel very guilty about it because I have a very difficult time remembering just 4 years back when my baby was a baby. I remember little things and I remember doing things but I don't actually remember what she looked like without the help of pictures. <br>  <br>  Now since my new baby has been born, I feel even MORE guilty towards my first daughter. She sometimes feels neglected, and even though I try to do things with her by ourselves, I can't seem to make up for all the time I HAVE to spend with my 9 week old. I yell a lot at my 4 year old for doing things she's not supposed to do, and it breaks her little heart because I never yell at my newborn (obviously). I just feel awful sometimes. My 4 year old helps me so much around the house and with taking care of her baby sister, and then the first time she screws up even a little, mommy rips her head off.<br>  <br>  I feel like crying just thinking about it. See I guess my guilt derives from the fact that when my first daughter was born, I had NEVER even HELD a baby. More less changed diapers or made bottles or fed one. So everything was new to me. I would get frustrated so easily. I had ZERO patience and since she never slept, I never slept, which made me even angrier. Don't get me wrong, I loved, love and will always love my daughter, but there were times when I'd just have to leave her crying so I could go outside and scream as loud as possible. I would get soooo mad at her! She was just a baby and I'd yell at her sometimes. <br>  <br>  That still haunts me. With my 9 week old, I get frustrated, but I don't vent my anger like I used to. Of course, I have her dad here. We're still together and he helps me out tremendously. I swear he should get father of the year. I am incredibly impressed with how willing he is to take her off my hands. <br>  <br>  Now, if you're still reading, I have a very good suggestion for you on how to make money without having to leave your child. So email me or message me on YIM and I will tell you what I do. I make quite a bit of money doing this and I'm able to stay at home with my daughters and devote tons of time to them.<br>  <br>  Let me know if you want my suggestion.|`|kSZx9cY5aa	Oh hun I know how you feel. It has been a really crap two weeks for my family.<br>  I just read your other question-I cannot believe what that b*tch said to you! That is just cruel and unnecessary. Try not to take it to heart, I don't know you at all, but you seem like a pretty great mommy from what I have read :)<br>  <br>  I'm so sorry you had a bad day. I know it's impossible to not feel guilty (i'm the queen of guilt) but i'll tell you not to feel that way anyway! Did you return to work because you needed to? If so, don't feel bad, when my maternity leave is over I am most likely going back to work because I want to! I know it sounds horrible but it's really hard for me to stay in the house all day, i'm the kinda person that needs to get up, get out and go to work! I feel awful about it, but I know if I was unhappy staying home 7 days a week, there is no way that unhappiness would not trickle down to my children.<br>  <br>  Have you tried going and taking a long bath? It might help with your pms symptoms and stress :)<br>  <br>  I feel that way a LOT. As I said the last two weeks have just been plain awful, with too much drama, and now 3 of us are getting sick. Yuck. It's almost 4.30 am and my youngest finally dropped off to sleep, but even though i'm exhausted I feel too icky to sleep.<br>  <br>  Congratulations on the baby and upcoming wedding though! How exciting! I'm happy for you :)<br>  I know how stressful it gets, so if you ever need to chat, or vent, ot b*tch or anything else, feel free to email anytime :)<br>  Feel better!|`|ANHsv4ENaa	I'm so sorry, hun. If it helps any just know that your sweet little baby won't hold it against you. He just knows that he's happy when you are with him and give him loves. I know there is so much to plan with a wedding and it seems overwhelming once it gets down to the wire. My best friend was still compiling her music the morning of the wedding! Lol. Remember it's your day and you can do no wrong. You will be beautiful and perfect and happy. I'm sending you many reassuring hugs! ;)
qzY6TuQmaa	if u look young that's prolly part of it. most older old fashion ppl see the world today and think that young parents or teen moms r bad parents that's y i always get upset when i see teen parent dropping there kids off at there parent place so they can go have fun. i was a teen parent and i have work hard to take care of my son! and they r making me look bad!|`|oJhr79cgaa	Thats just messed up. She's lucky she didnt say that to me! I'd go off. thats just wrong and very rude. i wouldnt worry about it. Its your business what you spend on you and your child. And everyonce in a while you deserve something expensive because you spend so much on your kids you never really get to buy anything nice. Thats just wrong! My son always comes first but if i happen to have enough extra money to buy me something nice im gonna buy it cause it makes me feel good and me feeling good is good for my baby.|`|GmQosBg9aa	I am not a mother just but I know my mum feels that way too.<br>  You are not selfish. You have created a baby and you will try your hardest to look after it. This may sounds really corny but other mothers are jealous, because they don't have that sort of comfort and are probably struggling with their own problems. All the hard work in bringing up a kid, I don't understand how you could be called jealous.|`|AA11330115	Did you tell her to mind her own business? Nosy old bag. Don't worry about it.

So what a littlebover $25.00 out of pocket?

After all, she loves her company now we are all grown up :)<br>  So i go out once a week to the bar with my friends...i dont get wasted..just a a few drinks and somebody had the cheek to say i should be home with my baby instead of being out with friends....<br>  <br>  Well...who said your social life ends once you become a mother?? My daughter is more than looked after, and is nobody elses concern!!<br>  They would NOT have said that if i didnt look young! I'm 18 for christ sake let it go!!<br>  <br>  <br>  I see somebody else here say they hate teens that go out.....what about older women??? What the hell is the difference??
2zC1lpfVaa	Don't worry, there is nothing to be nervous about.  You will be fine.  Probably will do some routine exams on you also, since this is the first time you are going to the gyne, like PAPs smell, ultrasound, breast check, etc... And no need to be embarrassed either.  We are all the same once naked (just in different shapes)|`|a184CVO9aa	Leave your dignity outside the door when you go in, then pick it up on your way out. Good luck.|`|AA11630994	I went to mine 3 weeks ago...i walked out nearly in tears. <br>  The questions werent so bad, it was the lack of interest. I asked him i was going to try, he said well then go home and get busy. I said yeah but dont i have to take folic acid, and he said oh yeah take those too.<br>  <br>  <br>  Basically, he made me feel really petty. I do hope yours goes ok, and you walk out with a smile.
O3EtP4vOaa	First just be a supportive friend, that will really help her.  I have had 7 MC and the advice I would give her is find another doctor.  There is no reason they should be telling her to wait a few months if she is ready now.  She should go to a fertility doctor not a regular ob/gyn, they say they are specialist and high risk but I have found they do not do much for you except say "wait and see", maybe suggest a reproductive endocrinologist, they seem to have the most info.|`|be8738c7b3a936fc2e865b3f0e6ad7d4aa	I had a miscarriage in June and it was really rough.<br>  <br>  I got pregnant again in December and started bleeding at 9 weeks and immeadiately thought it was happening again. I have been bleeding off and on ever since and I am now almost 15 weeks. I am a MESS all the time. Its very scary.<br>  <br>  If it were my friend, I would make sure she knows she can talk about the miscarriages with you (even if she talks about it all the time) and that you are there for her no matter what.<br>  <br>  I don't know what tests she has had done but here are a few she should get if she hasn't had them yet.<br>  <br>  -She needs to be checked for clotting issues. Sometimes miscarriages are caused by blood clots so blood thinners are needed during pregnancy to ensure the baby's bloodflow is not interrupted. <br>  <br>  -She should have her thyroid checked because problems with the thyroid can cause miscarriages. The thyroid is vital to the body's metabolism and also regulates many functions.<br>  <br>  -My sister in law has unknown antibodies in her blood and miscarried several babies before they figured out what the problem was.<br>  <br>  -Her progesterone needs to be tested early on in pregnancy to make sure it isn't low. If it is low it can be supplemented.<br>  <br>  Thats all I can think of :)|`|eemmWU0Haa	I've had 7 miscarriages and I think Im like corbin's mommy's sister in law im going for testing next week- Good luck!|`|VMASMHX6aa	I've had 2 miscarriages and I've been told by 2 consultants that the chances are it's just been bad luck and that there is no reason to think I won't have a successful pregnancy.<br>  The chances of having a successful pregnancy even if you've had 2 miscarriages are still very high and the chances are that she's just been unlucky too and that she will have a baby!|`|9RQmsrviaa	no ladies iam young blonde men can give the best advice <br>  know do my feriend  dont give up and keep going to ur husband and keep traying untill u have not yet the three months pregencey.dont give up in between and keep on going and trying and after four or five u would have prengancey
ckxpknr0aa	I think you obviously have very good taste - all classic and classy names....<br>  <br>  My favourites from your list would be Amelie Charlotte and Jacob Lucas.... if you wanted to mix them up a bit I think Olivia Rose and Theo Jacob/Lucas also sound really lovely.<br>  <br>  Congratulations on picking some good, traditional, normal names - makes a nice change!!!|`|CScarqBZaa	Hi i really like your kids name especially Oliver Finn its really cute and out of the names i like Amelie Charlotte and Ada Olivia on't like Rosa Evelyn and i reallly like the name Amelia and from the boys i like Jocob Lucas and Theo Seth... hope this helps =)|`|iMaTMWMxaa	I think your choice of names is really lovely. And your 2 children have gorgeous names too.<br>  <br>  My favourites out of those listed are:<br>  <br>  Amelie Charlotte and Oscar Reuben|`|vdPS8dQxaa	Rosa Evelyn or Jacob Lucas ^^|`|JvBGKmpyaa	I like all the girls names, but preference for Amelie Charlotte. Maybe the two A endings in Ada Olivia is a bit of a mouthful?<br>  <br>  Boys mostly good but don't like Reuban. Preference for Theo Lucas, Max Lucas or Lucas Max.|`|uscHnFPtaa	to be honest I dont think the name Oscar Reuben is a very good name.. the kid will probably be made fun of.. no offence really. but all the other names are cute .. maybe you'll like a couple of these..<br>  <br>  Serenity <br>  <br>  Kylah<br>  <br>  Vera/Kira<br>   <br>  Joey<br>  <br>  Max<br>  <br>  Taytum<br>  <br>  Ansleigh<br>  <br>  Aiden|`|dGEkdfjTaa	rosa evelyn, it's beautiful. few more suggestions:<br>  -jocelyn kate<br>  -naomi erin<br>  <br>  personally i like jacob lucas best. or you might want to go with<br>  -milton chris<br>  -isaac jake|`|bm8Ano1Naa	for me??<br>  <br>  hmm..<br>  <br>  if it is a girl i think amelie charlotte and if it is a boy jacob lucas|`|rmO8GIcvaa	Amelie is very cute..|`|U3prt8tlaa	I don't like the names you have picked but Oliver Finn sounds like a musician's name.|`|2716717868fe21f32f85869cd02f81d8aa	I really like the names Olivia, Amelia, Max and Theo
60YOy0rHaa	My wife just had a baby, and during her pregnancy she loved body pillows. She had three actually.They're wonderful.Definitely give one a try. They're not expensive and you can find them just about anywhere too. Without a body pillow you can simply line up a bunch of pillows. hah. Or basically cuddle with an extra comforter, It'll actually be very similar to a body pillow. Also, I always spooned with my woman. That really helped her out she said, but maybe she was lying because she loves me. Oh well!<br>  <br>  I hope this helped!<br>  <br>  Email me if you have any more questions!<br>  <br>  Branden|`|hPDO5wR8aa	All I can say is: BODY PILLOW! BODY PILLOW! BODY PILLOW!<br>  <br>  It is a pillow the length of your body, it has done wonders for me cos this pregnancy my back has been really sore. You can lean your belly and put your leg up on it and cuddle it - soooo comfy :)|`|J9QUjetqaa	I had a body pillow when I was preggo and that really helped a lot. But what would have helped more and what I am definitely getting before next baby, is a little foam wedge. They have them at babies r us but you can probably get one cheaper at a craft store or something. They are perfect for holding that heavy belly up so you can sleep comfortably. That probably doesnt help much now unless you want to run to 24 hour wal-mart tonight lol<br>  try putting a small pillow (couch or travel pillow) under the bottom half of your belly and one in between your legs. I know how awfully hard it is to sleep that late in pregnancy, i had a real hard time. I would get up and sleep leaned over to one side in my reclining chair sometimes, that helped a lot. or propping myself up in an almost sitting position amidst a bunch of pillows. if you watch tv or read in that same position for a while, eventually you'll just be able to lean your head over and pass out. good luck xoxox|`|cO9sxO9raa	Were in the same boat. I'm usually up until 2 am before I can fall asleep just due to being too tiered to feel uncomfortable, or for an hour at least before the bathroom calls for an hourly visit during the night. =) You should try putting pillows under your tummy and back and in between your legs it helps a little. Good luck and hope you can rest =)|`|leHQQX4paa	i sleep on my back and i sure couldnt do that pregnant. so i would put 2 pillows under my belly then one between my legs . then i just went out a bought one of the really long pillows and slept with it|`|0DtWgXxUaa	Lay on your back then just let your body move into the first position it instinctively decides to move to.<br>  then stay, and stick it out. imagine yourself falling asleep.
1CryEnb3aa	I am just like Tyler's mom.  I work 3rd.  Since I have been on 3rd I pretty much shop on line.  Mostly to pass the time.  But, since Jan I have been on here instead.  Its cheaper!LOL  I love craigslist.  My husband says I am addicted.  I don't usually buy, just love to look at what people have to sell.  Anyway- have fun shopping online!!!|`|TlFnIei0aa	Me 2, I always look at th baby clothes and toys on ebay, even though I hardly ever buy anything.|`|10b2b615c8f0ca19d750e607674a3c6daa	I work nights and when we're slow and i'm done with all my stuff I go to wal mart, target, and craigslist looking at everything. Even like house ware type stuff. It passes time.
Gb6fHGTDaa	if you cant get to ER, hold your arms ALL THE WAY above your head, lay on the bed on your back, make sure the baby is moving normally, if you cant breath, the baby cant breath. the baby is probably pushing against your lungs causing this, wait for the baby to change positions, or walk around, change sides a lot, do things that will make the baby re-situatee.|`|YWUVRrMMaa	Go to the ER if you cannot breath. Why can't you go out? It sounds like you need medical attention. Call a friend to take you.|`|Hm7MtmYPaa	You need to go to the ER if you really can't breathe.<br>  When you can't get oxygen, neither does your baby.|`|ftvxAS3saa	at 3:30am ii woke up to the worst stomach ache ever!!!!! omg i was in so much pain, i think it was something i ate.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	If you really can't breath go to the ER. That's not good.
dnG7fhnbaa	5 weeks,1 day and baby is due around 4th November.<br>  <br>  babycentre.co.uk is a good site for pregnancy and gaining info such as this!<br>  <br>  Congratulations and good luck! x|`|vygYFdsSaa	How far along you are is measured from your LMP -- Jan 28th. So you're currently 5 weeks, 1 day. Your baby is generally 2 weeks younger than this number because most women conceive about two weeks after their period. So, you can be 5 weeks while your baby is around 3 weeks. Congrats :D|`|JCWkXn8Aaa	about 6 weeks pregnant.|`|60YOy0rHaa	What day did you have sex? What day is it today? Subtract, add, multiply. It's simple.|`|M2h4qz6jaa	there are two ways doctors measure a pregnancy: first day of your last period (and you are 5w and 2d now) and the date of the ovulation (this is your baby "age" and it is 2w or 2w and 1d). Congratulation for your baby! I hope you know what miracle is that. Best wishes!!|`|kaqPSgTVaa	They go by the first day of your last period so you are about 5 weeks.|`|6AvVVzsnaa	Like 6 weeks.
vygYFdsSaa	Discharge is usually described as like "egg whites" when a woman is ovulating. So that's probably what it means.|`|XhJL7tnwaa	"Egg white" discharge is the most fertile type of cervical mucous. You are very fertile now and should take precautions against pregnancy if you don't want pregnancy or start with the baby-dancing if you are seeking to conceive.|`|EtUkys6Waa	You are most likely ovulating.  This is your most fertile time.  The drainage is least likely to act as a spermicide.|`|pBCkKpN2aa	<a href="http://answerall.wirelessroot.com" rel="nofollow">http://answerall.wirelessroot.com</a>  <br>  it<br>  A very informative website you can also get much information in websi|`|e20a45fd7b2a5384cb2b799947aaff89aa	thats just your natural lube. unless your a chicken hahaha just joking ?|`|0MUvGlHkaa	i would be more inclined to say your more than likely just ovulating|`|kaqPSgTVaa	That you are ovulating....|`|tivpa7Vlaa	mean u have a bit of discharge as long as its not stinky or itchy its cool. who knows what the pu$$y be carrying on with sometimes|`|wTIvLkJSaa	It sounds like a yeast infection.  Go get yourself checked out and whatever you do... don't spread that around.  Stay celibate til you know for sure what's wrong.|`|CrjozlCjaa	Sounds as though you have an infection.    See your doctor.|`|QV5E70e6aa	Visit a gynaecology  and have their opinion.She will guide what to do.|`|iNE2nl5taa	See a doctor.
WqVawp0Kaa	Jaqueline. It was my husbands beloved grandmothers name, she just passed away from cancer. and it's what im gonna name my little girl. I think the nickname Jackie is cute. Plus the hottest girl in my high schools name was Jaqueline!|`|IDmaxViIaa	I love Jacqueline i think it sounds so unique and pretty but i love the others a little as well.<br>  This is from my heart: I can tell by these girl names that you like that you have a beautiful and loving mind nothing sick about it. These girls names are names that most people would say are beautiful angel's names there beautiful. I love your girls’ names and how your loving mind came up with these lovely names. I think your names represent laughter and love! This is no Joke and don't think I’m a crazy person cause I’m not. Lola|`|IZ1nLtKOaa	I like Ashley but insted of being the way it's spelt.

And Ashley is just too common.|`|AA11391968	Jacqueline.  For one, it can be elegant, or playful.  It also has good nick names.  And it so lovely sounding.|`|RPc63EK2aa	i would prefer ASHLEY...<br>  its common but jacqueline/jaclyn are more common names...<br>  and i dont like names with LYN, i hate it...i hate my name too...it's with LYN at the end... ;-)|`|BiMeb75Gaa	Ashley because Jacqueline is kind of old fashioned now.|`|AgxtBVwoaa	JACQUELINE|`|CrjozlCjaa	Neither actually.

nwWBddEnaa	my daughter clip was off after a day, because she was small they put her on her belly between feeds, the midwife will probably take off the clip and clean it for you. i was feeding every hour but was meant to be every 2-3 hours or when ever they were hungary, my milk came in really quickly i was in-gored by day 2, i had a pretty hefty milk supply, it was running out of me. i wish you all the best x|`|YWUVRrMMaa	When my son was born it was like he was always on the boob. I fed him whenever he was hungry, every 2 hrs or so. So her being hungry every two hours is totally normal. I would try to clean her umbilical cord more though and ask your home nurse to help with that. It should hurt her to clean around her little umbillical cord stump. That is one question I asked my nurse. I asked tons of questions due to being a first time mom. It sounds like she is doing great keep up the good work!!!|`|lJ5Ao2aIaa	Cleaning the Umbilical clamp will sure hurt, its a sore place still, my baby used to cry when i clean this place. But cleaning it is absolutely necessary cause it gets infected quickly. Your collostrum will come out as soon as you give birth, it might stay till two days to a week then milk will start to come out. You need to feed every two hours or before if she demanded food earlier. How did the poo reach her umbilical clamp?? lol|`|gKeLV9HBaa	bath her that should clen it pretty good also congratulations|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Feed her every two hours when she is hungry at first. It will be every 3 hours pretty soon. You need to try to clean the cord some more. It can get infected.
vygYFdsSaa	Pretty sure they would send you home after they diagnosed a miscarriage unless you were experiencing a complication. Most women have to endure the miscarriage at home unless they get a d&c, although some women are forced to wait for the d&c even after a miscarriage is diagnosed|`|kaqPSgTVaa	They won't keep you in the hospital. They'll send you home and then have you go to get checked in a few days or a week.<br>  <br>  My sister had a miscarriage at 9 weeks with twins and they sent her home and let her miscarry there. She went back after 3 days to make sure that she was ok and the babies were fully ejected. They usually don't keep you at the hospital and they wouldn't that early.|`|EyKJ737daa	having never had one myself but have a few friends who have, they tend to keep you in maybe a night to make sure everything has been removed as sometimes a D&C is required if the body doesn't abort it all properly, they do an ultrasound to make sure first.  Otherwise if everything is clear, they often send you home same day.  I hope this hasn't happen to you sweetie.  All the best.|`|sYsfI856aa	IF they do a D&C then you will be out a few hours after that is done. If you choose to miscarry naturally you will just be home.  It's not a stay-over kinda thing. It's a out-patient thing basically. You get it done, recover in a room for awhile, then someone has to take you home. You'll get some pain meds and stuff and be required to rest, but after a D&C the bleeding trickles to a stop, and the pain pretty much goes away, not the emotional pain sadly... but knowing everything is out of there and that you are not risking infection makes you feel better.<br>  <br>  I've been through this twice.|`|vkhc8Co1aa	if you have a straightforward complete miscarriage there is no need to be in hospital.<br>  If you need assistance (medication/surgery) you are unlikely to be in more than one day.|`|qzY6TuQmaa	they send u home 4weeks isn't that far i don't think u will need a D&C|`|4b7808b550192ac7ad93353a410ef2e4aa	i think they send you home as soonest they test you that nothing went wrong my cousin miscarried at home went to the hospital and they send her home the sameday|`|1u4CS5J3aa	i miscarried at 10 weeks and went home right away
Y9qhkO1faa	I was going to go back when he was 6 weeks old.... I cried and couldn't do it... He's now 3 and I'm 31 weeks pregnant with baby #4 (we also have a 13 yr old and 11 yr old). My husband loves that I am happy as a stay at home mom, even if it isn't what we originally planned. I am truly blessed!|`|yz7CA6Ycaa	i went back when my baby was two because she was at a good age.

tTf1Zp5eaa	Hi<br>  <br>  We have the same problem but this last week I have been giving my son a bowl of porridge before bed and he has been sleeping all through the night! Dont know if its just a coincidence but worth a try!|`|48WkXo1Taa	don't let your baby sleep during the day. If he falls asleep in the day wake him up that way he would be tired and sleep during the night. I did that with my 5 month old baby.. If not i know that they sell sleeping pills  for baby's but before you buy them you should tell your doctor if its ok to give him to him|`|1CryEnb3aa	Sounds like he got out of his routine.  And the restlessness could be because he is still getting over his cold.  Just keep trying to get him back into his routine you had prior.  May take some work, but stay at it.  Holding him will only make it worse as  I am sure you know.  Good luck and hang in there.
0e0a0f1828f99f87ea3d5e5bc8cbd46daa	Yes it is. Being that he is a control freak just makes everything worse. He is acting worse than his son. How pathetic.|`|ea207ed5b6ef75b8f1362932a6abf174aa	This is great!  Although I am confused about him being grounded for a month, but not having anything still after 6 months, but still, kudos to Dad for actually caring and showing him that there are consequences to your actions.|`|145RUNQHaa	You got it right when you said control freak.says it all.|`|rNvXWMOMaa	he got oiff lightly, he should of gotten a spanking too.|`|PxawVQ7Xaa	That's bordering on abuse, you'd think he tried to kill someone. It sounds like his Dad has some anger and control issues most likely stemming from the his parents treated him.<br>  <br>  I don't really see anything wrong with going out, like you said he wasn't doing anything bad as in drugs alcohol or mugging people, quite frankly he should arrested for neglect, emotional abuse and false imprisonment, even serial killers and rapists don't have it that bad.|`|wi6mkT30aa	I think punishment as in grounding is nessicary many times. Yet taking it too far is just wrong. This sounds as if he goes a little too far even though somethings I do agree with.<br>  <br>  I think being protective is being a smart parent! Being over protective, strict, mean or hurtful punishments can just be wrong and push the child away. Not only that it makes them more into rebeling and wanting to go against their parents.|`|FTFd3AQAaa	well my parents tried a strict approach for my sister, not this bad but any infraction of the rules lead to a prolonged grounding and the result was she just stopped trying to follow the rules and did what she wanted... ummm she had her first kids within a week of turn 16... her second at 19... so easy to say my father's approach failed... basically if kids are over punished then they have no incentive to behave|`|wlSD6Ccgaa	it does seem a lot for just sneaking out but i think your missing some details like how is he to his dad? how old is he? what were his intentions for going out? is this the first time he has been disobedient?<br>  it's up to his dad how he is punished and most children with strict parent grow up to be good people.|`|rid4brOnaa	Yes, this does sound a little extreme. So........obviously you did not give us the whole story. There is more to this than just Matthew sneaking out of the house on a single night.<br>  <br>  What other things has Matthew done?

His father is setting rules.  <br>  <br>  when you have children, you'll understand.<br>  <br>  Plus I'm positive you are leaving out a lot of details!|`|SX9zoVEQaa	Is his dad Dr. Phil?  LOL  This is waaay too extreme.  Why doesn't his Dad just freeze him in a block of carbonite and thaw him out when he's 18? <br>  <br>  EVERY teen sneaks out of the house at least once.  What, did Matthew and his friends drop acid and rob a convenience store or something?  <br>  <br>  Tracking device?  Bernie Madoff has more freedom than this, and he stole billions of dollars from investors.<br>  <br>  I smell b.s., this can't be real...  I've known kids with strict parents, but not like this.|`|0v55bQT1aa	I sense that "dad" had already warned Matthew. However, if Matthew can't stand it, he can move out. If the dad took his car, it means he's an adult, whatcha think ??|`|qRElKKjXaa	That's insanely, inhumanely extreme. Even prisoners have a light bulb in their room, sheets and a blanket and clothes. <br>  <br>  He needs to tell somebody at school about this so they can intervene. He'd be better off living in juvie or getting emaciated than to live with a dad so unhinged.|`|5769f110474fd157a0d6c0b3ca8ac6d8aa	It does sound extreme, but there might be more to the story than you are telling us.  For example, did Matthew lie?  Was he rude and abusive?  Who was he hanging out with?  How many times has this happened before?<br>  As for those who say teenagers learn from their mistakes - that is stupid.  We try to lead you in the right way, knowing how disastrous mistakes can be.  It's no surprise to know that most murder victims are young men, and that drugs, sex, and violence are every parent's worst nightmare.<br>  As I said, it does sound extreme, but then we don't know the whole story and a chat to Matthew's father might be more telling.
2t4PRzEQaa	I think you should be able to talk to your parents. But, they really can't MAKE you do shitt. It's your life, not theirs, and remind them of that if you have to. I would also tell them that if they keep on taking your problems into their hands, then you can't talk to them anymore or tell them anything. You're simply looking for advice from them, correct? Not for them to take action. You should be able to talk to them without them doing something drastic.|`|4Um6yfhdaa	Yes, I agree.|`|IQbP2gmraa	i agree but i can tell my mom anything pretty muchh.<br>  im glad for that!|`|Bx7F9jscaa	I agree with you, but if a teen has a different adult they could talk it, it'd be even better.|`|kTMkP2mtaa	I agree--it was always easier for me to talk to my friends, than my parents. I think it's smart to tell a parent, because in the long run--they are very knowledgeable. And their opinion may just shock you!|`|fgRjL7MNaa	i can talk to my mom about anything at all.<br>  she wont call the persons parents unless they were in like real danger and she doesnt judge.<br>  my dad on the other hand, would be banging down my freinds door if i told him some of the things i told my mom lol|`|T0NvgQTUaa	i agree. i think it would be better if the teen had an adult they could talk to about it. still someone that would listen and give advice but not take over the situation.|`|yXUS7jz5aa	No if I was in that situation I wouldn't back down,the child needs to learn that you get punished if you do something wrong.|`|jJjoZ3zfaa	There comes a time where you must consult a parent due to superior experience. These days, the world is a ageist place where teens are considered trouble, mischievous, violent, little temperament, rebellious etc. all this has caused for adults to reject teens in belief they are out of control and also without responsibility. When it comes to something as serious as a unborn child then an adult must be informed to give support. When its something trivial as smoking that you can handle yourself then talking with other teens has its advantages, although this generation find it "cool". All in all I believe serious issues should be resolved by adults with greater knowledge, and trivial issues can be shared with others.

1CryEnb3aa	Yes caffeine is part of it and the fact that coffee dehydrates you.  So, you would need to really  pump up your water intake.  Good luck and hope you get your BFP!  Keeping my fingers crossed!|`|kaqPSgTVaa	The effects of caffiene in pregnancy are unkown. Most doctors will tell you it's safe to have about a cup of coffee or a soda a day and be ok. I drank a whole pot of coffee every day and got pregnant. It does not effect fertility. It's the caffiene that people worry about so you can drink decaf if you want. That's what I do cause I love the taste of coffee.|`|OyBuEpOTaa	If you read the label on the decaff coffee you'll see it has potassium , that always gave me an upset stomach. too much caffeine for the baby is bad. i saw a woman that lived on coffee and cigarettes. Her baby was born blu because of it being born with a heart disease. I think the baby may be born with a caffeine addiction. It is a stimulant. Baby might addicted, be really cranky and cry a lot. maybe you can cut back to 2 cups a day and put a lot of milk in it, so you'll actually be drinking less than 2 cups. <br>  <br>  I could never get pregnant until I helped my husband eat healthy and gave him Vit E. Make sure your husband is getting vitamins and not <br>  drinking alcohol or lots of caffeine. Good luck!|`|Bx7F9jscaa	I'd definitely say cut down. My cousin adopted a baby boy whose mother got him addicted to caffeine while he was in the womb and he was horrible behaved, couldn't sleep, and constantly screamed for the first year or two of his life. I'm not sure if it had to do with the coffee, but he also has social problems and such now. So I think it's better to be safe than sorry.|`|tivpa7Vlaa	drank coffee(starbucks) regularly b4 pregnancy and cut down to only a home made cup a day or when i needed a boost to get things done during the day and baby is fine, great, born on his due date(so he is full term) and weighed a healthy 7lbs 3oz. rumors has it that it causes low birth weight and pre mature baby and a whole lot of gossip. doctors advise that you should not indulge in other caffeinated drinks after you had you one cup a day. i did drink lots of water daily to keep hydrated though|`|pwu9xzF8aa	you can still drink coffee, just in moderation.  3-4 cups of coffee a day is recommended not to go over.  Caffeine can cause miscarriage in early pregnancy, although the reason behind it is not really known.|`|b8f0CfSsaa	It is the caffeine that stops the baby from developing! I loved coffee and tea, but I read online that one cup of green tea a day can enhance your chances of getting pregnant as it contains natural stimulants. It does contain 1/25 caffeine and the jury is out as to whether that will be detrimental, but there is a de-caf green tea option-which I am trying!<br>  <br>  You should be okay with de-caf coffee.|`|O3EtP4vOaa	The general rule is no more than one caffeinated drink a day, wether it be coffee or tea or coke.  You can have decaf but still remember do not over do it because there is decaf still has some caf in it.<br>  <br>  They say it can increase miscarriage and cause learning disabilities.|`|Lck9Fg04aa	like everyone has mentioned the caffene in coffee is high- it raises your energy levels then drops it again- (so to much is not good for you and baby)<br>  <br>  you can drink it in moderation though 2-3 cups a day- <br>  as well as fizzy coldrinks- drink them in moderation|`|1u4CS5J3aa	an 8oz cup of coffee is fine but dont drink more than that each day. It has to do with the caffeine and the dehydrating side effects of coffee. You should drink an extra glass of water per cup of coffee also to keep hydrated.|`|vdmqdlNfaa	caffeine free coffee is ok to have, stay away from high caffeine including coca cola.|`|n9hPQhbOaa	i always go to this site w/ questions<br>  so on coffee i asked the same thing too but i wen i was preg i drank a double chocolate chip frap from Starbucks all the time my baby boy came out perfect but don't drink to much i stopped drinking it if u just like the taste get decaf here is  a lil article iv found and read b4 it might b a lil long but hey reading is good i read all the time when i was preg learned a lot hope this helps<br>  <br>  --<br>  There's general agreement that pregnant women and those trying to conceive should avoid consuming large quantities of caffeine. But after decades of controversy and conflicting evidence, there's still no real consensus on how much caffeine is safe during pregnancy.<br>  <br>  The March of Dimes advises women to limit their caffeine intake to less than 200 mg per day. This recommendation was prompted by the results of a study published in the March 2008 issue of the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, showing that moms-to-be who consumed 200 mg or more of caffeine a day had double the risk of miscarriage compared to those who had no caffeine.<br>  <br>  Not all studies show a link between caffeine consumption and a higher risk of miscarriage. Still, it may be smart to err on the side of caution and stick to the March of Dimes recommendation. (See chart below to get a sense of the caffeine content of various types of coffee, tea, and other common sources of caffeine.) And, of course, if you decide to cut out caffeine altogether, you won't get any arguments from your doctor or midwife.<br>  Are there other possible risks besides miscarriage?<br>  <br>  Yes. Because caffeine can cause blood vessels to constrict, it may reduce blood flow to the placenta. And because it easily crosses the placenta and reaches your baby (who then very slowly metabolizes it), caffeine may directly affect his developing cells.<br>  <br>  A study in Denmark found that the risk of stillbirth more than doubled in women who drank a great deal of coffee per day — eight cups or more — compared with non-coffee drinkers. And some studies suggest that high levels of caffeine consumption by Mom may slightly reduce a baby's birth weight, but other research has shown no association.<br>  <br>  One study found a link between maternal caffeine consumption equal to three cups of coffee per day and an increased risk of having a son born with undescended testes. This happens when the testes don't move from the pelvis into the scrotum as they usually do in late pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Other research has shown that babies whose mothers consumed more than 500 mg of caffeine a day had faster heart rates and breathing rates and spent more time awake in the first few days after birth.<br>  <br>  One thing's for sure: You'll feel better if you cut back on caffeine. It's a stimulant, so it raises your heart rate and may raise your blood pressure slightly, too. Plus, it can make you feel jittery and cause insomnia. Caffeine can also contribute to heartburn (something you probably don't need help boosting!) by stimulating the secretion of stomach acid.<br>  <br>  These effects may be more pronounced or last longer than usual as you approach your due date, because your body breaks down caffeine more slowly as your pregnancy progresses. And that means a higher level of caffeine in your bloodstream and in your baby's.<br>  <br>  There's one more reason to cut back on coffee and tea during your pregnancy, whether it's caffeinated or not. These beverages contain compounds called phenols that make it harder for your body to absorb iron. This is particularly important because many pregnant women are already low on iron. If you drink coffee or tea, have it between meals so it'll have less of an effect on your iron absorption.<br>  <br>  Coffee is one, of course. The amount of caffeine in a cup of coffee varies widely, depending on the type of bean, the brewing method, and how strong it's brewed. And your serving size depends on the size of the coffee cup.<br>  <br>  To cut your caffeine intake, though, you'll need to be aware of other sources, like tea, soft drinks, "energy" drinks, chocolate, and coffee ice cream. Caffeine also shows up in herbal products and over-the-counter drugs, including some headache, cold, and allergy remedies.
AA12212215	I picked one spot when I had chicken pox, on my forehead too.<br>  <br>  Years later you CAN still see a very very vague mark, if you really look for it and know where it is.<br>  <br>  But I bet it depends on her skin - some people scar easier than others, some spots will be deeper than others... you'll just have to wait and see is my guess but I doubt she'll have any obvious marks.|`|z03coR1Oaa	everybody is different when it come to scaring its a bit like stretch marks some get them some don't. my daughter didn't pick her chicken pox as she was only 5 mths old but but she still got scars but my friends son picked his so much that he got an infection in the wounds and he didn't scar at all.|`|8soUaTijaa	Arnaca cream is also good for scars.  The severity of the scar will depend on  how big the spot was and how deep.|`|ifUB8Zziaa	hi when i had chicken pox i picked loads of them, i have no marks on my skin at all. I would say that as long as she does not pick at them too much.. by that i mean constant scratching all the time i don't think she will be scarred. my sister also picked hers and she is not scarred either. i think it also has a bit to do with the type of skin of the individual, i would use vit e enriched creams after they have gone as they help reduce scaring or bio oil as well|`|xubIaiZaaa	most probably yes. wait for them to completely heal, then if the scarring is noticable you can try rubbing pure vitamin E oil on them every day to help them fade|`|iMaTMWMxaa	Not always. I have no scars from when I had chicken pox, neither do my children, and the youngest really picked hers as she was only tiny.|`|Xu7dJQOEaa	unfortunately yeas, my daughter did the same a few years ago she had one right between the eyes and she picked it. it is only indented rather than scarred|`|b8f0CfSsaa	She should be okay. I did that too at her age and once the pox stopped being 'scabby' my mum rubbed Vitamin E oil in to my skin every morning and I only have one scar at the top of my left arm. It will probably take a few weeks for them to die down, but I doubt she will definitely be scarred! Most kids that have chicken pox pick and poke at them aftera  bit. <br>  <br>  If you haven't already tried this, put cammomile in her bath, it may alleviate the itching a little.<br>  <br>  I hope she gets better soon!|`|slpaE9Ukaa	unfortunately yes<br>  <br>  i was only 5 when i had them and picked one on the center of my head now i still have the scar and its very visable even 20+ years later so i'm sorry to say but it looks probable best thing to do when the poxs have gone cover her in bio oil on a daily basis and it should hopefull reduce the scaring as it worked on strech marks te reckon its good on scare tissue too hope it works|`|Q2aOmKvBaa	I'm afraid she will... sorry. It cant be helped with young children, its one o them things.
b8f0CfSsaa	Hey Chanelle :)<br>  <br>  <br>  I think the stress that is the most harmful in pregnancy is the stress that will bring on high blood pressure, i.e getting angry all the time.<br>  <br>  It sounds to me as though you are just really missing your bf, heartbroken and worried.. This won't bring on pre-term labour, I was in a similar situation as my fiance and I chose to live with our parents in order to save as much money as possible and that meant being apart from each other until a couple of months after the birth! I missed him a lot, but everything turned out for the best in the end.<br>  <br>  Don't worry yourself too much. Unless you are raising your blood pressure with this stress I doubt it will cause any harm to your baby....just think of all the hormone induced rages all pregnant women have!<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck with your pregnancy and I am really pleased that your BF has made such a turn around. Everyone can change and it sounds as though he has.<br>  <br>  x|`|eC1dQVcgaa	stop stressing, it isn't going to do you or the baby any good!! <br>  i i have read your profile and understand your situation, but you really need to stop stressing!!<br>  I don't know if this can cause early labor, but it sure can cause High Blood Pressure, read my profile and you'll see why i worry about HBP.<br>  Take care Hun, he'll be home some to see you and your baby. <br>  He wouldn't want you to stress out and worry yourself silly would he??? =[ x|`|QBFbvO21aa	Well first off stay calm for your baby.<br>  But when we are pregnant, we all have crazy hormones that makes us alot more vunerable to crying, stress, depression, food...etc.<br>  Its normal to be emotional, just dont put too much stress on your baby,it possibly can cause miscarrages and preterm labor in extreme cases. Choose a healthy pregnancy over this guy, please? I know it's hard..just hang in there for the innocent baby. <3|`|2jgiruBhaa	wHEN i was 20 weeks prego with my first child my boyfriend now my husband moved away to another state.I was so stressed and depressed.I know exactly how u feel.Stress is harmful for the baby.It can cause low birth wieght increase in premature labor and its harmful to u. But stress during pregnancy is common.Just make sure u do ur best to minimize your stress get a lot of rest and keep up with your prenatal vitamins.  Dont be scared.thats just more stress.Just make sure u dont let your emotions push your boyfreind away.since hes so far hes more volnorable to be pressured to drift away.feel me?But relax.It will all be worth it in the end when u c that little face for the first time!!!!|`|n9hPQhbOaa	i would try not to stress as hard as it might be u have to think about your baby do something else get you mind off it pick up a new activity work out go to the mall go out and do something and u should prob go to a group thing for pregos =D i bet it will make u feel better and to know ur not alone and get advise and help in dealing with stress i have lost a baby from stressing to much work and the boyfriend talk to people i didnt i just kept everything inside and freaked out and i lost my baby so just get ur mind off wat ever stress u out|`|3qI1oyFaaa	Try to hang in there. Stress can be a factor in pre-term labor, yes. But it's still not definitive what CAUSES pre-term labor, ever, in anyone. Only about 50% of the women with pre-term labor had the 'symptoms' they list that can cause it... So don't get more stressed thinking about that :)<br>  <br>  It's gotta be hard not having the baby's father there with you when you need him. But try to remember that out of any time in your life, this is the ONE time that you're definitely not alone--you have your little bubs inside you, depending on you for everything, and I'm sure loving you already... As much as you love her already. There's nothing that me or anyone else can say to make things better for you, all anyone can do is offer their support when you feel down. Try to stay busy--that should be fairly easy at a time like this... :) Go window shop for baby things, start planning where your daughter will sleep and what kind of routine you'll want her on, you can even start checking out pediatricians and stuff. Take a couple tours of a couple different hospitals. Read lots of books. Watch baby stories on TV. Pick up some stories from single mothers--to remind you that many women have done this COMPLETELY alone, and that although he's far away and you can't really see him how you'd like to, you're still blessed to have him there at all and happy about your child together...<br>  <br>  Keep your chin up, congrats, and good luck!!|`|m0DgqEcjaa	yes, you need to stay calm (or at least try to), all you have to keep thinking is that it isn't going to be like this forever!!|`|98WKYtfwaa	I didn't think that stress was that bad in pregnancy, but i found out it is. My friend was 30weeks pregnant and her waters broke and she went into labour and gave birth to her baby. Her baby survived and is doing very well, the cause was she was stressed out about her family threatning her and stuff. <br>  <br>  You should take measures not to be so stressed hun! x|`|EsGrIscFaa	I know it can be really hard when the one person you want is not able to be with you but you have to focus on the good things to keep yourself from going insane.<br>  Stress isn't good for you, pregnant or not. My family had some hard times early on in this pregnancy and whenever I got really stressed out I ended up bleeding and having to go to hospital so I do believe that it can have a detrimental effect on your baby.  Try to do things that you find relaxing and try doing something nice for your boyfriend like keeping a pregnancy diary that you can post him our weekly - like a news update 'To Daddy, Love Mommy and bump' or something - and include pictures of your growing belly and silly little things that he may feel he's missing out on, like 'I had a mad craving for coleslaw at 3 am' or 'I had to pee 5 times last night!'. It might seem like nothing to other people but it's special for him to be involved and in the same way it'll help you feel like he is more involved and you won't feel quite so lonely without him. x|`|dd2vz570aa	Stress can bring on Pre-term labour, I don't think its very likely but apparently it can.  You need to stop worrying bout things you can't do anything about and start thinking of that baby your carrying.  Your baby picks up on your moods and they will feel the same so if your always stressed and down your baby will be and that's not good. Your baby will cry lots when she is born.  You obviously knew before you got pregnant your boyfriend was going to be going prison or there was a slim chance he would go as court cases take months, some even years before sentencing, you chose to go through pregnancy alone.  You have to remember your boyfriend is in prison so you wont be able to speak to him, he wont be around to bond with your unborn baby and he isn't going to be there for you so stop stressing and depending on him, your a lucky girl having that baby so stop thinking of the him and feeling sorry for yourself and start concentrating on her.  Try and write him more letters and visit his family more, that may make you feel better.|`|e5a8ca9a40c842fd6f909812078000a7aa	Oh hunni.... I'm soo sorry!!<br>  <br>  I'm sure he wouldn't want you to stress out like this, just think only 8 weeks until May comes and then he might be there with you and your little princess!!<br>  <br>  Try keep your chin up and look forward to the times when you are all together 'a family'!!!! <br>  <br>  I think you need to book a day out maybe to a spa or just a salon that do all kinds of pregnancy treatments! Take you mum or your best mate with you and just relax..... After all, when your little girl is here you won't have as much time for all those luxuries!!!<br>  <br>  I think the stress affects babies more than we know! It either makes them anxious or it makes them quite!! I noticed when i got myself worked up the other day, mine didn't move about half as much as she normally does!! Try having a girly day or something!!<br>  <br>  If you need a chat..... You know where i am :)<br>  <br>  Your stronger than you think, and this will all be worthwhile in the end!! xxxxxx
eH58ELw5aa	If your eldest is only 9 months and you have more children planned, then I'd go with filling in the pool and grassing it over for now - you can always get a paddling pool for the summer months while they're small and that'll easily satisfy the children until they're around 5 years old.<br>  <br>  How big is your garden?  Could you, in the future, get another pool dug that is smaller and then you could have a small pool and a small amount of garden - best of both worlds!<br>  <br>  I think for me, safety is a big issue with pools and although it is nice to have a pool - for peace of mind, I would be happy to have a pool-less garden while my children were small.<br>  <br>  Children also enjoy gardening - so having a nice paddling pool for cooling off, but also having a garden for them to grub about in could be the way to go.|`|1KIwM1uOaa	We have the pool and we have a lawn.  In the summer the kids could care less about the yard they live in the pool and it is the hangout out for all their friends as well.<br>  <br>  My in laws also have the pool, they have the patio area around it and off in a corner they have a play house for the kids and a swing set, not a lot of room around it but it does give the smaller kids something else to do.<br>  <br>  Keep the pool.  As the kids get older they will enjoy it a lot more and so will you.  You can always go to the park to play or take them to the front yard.|`|wi6mkT30aa	I think both would be very much appreciated. Both swimming and lawn backyard area is fun to play in. I think swimming is great and exciting during the HOT summer months but I think lawn is great for fall,summer,spring and winter.<br>  <br>  I think the best way to do this is getting ride of the pool and make a nice big fun green lawn. Since your children will still be young for a while I would consider buying a small pool. They aren't that exprensive anymore atleast less than 300. They are just as fun as the huge one plus that way you can have the lawn for all year round and the small pool in the summer. <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck choosing hon!|`|1c489693c0ec148c877cdbe2ac5c89dcaa	I think that you should fill in the pool. Reason why is because my little cousin she was 17 months and she drowned in a pool. Because the mother was drunk and high and she left a 4 year old in charge of the baby. I mean I am not saying that will happened its just that it just freaks me out about people who have small children and they want or they have a pool. I have a big yard and my kids love it because we have a big tree and they have a tree house I mean the kids rather play in the tree house or in the back yard. We have plenty of shade.|`|6npsRIzUaa	Where I live, prioritys are as follows: big screen TV and a pool.<br>  <br>  My little brothers would pick a pool over having a lawn any day, your own pool is AWESOME, I'd keep yours, you can go to the park if you want grass, public pools are icky and you have to watch your kids around strangers AND you have to pay to get in, and you can't swim at any time of the day, gross.<br>  <br>  IMO, pool.|`|QBFbvO21aa	They have a house to run around in already, i mean only if the pool has a gate around it and you give the kids swimming lessons i'd suggest they would have more fun with that. But if none of those, yes get rid of the pool, sadley. It could save their lives, and they can have fun running in circles in a lawn as well :]|`|yXUS7jz5aa	Go with the grass the kids will thank you for it later.|`|iIU7PQHjaa	i have a 7 yr old and 2 yr old and i  know my kids would love a pool if they had one....|`|856df45cd220b8db7117dd899c6e5ae2aa	My kids wanted the pool.  We always had a big lawn, but since we put the pool out there, we can't keep them inside in the summer.  Mine are 20, 18, 14, 8, and 1.   Chances are you will still have sufficient room for them to play when not in the pool.  That would be my vote.  I would NEVER fill in a pool....lol.<br>  <br>  Kelly|`|TW4Xg7Kbaa	I don't have kids, but I was one once. I would say a lawn. You could use it throughout the whole year, and it gives you much more options on what to do with it.|`|rOMTKmjDaa	Both are sufficient, and I would have gladly had one or the other when I was a child. How about you pick what YOU want? Seriously, I doubt the kids will mind either way.|`|3FZ37RLraa	For young children, grassis MUCH safer.later on if you have the money youcould getths poolback, by hey what do I know, I'm just a 15 yroldkid. Email me your decision!!|`|f66ce5d864eadcad29348fd4a9871771aa	a pool can only be used 3 months out of the yar or so here.,,i dont  know where you are but im sure you cant use a pool year round, i would go with yard if it was  one choice or the other. and for the poster  whose baby cousin drowned, im sorry about the baby, but not all parents are druggy losers and dont watch their children. if a child is supervised they can still fall out of a rtee house and break an arm or a leg (or neck)...i dont think ever pool in the world needs filled because her mother decided it was a good idea to allow a 4  year old to watch her while she got high.<br>  <br>  <br>  we have a pool (gated, locked, all that) but we have a big yard too, i wouldnt have  one if i didnt have a yard for them to play in too, i think kids need to run and play. :-)|`|Iz5tNA5aaa	I think it would depend.  If you live in a warm climate (like Florida or Texas) the pool would be able to be used for longer periods of time.  If you live in colder climate (Wisconsin and the NE) the lawn would get more use since it's too cold for more than 1/2 the year to swim in the pool.<br>  <br>  Kids love to swim and run around, so I would base the decision on the time a pool could be used vs the amount of outdoor time available in the colder months.|`|5769f110474fd157a0d6c0b3ca8ac6d8aa	We had this same problem.  We went with the pool and a smaller garden.  We felt that our garden was so small, the children had more value from the pool.  Also, we back onto a park, so the kids could play there.  <br>  It depends on your weather.  Also, our garden was very sloping, so although we had to make an area for the pool, the kids wouldn't have been able to play games as such, anyway.<br>  It's a tough decision, take into account such young children, too, who would possibly be in trouble with the water.|`|n2O0NwR6aa	When your kids are a bit older, they'll definitely appreciate the pool.  We've never had one, but many of our kids' friends do - and that's where everyone wants to hang out.  My kids never invite friends over because there's "nothing to do here" - it's always the kids with pools who have the parties and sleepovers and friends hanging out after school.  That can be a plus or a minus, depending on how you look at it!  But I'd rather have my kids and their friends here at home, where I can keep an eye on them.  Of course, that's a ways off for you still... but if you're planning to stay in that house for a long time, I'd say keep the pool.  Your kids can enjoy playing at the park or a friends back yard while they're little.|`|26e007e4ed7e7d42044814b364794a0eaa	Couldn't you fit both?  Maybe make the pool a little smaller and the patio a little smaller and add some area for at least a swing set.  I have 4 kids and I have both.  In the fall, winter and spring, they love the yard.  In the summer, they are all about the pool.|`|Kl1h5dCaaa	I have 5 under 5yo.<br>  <br>  My Sons would rather grass to ride their bikes on, and play around with.<br>  You can play on grass no matter what, there is only a few months of the year where you can swim.<br>  I would say fill it in.
Coc593Ikaa	1. It is very, very rare. There are only a few thousand cases people getting sick from listeria per year in the us. That number includes all people who get it, not just pregnant ladies. If you get it the symptoms are flu-like and take 2-30 days to show up. So, no, you wouldn't necessarily know. BUT, if you think you have been infected, your doctor can test for it. It is easily treated with antibiotics.<br>  <br>  2. The food would have to come back in contact with listeria. Listeria is a bacteria, so it does not manifest out of nowhere.<br>  <br>  3. Um, why can't you have lettuce and tomato? I don't understand the basis for this question. I've not heard of vegetables being a concern, just certain meats and unpasteurized cheeses.<br>  <br>  4. Yes, it is fine.<br>  <br>  Ok, good general rules. If it is cooked it is fine. If it is pasteurized it is fine. The only things you really need to avoid when out are suspect cheeses (I avoid all cheeses mexican and soft italian {ricotta for example} and blue and feta) and deli meats (include hot dogs in that). Have a burger! Have a chicken sandwich! Remember, most "normal" cheese are fine: Muenster, provolone, american, cheddar, swiss, colby, monteray jack, mozzerella.<br>  <br>  ADD: Remember, that the astounding majority of the time, these foods that we are wary of do NOT have listeria in them. They are just foods that CAN have it. Just take precautions and don't worry any more about it. Yes, listeria can have dire consequences, but it is VERY unlikely that you will consume any. Just be smart and you have nothing to stress over.|`|xubIaiZaaa	1- it can take up to 6 weeks for you to show any symptoms<br>  2- eat your food while it is still hot, dont eat food that has cooled too much, or eat foods from bainmaries as they may not be kept at the right temperature or the food may have been sitting out too long<br>  3- salad should be fine as long as it looks fresh<br>  4- this is fine, as long as it is frozen straight after cooking, and when re-heated cooked really hot.|`|b2H8JWGBaa	Girl, you overthinkin' this. Just eat your food. And steam yo lunch meats.
tivpa7Vlaa	use the paper plates..y not. if the smell makes you sick then avoid doing the dishes until this feeling subsides and it will later in the pregnancy. there is nothing in dishwashing liquid soap that will affect the fetus/baby. strong cleaning products that clearly label not to use during pregnancy should be avoided. if there is anyone to help with house chores let them handle that for now. during my pregnancy i did the basic chores but i would not scrub the tub because u need to use strong cleaning products and it was hard on my back doing that scrubbing...|`|U5RObaBGaa	what a great excuse haha!! you could try paper plates if you can get them cheap enough depends on wesather you can afford to do that.|`|vygYFdsSaa	Doing dishes is certainly allowed LOL I understand your concern about that icky chemical smell. You should find a nice gentle-scented organic type dish soap to use, try to find one chem-free or with less chemicals. Good luck....I suppose paper plates could be a last resort. I just read that you are 12 weeks though so a lot of it has to do with morning sickness. Over the next month that should start to get better xx|`|EvXqkrvAaa	How far along are you? If you are in the first 12 weeks the feeling sick from the smell will probably go away once your into your second trimester. There is nothing wrong with using harmless chemicals like dish washing liquid its more the powerful bleaches and things you should wear gloves and a mask with. But you could wear a mask to wash the dishes if you like or try a new liquid....One with a different smell or no smell.|`|R1zUIh7taa	That could be a great excuse!  I got sick until 7-8 months!  So if it works, it works!  Yet, those cleaning products won't harm you or your baby!  Also you could buy Green cleaners if you are worried about the harmful chemicals, since they are good for the earth and everyone in it!  I hope you have a happy and healthy pregnancy!  Just think how much money you would be spending on paper plates and such!|`|mFQydvncaa	Its safe, avoid strong chemicals like bleach. Only use mild soaps, and if you are in the first 12 weeks thats why you feel sick, the smells will get you! just try paper plates until you make it to the 2nd it usually tapers off then!
79eRDIbXaa	I just want to say Well Done to you!<br>  Also maybe you should go back to America or England if thats where you are from just through your pregnancy as they will be able to help you better. I think you do need to be carful as you have worked so hard, and if you choose to stay there then when you start getting verry big you will simply just have to rest all the time. Like dont wait till your huge to get everything ready so it will be less work on your leg. Good Luck XXxX|`|5LzZYrQnaa	you should talk to your doctor and see what he/she has to say tell them your worried and what can be done congrats and good luck|`|SY8b17Ldaa	first of all im sorry u have had to endure so much pain i have not been through what you have but i did just have a baby so i will try to help you as much as possible as far as your injury affecting your pregnancy the only thinng that may cause you grief is the extra weight u will be carrying your mum is right to worry but i wouldnt worry to much you may find later in your pregnancy you may need a wheel chair i think i speak for most of us wen i say i wish we were given them in the end lol but on a serious note it may not be a bad idea to use one later on to save you from serious pain but u might find you dont need one good luck and i hope it all works out|`|jBdvUQEXaa	Firstly congratulations on your pregnancy! I hope that this one goes all the way :-)<br>  <br>  Secondly, you are an inspiration - you have overcome more than many people ever will!<br>  <br>  Thirdly, even the "fittest" most able bodied women become tired, uncomfortable and need to rest and sit more when they are pregnant! My best friend is a marathon runner and had SPD which is where the pubis causes incredible pain. She was in a wheel chair for a while. I have three kids and am pregnant again, I know that by the end of the pregnancy I can barely walk as it is so uncomfortable.<br>  <br>  But bear in mind that any inconvenience caused by the pregnancy will go once your baby is born, keep focussed on looking after yourself and your baby.<br>  <br>  Speak with your Dr about your concerns, and I would approach your midwife again, explain that it is causing you some distress. They should try to help as stress is never a good thing when you are pregnant. Take care, and I hope everything works out well!<br>  <br>  Claire|`|xQLdicFoaa	I think you will be fine...there are plently of moms to be that have had to be on bed rest almost their whole pregnancy!  It might be uncomfortable for you now and then but all you have to do is prop yourself up with pillows and relax :)  As long as you're going to the doctors and taking it easy you should be fine. I wouldnt worry about it....worrying causes stress and stress isn't good for the baby so just hang in there and take a deep breath!  It's amazing how far you've come!  Good luck and God bless you and your little one

sdEvcpKwaa	In many countries, including Australia, Canada, India, New Zealand, United Kingdom, Brazil and Croatia, a minor is presently defined as a person under the age of 18. (wikipedia) I believe this means that your parents are still responsible for you until you turn 18<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.thesource.gov.au/find/life/housing.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.thesource.gov.au/find/life/ho...</a> This would be a good site to look at.<br>  <br>  From what I can find, it looks like Australia is close to the same as the states. You can leave at 16 if you have somewhere to go. The problem is that you will still be considered a minor and it will be harder for you to make your own way. <br>  <br>  I think that your Grandma can still report you as a runaway at 15. If your home life is terrible, for whatever reason ( And I mean other than the regular stuff that every single other child across the globe has to deal with. Like too many rules and sh**) then you should call Australia's child services. They will inspect your living situation and have you removed if things are intolerable. But they will more than likely place you with fosters until you are a legal to move out.<br>  <br>  The grass, without fail, is ALWAYS greener on the other side. I promise it won't be long until you are off to college or your own place. I think it would be easier, wiser, and cheaper to stay with your Gma until you are done with high school. Just visit your friends and stay over there as often as you can.<br>  <br>  My experience: I moved out when I was 17 and wish I could go back and not do it. I messed up my life because I was no longer concentrating on school. Now I am 25 and still trying to scrape together for my degree. If I had just stayed home and concentrated on the important things, instead of trying to be more free and happier, I would be much farther in life now. <br>  <br>  Hardly anyone likes living at home when they are a teen. That is why they are known as the rebellious years. Everyone has the worst home life and it sucks royally. It will get better, and when you move out when you really have a place to go, you'll be much better off.|`|uAyYRXnvaa	Yes.

Unless you are really un happy and/or being mistreated. I think you should talk this over with a teacher or you friends parents. Perhaps if you just need to get away from your family for a while stay with your grandparents or friends but don't make it a permanent thing you are way to young to leave home. It is not all it is cracked up to be when you start out on your own.<br>  <br>  Also it would be better for you and your family if you waited till you where a bit older and could financially support yourself and that way your parents will be at more ease that you will be ok and they wont get on your back and do your head in because they are worrying about you and nagging at you.|`|ZHNnDu1Faa	What do you want to do at 15?<br>  Do you have a job?<br>  Do you think that your friends are going to support you for years ?<br>  Ya grandma's standing in your way, because she doesn't want you to have a bad life.

LVgBTcENaa	Poster above, you're wrong. Her name never was Morgan, it was Morgain. <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  From the Old Welsh masculine name Morcant, which is derived from Welsh mor (sea) or mawr (great), and can (bright, white) or cant (circle, completion).<br>  This name is common as a surname in both Wales and Ireland and is becoming increasingly popular as a given name.<br>  <br>  The use of Morgan as a female name comes from the confusion between several names. The Arthurian figure Morgan Le Fay was in fact never called Morgan but Morgain.<br>  Geoffrey of Monmouth, historical writer in the 12th century, used the name of "Morgen Le Fay" for his character of the legendary sorceress. Morgen is an Old Welsh male name, variant of the Old Irish Muirgen (now Muirín) probably meaning "sea-born".<br>  The French later used Morgain, which in turn was assimilated to Morgan.<br>  Morgan Le Fay is now the common English name of the Arthurian figure.<br>  <br>  There have also been attempts by some modern authors of fiction to link the Arthurian character Morgan le Fay with the Morrígan, the Irish goddess of war and death, derived from Irish Mhór Rioghain meaning "great queen"; thus wrongly relating the name Morgan to Morrigan.|`|4b72344a7ffdd832d2d96bc0a3362486aa	uhm.. i actually know more guy Morgans than i do girls....<br>  <br>  so in my head I automatically think its a boy name.<br>  <br>  and it's unisex because it's NOT just a girls name.<br>  <br>  and have you met a male Morgan that has been beaten up on the playground? because i sure haven't. in fact, i never saw any fights on the playground minus the little push and shoves when someone isn't sharing. most people are raised by parents who teach them manners and not to judge people by stuff like... their name..<br>  <br>  and i was going to apologize for what i'm going to say next, but you're more rude in your question than what i'm about to say.... you need to grow up and stop being judgmental.|`|ih2RV0pJaa	long before people starting naming girl's 'morgan' to seem cool or different, morgan was originally a boy's name.<br>  <br>  relax. if you wanna name your daughter morgan go ahead.<br>  <br>  i hope a boy named morgan comes and beats you up. just to prove that your statement is utterly ridiculous.|`|JvBGKmpyaa	Morgan was a boy's name LONG before people started giving it to girls to try to be a bit different.|`|i3LYGGEpaa	It's unisex because both genders use it!<br>  <br>  Morgan Freeman.<br>  <br>  <br>  I suppose you think my name isn't unisex too!|`|ibg67Xtvaa	morgan is actually a boys and girls name|`|1u4CS5J3aa	What about Morgan Freeman?

Check a baby name site.|`|UJaCObdyaa	I know 3 boys named Morgan and they have never been teased or beaten up at school.<br>  Morgan was a boys name long before it was used for girls and I think it is much better for a boy.<br>  I bet Morgan Freeman was never beaten up at school.|`|zbjaBgyEaa	Maybe it's where you live - I'm not really sure.<br>  <br>  Originally it was a guy's name.  Now it's more popular on girls but it's actually not that uncommon name for guys.<br>  <br>  I grew up knowing one Morgan of both sexes.  I think it's pretty androgenous to be quite honest.  The show Chuck (which I completely adore) has a male character named Morgan.  And that's not forgetting Morgan Freeman who is just plain EPIC.<br>  <br>  Man, I don't know where y'all go to school though.  My elementary school we had teachers.  And duty staff.  Fights were about as common as icy days in hell.  And really were more likely to get the **** kicked out of you for liking the Red Wings than having a funky name.|`|OHfZFR31aa	Morgan did not even appear in the Social Security database as a girls name until 1976. It became popular because of a soap opera actress called Morgan Fairchild (whose real name was Patsy Ann but changed it for professional reasons)<br>  <br>  It's been in the database as a mans name since 1880 when they started keeping Social Security records<br>  <br>  So basically it's a mans name, that has only recently been used as a girls name.|`|2716717868fe21f32f85869cd02f81d8aa	Morgan is a unisex name. You might not like it for a boy but some people do!|`|382b69da7c50fc8ccf68048ab522a879aa	There is an actor, Morgan Freeman. I dare say he never gets beat up for his name!<br>  <br>  It is unisex.|`|6xf1GfbUaa	When you look it up, it says everywhere that it's a boys' name, but can also be a girl's name. So I guess it is unisex. Personally, even if that name was more used for girls, I still would see it as being masculine. But that's because I like ultra-feminine names like Isabella, Elizabeth, and Vivienne. It's a matter of personal taste. If you like that name, then that's all that should matter to you. You will always find that most people think it's a boy's name. And when you said that "your son would get beat up on the playground," I think it's actually the other way around. A girl named Morgan will be the one teased and ridiculed. But again, it's a matter of personal taste and everyone is entitled to give their own opinion.|`|kPl8TTzNaa	The question should be: Morgan is a boy's name, why is it unisex? Morgan is a masculine boy's name. Nothing about it is feminine. The -gan ending is masculine, just like other names ending in -gan; Teagan, Reagan, Logan, etc. It is perfectly fine for a boy and if anything, it would be a girl who would have issues with it.<br>  <br>  I hate when people say Morgan is a girl's name, when it is not. I too cannot understand why it is considered "unisex" when it is not and never will be.|`|zCXRxuSGaa	Thats a tad bit sexist, I dont know any girls with the name Morgan, but i know a few boys with it. Also if you told little kids this they will be so confussed as one of the bears on bananas in pajamas the only boy teddy was named MORGAN. <br>  <br>  Its your own individual opinion. As i think its perfers boys better and the girls version is more Megan. <br>  <br>  But as i said its a personal opinion.|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	Each to their own - you can argue that just about any name is unisex seeing as so many people insist on calling their children 'unique' names.<br>  I don't think it's a pretty girls name at all - it sounds trendy and modern, but not pretty and feminine. I wouldn't personally chose it for my girls.|`|006ed0be5fe4d5038edb0687a8ef5597aa	When I was growing up, it was primarily a boy's name.  Over the years, these names have become girl's names.  They go either way.  It depends on what middle name you put with it.|`|iMaTMWMxaa	I've only ever known Morgan as a boys name.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't use it for a girl. Guess it depends on if you know someone with that name and maybe what country you are in :)|`|2bc760aca1235845cc56ee2f6d0c17d5aa	I always think of captain Morgan (some kind of alcoholic drink).<br>  <br>  Sorry, but if I were to see that name on a job application or resume I would think the applicant was a male.|`|d7769329bd0a2936e9a45b35adc6db88aa	what is your question
kaqPSgTVaa	It's your choice. If the baby continues to grow then tell them you want to wait it out. I was induced at 36 weeks due to stunted growth and my baby was ok at that point but it was a hard labor and I did indeed need an emergency C-Section. As long as your baby is healthy and growing it's your choice.|`|Cg4fWi3Baa	Any chance you could see someone else for a 2nd opinion? You have got to do what you believe is best for your baby. No doubt your hubby is worried. Maybe if you keep at him he might give you some imput.|`|OOEQUMMTaa	why dont you do what your doctors says, because you dont want "to hurt your baby" <br>  That would worry me but the again, I am a big worry wort. good luck and best wishes.
n9hPQhbOaa	1st off im very sorry for your loss it always sucks iv been through it once and you are going to bleed like that its your uterus squessing it all out but in my case i had a d&c done did they do a ultrasound?<br>  if not they really should to see if there is anything still in there i went through the same thing i kept going back and finally they just did a d&c and if ur bleeding like that i think u need one as well if not go to a diff doc cuz if u do not get one and it just stays in there you can get a serious infection and not b able to have children later|`|kaqPSgTVaa	You should probably call your doctor in the morning. He may want you to come in again.|`|VRSUyeqbaa	you should have had the D & C, because no matter what they tell you, not all of the baby comes out. i would definitely go back to you doctor and ask for one. better safe then sorry
8wnvhBQTaa	I dropped the bottle for my twins at 9 months and combined a cup of milk 6oz with breakfast and usually give finger food that way they decide if they want the milk or more solids they sometimes drink all there milk and other times they only take half but I do give them some spoon feed breakfast every other day with a cup of (formula).|`|Hm7MtmYPaa	No, I'd drop using $ instead of S.<br>  It's annoying, and makes you look pretty ridiculous.<br>  <br>  If he's not screaming for a bottle before his bath, then I'd wait and just give it to him with breakfast.<br>  Or I'd just make him a few ounces, instead of 7, and give him the rest at breakfast.|`|26cnysY3aa	It depends on how old your son is!<br>  <br>  EDIT...well then id say yes, if hes 9months....<br>  give him is breaky 1st..and bottle after....<br>  <br>  good luck X|`|WKqXE6X4aa	Depending on how old you son is really, but I wouldnt suggest dropping the bottle all together because milk is a very important part of a childs diet.<br>  Its also important that they are eating a fair amount of food too so all I can advise is that you maybe reduce the milk - rather than offering 7oz, just offer 5oz. Your baby will still be hungry which means you can then top him up with his breakfast.<br>  This way you are giving him the best of both worlds.<br>  <br>  That morning bottle in my opinion is one of the most important bottles of the day|`|b8f0CfSsaa	How old is he? When my daughter turned 6 months I would give her some baby cereal with a bottle of formula and then bath her. I think I dropped the AM bottle for the same reason as you!<br>  <br>  9 months is fine to drop the AM bottle. I found that my daughter wasn't interested in it from 6 months, I think it differs from child to child. Some babies are ready to miss their AM bottle and have it with breakfast early.|`|gW3k9Eyhaa	As long as he's getting the proper intake of milk for his age throughout the day then it shouldn't be a problem :)
TjJZqsN5aa	Sounds like a normal child who is just getting used to having to put themselves to sleep.<br>  just remember one thing<br>  <br>  dont give in and rock him to sleep or pick him up even. then your child knows he can win if he keep crying, then he gets what he wants. if you say its bedtime - then its bed time. he will get used to this and go to sleep himself.<br>  it will only be a matter of short time before he will drift off to sleep fine by himself. <br>  <br>  when he gets a little older and will be able to find his dummy and put it back in his mouth. <br>  <br>  you are pretty lucky to have your child only wake once through the night!<br>  <br>  goodluck and dont give in! =)|`|WKqXE6X4aa	Seperation anxiety is well and truely in place now with your 9 month old, especially if you spend alot of time with him.<br>  My son is 8 months old and is very clingy to me. I did used to have that problem except he used to cry when I walked out of the room and put his arms up to be picked up again.<br>  What I did was just walk away and carry on downstairs, he will cry for a little while but then he settled. He doesnt do it anymore.<br>  <br>  If his dummy is a problem, then just leave it out, if he takes it out then leave it out and if he really wants it, he should be mobile enough to get it as its only usually by their head or body.<br>  If you keep going in to give him his dummy, he thinks its a game|`|7ZyYXu9Saa	Hmmm ..|`|AA11230809	...what?|`|eRpNSTgpaa	been there, done that, it is very annoying but alot of babies loose there dummies in there sleep, you could try leaving it for a lil while and seeing if he goes back off 2 sleep, sometimes they just need 2 cry it out, if you keep running u will always have to keep running. it doesnt hurt a baby to cry a bit, clears there lungs..hope you get him settled better soon|`|LyS5lPAEaa	yes it probably has everything to do with seperation anxiety.<br>  probaly wants to be with you.u  should either go to baby learning classes or stay away from him longer periods each time cause then he will learn to not be upset being away from u|`|ay8tXLD2aa	It could be one of two things -- under tired or over tired!  Is he getting enough daytime sleep? If not, he could be overtired, which ironically wakes babies up and they have a hard time "transitioning" from one sleep cycle into the next. <br>  <br>  Or, if he is getting too much daytime sleep, he could be undertired. Is he playful when he wakes? He could also be undrertired if he is having a good amount of daytime sleep, but his awake time is not active enough for him. <br>  <br>  Two opposites, but two things to try! Keep a log for a week of his naps and night time sleep patterns and then take a look. Most 9 month old babies need about 3 hours of day time sleep, although some get more or less, depending on the baby.|`|gW3k9Eyhaa	If it is then you need to get rid of the dummy. With my son I had the same problem so I gave him his milk before bed then his dummy to help him drift off to sleep. When he would wake during the night I just gently pat his tummy and let him now mummy is here instead of replacing the dummy. Soon after that he was self soothing and would only stir a little then go back to sleep. It's all a comfort thing and the sooner you ditch the dummy the better your sleep will be :)

vygYFdsSaa	It's completely up to you. If you are just on the pill, it shouldn't take long at all for your body to get back on track -- many women conceive during their first month off the pill. I don't believe that the pill messes up your body; it regulates your cycle, can clear up breakouts and gives you a lighter flow. All positives to me. If you think you can be reliable with condoms, then go for it, but accidents happen with condoms (breaks, slips, got caught up in the heat of the moment and didn't want to go get one....etc). Best of luck with your decision|`|kaqPSgTVaa	That's a personal decision and one only you can make.|`|ih2RV0pJaa	birth control does in a way mess up your body. but it's good your taking control of protection. it's honestly up to you.

This usually helps as well|`|ybexjS2Paa	Drinking cool milk used to help me to relive the heartburn when I was pregnant. It's worth trying :)|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Try drinking some milk and sitting in a reclined position.|`|jNgh3e3Faa	Avoid large meals. Overstuffing your already cramped stomach can make heartburn worse. Eat five to six small meals a day instead of three big meals. Take small bites, and chew your food well. <br>  Avoid foods that trigger heartburn. These include chocolate, citrus fruits and juices, tomatoes and tomato-based products, mustard, vinegar, mint products, and highly seasoned, fried, and fatty foods. <br>  Drink very little during meals. Don't overextend your stomach with liquids at meals. <br>  Chew non-peppermint gum. Some studies show that chewing gum will decrease the discomfort of heartburn - although peppermint is known to irritate heartburn. <br>  Sleep at a slight incline. Prop yourself up on a few pillows to keep your stomach acids below your diaphragm. Wait for at least an hour after eating before lying down. <br>  A glass of milk may help you also.<br>  Sleep with your head and shoulders propped up with a wedge pillow or elevate the head of your bed six to eight inches. This will allow gravity to work for you and it will help keep your stomach acids where they should be--in your stomach and not in your esophagus.<br>  Consult your doctor. If natural attempts to control heartburn don't work, ask your doctor which over-the-counter antacids will work best for you. Even while pregnant.
kaqPSgTVaa	The doctor didn't test for pregnancy he tested for UTI so no. It's also too early to get a positive with a urine test.

Obviously a couple days after your period does not represent that.  On top of that he pulled out.<br>  <br>  Like I said I highly doubt you are - U won't be able to test at least until 4 days before your next period.

EyKJ737daa	Generally discharge during pregnancy is very normal hence why they suggest you wear a pad especially towards the end of your pregnancy but if you are having as much as you say you are then chances are you could very well have the start of a yeast infection.  Try cutting back on your sugar intake as this will assist in reducing the discharge hopefully.  If it's not itchy or uncomfortable otherwise, then it could very well be just the way your body is during pregnancy.  if you are ever unsure though sweetie, a quick check with the doctor will put your mind at ease but I'm sure everything is just fine and on schedule as it should.  All the very best of wishes and take care x|`|vygYFdsSaa	I haven't experienced an exceptionally heavy discharge yet (I'm 15 1/2 weeks).

1thzSbS8aa	You're not even late. February has 2-3 fewer days in it than other months. Think of March 3 as February 31.<br>  <br>  Your period wouldn't stop until after implantation anyway, even if you did manage to get pregnant. Implantation requires 6-12 days, not *2*.<br>  <br>  So it is also too soon for a pregnancy test. Disregard any advice to get a test now.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	How long ago was this possible conception? If it was about two weeks ago you would have been ovulating and it would have been possible for you to get pregnant, unlikely but possible. If it was only a few days ago (that's how I read it, I'm sorry if I'm wrong) then you would most likely not have been ovulating and getting pregnant that close to your period does not stop your period from coming. Your body doesn't know you are pregnant until implantation occurs which is about 4-16 days after sex/ovulation.|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	Take a preg. test and, see the doctor.|`|riX0kODEaa	jesus christ wut is it with u damn horny teenagers and ur inability to use a freakin condom<br>  good god >><br>  use some common sense

FctjUdU5aa	Bleeding:  check.<br>  4 negative tests:  check.<br>  No weight gain:  check.<br>  Responsible use of birth control:  check.<br>  <br>  You're fine, babe.  No worries.<br>  It's good that you're taking sex seriously though.  Pregnancy scares are indeed scary.  ...But if you're still really concerned, just go and see a doctor.  If that's what it takes to ease your mind.  <br>  <br>  On another note, it's possible you might have a bit of obsessive compulsion.  It's not as horrible as it sounds...  And it's better than unwanted pregnancy!  If you have repetitive thoughts and anxieties about other things, too, it might be good to check in with a psychologist.  It's not a big deal, and you might be totally a-ok, but it wouldn't hurt to know.<br>  <br>  Also, in the future, if you're worried about sex, ask your clinic on the effectiveness of various birth control.  Or maybe double up with vaginal film or spermicide.  IUDs are expensive, but are also pretty effective, if you don't wanna be makin' babies.  <br>  <br>  Best. :)|`|bpwehYLaaa	You're not pregnant if the test came back negative. My wife and I having a baby again,and she took her test just a few weeks after missing her period and it came back positive so yeah if you was 4 months would not only show on a test but you'd probably start showing too.

lJ5Ao2aIaa	You're the best judge of whether your baby is really ill, so call if you're worried, no matter what his temperature is.<br>  <br>  A temperature reading isn't the only indication of whether a fever is serious. Your baby's age is a factor (fever is more serious in babies under 3 months), as is his behavior (a high fever that doesn't stop him from playing and feeding normally may not be cause for alarm).<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that everyone's temperature rises in the late afternoon and early evening and falls between midnight and early morning. The natural cycle of our internal thermostat explains why doctors get most of their phone calls about fever in the late afternoon and early evening.<br>  <br>  Ask your baby's doctor when she'd like you to call if your baby has a fever. Common guidelines are:<br>  <br>  ?  If your baby is 6 months or older, call if his fever reaches 103 degrees F (39.4 degrees C) or higher.<br>  <br>  When you call, the doctor will probably ask you about other symptoms. The most important thing is how your baby looks and acts — if he has lost his appetite, has little energy, is noticeably pale or flushed, or is extremely irritable and can't be consoled, or if you notice other changes in his behavior and appearance.<br>  <br>  Be sure to mention other symptoms, too, such as a cough, signs of ear pain, vomiting, or diarrhea. These can help the doctor make a diagnosis. She will then tell you how to care for your baby and whether you need to come into the office.<br>  <br>  Be on the lookout for any of the following symptoms, which could indicate a more serious problem when coupled with a fever:<br>  <br>  ?  Your baby has small, purple-red spots on his skin that don't turn white or paler when you press on them, or he has large purple blotches. Both of these can signal a very serious bacterial infection.<br>  <br>  ?  Your baby is having difficulty breathing (working harder to breathe or breathing faster than usual) even after you clear his nose with a bulb syringe. This could indicate pneumonia or bronchiolitis.|`|Hm7MtmYPaa	Yeah, you should probably take him in.<br>  That's pretty high for a nine month old.<br>  And since the Tylenol isn't making his temp go down like it should, it's even more important.<br>  A teething fever is generally low-grade, and so is a fever from a cold.<br>  But 102, that's probably bad.|`|7QrqI6xfaa	yea would be a good idea. better safe then sorry

AA11327865	It sounds like your body's not getting the message to start labour - perhaps going to the doctor to get some oxytocin to induce it would help?<br>  <br>  There are natural ways of creating oxytocin - it's the feel good / social glue hormone so sexual activity and cuddling release it as does pumping / massaging your breasts.<br>  <br>  Check your intuition on what to do, and always err on the side of caution.<br>  <br>  On a bit of a tangent - if you are breast feeding and someone tries to tell you that breast milk goes bad as quickly as formula, they're misinformed. Breast milk is alive and actually lasts hours in room temperature and days in the fridge (and even longer if frozen, but it's not as alive if you do).<br>  <br>  I hope your birth and beyond are joyful events with no issues :)|`|EtUkys6Waa	That baby will not stay in there for ever.|`|e20a45fd7b2a5384cb2b799947aaff89aa	if you havent had the baby by a certain time after the plug has been lost, then the baby has to come out as the plug protects the baby from any foreign bodies that may come to you.they may even induce you.?|`|hitgP4Hoaa	it could still work you never no you culd go anytime. just getting yourself moving and have loads of hot baths and see how you get on with that<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|0MUvGlHkaa	you should be fine you sound like me with my last one a boy too maybe they are stubborn lol

If your current boyfriend truly loves you and wants to be with you, he means it unconditionally. It might hurt him that the baby is not his, but he CAN get over it and accept the child as his own IF he really wants to be with you. The father is easier (in my opinion) since you can tell him over the phone (or even email, if you wanna wimp out, but its really something you need to say to him on the phone). You need to just be straightforward with the father and tell him the situation and what you plan to do. Hopefully he'll step up and choose to support you. Good luck sweetheart and remember don't go freaking everybody out until you have the positive pregnancy test in hand|`|xcGlbDM7aa	:l <br>  you're fuckin' screwed!<br>  if he's a good guy, the guy from another continent, then he'll probably hate you for life.<br>  if he's not a good guy, the guy from another continent, then he'll probably kill you for hurting him.<br>  and as for the possible father of the possible kid you're possibly carrying, he'll probably deny it, as usual.|`|JCWkXn8Aaa	tell him before you met you had sex with another guy and got pregnant.

Even if you are usually regular as clockwork there is nothing to say that your body would all of a sudden decide to prolong your cycle (our bodies are confusing!), again resulting in a later ovulation date.<br>  <br>  It may also be the case that your body has not yet secreted HCG in to your urine. Some women do not secrete enough HCG to show a positive result on a test for a while, so you may want to see your doctor for a blood test.<br>  <br>  <br>  To plan your pregnancy try using an ovulation calculator, visit www.babycentre.co.uk and use their calculator. There you can pin down possible dates of ovulation and enhance your chances of falling pregnant.

s6qgkfLxaa	I know how you feel, I had eight miscarriages before my little boy. When my son was about six days old, I ended up getting a cold sore. (Btw, I giggled at the coleslaw thing. ;) Too cute.)<br>  <br>  Did your doctors test you before to see if you had the herpes virus before? '<br>  <br>  The only reasons that I know of, the reason why the baby girl died in the article above is because the mother had never had one before, and she was a newborn. Thus, the child had not been immuned in any way. <br>  <br>  No, you can't kiss your son right now you need to wait until it's completely healed.. I believe it takes ten days. I have had it all my life. (Thanks to my dad, for kissing me when I was a baby!)  No touching your lips either with your fingers.<br>  <br>  You should talk to your doctor and see if there is anyway they can take precautions just incase, sometimes when I get them I get a sore throat. You don't want your little one to get sick. So do becareful!<br>  <br>  And congratulations.|`|sYsfI856aa	I'm going to guess you mean Cold SORE.  Yes these can be given by contact and you should refrain from kissing anyone while you have one. There are many over the counter meds you can try on them, but be sure to heal it completely before kissing your baby.<br>  <br>  I get these frequently, have since I was 5 years old actually. I found the best thing is toothpaste mixed with salt put that on it, let it dry then flake off..... after awhile do it again with just toothpaste. Really odd that that's what works, but nothing else has for me.<br>  <br>  Take careful care not to share drinks, forks, spoons, etc with anyone as well while you have one, and no oral sex apparently. You'll just have to give your baby lots and lots of hugs for awhile, I always hate it when I can't kiss my son too :(|`|JoyIIiZ6aa	Cold sores are caused by Herpes virus, and are quite contagious, but the good news is that there is now a quick and relatively easy treatment for them.  There is an ointment and a cream called Zovirax (acyclovir).  There is also a pill form of acyclovir, and it is generic.  Both are by perscription only, so you'll need to talk to your doctor, and ask him or her to call it in for you.  In the meantime, wash your hands with soap and warm water, and refrain from kissing your precious little boy.  With Zovirax your cold sore should be gone in just a couple of days.  Good luck to you.|`|hFoYmSgqaa	treat the coldsore with cream to help it heal you can get it from the gp or pharmacist can remember the name. try not to kiss you son but you are more infectous before the blister occurs. he will get them eventually it is not a great risk apart from for very newborn babies. he immunity has had time to develop but just keep an eye on him and if at all worried go to your gp. i was kiss my 4month old son when i had a coldsaw and he is fine. my little boy is very precious too as i nearly lost him at birth, so understand your fears and concerns|`|AA11330115	I think you mean you have a "cold-sore" on your lip..and it's very, very dangerous to kiss your baby when you have a cold-sore.

rSautofoaa	Wow that is scary. Yes, I would try a different kind, but it is possible that you've just got a very smart and somewhat mischievous little fella on your hands. I recommend if you cannot find ones that he can't get out, put them in and then smack some clear packing tape over the top of them. It's not too difficult so if you need to use the outlet you can easily pull it off, but it will be too much work for him to figure out what to do at his age.

k3AmV6waaa	It is the responsibility of the parents to provide carseat for their child, not the taxi driver.|`|oXIYHsDaaa	It's the law here now, but I wasn't a year ago. I think the reasoning behind it is kind of what celtic said, most people who have their children in taxis either don't have a car or are in an emergency situation. It may also be because of the time involved in installing a car seat (we all know how long it can take to get it right if you don't do it all the time) and the fact that not all car seats fit in all cars. It was simple a law for convenience with no accounting for the safety of the child, the law changed here last year and I think gradually it will change everywhere.|`|Lor20kXcaa	Because sometimes, in an emergency, you don't HAVE a car seat.<br>  <br>  What are you supposed to do if someone steals your car?<br>  <br>  But another $400 car seat just for the journey home? <br>  <br>  Sorry, but some people just can't afford that.<br>  Are they suppose to WALK the 35 or more miles home?<br>  <br>  It's not mandatory, because then mothers would have no way to get their child home if something happened.<br>  This is the real world, and women and taxi drivers shouldn't be prosecuted for taking their child home.<br>  <br>  EDIT - I know that the child's safety is paramount, but the law isn't there precisely for that kind of reason.<br>  There should be some form of transport that you don't HAVE to use a car-seat in, otherwise many many women, would be prosecuted for that, without having any other choice.<br>  Of course they should be used at all t imes, when they can be.<br>  <br>  But occasionally, there are circumstances where things happen, and you need to get a child home and you don't have one available.<br>  Parents should not face prosecution for that.<br>  <br>  If it was mandatory, how would you get home, if you missed the last bus?<br>  I live in a rural area, and i have no friends or family around.<br>  A taxi is my only way of getting somewere most of the time.<br>  I take busses most of the time. <br>  <br>  If i missed one, what am I supposed to do, sleep on the street until morning?<br>  <br>  How do you get home, or are you such a wonderful perfect person that you'd never ever miss anything, and ALWAYS have a spare child seat with you.|`|798a7b369cb5d5488af460fb639e81b2aa	If you ask for a taxi with a car seat at the time of reservation. They will send one that has. Most drivers just can not afford the extra space needed to store it in the boot. Infact most taxi's have tie down straps for the trunk because of the amount of suit cases or other shopping passengers often have. <br>  <br>  If you plan it, you can also bring your own car seat. But there are many unforeseen circumstances that require you to use a taxi. And yes it would be a shame if the law required you to leave a mother and baby at a park all night in the rain. Or in a bad area of town or abusive relationship, cause can guarantee the taxi does not have room to store the seat. <br>  <br>  But the taxi office has one if requested in advance.|`|f4zg7LHLaa	i have heard that too, and i have seen plenty of people cart their baby out of taxi's with no carseat. i think it is ridiculous. the taxi drivers should have one in the boot incase they are needed. <br>  a taxi is a car, which could just as easily crash (i'd say more likely the way some of them drive like they own the road!) and i would never be willing to take the risk with my son.|`|MeYILJeSaa	celtic:<br>  Pretty sure the concern is related to the safety of the child, not the convenience of the parent.<br>  How often does a parent have their child in a taxi with no car seat because of an emergency?

Those sleepless nights do send you a bit loopy but they do settle down. <br>  <br>  Have faith and give it time:-)|`|J9QUjetqaa	my baby is 6 months old now and she still wakes up 5 times a night. sometimes more.  <br>  shes not colicky or anything, she rarely cries, she is a very good baby. but she just wont stop waking me up all night =( <br>  not always crying, shes just up making noise.<br>  <br>  So, to answer your question, who the hell knows? lol every baby is different.|`|pj5bUjbQaa	well I started as soon as I could laying my daughter down in her bed when she was half asleep...

vygYFdsSaa	Why the cruel answers to this girl? It isn't necessarily normal to be bleeding during pregnancy and often it's a bad sign (ie indicative of miscarriage) but other times its perfectly fine. Brown discharge is old blood. You need to get checked out ASAP.|`|JebgVOA2aa	It's a misscarriage. <br>  <br>  Sorry.|`|oWlrhhyIaa	It may or may not be a miscarrage. How long did you bleed for and how heavy was the bleeding? Brown discharge is old blood and is not as much to worry about as bright red bleeding.<br>  <br>  See a doc<br>  <br>  Hope all is well|`|SI46bZ8vaa	ahh, pregnancy the slimey miracle<br>  if it's anything it's disgusting|`|Q8tf4B5taa	this isn't normal you need to go and see a doctor asap. I am really sorry to say but it could be a miscarriage.|`|vdmqdlNfaa	my deepest condolences.<br>  please go for a checkup asap.
ibLuXGBVaa	Hi, myself and my partner have been trying as well. You should keep in mind that if you were using any contraceptives before, how long and remember that this takes a while to work out of your system. I have been advised that after taking contraceptives for more than 3 years you need about 6 to 10 months before it has completely worked out of your system. Try to relax and take it as it comes. They also say that stress plays a part in not getting pregnant. It has been about a year now and I think the wait has finally paid off. I am going for my Blood test next week to confirm! <br>  <br>  Wishing you all the best!!|`|jKEe0Le3aa	I'm 39 weeks along and so ready to pop!

Do not have sex everyday. Low sperm count. The trick is to get the sperms in instead of flowing out. So use a pillow below your but before he eject. Stay there for some time maybe 30 mins or so. This works everytime.|`|XyRzSzjtaa	i would say then there might be a problem and you should seek medical advice and go for a xray to see if ur tubes may be blocked. <br>  <br>  <br>  good luk<br>  <br>  baby dust to you both|`|O3EtP4vOaa	Do not have sex everyday switch to every other day you might be using up all the spermies you have to give them time to recharge.

379adf8ec6ff418678fc28b78cee178baa	Have you tried talking to her teacher/instructor about it? Maybe something happened during class and that's why she doesn't want to go. The teacher may be able to talk to her and ease her into going in without you. My daughter is 4 and also in dance. Parents actually aren't even allowed into the room where they do their class and my daughter knows and understands this. Just talk to your daughter and see if you can gain any insight on why exactly she doesn't want to go. Personally i cant stand parents that drag their children in kicking and screaming. Its obvious their child doesn't want to be there and they are distracting the one that do want to be there. If your daughter doesn't want to go don't force her. Try again next year.|`|iMaTMWMxaa	I'm at exactly the same stage with my son (who is 3). He absolutely loves it, has been going for 2 terms, just done a show, and got his first award.<br>  <br>  Suddenly this week, he doesn't want to go. So I said it was fine. If he changes his mind next term that's fine too.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't force her, but I know how frustrating it is, as you can see that they enjoy it and will if they would just go and do it :)|`|1NuKii8qaa	Please wait a little longer, please.
C55pji5Qaa	Depends on the woman,I have been less hormonal than many singleton moms I know and I am having twins.BTW,having twins is extremely stressful on your body. I am measuring 43 weeks and am 35 weeks with over 9lbs of baby.My BP is rising.I am exhausted and have been on bedrest for 3 /12 months.Having twins is not easy!|`|vygYFdsSaa	You aren't going to like my response but do you have a link or something about this I haven't heard anything about a frantic 911 call. Jeez<br>  <br>  Sorry I couldn't answer your question (I did have a bit of a disclaimer before I asked for the link LOL) but thanks for sharing the link anyways.|`|YmEGCGtnaa	i think ms suleman is not a good example bc she has 14 kids so shes beyond stressed besides hormones. she made that call bc she has so many frickin' kids, 8 of them preemie infants. I would be spastic if I were her too.
EiZZWT3xaa	Don't lock her up! I think maybe it would be a good idea to figure out what she does on her own, does she ride her bike, does she like barbies, what does keep her entertained. After you know that information, bring it to the next level, give her something that she would love to do, and then that way, i bet you will see a different side of her and she will probably trust you more. If she likes kites or something, bring her to a park, you might need someone with you to watch the baby in addition especially if you have to entertain her, she probably has a lot of energy. Have a whole list of things to do, so if she gets disinterested you can move on. Here are my ideas:<br>  picnic<br>  zoo<br>  ice skating<br>  thrifting/dress up<br>  making something like bracelets, drawing<br>  science museum<br>  kites<br>  frisbee<br>  swimming, water slide indoors<br>  make candy <br>  send letters to her favorite celebs<br>  some kind of scavenger hunt.<br>  learn/teach those clapping games with her (Ms patty/pancake thing).<br>  Bring her to a book store and read books with her, have her pick out an idea from an activity book<br>  Go sledding<br>  Go to the park and play the lava game with her.<br>  Swings.<br>  Make neat stuff with playdo.<br>  Shrinky dinks!<br>  Make a music video<br>  Watch fave cartoons, special order some, *cheap of course.<br>  Go online to look up coupons or free things for kids. Also, the community newpaper usually has listings.<br>  <br>  Theres so much more, keep brainstorming!|`|f3CfmOqhaa	My little girl is 3 nearly 4 i have the same problem :oS <br>  <br>  One of her favourite things to do tho is play with play doh! It's messy and wrecks the house but she will sit and play with it for hours! Usually i find anything that makes a lot of mess can occupy them haha!!|`|GmQosBg9aa	Firstly well done. I am sure that this is helping out your friend allot.<br>  Well firstly you could bring over puzzles and colouring books and movies. These work really well for girls that age.<br>  For her attitude you could be able to do with her is bring a little treat once in a while when she does something nice ( especially to her mum) so that way you are teaching her what is write in the short time you have with her.<br>  If none of this works, just start talking to her and ask what she likes. I know that little kids like talking about interests and hobbies and what they have in common with you.<br>  best of luck!|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Baking is a good idea. You can also make Play Doh. It's actually very easy and you can find recipes online. You can try some sort of arts and crafts as well.|`|tVB1kbFIaa	baking cakes is a great idea! i'd say watch a Disney movie she hasn't seen yet. it should be easy, you can be the fun aunt! so don't stress it and be silly around her! you could always go to the zoo or for a picnic!|`|AA11330115	How about for lunch time you both make mini pizzas?  Get out all the toppings and she will have fun making up her own pizza...coloring books and puzzles are an idea, and the other girls have suggested Disney films...take her to the local playground so she can use up her energy is another idea. Completely wear her out so all her mom has to do is give her a bath and put her to bed.|`|sfnRrAAmaa	colouring books while watching a disney movie.<br>  maybe see if she has fun taking photos, or posing for them?<br>  read a book<br>  dance to music?|`|tSwCd5kvaa	Lock her up with some toys<br>  Or<br>  Shopping|`|7a29609061cc85b8213f55d1598f7a9aaa	You may well find that she doesn't behave badly for you.<br>  <br>  Familiarity breeds contempt, you know? <br>  Children love to test their parents and stretch the boundries to see just how far they can push them. <br>  The fact she is in a different, less familiar surroundings may calm her down to start off with.<br>  <br>  I suggest you go out for a walk. Get her to bring her bike or scooter and you could take the baby in the pram. The fresh air will tire her out and you'll feel great. You could play 'i spy' games, or look for signs of spring, or other wildlife and bugs. My daughter loves that.<br>  Then you can come home and bake and enjoy a nice treat<br>  <br>  Good for you for helping your friend. What a wonderful treat for your pal<br>  <br>  Most of all, don't stress! Children can smell fear! ;)<br>  <br>  Have a great day<br>  x
mFQydvncaa	You could be, if your getting negatives, i would call a doctor. Get a blood test if your just now getting the spotting it could be late implantation i took a test 4 days after i spotted, and got a faint line, so it maybe hasnt built up yet!<br>  <br>  Wait another day or so and if nothing then def. make an appt. I wish you luck!<br>  <br>  Also. If you are TTC or stressing about being pregnant you can trick your body, i did many times, it will delay your period. But i hope you get the answer you want!|`|c390235b35e55b698e2c1447384879d7aa	my periods have been irregular for a few months. i ended up having all the symptoms you are experienced. my pregnancy tests were all negative but i got confirmation of pregnancy through a blood. test. it sounds like you may be pregnant. i recommend askin your doctor to do a blood test. if you are just having implanation, the levels are too low to be traced by a urine tests. it would take a couple of weeks before higher amounts of hcg would be filtered through your kidneys. good luck. i hope all goes well.|`|n9hPQhbOaa	hi prego!!!<br>  i think u are very much preg congrats <br>  lol<br>  but see a doc anyways
N24wkFROaa	Not sure, I think it's different for every baby though. The first lady said a few minutes so I'll agree with her :P<br>  <br>  Also please stop WRITING IN CAPITALS it's annoying.|`|Hm7MtmYPaa	I don't know.<br>  I got to look at my son for all of five seconds before they whisked him off to get oxygen.|`|572PHHPtaa	Only a short while.<br>   I would say its just like us, when we do exercise - we go red and then slowly go back to normal colour. (Because it is alot of exercise for the baby! lol)<br>  And don't be too worried if your baby is purple when he/she is born. Mine was because it was a tough labour and then as soon as they gave her a bit of oxygen, she was fine. Also, from talking to others - it is very common.<br>  <br>  Good luck x|`|J9QUjetqaa	lol just a few minutes. Mine came out purple.<br>  she was seriously a dark purple, then turned red, then by the time she was being weighed she was a normal color|`|jIfUuSVoaa	My daughter didn't come out red either, she was also just tanned looking!|`|f4zg7LHLaa	my son wasn't red... he was more tanned looking! he stayed that way for a while, but is now pasty and pale like mummy and daddy!
kbphRbIVaa	Yes! It's a brilliant gift, but It'll cost you a pretty penny! If you have the money (and you want to spend that much) go for it! I'm sure she'll be wrapt! If you don't have that much, how about just the dvd or dvds, and chocolate.<br>  I hope she likes the gift!<br>  Good luck!|`|i0Exuxi2aa	Yup. Escpecially if she's a movie junkie. It also proves that you know what she likes and that's good. Take it from a girl, she'll love it!|`|6cho7raNaa	I wouldn't know much on this situation , as I am a guy but i think that's a very good gift idea mate :P|`|lX13Xk0Raa	Is that a good gift?<br>  No.<br>  Is that like the best gift a guy could get his girlfriend?<br>  Yes.<br>  (:
oQDQSSSDaa	I'm not going to judge you, but I do think if you don't want to take away another child's life then use protection such as condom. Or she should go on the pill.|`|kc2Sa7ibaa	CJ is right. The withdrawing method is not a method at all. It is a load of cr@p. Quit having sex! If you are too horny for that birth control and condoms are your best friend. Multiple abortions can lead to issues down the track.. I wouldn't test it.|`|VQmdO9Dwaa	Are you trying to be an irresponsible idiot or are you born this way? <br>  Haven't you learnt your lesson after going through abortion? <br>  Use protection. Too many abortions can lead to problems for your girlfriend in the future, if she wants to have any children.<br>  Also, the "withdrawing method" is heavily flawed. There's still pre-ejaculatory fluid that can certainly impregnate her. People like you shouldn't be having sex.|`|miXLkKq7aa	WTF<br>  <br>  First of all, you idiot, you shouldn't have sex after an abortion until AT LEAST 2 weeks!!! Otherwise, she could get an infection which then could spread to her uterus and fallopian tubes AND if she ever really does want to have kids, she might as well scratch it off her list of "Things she's going to get to do"<br>  <br>  She can get pregnant 14 days or so after an abortion, just like if it was a period! *** holes like y'all make this option a complete disgrace to society.  B/C someone like me who WAS using birth control and WAS using caution...still got pregnant but b/c of health problems I couldn't have it so I had to have an abortion. <br>  <br>  Jump off a bridge please...|`|um8IIEn8aa	FUKKING DUMBASS! PULLOUT METHOD IS PROBABLY HOW SHE GOT PREGO IN THE FRIST PLACE WEAR A FUKKING CONDOM YOU PRICK OR KEEP IT IN YOUR PANTS!|`|7wVKW3l1aa	STOP HAVING SEX OMFG????? WHY GET PREGNANT AGAIN? SO YOU CAN TAKE ANOTHER PRECIOUS LIFE!!!!!!!!
UdICTUnaaa	i'd have to say that you arent as fragile as people would have you believe when you're pregnant... and personally, i didnt lose any sleep when i had my baby... everyone is gonna try to give you advice or tell you how to do things...figure it out for yourself cuz everyone has an opinion and most people are going to try to scare you for some reason<br>  <br>  oh and screw a natural birth, epidural is the way to go!|`|ZaLrtSd7aa	Define "middle of period" - having sex in the middle of your bleed would be real useful since your body is sloughing away the support system for the pregnancy.|`|Hm7MtmYPaa	You should have sex in the middle of your periods.<br>  That's when I conceived my son.|`|cTvP6j7Haa	Relax, enjoy the hanky panky, or the horizontal cha-cha, or the sexercises, and after one and a half years (of pleasure) no luck, you both toddle over to the doctor.  It are the worries that put a 'pluck' into the system.<br>  Peace.

Cg4fWi3Baa	Perhaps you should just go to your doctor and ask the professionals first hand? I don't think you have asked this question in the right section....most of us in the pregnancy section are either parents, happily expecting or trying to concieve. Why would you ask this question here?|`|M9wAOlk3aa	well its not pretty , ive never had one but if your curiosity is really that morbid they show them on youtube sometimes|`|856df45cd220b8db7117dd899c6e5ae2aa	Well...as much as I know I will get hate mail for this...I am not afraid to answer.  You go in at say....8am.  You sign in and go sit in the waiting room.  Then someone calls you to go have a pregnancy test.  Then you wait again.  Then they call you again to go see the counselor, whose job it is to explain all your options to you and to make sure that you are comfortable with your decision, and that you were not forced by anyone to go with through with it.  After she/he is comfortable that all the criteria has been met, they check your vitals and your hemoglobin, and if all is alright, they send you out to pay your money.  Then you get a sedative like Xanax or Ativan and you wait again.  All girls are taken in order received.  After it is your turn, a nurse comes out and takes you back to do the procedure.  You get undressed from the waste down and fasten a huge pad into your underwear for later.  Then a (usually very rude) doctor comes in, and introduces himself, and gives you a HUGE shot in the cervix to numb it.  Then while the needle hangs out of you, he leaves the room for a couple minutes.  Then they give you and ultrasound, only this one is turned away from you so you can't see the fetus.  Then he and the assistant return and she holds your hand and talks to you while he sits with your legs in the sturrups at the end of the table to do the procedure.  He takes rods called "dialating rods" one at a time...each one bigger than the last one, and forces your cervix open...which is the most uncomfortable and downright painful part of it.  This lasts a few minutes until he has room to work.  Then he turns on this big machine that sounds just awful, and puts it inside you and begins to vacuum the "contents of the uterus".  He watches on the ultrasound while he works so he doesn't leave anything behind.  He tugs and pulls on you like you are a piece of meat, and pushes on your stomach.  Then when he's done he simply says "okay, get dressed and walk to the recovery room."  They both leave the room and you are given about five minutes to get up from the table and get yourself dressed and out the door so the next procedure can be performed.  You go to the recovery room, where you spend about 30 minutes or less laying with a heating pad on your stomach area, which is a godsend.  You have REALLY bad cramps during this time because your uterus is bleeding and trying to shrink back to it's normal size.  They bring you a baggie of goodies, like rubbers, and birth control pills (if you want them) and pamphlets about what to do if any complications arise once you leave and phone numbers to call.  They give you some juice and take your vitals and once you check your pad and don't feel dizzy anymore, they discharge you with a rx for a blood clotting drug you can fill if you bleed too much...more than a pad per hour.  Then you go home...it's over.  Some women have hardly no pain afterwards and some have quite a lot for a few days.  After that you bleed for about a week or a little more, and then you stop. Your next period can come any time from then to a month or so...and that is where your cycle starts back up.  There are alot of possible complications with an abortion, but all in all I suppose not more than with delivery.  I think for the most part they are safe in the United States, but there are always those few who develop complications. <br>  <br>  I have personally had some of them, and though it was not the "right" thing to do in some people's eyes...it was for me.   I don't regret them in my life...but I do strongly suggest adoption now that I am older.  Simply because abortion is such a "cold" atmosphere, and at most places, you really feel like a big, dumb piece of meat, by the way you are treated and the doc's attitudes and such.  <br>  <br>  Whatever you decide, just make sure you can live with your decision because it is final.  Good luck.  If you have any other questions, you can email me.<br>  <br>  Kelly|`|ga2gHkJdaa	They put you under anethesia and tell you that you'll be awake for the procedure but you won't remember anything. Just them putting the needle in your arm, and then waking up after its over. You'll prolly cramp some. Some people get dizzy or throw up after. You'll bleed for awhile aferwards, like a period. <br>  <br>  Hope that helps...<br>  <br>  Oh yeah, and most likely there will be protesters outside the clinic screaming at your car.|`|7gLX624Gaa	You should google Silent Scream and watch the movie that will show you what an abortion is really like|`|drDpM6opaa	r u sick or something that is a horrible question to ask why would you want to no that|`|tboBarP7aa	Im not a doctor and im personally extremely against abortions.. Seeing im pregnant with my precious child.. But I do know quite a bit.<br>  My older sister worked in an abortion clinic for some time and shed tell me all the horror stories.<br>  There's a few ways they perform them.<br>  There's the pill you can take up to I think 8 weeks pregnant which terminates the pregnancy early on and gives you a "period" but its actually the tissue and baby and everything passing and I hear it hurts like bad menstrual cramps.<br>  There's also the vaccume techinique where they give the paitient a drug to slightly dialate her cervix and she does have general anesthetic so the pain isn't all there and they suction out all the tissue and uterine matter and the woman usually stays in the recovery room up to 3 hours after. The other is the vaccume and where they use a tool to literally scrape the insides of the uterus to make sure no tissue is remaining in the woman because that can cause severe infection. This method is also very dangerous because the tool they use can sometimes puncture the uterus and cause internal damage and bleeding to other organs which would require invasive surgery at a hospital. <br>  <br>  All are very painful. And im VERY against abortion.|`|JGTtej0laa	Baring in mind this is a pregnancy site, where most people here are happily expecting, or trying to conceive or just enjoying their babies.<br>  <br>  Its a very touchy subject<br>  <br>  why don't you just google it Abortion procedure<br>  <br>  am sure you will get a lot of Information and some even with a pictures<br>  <br>  you can even try you tube
Cg4fWi3Baa	trouble maker alert!|`|kaqPSgTVaa	No.|`|tivpa7Vlaa	nope just home or in church..|`|tboBarP7aa	This question is inappropriate. <br>  It questions religion and certain peoples actions.<br>  What's it matter to you weather or not people prayed.<br>  And if they did its because<br>  Abortion is a sin and completely against everything God stands for.<br>  Abortion needs to be made illegal already.<br>  Its giving someone the choice to end a life. Their CHILDs life. That is disgusting.|`|yf0tevyfaa	No. I don't dive into peoples' personal doings. It's their business, not mine. I like to worry about my own decisions.|`|TzlNjkCQaa	Can't say I have.  I did pee behind a 7-11 last night.  Why?  Had to go really bad.
Jz15JG6baa	I didn't have a C-Section but my perineal tear became very infected and I was re-admitted twice for IV antibiotics and then had to take oral antibiotics for 4 weeks.  My stitches dissolved because of the infection so I had an open wound for about 6 weeks until it healed.  Not nice!  It does get better eventually, though, so chin up - you'll be fine!|`|AA10426129	Yep had the same issue. Took 4 months to heal. It was aweful|`|QCVzUC1baa	Sorry to hear that a c-section is bad enough without an infection to go with it.<br>  I had a c-section in Oct 08 and one of my stitches became infected after a week. I went to the dr's to have it looked at and he just took it out as it was one on the end of the scar. Its now healed took about a week or so. Plus it stays swollen for a while longer.<br>  Congrats on your LO|`|ay8tXLD2aa	I was on amoxicillin+clavulanic acid.  It took 14 days of antibiotics to heal, and then at my 6 week check my doctor found it was still inflamed and warm, which was a good sign that the infection was still brewing, so another 14 days of the same. <br>  <br>  Rest a lot, don't over exert yourself, drink lots of fluids and eat lots of protein - protein helps the wound heal!|`|f4c8bc1971cd1455d61d7a1ad090cf12aa	i had this happen with my open wound for a steralization,usually the anti biotics they give for wounds are (excuse spelling) flucloxillon.it should start healing in a few days if by the end of the course your wound is still infected go back to the g.p for stronger anti biotics,sometimes it does need a couple of courses of anti biotics.|`|z7YyYCYRaa	i had this too i'm sure its really common, i was given penicillin and it cleared up within a week or so, my daughter is 10 weeks old and i'm only noticing my wound to settle down, don't worry it just takes a while.|`|UsUemeVvaa	mine i dont htink was that bad but it took about a month to heal jus had to keep it clean.<br>  hope you feel better soon and congrats on ur new arrival.x
f4c8bc1971cd1455d61d7a1ad090cf12aa	make the most of it and hopefully this will turn into a pattern where your baby will miss the 4.30 feed and sleep until about 7.pm or you could try giving the last feed about 9.30pm and baby may miss that 4.30 feed altogether.usually by 6 weeks most babies get into a routine like yours has and long may it reign.|`|GKVZyHCHaa	That's really good!  My daughter's 8 weeks and 2 days and has been following a similar pattern for the past few weeks.  She has, however, started waking for her 4am feed and then again at 6am (to play!) whereas before she'd sleep on until 8!  Enjoy the sleep while you're getting it, hopefully your little one will stick with that routine!|`|1c1f532d0b7b25b3aae753390d6e60b8aa	thats brilliant - lucky you!<br>  <br>  My two children were great sleepers as well, at 2 months they would have a bedtime feed at 10.30 and sleep until 6.30am<br>  <br>  enjoy it, your baby is clearly content.|`|6lyvhRLsaa	My son slept through a 8 weeks! But now he's up atleast once. <br>  Enjoy the rest while he does it|`|Z5Ut2ZSzaa	My baby is 5 weeks old and is begining to be great she sleeping from half 11 till bout 6/7 in the morning.<br>  I suppose if they unhappy or unsettled they would let you know would they not.<br>  Mind u she hardly sleeps tho the day but would rather have that to get a good nights sleep x|`|gKeLV9HBaa	your very very lucky some baby's do that my daughter from 5 weeks went down at 7 woke at 3 bottle nappy change back down till 7.  At 6 months slept 7 till 7.30 ish its always been like that and shes now 16 months so hopefully it wont change for you enjoy your sleep|`|pzvzzhBmaa	My twin boys slept through the night from 6 weeks. My daughter took 6 months - and we didn't do anything differently!<br>  <br>  Accept your good fortune and smile.|`|EFc8VGwRaa	my lil man slept from 8.30pm till 6.30am since the day he was born he wakes up for a feed at 6.30 then goes back to sleep untill 10...hopefully its not a growth spurt and it lasts for you!!! O and he is now 11 weeks and hopefully he doesnt change his habits anytime soon!!  have a great nights sleep you deserve it!!|`|NpomCCjUaa	I think you should carry on doing exactly what you are doing and hope it establishes into a routine.  I wouldn't try to drop the 4.30am feed just yet as your baby will probably get really hungry and it'll mess up what you've got. Hopefully you are one of the lucky ones whose baby starts sleeping though the night early on.
1OjUQcJpaa	Mine was wonderful and I love the memories of it.  I remember having painless false labor for the previous 2 days before I actually went into active labor...I was 40 weeks.  My husband and I were excited to meet our daughter, and my OB doctor guessed she was almost 8 pounds already so we decided to naturally induce by having sex.  We did this for the 3 days previous to labor...wasn't comfortable, but it made my labor much easier because his semen softened my cervix and prepared me more.  Once I went into active labor I was able to stay at home for the first couple hours of it and that was nice...then once at hospital I requested epidural within an hour and that was amazing.  The hour before the epidural I felt like I was having the worst diarrehea cramps in the world...I wanted to do it naturally but I changed my mind.  After epidural kicked in (immediatly) I layed in bed and felt literally NO PAIN as my cervix continued to dialate.  It was fun in a way to watch the moniter say I was contracting but not to be aware of it.  I even rested during this time. After a couple hours of being fully effaced but not dialating much the nurse poked my anmiotic sac with a tool that has a hook on it (this requires no medicine going into body, completely natural) so it would rupture.  Once it ruptured I dialated from 6cm-10cm in less than 2 hours.  I pushed for 27 mins...and the pain was non existant up until the baby crowned.  Just a little pressure.  The baby crowning (head coming out of vagina) was the worst part and it only lasted for less than a minute, then she plopped out and it was over.  I didn't tear and I thank my nurse for this...be sure to request that your nurse constantly stretch vaginal opening with lube during pushing because it makes a huge difference in the amount you tear or don't tear if she does.  I've learned that they often don't do this, but my nurse did and I didn't tear a single bit.  I went home the next afternoon with my baby, and within a week I was feeling incredible and the bleeding from my uterus (like a period) was completely done.  Not all experiences are this great, and you have little control of most things that happen during your labor, but all I can say is don't fear it and try to enjoy it if it's not just terrible.  Good luck with everything, I hope you have a wonderful labor!|`|jBdvUQEXaa	My first two babies were delivered by Csection my third was a natural delivery. I did labour with no1 but it was an induced labour, very painful and very fast. I had an epidural, but as I could not feel to push etc the labour wasnt progressing and I had an emergency section.<br>  <br>  The third delivery therefore was my first natural labour - it was incredible. It hurt, but it was a good pain if you know what I mean. It was extremely intense and all consuming :-)<br>  <br>  I wish you luck!<br>  <br>  Claire|`|eC1dQVcgaa	Mine was pretty bad due to pre-eclampsia .. i has to have an epidural at 2cm (not by choice) i was contracting 7 in 10 at 2 cm which is pretty bad!<br>  this just carried on and on, and nothing would help not even the hormone drip, or morphine!! =[<br>  I was exhausted from my condition, and i'd been in hospital for 6 weeks, so just frustrated and really ill.. <br>  18 hours,2 epidurals and morphine injections later she arrive in 3 pushes!! <br>  Was all worth it, and i'd have another one tomorrow!! <br>  Good Luck, and i hope you baby arrives safely =] x|`|YWUVRrMMaa	Well I was scared to death with the thought of giving birth especially after the classes I went to. I don't tolerate pain well. I started having contraction around 4am or so. Around 6am I woke up my hubby and told him that I was having contractions and we need to get up and go. He told me to wait a little while longer because since this is my first it would take awhile. He has two kids from a previous marriage. Well... around 7am I was having contraction around every 5 min and very strong ones. So I woke my hubby back up and told him it was time to go I wanted my doctor NOW lol.  So we take the older two to a friend house and head to the hospital. When we got there it was close to 8am or so, the nurse checked me out and I was 8 cm dilated and was wheeled into delivery. I opted for an epidural due to the fact it hurt to sit down (so much pressure). I was fully dilated by 9am and started pushing. My little boy was born just after 10. The next morning we checked out and took our little bundle home. Wonderful experience and I hope to do it again soon after my hubby gets back from Iraq.|`|PvEf8FTraa	Are you sure you want to know :) mine wasn't so great but then again don't want to scare you! But as you asked..... I had a show Friday contractions started lasted all fri night by sat afternoon they had stopped so was sent home as soon as I got home they started again I stayed at home as long as could and arrived at the hospital midnight sunday my son was born the following afternoon by c-section as for the last 9 hours I only dilated 6 cm I got to 8 then there was nothing! It didn't help his back was on mine. Seriously that sounds horrific as after my scar got infected etc was on antibiotics for 2 weeks and the process of healing takes longer. But I can honestly say as bad as that sounds you do forget about it when you hold your baby for the first time and I would do it all over again !! :)|`|AA11330115	Goodness...my first was 19 years ago! I went into labor at 34 weeks...my water had ruptured and I was slowly leaking...I dilated up to 4cm, and even with inducing, I didn't dilate any farther then that...I ended up having an emergency C-Section because she was in distress. She weighed 5 pounds 10 ounces at birth.  My daughter was a preemie and was in the Neo-Natal Intensive Care Unit for about 4 weeks before I was able to take her home.<br>  <br>  And since then, I've had 3 more successful pregnancies, all normal, vaginal births.  My 2nd daughter was born right on time. I went into labor on my due-date and and she was born the following day. She weight 9 pounds, 9 ounces.  She is 17 years old now.<br>  <br>  My son was born early, at 36 weeks, but he was strong and healthy and I was able to take him home 5 days later. He weighed 6 pounds, 6  ounces.  He is now 5. <br>  <br>  My 3rd daughter was born 2 days before her due-date weighing in at a whopping 10 pounds, 2 ounces. She's my 4th of July baby, and turning 4 this year.|`|SY8b17Ldaa	ok to start with mine was bloody aweful but worth it as it took us 2 years to get her..... On thursday 29 jan i mowed our lawn and cooked tea ect ect fri morning i woke up with the sorest back thought it was from mowing and doing to much the day before but as they day went they came and went by midnight i thought i was in labour but at the begining so i called midwives to let them know and they said to come in for a check up we went in and i was told i was 1cm but my baby was posteria spine on spine with me the worst labour apparently and i believe them now my midwife told me on the side to get an epi dural when i came in because i was in for hell we went home i tried to sleep but everytime i layed down it hurt so i was up all night by 8am sat morning i went back in as we were wanting a water birth so they put in bathing delivery room with bed ect with hubby and told me to wait it out and see how far i could go with out epi and we all tried everything to turn her but it wasnt happening  so they gave me water injections in my back reccomended for woman with posteria babies but they did not work by 3pm i was told i wouldnt be delivering today and they were taking me to maternity but i could still have the epi when i wanted it just to let them know by the time i got to maternity my contractions were harder and longer but i was told the anethatist was still in surgery and would be here soon by 4:30 my waters had broken and i was taken back to maternity i was examind and told i had only gone 2cm i was angry and frustrated i started begging them to cut her out but they wouldnt give in to me lol they did however get the dr down to give me epi and he said he would also induce me but no way would i deliver that day but i was getting an epi so i didnt care hehe i really did was ust to tired to argue then contractions started getting really bad the whole time my back is getting every contraction nothing in the front at all they deicicded to give me pethadine to calm me down so they could get epi in like that was gonna work it done jack **** for pain i was examined and was still only 2cm they gve me peth and no lie within a min i was yelling at them i had to push with every contraction they told me to stop pushing or i would do damage and need surgery i said it was not me pushing but my body they dr said he wasnt giving me epi and to check me again they did and her head was right there noone was set up for her nothing was ready they had only just set up for epi my whole labour was 1.5 hrs   only needed  7 stitches here and there it would have been nice though not to go through the day and a half of pre labour in  my back good luck your bub but was prob not a good idea asking for our birth experiences some may frighten you so dont take them on board and just go with the flow best wishes|`|wK4kqhHkaa	I went into labor the day after my due date.  My first sign of labor was my waters breaking i never had a bloody show or anything else.  My waters broke at 1am i didn't start having contractions until an hour later but they came on very strong and close together. I had my beautiful little girl at 8.02am.  So 7hrs from start to finish.  I had gas and a shot of pethadine which worked a treat.  As soon as id finished pushing her out i said i could do it again.  Very hard work but very much worth it.  I was very lucky as i think the average for a first labor is 14hrs.  Best of luck|`|1CryEnb3aa	Mine was fantastic with both deliveries.  My first was long a slow, but good.  Second, was short and to the point.  I recommend an epidural.  I never broke a sweat and my make up looked perfect after delivery with both babies!  I so enjoyed the entire process.  Not many woman can actually say that!  Good luck and just relax!!:)|`|pwu9xzF8aa	mine was pretty good considering i had no idea what i up for.<br>  my labor in total was about 5 hours- which was far better than what i had of expected.<br>  i could have sworn i was in a torture chamber the close it got to her being born lol, but the moment she was out i felt no pain! I had no pain relief at all, and it was hard, but it wasnt that bad- my girl is 12 months tomorrow and i am 5 months pregnant, so i wouldnt go back so quick if it was too bad lol. <br>  no tears, and a healthy girl- i was home 5 hours after i had her.<br>  and i hope things go just as good the second time around!<br>  best of luck to you! hope you get an easier experiance|`|dAgtW3G0aa	I was petrified with my first, my sister had told me her horrific horror story about 18 hours labour and ripping and being stitched and I went into labour expecting an absolute nightmare time,  instead I was induced and it was great, had my waters broken which started contractions and they were mild, like heavy period pains, even when they speeded up and got more intense i still coped with just gas and air,  I foolishly demanded that they let me go to the bathroom because I was convinced I needed to go number twos - of course i didnt need to go, it was the baby causing the pressure because I was close to delivering LOL, I was very embarrased about it afterwards!  The pushing was long and hard, made worse because he was back to back, and the stretching burning sensation when the head crowns was absolutley the worst pain I've ever felt but that doesnt last very long as your baby delivers quite soon after that happens. I've done it 6 times now, I've never torn and been cut and I've always coped with just gas and air and I'm about to do it again (due on saturday) I'm nervous, but I know its only short term pain that my body is designed to cope with.  Good luck hun, it probably wont be as bad you imagine xx|`|EsGrIscFaa	Mine was quite long and drawn out but that was just the lead up. My daughter was is a back-to-back position which made the progress slow. Apart from that I was really happy with how everything went. I had an epidural and from that point was so relaxed and could really focus on the pushing. I had to have an episiotomy but because everything that happened was discussed openly with me I felt like I was in control and that was the most important part of making it a happy experience for me. Good luck with your birth - we should be due about the same time! x|`|70Z4DJOcaa	my son is now 4 months old... i'm 22, fit healthy and my pregnancy was great... had no complications at all<br>  <br>  then i went into labour... 46 hours later i had my son!! yep...46 hours!!! i had him naturally and only had gas and a pethadine shot... i didnt tear which was a suprise since i'm only really little and had a 9pound baby!! i did graze though which hurt so bad for around 3 weeks... every time i had to pee it would be like peeing razor blades because of the graze... natural birth does hurt really really bad but its so good, cause you recover so quick. i was shopping 3 days later!! <br>  <br>  the only downfall was my boobs got HEAPS bigger (from a cup to DD cup) and they hurt like hell when my milk came in! i made sure i took photos LOL cause i've never had big boobs! and now that i've stopped breastfeeding, my boobs are little again :( i breastfed for 8 weeks and it made all my baby weight drop off - lost 10kgs in that short time.<br>  <br>  nothing makes labour easier - prepare for pain... just remember every woman does it, babies were put in there to come out! and it helped me to stay focused and strong. i never once told myself i couldnt do it, if you have the right mindspace it makes a difference. <br>  <br>  in the end it is SO worth it!! i dont want to go through labour again... but i would do it again any day cause a baby is the best thing in the world!!<br>  <br>  good luck|`|tivpa7Vlaa	water broke(day b4 due date) went to l&d, they admit me,gave me poticin, contractions started 9am got worse, worse and detrimental,. i finally got epidural at 4:10pm and was pushing at 5:10pm baby born 5:22pm (on his due date). loved hearing my baby cried for the first time. it crazy how the doctors leave you there just with family all day but once you start feeling the urge to push and baby head could be seen trying to exit..it like a whole staff comes out of nowhere getting ready for baby..then everyone rushes to baby and mama is laying alone with  legs still open forgotten..lol well thats how i felt
k3AmV6waaa	Good thing in life will require a little initiative, just talk to him.|`|nVQGpvuoaa	Well, I'm not gonna read all that.<br>  But, just go for it. <br>  Whats the worse that could happen?|`|yXUS7jz5aa	Just go and do it.|`|NMNfvAj9aa	Go for it you only live once and if you never say anything you will always wonder. Next time you are close to him just start casual conversation.. say hi to him ask his name ect.....|`|YWUVRrMMaa	Relax first. I am a shy person also. I found that if I just say hi it help to get a conversation going. Good luck!|`|jBdvUQEXaa	What has this got to do with pregnancy? Or are you looking waaaay into the future!<br>  Claire|`|a9HNW0kwaa	Just go up to him and say 'Hello'  Introduce yrself and just be friends until u can know him better.
ads40ROCaa	You HAVE to talk to him if you want to persue something!<br>  I feel your pain, I met my boyfriend at our old jobs, but we didn't talk to eachother for 4-5 months because of our shyness. One day I just said "see ya" to him when my shift was over. We said "bye" for 2 weeks, and that was it. Well minus all of the total face blushing we both had. Then I found him on facebook, added him and booted off my computer because I was so nervous he would add me right then and there!  Well, eventually we started messaging, then I gave him my number. We went on one date, and a week later we started dating, November 28th, 2007.<br>  We're still together 15 months later :)<br>  <br>  Pamper yourself the night before, so you feel great about yourself. Dress cute, or do your hair cute, paint your nails- whatever makes you feel good. Say to yourself in the morning a few times "I'm going to talk to him today. I'm going to talk to him today" and get yourself pumped!<br>  Is there a machine you haven't used there? See if he's near it and just ask him "Have you ever used this machine before?

0b03e2fdb4768b40ff4ab8b109b1ab6faa	Be supportive of his daily issues.  Show him that you are there for him and don't condemn or condone.  He will get the help he needs for using only if he wants it.  Sometimes it's tough love that brings children and parents together.  Communicate with him and understand his needs,concerns and issues.  If he is willing to talk with other people, especially a stranger for help, then by all means, let him talk out his problems.  Promote the positive about his new job.  Children usually will raise themselves, parents only need to pick them up and dust them off to send them down life's path again.<br>  Good luck|`|b00ba3d721ffac4d935c0a5f7cf8bd76aa	Just keep watching him, if you find, he is still on drugs, take him to a counseling center or else admit him to a remedial center in your city.<br>  <br>  If he is not, encourage him to work hard and divert his attention, in a different field, which interests him.|`|AsI7NALNaa	Sir I appreciate u, Becoz in this world 75% of parents is  like,, They also have same ur feel, u know ur son charactor.So u go with his way and stop that,,,<br>   its impossible to show ur feel to ur son by the help of third man,<br>  u buy some drugs and go and  give to use it .Here main point is this activity shpuld be hurt ur son,,,,,, these are my simple suggestion.. u dont take any action without any thinging...|`|yXUS7jz5aa	You cant do a thing apart from making sure he cant steal of you.That's one of the first signs he will show. when he is ready for help he will ask for it.|`|P544Sbmqaa	He is an adult, its his life and his repsonsibility.  Nothing you really can do here.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	You cant' do anything. He won't get help until he's ready for it. You can't force someone into rehab. If you did they would just leave and have a higher chance of relapse. Most people have to hit bottom, maybe more than once before they are willing to accept the fact that they need help.

tivpa7Vlaa	well yeah coco butter is recommended but i say anything very oily and full of vitamin e is good. u should keep that belly greased up all day and nite. now you can't stop getting stretch marks but you can stop how much and how bad you get them. i use to use shea butter(pure form) mixed with vitamin e oil everyday. now my belly is wearable to the public. i got very light stretch marks thats not noticeable unless you got down in my belly looking for it. matter fact i went to a club last weekend wearing a belly shirt and a belly ring. people were astonished i had a baby 3mths ago. off course along with lots of gym time and watching what i eat.|`|Cg4fWi3Baa	Oh I swore by cocoa butter with both my pregnancies. I still got a couple of stretch marks with my 1st baby (I don't think you can prevent them all) but it was soooo good for the itch when my skin was stretching as my belly grew.|`|UgIOVl1jaa	Nothing prevents stretch marks, the most we can hope for is for them to fade quickly.  I've found Bio Oil to be the best in keeping my skin moisturised & preventing the itching feeling - good luck :)|`|vygYFdsSaa	The massage has nothing to do with it. Stretch marks are mostly genetic (if your mother got them, you prob will too) but you can use lotions with vitamin e for better skin elasticity. Only thing that will help.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Nothing stops you from getting stretch marks. It's genetic. If your mother or women in your family have them you will too. Nothing prevents them. Lotions help with itching though. My skin gets very dry in pregnancy which makes it itchy. I use lots of lotion, cocoa butter is very good for that.

Lck9Fg04aa	maybe the soap you using? the cream? the oils for stretch marks (if you are), clothes with certain fabrics- anything<br>  <br>  but when you are pregnant your whole body changes including your skin- it could just be from that-<br>  <br>  give it a few days if it does not go away you could see a doctor for cream or something but i dont think its serious|`|1CryEnb3aa	Could be an allergic reaction to many things.

Wn0Hj7H4aa	Like the Brylcreme Commercial "A Little Drop'll Do Ya"|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Pregnancy can happen because precum contains sperm when you've not urinated between the times you've had sex.|`|Cg4fWi3Baa	Orgasm or not it doesn't make a difference. You have intercourse (no it doesn't matter how long for), sperm fertilises the egg and hey presto....PREGNANCY!! And it sounds like you probably did the deed around the time she was ovulating.|`|Lck9Fg04aa	well i would  honeslty say the chances ae quite low- its unlikely- cos you need sperm to fertalize the egg-<br>  <br>  however like everyone has mentioned pre*** can occure and that could result in pregnancy- <br>  <br>  hmm- she should be due her period round about now though right?<br>  if it does not come get her test|`|vygYFdsSaa	Pre-ejaculate contains sperm. Of course its possible.|`|EsGrIscFaa	I honestly wouldn't worry too much over it. The chances of there being a small amount of live sperm still on your penis is there but only small, and it'd have to be a one in a million chance that it'd be lively enough to then fertilise and egg - if there was an egg around to be fertilised that is. So just wait it out. If she's still had no period by next week get a test. Chances are though you're both getting stressed out over nothing. x|`|SY8b17Ldaa	I DOUBT YOUR SPERM WAS EXPOSED TO AIR FOR TO LONG PRIOR TO HAVING SEX AGAIN AND SHE HAS TO BE OVULATING TO FALL PREGNANT I HIGHLY DOUBT SHE WILL BE SO STOP WORRYING|`|tboBarP7aa	There is a posibility.<br>  Its called pre ***.<br>  <br>  And if you're that scared<br>  That she may be pregnant get the plan b pill.<br>  It can be taken up to 72 hrs after the unprotected sex.|`|pksLpEvPaa	yes ur Precum can make her pregneant..but what are the odds...most likeley not but it could happen
AA12270622	Oh, you know... something about it being permanently detrimental because people want it to be.  <br>  <br>  After all, it's natural for members of a species to be traumatized for life by seeing the other members of their species naked.  That's why every animal on Earth wears clothing.  It's not like nudity is what's par for the course for every single life-form on Earth besides us, and we have to work really hard to force ourselves to be hurt by seeing another member of our own species naked.|`|CY8jAXPDaa	How can it be wrong?<br>  My son is my son, he came from me and he is my flesh and blood.<br>  Why would i ever have a problem changing, bathing etc in front of him?<br>  My son won't think anything of it, its completely natural. <br>  I see him naked every single day when i bath him and dress him<br>  I don't think anything other than, <br>  'Right, lets get him clean and dressed' <br>  So why would he think any different when im doing the same?<br>  Hes completely oblivious to any of the crap going on in the world now days (hes only 13 months old) and i will make sure he never thinks there is anything what -so -ever wrong with it all.. because there isn't!<br>  <br>  ETA - Obviously i only change infront of him now because he is still in my room with me, when he is in his own room, i won't need to change infront of him.|`|1b5738a257bf0dcdcf42bd817a1e8692aa	Because then males might learn to see women as people rather than objects and that would totally undermine the whole fabric of polite society.<br>  <br>  It would be a nightmare if the number of rapes started declining, marriages started holding together.  Heck... even prostitution might start to loose business.<br>  <br>  No thank you, the world is just perfect the way it is.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  NOT<br>  <br>  Insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results - Albert Einstein|`|eFkdCBjkaa	The issue would be hormones. Do you really think that this would make your sons comfortable when they reach puberty, or even before? We are not talking prude here. We should be teaching respect for our and others bodies, and the choice of who we wish to be naked around, or who we wish to see naked. It doesn't sound like you are giving your sons this choice. If they are babies, fine..but if they're older? Get a grip.|`|jrVlzffeaa	I don't have a problem with it, nudity is natural, we have bath's toegther sometimes or he sees me in the shower. Some people's minds are so twisted, the first thing my son saw was be naked in the birth pool!! lol Xx<br>  <br>  EDIT: What is wrong with some people with days, one person talking about kids having 'wet dreams' after seeing their mother naked!! My son's 16months and I have no problem him seeing me naked when I'm in the shower etc.|`|X6aYVpU3aa	Depends on how old is your son.  If they are toddlers, they don't mind, what they knew is that is you their mother and nothing else. Once they grew up, i guess that's the big issue.|`|7e700825133cf6328b412b5715dc6692aa	I do not see a problem at all they are MY children if they were someone elses of course it wouldn't be right, people who think its wrong to get changed bathe and change in joint changing rooms at swimming baths with THEIR children maybe need to adjust their mind because they are thinking all wrong about the natural body.|`|TjJZqsN5aa	this is simply natural. i dont see why some people have problems with this. those people obviously dont feel comfortable around their children or have the wrong ideas in their heads! <br>  they need to learn how different people look some day.|`|sR9XV5Z1aa	I would say there's no issue unless your son was from 14 years of age, then it would be kind of creepy.

At 5 months i would say he is too young to go in a forward facing seat but its your decision. Is there anymore padding you can take out of it to give him more room? If not & he is getting too big for the seat ie head & legs over sides then you will have to go & look at other car seats. Take him with you & explain your problem & hopefully the assistants can help you make an informed decision.|`|YWUVRrMMaa	When my son's feet started hanging over the edge of his infant seat I moved him into a bigger car seat. He had more leg room and was still rear facing. Search around to find the best one for you.

Make sure you give her her meds exactly when you are supposed to.  Ensure you have not over dressed her, keep it light and comfortable (logically light, not like a summer pj) I am curious, is she lethargic?  Or is she acting pretty much herself?  My children even with those temperatures are hanging off the chandeliers (Just adding a little humour).  You could also give her a short and I mean short luke warm bath.  Not hot, and definitely not cold cause you could spike her fever.  Now, make sure you do not leave her unattended with a flashing T.V. in a dark room.  And make sure you are giving her the right amount of ml for her weight.  If in doubt talk to your pediatrician.  But really if you don't have lethargy and she is normal it's a sign things are ok.  And don't forget to hydrate her.  Lots of water to cool things down.  Give some feedback if you can so we can help you out better.  I am not trivializing the fever, but it isn't so high that you need to panic.  Just be alert and keep doing what you are doing!  As long as you are keeping it under control.|`|ubhpDXoYaa	Fever is not a disease, instead, it is a symptom that can accompany many childhood illnesses, especially infections. In general, you should call your pediatrician if your infant under three months of age has a rectal temperature above 100.4 degrees F, if your infant aged 3-6 months has a temperature above 101 degrees F, or if an infant above 6 months has a temperature above 103 degrees F.<br>  For most older children, it is not so much the number, but rather how your child is acting that is concerning. If your older child is alert, active and playful, is not having difficulty breathing, and is eating and sleeping well, or if the temperature comes down quickly with home treatments (and he is feeling well), then you don't necessarily need to call your doctor immediately.<br>  While some children are fine with a temperature of 104 degrees , others can be deathly ill with a temperature of 101 degrees or even without a fever or a low temperature. Whether or not your child has a fever, if he is very irritable, confused, lethargic (doesn't easily wake up), has difficulty breathing, has a rapid and weak pulse, is refusing to eat or drink, is still ill-appearing even after the fever is brought down , has a severe headache or other specific complaint (burning with urination, if he is limping, etc), or if he has a fever and it is persistent for more than 24 to 48 hours, then you should call your pediatrician or seek medical attention immediately.<br>  Also, you should call your doctor if your child has a fever and another medical condition (heart disease, cancer, sickle cell, immune system problems, etc.). When in doubt, call your doctor when your child has a fever, especially if you think that your child is ill appearing.<br>  THINGS TO DO<br>  Often replace the child bed-sheet and blanket him with thin cloth only.<br>  Put a damp towel on the child’s forehead.<br>  Do not wake your child to take his temperature. Sleep is more important to him.<br>  Bring the child to a doctor immediately if the child experience convulsion (seizure), child ever experienced convulsion or there are among of your family member who have experienced febrile convulsion.<br>  Bring the child to a doctor immediately if the fever exceeds 24 hours or if you are worry with any sign of disease arouses on your child.<br>  (sorry it was too long)<br>  I search some links for you! <br>  1.<a href="http://my-healths.blogspot.com/2008/03/what-to-do-if-your-child-has-fever.html" rel="nofollow">http://my-healths.blogspot.com/2008/03/w...</a><br>  2.<a href="http://pediatrics.about.com/cs/weeklyquestion/a/122601_ask.htm" rel="nofollow">http://pediatrics.about.com/cs/weeklyque...</a><br>  3.<a href="http://familydoctor.org/online/famdocen/home/children/parents/common/common/069.html" rel="nofollow">http://familydoctor.org/online/famdocen/...</a><br>  Hope i helped! thx!

oj1TszL2aa	I would have thought that you should be absolutely fine, so long as you make sure that the pad is in the correct place and it doesn't slip round or anything (that's the only time I've found that I've 'leaked' as it were). <br>  <br>  You could try tampons, but if the trip's tomorrow that might be rather short notice and it might be better for you to get comfortable with using them first. Hopefully though you will get the chance to go to the toilet whilst on the excursion so you can always keep a spare pad or 2 in a pocket or a bag and change it, just to minimise any possibility of it leaking. <br>  <br>  Periods can be anywhere between 2 and 7/8 days - where ever you fall into that spectrum is completely normal. Mine used to be 8 days until several years back when they changed to 5 days (which is SO much better - I still envy those who have 2 day periods though!) <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.<br>  x|`|XSXdMu0caa	i use to worry about this a lot i had v. heavy periods - the embarrasment <br>  anyway a nighttime pad and tow undewear i think you'll be okay<br>  or coudl you get out of wearing you p.e. kit? are youdoing p.e. if you are get a note <br>  your not alone, i went thorugh this too :)|`|LKZffm2saa	I have a 7 day period also, and I know how much sucks :P <br>  Id suggest a super plus tampon and a maxi pad if youre that worried about bleeding through. And if you dont wear tampons, this is the perfect oppurtunity to start (:|`|um8IIEn8aa	ARE YOU LIKE HAVING FOUNTAINS OF BLOOD???? NO IT SHOULD NOT!|`|Z6uk5wC2aa	this is a problem many young girls go through. <br>  It is usual that you should have your period for 7 days. This is the full amount of time. It should usually get lighter when you get to your 7th day. <br>  I'm sure the blood won't come through two pairs of underwear  and a pad. If you want to be on the safe side get a super tampon as well. <br>  Hope i helped. x|`|gYegoecNaa	When I was younger, and got my periods...they were always 7 days, never shorter.  And they were v.heavy.  However towards the 5th day onwards, they'd be lighter.  The situation your in, is completely normal.<br>  <br>  If you wear a night time pad, you should be fine, that's what they're really meant for...not just nights, but for heavy periods.  And wearing two pairs of undies, you really should be fine.<br>  <br>  Take some extra pads with you though, and if for some reason, you're embarassed by anyone seeing them.  Put them in a cute little make up bag so it'll just seem like you're normal toiletries kit.<br>  <br>  Is it possible for you to wear shorts that are not part of your uniform? If it is, could you wear darker shorts? That would help as well.<br>  <br>  If you've got a good pad that doesn't bunch, shift, or move around but moves with you, you honestly should be fine.<br>  <br>  Good luck and have FUN!|`|X9JSlC6Iaa	I have a 7 day period its normal. Wear a tampon or a maxi pad.|`|H0sPCJQPaa	Get the heavy flow pads and you will be fine :) <br>  <br>  7 days is normal.

eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	sounds like separation anxiety. My son is 9 months, just getting over his second cold and ear infection as well and during the day is needy of me.

I'm going to star this question but I wanted you to know you aren't alone.

CnLL5ENmaa	NO TYLENOL!!  not without doctors approval.  I don't think they would suggest it at that age.  i would take him for a check up just in case. That happened to my son at 6 weeks, he seemed totally fine, eating drinking, just had a little cold.  But his oxygen was low, so they admitted him for 2 days....you can never be too careful|`|hcwp2mAyaa	Same as what my daughter has! I got a "Fess" nasal spray. Its a natural product (i was told its salt water)  and i use the snot remover, i do  this just before her feed and just before she goes to bed for a sleep. You can use it as many times as you like because its all natural.<br>  I also keep tissues on Hand, but instead of wiping, i just dab around her nose and just use the corner of the tissue to wipe mucous from entrance to her nose. Also been using Vaseline to stop dry and irritated skin from appearing above lip n below nose area. <br>  I was told by my doctor not to give baby Panadol until at least 3 months old. And only use if your baby has a temperature.|`|fdceaa401c42420a6b05129fc81a4757aa	Hiya luv, my wee man was 5 wks when he got his first cold and the doc said there was nothing I could give him except for plenty of cuddles. You can buy saline drops from the chemist to squirt up the nose to help unblock it, they're only a quid, I never fancied it cos I hate squirting anything up my nose!|`|Hz2ZRW4Saa	My daughter is 8 weeks old and has had 2 colds already! Doctor wouldnt give her anything and she was so blocked. Get Saline drops and a sucky pump from pharamacy. Put 2 drops up each nostril before a feed. Leave baby for a minute then use the pump to suck the snot/mucus out, You cant swallow it by the way it has a filter. Worked wonders unblocking my daughter.|`|lJ5Ao2aIaa	If your baby has a cold, he might have a runny nose with clear mucus that may thicken and turn gray or yellow or green over the next week or so. He might have a cough or a low-grade fever.<br>  <br>  Make sure he gets plenty of rest and liquids, that means breast milk or formula.<br>  <br>  Since most children can't master nose blowing until about age 4, here are a few ways to help ease your baby's congestion.<br>  <br>  ? Tip your baby's head back and squeeze over-the-counter saline (salt water) drops into his nostrils to loosen up the mucus. Then suction out the liquid and mucus a few minutes later with a rubber bulb syringe. If your baby is having trouble nursing with a stuffy nose, try this tactic about 15 minutes before a feeding. He'll then be able to breathe and suck at the same time. Apply petroleum jelly to the outside of your baby's nostrils to reduce irritation. (Don't use nasal sprays on your baby unless his doctor says it's okay. They may work temporarily but can cause a rebound effect in which the congestion gets worse with continued use.)<br>  <br>  ? Use a humidifier or a cool-mist vaporizer to moisten the air in your baby's room. Or take your baby into the bathroom with you, turn on the hot water, close the door, and sit in the steamy room for about 15 minutes. A warm bath can accomplish the same thing.<br>  <br>  ? Elevate the head of your baby's mattress by placing a couple of towels between the head of the mattress and the crib springs. Sleeping at a slight incline may help relieve his postnasal drip, but don't overdo it. If your baby is a restless sleeper, he could end up flipping around so his feet are higher than his head, defeating the purpose of the elevation. (Never use pillows to prop up your baby as they could suffocate him. And don't put anything under the legs of the crib because that could make it unstable.) You might even consider letting your baby snooze in his car seat in a semi-upright position.<br>  <br>  Hope he gets well soon, and hope my answer helps :)|`|e29442e71576c7cfa0d2e2adc37601e3aa	Hi there. In the short term, try a nice warm shower and let the steam clear his nose. If he doesnt improve, take him to the doctors. They're so little and dont cope like we do. Good luck.|`|TB8Lrd9Waa	my baby had this too wen he was born .  it takes a week or so for all the mucus to clear so the midwife told me. . think keep him warm and tonns of cuddles. .. good luck . .congratulations. .|`|BeLyXy8Iaa	get some snuffle babe.|`|Cx5Zo7IIaa	Baby Tylenol, do the math and be sure of the dosage. 1/4th of a teaspoon or less should do it depending on hir weight. Use a bulb syringe for the snotty nose s/he has. A health food store or alternative remedy store may have something specially suited to newborns that could help.|`|FTFd3AQAaa	humidifier or have him in the bathroom while you have a hot shower, saline drops and that sucker thing :)<br>  <br>  you should hold off on tylenol at that age without the doctor giving the OK and telling you the correct dosage... i know by 2 months they said .4 ml after shots so i have no idea of the dosage for so young a baby or how to measure it without a special oral syringe
0SHOXqb4aa	It's common when the period is due to feel cramp like pains and other pre menstrual symptoms, even though you are in the early stages of pregnancy.

Sperm lives longer then a released egg that is why there is a bigger window to concieve but within 24 hours of ovulating your egg is no longer viable it begins to be absorbed into your body  so no you can't get pregnant after ovulating.

A  real man will listen to a woman that respects him and compliments him before she expresses what she desires and needs from him.) If he really  loves you he will listen. At the same time you might want to change  the way you think concerning having more children.  Children are a blessing but expensive. The  children you already have might just be enough. Go ahead enjoy them. This might you and you husband's time to come closer. if you both can accept that, I might be a good thing that youi haven't had more kids.

If you're lucky they won't return, and the rest of your pregnancy will be symptom free. Enjoy it.|`|ec5386a5779664ccb0217f9b4d534397aa	I wouldn't worry about a thing.  As the hormones in your body change so will your symptoms.  I have read that if ALL your symptoms just go away then you may want to at least call your doctor but really I wouldn't worry about it.  Some days i'm like that and i'm 7-1/2 weeks pregnant and I just had an ultrasound and the baby is GREAT with a good heartbeat.  Some day's i'm nauseous, extremely tired, headache, backache, sore breasts (which that hasn't ever went away), weeing A lot and then about 2-3 days later just sore boobs and tired.  I've been tired and had sore boobs since the beginning.  GOOD LUCK, and don't worry about a thing.

Me imagino lo difícil que debe ser esto para ti, puesto que siempre serán unos bebes, pero es preferible esforzarce un poquito en hablarles ahora, que cuando sea tarde. Explicales que le sexo es muy beneficioso, pero indicale que es cuestión de responsabilidad cuidarse, para no embarazar a una chica, y evitar enfermarse, hablale del sida y sus consecuencias, seguro entienden y saben mas de lo que tu crees.

Lo estaba revisando y creo ke Freud es un autor muy antiguo, ya existen estudios más especializados. La verdad no te sugiero buscar en internet, a veces la informacion puede estar un poco viciada o incompleta, te lo digo yo ke soy sexologo.<br>  <br>  Veras, de hecho estan en la edad en la ke en efecto empizan a autoexplorarse, esto de ninguna manera es malo, ya ke así aprenden a conocerse y a saber ke es lo ke les gusta y como. Donde si debes de poner atencion es en ke esta práctica no se vuelva compulsiva. Es decir, aveces los adolecentes pasan por periodos intensos de ansiedad y estres por una infinidad de cosas, lo cual lo pueden mitigar con acciones ke realizan muy frecuentemente, tambien se pueden provocar lo ke comunmente llamamos tics. <br>  <br>  Como puedes ver ke esto no les pasé? Un indicador muy claro es ke en ocaciones por masturbarse dejen de hacer cosas ke tienen ke hacer o ke comunmente harian. Ejemplo: Ke por estar autoestimulandose dejen sus pasatiempos abituales. Es decir ke por tener esta practica dejen de hacer otras cosas ke comunmente harian.<br>  <br>  Creo ke por el momento es de lo único ke te debes preocupar dada su edad. Existen otras cosas en las ke "ellos" deben de poner atencion, pero si tu puedes darles una orientacion....eso estaría bien. Estas son, los periodos en los ke lo hacen, el ritmo al ke lo hacen y la frecuencia, especialmente por el muchacho de 10 a?os.<br>  <br>  Si kieres mas informacion te recomiendo ke buskes biblografia, la editorial "armario abierto" esta especialmente dedicada a temas de sexualidad y sin duda podras encontrar algo ke te ayude. Si puedo ayudar en algo escribeme no hay problema.<br>  <br>  Suerte y trankila, no te estreses. No pasa nada malo. De hecho la autoestimulacion es muy recomendable....para ambos sexos.|`|6ac34a25e714197da610485ad5aed6f2aa	creo que eso le toca al papa|`|9HU0Wm0Taa	No te aflijas, es un proceso natural y hasta esperado de autoexploración que se despierta en la pubertad y que continuará hasta la adolescencia, solo para descubrir que proveerse de placer es un medio de estímulo y liberación de estrés ante la naciente sexualidad, y que aparecerá tarde o temprano. En algunos individuos este autoreconocimiento aparece a edad más tardía. Algunas veces es desencadenado por simples cambios físicos que se autoregulan con el conocimiento propio y/o actividades que los distraiga de ello, como el deporte, actividades de grupo o la convivencia en familia. Lo sorprendente del asunto es que tú les hayas preguntado al respecto, te lo hayan dicho o los hayas sorprendido, no lo sé. En realidad es extraordinario, sea cual fuere el caso. Nadie hace tan fácilmente una confesión de esta naturaleza tan íntima, en especial a la madre. Los varones por lo regular se sienten más cómodos hablando del tema sexual con el padre, así que no los presiones ni los mortifiques con el tema. Mejor habla con tu esposo para que sea el quien los oriente, con quien seguro se abrirán mejor y se sentirán cómodos y hasta curiosos en el buen sentido, para aprender más acerca de sí mismos y del cuerpo humano. Si quieres saber más del tema, mejor platíquenlo o háblenlo con un profesional: un sexólogo reconocido y, de preferencia recomendado por su autoridad en el tema, profesionalismo, seriedad, discresión, respeto y tacto. Regularmente las pláticas con otros padres solo aumentan tus angustias o simplemente estarán plagadas de prejuicios que a tí no te servirán en absolutamente de nada, ni te convienen y solo aumentarán tus temores y dudas. Lo que sí les puedes decir es que no permitan que alguien, de cualquier sexo o edad, parentesco o no, les toque de manera impropia o que les incomode. Nadie , absolutamente nadie más que ellos por voluntad propia, y esto te lo digo en serio, apesar de los consejos y rega?os, aunque sean cari?osos que les digan, evitará este proceso, ya sea que hagan esta práctica ya sea en tu casa o en otra parte. Créeme, es algo que le acontece a millones de varones desde que el hombre es hombre, no importa su credo, raza, o posición social.<br>  <br>  Por otro lado, recomiendo que evites caer en moralismos fatuos que no le resolverán sus dudas, solo las intensificarán. Guarda la discresión que requiere el tema y no lo platiques tan fácilmente con cualquiera, en especial aquellas personas que se admiran todavía de que esto pase (siempre ha pasado, por cierto, es de lo más normal) y que solo verán con morbosidad el tema, echándole la culpa a lo que representan actualmente los medios, y cómo se han"vuelto descaradamente cínicos en abordar y tomar a la ligereza estos temas, sin recato ni pudor", no aportándote nada útil y sí desviándote del tema para terminar solo en una plática llena de mojigatería y falsas poses que no resuelven su y solo su problema, el de los padres. Abordar el tema de enfermedades peligrosas como las venéreas, herpes, clamidia, sida, síndrome de papiloma humano, etc. no  son cosa de juego. La verdad de las cosas, ahora es cuando la explosión de hormonas entra en juego de una manera caótica y que incluso reordenan el pensamiento. Sin hipocresías, los valores que les inculques para bien de su vida estan compitiendo con lo que sienten y les causa placer. Hablar a tiempo de causales de dolores de cabeza, como embarazos precoces indeseados, irritación de genitales, y las enfermedades mencionadas entre otras relacionadas al tema, son cosas de las que sí hay que advertirles y de las que se deben cuidar. Sin tapujos y sin falsa moralidad. Nadie quita el hecho de que en nuestro tradicional modo de ver y abordar el tema con tintes religiosos  y que estará siempre presente especialmente en países como los latinoamericanos tendrá un papel muy influyente. Pero repito, la mejor orientación es la informada, y tanto tú como tu esposo deberían evitar falsas fuentes de información. Recuerda que entre más pasan los a?os, la mediatizada vida que llevamos les lleva información más amplia y precisa de lo que tu crees. Usar esa información de manera errónea les podría causar más de una frustración, por decir lo menos, y más de un peligro, por decir lo más. Toma en cuenta que están en contacto de influencias heterogéneas y alternas a tí, como sus propios compa?eros, internet y tal vez, me atrevo a decir, revistas pornográficas. Por lo de la plática con tu esposo, no te preocupes. Es su padre y sabrá mejor que nadie que enfoque y orientación deberán recibir. Eso sí, que lo haga ya. No vaya siendo que más tarde se arrepientan de no haberlo hecho por cuestiones morales, timidez o incomodidad de abordar el tema.<br>  <br>  Respecto a buscar en internet, CUIDADO. Es en serio. Sabiendo un poco del lenguaje de programación web, hasta un chavo de 14 a?os puede subir a la red cualquier tontería. Al ser un medio en el cual libre y soberanamente puedes subir información irrestricta, sin bases ni fundamento, ni filtros de revisión por expertos reconocidos, no todo en internet es neta. Existen charlatanes que se precian de serlo y no hay medio para verificarlo. Solo profesionales calificados pueden avalar los libros que incluso deben de revisarse con el fin de no caer en manos de uno de estos irresponsables. El cari?o de padres y la confianza depositada en el seno familiar es la base de los vínculos de una comunicación abierta y honesta a la que se deben abrir por medio de una adecuada orientación con ayuda de los canales autorizados en la materia. Ama mucho a tus hijos y protégelos de sofismas (mentiras disfrazadas de verdades). Pero sobre todo, busca la alegría de compartir en la convivencia los momentos de intimidad familiar de una manera sana y responsable, evitando rega?os y mortificaciones inecesarias que nada tienen que ver con la educación de los hijos y sí con malos entendidos que solo crean resentimiento, desconfianza y aislamiento. Saludos y te felicito por tus hijos y por la apertura tan maravillosa que tienes con ellos. No todos tienen la fortuna de crecer en ese ambiente cálido y lleno de amorosa confianza que debería de existir en todos los hogares. Espero que mi opinieon te sea de alguna utilidad.|`|A0zfUHo6aa	no los reprimas alfin y al cabo todos lo hacemos!! aunque si estan muy ni?os para masturbarse!!<br>  pero en fin lo mejor esque no los reprimas por lo que hacen|`|Bql0Xjfeaa	fijate muy bien que tipos de amistades tienen tus morros  lgun primo ahi o amigo que les anden ense?ando cosas que no deven de ver todavia|`|DU0ruGLVaa	No tienes que hacer nada, es normal que con esa edad empiezen a masturbarse, yo empezé con 11 a?os.

Si bien es cierto la masturbación no es malo, sería recomendable monitorear sus actitudes a otras actividades, como por ejemplo la práctica de la natación. Está comprobado que el deporte orienta y modifica progresivamente las actitudes de las personas: especialmente los ni?os; verás que poco a poco se les pasará esa necesidad tan natural de la humanidad..|`|eed79da636c8870bcefb661be956a469aa	de ves de sirles que eso es privado y no deven aserlo con nadien mas .yque ademas que toda via son muy peque?o y que deven esperar asu debido tiempo|`|jaN8xdHpaa	Pues decirles que masturbarse es lo más natural del mundo, una forma muy gratificante de obtener placer y el mejor método para conocer su cuerpo y aprender a disfrutar del mismo.<br>  <br>  Yo tengo una hija y un hijo algo mayores y conforme han ido creciendo he intentando transmitirle que el sexo es una práctica placentera y saludable y que la masturbación es la primera forma de acercarse al sexo. No les he animado a hacerlo, no ha hecho falta, simplemente he procurado hacerles ver que es algo natural, reconociendo con naturalidad que, incluso yo, lo hago.<br>  <br>  No debes olvidar decirles que es algo que deben hacer en su intimidad y, un consejo práctico, procura dejarles una caja de kleenex a su alcance en su habitación y ense?arles a que se ocupen de tirarla al water.<br>  <br>  Intenta asumirlo con naturalidad, les ayudarás a hacerlo ellos también.|`|5d1daa4558c6c5f3e8de5c467b9580e1aa	No tienes por que decirles nada, es normal, pero han de saber por tí que eso es una exploración SUYA y de su cuerpo, que no debe involucrar a terceras personas hasta que no tengan conciencia de su cuerpo y de sus sentimientos hacia que alguien les toque, evidentemente no con estas palabras, pero sí tratando de explicar que es algo muy personal e íntimo de ellos.<br>  <br>  Suerte, estos asuntos suelen ser más espinosos para los padres que para los hijos!! :D|`|820f98112a8757ba2839483cca31f649aa	Guau , son algo prekoces , sin animo de ofender , yo me tarde mucho mas . <br>  Pues supongo ke darles klases de educacion sexual seria algo konveniente , cheka paginas sobre eso y ve que les vas a ense?ar y que no , aunke a esa edad y haciendo lo que haces , les digas como usar condones y todo el rollo , digo , por si encuentran a alguien con kien dejar de masturbarse , no se metan en lios peores.|`|901d8a46c78ac0381c75eafcc7fd427aaa	trata el asunto con naturalidad,y ponte en su puesto a ver que te gustaria qye te dijesen a ti|`|9ee0eef5285314e7fb45fad63b75ca52aa	Son muy ni?os.. segun quien?? cada organismo es distinto y las necesidades fisicas se presentan a partir de los 8 a?os aveces.. solo que aun no se tiene percepcion de que es una necesidad fisica.. yo te recomiendo que los instruyas en la sexualidad, con ejemplos no tan explicativos, y que no les prohibas ni les espies.. dejalos que ellos exploren su cuerpo.. es parte de la madurez y de su escencia humana.. cuando te hablen del tema deja lo que estas haciendo y ponles atencion, dejalos que hablen y expresen sus emociones y sentimientos y preguntales porque lo hacen? si sienten necesidad de hacerlo? si lo hacen porque en algun lado lo vieron? etc... pero siempre tranquilamente como lo natural que es..informales siempre y no defraudes su confianza trata el tema a discrecion con la familia respeta su espacio y su vida.. y estate tranquila que si tu les instruyes y ense?as y los escuchas y los atiendes esto no tiene porque ser preocupante.saludos|`|7a321470e4ab087e034e8361691582b2aa	pues la verdad que debes decirle que es normal , muchos ni?os son precoz y en ves de mentir les o rega?arlo, explica les que es normal.<br>  saludos y suerte|`|ec1cf49ce30aee933208c870da06608daa	No hagas que pierdan la confianza en ti, actúa con toda naturalidad y con mucho cari?o. La masturbación es una conducta normal en el ser humano, más en unos chicos que todavía no pueden ( ni deben)  tener experiencias sexuales con otras personas. Lo que debes decirles es que es un acto natural y muy personal, que no se hace en público y que no permitan que nadie los toque y manipule si ellos así no lo desean.<br>  En ni?os más peque?os de edad pre-escolar, se les dicen que no permitan que nadie toque su cuerpo en la zona que cubre su traje de ba?o y en caso que esto suceda que se lo comuniquen a sus padres.|`|159be09c9e378a35ceededb7738857a4aa	Es normal, no los rega?es, solo orientalos, eso no es malo, tomalo con naturalidad. puedes orientarte con una trabajadora social. saludos.|`|5b0cd9c949e9e9be717bb9f848757ca8aa	Bien en principio son bien peque?itos.Se nota que están influenciado por otros amigos mayores..Estas cosas hay que tratarla con dulzura,hacerle saber que no es malo y a su vez lo peor es el abuso.Paciencia mami,nadie se ha muerto de eso.Controla mejor sus amistades.|`|6ec4e05dece40c5bb13774925603d1edaa	MMM, los ni?os se masturban desde la infancia temprana, te hablo de meses, de los primeros a?os, creo que si los peque?os confían en tí, puedes confiar en ellos para hablar sobre la prevención y esas cosas, no es tampoco para que te infartes, la masturbación es muy natural, sólo ocúpate de hablarles ya sobre el sexo|`|8b639dbfbb78d06f357f996a329583f1aa	creo q es casi normal pero eso tendria q hablarlo con el padre o quiza concurrir aun medico para q te ayude como actuar pero es algo normal tampoco es tan grave mientras repeten su privacidad entre ellos

H0fXySX9aa	at 36 weeks baby's are not considered full term 37 weeks onwards is<br>  my second daughters head was engaged but kept popping out right until labour<br>  babies can engage and you still go past your due date|`|LTD0qL6Yaa	I totally agree with the 1st answer, your baby's head can quite easily pop in and out of the engaged position. Labour could be a week away but it could also be 5 weeks away. Good luck..|`|dAgtW3G0aa	I understand your impatients, I'm due saturday and baby isnt engaged at all and I'm convinced I'm going to go late AGAIN! My babies never seem to want to arrive on time lol. <br>  <br>  Your babies head being engaged is no indication that labour is iminent I'm afraid and like others have said she/he can pop in and out at any time, relax and enjoy your last few weeks as a mum of one!  Two really is twice the work (twice the fun too though!)|`|SiIuJXvwaa	yea its normal for the baby to be engaged now its preparing its self for labour.  you might have about 2 maybe 3 weeks left. go for walks and swims it will help and relax you|`|w10EYKrkaa	With my first pregnancy I was 4/5 engaged from about 34 weeks onwards, so was hoping for early labour, but went 8 days overdue!|`|luLdJ4u5aa	You can only suppose!

RPNFS0U9aa	Okay im not sure if your a "troll" or not, but here goes.<br>  <br>  1.) Why when I ask something about sex everybody answers?<br>  A lot of people find sex an interesting topic, and some people just like discussing it.<br>  <br>  2.) What is this thing they call oral?<br>  Oral sex is using stimulation of the penis, vagina or anus by the use of the mouth, tongue, teeth or throat.<br>  <br>  3.) How does it feel when you did it already? Emotionally and <br>  Physically.<br>  <br>  Physically; After it (depending on the person) you feel satisfied and very relaxed. If it's your first time you might feel slight discomfort and may have some bleeding, depending on it your hymen is broken or not.<br>  <br>  Emotionally; You feel happy, and if you wait till it's with someone you love you feel more close to them then you have ever felt in your life.<br>  <br>  4.) Does it really feel good? Why some find it addicting?<br>  Yes it does feel good!! Some might find it addicting because of the pleasure it can cause, it is a fulfilling feeling and can leave you very satisfied.<br>  <br>  5.) How should you start it?<br>  Foreplay can sometimes be even better then the actual thing! Start of by kissing and exploring each others bodies, rubbing kissing fingering and oral are all good :)<br>  <br>  6.) How do you do it?<br>  The general idea is putting the penis inside the vagina, or anus, and thrusting/penetrating, there are many positions to try and each gives you a different feeling :)<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helped sweety!|`|Qf0rK1RMaa	oral sex is when a man gets his thing sucked off the same for a woman. Start slow take it one step at a time andd u should be ok.|`|XSXdMu0caa	how old are you? <br>  <br>  it can feel good but its not always<br>  it doesnt hurt but women dont always feel good<br>  i'd say mroe if i knew how old you were|`|um8IIEn8aa	ANSWER TO NUMBER TWO! SUKK HIS DICK!|`|N4xn0sufaa	no. 6 only.........<br>  U first can start from the top.<br>  u first kiss then it shifts to boobs then it shifts to the body nd then to the lower portion.???|`|ajbMVt8maa	they are not stupid questions, every one is curious when they are younger.<br>  1. sex is something everyone likes talking about. that is why shows like "sex and the city" are so popular... everybody does it (or will eventually) and everybody likes it.<br>  2. oral is with the mouth. the guy goes down on the girl and vice verse<br>  3. you don't really feel different after you do it the first time. i loved the guy i lost my virginity to (my bf at the time and my hubby now) and so it felt right<br>  4. it feels good if you have a good partner who is willing to make it as good for you as it is for them. some people find it addicting because they have a compulsion problem (something like obsessive compulsive disorder but not exactly the same)<br>  5. you start with kissing and everything else will come naturally (trust me)<br>  6. it's not hard. it is something we are born to know how to do with instinct. you get better with time (everyone is bad at first!) and you should always make sure you do it with someone you care deeply about.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	hon you really should talk to you mom about some of these things, or at least some older woman in your life you are close to...it's better than asking a bunch of strangers here in yahoo who may not give you the age appropriate answers. I will answer for you but only because you asked and there is probably a reason you won't talk to you mom..<br>  <br>  1) because most people have sex on the brain and other wat to help lead kids in the right direction...like I do<br>  <br>  2) oral sex is really quite nasty...no matter what anyone says. It's basically someone putting their mouth on your genital area. No matter what anyone says oral IS sex and therefore if someone gives you oral sex without consent it is RAPE (I was orally raped at 15)<br>  <br>  3) oral is just gross..it made me feel dirty and like less of a young woman<br>  <br>  4) I guess for some it feels good and I am not sure why oral is addicting... the first thing that pops into my mind when i think of oral is porno movies<br>  <br>  5) you'll know when you are old enough...<br>  <br>  6) I won't even go there..|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	1. Be thankful, people respond to your questions.<br>  <br>  2. Oral sex is, where the mouth of one person, intentionally comes in contact with the genitals of another person.<br>  <br>  3. Emotionally, happy.  Physically, drained.<br>  <br>  4. Yes, It does feel good.  While I don't find it, addicting, others do.<br>  <br>  5/6. How a person should start it and, how they do it, is unique to the individual.

And you will go through the whole process and again<br>  <br>  And let me tell you, for the pain you are going through when you finally do get that BFP - it will be so, so, so very sweet!<br>  <br>  Good luck - and I hope that BFP comes soon!|`|1Hrlhx7qaa	i know what you mean my period is now a week late & scared to take another test in case it a BFN again<br>  Good luck
OVbBlWNiaa	Well My Baby Is 7Months Next Week!! She Loves To Sit Up On Her Own And Play With Teething Rings And Teddy's!! Watchin Tv Is Her Fave Though!! She Loves Micky Mouse Club House!! I Only Let Her Watch It For A Bout 15Min's!! She Is So Content That I Don't Have To Do That Much To Please Her!! Lol She Is Easily Amused!!Lol<br>  <br>  Take Care x x x|`|69DjSUVAaa	Alfie has just turned 7 months and he has recently started sitting up unaided yet very unsteady, he loves laying on his front which he used to scream when on his front. He lays on his frint and does what i call dry swimming. It is soooo cute. x|`|333e3165a0426e11bbd47089d6ab94a6aa	my daughters 7 months old. she can sit up on her own and when shes on her hands and knees she rocks like she wants to move but hasnt quite figured out how yet lol. she can drink out of her bottle herself and out of a cup, erm, she is very clingy tho and doesnt like to be put down unless you stay with her. she chews EVERYTHING at the minute as shes about to cut her first tooth. she has rolled over both ways a month or two ago but doesnt do it very often. she has just started to be able to hold onto furniture and stand up alone (only for a few seconds) and you have to put her there she cant pull herself up yet. <br>  <br>  by the way, LOVE this question, letting mummys go on about their babies without feeling like were showing off too much haha|`|lJ5Ao2aIaa	Your baby's play is becoming much more vigorous. When she picks up a spoon now she bangs it against pots and pans, and she furiously rattles the bunch of keys she finds. She can now grab two toys at once and slam them together. But her movements are also becoming more precise; thanks to her growing dexterity, she can pick a raisin off the floor.<br>  <br>  She is becoming aware that objects still exist even when she can no longer see or feel them. This means she'll miss a favorite stuffed animal if she can't see it, and try to search for it. It also means you can begin playing hide-and-seek games with objects. Hide her teddy bear while she's looking, and she'll find it right away — and be very proud she did.<br>  <br>  This is the age at which most babies go mobile. From sitting, it's a short developmental step to scooting around on her stomach, to rocking back and forth on her hands and knees, and then to crawling. By the time she's 8 months old she may be pulling herself up to a standing position and climbing your stairs. The following toys can help her explore her quickly developing senses.<br>  <br>  Busy board: Many babies adore these activity boards that can be attached to a crib rail. They come with parts that move and spin, giving your baby a place to practice coordinating her hands with sensory experiences. She's also getting the idea that you can make things happen to objects — so poking, twisting, squeezing, shaking, dropping, and opening things will fascinate her.<br>  <br>  Soft dolls or stuffed animals: Babies this age often develop an attachment to a "lovey," or favorite toy or blanket. And pediatricians encourage this connection, saying a familiar object can ease transitions later on. Still, some dolls and stuffed animals make more suitable loveys than others. Avoid ones with ribbons, plastic eyes, yarn, or anything that can be pulled off and put into your child's mouth. And don't get dolls so big they're hard for your baby to pick up and explore.<br>  <br>  Balls: Balls are fun for just about any age. Lightweight fabric balls suit this particular crowd well. Roll one back and forth between the two of you on the floor, or when she's older, toss it across the room so can can crawl after it.<br>  <br>  Household items: Look no farther than your kitchen cabinet for some of your baby's favorite items. A plastic bowl, some measuring cups, and wooden spoons will entertain your baby for a long time. Open the cupboard while you're preparing a meal and your baby will pull out a few utensils of her own and whip up something alongside you.<br>  <br>  Wood or soft blocks: Show your baby how to stack a few blocks, and then knock them down. Pile them into containers for her — and dump them out. She'll get the idea. Stacking blocks and filling and dumping games are wildly popular in this age group.<br>  <br>  Moving toys: As your baby begins to crawl and move around, she'll be more interested in toys that do the same. Find some sturdy cars she can push around the rug. Or toys that pop up when your baby pushes just the right spot.<br>  <br>  Books: This is the age at which reading becomes more interactive and fun for both of you. Cloth or board books work well now. After you read the book, you can pass it to her so she can take a turn flipping the pages and "reading" to you.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps :)

For girls I think Dior, Infiniti and Promise are ok.<br>  <br>  I like the idea of Female, but I don't think it would work in real life. <br>  <br>  Think about shortening the names, Lexus can shorten to Lexie, Ballerina maybe to Rina... And for boys maybe you can shorten Courvoisier to Courvey.

E7MgO2pZaa	Honestly it probably has to do with the fact that the kids are still close enough to white to fit in with their family. My mom always told me I didn't look any different from the rest of the family. Ha. I'm clearly Korean and they are clearly white. Part of that decision may lie within people's comfort levels bringing other races into their families. People often lump Asians into a category with other Caucaisans. No one considered my relationships with white guys interracial. Once a coworker asked me how my fiance's family felt about me being "White". Again I am clearly Asian, but I think a large part of society perceives me to be white since I have white colored skin.|`|Tjr9aObNaa	Because they are oh so cute!<br>  *Sarcasm* Seriously though, fashion|`|8Qxb7OZOaa	Because they could care less that they are contributing to human rights violations.   <br>  <br>  They want the youngest whitest healthy baby they can get....they could care less how the child was obtained.<br>  <br>  Many of those children will be told their natural mother left them in a box under a tree near a public building just because some agency making millions of dollars off the babies told them that false story. Screw that babies are kidnapped and/or smuggled in from other asian countries to fill the demand by US paps.|`|NoUkTQCgaa	They don't adopt kids, they adopt babies. If they wanted to parent, there are plenty of older kids right here. It's supply and demand. There are not enough infants to supply infertile couples here in the states, and China has atrocious human rights policies, including the "one child per family" rule. Until these barbaric practices are stopped, and people stop paying the big bucks for babies, Americans will flock there to get what they want.  <br>  Overpopulation is one reason China does this, but dont kid yourself- the money they make from baby girls is astronomical.|`|jHZqOuVEaa	A few reasons:<br>  <br>  It is a reaction to the trend toward open adoption in America.  China is far, far away and their chances of ever having to deal with "birth mama drama" (yes, I actually saw that posted on an adoptive parent's forum) is nil to zero.<br>  <br>  And I agree with other answers, if they can't get a white infant, a cute "China Doll" is second best for Americans who are afraid of people of African descent.<br>  <br>  Because China is open to adoptions.  A lot of countries have closed their doors to foreign adoptions because they do not want their citizens to be stripped of their identity and culture.

SWOeg0jFaa	Harry Potter all of the way.<br>  I read Twilight and I enjoyed it but it wasn't that great.<br>  I was a sappy, romantic story which is why lots of teen girls love it but in reality it wasn't written well and it wasn't that innovative. The movie plain out just sucked.<br>  Harry Potter is written really well and it's interesting. Plus the movies were good too.|`|0OtwboKfaa	Hmm.<br>  I like both...A Lot.<br>  Twilight - Because i love LOVE! :)<br>  Harry Potter - I LOVVEEE action and magic, too!<br>  <br>  I would have to say Harry Potter, because even though im not a wizard or anything, I relate to iy more, because there more of my age and they have crushes and stuff:)<br>  And Harry Potter, goes through there life.|`|nzyOCsOiaa	Harry Potter and Twilight are two very different story lines.<br>  I like Twilight because they showcase all the characters emotions well and I like Harry Potter because it's really just more exciting.<br>  But they are very different from each other.<br>  I can't really compare them, but Harry Potter is better written.|`|9b8WXwTXaa	I would have to say that I like Twilight better than Harry Potter.

Harry Potter explores more of the Science Fiction genre with the magic and wizardry.<br>  <br>  Twilight is more of a book for people who want more impulsive romance. Along with some of the fantasy genre, not too much though...<br>  <br>  Also if you want to cheat on Harry Potter you can watch the movie.<br>  <br>  I liked the Twilight Saga better though. Book 4 is the best...|`|ajbMVt8maa	they are not really comparable because they are two different types of stories.<br>  harry potter is all fantasy... witchcraft and flying brooms. it's a great story and i've read all 7 books.<br>  twilight is somewhat "emo" and gothic... vampires (vegetarian as they may be) and heartbreak. they are great stories as well, but i am only about 1/4 of the way through the 2nd book :)|`|xSJAT84Taa	TWILIGHT...... seriously its an obsession, u get hooked and cant put the book down, the movies are so good and its so unpredictatble TWILIGHT TWILIGHT TWILIGHT!!!|`|YWUVRrMMaa	I haven't read twilight or seen the movie however I am a big Harry Potter fan.

Twilight is a good story(are you talking about books or movies?),but I like harry potter better. I'm not really sure why exactly,I just do =)|`|oj1TszL2aa	Personally, I'm not a huge fan of either, but I suppose for this question I'll have to choose one way or the other. <br>  <br>  Generally it depends on my mood at the time, if I want to read romance then I'll go for 'Twilight', but the rest of the time I tend to prefer 'Harry Potter'. I wouldn't say that 'Harry Potter' is necessarily any better written, but it does have the advantage of exploring a more imaginative world than the 'Twilight' series, because let's face it, apart from the inclusion of vampires and werewolves, 'Twilight' is pretty much set in present day America, whilst 'Harry Potter' has a whole parallel universe that the author has had to create. I also prefer the progression throughout the 'Harry Potter' series, the suspense builds, and whilst there was a lot of speculation about what would happen in the final book, J.K. Rowling managed to surprise most of her readers by creating twists and turns in the plot. 'Breaking Dawn' on the other hand (the final part of the 'Twilight' series) reads like badly written teenage fan-fiction - very predictable and it really doesn't seem to fit with the other three books in terms of style. <br>  <br>  I can't imagine that either of these books will be popular in 10-20 years time, in all honesty, but it will be interesting to see. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.<br>  x|`|iZk9jEBpaa	I like Harry potter because it's more interesting and has the cliffhanger effect plus there are more films than just one but i like Twilight too.|`|X9JSlC6Iaa	Neither they both suck.

X|`|lJ5Ao2aIaa	I guess what you're describing is called the Whooping Cough :)<br>  Whooping cough, also known as pertussis, is a bacterial infection that inflames the lungs and airways. The pertussis bacteria also set up shop in the windpipe, where they bring on a persistent, violent cough.<br>  <br>  Whooping cough often starts with cold or flulike symptoms — sneezing, runny nose, and a mild cough, which may last up to two weeks before the more severe coughing spells begin. If your baby has whooping cough, she may also have diarrhea or a fever.<br>  <br>  A baby with whooping cough will typically cough for 20 or 30 seconds nonstop and then struggle to breathe before the next coughing spell starts. During coughing episodes, which seem to happen more often at night, your baby's lips and nails may turn bluish from lack of oxygen. Her cough may produce a thick mucus. She may also vomit.<br>  <br>  The doctor will listen to your baby's cough, and perhaps swab her nose to test the cells for the pertussis bacteria. If the doctor suspects that your baby has whooping cough, he won't wait for test results, though, as these can take some time. He'll go ahead and give her an antibiotic to fight the infection right away.<br>  <br>  Antibiotics can help relieve symptoms if given very early on. If given later, they may not shorten the course of the illness, though they can still remove the bacteria from your child's secretions, preventing her from spreading the infection to others. Beyond that, you can't do much besides wait for the cough to subside, which typically takes six to ten weeks.<br>  <br>  Don't give your baby a cough suppressant unless your doctor recommends it. Coughing is the body's natural reaction when it needs to clear the lungs of mucus. If you suppress that reaction, you may be hindering your baby's ability to heal.<br>  <br>  Of course, if the cough gets worse even with antibiotics, call your doctor immediately. In serious cases, kids have to be hospitalized, put on oxygen, and given intravenous fluids to avoid dehydration.

E7MgO2pZaa	Well you really haven't been specific with details, but here goes nothing:<br>  <br>  - Did you willingly surrender your children for adoption or were they taken from you by the state?<br>  <br>  If they were taken from you by the state it will be more difficult to get them back. I would suggest getting a lawyer and having the lawyer advise you on what to do next. If you can't afford a lawyer, you can try legal aid, which provides legal services to people who can't afford them. Just google Legal Aid and your location. Resources should come up in the search.<br>  <br>  If your kids were taken from you, prepare for a fight. Prepare to show the court that you have your life in order enough to care for your children properly. Document any help you have recieved as far as therapy or rehabilitation and have proof that you are employed and have a way to care for your children when you are at work. I really don't think you can go overboard in trying to show the courts you are ready to parent your children. Good for you for getting your act together and trying to parent. Good luck to you.|`|DXh2BlCraa	In some cases, a birth parent can indeed stop an adoption from happening. Whether or not it is possible for a birth parent to stop an adoption from happening depends on a great many factors, including whether the parental rights have been revoked by a court, whether the adoption has been finalized, whether the baby has been born, and whether legal paternity has been established.<br>  <br>  If a woman agrees to voluntarily give up her child for adoption, for example, she can stop the adoption from happening right up until and for at least a short time after the baby is born. The amount of time that she will have to change her mind will vary, but it may be as little as a few days, or as long as a couple of months or more. You should be certain that you are aware of what the regulations in your state are in terms of the birth mom changing her mind, as the time can vary greatly. Some insurance companies even offer adoption insurance to potential adoptive parents, so that they can recoup some of their expenses if this occurs.<br>  <br>  If the birth parents have had their rights revoked in a court, they cannot stop an adoption from happening. At that point, they don’t have any rights over the child whatsoever. To stop an adoption from happening, a birth parent would need to fight the court’s wish to take away her parental rights, and would have to keep from voluntarily relinquishing those rights.|`|7JEojMgQaa	There isn't enough info to go on.

Or did you decide to give them up and change your mind? <br>  If they were taken, I have some insight that may help you. My daughter was in foster care for 15 months. DFCS filed to terminate my rights to her and were in the process of filing for the foster parents to adopt her. I had made many mistakes for a long time. I found a long-term (12 month) residential treatment program that allows children to live with their mothers after the Ministry feels that the mother has progressed enough in her sobriety. I fought DFCS, and didn't give up. Let me tell you, that termination hearing was probably the hardest thing I have ever been through but sooooooo worth it. The judge had every right by law to terminate my rights, but she decided to give me another (yes another) chance. After being in the program for 6 months, my daughter came to live with me. The program taught me how to be a mom ( something that I needed to learn) and taught me how to be the best parent for my daughter. They did way more than just teach me how to remain sober. I learned about healthy relationships, setting boundaries with people, and how to function day to day and also how to help my daughter cope with what I put her through. It is a daily struggle, but I have to face the pain I have caused her and at the same time help her process and deal with that pain. So, I dont know how to help you except to tell you that if your children were taken, do everything CPS or DFCS tells you to do, work your case plan, and your kids will come home. DFCS must also help you work your case plan, so if you need help, ask them. Be honest with them, don't lie b/c it will only hurt you and your kids in the end. You can check out the program I went to by going on their website. It really changed my life and my daughter's.  Good Luck and I will pray for you and your kids....|`|OQnRP6xVaa	Everything depends on the Case Plan. How long it has been, and how far it has gone. The federal government has guidelines now, and the states are required to make a permanent placement plan for children if they are in foster care 16 months out of 24.  <br>  <br>  It doesn't always happen this way, sometimes it's faster (for our children it was less then a year) and sometimes it takes longer. The difference is "if and how" the biological parent and relatives are doing with their Case Plan or home study. <br>  <br>  It depends on if the Parental Rights have been Terminated. If the state has conducted a relative search and if the children's CASE plan has been changed to "Pre-Adoptive"? <br>  <br>  The correct way to handle it is When your children are taken into foster care do whatever it takes to follow the case plan, exactly and without messing up. From the moment the child or children are taken into care it is a legal process and the majority of people facing this situation follow the plan and their children are returned or moved quickly to a stable and open family member. The vast majority of families do have their children reunited from foster care. Yes, there are mistakes, injustices and exceptions.<br>  <br>  When the biological parents do not follow the case plan and show a series of indicators they are not going to be able to provide a safe and secure home then the legal process continues to move forward. Foster Care is no place to spend your whole childhood growing up, and the focus for the past decade has been to prevent this from happening. <br>  <br>  Missed visits, no shows in Court, No Shows for drug testing, skipping meetings, and not working to demonstrate the steps are being taken to provide you children with a safe environment leaves the state few options then to move forward with permanent plans. The older the children are when things are finally resolved and the longer they are in limbo of temporary Foster Care the more difficult it will be to keep them together and with one family until adulthood. <br>  <br>  At this time your question doesn't offer enough information for anyone to really advise you. The mistakes in the Past could be something you are talking about that led up to the children being placed in Foster Care or to the fact that you have made mistakes since they have been In Foster Care. This would be the most important information anyone answering we need to know--in order to offer you any valuable advice.<br>  <br>  I hope that things will come together for you and will keep you in my thoughts and prayers...<br>  *
4Uuehq2Faa	I've been told that when your pregnant you should not take any anti depressents, if you are still taking them, it can cause the fetus harm, and might be causing the symptoms for you,.you should not take medication unless its required during pregnancy for the fetus or for infection e.g urine infection<br>  <br>  Just giving you my advice.
jBdvUQEXaa	I am so sorry to hear about your cat, people without pets dont realise quite how much they mean to you.<br>  <br>  However, please dont worry that your upset will affect your baby, he is snug and warm and unaware of anything. Also, postnatal or postpartum depression is something far different from unhappiness - even extreme unhappiness. I am sure that you will be ok. <br>  <br>  Try talking to your GP see if perhaps a little counselling might help? Failing that - talk to a close friend, get all your feelings off your chest and you might start to feel al little better.<br>  <br>  All the best<br>  Clare|`|n9hPQhbOaa	sorry to hear that :(<br>  <br>  No it is not. A fetus or baby does respond to your emotions but they do not harm the fetus or baby. Some studies have shown that more emotional women give birth to more intellectual children.|`|EVsihGjpaa	Well i am 20 weeks pregnant and im only 15..<br>  BUT my mom says that is is bad to cry when ur<br>  prego..

As far as postpartum depression, hard to say.  You may do fine.  Once your baby is here it will be a good distraction for you.  Help take your mind off of your cat.  I am sorry to hear about your loss.  But, try and focus on your upcoming delivery and new joy!  Good luck|`|KuXNYqa3aa	no. and try to move on. it is dead. it cant suffer. life goes on.<br>  good luck and my condolences.|`|CcgDj9GIaa	I'm very sorry for your loss;  My condolence goes out to you.<br>  <br>  You are at a very high risk of postpartum depression not just because of the loss, but because of the other factors that will pile on to it when the child is born.  The responsibility you carry for this child PLUS having to deal with a pet that was so near and dear to you Is what can definitely trigger postpartum depression.  You're doing the right thing in talking to your doctor about this.  He/She can advise you to see a psychiatrist about this, trust me they work wonders and are really there and sympathetic to listen to your feelings.  Your doctor will also prescribe to you anti-depressants to help you cope with your overwhelming emotions.  You may be for or against this method before giving birth, but I will advise that you take anti-depressants after birth as soon as possible.  This will help you feel better and help you deal with your situation in a clear-headed manner and help you heal progressively. <br>  <br>  Take care hon;  I do hope you feel better and congrats on your new sweet little bundle of joy! :]|`|EsGrIscFaa	You are grieving and that's no fun at any time, let alone when you're full term. You baby won't know what's going on and I would be more focused on dealing with your grief before the baby arrives.  The only way I would think it would cause postpartum depression is if you blamed the baby for you cat's death, which it doesn't sound like you do.  It's horrible losing someone you love and unfortunately it'll just take some time to get over, but try to be comforted by the lovely baby you'll soon be holding in your arms. x|`|OyBuEpOTaa	I'm so sorry to hear of your loss of such a sweet creature. <br>  <br>  I don't think you're hurting the baby. however if you think that you may carry your grief over and have a worse post partum depression, than I say 'mother knows best' .  grieve as you must, and it will pass. If you repress your feelings it is worse.<br>  <br>   I understand how you feel about the kitty. I had one that behaved the very same way. Even when I was running to the bathroom every few minutes, he would follow me and wait for me and follow me back to bed. he did this all night every night. remembering him doing that helped me to deal with the loss. i will always remember him. It was 35 years ago.
stRWElvPaa	It can take up to 12 months to conceive for a normal healthy couple, and if you're in your mid 30's it can take even longer. <br>    If you haven't conceived after 12 months of trying usually the doctors will start to investigate. hope this helps.|`|xjRCdRnxaa	Your Q doesnt quite read well . .  .!<br>  Not sure what the bottom half meant or how long ou been trying, but regular sex and patience, i been trying over a yr now!!!<br>  Sadly, it doesnt always just happen!

IRFbj0G9aa	Don't give up, and I can understand your worries.  I don't have any experience with this issue I can only say what I would do as a parent and try to imagine myself in your shoes.  From the way you describe things you are from either the UK or the U.S.?  At least I hope you are from there or a country like that, cause I am sure you will have more options there.  Perhaps his learning disabilities will not hold him back, just ensure that you utilize all the options available to you.  Do some research on your own, this is even a form of research, you never know what someone could inform you with.  Just writing to give you a boost, you should be proud of yourself for loving and supporting your child the way you have and for being concerned.  Draw all the strength you can and fight on,  with a mom like you next to him you never know what wonderful things lie ahead for this angel.|`|AA10949447	sometimes it helps to have a child his age come and do homework with him.My daughter learned faster from her friend then her teacher.Each child has their own unique way that helps them learn.You have tv shows like Seasame street,reading rainbow,etc.You can try getting a tutor.Your son will sill live a normal life.go to a store and buy those little computers for kids that help with math,reading,etc you can help him or let him work it by his self.Sometimes the teachers just don't take the time out.When I was in school the teacher would move on and give a child that is behind special attention  with their work .Now if you don't know it the teachers move on and won't take the time to help.If you have time try to go to the school and sit with him from a few minutes or longer to help him with his work.This is how my son caught on and he got his confidence back.|`|EsGrIscFaa	He may find somethings difficult but it is important that you encourage him to focus on the things he loves. If he likes maths then maybe he'll be a mathematician! How is he with computers? He may find it easier to work with something less human. <br>  Also, if you want to improve his reading try a reading recovery programme called 'Toe-by-Toe'. I used to do this with dyslexic children with VERY low reading ages (age 14 with r.age of 6 years old) in a secondary school I worked in and it helped them so much. You can buy the books online and all the instructions are on the pages as you go through telling you how to teach him - link to buy the book is below.|`|SiIuJXvwaa	hi <br>  i really feel for you my son has Augsburg's and has similar problems. he is very cleaver put cant interact with people. has an IQ off the wall but has no concentration at all. i was told because he has loads of energy to do as much activities with him to tire him out but low and behold it doesn't work. at the moment he thinks he is peter parker ( spider-man ) we have to keep all eyes on him because he climbs up drains, up 6 foot walls and feels no pain when he falls. i was told it was something he will have for his life but with any problem will learn when he is older and understands it he will be able to control it but right now i cant and don't sleep for fear of him hurting himself. im not sure what i can say to you , but maybe hearing someone Else's problem might make you feel a bit better knowning your not the only mother that goes through it alone that your not in the dark with it. mabe if you have a chat to a concellor they might be able to take some weight off your shoulders for you      good luck hun if you want to talk about anything please do ok xxxx|`|wsOjj9qJaa	It sounds to me as if he has the same spectrum of difficulties as my 13 yr old daughter(dyslexia,dyspraxia and mild autistism) She finds it hard to cope with the silliness of people her own age but is learning. When she left middle school for secondary school she was 5 years behind her vocab understanding age in writing and spelling.We all have to support her as a family but often have to step back to make her deal with everyday situations. All you can do is support your son emotionally and put hard work into finding all the help he needs academically and socially.Good luck for the fights ahead.|`|G9ywiLqvaa	while i understand your concern (and i can totally relate as i have a 7-year old with a reading learning disability), please know that if there's anyone who should be positive and strong for your son --it's you.  <br>  this is what i keep reminding myself. :)<br>  sure, progress is slow.  but it is still happening.  and you'd be surprised at the possible boost of confidence and accomplishment your child can have with enough positive reinforcements from his parents.<br>  i wouldn't worry about his future.  he has a long way to go but he will get there.  sure, he'll still have difficulties every now and then.  but as you say, he is clever in math.  he has a strength.  and as long as a person has a strength, he has a future.<br>  be strong, mom.  and hopeful.  for the sake of your boy. :)|`|QnJvJ67uaa	There is so much emphasis on academic success nowadays that anyone who falls below the mainstream standard is seen as a right off. It sounds as though your son has many talents already but if I was worried I would first of all call a meeting with his education providers. Maybe you would feel happier if more emphasis was put on "life skills" rather than putting too much pressure on him to read fluently and write correctly all the time. Also at 10 he is still young enough to improve vastly. My eldest son is 9 and was very behind with his reading and maths ( he is being tested for dyscalculia and dyslexia), but he has many other skills, his art is as good as most secondary school kids, his computer skills are above average, he loves his sports and has beautiful handwriting. His reading has improved a lot and he is now reading alone for pleasure, but I spent 4 years stocking his shelves with books he did not touch and reading with him until one day he discovered how much FUN it was to pick up a book himself.<br>  Concentrate on your sons skills, make a big deal about them, never stop telling him how smart he is. All you can do is equip him for adulthood as best you can, confidence can get a young person a very long way.<br>  Good luck :) x|`|XENd8mNhaa	My answer is tell your son he must concentrate harder than the average child.Because he gets distracted easily and you do want him to be playing catch up throughout life.|`|oBCSaejKaa	i think u shouldnt worry about it.<br>  <br>  i couldn't read properly till grade 3. <br>  <br>  i was a really dumb kid and didnt 'blossom' into the wonderful student i am till high school.|`|KXd5gc0eaa	i used to be dumb too.

1z3C0R2Vaa	there is no safe period so better try and use the pill Good luck......)|`|kaqPSgTVaa	There is no such thing as a safe time to have unprotected sex. Women ovulate at varying times each month, usually not on the same day. Also on rare occasions women can ovulate even on their period. Sperm lives in her body for 72 hours so man up and wear a condom. It's the only way to go. Sorry.|`|Ea6TnOuOaa	I fully subscribe and endorse to answerer No.1 Due August.  There is nothing as safe as having sex with condom because it is a tangible safety precaution.  There are contraceptives like for insertion into vagina before the game.  Even there comes oral tablet which also averts unwanted pregnancy.  Or if your man can go in for operation, i don't what is it called in medical term, but in which his testicles are castrated and he is then no more capable or impregnating a woman.  So eliminate the danger of being impregnated by him and enjoy the sex with him to the hilt.|`|b8f0CfSsaa	There isn't such thing as a safe period in which to have sex. The method you are talking about is the 'Rhythm Method'. It is highly unreliable as it works around you avoiding having sex on the days you ovulate, so if you ovulate early or late you may become pregnant. Sperm can live for 3-7 days (usually 3) depending on how sperm friendly your cervix is, so you run a high risk of harbouring sperm ready for when your egg is released.<br>  <br>  Look in to the condom thing again, or try a femdom. You should also look at making the pill an option.|`|eZ9duvtwaa	DONT TAKE TENTION <br>  <br>  AFTER SEX  USE I PILL  TABLETS|`|dIN0FQWcaa	Your hubby should take outside his tool before ejaculation..but in this case it is slightly risky...|`|ujoT9zSwaa	Hi, I have read the answer of other members and all of them advised not follow rhythm method.

At my initial stage I used condom but being bored by condom I started to follow Rhythm Method and am fine. Till today I am in this process. And never faced any accident For this you have to very cautious about your period. First and only last, observe your period cycle. Is it regular?

ibg67Xtvaa	Like many women, if you're trying to conceive a baby you've looked for trying to conceive baby tips before. From basal thermometers to ovulation predictor kits to cervical mucus, many so-called "conceive baby tips" can get confusing pretty quickly. While many of these conception tips work great in theory, couples who are trying to conceive baby following strict "conceive baby tips" are more likely to be disappointed in babymaking sex. Whether you're officially trying to conceive baby or just planning ahead, these essential “conceive baby tips” will help maximize your chances for naturally conceiving and delivering a healthy baby. <br>  1. Stop using birth control. Seems obvious, but some forms of birth control have more lasting effects than others. According to the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, if you're taking birth control pills, continue to the end of your current cycle before stopping the pills, then start trying the next month (some doctors recommend waiting an additional month or more — check with your gynecologist). Makers of Norplant say that the contraceptive sticks wear off three days after they are removed, while the manufacturers of Depo-Provera claim it takes 12 weeks for the progestin (contraceptive hormone) to leave your body. If you use condoms, a cervical cap, or a diaphragm, all you need to do is put them away.<br>  <br>  2. See a doctor. Blood pressure, weight, chronic conditions such as diabetes, and many other factors can affect your ability to carry and deliver a healthy baby, according to the Mayo Clinic Complete Book of Pregnancy and Baby's First Year (William Morrow & Co., 1994). If you have health issues of any kind, address them with your doctor now.<br>  <br>  3. Eat right. That means a balanced diet complete with protein, fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, and a minimum of sweets and fats, recommends the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).<br>  <br>  4. Take folic acid. Folic acid is a synthetic form of folate, a B vitamin that can help reduce the risk of serious birth defects that affect the brain and spinal cord. These defects can occur in the fetus even before the mother knows she is pregnant. For this reason, the FDA recommends that all women of childbearing age take folic acid supplements.<br>  <br>  5. Quit smoking, drinking, and drugs. A great deal has been written about the effects of nicotine, drugs, and alcohol on the unborn fetus. What's less well known is that these substances can affect male fertility, too, causing chromosomal damage, decrease in motility (the swimming rate of the sperm), and erectile dysfunction, say Leslie Schover and Anthony Thomas in Overcoming Male Infertility (John Wiley & Sons, 2000).<br>  <br>  6. Know your cycle. General wisdom has it that your most fertile time is the fourteenth day after you get your period. But in fact, ovulation occurs on the fourteenth day before your period begins, if you're not pregnant, says Toni Weschler in Taking Charge of Your Fertility (HarperPerennial Library, 1995). If your cycle is 28 days long, that makes day 14 (counting from the first day of your last period) your most fertile day. But if you have a 30-day cycle, day 16 is the most fertile, and 32-dayers should go for it on day 18.<br>  <br>  7. Chart your basal body temperature. According to Taking Charge of Your Fertility author Toni Weschler, a basal thermometer (about $10 at most drugstores) can help you determine when you're at your most fertile.<br>  <br>  8. Look out for mucus. When ovulation occurs, your body produces a slippery, thin substance called cervical mucus to help facilitate the passage of sperm. If you examine yourself daily, says Weschler, you'll notice a vaginal discharge that's transparent and stretchy between your fingers, like egg white, on your most fertile days.<br>  <br>  9. Tell your man to play it cool — and loose. Loose pants and underwear, that is. According to Schover and Thomas, sperm count drops — sometimes drastically — when the testicles are constricted or overheated. Tell your partner to avoid hot tubs, saunas, and hundred-mile runs (hot showers and moderate exercise are okay).<br>  <br>  10. Have sex the "old-fashioned" way. Those missionaries had a lot of kids! Anything that helps gravity direct your partner's semen toward your uterus — man on top, doggy style, side-by-side — is okay, says Christopher D. Williams, MD, author of The Fastest Way to Get Pregnant Naturally (Hyperion, 2001). Avoid woman on top, standing, or leaning positions, which discourage the flow of semen to the uterus.<br>  <br>  The information on this Web site is designed for educational purposes only.

CuTvFlxTaa	Don't give in to her cries..Extremely hard I know. Also put a nighty of yours on the mattress where she lies so that she has your smell near her. Try controlled crying. Each night put her down in the same way but move further and further away from her cot until your finally out the room. It takes about 5 nights or more to get this right. When you go back to her don't speak just put her back down to sleep. The less talking you do and the less comforting will benefit you in the long run. Eventually she will learn that when she cries you wont pick her up. Its hard but unless you persevere you will end up back with her in your room.|`|VUo09gpuaa	It will be tough but you have to put up with the crying.<br>  Might help if you stay in the room with her till she sleeps but never pick up or talk to her.|`|lJztPGEjaa	does she have nap in the day if so try putting her down for her nap in her rom and not yours so that she gets used to the room apart from that it is basically puting up with the crying my sister was terrible and had to have the feel of sum1s skin on her before shed go to sleep so we had to stay there with her for hours|`|lJ5Ao2aIaa	To ease the move, there are a number of different strategies that you can try. One first step is to have your toddler get used to sleeping in his crib during naptime. You can also gradually make the transition by first sleeping with him in his own room. Expect some protests about this new sleeping spot, but rest assured that having you nearby will ease the transition. Finally, you can start with just bedtime, having your toddler fall asleep on his own in his own room but bringing him into your bed when he awakens at night. After a couple of weeks, you can take the final step to having him sleep in his own room all night.<br>  <br>  Give your toddler plenty of comfort while he makes this transition. Once he's finally settled in his own room all night, don't bring your toddler back to your bed — this will only confuse him and send the message that he'll be rewarded if he cries long and hard enough.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps :)

r0ISrLc1aa	yes!! haha I am actually doing a bio proj on that right now!! your hands should be 1/10 of your total height, give or take a few inches|`|tVB1kbFIaa	yes, your hands will grow faster than the rest of your body, but your body often catches up. take a look at your mother and fathers hand to height ratio for a more accurate prediction.|`|RALpRu54aa	This does have a lot to do with height. While you are growing, the extremes of the body, the hands and feet grow first, followed by legs arms and skull, followed at last by the backbone. That's why so many teenagers seem to be irregularly proportioned and clumsy.|`|gxAgyENRaa	ya this may mean that cos when you stretch ur arms the total length of ur arms in that position is said to be ur total height<br>  <br>  answer mine also<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090305031139AAHhI3z">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>
VWyW8tJXaa	I'm 14 weeks and I have those pains also. Mainly on one side...but my doc told me my body was just adjusting to make room for baby! :) No worries.|`|pwu9xzF8aa	most likely ligament pain.<br>  you baby is growing, and needing to turn that smaller space into a larger comfy home for the time being- as its not comfortable for us!!<br>  if the pain becomes severe and is keeping you awake, then go to the ER, but other than that it is most likely just some growing pains.|`|t2x7Cr6Gaa	I'm not too sure put i would go and see you GP just to be sure... Don't worry your self or you'll get more uncomfortable. Just go see your GP and clear your mind. Hope this helps and hope you feel better soon|`|XlPuguBAaa	without sounding rude... are u constipated cos i have been for the last few days and I am having the same pains..
Yc6eUIW9aa	Anytime you feel like it.<br>  ..|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	I'd start now. There will be lots of winter type stuff on clearance you can stock up on for the winter to come, which is great! You can get a lot for your money. Key point to remember: buy a bunch of different sizes. At 6 months he may not be in 6 months clothes...he might be in 12 month sizes for all you know so buy a variety. <br>  <br>  I was 6 months pregnant this time last year...::sigh::: how time flies.|`|U3prt8tlaa	The best thing to do is buy stuff you need when it's on sale.|`|5ZvALiclaa	oh goodness, i had most of what i needed by now with all three of my kids or had already researched and scoured for the things I was still to get.<br>  <br>  I couldn't wait to start buying up all the things for my babies. It turns out to be a lot of stuff so the earlier you start and the more you spread it out the easier it is financially. <br>  <br>  I wouldn't hold back,...go, hunt, buy!!! You'll have so much fun doing it!!<br>  But remember to bargain hunt for specials and sales and compare prices between stores on the big ticket items, you'll be amazed at how much you can save<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|B5MDTdtPaa	i bought it bit by bit from the 5 month scan until when she was born...id definatel start now as the costs are alot - i bought lke cot one month, travel system/stroller/car seat the next, a load of clothes the next etc etc|`|sgMno1PRaa	When ever you like! We started buying stuff really early!!<br>  You will probably want everything sorted and organised by the time your 8-8 1/2 months as you might just want to rest then and wait for baby to come!|`|0UjFOsHkaa	anytime now. you don't want to wait til the last minute, so I'd say start at least getting some things now. Congrats and I hope you have a health baby boy|`|b70c76c680f23b7b2d94815940d49450aa	Congratulations, you're not far behind me!<br>  <br>  I have 9 weeks left of pregnancy and have so far bought a changing table, pushchair, car seat, some clothes (we don't know the sex of the baby). We were put off by so many friends and family members to buy things too early on mainly because of superstitions...even bringing the pushchair into the house is considered bad luck.<br>  <br>  However I'd like to be prepared and organised ready for our littluns arrival so I've bitten the bullet, discarded other peoples interferring and begun to order all the other remaining necessities. I'm planning to have everything in place one month before the due date just incase the baby decides to arrive early.<br>  <br>  Plus, leaving it too late and you could risk receiving damaged or faulty items which need to be returned and might not arrive before your LO does! It's good to get the hang of fitting your car seat and erecting/collapsing your pushchair etc before you start getting too big!<br>  <br>  EDIT: Why the thumbs down?|`|AsCXR2Zoaa	I think its all up to you. I prepared the babies room when I am on my 5th month of pregnancy, I also a boy. Me and my husband were spending some nights sleeping on the babies room. I brought my babies furniture from foreveredwood and have it painted with blue white.|`|TB8Lrd9Waa	hello...i say now is a good time to start.....its never too early... .congratulations on your boy...i have just had my wee boy 4 weeks ago .. its wonderful. ..|`|ybexjS2Paa	I started buying things for my kids when I was about 7-8 months pregnant. Do it whenever you feel you are ready :)
0UjFOsHkaa	you need to call your doctor ASAP and ask him/her this.|`|d89qNyb6aa	Carry on taking the rest of the pack ( your period should stop) then have the normal weeks break before starting your next pack.<br>  Are you SURE you didn't miss 1 or 2?<br>  I can't understand why your period started while you're still taking the pill.<br>  Maybe check with the Dr to see if this type of pill's right for you.|`|wsOjj9qJaa	All I can suggest is that you go to talk to your practise nurse to talk about this. i haven't been on the pill for so long now I really wouldn't be any help. Get an appointment today or tomorrow if possible. if not, try your local family planning clinic. The number should be in your local phone book.|`|b8f0CfSsaa	It doesn't sound as though you would be pregnant. You need to talk to your doctor, it could be that your body isn't liking Microgynon 30 anymore and you may need to try an alternative form of contraception.|`|XlPuguBAaa	Just carry on taking your pill as normal...  Sometimes your cycle will just mess itself up but as long as u stick to taking your pill as u normally would it should sort itself out again in a few months|`|lJ5Ao2aIaa	You'll usually get your period two to three days after taking your last active pill. Women on birth control pills often have shorter, lighter periods — some have no more than one day of scant bleeding. And some occasionally skip their period altogether for a cycle.<br>  <br>  If this happens to you and you've taken your pills exactly as prescribed (starting each pack on time and not missing any pills) and have no other signs of pregnancy, don't worry. Just continue taking your pills on schedule. It's highly unlikely that you're pregnant, but if you're worried you can take a home pregnancy test for reassurance.<br>  <br>  However, if you miss two periods in a row with perfect Pill use or you miss a single period when you haven't taken your pills consistently, then call your caregiver so she can make sure you're not pregnant before you start your next pack.<br>  <br>  And, of course, use another method of birth control in the meantime. But don't panic if you took some pills before suspecting that you were pregnant. There's no evidence that birth control pills can harm a developing baby.|`|nxOWfQP1aa	what do u mean retake after ur period? do u take the pill on the day u period? if yes,better u stop to take it because u don't need it if u period now.  but,if u not take it on ur period day, u just take it as usual. dont be worry..  maybe ur period cycle is not normal.|`|Gb6fHGTDaa	Go to the doctor, the pill can just mess with ur period a lot so it's probably nothing, but it could be something else making u bleed.
Gb6fHGTDaa	taking it more then 4 times can damage your "lady parts", you probably can still have a child one day. but don't take it again! not for a while anyway...|`|f66ce5d864eadcad29348fd4a9871771aa	youre probably still ok, stop having unprotected sex and it wont b an issue, its not that hard to use birth control.<br>  <br>  <br>  p2...plan 2 ....the "morning after" pill.|`|hcwp2mAyaa	what is p2? and what u mean more than 4 times in a month?|`|TB8Lrd9Waa	WHATS P2???. . . CONFUSED . .. .
LTD0qL6Yaa	You could be pregnant, you have done all the right things on the right days (if you get what i mean). I was testing everyday from 7 DPO and even though i really thought i was pregnant every test i did was negative. That was until 2 days after my period was due @ 16 DPO. I am now 6 weeks + 5 days with my 5th pregnancy. I send you much baby dust, good luck..|`|9bz6EpoLaa	I'd do an at-home test. Evn a day b4 your period, it could tell u.
z5JkgFOyaa	From what I have read and researched, the only real difference between the two is timing of the cramps. Generally period cramps begin just a day or so before your expected period. But if you were to feel implantation cramps, it would happen around 6-12 days after ovulation (conception).<br>  <br>  Bear in mind that not everyone feels cramps at implantation. <br>  <br>  Since you were at the day before your period was due, you should be able to do a pregnancy test now to see whether it's positive.  If it is negative and you don't get your period in a weeks time, I would recommend another pregnancy test as sometimes it can be too early to tell.<br>  <br>  Good luck :)
LTD0qL6Yaa	I'M sure you can as i have had implantation spotting but no cramps. Good luck..
oiJITSNZaa	While some people have implantation bleeding more often most people don't
4Uuehq2Faa	Nora is right!<br>  from the age of 11-20 i had regular periods thenI was very irregular with my periods from 20-23 as i have PCOS, last year i missed a period for 10 months! <br>  <br>  before that it was just every 3 months, but 10 months is a long time! then in October last year they became regular again exactly 28 days! for oct and nov, then i fell pregnant in December, <br>  <br>  im now 12 weeks and very excited, so its all about the right timing, when you can figure out your ovulating and most of the time, when your regular, so get checked out by your doctor to find out the cause :)|`|B1lNqtA3aa	Wow I'm having the same exact question, I hope you get the answer!|`|R60sy5yYaa	Nobody can say for sure. The miscarriage rate is around 25%, but it's been speculated that it's actually a lot higher because women will miscarry before they even realize they're pregnant. If that's true it's also a lot easier to get pregnant, but most of the time the baby doesn't even get a chance to implant.<br>  <br>  Scary thought. I'd just chalk it up to your hormones being weird.|`|jBdvUQEXaa	Could be, or perhaps it was just a co-incidence. Perhaps now your hormones have settled into a regular rythym. Bear in mind that now your body is into a rythym, that you are more likely to be ovulating and therefore should you choose not to be celibate any more you may find you catch quite easily.<br>  <br>  Claire|`|eWEqGHvJaa	it is possible that now that your periods are regular that you will be just as able to get pregnant as before. I would use protection at all times.  I was irregular and did not get pregnant until I was regular.  Then I had a son.  Good luck and keep the faith.
aVqfgQZkaa	The average woman has a menstrual cycle of 28 days, so if you know when your period before your last was, you can always count how long it's been up until now.  There really isn't a sure way to tell if you're pregnant without a test this soon in the game.  I would really just suck it up and take a test.  The disappointment of not being pregnant will probably be better than the stress of wondering.  Plus, if you are pregnant you'll want to start taking action and planning immediately!  The first trimester can often be the most risky so if you want a baby so badly, you'll want to know A.S.A.P. so you can do everything you can to keep your baby as healthy as possible!  Good luck.|`|buI2TVpvaa	I  knw what u are passing through, I missed my period the whole of February I was very sure I was pregnant because I hav a regukar cycle but to my greatest dismay I tested neg through out. I felt so disappointed.And I was told it was caused by a combination of stress and anxiety.If I should miss my period again I know it will take me time to test and more so I wouldnt be fast in tell my husband so that I will bear the diappointment alone should there be any.But who knows u might be preg go for a test and know where u are going from there. Best of lucks.TTC is the worst experience in life as far as am consign is not even something u can wish for an enemy,But God will see us through.|`|TU7vDI95aa	I don't understand.  Are you saying you don't want to waste twenty bucks on a test if you're not pregnant?  You should not be trying to procreate if you can't even afford a pregnancy test.<br>  <br>  I really don't know what you're looking for people to tell you.<br>  <br>  Edited to add:  Okay, well in that case just bite the bullet!  If you're not pregnant, it may be time to go to a fertility clinic and see if there's a problem.  Remember, there are tons of kids that need to be adopted, and if you are meant to have children, it will happen one way or another.|`|KOwzDLPdaa	If you are pregnant you need to do a test to know for sure so you can start getting the medical attention you will need to make sure everything is okay with your baby. <br>  <br>  I know getting negative results sucks, but you need to be on vitamins and seen by a doctor so it is best to find out!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|yilREYWGaa	Hi I wasnt even really 'Trying' this month as I have been so busy with work...

2nfMSDiPaa	Hey hun you sound  like me.Me and hubby are late 20's ttc for nearly 2 years!!I thought I was in Good health then I found out that I got tilted uterus,and highly acidity in vagina,was killing of the sperms!Due to stress you can delay your period....TTC Can Be Soooo Frustrating!!<br>  <br>  Trying to conceive can be stressful for some couples. Things may not be working out as they thought they would and it can be difficult not to feel disappointed, angry, upset or depressed if this is the case.<br>  <br>  Try to maintain your usual life without allowing the trying to conceive process overrun your whole life - this can be difficult for some,someone like (ME)lol.Its easier said then done!<br>  <br>  If you are experiencing a high level of stress then the progesterone needed as part of the vital chain above can be severely affected. It might be converted instead to cortisol (the stress-hormone) and affect the levels and efficiency of the blend of hormones needed to get an egg released, fertilised and safely implanted in the womb.<br>  For more about how this affects conception go to Progesterone and Pregnancy.<br>  <br>  In addition, the pituitary gland may also still be producing too much prolactin. This will also affect the body's ability to produce the hormones essential for conception in the right balanced quantities.<br>  You might well have found that in other times of your life, stress and changes to weight and lifestyle have affected the regularity of your periods; what happens above is just the same - the stress can be a block to successful conception.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this help's I hope you get your BFP this year God Willing!!Billions of baby dust to you!!<br>  <br>  take care|`|dd2vz570aa	There are a view questions you need to ask yourself to work out where you are going wrong. <br>  <br>  1. Are you two actually healthy and fertile?  Have you been checked for fertility - your tubes, ovulation, hormones his sperm count?  Have you seen a fertility doc who has given you the all clear?  You must see a doc and get the checks done, its very important.<br>  <br>  2. Are you really trying properly to get pregant?  Do you check when you ovulate on a monthly basis, you can buy ovulation predictor kits for this.  Do you have sex on the days on and around your ovulation? If you are not monitoring your ovulation pattern you may just be missing it every month. <br>  <br>  Start with them two points and see how you get on.  I tried for 3 years  and am now due in 2 and half weeks.  Goodluck x|`|SiIuJXvwaa	relax sit back and enjoy being with your husband, don't let it take over your life, don't make it be a chore. your worrying about weather your pregnant or not that can delay your periods from coming.so but positive it will happen , when your body is ready in its self     good luck to you both|`|0MwaMLeyaa	i am in the same boat hun.  since i came off the pill last May i have been all over the place i have been waiting nearly two months to have my period (but still having the cramps and that tho).  so i am going to  book a appointment with my GP

AVL2IS7Laa	i miscarried at 9 weeks and 1 day, i noticed abit of blood when i went to the toilet and went to hospital. i had a scan and was told i had started miscarrying my baby. the treated me really bad, like i was overreacting. that i should not be that upset as it was only early and i'm only young and have loads of time to have a baby. but i don't see it like that. it felt so right like the perfect time. me and my fiancee were so happy. it took well over a week for my baby to pass through me and was that pain-full that after 3 days i had to be rushed to hospital for some strong painkillers. to help me get through the next few days. the only kept me in for a few hours. they don't care. i lost mine on the 6/6/2008 and have had no help or support, my fiancee just don't understand what it was like, i don't think people think of it as a baby like we do and that's sad because it was our baby. all i have left is a scan to remember. no other trace that i was carrying a baby for the love of my life. after over half a year i've found it don't get any easy-er. if you would like to talk one to one with me you can email me. maybe we can help each other abit. im really sorry i know how hard it is, if only everyone knew what you were going through.|`|Rxi8wu5Paa	so sorry for your loss my friend went through the same thing but it happened when she was down the country and no were near home you have one blessing that god has givin you so maybe enjoy for a while and then im a few months try again :)<br>  <br>  god bless|`|vCq3dR40aa	I am so sorry to hear of your loss.

oiJITSNZaa	Very important because children can easily pick up when something is amiss and unsettled. They have a very sensitve sense of when something is 'hanging in  the air'.
57LFRfqCaa	What a wonderful sympathetic mother you are - no wonder the poor kid still wets his bed.|`|71fSlHuPaa	Why would you punish your child for having a medical condition he can't control?  I think that is pretty cruel. If a child is still wetting the bed by this age then there is obviously something wrong. Even if he has liquids at night his body should still signal him to get up.

You should be taking him to the doctor because it seems there must be a medical reason for it, or even a psychological reason.  No 13 year old WANTS to be wearing goodnites to bed.

You are going to punish him for a problem he really can't help, have you done anything the last 10 years or so besides berate him and make him feel ashamed about himself.  Have you gone to a doctor, you know some people have a medical condition and cannot help it, but take medication to alleviate it.  And what is up with the diapers?  Did you ever think that perhaps you are to blame.  That when he was a young boy you should of cut the diaper out once and for all, and halled your *** out of bed and cleaned up a few times, or a dozen or a hundred as long as you helped him!  When he had the diaper on at night then when he was a toddler dont you realize that you perhaps you were sending him mixed signals?  For example, day time we do potty in toilet cause I wear underwear.  Night time I wear diaper I do what I always knew .  Perhaps it is psychological.    Did you take him to a doctor to rule out a medical condition.

There is a reason that he wets the bed. He does not do it on purpose. If is your job a s  a parent to find out what is going on with your child. You should have long ago. Some of them are just such heavy sleepers that the urge to go does not wake them up. He should get up in the night to go and his liquid consumption should be limited in the evenings. Making him feel bad for not being a man as you put it is just cruel. He should not be ridiculed by his own parents.

P31J6x2oaa	1. Food cravings. Yes, it's a cliché, but food cravings sometimes can be a sign of pregnancy. Don't rely on them as a sure symptom (it may be all in your head, or even a sign that your body is low on a particular nutrient), but if cravings are accompanied by some of the other symptoms on this list, start counting the days from your last period. <br>  <br>  2. Darkening of your areolas. If the skin around your nipples gets darker, you may have successfully conceived, though this may also signal a hormonal imbalance unrelated to pregnancy or be a leftover effect from a previous pregnancy. <br>  <br>  3. Implantation bleeding or cramping. 3. About eight days after ovulation, you may experience implantation spotting, a slight staining of a pink or brown colour, as well as some cramping. This is caused by the egg burrowing into the endometrial lining. You might also see some spotting around the time you expect your period. <br>  <br>  4. Frequent urination. Once the embryo implants and begins producing the hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), you may find yourself going to the bathroom more often. <br>  <br>  5. Fatigue. Feeling tired? No, make that exhausted. High levels of the hormone progesterone can make you feel as if you've run a marathon when all you've done is put in a day at the office. Fatigue is a hallmark of early pregnancy, though probably not a surefire symptom on its own. <br>  <br>  6. Tender, swollen breasts. If you're pregnant, your breasts will probably become increasingly tender to the touch, similar to the way they feel before your period, only more so. Once your body grows accustomed to the hormone surge, the pain will subside. <br>  <br>  7. Altered sense of taste. You may notice that your sense of taste changes. Some women say they have a metallic taste in their mouth, others that they cannot stand the taste of coffee, tea, or a food they usually like. <br>  <br>  8. Morning sickness. If you're lucky, morning sickness won't hit you until a few weeks after conception. (A lucky few escape it altogether.) But as early as a couple of days following conception, you may begin feeling nauseated and queasy. And not just in the morning, either -- pregnancy-related nausea can be a problem morning, noon, or night. <br>  <br>  9. A missed period. If you're usually pretty regular and your period is late, it's worth trying a pregnancy test. A missed period is the surest sign of pregnancy in a woman of childbearing age who usually has regular periods.|`|32e46f5365de97f08e8132dd292b1761aa	Missing my period<br>  Feeling very very tired<br>  Morning sickness that lasted all day (from eight weeks to about sixteen weeks!!)<br>  Going off coffee, tea, fizzy drinks.|`|6e72fe5eaebe0f66961aa766d452c09faa	missed period but i put that down to having pcos<br>  feeling ssick in mornings but thought i was coming down with a bug<br>  moody but i didnt notice <br>  boobs hurt like hell<br>  <br>  hubby made me take test as he knew i was pregnant|`|0OTV0a4Zaa	i felt like i had a terrible flu, two days after i concieved my boobs started killing me which never happened before. i rushed down to the doctors and had a blood test and i was a week pregnant. <br>  at 8 weeks i had terrible morning sickness until 12 weeks. apart from them and a missed period i didnt really have any other symtoms,until about 15 weeks when i started to feel little kicks.|`|LlVJiVoIaa	hi hun,<br>  my syptoms were:<br>  sore boobs<br>  heartburn<br>  cramping<br>  nausea<br>  headache<br>  dizziness<br>  bad back<br>  weeing loads more<br>  feeling more thirsty than normal!<br>  ive gone off beans and porridge and craving frosties?!?!<br>  <br>  hope this helps good luck!|`|IJD8Vdjdaa	Missed Period, I was 4 weeks late so I thought something was up!<br>  Tired all the time<br>  Really Sore breasts<br>  <br>  <br>  I didn't get nausea untill I was 8 weeks pregnant and even then it wasn't all the time!

I use the Sleepy Time when my little one has terrible gas pains. To keep the fever down try a cool bath or bathe him with a cloth dipped in vinegar. A temp over 102 F should be attended to by a doctor if you cannot get it down.|`|111c1567726b21cf846f2fc4c1754a98aa	If he's irritable and cranky, give him tylenol.

I Hope the little guy feels better soon.|`|lJ5Ao2aIaa	You're the best judge of whether your baby is really ill, so call if you're worried, no matter what his temperature is.<br>  <br>  A temperature reading isn't the only indication of whether a fever is serious. Your baby's age is a factor (fever is more serious in babies under 3 months), as is his behavior (a high fever that doesn't stop him from playing and feeding normally may not be cause for alarm).<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that everyone's temperature rises in the late afternoon and early evening and falls between midnight and early morning. The natural cycle of our internal thermostat explains why doctors get most of their phone calls about fever in the late afternoon and early evening.<br>  <br>  Common guideline for calling a doctor is: for a baby between 3 and 6 months old, call if his temperature reaches 101 degrees F (38.3 degrees C) or higher.<br>  <br>  Don't give him any medicine without asking your doctor :)

cefbd88d09d4432dbf4bd68279e5e426aa	The HCG level almost doubles everyday and there is such a thing as chemical pregnancy so your Dr. probably wants to be really sure before telling you that you are preggo.

Y premialos con halagos cuando hagan algo bien<br>  <br>  2) Si ni asi se portan bien... castigalos con algo que les guste. como ver tele, jugar X o Y, etc.  Pero "aplicales el castigo".

ZHN4f6pdaa	If you were given a blood test and it came back negative, it is doubtful that you are pregnant.  Blood tests are pretty accurate.  You do need to see your doctor, because there could be a more serious problem going on.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!!|`|c186689c93bac99b09823d36cf7aebadaa	Hi there dear.  I hate to say this but if you had a blood test that said you are not pregnant, you are almost certainly not pregnant.  At least not anymore.  I would really have to wonder about the tests that you took that were positive.  That very seldom happens unless you are pregnant.  Those urine tests only react to HCG which is only present when you are pregnant.  If it was in your urine in a strong enough concentration to cause a positive result then I have to think that you were pregnant.  Something must have happened in between that time and the time of your blood test.  Your doctor needs to be evaluating all this and trying to figure out what in the heck is going on with you.  Not having had a period since back in November is quite significant.  I would really want some answers and you have a right to them!<br>  Good luck and I hope everything works out alright.<br>  Blessings<br>  Lady Trinity~|`|d853ef1bb5c687e86bafe82e40473423aa	my sister took test for 3 month they kept coming up negative then on the 3month she took one and it came up she was pregnant go to the doctor again if you not pregnant you need to know why you are not getting your period good luck|`|73c4dd84555b300214abd114339939cfaa	sound preg ..good luck|`|8ac4f5ddc8d3453ef6b3d21b3c9212dbaa	I once had a doctor tell me that even the slightest sign of blood is a period.  Since you had the blood test and it came back negative, you are probably not pregnant.  Quite possibly you are getting ready to start again and that is the reason that you are bloated and crying.  My opinion would be to see your OBGYN soon if you are in that much pain and that miserable.|`|AA10760892	You will most likely have to go to the doctor to get a blood test to find out for sure.  Sometimes the tests are accurate or there isn't enough of the hormone they pickup in your urine, a blood test is the best way to go.

YnPLtmCUaa	Signs and or symptoms will be the same.  The cause of said symptoms are due to the fact that you are pregnant, regardless of how many children you are carrying.  Any notion of being able to tell by symptoms, that you have twins, or what the babies sex will be, are completely unfounded.  The only true way of telling, is by an ultrasound.  That will tell you if you are having twins, but will not always determine the sex.  I have seen ultrasounds where the doctor was sure that the child was one sex, but on the delivery date, out came the other!  Most of the time they are pretty accurate though.  I've worked in the medical field now for nearly 5 years, and have some experience with prenatal care.|`|42c1974d425360f00a87226743d5f4feaa	They can change from trimester to trimester, child to child, even when you aren't having twins so I would imagine with twins it could be even more pronounced.|`|08632a24b8d058fccc84a20d424779a2aa	As one of the other respondents mentioned, symptoms are directly dependent on that particular pregnancy and it is somewhat unreasonable to compare to your previous pregnancies.  By and large, you need to make extra sure that you have as much sleep as you feel your body requires - it could very well be more this time around.  You should take more care to avoid strenuous activities - carrying twins to terms is somewhat rare but over-doing it could cause too early of a birth. <br>  <br>  I think one major item to note is that your body will do whatever it can to support the babies growing inside of you even if that means sapping nutrients or fluids from you.  So the most important thing to note is that you are taking care of yourself because ultimately your own health will suffer at the cost of nourishing your twins.<br>  <br>  This advice seemed to work well for us - my twins are 13 days old today and healthy as can be.
GpnUvc9iaa	La gravidanza è un fenomeno biologico che interessa tutto l’organismo. <br>   <br>  Aspetto generale <br>  La ritenzione di liquidi (idremia) che si ha nel sangue e nei tessuti dovuta all’iperaldosteronismo associato ad una riduzione delle proteine plasmatiche determina: <br>  # Consistenza pastosa delle masse muscolari <br>  # Aumento di peso <br>  # Edema degli arti inferiori <br>  # Aumento lassità dei tendini e dei legamenti <br>   <br>  La donna presenta una maggiore velocità di crescita dei capelli. In alcuni casi i processi di ipertrofia e iperplasia ossea (iperostosi ossea gravidica) possono conferire alla gravida un aspetto acromegalico.  <br>   <br>  Una pigmentazione brunastra può comparire a livello della linea alba, su eventuali cicatrici chirurgiche, sull’areola mammaria ed intorno ad essa e sul viso (cloasma).<br>  Se la donna tende all’ipertricosi talora questa diventa molto accentuata. Possono pure comparire eritema palmare e nevi telangectasici (viso, collo, arti, torace). Fibromi e molluschi cutanei (dovuti all’iperplasia dell’epidermide) si ritrovano spesso al collo e alle ascelle nella seconda metà della gravidanza, sia in forma sessile che peduncolata. <br>   <br>  Apparato respiratorio <br>  Nella seconda metà della gravidanza l’utero sospinge in alto il diaframma e le escursioni respiratorie sono rese più difficili; conseguentemente è facile avere non un aumento della frequenza degli atti respiratori, ma un aumento della profondità dei singoli atti. Il tipo di respirazione che nella donna è costo-diaframmatico diventa perlopiù costale, per cui sono più frequenti episodi di dispnea, specie sotto sforzo.  <br>   <br>  Apparato cardiocircolatorio <br>  L’apparato cardiocircolatorio deve sostenere un lavoro maggiore e questo si realizza in un aumento della gittata sistolica; l’esame del polso evidenzierà una maggiore ampiezza e una maggiore frequenza. La gittata cardiaca raggiunge il suo massimo alla 30^ - 34^ settimana (40% in più). La frequenza cardiaca registra un aumento medio di 10 battiti/minuto. Mano a mano che l’utero aumenta di volume il diaframma si alza facendo ruotare il cuore lungo il suo asse antero-posteriore; l’itto della punta si sposta al quarto spazio e circa 3 centimetri a sinistra. A livello elettrocardiografico si assiste ad un’onda Q profonda ed a un’inversione della T in terza derivazione. Soggettivamente talvolta la paziente lamenta delle aritmie e più raramente degli attacchi di tachicardia parossistica. La pressione arteriosa rimane immodificata e va considerata patologica per valori di minima maggiori di 90 e massima maggiori di 140. <br>   <br>  Apparato urinario <br>  Il flusso renale aumenta dall’8^ settimana e raggiunge il suo massimo alla 16^, poi tende a diminuire e verso la 30^ - 34^ settimana torna ai valori normali. La filtrazione glomerulare aumenta e alla 15^ settimana è del 50% superiore, poi decresce e torna ai livelli normali alla terza settimana dopo il parto. Si ha riduzione del tono e della peristalsi ureterale e vescicale (progesterone). L’uretere, specie quello di destra, viene dislocato lateralmente dall’utero; la vescica è spinta anteriormente in alto. Tutte queste modificazioni spiegano i disturbi urinari che compaiono con relativa frequenza ed in particolare disuria e pollachiuria. <br>   <br>  Apparato digerente <br>  Lo stomaco è spinto dall’utero in alto e verso sinistra; anche le anse vengono perlopiù spinte verso sinistra per una destroposizione dell’utero. Vi è ipotono dello stomaco, dell’esofago, della colecisti e di tutto l’intestino. Ecco così spiegati gli episodi di difficoltà digestiva, di pirosi gastrica e di stipsi. <br>  Tiroide <br>  La tiroide si presenta ingrossata e modicamente iperfunzionante; il metabolismo basale è aumentato del 25%. Soggettivamente la donna sente spesso caldo e suda. <br>   <br>  Sistema nervoso centrale e psiche <br>  La donna gravida è una tensiolabile. Il suo sistema nervoso è in uno stato di grande instabilità, facilmente incline a modificazioni simili a quelle che si hanno nei ciclotimici. La psiche e l’attività emotiva sono concentrate sullo stato di gravidanza, sul feto e sul neonato. <br>  <br>  <br>  Cmq fai le analisi del sangue. sono l'unica fonte certa. aspetta un attimo non evere ansia. se deve essere sarà.<br>  <br>  Ti auguro di avere al più presto un bambino sano e bello.<br>  <br>  baci baci|`|4MFEqeoaaa	beh direi che hai tutti i tipici sintomi di chi e` in stato interessante. mia moglie aspetta il nostro terzo figlio e ha sempre avuto questi sintomi

ea3364b1c5e97e0bc61a58036460265daa	The major side effect of most fertility drugs is an increased chance of multiples.  Fortunately, the drugs and techniques are getting more precise now so that danger is beginning to go down.<br>  <br>  As for Clomid, the side effects while you're waiting to find out if you're pregnant can get pretty uncomfortable.  But there's only a slightly higher risk than normal of multiples.  Most fertility drugs are based around hormones you produce naturally so the chances of an abnormal pregnancy are really low.<br>  <br>  I mention Clomid because you brought it up and also because this is the one fertility drug I'm pretty knowledgable about.  I have horribly irregular cycles and after some tests and conversation, my fertility specialist put me on Clomid this past March.  The side effects didn't kick in until the last day of taking it but then I had major mood swings and hot flashes for a week and a half.  My boobs also got huge during this time.  It didn't help when I ovulated either because ovulation *always* makes my boobs big and sore.  For a couple weeks in there, I was sure all my symptoms were just from the Clomid, not because I was pregnant.  In fact, I was so unhappy that one night I told my husband that I wasn't taking Clomid again until the fall because I didn't want to wreck the trips we have planned for the summer by being an emotional wreck.  The next day, I got a positive pregnancy test.  Hahaha <br>  I'm twelve weeks into a healthy pregnancy now.<br>  <br>  The one thing you should be aware of with Clomid is this.  The first cycle you take it, the side effects probably won't be too bad.  But Clomid builds up in your system so each sucessive cycle the side effects will probably get worse, at least that's what several women told me who took it two or more cycles in a row.  Also, I was one of the lucky ones who got pregnant on the first cycle.  On average, most women need to take it two or three cycles for it to work.|`|9fZAypNJaa	There may be side-effects from the drugs- commonly abnormality and hot flushes.

The day you ovulate and two days before and two days after.|`|p3WITGwPaa	The previous answer was right, but sperm can live inside you up to 5-7 days! So is you have sex 5-7 days or less before you ovulate, there's still a chance you could get pregnant!|`|37ecaf6683655868acb1374c36370133aa	Take a guess!
887b882f1a5f4502bae049466173bb62aa	First I am so sorry for your loss. Everyone is different. Unfortunalty there is no right answer for this question. When I had my miscarriage I started bleeding, but no heavier than a period. I went to the ER and they couldn't tell if I the baby was still alive or if I was miscarrying. I went for 2 whole weeks bleeding, passing clots, and cramping. I never passed the baby so I had to go in and have a D&C. Which is like an abortion (but definitly not the same). They had to scrape everything in my uterus out to stop the bleeding and prevent from infection. Those are very common. Even if you think you have passed everything they do them just to make sure everything came out, and it prevents infection. I had vicodin, valume, and some shot they gave me but I was still awake. It was more the emotional pain than anything. I know waiting is the worst part. I would look in the toilet everytime to see if I could see my baby. but I never did. Good luck, and think positive!|`|A1BKRBq0aa	Was your intention to have a miscarriage? I'm confused on what is going on here. You should get to a hospital quick before something worse happens.|`|AJr8gNFfaa	Even if you want to miscarry,you should do it to a doctor.Anyways,you should see a doctor.And i hope you will,because in any case they have to clean you,you can't just loose a baby and get over it.There are some procedures.Good luck,you sure need it!|`|Ufap0Sbkaa	you wont know as you will go into shock you need to go to the em/room they have to remove the baby asap if they is know heart beat ,it is call toxic shock my sister went though it as the doctor told her it was normal and it was not normal at 13 weeks .she got very sick and we Nealy lost her ,please go to the em room asap and they will do a scan to see if the baby has past and then they will book you in for a em /op good luck and remember thing happy for a reason i and my thoughts are with you|`|a886990db3da72f9049b5468f25f3bdcaa	should you not be getting to your dotor like NOW??? or even a walk in clinic, there is also emergecy...I wouldnt wait around for thursday if i was you...plus i think you would notice when you do at three months along...|`|fqRSZAo6aa	first of all im heaps sorry im 12weeks and im shi*ing my sef that im going to miscarry.any time now you will see it in the toilet.
BNrWvhPPaa	I had this with both my pregnancies. Not everyone gets it. It terrified me the first time as I didnt know I was pregnant and thought it was diabetes or something else. <br>  <br>  By the second, I realized it was just one of the ways my body was responding to pregnancy. I found resting helpful. Listen to your body.<br>  <br>  I didnt have morning sickness till the dizzy stage passed. <br>  <br>  Weird things happen in pregnacy ( I got red spots and skin tags that went away after).|`|uBICgcbAaa	Try laying down when you feel dizzy.  Make sure you take lots of naps during the day and be careful when you get in and out of the shower.  Don't take any medicine without first asking your doctor and make sure you don't stress out or carry anything heavy.|`|cyKSeCw5aa	i had that same thing. my dr said its from all of your extra blood going to your baby. so when you get up it takes you body long you get blood to you head then befor, it will get better. good luck|`|72e94e9b80c4c357ea9ddbf53c070f38aa	I did experience this in the beginning of my pregnancy as well as the nausea.  Unfortunatly I had to stop working because of it.  At the time I was working at a nursing home doing housekeeping.  I got alot of advice about not getting up too quickly or making sure I ate small amounts often, but nothing helped for me.  Sorry, but good luck to you, I hope it eases up soon.|`|zPFBTaqHaa	i was wonderin tha same thing cause ive bn feeln a lil light headed evn when im sittin down
d5834fd505063267941eec5d02c957aeaa	I also had a preemie c-section, that was up and down under the skin, and a bikini on the outdside.<br>  <br>  My OBGYN stated when we started to TTC that I had a 40% to 50% of rupture, and that percent increases if you are overweight or with every c-section before.<br>  <br>  I would suggest having a talk with your OBGYN to discuss your risks and how you can minimize those risks.<br>  <br>  Best of luck!|`|6a302ded0cb3ae070fbcb6449e4449efaa	The risk of uterine rupture exists mainly with a trial of labor  after previous c-sections. There is very little risk during pregnancy itself. Just be sure you have your next c-section before you go into labor spontaneously! Studies have shown the the risk is approximately 1 out of 330 for a spontaneous uterine rupture with previous c-section, without trial of labor.<br>  <br>  (I had an emergency c-section with my first, and two other sections with my other kids. The only real risk was for VBAC, but the doctor still tried to talk me into it!)|`|DU7gTnQlaa	when my mom had me she had to have a c-section and i turned out fine
IpxjCtLYaa	I have had 2 c-sections, both bikini style.  We were told not to have any more because I have a hole in my uterus.  Getting pregnant again, would kill me and the unborn child.  But that's not the same as scar tissue obviously.  Talk to your OB and listen closely to what he/she says.  Will there be complications with another section that will harm your life or the childs?  That's the big question.  Having had an up/down incision, you would have to do it that way again, no questions there.  But I don't see why you can't have one more and that's it.  So call, talk to them and listen closely.  Good luck!|`|1ffc303db15fdc00d04d05f7b03f2f53aa	I've only had one and planning to have another one with this pregnancy.  In my birthing class for my first pregnancy, we were informed that we know what type of incision was made on the uterus if we had to have a c-section.  An up and down cut can cause complications in future pregnancies because there is a risk of the uterus rupturing during delivery.  I would get a second opinion and discuss your options with your doctor.  If it puts your life at risk, then you should avoid it.  Your 4 children need their mommy more than you need another child.  Best of luck to you.|`|2b5dd3581135b61e32cf9d6f56212bb0aa	If you don't mind risking bursting open your uterus, go for it.  I think it sounds like a dangerous thing.  Why risk it?  Four kids is a lot of people to feed, nurture, and put through college.  Aren't you tempting fate by asking for more?|`|ZMZ1IsPWaa	I would have a serious discussion with your OB about it.  Each time you have one, the risks do go up a bit.  I'm just wondering if it was for medical or personal reasons you had the c-sections because you're better off doing a VBAC.  Anyhow - find out all the facts and recommendations from your OB first - 5 c-sections is a lot for a body to take and it definitely won't be easier.  <br>  <br>  Best of luck to you and I honestly hope they give you the go ahead for #5 but be careful!

So he just old me to take it easy and not to be doing any strenuous activities. I also got put on bed rest until the bleeding stopped then he said I could continue with my normal every day activities (aside from softball!). And he even said that running on a tredmill and all of that was ok until you couldn't see your feet anymore, because then you run the risk of falling down and hurting you or your baby!|`|23f308d3ada4d7b8f5338c17a17739abaa	they say exersize is good for both mommy to be and baby but i too had spotting and a few moths later turned into heavy bleeding with cerlages put in and i still had my baby preemie born at 28 weeks almost 2 lbs 2 oz i would say no take it easy think of your baby listen to your dr's no matter what ..|`|4yEkOzWxaa	i would check with your doc.

toO54eMjaa	I'm am sure that your doctor told you that the vitamins that you are taking are very, very strong so you need to eat when you take them.  If you are vomiting all the time maybe you could try to take the vitamin before bed so you can sleep thru the nausea, or try and eat a few crackers - maybe with peanut butter to coat your stomach and then take the vitamin.  Your baby takes what it needs from you and you are left with whatever is left so your baby will be fine - maybe the doc can prescribe a different kind of vitamin, maybe one that is less strong and you take it twice instead of once a day.  I hear the baby's heartbeat very early and it is very fun!  Have your hubby go with you, its a real cool experience!  Good luck to you and hopefully the nausea will subside soon!|`|a6f6a6266eb16fda348c56044f9bc982aa	I don't know about heart beats of babies sorry! I have a friend that is pregnant and she was having really bad nausa spells with the baby!

They have really helped her and she said they taste good, so if you get a chance look for those!

Taking mine in the morning was a sure fire way to ensure that I was going to need to find somewhere on the way to work to stop and throw up.  <br>  <br>  Don't stress too much over the nutrients the baby is getting - my OB put it to me this way - the baby's going to get what it needs first, so if you really are having a problem you're going to feel the effects before the baby is in serious trouble.  Try eating small amounts of dry carbs - cereal, crackers - have a few even before you get up out of bed in the morning.  When you're feeling OK (or at least a little less queasy), try to get down some protein.
