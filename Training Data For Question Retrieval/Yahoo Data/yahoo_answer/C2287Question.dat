20090202104900AAZDzvN	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Need a grammar check please- part 2?	Even though this site is entertaining, I did find some flaws within the site.  Not all the games will load on the site but they do give you an email to use, if you can’t get the site to work.  I emailed the website and I was disappointed that in five days later that I didn’t receive an return email.   Looking at the site with a critical eye, I started to realize that the site is enjoyable to use but doesn’t have a lot of solid information or reputable sources.  The games are fun but not all of them are clear on content and what student is actually learning.  The site does not complete the depth of information related to the topic it claims to cover.  It briefly touches on lots of subject but doesn’t fully cover algebra or geometry.  At first discovery of the site, I actually assumed it was for elementary students and after more research I discovered it was geared to thirteen and above.  Although, some of the games are too hard for a student under the age of thirteen some of the other games are way too young and immature for a student of that age.  The site has a lot of links but some of these links are not related to math and took me off my path of looking for good mathematic information.   The site does express good points about not get stressed out but it links to beach relaxing scenes which I don’t think relates to a student of thirteen years old.      This website seemed very fun and different at first but after more cridical thinking about the site, I realized this site would be extremely hard for a thirteen to maneuver around.   The site doesn’t have complete and relevant topics about mathematics.  Some of the games do not make sense nor do they apply the correct mathematical information as they claim.    I personally would not direct a student to just use or view this site but it does have some relevant and fun information on it.  This website could be use as an additional resource after the teacher check the information, materials and makes sure the site loads the game.  I don’t believe I have found a true gem but I didn’t find a website that gave me some ideas about making math a game.

20090202105941AAudTEf	Education & Reference;Primary & Secondary Education	Sixth-form options...? (Achieving 'the unachievable')?	Hi, I will be starting sixth-form next year, and am now being prompted to contemplate which subjects I wish to take next year at AS-level.   These are my options:   1. Biology   2. Chemistry   3. Mathematics   4. English Literature      However, many people are warning me that the subjects I have chosen are ones that I will not be able to handle. What do you think - will I be able to handle them; the fusion of sciences, and english is apparently 'defeating'. But I thoroughly enjoy reading, and love science as well. I am also a very consistent, conscientious, hard-working student. Will I be able to manage the work load, based on the subjects, and yet still be prosperous in a medicine career?       So far, of the examinations of relevance, in year 11 I obtained a grade B in my English Literature mock exams - working to improved that to an A*. This is fairly good, considering the fact that we have only just started English Literature.       In core science for year 10, I also attained an A overall for my science modules, and am currently undergoing resits to get an A* for core science :D.      Thank-you in advance for reading my small passage.

BUT I THINK THEY MAY HAVE MADE A MISTAKE. Because the folder had only 3 items, Acceptance Letter 1 sheet generic definitely photocopied as you can tell from the signature my name and address on it are right though but no date it just say November 2008, item 2 is an Address change form and deposit card with prepaid envelope. Thats it and online it still says my application is complete, but being reviewed.      I sent in the deposit, and I am too scared to call because this my first choice school and I don't want to be disappointed. I'm checking my bank for the deposit then I will call because once they deposit my check it becomes legally binding regardless...      I mean usually an acceptance packet is text book thick, housing, insurance, health information, etc. I did not get any only 3 items or 4 if you count the envelope to send the deposit. Did they make a mistake?      George State and Cornell even sent out acceptance letters by mistake. Please someone give me insight.

I know where some stuff under a hood is and I know a bit about civic motors and integra's but I don't know if i should apply because if it's for people who already know stuff about cars than i'd prob be lost and fail, so could you help me out and explain what they teach you there and if i should go or not... and do you think dealerships would hire a girl?? would it be hard to find a job as a mechanic since im a girl?? please tell anything you can to me thanks.

20090202113908AABfoHk	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Grammar help, please!!!~~~?	I was born and raised in Korea. All Koreans, myself included, are envious of American education. When I came moved here to attend high school, I really liked the circumstances of education like if I study hard, then I could get a good grade. As an immigrant, I really appreciated my experience through high school and I still appreciate it. America has a great education program. Because of the outstanding education system, many people can have a positive impact in our society and the world. However, there is a problem uprooting in high school. According to many researches, today’s students have a difficult time catching up at school. This is the 21st century and also called as the age of information. This century tends to rely on technology. Also the education system tries to follow ways to fit technology in their program. The government proposes many ideas to have a great education to high school students. Generally, high school students are weak in math and science. Everyone knows how important math and science is today. As time is going by, there is no doubt that emphasis on competition in academics is an important issue. Emphasis on competition in academics make government to spend their money and time to invest to school program for enhancing math and science skills.
20090202114546AA0fLMw	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Grammar help, please!!!~~?	While United States is called a superpower country for many years, a development of science became also a superpower. One of the thing that America could be maintained as a supernatural country was a development of math and science. These subjects are not developed in short times. When these subjects studies for many, and many years, then we see a development of science and math. That means, a success of math and science depends on how important of foundation is. Government knew that well, and that it makes to spend money for education. Math and science is emphasizing to be important issue in our life, government spend their money and time to invest to school program for enhancing math and science skills. This lead to students to feel the importance of math ands science, and hire better math and science teachers so these teachers can teach students. Education is an important place to prepare a future. I wish the education could be beneficial to students so students can learn well, and having a good perception.

20090204170000AAbK1W8	Education & Reference;Primary & Secondary Education	What to take my Senior Year?	Ok, so first off, I should say I want to go to a pretty good college, and major in something like biochemistry, neuroscience, pre-med, or something to that effect; then afterward attend a medical school. So anyway, my freshman year, I started out in way too low of a math class, as well as science.  Since then, I have been trying to make up for this, by catching up to the level I know I should be at, or at least to a level that would be acceptable by a college.  So next year, my senior year, I have a chance of obtaining this, but it would require a ridiculous amount of work.  My schedule would look something like AP Literature/European History, Calculus and/or AP Calculus, AP Biology (one of the toughest classes in the school), and Physics.  So basically what I am wondering, is Physics that necessary to Major in one of the aforementioned subjects? How worthwhile would you say AP Calc would be?

20090204201103AAmGxa2	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	Rate: how my transcript is shaping up.. also some other things...?	Hey guys! I'm just a junior in high school in new york city, but I'm looking at universities already. So lets cut to the chase.      I want to go into Business as well as Journalism      My cumulative, weighted average is currently at a 90.3. My grades keep going up every single year. I just got my report card that covers 1st/2nd quarter and mid term grades. Best I've ever done at the half way mark.      I'm a minority, first generation hispanic student.       I'm in the honors classes. One of which includes Latin 3. Next year as a senior I'll be taking AP english.      I'm ranked in the top 10% of the graduating class. But I'm holding on to that honor by a thread. I'm ranked 17th, and if I dropped to 18th, that puts me top 11% xD. hopefully I can hold onto that until it's time to apply to university.      SATS? Not so great. But I've only taken it once.. got a 1510.       Extra curriculars.. I've done some pretty sweet stuff.      - Wrote for school newspaper in all 3 years, and I'm editor in chief now as a junior      - This is my first year in mock trial, and I am playing the lead witness for the defense, next year I'll be a lawyer (it's reserved for seniors >_<)      - Currently I am attending a highly selective inner city job program.. where I do training for interviews/resumes/etc. Hopefully I do land a job, that'll help my transcript a lot. Though being in this program is quite the honor.      - Probably the thing that stands out most... I attended an 8 day youth leadership conference in Rochester University before this junior year. It's highly competitive. Rochester also gives all students I think a 1000 dollar scholarship automatically, so I can say "hey, look what I got from a major university :]." National Hispanic is also associated with over a hundred major universities such as NYU, Boston, Duke, etc. A major connection.      - Over the summer before senior year I'll also be attending another National Hispanic program, called the Collegiate World Series. This is NYU, and again NYU sponsors some of the money. Here I'll be doing interviews and working on skills with real admission reps from major universities. As well as competing with other students. This can be a good chance to make some connections, and also the program looks great on my transcript.      - Last.. I did community service from 9-11:30am every Saturday in freshman and sophmore years as an aide at my church for bible classes. This year as a junior, and also as a senior (I'll be doing the same) Saturday volunteer is dropped in favor of helping out as an asisstant, youth leader, and part time teacher when needed on tuesdays and wednesdays for high school confirmation classes.         Well that covers it guys. Based on my grades, SAT, activities, how am I shaping up? As it stands, my number 1 school right now is Northeastern. I've been looking at it for months and really love it. As well as Boston University.. and boston college, way too far of a reach? Also I really do need scholarship money.. so hopefully wherever I go I am offered something.      Based on what I want to do and my current profile, can you recommend some universities? I'm in new york and don't want to go any lower than say, North Carolina, don't wanna go far west past Chicago. I want a good, name brand school that I can look into.       Thanks!

20090204222117AAfHIvN	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	Could you please check my grammar ? Thank u very much?	1. The position of perpetrators and the size of losses in fraud schemes.      Employee was more than five times as high as the percent of cases caused by percent of owner and executive, and almost two times higher than percent of manager. It shows that employee need to more training and watching for anti-fraud. Usually high position person will tend to have the more powerful effect on the median loss in organization. Most the position of median loss was owner and executive who have high authority need to more responsibility of anti-fraud and self-monitoring because the number of median loss was nine hundred thousand dollars which is fourteen times higher than the employee’s median loss, and six times more than the median loss in schemes involving manager.          2. The annual income of perpetrators and the size of losses in fraud schemes.       The percentage of cases in occupational fraud slightly decreased as annual income increased. This data was very similar to research of the effect of the perpetrator’s position. This research shows that usually upper-level person would have more salary than lower position person such as employee and manager. In this data, we had to focus on the perpetrator earned between over fifty thousand dollars and less fifteen thousand dollars because the perpetrators were almost forty percentages of all cases and they had significant effect on size of median losses in a fraud scheme. There were very small percent of perpetrator to get salary more than two hundred thousand dollars per year , but they were the median loss was very big number of median losses which is around twenty times higher than the perpetrator earned less than fifty thousand dollars.          3. The length of time perpetrators have been employed with victim organization and the size of losses in fraud schemes.      Similar to the result data on position and annual income, usually the length of time perpetrators related with their salary and position. The median loss in a fraud schemes generally increased with the length of time perpetrators who worked in organization but the highest percentage of cases was perpetrator work between three and five years and they were almost two times as high as the median loss caused by perpetrators who worked between one and two years. And this is most single highest increased of median loss between two sample of cases. It showed that the employee works for three to five years in organization, they had actual advantage, authority and trust from other employees. The important point of anti-fraud is to monitor and keep the balance of their delegation authority and to avoid too much trust and control power to a few employees without damage of autonomy.         4. The frequency of fraud schemes committed by male versus female.      In 2002, I found that the number of men in a fraud scheme was just little more than women. It was only seven percentages difference between men and women. I thought this came from inequality to get a job but now it seems to be equal. There didn’t find any significant difference between men and women. The men of median loss were relatively higher than women but it came from men tending to occupy more higher and authority position in organization. It will be same in the future.          5. The age of perpetrators and the frequency of fraud schemes committed.      The effect of age is not primary reason to relate with a fraud scheme but age is one of secondary factor. This data is correlation in other research between the age and the position because generally old employee had more high position in organization. Over sixty years old employee of the perpetrator’s frequency was only two point five percentages but the median loss of over sixty ages were five hundred thousand dollars which is five times higher than over thirty one years` employees and twenty seven times as high as the median loss caused by under twenty six who called entry level in organization. Almost sixty five percentages age of the perpetrator in data was over the age of thirty one and under fifty in 2004, those had most significant influence in organization. These data shows that the organization would need to educate strong anti-fraud program before over thirty year’s employees.          6. The education of perpetrators and the frequency of fraud schemes committed      The perpetrators had post graduate degree and bachelor degree, the median loss committed by those was over two hundred forty three thousand dollars which was three times higher than the perpetrators who had high school diploma or less. Generally higher educated person will tend to occupy more authority and high position in company. Especially the median loss in a fraud scheme related with perpetrators who had post graduate degree increased thirteen hundred thousand dollars which was not trend that the median loss who The perpetrators who had no post graduate degree slightly decreased in 2004. It shows that scho

20090205100932AAnjiNK	Education & Reference;Quotations	He said those to me.... What does he mean by that?	We were chatting and stuffs. Just the two of us...   He stepped closer and pecks a kiss on my lip then stepped back and told me that I looked really good. [I was only in my PJ] It was out of the blue then we continued to chat and chat.    Somehow the subject changed when I asked him a question about his girlfriend. We started to talk about his relationship, how that he said he loves his girlfriend but he's NOT in love with her anymore. He has been with her for four years since he was 17 and said he wanted to play around a little before settling down for good and admitted to me he cheated on her by kissing this one other girl but he has no feeling for her.  He said “I know I make mistakes”    He also talked about IF we end up being together someday, would I be willing to get pregnant with his child because he wants to have at least 2 kids of his own. (He asked me that because I already have a child and mentioned that I didn’t want another kid)   Then we started holding hands then we started to hold hands harder as like we missed each other so much because we did have a history before he got into relationship.   Brief history about us:  He used to chase after me for months, he was crazy for me, I was crazy for him but I wasn’t ready for a relationship because at that time I was still young and not experienced with dating and stuffs.  Then he gave up and starts dating Anna. Then I wanted him but he told me it was too late, he tried but I told him I didn’t want him. He is with his girlfriend for 4 yrs now but 3 yrs ago, he was going to dump her for me when we hung out alone but then drama happened and we both backed off.    Then he said to me” I wonder if I only want him to fool around with or more than that?” then he asked me "how bad do you want me?" I asked how bad do I want you in what way? Physically or in general?   He said in general.   So what does it mean when he pecks my lip and held my hand hard?    And why is he talking about the “IF” future with the baby talk.    Does he have a crush on me still?    But one thing still confuses me- I know he has a girlfriend but he said one day when I feel ready, he wants the two of us to spend a whole day alone, just the two of us like three years ago, and sleep at a hotel  since we can’t let people know because there’ll be big drama.    The reason why he’s scare to breakup with his girlfriend is because of his FAMILY. His dad will get MAD at him if he leaves her. Plus he broke her virginity and she loves him. So he has a lot pressure toward himself to break up with her.

I failed my test, and tomorrow is the day to turn in grade sheets. We have to get them signed, and it's 5 points. I got it signed, and I have to turn it in tomorrow. I need to turn it in, and I don't want a particular student, friend to see my grade. There is a 50% chance that she will, because... she's the collector, and passer. At least 3 other people will see my grade...3+ people. I really don't want her to see. If I turn it in tomorrow morning, then some Geometry students might see. If I turn it in tomorrow, after school, it'll be already "late." If I turn it in on the time it is really due, then, I will have at least 3 people see it, which is 3+ people. And, with that, there is a 50% chance that my friend, Katherine, will see it, and tell everyone, which will be not good. Long story...but, so what should I do? I can't go tell her that I got a C overall grade! I'm an A student! I really can't!

Januar 1938 in Worsbrough Dale, South Yorkshire) war von 1981 bis 2000 der Chef der britischen Gewerkschaft National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), gründete 1996 die Socialist Labour Party und ist seitdem deren Vorsitzender. Bekannt wurde er vor allem durch den Minenarbeiterstreik 1984/1985 und seine bittere politische Opposition zu Margaret Thatcher.      Scargill arbeitete nach seinem Schulbesuch seit 1953 als Bergmann in der Wooley Colliery. 1955 begann er sein organisiertes politisches Engagement als Mitglied der Young Communist League. 1962 trat er aus dieser jedoch wieder aus und wurde Mitglied in der Labour Party. Ab 1973 war er Führer der Yorkshire Miners Union, dabei war er unter anderem federführend bei der Organisation des Bergarbeiterstreiks von 1973, welcher zum Sturz der Regierung Edward Heath führte. 1981 stieg er auf zum Chef der NUM.

A company will charge me $250. If the boat is moved before the end of the season, a rush fee of $200 will be added to the bill.  A weather expert assesses the probability that the storm will sweep inland and hit the lake to be about 0.25. If the storm swings inland and hits the lake, the potential damage may be as high as several thousand dollars. I decided that damage to the sloop if it remains in the lake and the storm hits will be $5,000, $4,000, $3,000, or $2,000, and I assessed these events to be equally likely. If the boat is moved now, the damage will be zero. prediction inland storms 90% of the time before the storms hit and predict misses 90% of the time the storms remain at sea.

I am writing a little well-developed paragraph in which I have to disscuss at least three heroic triats which Beowulf possesses. Within this paragraphs disscussion I have to give examples from Beowulf that support each trait. I'm through two traits already with Courage and Loyalty.

If you know of a characteristic trait and an example- I would adore you! lol. If you know there is another strong triat and know that there is an example but can't think of it. Please let me know. Any good hints towards finishing this paragraph will be helpful tonight! Thank You & it is much appreciated.
