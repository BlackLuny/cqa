20090222192134AAYdoHP	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Government & Non-Profit	Non-Profit IRC 501(c)(3) Status and Political Involvement?	I am part of the executive board of a Non-Profit group and there is an issue, politically speaking, which has taken away a state commission funding that our group needs. Would testifying at a public hearing, requesting members of the group write to their representatives, and set up a rally make my group to lose tax exemption due to political involvement? I understand on the exemption requirements it says, "influence legislation as a substantial part of its activities and it may not participate in any campaign activity for or against political candidates."      I am rather confused on how far the term "substantial"  goes. Is there a certain percentage of a group's actions that is termed substantial? For clarity purposes, my group has never been involved in politics but we have no choice this time around. This will be our first and probably last political action as a means to get our commission fund back. I thank you for your help in clarifying the IRC 501(c)(3) restriction of political involvement and while retaining exemption status.

20090222172411AAn1i8Z	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Law & Legal	Would this classify as a hostile work environment, legally?	I quit my job in December. I have yet to find another position and am considering filing for unemployment to make ends meet. I'm concerned, however, that I won't qualify because I need to prove a legally "hostile work environment." Please read the situation below and help me decide whether it would qualify:      * Boss constantly belittled other employees behind their backs and even belittled CLIENTS when they weren't around.   * Some in the office were treated unfairly and belittled face-to-face on a regular basis. The receptionist cried numerous times due to this and unfair workloads.   * Boss frequently threw temper tantrums inside and outside her office when things didn't go her way, including yelling profanities and stomping so that the entire office could hear.   * During the month I worked there, two employees were fired (one for medical reasons, which was particularly unfair). I also learned that numerous other employees were fired before I was hired.   * Boss refused to train me and constantly handed me off to other departments for which I didn't work.   * Boss would frequently bark incoherent orders at me with little help or explanation.   * Boss would act rude and impatient when requesting large tasks that she knew I wasn't trained on.   * Other times, boss would ignore me completely and give me no work to do (despite asking for assignments). This forced me to wander around the office, asking others for work and doing things that weren't even in my job description.   * Despite giving no verbal cues, I could tell that my boss looked down on me because I didn't have expensive clothing like others in the office.   * Boss was frequently unprofessional in front of clients and even went so far as to correct me in front of them.   * Being the only democrat in the office during the election season, I was made to feel uncomfortable and could not voice my opinions without ridicule. Though I'm white, I am an open-minded person and was extremely offended by constant racist jokes.   * The owner of the company (the boss of my boss) was just as unreasonable. I did not feel comfortable voicing my concerns with him.      What do you think? Do I have a case??

I am a stay at home mom & I babysit. The people that I babysit for, we have been friends for a few years. Well, here is the problem, the mom brings the little girl here at my house every morning that I have her, & she sits & we carry on a conversation for atleast10-15mins, & in the afternoon the father comes to pick up the little girl & he comes in & sits anywhere from 10-30mins or so, but comes PAYDAY on Friday in which I hardly have the little girl then because the mom doesn't have to be at work until 2pm & the father usually gets home before the mother has to leave, so I don't get paid until whenever he decides to get out or if I get out then I can go up to their house to get my PAY($15 a day) unlike this past Friday the mom had to be at work same time 2pm & the father had to be home for her to leave becuase I didn't have her this Friday, just M-TH well the mom had called & left me a voicemail stating that the father didn't have time to go by the bank to get his check cashed & the reason why is because he was helping the mom out at her store & he doesn't get paid for it(the mom & dad aren't married & they have a very rocky relationship) so I would have to wait until Saturday to get my PAY. (I am the same one who left: What would you do in this situation? Check it out) Well, the father had called me & told me that I will have the little girl on T & F of this week & hung up? Well I called him back & asked him when was I going to get paid & he said tomorrow & then he had the nerve to ask me IF I NEEDED the MONEY(this is my ONLY income & my husband works outside the house, he's the main provider) & I told him that I expect to get paid on Fridays just as he does. How would you react to this??? I apologize for this being so long!

My straight forward question is how can I make the $13,000 over the summer as a part time bank teller and lifeguard? Any forms of labor, odd jobs, and etc, I am fine with.  I am very very skilled with computers, and I am a 4.333 student(weighted courses)      Additionally:   -I'm 17, I am currently in high school, and plan to attend college.  At this moment, there is no way for my parents to do this, but I really want a 00-03 Ford F-150 Lightning. I currently own a 97 Ford F-150 XLT Supercab, which currently has a private party value of about $3,700.      I LOVE my F-150, but it is getting old, has about 200k miles on it, one of the gaskets is loose, and I can feel it dying.  I want to stick with the F-150 because that is all I've ever driven, and I just all around love Ford.  I want the Lightning, mainly for its unique style, and its V8 engine.  No one in my town owns one, and it would be noticed, and that is what I want in a vehicle.      I am applying for a job as a bank teller at the local bank (in a town of 10k) and am a lifeguard in the summer. I make on average $1,500 in the summer life guarding. The teller position will pay slightly over minimum wage ($7.75 hourly) and I will make the same wage guarding due to seniority.       I want to get this truck this summer.  I am doing my best to live debt free, and do not intend to get a car loan, or a credit card any time in my life.  I however, am willing to slide on the car loan, mainly because these loans don't attempt to drain you of your money like most credit card companies do.      Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.   Thanks!

To make this easier to follow, I want you to see different countries competing in a poker game.  There are several card tables in a room-each one representing a different country.  The players at the table represent each country's population.  The U.S. table is low on chips (the chips of course is spending money)  The players at the U.S. table need more money if they want to keep playing so they agree to get the money from the people at the table who doesn't have any but will be responsible for  paying it back sometime in the future.  Anyway...they get a pile of chips to continue in the game.  What happens if the players pick up their chips and take them to a different table?  Now some of the spending power has been handed over to a different poker table which also has lessened the spending power at the U.S. table.  Not only that but the remaining players at the U.S. table have to cover the loss.   Herein lies the problem with the stimulas checks... Just how much of the 'stimulus'moneies will be used for buying American made goods or services?  The consumer needs to be careful where this money goes.

We were recommended a agent and we started to give him our information. Well, we are about 2 weeks into this and the thing is that he said we were approved but he needed 4 letters of credit. We have not provided him that yet but he has told us already how much we were qualified for and the interest rate . Now, he is wanting us to come by his office to sign the contract. My husband and I were curious because we have not seen anything to sign a contract. I have given a list of zip codes were we wanted to live but I have not received or been shown anything. So, I called him back and asked about the contract and he said it was the contract to the bank, not the house. I don't understand this.

I do have insurance and everything taken care of but one problem...      ... My current insurance (All-State) is charging me too much money from what I'm looking at paying. I understand it will be pretty high but I wanna check out other companies and see if I can get a better deal. I am 19 and this loan is for a 2004 Yamaha R6 if that matters. It is pretty tricked out for performance and is pretty fast so I understand the high charge per month but I wanna see if any place else can offer me a better deal cause any money helps.

It will be 7 years since our bankruptcy went thru( in 3 years) and I will be out of school.  Before it was even discharged we had a car loan.  We have had 3 different car loans since then, and never miss a payment.  Basically everything we have, credit cards and car loans, are never late.  My questions are, is it bad to have more then one credit card?  Or if I close  a store credit card I had (which I did) is that good or bad?  The limit was only $100, and I never used it.  Between my husband and I we have $2000 limits and roughly $1500 in balance.  What is the best way to increase our credit score?  Should we close any of our cards?  Thanks for any advice, I was told to see a credit counselor but no time right now! Thanks again!

I'm 25 now and did some stupid things back about 3-4 years ago and I am ready to get my credit back on track and pay my debts off. I got a credit card, maxed it out and then didn't make my payments on time, I had a car repo'd and I have some other bills that I need to get paid off. I made payments on time for my car for a year before I lost my job and got too far behind to keep my car. I so regret how careless I was with my credit back then and now I need to get it fixed. I'm about $6000 in debt total. I have one large debt for my car that was taken 2 years ago and the rest are smaller debts. I'm wondering what the best way is to get my debt paid off and get my credit back. I know it will take awhile and that's fine, but I don't know what the best way is. I know there is bankruptcy and there is also those debt consolidation places. I heard that those debt consolidation plans can actually be bad for your credit or they don't actually help your credit much. I don't know if that's true or not though. I know I could just pay my debts off individually but that would take me awhile and I would rather pay money with consolidation so that I can be paying off each one a little at a time. What should I do? Should I just start calling places and making payments or would it be better to consolidate and pay them all at once a little at a time?
