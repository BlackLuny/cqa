20090202215030AAF3fqX	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Have you heard of the more commonly excepted Statue of Liberty Revelations Theory?	Revelations 10, 17 and 18. I know, I know, the 7 hills of Rome, blah blah. I've heard it. I honestly can say I've heard all the different theories of Revelations 17, 18 and 10. They all don't seem to amuse me. The Statue of Liberty and 9/11 seem to the most literal depiction I have ever heard/seen of. It is even credited as a theory on Wikipedia that The Statue of Liberty is the Whore of Babylon. Its pretty interesting.      Plus in Revelation 10, the prophet spoke and wrote in Greek. He called the angel "autos" which in greek is He/She/It, but the scriptures call the Angel a "He" b/c all angels in the Bible are male. Also the Greek word for "mighty" also means "Inanimate"      As the theory goes, Revelation 10 is the prophets depiction of 9/11 and the 7 WTC buildings that had come thundering down, (obviously the statue of liberty as well), while Revelations 17 and 18 have the insight on the story from God or the Angel who told him.      If you haven't fully looked up the theory in detail, it may seem hard to believe at first. I'm convinced. I know, I know, but please spare yourself I've heard all the other theories of these Revelations...      But my question is to you... have you ever heard of this one?

20090202215452AAKiTJJ	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What makes human beings so blind to what is, why don't we escape our slavery, are there aliens or demons...?	Controlling the world and that is why it is inhumane? The corruption in politics and religion is SO CORRUPT!!! How can it be human, why does tv intend on dumbing us down, along with HAARP! HAARP, get it?! We all have a frequency, and that has been exploited! Just who are these secret controllers, some on this yahoo! answers section make me very curious also, though I won't name any names. Do not think I aim to confuse, I only seek truth.
20090202215628AAfNplj	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What do you make of this?	You exist, and yet you do not. You are individual, yet you are connected. Self-realisation is when you let go of everything, your heart will still beat, and in that moment you will find higher truth, it came over me like a wave of electricity. It is a frequency, by tuning in to the frequency of reality you raise your awareness, by tuning in to tv you are dumbed-down. Beware of the awakening - one who is ill equipped knowledge wise entering into the unknown may find themselves lost and run in fear for their very soul. My latest theory is that the demon(s) are the gatekeepers to the forbidden knowledge - knowledge that would free you from this world. To leave this world, you must look at truth, and that is what is unknown. To face the unkown and overcome fear is a triumph, and that may be how to pass through the door, yet one must be willing to let oneself go to gain this, for fear of ones life will manifest itself into reality. Real life's rules can be bent, I realised this when I came to the knowledge that I contain the all as it contains me, one in all, all in one. With further meditation, and in time, I believe it may be possible for me to bend the rules of existence, because life is like a dream, except in a dream you can jump off a building and be ok, right? But what if you believed that in awake life, the fear in your mind of "I will die" manifests itself into this dimension, this lower dimension. We all tap in to the higher dimensions, but the demon's plan is to turn us all into zombies, so that we are bound to this dimension. That is another theory of mine. The rules of reality - all humans are energy given will, we have the power to manipulate energy, but to what limitation? If thoughts are real, and our imagination is unlimited, and we tune in to reality, why wouldn't we be able to bend reality itself to our will? I believe I could alter the fabric of existence. I may soon leave this country, and set off on a spiritual quest. The matrix isn't just a movie...

20090202215806AAu8dmV	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Jesus and mushrooms what does the bread of god mean?	“MANA” is an EGYPTIAN WORD, not HEBREW or ARAMAIC, Meaning; “The BREAD OF GOD”. Moses, Christ, and Joseph, The favorite son of Israel, were all educated in Egypt. MANNA [ETEONANACATL [Maya] = SOMA [Hindu] = AMBROSIA / BROMA-THEON gyptian/Hindu] It can be no coincidence that the MAYAN, EGYPTIAN, GREEK, HINDU, and ISRAELITE words for the mushroom all mean exactly the same thing: “THE BREAD OF GOD”.       John 2:6-9 indicates that Jesus made water into wine by boiling mushrooms (Mushroom-Tea), the waterpots were made of stone, not clay, (stone pots were used for cooking, clay pots used for storing water). These pots already contained 2-3 firkins of a substance before the pots were filled with water.    A “Firkin” is an Old-English measurement meaning a fourth part. Half to three-quarters of fresh mushrooms with water makes a potent tea. Tea is the safest way to consume field mushrooms, killing dangerous bacteria like E. Coli. In the Atharva Veda, the Hindus called this Tea SOMA. Greeks called mushroom jelly AMBROSIA.    Those who drank the water made into wine said it was the most potent intoxicant (St. John 2:10). The Bible tells us that Jesus making water into wine was the “beginning of miracles” … in other words no one saw any miracles until drinking the wine made from water. (St. John 2:11).          Daniel 5:3-5 with Exodus 16:32 and Hebrews 9:4    indicates that the mushroom was a DRUG. After sacking the temple in Jerusalem and stealing the Ark-of-the-Covenant, the King of Babylon and his table drank from the golden cup containing the holy “MANNA” they had visions within the hour….. Psilocybin takes 30-40 minutes to induce visions.          no one saw any miracles until drinking the wine made from water. ???? christians what do you think that means?
20090202215923AAwRbGh	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Has this ever happened to you?	My Mother is half Puerto Rican and half Spaniard (and is constantly mistaken for Italian).  My father is pretty much everything under the sun (African, European, Native American, Hispanic, etc.).  However, most people assume that I'm just Hispanic.  I've never really cared what people think I am, because chances are, if they think I'm something, they're probably right considering I'm so mixed.      Anyway, I guess since I look Hispanic, many people from Puerto Rico or the Dominican Republic or Peru or any other Latin American country will come up to me in shops or while I'm walking down the street and ask me a question in spanish.  My mother never taught me spanish because she isn't fluent in it herself, so I always have to tell people that ask me questions in spanish that I don't speak the language.  I will subsequently get the question, "Aren't you Hispanic?" in which I'll reply, "Yes, partially."  I then get the most infuriating response 99.999999999999999999% of the time: "Well, if you're Hispanic, you should speak spanish."  WHY?  Why should I speak spanish, or any language other than english, if I was born and raised in an english-speaking country?  I'm fine with people assuming I speak spanish... what I'm NOT fine with is how standoffish people become when they find out I don't speak it.      Has this ever happened to you?  I find it incredibly rude.

20090202221440AAZJzCf	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Isn't this whole thing racist?	With black history month. I mean, sure, black people can be oroud of their culture and stuff, but they're making a whole big deal (a freaking month!) out of their history. Everyone knows what happened! They think they're still under opression or being treated horribly. They're not! But ohhh, if there was a caucasian history month, i BET that would be considered racism. But of course it's okay if african americans do it! Make a whole month dedicated to "how much they've been through". Be proud of it, i don't care. But don't make some big deal about it and make a whole month for it. I'm not insulting african americans or their culture, i just think black history month is unneccesary.  Everyone thinks their own race is better than the others. And some racist blacks hate white people because they think they're more wealthy than them, and ALL white people are against and think they're better than black people. That is not true and they are being prejudgemental. Why can all races get alone and stop being racist and make a History Month. NOT a "Black History Month". I mean, for heaven's sake, i know some white people who live in the ghetto. It's not right to say that ONLY black people live in the ghetto or are gangsters. I mean, for crying out loud, my father is homeless. I hear gunshots almost every night, and i'm caucasian. I think so many people out there are racist and prejudge. And they stereotype others.

It seems to me that there is much in common; that the same brain functions are used in each of these experiences.  In other words, might not they be the same experience, but in different contexts?      What are your thoughts?      I have asked this question in both the Religion and Science sections, to get a broader perspective.

20090202222302AAtHXBN	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	What would be a Christian goal if they?	A Christian's goal is to glorify god. God is infinite. People are finite. Can finite being at least approach infinite? Approaching infinity is very different than at infinite.       1/("infinite") = undefined    1/("approaching to infinity") = 0      Assuming people can approach infinity, why does the Christian god care so much about that tiny tiny part (the tiny step to make "approaching infinite" to "infinite")?

My love, I want to tell you something very seriously...I want to tell you that you have made a place in my heart. That I honestly and truly fell in love with you the second I saw you...I just didn't want to believe it. I've been hurt a lot in my life, so giving my heart to someone is not easy for me but I want you to know that I am giving it to you now...I'm just happy that it's not too late. Thank you for giving me a second chance, for giving our relationship a second chance. I don't pretend that I am perfect and never will. I know that I have made a lot of mistakes in my life and in our relationship. And I know that I will make many more mistakes with us unfortunately, but I pray that no mistake that either you or I make will ever break our love for each other. And I pray that there is nothing that we can't work through because I never want to lose you or your love, and certainly not your trust again. And I pray that you will never do anything to lose my love or trust either. I want you to know that despite whatever you may think of me at times, I am a very strong person, a very honest person, a very loving person and I hope that over time, you will get to know me as this person I am describing. I want you to know that I love you more than anything!! You have always been this angel in my life since the moment we met and I want you to know how very much I appreciate you and all you do for me. You are my heart and my soul. When we hold each other, I feel more safe than I have ever felt in my entire life. And more loved than I have ever felt in my entire life. You give me so much happiness, so much love, so much passion that words cannot even describe how you make me feel every minute of the day and how in love with you I am every second. You inspire me to be better and encourage me to be a stronger, smarter, better person and I love you for that. You are my best friend and I love you always. Please never forget how much I love you. But even if you do forget from time to time, I plan on spending the rest of my life reminding you!!! All my love...

20090202222110AArVUBe	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Why is alcohol socially and legally accepted and marihuana is not?	They both impair your physical and mental abilities - the difference is that alcohol is more probable to lead you to dangerous behaviour.      Alcohol harms your liver permanently. With marijuana some of your mental abilities can be affected for an amount of time relative to the frecuency and quantity of consumption. Also your lungs if you are stupid and smoke it.      Alcohol causes physical addiction and marijuana can be psycologically addictive (like ANYTHING in this world can be addictive to a certain person under certain conditions)      You can die from drinking in one night. You can't die from marijuana..The only thing I can think of is some lung disease if you smoke like **** every minute of your life or if you just stop breathing air to start breathing smoke.      And marijuana it's not a "gateway drug"...That's something society has invented. Marihuana has so bad reputation that some people believe that doing some other illegal drugs it's the same BUT more powerful ("I'm already doing illegal stuff, what's the difference). But the thing is that marijuana is nothing compared to hard drugs; it's even less harmful than alcohol and cigarretes. If it was accepted with alcohol and cigarretes, law-followers would not move on to other drugs as they don't do now on maijuana for example.      So is there a valid reason (besides corporative issues) for not legalizing mariajuana?

I agree that drugs can enhance problems but in my experience (hanging out in the hippie side of Toronto and going to an Alternative school where 90% smoke pot and about 30% have tried other drugs or do other drugs) it is the problems in the first place that lead to drug use. Im not trying to say drugs are good (except marijuana-it has many positive attributes) but instead of a war on drugs shouldnt we focus more on a social problems and issues that lead to drug use. I mean i know that many first try because of the taboo behind it or because of issues like depression.

I got into an argument with an Englishman a while ago about the whole "Americans are Stupid" thing, and his main argument was that Americans are largely monolingual, and only speak English.      I (Trilingual American Foreign Languages Student) said: "Well here's something.  The United States is flanked on either side by thousands of miles of ocean.  We have English-Speaking Canada to the North.  And Spanish-Speaking Mexico to the South.  A lot of people in the US speak Spanish.  The French-Speaking part of Canada is pretty far from the border, and surrounded by the English-Speaking part, so we don't get much influence from them.  But YOU on the other hand--you're from England.  England, which is basically surrounded by French-Speaking France, Spanish-Speaking Spain, German-Speaking Germany, Dutch-Speaking Holland, and all the rest.

20090202222552AA8IECL	Society & Culture;Holidays;Valentine's Day	Valentine's gifts for teammates?	Personally, I don't like Valentine's Day even when I've been dating someone during that time. I'm not into it, therefore I don't really know what to do for gifts.      It's not my idea, but the track and field team I'm on is having a Valentine treat exchange. The captains of my event group made these little mailboxes with our names on them. We're suppose to put treats in everyone else's box. They're not very big boxes so it has to be small. They said they were either for if we made a gift or store bought something. I have no crafting ability whatsoever so it'll be store bought for me.      But I don't know what to get for gifts. The last time I gave anyone a Valentine was back in elementary school for the Valentine's Day party. That was over 10 years ago. I'm thinking just a little box of chocolates with a Valentine note (like the kind you give out in elementary) signed from me. Does that sound fine? I know some of the girls will do something really creative or crafty. Mine is hardly original but at least it's participating. Any thoughts or suggestions?

In order to show her how much I like her I go to church with her every sunday (hell I have nothing better to do).

20090202225813AAeeJVB	Society & Culture;Etiquette	My mom wants me to be chivalrous?	I'm a guy, and I am 17. Whenever I go to my Mom's family's house, my Mom always talks about how important chivalry is. Often, this gets put into practice, to the point where she makes me stand whenever a woman leaves the table, stand until every woman is seated and pull out their chairs.      Up until now I have done as she has asked. However, I don't agree with what she is doing. I believe that politeness and courtesy should be extended to everybody, not just women, and if I am expected to stand when a woman leaves the table, why shouldn't the women be expected to stand for me? I feel like I am expected to be a servant to the women in the family, rather than on equal ground, and I, quite frankly, feel degraded when made to do this.      What I would like to know is how to politely decline to do what my Mom wants me to, in terms of being chivalrous. How do I explain this to her and the people at the table without coming off rude, especially when I don't know if anyone else will be behind me on the issue?      I would rather not continue doing what she asks with my head down, as I feel this is not being assertive or true to myself, and would rather not feel uncomfortable because I have to do these things.      Any help and/or opinions would be greatly appreciated.

20090202231036AADt1mw	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Is There Really Such A Thing As An Individual?	distinguished by special, singular, or markedly personal characteristics; exhibiting unique or unusual qualities      We heard that every one is an individual but is that true?   Think about it. Our clothes, our lifestyle, house, sport choices and more all can be influenced by other people. If you were truly an individual then nothing would influence the way you live your life. If anything the only true individuals are the small number of tribes that have never had any influence from the rest of the world.      Even the people who create an individual piece of art will tell you they had influences from other people or even other periods of our history.   So what do you think? Is there so much influencing how we live our lives that individuality is more rare than we think?
20090202231138AA9qXGi	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Do you know why atheists ignore the importance of the messengers behind religions?	I asked the question before to the atheists  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...  , but they don't get it. They just repeat "God does not exist", "there is no fact", etc. instead of considering the facts.  Clearly, most if not all religions emerged after a man brought a new message with a notion of God and people rallied around this message. Yet, if you ask an atheist to explain why we have religions, he will ignore this. He will say people had fears of natural elements, etc., but not that there was a man with a positive message with a notion of God. This is amazing, especially when we consider that most of the times the message wasn't easily accepted initially, but met vigorous oppositions instead. This suggests that religions did not emerge from fear, but instead fear was an obstacle to these religions initially. Most importantly, it also suggests that there was a value to the message. People rallied around science because science brought something useful. That is the way it works. It was the same thing for religions. You might have small sects that rally a few people for a little time on the basis of fear, but no religion has been created that way. Why do atheists distort the reality? Is this something too much opposed to their belief?

20090202235908AANbXCc	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Do atheists ever wonder if they may be holding any other irrational ideas, now that they've rejected theism?	Only recently have I realized I am a believer in an irrational idea so bizarre that perhaps it explains why I never paid much attention to religion, and I can't shake this idea, even though I recognize it as insane: I've lived most of my life assuming that one person's opinion of me reflects the opinion of everyone else, and it's an idea that has a tyrannical influence on my life, leaving me distressed, paranoid, and alone. I've submitted to this idea my entire life, see myself as a victim, define myself by it, and though I see the way out, by taking each person as an individual and forgiving the strangers who've made assumptions about me based on their own self-hatred. But I still can't deny this god!?      Now, I'm not asking for advice for me personally, but wonder if anyone has ever analyzed themselves beyond mere atheism, and I wonder, since I cannot stop thinking this crazy thing, maybe, maybe this is how Christians feel, though I've rarely heard one admit doubt, that they actually can't shake their own personal irrational ideas which just happen to conform to Christianity.

20090203001058AAukRBI	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Has there ever been a homosexual that has successfully changed?	Now, I hear [some] religious people claim that people that were previously homosexual have been able to change and have heterosexual feelings (sometimes exclusively). I don't know about asexuality or really low sex drive or any other sexual "disorders" that have claimed to be changed.      Regardless, have you ever known anyone personally or heard from any source that you consider to be reputable that a previously homosexual individual changed (or vice versa)? It seems like the majority of people who ARE homosexuals say they cannot change, and I would assume that initially some of them spent a lot of time with counselors and psychologists over this "disease."      If it was proven that it could be changed then the idea that it is a sin would be a lot more credible.      I do have a question though about bisexuality. The Greeks and Romans seem to have been pretty sexual people. However, it is noted that it was not uncommon for them to have homosexual and heterosexual sex. There are guys today that would say that there is no way they would ever be able to touch another guy, let alone get any sort of sexual stimulation from such an encounter. Were the ancient Greeks and Romans just socialized to be this way, were they different, or has our society socialized most people to not be this way?

I answered a question earlier about having your heart broken, and it made me think...      I met a guy, years ago, and we fell truly and madly in love. We lived in southern CA at the time. Family problems called him back to Rhode Island. He had to go; I don't fault him that. If I was in the same position, I would have to go be with my family, too. So, I have no hard feelings about that. We stayed in contact for a while, but that just wasn't the same. Eventually, we just stopped all communications. I know if he hadn't had to go back to Rhode Island, we would still be together as I write this... that's 20 years later at this point.      Recently, I did a lot of searching and research, and I found him. I have an address where I can write to him. I don't have a phone number, though. I'm scared out of my mind to sit down and write that letter. I have no idea what he's been doing for 20 years. I just know that since him, I have never loved another as much as I loved William.

Acts 4:26-28 “The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers were gathered together, against the Lord and against his Anointed - for truly in this city there were gathered together against your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, along with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel, to do whatever your hand and your plan had predestined to take place.”      Predestination and free will are mutually exclusive.  How can man have free will if God's plan is predestined.?   Word games about choice and God being in all times simultaneously don't answer the question.

20090202234230AAMV1O7	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	People call me racist, and well I'm not too sure I'm not?	Here's the deal.  No matter what I'm not about white power, because every single one of my best friends has been hispanic or asian, but I often find myself getting in a lot of confrontations with black people.  Well, it's really black kids, I have no problems with black adults who grow out of that BET bullshit.  But anywho, I rarely get along with black kids, i mean theres a few I can stand, but most of em I just feel disgusted by.  I've always gotten in fights with them, or talked shot to them.  I can't stand the whole gangster attiitude after I moved from a pretty ghetto place to white suburbia and see these kids trying to act all hard.  Now i notice I start to feel that way at work, or anywhere, black people start to gross me out, and I automatically think poorly of them.  My thoughts are that the majority are far less intelligent, less ethical, and just all out inferior.  But then I think, I hate white trash just as much easily especially white kids who act like gangsters, so maybe I just hate the whole fake act crap but it's seriosuly 98% of black kids I meet act like this.  So what do you think?  Because really when I see intelligent black people I think absoluetly no negative thoughts, but lately it's more and more of them I start fights with and think very poorly of, like they aren't on my level.

20090203000935AAZGvrJ	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians, why are there a whole bunch of churches that accept homosexuals and homosexuality nowadays?	Your bible clearly condemn homosexuals, yet we see a whole bunch of churches that cater to homosexuals all over the US.  They even allow homosexuals to get married in their churches.  Noe. what does that imply?  Well clearly, the homosexual market is a pretty big one indeed.  And homosexuals are pretty wealthy.  And lets not forget that the churches' main focus is to collect as much money as they can.  By catering to the homosexual market, they accomplish just that!  It just goes to show that christianity is nothing but a busniess organization.  Just look at the wealth of the catholic churches and popes.  And we all know how much money they've used just to silence the scandals they've done with children.

I mean I gotta tell ya, coming from first person as a gay individual... I could not be more honest when I lay down the facts of my existence... And the vast majority of folks today in my age range (young) would agree with me... But with all the science and things we know about life... It seems there are so many people who are still running their mouths about stuff that has nothing to do with their lives and I often suspect those folks are likely to be caught by their wives with gay adult content on their computer. What it really boils down to is WHY are humans in many parts of the world so touchy on this? I DO NOT BUY RELIGION AS AN EXCUSE BECAUSE ANY MORTAL SIN IS MORTAL SIN but you dont see people panicking about shellfish or heterosexual having some college fun with their partners before marriage. Its safe to say that homophones are a SHRINKING MINORITY but im still shocked that they exist as much as they do.

20090202231653AAkQ7zV	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What Religion is the Truth?	My family was  catholic when i was younger but we would hardly go to church; then my family became pentecostal later on in life. We then went to church every Sunday it was fulfilling at the time, but there were many things i was taught  that i didnt see eye to eye on. Like the whole concept of the trinity. Now i find that i  don't know  what to believe in . I read all about different Religions such as Buddhist,Hindu,Juddisum, and Muslim all of which are beautiful religions but i just keep thinking that one must be true to me personally its between Christian and Muslim that sounds truest to me but at the same time i keep thinking what is really true we will never know only God knows the truth. What if all these religions are close to Gods words but have also been toyed with in mans hands. At the end who is to say what will be true and what will happen only God. The only thing we know is what the Bible or the Quran or which ever  book you may choose to think is your truth and have been taught to think is your truth by family influences etc.also we are not sure if man has changed the wording around for our own convience . Every one has a unique way of connecting to God. So therefore what is really real at the end us humans will never know because only God knows the master plan. So isnt better just to be a good person and believe without a religion but then without religion where would you get the knowledge from and know how to live rightgously. I am very confused!

20090202231725AATK30Q	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Did Almighty God wanted the family unit in the United Kingdom to be NON-EXISTING?	Does the family unit has any meaning anymore?    i am a US citizen. My ex wife is British citizen. I have two children. Several years ago, my ex wife's father passed away in the UK, and SHE WENT TO THE UK to mourn her father's death. She went back with my children with a return plane ticket for her and my children. My ex-wife stayed in the UK for over a year, and I thought she would come back to the USA. She did not and instead filed for divorce in the UK and got remarried. Her plan was to leave me for her boyfriend back in the UK when her father passed away because our marriage was an arranged marriage. I went through the USA children's affair and got legal representative . My ex wife would battle me with everything and she would do everything to prevent me from seeing my children. Las summer, the judge said there may be a possibility that the children can come to the United States to only visit, but my ex wife was adament against that. She got a cascaff involved in the case. The official UK male bashing organization against men. After battle the UK courts for 5 years, the UK judge rendered an order stating that I can never see my children again and I can not speak with them over the phone. He also said I can not appeal this decision. The basis of this decision is that the mother has manipulated my children to tell a UK CAFCASS social worker that they never want to see me again, and the judge complied with this. My son is 10 years old and my daughter is 7 years old. My ex wife married a fundamental muslim who is brainwashing my children, the UK courts just relinquished my of all human fundalmental rights as a father, and I feel my country the United States has betrayed me and has not done enough.      I pleas need help and I am in immense grieving pain. I feel as though the UK courts told me to think of my children as being dead because they wont let me call my children.       I never did anything to hurt my children and prior to this I had visited them several times through a court order and I was extra gentle and kind with my children , so this social report is fabricated with lies and deceit.      I m going to post this everyday until someone can help me...Ive called the media, an attorney, the district attorney's office, and left a message with my congress man. I am not giving up and I hope maybe someone reading this will give me good advice to get my children back      TO ALL WOMEN THAT HATE MEN OR SOMEHOW RELATE THIS STORY TO WHAT EVER EVENTS THAT HAPPEN IN YOUR LIFE THAT PROMPTS YOU TO LEAVE VERY HURTFUL AND NEGATIVE POSTS....I WANT TO REMIND YOU THAT MY INTENTIONS ARE NEVER TO TAKE AWAY MY CHILDREN FROM THEIR MOTHER..MY INTENTIONS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN TO HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH MY CHILDREN..I STILL STAND BY THIS... BUT THE EX WIFE DOES NOT WANT ME TO BE IN MY CHILDREN'S LIFE AND WILL LIE AND DECIET ABOUT EVERYTHING...SHE IS TELLING MY CHILDREN THAT I AM NOT THE FATHER AND HER NEW HUSBAND IS THE FATHER....I JUST WANT MY CHILDREN TO KNOW THEIR EXTENDED FAMILY ON MY SIDE OF THE FAMILY...MY CHILDREN ARE THE ONLY GRANDCHILDREN TO MY PARENTS AND MY FATHER IS LOSING HIS SIGHT AND I JUST WANT HIS TO SEE HIS GRANDCHILDREN BEFORE HE LOSES HIS SIGHT...

To stay or not to stay? to go or not to go? =\?	extremely difficult life choice I'm going through.      choices...should I go to SVD to train? or stay in California to do it?      Going to SVD Divine Word College, a college where a male person goes to train for humanitarian works in the future, after graduation.      I know for sure by observance of others there, going to will open up new horizons for any individual.  Additionally, I don't have to deal with environment factors such as: gas, money, job, the diffusion and usage of time; there in SVD, I can truely focus on developing my spirituality and intellect; I can reach new horizons and evolve ten and hundred folds...But part of me miss California, its people, its landscape and terrain, its seasonal rain, its falling of leaves in the autumn, its ocean side =(.  What a dilemna.      A solution I can think for myself that satisfies both sides to a mutal compromise is...attending SVD to train and then, I can still travel back and forth or to any anywhere I chose or chosen for me.

20090203012120AA1S9Zm	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Spiritually speaking, grey area surrounding a hypothetical situation of premarital sex?	Hypothetical situation:      A young woman (who is not married and has never had sex before) goes to a friend's birthday party. She consumes alcohol at the party, and without realising it she ends up drinking too much and passing out onto a bed in one of the bedrooms in the house. A few minutes later she wakes up, still half-drunk, and a guy who she had a crush on earlier (who is now as equally drunk as her) was taking advantage of her sexually while she was unconsciousness. He is still having sex with her - but instead of her feeling violated, sexually abused or telling him to go away - she instead pretends to still be asleep/passed out with her eyes closed and waits until he finishes, as she is enjoying the stimulation regardless of the circumstances.      Spiritually speaking, would the actions (or lack thereof) of the young woman be considered against the Bible in terms of premarital sex? Even though she did not consent to the sexual behaviour, she allowed it to happen without protest, although, the intercourse had already started by this stage anyway.

20090203010536AA5Fv9W	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Question To All Christians?	I am an Atheist American living in Cincinnati, Ohio. I was born and raised Atheist. I have taken religious classes and have read the King James Bible along with the Qu'ran/Torah. I know more about the monotheistic religions then most that consider themselves to be part of one. I enjoy having respectful discussions with people about what they believe, and I have some questions that I honestly am afraid to ask to someone in particular do to the fear of insulting them because that is not my intent. When I talk to people that follow the Christian faith, they call themselves Christians. Christians are people that believe that Jesus is Christ. I have been in several conversations with people that consider Christians and Catholics to be different. Why do people view it this way? I have had people refer to them as being different on numerous occasions; "I am not Catholic, I am Christian." What does this mean? It makes no sense and makes me think that they have not a clue about what Christianity means, thus they are not truly Christians. Please, what are they trying to tell me? That they are private Christians? Which means that they have no denomination, but they think Jesus is Christ? That also makes no sense to me ether. Please explain.....

Why, then, do so many Christian apologists try to smear Islam by claiming that "Allah" was a moon god on the basis that the word "illah" was once associated with pagan gods when the same can be said of "Elohim"?    http://www.htmlbible.com/sacrednamebible...

20090203022945AAT8YhR	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Do you agree that there's no free-will regarding the Holy Spirit's intervention?	The Holy Spirit, being a part of God, shares with Him the Omniscience. So when It intervenes It knows exactly the results of such an intervention. It must look like free-will in the believer's eye, but it's an illusion. There's complete knowledge of the future results on the Holy Spirit's part. It knows exactly how to act to obtain your belief, and knows before hand if through certain way of acting you would reject It or accept It.   Agree?

20090203002022AAVOuTU	Society & Culture;Languages	Help with learning Japanese?!?!?	Okay so I'm trying to teach myself Japanese (kind of like a New Year Resolution), and I'm wondering if I'm going about it the right way? I'm just starting so I only know about five words or so lol. I know the Hiragana, I wouldn't say I've mastered it but I've become really good at it. I don't know Katakana, but I'm going to start it soon now that I feel comfortable with Hiragana. But what do I do after I've learned Katakana? Do I start with grammar? Do I dip into Grade 1 Kanji? I've surrounded myself with Japanese (I have around twenty books from my local library!), but I just don't know where to start? How do they teach little kids in Japan? Help?! lol.

20090203010608AA7ZHAf	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Calling all Christians...?	If God is real and is watching over us, why does he do such a horrible job? War, disease, crime, either he's slacking or just doesn't care. I know, Adam and Eve stole an apple so God shoved it down their throat and said "too bad", but shouldn't all humans have a chance to choose for themselves? It doesn't seem fair to make all humanity suffer for one(or two) person's(or people's) mistake(s).      Christians say their god is the true god, completely disregarding all other religions, calling them "sinners", though there is no more proof of their religion over any other.      Most christians say homosexuality is a sin, yet does it not say, in the bible, that all humans were created equal? Why do christians see fit to persecute others for something they were born with?      There's no proof of god or any other supernatural being. There are supposed "signs from heaven" like jesus on a sandwich or his outline on a sheet, but I don't see it. But still people are devout and determined to believe.      Abortion. Yes, I know, it's not just the christians against it, and I'm more in the middle on this topic, but I just can't let it go. Some people just have bad luck. They get drunk, the condom breaks, forgot to take the pill, etc etc. There are many ways, but really. Isn't it just a fetus? It's not really life until it leaves the body, and even then, we kill intelligent animals to eat. I know how people are all over that "humans are intelligent beings" thing. Go to a NASCAR convention. You may change your mind about that "intelligent beings" statement. I suppose what I'm asking is: life is life, why do people insist on picking favorites?      Lastly, evolution. Christians shy away from the topic every time I mention it, saying God created all life and the world is only a few thousand years old. But can't scientists predict the age of the planet through carbon dating(I think it's called)? And what about fossils?       Well, that's all. Answer one, all, or none. I'd just like to get some answers from the christian community. I'm completely unbiased, but I have a bad habit of thinking so I don't exactly have much faith in organized religion.

I am a Mormon, about three years ago I met these two sisters at church at the same time and when I met them I had this overwhelming feeling that instant that I was going to marry one of them.   Then later I had a dream which a voice told me that one of them would not love me as much if my physical appearance were to change.  Then when I saw the one "I think I should" marry, a year later, again at church, we both came around the corner in the hallway and right when we made eye contact the lights flickered, exactly at that moment.  I have also had dreams of talking to her dad asking for permission to marry her and even the walk down the aisle and they have felt so real.  We have never really gone out, just hung out as friends but there is no denying there is a connection, I think we both have held off on dating because we wanted to better ourselves before we go out.  She is on a mission and due back in 7 months but I plan on leaving for a 2 yr mission in 4 months, should I write her?

It also contains a story of a guy burning his daughter to win favor from God.  That's sick!  Moses also teaches us in leviticus that we should burn animals after female periods and male discharges.  This was done because God like the smell of burning flesh and would cleanse or bless or whatever.  I know this is old testament but, do you believe this was true then?  Why do we believe in this book?   I don't think that gods inseminate girls (while they are hanging out with there boyfriends) or that burning people, beating slaves, making virgin girls marry and have sex against their will is right!?  Do you?  It's all biblical!  And it's all ...messed up!   Lets not condemn good people for being who they are just because someone wrote it in this book.  Good, American citizens (Gays and Lesbians) deserve every right that the rest of us have.  Including marriage.  I welcome your thoughts.

Question # 1 - For all those who go to heaven after they die in this world, are they blessed eternally equally or are there difference in level? Do all get the same reward in heaven?       Question # 2 - Everyone sins and some commit greater sins ( in human view, since all sins are equally bad in God's eyes ). If we ask God/Christ for forgiveness on Earth for the worst sins we have done and the most shameful sins we have commited, do we face punishment in the afterlife before going to heaven? (Example: God inflicts all the pain on you for 500 years before you enter heaven) Is going to heaven like going to the promise land? They had to wonder in the dessert before entering the promise land because they disobeyed him.       Good answer/both answer appreciated

20060701080944AAxenGk	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What religion am I?	I was once a Protestant.  I have at times described myself as an Atheist.   Neither of these really fit.      When I die my body parts will be given to those who need them, what’s left I hope will be clean enough to make good fertilizer.   My spirit will live on in those who remember me and will spread through the universe to become part of everything.      I believe our morality ought to be based on the good and evil inherent in the acts we are deciding, not on the promise of reward or punishment in the after life.      I am bother by the personification of God.  Too often, we credit god with human emotions and motives.  The concept of “Created in his image” does not fit well in my mind.      What little I know of Buddhism makes some since, but I have been looking more at the practical applications.  I do not know that much about the mystical side.

It's just funny when christians who supposedly follow and love a pacifist make up such ridiculous excuses for justifying killing. And then they accuse atheists of being immoral.

20060718110232AAjsiIo	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why do people say Jehovahs Witnesses are a cult?	We don't have a man that we have as a 'leader' as some say. The only one we follow is Jesus and he is not a man. What sound reason do you have for believing we are a cult. Nothing we do or say suggests it. Cult members often isolate themselves from friends, family, and even society in general. They use deceptive and unethical techniques to recruit members. Cult leaders are known to use manipulative methods to control the minds of their followers. None of this is associated with our beliefs and customs. Everything we do or say is from the bible. So why do so many say this?

I'm trying to be obedient spiritually and I won't give up, but WOW... I've never seen the manifestation of something take so long.  I won't be specific because I think the general principles apply: ask and it is given, seek and ye shall find; believe it and receive it, affirm it, the power of life and death are in the tongue, et cetera. Please give me some encouragement if you're familiar with affirmations. Thanks & blessings

20060721145315AA1wwTc	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Your comments please?	God is perfect.   God deliberately created the universe    Perfection entails the lack of needs or wants   Being perfect, God does not now nor ever has nor ever will have any needs or wants.   Deliberate creation entails an effort to satisfy some need or want.    Being a creator, God at one time had some need or want. It is impossible to have some need or want and also to never have any need or want.    Conclusion: God, if it exists, is either not perfect or has not created anything.    If God is perfect, then God can’t have any needs or wants; hence, God wouldn’t bother

Please read below	I was walking out of the store last night this guy asked me to sign a Petition in regards to Gay Marriage. My response Not my world. Not My Fight. Not my problem. Good luck. He says Given your history as a black man you should really be in our corner. It irratated me a lil, Slavery and genocide doens't compare to Gays not have political favor. I know that some gay people are beat up or killed but there is a law, Hate Crime and you go to jail for a long A** time if your convicted of this, there was no such thing as a hate crime when my great grand daddy was a kid. I don't walk around with slavery on my mind every day (he brought it up). For this guy to say something like that was rude and insulting. What every race fought for in this country doens't compare to Gay people trying to catch a tax break and to be tolerated. I don't hate yall but I don't care either it's not my problem or my business. Why would you tell me that given my history I would sympathise with your plight?

There is a rich history of gender varience worlwide since human history began.  However, recent medical history meant for Surgeons to feel safe performing Gender reassignment surgery, for those born in a body different to thier minds, they relied upon psychiatric assessment.  This was not just an assessment for sanity and to rule out mental illness.  Instead this was to classify and create obsticals before ANY treatment, including hormones etc.   Should gender varience be seen more similar to pregnancy.  A natural state in the real world, not in itself a medical condition, but may require medical intervention for help ?  Only informed opinion please, ie no religious ignorant reactionary.

I pray very hard for my parents and other family members who are not saved yet, asking God that they would find salvation.  However, in order for that to happen, I understand that I have to do my part.  But everytime God asks me to do something, I get scared and whiney saying that I can't do what he asks of me.  Even simple things, like talking to my parents, gets me down.  I have prayed about this, but nothing has seemed to change yet.  Does anyone have any comments that may help?  Everytime he asks me to do something I end up falling away, realizing that I can't do anything without Him, asking for forgiveness, and trying again.  Please Help!!

Noi maschi facciamo fatica ad accettare  l' evoluzione della donna moderna , e non vogliamo soccombere all' idea che forse le loro capacità  nascoste dall' egoismo dell' uomo del vecchio stampo 1940 1950  siano spesso di gran lunga superiori alle nostre  ed ora stanno emergendo creando seri problemi all' identità dell' uomo convinto di essere superiore ad ogni forma di vita femminile, tanto da sprofondare in atti di maschilismo estremo ed infondato.   Mi chiedo se non sarebbe ora di accettare la realtà , cioè che le donne non ci stanno calpestando , ma semplicemente dimostrando , che le palle le hanno anche loro , e che forse bisognerebbe dargli più spazio , al posto di soffocarle , la scusa che usano la loro vagina per fare strada comincia a non reggere più , che ne dite se noi maschi accettiamo , queste splendide creature come tali in ogni senso?

Today at my overnight shift job, the typical type of guy "Loud, raunchy, clown, as*hole" Well he was checking out a girl he said in front of me, since I was the only one there "That girl if fine..." stared at a distance. I couldnt see cuz I was in a aisle, I replied "oh really, I havent seen her..." (whatever) "Come look" and pointed with a nod. I looked and of course me being gay just said "Yeah she looks pretty..." I suddenly got the feeling that it was so plain and not convincing(Oh yeah forgot to mention, I havent said bout my sexual orientation to these butch stockers) but in the same time I dont lie. Yes pretty girl, and thats it. I felt this guy wanted to find out If I was "Super-Straight or something like that. Why mus this be the stupidest Straight Ice Breaker, to start a conversation. I get the freaking BIG feeling to say 'Im Gay!" shock the Shiits out of them. Not afraid of them. But I wonder If I should create fear, or misery in my part.

I mean I had this urge  to look at men's bodies since I was 9 years old, but didn't understand why, or what was that all about.

20061230091531AAeGztW	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Do you think poverty is an inherited disease?	Caused by alchoholism and everything else that stems from substance abuse.  I watched TV about a bunch of homeless people in New York eating at a shelter where the cook is a chef.  But i will tell you.  If you were locked up for twenty so on years and taking medicines for being locked up and as a kid to go to school. And arrested for being an alchoholic.      Do you think Mexicans pay taxes too?  I know this is trolling and being redundant maybe.  But    Mexicans don't pay taxes. Not even some of the business owners. They do but find ways to work around the system. After 20 years of being an alchoholic and in jail. I realized that i could hire them after early release. And live in Mexico.

20061230101509AASx6uV	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Need advice, please?	Hi, I'm a 35 yrs old gay man who trains daily and I know this trainer who is 18 (the adult legal age here in Colombia, south america is 18) and I like him a lot, but I don't know what to do, we clash often for little silly things, so I know we have the same big tempers plus he's very arrogant, but in the end he's a good person, the point is, I like him and I'm confused. A good friend told me that the trainer and I we'll end together because of the fights, is that cliché true? I don't buy it at all. I don't know what to do, he doesn't know that I like him, I started to analyze how we'll be if we were in a relationship but I'm very afraid to tell him even something, other good friend told me that I have to stop that feeling but at the same time take some risks and be prepared to take a no for answer if I go for it, I'm single for about six years and counting...   No lectures please, only receiving smart and mature advices please..
20061231061101AAQKyVr	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Help, I am confused?	I am confused.  I don't know how to tell people at work I think I am gay.  I hang out with younger men and have many feelings for them.  I try to hide them but its hard.   I have tried to date a woman but it didn't work out.  I feel all warm and tingly inside when I see a strapping young man.  People at work will surely judge me because I am in a male dominated, masculine profession.   Should I tell them, and how do I avoid conflict.  Should I stop going to the locker room and talking to them when they are changing even though I don't change there?   I am sure some people know, because I take all the young new guys under my wing and mentor them.  I have even mistakingly made moves on a few.

I flirt all the time at work and just get along really well. Lately I've been thinking about her non-stop. I don't know what it is, I've been dreaming about her every night for the last week and thinking about her all during the day.   So she calls me today and wants to go shopping. So I pick her up (she looks soo good). We talk about when we were in high school and stuff and then we get to the store. while shopping, I noticed she is extra touchy today. She keeps patting me on the shoulder. In another store we're walking down the isle and keep bumping into each other. I just wanted to grab her and hold her. It took soo much of me not to at least grab her hand. Earlier I said something and she said, "See, that's why I love..." and trailed off. Then when taking her home I gave her some cookies I made. I told her there was one in there that i made with her in mind. She saw it and said, "A Heart?
