My girlfriend has a crazy idea that if u place a cheese grader in an oven , it helps it not rust.      personally, i think she is too wussy to hand dry a cheese grader.      Then after about 4 dry cycles, of her placing it in our electric oven it begins to rust. and she claims it was not the oven, it would rust that way over time by its self regardless.      I personally believe that the metal of the cheese grader will expand in the oven, thus making the metal weaker and more vulnerable to rust.      but i would like a public opinion on this

I moved into a home that already had plenty of landscaping done, and one thing was a small hill alongside the top of the driveway planted entirely in daffodils...... diagonal rows of daffodils.  I like them and would like to keep them.  Every other row blooms at one time (pre-spring), then every other row blooms at another time (later in the year), so that half the daffodils at a time are in bloom.  There are a few bare spots and such that I'd like to tidy up, only I can't do anything without knowing what to buy that will match and bloom with the others, at the right time.  I haven't been able to nail down what's what.  They look to be trumpet daffodils and they are solid yellow.  Half of them are in bloom now; they bloomed halfway through February.  The other half, best I can remember, bloom at the end of the summer.  The blooms tend to last several weeks and they are very hardy flowers, nice size.  I'm in central Carolina, Zone 7b.  I do have photos if someone thinks they could identify them this way.  Can anybody help me nail down what to purchase to add to what's there?!?!
20090307183947AAVxuMI	Home & Garden;Garden & Landscape	Should I aerate my lawn or till it instead?	So, I have this lawn...ish. It's about 40% grass, 40% dirt, 20% vines and vine roots, and a 100% pain in the rear. I want to eliminate vine growth and grow a full, healthy lawn. I'm considering tilling the lawn and letting it rip the vines to shreds, but maybe that's a bit of overkill and merely aerating will be the way to go. Furthermore, the dirt isn't so much dirt as it is dirt-colored concrete, so either option would suffice just to open up the ground to let in some air and water...I think. Also, there are these weird shrubs that, according to my next door neighbor, used to be mere weeds but essentially turned into trees after a couple of years. I've cut them down, but the stumps remain and they have by far one of the most elaborate root systems known to man. Six of them line the side of the house and one is in the middle of the backyard, and it seems as if their root systems are all intertwined ( I followed a root from the one in the middle of the yard all the way to one of them on the side of the house ). So, clearly I have something of a veritable jungle to deal with ( I don't even want to mention the mountains of pine straw I had to rake up ). What would one of you green thumbs out there suggest I do?

Hi all,      I stayed a hotel recently and beer/bourbon was spilt on the white laminated kitchen bench surface over night by accident and it has been absorbed into the bench. The hotel is now trying to make me pay for it, surely there are products that could clean such stains? Could the use of a cleaning product with bleach in it remove the stains?      If you do know of such products, please name them and the main type of chemical used in the cleaning product.      Thank you.

It still manages to bear fruit but before, the flowers lasted much much longer.      It sort of looks sick and without the flowers, it's not a very pretty tree.   We have a grub problem that we are getting rid of (well whole Canada has them now) and there also tree fungus specially on maple trees.       The crabapple tree also has some brown-spotted leaves.      Maybe it's some infection, maybe it's the grubs. Idk, Anyone has an idea why and how to treat this problem?

I was clearing some VERY overgrown shrubs in my front garden today, after hacking it all down i discovered a hedgehog underneath it. i've left the roots in so as not to disturb it, and have recovered it with leaves and some of the branches which i had cut off the shrub. Is it safe to leave the hedgehog there, or should i move it back to an area with plant covering? No cars or people will be walking in the area, it is quite safe, and i'll not clear any more shrubs until he has woken up now.

20090307213306AAlvcYF	Home & Garden;Cleaning & Laundry	HELP Used to much laundry detergent?	Ok so I am a little slow apparently, I got my new ge HE top load washer, and read the quick one page instructions instead of the booklet and to me it looked like you could pour in all of the detergent and it would know how much to release, since you poured it through the top slots this seemed right, welllll I saw at the end of the bottle detergent coming out through the washer so I thought I crap I broke the washer in one wash, apprently it doesn;t work like that...so I told my husband and we put in on the rinse and drain cycle with nothing in it, so it would get everything out without making too many suds, when we first hit start you could see a lot of blue liquid come out and then it drained it, and we did this 2 more times but I haven't seen anymore soap come out other than the first time, and even though that seemed a lot it didn't seem like a whole bottle worth, so I'm not sure what to do, did I break my washer?  We ran it with a comforter and no soap and it did not get sudsy at all, so we're thinking we fixed the problem and should start fresh but I'm afraid that maybe we jammed it somehow and no soap is coming out b/c I broke it...sorry I'm goofy I hope that makes sense   thanks   jen
