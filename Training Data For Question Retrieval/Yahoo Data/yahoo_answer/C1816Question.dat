20090205173315AAx8Ihi	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Desktops	Speaker problems with Dell Inspirion 530?	Alright, here is the issue. My Dell Inspirion 530 comes with speakers. These have three cords-the one that connects them too each other, one that goes into a USB port, and a jack that goes into the light green colored hole. The problem is, no sound comes out. Now, when I go to the audio mixer bar, and click so I should hear that little 'ping' the green bar indicating a sound moves, but no sound comes out. It registers the speakers, when I plug or unplug them it says that a device has been registered/removed. However, when I have it set to speakers as default, nothing happens. If I plug in headphones, however, and set the headphones as default, everything works fine.    And one last useful note-when I have the speakers set as default, it registers the 'pings' as sound, but if I play a youtube video, it doesn't register any volume. Anybody at all have any clue whats going on? Thank you so much for your help, it's driving me nuts!

My PC won't boot up until my CPU fan slows down, there is no given time on when this occurs, sometimes it never slows, sometimes it does within a few seconds to a few minutes.  When I power on the pc, the cpu fan goes abnormally fast and is very loud.  My pc is at room temp (of course) when I boot it up, so it's not overheated by any means, and all the parts are clean and free of dust.  I ran a defrag, ran a scandisk, and several virus/adware scans to make sure everything is functioning as they should, everything but the start-up (power on). When I finally get it started (trial and error), no probs after that.  I'm lost...

My parents always ask what I'm doing. When I'm on the family computer they always look over my shoulder and if they have a question, then they ask another after another. It gets so annoying.

20090205174407AAvIHxL	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	Laptop power supply replacement?	Okay, I'm 99.9% sure that my power supply is causing my laptop's issues. When it's running on AC power, it's constantly freezing up and crashing. When it's running on battery power, though, it runs like a dream. This makes me think it's getting too much (or not enough) voltage from the power supply.      So my question is this: do I simply need to replace the AC adapter - the small black box with cables going to the wall and to the laptop? Or is there a component on the motherboard that possibly may be bad as well?      It's a Toshiba Satellite 205D, for what it's worth.

Relatively new laptop ... have it plugged in to my UPS (uninterruptible power supply) but I just noticed the battery is at 95%, down from 96% earlier today. It should be at 100% ... could it be because the UPS is kinda old and needs replacing??      I have the laptop running on battery power at the moment, and when it gets down to about 5% I will plug back in .... to a different (and new) surge protector. Am planning on buying a new UPS as soon as possible; I feel odd not using it.      SECOND QUESTION: can one surge protector (power strip) be plugged into another, or MUST it be plugged into the wall outlet? Sorry if dumb question.      Any thoughts? Thanks!

20090205183202AAkCBM3	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Other - Hardware	MY CPU USAGE IS 100%?  Why?	I have a couple questions.  Ok, first I want to ask about my CPU.  The thing ll of the sudden started running at 100% at start up.  I tried to toggle around but didn't have any luck.  I scanned and rescanned for viruses, malware, spyware...etc.  I have ruled out that possibility.  I have also disabled pretty much all of the start up programs as well as the AV.  That also didn't help.  In my task manager nothing is abnormal or abnormally high.  Also, my cpu is at 69/70 degrees Celsius.  I have a awesome case with 7 fans and a crazy cpu fan.      Can anyone think of anything else I can do?  oh yeah i have also unplugged all of my external hard drives and hardware..and you guessed it...it didnt help either.        The next thing has to do with my PF usage...it is at 250 mb.  I dont think it should be this high...right?  i have 8gigs in there.  i have 8 because i used to have a 64 bit operating system and never removed them.  In the 32 bit, xp is reading 3.        My final question has to do with my MOBO.  is it possible that my motherboard has gone to hell?  Could it be causing all of this garbage to happen?       Here are my system specs...

I cannot run two Firefox windows without having this issue.    Also, every hour or so, my computer will shut off randomly without warning.

My virus scanners have found nothing every time I have scanned.     Any help would be appreciated. Only post if you have useful ideas please, thanks. I am using two reliable virus scanners (and yes I know they're reliable, please don't make virus scanner suggestions.)    Thank you.

All of a sudden my phone line is giving the busy tone when it is picked up and gives the busy signal to any incoming calls. This only happens when my internet is plugged in as well. If I only plug my phone in and take the internet ethernet chord out, the phone works fine and has a dial tone.       Note: I have already tried unplugging everything and turning my modem back on which did not work. There is no static and I have the filter plugged in from the phone ethernet to the jack. I have an wireless ActionTec DSL Modem and my phone is also wireless. There appears to be no damages.       How can I fix this so that when I plug both internet and phone ethernet chords into the jack, my phone wont give the busy signal?

20090205190752AA1VyK1	Computers & Internet;Security	Please, computer experts, I need your help!?	This is the problem:      Whenever I search something on Google, the results have almost nothing to do with what I typed in (for example: I type in "youtube", the search results come back with all kinds of weird websites that have nothing to do with www.youtube.com - I have to actually type in "youtube.com" to get the website I'm really looking for).      Then, when I do get the results back from the search and I click on the link, I get redirected to some other web-page that isn't even remotely close to what the link is supposed to lead to.      I thought it was some sort of spyware, so I purchased 'Norton 360' and I run daily scans for viruses and spyware and it finds nothing.      I searched for help online through another computer and I've tried following the advice I receive on forums from computer experts and it still hasn't helped me.      Is there anyone on this forum that can help me, please? I really need some help, please and thanks. I appreciate any help/advice!   ______________________________________...      Some of the advice I've gotten that hasn't helped at all :      - Checking for "tdssserv.sys" under Device Manager.   - Checking for "sysaudio.sys" under Device Manger.
