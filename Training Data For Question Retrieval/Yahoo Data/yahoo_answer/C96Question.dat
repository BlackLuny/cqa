When I left my job, my option to keep my Insurance for a year would cost $1,300 a month for me and my family.  As we see more and more Americans lose their jobs and unable to afford health insurance, the crisis only grows.      If you don't believe we should have a government health care program that covers all Americans, what is your solution?
20090226100015AAhXWib	Politics & Government;Politics	So am a correct to assume conservatives look for candidates that appeal to certain groups of people,like holy?	rollers.  I live in a small Michigan town and the problem I see here for the conservatives is this blind way of thinking.  I can remember even as a child the preachers in the small churches here telling the whole congregation they had to vote republican.  If it is known that you support a Democrat in my town they think you !00% support gay's,  they think you are 100% against gun ownership, they think you want to abort all babies,  and they lay claim to being christians like they the "republicans" are the only people that are going to make it to the pearly gates.      Don't take this all wrong I am just being honest about alot of rural America.  If republicans want to win elections in the future this type of politics has to stop in my opinion.  You have to appeal to a larger group of people in this changing world, especially with the internet educating more people.

When I think of conservative, I am thinking of someone who is smart and careful and plans ahead and makes sure the necessities are done and planned for so that we dont handle things on a crisis management basis.  When I think of a conservative, I am thinking of a guy who says...you know what, we are likely to spend this much, so we are going to make sure we know exactly where that money is coming from..in fact, we are going to overestimate expenses and plan for a bit more revenue just to make sure the books balance.

I can't say that was always the case because I fell behind in the last few months of 2008.  I caught up my mortgage on my own and not asking help from anyone.   I called my bank to see if I could get help under the new bill a few days ago to get a more affordable payment plan.  I faxed the needed paperwork and was denied.  I was told the bill is misleading.  One, to be accepted.  You must of kept your mortgage paid on time.  Because I fell behind and was late on 2 payments by about a week each, I was disqualified.   I showed hardship due to medical bills and drop in hours at work.   Yet, it did not matter.  If this bill was to help those struggling, why can't we get help?

The Home Loan Restructuring bill was discussed for a couple of hours and the GOP and their Banster buddies hammered on Dems for the so-called home "cram down" law. Great for homeowners they hurt and bad for Banksters. This is a real fight and small, struggling homeowners deperately need this passed. GOP puppet politicians of Banksters are denouncing the new law and working hard for their Bankster donations and Bankster lobbyists.       Now, they are plumb tuckered out and are going home. The Home Mortgage Restructuring Act must be passed to save so many struggling homeowners in future months ahead in the very Depression the stinking Repugs had much to do with. They oppose anything that might help the working man. They work for Banksters and CEOs and continue to destroy the working man. I hope people link up and email and phone those suckers. Texas Rep Jeb Hensarling has to be the worst of the greedy politicians in the whole U.S. Congress.       Two kinds of crooks in congress, the oil politicians and the bankster/real estate politicians.

20090226110126AAyzwa3	Politics & Government;Politics	Not to belabor the point, can Republicans give specific solutions to fixing the economy other than tax cuts?	It seems like anytime a Republican speaks about helping to fix the economy, the only solution they offer is tax cuts, tax cuts, and more tax cuts.      And after taxes are cut, they want to cut more taxes.  What they don't seem to understand is that their tax cuts typically disproportionately benefit the wealthy over the middle and working classes.  Furthermore, tax cuts are only really stimulative when there is a surplus, which we haven't had in 8 years.  If people get lower taxes, they will pay off debt and save, which is good for them, but not so good for stimulating the economy since they won't spend money until they feel safe enough.      So other than tax cuts, what other solutions do Republicans have to helping to improve the economy?

20090226110026AAv8oiP	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	How do I bring attention to a situation?	In early 2008 I was out of work having had been laid off from a job I had. I had been out of work for a few months and I was loosing hope of finding another job. I looked on craigslist and found an add for something called product recovery. I went down to the location that they had given me and they hired me on the spot. the job was basically cleaning rail cars that had been filled with different types of flower at an ADM (Archer Daniels and Midland) mill. I started work and on the first day someone else who had been working there a week told me that another worker had quit telling him that they owed him over one thousand dollars. I didn't think anything of it because it was ADM the largest agricultural processing company in the United States. The next monday the other worker didn't show up. I was supposed to get a check that friday and they didn't have my money. The supervisor told me that it had to come with the owner who was driving down from Nebraska. To make a long story short I never received my wages. I tried to contact anyone who could help me; local news, law enforcement, legal aid but they all told me there is no law to protect me. A month later another worker arranged an interview with a local publication and he invited me to his house to be interviewed as well. When I came and I saw what he had turned up. He had the names of at least 30-40 other people who had been taken the same way in a six month period. That was just in the location I was at. They also ran the same scam at a Nebraska ADM mill. I also found out that there had been threats made to people who had made complaints. Everyone had gone through the same thing I did. We had all called ADM and they gave us all the same response, we don't care. That was early 2008. they started in 2006 or 2007. It is now 2009 and I just found another add for them today. Is there any way to alert the media. I tried the local media and they just said there was no money in there budget this year. I need help alerting the media or some kind of help alerting people of the scams that are going on. It is ridiculous that ADM the most successful agricultural processor is getting away with this and nobody cares.

The home secretary, Jacqui Smith, could still intervene by insisting that McKinnon should be granted immediate bail in the US and be allowed to serve any sentence in the UK. So far, she has declined to do so.      McKinnon's mother added: "When will the UK stop hiding behind treaty obligations to the US and let humanity, common sense and decency prevail? Perhaps one day the realisation of these decisions will dawn.      "We've suffered an agonising seven years which has ruined the lives and health of my family.

20090226123710AAxNWxS	Politics & Government;Politics	Should Pres. Barack Obama make high school education his priority, at least in Federal District Columbia?	President Obama made education a big part of his speech Tuesday night, complete with a stirring call for reform. So we'll be curious to see how he handles the dismaying attempt by Democrats in Congress to crush education choice for 1,700 poor kids in the District of Columbia.      The omnibus spending bill now moving through the House includes language designed to kill the Opportunity Scholarship Program offering vouchers for poor students to opt out of rotten public schools. The legislation says no federal funds can be used on the program beyond 2010 unless Congress and the D.C. City Council reauthorize it. Given that Democrats control both bodies -- and that their union backers hate school choice -- this amounts to a death sentence.      The Opinion Journal Widget   Download Opinion Journal's widget and link to the most important editorials and op-eds of the day from your blog or Web page.   Republicans passed the program in 2004, with help from Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, and it has been extremely popular. Families receive up to $7,500 a year to attend the school of their choice. That's a real bargain, given that D.C. public schools spend $14,400 per pupil on average, among the most in the country.      To qualify, a student's household income must be at or below 185% of the poverty level. Some 99% of the participants are minority, and the average annual income is $23,000 for a family of four. A 2008 Department of Education evaluation found that participants had higher reading scores than their peers who didn't receive a scholarship, and there are four applicants for each voucher.      Vouchers also currently exist in Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Ohio, Louisiana, Utah and Wisconsin. And school choice continues to proliferate elsewhere in the form of tax credits and charter schools. The District's is the only federally funded initiative, however, and local officials from former Mayor Anthony Williams to current Mayor Adrian Fenty and Schools Chancellor Michelle Rhee support its continuation. As Ms. Rhee put it in a December 2007 interview with the Journal, "I would never, as long as I am in this role, do anything to limit another parent's ability to make a choice for their child. Ever."      Ms. Rhee is working to reform all D.C. public schools, which in 2007 ranked last in math and second-to-last in reading among all U.S. urban school systems on the federal National Assessment of Educational Progress. Without the vouchers, more than 80% of the 1,700 kids would have to attend public schools that haven't made "adequate yearly progress" under No Child Left Behind. Remember all of those Members of Congress standing and applauding on Tuesday as Mr. Obama called for every American child to get some education beyond high school? These are the same Members who protect and defend a D.C. system in which about half of all students fail even to graduate from high school.      On Tuesday, Mr. Obama spoke of the "historic investment in education" in the stimulus bill, which included a staggering, few-strings-attached $140 billion to the Department of Education over two years. But he also noted that "our schools don't just need more resources; they need more reform," and he expressed support for charter schools and other policies that "open doors of opportunity for our children."      If he means what he says, Mr. Obama won't let his fellow Democrats consign 1,700 more poor kids to failing schools he'd never dream of letting his own daughters attend.

20090226112233AAdMaxB	Politics & Government;Elections	Is illegal immigration the biggest problem facing the US today?	I can't believe the duopoly in Washington continues to be inactive on this. In my opinion, this problem is much bigger than that of the economy, or divisive social issues like gay marriage or abortion (all of which can be decided by our own terms) because illegal immigration threatens the very sovereignty and survival of the country. An estimated half a million illegals come in each year, mostly from Latin America, with most being uneducated and unfamiliar with English. The massive drains on the environment, economy, law enforcement, and our social services is staggering. Take a walk around Fresno, parts of Los Angeles, or even Chicago. Those places simply are not melting pots and look more like slums in Mexico City. Bush had eight years to settle this and all he could come up with was a proposed guest worker program and an incomplete border fence; I have yet to hear Obama talk about this problem except in one minute sound bites. Do you think the only solution to this is to support the Minutemen Project and vote for third party candidates?

20090226134209AADPseH	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	I had a hospital bill of $879.00 that was sent to the wrong.?	address.  I had notified the radiology department that I was paying out   of pocket and would pay in cash at the time I arrived for the ultrasound.   Three months later, a debt collector informs me that I owe for an outstanding bill of $ 879.00.  I had already paid $708.17 when I arrived   at the facility for this test ? I was told this was in addition to what I paid ( no exact reason ).  I have since found out that the original bill   was mailed to the wrong address, and that the actual fees for the test   was the total of  $708.17 & $ 879.00 . Not only have they not appologized for giving me the wrong price when I told them it was out-of-pocket but they are threatening to sue me as well if I don't pay up.   Any advice here would be much appreciated. This is from a large   Medical Center. I do want to keep good standing with my credit and   the hospital but am very unhappy about the way this has come to be.   In addition, I have been informed that when a patient pays out of pocket, they are liable for the highest price the hospital charges for   such a test. I have a feeling they may have increased the bill on me   after realizing that they would not be getting more from an insurance   company. ( I don't know ? )... I can pay them but this will set me back   just another step closer to the "Red Zone" .

Fear of Obama drives gun stocks higher              Rising concern over increased regulation from the Obama White House has gun buffs stocking up on the latest tactical rifles and pistols. This helps the fortunes of gun makers Smith & Wesson (SWHC) and Ruger (RGR) as well as specialty retailer Cabela's (CAB), which specializes in firearms and hunting gear.      Ruger reported Tuesday that gun sales increased 81% in the fourth quarter on new products and "robust firearms demand." Its order backlog now stands at $48 million. Smith & Wesson plans to double revenue within the next three years and reported increased sales from "speculation on the outcome of the presidential election." Cabela's reported that same-store sales rose 2.2% over the holiday election season -- a time of great distress for other retailers

(Excerpt from Yahoo News)      The $634 billion down payment on expanding health care coverage would come from a $318 billion increase over 10 years in taxes on the wealthy, defined as couples making more than $250,000 per year and individuals making more than $200,000. The tax increase would occur by reducing the benefit the wealthy get on tax deductions. As one example, taxpayers in the current top tax bracket of 35 percent would see their tax deduction for every $1 given to charity drop from 35 cents to 28 cents.      The other half of the money for expanding health care — $316 billion — would come from curtailing payments to hospitals and insurance companies under Medicare and drug payments under Medicaid.

If you need to steal a necessity of life from somebody else using the government as your collection agent then it SHOULD be the lowest quality possible.  And in almost all cases it is.  So why should someone who didn't go to school, didn't get a good job with benefits, and now needs to sponge off the system get the same quality of care that I do?  Financed by me?

What are you people talking about when you blame the peeons for taking out loans when it is the banking cartels which not only sold people on the housing "confidence" and allowed these mortgages,    Are you stating the banking crisis is because people weren't forecasting the housing bust (Like so many of us were years ago and pointed it out to you--the same people who are now blaming the little people soley were saying then it was "doom and gloom".

20090226112150AADg4li	Politics & Government;Immigration	Can my parents still keep their green card?	In the past couple of years my parents (green card holder) stayed in US for about two weeks every half year. They had to take care of my grandmom back in China. Yesterday they were questioned by CBP regarding their permanent residency status, and was warned next time they may not be allowed entry with the green card. Because my grandmom's health status, it is unlikely that my parents would stay in US to keep the green card, so they are considering giving up the PR status. However, I learned that everything will start over if they later would like to reside in US. So I am wondering if there is any legal way to keep their card while they continue such pattern. And if there is nothing, then will they be assigned an immigration hearing next time they try to enter with the current green card or will they be simply sent back? And for the hearing, normally how long we need to wait for it (I assume they can stay with us while waiting for the hearing, please let me know if not)? My parents do have DL, bank accounts, realty property in US. Thanks in advance for your information.

20090225114334AA2zf4k	Politics & Government;Other - Politics & Government	Should the legislation that has nothing to do with the stimulus bill be taken out?	I understand that when sitting next to an almost trillion dollar piece of legislation, tens or 100's of billions of dollars add ons don't seem to look like much, BUT, if it has NOTHING to do with "stimulating the economy" shouldn't it wait for another bill?   Personally, I think bills should deal with one issue and one issue ONLY. NO earmarks or pork to get ppl. who would otherwise not say "ye" if that state did not get something extra programs for their states constituents. It is like bribery. NO, it is bribery.   Some of the things in this Bill are insane. I would say most, but that has more to do with my re-pub ideology. But to have a senator sign a bill, NOT because of the bill itself, but becaus they  gain something for their constituents is insane. Plus I think the EXACT same way when it is a re-pub bill. Their are many instances where senators/congresssman don't sign bills, NOT because of the meaning of the bill itself, but because of the money wasting earmark/pork add ons. Then ppl. will say ,for example, " well, they didn't sign a bill for support/kevlar for the troops", when in actuality they definitly would have. They didn't sign it because of the OTHER wastefull garbage pork odd ons in the bill!       What do you think.?. Bills dealing with ONE topic ONLY? These senators make alot of money. Would it be so hard and time consuming to deal with ONE topic at a time? THAT is what they are paid for. This wasrefull shorcut costs billions of dollars and I am sick of it. On BOTH sides.   Examples   Bills on money for schools...THAT"S IT!   Bills on money for enrgy efficiency...THAT"S IT!   Bills on money for military helicopters...THAT"S IT!   Do you see where I am going with this? ONE topic and ONE topic at a time. That way a senator KNOWS EXACTLY what he/she is voting for and cannot be accused of voting or NOT voting for something. It is clear cut. What do you think. ALso can you name other wasrefull add ons or pork you have heard of in this or other bills?

I am helping someone who is mentally disabled but not enough to be put in a home. They just dont understand the math or banking and or fraud system. They ordered something that was on line and found out later it was a fraud.(took out of account right away and keeps doing it when there was suppose to be a trial period of 30 days and took out 3 days later) The bank keeps crediting it then taking it back. Also they let the company who is fraudlant keep taking out of their account monthly. I asked them if they did a stop payment and the couple said yes(i can not go with them to the bank since off privacy rights I am just a neighbor), They need an advocate to go in with them to get this straightened out. Is their an agency they can go to to help them? Thanks

"Insurgency, we understand perhaps a little bit more because of the Taliban," Sessions said during a meeting yesterday with Hotline editors. "And that is that they went about systematically understanding how to disrupt and change a person's entire processes. And these Taliban — I'm not trying to say the Republican Party is the Taliban. No, that's not what we're saying. I'm saying an example of how you go about [sic] is to change a person from their messaging to their operations to their frontline message. And we need to understand that insurgency may be required when the other side, the House leadership, does not follow the same commands, which we entered the game with."       http://www.politico.com/blogs/glennthrus...

20090226142532AA10VSR	Politics & Government;Politics	What do you think of Obama replacing the term "War on Terror" with...?	a War Against Extremism? In his speech, Obama spoke about a War against Extremism. So I guess now Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity are the enemy! Or is it Bill Ayers, NCLR, Rev. Wright and Rev. Sharpton?       http://www.plnewsforum.com/index.php/for...           Shevat 8, 5769, 02 February 09 01:34       by Malkah Fleisher          (IsraelNN.com) As part of a new campaign to reach out to the Arab world, newly inaugurated United States President Barack Hussein Obama is dropping the phrase “war on terror” from the U.S. diplomatic lexicon.          The catchphrase, which was introduced to America after the attack on the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, is being replaced as Obama’s new administration works on raising the U.S.’s esteem in the Muslim world and distancing itself from George W. Bush’s policies in Iraq and Afghanistan.  The phrase “war on terror” has become associated with anti-Islamic or anti-Arab sentiments, according to national security analyst Anthony Cordesman of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington in statements to the Associated Press.          Instead of fighting a ‘war on terror’, the Obama administration will fight a war against ‘extremism’.

I held it together until we walked out of the funeral home and saw my whole department standing at attention. It brought the heavy tears and shoulder shakes (smile). The procession of cars to the funeral was beautiful but I was caught off guard at the cemetery when they had the Last Call. It was a call dispatch made to all St. Louis officers for OUR detective. It started off with the officer in need of aid call and if you are familiar with it its something you pray you never hear day in and out. I broke down in tears knowing it was the last call my detective would ever get and never respond to. Was just curious if anyone had ever heard that call as well.       Much love to all civil servants you have my greatest respect!!!!

We also all know that America is currently in a recession. When Franklin Delano Roosevelt was in office, America had the same problem, only much worse.   Now we know that Obama and FDR both were Democratic, but other then that, do you think there will be similarities to their terms? But the thing that boosted our Economy during FDR's term was a World War. Do you think that a bigger war, not the crises in Iraq, will occur? Will History repeat itself? They say if you do not learn from history, it is doomed to repeat itself. Do you think we have to now face this crises once more?

20090226152754AA4QC8p	Politics & Government;Elections	Are the Republican Congessmen kidding?	First, I am an independent voter and would never consider being a republican or a democrat. Too partisan. Too extreme. I am amazed at the republicans (democrats as well)  who sat on their duffs for 8 years while the Bush administration DOUBLED our national debt from 5 trillion to 10 trillion dollars. They also approved the Bush administration 700 million dollar bailout without a whimper. Now they refuse to support Obama's 800 million dollar stimulus plan which is much more transparent, as "too expensive""too much big government".Finally, they take on his budget proposal as "too much spending" I don't know if Cbama's plan will work, but I will hope and pray that it will, because it;s the only ballgame in town. You would think that the republicans would be willing to admit that they were instrumental in getting us into this mess and offer some bipartisan support.The republicans like to label the democrats as "tax and spend"  I label the Bush/republicans as "don't tax and spend more"        Your thoughts?

Or do you lie and say that you did not kill the person.      and      Do you tell a psychiatrist if you have killed somebody? Do they have to tell the police that you killed somebody with a knife, or do they have to keep it 100% confidential?

Do you think the VP of the USA should have his facts straight before he speaks?         Reality check for Vice President Joe Biden      Posted: Feb 25, 2009 07:19 PM EST          SHREVEPORT, LA (KSLA) - Giving the republican response to President Obama's speech Tuesday night, Governor Bobby Jindal pointed out fundamental differences in how republicans and democrats see the economy. "But what I don't understand from Governor Jindal is what would he do?," asks Joe Biden while on the Early Show.           And That rhetorical question to Governor Jindal on the Early Show, was followed with this. "in Louisiana there's 400 people a day losing their jobs, what's he doing?" asks Biden.           But that claim is wrong, if you look at the numbers from the Louisiana Workforce Commission. "In December, Louisiana was the only state in the nation besides the District of Columbia, according to the national press release that added employment over the month," says Patty Granier with the Louisiana Workforce Commission. According to her, not only is Louisiana not losing jobs. "The state gained 3,700 jobs for the seasonally adjusted employment," Granier said of the most recent figures.            You don't even have to take my word for it, these are number you can check out yourself if you just go to laworks.net, there you can find the latest unemployment statistics, statistics that appear to directly contradict what the vice president said this morning.

They said we had to do this to get the economy going again right? That was the point of this governmental effort right?

Spend 400 Billion (previous admin), Spend 800 Billion on stuff that has nothing to do with the above, 800 Billon without getting credit flowing as was the intent of the “Bailout” which became a “Stimulus Package” which is now a “Recovery” Bill. Rhetoric. Then come back to us and say we need another 400 Billion. Through out it all Obama says       No, earmarks, No pork, no lobbyist, Cut spending, spend responsibly; do not spend what you do not have.       Fiscal irresponsibility summit, Cut the deficit, End Debt        Then President Obama put a $4 trillion price tag on new budget   a whopping $1.75 trillion more than the President expects the government to raise in revenue, creating the largest federal deficit in real dollars since the country was fighting World War II.      among other things the Budget Bill  that the house passed yesterday contains about 8,500 pet projects totaling nearly $8 billion.      Democrats, have a chance to seriously upstage the GOP and show liberal genius, but instead are insisting on not opposing bad ideas. Instead embarrassing yourselves by blaming Bush, why?       The spending Obama and the left is doing is their choice now, this spending is on Obama, and he has far surpassed Bush with his reckless spending.       Bush’s Fault? For the people by the people, what about congress? Who has had the majority when the Bailout was drafted and passed?       and who has it even still now?

It would open a market in the US for illegal gun running that would only add to the violence.      plus, the states with the tighter bans on firearms have a higher murder rate so it clearly doesn't really do anything but piss off people who want to own or collect guns... this is why I LOVE living in NH!      ... even though it has been overrun by Liberals from Massachusetts and Vermont...       but anyway.... why do some democrats think we should get rid of guns, specifically assault rifles?

(and I'm not kidding)  .... read on.... you need to know this stuff because you are paying for it....    The spending has just begun and THE REASON GIVEN BY THE DEMS IS THAT GEORGE BUSH TIGHTENED THE BUDGET TOO MUCH     -----   House Approves $410 Billion ‘Omnibus’ Spending Bill (Update2)       Feb. 25 (Bloomberg) -- The U.S. House voted to    1) boost spending on domestic programs by 8 %,    2) 2) ease restrictions on travel to Cuba,   3)  and kill a school voucher program in Washington, D.C., (Personal comment:which, by the way keeps DC poor children from getting a scholarship to go to a PRIVATE SCHOOL and mingle with O's princesses').    The “omnibus” bill is supposed to fund federal government for the next 7 MONTHS. Democrats said the spending increase, on top of a $787 billion economic stimulus package signed last week, WAS NEEDED TO MAKE UP FOR TIGHTER BUDGES DURING THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION.    “Republicans criticized the spending increase as unaffordable while the government is projected to run a deficit topping $1.2 trillion. They also said the bill contradicted President Barack Obama’s pledge to rein in the federal defic   The Consumer Product Safety Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission would get 31 % funding increases,    while the Food and Drug Administration’s budget would grow by 19 %    The budget for the House of Representatives itself would increase by 10 percent while funding for Senate operations would grow by 8 percent.    Out of that 410 BILLION, the legislation also includes almost $8 BILLION for  8,500 CONGRESSIONAL PET PROJECTS also known as EARMARKS, according to the Washington-based Taxpayers for Common Sense.    Among the earmarks are    $200,000 for “Tattoo Removal Violence Prevention Outreach Program,” pg. 283;   *Maine lobster earmark in the omnibus, pg. 173;    *$5.8 million earmark for the “Ted Kennedy Institute for the Senate…for the planning and design of a building & an endowment,” pg. 232;   National Council of La Raza, $473,000 earmark from Sens. Bingaman and Menendez,   $1.8 million for swine odor and manure management research in Iowa,    $2 million to promote astronomy in Hawaii and    $381,000 for music programs at New York City’s Lincoln Center.    The bill is H.R. 1105.      The above information was taken from:       http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=2...       and       http://michellemalkin.com/2009/02/23/900...

The EXACT words of the sign are "Get a white gumball, win a free large pizza"   So my friend got a cracked one. It was a little les than have green, and the rest of the "shell" was cracked off, so it was WHITE.   We brought it up to the counter and told them we should win because the sign didn't say it had to be FULL white. They said no, because it was originally green. We argued that fine, well it's a defetive gumball, so we should at leaast get a gumball.   We were in there argueing at least an hour (dont ask.. haha. we were bored.. we were having fun arguing with the people that work there)   Anyway, we want to go back in there tomorow and try to convicnce them that they are wrong, and the cheated us out.

They are allowed to make little choices. In male ones, many are repeatedly raped and fights are not uncommon. They are dominated and undermined. Worst yet, in my opinion, are the bathrooms being entirely out in the open. The police may claim this is to keep surveillance but if that was really the case, they would just bug the restrooms. I feel that the toilets are put in plain sight to take away the being’s sense of privacy. They are meant to feel that nothing is secure. They are treated like animals.   I understand the purpose of prison, but after spending time there, I would think the criminal would only become worse due to trauma.      What do you think?

If McCain would have smoked crack, paled around with terrorist, and been involved in shady business dealings… he would have been kicked off the campaign trail.       I am not a man who minces words and we all know the only reason he got in is because him being black and the DNC wanted to appear to be racially sensitive. The only problem with that is that more often then not you end up with sub par people in the places of real power.      What do you think?
20090226162551AAnAdDE	Politics & Government;Other - Politics & Government	How long will it take to get Obama impeached?	He already showed he is not up to the job by pushing through a trillion dollar boondoggle that wont be repaid for at least 40 years, long after he is gone. His own people admitted that Obama’s and only Obama’s “New Deal” will have us in the red by two trillion by the end of the year. You cant blame that on Bush.
20090226162802AASSLYE	Politics & Government;Other - Politics & Government	Anybody seeing Obama turning the nation into a police state?	Everyday you see on the news where someone goes to jail for saying something unflattering against him. Yet the DNC says nothing when people were tearing up Bush. Me thinkst this stinks of Socialistic favoritism.       What say you?
20090226162904AAMYYSt	Politics & Government;Other - Politics & Government	Do you think we are going to have a Republican majority in the Congress next election?	With the DNC’s numbers crashing to earth around them, do you think it would be enough to turn our victory next election into a Super Majority instead.       What say you?
20090226165603AAzvwbY	Politics & Government;Other - Politics & Government	Pledge of Allegiance?	Pledge of Allegiance   I pledge allegiance to the flag   of the United States of America   and to the Republic for which it stands,   one Nation under God, indivisible,   with liberty and justice for all.   The U.S. Ninth Circuit Court recently ruled that because the pledge contains the words “under God,” requiring   school children to recite the pledge is a violation of the U.S. Constitution’s First Amendment mandate of separation   of church and state. Discuss how you feel about this, remembering that many of your friends and neighbors and   other delegates may have different ideas and beliefs.   The Pledge of Allegiance has not always contained the words, “under God.” When and why were they added? Do   you think that if the words “under God” were omitted, students should be required to say the pledge? Do you think   that your parents or grandparents might feel differently? Why or why not?

My Criminal Justice class is visiting prisons in Nashville in about a month and I plan on going. We sill tour the cell blocks, talk to a death row inmate, and see the electric chair. What is the experience like. I think I would be so sick, that I'd throw up or even feel like crying from the miserable atmosphere and life it must be like. I'm not scared to go, but it has to be an overwhelming experience. What should I wear when I go their, I'd like to wear a huge jacket with a hood, if I get to overwhelmed and want to hide my face. Thanks for any help you can give me! Feel free to tell me any experiences you might have had visiting or staying if you have had to.

20090226165316AAUM6TD	Politics & Government;Immigration	Should I renew my toddler's passport because of his picture?	We got a passport for my son when he was just 3 weeks old.  He's now 19 months and looks nothing like his newborn picture.  Not even the eye color matches (went from gray to blue).  Should I renew his passport with a current photo?  We're traveling overseas soon and I don't want it to be a problem that his identification doesn't resemble him one bit.

I don't think it's that simple, so please explain the circumstances!

20090226103605AA8nHi8	Politics & Government;Politics	I am outraged a Military Recruiting Center opened up in my town, Will my plan work on getting them shut down?	I live outside seattle wa, and a few weeks ago a recruiting center opened up. I dont want them here, they should not have come here, they dont belong here, and they need to leave. They brainwash our youth and both wars are illegal.      In my neighborhood there is a 19-year old kid, he did not graduate high school and on pot.      I was thinking of wiring him up and sending him in, see if they tell him to get a phony diaploma and teach him to trick the drug test. i heard some recruiters do this. Then i can take the evidence and shut them down.      Maybe i will save a foreign baby and save a young man from ruining his life.

20090226164511AACAtpU	Politics & Government;Government	Do you think 9/11 was an inside job?	I used to think people who believed this were unAmerican, left-wing, nut job conspiracy theorists, but I've been enlightened and stand corrected.  I'm wondering how many of you out there have woken up to this fact and how many are still "in the dark" so to speak.      This is my favorite video series that provides undeniable proof:    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwayjX4ip...    Please watch all 10.      Secondly, do you believe the worldwide economic crisis is an intentional plan for the Elite to come together and create a New World Order?      I must admit, ever since I've gotten into this, I've suffered great grief and mourning over the 'death' of trust in my government & the belief that they're protecting us and our rights...we are their slaves.  I've been through every stage of grief:  denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and now I'm finally able to accept the fact and DO something about it.      It all makes sense to me.  I mean, after all, Jesus said that "Satan is the god of this world" (2nd Corinthians 4:4).  I can't help but think of the movie "The Matrix" sometimes.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pCPvJ8Py...    Please don't watch any of these videos unless you are prepared to see "just how deep the rabbit hole goes".  Remember, all I'm offering is the truth...nothing more".      Other videos I think everyone should see:    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dmPchuXI...     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pD8viQ_Dh...  (2:20)    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uu7Adt5Z...
