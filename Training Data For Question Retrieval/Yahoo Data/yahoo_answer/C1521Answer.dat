fDGlC403aa	Q: Was Carroll on drugs when he wrote the Alice books, or are the books about drugs?<br>  <br>  A: No. Carroll did not use drugs while writing the story. The larger part of the story was invented when he was on a boat trip with a friend, the real Alice and her sisters. He invented it while they rowed. The drug rumor was first spread in the 1960's by supporters of the then new LSD subculture. The rumor is believed to have originated from the psychiatrists who introduced LSD into our society.<br>  <br>  Some people insist that one has to be on drugs to write such a creative story. But why shouldn't someone have a creative mind of his own?<br>  <br>  If Carroll was on drugs, the Alice books would probably be a series of rambling, disconnected, surrealist scenarios. But the Alice books are far from random. They contain some very intricate logic problems and very clever puns (not to mention Alice's journey in "Through the Looking-Glass", which follows the moves of a chess game), that could only be the work of a sharp mind in full control of its abilities. Furthermore, you'll find the same style of writing in the magazines he wrote in his youth, his various poems, stories, and other writings, and especially in the letters he wrote. If the Alice books were drug induced, the rest of his voluminous output would seem to suggest he was on drugs 24/7.<br>  <br>  There is indeed one part in the book that may describe the use of drugs: the hookah smoking Caterpillar who advises Alice to eat from the mushroom. But with the story Carroll made fun of all aspects of society, and it may be possible that he was just reflecting the age with this part (note that this chapter wasn't even part of the original story, but was added later!). In the Victorian era there were no drug laws like we know them. Opium, cocaine, and laudanum (a painkiller that contained opium) were used for medicinal purposes, and could be obtained from a pharmacist. Mind that LSD was not even invented yet!<br>  <br>  So in Carroll's days it was not uncommon to experience the effect of being 'high', whether or not accidentally. However, it was definitely not Carroll's intention to write a book about drugs: he wanted to entertain a little girl whom he loved. No evidence has ever been found that linked Carroll to drug use. Even in his diaries, Carroll has never made any reference to the use of drugs.|`|yqUgRG2raa	I read that someone who went to the church of the author, knelt down at the alter and as that person arose, he saw an image of a cat in the artwork which you couldn't see normally.

He was a bachelor and very lonely.  He loved children, especially little girls, but I don't think he was a pedophile or anything like that.  He was an amateur photographer and he did do some nude photos of little girls but that wasn't considered a great crime in those days as it is now.<br>  <br>  Alice in Wonderland, and even more, Alice Through the Looking Glass, are explorations of altered reality.  This kind of thing was very common in those days. The Wizard of Oz is another good example.  There was a LOT of kiddie lit in those times like this, but most of it not as good.<br>  <br>  Opium and morphine were legal then, you could buy them at any drug store.  And a lot of people did them without realizing how dangerous they were.  So it's possible Carrol had done them, but he couldn't have been a serious addict because he held down a responsible job and wrote lots of books, not just children's books.<br>  <br>  Most of the creatures in Alice in Wonderland are plays on words.  We lose the humor because we don't use those figures of speech anymore--mad as a hatter, grinning like a Cheshire cat, etc.  Much of it is just playing with free association, being imaginative.<br>  <br>  ----<br>  <br>  I just looked at the previous responses.  LSD?  Come on!  LSD wasn't invented until 60 years after Lewis Carrol was dead!|`|FxAD44Moaa	first of all.. have you read the book really?<br>  <br>  <br>  the book..    well here's the clue.. it's not about drugs.. it's about sexual abuse.

My best advice to you would be to stop considering these people as your friends and just consider them as people you associate with to help make the day go by faster. You say they don't listen, call or want to hang out with you then they aren't your friends.  <br>  <br>  I've been in that situation where I've felt that if I don't put up with these "friends" then I won't have any friends and that's a bad feeling.  Be the nice person you are and count down the days until you leave that place because once you leave there you have a whole world of new people to meet.  I left hs and my home town and now I have a group of people that I really like and that understands me.  Good Luck!|`|A7O8MeETaa	What would make people dislike you?

We do not have a problem giving some blood for testing purposes. The bible condemns the eating of blood. Here is some info to support that belief:<br>  <br>  Long but very thorough...<br>  <br>  Blood<br>  Definition: A truly marvelous fluid that circulates in the vascular system of humans and most multicelled animals, supplying nourishment and oxygen, carrying away waste products, and playing a major role in safeguarding the body against infection. So intimately is blood involved in the life processes that the Bible says “the soul of the flesh is in the blood.” (Lev. 17:11) As the Source of life, Jehovah has provided definite instructions regarding the use to which blood may be put.<br>  Christians are commanded to ‘abstain from blood’<br>  Acts 15:28,?29: “The holy spirit and we ourselves [the governing body of the Christian congregation] have favored adding no further burden to you, except these necessary things, to keep abstaining from things sacrificed to idols and from blood and from things strangled [or, killed without draining their blood] and from fornication. If you carefully keep yourselves from these things, you will prosper. Good health to you!” (There the eating of blood is equated with idolatry and fornication, things that we should not want to engage in.)<br>  Animal flesh may be eaten, but not the blood<br>  Gen. 9:3,?4: “Every moving animal that is alive may serve as food for you. As in the case of green vegetation, I do give it all to you. Only flesh with its soul—its blood—you must not eat.”<br>  Any animal used for food should be properly bled. One that is strangled or that dies in a trap or that is found after it has died is not suitable for food. (Acts 15:19, 20; compare Leviticus 17:13-16.) Similarly, any food to which whole blood or even some blood fraction has been added should not be eaten.<br>  Only sacrificial use of blood has ever been approved by God<br>  Lev. 17:11,?12: “The soul of the flesh is in the blood, and I myself have put it upon the altar for you to make atonement for your souls, because it is the blood that makes atonement by the soul in it. That is why I have said to the sons of Israel: ‘No soul of you must eat blood and no alien resident who is residing as an alien in your midst should eat blood.’” (All those animal sacrifices under the Mosaic Law foreshadowed the one sacrifice of Jesus Christ.)<br>  Heb. 9:11-14,?22: “When Christ came as a high priest .?.?. he entered, no, not with the blood of goats and of young bulls, but with his own blood, once for all time into the holy place and obtained an everlasting deliverance for us. For if the blood of goats and of bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkled on those who have been defiled sanctifies to the extent of cleanness of the flesh, how much more will the blood of the Christ, who through an everlasting spirit offered himself without blemish to God, cleanse our consciences from dead works that we may render sacred service to the living God? .?.?. Unless blood is poured out no forgiveness takes place.”<br>  Eph. 1:7: “By means of him [Jesus Christ] we have the release by ransom through the blood of that one, yes, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his undeserved kindness.”<br>  How did those who claimed to be Christians in early centuries?C.E. understand the Bible’s commands regarding blood?<br>  Tertullian (c. 160-230?C.E.): “Let your unnatural ways blush before the Christians. We do not even have the blood of animals at our meals, for these consist of ordinary food. .?.?. At the trials of Christians you [pagan Romans] offer them sausages filled with blood. You are convinced, of course, that the very thing with which you try to make them deviate from the right way is unlawful for them. How is it that, when you are confident that they will shudder at the blood of an animal, you believe they will pant eagerly after human blood?”—Tertullian, Apologetical Works, and Minucius Felix, Octavius (New York, 1950), translated by Emily Daly, p. 33.<br>  Minucius Felix (third century?C.E.): “So much do we shrink from human blood, that we do not use the blood even of eatable animals in our food.”—The Ante-Nicene Fathers (Grand Rapids, Mich.; 1956), edited by A. Roberts and J.?Donaldson, Vol. IV, p. 192.<br>  Blood Transfusions<br>  Does the Bible’s prohibition include human blood?<br>  Yes, and early Christians understood it that way. Acts 15:29 says to “keep abstaining from .?.?. blood.” It does not say merely to abstain from animal blood. (Compare Leviticus 17:10, which prohibited eating “any sort of blood.”) Tertullian (who wrote in defense of the beliefs of early Christians) stated: “The interdict upon ‘blood’ we shall understand to be (an interdict) much more upon human blood.”—The Ante-Nicene Fathers, Vol. IV, p. 86.<br>  Is a transfusion really the same as eating blood?<br>  In a hospital, when a patient cannot eat through his mouth, he is fed intravenously. Now, would a person who never put blood into his mouth but who accepted|`|NFK3A68oaa	Jehovah's witnesses don't believe in eating blood, either through the mouth (as in blood sausage or unbled meat) or intravenously (through blood transfusion), because the bible prohibits that for Christians at Acts of the Apostles (or just ,"Acts") 15:28, 29:<br>  <br>  " For the holy spirit and we ourselves have favored adding no further burden to YOU, except these necessary things, 29 to keep abstaining from things sacrificed to idols and from blood and from things strangled and from fornication. If YOU carefully keep yourselves from these things, YOU will prosper. Good health to YOU!”"<br>  <br>  They have no objections to giving blood for laboratory use, such as AIDS testing.   In fact, my wife and I were encouraged (and the law required) to have a thorough blood test before marriage for safety's sake, and in case of dishonesty of the fiancé, which we were, of course, glad to do.<br>  <br>  Best regards,<br>  Michael|`|gASz3hDWaa	Blood testing is no problem. It is the transfusion of blood into the body. Since Jehovah's Witnesses have marital sex so it is a matter between husband and wife. The mate would take every regard for the safety of his/her spouse.<br>  AIDS is not usually something Jehovah's Witnesses normally contract since they shun promiscous sex, recreation drugs of any sort and refuse blood transfusions. The chances of a Jehovah's Witness having AIDS is either by working in a hospital, rehabilitation or hostel with AIDS patients and being accidently infected. Else an already AIDS infected person became one of Jehovah's Witnesses.

vhlORK4Waa	Scientology is a money  making dangerous cult. <br>  The Church of Scientology is a vicious and dangerous cult that masquerades as a religion. Its purpose is to make money. It practices a variety of mind-control techniques on people lured into its midst to gain control over their money and their lives. Its aim is to take from them every penny that they have and can ever borrow and to also enslave them to further its ends. <br>  <br>  It was started in the 1950s by a science fiction writer named L. Ron Hubbard in fulfilment to his declared aim to start a religion to make money. It is an offshoot to a method of psychotherapy he concocted from various sources which he named "Dianetics". Dianetics is a form of regression therapy. It was then further expanded to appear more like a religion in order to enjoy tax benefits. He called it "Scientology". <br>  <br>  Scientology is a confused concoction of dangerously applied psychotherapy, oversimplified, inapplicable rules and ideas and science-fiction drivel that is presented to its members (at the "advanced" levels) as profound spiritual truth. <br>  <br>  The results of applying their psychotherapy (called "auditing") is to weaken the mind. The mind goes from a rational state to an irrational one as the delusional contents of the subconscious mind are brought to the surface and are assumed to be valid. It also makes a person more susceptible to suggestion since it submerges the critical thinking faculties of the mind into a partial subconscious state. It results in a permanent light hypnotic trance and so from thenceforth that person can be more easily controlled. The person will, to a much greater extent, believe and do whatever they are told. And of course this is used to the full in persuading them to hand over further money and dedicating themselves further to the cult.<br>   <br>  The results of applying their oversimplified and inapplicable rules in life is to lose the ability to think rationally and logically. A person loses the ability to think for themselves and so they lose the ability to challenge incorrect ideas. This makes them easier to control. It also isolates and alienates the person from society so that they withdraw from normal society and into their "Scientology" society. This further increases their susceptibility to the influence of their group. They end up being afraid of society, believing all society to be controlled by a group of drug companies, psychiatrists and financiers all of whom report to more remote masters. In other words they are in a state of mass paranoia. They therefore avoid reading newspapers and the like since they fear it will disturb their safe Scientology world. It is a downward spiral into madness. <br>  <br>  The science fiction content of Scientology is revealed to them after they have reached the state they call "Clear", meaning freed from the aberrations of the mind. However, perhaps "brainwashed" would be a more applicable word to describe the mental state of someone who has survived the near entire delusional contents of their subconscious mind brought to the surface and presented to them as "truth". On the "advanced" levels (called OT levels) above the state of "Clear" they encounter the story of Xenu. Xenu was supposed to have gathered up all the overpopulation in this sector of the galaxy, brought them to Earth and then exterminated them using hydrogen bombs. The souls of these murdered people are then supposed to infest the body of everyone. They are called "body thetans". On the advanced levels of Scientology a person "audits out" these body thetans telepathically by getting them to re-experience their being exterminated by hydrogen bombs. So people on these levels assume all their bad thoughts and faulty memories are due to these body thetans infesting every part of their body and influencing them mentally. <br>  <br>  On the surface the Church of Scientology seems reasonable. The insane content of it is only revealed to a person when the early stuff has done its work and made them more susceptible. After a short while a person "believes" that Scientology is doing them good. They are then persuaded to help their new-found group further by donating money and/or working for the organisation for almost no money. Many people do exactly that. <br>  <br>  "Ethics" is used to good effect to trap a person. A person?s natural tendency to do good is worked upon. Yes - they want to be more ethical, but what is ethical? This is where a clever trick is pulled! "Ethics" is redefined by Scientology in such a way that to be ethical is to be a better Scientologist and obey the "church". Young people, not yet made cynical through the machinations of life and politics, are very keen to contribute to the world and to be ethical. So the "ethics" trick works easily into persuading them to join the "church". Many of them join an elite group called the "Sea Org" where they become brainwashed slaves. There they work a hundred hour week for almost no pay. There they are subject to every cruel whim of their masters. It is a living hell that they endure because of the conditioning they have received and this now perverted sense of ethics that they have accepted. The "Sea Org" is the ultimate in brainwashed slavery. They are expected to work harder and harder to achieve ever higher targets of production. If they fail to meet their targets there are various penalties. One of them is to be put onto a diet of beans and rice and to miss sleep. Another is to be sentenced to a period on the RPF (Rehabilitation Project Force). This is the equivalent to "hard labour". Such is the extent of their brainwashing that they actually write "success stories" when they complete their sentences. <br>  <br>  There is no doubt at all that L. Ron Hubbard incorporated brainwashing techniques into Scientology to put people under his control. He even wrote a "brainwashing manual" which is still in existence today. However there was a cruel twist in his scheme. He fell victim of it himself. In creating his devoted slaves, the Sea Org, he created an audience that believed every word he said. Now L. Ron Hubbard had an over-active imagination plus delusions of grandeur. The negative feedback he would obtain by being part of normal society was replaced by the positive feedback from his devoted followers. Through this his imagination got the better of him and combined with his delusions of grandeur, his thinking became increasingly bizarre which, on acceptance, led on to more bizarre thinking and the idea that he and Scientology had the job of saving the entire universe He wanted to take over the world in order to further Scientology?s aims to save the universe and so branches of Scientology were set up to try to influence governments and gain positions where they could influence to world to a high degree. So what started out as a mass confidence trick backed up with brainwashing became a monstrous and insane organisation with fantastic, fanatical ideals. Because of this change, the Church of Scientology survived the death of their founder. It is like a runaway monster machine that tramples on society and peoples lives that is very difficult to stop. <br>  <br>  Halcon|`|o7050Po2aa	Stay away from Scientology!<br>  It's a wacko cult.

Ron Hubbard declared:<br>  <br>  "Writing for a penny a word is ridiculous. If a man really wants to make a million dollars, the best way would be to start his own religion"<br>  <br>  The principles of the group that are told to outsiders and new recruits ARE good.

We need to tap into our higher creativity, etc. They have to draw people in with good stuff.<br>  <br>  The website below has a lot of great information. You will never get the information FROM Scientology sites, because they have layers of things that are allowed to be known. You have to pay them LOTS of money before they let you in on the big "secrets." Xenu, for example, is not supposed to be known by anyone under level... 10 or something, which is thousands of dollars.<br>  <br>  The most important thing to know is the "Fair Game" policy. Here's the quote from the manual:<br>  <br>  Hubbard defined the "penalties" for an individual deemed to be in a "Condition of Enemy":<br>  <br>  ENEMY — SP Order. Fair game.

Ron Hubbard. The organization, by means of Hubbard’s self created psychotherapy technique called “Dianetics”, claims to be able to help rid members of any & all mental constraints including but not limited to emotional scarring (from this & "past" lives) due to "engrams" (past negative experiences stored in our unconscious mind), psychological disorders & chemical imbalances (the solution is to convince members that these things don't actually exist) & drug dependence (including legally prescribed psychopharmaceuticals which counteract the effects of psychological disorders Scientologists believe to be nonexistent). Their “treatment” of substance abuse includes little more than massive, often dangerous doses of vitamins and unhealthy extended sessions in a sauna. <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dianetics#Scientific_evaluation_and_criticisms" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dianetics#S...</a> <br>  Dianetics review: <a href="http://dir.salon.com/story/books/review/2005/06/28/dianetics/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://dir.salon.com/story/books/review/...</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,812852,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.time.com/time/magazine/articl...</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Narconon/detox.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Narconon/deto...</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.nypress.com/20/22/news&columns/feature.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.nypress.com/20/22/news&column...</a> <br>  <br>  Scientology is most certainly NOT a religion. In fact, one of the only reasons they enjoy "tax exempt status" on religious ground in the United States is because they bullied the IRS into a "deal" through extremely aggressive barratry (which is the offense of persistently instigating groundless lawsuits) against said government agency & its officials, & arranged to drop all 2,500 frivolous lawsuits only when an "agreement" was reached. In addition, Scientology's lawyers hired private investigators to dig up any "dirt" on IRS agents which was then used to blackmail or publicly smear all "vulnerable" agents. It was an all-out WAR that Scientology had waged against the IRS, & was even described as such by Scientology's "CEO", David Miscavige, in his 1993 speech to the International Association of Scientologists. <br>  <a href="http://legalminds.lp.findlaw.com/list/fedtax-l/msg00445.html" rel="nofollow">http://legalminds.lp.findlaw.com/list/fe...</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.lermanet.com/scientologynews/nytimes/nyt-irs-030997.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.lermanet.com/scientologynews/...</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.factnet.org/headlines/give-away.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.factnet.org/headlines/give-aw...</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Cowen/essays/irs.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Cowen/essays/...</a> <br>  <br>  The official Scientology organization is composed of a number of “levels”. One begins as a “preclear” & works their way up. One must purchase virtually every service crucial to advancement directly from the "church" & at staggering prices. "Auditing", for example, is purchased in 12? hour blocks, costing anywhere from $200-$750 for introductory sessions to between $8,000 & $9,000 for advanced sessions. Basically, Scientology claims to possess exclusive knowledge of the path to religious redemption & then charges obscene amounts of money for every tiny incremental step towards this end.

Scientologists believe the souls of these aliens (these souls are "Body Thetans") were captured, brainwashed & released; they then attached themselves to our ancestors (and according to Scientology’s belief in Thetan immortality, they also attached to us during “past lives”) & cause many of our mental & physical ills to this day.

It doesn’t recognize legitimate conditions like autism, epilepsy, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, or ANY neurological disorder / chemical imbalance at all, & the “church” has been known to withhold prescription pharmaceuticals from members (often with harmful & deadly results). The “Church” blames psychiatry for the Holocaust, as well as school shootings & even September 11th. It’s been suggested that Hubbard’s vehement opposition was born of the psychiatric community’s rejection of his “tech” as a valid treatment method, but it’s also possible that Hubbard chose psychiatry as a scapegoat. Organizations like Scientology are notorious for villainizing a specific out-group because their “stand against the enemy” fosters cohesion within said organization, & psychiatry was an effective rallying point considering many people already distrust & oppose the mental health profession. <br>  <a href="http://www.anti-scientologie.ch/usa-scientology.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.anti-scientologie.ch/usa-scie...</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.lacitybeat.com/article.php?id=3137&IssueNum=136" rel="nofollow">http://www.lacitybeat.com/article.php?id...</a> <br>  <a href="http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/2005/07/01/sci_psy/index_np.html?pn=1" rel="nofollow">http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/...</a> <br>  <a href="http://perkinstragedy.org" rel="nofollow">http://perkinstragedy.org</a> <br>  <br>  L. Ron Hubbard, the man behind the creation of Scientology, was & still is a controversial figure. Biographies & lists of personal accomplishments differ greatly between Scientology & non-Scientology publications as the “church” tends to exaggerate & outright lie about his early life, his education, his travels, his achievements etc, preferring to paint a distorted, flattering picture. Several books & articles present facts which flatly contradict these church-published accounts (links to free online copies of these books & articles are provided below), showing conclusively that he was NOT the brilliant, accomplished figure revered by Scientologists. During his autopsy, the sedative Vistaril? was present in his body, which several of his assistants would later attest was only one of many psychiatric & pain medications Hubbard ingested over the years. It had also been said by many who knew Hubbard personally that at the end of his life he was “a psychopathic insane person screaming about BT's [Body Thetans]…” <br>  <a href="http://www.apologeticsindex.org/Bare%20Faced%20Messiah.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.apologeticsindex.org/Bare%20F...</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Library/Shelf/atack/contents.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Library/Shelf...</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.clambake.org/archive/books/mom/Messiah_or_Madman.txt" rel="nofollow">http://www.clambake.org/archive/books/mo...</a> <br>  <a href="http://lisatrust.bogie.nl/scientology/essays/jeff-hubbard.htm" rel="nofollow">http://lisatrust.bogie.nl/scientology/es...</a> <br>  <br>  To be blunt, Scientology is a cult.

It bullies all known critics, opponents, “enemies”, etc, often through malicious litigation & character assassination. It’s a particularly greedy as well as manipulative & dangerous cult that takes its anti-psychiatry fanaticism to deadly limits. <br>  <a href="http://www.solitarytrees.net/racism/harass.htm#start" rel="nofollow">http://www.solitarytrees.net/racism/hara...</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.factnet.org/Books/SocialControl/scs.html#toc" rel="nofollow">http://www.factnet.org/Books/SocialContr...</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.garloff.de/kurt/sekten/mind1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.garloff.de/kurt/sekten/mind1....</a><br>  <a href="http://www.sptimes.com/2006/06/24/Tampabay/The_unperson.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.sptimes.com/2006/06/24/Tampab...</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.xenu.net/archive/personal_story/funkydonny.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.xenu.net/archive/personal_sto...</a>|`|yHfsHp6naa	Go to xenu.net.

The Pyramids of Egypt are three pyramids at Giza, outside modern Cairo. The largest pyramid, built by Khufu (Cheops), a king of the fourth dynasty, had an original estimated height of 482 ft (now approximately 450 ft). The base has sides 755 ft long. It contains 2,300,000 blocks; the average weight of each is 2.5 tons. Estimated date of completion is 2680 B.C. Of all the Ancient Wonders, the pyramids alone survive.<br>  <br>  2. The Hanging Gardens of Babylon were supposedly built by Nebuchadnezzar around 600 B.C. to please his queen, Amuhia. They are also associated with the mythical Assyrian queen, Semiramis. Archeologists surmise that the gardens were laid out atop a vaulted building, with provisions for raising water. The terraces were said to rise from 75 to 300 ft.<br>  <br>  3. The Statue of Zeus (Jupiter) at Olympia was made of gold and ivory by the Greek sculptor Phidias (5th century B.C.). Reputed to be 40 ft high, the statue has been lost without a trace, except for reproductions on coins.<br>  <br>  4. The Temple of Artemis (Diana) at Ephesus was begun about 350 B.C., in honor of a non-Hellenic goddess who later became identified with the Greek goddess of the same name. The temple, with Ionic columns 60 ft high, was destroyed by invading Goths in A.D. 262.<br>  <br>  5. The Mausoleum at Halicarnassus was erected by Queen Artemisia in memory of her husband, King Mausolus of Caria in Asia Minor, who died in 353 B.C. Some remains of the structure are in the British Museum. This shrine is the source of the modern word mausoleum.<br>  <br>  6. The Colossus at Rhodes was a bronze statue of Helios (Apollo), about 105 ft high. The work of the sculptor Chares, who reputedly labored for 12 years before completing it in 280 B.C., it was destroyed during an earthquake in 224 B.C.<br>  <br>  7. The Pharos (Lighthouse) of Alexandria was built by Sostratus of Cnidus during the 3rd century B.C. on the island of Pharos off the coast of Egypt. It was destroyed by an earthquake in the 13th century.<br>  <br>  <br>  The Seven Wonders of the Medieval Mind<br>  <br>  1. Stonehenge is a Neolithic and Bronze Age megalithic monument located near Amesbury in the English county of Wiltshire, about 8 miles (13 km) northwest of Salisbury. It is composed of earthworks surrounding a circular setting of large standing stones and is one of the most famous prehistoric sites in the world. Archaeologists think the standing stones were erected between 2500 BC and 2000 BC although the surrounding circular earth bank and ditch, which constitute the earliest phase of the monument, have been dated to about 3100 BC. The site and its surroundings were added to the UNESCO's list of World Heritage Sites in 1986 in a co-listing with Avebury henge monument, and it is also a legally protected Scheduled Ancient Monument. Stonehenge itself is owned and managed by English Heritage whilst the surrounding downland is owned by the National Trust.<br>  <br>  2. The Colosseum or Coliseum, originally known as the Flavian Amphitheatre (Latin: Amphitheatrum Flavium), is the largest amphitheatre built in the Roman empire. Originally capable of seating 50,000 spectators, it was once used for gladiatorial combat. It was built in the 70s AD.<br>  <br>  3. The Catacombs of Kom el Shoqafa (in Alexandria, Egypt) are one of the Seven Wonders of the Medieval Mind. The necropolis consists of a series of Alexandrian tombs of the Pharaonic funeral cult with Hellenistic and early Imperial Roman influences. A circular staircase leads down into tombs that were tunneled into the bedrock during the age of the Antonine emperors (2nd century AD). The facility was in use from the 2nd century to the 4th century.<br>  <br>  4. The Great Wall of China (Simplified Chinese: 万里长城; Traditional Chinese: 萬里長城; Pinyin: Wànl? Chángchéng; literally "10,000 Li1 long wall") is a Chinese fortification built from 3rd century BC until the beginning of the 17th century, in order to protect the various dynasties from raids by Mongol, Turkic, and other nomadic tribes coming from areas in modern-day Mongolia and Manchuria. Several walls were built since the 3rd century BC, the most famous being the Great Wall built between 220 BC and 200 BC by the First Emperor, Qin Shi Huangdi (this was located much further north than the current Great Wall of China built during the Ming Dynasty, and little of it remains).<br>  The Wall stretches over a formidable 6,352 km (3,948 miles), from Shanhai Pass on the Bohai Sea in the east, at the limit between China proper and Manchuria, to Lop Nur in the southeastern portion of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region [1]. Along most of its arc, it roughly delineates the border between North China and Inner Mongolia.<br>  <br>  5. The Porcelain Tower of Nanjing , (Chinese: 南京陶塔; Pinyin: Nánjīng Táotǎ), also known as Bao'ensi (报恩寺), the "Temple of Gratitude", is located in Nanjing, an ancient capital of China, out on the south bank of the Yangtze River.<br>  <br>  The Porcelain Tower of Nanjing is one of the Seven Wonders of the World in the middle ages. Warfare and subsequent destruction overtook it in the 19th century, and it is now under reconstruction.<br>  <br>  6. Hagia Sophia (Church of Holy Wisdom), now known as the Ayasofya Museum, is a former Eastern Orthodox church converted to a mosque in 1453, converted into a museum in 1935, in the Turkish city of Istanbul. It is universally acknowledged as one of the greatest buildings of the world and sometimes considered the Eighth Wonder of the World. Its conquest by the Ottomans at the fall of Constantinople is considered one of the great tragedies of Christendom by the Greek Orthodox faithful.<br>  <br>  7. The Leaning Tower of Pisa (Italian: Torre pendente di Pisa or simply La Torre di Pisa) is the campanile, or bell tower, of the cathedral of the Italian city of Pisa. It is situated behind the Cathedral and it is the third structure in Pisa's Campo dei Miracoli (field of Miracles).<br>  <br>  The tower is famous for its noticeable lean. It was intended to stand vertically, to serve as a bell tower, but began leaning soon after construction started in August of 1173.<br>  <br>  The height of the tower is 55.86 m (183.27 ft.) from the ground on the lowest side and 56.70 m (186.02 ft.) on the highest side. The width of the walls at the base is 4.09 m (13.42 ft.) and at the top 2.48 m (8.14 ft.). Its weight is estimated at 14,500 tonnes. The tower has 294 steps.<br>  <br>  <br>  The Seven Wonders of the Modern World <br>  <br>  1. Empire State Building - Finished in 1931, it towers 1,250 feet over New York City. Until the first tower of the World Trade Center was finished in 1972, it was the world's tallest building. <br>  <br>  <br>  2. Itaipu Dam—Built by Brazil and Paraguay on the Parana River, it is the world's largest hydroelectric power plant. Completed in 1991, it took 16 years to build this series of dams whose length totals 7,744 meters. It used 15 times more concrete than the Channel Tunnel. <br>  <br>  <br>  3. CN Tower—In 1976, it became the world's tallest freestanding structure. It looms about one-third of a mile high (1,815 feet) above Toronto, Canada. A glass floor on the observation deck lets you look 342m down to the ground. Don't worry: the glass is strong enough to hold 14 hippos!<br>  <br>  4. Panama Canal - It took 34 years to create this 50-mile-long canal across the Isthmus of Panama. The amount of digging required and the size of its locks helped make it the most expensive project in American history at that time-and the most deadly: About 80,000 people died during construction (most from disease). <br>  <br>  5. Channel Tunnel - Known as the Chunnel, it links France and England. It is 31 miles long, and 23 of those miles are 150 feet beneath the seabed of the English Channel. High-speed trains whiz through its side-by-side tubes. <br>  <br>  6. North Sea Protection Works—Because the Netherlands is below sea level, a series of dams, floodgates and surge barriers have been built to keep the sea from flooding the country during storms. The biggest part of the project was a two-mile long moveable surge barrier across an estuary finished in 1986. It is made of 65 concrete piers each weighing 18,000 tons. It has been said that the project is nearly equal in scale to the Great Wall of China. <br>  <br>  <br>  7. Golden Gate Bridge  - Connecting San Francisco and Marin County in 1937, for many years this was the longest suspension bridge in world. Experts thought that winds, ocean currents and fog would make it impossible to build. It took about four years to complete the beautiful 1.2 mile-long bridge. It is held by 80,000 miles worth of steel wire, and the cables that link the two towers are 36.5 inches in diameter—the biggest ever made.|`|AA11735901	top seven existing wonders of the world:-<br>  <br>  1.Great Pyramid of Giza <br>  2.Great Wall of China <br>  3.Taj Mahal <br>  4.Serengeti Migration <br>  5.Galapagos <br>  6.Grand Canyon <br>  7.Machu Picchu|`|AA12068914	on nr 1 is the USA as the biggest country on earth with its government based 100% on lies, on nr 2 it is the human monkey elected as president named after a green plant aka bush,on 3 the hundreds of states unconsciously giving everything for free to europe wich will sell them back every product for a 10x biger price and accepting it,on 4 as from an american video i think it shows that theres wind on the moon and not all objects have shadows,the 5th wonder the usa with his "high technology" can`t catch osama,the 6th  wonder america cant work without heavy machinery and stolen technology,and the 7th .... grown ups in disney land wannabe war heros in mini air planes flying around in a dumb park surrounded by 4yo kids

Nefesh .?.?. is never conceived of as operating separately from the body. In the New Testament the Greek word psyche is often translated as ‘soul’ but again should not be readily understood to have the meaning the word had for the Greek philosophers. It usually means ‘life,’ or ‘vitality,’ or, at times, ‘the self.’”—The Encyclopedia Americana (1977), Vol. 25, p. 236.<br>  <br>  What sort of people go to the Bible hell?<br>  <br>  Does the Bible say that the wicked go to hell?<br>  <br>  Ps. 9:17, KJ: “The wicked shall be turned into hell,* and all the nations that forget God.” (*“Hell,” 9:18 in Dy; “death,” TEV; “the place of death,” Kx; “Sheol,” AS, RS, NE, JB, NW.)<br>  <br>  Does the Bible also say that upright people go to hell?<br>  <br>  Job 14:13, Dy: “[Job prayed:] Who will grant me this, that thou mayst protect me in hell,* and hide me till thy wrath pass, and appoint me a time when thou wilt remember me?” (God himself said that Job was “a man blameless and upright, fearing God and turning aside from bad.”—Job 1:8.) (*“The grave,” KJ; “the world of the dead,” TEV; “Sheol,” AS, RS, NE, JB, NW.)<br>  <br>  Acts 2:25-27, KJ: “David speaketh concerning him [Jesus Christ], .?.?. Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell,* neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.” (The fact that God did not “leave” Jesus in hell implies that Jesus was in hell, or Hades, at least for a time, does it not?) (*“Hell,” Dy; “death,” NE; “the place of death,” Kx; “the world of the dead,” TEV; “Hades,” AS, RS, JB, NW.)<br>  <br>  Does anyone ever get out of the Bible hell?<br>  <br>  Rev. 20:13,?14, KJ: “The sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell* delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works. And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire.” (So the dead will be delivered from hell. Notice also that hell is not the same as the lake of fire but will be cast into the lake of fire.) (*“Hell,” Dy, Kx; “the world of the dead,” TEV; “Hades,” NE, AS, RS, JB, NW.)<br>  <br>  Why is there confusion as to what the Bible says about hell?<br>  <br>  “Much confusion and misunderstanding has been caused through the early translators of the Bible persistently rendering the Hebrew Sheol and the Greek Hades and Gehenna by the word hell. The simple transliteration of these words by the translators of the revised editions of the Bible has not sufficed to appreciably clear up this confusion and misconception.”—The Encyclopedia Americana (1942), Vol. XIV, p. 81.<br>  <br>  Translators have allowed their personal beliefs to color their work instead of being consistent in their rendering of the original-language words. For example: (1) The King James Version rendered she’ohl′ as “hell,” “the grave,” and “the pit”; hai′des is therein rendered both “hell” and “grave”; ge′en·na is also translated “hell.” (2)?Today’s English Version transliterates hai′des as “Hades” and also renders it as “hell” and “the world of the dead.” But besides rendering “hell” from hai′des it uses that same translation for ge′en·na. (3)?The Jerusalem Bible transliterates hai′des six times, but in other passages it translates it as “hell” and as “the underworld.” It also translates ge′en·na as “hell,” as it does hai′des in two instances.

I the Hebrew Old Testiment Sheol is the name of the grave and in the Greek hades is used for grave. In the first book of the Bible,God told Adam that from dust you came and to the dust you will return. God never had a plan for mankind to go to a place of torment. Thats was mans folley.

It would be hard to wrap a cow in plastic wrap unless you had her roped and tied up.  If you approached a cow out in her pasture or field with a box of saran wrap she would either run away from you or run over you.  Cows don't just stand still and let you do whatever you want to with them.  I was out in the pasture checking our cows last night and even though they know me and my voice they still walked away from me as I was walking towards them.  They sure wouldn't stand still for a stranger.  Besides, wrapping a cow in plastic wrap would be more harmful than tipping them (yes, it's possible to knock a cow down, but she is running when you do it and have to know how).

It's never too late to make friends.  Why do you feel like you would have to be a "fake person" to make friends?  If that is truly the case, then it is not worth it.  Perhaps you could find friends elsewhere.  Try joining a sports team or a gym, go to summer camp, stuff like that.

The church's goal should be to encourage and strenghen believers, so if that isn't happening, maybe you should change churches. Or even better, you can make a difference. Perhaps there is someone in your church that needs a friend as much as you do. Maybe you can change the atmosphere by being kind to someone else, and help someone else feel secure. Also, remember that you are not junk, your someone who has purpose, and that God will always appreciate you and be with you.|`|0fcb7e0fdd73deeb0e7b11f349fada1faa	aww, i'm so sorry!! that must be so hard. and i don't think parents realize how hurt teenagers are when they don't have any friends like at a specific place.<br>  <br>  i would try to go to a different church, but if that's not an option, just hang in there. talk to your pastor and tell him you want some friends and maybe [s]he can hook you up or something. just try and hang out with others. they just need to get to know you. volunteer and work with some of the others, and maybe they will start hanging out with you.<br>  <br>  either way, good luck. and i hope you will find some cool friends to hang out with. :)<br>  <br>  God bless.|`|13143ba00cdf7ee11b6a78bb953b2bf9aa	Change churches, if your parents will let you.

Personally, I go because God asks us to go and to recommit ourselves to him in the process.  <br>  <br>  There is far more to being a part of religion though than attending church.  It is about making God a part of your life i.e. living your religion.<br>  <br>  If you feel where you are is not true, first honestly ask yourself whether or not you are living by the precepts it teaches.  If you are, then there is something missing and the best thing you can do is get down on your knees and ask if it is true.  If it is, you will know deep inside - I don't mean a booming voice from the heavens, but a quiet warm assuring feeling inside.  If not, ask to be guided to the truth that you may be a part of a "family" where everyone cares for you and you for them.  Sometimes becoming a friend means you need to take the first step.

But I wouldn't worry about her so-called "documents" because they are obviously fake or nonexistant.  If anyone confronted me about her lies, I would just say, "So she says.  But since when has a mother-in-law been known for her consideration for her child's chosen partner?

That would pose some serious questions. Talk to your Dr. and then your lawyer.|`|3fd9bc196b0f7bfea9ddfcd23c615250aa	It depends. Did the father know that the child could contract Hep A? How did the child contract it? <br>  <br>  Hep A is an enterovirus that is transmitted by erofecal routes. It is impossible to catch the virus by casual contact so I think you're barking up the wrong tree with your assertion that the father is responsible.<br>  <br>  Also, Hep A is not chronic and will do no permanent damage to the child. He'll need some dietary restrictions and may suffer a relapse of symptoms up to a year later, but beyond that the child should be fine.<br>  <br>  I think you'll have a tough time proving that the child contracted Hep A from the grandfather, and even a harder time proving that the father is culpable and should be denied his parental rights.

321bb4c5e2331720dc739cdb2a2d3813aa	Grace will be extended until the mark of the beast. After that, it will be too late. I'm not sure about the millenial kingdom, however, if men will be extended grace. Tough question. I think I will try and study that as soon as I have some time (need to sleep - have school tomorrow).<br>  <br>  One thing I am fairly certain of, however, is that we are close to the endtimes. When exactly it is, no man can say, but it is possible to recognize the "signs of the times", as Christ said. There seems to be an escalation in the global state of things, and the religious system of Babylon and the conglomeration of the European states into the Roman Empire may have already been established (at least the roots) in the Roman Catholic Church and the EU, respectively. Take a look at the beliefs of those who built the tower of Babel (recorded in Genesis), and look at Daniel's prophecies in the book of Daniel, and you will see what I mean. Escathology is a very tough subject, however, without great knowledge of OT and NT and without the full guidance of the Holy Spirit. Understanding the entire Bible contextually is key in interpreting the metaphors (which represent literal things) of the Revelation of Jesus Christ, in particular.

Would You Know For Sure, Without A Doubt, That You Would Go Heaven? <br>  <br>  May I tell you my story?<br>  <br>  My story relates to the Gospel of Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  Who is this Jesus?<br>  <br>  We can know how to have eternal life!<br>  "1 John 5:13 These things have I written unto you, that ye may know that ye have eternal life, [even] unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God. "<br>  <br>  There was a time in my life when I was confused, because of all the different churches out there. Which one do I believe, because they all teach different things?<br>  <br>  Just because I was raised by my parents to believe certain things does that make everyone else wrong? No.<br>  I got to thinking in life there are life and death statements.<br>  For instance let's say your house catches on fire. Someone comes up in the middle of the night and raps on the window and shouts "get out of the house, the house is on fire." Well you know you wouldn't need an interpreter or call a few friends over and ask them what it means when someone says your house is on fire. No you wouldn't do that it is so clear what you should do. You understand you simply have to act on it and get out of the house. Well I got to thinking the Bible talks about there being an everlasting punishment. I believe this is Gods word. I thought God must have some life and death statements. Like get out of the house the house is on fire. Does God have some statements like believe this and you will live do this and you will die? He does. <br>  <br>  Then, what has been written? <br>  <br>  "John 8:24 I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for except ye believe that I am [he], ye shall die in your sins."<br>  <br>  Well I know what that means. Unless I believe that Jesus is who he says he is I will die in my sins.<br>  <br>  Isn't this a life and death statement?<br>  <br>  Then who is this Jesus? <br>  <br>  Let's go exploring. <br>  <br>  "Matthew 16:13-17 Now when Jesus came into the parts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Who do men say that the Son of man is? 14 And they said, Some [say] John the Baptist; some, Elijah; and others, Jeremiah, or one of the prophets. 15 He saith unto them, But who say ye that I am? 16 And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God. 17 And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jonah: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father who is in heaven. "<br>  <br>  Whose son is he? "God's son"<br>  In other words Jesus says you are right.<br>  <br>  Well you know I got to thinking what does it mean to believe he is the son of God? So I kept reading.<br>  <br>  Is he being the son of God all we must believe concerning His identity? <br>  <br>  "John 1:1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God."<br>  <br>  And I kept reading. <br>  <br>  Just being the son of God...Is God. Notice here: <br>  "John 1:14 And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us (and we beheld his glory, glory as of the only begotten from the Father), full of grace and truth. "<br>  <br>  Well here Jesus is claiming to be the son of God and God at the same time. <br>  <br>  All Jesus is saying is that he is the same as his parents. Jesus mother was human and father was God. That makes him 100% human and 100% God.<br>  <br>  Is that important that Jesus is a 100% God and man? Remember "John 8:24 I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for except ye believe that I am [he], ye shall die in your sins."<br>  <br>  When Jesus came to earth, did he leave his Godhead in Heaven? <br>  <br>  "Colossians 2:9 for in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily, "<br>  Notice that Jesus is 100% man and 100% God. <br>  <br>  Here God the Father calls his own son God.<br>  <br>  "Hebrews 1:1, 8 God, having of old time spoken unto the fathers in the prophets by divers portions and in divers manners, <br>  8 but of the Son [he saith], Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever; And the sceptre of uprightness is the sceptre of thy kingdom. "<br>  <br>  Quote above taken from Psalm 45:6<br>  <br>  I remember back when God was talking to Moses through the burning bush in "Exodus 3:14-15 And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you. 15 And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, Jehovah, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this is my name forever, and this is my memorial unto all generations. "<br>  <br>  I noticed Jesus using that same name. <br>  <br>  Who does Jesus claim to be? <br>  <br>  Jesus claims to be the great "I Am"<br>  <br>  "John 8:58 Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was born, I am. "<br>  <br>  I remebered "John 8:24 I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for except ye believe that I am [he], ye shall die in your sins."<br>  <br>  People all over the country say Jesus is different things. Some say he is the brother of Satan. Or Jesus is Michael the Ark Angel. There's even another religious group called Islam that dominates the world. Mohammed says Jesus was a man and the greatest prophet that ever lived. That's all he is.<br>  <br>  Jesus though say's "John 8:24 I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for except ye believe that I am [he], ye shall die in your sins."<br>  <br>  Jesus is saying what you see standing before you is a man, but you must look closer with the eye of faith and see standing here is Jehovah your God.<br>  <br>  So, we must believe Jesus is God, or we will die in our sins. <br>  <br>  I did discover that he is one of three "persons" in the Godhead.<br>  <br>  "Matthew 3:16,17 And Jesus when he was baptized, went up straightway from the water: and lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove, and coming upon him; 17 and lo, a voice out of the heavens, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. "<br>  <br>  Well I kept reading to find out more about this Jesus.<br>  <br>  What he did and why?<br>  <br>  And Jesus is one of them.<br>  Let's look and see what Jesus is called here.<br>  "1 Timothy 2:5 For there is one God, one mediator also between God and men, [himself] man, Christ Jesus, "<br>  <br>  I thought I know what a mediator is, that's a go between. Sort of like a bridge. A bridge is a bridge because it touches two shores. Because Jesus is God he touches God shore because he is human he touches our shore. So no wonder he is my one and only way home. <br>  <br>  Why do we need a mediator? <br>  <br>  You know I was reading in the Old Testament one day and came across<br>  "Isaiah 59:2 but your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you, so that he will not hear. "<br>  <br>  Well then it donned on me no wonder Jesus is the mediator. God wants me home with him but, I have been separated from God because of my sins. Jesus has got to bridge me back to God.<br>  <br>  What has separated us from God?<br>  <br>  "Psalm 92:15 To show that Jehovah is upright; He is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him. "<br>  <br>  I came across "Romans 3:10 as it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one; "<br>  <br>  "Habku 1:13 Thou that art of purer eyes than to behold evil, and that canst not look on perverseness, wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously, and holdest thy peace when the wicked swalloweth up the man that is more righteous than he; "<br>  <br>  If I am unrighteous he can't even look at me? So here's the predicament what has he got to do to save me? <br>  <br>  What can save us? <br>  <br>  What is the power of God to save us?<br>  <br>  I came across "Romans 1:16 For I am not ashamed of the gospel: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek. "<br>  <br>  You know there's that word salvation, it must be a life and death statement. I found that any time you come across a verse that has words like "life, death, heaven, hell, lost, salvation, and saved." Those are your salvation verses.<br>  <br>  Well this has the word salvation in it. The gospel is God's power of to save me.<br>  <br>  I went exploring to find out what this gospel is.<br>  <br>  What is the gospel of Christ? <br>  <br>  You know I have found that the Bible interprets itself. In many places it mentions the gospel. <br>  <br>  One of the clearest is "1 Corinthians 15:1-4 Now I make known unto you brethren, the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye received, wherein also ye stand, 2 by which also ye are saved, if ye hold fast the word which I preached unto you, except ye believed in vain. 3 For I delivered unto you first of all that which also I received: that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 4 and that he was buried; and that he hath been raised on the third day according to the scriptures;"<br>  <br>  So the gospel must consist of this Godman's death, that's Jesus' death , burial, and resurrection. <br>  <br>  Well I heard that before. How do those events take care of my salvation? Why did Jesus have to die on that cross? Let's break it down. We have seen that we have a sin problem. <br>  <br>  I found in "1 John 3:4 Every one that doeth sin doeth also lawlessness; and sin is lawlessness. "<br>  <br>  Sin is the breaking of God's law. As a baby I was over here and had never sinned. One day I decided to cross that line and commit sin. When I did wrong I decided to do wrong. I stepped away from the right I have been separated from God. I broke his moral law of righteousness. <br>  <br>  In my life I have gotten a few traffic tickets because I broke the law. I realized that you break the law you have to pay the fine. That is what is called due process. I broke the law so I get what is due to me. Does God have a due process? I kept reading. <br>  <br>  The Bible says in "Romans 6:23 For the wages of sin is death; but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord."<br>  <br>  Death? God is the source of life. If I sin I step away from life. The wages of sin is death, but if we keep reading we see the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus. In other words God is saying I don't want you to pay that penalty, I will pay it for you. Well what is it going to cost God to pay it for us? The wages of sin is death. Human sins human dies. So God had to become human and die that human death in order to pay for that human death. That's why Jesus is God and human. He is the Godman. He had to become human to die that human death, to pay for my human sin. What sacrifice what kind of love must God really have for me and you? <br>  <br>  The Bible says "Hebrews 10:8 Saying above, Sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt offerings and [sacrifices] for sin thou wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure therein (the which are offered according to the law), " So the Hebrew writter says in "10:4,5 For it is impossible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins. 5 Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, But a body didst thou prepare for me; "<br>  <br>  Why did Jesus have to do each of these things to save us? <br>  <br>  In his death we reach his blood.<br>  <br>  "Ephesians 1:7 in whom we have our redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace, "<br>  <br>  Paul says we are saved by grace through Christ Jesus.<br>  <br>  Well that's why Jesus died on the cross to take away my sin problem. <br>  <br>  How wonderful is this forgiveness? <br>  <br>  "Jude 1:24 Now him who is able to keep you from stumbling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory without blemish in exceeding joy, "<br>  <br>  He can present us how?<br>  Faultless he can makes me as clean as the day I was born. All my sins are washed away by Jesus Christ. You see not one sin can enter into Heaven. Remember "Habku 1:13 Not one sin can enter Heaven." I want in on that don't you? I got to thinking, why did Jesus have to come out of the grave? Now I read "John 20:30, 31 Many other signs therefore did Jesus in the presence of the disciples, which are not written in this book: 31 but these are written, that ye may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye may have life in his name. "<br>  <br>  Jesus takes care of our sin problem with his death. Now why was he raised for us? <br>  <br>  Watch how Jesus takes care of our grave problem.<br>  <br>  "1 Corinthians 15:20-23 But now hath Christ been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of them that are asleep. 21 For since by man [came] death, by man [came] also the resurrection of the dead. 22 For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive. 23 But each in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; then they that are Christ's, at his coming. "<br>  <br>  Because of Adams sin we all must die. As I kept reading "1 Corinthians 15:42,53 So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption: 53 For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality. "<br>  <br>  But Jesus delivers us from the grave. <br>  <br>  In a nutshell, what two things does the gospel bring us? <br>  <br>  "2 Timothy 1:10 but hath now been manifested by the appearing of our Saviour Christ Jesus, who abolished death, and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel, "<br>  <br>  We get life because of Jesus death. We get immortality because of his resurrection. <br>  Paul says it another way. <br>  <br>  What can we be through Jesus death?<br>  What can we be through his life?<br>  <br>  "Romans 5:10 For if, while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, shall we be saved by his life; "<br>  <br>  Reconciled, what does that mean? I looked it up. It means to be made friends again. So we were made friends again through the death of Jesus. What is the due process of sin? Death, Jesus died to take away my sin problem. <br>  <br>  "1 Thes 5:23 And the God of peace himself sanctify you wholly; and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved entire, without blame at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. "<br>  <br>  I have discovered there are only two things that keep us out of Heaven, sin and the grave. Jesus takes care of them in his death and resurrection. I want in on that don't you?<br>  <br>  Do you see the gospel here? How do we get "into his death"?<br>  <br>  How do I get in on it?<br>  <br>  "Romans 10:9 because if thou shalt confess with thy mouth Jesus [as] Lord, and shalt believe in thy heart that God raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved: "<br>  <br>  Raised him from the dead. That's the gospel. Must we confess Christ and believe the gospel to be saved? Is this a life and death statement?<br>  <br>  Must we change our lifestyles? <br>  <br>  "Ephesians 4:17 This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye no longer walk as the Gentiles also walk, in the vanity of their mind, "<br>  <br>  "Ephsians 5:7 Be not ye therefore partakers with them; "<br>  <br>  "Galatians 5:19-26 My little children, of whom I am again in travail until Christ be formed in you-- 20 but I could wish to be present with you now, and to change my tone; for I am perplexed about you. 21 Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law? 22 For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, one by the handmaid, and one by the freewoman. 23 Howbeit the [son] by the handmaid is born after the flesh; but the [son] by the freewoman [is born] through promise. 24 Which things contain an allegory: for these [women] are two covenants; one from mount Sinai, bearing children unto bondage, which is Hagar. 25 Now this Hagar is mount Sinai in Arabia and answereth to the Jerusalem that now is: for she is in bondage with her children. 26 But the Jerusalem that is above is free, which is our mother. "<br>  <br>  "1 Corinthians 6:9,10 Or know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with men, 10 nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God. "<br>  <br>  We need to talk about that.<br>  Fornicators those having sexual relations outside of marriage. <br>  Idolaters anything you put before God. The Bible says 18 times to love the Lord your God with all your heart. <br>  Adultery relationships with others than your spouse. <br>  On down the list. <br>  Repentance means to change your ways. Are these life and death statements? Do this and you will live do this and you will die. <br>  <br>  What if we do not change? <br>  <br>  Are these life and death statements?<br>  <br>  "Luke 13:3, 5 I tell you, no; but unless you repent you will all likewise perish. 5  I tell you, no; but unless you repent you will all likewise perish.”<br>  <br>  To get the saving gospel what must we do? <br>  <br>  What must we do to escape God's vengeance and everlasting destruction?<br>  <br>  "2 Thes 1:8,9 rendering vengeance to them that know not God, and to them that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus: 9 who shall suffer punishment, [even] eternal destruction from the face of the Lord and from the glory of his might, "<br>  <br>  How do we humans “obey the gospel?” <br>  <br>  Well you know I have to come to know God and obey the gospel to avoid destruction.<br>  <br>  How can I obey the gospel? That didn't make sense to me , until I kept reading the Bible. I found out the bible just keeps interpreting itself over and over again.<br>  <br>  Do you see the gospel here? How do we get “into his death?”<br>  <br>  I came across "Romans 6:3 Or are ye ignorant that all we who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? 4 We were buried therefore with him through baptism unto death: that like as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we also might walk in newness of life. "<br>  <br>  Baptized into his death now that began to make sense to me. Why would Jesus want me to get into his death? Well, that's were Jesus blood was shed for the forgiveness of my sins. It's into the water into his death that forgives me of my sins. Can I just put just a little water or make a wet cross on my forehead? No I must be buried with him in baptism. We have to go under the water in order to be buried with him. Now I have found how to obey the gospel.<br>  <br>  I read over there in "2 Thes 1:8,9 rendering vengeance to them that know not God, and to them that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus: 9 who shall suffer punishment, [even] eternal destruction from the face of the Lord and from the glory of his might, "<br>  <br>  <br>  "Romans 6:17, 18 But thanks be to God, that, whereas ye were servants of sin, ye became obedient from the heart to that form of teaching whereunto ye were delivered; 18 and being made free from sin, ye became servants of righteousness. "<br>  <br>  Why would God want us to get "into his death"? Ephsians 1:7 <br>  <br>  I am baptized into the gospel of Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  Where does one actually become a Christian?<br>  <br>  I came across "Galatians 3:26,27 For ye are all sons of God, through faith, in Christ Jesus. 27 For as many of you as were baptized into Christ did put on Christ."<br>  <br>  Well no wonder that makes sense. Once I put on Christ in baptism his blood washes away my sins. Once I am baptized I become a Christian. Not before, but in that exact moment that I am baptised I am added to his Church. <br>  <br>  Later on I discovered "Epehsians 1:22-23 And he put all things under his feet and gave him to be head over all things to the Church, which is his body. The fullness of him who fills all in all"<br>  <br>  "Ephesians 4:4,5 There is one body and one spirit. Just as you were called in one hope of your calling; one lord one faith, one baptism;"<br>  <br>  The Church is the body of Christ. And there is only one body. So if I am in Christ I am in the body. I am in the body with the rest of those that have done the same thing. Man I wanted to do that, but I thought, you know if I do that there are going to be some tough times coming. <br>  <br>  If one becomes a Christian will he face persecution? <br>  <br>  <br>  What will It Cost?<br>  <br>  I keep reading "John 15:20 Remember the word that I said unto you, A servant is not greater than his lord. If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they kept my word, they will keep yours also. "<br>  <br>  You know I wonder where that persecutions going to come from? I found out it's from the family.<br>  <br>  What is the worst kind of persecution? <br>  <br>  "Luke 14:26, 28 If any man cometh unto me, and hateth not his own father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple. 28 For which of you, desiring to build a tower, doth not first sit down and count the cost, whether he have [wherewith] to complete it? "<br>  <br>  To count the cost :<br>  <br>  We see here that Jesus commands commitment:<br>  "2 Peter 2:20,21 For if, after they have escaped the defilements of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein and overcome, the last state is become worse with them than the first. 21 For it were better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after knowing it, to turn back from the holy commandment delivered unto them. "<br>  <br>  Lord I want to go to Heaven. Lord I am going to walk the walk I am going to face the persecution. I am going to do it. <br>  <br>  You know every time in the book of Acts when someone is baptized it is always immediately. I mean no exception. What is this that we do today in so many places around the country and world? Where we wait a week or two weeks or every month? Or we have a baptismal participation ceremony every year. I have heard that. Every time in the Bible it is immediate. Why? Because you can not be saved outside the blood of Jesus. <br>  Baptism is where you go to the water. And it's into the water into death and into the blood of Christ. You can not be saved outside the blood of Jesus. What is this sinners prayer business? That is not even found in the Bible. What is found in the Bible is you have to obey the gospel. Well what is the gospel? It is the death burial and resurrection of Jesus Christ. How do we obey the gospel? How do we reenact the gospel? By being baptized into his death, buried with him through baptism. <br>  <br>  Remember "Romans 6:4 We were buried therefore with him through baptism unto death: that like as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we also might walk in newness of life." We have to go to deep water to be buried. I want to ask would you read Acts 22:16 and give God your answer.<br>  <br>  Please read these words and give God your answer:<br>  <br>  "Acts 22:16 And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on his name."<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gbntv.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.gbntv.org</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.searchingfortruth.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.searchingfortruth.org</a><br>  <a href="http://www.apologeticspress.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.apologeticspress.org</a><br>  This is an excellent book on-line of how we got the Bible <a href="http://www.apologeticspress.org/pdfs/e-books_pdf/hdyk.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.apologeticspress.org/pdfs/e-b...</a>|`|5308ab964dc585e2779ee9c4de92d391aa	Yes, <br>  God's Holy Word<br>  <br>  Study to show yourself approved<br>  <br>  A person who needs not to be ashamed, when you are called to<br>   give an answer|`|842466b911ff3f082a7080bf29d4ae42aa	I believe that the Lord will come back within the next 20 years but I really think it will be a lot sooner.  I have many many reasons for that one is I have heard more than one testimony of ppl who have had dreams and or visions who have been in the rapture.

If you believe that he will come back another time to rapture the church I urge you to research the origin of the rapture doctrine and also since it goes hand in hand with the 7 year tribulation doctrine that that is based on a misinterpretation of Daniel 9:27 and that the bible says that we must through much tribulation enter the kingdom of God. When Jesus returns we that are alive will rise after those that have died before his return, to meet him in the air. We can know that his return is near. We can't know the day nor the hour but he said that we can know the signs of his return. One sign is that there will be scoffers at the last day and also that because iniquity will abound the love of many will wax cold. This is true to almost unbearable proportions now.

This is the explanation as I understand it: The Old Testament was not actually written down for several centuries.  It was passed on by memorization and rote repetition as God, through Moses, commanded... hence the Jewish custom of reading aloud in the synagogue.  When it was written, it was inspired by God.  Much of the New Testament was recorded through letters to different churches just being established.  As you know, letters of Paul make up the vast majority of the New Testament.  Many of the churches established by Paul were Greek and Latin origin... Ephesus and Rome.  Therefore, these letters are better translated from the language in which they were initially written.  It's very interesting.  What we would try to remember is that the words are inspired and ordained by God and the personal revelation of their meaning is achieved by reading and studying and praying over the Bible on a personal basis.|`|22870b9fa74667f35d8c85caa8621251aa	may be, but Jesus did not speak neither Latin no Greek..<br>  <br>  Are you sure these words are from GOD?|`|a8bbd063c37a9d24598f9c75363594d7aa	Before Martin Luther and the printing press studying the Bible was only for scholars.  The Latin version was the Vulgate.  The Greek version was the Septuagint.  Scholars translated texts from Hebrew into those scholarly languages.  You can study Latin and Greek to understand the bible better, or you can get an English translation that is easy to understand.  The best thing is to memorize verses and meditate on them.  You will "hide" the Bible in your heart.  <br>  <br>  For inspiration to worship see this website:<br>  <a href="http://www.worship.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.worship.net</a>

When you dream about a friend or family member, or maybe some celebrity, is what they say or do in the dream real?  They don't remember anything about it, any more than you remember what you did in their dreams.  So if you see God in a dream, first, how do you know it's God?  Second, is it real?

I was dreaming that I was in a field somewhere without any trees.  The flowers were blooming and the birds were singing.  Everywhere I looked there was butterflies of every color.  The sun was shining brightly without a cloud in the sky.  Then a HUGE cloud rolled in from no where and a booming voice (that sounded like my grandfather) said, "Shut your trap or you will catch flies!"  So, what god demands, I did.  Though it didn't last very long if you ask anyone around me.  :-)<br>  <br>  To this day, my grandfather will not let me live this down that I dreamt of him as the voice of god.|`|WzemAt4Taa	Yes.

Not in words or numbers or even a song, I have no idea how to explain it. it was not a language and drew no pictures in my mind. I just kind of knew what they were saying to me but at the same time all I could comprehend was a sense of comfort and familiarity – weird! But I got kind of tried of being kept up all night and feeling kind of crazy for talking out loud to what appeared to be nothing, I told it to let me sleep. Suddenly I felt a huge sense of hurt, sadness and grief…. an emptiness! I have no idea what happened that night. My dad had just died…but I really have no idea.

The body is bathed and dressed in fresh clothes. Hymns that induce a feeling of detachment are sometimes sung on the way to the crematorium to aid the family in not showing their grief. At the crematorium the prayer known as the 'Kirtan Sohila' is often recited. Ardas, or 'general prayers' are often said before cremation as well. These seek a blessing for the departing soul. A member of the family will then light the funeral pyre. In traditional ceremonies this will be done with a naked flame, but in Britain it is more usual for a family member to push the button for the coffin to disappear."|`|AA10966407	burnt! dude|`|AA10118496	burnt|`|AA11979620	Sikhism is an off-shoot of hinduism.

Then, each door was knocked and every person in every house was asked for his opinion to make a pick between them, the majority chose Othman. The choice isn't made by elders.

10193ec0dd50662bf7243bb9a2cc2429aa	There are many different ways the Holy Spirit can lead us here, but for this devotional teaching we focus in on the struggle described within these sacred words. You will often hear this saying: “God helps those who help themselves.” It plays very well to our sinful pride, doesn’t it? That shouldn’t come as much of a surprise, as those words were uttered by Benjamin Franklin–perhaps a brilliant man–but an unbeliever and such was stillborn in the ways of God. <br>  Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven. Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven. (Matthew 18:3-4)<br>  As you think about what the Master is trying to tell us for a moment, you realize that you wouldn’t expect your child to have to just fend for himself in this world and you’d never think of leaving your own precious baby on his own when he called, would you? Well, how much more do you think God will be ready when His children come to Him in prayer? Isaiah 58:9 tells us that when you give your life to Christ and fully trust Him as your Lord and Savior – Then you will call, and the Lord will answer; you will cry for help, and He will say: “Here am I.” And just as a mother has a special bond with her children–no matter how that child may treat her our Lord reminds each of us – surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age (Matthew 28:20).<br>  So you see, the truth is that God helps those who finally come to realize they cannot help themselves; and as always our Lord stands exactly in opposition to mankind.|`|a258dd1c69368e774fc978d308acd799aa	Actually it's "The Lord helps those who helps themselves" Hezekiah 6:1.  <br>  <br>  Except Hezekiah isn't a bible book.|`|b5b3a78cd70d9312849f0cb75028d94aaa	According to George Barna Research associates, eight out of ten Americans believe that the statement " God helps those who help themself" is in the Bible. It seems evident that we need to do our part if we expect Him to do His part.<br>  <br>  Why should we count on God to do everything? Only if we do what we can shoud we expect God's help to do what we cannot.<br>  <br>  We resent giving something for nothing.We do not like laziness.Of course if you are ill or handicap, we do not expect you to be able to help yourself, but if you are well and capable, we like to help you if we see that you are putting some effort helping yourself too. A little bit like 50/50. You move, I move.<br>  <br>  God is not like that. We need to study His life Manual for us. The Bible warns us to take advantage of God's blessings without acknowledging our oblication to serve Him to the best of our ability.<br>  <br>  God helps ALSO those who cannot help themself...ohh yeah, and we would be so lost if it was not like that.My salvation is a free gift from God. Those who know that they cannot help themself receive the grace of forgiveness.<br>  <br>  The mentioned statement is the enemy of grace and is leaning toward rejection of Gospel. When is comes to our redemption, God must intervene because we cannot help ourself. Whether we can help ourself depends on what is the problem.<br>  <br>  The statement " God helps those who helps themself is not found in the Bible. It is originated from the pagan religion. 500 years before Jesus , Aesop wrote "The gods help those who help themself". Euripides, the Greek philosopher , said " Try first thyself, and after call God". George Herbert of the 17th century said " Help thyself and God help thee" . And we received our present formulation from Benjamin Franklin " God help those who help themself.

And then, you are supposed to thank God for the success. IF you fail, you are to blame yourself, call yourself a sinner and not be worthy of success...see how convenient this is? Covers all the bases for the theists, doesn't it? They actually can turn this around in their sick little heads and call it "proof ' that god exists. Amazing.

INTRODU??O<br>  <br>  Por que tanto sofrimento ao redor de nossos passos? Por que uns nascem na miséria e outros na opulência? Por que para uns tudo dá certo e para outros n?o? Estas s?o algumas dentre as muitas quest?es que ficam sem resposta lógica, quando analisamos a vida do ponto de vista de uma única encarna??o. Olhemos a vida numa perspectiva mais ampla e obteremos respostas para todas essas dúvidas.<br>  2. CONCEITO<br>  <br>  Afli??o - do latim afflictione. 1. Agonia, atribula??o, angústia, sofrimento. 2. Tristeza, mágoa, pesar, dor. 3. Cuidado, preocupa??o, inquieta??o, ansiedade. 4. Padecimento físico; tormento, tortura. (Dicionário Aurélio)<br>  <br>  Afli??o, na essência, é o reflexo intangível do mal forjado pela criatura que o experimenta, e todo mal representa vírus de alma suscetível de alastrar-se ao modo de epidemia mental devastadora.<br>  <br>  Freqüentemente, afli??o é a nossa própria ansiedade, respeitável mas inútil, projetada no futuro, mentalizando ocorrências menos felizes que, em muitos casos, n?o se verificam como supomos e, por vezes, nem chegam a surgir. (Equipe FEB, 1997)<br>  3. HISTóRICO<br>  <br>  O ser humano, premido pela necessidade, sempre buscou inventar aparelhos que lhe possibilitassem viver melhor. No que tange à dor, os antropólogos descobriram, já na Antigüidade, diversos instrumentos de cura. De lá para cá, as descobertas de novas técnicas se incrementaram. Foram inventados os raios-X, a anestesia, o laser e outros. Tudo para melhorar a saúde dos habitantes deste planeta.<br>  4. DOR E SOFRIMENTO<br>  4.1. ESPECIFICANDO OS TERMOS<br>  <br>  Dor e Sofrimento — a simples reflex?o sobre a dor e o sofrimento basta para evidenciar que eles têm uma raz?o de ser muito profunda. A dor é um alerta da natureza, que anuncia algum mal que está nos atingindo e que precisamos enfrentar. Se n?o fosse a dor sucumbiríamos a muitas doen?as sem sequer nos dar conta do perigo. O sofrimento, mais profundo do que a simples dor sensível e que afeta toda a existência, também tem a sua raz?o de ser. é através dele que o homem se insere na vida mística e religiosa. (Idígoras, 1983)<br>  4.2. NECESSIDADE DA DOR<br>  <br>  A dor física anuncia que algo em nós n?o vai bem e precisa de melhora. Embora sempre queiramos fugir dela, ela nos oferece a oportunidade de reflex?o — volta para o nosso interior —, objetivando o conhecimento de nós mesmos.<br>  <br>  Dada a grande coerência da dor, tanto sofrem os grandes gênios e como as pessoas mais apagadas. Nesse sentido, observe o sofrimento an?nimo daqueles que d?o exemplo de santidade aos que lhe sentem os efeitos, mesmos ocultos e sigilosos.<br>  4.3. TIPOS DE DOR<br>  <br>  O processo de crescimento espiritual está associado à dor e ao sofrimento. De acordo com o Espírito André Luiz, a dor pode ser vista sob três aspectos:<br>  <br>  1) Dor-expia??o — que vem de dentro para fora, marcando a criatura no caminho dos séculos, detendo-a em complicados labirintos de afli??o, para regenerá-la, perante a justi?a. é conseqüência de nosso desequilíbrio mental, ou proceder desviado da rota ascensional do espírito. Podemos associá-la às encarna??es passadas. Muitas vezes é o resgate devido ao mau uso de nosso livre-arbítrio.<br>  <br>  2) Dor-evolu??o — que atua de fora para dentro, aprimorando o ser, sem a qual n?o existiria progresso. Na dor-expia??o est?o associados o remorso, o arrependimento, o sentimento de culpa etc. Na dor-evolu??o est?o associados o esfor?o e a resistência ao meio hostil. Enquanto a primeira é conseqüência de um ato mau, a segunda é um fortalecimento para o futuro.<br>  <br>  3) Dor-Auxílio — s?o as prolongadas e dolorosas enfermidades no envoltório físico, seja para evitar-nos a queda no abismo da criminalidade, seja, mais freqüentemente, para o servi?o preparatório da desencarna??o, a fim de que n?o sejamos colhidos por surpresas arrasadoras, na transi??o para a morte. O enfarte, a trombose, a hemiplegia, o cancer penosamente suportado, a senilidade prematura e outras calamidades da vida organica constituem, por vezes, dores-auxílio, para que a alma se recupere de certos enganos em que haja incorrido na existência do corpo denso, habilitando-se, através de longas reflex?es e benéficas disciplinas, para o ingresso respeitável na vida espiritual (Xavier, 1976, p. 261 e 262)<br>  5. LEI DA A??O E REA??O<br>  <br>  O que é uma causa? é algo que origina um efeito. Por exemplo: qual a causa do leite? A vaca. Qual a causa da manteiga? O leite. Mas todas essas causas est?o sujeitas a um princípio. Quando estamos falando de causa e efeito, estamos falando de tempo.<br>  5.1. TEMPO<br>  <br>  Que é o tempo? Sucess?o de coisas ou de acontecimentos, que se expressam em termos de presente, passado e futuro. Embora na sua concep??o infinita de tempo, o passado, o presente e o futuro se confundem, n?o há dúvida de que o ontem foi passado, o hoje é o presente e o amanh? o futuro.<br>  <br>  Axioma: dada uma causa, o efeito se realiza necessariamente.<br>  <br>  Importante: passagem do tempo, ou seja, podemos modificar a causa e concomitantemente o efeito.<br>  5.2. O MERECIMENTO<br>  <br>  Um exemplo clássico da Doutrina está na história da pessoa que perdeu o dedo, mas deveria ter perdido o bra?o.<br>  <br>  Esta história foi retratada pelo Espírito Hilário Silva, no capítulo 20 do livro A Vida Escreve, psicografada por F. C. Xavier e Waldo Vieira, no qual descreve o fato de Saturnino Pereira que, ao perder o dedo junto à máquina de que era condutor, se fizera centro das aten??es: como Saturnino, sendo espírita e benévolo para com todas as pessoas, pode perder o dedo? Parecia um fato que ia de encontro com a justi?a divina. Contudo, à noite, em reuni?o íntima no Centro Espírita que freqüentava, o orientador espiritual revelou-lhe que numa encarna??o passada havia triturado o bra?o do seu escravo num engenho rústico. O orientador espiritual assim lhe falou: "Por muito tempo, no Plano Espiritual, você andou perturbado, contemplando mentalmente o caldo de cana enrubescido pelo sangue da vítima, cujos gritos lhe ecoavam no cora??o. Por muito tempo, por muito tempo... E você implorou existência humilde em que viesse a perder no trabalho o bra?o mais útil. Mas, você, Saturnino, desde a primeira mocidade, ao conhecer a Doutrina Espírita, tem os pés no caminho do bem aos outros. Você tem trabalhado, esmerando-se no dever... Regozije-se, meu amigo! Você está pagando, em amor, seu empenho à justi?a..."<br>  6. CAUSAS DAS AFLI??ES<br>  <br>  Faz parte do capítulo V de O Evangelho Segundo o Espiritismo, de Allan Kardec, cujo título é Bem-Aventurados os Aflitos, e abrange os itens de 3 a 10.<br>  <br>  As causas das afli??es devem ser procuradas tanto no presente (atual encarna??o) como numa existência passada. Devemos partir do princípio de que elas s?o justas. Se assim n?o pensarmos, poderemos cair no erro de jogar a culpa nos outros ou em Deus. Quer dizer, tudo o que se nos acontece tem um motivo, embora nem sempre o saibamos explicar com clareza.<br>  <br>  Assim sendo, toda vicissitude pode ser vista sob dois angulos:<br>  6.1. CAUSAS ATUAIS DAS AFLI??ES<br>  <br>  Aqui devemos refletir sobre o sofrimento que nos visita, fazendo algumas indaga??es a respeito. Em caso de anemia — será que me descuidei da alimenta??o? No caso do filho escolher o caminho do vício — dei-lhe a devida educa??o, os cuidados necessários? No caso de uma querela familiar — será que n?o fui injusto para com tal pessoa?<br>  <br>  "Que todos aqueles que s?o atingidos no cora??o pelas vicissitudes e decep??es da vida, interroguem friamente sua consciência; que remontem progressivamente à fonte dos males que os afligem, e ver?o se, o mais freqüentemente, n?o podem dizer: Se eu tivesse, ou n?o tivesse, feito tal coisa eu n?o estaria em tal situa??o". (Kardec, 1984, p. 72)<br>  6.2. CAUSAS ANTERIORES<br>  <br>  N?o encontrando uma resposta satisfatória na presente encarna??o, devemos nos reportar à encarna??o passada. "Os sofrimentos por causas anteriores s?o, freqüentemente, como o das causas atuais, a conseqüência natural da falta cometida; quer dizer, por uma justi?a distributiva rigorosa, o homem suporta o que fez os outros suportarem; se foi duro e desumano, ele poderá ser, a se turno, tratado duramente e com desumanidade; se foi orgulhoso, poderá nascer em uma condi??o humilhante; se foi avarento, egoísta, ou se fez mal uso da fortuna, poderá ser privado do necessário; se foi mal filho, poderá sofrer com os próprios filhos etc." (Kardec, 1984, p. 74)<br>  <br>  A regra é básica: devemos procurar a origem dos males nesta mesma encarna??o. N?o encontrando indícios, retornemos a uma outra. Mesmo tendo o esquecimento do passado, fica-nos uma lembran?a, uma intui??o.<br>  6.3. JUSTI?A DAS AFLI??ES<br>  <br>  A dor n?o é castigo: é contingência inerente à vida, cuja atua??o visa a restaura??o e o progresso.<br>  <br>  A dor-expia??o é cármica, de restaura??o, é liberta??o de carga que nos entrava a caminhada; é reajuste perante a vida, reposi??o da alma no roteiro certo. Passageira, nunca perene.<br>  <br>  A dor-evolu??o, tem existência permanente, embora variável segundo as experiências vividas pelo espírito. Ela acompanha o desenvolvimento, é sua indica??o, é sinal de dinamiza??o, inevitável manifesta??o de crescimento. é a dor, na sua essência, uma vez que as outras s?o passageiras e evitáveis, mesmo que o Espírito se envolva em suas malhas, por séculos, às vezes.<br>  <br>  Jesus, quando falava de dor, sede e fome, referia-se à dor-evolu??o, à dor insita no crescimento do Espírito impulsionado pela fome de aprender e pela sede de saber. (Curti, 1982, p. 39)<br>  7. CONCLUS?O<br>  <br>  "Saibamos sofrer e sofreremos menos". Eis o dístico que devemos nos lembrar em todos os estados depressivos de nossa alma, a fim de nos fortalecermos para o futuro.<br>  8. BIBLIOGRAFIA CONSULTADA<br>  <br>  * CURTI, R.

Just the look, or the look and the body language and masculine interests as well.  Maybe it adds tabu to the attraction.  Maybe it communicates 'stability' or 'good breadwinner' to a woman's subconscious, which in turn triggers a sexual response.  Who knows?<br>  <br>  I know that it's not anything like:  wanting a man, but being frightened of men for some reason, and so seeking company (sexual) from a woman who resembles a man.  That seems to be a common misconception.<br>  <br>  Dunno.  They are just sexy.|`|ca36b18b169d07f2f96a0b55ea713126aa	Lesbians are sexually attracted to women.<br>  Women have vaginas.<br>  Men don't.|`|AA11148177	Think about it, if they went for men they wouldn't be lesbians now would they? <br>  You're not so much concerned about lesbians as you are simply jealous that those are yet more women who won't sleep with you.|`|5f568984c834bb49358fc78371558d20aa	Because they are fantastically, deliciously hot.  Seriously.  This is coming from a bisexual girl, so it's not as if a butch woman is somehow, what you seem to be implying- a substitute for a man.<br>  <br>  Seriously, butch lesbians aren't men, or women trying to be men.  There's a big difference between masculinity on a man and masculinity on a woman.  Moreover, it's a woman.  There's a difference between sex and gender- sex is what's between your legs; gender is what you look like and how you act.  A lesbian is a woman who loves other individuals whose sex is female- not necessarily who express a feminine gender.  If women wanted a penis, they'd certainly go looking for it, but a butch lesbian isn't a man, and her strap-on isn't a penis, but a sex toy, a special extension of that woman.<br>  <br>  I hope that makes sense.  Just know that butch women aren't some stand-in until a guy comes along- they are mouth-wateringly hot to a lot of femmes and other butches- even to some men!|`|AA11279122	why not?

f6121987ad9a4fa7c25958d7fcd5246caa	It is very likely that she is bisexual or bicurious. Often times females feel as they are lacking some depth with relationships with males, so they pull towards females. It sounds like she's very confused about things. I think your best bet would be to talk to her, not about her sexual orientation, but about her boyfriend. Ask her how things are going with him and simple conversation starters like "did you two have a good weekend?" etc. If she is straight, unsure of her sexual orientation, or easily offended, this is going to be the only way to approach the topic without it sounding as if you're trying to hook up with her. As a bisexual female, I know a lot of my straight female friends have continued hugging and kissing me on the cheek as they did before knowing I am bisexual. I guess it's their way of saying "Missy, regardless of who you decide to have a relationship with, you're still my best friend". Maybe a few of those times the girls did secretly harbor feelings for me but I'd never bluntly ask because I didn't want to offend them or have them pull away from being friends with me. I highly doubt this female is using you. The only way to be able to tell for sure is if it seems you're doing everything for her, without anything in return. As far as the experimenting sexually, it's best to wait to see what happens IF she and her boyfriend break up. I strongly believe anyone that will cheat with another person is likely to cheat on the same person he/she cheated with. There's another possibility--maybe she isn't bisexual or bicurious but just likes you a lot. It could be sexual or it could be admiration. Everyone has had a crush on someone of the same sex at one time or the other. I understand how you must feel though since it does seem she has feelings for you. Bisexuals are so complicated because you never know what we're going for--it's so much simpler to be homosexual or heterosexual. I personally hate being called "bisexual" because I always think about the girls that use that term to attraction attention from males. Rather, the gender of a person is superficial to me in determining whether or not I am going to adore that person. I wish you the best. :)|`|3d3a30dc8fac77e27b5cfb8ee3834b4caa	There are genuinely straight girls who act they way that you describe with gay women, especially if the gay women are shy types. When it is a genuinely straight woman, it is just to reassure you that she enjoys being your friend, and that you are A-Okay by her.<br>  <br>  And there are some straight women who, oddly enough, seem to only be able to have close friendships with gay women.  I think the reason for this si they never have to worry that the gay woman will compete with her for the attention of a male.  Also maybe, some gay women give much less drama than many straight women.  (Not always, though.)<br>  <br>  Then there is always the possibility that she wants you.<br>  <br>  D amn.  I'm sorry.  I haven't given a clear answer, it seems.<br>  <br>  <br>  Be well.<br>  <br>  <br>  edited to add:<br>  BTW, I love your Nickname.

They also have a much greater reverence for feminine divinity (i.e., Mary) than do other Christian groups.

In the rapture people are suppose to disappear at the blink of any eye. Conjoined twins come in all levels of attachment today if its possible unless they share a vital organ most are separated.

What if conjoined twins shared a vital organ?|`|Fftw5yATaa	Athiest twin hasn't been bad just in being athiest.

But, I remember what Jesus did, & by His shed blood I am redeemed & by his stripes I was healed.<br>  <br>  Taking communion is an act of faith & obedience.  So?  Miracles take place, if you have true faith in your heart.  If people take communion without discerning the body, they could die early.  So, discerning the body of Christ is sooo important.  That is everyone who else is saved through faith in Christ.  And our own body also & that we need to be aware that we are the temple of the Holy Spirit.<br>  <br>  <br>  I checked your web site.  There is something wrong with people spitting up blood when taking Eucharist.  Supposedly to prove that they are truly drinking Jesus blood.  And I don't believe this (blood coming out of the mouth) would be of God but would be of demonic spirits.<br>  <br>  See?  Jesus said the fruit of the vine is His blood.  This is of grapes.  Heathen nations of the past had actually drank the blood of human sacrifices.  Jesus blood is the fruit of the vine.  So?  No more human sacrifices will do.  Devil worshippers today do sacrifices & drink the blood of the victim sacrifice.  That is because they reject the 'Lamb of God'.

I mean, I believe there is something more and for me the Scriptures make sense.  I have overwhelming faith that the Scriptures is the gospel truth.|`|IWyrJ7o3aa	HI T. Said it very well. The Bible says it is so, so I believe it. That is where faith comes in.|`|8G42oyydaa	100% I have been with two people when they died, one died screaming that the devil had come for her and "dont let him take me, help me!"  <br>  <br>  And the other said God had come to him and told him he was taking him home at noon the next day.  At the stroke of noon, he looked at his family and said God is here and I have to go now, and he died smiling and happily and peacefully.  <br>  <br>  I have told this story before but without the following details, I had to leave that morning to go home and get back to work the next day so I said goodbye to him the night before. <br>  <br>  At precisely noon a really bizarre wind funnel filled with light, came down and circled my car, there were autumn leaves swirling in it and my son who was around 6 yrs old, and my daughter who was 4 looked at me and both said "mom its Uncle Wilf".  I looked at the clock so I could ask afterwards if he had died and at what time -  so I believe he stopped in on his way to Heaven to say "see ya guys, love you". <br>  <br>  After these two experiences I believe without reservation. I never really believed in hell before, but I do now. <br>  <br>  I wasnt there when my mother died, but the Pastor visited her daily at my request so she could repent her sins and ask forgiveness.  Two days before she died she said this "glorious man" had come to see her and He didnt come through the door, He just appeared out of nowhere in her room and told her she was go to go with Him and He would be back in a few days for her.  <br>  <br>  My mother never used words like "glorious".  <br>  <br>  The next day she told me He had been back and she asked me if she should go with Him, and I said "absolutely go - your brothers and sisters are waiting, and your parents, and Dad, and its time to go."  And she said that is what this "glorious man" had told her, And she died that night. I assume He came for her, but wasnt there so dont know.<br>  <br>  And I have NO evidence or experiences that would point to there NOT being an afterlife, so I am going with my beliefs that there is.<br>  <br>  Edit: FYI It doesnt matter if you believe the first Prophet is named Jesus, as I do, or what you believe He is named. All "religious" or theology doctrine speaks of a life after death.  Even Bhuddhism. The Koran mentions Jesus as a Prophet and the Torah, BTW. Belief in an after life is not a "Christian" belief. It exists in all religions and beliefs|`|bf4cc388616ba9cb48357f54373c609eaa	I believe in God, the Father Almighty, maker of Heaven and Earth, and in Jesus Christ, his only son, our Lord; who was conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of the virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, dead and buried ; he descended into hell; the third day he rose again from the dead; he ascended into heaven, and sitteth on the right hand of God, the Father Almighty; from thence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead. I believe in the Holy Ghost; the holy catholic church; the communion of saints; the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body and of a life everlasting. <br>    This is a statement of my beliefs and it is not a prayer. It is an affirmation of faith. Therefor, the rules adopted by YA should not be cause to remove it. <br>     My affirmation of my faith which includes my faith in the existence of a life that is everlasting stands on it's own and has withstood attacks for two thousand years.|`|ZJ2k7Ynqaa	I am sure.  About 30 years ago, someone gave me a gospel tract to read.  Also, a lady I carpooled to work with invited me to a Bible study.  I didn't think about these two things much, but a few months later, someone close to me came down with cancer.  My life was pretty much a mess and this was kind of the last straw.    God sent someone (via telephone) to talk to me about Jesus.  I felt a heavy weight come off my shoulders.  She told me to pray and read the Bible.  I did and also started attending a Bible church (like Baptist).   God has been faithful to me and helped me through many problems and blessed me a lot since I was born again.  God is good! John 3:16|`|XEbrGfZuaa	I was raised to attend church faithfully every Sunday morning. As a<br>  young woman, I began to drift away due to moving away and beginning a new life. Over the years, I had many questions. That I <br>  wanted answers to. I couldn't accept the illogical stories I read, like <br>  Jonah and the whale, for one. I once was told that one doesn't need<br>  to attend church, to be strong in their faith, and live as a Christian<br>  should. So I observed my faith quietly and privately at home, during<br>  our years of moving around between several states.  One day, I came<br>  across a book written by a Jewish scholar. And read only a few parts<br>  and considered it blathsphemous and tossed it. I believe it was <br>  called, The Jesus Myth.<br>     After our son became an elder in the JW cult, it made us see with<br>  open eyes how Christian clergy didn't want to get involved in helping to<br>  deprogram him. So we began a search for the truth. It took years of<br>  finding book after book with resources. We learned so much to widen<br>  our scope of religion. We learned that the bible was aimed at a very<br>  ignorant culture, and that ordinary people believed they saw miracles<br>  in what we would consider today, rediculous. We learned also that<br>  words and their definitions were much different than what we construe<br>  them to mean today. And that the proclamations, in the bible, were<br>  already back in those early days of Christianity and Judaism. The<br>  concepts we have available to digest today, are often hard to accept.<br>  Some seem utterly far fetched. And yet, the travels of Jesus and his<br>  family and their pilgrimage to safet, has been documented. Where he<br>  went has been written about, as well as his family, including wife and<br>  children. Why wasn't any of that included in the bible? Why did the<br>  Catholic church choose to hide all evidence of his life, other than what<br>  they allowed us to know? It has been evident, that we've been lied to<br>  for all of those centuries, since the Church of Rome was founded. All<br>  to bring order and control of the people controlled by the Roman <br>  rulers back when.  It is hard to believe we have been deceived and we<br>  continue to allow it. But the churches of today, would be obsolete, if<br>  the truth was acknowledged by them. And they'ed loose their followers<br>  and their incomes. I think the majority want to live as they always<br>  have. They are content with what they've been told or read to believe.<br>  It feels safer that way. I was one of them in the beginning. Now I seem<br>  to be a fence straddler. I still want to believe, even though the evidence<br>  is out there and can't be ignored. I now feel the emptiness of religious<br>  holidays, that meant so much growing up. Although there is the more<br>  pagan side, if one chooses to observe from those roots.<br>      I have read about reincarnation, and so it is my hope that such<br>  exists. For this life has been utter misery far too often, for me to un-<br>  derstand, why I was put on this earth, to a particular family and since<br>  have lived under Murphys' Law ever since. Realizing that there has<br>  to be a better life with happiness, the next time around. I want to be-<br>  lieve, that my spirit will leave my body and become one with the<br>  universe. And that some sort of recycling will take place for each of<br>  us to return and live new lives, taking care not to make the same<br>  mistakes another time. I hate to think of just taking my last breath,<br>  and being imbalmed or worse and lying in a dark box for all eternity.<br>  That's why everyone has the hope of going to heaven, or being born<br>  again through a recycling process. No one wants to think of what<br>  could be, the only end for any of us. Our lives are so short, that there<br>  has to be more waiting, somewhere, anywhere.|`|wwdllMzYaa	im not certain, but im sure that its alife of energy, the only thing im not sure of is whether its consciious and aware liek we are now, or unaware and just existing<br>  i dont beleive in any religious claims<br>  <br>  i still have a while to go, but, if you go soon, come back and let us know<br>  ;-D|`|b3h0ovgRaa	No, I do not believe Jesus rose from the dead.

UUUUHHHH, you are horribly mistaken. Pope Pius XII actually did a great deal. Thousands of Jews today are alive because the Pope hid Jews in every cathedral, church, monastery, and convent in Rome. The head rabbi of Rome during the time, converted to Catholicism after the war and took the Pope's name as his baptismal name in thanks for his efforts. Every source before the 1960's praised Pope Pius XII for his service to the Jewish people. Eventually, books were written that were Critical of Pius XII, but every one has been criticized by historians because they manipulated or left evidence. <br>  <br>  If you don't believe me, watch this video:<a href="http://www.barhama.com/PAVETHEWAY/5.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.barhama.com/PAVETHEWAY/5.html</a><br>  <br>  I find it ironic that you are blasting this Bishop because he denies the Holocaust and ignores evidence.

Where do you people come from?<br>  <br>  Look, you are just an ignorant bigot that hasinterest in niether learning the truth nor educating yourself. Really, thats your problem.

However, according to the British archives, the Vatican reported German troop locations to the British chain of command. Also, the Vatican carried messages to England on behalf German conspiritors who wished to overthrow Hitler. Actually, the Vatican routinely betreyed their position of neutrality.

Pope Paul apologised for the Church's failures during the Holocaust.  That is an entirely different thing from this fool of an ex-bishop "apologising" if he's upset anyone with his claim that only 300,000 Jews died during the Holocaust and none of them in gas chambers.  He hasn't been willing to apologise for the false claims.  I say, thank goodness the present pope hasn't accepted this so-called apology as adequate.

What the brain evolved an amazing ability for is to RECOGNIZE PATTERNS - this was a far more useful tool for survival than logic was. And, early man began to notice patterns...like whenever he killed a goat for food and hide for warmth, it rained - so it must be killing the goat that makes it rain!! In reality, he needed the hide for warmth because the seasons were changing and it was starting to rain - but he saw causation differently and attributed the rain to the killing of the goat.. <br>  <br>  And, recognizing patterns is exactly why we see the Virgin Mary in a grilled cheese sandwich. Its not a miracle - its a pattern (face) that we recognize. (Note: facial "patterns" is what helps a child bond with its mother - again, a survival instinct related to recognizing patterns...)|`|GIFLguMeaa	I think logic is simply reaching a reasonable conclusion based on past consistent experiences. Children haven't had that many experiences, so they are not really going to be all that rational. <br>  The scientific method is basically codified logic.

DfDss68haa	The simplest answer I can give is that self hatred BEGINS with trying to assimilate and please the dominant culture (which at this time is often Eurocentric). I mean, nobody sits down one day without an outside force and says " My hair is ugly and nappy. My skin is too black. My eyes are ugly and squinty. My lips/nose are too big." But this self hatred is often PERPETUATED and kept going by people of the same race with the same features. I am going to focus on black self hatred (rather than Asian or White) becuase that's what I know the most about. I know there are people out there who do not want to believe that black women straighening their hair is a form of self hatred (becuase they themselves do it and they don't like looking in the mirror and seeing the self hatred) but in my experience it most certainly is. This has been very interesting to me as a black woman who has recently decided to go natural. I stopped relaxing my hair and I let my nappy hair free. Without a doubt, 98% of the negative comments I recieved on my hair has been from other black people. White people praise my hair and often wish their hair would do the same thing. And I can tell they are sincere. (And becuase I still struggle with self hatred, this sometimes baffles me. Who wants nappy hair?) Black people will say I look like a slave, I need to get my hair relaxed again, I won't get a job, etc and so forth. I mean they will get literally angry with me for my decision about how to wear MY hair. Remember the part about the anger and MY own hair becuase I will come back to it. <br>  <br>  The Bluest Eye by Toni Morrison is deep. My mom once told me she used to do lip excercises when she was little and put clothespins on her nose to make both smaller while she slept. And she relaxed her napptural hair until one touch up got left on too long and all her hair fell out. Did white people necessarily tell her these features were unacceptable and cuase her to do these things? No but is there really any difference when she was surrounded daily by models with thin lips, blue eyes, silky hair, and thin noses? It's an environment and an unspoken prejudice. And during slavery it was more overt than just being a standard of beauty, these features were openly hated on and to have these features could mean more than just not being like the majority, it could mean your death and marks your place in society for life. <br>  But what about Asians? They were never held captive against their will but yet many have just as many (if not more at this point) issues with the natural born features. Those who have eyelid and nose surgery have colonialism all over their face. They have also been force fed images of Western beauty for decades now. And I watched Tyra's episode where there was that Asian girl who got the surgery. This girl has been surrounded by white people her whole life with different features. She said she just wanted to be like everyone else. This reminded me strongly of myself. My hair didn't look like the Disney Princesses and I would walk around with a towel on my head and pretend my hair "moved." <br>  <br>  So this obsession with white features begins with the media (and further back slavery and colonialism and who had the power) but there is no denying that the minorities are now in many cases the ones perpetuating it. Black people are the ones most likely to call another black person too dark and nappy. Black people can now get jobs with natural hair (if we ever truly couldn't I'm not sure) and many non Asian people think Asian eyes are gorgeous. So where does "Assimilation becuase it's necessary" end and "I truly believe my features are ugly" begin? I'm not convinced assimilation was ever necessary in the strictest sense. I think humans just have a desire to fit in. <br>  <br>  So what if all black women had just said "accept us as we are" would we have seen Oprah, Tyra, Michelle Obama? I don't think so and not becuase white people would have protested, but other black people. White people would have eventually accepted us. I heard many black people say they would not have voted for Obama had Michelle's hair been natural becuase she would have been an embarrasment. There is a clue in there.<br>  <br>  Combined with other black people being angry at me for going natural with MY hair I had an ephiphany. We are now self regulating ourselves. We have taken that internalized the past hatred and prejudice so well we now believe it completely. And worse, we are imposing these views on each other becuase we feel that what other minorities do reflects on us due to the psychology of stereotype threat. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype_threat" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype_...</a> Michelle Obama would have embarrassed ALL black people with her nappy hair. The best example of how self hatred is no longer about White media is the Dominican Republic, it is majority black and black governed country, yet there is so much prejudice against African features. <br>  <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/multimedia/news/afrolatin/part2/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.miamiherald.com/multimedia/ne...</a><br>   <br>  We don't need the white man's approval anymore, so now it's just a case of waking up and shaking off the slave mentality (or whatever mentality that keeps you thinking you look better when you look whiter) and stop hating on each other. To silence the voice inside that has been told for so long that we are ugly becuase we don't look like the prevalent idea of beauty.<br>  <br>  Also on another comment: "Most black women do little more than get their hair [done]....to change their appearance and women of all colors do that. " I completely disagree with this downplaying of HOW black women get their hair done. If white women get their hair did they do not try to drastically change their hair texture. How many white women get afro perms? Not anywhere near the extent of black women who get straight perms. And also I have yet to hear a white woman say she NEEDS a perm, she wouldn't leave the house with her natural hair or would not know how to manage her natural hair type but this is a common sentiment among black women. Can we please stop trying to compare white women's ocassional curly perms and extensions to the relaxers and weaves so common for black women? I can't believe all the denial. When I used to relax my hair I readily admitted it was partly becuase my hair type was not seen as beautiful in society and I wanted to look "pretty". And to look pretty to the world is to look more white.|`|kHx1upOpaa	Black people have deep issues and yes iam black, slavery and being in a the white controlled society has deeply effected many of us.|`|OZjlW5utaa	I think that it is both caused by the roots of westernized society and the oppressive ideology that non white groups subjugate themselves too.<br>  <br>  Westernized society is white, however hard (and I hate saying a 'white society') it is too say, it is. We are faced all around us with the image of 'beautiful' and they are too, of 'western' women, who are white, we hardly even see a white women with 'darker' features, such as those of an Italian or Arab. All around us is the dominant culture which is western and this is suppose to represent normality. Its natural for people, of all races to subjugate themselves to these images of that rigid view of beauty. People moan, 'why don't we have a white ebony magazine or White Entertainment...' I say 'Have you ever seen a black face or for that matter, arab, asian etc face on the cover of a big magazine?...No'.<br>  <br>  So In that sense this is caused by the roots of the rigid view of normality we face everyday in the western world.<br>  <br>  The ideology that you've explained is the cause of the rigid western society we live in and most non white individuals subjugate themselves to this, so even though some may say that we are weak to give in to this. But the amount of black or non white women who do do these things are a tiny minority and most women who do these things are white. All in all in my eyes the oppressive ideology that you have explained is what western society has caused. <br>  <br>  However, The thoughts of lighter skin is better then darker skin and good hair is straight and silky, even though have come from the western epitome of beauty, have all been made bigger in black culture, and I repeat as a result of western ideals. If I can stand and say my point as I'm multiracial, I have seen my black friends insult darker black people, my friend, even bleached her skin, as a result of being scared of being subject to insults over her dark complexion. When a black women rocks her natural hair, it'll be a white women, who will applaud it, a black women will like it, but you always get the ones who say 'its nappy...its bobbly etc'. I think we all need to get out of western ideals, and see real beauty that we all posess, especially ethnic beauty. Not only see white as normality but black, asian etc.|`|YIAZmSW7aa	It is not a simple answer.  Yes, self-hatred among non-whites, especially blacks, is probably largely due to oppression; that is, blacks, much more than any other racial group in America, were forced to assimilate into American (European) culture.  The only remants of African culture in America today are vague.  I would not attribute this only to the media, although it of course is responsible in large measure.<br>  <br>  Since this is the root and initial cause of self-hatred within racial minorities, I don't believe it is fair to say that blacks subjugate themselves by indulging in self-hatred.  You must go back farther, go deeper.<br>  <br>  Sorry, I'm not black, but since the word "race" is biologically meaningless anyway, I figured I'd take a stab at it.|`|qvycijbOaa	The western world belongs to white people, as long as they continue to produce propaganda showing that white features, and social attitudes are those that are correct, the self hatred will be prevalent in minorities. People see society as reality (especially those that haven't travelled or know few people of other races), if society tells you that your facial features aren't as attractive as a blonde with blue eyes... That's reality telling you it to those people. <br>  <br>  But as long as you socialise/ live with people of your own race, I think self hate can be prevented pretty easily. It is extremely rare from what I've heard/experienced so It isn't too much of a threat to me. The cases in which someone is a self hater, they usually are for a specific extreme reason.<br>  <br>   I think self-shame (if i could make up that term) is more common. Self hatred is so rare that I've never met a self hater because they would look absolutely ridiculous. Self shame would be people denying the natural kinks of their hair and claiming that their hair is 'good hair' because it isn't nappy. That's called being ashamed from my perspective, and i think that is more of an issue.|`|0cmGYL9kaa	eh, I don't find white women attractive so why would I want to be more like them?|`|054c4d5de5760440b6ecc6a905a7f800aa	I think that this psychological condition is mainly embedded into our African American women's minds. They feel they have to compete with their caucasian counterparts to be accepted. Media is a brainwashing machine. For us males though, I never saw a show and wanted to be more white.|`|7Ohs5ABCaa	I would argue this is actually more related to nationalism and the need to worship the ideal that the state creates than just straight out racism.  In racism, one can not become white one is always reminded that they are the other and don't belong no matter what they do.<br>  <br>  However, in nationalism, one has the ability to be co-opted into the system by striving for the Ideal of the Nation.  In the case of the US that is being Wealthy White Christian and heterosexual.  What you notice black women doing and what I notice about what certain black leaders who are critical of black culture, they are trying to become part of the Ideal in their country by striving for the white norm.<br>  <br>  If you look at the immigration patterns in the US, then you see it is very similar to what black women are doing today.  Immigrants who moved to the US gave up their culture, which includes their style of dress, language, and identity so that they could be apart of the norm.<br>  <br>  The anthropologists Pierre van den Berghe, Leo Kuper, and Carole Nagengast believe that the role of the nation-state is to commit ethnocide and genocide, I tend to agree with their assessment.  And that is what I believe is happening and has happened to the African Diaspora in the West.|`|T1beLIQqaa	I am not Black.When ever I answer this type of question honestly, I get a lot of angry mail fro ONLY Black females-no other group, not even Black males. Many Black females do NOT like  classical Black features-this is very wide spread-classical Black features-low forehead,thick lips, broad flat, large nose, almond shaped eyes, kinky course/thick, brown/black hair, big bone structure, non medical prognathism(forward jaw),medium to dark Brown/Black(Congo) skin-examples ,the late Esther Rolle, mother on "Good Times", Michael Jackson BEFORE the "change", as opposed to classical White features-high forehead,thin lips, small narrow, pronounced nose, eliptical small to medium,any color, eyes,straight to wavy, mine-medium fine hair-any color, medium to large bone structure, receding jaw,medium to golden brown(tamils of India have very dark brown) skin color-examples-Pamela Anderson, President Bush-even Michael Jackson AFTER the "change".They consider classical Black features UGLY-one lady even gave an example using dolls-when I researched them, the Black dolls she considered UGLY had classical Black features-the Black doll(only one) she loved, and, thought was a beautiful Black doll, was the Black Barbie(just that-black with White features). What  most of these angry Black women found as beautiful Black women-in reality, were women of MIXED heritage-Tyra Banks,Niaomi Campbell, Lila Kebbedde, Iman, Vanessa Williams, Mariah Carey, Beyonce Knowles,Halle Berry, Lisa Bonet, Sabrina LaBeauf-not a one was full Black-incidentally,many of these MIXED models appeared in Vogue's, supposedly, "All Black" magazine.Many Black women(not all), look in the mirror for the self-hatred-the media gives us what we want-incidentally, most of the SUPER models are MIXED of different ethnicities- neither White nor Black.Two examples of full Black beauties-Gabrielle Union and Donna Givens-love them. I have dated women, and, have friends across the spectrum, including Black. There is beauty in ALL. Those whom only want one type of ethnicity, leaves MORE for me-I want, and, will take them ALL. I also run a modeling site with beauties ACROSS THE SPECTRUM FROM REAL LIGHT TO REAL DARK-LOVE THEM ALL-THEY ARE ALL VERY BEAUTIFUL.<br>  <br>  Now ask why Tyra, Oprah, and Montel,  have more Whites than Blacks on their shows, why does Bill Cosby have two mixed heritage females-Lisa Bonet and Sabrina LaBeauf, play his daughters on the "Cosby Show"-there are enough Black females to do this- they all own their own studios, and, are millionaoires?You answer that.|`|oHvmqpxmaa	I don't mean to be rude but this is truly <br>  not a significant issue.<br>  <br>  Most black women do little more than get their <br>  hair and nails done or wear makeup to change <br>  their appearance and women of all colors do that. <br>  <br>  <br>  Black women that get cosmetic surgery are an <br>  insignificant minority.<br>  <br>  Most cosmetic surgery in the U.S. is done by white people,<br>  white women in particular.|`|yzgS5KiQaa	I've been thinking a lot about this lately. I do believe or ideas about beauty are influenced by society. Some things seem to be universally considered beautiful, youth, health, big eyes, symmetry. An have more to do with biology. But other things seem to be greatly influenced by society. <br>  I was thinking about how I like my white skin. I like being white, I think being white is attractive. I think other skin colors are attractive too, and beautiful, but I'm glad I'm white an I don't want to be another color. Like how someone can admire someones fiery red locks, but love their brown crown. But I was thinking, why do I like being white so much? Is it innate, or does all this love of being white, self appearance, an happiness come from the media telling me that being white is the ideal? I've heard of little girls who tell their moms that they look like dirty dogs because they are black, an that they feel ugly, wish they were white, an want to grow up to be white. Little children! Toddlers, it was so sad I could have cried. <br>  Then I think about something that society tells me is Not the ideal, by brown eyes. Society tells me that big blue eyes are the ideal, my eyes are dark brown, I have to be honest an say that I have thought they weren't as good as blue eyes. Yeah, they are pretty, but I Want the blue eyes. <br>  I've also been thinking about, when does self expression become self hatred? I dye my hair blond because I love being blond, I just feel like a blond, I'm happiest when I'm a blond. If I can change my hair color, or get surgery to customize my appearance, what's so bad about a black person bleaching their skin, or wearing a weave? I mean, is it just self expression? Or is it hatred and denial of your identity? Like with asian eye surgery, the women want the double eyelid because they believe it is more beautiful, is it wrong for them to remove something of their ethnic identity? Maybe it comes down to Why they are doing it. Is she doing it because she hates being asian, or is she doing it because she just finds it prettier? Is she doing it for others, or herself. I don't dye my hair blond for others, I dye my hair blond for myself, white blond, an short, that's how I like it! I don't care if no one finds it good looking but me. Did my perception of blond being the ideal for me come from societal influence? I dunno if it did, I dunno if it's wrong. <br>  I don't know if I made any sense, or answered your question, but it is a topic that also interests me.
XuhQS9wsaa	Yea, I do. I'll tell you and you'll be the first to know. <br>  When I was 18 I told my parents I needed to go to a psychiatrist. They didn't really understand why but they could tell I needed one cus I wasn't acting as happy as I always used to. So finally they got me a psychiatrist and I was so excited that I could finally tell someone my secret. I told her, "Im gay... and I don't know what to do." She told me "That is too much information. I don't normally discuss such issues with my clients." I told my parents I never wanted to go again and the next week I took a bunch of sleeping pills. When I woke up in the hospital my parents were freaking out and were like 'what can we do to help!' and I was like I guess a different psychiatrist... the next psychiatrist was the coolest person ever and helped me a lot. I came out shortly after that and have never been happier. Im 20 and love living. I'm not like emo or anything... which is actually why it was so surprising to my parents, cus I always act extremely happy and have tons of friends. None of my friends know about any of it and my parents still don't know about what the first psychiatrist said.|`|cYPIJql2aa	Who hasn't got secrets? Bet you have as well, dear!

It is not that God exists outside the universe, it is that since HE created all things, all things are subject to his will. He WROTE the laws of space, time, physics, motion, gravity, logic, thermodynamics, etc., so IF he wishes to change or bend any of these for his own good pleasure, he is free to do so at his will.<br>  <br>  Have you ever played monopoly? Are you aware that it is a popular "house rule", NOT IN THE MANUFACTURERS INSTRUCTIONS, to place "fine" money and "tax" money that would otherwise "go to the bank" under the corner of the board known as "Free Parking?" Eventually, someone will land there, and that is then their money?<br>  <br>  It is absolutely the same with God. The universe is HIS monopoly board, that's why when God sent his son Jesus, to walk among us and die for our sins, it was NO BIG DEAL for Jesus to "violate" the known laws of nature by turning water into wine, walking on water, calming stormy seas by his spoken word, feeding 5,000 with 5 loaves and 2 fishes, forgiving sins, healing the sick and even raising the dead. All of these things He was able to do because He was DEMONSTRATING that ALL THINGS are SUBJECT to HIM. <br>  <br>  The universe is HIS HOUSE and the rules are HIS. Consider these statements regarding God and the universe by some pretty highly educated men:<br>  <br>  "I am fascinated by some strange developments going on in astronomy....The astronomical evidence leads to a Biblical view of the origin of the world". -- Robert Jastrow (Astomomer) and former Director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies<br>  <br>  “The more I examine the universe and the details of its architecture, the more evidence I<br>  find that the universe in some sense must have known we were coming.” - Freeman Dyson (physicist)<br>  <br>  “The exquisite order displayed by our scientific understanding of the physical world calls<br>  for the divine.” - Vera Kistiakowsky (physicist) <br>  <br>  "For the scientist who has lived his dream by faith in the power of reason, the story ends like a bad dream. He has scaled the mountains of ignorance; he is about to conquer the highest peak; as he pulls himself over the final rock, he is greeted by a band of theologians who have been sitting there for centuries." - Robert Jastrow (astronomer and physicist).<br>  <br>  Yours in Christ,<br>  John the Baptist|`|D9lMg7A2aa	You do know that any argument based on definition is unarguable, don't you.  <br>  <br>  It is the most flawed of arguments.

AA12335280	The episode may have aired before 9/11/2001, but it was made after the Oklahoma City bombings, and the first NYC bombings. I remember that episode of TBA very well, just as I remember how horrified I (and most of the country) was at the bombings themselves. <br>  <br>  CBS would sometimes do little "cast/writer/producer" interviews for big episodes like that one.<br>  <br>  Did God touch those writers and creaters....absolutely.<br>  Do I think it was a warning for a "specific" forthcoming event (like 9/11)? .....no.|`|AA11887043	Yes, god took the time to write an episode of touched by an angel instead of stopping 9/11. Of corse. This makes perfect sense.|`|lSyBbdajaa	I saw that one as well. I dont know if God gave them inspiration, the way i know God, he might have. But I dont think a TV pro gramme would be able to prepare ppl for something so big. TV pro grammes are very impersonal and it might just have been a coincidence. I think that it does ppl more good watching it after 9/11 because it reassures ppl that their loved once are in a better place and well looked after and that the ones who survived were protected by angels.

They're not the same thing you know.<br>  <br>  No, the Jesus of the bible was not fond of dictatorships but was a Liberal.|`|RdmRwv9iaa	No Jesus is God.<br>  <br>  The Divinity of Christ<br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  ...awaiting our blessed hope, the appearing of the glory of our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ, who gave Himself for us to redeem us from all iniquity...<br>  Titus 2:13-14<br>  <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  For most Catholic Christians, Christ's divinity is taken for granted. Today, however, this belief is being challenged, attacked and denied on several fronts. Jehovah Witnesses claim that Jesus was merely Michael the Archangel in human form, while Mormons reduce His divinity by claiming that everyone can be a god. Most cults also deny that Christ is God. Even some theologians seriously challenge this traditional belief. Others claim that Jesus was unaware of His divinity until after His Resurrection.<br>  <br>  Assuming that the Gospels are at least historically reliable, Jesus many times claims to be someone quite special. In Mark 2:28, Jesus claims to be the Lord of the Sabbath (Exodus 20:10). He also claims to be greater than the Prophet Jonah (Matt 12:41), King Solomon (Matt 12:42) and even the Temple (Matt 12:6). According to Mark 2:1-12, Jesus claims authority to forgive sins and performs a miraculous cure to prove it. The scribes are angered because they believe that only God has the authority to forgive sins. These claims are quite extraordinary for someone who is "humble in heart." [Matt 11:29]<br>  <br>  Jesus, while arguing with the scribes, makes an interesting statement about Himself and Abraham:<br>  <br>  Jesus answered them: "I solemnly declare it: before Abraham came to be, I AM." At that they picked up rocks to throw at Jesus... [John 8:58-59; NAB]<br>  <br>  Jesus claims to have existed also before Abraham - something impossible for a mere human. Moreover the statement sounds grammatically awkward due to tense disagreement. It would sound better if He had said "I WAS" instead of "I AM." The present tense implies Christ's eternal existence as God.<br>  <br>  Even though Jesus does not explicitly call Himself "God", He does refer to Himself with a form of God's name. The full meaning of His statement in John 8:58 is best understood in connection with Exodus 3:14. In Exodus God reveals His name to Moses:<br>  <br>  God replied, "I AM WHO AM." Then He added, "This is what you shall tell the Israelites: I AM sent me to you." [Exodus 3:14; NAB]<br>  <br>  God's name - YHWH (Yahweh) - translates as "I AM WHO AM" or simply "I AM." In John 8:24 & 58, Jesus is referring to Himself with God's name. The scribes understand Him as such and respond by throwing rocks at Him. They wanted to stone Jesus for blasphemy - referring to Himself as God (John 5:18).<br>  <br>  Other people in the Gospels also bear witness to His divinity. Even before His birth, He is referred to as Lord. Inspired by the Holy Spirit, Elizabeth greets the pregnant Mary:<br>  <br>  "But who am I that the mother of my Lord should come to me?" [Luke 1:43; NAB]<br>  <br>  Elizabeth refers to Mary as "the mother of my Lord." Elsewhere in Luke 1, the title "Lord" refers to God, e.g. "an angel of the Lord" [Luke 1:11]. It should be noted that the name YHWH, being too sacred, could not be uttered, so the Hebrews said "Lord" instead. This passage in Luke suggests that Jesus was God while in the womb of Mary. Also when Jesus was an infant, the wise men worshipped Him according to Matthew 2:11. If the Christ Child were not divine, then this Gospel passage would present idolatry in a positive light. Later Jesus even allows people to worship-adore Him, as in John 9: 38. Finally after the Resurrection, Thomas greets Jesus as "My Lord and my God." [John 20:28; cf. Ps 35:23] Jesus confirms this greeting without any hesitation, objection or correction. As a teacher Jesus would be obliged to correct an error, especially a blasphemous error.<br>  <br>  According to secular reports, the 2nd-century Christians worshipped Christ as God. Pagans mocked the early Christians for worshipping a crucified God. According to 2nd-century Roman graffiti discovered in 1856 on Palatine, a Christian is caricatured as praying to a crucified figure. Its caption reads, "Alexamenos worships his god." In 111 A.D. Pliny the Younger wrote in a letter to Emperor Trajan about Christians:<br>  <br>  ...it was their habit on a fixed day to assemble before daylight and recite by turn a form of words to Christ as a god." [Pliny, Epistle 97]<br>  <br>  At least to the 2nd-century pagans, it appeared that Christians considered Jesus as their God.<br>  <br>  Some may object to Christ's divinity and cite Bible verses pertaining to His humanity, e.g.:<br>  <br>  ...there is one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus. [1 Tim 2:5]<br>  <br>  Now it must be understood that Jesus Christ is also human. This mystery is called the Incarnation - God becoming man (Gal 4:4). As St. Paul writes:<br>  <br>  In Christ the fullness of Deity resides in bodily form. [Col 2:9; NAB]<br>  <br>  According to the Tome of Leo as proclaimed during the Council of Chalcedon in 451 A.D., Jesus is a divine Person with two natures: a divine nature and a human nature. Christ is both God and man.<br>  <br>  Others may object to Christ's divinity and point to Gospel passages that show His lack of knowledge. According to them, the all-knowing God would not need to ask the crowd, "Who touched my garments?" [Mark 5:30] or during the raising of Lazarus, to ask Mary, "Where have you laid him?" [John 11:34] In reply to their objection, it should be noted that these are rhetorical questions and do not prove Christ's ignorance. God the Father does not show ignorance when He asks Adam, "Where are you?" [Gen 3:9] or Cain, "Where is Abel your brother?" [Gen 4:9] These questions are meant to draw a response from the people. A teacher may ask his students questions not out of ignorance but in order to test or teach them a lesson.<br>  <br>  Now a more troublesome verse concerns Christ's knowledge of Judgement Day:<br>  <br>  "But of that day or that hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son but only the Father." [Mark 13:32; RSV]<br>  <br>  Bishop Richard Challoner responds to this verse in a footnote in the Douay-Rheims Bible:<br>  <br>  Nor the Son. Not that the Son of God is absolutely ignorant of the day of judgement, but that He knoweth it not, as our teacher; that is He knoweth it not so as to teach it to us, as not being expedient.<br>  <br>  In other words Christ knew the Day but was not commissioned to tell us. Some early Church fathers responded by claiming that Christ knew the Day but not through His humanity. For those who are interested, this and other difficult verses are discussed in detail in the book, The Consciousness of Christ by Fr. William G. Most (Front Royal, VA; Christendom College Press, 1980).<br>  <br>  Still some may object to Christ's divinity claiming that there is only one God - God the Father. Now it is true that there is only one God; however, God is also Holy Trinity: "...in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit." [Matt 28:19] The Trinity is three Persons in one God, and not three gods. Jesus Christ is the second Person of the Holy Trinity - God the Son. According to the Bible, "God is love" [1 John 4:16] but for love to be real, it must be between two or more persons. God the Father and God the Son, being two Persons in one divine nature (John 10:30), love each other. This love is so real that it is the third Person - God the Holy Spirit. This is analogous to the love between husband and wife that results in a child (but of course devoid of time and sex). A good discussion on the Trinity can be found in the book, Theology for Beginners by Frank J. Sheed (Ann Arbor, MI; Servant Books, 1981).<br>  <br>  In the Gospel Jesus claims to be an extraordinarily great person yet also humble. Jesus also claims the authority to forgive sins -offenses against God. He claims to be "I AM" -a form of God's name (John 8:24 & 58). The scribes are angered by His claims, seeing them as blasphemy (John 5:18; 10:30). According to the Gospel, even the demons (Mark 1:27) and the weather (Mark 4:41) obey Him. The several references in the Gospel to Christ's human weaknesses do not necessarily void His divinity but are a mystery contained in His Incarnation. As St. John writes: "In the beginning was the Word...and the Word was God...And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us." [John 1:1,14]

The big bang theory is more than just fanciful speculation.  There is concrete evidence supporting it.  It's interesting reading.  Start with Father Georges Lemaitre, a priest and physicist who came up with the idea of the big bang.  <br>  <br>  As for the the birth of life on earth, decades ago experiments were conducted where conditions of the primordial earth were duplicated in the lab.  The result was the creation of organic compounds and amino acids.  Last year I read an article where researchers expect, within the next couple of years, to artificially create a protocell in the lab, a critical first step in creating a model to explain how the process actually worked 4 billion years ago.  Now, if your response is "why haven't they done it yet", I would point out that scientists have been studying this process for a few decades while the actual event took hundreds of millions of years.  No, nothing has been "conveniently overlooked".|`|rGEZup0Zaa	They can.<br>  <br>  Quantum fluctuations in the very fabric of space/time most likely are responsible for the Big Bang singularity.<br>  <br>  Science has a good working model on how abiogenesis would have worked.<br>  <br>  That said, what if they didn't have a good idea? Throughout human history, there have always been gaps in our knowledge; to expect otherwise is a breathtaking display of arrogance.

The new data is giving the theorists fits!<br>  <br>  Astronomer Wendy Freedman and others recently used the Hubble Space Telescope to measure the distance to a galaxy in the constellation of Virgo, and her measurement suggests that the universe is expanding faster, and therefore is younger, than previously thought. In fact, it “implies a cosmic age as little as eight billion years,” reported Scientific American magazine just last June. While eight billion years sounds like a very long time, it is only about half the currently estimated age of the universe. This creates a special problem, since, as the report goes on to note, “other data indicate that certain stars are at least 14 billion years old.” If Freedman’s numbers hold up, those elderly stars would turn out to be older than the big bang itself!<br>  <br>  Still another problem for the big bang has come from steadily mounting evidence of “bubbles” in the universe that are 100?million light-years in size, with galaxies on the outside and voids inside. Margaret Geller, John Huchra, and others at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics have found what they call a great wall of galaxies some 500 million light-years in length across the northern sky. Another group of astronomers, who became known as the Seven Samurai, have found evidence of a different cosmic conglomeration, which they call the Great Attractor, located near the southern constellations of Hydra and Centaurus. Astronomers Marc Postman and Tod Lauer believe something even bigger must lie beyond the constellation Orion, causing hundreds of galaxies, including ours, to stream in that direction like rafts on a sort of “river in space.”<br>  <br>  All this structure is baffling. Cosmologists say the blast from the big bang was extremely smooth and uniform, according to the background radiation it allegedly left behind. How could such a smooth start have led to such massive and complex structures? “The latest crop of walls and attractors intensifies the mystery of how so much structure could have formed within the 15-billion-year age of the universe,” admits Scientific American—a problem that only gets worse as Freedman and others roll back the estimated age of the cosmos still more.<br>  <br>  “We Are Missing Some Fundamental Element”<br>  <br>  Geller’s three-dimensional maps of thousands of clumped, tangled, and bubbled galactic agglomerations have transformed the way scientists picture the universe. She does not pretend to understand what she sees. Gravity alone appears unable to account for her great wall. “I often feel we are missing some fundamental element in our attempts to understand this structure,” she admits.<br>  <br>  Geller enlarged on her misgivings: “We clearly do not know how to make large structure in the context of the Big Bang.” Interpretations of cosmic structure on the basis of current mapping of the heavens are far from definitive—more like trying to picture the whole world from a survey of Rhode Island, U.S.A. Geller continued: “Someday we may find that we haven’t been putting the pieces together in the right way, and when we do, it will seem so obvious that we’ll wonder why we hadn’t thought of it much sooner.”<br>  <br>  That leads to the biggest question of all: What is supposed to have caused the big bang itself? No less an authority than Andrei Linde, one of the originators of the very popular inflationary version of the big bang theory, frankly admits that the standard theory does not address this fundamental question. “The first, and main, problem is the very existence of the big bang,” he says. “One may wonder, What came before? If space-time did not exist then, how could everything appear from nothing? .?.?. Explaining this initial singularity—where and when it all began—still remains the most intractable problem of modern cosmology.”<br>  <br>  An article in Discover magazine recently concluded that “no reasonable cosmologist would claim that the Big Bang is the ultimate theory.”|`|1TYZDRUqaa	CONVENIENTLY OVERLOOKED?  OVERLOOKED?  By Whom?  There are a lot of biologists and archaeologists and even Geologists looking into this question.  Why not ask why man in the 14th Century didn't build an Airplane.  Why didn't Leonardo Develop blood transfusions? It was simply beyond their technological and scientific abilities Today, we have more scientific knowledge, but by no means claim to have all the answers.  We just have not discovered the elusive "spark" of life, yet.  But it is by no means OVERLOOKED.  Science readily admits that they don't have the answers to everything, but they are researching and trying to come up with an answer.  Man, certain people need to put down the bible and other religious mumbo-jumbo, and pick up a copy of SCIENCE TODAY or at least a high school biology text!<br>  <br>  Yeah. maybe you should delete the question.

Any judge who allows a crime to go unpunished is not an honorable judge - he would in fact be considered unjust and unfit for the job! And if God is God, and God is merciful as well as just, the He would provide a way to escape that judgment.<br>  <br>  Another thing to think about ... "If God is willing to stay with me in spite of my meanness, my weakness, my stubborn self-righteousness, then who am I to hold those things against someone else? Better I should confess my own sins than keep track of yours, only it is hard to stay focused on my shortcomings. I would so rather stay focused on yours, especially when they are hurtful to me. Staying angry with you is how I protect myself from you. Refusing to forgive you is not only how I punish you; it is also how I keep you from getting close enough to hurt me again, and nine times out of ten it works, only there is a serious side effect. It is called bitterness, and it can do terrible things to the human body and soul.” <br>         ~Barbara Brown Taylor|`|0e1a52da665fe02e7fc9835ad47b35feaa	I think you just did spit in Gods face.--do you feel better--what happened to you--why disparage the Chinese|`|2ChgHqo8aa	Perhaps....

My dad said to buy the diapers, and he'd pray for the food. He immediately knelt down at the couch at 4 a.m. and asked God for food. BEFORE HE EVEN FINISHED HIS PRAYER, there was a knock on the door.<br>  When my dad opened the door, it was a man down the street whom we knew through mutual friends. He was holding a huge box. He told my dad that he was moving and had bought a BRAND NEW refrigerator for his new house, but just about an half hour ago, it had mysteriously gone ka-put and died. He then asked if my dad had any spare room in our refrigerator and freezer for the food. He said we could keep it for ourselves if we could use it.<br>  <br>  That is not coincidence -- his NEW refrigerator going out just minutes before my dad's decision to trust God for food, and he chose my family to give the food to half way down the street instead of giving it to his next door neighbor or anyone else for that matter...

God has already done what needed to be done to save us from ourselves. He sacrificed His only son in order to purchase your soul from Satan. It's a gift. You can't earn it. You just accept it. As for this world, the human race is one of free will. The messes in this world are of our own making. But have no doubt, He does take care of those who believe in Him. Others who don't are just wandering around lost, afraid and empty. Thank God that as a believer I can believe what the Scripture says about us being strangers in a strange land and that this is not our home - we're just passing through. I feel deeply sorry for those who will be left behind. Eternity outside of the presence of God, to me, is unimaginable despair. His people are not devastated but rather are well armed with power and authority over all evil forces that seek to harm them. We cannot control the behavior of others but we are responsible for participating in fulfilling the Great Commission which is to "Go out into all the world and preach the Gospel". When the entire world has had the opportunity to hear the truth and accept or reject it, (which thanks to technology makes the fulfillment of the commission more and more rapid) then Jesus will come and take His church home. Those who rejected him will be left to cope with the most frightening time in the history of the human race. Those who then come to the Lord even though it will cost them their lives will go to Heaven. Those who "take the mark" of the anti-christ will be swallowed up in the pit of Hell. Sorry but I didn't make the conditions, God did. He is a merciful God but He has His limits. There are many who are simply unreachable even though He, "stands at the door and knocks" all day every day. Eventually, those who ignore Him and refuse to open the door to Him will be given up as lost. Jesus told us that we (Christians) would have many troubles in this life and that the "world would hate us because of him". You can see the evidence of that clearly on this web site. But despite that, those who persevere will finish the race as winners and wear the victor's crown. Don't let your heart be troubled by the things of this world. They will unfold as they will.

The term applies to all who deny what the Bible says about Jesus Christ, all who oppose his Kingdom, and all who mistreat his followers. It also includes individuals, organizations, and nations that falsely claim to represent Christ or that improperly ascribe to themselves the role of Messiah.<br>  Does the Bible refer to only one antichrist?<br>  1 John 2:18: “Young children, it is the last hour, and, just as you have heard that antichrist is coming, even now there have come to be many antichrists; from which fact we gain the knowledge that it is the last hour.”<br>  2 John 7: “Many deceivers have gone forth into the world, persons not confessing Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the antichrist.” (Notice that the “many antichrists” of 1 John 2:18 are here referred to collectively as “the antichrist.”)<br>  Is the coming of the antichrist reserved for some future time?<br>  1 John 4:3: “Every inspired expression that does not confess Jesus does not originate with God. Furthermore, this is the antichrist’s inspired expression which you have heard was coming, and now it is already in the world.” (That was written near the end of the first century C.E.)<br>  1 John 2:18: “Even now there have come to be many antichrists; from which fact we gain the knowledge that it is the last hour.” (By “last hour” John evidently meant the end of the apostolic period. The other apostles had died, and John himself was very old.)<br>  Some of those identified as antichrist—<br>  Persons who deny that Jesus is truly the Messiah<br>  1 John 2:22: “Who is the liar if it is not the one that denies that Jesus is the Christ [or, Messiah, anointed one]? This is the antichrist.”<br>  All who deny that Jesus is the unique Son of God<br>  1 John 2:22: “This is the antichrist, the one that denies the Father and the Son.”<br>  Compare John 10:36; Luke 9:35.<br>  Apostates<br>  1 John 2:18, 19: “There have come to be many antichrists . . . They went out from us, but they were not of our sort.”<br>  Those who oppose Christ’s true followers<br>  John 15:20, 21: “If they have persecuted me, they will persecute you also . . . But they will do all these things against you on account of my name.”<br>  Individuals and nations that oppose Christ as King or that themselves falsely claim the Messianic role<br>  Ps. 2:2: “The kings of earth take their stand and high officials themselves have massed together as one against Jehovah and against his anointed one [Christ, or Messiah].”<br>  See also Revelation 17:3, 12-14; 19:11-21.<br>  Matt. 24:24: “False Christs and false prophets will arise and will give great signs and wonders so as to mislead, if possible, even the chosen ones.”|`|5dd9f713d05a77a1692fce6c06009484aa	It's probably someone we will all least expect.<br>  <br>  Maybe it's Bin Laden.

This is the antichrist, the one who denies the Father and the Son. Whoever denies the Son does not have the Father; the one who confesses the Son has the Father also." <br>  1 John 4:2-3 "By this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God; and every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God; and this is the spirit of the antichrist, of which you have heard that it is coming, and now it is already in the world." <br>  2 John 1:7 "For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who do not acknowledge Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the antichrist."  the "antichrist" is defined as anyone who doesn't believe Jesus is the divine son of God. Second, "antichrists" appear to actively teach against Christ. Third, there were many "antichrists" in the world when John wrote the book. This directly contradicts the teaching of modern speculationists who say that one antichrist will arise at some still future time. "Anti-Christ" is anyone who opposes Christ.  Take this test to see if you are an "antichrist": 1. Do you actively teach or simply believe that Jesus Christ never walked the earth, but was a mythological figure? 2. Do you actively teach or simply believe there was a man named Jesus Christ, but he did not actually raise from the dead? 3. Do you actively speak out against or simply believe Christianity is a false religion? 4. Jesus said, "He who is not with Me is against Me; and he who does not gather with Me scatters" Matthew 12:30. Are you an atheist or agnostic who is indifferent and non-religious? Then you too are an "antichrist"! The Bible term "antichrist" could be simply understood to be equivalent to being a "non-believer."|`|b9906294d88c8e875c10481120cf0286aa	* According to the bible the anti christ is just an non believer who says Christ is not the son of God.

En la cruz hay colocada una leyenda que dice INRI; esto es: "Iesus Nazarenus Rex Iudeorum", que significa "Jesús, el Nazareno, Rey de los Judíos".

b3TljD0Laa	Shonen Jump (少年ジャンプ) is a magazine made up of just manga (Japanese comics) that a publishing company called Shuueisha publishes weekly in Japan. Some series that you may have heard of that is in or has been in the magazine are Naruto, Bleach, One Piece, and Dragon Ball Z. Most popular anime (Japanese animated TV shows) originate from Shonen Jump. Shonen (少年) means little boy, but it's completely normal for girls to read the magazine, too.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!<br>  <br>  *As a native, I have never heard of "Shonen Ai" before used as the romantic part of a gay guy's relationship or sexual part of a young boy's relationship, but I Wikipedia-ed it and got that 少年愛 (shounen ai) means the romantic or sexual portion of a boy's relationship in adolescent years with a grown man. Here's the link: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pederasty" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pederasty</a><br>  I guess I learned something today :o/|`|O7w6XGqPaa	The characters for Shonen 少年 literally mean 'few years'.|`|EmP273JKaa	sometimes transliterated as shounen or shonen, is a Japanese word used in English to refer to manga intended for young boys. hope this helped
8cjFSBW9aa	A true hero is someone who puts the good of the people before his own needs.  He or she is basically peaceful but will fight to protect their family or country against anybody who would harm them or take away their way of life and their livlihood. They may be afraid but they don't let fear stop them from doing what is right and what is right is usually the most difficult action to take. A hero sticks up for others who cannot stick up for themselves and won't tolerate others belittling others for being poor or handicapped or different. A hero is may be very strong but he or she is never , ever a bully and in fact, protects other from bullies whether the bullies are people or countries  trying to take advantage of smaller countries or peaceful countries who don't have the resources to defend themselves. And a true Hero will never boast about his good deeds but go quietly about his business. He or she does what is right just because it is the right thing to do.<br>  I don't know that I would put Alexander the Great in a class with the Heros. He was a brilliant leader and warrior but was brutal and ruthless in conquering smaller countries and didn't mind how many people had to die for him to gain their lands.<br>  King Arthur and Hercules were most likely fictional but we like to think that people like them did exist and were noble.<br>  To me Heros are all kinds of people, maybe like Abraham Lincoln, Martin Luther King, all of the great scientist who helped eradicate some of the deadly illnesses that killed millions and the scientists who work tirelessly today to try to beat AIDS and Cancers, and MS, and MD, and the great thinkers that we have who try to negotiate with others so we don't destroy our planet, and the men who walked on the moon and the people who worked so hard to put them there. Today, these people are heros and many go quietly about their work without recognition but come up  with things everyday to make our lives easier and longer.|`|dhcv3Hy7aa	A hero can be anyone, by his or her deeds. it can be as simple as a little boy admiring his dad, to a firefighter saving lives. it all depends on who and what you are.|`|mMUydkXBaa	any body pure spirited (or close to it) can be a hero in many different ways. it jus depends on how u look at it
Kpg5i1LUaa	Yes, people fear the unknown, especially death, so they leach on to a religion to make themselves fell better about dieing.  Religion is about death..What will happen when you die?  If you believe in God you go to heaven, if you don't you got to hell.  When people say they don't believe in God, what is a Christians first thought..."They're going to hell!...Why wouldn't they believe so they can have a life of eternal happiness!?!?"  And then they say..."Well, God still loves you, you'll see the light someday."  Or they come right out and say..."Your going to hell!"  Well thanks for the update, now I feel great.  Why do they believe, because yeah some Christians really believe God exists, but I think a lot of people fear the idea of nothing when they die, so the idea of this great place where you'll be happy forever and always get what you want seems awesome...and yeah it creeps me out too...but that isn't enough to make myself believe in God.<br>  <br>  <br>  Sorry for only using Christians as an example, I know it isn't just you guys that say things like that...I used to be Christian so that was the religion that came out when I typed it up..|`|841f87de333d69e66afd00bb5aaee1aaaa	not necessarily......more of both, like the past of what happened before anything was written down. That`s why there are so may different religions because certain people took different sides of how the world came to be. Well yes you are right too, because they (the different religions) predict that in the future for example, i am catholic and when we die we will go to heaven. And there are different religions that say other things like that. Also, it tells how you should live your life and why you should do this and that. What is also wrong is right, how you should treat others, etc.Does that answer your question ?|`|AA10154378	Yep, notice how people become more religious after mass disasters and death.|`|AdgGdhNOaa	no but panic and anxiety disorders are<br>  jo|`|lSyBbdajaa	nope, its about anticipation of the unknown, of God, of my Creator, of my Father, of my Friend, of my Protector.

It consists in uttering against God - inwardly or outwardly - words of hatred, reproach, or defiance; in speaking ill of God; in failing in respect toward him in one's speech; in misusing God's name. St. James condemns those "who blaspheme that honorable name [of Jesus] by which you are called." The prohibition of blasphemy extends to language against Christ's Church, the saints, and sacred things. It is also blasphemous to make use of God's name to cover up criminal practices, to reduce peoples to servitude, to torture persons or put them to death. The misuse of God's name to commit a crime can provoke others to repudiate religion. <br>  Blasphemy is contrary to the respect due God and his holy name.

But he pharo didnt understand his dream until Josef explained it to him, cos God did not juts tell it to him symply, he used metaphores and stuff to symbolise what was to come.<br>  <br>  Scienctists have figured out that dreams r the brain's way of arranging or tidying up what happend during the time that the mind was contious, but i think that God also uses dreams in different ways.|`|4d0190b99e0c8cf5fc231cc46e670075aa	i dont know that is a good question but he can talk to you in your dreams bye now god bless you|`|cd858ac857133f1f771e31af7509a064aa	Many things...<br>  Joseph in the Old Testament was an interpreter of dreams for Pharoah.

There is a big prejustice against them though mostly because a large number of them especially the illegal ones that came first are responsible for numerous brutal crimes and murders. Of course it does not apply to all of them but it is really a fact. There are many immigrants in Greece from nigeria,pakistan, and other countries but is very rare that crimes are committed by them, it is Albanians mostly that do it all the time and this is why Greeks do not feel very well about them unlike all the other immigrants .

So, to not embarrass her, she wore a hat whenever the two of them went somewhere. It was a little weird for all of us, but mostly, we admired her courage. Eventually her hair grew back.

I don't believe that everything in society is corrupt and that honest people with integrity don't have a shot. If I believed that then there would be no reason to get out of bed everyday, go to work , support my family because what would be the point? Why have children and raise them with morals just to throw them out into a corrupt society to be swallowed up? Corruption has always been since the beginning of time when the big people with power tried to kill off the smaller people who tried to have their own society and their own power. Brains will always win out over bullies with muscles but no smarts. <br>   Greed has always existed and has been the major  cause for wars when one country would try to overtake a smaller country for their land and goods. The smaller countries would join together and fight and sometimes lose but alot of times they would win. <br>  I believe that as long as there are good people who are willing to step outside of their comfort zone and stand up for themselves and tell others of the corruption, then the good people will always band together and fight the corrupt people. Bad people will only stay in power if the good people stay quiet and still.  It has always been that way. Sometimes it takes a while to get the bad people out, but truly good people don't give in just because the odds look bad and they might lose. Remember, patience is a virtue and so is persistance.<br>  Speak out and be heard---Vote! Campaign for the good! Call on other good people to vote and campaign with you and they will. If you aren't willing to try to change things, then don't complain when things stay the same!<br>  Maybe I am just simple, but I choose to believe that the whole world is not corrupt and when corruption is found, moral and just people will band together to stop it. If you are a good person, don't be quiet and still or you will be devoured by your own inaction. Speak out against the bad guys. Good will always win over evil or the world would have been destroyed a long time ago.

All this goes back to the main laws by loving God with all your heart, mind and spirit and to love others as yourself.  So, if you don't love yourself, you can't love others or if you don't treat others as you would like to be treated, you don't really love yourself.

But the Spirit is the last of the persons of the Holy Trinity to be revealed. St. Gregory of Nazianzus, the Theologian, explains this progression in terms of the pedagogy of divine "condescension": <br>  <br>  The Old Testament proclaimed the Father clearly, but the Son more obscurely. The New Testament revealed the Son and gave us a glimpse of the divinity of the Spirit. Now the Spirit dwells among us and grants us a clearer vision of himself. It was not prudent, when the divinity of the Father had not yet been confessed, to proclaim the Son openly and, when the divinity of the Son was not yet admitted, to add the Holy Spirit as an extra burden, to speak somewhat daringly. . . . By advancing and progressing "from glory to glory," the light of the Trinity will shine in ever more brilliant rays.
RdmRwv9iaa	1108 In every liturgical action the Holy Spirit is sent in order to bring us into communion with Christ and so to form his Body. The Holy Spirit is like the sap of the Father's vine which bears fruit on its branches. The most intimate cooperation of the Holy Spirit and the Church is achieved in the liturgy. The Spirit who is the Spirit of communion, abides indefectibly in the Church. For this reason the Church is the great sacrament of divine communion which gathers God's scattered children together. Communion with the Holy Trinity and fraternal communion are inseparably the fruit of the Spirit in the liturgy.|`|c9a1b864f1a97925067a5a7737860ac4aa	To have the Holy Spirit as our "Paraclete" is to have God Himself indwelling us as believers. He teaches us the Word and guides us into the truth of that Word. He also reminds us of what He has taught us so that we can depend on God's Word in the difficult times of life. The Spirit uses the Word to give us His peace (John 14:27), His love (John 15:9, 10), and His joy (John 15:11). These are profound truths that comfort our hearts and minds in a troubled world. The power of this indwelling "paraclete" gives us the ability to "live by the Spirit so that we will not gratify the desires of the sinful flesh" and "Since we live by the Spirit, let us keep in step with the Spirit (Galatians 5:16, 25). We, then, can have the "fruit of the Spirit" produced in our own lives (Galatians 5:22, 23) to the glory of God the Father. What a blessing to have the Holy Spirit in our lives as our "paraclete," our Comforter, our Encourager, our Counselor, and our Advocate. Thank you, Father, for your wonderful gift!<br>  <br>  Recommended Resource: The Holy Spirit by Charles Ryrie.
RdmRwv9iaa	2847 The Holy Spirit makes us discern between trials, which are necessary for the growth of the inner man, and temptation, which leads to sin and death. We must also discern between being tempted and consenting to temptation. Finally, discernment unmasks the lie of temptation, whose object appears to be good, a "delight to the eyes" and desirable, when in reality its fruit is death. <br>  <br>  God does not want to impose the good, but wants free beings. . . . There is a certain usefulness to temptation. No one but God knows what our soul has received from him, not even we ourselves. But temptation reveals it in order to teach us to know ourselves, and in this way we discover our evil inclinations and are obliged to give thanks for the goods that temptation has revealed to us.|`|AA11416985	Only when Satan is on earth pretending to be Christ / /God.

Some books are written for the highly educated, others for children, still others for those in specialized fields. While the Bible is easily available to all, it is meant to be understood and appreciated by a particular group of people. Jehovah crafted it for the humble, the meek ones of the earth. Such people can grasp the sense of the Bible, whatever their education, culture, station in life, or ethnic group. (1?Timothy 2:3,?4) On the other hand, an understanding of Bible truth is denied to those not rightly disposed, no matter how intelligent or educated they may be. The haughty, the proud, cannot grasp the precious truths of God’s Word. (Matthew 13:11-15; Luke 10:21; Acts 13:48) Only God could produce such a book.<br>  <br>  Jehovah’s Servants Know the Truth<br>  <br>   In a description of “the time of the end,” the prophet Daniel foretold quite a different development among God’s people—a revival of religious truth. He wrote: “Many will rove about, and the true knowledge will become abundant.” (Daniel 12:4) Jehovah’s people are not confused or blinded by the great Deceiver. Roving through the pages of the Bible, they have come to acquire true knowledge. In the first century, Jesus enlightened his disciples. He “opened up their minds fully to grasp the meaning of the Scriptures.” (Luke 24:45) In our day, Jehovah has acted similarly. Through his Word, his spirit, and his organization, he has enabled millions throughout the earth to understand what he already knows—the truth.

I think its bad that there's a term African American- it's racist because anyone who's not white has to have a label in front of "American"<br>  <br>  Asian-American, African American, Hispanic-American, etc. But if you're white, oh you're just good 'ol American. Mind you I AM white (or, "European American").

And as said before, not all black americans are from Africa.|`|SBF6jqlLaa	Born in Africa or not, we have AFRICAN ancestry.

You are regardless of whether you are a naturalized or native born citizen you are an American by choice or chance. You owe your ultimate allegiance here if you do not feel that way go somewhere bloody else no one is keeping you here. Personally I am an American a product or a melting pot of both cultural and ethnic blending. A product of hard work and the puritan work ethic, I will add in the sweat of my brow and my genes to make my children even better. That makes me an American, that makes me a capitalist and that makes me Free.|`|86692840fce86f8a24dea58512123d09aa	yeah kim! I have friends who are from Africa who are therefore african americans. I think the term African American is ignorant cuz a lot of black ppl come from places other than africa (haiti, south pacific, etc). <br>  <br>  Also, as a European American who was born in Germany with a German father and American mother, I would not agree that you would be considered a European american. You are an American of European descent. <br>  <br>  Sorry, I disagree completly!|`|kHx1upOpaa	call yourself whatever you want i dont care, America would originally be called turtle island so you would be a turtle islander. Who are you mad at white people can do what they want to do they are the majority who is stoping them. People are really stupid. I have white ancestors but you know what? If i was considered black for 400 plus years why would i say iam not now. Black or African America will do, but who made white people the controller of what every other race should be called. Call yourselves whatever you like.|`|wkKJpCwRaa	Well do it. I didn't choose to be called African American, as a matter of fact I refer myself simply as Black.

I hear Italian American, Irish American, Mexican American, Asian American, all of whom were born in America, and nobody complains about it. Why do you all complain about African American?

Christ ascends into heaven.|`|RdmRwv9iaa	2640 St. Luke in his gospel often expresses wonder and praise at the marvels of Christ and in his Acts of the Apostles stresses them as actions of the Holy Spirit: the community of Jerusalem, the invalid healed by Peter and John, the crowd that gives glory to God for that, and the pagans of Pisidia who "were glad and glorified the word of God."
MiKrWuM6aa	It means you like the color black.|`|FlqRi0ZYaa	i wear black all the time it dont mean your emo punk of what ever im big in the heavy metal thing so i guess you could say im a metal chick but i dont over do my makeup or anything like emo people.|`|AA11957676	your not really anything. u just like the color black. there's no problem in liking the color black, it also depends on how your hair is and accessories<br>  <br>  xoxo?<br>  blair|`|iiJK4Ivraa	it means your lame|`|aTiYaMhEaa	entirely wearing black doesn't mean you're any of those.  if you tend to wear black lace, spikes, or other things like that you'd be goth, its hard to describe punk style (for me, anyway), or chucks, tight jeans, tight hoodies then you'd be emo.  But, for example, my friend wears black daily and she's none of those groups.  wearing black is a common theme for all groups, but to be any of them you'd have to elaborate.|`|0Uo4blPeaa	Well, if your emo you cut yourself, if your goth your kind of depressing to to others around you, and punk your kind of fun and like a rockstar. Being any of these is based on your personality not what you wear, but your clothing does help. I think you just like black|`|SD5fWnRraa	You just like to be different. When i was in 8th and 9th grade that's all i wore was black. I was still bubbly and fun to be around. My friends  wore pink and colors like that. We were like complete opposites on the outside but just like each other inside mostly except for the fact they dont own one black pair of anything. You'll most likely get out of that stage when your older. Plus its awesome to be different.|`|khbSXMcIaa	i think you just like the color... i do, too... but i don't wear it all the time.<br>  <br>  don't get caught up in stereo types... there just a waste of time.|`|e4xbHQQjaa	I wear all black, but I like punk rock. It depends on what music you like. It's possible to like everything. It's hard to be close minded when there is so much good music out there.|`|lUzonjLfaa	It depends.....if you like heavy metal music then your punk, if ur into emo then your emotional and all that crap, if your gothic you like purple and black.|`|Bc4RNrfwaa	Stereotypically you dress emo, gothic like. But emos ut themseleves and are emotional...|`|PseiMJd2aa	I'd say emo cos of the clothing type|`|tVMHwsZ2aa	goth. if you were emo you would be cutting yourself and isolated. you would be punk if you wore more bright colors and had cool highlights in your hair and was crazy. <br>  goth if your in between that.|`|lA1RHSaiaa	It means you have no friends..|`|6f71b2cd793ff1b2e18fbf2a075142a9aa	You could be a beatnik for all I know.  ;)|`|FURfPEZoaa	.....<br>  It means you try to hard.

bt4n3hs1aa	the bible used to be called "joke book" but somebody changed the name|`|AA10551261	We all lust it's part of  being physically attracted to somebody. It 's just when that lust turns into midnights  spanking the monkey and watching porn or having sex with multiple partners then it becomes a problem.|`|AA11581131	Lust is a sin because of the loss of control - daydreaming of sex, actually being involved in sexual acts with no respect (3, 4 partners) - and the lies involved to get sex this often. The cheap regard one has for others, not respecting others as equals. The men or women a lustful person is with are not thought of as people and their feelings never enter into what the lustful out of control person does to them.<br>  Lust hurts marriages, as having made a commitment to one - lies and being with others obviously mean you lied about the love you have for the marriage partner. Lust hurts the children of marriages, also.|`|ZYaekU6Oaa	If you examine each of these questions you have posed, you will find there are real practical reasons and benefits to avoid these sins.  There is an element in following what the Bible says because it says so, but the truth is, it wouldn't be there if it wasn't in our best interest.|`|6013156a8de2bf8ab0ac50903c06fb9daa	Well,yeah. See lust was to attract a man to a women. And that they might have sexual intercourse for the sole purpose of populating the earth, not just because it feels awesome. But as usual we have perverted the true meaning as with everything else. Take care and may God bless you spiritually.|`|AA11349867	Lust is the opposite of love, to lust is to want, while to love is to give. What is your opinion of Selfish people?<br>  Is it a sin to want? No. but it is a sin to want something/someone that's not yours to have. <br>  This desire (LUST), can cause a person to do treacherous things to get what one wants.|`|DuuwThcvaa	I think you answered your own question. Some branches of the Christian religion believe in all of the Bible. Hence since it says it's a sin, then that is what they believe. It's not exactly rocket science...|`|HzmJkHMHaa	no sh*t. they believe in the bible therefore the bible says its a sin. there is no such thing as sin outside of the bible.|`|d716bc423a31e62fd11b73b9782e5b26aa	Yes.<br>  <br>  Lust is a strong desire like envy and can lead to things that could be ungodly.|`|e902bd019b523886ce02c7a1ed93f381aa	the bible does'nt just have rules to restrict us and make life miserable. God's guidelines can also make life better for us.<br>  <br>  When the bible says lust is bad it is because it can lead to problems. <br>  <br>  Out of lust a man or woman can develop a porn addiction leading to strain on the marriage relationship. This affects the kids, possibly the man's productivity on the job and by extension the boss and their marriage therapist.<br>  <br>  And although rape is about power and control. Lust is still a factor in many cases. How many times have you hear of the gang raped by suitors who she turned down? Who does this affect: the state who have to sentence the perpetrators, the family of the victim etc. etc.<br>  <br>  A father lusting after his daughter can stoop as low as having an incestuous relationship with her damaging not only the daugther but affecting the entire family and in EVERY society in EVERY country we can see why the bible suggestion that people should'nt lust is appropriate christian or not.|`|RdmRwv9iaa	God frequently warns of His great wrath with those who practice idolatry and which is amply expressed beginning with the First of the Ten Commandments: "...thou shalt not have strange gods before Me." Many mistakenly think of idolatry as the worship or rendering to objects or symbols. In reality it is the denial of God who is replaced by a creature "that is treated as an end in itself." 1 In fact, a common subject of idolatry is one's own self! Rebellion is also an adjunct of idolatry: "Because it is like the sin of witchcraft to rebel; and like the crime of idolatry to refuse to obey." 2 <br>  <br>  Idolatry is the first sister of "pride" which "is the beginning of all sin..." 3 Inordinate self-love is a virulent form of idolatry and is of which we shall here discuss. "We will follow either the God of the Bible, or worship ourselves. We thus advance toward a state of society in which not only man but every impulse in each man claims priority." 4|`|19nQDjEmaa	No, because God says it is a sin! 1 John 2:16 says For everything that belongs to the world- The lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride in one's lifestyle- is not from the Father, but is from the world. 17- And the world with its lust is passing away, but the one who does God's will remains forever.(HCSB)

stR1PYixaa	I think this is a reasonable question because we are more comfortable with people who are like us - whether it is race, education, nationality etc.<br>  <br>  Many Black churches, unless they are part of mainline denominations do not get a lot of White people visiting them. At first they may look at you funny as they wonder why you are there but I believe that if you are genuine (and you sound as if you are) they would welcome you, like any other visitor, with open arms.<br>  <br>  They would also love to know that you appreciate Black church music. So many comments I have heard from Whites is that it is okay but too loud, too noisy... Go and enjoy the worship of which the music is only a part.<br>  <br>  p.s. I know you meant no offense (because you did the same with White) but Black and White should begin with a "capital" letter|`|AA11214952	Of course you would!!!<br>  <br>  I had a black friend a couple years ago and went to his church with him a lot!

Yes you should be welcomed based on their testimony of faith but rascism is everywhere so don't be suprised if they make it known that your not welcome. Here up north we have a white church called Massillon Baptist Temple and they will allow blacks to visit but upon saying the sinners prayer they send them to an all black church called Shiloah Baptist. Even up here they races remain seperate for the most part.|`|ae84e79b36a331301de9b2c763e823a2aa	Personally, I would ask the pastor first just so he knows you are coming. And I am quite sure that you would be welcome by most everyone. Only be careful of the few who may see you are an intruder. And even then though the Pastor would surely take care of that. <br>  <br>  Good Luck<br>  <br>  PS: Try walking into an all black bar sometime.

AA11100119	It is true that alot of people don't seem to teach manners or respect or eddicate anymore. I was raised to send thank you cards, place my hands on my lap, no elbows on the table, and to say please, thank you, and pardon me. I am very very lucky that my children have followed me in the art of kindness, and that I have a husband who also believes our children should have manners. Thank you.|`|3566188061f294a16807056333d8ef6caa	A lot of kids are being taught to be more vocal to adults.  I remember when I was being raised, my parents taught me that it was impolite to speak out of turn and/or interrupt adults (for a non emergency matter) while they were speaking.  I believe it worked well for me in the long haul because I have learned to be a great listener.  My nephew, who is seven, has not been taught this and regularly disrespects his teachers, parents..even grandparents by demanding their attention.  He doesn't have the idea that adults (as long as they aren't trying to harm you) should be respected.   I am trying to teach him this before it is completely too late.|`|AA10091834	So many things are falling by the wayside.  I remember when we used to dress up to travel - go on an airplane. We had so many things that we valued and it's not there anymore.|`|lYqzrDLKaa	If a parent does not have manners how can they teach their children?  I also was taught manners.  It goes back to the biblical saying do unto others as you would have them so unto you.  Instead of thinking about yourself, think of the other person. We all have to live on this planet and it helps to respect one another.  Unfortnately we have too many self-absorbed people that we live among that say ME first.  To be fair, some people are just not thinking and are in a world of their own so they may appear rude.  Don't take it personal.|`|z0SiemB8aa	No.<br>  <br>  I don't think that "some" parents are teaching their kids manners. <br>  <br>  We are actually moving to a different town in a different state soon, because of this issue.<br>  <br>  Around where we live now, the kids just run wild with no care in the world. It's nuts. <br>  <br>  There is stealing, property damage, teenage alcohol abuse, pregnacy,  fights, rapes, ditching school, extreme vulgarity, lack of parental respect, lack of adult respect for any adult, lying, smoking, drinking in school, & so much more. <br>  <br>  And when I talk about this ... all this lack of morals & manners. In our lil town, I am talking about 14 years old and younger.<br>  <br>  Not even high school age.<br>  <br>  I really want to get to this new town that I have been to where the overall morals in kids and adults is amazing.<br>  <br>  Where I can raise my kids and not worry so much about what they are seeing at school. Just let them be kids. Like kids should be.<br>  <br>  People tell is us we have very good kids and we are very proud, but I wish my kids had a better environment to grow up in. <br>  <br>  My wish is coming true, we are moving!|`|ad6e7288a20d10fdb21fab5a13459eb3aa	Most parents rely on tv now to teach their children. Parents are working all the time and don't have time for manners. A lot of kids are just brats who wouldn't use manners anyway. My parents didn't teach me manners. I taught myself.|`|jSo7Hy7Haa	I think parents are neglecting that aspect of raising their children and it will really not help them succeed.<br>  <br>  It is probably due to the fact that the parents have so many obligations that they handle one more aspect of child rearing.<br>  <br>  I do like being around people with manners too.

We're here.<br>  <br>  OK, in a slightly more serious vein, here's a sketchy, secular, scientific rundown of how we are supposed to have come into being. 6.6 billion years ago, the universe was a bunch of swirling gases and whatnot. These gases condensed, some into the Sun, and others (attracted by the Sun's gravity) into planets and asteroids and such. Thus did Earth come into existence. Earth underwent a melting/cooling process, and the time was ripe for life. Somewhere along the line, a bit of Earthly matter was struck by lightning while hanging out near a lava pool and got transformed into organic molecules, which in turn evolved self-replication capabilities. By and by, the organic molecules underwent several evolutionary (read: secular! atheist! Mother Nature!) miracles. These organic molecules are the non-Biblical, all-species-encompassing version of Adam and Eve. Everything today descended from these organic molecules in many, many, complex, vaguely specific, still-being-studied steps.<br>  <br>  We are supposed to be descended from primates. Along the evolutionary way, we became less and less monkey/ape-like and increasingly resembled our modern appearance. However, there were several branches of these anthropoid species co-existing and inter-breeding may have occurred. Eventually, around 125,000 years ago, the first modern humans arrived. These look exactly look us, and we wouldn't be able to discern them from the general population if we met them on the streets. Thus is the nature of the evolution of the human race according to Science.<br>  <br>  In short, we all supposedly came into being by way of a freak natural accident - all purely by CHANCE. By this token, there is no "meaning" to life, moral inhibitions are of our own creation, we are deluding ourselves and preventing ourselves from embarking on the road to high hedonism!<br>  <br>  If your intellect can stand this insult of random events, feel free to subscribe to it.

I discovered my stepdaughter was involved in a relationship with another girl.  We let her know we loved her, but we wouldn't support her choice.  We told her if she was adult enough to have sex, then she was old enough to live on her own.  She wasn't a child anymore.   I had two other kids that didn't need to be around that lifestyle.<br>  <br>  It was hard to sit back.  She wrecked 3 cars, went bankrupt at 19. But that was her life.  We told her that where she was in life at that moment was because of every decision she made to that time.  If she wanted a different life, she would have to make different decisions.<br>  <br>  It took a few more years before she broke it off with her gal pal.  She wanted to change her life around, and we helped.  Now she's got a good job, and is engaged to a nice young man.<br>  <br>  This is a true story.  None of it is made up.  Today she states that her sexuality was her choice.  We're glad that we took our stand and believe we did the right thing. Some parents would just accept their kids choice and would not act to correct the problem.  <br>  <br>  But why?  Parents wouldn't just give their kids the keys to the car and tell them what ever you do is fine, why do this with a kids sexuality?  Parents need to guide their kids through life, that their job.<br>  <br>  And I would like to share this experience with everyone because I want them to know that whom you have sex with is not predetermined, it's a choice you make.|`|cbdccad87de6e2ef9563a4eae09fd246aa	Spectrum you are going to get some very silly answers... if you put those people all together they still couldnt get past double digit IQ

Smithsonian Skull is claimed to be from the Aztecs, not Mayans...<br>  Crystal skulls are also referenced by author Drunvalo Melchizedek in his book Serpent of Light.

AA11232725	When you ask what is wrong with today's "church" you have to define your terms. According to the Bible the "church" or ecclesiastes consists of all born again believers who have been "called out" from this godless world system by God.<br>  <br>  There have always been religious establishments that claimed to be this church or that church. The Scriptures prophecy about people no longer accepting sound doctrine and heaping up ear tickling teachers. <br>  <br>  So there is nothing wrong with the "church". There are just a lot of people showing up places that are called churches and the man behind the pulpit has never been gifted or called by God to lead a congregation.|`|06Z3fh4laa	Same thing that's wrong with every day's church|`|eAMq1iBWaa	This:<br>  <br>  Rev 3:14 And unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write; These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God; <br>  <br>  <br>   Rev 3:15 I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot. <br>  <br>  <br>   Rev 3:16 So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth. <br>  <br>  <br>   Rev 3:17 Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked:|`|tx4bRDrXaa	I have been to most of the major religions,they change with the popularity of things.Instead of old fashioned Bible study.If you come out uneducated about the word of God it is time for you to change.<br>  (John 8:32) and YOU will know the truth, and the truth will set YOU free.”You might want to read Revelation the 18th chapter that is describing what religion would be like in the last days.<br>  Therefore Jesus, realizing they were about to come and seize him to make him king, withdrew again into the mountain all alone.” No politics for Jesus!—<br>  John 6:15                <a href="http://www.jw.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.jw.org/</a>|`|93r3nCM1aa	How long have we had this "American church" you speak of?|`|r8rykCkGaa	I know what you mean.  I can feel it and see it when I read about ministries and it even seems as though the ministries are competing to get people's money.  I get so much in the mail asking for money---now this is ministries in general, not churches really, but ministries just the same, and some people are so anxious to get money that they will put gimics in the mailings like a dollar bill (I just got two of those and one was a $2 bill).  They offer gifts for money and bigger better gifts for more money.  They write their letters with so much emotion it seems that they want you to empty out your bank account for them.  I realize some of these people, such as James Roberson, do weep for what they see in Africa and other parts of the world, but I get tired of getting so MANY letters asking!  One ministry I was trying to drop called on the phone and I didn't give them my number, and they sent two letters in two days begging for more even after I told them I'm on disability, and don't get paid for any job.  There are several others who send so many letters that sometimes I get two in one day.  It's ridiculous.  They are spending way too much on ads and mailings.<br>  <br>  But, for the churches that we attend locally, I can say this:  that 95% of them desperately need revival.  Although many are feeling hard times now financially, and with illnesses in the family, people are not feeling the desperate need to cry out to the Lord as they would in a restricted country where all the Christians are ready to sacrifice their lives for the sake of Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  I was just reading what Richard Wurmbrand said about the christians in Russia and in China, how there are none who are lukewarm, nominal or half-hearted.  Of course this was during the Communist take-over and now it's the Muslim/terrorist take-over in just as many countries as the Communists took over.  The situation is the same in that the Christians are dedicating their lives completely and there the churches are strong and in revival.|`|JXfGHsF6aa	"I counsel thee to buy of me [Jesus] gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see." Though the professed followers of Christ are in a deplorable condition, they are not yet in so desperate a strait as were the foolish virgins whose lamps were going out, and there was no time in which to replenish their vessels with oil. When the bridegroom came, those that were ready went in with him to the wedding; but when the foolish virgins came, the door was shut, and they were too late to obtain an entrance.<br>  <br>       But the counsel of the true Witness does not represent those who are lukewarm as in a hopeless case. There is yet a chance to remedy their state, and the Laodicean message is full of encouragement; for the backslidden church may yet buy the gold of faith and love, may yet have the white robe of the righteousness of Christ, that the shame of their nakedness need not appear. Purity of heart, purity of motive, may yet characterize those who are halfhearted and who are striving to serve God and mammon. They may yet wash their robes of character and make them white in the blood of the Lamb.|`|3KD6RRhPaa	The church today is no longer a church of God, but a business with some form of theology.

He provoked religious men in the first century to try to corrupt Christian congregations. The Bible says of those men: “Such men are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into apostles of Christ. And no wonder, for Satan himself keeps transforming himself into an angel of light. It is therefore nothing great if his ministers also keep transforming themselves into ministers of righteousness.”—2?Corinthians 11:13-15.<br>  Satan still uses religion that makes a pretense of being Christian, moral, and enlightening in order to make people live by his standards rather than God’s. (Luke 4:5-7) You have probably noticed that many clergymen today use religion to elevate themselves with high-sounding titles and to obtain money from their flocks. Governments have also used religion to persuade citizens to sacrifice themselves in war.<br>  The Devil employs religion more extensively than most realize. You might imagine that only a few religious extremists are serving Satan’s interests. But according to the Bible, “the one called Devil and Satan .?.?. is misleading the entire inhabited earth.” The Bible also says: “The whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one.” (Revelation 12:9; 1?John 5:19) How does God feel about religion that is used by leaders who just want to draw people after themselves?<br>  <br>  If you are shocked at the conduct of some churches of Christendom, know that Almighty God is greatly displeased with them. Christendom claims to have made a pact with God; ancient Israel made a similar claim. Both have proved unfaithful. God’s denunciation of Israel therefore applies with equal force to Christendom today. Jehovah said: “They have not listened to my words and have rejected my law. What do I care about incense from Sheba? .?.?. Your sacrifices do not please me.” (Jeremiah 6:19, 20, New International Version) God did not recognize acts of worship performed by hypocrites. He was not interested in their rituals and prayers. He told Israel: “Your festal seasons my soul has hated. To me they have become a burden; I have become tired of bearing them. And when you spread out your palms, I hide my eyes from you. Even though you make many prayers, I am not listening.”—Isaiah 1:14,?15.<br>  <br>  I've noticed that Jehovah's Witnesses seem to be the only religion whose ministers are not paid for their services, and all donations go towards the kingdom preaching work. They steer clear of politics as did Jesus, and they seem to be the only ones who follow Christ's example by going out and teaching people about the Bible. Say what you want, but it sounds like true religion to me. Matt 28:19,20; Isaiah 43:10,11; John 15:17-19|`|c3kOVB8faa	Seems to me that you need to keep looking for a Spirit filled Church.<br>  Or start a church in your home since you are unable to find one that meets your requirements.<br>  Churches started in the homes first and that's where they will wind up with the way it's going out in the Good Ole' U.S.A.<br>  We need more Spirit filled Believers out there encouraging one another as we are commanded to by Paul.

You prefer a certain amount of change and variety and become dissatisfied when hemmed in by restrictions and limitations. You also pride yourself as an independent thinker; and do not accept others' statements without satisfactory proof. But you have found it unwise to be too frank in revealing yourself to others.

GGmaSpHDaa	Keep in mind when you read BeDuhn's report:<br>  <br>  Jason David BeDuhn Phd is a religious studies person, not a linguist.  Mr. BeDuhn knows about how religions compare, he is not a specialist in Greek and Hebrew, the languages the Bible was originally written in.    How do we know this?<br>  <br>  Mr. BeDuhn’s  CV (Curriculum Vitae is detail list of one’s life work) does not indicate training and years of work in translation and linguistics . There are no technical papers, translation work, etc., that show acceptance of his work by other linguist experts.  But instead, the CV shows his experience is in religious history and comparison. <a href="http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/~jdb8/jason-cv1.htm" rel="nofollow">http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/~jdb8/jason-cv1.h...</a><br>  <br>  BeDuhn’s CV indicates knowledge of several languages including Greek, but does not specify any formal training.  Lots of people have some knowledge of the Greek language.  However, one must be an expert in Greek to argue that All Bible translations are biased and inferior to the NWT.   Dr. BeDuhn does not qualify as an expert in translation of the Bible.<br>  <br>  BeDuhn therefore lacks the necessary expertise to comment authoritatively about Bible translations. His book on translation is not in his area of expertise. Given this situation, there is good reason to be cautious about his claims.<br>  <br>  Edited.|`|eAMq1iBWaa	<a href="http://www.theocraticlibrary.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.theocraticlibrary.com/</a>

Es h?ngt vor allem von der Art des Textes ab und was man ?vergleichen“ will. Wenn Du die Leerzeichen eines deutschen und eines englischen Textes gleicher Gesamtl?nge z?hlst, wirst du normalerweise im englischen Text mehr Leerzeichen finden und kannst somit die durchschnittliche Wortl?nge und den Unterschied ausrechnen.<br>  <br>  Wenn Du aber eine Wort-für-Wort-übersetzung ohne sprachliche Anpassung ?erzwingst“, schwinden die Unterschiede. Manchmal ist das deutsche Wort l?nger, manchmal das englische und im Endeffekt gleicht sich dies in etwa aus. Bei einer ?anst?ndigen“ übersetzung mu?t Du berücksichtigen, da? es im Englischen keine (beliebig) zusammengesetzten W?rter wie im Deutschen gibt und einem langen deutschen Wort mitunter mehrere (kürzere) englische W?rter gegenüberstehen um das Gleiche auszudrücken.<br>  <br>  Bei ?freien“ übersetzungen kommt es wieder sehr auf die Textart an.

HOWEVER, if Smith itself has been reversed (which I would prefer, being against the war on drugs), then to deny people the opportunity to medical benefits from cannabis fails the compelling interest test that such a law would have to meet upon a Smith reversal.|`|AA10027931	The last I checked faith in God is not illegal. <br>  Want healing?

It  might be a word we see in book or on a sign. Or something we hear someone say in a conversation that answers our question.

And i dont know if its possible, intersting question.|`|uFpbAZ0kaa	That is a question that will get many different answers. Here is mine... <br>  <br>  The Spirit of G-d is recorded as having entered man and spoken to groups of people who each understood it in their native language. <br>  <br>  Acts 2: 1And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place. <br>  <br>   2And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting. <br>  <br>   3And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them. <br>  <br>   4And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance. <br>  <br>   5And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven. <br>  <br>   6Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because that every man heard them speak in his own language. <br>  <br>   7And they were all amazed and marvelled, saying one to another, Behold, are not all these which speak Galilaeans? <br>  <br>   8And how hear we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were born?<br>  <br>  As you can see, they were speaking but not conversing. It wasn't like each individual was having their own personal conversation. The spirit entered them and they spoke of holy things as the spirit guided them. <br>  <br>  Now a days, many Christians believe that the Holy Spirit will speak through them and they go on a long winded yabba dabba doo doo that can not be understood. I do not believe this to be true. <br>  <br>  When the spirit has something to say it will make sure it's understood because nothing can be more important than what the Spirit says. <br>  <br>  While the spirit can move you to make the right decisions by life guidence, I don't believe anybody has an actual conversation with the Spirit. I also believe that since scripture is written, there is no need to add to it and therefore nothing more to say. <br>  <br>  However please feel free to speak to the spirit when ever you would like. I know G-d would love to hear from you.

91a8e11ad451c7891d7ab5f0dab8a125aa	Until not too long ago, the King James Version was THE recognized and respected standard.  I have had a Southern Baptist preacher dismiss it in favour of the newer versions.  He told me that the bible is inerrant, but yet he dismisses some passages from the Bible, claiming that newer versions offer a disclaimer on some verses (such as the one where Jesus said that if your faith is the size of a grain of mustard, or where any two shall pray and it shall be done.)  Really, what the preacher was saying was, "don't count on God to answer prayers -- regardless of the size of faith or other conditions."<br>  <br>  Very interesting ...

0vhsMxIwaa	I am from Romania, moved to North America in 93. Just because there isn't a Taco Bell or a shopping mall at every single freakin corner, doesn't make a country less worthy. I lived in Toronto, Canada; New York, New York; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvana; and Orlando, Florida. When I go to Romania I NEVER WANT TO COME BACK. They have the most beautiful girls I have ever seen (and I traveled to all of Europe). Romania is not poor. It is rich in culture, activity, history, entertainment and life. When I go there, I feel free at last! My parents lived in Romania, and they were'nt farmers (to the idiot that thinks everyone there is a farmer). My mom was a doctor, and my dad owned his own computer business (and that's before 93). All of our friends back home now have houses bigger than ours (and our house cost $900,000). They all drive mercedes, BMW, etc. Romania is the most romantic country I have ever been to. If you want to live the big city life, there are big cities. There you will find all the glamour and glitz Americans blindly search for (to find happiness). Outside of the large cities you will find a city like the one I lived in (Zalau). It is beautiful in every way. The night life is AMAZING. Take any girl from the club there, and compare her with a girl here... and there is no comparison. So why did we leave?? Because of corruption. My dad would have to pay off political officials just so he can run his business (much like the mafia). There is constant political turmoil due to this. My parents wanted to raise me in a world where they don't have to worry about those types of things. I know, personally, that when I have enough money to retire, I will move back to Romania. The only reason Americans don't hear anything positive about Romania, is because American news doesn't provide any postive information. I bet no one in America knew that the Jet Engine was invented by A ROMANIAN. In a country full of whales, I bet nobody knew that the person who invented INSULIN for diabetes was ROMANIAN. I'm glad you are curious about Romania, but I hate it when people who probably never left their own state talk down on my culture.|`|39d43401a740c2f2450138d052c9ce27aa	There are of course lots of dark spots ( mainly when it comes to politics) but overall Romania is a rapidly evolving European country: is has a fast growing economy, incomes are also growing, unemployment is very low,  there are numerous  infrastructure projects ( motorways, speed railways, key bridges ) in progress , tourism is steadily growing...so hopefully in a few years it will be (almost :) like any normal country.<br>  <br>  Romania is undoubtedly one of the poorest countries in the European Union ( which btw isn't the same thing as Europe) but still it has a reasonably high standard of life.

The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the Body of Christ?<br>  1 Corinthians 10:16<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  As Christians we are saved (i.e. prepared for heaven) through faith by grace - the free gift of God's life earned by Jesus Christ on the wood of the Cross (Eph 2:8-10; Acts 15:11). In faith we receive this saving grace through the Sacraments - outward, sensible signs instituted by Christ through which inward grace is given to our souls. For example during Baptism (Matt 28:19), we are outwardly washed with water but inwardly receive sanctifying grace which reconciles us with God (1 Cor 6:11; 1 Pet 3:21; Acts 2:38). According to the Catholic Church, there are seven Sacraments: Baptism (Mark 16:16), Reconciliation (John 20:21-23), Confirmation (Acts 8:14-17), the Eucharist (1 Cor 10:16), Holy Matrimony (Eph 5:22-32), Holy Orders (Acts 6:5-6) and the Anointing of the Sick (Mark 6:13; James 5:14-15). In this tract we will focus on only one Sacrament - the Eucharist - with special attention placed on the Real Presence of Christ in the Eucharist.<br>  <br>  The Eucharist is a Sacrament since it was instituted by Christ in the Gospels (Matt 26; Mark 14; Luke 22; John 6). Its outward signs are the wheat bread and grape wine over which the words of consecration - "This is My Body, this is My Blood" - are said by the priest as the representative of Christ. The inward grace is Christ Himself, the Author of all grace - "He who eats My Flesh and drinks My Blood abides in Me, and I in him." [John 6:56] The Catholic Church teaches that the Eucharist, even though it still appears as bread and wine after consecration, is truly the Real Presence of Christ - His Body, Blood, Soul and Divinity. (Council of Trent, 13th Session)<br>  <br>  Before going into the Gospels, let us consider a few Old Testament prefigurements or types of the Eucharist. The first foreshadowing is the bread and wine offered by the priest, Melchizedek, in Genesis 14:18ff. Melchizedek brought bread and wine, not to have lunch with Abram, but to sacrifice them up to God for Abram. Afterward Abram gave him a tithe (Gn 14:20). In Hebrews 5:10, St. Paul wrote that God designated Christ as high priest after the order of Melchizedek. A second type is the Manna - bread from heaven - which fed the Israelites during their Exodus (Ex 16:14-15). Jesus in John 6:31-33 compares Himself to this Manna. A third type is the paschal lamb. The paschal lamb was to be sacrificed to God; its flesh had to be eaten whole (Ex 12:8) and this custom was to be practiced for all generations. In the New Testament, Christ is called "Our Paschal Lamb" [1 Cor 5:7]. In Rev. 5:6, Jesus is referred to as "a Lamb standing, as though it had been slain." For Catholics these types are fulfilled in the Eucharist.<br>  <br>  A powerful Gospel text for the Real Presence of Christ in the Eucharist is John 6:31-71. In this passage, Jesus said "I am the living bread which came down from heaven" [John 6:51]. Jesus further said:<br>  <br>  "Truly, truly, I say to you ... he who eats My Flesh and drinks My Blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day." [John 6:53-54]<br>  <br>  In verses 52-59, Jesus repeated this teaching four different ways, while His audience became angry. Many of His disciples complained: "This is a hard saying; who can listen to it?" [John 6:60] and left Him (John 6:66). Even with the angry crowd and His disciples leaving Him, Jesus did not change His teaching nor say that He was merely speaking figuratively or in parables. His response to the Apostles was: "Will you also go away?" [John 6:67] St. Peter answered: "Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life; and we have believed, and have come to know that you are the Holy One of God." [John 6:68-69]<br>  <br>  Some Christians claim that Jesus in chapter 6 of John's Gospel was speaking figuratively since He commonly spoke in parables while preaching to the crowds. However, this does not appear to be the case here; His audience took Him literally and became angry. No where in the Gospels do the crowds become angry when Christ taught in parables. After John 6:60, Jesus was no longer speaking to the crowds but speaking privately with His disciples (Mark 4:34). Still, they understood Him as before and many left Him. This reaction would be quite inappropriate if Christ were merely speaking in parables.<br>  <br>  Christ instituted the Eucharist during the Last Supper (Matt 26:26-29; Mark 14:22-25; Luke 22:14-20). St. Paul in his Letter to the Corinthians also wrote about the Last Supper:<br>  <br>  ...that the Lord Jesus on the night when He was betrayed took bread, and when He had given thanks, He broke it, and said, "This is My Body which is for you. Do this in remembrance of Me." [1 Cor 11:23-24; also see 1 Cor 10:16 on front panel]<br>  <br>  Notice that in all four versions of the Last Supper, Jesus said: "This is My Body" and not "This represents (or symbolizes) My Body." A few verses later, St. Paul also added:<br>  <br>  Whoever, therefore, eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of profaning the Body and Blood of the Lord. Let a man examine himself, and so eat of the bread and drink of the cup. For any one who eats and drinks without discerning the body eats and drinks judgement upon himself. That is why many of you are weak and ill, and some have died. [1 Cor 11:27-30]<br>  <br>  These words would be too strong, if the Eucharist were merely a symbol of Christ or merely a meal of ordinary bread and wine. People do not profane the Body of Christ by eating ordinary bread or wine.<br>  <br>  The early Christians also had a Catholic understanding of the Eucharist. In The Didache - a 1st century catechism - the Apostles wrote:<br>  <br>  Assemble on the Lord's Day, and break bread and offer the Eucharist; but first make confession of your faults, so that your sacrifice may be a pure one. [The Didache 14:1; Early Christian Writings, (Penguin Classics, 1987) p. 197]<br>  <br>  This is the same advice as given by St. Paul. Confessing ones sins in preparation would not be necessary, if the Eucharist were not a sacrifice or merely a symbol of Christ. In a letter written 110 A.D., St. Ignatius of Antioch warned the Smyrnaeans about the Docetes - gnostic heretics:<br>  <br>  They (the Docetes) have no care for love, no thought for the widow and orphan, none at all for the afflicted, the captive, the hungry, or the thirsty. They even absent themselves from the Eucharist and public prayers, because they will not admit that the Eucharist is the self-same Body of our Saviour Jesus Christ which suffered for our sins... [Epistle to the Smyrnaeans 6-7; Ibid., p. 102]<br>  <br>  St. John Chrysostom in the 4th century during a sermon said this about the Eucharist:<br>  <br>  How many of you say: "I should like to see His face, His garments, His sandals." You do see Him, you touch Him, you eat Him. He gives Himself to you, not only that you may see Him, but also to be your food and nourishment. [Quote from: John Laux, Mass and the Sacraments, (TAN, 1990) p. 43]<br>  <br>  St. Justin Martyr in the 2nd century, while St. Ambrose and St. Augustine in the 4th century among many others bore witness to the Real Presence of Christ in the Eucharist.<br>  <br>  The Eucharist, also known as the Blessed Sacrament, is the Body, Blood, Soul and Divinity of Jesus Christ. When we receive or adore the Eucharist during Mass or during Holy Hour, we are actually receiving and adoring Jesus Christ Himself. Jesus promised to be with us to the end of time (Matt 28:20), and His promise is especially fulfilled in the Eucharist. May the Lord help us to better realize His truly awesome gift to us.|`|AA12367014	You waited a little late to plan this out!|`|DSbbT4QHaa	Here is an answer the Holy Spirit gave me to this Y/A question and you can teach ur youth group about it.  The answer is directed towards the asker.  They can use it as a witness tool for their Jewish friends.  Here is the question:<br>  <br>  Christians, with one hand you elevate the Hebrews towards heaven as 'Gods chosen People'. With your other<br>  you slap them away from heaven because they will not accept 'Christ as their Messiah'. You reconcile this how? <br>  <br>  <br>  This is the answer.<br>  <br>   You are his chosen people...the bible says so. The bible says The Jews will be blessed like the sands of the sea which they are. My feeling on this is that if Jews were to accept Christ as the Messiah, then they feel they would have to take partial responsibility for putting him on the cross and think they lose their Jewish heritage....but in contrary it was God's plan, and Jesus died to save all from our sins. Jesus also went thru 7 prs of hands before he got to the cross the 2nd last being Pontius Pilate a Jew...the last being the Jewish people in the crowd. Look at these scriptures and you will see the Jews cursed themselves with their words....Matt 27:27.<br>  <br>  Mat 27:22 “What shall I do, then, with Jesus who is called Christ?” Pilate asked.<br>  <br>  They all answered, “Crucify him!”<br>  <br>  Mat 27:23 “Why? What crime has he committed?” asked Pilate.<br>  <br>  But they shouted all the louder, “Crucify him!”<br>  <br>  Mat 27:24 When Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere, but that instead an uproar was starting, he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd. “I am innocent of this man's blood,” he said. “It is your responsibility!”<br>  <br>  Mat 27:25 All the people answered, “Let his blood be on us and on our children!”<br>  <br>  You see the curse....Let his blood be on us and on our children. <br>  <br>  This explains the persecution of the Jews over the years, including the holocaust etc. Even though the Jews are his chosen people, blessed financially with intelligence...they put the curse on themselves. Why do u think the war between the Middle East and Israel is going on now. The bible says the Jews will get a double portion of tribulation..but they will be doubly blessed. If you are open to it and Jewish and want to break that curse for you and your family...e-mail me and I can take u through the steps. Obviously I am not going to be able to stop the war....but you will recieve protection from the Lord which is Psalm 91.<br>  <br>  In Matthew 27:22...when the crowd was shouting Crucify him..he asked what crime has he committed. but they shouted all the louder, Crucify him! The bible says if you curse the Jews you will be cursed, and if u bless the Jews you will be blessed. If I am an enemy of the Jews I would not speak the truth to them. In John 14:6 Jesus says I am the way, the truth and the life, no one comes to the father but by me....you have freewill..and no one is slapping you out of heaven...you are the only one who is slapping yourself out of heaven by not choosing him. We make our own bed then lie in it. I can't choose him for you. <br>  <br>  I pray for God's perfect will in your life and a revelation of who Jesus is. In Jesus name I pray, Amen. <br>  <br>  If you don't receive him after hearing this message..then it's not your time, I will move on to the next person who will, as we are so close to the end and the time is short.<br>  <br>  God bless You,<br>  <br>  Daniel<br>  ><><br>  <br>   Hopefully this helps...I just learned this today from the Holy Spirit.|`|bRIm5TJdaa	Tomorrow???

But that is not true and is not in the Bible and they believe in the "new" revelation of what they call the book of Mormon.  They try to say there is no difference to real Christians, but that is simply not true.  And as far as Jehovah witness they do the same thing with the "Watch Tower" magazines and group.  As though there is new revelation and thus creates their own Jesus and not the Jesus of the bible.

He said: “The hour is coming, and it is now, when the true worshipers will worship the Father with spirit and truth, for, indeed, the Father is looking for suchlike ones to worship him. God is a Spirit, and those worshiping him must worship with spirit and truth.” (John 4:23,?24) To worship God “with spirit,” we must have his spirit and be guided by that spirit. It is possible to worship God ‘with truth’ by studying his Word, the Bible, and by worshiping him according to his revealed truth. Are you eager to do that? Jesus emphasized that God wants true worship. This shows that there are forms of worship unacceptable to Jehovah. To worship God means to give him reverent honor and to render sacred service to him. If you wanted to show honor to a powerful ruler, likely you would be eager to serve him and do what would please him. Surely, then, we want to please God. Rather than merely say, ‘My religion suits me,’ we therefore need to make sure that our worship meets God’s requirements.<br>  DOING THE WILL OF THE FATHER<br>  Let us read Matthew 7:21-23 and see if we can isolate a crucial factor that determines whether all worship is acceptable to God. Jesus said: “Not everyone saying to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but the one doing the will of my Father who is in the heavens will. Many will say to me in that day, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and expel demons [wicked spirit creatures] in your name, and perform many powerful works in your name?’ And yet then I will confess to them: I never knew you! Get away from me, you workers of lawlessness.” Acknowledging Jesus Christ as Lord is essential in true worship. But something would be missing in the worship of many of those claiming to be Jesus’ disciples. He said that some would perform “powerful works,” such as supposed miraculous healings. However, they would fail to do what Jesus said is vital. They would not be “doing the will of [his] Father.” If we want to please God, we must learn what the will of the Father is and then do it.<br>  ACCURATE KNOWLEDGE—A PROTECTION<br>  Doing God’s will requires an accurate knowledge of both Jehovah God and Jesus Christ. Such knowledge leads to everlasting life. Surely, then, all of us will want to take seriously the matter of gaining accurate knowledge from God’s Word, the Bible. Some say that there is no need for concern as long as we are sincere and zealous in our worship. Others claim, ‘The less you know, the less is expected of you.’ Yet, the Bible encourages us to increase in the knowledge of God and his purposes.—Ephesians 4:13; Philippians 1:9; Colossians 1:9. Such knowledge is a protection against contamination of our worship. The apostle Paul spoke of a certain spirit creature who pretends to be “an angel of light.” (2?Corinthians 11:14) Thus disguised, this spirit creature—Satan—tries to mislead us into doing things contrary to God’s will. Other spirit creatures associated with Satan have also been polluting people’s worship, for Paul said: “The things which the nations sacrifice they sacrifice to demons, and not to God.” (1?Corinthians 10:20) Likely, many have thought they were worshiping in the right way, although they were not doing what God wanted. They were being misled into unclean false worship. We will learn more about Satan and the demons later, but these enemies of God have definitely been polluting mankind’s worship.<br>  If you knew that someone had deliberately poisoned your water supply, would you go on drinking from it? Surely, you would take immediate action to find a source of safe, pure water. Well, an accurate knowledge of God’s Word equips us to identify true religion and to reject impurities that make worship unacceptable to God.|`|WzGBX3tvaa	everyone has different beliefs that they practice they way "they see fit"<br>  not everyone believes in the same god as you|`|7aa811d41efd8b148b1813352fd326f3aa	hmmmmm, can't figure out what you're getting at here......i'm missing something......i think it's great people can worship god how they see fit.|`|AA11966419	Ya get some perks after you been doing it a while.|`|dGRBtBVoaa	I do not understand?<br>  <br>  All through the bible people worshiped god in many, many differeny ways, through music, poetry, dance, and prayer.

It's a big planet, and there's room for plenty of different opinions.

Gross.|`|QP8LdPLeaa	"Do you white people allow your children to do this?"<br>  <br>  okay that line really didn't sound too lovely. instead of looking at their race, just look at them as individuals. just because they were white doesn't mean that was the reason the 16 year old did it. |`|89c7e5af6668337660a2665976affbf3aa	Wow...racist much?<br>  <br>  That had nothing to do with being white, that particular family just has bad table manners.|`|AA11355939	Why are you making this into a racial thing?  This is a parenting issue.<br>  Lousy parents are not restricted to one particular nor is any race excluded from the group.  <br>  <br>  My guess is that the 16 year old is in a state of rebellion and the younger sibling is mimicking his brother.  Was their mother in the room?  Did she see this misbehavior?  If yes, then I would certainly pray for her as she has a rough row to hoe.  Teens can be especially difficult.  <br>  <br>  I am 'white' and none of my children behaved in this manner.  Way before they turned 2 they knew better.  I would like to say my grand daughters knew better; but, I will tell you a funny story:  My in laws had a 50th wedding anniversary reception and there was a bowl of black olives on the table.  The girls had never encountered a full bowl of black olives before, we had always put 2-3 on their plates and handed the plate to them.  So, this seemed like an opportunity from heaven.  There was so much going on and so many people milling around.  Apparently my sister in law did see what was happening because the first I knew of it was later when we watched the tape!  Here were the girls, ages 2 and 4, with black olives on all ten fingers!!<br>  Was it something their mom or my husband or I would have allowed?  Absolutely not!<br>  <br>  The point is children, especially teens, do not always do as they have been taught.  This holds true for all races.  Look at how many black teens get into trouble in school and with the law.  So do whites, I am just pointing out that you need to look past skin color.<br>  <br>  Have a great day!|`|CfjxKLHDaa	It is not a race or a cultural thing.  It is the lack of responsibility of the parents in teaching their children proper etiquette.  If they do not know, they can go to the library and take out a book on proper manners.  I’m sorry but parenthood is expensive socially as well as financially.<br>  <br>  There are white and black children around the country that are not taught manners by their parents.  They do exist.<br>  |`|df7d9c71d0e64ebc9642d34cd776c726aa	Multiple choice, choose all that apply:<br>  <br>  <br>  A)  Apparently, this is the limit of your exposure to whitey, and so you make a rash judgment.  I suggest you get out more.<br>  <br>  B)  Maybe they thought they were making you feel more at home.<br>  <br>  C)  Perhaps you haven't met enough black children.|`|V7iRigVJaa	Racist much? Eating food has nothing to do with what color is your skin. It is the person not the skin color maybe the kids are just spoiled it has nothing to do with their color. When are people gonna get past these racist issues?!|`|DmD1ypYGaa	i agree with the second comment i think your being racist and we really don't need that in this world it has nothing to do with their race the kids were just not raised with good table manners,thanks you|`|00xXcu3oaa	What do you mean, "you white people?" Oh wait, you're refering to white people. Um... I would have to say no.|`|XnogyuCKaa	nah its not they are gross spoiled lil boys <br>  here is a question for you though if i iplied that only black children wererude would you think i was an closed minded person|`|78KEwtUXaa	No it's not a white thing. It's a whitetrash thing.|`|oXKLf3hMaa	of course not, that's ridiculous. those kids are really spoiled.|`|g2RtuU3caa	No, my parents never would have been okay with me doing something like that.  I don't think that's something decided on race, it's something decided on class.  It doesn't matter what color your skin is, if you weren't taught manners you'll do rude things like that.|`|MwyuNuIMaa	Not at all. Black or white it is just basic manners. How rude to start dipping your fingers into other peoples dinner.|`|8808930e4fc5d09c1db60737737a7332aa	there is a little cultural aspect to it though-- when it comes to manners-- certain cultures expect you to burp,,, others feel you have not been served enough food if you do not leave a bit on the plate,,, we american's used to be expected to clean the plate of food (i am not sure if this still is the case)-- chinese families pull from a common dish often-- but only within close family would they "double dip the chip"-- indeed, this seems to be the individual family as opposed to white people in general<br>  <br>  so many cultures so many different ways-- isn't it wonderful to think about|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	That's absurd, not only bad manners but very unhygienic. Shame on them.|`|bO2rzfISaa	Are these people Americans? Because this is a normal way to eat in some parts of the Middle East and some parts of Africa.<br>  <br>  It's interesting that they generously shared a meal with you and you used the opportunity to criticize them. The poor manners lie with you.
AA12006309	At this point it's anyone's guess, but my guess is Obama sneaks out a lead, though not without the Republican party pulling sneaky tricks again like the last two times.|`|91acf4dec3b907fa1dddca164a816d32aa	Presidential Elections in the United States are actually 51 different elections within the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Many states usually vote a certain way, with California and New York voting for the Democratic candidate and Texas voting for the Republican candidate. The states that can go either way are called "swing states" and are the states that truly determine who the next President will be. The Presidential candidate that gets the most votes in the swing states of Florida, Ohio, and Missouri will determine who the next President will be. Current polls indicate that Obama will win these states and be the next President.|`|t2Jnzfe7aa	Obama is in the lead but I think it's too early to call Obama the winner. (I hope Obama does win though)|`|AA11235749	May be Obama because of his vision but I am not from USA.|`|1Qt0rDitaa	It looks like Obama will win. Even if McCain won every remaining battleground state, we still won't have enough electoral votes or w/e to win, so basically he has to win every battleground state (most of which Obama has a slight lead in), he has to win Pennsylvania (Obama has an 11 point lead there), and he has to win some other Obama-favored state. Basically he can't win as things are now.|`|WcAYDuywaa	I think it will be Obama.  After the George Bush administration I think many Americans have associated a lot of stigma with the Republican party.  I just don't think we're ready for another Republican president at the moment.|`|b9veJswiaa	I really really want it to be Obama<br>  ...but I'm scared it will be McCain.  <br>  I could though, be reacting to the fact that my family is full of republicans and I'm in a town where the lawns are littered with McCain signs.|`|8XSfMPDwaa	Obama is ahead in the polls.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/maps/obama_vs_mccain/" rel="nofollow">http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/...</a>|`|fLMCOSWdaa	I think McCain would be a catastrophe, but as H.L. Mencken said,'No one has ever lost money from underestimating the intelligence of the American people.'|`|ARwp1IYaaa	If it isn't Obama, then that would say something really bad about the American population...|`|hacd7Yz6aa	obama 08!|`|d6e7ddf8a43ce14679ba91ffde757a43aa	I would just look at the bookmakers odds for an honest opinion|`|HH90Eghaaa	I think its still too early to tell, I know there are a lot of flip flopper's out there when it comes down to actually marking the ballot! Also some major supporters don't even show up to vote on voting day! I'll see the results when there official until then just get out there and vote, don't relay on the polls! You never know what could happen!|`|a457e9a42af7d95c857ddbcfefd4f337aa	I hope to high heavens that Obama is ahead.  I think he will win, but I don't want to get my hopes up.  
AA11235749	I do not think so. It's obssessive generalization for the men.|`|SWYB8iQEaa	no, any man who respects himself respects also the woman he loves<br>  this goes for gay people too.<br>  it's how one respects himself to begin with|`|tGIbpPzuaa	It's a myth, like all broad generalisations are.|`|OORkjFIGaa	No.|`|x1yZZQEUaa	well.....each man has his own way of respect so idk|`|dJs8GN3Qaa	I don't think it's true.  It mostly depends on the guy though.  Most of the guys I know are nice, polite, and friendly.  But, there are still those who are rude.|`|67204bd052a33365d7bd0f82da0dcc95aa	Why is this question from a straight man in this section? Go to GWS...and ask about repsecting women again..most men on there only respect women of whom they approve, so in general, no!|`|vDG0iA8laa	I don't know about "most" men, but there are a lot of "low lives" out there that's for sure..<br>  These so-called macho male individuals who beat up on / hit women. should be put out of their misery. Oh sure, a lot of them "cop the plea" "Well I was drunk and I'm sorry".. What a "crock"...!!!<br>  Some are very brave when it comes to taking their short-comings out on the female gender and it's no wonder some of these "battered" women eventually get pushed "over the cliff" wherein they retaliate  in a way that brings criminal  charges against THEM..!!<br>  It doesn't take much effort for these imbecile males  to WALK away<br>  from ANY confrontation  - it saves a lot of grief and potential big time harm to someone.<br>  Rachelle in High Heels<br>  <br>  |`|fB0gmEioaa	Is it true that MOST men don't respect women?<br>  <br>  Most men? Men who beat women or show disrespect for women are the exception not the rule. However to get respect one has to show respect especially for themselves or they are not going to get it. |`|2a31fdee1fddb6a3055ca7fae75fc902aa	No, there's some good guys out there..  but men who rape and beat women are the lowest piece of crap to me. |`|a8qvLezVaa	use your common sense and your better judgment!
4db07412ef2c09f8393cb86bf7e153deaa	Yeah, I'm sure the fundamentalists will find some way around it, just like how they're trying to rationalize the "round earth" fact.  It just might take them a couple of centuries.<br>  <br>  Fortunately, the Christians who AREN'T biblical fundamentalists won't really have that problem in the first place.|`|AA10038311	You see, Christian doubts case pretty damn big shadows, so it seems to be rather irrelevant.<br>  <br>  We've displayed species evolving into several, completely new species many times, in fact, bacteria do this on a yearly basis....  This is macro evolution, and it can be readily observed...  I don't see why there is a shadow of a doubt left in anybody's minds right now.|`|J01CJembaa	The true debate of macro vs micro evolution is whether evolution happens in quick spurts or slow changes. Creationists have changed it to make it sound like it is something else.<br>  <br>  The macro the creationists talk about already is proven beyond any reasonable doubt.|`|b0IYXTcBaa	Since it will not be proven beyond any doubt it is not a real question. However if by some scientific miracle occurs then I will believe in evolution. However it won't happen so I am not too concerned.|`|c6ed324bb70246f047e05d3ca9d5e4fdaa	Guess what? It's already been proven without a doubt.|`|1dot8tXvaa	IF is the key word.  IF any type of evolution is proven beyond any doubt (which has not been done yet)...this Christian boy will believe.|`|2c102fa22d7ee2161edd5358fd6c4bbeaa	Not ever going to happen so your point is mute.|`|7wiGnKe9aa	I starred it and fell in love.|`|Brto7Eyjaa	I thought I may have already seen a verse that implied something to that effect...but, undoubtedly, they will say "Oh...genesis, that was metaphorical...but this highly obscure, meaningless passage is also metaphorical and it means 'evolution'".|`|ZvnAWklbaa	Just believe on,because you will be sad,because never will they prove evolution,they can not when God is the one who created everything.|`|b084QRYMaa	Dude, they don't change their minds. That's why they're called Fundamentalists. the only reason they believe in a round world is because somebody told when them when they were very small.|`|m0X7fJJUaa	It already is.  Some Christians like to put their head in the sand.<br>  <br>  Probably, Christians will say that God created life THEN it evolved!|`|yYGdOdG4aa	I'm surprised they aren't doing it already!  <br>  <br>  Isn't "apologist" just another word for "liar"?|`|m5Sj8EUXaa	I'm sure it has been/will be done, though as far as i know, the Bible says nothing that either supports of refutes evolution--or the heliocentric model of the solar system, for that matter. Personally, I don't mix science and religion. Anyone who says they can completely explain the nature of the universe--by either science or theology--is a fool.|`|35388c245298f734c446f07410c4ec69aa	It already has been proven, certainly beyond any reasonable doubt.  And it doesn't seem like they've found a Biblical reference.  Although I think I do remember seeing someone claim that 'dust' means single-celled life forms.
2huxaqdKaa	I know. I guess it's the pros and cons of the internet. It gives instant access to the world but it doesn't exclude it from anyone. And I could see asking questions on here in general that you don't want to ask other people because you're afraid of being called a racist or of being embarrassed but some people are just like:<br>  <br>  I'm not a racist but why do all black people get food stamps?<br>  <br>  And stuff like that. If you truly want enlightenment then this is the place to come but too often people just want to ignorant and hateful, seeking no actual answer.|`|JsdLYqokaa	I disagree with everything that Barrack Obama stands for. It has nothing to do with the color of his skin. Some people are using the color of Obama's skin to say "if you don't like Obama, you are racist" that is complete B.S. |`|QgzTdZ2uaa	They sure arent hiding behind a computer screen like these pinheads, most of those kinds of racists are doing twenty to life with their nazi tatts, or theyre dead. LOL.|`|1RTwcBXraa	So you are saying if someone that isn't black has grievances with other blacks they best not say anything to their face because of why?? Are you insinuating that violence will occur? And you wonder where people get their ideas that some races seem to resort to violence. ha!<br>  Then you state it again how the racists would "pay". There are many ways to solve issues besides violence. However, it takes intelligence to figure those out.|`|130b3ddc6e14a784399c30499c03e6cbaa	Firstly I've nothing against Obama. I'm not even American so the issue isn't that big to me.<br>  <br>  My answer to your theory is: would you prefer it if people "spewed" in real life or would you prefer it if people kept it online? Remember the internet is not real life. I think these days people need an outlet to vent whatever frustrations they can't let out in real life, for whatever repercussions that may come. The fact that it is anonymous becomes is incidental. The main reason, I think, is that the internet is available to almost everyone and everyone's voice on the internet is equal. Its really quite democratic. <br>  <br>  Also the fact that you are pointing out here, that if a racist said something rude about blacks to a black person, and in doing so they would get hit and beaten up makes me think that the racist might have a point - a civilized person does not assault someone just because someone insulted them.
faceb0da83e7b433b86d3ae6836703f3aa	Why include Tammy Faye, when Jim Bakker was the one found guilty in the court of law?<br>  <br>  Tammy is a born again Christian & is in heaven with the Lord.  And she suffered a lot of false accusations.  I think Christians as a whole really let her down.  And really Jim Bakker is the guilty one who also committed adulteries.|`|wRBfUgI2aa	Yes.  I was in Charlotte at the time.  Every 5 minutes begging for money.  Selling condos in heaven.  What landed Jim in jail was overselling time shares in the hotels they owned 10x over.  They pocketed all the money with their friends and used it to buy $10,000.00 air-conditioned dog houses and solid gold fixtures for their mansions.<br>  <br>  I can assure you, God never spoke a single word to them.|`|13143ba00cdf7ee11b6a78bb953b2bf9aa	Neither.<br>  They didn't "con" anybody. They just asked for the money, and people gave it to them.|`|SPSUtVQjaa	God gave us free will. He doesn't  make us do anything, but he will forgive anything.|`|VHCluFrZaa	I will never believe God commissioned Jim Bakker and Tammy Faye to do what they did, and, yes they con many of people, my children and  I were among many who got con in their selfish schemes, it really hurts and anger me when people con and hurt so many people in the name of "GOD", but, in today's society it is so acceptable by many who believe themselves to be christians, how can u honestly say you are a christian when it inflicts pain,guilt, and judgement on others in order to manipulate them in getting what u want from them, this is not an attribute from the "Divine Creator who created me".|`|yaXSDUBjaa	God doesn't need money.

AA11875616	Not at all!  We all must fight racism and bigotry when we see it or hear it.  Only by doing that, will we succeed in driving it back into the past where it belongs.|`|8e4506c476b48324af970127ad5cd76faa	Whether he was joking or not, he is obviously somewhat racist towards Asians.  That kind of joke would be OK coming from another Asian, or in a context where it doesn't offend you.

qTlASTnzaa	when your system of beliefs is as fragile as a christians, you can ill afford any further negative lighting.|`|AA10052130	I'm not a fan of Narnia films -- I don't find them particularly Christian in theme.  However, the fact that a story is fiction or not has nothing to do with why Golden Compass is boycotted.  And it's not a story's fictional nature that usually gets associated with other stories.<br>  <br>  Young children don't understand that there is a difference between fiction and non-fiction, but they learn what is OK and not OK to do by what they see in stories.  Older kids will understand that difference, but will pick up on the anti-religious, anti-God theme.<br>  <br>  Pullman's agenda has been shown, not to just make an entertaining children's story, or even to put down organized religion, but "to defeat the oppressive forces of a senile God."  And, "Pullman left little doubt about his intentions when he said in a 2003 interview that 'My books are about killing God.' "<br>  <br>  So, it's not just that it is fictional, or anti-religion, or even that it is anti-God, but because he wants to evangelize his perverted, Atheist 'gospel' to our children.  It is the INTENT of the story that matters most.|`|MMKDqIGdaa	I have not seen it, and am cautious of "knee jerk" reactions to cautions put out from various sources.  My research regarding this movie would indicate that it is one to be avoided.<br>  <br>  Movie "The Golden Compass"<br>  St Pauls Hebron<br>  Dec 6, 2007<br>  <br>  <br>  Be alert!  A new movie, The Golden Compass, is set to be released on Dec. 7, 2007 throughout the US and translated into 32 different languages as well.  The movie is based on a trilogy, His Dark Materials.  The author, Phillip Pullman has said in an interview that this trilogy concentrates upon this theme "I Want to kill God in the minds of Children... I want them to decide against God and the Kingdom of Heaven" quote from Phillip Pullman.  The Golden Compass, a sanitized version of the book, wants to have children and young people rebel against parents, teachers, the Church, and anyone in authority.|`|yYGdOdG4aa	No, no, no, you have to understand.  Narnia PROMOTES Christianity, and that's ALWAYS right, no matter how much dishonesty is used in the process, no matter how hypocritical it looks.  <br>  <br>  Golden Compass promotes devil worship (the fact that this isn't TRUE doesn't matter, the gullible will go to their graves believing it), and that can never, ever, EVER be allowed.  Giving even a single second of time to a non-christian perspective makes baby jesus cry.  <br>  <br>  In all seriousness, the distinction between reality and fiction really doesn't register for the people up in arms over things like Harry Potter, The Golden Compass, and The DaVinci Code.|`|SnKGH4PRaa	I'm actually not interested in seeing it either way, its just not my kind of movie.<br>  I am a Christian, but that is not why I do not want to see it. <br>  Most Christians don't want to see it because of what the author said about it. <br>  "I want to kill God in the minds of Children." Its not that it was written by an athiest, but because of hid  his actions.|`|AA11232725	I would guess that Christians who are calling for a boycott are trying to send a message to film makers that they will not make a lot of money putting out films based on books written by someone who has an anti-Christian agenda.<br>  <br>  The author Pullman told the Telegraph newspaper in 2002, "If there is a God and he is as the Christians describe him, then he deserves to be put down and rebelled against. As you look back over the history of the Christian church, it's a record of terrible infamy and cruelty and persecution and tyranny."<br>  <br>  The movie version supposedly waters down the anti-religious angle of the books by blandly identifying the bad guys as anyone who oppresses the free choices of others by imposing moral restrictions and intellectual limitations. This is a popular theme in film. From Footloose to Chocolat the "breaking free" movies are popular metaphors celebrating personal freedom. But these movies are generally coming of age stories while The Golden Compass creates a parallel world where the oppressors are thinly veiled leaders of the church, referred to as the Magisterium.<br>  <br>  Movie director Chris Weitz has said some of the more contentious ideas have been removed from the film version to make it more acceptable for the general public. However, Weitz noted "there may be some modification of terms. You will probably not hear of the 'Church' but you will hear of the Magisterium. Those who will understand will understand. I have no desire to change the nature or intentions of the villains of the piece, but they may appear in more subtle guises."<br>  <br>  Weitz commented on a MTV movie blog, "So, how does one go about adapting a book that has controversial elements into a film that a very wide variety of people can enjoy, without betraying the original? One tries to be clever about it." He continued, "The whole point, to me, of ensuring that The Golden Compass is a financial success is so that we have a solid foundation on which to deliver a faithful, more literal adaptation of the second and third books."<br>  <br>  If that's the case, then the next two movies will be even more explicitly anti-God. For instance:<br>  <br>  In the second book in the trilogy, The Subtle Knife, one of the main characters, Will, is told he possesses a magical knife, "the one weapon in all the universes" that can "defeat the tyrant." That tyrant, of course, is "The Authority. God." <br>  <br>  In the third book, The Amber Spyglass, Will is told that "The Authority" has many names, "God, the Creator, the Lord, Yahweh, El, Adonai, the King, the Father, the Almighty." These were names God "gave himself" even though "he was never the creator." <br>  <br>  One of the final chapters has an ex-nun named Mary telling Will and Lyra, "The Christian religion is a very powerful and convincing mistake, that's all."|`|c23478f3a6f6ccbb83145c92645bca1aaa	i believe it has more to do with supporting the person's intentions. in narnia it was supporting a Christian theme IF you looked into the undertone.  there are athiests who would not see the movie strictly becuase it supported Christianity. look at those who protested the Passion of the Christ.  <br>  as a practicing Catholic i will not go see Compass due to the fact the author's undertones are stated quite clearly as anti religion. this is nothing against athiests as i have friends that are ahtiests, however the undertones of killing and abolishing God.... that offends me very much and i will not spend my money on something like that.
7J1D1IyRaa	I agree with others that you should ask your Imam, but, generally speaking, there are two types of Zakats: Zakat-al-Maal and Zakat-al-Fitr. <br>  <br>  Zakat al-maal is due when your savings reach the prescribed nisab (minimum amount on which zakah is due...see web site link below), which is 2.5% of the savings.  This can be paid at anytime, after it becomes due, but before the end of the year. Zakat al-fitr has to be paid by everybody--rich and poor alike--during Ramadan. There is some disagreement among ulema when in Ramadan Zakat-al-Fitr has to be paid. Some say, anytime during Ramadam. The second opinion is that it should be paid either on the Eid day or couple of days before it. Third opinion is that it should be paid on the day of Eid al-Fitr, preferably before the Eid prayers but no later than the Eid day. <br>  <br>  Link:<br>  <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/islamglobalmessage/fiqh7.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.freewebs.com/islamglobalmessa...</a>|`|519ef3193c386b3b3d2f2378e7c7c876aa	Ask your local imam for direction.

You need to make the right decision for you. Do what makes you happy in the end because you only live once and why live it thinking what if ? <br>  It seems to me that if your heart is with this woman than be with her because who wants to live their life with regrets. You may feel bad about leaving your boyfriend but when things work out with this woman your not going to regret your decision <br>  <br>  Listen to your heart <br>  Good Luck |`|3uRM7FKIaa	You are breaking myheart and anyone with sense will not try to steer you one way or the other. <br>  You say you feel a deep friendship for this man and that is all, so be it. <br>  You want to explore a relationship with this woman, so be it. <br>  <br>  We can't help who we fall in love with and sometimes it happens at the worst possible time. <br>  There is no reason to "dump" the guy but you will have to be honest with him. <br>  You also need to be honest with this woman. <br>  Lastly you need to be honest with yourself. I think you already know the answers to these questions you've asked and don't need us to tell you how to live and love. <br>  <br>  I do wish you the best of luck and I do hope it all turns out the better for you.<br>  <br>  |`|AA11235749	Actually speaking you have no trouble as such though you have dillema in your life. It is clear that we human being are bonded by some moral fence. So we Cannot do whatever we desire to do. Nomatter you are bisexual. But you have control your relation with girls to continue your relation with boyfriend. |`|jxqNTr9Iaa	Do you have to make a decision ??,Obviously you've been seeing this lassie over the last 6 months,sleeping wi her too couldnt you keep the arrangement as it is or do the pair of you want to live together.<br>  <br>  The one thing that comes out is that you don't want to lose anything,your boyfriend,your life,your pets and flat and definetly the new love in your life.Is there anyway you can reach an accomodation btwn you'se where you get both !!!|`|D4wUqW6Laa	This is such a difficult situation for you and I do feel for you. You started seeing her openly, with your boyfriend's consent, you didn't cheat or do anything wrong.<br>  <br>  I know this sounds shallow, but part of me feels that given your boyfriend's age, you should end things sooner rather than later. He doesn't have any kind of social network to meet partners, and I do feel it would be harder to him after 40.... people tend to be so judgemental about age.<br>  <br>  The ideal situation would be if you could talk to your boyfriend and ask if you could continue to see this other woman while you try to work things out. But to be honest, I'm sure this wouldn't go on forever - your woman will eventually tire of waiting and be too hurt to keep loving you but not 'having' you. Your boyfriend no longer wants to share you.<br>  <br>  Could you take some time away from both of them? Sometimes a change of scenery can really help to clarify things in your mind. I'm betting that every good day you have with him makes you lean towards staying with him, and every good day you have with her makes you want to leave him. You need some distance.<br>  <br>  If you have no spark whatsoever with your boyfriend and feel that you are just friends, then there is something wrong.<br>  <br>  But after almost 5 years and everything you've been through... I think I would be inclined to say.... stay for 3 months... see what happens. Make it clear to him that you are trying to work on it. Tell him how you feel. |`|HDbY9q4Caa	When it comes to your love life you have to be selfish and not worry about what other people are going to feel.  I know that is so hard and you just feel awful.  You have to do a pro's and cons' list I suppose about both people.  It sounds to me that you have more complaints about your boyfriend then good things.  I also didn't read anything negative about your relationship with your girlfriend.  If you love her and you feel that you are wasting your time, or there is no spark left with him then it is time to move on and be with the girl you obviously love.  Good luck to you!|`|d3d13ba0e809ccaa53f0485b35ecf9a6aa	usually in the begining of relationship there is more "sparks" cuz it's fresh and exciting, i would suggest u to wait and see what happens like some of ur friends says. he's a nice guy, and he need u, and u love him too, it wont hurt to stay with him longer, think it through until ur sure about it<br>  <br>  gud luck..

Only you can decide when it's time to change this behavior.  Laughter and crying are very strong emotions and closely related.

His homophobia strikes me as being pathological and while I'm not his judge I can say I believe his teachings and actions are truly evil.

God would never contradict his own law for example , God uses his freewill to be completely good and because he has freewill he gives it to us as well , It all just adds up and then people say the Bible and God is nonsense<br>  The only way you can tell if it is from God is if you have the Holy Spirit inside of you|`|zgRvCAJnaa	God does speak to his people today, just like he did back in the biblical times. God not only speaks to his prophets (and there still are some today), but to ever day men, women, and children. If you are a spirit-filled Christian (meaning God's spirit dwells in you,) and you are walking in obedience to God, placing all your trust in God, and putting him first in your life than you will likely hear God's voice. It is not usually an audible voice, but usually a thought or impression. It could even be a dream, or come from someone who is speaking to you. <br>  <br>  Because of this, discerning the voice of God can sometimes be tricky. People often get their thoughts confused with God's thoughts. It is distinctly different than "consciousness" thought because God's thoughts are different than man's thoughts and way higher than man's thoughts. His concept of time is also different. At best, those that hear his voice can only grasp a small measure of the mysteries He reveals to us. <br>  <br>  So in order to understand when God is speaking to us, it is necessary to understand His character. He is always the same-yesterday today and forevermore. He never changes. He always acts in love. He loves everyone-both the unrepentant sinners and the saved (All have sinned and fallen short.) He never abandons his people. His mercies always outweigh his judgments. He always keeps his promises. He always tells the truth. He always has plans to give us a hope and a future full of good things. Most Christians accept the Bible as Truth by faith and use it as measure to examine what they think they've heard from God. If it lines up with what the Bible says is true and lines up with the character of God which is revealed in the Bible, than it is probably from God.<br>  <br>  The problem is that many people have chosen to do evil under the guise that they heard from God and God told them to do so. Many people have misunderstood the Bible or quoted certain scriptures out of context.  It is true that God told Abraham to sacrifice his son, Isaac, in order to test his faith, devotion, and love, but God did not let Abraham go through with that. The fact is, God abhors children sacrifice. Many other examples in the old testament cite how despicable God saw such practices. Its true God does not want us to put anything before Him, and not love anything more than Him because he is a jealous God. He doesn't expect us to love Him like this instantly, though. Instead He woos us, by showing us how good and awesome He is, and then we just fall in love with Him. If we only understood how much He loves us, life would be so much easier and there would be no reason to fear. Fear is usually at the root of most evils, and it in not found in perfect love. Therefore, any action based on fear or hatred is not of God or done according to God's will. The bible makes it clear that murder is a sin. In fact, any action that hurts another person is a sin. The new testament makes it clear that those with God's Spirit living inside of them live according to the spirit and not the flesh. Galatians 5:22 says that those who are abiding with God and living for Him will display the fruits of the Spirit which is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. This is the measure to judge actions by. If it contains these traits it is probably from God. If not, it is probably not from God. Also, the Bible is clear regarding what kinds of deeds come from the flesh or from Satan- sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires, greed, anger, malice, rage, slander, filthy language, brawling, bitterness, unwholesome talk, lies (Colossians 3:5-9) selfish ambition, vanity, conceit (Phillipians 2:3; Ephesians 4:29-32 )greed, and idolatry (Ephesians 4:5). Galatians 5:19 gives a good summary on the acts of the sinful nature: sexual immorality, impurity, debauchery, idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, dissensions, factions, envy, drunkenness, orgies, and the like. <br>  <br>  The one thing hard for most Christians and people to understand is why God allows such evil and suffering in the world or why God let so many people in the old testament be killed due to sin. This topic is still a little difficult for me to wrap my mind around, but I’ll try to explain what I think is the reason. Back in the old testament, Jesus hadn’t been born yet, and hadn’t died yet to save man kind. Therefore sin, always led to death. (I’ll com back to this more in a bit) Sin still does lead to death, but now we have someone who took our place, Jesus. He came to the Earth as a man, and was exposed to all the temptations and suffering that all men get exposed to, yet he remained sinless. Instead he took our sins for us. He died on the cross so we wouldn’t have to die for our sins or go to hell. It’s a free gift offered to all mankind for those who believe and choose to love God and put Him first. Its just that many people do not receive this gift. God created hell for Lucifer (the fallen angel) not for humans, but Lucifer decided to try to get as many people in there with him as he could. So he comes to the Earth to lie, steel, kill, destroy, and discourage people. God gave all of us free will so he won’t stop someone from making their own decisions and choosing to believe Satan and his lies and follow destruction. <br>  <br>  That brings me back to my attempt at an explanation of why God allowed so many in the old testament to die or have plaques, curse, or diseases. First of all, it is not God’s will that anyone be cursed, diseased, or hurt, in any way (Exodus 15:26). God says he has come to give us life and life more abundantly (John 10:10) and to heal or diseases and free us from our sinful nature. Here are three scriptures which emphasize this point:<br>  <br>  <br>  Isaiah 53:4-5<br>  Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed. <br>  Matthew 8:16-17<br>  When the even was come, they brought unto him many that were possessed with devils: and he cast out the spirits with his word, and healed all that were sick: That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying, Himself took our infirmities, and bare our sicknesses.<br>  <br>  1 Peter 2:24<br>  Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed.<br>  <br>  The problem is that some people’s actions were indeed hurting other people and keeping them from experiencing God’s goodness, love, and mercy. They were either deliberately hurting others or leading them away from worshipping God and enticing them into sinful practices which would lead to his very precious people being separated from him and ending up in hell with Satan. He knew everyone’s heart and knew that some people would not change and would go on hurting others. So as an act of mercy towards those whose hearts could and would change he decided to let Satan either wipe out the corruptible people or else punish them in hopes that their heart would turn back to Him. He explained that the corruptible people were like bad yeast which would destroy a whole loaf of bread. Which is more merciful, to let a few die or to let a multitude die? He loves everyone and does not want anyone to be separated from his love.<br>  <br>  The laws were only written to help us live lives which could lead to happiness and fulfillment, not to enslave us. They also were there to show us that we need a savior, someone who can help us make the right choices and will give us strength when we are weak and save us from our won destructible nature. God is nothing but love. Anything contrary to that is not of God.<br>  <br>  God speaks to His people because He loves them and wants them to become holy like He is Holy so he can have close fellowship with them (sin separates us). Through his words to us he encourages us, gives us comfort, leads us in the right way to go, helps us resist sin and temptation, gives, us strength, gives us wisdom, heals, uses us as a mouthpiece to speak words of life and healing to others, and most of all just to love on us.<br>  <br>  The more we get to know God and the more time we spend with him, the easier it becomes to hear His voice.

c9a1b864f1a97925067a5a7737860ac4aa	Answer: After the gift of salvation through Jesus Christ, of all the other gifts given to mankind by God, there is none greater than the presence of the Holy Spirit. The Spirit has many functions, roles, and activities. First, He does a work in the hearts of all people everywhere. Jesus told the disciples that He would send the Spirit into the world to “convict the world concerning sin, and concerning righteousness, and concerning judgment” (John 16:7-11). Everyone has a “God consciousness,” whether they admit it or not, because the Spirit applies the truths of God to men’s own minds as to convince them by fair and sufficient arguments that they are sinners. Responding to that conviction brings men to salvation.<br>  <br>  Once we are saved and belong to God, the Spirit takes up residence in our hearts forever, sealing us with the confirming, certifying, and assuring pledge of our eternal state as His children. Jesus said He would send the Spirit to us to be our Helper, Comforter, and Guide. “And I will pray the Father and He will give you another Helper that He may abide with you forever” (John 14:16). The Greek word translated here “Helper” means one who is called alongside and has the idea of someone who encourages and exhorts. “Abiding” has to do with His permanent residence in the hearts of believers (Romans 8:9; 1 Corinthians 6:19, 20; 12:13). Jesus gave the Spirit as a “compensation” for His absence, to perform the functions toward us which He would have done if He had remained personally with us.<br>  <br>  Among those functions is that of revealer of truth. The Spirit’s presence within us enables us to understand and interpret the Word. Jesus told His disciples “when He, the Spirit of Truth, has come, He will guide you into all truth” (John 16:13). He reveals to our minds the whole counsel of God as it relates to worship, doctrine, and Christian living. He is the ultimate guide, going before, leading the way, removing obstructions, opening the understanding, and making all things plain and clear. He leads in the way we should go in all spiritual things. Without such a guide, we would be apt to fall into error. A crucial part of the Truth He reveals is that Jesus is who He said He is (John 15:26; 1 Corinthians 12:3). The Spirit convinces us of Christ’s deity and sonship, His incarnation, His being the Messiah, His sufferings and death, His resurrection and ascension, His exaltation at the right hand of God, and His role as the Judge of all. He gives glory to Christ in all things (John 16:14).<br>  <br>  Another of His roles is that of gift-giver. First Corinthians 12 describes the spiritual gifts given to believers in order that we may function as the body of Christ on earth. All these gifts, both great and small, are given by the Spirit so that we may be His ambassadors to the world, showing forth His grace and glorifying Him.<br>  <br>  The Spirit also functions as fruit-producer in our lives. When He indwells us, He begins the work of harvesting His fruit in our lives - love, joy, peace, long-suffering, kindness, goodness, faith, meekness, and self-control (Galatians 5:22-23). These are not works of our flesh, which is incapable of producing such fruit, but they are products of the Spirit’s presence in our lives.<br>  <br>  The knowledge that the Holy Spirit of God has taken up residence in our lives, that He performs all these miraculous functions, that He dwells with us forever and will never leave or forsake us is cause for great joy and comfort. Thank God for this precious Gift – the Holy Spirit and His work in our lives!<br>  <br>  Recommended Resource: The Holy Spirit by Charles Ryrie.|`|7422ddf097669bd7b6e3d48e56258b87aa	The Holy Spirit is also the divine life of God himself, dwelling in a human soul ... and without that life, the chances of being admitted to heaven aren't very good.|`|RdmRwv9iaa	1108 In every liturgical action the Holy Spirit is sent in order to bring us into communion with Christ and so to form his Body. The Holy Spirit is like the sap of the Father's vine which bears fruit on its branches. The most intimate cooperation of the Holy Spirit and the Church is achieved in the liturgy. The Spirit who is the Spirit of communion, abides indefectibly in the Church. For this reason the Church is the great sacrament of divine communion which gathers God's scattered children together. Communion with the Holy Trinity and fraternal communion are inseparably the fruit of the Spirit in the liturgy.

AA10124391	Dancing is letting yourself go - being free to enjoy the music, enjoy movement and letting your cares go away.<br>  <br>  If you are self-conscious of your dancing, it's most likely because you think people are looking at you and judging you, which honestly is not the case.  In the case where people ARE judging/watching (like you do) then those people are just too afraid to dance and really, who cares what those people think anyway - they're scared to dance!!!!<br>  <br>  The choice, really, is yours.  Are you willing to be free or willing to be a slave to other people's perceived opinions?    I choose to dance!|`|Es3mVh8naa	I've never really thought about that, but now that you've pointed it out, I realize it's pretty true. I'm thinking that it's because public speaking involves being in the spotlight by yourself, all the attention is on you, and it's easier for people to judge when it's just one person in the spotlight. But when your on the dance floor there is usually a lot of people in your surroundings moving to the music with you, so It's not that awkward, you as an individual don't stand out as one person, when people look around they see groups of people, so people are less afraid of judgment because they are surrounded by people in the same type of atmosphere, moving with them at the same time, and spotlight is not on anyone (most of the time).<br>  <br>  So even though to some it may seem terrifying to dance in front of people and it feels as if your naked and people are looking at you and can see right through, the risk of judgment is higher when your by yourself. So just remember to have fun, and forget what others think at the moment when you start getting nervous.|`|fH2Zlumjaa	Not many people enjoy "breaking loose" with public speaking

AA10387487	As for the question of "Why do some women like being artificial?"...Some women don't consider those things as artifice. Many women have been taught that looks are more important than personality, intelligence, sense of humor, etc., and some may view those physical "enhancements" as a requirement for attracting/keeping a male partner. Others may view those options as something that will help them feel better about themselves (e.g., a woman who has been subjected to cruel remarks about her nose, weight, small breasts, etc. and feels compelled to change those things for her own emotional well-being). <br>  <br>  Yes, physical attraction or similarity can be a very real part of what draws one person to another, but based on what you've indicated in the details of your question, if the only thing that person is interested in is how you look, you will probably view him or her as superficial and will not find the friendship/relationship fulfilling. <br>  <br>  You also asked, "Is a real woman just not good enough these days?" It depends on whose opinion and approval you consider most important. If you like who your are and value yourself for being "real", then that attitude and confidence will shine through in your interactions with other people, and the ones who are genuinely interested in getting to know you (male or female) will respect you for it instead of criticizing or trying to turn you into a carbon copy of themselves.

Porque, simplemente, somos distintos. <br>  Si feminismo quiere decir que las mujeres sean "en todo" igual que los hombres, no soy feminista. <br>  Ahora, si feminismo quiere decir que las mujeres tenemos derechos, que se nos debe respetar, dar nuestro lugar, considerar como también inteligentes y capaces....hasta de ser presidentas! eso sí está bien. <br>  <br>  Es que se confunde el término de feminismo, me parece a mí.Porque en la sociedad antigua la mujer estaba denigrada, anulada, puesta como "inferior" al hombre, maltratada...eso no es a lo que me refiero. <br>  Yo me refiero a "derechos de mujer", no a "derechos de todos iguales".<br>  <br>  <br>  Aunque hoy se casen entre mujeres y entre hombres y además ?quieran adoptar hijos!, <br>  hay "roles" naturales y sociales que se deben conservar.<br>  Otro ejemplo, es que las mujeres quieren ser sacerdotes en la Iglesia Católica, pero la Iglesia quiere conservar el "rol de la mujer" semejante al de la Virgen.<br>  Dios nos puso a las mujeres como madres, esposas que "atienden" con servicio y amor a sus maridos e hijos, somos más débiles físicamente, más femeninas, más "suaves"...<br>  <br>  No somos iguales, no todo es lo mismo.<br>  ...hay "roles" y lugares que, aunque el mundo avance "equivocadamente", Dios dispuso y la Iglesia quiere conservar y defiende. <br>  <br>  <br>  A mí, personalmente, me gusta que mi hombre tenga "su lugar" de hombre, más fuerte, cabeza de familia...y no por eso él se aprovecha y se convierte en déspota que toma solo las decisiones, me tiene de sirvienta, no me consulta nada...pues, la pareja formada con amor, se respeta, cada uno tiene su lugar, no se igualan, no hay feminismo ni machismo, y se sienten plenos, felices, libres, compa?eros...<br>  yo como mamá dulce y suave, femenina, que atiendo a mis hijos y a mi hombre sin ser su esclava, más bien, la reina amada de la casa.<br>  él como rey respetado, amado, servido, caballero, respetuoso, gentil...<br>  <br>  O sea, para mí jamás los hombres serán lo mismo que las mujeres ni viceversa, aunque sí las mujeres tengamos los derechos que nos corresponden como mujer. Pero "como mujer" no como hombre.<br>  <br>  Gracias por darme la oportunidad de responder.<br>  <br>  Dios te bendiga, amigo.|`|ARHZtZcSaa	Por la misoginia que a lo largo del tiempo se les ha inculcado, se sienten amenazados ante la posibilidad de ser desplazados.<br>  No definitivamente no tiene nada que ver na cosa con la otra.<br>  <br>  Hombres y mujeres tenemos capacidades físicas distintas y somos complemento, ni mas, ni menos unos de otros.<br>  <br>  Saludos.|`|Pem5Rmffaa	y? si vivieramos de lo que los demas piensan...ya hubieramos muerto|`|2BmiFSgAaa	Bueno, el sentirse diferente o superior, o adoptar una postura de someter al otro denota una inseguridad esencial en cuanto al genero. <br>  Seguramente esos hombres tendran miedo al genero femenino, o a lo que tenga que ver con la parte femenina de si mismos.<br>  La parte femenina tiene que ver con la receptividad, con poder fundirse, con fluir, con su parte mas emocional a la que seguramente la asocian con fragilidad o devilidad. La parte femenina de esos machistas esta reprimida, pero eso no quiere decir que no forme parte de ellos, mas bien no la pueden integrar  a su parte consciente.<br>  Y de hecho no pueden ser totales.<br>  La raiz esta en el prejuicio y en el legado que la iglesia catolica a dejado. Fijate sino en el papel que le ha otorgado la iglesia a Maria magdalena, el arquetipo de mujer, va de un extremo al otro, o virgen o prostituta. Esos no son los paradigmas reales con los que estamos conviviendo en la actualidad.<br>  <br>  Te felicito en nombre de todas las mujeres por poder tomar una postura tan sabia y poder asi disfrutar de ti mismo en la totalidad de lo que te constituye.<br>  La dualidad dorma la totalidad... ya sabemos los efectos de la integracion de ambas partes y el regalo que es ello.<br>  <br>  Besos amigo|`|IsvV57Zwaa	Pero, si se trata de igualdad no debería haber ni feminismo ni machismo, la verdad el feminismo si proclama la superioridad de la mujer y por tanto, yo estoy totalmente de acuerdo (jajajaja)... además, no quiere decir que eres gay si te proclamas feminista, para mí, simplemente puede ser una especie de devoción por la mujer, por sus cualidades y valores tan diferentes pero tan cautivadores, es decir, está embelezado por la belleza femenina por tanto,  debes aceptar que el que no reconoce la superioridad de la mujer sigue siendo machista en el fondo... !!! pero qué más da, los hombres son machistas, las mujeres feministas pero esa es nuestra naturaleza... las mujeres también somos machistas, porque nos gustan los machos!! claro no en toda su extensión de la palabra, pero, el encanto machista existe y por eso nos gusta tanto!!|`|orIttxiZaa	Los que piensan eso  es que o son machistas o ignorantes supinos o las dos cosas.<br>  Ehorbuena por tu forma de ser!|`|xFHDZmfUaa	Si las feministas dijeran lo que realmente quieren y de lo que hablan en sus reuniones, no convencerían a nadie.<br>  <br>  Paz|`|uYgXUTZMaa	por su misoginia patologica|`|kONI50tSaa	Considero al feminismo la anulacion de la mujer por la mujer misma, pero no por ello son homosexuales los hombres que se solidarizan con ellas.<br>  <br>  Ya la palabra feminismo denota muchas cosas negativas, deberian reinventarse.<br>  <br>  Por mas que pidan igualdad, no existe.|`|Pz5aVVHwaa	Es por la forma en que lo dices, mas bien deberias decir, estoy a favor del feminismo y de la igualdad entre ambos sexos, equidad de genero.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  |`|vrFuDko2aa	Pues porque las costumbres civilizadas como las tuyas, que reconocen los derechos de todo el mundo, no se hicieron para los trogloditas que te dicen eso,  por eso no te entienden.|`|YYzmPhwXaa	Es que realmente el feminismo tiene un nombre equivocado.

Son machistas, y viven cómodamente arrllanados en sus convicciones, y tienen miedo de que se les acabe el chollo.

The planet called "Lord" comes around every 3,600 years causing earthquakes and large meteor showers with its gravitational pull. The "Lord's Day" is thus that terrible.

Another factoid - the Blue Lotus Blossom was always dipicted in sensual paintings. There is a botanical sanctuary, I think in the UK, that has the actual Blue Lotus living there.

Denials of the historical existence of Jesus have frequently been attempted.<br>  <br>  NON-CHRISTIAN sources attest to the historical existence of Jesus. The statements of Tacitus around 117 (Annales XV,44), of Pliny the Younger around 112/113 (letter to the emperor Trajan), and of Suetonius around 120 (Vita Claudis, ch. 25) are reliable and historically conclusive and we may admit them as trustworthy evidence. We also possess statements by the Jewish writer <br>  <br>  Josephus Flavius from around 93/94 which permit us to accept his knowledge of the historical personality of Jesus.<br>  As far as I am concerned, the best proof that Jesus is for real is the fact that he answers my prayers. I am not trying to pull your leg, it is true. He has also revealed himself in countless ways to believers so he is truly risen.<br>  <br>  Peace and every blessing|`|y43vKp9Raa	When he was actually alive.....nothing.

Allora Mussolini come reazione inaugurò la politica dell'autarchia, cioè l'uso esclusivo di prodotti italiani al posto degli stranieri le cui importazioni erano bloccate, contemporaneamente si voleva anche purificare la nazione dagli influssi "malefici" del mondo esterno, così il cachet diventò il cialdino, il goal divenne gollo ecc. CIAO|`|RoHjjzXWaa	E' vero. Io so che, ad esempio, poiché la parola "cocktail" (così come le altre parole straniere) era bandita, era stato coniato (ma non so quanto venisse usato) l'equivalente italiano: "Coda di gallo"!

ljwpPXiXaa	The simple answer is that a large, unified entity is more powerful and self-reliant than several small quarreling ones.<br>  <br>  Back in the old days, when Japan was divided into several independent states, no one state had everything it needed. This led to many battles over territory and resources, cost lots of money to pay, feed, and supply troops with weapons, the cost of rebuilding damaged communities, and one can never forget the amount of lives lost due to these power struggles.<br>  <br>  A unified Japan would be free of those struggles, with the entire country working together and diverting resources from wherever they may be to wherever they were needed.<br>  <br>  There's also the fact that men in power tend to desire more power, and the easiest way to accumulate more power (especially in those days) is to control more land.<br>  <br>  Religion has always been an easy way to manipulate people into doing what you want, and it usually involves less bloodshed than open war, so it was simply the Meiji Government's preferred weapon of conquest.|`|QyzcyAAYaa	I should know this Answer, but I'm so set against Religion, even Japanese religion gives Me the Creeps.

There are atheist who believe god does not exist and those who see no reason to believe that god exist. I am of the latter. I see no reason to believe in the stories in the Bible or told in church. So there is no arrogance on my part. <br>  <br>  The arrogance here is to believe that your view, that God does exist and it's up to me to prove it is the only arrogance here.|`|yenI8awjaa	In essence, you contend that gods (and in particular your god) have a status above and beyond that of Santa Claus or the Easter Bunny or invisible pink dragons floating around in the evening sky.<br>  <br>  I disagree. You don't challenge my knowledge when I use it in assessing the Easter Bunny or Zeus or Ra are not real, yet you do when it comes to your particular god. The proof for all is of equal substance.
AA10262488	honestly? Well for millions of people it's just more easy!|`|9449e10cc4bd54a354c906e0564176ecaa	First off, atheists do not believe that everything happened by mere chance.  And they are not "gambling away their eternity."  They simply do not see a reason to believe in a god.  I'm not an atheist myself (though I do have doubts sometimes), but I can see where they would come to the conclusion that there is no god.  <br>  <br>  And they do not "embrace" theories like evolution out of "beast envy."  They accept them because they are supported with so much evidence that it's simply silly to deny them.<br>  <br>  And for the record, atheism is quite prevalent in the East as well as in the West.  Japan and Vietnam have very high atheism rates.

Something parents tell thier kids.  A more accurate way to say it would be 'Patience is a virture.'  This statement is true.  But, there is no rule that states 'You were patient.  Now, here is some good stuff.'  Good things come to good people that work hard.  And bad people that lie, cheat and steal.

I have plenty of experiences but feel the followed one is best.<br>  <br>  I got an opportunity in a Company where I should be under 6 months training at which 'No Pay with Two Years Bond'.  Many people joined, but start criticising from the second day itseslf eventhough they knew everything.<br>  <br>  But I used to work hard as per the company rules and did not ask anything in between.  Exactly after six months they made my job permanant with high salary than they offered for my loyalty, hardwork, sincerety, and of course 70% of skill got in the training at that point of time.<br>  <br>  But I did never criticise my Trainer, Team Lead, Project Manger, or even HR.  As they told, I have waited for 6 months without making any Nuisance. <br>  <br>  I believe my Guru words - Do Good, Have Patience and Have Faith.  Things will become alright.<br>  <br>  Those who do not have patience and faith and go for bad things, they may get rewarded for timebeing but one fine morning they will find the result (Even as per Newton Law).  We may not know because those people can not express outside (even though they are suffering for their bad thing done in the past) due to their Greed or some other reasons.<br>  <br>  I welcome your experience if you have.

AA11945739	Statistically, it is not the majority religion of the world.<br>  <br>  It became the majority religion in most of Europe in the year 380 CE when: "On 27th February, Christianity becomes the exclusive religion of the Roman Empire by an edict of Emperor Flavius Theodosius, requiring that "all the various nations, which are subject to our clemency and moderation should continue in the profession of that religion, which was delivered to the Romans by the divine Apostle Peter". Non-christians are called "loathsome, heretics, stupid and blind". In another edict Theodosius calls "insane" those that do not believe in the christian god and outlaws all disagreements with the Church dogmas. Ambrosius, bishop of Milan, starts destroying all the Pagan Temples of his area. Christian priests lead the mob against the Temple of Goddess Demeter in Eleusis and try to lynch the hierophants Nestorius and Priskus. The 95 year-old hierophant Nestorius, ends the Eleusinian Mysteries and announces the predominance of mental darkness over the human race.

They were doing what you said: showing how Jesus fulfilled the prophecies and is the Messiah.  Most of the gospels were written because the church was spreading so far and so fast that the Apostles couldn't visit each church and teach in person, so they wrote letters to be sent around.

8ed420895c19f53c57a36e8c7c9591e3aa	It's fine to drink water while wearing them, the water won't do anything to them. In fact I find it helps to dampen the fangs with a little moisture before I wear them, not sure why but it makes them feel less dry and so more comfortable. The fangs can give you a bit of a lisp but I guess it's because I've never had enough practice talking with them. These fangs look amazing, they're pretty convincing but as for the molding personally I think 2 capsules for each fang iwill give a better fit, one certainly wasn't enough on my first go and I had to redo it. Once they are molded there's no need for remolding. Hope that helps.

PGcJROA1aa	You don't know much about Bible history, do you? Most of the New Testament was written before 70 AD, and some of it was written within 10 years of Jesus' death. What makes it true is that those who wrote the new testament scriptures actually lived at the time of Christ. They actually SAW the miracles. It wasn't hearsay- they testify that they TOUCHED Jesus, they saw Him perform miracles, they HEARD what He said. The 4 gospels were written from 4 different viewpoints, and they are remarkably similar, with some minor differences, as is to be expected when you have different witnesses giving accounts.<br>      <br>      Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy and presumably Job were written by Moses, who actually talked with God. He spent 40 days on Mount Sinai talking to the living God, whom the people of Israel also heard. All he did was write down what God told him to write. Each of the prophets of God wrote what the spirit of God told them- and most of their prophecies actually came true- the captivity of Israel in Babylon, the rebuilding of the temple.<br>       The thing that makes the Bible true is because archeology and history give credence to the things written there, unlike the Quran and Buddist writings. The Quran was written over 400 years after Mohammed died. Now THERE'S a problem. Nobody was alive who actually knew Mohammed when they started writing down what he said. They could have made him say anything. The Bible has actual witnesses. In a court of law, it would be considered evidence and proof of its validity.<br>     As far as being translated several times, scholars will tell you that there has been little deviation from the original manuscripts. There are several 'versions', which are written in modern dialect to help us understand the scripture better, but those who wrote these versions took great care not to change the original meaning.|`|DyY2Uj7maa	Your reasoning is insanity .

The only problem is that Christianity offers the only solution to sin that is not merit or works based.  Being that mankind is obviously sinful (or evil since you dont believe in sin), how can someone sinful reconcile himself to one that has no sin?<br>  <br>  The only way is to provide a sacrifice that is sufficient to pay the price for sin that is outside of human efforts.  Most other religions rely on mankind's efforts to reach a "higher state" or some plane wherein they can be justified.  By simply observing, it is very hard to believe anyone on this planet could ever qualify for any higher level on their own.<br>  <br>  Add to that that over 400 prophecies were fulfilled in Jesus life.  The mathematical odds of one person fulfilling all of those prophecies within their life is quite astounding.<br>  <br>  There are numerous other evidences out there that the bible is true.  If God is omnipotent, then its fair to assume that he has the power to preserve his word throughout history, and through the writers (who were inspired) and through the edits, etc.  Take that away though, and the bible is still a very astounding book, having survived thousands of years (hebrew and greek texts) and remaining virtually unchanged.  When the Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered in 1947 (?), there were no significant differences found in those scrolls from the texts that were available and had gone through human handling.  Compare this to Shakespeare which has entire chapters missing, and is only a few hundred years old.|`|VoMKYP6zaa	There is only one true religion.

If not look them up.<br>  <br>  Secondly, Islam -- in its truest form -- can't be true because it teaches hate and violence. Jesus the Christ taught forgiveness and loving your neighbor. <br>  <br>  Third, Christianity came from Judaism, and within the Jewish traditions when a person is translating scripture if even one mark is out of place the entire scroll is tossed out and the person begins again.<br>  <br>  Fourth, Buddhism teaches that there is no almighty God, no forgiveness, no soul, no eternal life; so how can there be a heaven in that religion?<br>  <br>  <br>  To HAUG:<br>  <br>  The Dead Sea Scrolls have been carbon-14 dated to 250 BC and 68 AD. When was Constantine born? When did he die?<br>  <br>  Not one mention of Jesus -- what about this from Tacitus?<br>  "But not all the relief that could come from man, not all the bounties that the prince could bestow, nor all the atonements which could be presented to the gods, availed to relieve Nero from the infamy of being believed to have ordered the conflagration, the fire of Rome. Hence to suppress the rumor, he falsely charged with the guilt, and punished Christians, who were hated for their enormities. Christus, the founder of the name, was put to death by Pontius Pilate, procurator of Judea in the reign of Tiberius: but the pernicious superstition, repressed for a time broke out again, not only through Judea, where the mischief originated, but through the city of Rome also, where all things hideous and shameful from every part of the world find their center and become popular. Accordingly, an arrest was first made of all who pleaded guilty; then, upon their information, an immense multitude was convicted, not so much of the crime of firing the city, as of hatred against mankind."|`|58WOQVj5aa	Why would God have more than one religion and one way to "be saved"?  If he is God, he is perfect.  Perfection does not leave room for inconsistancy or indecision.  There must only be one right way.  Or God would cease to be God.<br>  God speaks through prophets and that is how the bible was written.  Through revelation directly from God himself.  "whether by mine own voice or by the voice of my servants, it is the same" D&C 1:38<br>  And yes the bible was altered and changed by man many times.  Plain and precious truths were lost.  Wouldn't this then require a prophet called of God, with the authority and revelation, to fix what man altered?<br>  And why would God only give us one book to live by?  What about other prophets and people in other lands than just the Old World? "Other sheep I have which are not of this fold"<br>  Just something to think about!|`|vrAiFHNCaa	2 John 1:<br>   19.

If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed:<br>   11.  For he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds.<br>  <br>  1 John 2:<br>  21.  I have not written unto you because ye know not the truth, but because ye know it, and that no lie is of the truth.<br>   22.  Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son.<br>   23.  Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father: [but] he that acknowledgeth the Son hath the Father also.|`|0NOiAlJOaa	God sent His His Spirit to earth in the form of a human (Jesus Christ), to show us the way back to Him. God is not trying to save all peoples of the earth now. The answer is that God is working out His plan in dealing with humanity over a 7,000-year period. For the first 6,000 years, God is allowing humanity to experiment with various forms of religion, education, government and culture. Through spiritual emptiness and physical and emotional agony, humanity is now writing the lesson in human suffering that man’s ways always turn out to be wrong. Having learned this lesson, humanity will be far more ready to listen genuinely when God does open their minds and hearts to His Truth. <br>       "How cruel!" some may say. "Why did God not just send a perfect teacher, and show us the right ways in a positive and loving manner?" My friend,  He did do just that! God did send His Son to this earth as a kind, merciful, loving Teacher who healed the sick, comforted the downtrodden and taught the way to eternal life. Did humanity embrace Him, believe Him and joyously follow His teachings? No. Instead they killed Him in one of the most slow, painful, agonizing forms of death ever devised by a depraved humanity under the influence of Satan the Devil. Remember, it was the religious leaders who stirred up the masses to ask for Christ’s death. They wanted to preserve the religious establishment of their day. After all, their jobs were on the line! Even Pilate, the secular Roman governor, perceived the real issue: "For he knew that the chief priests had handed Him over because of envy" (Mark 15:10). <br>  Additionally, God sent prophet after prophet into the world—especially to teach and warn His people, Israel. Were they warmly received? Notice what God said through Jeremiah: "Since the day that your fathers came out of the land of Egypt until this day, I have even sent to you all My servants the prophets, daily rising up early and sending them. Yet they did not obey Me or incline their ear, but stiffened their neck. They did worse than their fathers" (Jeremiah 7:25–26). So—except for calling a comparatively few dedicated individuals in each age to understand His Truth and to do His Work—God is indeed allowing humanity to go its own way. And where does that way lead? "There is a way that seems right to a man, But its end is the way of death" (Proverbs 14:12). <br>  <br>  Salvation is preparation for ETERNITY|`|nHKsWkv7aa	All religions can't be correct. They make contradictory statements. For example, Jesus claimed to be the only way to God. All religions except Christianity deny that. Either one religion is true, or none of them are.<br>  <br>  Also, for the record, 39 of the 66 books of the Bible were written before Jesus (many predicting His coming, see Isaiah 53, Psalm 22). The rest were written within the first century, not hundreds of years later.<br>  <br>  The Bible has been translated many times, yes. How does that make it less the truth? If I translate the words "The earth is round" into 20 different languages, does that make it any less true or reliable?<br>  <br>  Perhaps you mean it has been copied many times? Yes, it has. However, we have so many copies (thousands more than any other text of the ancient world)  that if there is an error in one manusript, we can check it with the rest of the manuscripts and the earliest one's to tell which one is correct.<br>  <br>  For example, if 5 scribes all make an error in copying one sentence, we can cross-check it with the others and the true sentence will come through:<br>  <br>  The wkrld is round.<br>  The world ig round<br>  The world is rounf.<br>  The world is round.<br>  The dorld is round.<br>  <br>  See what I mean? The original obviously was "The world is round." Despite all of the scribes being quite sloppy, we still get the message. The mistakes are corrected by looking at the other copies. It is the same with biblical manuscripts (who's scribes were much more reliable!).<br>  <br>  The Bible is the product of both man and God. God inspired the men who wrote it. God used the writing styles of many different human authors to communicate His message.|`|ridu0Rtwaa	The Roman Emperor Constantine produced the bible and he was a pagan not god!!!   He also organized Christianity into the Holly Roman Catholic Church!!<br>  <br>  What a wonder full disinformation and deception campaign he waged against his Christian enemies - so good in fact that Christians are still following the deception to this day!!!<br>  <br>  And if the bible is true how can Christians explain that there is not one single mention of Jesus in the entire Roman record - that is right - not one!!!

Well, he is good at his work of misguiding people.<br>  <br>  There is 'truth' and 'lies that appear like truth'. Both are not the same. A truth is a truth and a lie is a lie. It can't be vice versa.<br>  <br>  You say that the Bible is a product of man. I say even if GOD came down and wrote it in front of you, you would not have believed. The 'TEN COMMANDMENTS' were written by GOD himself with fire coming down and making the inscriptions. Still there were many among the children of Israel who did not believe. You are no different.<br>  <br>  Regarding your comment "all for one and one for all " I don't agree. It is like saying "my dad and the neigbour's dad are the same". No my dad is my dad and the neigbour's dad is someone else. So all religions are not the same and they do not lead to the same place.<br>  <br>  People like you may say that all rivers lead into the ocean, but I say all rivers do not lead into the 'same' ocean.<br>  <br>  GOD bless you.

A lot of people say that it's possible to be possessed when using a wiji board with a group...hmmm... test that out? Or maybe you can try to contact the dead another way, my friends and I read about another way to use a wiji board. You have to make it, you write all these symbols in a circle on squares of paper and set up the squares in a circle. Take a glass and put it in the middle of the circle and move it. If the glass cracks, someone in that room has just been possessed so watch out. There's another thing that we play, not so much a game, but it's just at midnight, EXACTLY 12AM, we take a hand held mirror, ask it a question and if it cracks, a ghost has attempted to answer you. I'm not sure about the exact directions on how to do those last two, so you'll have to do a little bit more research on those, but that's basically how you "play". Hoped I helped. :] 
AA10835897	Bella dresses more of a tomboy-ish type of girl, so a too girly dress might get you mistaken with somebody else. If you don't have brown hair, you might need a wig. curling your hair would be really pretty, but it'd be good to have some fangs. I would use Scarecrow fangs, which are available at www.vampfangs.com and www.hottopic.com. Party City does have fangs, but I'm not sure if they're Scarcrow. According to what I've found out, scarecrow subtle fangs are comfy and look natural. (well as natural as fangs can get...) I don't think a cape would mathc, because in Twilight the vampires just look like normal people. The golden/orangy/glowing contacts would be cool, but make sure they're warm-looking and not scary-looking. Bella has to look simple and plain-jane. :] Did that help?|`|8DLu80mLaa	When she first wakes up from being transformed, she is wearing a blue silky dress right?

8ZeVg0QZaa	If I knew how old you were, this would make more sense. <br>  <br>  If you are a teenager, then it is probably just you going through a phase of experimenting and growing with yourself. You are still straight. You don't need to be gay or bi to cross-dress, but you can consider yourself part of the emo crowd. <br>  <br>  In general, however, you probably shouldn't be dwelling on sex. A sex-driven mind often doesn't add up to much. Try exploring the world of charity, whether it be through big events or just being really nice. Porn gets us no where but into addiction and wastes of time. <br>  <br>  You are straight. It is a choice to become gay or bi, one that should not be determined by the unrealistic fantasies of pornography. Focus on yourself as a person, not as someone needing to find out how they are in bed. You can be great friends with plenty of people, guys and girls, but there is a different and very special feeling when that special girl comes along. Wait for her and don't waste yourself on sex in the meantime. Become a great man.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|3e6a7b1f3e03a56ef0cc271441e2531daa	Well, it sounds like you've discovered that sexual orientation is not black and white, but it includes ever imaginable shade and hue.  <br>  <br>  You are a normal healthy heterosexual male with one little kink in your brain.  Your brain is hard-wired to release neurotransmitters with feminine beauty and feminization.  These neurotransmitters give you a sensation of pleasure, well-being, sexual gratification and self-identity.  It affects the reward centers of your brain and therefore mimics the addiction response.  You may feel as if you NEED to crossdress.<br>  <br>  Your attraction includes anything feminine, anything associated with feminine beauty.  You probably have a stereotype of the ultra-feminine that includes soft smooth clothes, switchy skirts, patent leather shoes, long silky hair, nail polish, etc... However during your formative years this image did not include naked private parts.<br>  <br>  As a crossdresser you may fantasize about what you would have been like if you were a real woman.  You may try to create a female alter-ego, and give "her" a feminine name.  When crossdressers imagine themselves as women, they something fantasize about having sex with a man.  However, this is just a feminizing fantasy and in real life they have no desire to have homosexual sex.  The vast majority of crossdressers are heterosexual.<br>  <br>  Crossdressers make up about 10% of our society.  The vast majority of them keep their crossdressing private, very private.  They consider their condition as a "problem".  They place limits on their crossdressing and lead normal healthy productive lives.  They get married and have families like normal members of society.<br>  <br>  There are a few crossdressers that see no problem with their condition.  They prefer to celebrate their crossdressing.  Their crossdressing dominates their lives and they fall in love with their feminine alter-ego.  Nothing in their lives is more important than their crossdressing.  These people teach us that unless you take control over your crossdressing, your crossdressing will take control of you.<br>  |`|JBrWoUTDaa	i'd say drag queen/ gay. mostly drag.|`|c659f3a5d7cbc0e61b19bd54522a13b9aa	you confused even me. you said your sexually attracted to women but theyre very alien like down there. then you say that male parts dont turn you on but two guys having sex do. why dont you experiment?|`|43ZsGHwsaa	interesting, maybe you should see a sex psychologist....|`|9V1kO3sVaa	you may be BI|`|ihjEAoKRaa	Your age is a factor here.  If you are between the ages of 13 and 18 I would just wait it out.  Keep looking at things and aasking your self what you are really attracted to.  If you ar over 18 then you need to experiment to find out what you like.  Sometimes people are turned off by new things.  Even if a guy is attracted to a girl the vagina may seem like an alien until he knows what to do with it.  Penises may be easier to become arroused by just because they are familiar.  Everyone goes through confusion at some point in their development.  This confusion can last years.  I'm straight but watching pretty much any combination of people doing it is a turn on.  The penis was scary to me at first and the vagina seemed more natural.  Jsut give yourself time to sort it all out.  And don't label yourself as gay, straight, bi until you really know.|`|JEzgrdjIaa	You've contradicted yourself.<br>  In the first paragraph you say that you are attracted to women, and women only, and have no attraction whatsoever to men.<br>  Then, you go on to contradict this by saying that a naked woman wouldn't turn you on, but watching a man and a woman getting it on does, and watching a man and a man does.<br>  Have you ever done anything with a man?<br>  --That is one of, if not THE only way to tell.<br>  To me, it sounds like you are bisexual.<br>  However, you sound very confused, and, don't forget that YOU are the only one that knows your sexuality..|`|AA10124391	When you have sexual dreams, do you dream of being with a man or a woman?  The cross-dressing aspect has nothing to do with your sexuality; many cross-dressers are straight.<br>  <br>  You did, however, state in the beginning that you are only attracted to women sexually, but then say you don't get turned on by a naked woman.  I think you are spinning a tale here.|`|315asbf6aa	You are what you are.  No more and no less.  Stop worrying about a label and just get on with your life.<br>  <br>  Sounds like you sometimes want to have sex with women and some times dress like them.<br>  <br>  What I didn't come away with was when dressed like a woman would you want to still make love to another woman or then do you want to be taken by a man?<br>  <br>  Either way you chose it to be ...or any other way...it is just you.  Now the only thing to do is find someone who likes you as you are.|`|VXSY2Gyiaa	i don't think that you are gay you are straight but you are confused with yourself.. it's not a matter on if you are gay or not or what your sexuality is you are just confused with your self.. |`|npj4DJ42aa	Sounds like you'd probably quite like male crossdressers or transgendered folk. Go with whatever makes you happy.|`|FS9Y3guWaa	i would say gay if a woman's naked body doesnt turn u on and u get aroused by two men. gay, but a bit confused.|`|tTyunxBHaa	i actually really have nooooo idea what the heck you are..............|`|OA6KLhg1aa	okay lets see.. you say you are attracted to women... but I think you are attracted to what they look like. Perhaps you are pansexual, but in all honesty it just seems to me that you are a gay man you is attracted to other gay man who like to cross-dress. I mean think about it. You are attracted to what women look like, but not to women themselves. Perhaps you just need to find someone you will fall in love with.<br>  My advice: FORGET ABOUT GENDERS. If you can think of both genders as something you are attracted to, you have twice the chance of finding your soul mate. Don't you agree? |`|qngPrkJUaa	thats a tough one.. You seem kind of unique, so don't try to think of a term society cooked up. It's like fitting a square peg in a round hole. just do what you feel like and don't worry about what you are considered|`|47OAGqLUaa	ok how are you sexually attracted to woman if they dont turn u on? but sounds to me that u just need to explore around more with both and see what you really like
qikhn2o7aa	For one thing no one is perfect. Everyone has said certain things about others at one point in their lives. For some it is intentional and others it may be out of rage.  Many people are racist because they were either brought up that way. Or it can be many other factors that have to do with why they are racist. It could be a person's experiences, where the individual lives (environment), social/historical reasons, political views. A lot plays a part in this. But for the most part, those who are racist are ignorant people.|`|cRI99L8Waa	I will try to answer this as best as I can just from what I've seen in my life. I have personally witnessed several ways people become racist. Of course these aren't the only reasons, but here goes:<br>             Ignorance<br>             Raised in a racist household<br>             Had a very bad experience with a person or people<br>             of a certain race and applied it to everyone<br>             Have a tremendous amount of anger that gets misplaced<br>             somewhere the person feels safe displaying it (and for some <br>             people hating others is safer than hating who/what you're really <br>             angry with)<br>             Some cultures really do believe that they are the master race<br>             and everyone else is beneath them.<br>  <br>  So these are reasons that I've seen with my own eyes, from living lots of places and knowing lots of people. I think religious bigotry is just as bad too. <br>  <br>  |`|rx0vNQ3Kaa	because people are just ignorant and have to judge and make fun of others because how they look because they feel so bad about themselves. everyone's the same some of us are just different colors than some others..but people just want to be racist because it gives them someone to hate for no reason and i think that they're just stupid.|`|74clFHSjaa	ignorance <br>  |`|1RzVIFJvaa	idk but theirs a kid in my class and he races to everybody except Mexicans because he had a day dream that a American guy was about to shoot his dad!|`|VAa89s7jaa	me too i hate those pricks they need to get there heads smashed|`|4a43ce24fc25ee210c17b8882b616386aa	They have nothing better to do with their spare time, sad isn't it lol.|`|BMLHwL13aa	They Make me mad too.<br>  i actually hate them..<br>  sometimes people are racist because it makes them feel better.<br>  and they think it funny.<br>  but they only think that because they dont get on the other persons choose.<br>  <br>  i have an example.<br>  like im spanish so i have an accent and they sometimes make fun of me. but i think that if they got on my shoes and feel how i feel they would learn a lesson.<br>  sometimes i just tell people that im spanish and i have a accent but a least i can speak 3 languages and i bet if they went to any spanish speakers country and they had accent and people would make fun of them they would know how it feels.
0a14Mg2kaa	No life has ever *originally* formed by evolution.  Evolution does not explain, attempt to explain, or even address how life starts.  Evolution is an explanation for what happens to life that is already there.  As far as species that you can point out in existence today, yes those species have all been formed by evolution.|`|q5rTjkjgaa	yes i believe so |`|uxfacsgmaa	Sounds about right.|`|AA10556726	Yes it did, there is no creditable reason yet to suspect anything else and a massive amount of evidence that supports evolution on this planet.  Until we have evidence otherwise, there is no reason to think that life would have formed on other planets by other means.|`|cNniG2L0aa	ALL life EVERYWHERE is 'formed' by evolution.<br>  There are NO invisible critters under the bed, in the closet, on top of the mountain, up in the sky or any other place it has been fashionable for such entities to dwell.<br>  ~<br>  |`|mSFjbetxaa	No way to answer that because the universe is still too unknown.|`|a781bc434ae321dd9513d859b0eee56baa	All known life has.|`|qEh84eqNaa	Well, technically evolution isn't about how life formed-- just how it branched into species. But going off of the context of your question, I think you are asking if all species formed through evolution, in which case, the answer is yes. Way back when, a little cell of sorts formed. Everything came from that.

Our summers are probably hot as the American summers. Sure its cold here, but not all year around. Americans act as if it doesn't snow in America, is that why Buffalo and other regions get hit with more snow then Toronto and other parts of Ontario? Most of the black people where I live are Jamaican, sure they complain about the cold, but they suck it up. Just like how any other person would. If someone doesn't like the cold then move out.

No offense. <br>  <br>  And yes, a lot of Black people don't like the cold.<br>  It's uncomfortable and frigid.|`|ISJgDUZ5aa	Canada is too cold.

I am asked 'We respect your beliefs, why can you not respect ours?'<br>  <br>  But I do not 'believe' that there is no god. There is no need for belief.

No one living knows how he looks like. A prophet of god and not gods son. How can god (Allah) have a son? See surah al ikhlas. Dear brother. The god having a son concept borrowed from greek mythology. And being born as a man, hindu concept. As said by ahmed deedat. Muslim worldwide believes Jesus pbuh as being born without needing male intervention. His creation, is a test from god to his servant. Thinking servant. And most people dont believe his birth.

Although they all share similar themes (ie: virgin birth, death and resurrection, 12 desiples) it appears that they all can be traced to astrological symbolism (check out Zeitgeist link with this answer).

He became flesh, was born of Virgin birth and lived among us (Immanuel) to reveal the glory of the Father. As a man, He was sinless,  He was the Christ, the anointed one, who died for atonement of our sins and was resurrected by God the Father, according to His plan. <br>  He was ALSO a great teacher, as His charisma was transcending from the glory of God, but most of all, He is LIFE and TRUTH and the only WAY to the Father.<br>  <br>  On earth, Jesus was perfectly human and perfectly divine. In fact, He was hungry, and He multiplied the loaves. He was thristy, and He changed water into wine. He died, and He was resurrected in the glory of the Father. I could go on...

It is beautiful and sunny and the roses which are banked at the sides of the garden by the fences are filling the air with their gorgeous perfume, behind me I can hear voices from the kitchen and scullery windows then from out of the scullery window come the aromas of roast beef and cabbage, then nan's sweet voice rings out 'dinner's ready'.

Since that time, everything is breaking down. Why do you think there was no problems with the inter marrying we have at the beginning of the Bible? They were close enough that there would be NO diseases. The diseases we have now are intended to strengthen our faith in God or to bring someone to faith by you or someone around you. It is a test of your character and your faith.<br>  <br>  God does not give you more than you can bear but He does give you a way out of certain situations that can become unbearable.

fdb2eb2f4c9344e092dc65cdb24a9c1eaa	The reason something like this cannot be grasped is because Christians do not believe this. In fact Christian theists expect atheists to have knowledge of morality because it's "written on their hearts" (Romans 2:14&15).<br>  <br>  The question for the Atheist isn’t how can you be moral, but rather on what basis are you grounding your behavior (or anyone’s behavior for that matter) as moral or immoral? How does the atheist properly ground the existence of objective moral values?|`|2h8tqOeFaa	You have it all wrong, Christians ask atheists where do atheists think morals came from, and atheists believes they just evolved into the human psyche and not set forward by God.. <br>  <br>  So basically atheists believes in morals but they believe they were conjured up by the human psyche, which the human life according to atheists has no meaning because to evolution were just animals and there's no meaning to life, which is a bit of a contradiction..|`|4sUek7ugaa	The standard lie spread in churches is that people only become atheists in order to do whatever they want without consequence.  Therefore, Christians believe that atheists have no morals.<br>  <br>  The real reasons people become atheists are probably too frightening for theists to talk about.|`|AA11124121	how the do i know if you have morals? i don't know you.<br>  <br>  unless, of course, you are generalizing.<br>  <br>  if you're an atheist than don't use God to argue a case for atheism.|`|79529314dfb5ac7be366558924c3393baa	>so if I said "society's standards...laws" in response, would that suffice as a grounding moral viewpoint?<br>  <br>  No. And I'm an atheist.<br>  <br>  >only, instead of morals being sprung from the human psyche, isn't it more logical to assume they are based on the opinions of the masses not the individual?<br>  <br>  Not really. Both make rather little sense. Consider the ancient aztecs: The vast majority of their population believed it was a good, moral thing to sacrifice slaves on temples by cutting out their beating hearts with obsidian knives. Did that make it moral? Hell no. It was a horrible practice, not just in a modern context but even back in their time. Just because they THOUGHT it was okay doesn't mean it actually was okay in any way.<br>  <br>  >Homosexuality is still considered immoral<br>  <br>  Yes, but that doesn't mean it actually IS immoral.

They're not thinking for themselves when they make this statement.  They're taught that their own morality comes from god.  Before Jesus, they were sinful worms, running from depravity to depravity.  Now, with the Holy Spirit in their lives, a kind of invisible Jimminy Cricket, they're able to tell right from wrong.  Since we don't have an invisi-buddy, we're stuck running around in depravity.<br>  <br>  And, just looking at the lives of all the kids in our town that worked SO HARD for years to evangelize my children.

Some in this forum suggest common sense but that is another vague term. Whose common sense are they referring to those in the group that agree with us or those in the group that disagree? Whose common sense is the correct one and by whose authority? And if you believe in subjective morality how can you ever know if you were being moral? Edit to your response about society laws. As much as it is good to obey laws (no need to flaunt the law unnecessarily) we need to realize that laws sometimes  change and I think most in this forum would agree there have been good laws bad laws. A good example is Nazi Germany that adopted laws to suit their hateful view towards the Jews. So again we need a standard to know whether the law is good or bad. Some would argue the point that because other countries practice other morals this is evidence for subjective morality. I would say it is evidence of those who are more or less moral. Again the Nazis serve as a good example. And if we say morality is subjective then we really have no way to know if we are being moral or not in which case being accused of having no morals would be accurate because how could we be moral if at worst morals don't exist or at the very best can never be recognized.|`|pHzRHDOgaa	I'm sorry that this has been your experience.  I do not believe atheists have no morals.<br>  <br>  I believe, as a Christian, that each sane person has a moral standard.  Their standard may be skewed, but there remains some standard nevertheless.  I also believe that with few exceptions, everyone violates their personal moral standard.<br>  <br>  The question of whether all these little personal moral standards have some big overarching standard that they are supposed to match (and if so, what that standard is and where comes from) is the point of contention between Christians and non-Christians.<br>  <br>  You are right, it is a rarity to see that overarching question discussed thoughtfully and kindly.  Even if it is discussed that way, the parties often feel personally attacked.|`|Cld0jeiXaa	Because they have no morals without God's punishment and forgiveness.

A skeptics perspective that Objective (that is existing outside of our perspective) moral values do not exist. That stealing or lying or rape are not wrong in of themselves but have been determined to be so by the clan, society, mankind for the advancement of it seems un retainable to me. That adherants of moral relativism, or ethical subjectivism, when tested, inevitably conceed that some moralities improve and are in fact better than others, thus nulifying their argument, because cross cultural comparisons that indicate moral improvement indicate moral objectivity.<br>  I believe that a significantly stronger argument is that the "law written in our hearts", "natural law" (see Aquinas) guides all human beings regarless of race colour or creed to be drawn "to do good and avoid evil". Why else would anyone (and I believe all are) be drawn to accept basic fundamental human rights, if they did not actually believe they exist, and they only can, if justice and objective moral values actually do. I believe this to be a significant indicator that we may actually indeed be "created in the image and likeness of God". I think the proposition that it is in our nature to know and rationaly choose right from wrong best explains why Theist and atheist alike generally choose to do so.<br>  and I find it fascinating that although both are guided by their nature to do the good, both sometimes fail to act in accordance with it. Natural Law can only be felt, not shown, or even for that matter observed.|`|o1hyyXw7aa	The prime subject here is morals. One cannot "have" morals. The question is do "objective moral values" exist? If they do, then a Christian cheating on their spouse is an action against morality. Morality exists on it's own, it's not something we each "have". If we each "had" morals, then these morals could vary from one person to the next, which would mean that these are mere opinions or life views, not morals. Instead, moral values just exist, and we all seem to be aware of them.<br>  <br>  I'm a Christian, but I disagree that atheists cannot be good people. Some of the best people I know are atheist. Unfortunately, atheists are stereotyped, just as we Christians are.|`|pGf4mIw9aa	Maybe it's because the Christians that are attacking your moral wish that they had what you had. I am happy with what I have and as long as you are happy with what you have, I have no problem with what you have. Lol. And yes I am a Christian. I believe life is like this. We are all born for a reason, if God exist, guess what, when he is ready to be shown, he will show you himself. That is my belief.|`|AA10641825	where does god get his morals anyway?<br>  <br>  He didn't even know that chopping off a woman's hand is wrong.<br>  deuteronomy 25:12<br>  <br>  Church folks apparently get their morals from the bible god -- but where does he get morals?<br>  .
bRLCxmP6aa	Your mother is trying to maintain the appearance that nothing is wrong - it is how she is trying to cope with something she is obviously having trouble dealing with. <br>  <br>  The facade of cheerfulness, coupled with her refusal to talk about the real issues and her demand that you keep this all a secret, could indicate that she is not really handling this situation at all well, and is deeply ashamed of what is going on or of the reason for her break with your father. She may feel that she won't have to explain or admit anything if she acts like nothing is wrong.<br>  <br>  This may be working for her right now, but it is clearly not working for you - you need to talk to someone about this, even though your mother told you to keep it a secret. She may have the right to decide not to deal with her issues, but she does not have the right to insist that you aren't allowed to deal with yours - and your issues are not the same as hers. <br>  <br>  Talk to your boyfriend first, since he is likely to be sympathetic and easy to talk to - tell him as much as you know about what is going on and let him know what you're feeling. Then, talk to a counselor at school - and urge your brother to do the same. In talking with a counselor, you don't have to focus on the issue between your parents, whatever that may be...you just need to focus on the effect your situation has on your lives and on how you two can deal with it in a healthy way. You are both dealing with the fallout of a situation over which you have no control and you are not being given any insight into the issues affecting your lives. You can't fix or change the original problem - but you can get help to deal with the emotional aftermath. <br>  <br>  Good luck to you.|`|RoqxGbgRaa	first, every family has a culture.  some families are brutally honest, some even to the point of being unnecessarily cruel and hurtful.  some others prefer to look the other way when trouble appears, pretending that certain realities don't exist at all, not even privately.  <br>  <br>  some will acknowledge truths only when the principals involved are absent.  people will smile and act completely ignorant of difficult or uncomfortable situations, knowing they have hashed out every detail in pairs and small groups, and kept the phone wires buzzing all night.<br>  <br>  it's obvious that your mom is a product of her family's culture.  she has learned all her life to hide her pain behind bright smiles.  people learn to do this for fear of being judged.  they're being judged anyway, but the goal is to do as little as possible to feed the fire.  she may feel that by being fake, she's helping to squash the gossip and move you guys past this set of awful circumstances.  the truth, however, is that she's causing you and your brother to feel disconnected from your own lives, and to be the butt of sympathy looks and backroom gossip.  <br>  <br>  she's not wrong per se, but the way that she is handling it is causing the family more pain than if she had faced this head on, sat down with you and your brother and said, "look, guys.  i've had to make a really hard decision.  it's breaking my heart, and yours, too, i'm sure.  i've decided that dad needs to be away from us right now while he figures some things out.  i still love dad, but i have to do what's best for the entire family."  <br>  <br>  this honesty would have been a whole lot better, and would have helped you to withstand the gossip you know is going on behind your back.  it would also have helped you to feel united with your mom and have confidence that your family would make it through this together.<br>  <br>  unfortunately, families--although they are great blessings--have a tendency to do just the opposite of what we need them to do.  it's a hard pill to swallow, but keep making your way day by day.  <br>  <br>  some days you will feel angry, and lost, and hurt beyond all reason.  cry when you need to, but don't give up.  there's always a light at the end of the tunnel.|`|iTEf1dP3aa	Whoa is me....|`|28d6b247dbaac5aea6f4f1980e00962baa	I don't think that your mother is to blame here for making your "childhood a weird and unhappy situation" -- really, it sounds like the situation is no one's fault.  Here is the thing:  you're a kid.  Your mom is a parent. She is trying to make your homelife as stable as possible for you.  She is trying to put the best spin possible on your life:  that everything is OK.  Sure, you know it's not.  Everyone knows that it's not.  But she's trying to be as strong as she can for you and your brother.  Sometimes, faking smiles is all a girl's got.  <br>  <br>  Now, as for no one talking to you again... this is mostly the adults in your family trying to shelter you from the fall-out from your dad's relationship (or lack thereof) with your mom.  This has nothing to do with you -- other than, you feel that you are being neglected or left out of the adult conversations regarding their relationship.  What is it that you want to talk about?  Communication is a two-way street:  try reaching out to people.  Try to listen to them, not just hearing them talk "at" you and try to communicate with them your feelings and thoughts on things.  Tell your mom that you need to talk with someone and that your school counselor would be a good person to start with.  Your mom is just being proud and not wanting to share her personal problems with the world -- but when they negatively impact her kids (you and your brother) you could use some supportive communciation.  Talk to your school counselor.  Good luck.|`|I6dcRgD6aa	You have a right to speak about your Dad & if you like & trust your counselor you should tell him/her. Your mother is trying to protect you all but you want to live an authentic life.

Yet, it wouldn't help the situation any if she was weepy and looking for pity either.  Sometimes, by remaining cheerful we can make our own lives less gloomy.  Perhaps Dad was abusing a substance like alcohol, or has some addiction problem, or mental health issues.  Mom doesn't feel comfortable airing the dirty family linens.  You can't do much except be patient until they resolve their differences and his problem.  He is an adult and needs to seek help if he wants help.|`|4D2ZRK6naa	you got to realize all adults have problems. if your mother seems to be happy let her.as for your feelings you have a right to feel the way you. you  do. u should except the way your mother is thier problems shouldnt be your. im pretty sure your mom has her reason for not being with your dad. if he looks like hes mentally disturb then maube he is you let him deal with his own problems if hes willing on working on them. love both of your parents is all you can do. dont worry about anyone that talks about .there will always be people talking to make others miserable. if i had to let talk get to me id be miserable. thier theorys about you are useless.this world is not perfect but its a world that we have smart choices to make life is what you make of it and dont forget it. about sharing your feeling with someone you can count on me i will always be considerate to yr questions consider me a new friend southwestexpressionsphotography@yahoo.co...  yes yr boyfriend you can share yr problems with hes a friend and you need someone to talk to when times get tough. as for a counsler umm i dont think you need one at this time.as for the cat it wont be the end of the world youll grow up and you can have as many as you want .you got to remember your mom is the one to make those kind of decisions dont worry. i have twin boys yr age.your mom wrks hard for you n yr family can you give her credit and try to coopperate with her. she truly deserve its. the breakup yr parents had will bother you just dont let it get the best out of you just understand that something dont last forever if it wasnt meant to be let it live laugh and love. i know things can be a bit confusing but its not the end of the world. love yourself dont torture yourself over other people mistake. your soo young take advantage of the beautiful things in life that you can be enjoying. keep GOD in yr life for thats the only way through the struugles. everyone has them. GOD BLESS YOU>|`|5DImoOlyaa	first of all : im really sorry about what happened to you.<br>  even though you went through all of this you and your mother could still find some happiness out all this.<br>  maybe your mother smiles because she tries to make the best of  her life.<br>  you should try to listen to your mom and do better in school because she's trying to make the best of life for you and your brother.<br>  <br>  i hope this helps!<br>  <br>  :)|`|61vyo2PAaa	oh sweety that definitely isn't right.<br>  Bring your father on therapist if he has psychological problems.All of you should help him first .There are medications that a doctor can prescribe.Tell your mother it isn't human to kick someone who has problems and to make him homeless :(<br>  Make him go to therapist>|`|zJUXsRlGaa	It sounds like you need to have a heart-to-heart talk with your mother, gently, and ask her how she feels, and tell her how you feel. I expect you all feel upset and guilty knowing that your father is not coping with life, and it must make you sad. <br>  <br>  Maybe she laughs and smiles to hide her feelings of unhappiness.  <br>  <br>  But it is also possible that if she has been in a tense and unhappy relationship for a long time, then she actually does feel happier now, and relieved she doesn't have to deal with the problems with your father. <br>  <br>  Maybe she is trying not to draw you into the details of the dispute between them, because she feels that would be wrong and might force you into taking sides, when really it is just that two unhappy people could no longer live together, and there were no rights or wrongs.<br>  <br>  With regard to the kitten:<br>  <br>   just think about it:  you said you are mostly round at your boyfriend's house.  So who would have to care for the kitten when you are with your boyfriend?  Your mother works so hard she must be exhausted when she comes home, and it is unfair of you to just expect her to look after a pet on top of her other responsibilities.  A kitten needs a lot of care and attention, and there is also the expense of cat food, visits to the vet, worming, cat flu injections, flea treatments, cat paraphernalia such as a carrying basket for vet visits, bowls, scratching posts, litter tray, etc. and possibly pet insurance.  Then it needs to be house-trained, and even if you keep and eye on it most of the time, kittens still do lots of damage, like knocking over pot plants and ornaments, stealing food, shedding hairs over all the surfaces, and so on, and they wake you up, and are demanding when you want to sleep or ignore them.  <br>  <br>  Don't get me wrong, I love cats and have adopted a wild kitten who is now 10 months old.  But they are a handful. It sounds as though you brought it home without even asking your mother's consent first. At the very least that was impolite. And to expect her to take on the extra financial burden when she is working her guts out to support her family, without even asking her, is very cheeky and, might I say, a bit inconsiderate. No wonder she was cross with you. <br>  <br>  A cat is not just a toy, to be given as a present by a loving boyfriend.  It is a living creature which will need to be looked after for about FOURTEEN  years.  If your boyfriend wants you to have a cat, I suggest he keeps it at his house!  What if you want to go to college, or to travel - who will have the cat then?  What if you want to leave home and have your own flat - will your new landlord want a cat living there? Who will look after the cat whilst you are out?  Cats like company, and if you go out to work, and then want to go out socializing afterwards, the cat would be on its own for about 18 or more hours a day. <br>  <br>  Re Your Additional Details:<br>  <br>  Maybe your mother hasn't met anyone nice, Perhaps she is worried that if she brings another man into the family it will be difficult for you children - getting on with step-parents is a bit of a gamble - sometimes the relationship is good, and sometimes it causes problems, so maybe she wants to avoid all that until you are grown up. I doubt very much whether people are gossiping a lot about your family situation - it is not all that unusual. And if they do gossip, so what?  Just learn to ignore it, and accept what you can't change, and try not to let every little thing get to you.  If your family don't talk to you, You could try talking to them - maybe they feel you are very reserved and they don't know what to say to you. Tell them about things that happened, things you've seen and heard or thought about, ask them about their lives, and how they are, and what they think about things and see if you can get everyone involved and talking.  It will become easier as you get older and more experienced with dealing with people.

mCQZrp1zaa	There are many ways that marriage can do this. <br>  <br>  First, there is the legal aspect, even more pronounced in community property states. It's similar in some respects to forming a corporation.<br>  <br>  Then there is the emotional aspect. I know many people claim they don't need a piece of paper to ratify their relationship, but as a practical matter, the legal commitment to each other does indeed tie up a couple more into a "one".<br>  <br>  For those who have any form of spiritual belief system, there is the religious aspect as well, as they will view their vows as being taken in front of God, and a commitment to both each other and their supreme being.<br>  <br>  Then there is the sexual side. I know most couples don't wait till they are married before making it, but sex can (and hopefully does) become an even more fulfilling experience for the couple who has married. Sadly, that's not often the case, but in an ideal world it would be.|`|AfnQ95Z5aa	That's a biblical reference and therefore a theological/religious idea.<br>  <br>  The law can only recognize legal issues, such as rights, entitlement, responsibility, etc...|`|0ac02757252bf3673e5594f1927600faaa	one in purpose and ideal and it is another way to prove that Jesus and God are not the same person, just One in Purpose|`|lJUyhMceaa	I'm not sure I completely understand your question, but i'll try.<br>  <br>  According to Scripture, when a man and a woman come together (sexually), they become "one".  We know this is not in a physical sense so it must be in a spiritual since.<br>  <br>  Psychology studies have found that when to people come together in a sexual way, there is a bond that is much stronger then in just casual relations.  The studies show that in a "one time" sexual relationship, the two peoples bond together in spirit.  In other words, their spirits unit.  When the relationship is extended, there souls even bond.  This is where we get the term "soul mates".<br>  <br>  1Co 6:16  What? know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body? for two, saith he, shall be one flesh.<br>  <br>  The word "body" is used in other places to mean "soul"  or even "spirit" in some spots.  The word "Joined" does not mean marriage, but litterally referrs to the sexual relationship.<br>  <br>  In the Biblical days, a couple was considered married only after they came together in a sexual manner.  <br>  <br>  So, in marriage (after the sexual part), the two become one in spirit, and in soul.  This is not to be broken, and in fact, can not be broken.<br>  <br>  Ask anyone who has had a divorce, and, even if it was a bad marriage and a ruff divorce, they will tell you that there is a part of the other person that will always be with them.  This is the soul and spirit. Once joined it can never be totally broken.<br>  <br>  This is another reason why people who have had numerous sexual relations, tend to have many psycological problems.  Their spirit is literally being torn apart.<br>  <br>  I hope that answered your question.|`|JqzCRh1paa	it has been this way since the begining....Man and Woman are talked About in the Bible ...it says in fact in the Bible ..that a woman should not speak in the in the Church but should ask questions from there husbands when they are home.<br>  <br>  corinthians 1<br>  <br>  Context<br>  14:33 for God is not characterized by disorder but by peace.<br>  <br>  As in all the churches of the saints, 1  14:34 the women 2  should be silent in the churches, for they are not permitted to speak. 3  Rather, let them be in submission, as in fact the law says. 14:35 If they want to find out about something, they should ask their husbands at home, because it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in church. 4  14:36 Did the word of God begin with you, 5  or did it come to you alone?|`|gpON465Iaa	A partnership with God.|`|AA11124121	the next time you go to a wedding..open yer ears.|`|j5YwuVEIaa	God’s Original Standard<br>  To understand God’s standard for marriage, we have to go back to the beginning of human history. God’s Word describes the attraction Adam felt on being introduced to his one newly created wife, Eve. “This is at last bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh,” he said. “That is why,” the Bible continues, “a man will leave his father and his mother and he must stick to his wife and they must become one flesh.”—Genesis 2:21-24.<br>  For Christian marriages, Jesus restored God’s original standard—monogamy. (Matthew 19:4,?5) Furthermore, he showed that married people should now adhere to this divine criterion. As he explained: “They are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore, what God has yoked together let no man put apart.” (Matthew 19:6) Thus, a married Christian must protect the “one flesh” bond that exists between him and his legal mate. Sexual intercourse with a polygamous third party would desecrate that divine arrangement. Such an act is forbidden in the Christian congregation.—1?Corinthians 5:11; 6:9,?16,?18; Hebrews 13:4.|`|ZzPQjXuaaa	Can people make an easy response to this question?<br>  <br>  Its the legal bonding of two individual, your finances, assets, family.<br>  <br>  In the Bible, its means the bonding of two individuals in the eyes of God.|`|Znw52fxkaa	There is another definition of MARRY beyond that of people.<br>  <br>  "To unite in a close, usually permanent way"<br>  <br>  So that I'd say pretty much sums up marriage of people also...|`|cyt7oh97aa	Marriage doesn't do the recognizing, many Christians and other religions only recognize a marriage between one man and one woman.

I know I'll never marry and I much prefer living on my own, but I would hate to die alone, that's the worst thing in the world.<br>  I agree in principle that there's a soul-mate for everyone but I wouldn't want to find mine.<br>  <br>  As an edit:  I'm reminded of something an old (literally) friend of mine, who enjoys living alone, once told me.  She said she never feels more lonely than when she's at family gatherings because she's usually the only single person there.  <br>  I suppose loneliness has a variety of individual meanings.|`|BhhD5abIaa	Old age=Wisdom<br>  Wisdom=solitude<br>  <br>  Wisdom+Solitude=Soulmate. <br>  <br>  You are your own soulmate. <br>  <br>  Nah.

They wil be able to answer you. I dare not assume. I am not wise enough, nor alone. <br>  <br>  One thing is for sure: people are never alone. That's the basis of human existence. Being completely alone will cause one to lose all hope... and for the fragile ancient old people, they might pass away soon if they are completely alone and tending to their own sore backs and jointes. <br>  <br>  So, I agree with your assumption that there's a SOULMATE out there for everyone.

Every building has a builder. Everything made has a maker. The fact of the existence of the Creator is axiomatic (self-evident). That’s why the Bible says, "The fool has said in his heart, ‘There is no God’" (Psalm 14:1). The professing atheist denies the common sense given to him by God, and defends his belief by thinking that the question "Who made God?" can’t be answered. This, he thinks, gives him license to deny the existence of God.<br>  <br>  The question of who made God can be answered by simply looking at space and asking, "Does space have an end?" Obviously, it doesn’t. If there is a brick wall with "The End" written on it, the question arises, "What is behind the brick wall?" Strain the mind though it may, we have to believe (have faith) that space has no beginning and no end. The same applies with God. He has no beginning and no end. He is eternal.<br>  <br>  The Bible also informs us that time is a dimension that God created, into which man was subjected. It even tells us that one day time will no longer exist. That will be called "eternity." God Himself dwells outside of the dimension He created (2 Timothy 1:9, Titus 1:2). He dwells in eternity and is not subject to time. God spoke history before it came into being. He can move through time as a man flips through a history book.<br>  <br>  Because we live in the dimension of time, logic and reason demand that everything must have a beginning and an end. We can understand the concept of God’s eternal nature the same way we understand the concept of space having no beginning and end—by faith. We simply have to believe they are so, even though such thoughts put a strain on our distinctly insufficient cerebrums.|`|iHDYncuXaa	What is the proof that you exist?

He asks one of his new students to stand and….. <br>  <br>  Prof: So you believe in God? <br>  Student: Absolutely, sir. <br>  <br>  Prof: Is God good? <br>  Student: Sure. <br>  <br>  Prof: Is God all-powerful? <br>  Student: Yes. <br>  <br>  Prof: My brother died of cancer even though he prayed to God to heal him. Most of us would attempt to help others who are ill. But God didn’t. How is this God good then? Hmm? <br>  Student is silent.<br>  <br>  Prof: You can’t answer, can you?<br>  Let’s start again, young fellow. Is God good? <br>  Student: Yes. <br>  <br>  Prof: Is Satan good? <br>  Student: No. <br>  <br>  Prof: Where does Satan come from? <br>  Student: From…God… <br>  <br>  Prof: That’s right. Tell me son, is there evil in this world? <br>  Student: Yes. <br>  <br>  Prof: Evil is everywhere, isn’t it? And God did make everything. Correct? <br>  Student: Yes. <br>  Prof: Is there sickness? Immorality? Hatred? Ugliness? All these terrible things exist in the world, don’t they? <br>  Student: Yes, sir. <br>  <br>  Prof: So, who created them? <br>  Student has no answer. <br>  <br>  Prof: Science says you have 5 senses you use to identify and observe the world around you. Tell me, son…Have you ever seen God? <br>  Student: No, sir. <br>  <br>  Prof: Tell us if you have ever heard your God? <br>  Student: No, sir. <br>  <br>  Prof: Have you ever felt your God, tasted your God, smelt your God? Have you ever had any sensory perception of God for that matter? <br>  Student: No, sir. I’m afraid I haven’t. <br>  <br>  Prof: Yet you still believe in Him? <br>  Student: Yes. <br>  <br>  Prof: According to empirical, testable, demonstrable protocol, science says your GOD doesn’t exist. What do you say to that, son? <br>  Student: Nothing. I only have my faith. <br>  <br>  Prof: Yes Faith. And that is the problem science has. <br>  Now the student said can I ask something to you Professor.<br>  <br>  Student: Professor, is there such a thing as heat? <br>  Prof: Yes.<br>  <br>  Student : And is there such a thing as cold? <br>  Prof: Yes.<br>  <br>  Student: No sir. There isn’t.<br>  <br>  (The lecture theatre becomes very quiet with this turn of events.) <br>  <br>  Student: Sir, you can have lots of hea t, even more heat, superheat, mega heat, white heat, a little heat or no heat. But we don’t have anything called cold. We can hit 458 degrees below zero which is no heat, but we can’t go any further after that. There is no such thing as cold. Cold is only a word we use to describe the absence of heat. We cannot measure cold. Heat is energy. Cold is not the opposite of heat, sir, just the absence of it. <br>  (There is pin-drop silence in the lecture theatre.)<br>  <br>  Student: What about darkness, Professor? Is there such a thing as darkness? <br>  Prof: Yes. What is night if there isn’t darkness? <br>  <br>  Student: You’re wrong again, sir. Darkness is the absence of something.<br>  You can have low light, normal light, bright light, flashing light… But if you have no light constantly, you have nothing and its called darkness, isn’t it? In reality, darkness isn’t. If it were you would be able to make darkness darker, wouldn’t you? <br>  Prof: So what is the point you are making, young man? <br>  <br>  St udent: Sir, my point is your philosophical premise is flawed. <br>  Prof: Flawed? Can you explain how? <br>  <br>  Student: Sir, you are working on the premise of duality. You argue there is life and then there is death, a good God and a bad God. You are viewing the concept of God as something finite, something we can measure. Sir, science can’t even explain a thought. It uses electricity and magnetism, but has never seen, much less fully understood either one. To view death as the opposite of life is to be ignorant of the fact that death cannot exist as a substantive thing. Deat h is not the opposite of life: just the absence of it. Now tell me, Professor. Do you teach your students that they evolved from a monkey? <br>  <br>  Prof: If you are referring to the natural evolutionary process, yes, of course, I do.<br>  <br>  <br>  Student: Have you ever observed evolution with your own eyes, sir? <br>  <br>  (The Professor shakes his head with a smile, beginning to realize where the argument is going.) <br>  <br>  Student: Since no one has ever observed the process of evolution at work and cannot even prove that this process is an on-going endeavor, are you not teaching your opinion, sir? Are you not a scientist but a preacher? <br>  <br>  (The class is in uproar.)<br>  <br>  Student: Is there anyone in the class who has ever seen the Professor’s brain? <br>  <br>  (The cla ss breaks out into laughter.)<br>  <br>  Student: Is there anyone here who has ever heard the Professor’s brain, felt it, touched or smelt it? No one appears to have done so. So, according to the established rules of empirical, stable, demonstrable protocol, science says that you have no brain, sir. With all due respect, sir, how do we then trust your lectures, sir? <br>  <br>  (The room is silent. The professor stares at the student, his face unfathomable.) <br>  <br>  Prof: I guess you’ll have to take them on faith, son. <br>  Student: That is it sir… The link between man & god is FAITH. That is all that keeps thing|`|gOwakeM1aa	He gave us His words of life The Holy Bible.<br>  <br>   An unbelieving mocker might say that is not proof, but that is why he is not saved because he does not know the true God of the Bible.<br>  <br>  May you come to know this wonderul God while there is still time.|`|qiNr0AqJaa	It is here:<br>  <a href="http://www.everystudent.com/features/isthere.html?gclid=CNDolM39rpgCFQxKGgodFy3_Ug" rel="nofollow">http://www.everystudent.com/features/ist...</a>|`|9jo37B3saa	What is the proof that God doesn't exist?<br>  <br>  Its not that man created God.

AA11412999	I'm already married to a swinger and am one myself, so it doesn't really apply.<br>  <br>  But if I were single again and knew then what I know now about the swinging lifestyle, whether or not they were into it would indeed have some bearing on my opinion of them.  The most important telltale factor would be knowing whether or not they were successful at it.  It takes a well-rounded, well-balanced individual to do this sort of thing successfully.  What you're talking about is a single male who plays in the lifestyle.  To date, my husband and I have not yet found a well-balanced, well-rounded single male who was into swinging for the right reasons with whom I had any real sexual chemistry.  If I was single myself and looking and found such a guy - with whom I had serious sexual chemistry and a "connection" - the fact that he could hold his own in the swingers community says something about his character...something very good, actually.  A husband who "allows" his wife the freedom to have other sex partners is going to be hypervigilant about her safety and any gents who want to get into her panties will have to get past his scrutinous glare first.  BSing a swinger husband is virtually impossible; the man is putting the most precious thing he has - his relationship with his wife - on the line out of love for her liberty.  The single guy has nothing to lose...except some body parts if he tries being disrespectful.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, if he's like the other 99.5% of single male swingers out there (at least the proportion has seemed that high to us!), he's clueless about relationships, their value, and the meaning of commitment.  Like I said, swingers, both men and women, become very adept at picking up subtle cues about people.<br>  <br>  So I'd say that the fact that someone was in the lifestyle would be, for me, a tool I'd use to judge him by, but not just for the simple fact that he was in it.  HOW and WHY he was involved is much more telling.<br>  <br>  Merry Christmas!|`|3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	Oh yeah, that would be intelligent.

If we keep throwing money into the abyss, it will cease to have any meaning. <br>  If we fail, government as we know it will cease, the banks will shut down, corporate America will move to other countries or garner a government that supports their agenda's.

The Great Depression followed - and probably was caused by - a period of excess and extravagance called the Roaring 20s, when people bought stocks with money they didn't have and lived like there was no tomorrow.

Thus, in a democracy, social support has to be implemented according to the conditions in that nation, thus, socialism as some call it, has to be put in place when the free market fails, or corrupts, which happened in the U.S. <br>  <br>  Our youth in America want everything done by texting, and the free market mentality cares no longer about human rights, only "the bottom line" which again, failed Americans. The Federal Reserve is not a U.S. government agency yet it has the ability (??) to set the prime rate to keep U.S. banks under their control, and really screwed things up the past 8 years, with no administration over-sight. Hence, we needed a strong president but didn't have one, so here we are. <br>  <br>  With the hedge fund robbers, and no SEC controls, and Wall Street forcing prices on everyone and everything (those people all work on commission so why would we trust them if "Wall Street" didn't want to invest in them, either?), and the mortgage companies opening up on every corner with churches, and selling bundles of loans to larger finanical groups to make more profits, which in turn re-sold the same loans, over and over again across the world (with other nations thinking surely the US had controls in place but we did not!), and every one of those "sales" had a commission at both ends, guess what the value of each original loan was . . . ? So you see why it's wrong to blame the victims - homeowners, etc. health care users, etc.???? <br>  <br>  It will take a strong president time to clean up America, and get rid of those who watched this happening from their seats in "DC." <br>  <br>  Support our president.

There could be something they don't know or didn't tell me. <br>  <br>  I don't even know what the stereotypes are for me but I'm sure that I have a touch of all of them.  Who cares ?  I had to look this up because, I just wasn't sure.  I'd like to know what your answer is to stereotypes of the white woman in the  USA. Anyway, this is what I looked up & got. <br>  <br>  <br>  White American stereotypes<br>    (January 2009)<br>  <br>  Especially in European countries, Americans are stereotyped as<br>  <br>   brash, ignorant, self-important, unintelligent, decadent, prudish on sexual matters, and obese. <br>  <br>  The image of the obese American could be due to perception of the American diet, such as the popularity and global spread of American fast food franchises such as McDonald's, Burger King, KFC, which has fueled America's obesity crisis.<br>  <br>  Another popular American stereotype is the cowboy, the overconfident cigar chomping business man (see for instance Tintin in America, where both stereotypes are present) and the ignorant tourist couple who has no interest or respect for authentic culture (see for instance the American tourist couples depicted in the Fawlty Towers episode "Waldorf Salad", Monty Python's Meaning of Life and Flushed Away). <br>  <br>  After World War II the countries who were freed from their oppressors were very positive about the US and gladly embraced American products like Coca Cola, chewing gum and Hollywood films. This international positive American image changed drastically during the 1960s and 1970s at the height of the Vietnam War. <br>  <br>  Since then Americans are seen globally in a more negative light as arrogant, gung-ho, ruthless, imperialistic, capitalistic warmongers and destroyers of authentic international cultures and the natural environment. <br>  <br>  This negative stereotypical image has remained intact over the years, also due to negative foreign news or documentary reports that often show Americans who are either <br>  <br>  racist, obese, supporters of wars in foreign countries, gun crazy, obsessed with God and Jesus, reacting against sex or nudity in the media and extremely paranoid of terrorist attacks. <br>  <br>  In recent years, some stereotypes of whites living in the rural Western United States have emerged. Although these stereotypes show some similarities with southern redneck stereotypes, they are unique, usually revolving around cowboy culture, survival-ism, or Mormonism. One stereotype is the shotgun-toting, antisocial, fundamentalist conspiracy theorist who lives in a wooden shack and fears outsiders.  ( like the Uni Bomber ? )  He is typically waiting and preparing for some sort of apocalyptic event involving the Antichrist and/or a government that attempts to dismantle the constitution. This stereotype is likely the result of various incidents during the 1990's.<br>  <br>  In the US itself white people from the Southern states are frequently used as comic characters. They are depicted as angry and/or dimwitted rednecks and/or yokels who are ultraconservative, devoutly religious, Ku Klux Klan members, still carry the Confederate Flag around, grab their guns when encountering strangers and speak in a typical slang. Sometimes incest relations between them and their siblings are suggested. Examples of these stereotypes are Cletus Spuckler, The Beverly Hillbillies, several characters in the films Deliverance and O Brother, Where Art Thou? and the Family Guy episode "To Love and Die in Dixie".<br>  <br>  A lot of these American stereotypes are based on American sitcoms where characters like Al Bundy and Archie Bunker are seen as representative for the typical dumb, cultureless white American. There are many other examples throughout the media, but the classic example is Homer Simpson, the obese, lazy and dim-witted middle American from the cartoon, The Simpsons. The show itself parodies many aspects of American life, culture and society<br>  <br>  Wow, that's a lot to take in.  <br>  <br>  Now, for me, the USA Cacausian female,  I am - -<br>  <br>  educated   - Master's, <br>  quiet          - hate loud noisy people and places, <br>  patriotic     - I love my country, <br>  traveled     -enough to appreciate my country<br>  atheist       - so much for the religious fanatic thing<br>  humble      - there is always so much to learn<br>  respectful   -of all religious customs & beliefs<br>  <br>  But I am also - - <br>  <br>  Obese - I fought fat all my life, hypo-thryoid, lost control of my body and had the gastro -by -pass operation and lost 150 pounds.  Some of it has crept back but not because I go to fast foods places or eat junk.  I don't.<br>  <br>  This is a most interesting question but something's  not quite right either.  The word stereotype here is being misused I think.  A real stereotype is anybody who fits the definition of the typical person of that country or race.  Of course, not everybody does but many do, maybe most do.  That's how these 'typi

Because Doomsday is the appointed hour of the world, and in relation to the life of the world one or two thousand years are like one or two minutes in relation to a year. The Hour of Doomsday is not only the appointed hour of mankind that it should be related to it and seen as distant. It is because of this that the Absolutely Wise One conceals Doomsday in His knowledge among the ‘Five Hidden Things.’ It is due to the mystery of this vagueness that every age including the Age of the Bliss, the Age of the Prophet, people have been frightened of the end of the world.

uLYlQMs3aa	Simply follow the rules. If it is a land animal it must have a cloven hoof and chew its cud. If it is a bird it can not eat carrion (dead flesh) or be a bird of prey. If it is in the ocean it must have scales and fins. Pretty simple list actually. And you don't even need a degree to follow it. If you are not sure then google a picture of the animal in question and see if it has the following traits needed to be counted as clean.<br>  <br>  EDIT: I wanted to weigh back in on this topic due in large part to the heavy misinterpretation of God's word that I see. Above me is an answer that I really had to address. I think the name is Faithfully something or other. In this individuals answer they quote two separate scriptures to try to prove the false belief that the clean/ unclean food law was done away with.<br>  So first scripture is from the book of Mark in chapter 7. You can scroll up to read it if you have not already. Read it again. The person is trying to say that Christ is within this scripture saying that anything can be clean and that no food is unclean. Where does Christ say that in that section? Read it again. It’s not there, is it? Why?  Because Christ is not talking about clean/ unclean foods. He is talking about thoughts, actions and deeds. It is what we do and think that makes us unclean. This is the point he is trying to drive home to the Jewish leaders. Food does not make one clean or unclean. Transgression of God’s law does. Read the Chapter again. The whole point is that our actions are our undoing. Food is not covered, other than to say what I have already stated. Food does not change us, Sin changes us.<br>  Second Scripture is 1 Timothy 4:1-5 Here is one that a lot of people get hung up on. This is not talking about food the way we think it is. Look at it again. It plainly states meats. It does not even mention clean and unclean principles. This is a message for us today in our time in this Ladiocean era. This set of verses is talking about false paths. Wicca, Scientology, Catholoscism, Veganism. These and many other false paths are the topic of discussion there.<br>  Next point.<br>  If God or Christ did away with the Law of clean and unclean foods as so many suspect they did, why is it used to illustrate a point to Peter? Look in the book of Acts in Chapter 10. God uses the law that is “done away with” to show Peter that even”unclean” Gentiles can be cleansed and received in Christ if God calls them forth. Now we should by now know that God is not the author of confusion, so why would he use a law that was done away with on the cross? For this took place after Christ had been crucified and risen for the dead. Why would Peter deny the food if it was no longer counted as unclean? Simple. The law was never removed. It was not part of the Mosaic law. It was in force before that. Remember the story of Noah? 2 of every unclean and 7 pair of every clean? Why would God ask Noah to do something like that if Noah was unfamiliar with the Law. After all he died before Moses ever received it. <br>  Anyways, Hope this helps all the rest of you who do not understand your Bibles. <br>  Good Luck!|`|AA12288361	The law contains guidelines.

The God Yahweh is explaining in Leviticus chapter 11 how to identify the clean and unclean creatures we can or cannot eat from His knowledge of the internal digestive systems of these creatures and their effect on the human body if eaten or not. He is teaching us how to identify these creatures from their outward appearance. The clean land animals are "any" species of even toed ruminants, which include many more animals than the few examples God named such as the cow, sheep, goats and deer. The only water creature that Yahweh recommends us eating are any of the species of bony fish that have both fins and scales. The only birds we are allowed to eat are those species of birds that scratch the ground for their food, which includes but not limited to pigeons, chickens, turkeys, doves and quail. The only insects we are allowed to eat are those that have hind legs to make them hop, which includes but is not limited to the grasshopper, cricket and locusts. Once you realize Yahweh is grouping many species of animals together that have the same internal digestive systems you will realize that you have a much bigger selection of clean animals that you can eat than you first thought and that these animals can be found all over the world no matter where you decide to live. Hope I have been some help in making this easier for you.|`|AA11149408	I assume you have read the laws of the old Testament and still do not understand............I also had some questions, especially about fish......<br>  <br>  I used to have a bookmark on such things, but I suggest you google or otherwise search, "kosher foods", "clean foods", "forbidden foods" etc.<br>  <br>  If you are wanting to follow the law rather than grace, go for it.........if it is good enough for the Jewish, it is good enough for obedient Christians.|`|4ea33fec9bff6a9fd9c0e86d64167d2daa	what's written in the bible is not that complicated, you may have to look up a word or two in the dictionary, but what goes into the mouth does not SPIRITUALLY defile a man as long as you ask for the blessing over the food, but that stuff will sure clog your arteries, give you worms and do other things that will KILL you|`|b87de1703c451a059831167ec8643e70aa	Insects are game|`|iRcJwKgcaa	There's no such thing as clean food, since all food contains some forms of bacteria in it.

And they observe many other traditions, such as the washing of cups, pitchers and kettles.[a])<br>  <br>      5So the Pharisees and teachers of the law asked Jesus, "Why don't your disciples live according to the tradition of the elders instead of eating their food with 'unclean' hands?"<br>  <br>      6He replied, "Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you hypocrites; as it is written:<br>     " 'These people honor me with their lips,<br>        but their hearts are far from me.<br>      7They worship me in vain;<br>        their teachings are but rules taught by men.'[b] 8You have let go of the commands of God and are holding on to the traditions of men."<br>  <br>      9And he said to them: "You have a fine way of setting aside the commands of God in order to observe[c] your own traditions! 10For Moses said, 'Honor your father and your mother,'[d] and, 'Anyone who curses his father or mother must be put to death.'[e] 11But you say that if a man says to his father or mother: 'Whatever help you might otherwise have received from me is Corban' (that is, a gift devoted to God), 12then you no longer let him do anything for his father or mother. 13Thus you nullify the word of God by your tradition that you have handed down. And you do many things like that."<br>  <br>      14Again Jesus called the crowd to him and said, "Listen to me, everyone, and understand this. 15Nothing outside a man can make him 'unclean' by going into him. Rather, it is what comes out of a man that makes him 'unclean.' "[f]<br>  <br>      17After he had left the crowd and entered the house, his disciples asked him about this parable. 18"Are you so dull?" he asked. "Don't you see that nothing that enters a man from the outside can make him 'unclean'? 19For it doesn't go into his heart but into his stomach, and then out of his body." (In saying this, Jesus declared all foods "clean.")<br>  <br>      20He went on: "What comes out of a man is what makes him 'unclean.' 21For from within, out of men's hearts, come evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery, 22greed, malice, deceit, lewdness, envy, slander, arrogance and folly. 23All these evils come from inside and make a man 'unclean.'

If you were to believe your own Qu'ran the Bible is the unchanged word of God. This should present you with a major pause.<br>  Consider first that the Qu'ran first written 650 or so AD<br>  Calls the Gospel the Injill " Good News"<br>  What is the good news? The Good News is and always was and always will be the atonement of Jesus Christ.<br>  The Qu'ran refers to Christ himself as the "Good News" a word from God.<br>  Let's suppose for a moment that Muhammad did not invent the Qu'ran and that the Qu'ran was indeed further instruction for the true God of Abraham.<br>  In the year 650 Why did God not know the meaning of the good news? Why was God mistaken about the trinity and the teachings of Jesus Christ?<br>  Now I am not asking if Allah deems the trinity wrong but why does he mistakenly refer to the trinity as more than one God?<br>  When the docrine of the trinity is one God.<br>  Why would God who knows all things not know that the Gospel refered to Christ as the word and the word was God?<br>  If God knew this in 600 AD why did he not so much as mention this when referring to the Gospel as the good news and Christ as a word from God?<br>  I am astounded and how unknowing Allah could be?<br>  Where is this mystery Gospel that the Qu'ran says is guidence and light that I should follow?<br>  Where is this Word of God that Gabriel is telling Muhammad if he has doubts about his revelation he should check with those who read previous scrioptures?<br>  If Muhammad was a prophet of God how is he tested if the word of God is corrupt?<br>  What God did Muhammad follow before he received revealtion from a spirit he throught was a demon?<br>  How did Muhamamd know the spirit was not a demon?<br>  How could God's people test Muhammad with the word of God and the words of the prophets if these words of God are corrupt?<br>  If Allah could not keep his word for four thousand years how is it he can now keep his word?<br>  <br>  What of the people that were fooled by Allah to thinking Christ atoned for sin?<br>  There were 600 years between the crucifixion of Christ and the Qu'ran.<br>  Many people were born and died believing in a hoax Allah claims he created?<br>  Why is The righteous God of Abraham suddenly not a righteous God but now agrees with the serpent in the garden?<br>  How is the corrupt God the righteous God and this Allah the real God?<br>  How is Allah the most merciful and the most righteous when he is not as merciful or as righteous as the God you call corrupt?<br>  How is it you say you believe Jesus Christ but Jesus said if you don't believe the words of Moses then you cant believe his words?<br>  How is Muhammad a prophet of God and he did not agree with God nor the prophets of God when all prophets are required to be in agreement with God's words and the prophets of God?<br>  The truth is if the word of God was corrupt there could no longer be prophets.<br>  God in order to be fair would have to speak audibly to people because he could not prevent his written word from becoming corrupt and his written word could not be trusted.<br>  The whole idea of Islam is based on an imperfect god who could not or would not keep his word and can not with any common sense be trusted.<br>  <br>  Is Muhammad a prophet of God and his Qu'ran the word of God?<br>  According to the Qu'ran Muhammad is a prophet of God and meets with the angel Gabriel and receives revelation from him. The god Allah is supposed to be the God of Abraham.<br>  Can any of this be true?<br>  The God of Abraham has directed his people to test a spirit and a prophet of God to be sure they were not false prophets.<br>  Did Muhammad test this spirit to be sure it was from God? <br>  According to the Qu'ran Muhammad was instructed by Gabriel that if he had any doubts about this revelation he should speak with those who read previous scriptures.<br>  This would surely mean that the scriptures from God agree with the Qu'ran at this time of Muhammad.<br>  The Bible says they absolutely have to be in agreement with the word of God and the previous prophets of God.<br>  <br>  Now let's see what Muhammad would have found had he had done as instructed both by God and by this unproved spirit.<br>  <br>  Deut.13: 1 If there arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, and giveth thee a sign or a wonder, <br>  2 And the sign or the wonder come to pass, whereof he spake unto thee, saying, Let us go after other gods, which thou hast not known, and let us serve them; <br>  3 Thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams: for the LORD your God proveth you, to know whether ye love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul. <br>  <br>  A prophet of God must be in agreement with the words of the prophets and the known word of God.<br>  <br>  1John 2: 22 Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son. <br>  23 Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father: [but] he that acknowledgeth the Son hath the Father also. <br>  24 Let that therefore abide in you, which ye have heard from the beginning. If that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you, ye also shall continue in the Son, and in the Father. <br>  <br>  1John 4:1 Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world. <br>  2 Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God: <br>  3 And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world. <br>  4 Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world. <br>  5 They are of the world: therefore speak they of the world, and the world heareth them. <br>  6 We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he that is not of God heareth not us. Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error. <br>  7 Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God. <br>  8 He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love. <br>  9 In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him. <br>  10 Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins. <br>  11 Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another. <br>  12 No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us. <br>  13 Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit. <br>  14 And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world. <br>  15 Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God. <br>  <br>  Anyone who claims to be a prophet of God must agree Jesus is the Christ the Son of God who is our Savior.<br>  <br>  2 John 1:7 For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist<br>  <br>  Gal. 1: 8 But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed. <br>  <br>  If an angel or a man preach a different gospel he is not of God.<br>  <br>  We can see here that the supposed imposter spirit Gabriel contrary to what he siad was not a spirit from God and the revelation he was sharing was not in agreement with the word of God.<br>  <br>  We can also see by these scriptures Muhammad was not in agreement with the previous word of God nor the prophets and could not be a prophet of God.<br>  <br>  Should I continue?<br>  <br>  What would be Islam's answer to such a glaring problem?<br>  You and I both know the answer to this question.<br>  Islam contradicts the Qu'ran and calls the word of God corrupt.<br>  <br>  If this were true and it is impossible you have a myriad of problems.<br>  <br>  1) How to test a prophet or a spirit with corrupt scriptures.<br>  Not only Muhamamd could be a prophet but so could anyone in the world simply write yourself a book and call the word of God garbage.<br>  2)The Qu'ran itself says the word of God can't be changed and that the Qu'ran is a continuation of these previous scriptures and advises Muhammad to check with those who read previous scriptures.<br>  Muhamamd even according to the Qu'ran could not be a prophet of God nor the Qu'ran the word of God.<br>  3) Could Allah be the God of Abraham as he claims?<br>  Is Allah in agreement with the righteousness of God?<br>  From the beginning of the Torah, God warns Adam to eat of the tree of knowledge of good and evil or he will surely die.<br>  Satan, called the serpent, lies and tells Eve you will not surely die.<br>  God does not weigh sin. The wages of sin is death from the beginning of the word of God to the end of his written word.<br>  God could not change his mind and agree with Satan.<br>  It is the reason man needs Jesus and the reason the Son became flesh.<br>  What was the first lie Satan gave to man? You will not surely die. God is not a righteous God and you can make another deal<br>  My Muslim friend Satan is again telling the original lie.<br>  Sin does equal death there are no lessers sins and God does not weigh sin and you can't earn salvation.<br>  Salvation is a free gift no man can require it from God.<br>  <br>  God is a righteous God and he will not be joined to sin.<br>  God has provided a way for his people to be rejoined to him for eternal life and this is through the Son who became flesh.<br>  <br>  The Son became flesh because sin does equal |`|D9lMg7A2aa	Wish you weren't a coward and would address this from your view...but you won't. It DOES affect the answer people will give. You realize that I hope.<br>  <br>  First of all, they can't both be right. Many, many places. You are probably most familiar with St Paul's admonition in Galatians so I'll use that one :<br>  <br>  "But there are some who are disturbing you and wish to pervert the gospel of Christ. <br>  8 <br>  But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach (to you) a gospel other than the one that we preached to you, let that one be accursed! <br>  9 <br>  As we have said before, and now I say again, if anyone preaches to you a gospel other than the one that you received, let that one be accursed! "<br>  <br>  So that shoud be logically incontrovertible. <br>  <br>  Secondly, Islam is later but more than that DOES NOT completely reject the Christian Bible, just parts. Now where could that authority come from ?<br>  <br>  Third and most important, What I said about Islam is what they say about Moonies and Mormons. Remember, if you study religion, you find the heavenly messenger with the special new message pretty often !!!! Even Shirley Maclaine uses it. <br>  <br>  SO, in conclusion, if St Paul can't warn of an updated Gospel neither can the Muslims.

"Scriber" here means  the writer of Torah (law of the LORD). And their pens lying falsely.<br>  I don't think Jeremiah will condemn the scriber if they just cheating in government record or Talmud (note: law of LORD)<br>  ======================================...<br>  <br>  We believe bible is loosely mistranslated through out several levels of language translation (example: Original --> Greek --> Roman Vulgate --->NIV), <br>  and misinterpreted through the changing of language.

0lnamekJaa	Just look at ALL the contradictions in the creation myth of the bible:<br>  <br>  (BTW... There were actually TWO women created in the Garden of Eden... Lilith and Eve... Lilith was created at the same time as Adam and wanted equality... Eve was created FROM Adam and was his slave... Nice of god to give Adam a slave after his first woman got uppity and started to think for herself...)<br>  <br>  ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ <br>  Creation Contradiction, 1<br>  <a href="http://www.nobeliefs.com/DarkBible/darkbible5.htm#creation-paradox-1" rel="nofollow">http://www.nobeliefs.com/DarkBible/darkb...</a><br>  "And God said, Let there be light: and there was light. And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness. And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day." (Genesis 1: 3-5)<br>  <br>  "And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also. And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth." (Genesis 1:16-17)<br>  <br>  Comment<br>  God creates day and night on the first day and then makes the stars and the two great lights (sun and moon) on the fourth day (Genesis 1:19). How can you have day and night on the first day without a star? This describes a dramatic contradiction to the way the actual universe works. To have a day you must have a rotating planet and a sun. Genesis proves that God (or more accurately, the authors of Genesis) could not have known about the structure of the universe, or even the difference between stars and planets.<br>  ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ <br>  <br>  Creation Contradiction, 2<br>  "And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that is was good. And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness..." (Genesis 1:25-26)<br>  <br>  "And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him. And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air..." (Genesis 2:18-19)<br>  <br>  Comment<br>  In the first account, man gets created after the beasts, the second account has man created before the beasts . Only a person who exercised warped logic or blind faith could believe this outright contradiction. Yet to the fundamentalist reader, the many hundreds of contradictions and discrepancies in the Bible go by unseen, regardless of how many honest scholars and theologians have discovered otherwise.<br>  <br>  In fact there occurs two stories of Genesis, the second story starts at Genesis 2:4. The first story uses Elohim (God in the plural form) and the second story uses the LORD God (Yahweh Elohim, sometimes incorrectly termed Jehovah). Both stories appear markedly different, yet somehow in history the stories got annexed together. This shows the allegorical intent of Genesis rather than a factual account.<br>  <br>  Even the belief among non-fundamentalists, that the Bible has kept its original form despite minor changes, has led many theologians to think otherwise. One of the most highly respected theologians, Bruce Metzger, has written extensively on the errors in the Bible. For example, in his book "The text of the New Testament- Its Transmission, Corruption, and Restoration," Metzger asserts errors due to:<br>  <br>  Errors arising from faulty eyesight <br>  Errors arising from faulty hearing <br>  Errors of the mind <br>  Errors of judgment <br>  Difficulties historical and geographical <br>  Alterations from doctrinal considerations <br>  Addition of miscellaneous details. <br>  Many times whole belief systems and vast changes to a society can change from a simple mistranslation of a single word. (For example "virgin" got confused in Isaiah 7:14 for young woman "almah")<br>  ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ <br>  <br>  Creation Contradiction, 3<br>  "So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them." (Genesis 1:27)<br>  <br>  "And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof; And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man." (Genesis 2:21-22)<br>  <br>  Comment<br>  In the first account, God created a man and female simultaneously, in God's image. In the second account Adam gets created from the dust (Genesis 2:7), and then later, a woman came from one of Adam's ribs.

Later on (4:23-27), it states that they also conducted Enoch into the garden of Eden when he was translated from the Earth at age 365, where he records the evil deeds of mankind for all time — adding further that the garden is one of four holy places that the Lord has on Earth, the other three being Mount Sinai, Mount Zion, and the 'Mount of the East' (usually assumed by scholars to mean Mount Ararat).<br>  ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~<br>  <br>  Eden as a Kingdom<br>  The structure and order defined by God in the Garden of Eden is also believed to have been the early structure for the Kingdom of God.

Born when Adam was 130 years old (Genesis 5:3), Seth was "a son in his likeness and image." Genesis 5:4 states that Adam fathered "sons and daughters" before his death, aged 930 years. It is stated in the Bible that Seth probably means "granted".<br>  <br>  Seth had a son, Enos, at age 105 (Genesis 5:6) and further children; he lived 912 years (Genesis 5:8).<br>  <br>  Rashi (Rabbi Shlomo Yitzhaqi) refers to Seth as the ancestor of Noah and hence the father of all mankind.

You have never read the Bible and you do not understand simple matters regarding such,  I am not trying to insult you by any means but it is a fact.  I can tell by your querstion,  Adam and Eve had many other children but only three sons were mentioned by name. Genesis says that Adam had sons and daughters.  Jewish historians say they had 56 children,  These children married each other,  Who do you think made the law about incest and marrying close family members.  It was not mankind.  God made the law 2500 years after Adam and Eve.  Adam and Eve were created perfect in body and form.  It took them and their children longer to grow old and die and it was also safe for them to marry each other.  These days incest has become a popular way to have sex.  Even though God says it is wrong and not to do it anymore. So if people do these things now after God says he no longer allows that, do you think that it wasn't done in Adam and Eves time when their children had no other option yet God commanded them to fill the earth and subdue it?  How were they to do this?|`|4xLqf5ASaa	The Bible does not say Adam and Eve only had two sons.  They had other sons and daughters and marrying siblings was not forbidden until much later because the gene pool was not screwed up yet.

Since God told them to be fruitful and multiply, the only means they had to do so was to intermarry between siblings or cousins eventually. God did not prohibit intermarriages between siblings or close relatives until after the Flood so there was no law or restriction from God in doing so prior to that. You must also bear in mind that Adam and Eve were created as perfect human beings with perfect genetics in the beginning so any genetic mutations (which are harmful today and the reason for prohibitions against close intermarriages ) would not have been an issue. Actually, anyone who marries today is really marrying a distant relative....we just have prohibitions against marrying a close relative for harmful genetic reasons.|`|fbdad2836b12a55aac5a35bcb551f09caa	If you read the Genesis account, you realize that women were so insignificant that they were not even named. So, it's very possible that Cain and Abel were twins and Eve had a daughter, but just was not mentioned. Geneology in those days was based on the son, not the daughters so women were of no consequence to be named.|`|kX0T1urdaa	If you ever read Genesis you will notice all the begats are sons, not daughters. Women were not mentioned. Adam and Eve probably had many daughters. <br>  <br>  Incest didn't come into play until centuries later.

bRLCxmP6aa	Yes - there does not appear to be much of a limit on the number of languages a child can learn if they are exposed to those languages in early childhood. In addition, there doesn't appear to be any confusion for the child, either, so they don't mix up the languages, either.<br>  Millions of children all over the world learn two languages with ease and are equally fluent in both.|`|qLhtnommaa	yes .. i know 3 llanguages and am learning my 4th and 5th right now. <br>  <br>  i know ukrainian, russian, and english) (learning spanish and german)|`|RLQPWkXCaa	Yes. My wife grew up with four languages in her house, and speaks them all quite well. <br>  <br>  Experts say the best way is for one parent to speak each language exclusively around the child for the first few years. <br>  <br>  The main problem is getting the child to speak to you in the language that is not the main language of the society, say in this case Spanish. They would understand perfectly well, but always respond in English. The parent speaking Spanish has to pretend not to understand English for a few years until the child has the habit of speaking that language. My wife's niece does that with her parents, and she's about 2 years old. <br>  <br>  Spanish/English is probably an easier mix here than most because there is enough Spanish-language programming that will teach the child that it's a good language.|`|AA10665247	Of course,even with the One ...predominating(language),he(child) is going to understand(feel)...both!<br>  <br>  <br>        p.s. My Case|`|6683fa949dfc425a21a5980b5f9d8a9daa	Definitely.  However, one language can become more dominant over the other.|`|Vobg2YAAaa	I think that's right|`|ReTUTN9naa	Yes you can and in fact it is easier and better for a small child to learn two languages or more when their young because their mind develops  and gets influenced by what he/her hears and observes.<br>  I personally was taught spanish when I was in my toddler years and when I went to pre-school I easily adapted to the English language as it was always spoken at school by my other playmates and in my environment as Spanish was more heard around my mom and other family members. <br>  I also know people that aquire the knowledge of more than two languages also since when they were young they were used to listening to more languages besides English and they never saw it as a challenge to learn more beyond their own limits since to begin with they don't realize it but instead just get used to it .|`|55RiXgXwaa	I agree with everything the other posters have said, but I would like to warn that it is not automatic that the child will learn just because they are exposed to the language.  If no effort is made to coax the child to learn, they will normally only learn the language of their peers, not their parents, especially if the language of of one of the parents is the same as the language of their peers.<br>  <br>  I know a family in California where the mother and father both spoke Spanish at home, but none of the four children can speak it and understand very little.<br>  <br>  A friend of ours is from Peru but now lives in Atlanta.  She speaks only Spanish.  Her son was born in Atlanta.  When they visited us, the mother had to ask me to translate what her son was saying to her, because he only spoke English.<br>  <br>  So yes, it can be done and quite easily, but some effort has to be made to insure that the child embraces both(all) languages.

Plus if China does rise to power, believe that it's 13 neighbors, Japan, South Korea, and others nations won't sit back and watch.

Isn't it obvious?|`|oL6FUbshaa	God created everything that has been created. <br>  <br>  Is there a verse in the Bible that says God committed everything that has been committed?<br>  <br>  Sin isn't created, it's committed. People don't create adultery, they commit adultery. People don't create suicide, they commit suicide. Just because God created gravity, that doesn't mean it's His fault that people jump off buildings.<br>  <br>  So you see, since sin isn't created, logically it is uncreated. God did not create things that are uncreated. He only created things that are created.<br>  <br>  There are lots of things that exist today that are uncreated. God Himself exists, and He is uncreated. No one created God since He has no begginning. God did not create Himself. So just because something exists, that doesn't mean that it's created.<br>  <br>  Created things are considered creation. Committed things are considered commission.<br>  <br>  Sin is man's commission, not God's creation. Don't confuse the two. That would be illogical.<br>  <br>  God created the ability to sin. But the ability to sin is not a sin. Just because I have the ability to worship an idol, that doesn't make me an idolater.<br>  <br>  God created the knowledge of sin. But the knowledge of sin is not a sin. Just because I have the knowledge that it's wrong to rob a bank, that doesn't make me a bank robber.<br>  <br>  Sin is not an object created by God. It is an action committed by man. Don't confuse objects with actions. That's illogical.<br>  <br>  However, although the evil of sin isn't God's creation, God does create the evil of calamity. He created all kinds of natural disasters (tonadoes, hurricanes, volcanos, etc.) but that is a completely different definition of evil. That's not the evil of sin. That's the evil of calamity.|`|yN3fWUCuaa	"Oh and also, before I get the answer "he created the possibility of evil, we just chose that", <br>  <br>  Funny, that you disallow the answer that explains it.<br>  <br>  "why didn't he create a reality w/o the possibility of evil but still w/ free choice if he is all powerful."<br>  <br>  Do you even read your own questions before you post them?  Free choice w/o the possibility of evil is illogical.  If you do not believe this, please explain how it could possibly be true.<br>  <br>  If God were to supernaturally intervene at every wrong choice, then why make a choice at all?  In essence, there would * be * no product of our choices so, therefore, they would be immaterial and meaningless.<br>  <br>  <br>  Odd how you admonish us to use logic, yet fail to yourself.|`|wK85ZvOMaa	People and angels create sin. Sin is an action going against God. And as long as there is free will there is the possibility of evil.

The choice between good and evil exists in order to separate the wheat from the chaff.<br>  <br>  Earth is only a training ground for heaven or hell. Some people will break laws. Religion only tries to make people realize that there will be consequences for their actions.<br>  <br>  It is analgous to breaking human laws. Spiritual laws have been clearly defined as well. The possibiliy of evil does not exist in Heaven. This is where he created this possibility. <br>  <br>  It is not logical to make choices that will destroy us. Many great scientists and logicians have believed in God. There are many paths to God : intellectual, spiritual, ritual, etc.<br>  <br>  If you are truly a searcher and not just one who likes to win arguments you will sincerely find out for yourself.|`|PS6Pjtndaa	Uh ...<br>  <br>  Hang on a sec, here.  Sin is not like a Buick, people!  You walk over to a rock and say, "Here!  God created this," we get it.  You walk over to a lake and dip a toe in there and say the same thing, we get it.  Sin is defined in the Bible as rebellion, defiance, and such.  Sin is ... "distance from God," "defiance to God's will."  So, in that sense, sin is on par with a feeling or an emotion.  <br>  <br>  Don't you see that sin is not in an of itself a tangible creation? Sin is mysterious.  It cannot be seen, felt, smelled, or heard.  Only the manifestations of sin can be perceived!  So, while your scripture is compelling and even tempting, I say this to you:<br>  <br>  I can point to the heavens and say, "God created that."  I can point to the earth and say, "God created this."  I can point to you and say, "God created you too."  Then I would ask YOU to point to SIN itself as a creation of God's and SHOW ME sin as proof that it is a creation before we can go to the next level of questioning, namely WHO created sin?<br>  <br>  In fact, I would argue that the WORST that you can say about God vis a vis sin is that He ALLOWED sin to enter this world.  That is troubling enough to Christians!  I just don't think that you can make a plausible argument that God created sin.  You don't even know where it is or what it is; yet, you're ranting about it being created?<br>  <br>  In fact, God in His Holiness is the exact opposite of sin.  How could one so pure create something so evil?  It's a logical improbability if not impossibility.<br>  <br>  Lord bless.|`|UUC2KO3Daa	I like Hugo's answer: CHOICE<br>  <br>  Love involves free will. The alternative option would be robotic-like behavior to never actually choose to love God.<br>  <br>  God being God, obviously knew the ramifications of allowing free will.  It would allow sin. Key word being allow.  If I God allows sin did He create it?<br>  <br>  In the spirit of splitting hairs, which athiest are forced to do, if I allow you to choose - am I responsible for your choice? Did I create your choice or did I allow you to you to as my cool-slang enriched friends say  - "make it happen"?<br>  <br>  Nothing happened or happens or will happen without Him - including free will.   Again splitting hairs- not exactly the same as sin. Bottomline is sin is a result of choice.<br>  <br>  We all have/had a choice. Including Satan. Including the Angels. (1/3 were free to choose to follow Satan and are known as demons)<br>  <br>  Satan's nickname (handle?) is the The Accuser.  <br>  <br>  1.<br>  He accused God of trying to run everything. (As in who put you in charge?)  God allowed every being to leave that wanted to. He's only in charge by choice<br>  <br>  2. He accused God of lying - we all know the familiar lie - you will NOT surely die!!<br>  <br>  3.<br>  He accused God of being overly protective of Job. God let Satan have at it and Job didn't fall for Satan's trying to try to FORCE him to sin.<br>  <br>  4.<br>  He accused Jesus (thru the Pharisees) of not obeying The Law. (most good crooks know the law back and forth)<br>  <br>  Now, being true to his title "The Accuser" ... He accuses God of having made this mess.  Nothing new. Same old same old game. Being an old gamer/hustler/player from the old school I'll tell you this... game knows game when we hear it.<br>  <br>  <br>  For the classic rock enthusiasts out here... the Rolling Stones had a chart topper called Sympathy For The Devil... Satan is singing it... the hookline was ....<br>  <br>  "Hustlin' you... is the nature of my game"<br>  <br>  The question becomes... "are you a trick"?  A mark?  That's quite different than a dummy. We've all played the fool at some point.<br>  <br>  Interestingly, the Bible doesn't not use the word "trick" - instead "fool" is used. Quite different than a dummy.  In fact some hustles only work on really smart people. Ask Madoff.<br>  <br>  "Did God create sin?"  is one of those questions where you look the asker in the eye and say, "do I look like a fool"?

I do think it is odd she asked you for this...not to be crude or inappropriate in anyway but do you think she has taken a more...personal liking...to you? not that there is ANYTHING wrong with that. Just an observation.|`|Mqh3Lrjlaa	Relax, it's okay. You can't help how you feel.  I hear ya...<br>  <br>  On one side, you're alarmed and it hits you as wow, she's not "normal" but on the otherhand you shun yourself for thinking this and feel like a bad friend for exhibiting perhaps some homophobia.<br>  <br>  You're not a bad friend. Give it time to sink in, and try to maintain your cool. All will be fine.|`|n662efY5aa	It sounds like she might have been asking if you knew any lesbian sites to see if you were also bi/les.

Since you are straight, obviously you can't help her out with "learning" what to do.  I would think if she's truly lesbian, she should have some natural idea.  Good look to her, and keep supporting her!|`|d7Dq9rQ8aa	ok well umm. if you're freaked out by all this...then apparently you aren't really her friendd. and as for the sites...tell her theres no such thing and maybe she'll believe you XD <br>  just kidding.|`|l7FMIM0qaa	well i think that u should tell her that she doesnt have to go to a website to know what to do with a girl. i think she should just be herself and be who she is and everything will turn out fine.

bf621e05dd1c4f89ff36b9fdce162254aa	The Bible doesn't prove anything.  Therefore I don't understand the basis of your question.  It would be nice if it did prove there is no god, for that would mean people would have to take responsibility for their own actions for a change, however like any novel, it is a bit too light on facts!|`|gGd3v3M5aa	Who cares?<br>  Either way, just believe in what you believe in.<br>  Religion is a never ending cycle.<br>  I don't think the bible can prove anything just as much as it can disprove anything.|`|PvgZUzHjaa	"Properly read, the Bible is the most potent force for atheism ever conceived."

The Bible is "living and active" (Hebrews 4:12), which you can use to conclude that the Bible's truth seen and played out in this world are its proof. It is not a text book or a rigorous scientific process, but it is something to be lived out and it is something that is active in many people. In that action, it's truth will be revealed and thus you will have your proof.<br>  <br>  Second, atheism is a belief system, thus, requires no proof. However, atheism uses science to give reason to its belief. Thus, atheism uses science as proof for itself.<br>  <br>  Christianity is not opposed to science, however. Christianity deals with the issue of sin (aka wrong-doing) in mankind. To do this, it presupposes many things outside of our natural world (such as, man has a soul, man is an eternal being, etc), and thus cannot be proven by science.<br>  Thus, to be an atheist, you must reject that which cannot be proven nor disproven by science and hold to only that which is science. A more safe, but potentially incomplete view.|`|gpvmhGCIaa	"Atheism" is clearly taught in the Bible...  First of all, God says:  "The fool has said in his heart, "there is no God..."."  (Psalm 14:1)  I think that means that God is saying than men that profess to be atheists are "fools"...  What do you think?<br>  <br>  And in Romans chapter one God says:  "because of creation.... man is without excuse..."  So, what did you say your excuse was for being an atheist?<br>  <br>  Psalm 19:1 says:  "The heavens declare the Glory of God and firmament His handiwork."  Can you not look into the night sky and see the handiwork of God?|`|MdyHKQRGaa	Atheism can't be proved, cos it's just a belief.<br>  <br>  Science, on the other hand...|`|e52ejkQ7aa	Fail.<br>  <br>  Edit: What? You can't prove atheism through the bible! That doesn't make sense. So  I said...fail!

Statues are typically covered.  The holy water fonts are emptied.  The Blessed Sacrament is removed from the Tabernacle and the Tabernacle candle is extinguished.  The Blessed Sacrament that was consecrated during the Mass on Holy Thursday that will be distributed during the Good Friday Service is stored in a reserve tabernacle usually kept in the sacristy.

mmMgfhf2aa	You can try saying ' I don't think we're ever going to see eye to eye on this one'. Just leave it there. If they're particularly obnoxious they'll probably want to keep going with the argument. Some people are like that. Just try not to get drawn in again. Maybe a patronising pat on the shoulder and a chuckle at their ideas before you excuse yourself for a moment might work.|`|RoqxGbgRaa	you can smile and say, "we'll have to agree to disagree on this one."  <br>  or say, "i completely disagree with you, but i respect your views on this."<br>  <br>  after you do this, make sure to change the subject to something that will get you past the moment, making everyone comfortable again. <br>  <br>  be sure, as well, not to ice out the person with whom you were in disagreement.  depending upon how heated things got, it might be really difficult, but make yourself make eye contact with them, speak directly to them, and smile if you can.|`|ridu0Rtwaa	It takes in reality only one to make a quarrel.

jd14u32qaa	Does he say 'Is my wife beautiful?' like he's asking for opinions or does he say 'Isn't my wife beautiful?' rhetorically.  If he's asking it rhetorically, then like you said, he's just proud and trying to draw her beauty.  If he's asking for peoples' opinions then he's probably lacking confidence in himself and he's trying to prove to HIMSELF that other people find her attractive as well.|`|RWgjnwl9aa	Is he taking a poll? how ridiculous|`|lsKAp1qEaa	Beauty is skin deep.

I am not a believer. I am not an agnostic. I am none of these because the answer to god's existence is unimportant.<br>  <br>  I am what I am and what I am needs no excuses!<br>  <br>  People ask what would convince me that g-d truly exists. While I am not sure, I am certainly open to any tangible evidence. What evidence would convince you that g-d does not exist? Do you see the conundrum?<br>  <br>  Bible passages are not evidence of g-d's existence to me. This is my standard of proof, not yours. However, if proof were proffered that convinced me g-d exists, I would change absolutely nothing in my life or my behavior. Existence or not of g-d does not matter.<br>  <br>  What if evidence were produced that convinced you g-d does not exist with certainty (evidence according to your standards of proof)? What would you change in your life?<br>  <br>  - Would you stop evangelizing?<br>  - Would you start sinning more?<br>  - Would you stop helping those less fortunate than you?<br>  - Would you feel that life is meaningless?<br>  - Would you lose your Raison d'être?<br>  <br>  Atheists such as myself have real moral values perform mitzvahs not for the sake of salvation, but because moral codes and performing good deeds and helping those in need is the right thing to do. <br>  <br>  Many (not all!) people choose Christianity for the reward of salvation or to avoid the punishment of hell. That's known as Pascal's wager. I don't consider these folks Christian or religious at all. To me, a true Christian would accept Christ without regard to salvation, would not crow about being saved, would not condemn others, and would even take that John 3:16 oath of allegiance knowing that g-d might hypothetically punish them.<br>  <br>  Isn't the true purpose of spirituality personal development and growth, not the salvation reward? What type of supreme being needs or wants our devotion? I don't think any g-d would be that shallow. However, the bible says man was formed in g-d's image. Seems to me the holy book has that backwards: g-d was formed in man's image.<br>  <br>  What type of parent would eternally refuse to acknowledge their child or kick them out of heaven -- I mean the parents' house -- for disobedience or refusing to pledge their fealty to mom and dad? Ever hear of unconditional love? Does the g-d of Abraham possess that quality? If so, he would still let people into heaven even if they refused to acknowledge Jesus.<br>  <br>  Why is the concept that one can perform selfless mitzvahs and possess moral values without belief in g-d so difficult for many Christians to comprehend?|`|4644ec1ac391913c8f074e3b205f8168aa	You have - good news -  for us all.<br>  <br>  How do we find God's will for our lives?<br>  <br>  But what think ye? A certain man had two sons; and he came to the first, and said, Son, go work to day in my vineyard. <br>  He answered and said, I will not: but afterward he repented, and went. <br>  And he came to the second, and said likewise. And he answered and said, I go, sir: and went not. <br>  Whether of them twain did the will of his father? They say unto him, The first. Jesus saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you. <br>  For John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and ye believed him not: but the publicans and the harlots believed him: and ye, when ye had seen it, repented not afterward, that ye might believe him. <br>  <br>  <br>  The good news of obvious sinners repenting through Christ and showing changed lives should be enough to teach anybody.|`|PAA4uWPuaa	Tell me what your'll means first.|`|Znw52fxkaa	How find god for your will life?<br>  <br>  What are you actually asking?|`|2jtRxKOsaa	what?<br>  I'm an atheist, i don't believe in anything at all, it's all a load of nonsense!|`|RiZ6KMqmaa	Gods will for you is to learn grammar, then you will understand His Word|`|qxteTM9Kaa	read the Bible and pray|`|4e911a1a92f0524d87554578ea0e7544aa	Find a better English translation website.|`|NrzxtivLaa	uh.....it seems your grammar is indecipherable...|`|CBUPymktaa	follow love ..|`|gYThMID8aa	Yes and no.<br>  Did you actually read what you had written?

It's a series of 7 books about an invasion by unspecified military forces, and the lead characters are all aged 16 when the series begins.  (The kids are all on a remote bush campout when the invasion happens -- they go back home, everything's changed and creepy, and they become guerilla fighters when they realize what's happened....)<br>  <br>  Lots of guys have enjoyed "The Far Side of the Mountain," but I never read this myself.<br>  <br>  More in the fantasy-adventure line is the series by Orson Scott Card called "The Tales of Alvin Maker" series -- the title character is the seventh son of a seventh son, so all sorts of strange and wonderful things happen to him as he grows up.  Set in an alternate-universe pioneer USA, where magic of all kinds is real.<br>  <br>  Readers of all ages enjoy the adult space-fantasy series by Lois McMasters Bujold, about her title character, Miles Vorkosigan.  He's a cripple on a planet that despises "mutants" (the society has good reasons for this), who was only allowed to live because of the privileged position of his parents.  In the first book (I think it's the one titled "The Warrior's Apprentice"), he accidentally (?!!) starts up a mercenary space fleet .... and things get strange from there ...  :-D<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|1Hu8w9JZaa	Robin Hobb<br>  David Gemell (RIP)<br>  Stephen King<br>  Harlen Coben<br>  Thomas Harris (hannibal books etc)<br>  Raymond E feist (Black magician trilogy, amazing)<br>  Trudi Canavan (priestess of the white saga, also amazing)|`|Re6H2xLuaa	my brother used to read those anthony horowitz books... i never much liked them but he was CRAZY about them.|`|B9PMwpEPaa	night is OK, the perks of being a wallflower is good.<br>  If you christian then read The Shack by Young

It's how we choose to take them and turn them around into something positive. God made me get a virus where my heart became three times the size of a normal one and it lost complete functionality and I had to get a heart transplant to save my life. I had my moment where I asked God why! Why would he do this to me. But we're not here to understand the why, but to figure out a way to make it become who we are and strengthen our outlook on life. <br>  <br>  I dunno! You find yourself in all this. No one else can. <br>  <br>  best of luck :]

vhlORK4Waa	Patron saints are chosen as special protectors or guardians over areas of life. These areas can include occupations, illnesses, churches, countries, causes -- anything that is important to us. The earliest records show that people and churches were named after apostles and martyrs as early as the fourth century. <br>  <br>  Recently, the popes have named patron saints but patrons can be chosen by other individuals or groups as well. Patron saints are often chosen today because an interest, talent, or event in their lives overlaps with the special area. Angels can also be named as patron saints. A patron saint can help us when we follow the example of that saint's life and when we ask for that saint's intercessory prayers to God. <br>  <br>  For example, Francis of Assisi loved nature and so he is patron of ecologists. Francis de Sales was a writer and so he is patron of journalists and writers. Clare of Assisi was named patron of television because one Christmas when she was too ill to leave her bed she saw and heard Christmas Mass -- even though it was taking place miles away.|`|8747ad5946dec06c50e2f01268404c87aa	Well, they all have white shoes and a slight shuffle when they walk.<br>  They smile a lot, usually raising their arms in lazy 'U' shapes with their heads slightly ******.|`|2zgv89OQaa	Intercessor.

It's starts off with the few girls who's mothers or older sisters make mean comments towards them because they are insecure and then because they feel bad about themselves they put down others to try to feel good and somewhere in the horrible cycle of verbal abuse it becomes a system of social hierarchy where women constantly compete with each other to be the most perfect and will do next to anything in order to try to socially assassinate a rival. (I knew a girl who would sleep with guys she cared nothing for just to ruin relationships)<br>  <br>  It's a cycle of stupid that just keeps women oppressing women and eliminates so many young girls from academic success. Unfortunately the only thing you can do is decide to play along and spend all of high school and college and maybe your whole life trying to compete over trivial things (Like who can be the skinniest) or you can refuse to drop to that pathetic level and be a social outcast.|`|ixqpmUVLaa	They are jealous.

mSFjbetxaa	No.<br>  <br>  The Greek text of the NT does NOT use the specific word homosexual. If you have a Bible that uses the specific word "homosexual," then you need to throw it out and get a new Bible, the translators have taken gross liberties.<br>  <br>  The word being translated to "homosexual" in 1 Corithians 6, and 1 Timothy 1 is "arsenokoitai." This word does not appear in Greek writings prior to Paul's use of it in the NT. Paul made the word up!!<br>  <br>  Nobody knows for sure what meaning Paul was trying to convey by it's use. If the meaning Paul wanted to convey was homosexual, then he would have used the word "paiderasste", which was the term used at the time for male homosexual. The word "paiderasste" does not appear in the Bible.<br>  <br>  "Arsenokoitai" is made up of two parts: "arsen" means "man"; "koitai" means "beds." Literally translated "arsenokoitai" is a "male-bedder." It is interesting to note that during the time of Martin Luther, the word was universally translated as masturbators untill the 20th century. <br>  <br>  Male-bedder has also been interpreted to mean a male prostitute. Which seems to me would be much closer to it's meaning than homosexual.<br>  <br>  The Greek word being translated as effeminate is "malakoi." The word appears two other times in the NT, both times being translated as "soft." Taken in the context of this passage some believe it to actually mean "soft in morals." Within it's context, that meaning makes more sense than it does as a descriptive of a person's outward mannerisms.<br>  <br>  Jesus, himself, never says one word against homosexuality. If it is the grave sin it is made out to be, then you would think that Jesus would have mentioned it.<br>  <br>  In fact, Jesus may have confirmed that homosexuals are from birth in Matthew 19:11. The modern meaning of the word eunuch is a castrated male. However, in ancient times it was a broad term that included any man who lacked sexual desire for women for whatever reason. Hence, their use as chamberlains or officers in the Bible.<br>  <br>  It should be noted that men who are castrated after puberty do not lose their sex drive, and historically have made untrustworthy chamberlains. In fact, many women of the harem preferred having sex with castrated males because they could not get pregnant by them.<br>  <br>  Jesus even states that not everyone can accept this word. If eunuch simply meant a castrated male or a person born with deformed genitals, then why would some not be able to accept this word? If the ancient term "eunuch" did indeed include homosexuals (some surviving ancient Roman literature points to this), then Jesus was proven right, some cannot accept that homosexuality is normal and natural from birth.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  BTW: Sodom and Gomorrah were not destroyed because of homosexuality.<br>  <br>  The decision to destroy the city of Sodom was made prior to the incident with the angels.<br>  <br>  Ezekeiel 16:49-50 tells us exactly why the city of Sodom was destroyed: "Now this was the sin of your sister Sodom: She and her daughters were arrogant, overfed and unconcerned; they did not help the poor and needy. They were haughty and did detestable things before me. Therefore I did away with them as you have seen." There is no mention of homosexuality.<br>  <br>  In Matthew 10:14-15 & Luke 10:7-16, Jesus implies that the sin of the people of Sodom was inhospitality to strangers.<br>  <br>  Jude 1:7 talks about the sin of Sodom as "going after strange flesh." That would seem to me to be talking about bestiality, the angels were not human. Would angels even be confined to definitions of male or female sexual characteristics?<br>  <br>  The other problem with saying that this story is about homosexuality is that Lot offers his two daughters to the mob. Lot lived in Sodom and would have certainly known if the men in the mob were homosexual. Why would he even offer his two daughters to a mob of homosexuals? If the mob's intentions were homosexual in nature, then why didn't Lot offer the mob his two future son-in-laws?<br>  <br>  Romans 1:26-27 is not speaking about people with a homosexual orientation. It is speaking specifically about heterosexual men and women who go against their own sexual orientation.<br>  <br>  The key word here is "exchanges." That implies that the men and women being talked about had known something different previously. They had previously known the truth about God, then exchanged him for what they knew to be a lie, (what went against their own nature.) They had previously been heterosexual, and again exchanged it for what goes against their own nature.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Ignore the ignorant homophobes who use the buy-bull to justify their own hate and stupidity.|`|LFWQiGYkaa	I recently read something by Jimmy Carter about that. I wish I could find the exact quote for you, it was really well-said...<br>  <br>  But basically, he says the Bible also condemns adultery, divorce, sex outside of marriage, etc... But somehow, homosexuals get the brunt of the religious right's condemnation. He concludes it is much easier to condemn sins one has no temptation of committing.<br>  <br>  Jimmy Carter was not a big fan of the religious right and neither am I. Let them condemn all they want. The stringiest condemners are also the biggest hypocrites.<br>  <br>  If you want a Bible quote, I'd go with Matthew 7:3<br>  <br>  And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?<br>  <br>  <br>  There is also some condemnation of homosexuality in the Epistles. But my answer to that is: Why do you worship Paul? He was just  a man.|`|TyRfv0eoaa	If you read the Bible in the original Hebrew and Greek, it doesn't say anything against homosexuality in either Testament.|`|ttTDiJWfaa	Don't worry about being gay.

Only Paul, in one verse, and even that is highly debatable because it has been skewed and mistranslated from the greek and hebrew to mean something other than what is meant originally and to fit the anti-homosexual agenda.

As0lEoQCaa	best description is pleasure spiked with pain.  Relaxation and Lubricaton, Condoms, Alcohol, Fourplay is  KEY.  Its like a fine wine it gets much better with time.|`|3mAgM405aa	Begin with the purchase of a small sized dildo with appropriate sterile lubricant [KY is okay] and practice stretching your rectal muscle by inserting the dildo into your anus very gradually.  By stretching the rectal muscle, you can lessen the possibility of breaking and bleeding of small blood vessals surround the sphinchter muscle.<br>  <br>  And prior to the actual anal engagement with your boyfriend, take a cleansing enema to removal excess fetal material from your rectum. There is no need to use a condom for anal sex and since your rectum is clean, you can even engage in oral sex upon his penis and not worry about tasting any foul odors. Begin with anal engagement while you are in the doggie position; not the missionary position which is more painful.  After a few sessions, you may well enjoy this new sexual encounter and perhaps pass on regular coital sex and attendant birth control.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  |`|N9nJWYa5aa	It's simple, you'll need a decent lube and to be relaxed.  If you aren't relaxed/comfortable with your BF then it's going to be painful.  Preparation, intimate games, and foreplay should help.  Maybe do everything other than penetrative sex on several dates until it just feels like a natural progression.|`|adcfdd60dce6d4c5eee22d88d7f79f6caa	It's like this:<br>  Yes, it will most likely hurt the first few times until you get used to it.  There's a small percentage of people (men and women) who love it from the very first time.  Most people, though, take some adjusting.<br>  <br>  As others have said, lubrication and taking your time are the best ways to start.  There's also something called anal-ease or something like that, that kind of numbs the anus - like the way you can numb a toothache - which can help in the beginning.<br>  <br>  It's also normal to be nervous.  So don't be embarrassed about that.  Your boyfriend hopefully respects that.  If you care enough to let him be your first, he should care enough to be patient and gentle with you.<br>  <br>  Good luck and have fun!<br>  <br>  P.S.  I'm more than twice your age and never learned to like be a bottom.  Oh well.  Different strokes, eh?|`|6KpZ2fIRaa	It will probably hurt. It's something you should work your way up to gradually and comfortably.|`|FtVRYkI4aa	Lots of lubricant can really help|`|Mok3ewI2aa	I pitch not catch.|`|BIoCl9Qqaa	its not going to be a walk in the park you first time. get yourself some good lube, NOT KY GEL, and you be the one to determine how fast the whole experience happens.  he might be the happy rabbit and that would be the end of your first time experience.<br>  <br>  you also need to be mentally ready for it.  if your constantly thinking how bad its going to hurt, then at the slightest pain, your going to want the experience to end.<br>  <br>  don't be afraid to stay no, stop, and more importantly, you need more lube on.|`|B667elmWaa	Yes it does hurt at first because you have to train yourself. I'll help you:<br>  <br>  1. Before sex, have a poo and douche yourself by removing the shower head and pressing the shower hose against your but t. make sure you are empty.<br>  2. Make sure your bf plays with your but t plenty before he enters.<br>  3. Use plenty of lube<br>  4. Your bf must use a condom.<br>  5. As he enters you, push down as if you are doing a poo. This will open your hole and reduce the pain considerably, and this is one reason for the douche, because it gives you confidence to push down without having an accident.<br>  6. Continue to concentrate on keeping your hole open, otherwise it will close up automatically and cause pain.<br>  7. Try to relax and learn how to enjoy the sensation.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|osGwqKylaa	I am not a guy, but I know my fair share.<br>  <br>  It will be uncomfortable, at first, but with proper preparation it should not be painful. Make sure you have lubricant (not gel or oil) and condoms. It being your first time does not mean you don't carry diseases and the same goes for him. Make sure to be stretched, before you actually get on with the real thing, do it right and with calm and it'll reduce the chance of being hurt. If you still are unsure, make sure you and your partner have a safe word : a word that you can say when/if you want it all to stop. Don't worry too much about it, lots of people do it and it is sure to feel a lot more pleasurable than painful! ;)|`|qsSXUBt8aa	If his penis is as big as mine....of course it'll hurt lol. But seriously, I don't take it up the rear.  Though I think I can give you a little advice. Just relax and don't rush. Let him use his fingers and plenty of lubrication first. You'll slowly but surely open up. His fingers would give you a "preview" of what his penis feels like. When he finally puts it in, it's going to hurt, but it should NOT be excruciating. No matter how big it is. If it's excruciating, stop immediately and try again because you there was definitely something either he or you weren't doing right. Hope I helped.|`|Hvuqv6duaa	I don't think a coat of pubic hair makes the transition any easier haha.<br>  But just make sure yall use a lot of lube and you should be fine and it really won't hurt that bad! =]|`|q4swmrK7aa	it's gonna hurt, i'll give you that, not that i have any experience, but u should use a condom....|`|cyoc0d3naa	You should Consult your doctor first.

Just work up to it and enjoy.|`|qlGEvLhNaa	Use a lubricated condom, and a thicker lube than one of those bottled ones, use plain old KY jelly.  Don't only apply it to the condom...add lots up in there as well.  Also, have your bf go slowly.  You might have to try a little bit at a time.  For some people, like me, I don't care for it...it hurts too much.|`|x1yZZQEUaa	its different for some people so maybe yes and maybe no
dgDW0Pt5aa	Yes I believe they are born gay to a certain extent. Molestation plays a large role because they grow up sexually confused. Boys that are molested by men end up being gay because they are too psychologically challenged to get a girl. Girls that are molested by men end up thinking that men are cruel and torturous creatures so they become lesbian. This does not apply to all (I know a heterosexual male that was molested by his stepdad as a child) And with a women molesting a child I can best assume it has the opposite effect.(I would have liked an unrelated female to molest me ...ok jk jk) As for being born gay it all has to do with the very complex hormone levels of the human body being unbalanced.(Mainly testosterone and estrogen) I have seen gay men that look like ugly women and lesbians that are so butch I would be scared to mess with them.|`|qbLTYbZlaa	You're arguing that they're gay because of molestation, but who can say whether or not they were already (born) gay at the time of molestation?<br>  Pointless argument.<br>  <br>  As an edit:  Craig Williams is very very wrong, the majority of paedophiles are straight men and the victims are usually their own children.<br>  <br>  Hmm, Craig Williams is gone.|`|7U0hQ1VPaa	that's a stereotype, not real life. i was never molested or abused as a child. i have wonderful parents and a great Gay life.|`|IRG03siXaa	Your avatar is cool.|`|I2iXz32paa	Very few boys are molested compared to girls. I believe that the most recent scientific study found that about one in three girls is molested as a child...that's a lot! (Most of the time it is by either a father, uncle or older male cousin)<br>  <br>  The world is a sick place, children should be protected.<br>  <br>  And no, being molested doesn't change sexuality...it just makes it really uncomfortable and sometimes causes some serious mental problems (like being afraid of sexual intimacy).|`|AA11263450	There is some truth to your way of thinking, but all people are individuals and handle certain situations differently.  Contrary to the popular belief, I do not necessarily buy into the born gay aspect.  I do agree that sometimes our 'wiring' can be off kilter, thus lending to that born gay theory...but I more often cite behavioral changes due to environment.  I can back this up by cases of countless foster children I have seen and helped Mother raise most of my life...at least 35 years.  I have seen the worst society can dish out in some of these kids...who wouldn't be effing messed up except what their effing parents did to them!!  Sorry, I digress and could soapbox on this forever.  I have seen the teenage boy who was molested by his dad, then kicked outta the house for being effeminate.  I have seen the 5 yr old girl, molested by both parents-she walked onto tiptoe and came with a yeast infection!  I have seen the disturbing sexual predator eyes of a 10 yr old boy, who's whole family effed and sucked each other, who loved his penis so much he painted it with magic markers!

He didn't judge and his teachings were so much against it. He never mentioned homosexuals. He spoke of love, compassion, we all know these things.  But the NT does make anti homosexual comments by Paul.  The two main characters of the NT do come in contradiction here.  There are many times that I believe that christians are mistakenly called so, it seems to me they should be ApostlePaulians or something like that. I seriously doubt that Apostle Paul's teachings were in accordance with Jesus' teachings.  Maybe this good cop -bad cop thing that the NT has is part of a bigger plot, or maybe Jesus was just corrupted by those timers as He is being corrupted now by all these people who use His name to spread hate and bigotry.  Jesus if ever existed was really above all that.  <br>  <br>  This is my opinion. I really don't believe that Jesus would ever allow to anyone to go to hell just because he/she falls in love with the same gender.|`|YI8V5e36aa	well i dont need to read to book to tell you its wrong or not... its not... it doesnt effect anyone accept the partys involved... <br>  <br>  Do people choose to be straight?

r7scOGSqaa	I personally think something is up with the bermuda triangle but i dont think it is how everyone makes it seem. Just remember Thousands travel through the area daily! <br>  Everything is an experince are you willing to give up on that one? Here are some theories and qoutes i found, that will help try to explain the whole disapparance thing. Its kinda long i but think its worth it<br>  <br>  “The triangle was a no more dangerous part of the ocean than any other.”<br>   Dr. A.J. Yelkin’s study revealed unexplained magnetic deviations during phases of the Moon. Dr. Zink’s observations at Bimini revealed unexplained magnetic variations in the compass at the precise time each year in early August (consistent in some ways with Yelkin’s theories). Wilbert Smith’s studies revealed areas of “reduced bindings” in the magnetic field that came and went. But as for any scientific expeditions into the Triangle to take readings or tests or to see if something would happen, none has ever been done. <br>  So its probable that the whole the compasses and everything electronic goes hay-wire is because of that. <br>  Ronald Waddington, a researcher and theorist of the Bermuda Triangle. "My hypothesis is based on the fact that subterranean volcanic eruptions are taking place continuously. It is conceivable that due to the great depths and pressures of the geosynclines under the Atlantic volcanic eruptions quite different to the kind that created the Pacific atolls are taking place in this area. Fissures may be opening up in these uncharted depths and the fantastic pressure created by the hot gasses of the earth's core may be expelling chunks of radio-active densely magnetic material unlike anything known to man. This material would move with tremendous velocity, similar to a liquid-fueled rocket. When it broke the surface of the water, like a Polaris missile, it might act like a powerful cosmic ray in its attempts to change its electron balance. The effect of these rays on any plane that came within its magnetic field could short-circuit all electrical equipment. As the ignition system cut out, the plane would instantly lose all lift and plunge into a glide over which the pilot would have no control, as all electrical assists to the controls would also be dead this instantaneous power shut-off would also explain why no pilot was ever able to send out an S.O.S. even though some were in direct contact with ground controllers. The assumed explosions of planes in the air could be explained by the arcing of shorted electrical circuits igniting the gas vapors as they hit the magnetic field.<br>   Chunks of this radio-active material could shoot to the surface with the velocity of a hydrogen bomb and home in on the steel hulls of ships like the magnetic head of a torpedo, and with the same devastating results. It is conceivable that a ship hit with such atomic force could disintegrate completely, which explains why no survivors or floating wreckage is found. The peculiar phenomena of the ships that have been found afloat with no one aboard...can be explained by these eruptions, like all known volcanic eruptions, vary in magnitude and duration. These ships may have been bombarded with smaller fragments not powerful enough to sink the ship. The terrifying spectacle of these fire-bombs suddenly emerging from the sea and bombarding the ship would throw the crew into such a panic that they would immediately abandon ship. The boiling turbulence of the water, usually associated with a subterranean volcanic eruptions, coupled with the panic-stricken actions of the crew would preclude any hope of survivors from such a disaster.<br>  The remarks of the few radio operators who were able to describe what they saw before their sets went dead make no sense whatever, until you relate them to the fire-ball and water turbulence that a subterranean disturbance of this kind might create, then they make very good sense indeed and are perfectly logical.|`|NQnOw4Qbaa	Were it real I assure you that Lloyd's of London and other Marine insurers would make the premiums on ships traveling in this area so high that no commercial ship would travel in this area.<br>  The reports are nothing more than a string of anecdotes that one would expect to have collected over the course of several hundreds of years in one of the most heavily traveled areas of the world.

It was all good with him until you turned the table with a normal reciprocal expectation of active listening.  It is very sad to lose a friend over such a matter, and I am sorry this happened to you.  <br>  <br>  I think a lot more young heterosexual males are uncomfortable talking about gay relationships (even if it is only very brief) then you realize.  In fact, I think it is unusual for heterosexual males to be friends with homosexual males at all for fear they will be seen as gay also.  As men age and mature and are secure in who they are themselves, it is not such a big deal anymore.<br>  <br>  I wish you speedy emotional healing~~~~~~<br>  <br>  Edit:  You ask what you should do?

Who knows you may find a new friend who doesn't mind what your sexual orientation is and be willing to listen to every emotion you want to share - Life is dynamic and changes on a regular basis so go with the flow and find that person who will be a good listener - there are people out there, all you have to do is give them a chance
fdb2eb2f4c9344e092dc65cdb24a9c1eaa	The seven deadly sins in the Christian tradition were first compiled by Pope Gregory I around the year 600. They are pride, covetousness, lust, anger, gluttony, envy, and sloth. To oppose that, Gregory also compiled a list of the seven virtures: faith, hope, charity, justice, prudence, temperance, and fortitude.<br>  <br>  The Scripture would validate all of these concepts, but nowhere are they recorded in a list like this and nowhere in the Bible are they specifically referred to as the seven deadly sins or seven virtues.<br>  <br>  This is the closest the Bible comes in listing 7 deadly sins:<br>  <br>  “There are six things the Lord hates, seven that are detestable to him: haughty eyes, a lying tongue, hands that shed innocent blood, a heart that devises wicked schemes, feet that are quick to rush into evil, a false witness who pours out lies and a man who stirs up dissension among brothers” (Proverbs 6:16-19).|`|ZYrQXiwBaa	7 Deadly Sins in Roman Catholic Context:<br>  <br>  Sloth<br>  Envy<br>  Greed<br>  Lust<br>  Wrath<br>  ...<br>  ...<br>  <br>  uh, look at other people's answer for more.|`|FOzN3xwzaa	There is no "seven deadly sins" in the Bible.  Nowhere in the Bible are any specific and special ones called "deadly".  Rather, in the Bible, all sins are equal and all need you to believe in Jesus alone for salvation, to be forgiven of all sins.  And when you believe in Jesus alone for salvation, then you are forgiven ALL SINS past, present, and future  :) <br>  <br>  Only catholicism has a "seven deadly sins" teaching, but catholicism is false. <br>  <br>  The truth is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4).

I'm a very punctual person and sometimes I even try to get to a party late and I'm still the first one there!<br>  <br>  In cities especially, people think that getting to a party or other gathering late makes them seem more in-demand than others.

wdUhwD61aa	All the answers above are quite correct. <br>  Atlantis was said to be highly advanced for their time. They had flying machines, lasers and mirror technology (using natural light). These are all ideas HIGHLY evolved and frankly, did not reappear for many thousands of years. They were also said to have slightly "mythical" powers, using crystals and such for healing, which is, I guess, a form of advancement.<br>  <br>  It does mean they were very intelligent, yes. We still haven't figured some of that stuff out.<br>  <br>  But most importantly "chemengy" is right in saying that it is just a myth.

Most everything was done for them by machines. They didn't realize until too late that the Technocrat scientists had concluded a deal with renegade ET's from Sirius (the Son's of Belial) for control over them in exchange  for advanced technology and power. The Atlantians originally had 12 strand DNA activation. The renegades successfully took it down to 10 or 11 strands by genetic manipulation and they essentially forgot who they were. The ET's also attempted to destroy the star gate in the center of the planet but subsequently failed and it was moved to a secure location. The result was the destruction of the continent and all traces of it disappearing. The rest is history.Only recently have some been remembering their connection to the Atlantis program and are attempting to regain our proper place in the Universe and our true heritage.|`|mlI1YvCnaa	plato said that they had flying machines, they  where said to have the most advanced of civilizations with a powerful army and economy but they started to abuse nature and the gods destroyed them. there is no evidence that they every existed only stories. some greeks claimed that they where desended from Atlantis survivors, during world war two the germans theorized that the Atlantians where the first aryan race and that they later became Germans.|`|AA10065077	It has been said that they have had powerful armies and an economic system and they were very intelligent.

eb4e977a0cb9ce50b08bf74f0f3a0c61aa	1. There are no real vampires. Cut and paste time, as it is too much work to type this out over and over so here goes. A brief discussion of the human digestive system and then the probable vampire population given an exponential growth rate should explain why vampires are not possible. <br>  2. Vampires do not exist. Period. The human body is not designed to process large amounts of blood for nutrition. There is not enough protein, carbohydrates, and fats present in blood to maintain a complex creature such as Homo Sapiens or any theorized offshoot mutations. When a human ingests food it is first broken up by chewing, then churned up in the stomach with digestive juices to form a bolus called chyme. It then passes into the small intestine where it mixes with bile salts which continue breaking it down on a molecular basis, mostly affecting fats at this point. The broken down nutrients pass through the wall of the intestines and into the bloodstream where they are carried to each cell or stored for later use. Indigestible bulk continues through the intestines, turning a dark brown from the bile. Water is absorbed from this mass in the large intestine depending on the needs of the body - a well-hydrated person will usually have a softer stool than a dehydrated person will. Water also enters the bloodstream, and this is what helps to maintain blood pressure. The pressure tends to balance itself in a healthy person because the bloodstream goes through a formation in the kidney called the Loop of Henle, where the narrowing blood vessel forces excess water and cellular waste such as urea out through the cellular wall into the kidneys, where it is excreted through the ureters into the bladder, and then out of the body via the urethral passageway.<br>  <br>  3. IMPORTANT - A person physically unable to process his own food for nutrition therefore also could not process blood - it's the same process. Ingested blood does not transmit directly to the veins anyway - it would be chemically broken down by the digestive system.<br>  <br>  4. Theoretical ingestion of blood to supply these nutrients would therefore have to occur at least once a day, and would require the ingestion of the entire blood supply which could not happen as the stomach is far too small to hold that much liquid volume. Furthermore, such a mass would be difficult to pass thru the intestines as it has no fibrous bulk, would create an intestinal impaction, causing massive vomiting from the large concentration of iron present, and any "real" vampire would have to eventually expel the waste, which would come out as a black, tarry, smelly goo. <br>  <br>  5. These humans that affect the whole "vampiric lifestyle" are NOT vampires. They are simply humans playing their own little game, in their own little fantasy world, usually pandering to their own little sexual fetish, which may or may not actually be sexual. I too, play my own little game, in the SCA, but mine is a game where the deeds that I do are determined by the strength of my arm and sword - I am a warrior, with just as much skill and ability as any warrior of ancient times. The difference is that I am claiming to be something physically possible: a warrior, and I prove it everytime I strap on my armor and walk onto a SCA battlefield. The so-called "vampires" are claiming to be something physically impossible: a walking corpse, and all they prove is that black Victorian clothing, a pair of false fangs, and a little makeup make for a good Halloween costume - it does not make you a vampire.<br>  <br>  6. Even if a vampire feeds once a week, and his victim also becomes a vampire, that is exponential growth, with four iterations a month. First iteration: One makes one, total two. Second iteration: Two make two, total four. Third iteration: Four make four, total eight. Fourth iteration: Eight make eight, total sixteen. 16 vampires at the end of one month, 256 at the end of the second month, 4096 by the end of the third month, 65,536 by the end of the fourth month, 1,048,476 at the end of the fifth, and 33,572,832 vampires at the end of half a year! Do the math - vampires are a mathematical impossibility. This falls therefore, under the logic of Occam's Razor - which states that when you have removed every impossible answer, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth. Since there is no "vampiric plague" swarming the earth, the logical deduction is that they don't exist. <br>  <br>  7. Point of clarification about "vampire" bats: vampire is simply the name we have given them because they do drink blood, same as a flea, mosquito, or spider. Are these creatures vampires? No. They are living creatures, not legendary monsters. Drinking blood does not make you a vampire anymore than eating raw meat makes you a werewolf, although it might make you a mosquito.<br>  <br>  8.The humans who profess to be vampires are victims of an all-encompassing self induced delusion. They are as human as you or I, regardless of their claims, and if they ingest HIV tainted blood they can most certainly contract the disease, esp. if they have any cuts, sores, or lesions in and or around their mouth. It is a very dangerous delusion to be laboring under. Note that there is absolutely no scientific or medical proof that these people derive any benefit at all from the ingestion of blood, and even worse are the so-called "psychic" vampires, because their delusion is one that they cannot substantiate with any concrete evidence at all.|`|pRcqXCOqaa	Remember-- after having fun reading a fiction novel, and you enjoyed the fantasy, always back it up with gaining knowledge about the facts behind the fiction.<br>  Read about the true historical accounts of Vlad the Impaler, for example, or cults and such that actually involve drinking blood **yeeks**<br>  <br>  Some people are like vampires in so much as being around them too long seems to suck the life right out of you; had a boss like that some time ago :p|`|57bcedfde4d1ba1636af6297646b4281aa	i read a lot of question about these topics, vampires existence, are they real, and many more. my answer to this is a big NO, its only a mere of story whether in short fictions and films. i read about the true stories how the words spread about vampires. its in the book of the well known count dracula, looking for immortal life,kills people by putting a two hole on the victims neck by means of a rubber hose, throw his victims, drunk their blood. neighbors annoyed by the foul smell, reported it to the authorities, a good reporter/journalist came also, and got the good idea to made stories of blood suckers called vampires. the people during that time are more on suspicions and believers. to cut it short, no vampires, they dont exist.|`|pJxpdU5Zaa	Vampires do not exist, no matter how much an idiot wearing all black with Hot Topic lunchboxes and bad makeup will try to tell you otherwise.<br>  <br>  I see you possibly going down the path to awfulness, so I hope you pay attention. No matter how romantic and sexy books make vampirism out to be, you will not turn into one, and the people who claim they have, are smelly and annoying and nobody likes them. They will claim to like drinking blood, but are really only a.) transmitting diseases or b.) transmitting diseases.  They do not need it to live, and if anyone ever did consume the amount of blood squirting forth from a jugular vein, they would vomit uncontrollably. <br>  <br>  Drinking blood certainly leads to 1.)

CedS3x6aaa	Vampires are mythological or folkloric revenants who subsist by feeding on the blood of the living. In folkloric tales, the undead vampires often visited loved ones and caused mischief or deaths in the neighbourhoods they inhabited when they were alive. They wore shrouds and were often described as bloated and of ruddy or dark countenance, markedly different from today's gaunt, pale vampire which dates from the early Nineteenth Century. Although vampiric entities have been recorded in most cultures, the term vampire was not popularised until the early 18th century, after an influx of vampire superstition into Western Europe from areas where vampire legends were frequent, such as the Balkans and Eastern Europe,[1] although local variants were also known by different names, such as vrykolakas in Greece and strigoi in Romania. This increased level of vampire superstition in Europe led to what can only be called mass hysteria and in some cases resulted in corpses actually being staked and people being accused of vampirism.<br>  <br>  In modern times, however, the vampire is generally held to be a fictitious entity, although belief in similar vampiric creatures such as the chupacabra still persists in some cultures. Early folkloric belief in vampires has been ascribed to the ignorance of the body's process of decomposition after death and how people in pre-industrial societies tried to rationalise this, creating the figure of the vampire to explain the mysteries of death. Porphyria was also linked with legends of vampirism in 1985 and received much media exposure, but has since been largely discredited.<br>  <br>  |`|0a744eeed5bda2106205590a33ab8327aa	In Forks, Washington.|`|gexz9Dk8aa	Vampires are mythical creatures.

JWjq5iaXaa	A realistic zombie invasion? Well, to be honest, Left 4 Dead and 28 Days Later have the zombie idea down better than most every other zombie thing out there... thing is, zombies couldn't be literally "walking corpses", they would be some kind of infection that decays parts of the brain causing the human to see any moving, living creature as it's prey, and remove the logic to plot out a strategical attack against it... causing the "zombie" to sprint at whatever the victim is, with no caution to consequence, and devour it.<br>  <br>  What's the chance? Really, really low. A disease like that, completely unnatural (it's never happened before, has it?) would have had to be caused by humans... if scientists wanted to create a "zombie", they could sit in a lab for years with hundreds of human test subjects and eliminate key parts of the brain until the subject acts like a zombie from Left 4 Dead... but nobody has the time, the patience, or the freedom to do something like that. Plus, it has no benefit. If someone tried to create a cure and a "zombie" was the side effect... the cure/vaccination would be so intricate, it wouldn't be possible to create for hundreds of years.<br>  <br>  So to be perfectly honest, a zombie apocalypse couldn't happen for... at least a long time.

Soon enough. They will. Scientists have discovered that it is around its time for a zombie appocalypse to arrive. Which is when hell is full. We killed too many bad guys lately, sending them to hell. Than soon the zombie will be coming to earth. If you visit a graveyard, chances are zombies will pop out any time. No, they don't need brains, they eat flesh. Not brains. They will be coming soon. No doubt. Sorry to scare you but it is true. The only way to kill them is to shoot them in the head. But when you die during a zombie appocalypse than you will become a zombie because you are dead. You wont last very long. Zombies are anybody who ever ever ever died at all. So facing all the crawns who died, even animals, you will only have one way to kill them. It must be a silver-lead bullet, right into their soft spot of their head. They can jump super high, run super fast, etc. So all we can say, until then, relax. It is said the maximum of time we have is 18 to 20 years yet to live. Not much? I know, but just enjoy your life, because they said that is the maximum, meaning they could come before that. They can't have weapons or anything. Dawn of the Dead is exactly how they would be when they come to fall upon earth. If you haven't seen it than watch it. It explains it the best. Die at all, whether or not it is a zombie than you will become a zombie, uncontrolable against your actions. Just watch and hearing everything around you. When you die when your a zombie you will see pitch black. It sucks. I am only 28, I got my whole life to live yet!
Mqh3Lrjlaa	No.Prob not. <br>  <br>  People often misuse terminology. <br>  <br>  Ex: Racist is different than simply exhibiting racism (which everyone does). Racists take it to an extreme, usually openly. <br>  <br>  Bisexual is a more extreme term.... someone may exhibit something typically associated with bisexualism (maybe checking someone of the same sex out of jealousy...yet still attracted to the only opposite sex) <br>  <br>  There has to be a fine line somewhere...not so rigid to restrict, but with sufficient flexibility to argue.|`|SwreJuEkaa	I read somewhere that everyone is innately bisexual, even if it's so slight that you can live your whole live heterosexually without even thinking of/manifesting any feelings whatsoever towards the same sex.

ixqpmUVLaa	Ancient Egyptian Sexuality:  <br>  <br>   ...Revel in pleasure while your life endures<br>  And deck your head with myrrh. Be richly clad<br>  In white and perfumed linen; like the gods<br>  Anointed be; and never weary grow<br>  In eager quest of what your heard desires -<br>  Do as it prompts you... <br>  <br>  Sexuality in ancient Egypt was open, untainted by guilt. Sex was an important part of life - from birth to death and rebirth. Singles and married couples made love. The gods themselves were earthy enough to copulate. The Egyptians even believed in sex in the afterlife. Sex was not taboo... Even the Egyptian religion was filled with tales of adultery, incest, homosexuality and masturbation... with hints of necrophillia! Masculinity and femininity itself were strongly linked with the ability to conceive and bear children...

I don't remember any legends where she quarrelled with Artemis (though obviously it could be faulty memory) and that could explain why.

Rather they have changed Islam from it's original perfected form and thusly, innovated a way of life that leads to Hellfire. This is not a dispute between a trivial "this" and "that", it is a serious issue dealing with the difference between the Straight Path to Paradise and the crooked paths that lead to punishment in this life and the next. May Allaah rectify our condition and affairs.<br>  <br>  With regards to Shee'ism, then it is not the Islam that was taught by Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him. Rather, they are a group that have exaggerated the status of the noble family of the Prophet, peace be upon him, to the extent that they build shrines devoted to their worship along with Allaah. This is shirk, polytheism, the greatest crime a human being can commit in the sight of Allaah.<br>  <br>  The proper way to practice Islam is to follow the understanding of the Qur'aan and the Prophetic life example that was actually taught by Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, and actually lived by the Prophet, peace be upon him, his family, and his companions.<br>  <br>  All beliefs and acts of worship that oppose this way are affairs that lead away from Paradise and lead towards Hellfire.<br>  <br>  It is not permissible to worship Allaah with acts of worship that did not exist in the time of the Prophet, peace be upon him (such as pilgrimage to Karbala, calling upon 'Ali or other human beings for help who are dead or absent, building shrines dedicated to saints, etc...) And it is not permissible to interpret the Qur'aan with meanings that oppose what the Prophet, peace be upon him, actually taught.<br>  <br>  Remember, the main goal of every Muslim is to enter Paradise and to avoid torment in the Hellfire. The main goal is not unity in this life for the sake of "unity". If the Shee'ah have chosen for themselves a path to destruction, then it is not in any Muslim's interest to "unite" with them. Rather the sincere Muslim should advise them to return to the right guidance that Allaah created us and them for, and if they refuse, then other Muslims should be warned against falling into their severe errors. By this way, with Allaah's permission, we preserve the correct practice of Islam for ourselves and for future generations who seek to worship Allaah correctly.<br>  <br>  Whether the Shia' as a whole will repent and return to the Straight Path...? Allaah knows best. This splitting amongst the Muslims is a test from Allaah to see who will sincerely and correctly follow His religion. He guides whom He wills and He leaves to stray whom He wills and Allaah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.<br>  <br>  ADDITIONAL NOTE: "Fitnah" Makers?<br>  <br>  It is oppression to call a Muslim who clarifies the difference between true Islam and deviant ideologies a "fitnah" maker. The people responsible for making "fitnah" are those who alter the pure religion of Allaah and turn it to something that leads our brothers and sisters to Hell.<br>  <br>  If I knew someone who was in danger of being murdered, would I be considered a "fitnah" maker if I were to alert that person to danger? No. I would not be considered a fitnah maker, even if the murderer was a Muslim.<br>  <br>  And innovation in religion and the threat of Hellfire is more serious a danger to a person than murder and thusly a Muslim has more right to be warned against it in the clearest terms possible.|`|KqiiT1WSaa	I will say to you, Why is he hiding?<br>  <br>  I will say to you "no i will not pray that he appears, because he is not hiding, clearly we are not waiting for the same person, it is interesting to note that the dajjal and gog and mogog are hidden.

God divided Jews into 12 tribes, mmmmmmmmmm Jew is the keyword here.<br>  <br>  abou Al Mahdi<br>  <br>  There is no religious text to the effect that it is a religious duty to wait anxiously for him. Moreover, Muslims should not believe anyone claiming that he is Al-Mahdi unless there is clear evidence to that effect, as many people have claimed to be so. <br>  <br>  Thus, Muslims are required not to hasten to believe anyone claiming to be Al-Mahdi; they are to investigate and make sure of such a thing. <br>  <br>  There is no ruling in the Islamic Shari`ah that has to do with the emergence of Al-Mahdi. That is to say, Muslims are not to delay fulfilling religious duties like the congregational prayers or Jihad or applying penalties prescribed in Shari`ah, etc., until Al-Mahdi comes and guides them in that respect. Muslims are to lead their lives normally — worship Allah, go to work, reform their society, learn, teach, etc., and if Al-Mahdi appears and they make sure that he is truthful, they are to follow him. This was the attitude of the Companions and those who truly followed in their footsteps." <br>  <a href="http://www.islamonline.net/fatwa/english/FatwaDisplay.asp?hFatwaID=98315" rel="nofollow">http://www.islamonline.net/fatwa/english...</a><br>  <br>  @Edit<br>  you didnt answer!!<br>  <br>  you can do that if your religion say so, but as a Muslim I only pray that if I was a live at his time, that I will be in the right side.<br>  <br>  you know the "fitan" can creat a whole new religions and a whole new "holy" people to follow. and the amazing thing that the followers of the new religion start to think that they are following the new right religion, although they created it after the last right religon.<br>  <br>  so I can see how easily people get astray and go far from the teaching of the Holy Quran and the sunah.<br>  <br>  so, my only prayer now and for all times is as Allah says in the Holy Quran:<br>  <br>   (8.

ljzb6fZBaa	There are two reasons I can think of.<br>  <br>  First, it could be the children have wrong mindsets, especially if they grow up believing they are under a curse. This mindset may be influenced by their parents or people around them, or by erroneous legalistic teachings in their churches. So they may grow up, expecting bad things to happen to them. That is faith going in the wrong direction.<br>  <br>  Second, Pastor Prince shared about children who grew up under indulgent parents. These parents did not discipline their children properly, so the children may feel that they had to punish themselves if they feel guilty or have done wrong. There is a sense of justice in every human being - it is our conscience.<br>  <br>  Therefore, it is important to know and believe the love of God through the gospel of grace. When we believe Jesus has already borne the full punishment for all our sins, we will not feel the need to punish ourselves whenever we make mistakes. We will thank Jesus for His grace. We will also not expect bad things to happen to us. Instead, we will live life every day expecting good things to happen to us because we are the righteousness of God in Christ, and blessings are on the head of the righteous.

The Prophet, peace be upon him, taught us to protect our religion from those who would enter it and vainly try to corrupt it. The Muslims who defend the religion of Islam from the misinterpretations of the ignorant are trying their best to have the Muslims unite upon truth... not falsehood. So that the Muslims of the present and future will worship Allaah correctly upon clarity and not confusion.<br>  <br>  ---<br>  "Regarding the Shee'ah & the Correct Islamic Position Towards Them"<br>  <a href="http://abulhaarith.wordpress.com/category/the-raafidah-sheeah/" rel="nofollow">http://abulhaarith.wordpress.com/categor...</a><br>  ---<br>  The reason why the Shi'a are not accepted nor reconciled with is because they have introduced beliefs and practices into Islam that were never taught by the Prophet, peace be upon him, never taught by his family, or his companions. Rather they have changed Islam from it's original perfected form and thusly, innovated a way of life that leads to Hellfire. This is not a dispute between a trivial "this" and "that", it is a serious issue dealing with the difference between the Straight Path to Paradise and the crooked paths that lead to punishment in this life and the next. May Allaah rectify our condition and affairs.<br>  <br>  With regards to Shee'ism, then it is not the Islam that was taught by Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him. Rather, they are a group that have exaggerated the status of the noble family of the Prophet, peace be upon him, to the extent that they build shrines devoted to their worship along with Allaah. This is shirk, polytheism, the greatest crime a human being can commit in the sight of Allaah.<br>  <br>  The proper way to practice Islam is to follow the understanding of the Qur'aan and the Prophetic life example that was actually taught by Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, and actually lived by the Prophet, peace be upon him, his family, and his companions.<br>  <br>  All beliefs and acts of worship that oppose this way are affairs that lead away from Paradise and lead towards Hellfire.<br>  <br>  It is not permissible to worship Allaah with acts of worship that did not exist in the time of the Prophet, peace be upon him (such as pilgrimage to Karbala, calling upon 'Ali or other human beings for help who are dead or absent, building shrines dedicated to saints, etc...) And it is not permissible to interpret the Qur'aan with meanings that oppose what the Prophet, peace be upon him, actually taught.<br>  <br>  Remember, the main goal of every Muslim is to enter Paradise and to avoid torment in the Hellfire. The main goal is not unity in this life for the sake of "unity". If the Shee'ah have chosen for themselves a path to destruction, then it is not in any Muslim's interest to "unite" with them. Rather the sincere Muslim should advise them to return to the right guidance that Allaah created us and them for, and if they refuse, then other Muslims should be warned against falling into their severe errors. By this way, with Allaah's permission, we preserve the correct practice of Islam for ourselves and for future generations who seek to worship Allaah correctly.<br>  <br>  Whether the Shia' as a whole will repent and return to the Straight Path...? Allaah knows best. This splitting amongst the Muslims is a test from Allaah to see who will sincerely and correctly follow His religion. He guides whom He wills and He leaves to stray whom He wills and Allaah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.<br>  <br>  ADDITIONAL NOTE: "Fitnah" Makers?<br>  <br>  It is oppression to call a Muslim who clarifies the difference between true Islam and deviant ideologies a "fitnah" maker. The people responsible for making "fitnah" are those who alter the pure religion of Allaah and turn it to something that leads our brothers and sisters to Hell.<br>  <br>  If I knew someone who was in danger of being murdered, would I be considered a "fitnah" maker if I were to alert that person to danger? No. I would not be considered a fitnah maker, even if the murderer was a Muslim.<br>  <br>  And innovation in religion and the threat of Hellfire is more serious a danger to a person than murder and thusly a Muslim has more right to be warned against it in the clearest terms possible.

Sorry if it is not what you are looking for.<br>  <br>  1. In the fiction of J. R. R. Tolkien, E? is the Quenya language name for the universe, as a realization of the vision of the Ainur. The word comes from the Quenya word for to be. Thus, E? is the World that Is, as distinguished from the World that Is Not. It may thus be assumed that everything outside E?, including the Timeless Halls of Ilúvatar, has no material form.<br>  <br>  The Ainur, angelic beings from the Timeless Halls beyond E?, refer to it as "the Little Kingdom". This refers to the fact that within the mind of Eru Ilúvatar (God, in Tolkien's legendarium), all creation that humans can see is really just a tiny thing in comparison.<br>  <br>  E? was the word spoken by Eru Ilúvatar by which he brought the universe into actuality.<br>  <br>  2. In the fantasy world of Earthsea created by Ursula K. Le Guin, éa is an island in the Sea of éa, between Enlad and Havnor. According to the Earthsea creation myth, The Creation of éa, the island of éa was the first land raised by the creator, Segoy, above the waters.<br>  <br>  éa is also Sindarin for "Let it be!" and is used by Iluvatar, J. R. R. Tolkien's God-figure, to actually bring the world into existence. This is almost certainly a coincidence, as the Silmarillion was written long before A Wizard of Earthsea, but published afterwards.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Retrieved from "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E%C3%A4"|`|AA12185376	There isno God, but Jehovah|`|AA12391950	maybe the bible god is the same person<br>  <br>  Yah    EA<br>  <br>  They have the same sound.

The universe is god. All its parts atoms and molecules are part of the concept of a god that has no form. A god that cannot be seen. A god that is not in human form but the spirit of existence. This is said to be modern. But it is really not as parts of the concepts are in all religions but mankind's vanity or need for power intervenes.<br>  Ea and its variations seems to occur in many languages  past and present referring to god or spirit with different  but similar meanings|`|ad78c300295636b25876985bedb18bacaa	Enki was a deity in Sumerian mythology, later known as Ea in Babylonian mythology. The name Ea is of Sumerian origin and was written by means of two signs signifying "house" (E) and "water" (A/Ab)<br>  <br>  Enki was the deity of water, intelligence and creation. The main temple of Enki was the so-called é-engur-a, the "house of the lord of deep waters"; it was in Eridu, which was then located in the wetlands of the Euphrates valley not far from the Persian Gulf. He was the keeper of the holy powers called Me, the gifts of civilised living. Enki is also the master shaper of the world, God of wisdom and of all magic. The exact meaning of his name is not sure: the common translation is "Lord of the Earth": the Sumerian en is translated as "lord", was originally a title given to the High Priest; ki means "earth"; but there are theories that ki in this name has another origin, possibly kur (= mound). In this way it is just possible that in origin Enki was a divinitized human, high priest of the mound of Eridu, on which the first Sumerian temple was built.<br>  <br>  He is the lord of the Apsu (Akkadian, Abzu in Sumerian, hence Greek and English Abyss) , the fresh-water ocean of groundwater under the earth. His name is possibly an epithet bestowed on him for the creation of the first man, Adamah or Adapa. His symbols included a goat and a fish, symbols at the opposite ends of the year (Pisces and Capricorn) which later combined into a single beast, the Capricorn, which became one of the signs of the zodiac. Enki in Sumerian astronomy also represented the planet Mercury, known for its ability to shift rapidly, and its proximity to the Sun, Sumerian Utu, Akkadian Shamash, the God of Justice.<br>  <br>  In character Enki is not a joker or trickster God, he is never a cheat, a fool nor a shapeshifter. Enki uses his magic for the good of others when called upon to help either a God, a Goddess or a Human. Enki is always true to his own essence as a masculine nurturer. He is fundamentally a trouble-shooter God, and avoids or disarms those who bring conflict and death to the world. He is the mediator whose compassion and sense of humour breaks and disarms the wrath of his stern half-brother, Enlil, king of the Gods. He is the Challenger who tests the limits of Inanna in the myth Enki and Inanna and the Me and then concedes graciously his defeat by the young goddess of Love and War, by strengthening the bonds between Eridu and her city of Uruk. So he becomes the Empowerer of Inanna. Enki is always direct and upfront. Enki does not hide, or have any hidden agenda.<br>  <br>  Enki has been said to be:<br>  <br>  "The most complete and modern mirror of masculine wholeness in Mesopotamia and world religion. His values and attributes are timeless, and it is not surprising to see that He is one of the most beloved gods of Mesopotamia. How can He be so whole? Because in Him the passionate and joyous Lover, the Mystic, the Strategist, the Sorcerer, the Divine Manager, the Keeper of World Order and Rescuer of Humankind and Gods alike are all One. <br>  Enki is ... the gallant, impetuous, energetic Lord of Wisdom, the Seeker after truth, and Master Adept in sorcery, enchantment and seduction."

1CS2KR7Taa	Spirituality is not a belief system, not philosophy, and it is not theoretical.<br>  Spirituality is a practical method.<br>  We go through a number of stages, and we can only progress if we actually attain those stages, which means they become a part of us, "we feel them in our bones". It is not about faith, we actually gain knowledge, clear sensation of those stages. Everything we feel changes us, it is happening inside of us.<br>  Let us say that at the moment we are at the lowest level, in our confused material state.<br>  As we progress in spirituality we climb higher and higher like walking up on a ladder, or a mountain and as we acquire a higher viewing point we can see more and more of the "whole picture" and understand the connections between the pieces more.<br>  I hope you find this helpful, all the best.|`|6dL7UGvfaa	Experiencing the unity(connectedness) of all that exist - animate and inanimate - and the flow of love through all and be it.|`|xw55lwscaa	Be in the religious practice of what you believe.<br>  The word spirit is used in a very disturbing way many of the times I see it used its used in the wrong format.

Disobedience comes from ignorance and they know the truth but choose not to follow that path but to go against what they are feel are "right".|`|C33dNHSDaa	You hit the nail on the head !!!!|`|5KUMqyh4aa	i guess i wont to disobey it in a sense, i dont wont to stone children to death, have slavery, kill homosexuals and atheists ect.|`|02058623dad3c9e668fead1c22fd3706aa	yes, people like that, need its guidence, take the books from these people, and imagine the carnage.|`|3uiIrxojaa	No they question the bible because they don't get what it says|`|AA10493307	Bingo.  <br>  <br>  Most people do not like to keep the ten commandments, particularly the 4th commandment.|`|UWKF7x4faa	You picked Fred Flintstone because your mind is still in the Stone Age|`|wuPTBIIuaa	nope, not all the time!<br>  <br>  i question the bible where there is plausible doubt. <br>  <br>  just today i posted a question about genesis 19:39 (jst). <br>  <br>  in the jst (joseph smith translation) the workd "wicked" is somehow deleted. this verse is a naration of Lott and his daughters and drinking wine and being drugged and raped for the case of "raising righteous seed".|`|d7c8ecd624fbbc0797b1502ba6682e8baa	Only people who don't question the Bible think it is intelligible enough to be followed without contradicting something. The morass of contradictions, absurdities and blatant falsehoods make "obeying" it as a text impossible.|`|g4AAZRuxaa	Probably.|`|ifSWXqU5aa	Yes, it's because the like sin and don't want to submit to authority.|`|7YTiooX5aa	What was your first clue Sherlock?!?!!|`|UyDkYaXuaa	Wilma needs to beat you|`|xWi4ua0Iaa	We question all superstitious nonsense.  <br>  <br>  But what is it do you think we are "questioning"?  That it is a work of religious ideas that sprang up from the myriad religious ideas of the ancient Mediteranean world is something I don't question at all....but I bet your need for an exclusivist relationship makes you question the Bible when given that definition, doesn't it?  For you, it must be a single deity (irregardless of the contradictions and injustices) within a single work or the work is as useful as the Koran or the Iliad.<br>  <br>  <br>  And everybody should question anything that claims to be the from the mouth of a god and yet does not hold the concept of Justice above all things.|`|XqS5DxR9aa	I don't question the bible.  I give it as much respect as I do any other comic book.  My personal preference is Spiderman, though.|`|AA12044219	Partially,but people without the Holy Spirit dont and cant understand it so they question it. Unless your saved you cant be filled with the Holy Spirit.|`|2ogimlBxaa	It's never good to blindly follow something.|`|gHSarVD1aa	Yes.<br>  And what I find amazing is that many people do not realize why they believe or don't believe what they do.|`|69750f25faea5e6021c54c23d0dcb774aa	That doesn't even make sense.

Don't care what other people think of your height, it's just the way you are, how are you supposed to change it? They can **** off, okay?|`|X4LcP1Zjaa	I don't hate short people, excluding the part where even I am short. <br>  I don't let them people call me names and affect the way I am.<br>  God made us this way, and God knows that we have the wisdom<br>  to let them know that, we are who we are.|`|OiJGi6ltaa	I used to get it back in high school, etc.  (Which has been...15 years now?  Oi!)  I was the skinny little Asian kid at Neanderthal High.  I started carrying a baseball bat with the intent to use it on anyone who gave me any more physical grief.  I never had to use it.  My whole attitude changed when I decided I wasn't going to be bothered by those people who were abusive toward me.<br>  <br>  Now, being short still gets me grief.  Most people still live in the animal kingdom and don't connect to their brains very easily.  Taller people will generally treat you with less respect, just because that's the way it works in nature.  I have to remind them regularly--sometimes very forcefully--that we are not in the animal kingdom.  <br>  <br>  Sooner or later you'll have to stand up for yourself.  I recommend knives, they are easily concealed and deployed.  Think I'm joking?  If someone is going to physically assault you, YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO DEFEND YOURSELF.  Get used to the idea, be willing to take action.  I'll bet that your confidence will move into that next tier and you can become an actualized human being rather than just thinking of yourself as the "shorty."  (Though it takes years to build that kind of confidence, don't expect an overnight metamorphosis.)  Now, I'm not saying you should get violent...that eventually doesn't work out (because you're the short one)...but when people perceive that you aren't going to put up with their crap, I guarantee a lot of your problems won't come up anymore.<br>  <br>  I know my method and thinking seems crude, but it's not criminal to defend yourself against an assault.  People who can't deal on a human-to-human basis are part of the animal kingdom, and humans have always dealt with feral animals in the same way for all of history.|`|88pD8W8Saa	its NOT okay o.o<br>  dont let the people treat you like that <br>  showem whos the boss <br>  get some attitude girl <br>  but i dont understand why they treat you like that <br>  here where i live the short girls are the most wanted <br>  :/|`|srlUNQrIaa	really? spat on? thats a bit extreme...<br>  im 5ft 1, and i get nothing! yeah the occasional "your very small" but thats about it really.<br>  Im sorry you've had to go through all that|`|sJZXhPxyaa	omg! that's not okay!  i don't know anyone who gets mistreated because they're short. they're jealous amazons i guess..|`|3uiIrxojaa	Why do you hate fat people?|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	I have never noticed that happen to any of my short friends. <br>  <br>  Maybe you are just running into rude women who are jealous of you.<br>  <br>  Edit: Some of the toughest women I have noticed are short! Be tough and have a temper to those who defy you.|`|QW4jdXGjaa	Well, that sucks for you, but don't say, "Why do you hate short people?" Don't group me with any of the people who did those things, because it doesn't matter to me how tall or short anyone is. It's not okay to treat someone like that. They probably did it because they thought you were small and wouldn't be able to do anything to defend yourself. They just wanted to feel bigger about themselves, so they mistreated someone who has a smaller size in comparison.

AA12315713	No <br>  Christians worship the one true God. Christian God says love your enemys muslim god says kill|`|AA12357988	Yes.  No matter what name you give to your god or goddess, we all worship the same one.|`|AA10759923	no; they do not worship the same god. Muslims deny their god has a son, which makes their god different.|`|AA11168158	It depends on what you mean by the same God. There are multiple ways to identify the same God. For example, after the 2000 election, Al Gore actually won the majority vote of the United States, but George Bush won the majority of Electoral College votes. What if we had two groups of American citizens that broke apart at that point? What if one of them, calling themselves the Constitutional Party, had claimed to follow the president, under the terms that are laid out in the United States Constitution, and the other group called themselves the Majority Party and claimed to follow the president under the Majority Rules "common sense" rule? Well, both of them claim to follow the president, but they don't follow the same person. Neither allows for more than one president to exist, and neither recognizes the others method of determining the president as valid.<br>  <br>  Muslims believe that Jesus is a prophet, Christians believe that Christ is the Son of God. Muslims believe that God can't have a Son, Christians believe that God must have a Son. These are two different ways of determining the characteristics of God, and are opposed to each other in a way that is irreconcilable. If one of them is right, the other is wrong. There is no way that God both can't have a Son, and must have a Son. In fact, the very idea that God can't have a Son is put into the Quran as a criticism of Christian belief in the Son of God.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, both Christians and Muslims (and Jews, for that matter) claim to follow the God of Abraham. Obviously, as I said above, if one is right, the other is wrong. But they both identify the God of Abraham with the God they worship, and both admit that Abraham had only one God. So it then falls to figure out which is correct, Christianity or Islam.|`|AA11333633	No, it is not the same God.<br>  <br>  Just read a little on both and you will quickly see a difference.|`|AA11805224	Allah had no son, Jehovah had a son named Jesus, these are not the same.|`|AA11875413	You're right.  They do believe in the same god, and so do the Jews.  The Jews don't really get into the whole "favored child mess" (I love that, btw!), but the Christians and Muslims have had a tendency over the years to try to drag them in (or down), too.|`|7723b3bd602d0aee497e5094d3595491aa	There is only one truth and There is only one creator for this world. So can say one thing and the other can beilve in other thing. But dont forget there is only one truth.|`|8730c7b5c74fce76a676cebb66c95f11aa	The discussion should probably start at the beginning and that would be... "Is there a God?". The most important and crucial point is not a trivial matter.<br>  <br>  If there was a God what are the attributes and characteristics attributed to God? God must have some attributes like All-Knowing, which I have seen posted here. <br>  <br>  Identification of the Creator is the most important step in determining if God exists. Then after you have keep attributes in place you can identify which religion is correct.<br>  <br>  Net S, I believe if you start counting the body bags... Christians have killed more people in the last 100 years than all of the other religions combined in their histories... Talk about which God commands his followers to kill...|`|AA10159017	I think the answer is in the very first line of your question.  "Christians" - by definition - worship "Christ"; afterall, that's what at the beginning of the title "Christian".  We believe that Jesus was the Son of God.  By asking Jesus to forgive us of all the wrongs we did and asking him to direct our lives from now on, we're saying that the only way to make us acceptable to God is through Jesus - the "Christ".<br>  <br>  You are correct when you say that Muslims do worship the same "God" as Christians do.  Remember that Jews do the same thing.  So you have three groups that all worship God, but the method of being made acceptable to God is what's different.<br>  <br>  Christians believe that the Old Testament continually pointed to the need for a Savior - a "Christ".  So when Jesus comes along in the New Testament, we read about things he did, words he said, and events that happened that all say that the only true and single way to be made acceptable to God is through Jesus.<br>  <br>  Any Muslim, any Jew, or any other person who tries to be made acceptable to God in any other way is just not seeing the full picture.  God said that Jesus was the way to be acceptable, so I'm sticking with that.|`|AA10484153	This is a most excellent question, and when it comes to worshipping God, they claim an Allah who sent a prophet that was not a prophet at all, so what does that make their God?  Highly questionable.  So, no, I, as a Christian, not of a religious order, but as  a believer in Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who has said that no man comes to the Father but by Him, and requires a personal relationship with us, not a religious rigaramoor find that the children of Abraham were told the same thing we find prevalent today - Ishmael was told he would be made into a great nation that would be at enmity with God while Isaac was told he would be made into a great nation that would stand to inherit eteral life in the presence of God.  So, I don't believe there ever was a commond ground set up for the two children of Abraham other than they would both be great nations, continually warring over which one truly had the covenant of God.|`|AA11470038	It is the same God.  And so do the Jews, Baha'i, & other religions.  I believe that all religions worship the same higher power (makes the most sense to me), but the Muslims, Christians, Jews & Baha'i all come for the same base and area, similar scripture, same God.|`|AA12082935	NO NO NO, we do not worship the same God!!!|`|AA12277219	finally there is only one GOD for all|`|AA11292993	jesus is a real muslim ,jusus from a virgin very high women (maryam)  , he is alive now and he wait for god command to comming this is clearly blieve near to muslim <br>  isalm have acknowledge jesus and bible <br>  allah = god = yahova = yazdan =khoda <br>  isalm continued way of chiristian <br>  some detail no mater  god (allah ) was ,is ,will uniqe this is a golden key for muslim and chiritian and jew <br>  regard|`|AA11668254	if we worshiped allah ,,we would not be able to answer this question.<br>  we would be busy figuring out ways to cause some more wars or blow some humans up.
AA11034076	Yes she, peace be upon her, is.

Verily, Allah has chosen you, purified you (from polytheism and disbelief), and chosen you above the women of the 'Alam?n (mankind and jinn) (of her lifetime)."|`|AA10393788	yes|`|AA11301249	God, the Most Compassionate, mentioned the story of JESUS in specific chapter in the Holy Quran which is called ((MARY chapter)) and this chapter consists of 98 verses.<br>  By the way the Holy Quran consists of 114 chapters. I will let you now to read the chapter of MARY ………….<br>  <br>  Surah (chapter) 19. Mary<br>  <br>  1. Kaf. Ha. Ya. 'Ain. Sad. <br>  2. (This is) a recital of the Mercy of thy Lord to His servant Zakariya. <br>  3. Behold! he cried to his Lord in secret, <br>  4. Praying: "O my Lord! infirm indeed are my bones, and the hair of my head doth glisten with grey: but never am I unblest, O my Lord, in my prayer to Thee! <br>  5. "Now I fear (what) my relatives (and colleagues) (will do) after me: but my wife is barren: so give me an heir as from Thyself,- <br>  6. "(One that) will (truly) represent me, and represent the posterity of Jacob; and make him, O my Lord! one with whom Thou art well-pleased!" <br>  7. (His prayer was answered): "O Zakariya! We give thee good news of a son: His name shall be Yahya: on none by that name have We conferred distinction before." <br>  8. He said: "O my Lord! How shall I have a son, when my wife is barren and I have grown quite decrepit from old age?" <br>  9. He said: "So (it will be) thy Lord saith, 'that is easy for Me: I did indeed create thee before, when thou hadst been nothing!'" <br>  10. (Zakariya) said: "O my Lord! give me a Sign." "Thy Sign," was the answer, "Shall be that thou shalt speak to no man for three nights, although thou art not dumb." <br>  11. So Zakariya came out to his people from him chamber: He told them by signs to celebrate Allah.s praises in the morning and in the evening. <br>  12. (To his son came the command): "O Yahya! take hold of the Book with might": and We gave him Wisdom even as a youth, <br>  13. And piety (for all creatures) as from Us, and purity: He was devout, <br>  14. And kind to his parents, and he was not overbearing or rebellious. <br>  15. So Peace on him the day he was born, the day that he dies, and the day that he will be raised up to life (again)! <br>  16. Relate in the Book (the story of) Mary, when she withdrew from her family to a place in the East. <br>  17. She placed a screen (to screen herself) from them; then We sent her our angel, and he appeared before her as a man in all respects. <br>  18. She said: "I seek refuge from thee to ((Allah)) Most Gracious: (come not near) if thou dost fear Allah." <br>  19. He said: "Nay, I am only a messenger from thy Lord, (to announce) to thee the gift of a holy son. <br>  20. She said: "How shall I have a son, seeing that no man has touched me, and I am not unchaste?" <br>  21. He said: "So (it will be): Thy Lord saith, 'that is easy for Me: and (We wish) to appoint him as a Sign unto men and a Mercy from Us':It is a matter (so) decreed." <br>  22. So she conceived him, and she retired with him to a remote place. <br>  23. And the pains of childbirth drove her to the trunk of a palm-tree: She cried (in her anguish): "Ah! would that I had died before this! would that I had been a thing forgotten and out of sight!" <br>  24. But (a voice) cried to her from beneath the (palm-tree): "Grieve not! for thy Lord hath provided a rivulet beneath thee; <br>  25. "And shake towards thyself the trunk of the palm-tree: It will let fall fresh ripe dates upon thee. <br>  26. "So eat and drink and cool (thine) eye. And if thou dost see any man, say, 'I have vowed a fast to ((Allah)) Most Gracious, and this day will I enter into not talk with any human being'" <br>  27. At length she brought the (babe) to her people, carrying him (in her arms). They said: "O Mary! truly an amazing thing hast thou brought! <br>  28. "O sister of Aaron! Thy father was not a man of evil, nor thy mother a woman unchaste!" <br>  29. But she pointed to the babe. They said: "How can we talk to one who is a child in the cradle?" <br>  30. He said: "I am indeed a servant of Allah. He hath given me revelation and made me a prophet; <br>  31. "And He hath made me blessed wheresoever I be, and hath enjoined on me Prayer and Charity as long as I live; <br>  32. "(He) hath made me kind to my mother, and not overbearing or miserable; <br>  33. "So peace is on me the day I was born, the day that I die, and the day that I shall be raised up to life (again)"! <br>  34. Such (was) Jesus the son of Mary: (it is) a statement of truth, about which they (vainly) dispute. <br>  35. It is not befitting to (the majesty of) Allah that He should beget a son. Glory be to Him! when He determines a matter, He only says to it, "Be", and it is. <br>  36. Verily Allah is my Lord and your Lord: Him therefore serve ye: this is a Way that is straight. <br>  37. But the sects differ among themselves: and woe to the unbelievers because of the (coming) Judgment of a Momentous Day! <br>  38. How plainly will they see and hear, the Day that they will appear before Us! but the unjust today are in error manifest! <br>  39. But warn them of the Day of Distress, when the matter will be determined: for (behold,) they are negligent and they do not believe! <br>  40. It is We Who will inherit the earth, and all beings thereon: to Us will they all be returned. <br>  41. (Also mention in the Book (the story of) Abraham: He was a man of Truth, a prophet. <br>  42. Behold, he said to his father: "O my father! why worship that which heareth not and seeth not, and can profit thee nothing? <br>  43. "O my father! to me hath come knowledge which hath not reached thee: so follow me: I will guide thee to a way that is even and straight. <br>  44. "O my father! serve not Satan: for Satan is a rebel against ((Allah)) Most Gracious. <br>  45. "O my father! I fear lest a Penalty afflict thee from ((Allah)) Most Gracious, so that thou become to Satan a friend." <br>  46. (The father) replied: "Dost thou hate my gods, O Abraham? If thou forbear not, I will indeed stone thee: Now get away from me for a good long while!" <br>  47. Abraham said: "Peace be on thee: I will pray to my Lord for thy forgiveness: for He is to me Most Gracious. <br>  48. "And I will turn away from you (all) and from those whom ye invoke besides Allah. I will call on my Lord: perhaps, by my prayer to my Lord, I shall be not unblest." <br>  49. When he had turned away from them and from those whom they worshipped besides Allah, We bestowed on him Isaac and Jacob, and each one of them We made a prophet. <br>  50. And We bestowed of Our Mercy on them, and We granted them lofty honour on the tongue of truth. <br>  51. Also mention in the Book (the story of) Moses: for he was specially chosen, and he was an apostle (and) a prophet. <br>  52. And we called him from the right side of Mount (Sinai), and made him draw near to Us, for mystic (converse). <br>  53. And, out of Our Mercy, We gave him his brother Aaron, (also) a prophet. <br>  54. Also mention in the Book (the story of) Isma'il: He was (strictly) true to what he promised, and he was an apostle (and) a prophet. <br>  55. He used to enjoin on his people Prayer and Charity, and he was most acceptable in the sight of his Lord. <br>  56. Also mention in the Book the case of Idris: He was a man of truth (and sincerity), (and) a prophet: <br>  57. And We raised him to a lofty station. <br>  58. Those were some of the prophets on whom Allah did bestow His Grace,- of the posterity of Adam, and of those who We carried (in the Ark) with Noah, and of the posterity of Abraham and Israel of those whom We guided and chose. Whenever the Signs of ((Allah)) Most Gracious were rehearsed to them, they would fall down in prostrate adoration and in tears. <br>  59. But after them there followed a posterity who missed prayers and followed after lusts soon, then, will they face Destruction,- <br>  60. Except those who repent and believe, and work righteousness: for these will enter the Garden and will not be wronged in the least,- <br>  61. Gardens of Eternity, those which ((Allah)) Most Gracious has promised to His servants in the Unseen: for His promise must (necessarily) come to pass. <br>  62. They will not there hear any vain discourse, but only salutations of Peace: And they will have therein their sustenance, morning and evening. <br>  63. Such is the Garden which We give as an inheritance to those of Our servants who guard against Evil. <br>  64. (The angels say:) "We descend not but by command of thy Lord: to Him belongeth what is before us and what is behind us, and what is between: and thy Lord never doth forget,- <br>  65. "Lord of the heavens and of the earth, and of all that is between them; so worship Him, and be constant and patient in His worship: knowest thou of any who is worthy of the same Name as He?" <br>  66. Man says: "What! When I am dead, shall I then be raised up alive?" <br>  67. But does not man call to mind that We created him before out of nothing? <br>  68. So, by thy Lord, without doubt, We shall gather them together, and (also) the Evil Ones (with them); then shall We bring them forth on their knees round about Hell; <br>  69. Then shall We certainly drag out from every sect all those who were worst in obstinate rebellion against ((Allah)) Most Gracious. <br>  70. And certainly We know best those who are most worthy of being burned therein. <br>  71. Not one of you but will pass over it: this is, with thy Lord, a Decree which must be accomplished. <br>  72. But We shall save those who guarded against evil, and We shall leave the wrong-doers therein, (humbled) to their knees. <br>  73. When Our Clear Signs are rehearsed to them, the Unbelievers say to those who believe, "Which of the two sides is best in point of position? Which makes the best show in council?" <br>  74. But how many (countless) generations before them have we destroyed, who were even better in equipment and in glitter to the eye? <br>  75. Say: "If any men go astray, ((Allah)) Most Gracious extends (the rope) to them, until, when they see the warning of Allah (being fulfilled) - either in punishment or in (the approach of) the Hour,- they will at length realise who is worst in position, and (who) weakest in forces! <br>  76. "And Allah doth advance in guidance those who seek guidance: and the things that endure, Good Deeds, are best in the sight of thy Lord, as rewards, and best in respect of (their) eventual return." <br>  77. Hast thou then seen the (sort of) man who rejects Our Signs, yet says: "I shall certainly be given wealth and children?" <br>  78. Has he penetrated to the Unseen, or has he taken a contract with ((Allah)) Most Gracious? <br>  79. Nay! We shall record what he says, and We shall add and add to his punishment. <br>  80. To Us shall return all that he talks of and he shall appear before Us bare and alone. <br>  81. And they have taken (for worship) gods other than Allah, to give them power and glory! <br>  82. Instead, they shall reject their worship, and become adversaries against them. <br>  83. Seest thou not that We have set the Evil Ones on against the unbelievers, to incite them with fury? <br>  84. So make no haste against them, for We but count out to them a (limited) number (of days). <br>  85. The day We shall gather the righteous to ((Allah)) Most Gracious, like a band presented before a king for honours, <br>  86. And We shall drive the sinners to Hell, like thirsty cattle driven down to water,- <br>  87. None shall have the power of intercession, but such a one as has received permission (or promise) from ((Allah)) Most Gracious. <br>  88. They say: "((Allah)) Most Gracious has begotten a son!" <br>  89. Indeed ye have put forth a thing most monstrous! <br>  90. At it the skies are ready to burst, the earth to split asunder, and the mountains to fall down in utter ruin, <br>  91. That they should invoke a son for ((Allah)) Most Gracious. <br>  92. For it is not consonant with the majesty of ((Allah)) Most Gracious that He should beget a son. <br>  93. Not one of the beings in the heavens and the earth but must come to ((Allah)) Most Gracious as a servant. <br>  94. He does take an account of them (all), and hath numbered them (all) exactly. <br>  95. And everyone of them will come to Him singly on the Day of Judgment. <br>  96. On those who believe and work deeds of righteousness, will ((Allah)) Most Gracious bestow love. <br>  97. So have We made the (Qur'an) easy in thine own tongue, that with it thou mayest give Glad Tidings to the righteous, and warnings to people given to contention. <br>  98.

On the other hand, the deaths produced by more than 500 ostensibly Christian undertakings of religious warfare or internal persecution, such as the Inquisition, the Crusades, and witch burnings, amount to only one percent of the body count accumulated by the atheistic ideologies of Stalin, Mao, and Hitler.

He is called Pope (Greek pappas, a child's word for father) because his authority is supreme and because it is to be exercised in a paternal way, after the example of Christ.<br>  <br>  Peter is the Rock on which the Church is Built<br>  Mark 3:16; John 1:42 – Jesus renames Simon "Kepha" in Aramaic which literally means "rock." This was an extraordinary thing for Jesus to do, because "rock" was not even a name in Jesus' time. Jesus did this, not to give Simon a strange name, but to identify his new status among the apostles. When God changes a person's name, He changes their status. <br>  <br>  Gen. 17:5; 32:28; 2 Kings 23:34; Acts 9:4; 13:9 - for example, in these verses, we see that God changes the following people's names and, as a result, they become special agents of God: Abram to Abraham; Jacob to Israel, Eliakim to Jehoiakim, Saul to Paul.<br>  <br>  2 Sam. 22:2-3, 32, 47; 23:3; Psalm 18:2,31,46; 19:4; 28:1; 42:9; 62:2,6,7; 89:26; 94:22; 144:1-2 - in these verses, God is also called "rock." Hence, from these verses, non-Catholics often argue that God, and not Peter, is the rock that Jesus is referring to in Matt. 16:18. This argument not only ignores the plain meaning of the applicable texts, but also assumes words used in Scripture can only have one meaning. This, of course, is not true. For example:<br>  <br>  1 Cor. 3:11 - Jesus is called the only foundation of the Church, and yet in Eph. 2:20, the apostles are called the foundation of the Church. Similarly, in 1 Peter 2:25, Jesus is called the Shepherd of the flock, but in Acts 20:28, the apostles are called the shepherds of the flock. These verses show that there are multiple metaphors for the Church, and that words used by the inspired writers of Scripture can have various meanings. Catholics agree that God is the rock of the Church, but this does not mean He cannot confer this distinction upon Peter as well, to facilitate the unity He desires for the Church.<br>  <br>  Matt. 16:18 - Jesus said in Aramaic, you are "Kepha" and on this "Kepha" I will build my Church. In Aramaic, "kepha" means a massive stone, and "evna" means little pebble. Some non-Catholics argue that, because the Greek word for rock is "petra", that "Petros" actually means "a small rock", and therefore Jesus was attempting to diminish Peter right after blessing him by calling him a small rock. Not only is this nonsensical in the context of Jesus' blessing of Peter, Jesus was speaking Aramaic and used "Kepha," not "evna." Using Petros to translate Kepha was done simply to reflect the masculine noun of Peter. <br>  <br>  Moreover, if the translator wanted to identify Peter as the "small rock," he would have used "lithos" which means a little pebble in Greek. Also, Petros and petra were synonyms at the time the Gospel was written, so any attempt to distinguish the two words is inconsequential. Thus, Jesus called Peter the massive rock, not the little pebble, on which He would build the Church. (You don’t even need Matt. 16:18 to prove Peter is the rock because Jesus renamed Simon “rock” in Mark 3:16 and John 1:42!).<br>  <br>  Matt. 16:17 - to further demonstrate that Jesus was speaking Aramaic, Jesus says Simon "Bar-Jona." The use of "Bar-Jona" proves that Jesus was speaking Aramaic. In Aramaic, "Bar" means son, and "Jonah" means John or dove (Holy Spirit).  See Matt. 27:46 and Mark 15:34 which give another example of Jesus speaking Aramaic as He utters in rabbinical fashion the first verse of Psalm 22 declaring that He is the Christ, the Messiah. This shows that Jesus was indeed speaking Aramaic, as the Jewish people did at that time. <br>  <br>  Matt. 16:18 - also, in quoting "on this rock," the Scriptures use the Greek construction "tautee tee" which means on "this" rock; on "this same" rock; or on "this very" rock. "Tautee tee" is a demonstrative construction in Greek, pointing to Peter, the subject of the sentence (and not his confession of faith as some non-Catholics argue) as the very rock on which Jesus builds His Church. The demonstrative (“tautee”) generally refers to its closest antecedent (“Petros”).  Also, there is no place in Scripture where “faith” is equated with “rock.”<br>  <br>  Matt. 16:18-19 - in addition, to argue that Jesus first blesses Peter for having received divine revelation from the Father, then diminishes him by calling him a small pebble, and then builds him up again by giving him the keys to the kingdom of heaven is entirely illogical, and a gross manipulation of the text to avoid the truth of Peter's leadership in the Church. This is a three-fold blessing of Peter - you are blessed, you are the rock on which I will build my Church, and you will receive the keys to the kingdom of heaven (not you are blessed for receiving Revelation, but you are still an insignificant little pebble, and yet I am going to give you the keys to the kingdom).<br>  <br>  Matt. 16:18-19 – to further rebut the Protestant argument that Jesus was speaking about Peter’s confession of faith (not Peter|`|AA10192697	Is the Pope Benedict that you are referring to?

Did Martin Luther chop that verse out of your Bible, along with everything else he hacked out that didn't suit his man-made doctrines?

Y, Para llegar a estos sitios, it may be pointing to some requirements to get there.|`|AA12103830	Both forms are correct; however, you will use each depending on what you want to say. For example:<br>  <br>  Para llegar a estos sitios, tomas el taxi = To get to these places you take a taxi.<br>  <br>  Por llegar a estos sitios temprano, me tuve que levantar temprano = In order to get to these places early, I had to get up early<br>  <br>  PARA serves to indicate a purpose or goal.<br>  <br>  POR serves to justify an action.

AA12139805	Do you actually think someone Can answer that? Would you trust the answer? No one knows.|`|AA12296055	Yes and stop wondering.|`|AA11652304	It means that Adam and Eve is a fairy tale that's what it means. Our DNA can be traced back to pre humans living in South Africa.

Perth|`|AA12144449	yea pretty much|`|d3fadef1303b0e3f7c056d62797c862baa	God made them from the sand of the earth and they were created in his image<br>  so they sorta had the dna of God i guess|`|e56a50ad509db353bf37af6222663eb4aa	What was their DNA makeup? That of a human, presumably. Also, it would definitely be perfect, both complete and free of degradation in the genetic code. As a result, it is not unfeasible that ALL human life, with its complex and sometimes quite degraded DNA, emerged from two perfect (genetically speaking) people.|`|728ad832a4b0e8e5114f6f26c4463796aa	if adam and eve were the first and only beings then who were all those people not animals that cain went to live with and married one of them. the bible is always messed up stories|`|84441c4476dc5550adedd8b3634f6bdcaa	I think when the christians come to bury a died man,they said (from sand to sand,from ashs to ashs).<br>  i am asking you a question: <br>  how they say from sand to sand but the man they burying was just a sperm came from his father into his mother??<br>  i am answering the question:<br>  the point behind that statment is that the first created beings were Adam & Eva,God created them from sand|`|AA10027209	A-T G-C...just like us.<br>  <br>  Do you want the exact mapped genome?<br>  <br>  And Adam and Eve were the first HUMANS, not the first beings.<br>  God created all the plants and animals before man.|`|AA10484153	I've better things to be concerned with than DNA make up of Adam and Eve - like making sure my neighbor is clothed and fed - an act of love, like reading scriptures to an elderly woman down my street, an act of love - all the DNA in the world has no bearing on my Christianity and calling and faith in God - why do we get so busy about the things that do not really matter and forget what does?  Just wondering!|`|AA10866228	Adam was made from dust.  Eve was made from one of Adam's ribs.  So we are just dust and bone.  Hope that helps.|`|AA11100929	Yes, we inherited their DNA. That is why we grow old and die. It is similar to baking bread. When you make a  loaf of bread and the mold has a dent, then each loaf of bread thereafter has this imperfection or dent. So we have this same problem, imperfection that forces us to live a life of death. It is live a upwards countdown. But God will change all that in the near future. Thank goodness!!<br>  <br>  Revelation 21:4|`|AA12155300	The only parents that we have to be concerned with.  They were the first in our line of ancestary.  It is probably that others may have been created, but they died off or were destroyed.  there is evidence of humans prior to Adam.  They were called the first because of us they were the first-<br>  .|`|AA12277219	they were made of land; I don't know if they had DNA|`|3c53a5fe182a692dc0c3bea6d9afdec7aa	It doesn't matter......the whole thing doesn't matter..the only thing that does matter is what God does tell us in the bible.|`|4bd6b5bc01204fcd71078bf6fa10d8ddaa	they are just the first human beings but then they had 2 children and every since all the races were created from there... They say that from the family of "yshmael" there were the muslims, from another family there were the african americans, and from Issac there were the jews and so on.... so maybe Adam and Eve were the first ones but they gave birth to many other types of people and races....|`|AA10127946	The ***** do we know?|`|AA11324723	Adam and Eve were not the first created humans. But they were the first righteous seed that He created. DNA is something man has found in common with every living thing. I consider it a part of His fingerprint He left on us when we were made by His hands.|`|AA12361217	Not to be ude but ur acting like a science geek, im not sure about  that and if i were u i wouldnt trust anybody but GOD on that one, hes the only one who knows about that, he made them we didnt!!!|`|ee2f133fe8e25668e7ee05cb2308f13daa	How much sense does it make that all humans in the world came from those two beings?
