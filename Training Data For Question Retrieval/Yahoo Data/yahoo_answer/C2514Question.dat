20090130203533AAX0Qvo	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	I need more sleep.............?	I breath therefore I know that I exist.  Though the breaths I've been taking lately burn deep down within.  As I tear apart the dream of what may have once been, so far off now even squinting I can barely make it out.  I watch as each strand of the fabric of my soul burns slowly away.  Stripping away my tenderness, shattering my hopefulness. I stare in a trance as all around me, my whole existence crumbles so quickly away.  It's almost as if I were some sort of comedic routine elaborated to fulfill the emptiness of those whom seek reward in others sorrow.  Then again isn't that the definition of all mankind?  Triumph and terrify.  Those are the two virtues that hold ones ilk in these here parts.  Justify your worth and watch as those around you genuflect at your presence.  Grab hold of what you can, simply because it's there.  Now then, what if someone purposely pretending they had forsaken all their vises, left aside a deep secret. Let's say this secret knowledge continued to grow, continued to rise against the oppression it so strongly claws to get away from. At the same time it continues to torment its own mind despite the cry of its own justification.       I am so tired. I am so afraid. I am so alone...

Blush of my breath, catch   of my see—beautiful bird—It’s you.

20061021132230AAKUbst	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Que es la Inteligencia y dónde está?	Que es la Inteligencia.          Inteligencia Personal Consciente:       Es la capacidad de compresión, asociación interdisciplinar y poder de transformación propia y externa que nos permite satisfacer nuestras necesidades y evolucionar o resolver nuevos problemas.          Ha tres tipos de inteligencia pero solo una verdadera:       Semi-Inteligencia reduccionista, lógica, marcadamente memorística y escepticista, que se expresa a través del hemisferio cerebral izquierdo. Se mide con test que aportan el cociente intelectual convencional. Es la inteligencia que construye sofisticados significantes pero que ignora los significados profundos e interdisciplinares.       Semi-Inteligencia holista y creyente intuitiva, analógica emocional y artística que se expresa a través del hemisferio cerebral derecho. Es la inteligencia que conoce mucho de significados pero muy poco de significantes.       Inteligencia Integral, que se expresa a través de la fusión de ambas inteligencias a través de su integración mediante el cuerpo calloso cerebral y su mayor o menor número de fibras de asociación: de entre 50 a 800 millones o más según el grado de Inteligencia Integral.             Inteligencia vegetativa:       Es la inteligencia subconsciente y fisiológica-inmunológica que permite a nuestro cuerpo vivir y mantenerse como un organismo en simbiosis con el entorno.          Inteligencia ecológica y/o universal:       Es la inteligencia natural y evolutiva o “antrópica” del medio ambiente, que nos vitaliza y mantiene mediante la creación de leyes estables y precisas que permiten la formación, mantenimiento y desenvolvimiento del medio, flora y fauna, con su producción de alimento, agua, oxígeno, aire y los ritmos circadianos que actúan sobre nuestra piel, glándula pineal-hipotálamo interviniendo en la formación de hormonas sexuales, vitaminas y frecuencias lentas como la llamada resonancia Shuman, que armonizan nuestro cerebro, etc; además de por medios sutiles más energéticos, funcionales y subyacentes como los virtuales o bioenergéticos que entrelazan subconscientemente a todos los seres y cosas, haciendo de la tierra un sistema de sistemas u orgánico simbionte cuyo Todo holista es más que la suma de sus Partes.         La Inteligencia no está en las neuronas, aflora a través de estas.       Los estados de superposición se dan de forma natural en el vacío y nada hay en el espacio mensurable que pueda obligarlos casual o deterministamente a hacerles tomar una decisión; y eso, porque lo mensurable no llega a lo virtual sino cuando se transforma en virtual; por lo cual una vez que es virtual no obliga sino que propone...       Es que a caso no os dais cuenta que la inteligencia nunca puede ser causada o creada por ninguna neurona porque éstas son mensurables. Sólo lo puede hacer el vacío cuántico con sus pluriposibilidades energéticas virtuales libres con tendencia a existir, comunicando sus decisiones a los electrones y nucleones de los átomos de las neuronas, recepcionando éstas las decoherencias y sus consiguientes colapsos de función de onda que se han plasmado en microvariaciones gravitatorias y electromagnéticas que después se traducen en impulsos nerviosos electroquímicos.       ? Pero de dónde crees que nace la consciencia observadora???, tanto la personal como la universal.       Debes distinguir dos conciencias o inteligencias, ambas capaces mediante su poder consciente de observación, de decidir sobre la marcha…de los estados de superposición y sus pluriposibilidades virtuales. Tanto la inteligencia universal o la de una persona, que no es sino un reflejo de la totalidad y su orden implicado. Ambas inteligencias y consciencias tienen su origen en su propio espacio virtual aparejado a los electrones y nucleones; siendo éstos, el final mensurable de la correa discontinua de transmisión. Discontinua, porque entre los electrones y nucleones y los estados virtuales de superposición que los crean y dirigen no hay continuidad cuántica; es decir, mesurable.

I've learned so far that there are lot of things you have to be in order to make your dance look good; things like being loose, being energetic, accurate, defined, and smooth.       But what exactly is "smooth" and how is this achieved? Does it come with time and experience of dancing, or is it something you train your body to do?

20090130174818AAfrF95	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Which is a better prologue?	This:      Sometimes, when a thousand doors open, another two thousand shut. When you are stuck with disorders, such as Chronic Lying or Narcissism, it’s hard to tell the truth from distant fiction. Tragedies mesh into drama, and drama leads to, well, disaster.     Fairy tales usually don’t exist, but are even more part of fantasy when you’re stuck without anyone to believe in you, to tell you to keep going. All you get is awkward faces, and looks of severe doubt.     But for every opportunity lost, and every opportunity won, there is another opportunity waiting to be fought for.       **************************************...       Or:      Who knew, sometimes fairy tales do come true. The only problem I have with that, though, is that the GOOD part never comes true. People don’t stroll along one day and find their Prince Charming; yet are always capable to end up getting locked inside some nasty dungeon. (Rapunzel and Cinderella were lucky; they both got stuck in a beautiful castle. Like that’s going to happen in real life, seriously.)    Well, I guess I’d rather be stuck in a dungeon rather than be sleeping for a million years like Sleeping Beauty. I mean, with that much sleep you better be beautiful! Even plastic surgery can’t fix you if you’ve been sleeping that long and are still ugly.     But even that wouldn’t be HALF as bad as dating some vampire that makes you want to slap someone every time he talks. And has marble skin that sparkles in the sunlight, creating an illusion of some beautiful guy. Maybe you’d find him beautiful if you work at an old people’s home every hour of the day and your 15, otherwise, no way. It’s just not for me. Not to mention he tricks you into thinking he’s perfect. Well, that’s what I got of reading that book anyway.  I’d much rather date the hot werewolf instead…    Well, no one ends up sleeping for some thousand years, and no one ends up having a vampire boyfriend, but that doesn’t mean they don’t have crappy lives. They end up with some boyfriend who won’t even help pay the bills because he’s too lazy to get a job, and then goes and spends all your on some poker table so he can gamble away all the rest of your money.

20090130165204AA2GdJm	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Question on 'To Kill a Mockingbird' - "Oh nothing, nothing, somebody just walked over my grave."?	Aunt Alexandra said it in Chapter twenty Seven. What did she mean? Here is the context.      When Halloween came, I assumed that the whole family would be present to watch me perform, but I was disappointed. Atticus said as tactfully as he could that he just didn't think he could stand a pageant tonight, he was all in. He had been in Montgomery for a week and had come home late that afternoon. He thought Jem might escort me if I asked him.      Aunt Alexandra said she just had to get to bed early, she'd been decorating the stage all afternoon and was worn out-she stopped short in the middle of her sentence. She closed her moth, then opened it to say something, but no words came.       "'s matter, Aunty?" I asked.      "Oh nothing, nothing," she said, "sombody just walked over my grave." She put away from her whatever it was that gave her a pinprick of apprehension, and suggested that I give the gamily a preview in the livingroom..
20090130171231AA9yQBK	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Take a look at this short story I wrote...?	I'm a preteen writer. This was a school assignment. Tell me what you think.   To Whom It May Concern   There’s an old greenhouse down in Riverside Park,  forgotten by the city, shunned, and a man lives there. Ralph, I call him. And he talks to the rats that sometimes come to eat the dead plants. Empty shelves, lost souls. Machinery. And an old typewriter with dust sleeping on the keys. Shattered glass holes on the ceilings. A potted flower lies on a desk, the one petal left, the one that was still believed in, flutters down into the soil. A solar powered battery charger left unfinished by frustrated hands awaits instructions. I’ve been coming to this haven just recently. Bringing Ralph food from my cupboards, learning from him. Watching the rats. And writing.    I can never finish a story, though. But the strange idea entered my brain one day and, on the typewriter, I furiously click the keys. A play. The story is an unwanted lovechild of my wandering inspiration and neon mind. And it’s absolutely surreal. Ralph watches over my shoulder. He fascinates me. A mentor rejected by society. But he neither speaks English nor understands it. The words he speak hold meaning to his consciousness but to me, fall against me, hollow and insignificant. And every time I bring him bread, he recites a poem to me his language, out of gratitude. And despite the language barrier between us, he is the only one who understands the conflicts I experience.    Yesterday I stepped on a crack, and broke my mother’s back, I tell him. And he smiles his toothless grin and nods his head. But doesn’t know what the hell I’m talking about. And that’s the way it stays. And one day I finally finish my play. And then I read it aloud to Ralph and to the rats and he smiles and nods, chewing on a mouthful of canned beans. And when I finish, I look so hard into the page that words become blurred gibberish, and I stare into the white spaces in between them. I see everything. I stand up, and walk around the greenhouse. I find an envelope, and fold my life work up into a compressed square and slip it inside. To Whom It May Concern, I write on it.    And I place it gently on the top of the desk, and, saying goodbye to Ralph, I leave. My play was not meant for anyone else to see. Only for Ralph, myself, the rats, and any wandering soul who would come across it. Anyone who understands me. And then I walk into my apartment, say hello to my mother and sister, and suddenly, freeze. No. Nobody deserves to see this. I take a book of matches from the bathroom, and sprint back down to the greenhouse. Ralph is gone, and I don’t question it. His sour odors still hangs in the air. I simply hold the envelope, slice the match head across the box and a flame is born.    The envelope burns and my face is expressionless. The fire licks the paper, no, devours it. The orange storm of fear and acceptance reflects off of my eyes and I watch as the lovechild burns. Ashes flutter onto the soil. Onto the typewriter. Into the pocket of my sweatshirt. And then, I throw the matches into the dirt outside, and close my eyes.

You want to give up; go ahead. Stay invisible, it's not like it'll make a difference anyway," says Gina, cruel, sly, and...petty. It's what I've believed of myself for so long, and hearing her snobby whine throwing it at me makes my heart throb. A new confidence pulses up inside of me and words flow out of my mouth.    "No, Gina. I want things to be different and stay so the same, so much that I can't even say. I want to be able to talk without feeling strangled by lies. I want to know that things are strong enough to keep me on the ground, and to know that gravity isn't enough to stop emotion from flying free. And for Christ's sake, I want you to stop being so bitchy and telling me what I want!!"       How does that sound? Be brutal if you have to. Age doesn't matter to me, so I won't say how old I am unless you wanna know.

20090130185145AA108tV	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	My awesome Theory! Read it NOW!!!(Twilight)?	i think that Bella is secretly in love with Emmet, and i think that Edward has a thing for Alice.did you notice how nice Edward is to Alice? they are with each other 24/7.and bella notices but she tries not to pay too much attention because she is using edward to get to emmet.why do u think she likes Alice out of Rosalie and Esme?Because if it weren't for Alice, she wouldn't be with the Cullen's.Edward is just using Bella as a cover up so Jasper doesn't figure out that he likes Alice. this is why whenever edward is with alice and jasper, he tries to have bella around or claims he is thinking about her. so Jasper think the feeling of love coming from edward is for bella not Alice.   and why do u think Rosalie hates Bella so much? there has to be more than Edward liking Bella. Rosalie knows Bella secretly stalks Emmet.and she feels threatened. so rosalie teams up with esme to terminate the bella problem. they call on james but it doesn't work.but before that, they try a series of other things that makes Edward and Bella believe bella is a danger magnet.

Stop It, I'm Almost A Man   Let me be clear, so you understand   I'm not like you, I'm not the same man   You influenced me, for most of my life   The impact you had, made me pick up this knife      I grew fond of it's look, and of it's sharpness   I left the sunshine, and entered the darkness   This isn't my fault, but you made me believe   That you weren't the one, who tried to deceive      You thought I was wrong in all that I did   But honestly dad, who are you trying to kid   I wasn't wrong, for the wrong one was you   After all this time, what'd you expect me to do      I got up and ran, swore to never come back   Then I returned, hoping to find the right track   Sadly I didn't I got undoubtedly lost   I found my way back at a terrible cost      My mom was crying when I walked in the room   I said, “Should I go, not come back so soon?”   She replied, “Stay for a moment, you've got to know.”   “Your dad is abusive, we've got to get up and go.”      I didn't believe, the words that she said   I knew he was strict, I thought it was all in my head   She said, “No it's not normal, to act like he does.”   He thinks he is fine, but he's not who he was      He's on medication, I think he's addicted   Come on mom, this joke must be scripted?   This isn't a joke, I swear it's no lie   That's why I'm here, that's why I cry      A week or so later, after threatening to leave   My mom warmed up to my dad, he made her believe   He said it was over, all the madness and yelling   I knew in my soul, there was something no one was telling      I figured it out, this has happened before   But we swept it under the rug, then out of the door   My brother was angry, but that didn't matter   He said life goes on, we've got to keep climbing the ladder      My dad promised, that he'd never hit him again   Well that was a lie, for it wasn't the end   He hit him real good, and caused him to shout   “I gave you the benefit of the doubt.”      I refuse to fail and make his mistake   But the will that I have is starting to break   I want to leave, this place you call home   It feels like a prison, as you may know      What should I do, when my mom sides with my dad   Trying to take, what I have wanted so bad   I've got to escape, I've just got to break free   I've got to do something, for no one, but me      I put others first, too long it has been   If I had the choice I wouldn't do it again   I went to a therapist, on my dad's given order   The session was two hours, I wish it were shorter      They heard all my thoughts, my mom's thoughts too   They didn't hear my dad's, but woop-dee, do   My brother's in college, so my mom had to let go   Now it's my turn, but I'm going towards snow       My dad is upset, putting guilt on my plate   I'm going crazy, please get me out of this state   Others agree, they say, for me it is best   My parents don't care about the thoughts of the rest      I'm grinding my teeth, and pulling out hair   I don't understand why nobody cares   I've pleased my parents for most of my life   It's come to this, me with this knife      If they won't let me go, I swear I'll go mad   It's my fault, despite the thoughts of my dad   He keeps bringing up what I said before   “Let's go to Florida, there's so much in store.”      Forget what I said, I just want to return   Don't hold me back, or my fire will burn   The anger within me and starting to rise   If you keep me here I might as well die      Seven months more, won't make up for crap   Two weeks from now, I hope to be back   Continue my life, without you in it   You want my trust, doing good deeds won't win it      Believe me when I say, someday I'll come home   But I need this right now, please let me grow   Things in this state will be up there too   Operations needed, I'll find a way through            My last year is special, rent a limo for prom   I know that ain't happening, so forget it please mom   I don't want to go back, out of spite or of hatred   I want to go home as I have stated      Because this sure as hell, is not my home...

But somewhere around there. And I can belt.  I want to show off my range (obviously)...like a belting song, but a song I can also do in my head voice, if you know what I mean.

On the Porch      Fear settles comfortably in your bones   this rich September  night, like the sliver-moon   disappearing behind a jagged horizon      Starlight doesn’t cast shadows, really;   no, not really   for everything becomes a drawing of itself,   a painting that should have been painted long ago      There’s the wooden fence, built by your grandfather,   the perfect pines, wedging there way higher, ever higher   and, in the distance, hills tumbling over each other becoming   rocky peaks of tragedy      The cool and fragrant air has soul-filling qualities,   freezes moments, crystal perfect   hanging ripe in the air, waiting to be plucked   and savoured      You could sit on this porch forever   rocking quietly; yes, forever, you think,   forever would be nice,   if only it would fit    in your pocket.

20090130190126AAGgdJZ	Arts & Humanities;Performing Arts	I really need help with this?! Please help!@!?	So I got an Epiphone 1962 Alpine White Finish SG style guitar. (whew, mouthful) but after looking at the guitar and playing it for about a month now I have made a conclusion that there are way to many technical problems with the guitar that cannot be fixed. I think I should have gone with an Epiphone 1966 (for those of you that don't know, this is the style guitar Angus Young plays) as people say it sounds, feels, and looks better then any other guitar they have ever owned.I went to the store to give it a try and was utterly blown away! After holding it for about 5 minutes, I knew I had made the wrong guitar choice.      Guitar Center has a 30 day warranty, what i'm scared about is that this is the 40th day after the purchase. I really want to return it. Do you think that the people at guitar center WOULD let me return it? It's not like its been 150 days, its only been 10. I really wish I would have gotten that other guitar in the first place, it plays like a beauty and after testing several copies, none of them have any noticeable problems! Help me@!@!

20090130194613AAmEARc	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Would this sound better as present tense?	Xavier Winters was perhaps the most amazing new kid at this school I have ever met. The minute I saw him, something kicked inside of my heart. I was no longer aware of the icy blood pumping in my veins, the lack of pigment of any sort in my skin, or the fact that I wasn’t human. He took away the breath I never had the minute he shot me a nervous glance. I was just a normal girl for the split second I met his eyes. I felt warm for the first time in the two years I had been at Oxford, and at the same time it sent shivers up my spine. Whoever said love at first sight didn’t exist was a complete moron, just like the person who said teenagers don’t know what love is and cannot feel it.     I was just a normal girl who wanted the guy, wanted closure. Wanted a friend and acted like she didn’t have eternity to find either. I was a naive, lonely girl, who wanted somebody to love.     I wanted to help Xavier however possible, and I wanted to be his friend, if not more. I had been a student at OSYE longer than anyone else, and I was the only vampire there that could control the adrenaline rushes. I was kind of a veteran here, but not like the Professors. I knew I could offer him more advice than anyone at this school, because I had become a vampire instead of being born one at the age of thirteen.      The whole story is not like this, by the way.

Oh, and I just read this amazing fan fiction story that's only one chapter, but this is kinda where I got the idea from.   Peter betrays the Potters because he love Lily but hated James and Sirius.   That's why, in my view, when Voldy came to kill Harry's family, he told her to step aside 3 times instead of killing her. Why didn't he kill her automatically? After all ,Lily was a 'mudblood'.   Because Wormtail bargained for Harry and his dad in return for her.   What do you think?      Oh, and the fanfic is called Murderous Love by firstflier.

20090130203753AAhta0R	Arts & Humanities;Visual Arts;Drawing & Illustration	When I draw a face, the facial expression reflects my mood,how is this happening?	i have a moderate talent in drawing faces.I rarely draw,usually when i am down or in a negative mood. While drawing, i almost see the paper in a blurry way and keep working on the faces with pencil/pen.At the end, the face reflects exactly my psychological condition or mood. Sometimes even when i don`t know what my mood is, i can tell my mood by the result of my drawing. (things like jealousy or hope or any feelings that i am going through shows on the pictures I draw.)how could that be explained?Is it a common thing among artists?

20090130204243AAblAN3	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What do you think of this kissing scene I just wrote?	Before I knew it he was bending his head-- a small smile tugging at his lips as he reached to press his soft lips into the corner of my mouth. He then traveled to the edge my bottom lip, and gave it a soft nibble before whispering-    And I hope you know, that I thought about you the whole night too    I was breathless, his forehead was still pressing against mine. His warm sweet breath on my face, and I was sure he could feel my short, rapid breaths too.    He bit his plump lip as he wrapped an arm around my waist and pulled me closer to him. I stood on my toes and watched his lips coming closer to me. I had to catch my breath and prepare for whats to come next.    I subconsciously closed my eyes while he brushed his lips with mine, tracing his wet tongue across my upper lip. It felt amazing. I even let out a groan which caused him to hold me closer while I tugged at his shirt. I let my mouth move slowly, opening and closingmoving with his--it was nothing like how I practiced before with my hand.    He lightly sucked on my lips while I took advantage of the air, since I didnt want to breathe earlier--fearing that he would feel the gush of air in his face. I then suddenly ran my tongue across his gums and he moaned...tightening his grip around my waist.    I guess he liked it.    We continued to twirl our tongues, which felt so rightso hot. I reached for his messy hair, clutching and pulling him closer to me. It was as I couldnt get enough of thisof him.

I have taken art pretty much my whole life and I am an extreme Disney fan and that is more the direction I want to go. So, I know what I want, BUT the colleges I'm looking at don't offer animation emphasis. The closest things are like Graphic Design or Drawing. Which one would be best? Would I get proper training? What should I do? Btw, I am NOT interested in ANYTHING online. Classroom setting only.

At most, I'll be uploading these shots to Flickr.  I'm not using any material for commercial use, or anything like that.  Thank you all, in advance.

20090130201307AAm4VH8	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What should I title my book? (Please, HELP ME WITH THIS)????!!!!?	Ok so the book is about a girl who gets pregnant (unfortunately) by a boy who just moved from her school to live with his aunt due to his family being abusive towards him. Anyway, so the girls NEW boyfriend can tell she's pregnant, and he thinks it's his. She has to come through and tell him that it isn't his, and he gets mad, tells some of his friends how mad he is, they tell people, the other people tell people, etc. . So then the whole school (or at least there grade) knows about it. The mean trashy girl dated the the boy who moved before he had sex with the pregnant girl and she is now jealous, so she is trying to do whatever she can to get rid of that baby, since every weekend/Friday the boy visits and hangs out with all his old friends outside of the local coffee shop, and the trashy girl wants a serious relationship with him although she doesn't realize he's probably cheating on her with girls at his new school. The girls friends turn against her and blah, blah, blah, blah. The boyfriend is being overprotective and is treating her like she can't do anything. On Friday the trashy girl says something rude/sarcastic to her and they get in a cat fight. After the fight, they become as what the pregnant girl thinks 'friends' although the trashy girl is just using her to get rid of the baby. The trashy girl doesn't know that the boy knows so she is trying to keep it from him. She drives the girl to a sleezey abortion clinic but, the girl doesn't go through with it.   It's basically like that.   1.) Do you like it?   2.) Would you read it?   3.) Is it interesting enough?   4.) What should I call it?

20090130201043AAnhTrJ	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Is this a good story so far?	Chapter 1            I never thought my feelings could change towards my best friend, Cody Stevens. I never thought I’d want to be ‘his girl.’ It’s so hard to hide my feelings for him while we hang out on the bench in my back yard, just talking about the most random things in the world. I can be myself when I am with him. He has been my best friend since we met the first day of preschool.   We would walk around the playground holding hands. He would push me on the swings, and then I would push him. I would chase him around the playground in kindergarten and then when I fell and scraped my knee on the pavement, he would come up and kiss it. That would always make it feel better. We were never anything more than best friends. And I never thought we would be.   First grade came and gone… We were still the same, just two crazy 7 year old best friends. I will never forget the time he let me do his make-up. He learned something that night, never let a seven year old do your make-up, even if you are a guy.    First grade is when we had our first sleepover. It was on a Friday. The first Friday of first grade. We stayed up all night telling scary stories and joking around. We had a sleepover every Friday night after that. Every other week we would have the sleepover at my house. On the off weeks, it would be at his.   Second, third, and fourth grade were just like first. The only difference was that we wouldn’t hold hands at recess and he wouldn’t kiss me if I fell. We still loved each other as best friends and worshiped the time we spent together. We were in the same classes for all three years. We would sit next to each other everyday and pass notes whenever we could get away with it. I remember the only thing we wanted those years was to grow up, but now I want to go back to those times.   By fifth grade, we both had other best friends. None of them as close as Cody and I. We would still have our weekly sleepover and we would still hang out every day we could. If one of us were sick, the other would call them and make sure they were okay. We had a special bond between us that no one could break. Everyone in the school new that.   By sixth grade we stopped having the sleepovers and hanging out as much. Everyone that didn’t know us were starting rumors saying that we were going out and so we wouldn’t hang out and talk much at school. We didn’t try to sit next to each other during classes and at lunch we sat with our other friends. But after school on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays he would come over to my house. We would sit on the bench in my backyard and just talk for hours. I knew all of his secrets and he knew mine. I knew who he liked and he knew who I liked… except for him. No matter how close we were and how many times we promised each other that we would be friends forever, I was to afraid to tell him that I liked him. I was afraid that we wouldn’t be as close. But then I would think about it for a while. I would wonder if he likes me too or if I’m just wasting my time liking him. ‘Should I just try to forget about liking him?’ I kept on asking myself. I just never really knew what to do about it. I didn’t even tell my best girl friend. I just couldn’t trust anyone other than Cody but I never knew why.    Seventh grade was like sixth. The only difference was Cody and I hung out more. We told each other about whom we liked or who we were going out with. I felt jealous whenever he got a new girlfriend but I knew it was for the best of us.   There was one thing about Cody that I never understood until now. I would wonder this all the time as we walked through the halls with our other friends. Why did Cody always have a ‘fan club?’ He had girls drooling over him and tripping over each other just to say hi to him. I talked to Cody about this one day, he said he would try to get it to stop because it annoyed him too. Well that didn’t work…it just made his fan club bigger. Oh and now the girls were trying to kiss him or slap his butt as he walked by. Well, let’s just say Cody’s girlfriends didn’t like that too much.   In seventh grade Cody couldn’t hold a girlfriend longer than 3 weeks. All of the girls would dump him and they would always have the same, lame, excuse, “I don’t feel like having a boyfriend right now. Maybe we can go back out some other time?” They would never end up going back out. Cody started asking me to start rumors saying that he’s emo and stuff like that to try to get some of the girls away from him. Well I started the rumors… And Cody had more girls than ever in the fan club.   All of the guys in the school hated Cody by the third week of school. By all the guys in the school I mean every single sixth, seventh, and even eighth grader. Even if they guys hated each other, they all got together one day during the pep-rally and started a plan to gang up and Cody and make his face… Well, ‘Not so pretty’ if you know what I mean. Good thing for all of Cody’s friends though. They were all on the school football

What do you think? This is a piece to my 'novel' which will probably never, ever get done, but I wanted some feedback.  Thanks guys!        A sound resonated from somewhere above him. Jack whipped up his head, allowing his searching gaze to sweep over the trees only for a brief moment; a second longer and his exposed neck would have been pierced by the twisted horns of the wild boar. As it were, he managed, through a stupendous display of gymnastic ability, to launch rightwards in a barrel roll, tumbling into the prickling grass, but safely out of the beasts lethal charge. His newfound security was short-lived however, as the gruesome animal, picking up the pace of its swift hooves, charged at him again. This time, still sprawled on the grassy patch, he was even more vulnerable then before. His face, right in front of the boar, was rolling around in the dirt. The powdered earth swirled into his mouth and seeped into his nostrils, which, in his fear, were blowing air like those of a great and terrible dragon. He couldnt breath. Each dirt particle seemed like a naughty mite, banging at his mouth, demanding entrance to his throat so it could feast on the tender lining and quench itself with his last puffs of oxygen. He was going to die here, at the horns of some barbaric animal, for no reason besides satiating its unwarranted rage. Jack closed his eyes, awaiting the sound of ripping flesh. Ziiiiiiiiipppppp! He blinked. That didnt sound like-  Do try to be more careful with your arrows, said a voice, sounding from a place past his blurred line of vision.  What? another voice protested indignantly, I shot it right in the side!    Bah! the first voice returned, my grandmother could have done better!  Your grandmother, came the serious reply, could beat us both silly with a wooden stick.  Jack listened to the entire conversation with his eyes shut, trying to keep his eyelids from fluttering. He still wasnt sure if he was dead or not; perhaps it was these strange voices that killed him, and he certainly didnt want to invoke their wrath by opening his eyes. A couple seconds later however, his eyes snapped open without his prompting, startling Jack. His sudden, ill-maneuvered jump backwards had his knees trembling, and for a brief moment, he sincerely wondered if his body was conspiring against him. He lifted his head to see two figures, one considerably shorter than the other, gliding up to him. Jack barely managed to stifle a gasp as he gazed, no, gawped, at the pair. He ran his eyes up and down their bodies, trying to comprehend what he was looking at, while at the same time concienciously trying not to look as if he were sizing them up.  The pair seemed to have been plucked right out of a fantasy novel! Unless, of course, it was HE who had been dropped into an unsuspecting fictional world, and, at this moment, was dreaming. He relaxed at the thought, and resumed his observation. The smaller figure was undoubtedly a dwarf; short and stout with a brown lions beard and a drooping, cigar mustache to match. An axeTypical he thought, straddled the dwarfs back. The taller figure was a man, clad in padded, leather trousers and a neat tunic. The belt across his waist was strapped with daggers of various shapes, sizes, and sheathes. There were five in all; three on his left, and two, slightly larger ones, on his right. Some were curved, some straight. Some were more intricate than others, but all, at least from what he could guess, were very, very sharp. Deadly, but undeniably cool; like fantastical movie props made for die-hard fans. You alright there, man? the dwarf asked, extending a hand to help him up. Jack took the hand gratefully and stood up, patting the dust off his shoulders. Im fine, thanks, he replied. A lie, he was NOT fine by any means, and he couldnt imagine who would be after being attacked by a giant, rampaging animal. Where am I? he asked the dwarf. Oops, he had never intended to format his question in such an overdone, sub-par sort of way. In the woods, came the reply. In the woods, he thought, what a wonderfully blatant piece of information. He clucked his tongue to his teeth, trying to hide his annoyance. I understand that, however I-, he was interrupted.

20090130201326AAFPQ6m	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	I need a nickname for a character?	Okay. Brief description of the character   Name: Lucas   Age: 19, supposedly   Physical Description: About 6 foot tall, tan from being outside alot, very musclular but not bulky, dark blond, long, messy-but-mostly-straight hair. Very blue eyes like ice only a softer color.   Generally wears: Shorts and a strip of cloth under around his forehead, under his bangs kinda like this guy   http://blogs.glam.com/glamchic/files/200...  only the headband would be cloth/a bandana/ not a sweatband of any kind :)   Significance: Becomes the main characters love interest, never goes anywhere. A very haunting presence   Other: As the story progresses, actually not until the peak of the story, we find out he is a demonic somethingoranother (haven't figured out what yet, just started this story) his aim all along was to harm the main girl and her little brother because of her recognition of his home, though she's never been there before, (this will turn into a power, not sure what yet though)      Okay, so as I've been writing about him, he just seems like he should go by a nickname, not his real name, so I'm asking you to please help me think of one, because I've been trying for a few days now. Also if you have any ideas for the (i'm not sure about this yet)'s then please give ideas, if your comfortable with that.      P.s. please don't steal my story idea or character, i'm truly stuck and while i couldn't do anything about it, it would really be not right ethically

I'm going on a helicopter tour of las vegas at night and want to know what camera settings would be best for pictures from the helicopter.       I have a Fuji Finepix S2000HD. It seems I can set the shutter speed, which I would want to be really fast, but I see the faster it goes, the dimmer the shot is, so not sure what it should be.      Then I have the ISO setting. At 10 MP I can go to 1600, but if I go down to 5 MP I can go to ISO 6400.      So I don't know what the balance between shutter speed and ISO should be for this.

After I revised it:    in the school hallway you pass me by   you ignore my feelings, you shove them aside   but behind my happy, smiley guise   is a broken heart, is that such a surprise?       the next time we pass my face tear-eyed   still you have simply denied   that my broken heart has bled and cried      the third time we passed in the hallway    your gaze penetrates me, your hurtful words mold like clay      you never see me again in that hallway, you wonder "where is she"?    that night i committed suicide   my broken heart remains broken for all eternity      I edited it in like two minutes, but tell me what you think. I did not write the original one, i just edited it!

Everything hurts   expecially my mind   the thoughts    so annoying.   Take out all the rage   by damaging my skin   watch as the redness takes over.   I cant stand to hurt   the people i love   So ill stand by them    and stop the rage.   Stop the red.   Stop,   and turn the page.   ~Shelby a.k.a Me.      and this one is drowning:      I have everything i could ever want   but somethings not right.   The world keeps turning,   but it shouldn't be.   Nobody knows whats wrong,   not even me.   Times are hard,   as i watch my grades fall.   I try to try harder,   But i just fill my lungs with water.   The world gets tougher.   I try to stand up for what i belive,   It doesn't work,   just decieves.   These thoughts are weird,   they're so confusing.   I just want to start using   my sissors again.   Feel the pain,    to numb the thoughts,   that make me crazy.   I can't,    Ive made promises.   For now ill just suffer,   and go right to the bottom of the sea   ~Shelby a.k.a Me.            will u rate them and tell me what i could do better. they are personal and they  are me lol ok thanks!!!

20090130194208AAMYUyO	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Has writing the same, or atleast, to a verily, constrained extent, similar effect as reading would have?	Though it may appear, the answer is quite obvious, yet still, at times, I am extemporaneously faced with such questions as this, and have have been encountered with a plurality of my own answers, those of which often contradict with each other. From this note, it is prominent that both forms, reading and writing, do indeed provide a stimulus, in themselves, for imagination and creativity. This is not a question of 'What does more', but merely one of inquisition as to 'Distinguish between'. Well appreciated you'd be if you were to make constructive insight(s), and I believe I am clear, now, on what I am asking. Post away.

20090130201021AAAsnxR	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Title ideas for story?	So my friend and I are writing a romantic cliche. However, we don't have a title for it.      This is basically about a girl named Mimi who gets a summer job as a maid.She goes with the family to their summer resort. Their son, Joe, is Mimi's age, but he's a spoiled stuck up jerk. She has to learn to deal with him, and soon, she starts to develop feelings for him. However, a snotty girl named Jessica tries to hog Joe to herself and mishaps happen from there. It's pretty much a love-hate relationship cliche thing.

20090130204615AAOLmEf	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Major novel plot help, please! +title help!?	Alrighty. I'm writing a novel, and it's a series of murder mysteries. It's almost like CSI, but in book form. I guess. Um. Alright, so in the novel, there's separate "acts," and in these acts, there are numerous "scenes." Each "scene" is a new murder mystery.       During several of the many acts, there are about three serial killers that the main characters have to deal with. With one of the serial killers, s/he escapes the city and catches a flight over-seas. The police force (where the serial killer ends up, I'm not entirely sure where this is just yet) finally capture the serial killer, and the main characters of the novel must go collect him/her, so to speak.      I was wondering: when the main characters get hold of the serial killer, would they take a commercial flight back to their city, or would they take the serial killer in a private plane? During their flight, the plane goes down in a lightning storm, and I want as little casualties as possible. The two main characters and the serial killer end up stranded on a deserted island (I know, it sounds kind of irrational and not very serious, but I'm only 15 ^^).      I was just wondering what type of plane the main characters would get into to bring the serial killer back to their city.      **Also, to prevent from making another question, I was wondering if anyone has a few title ideas? If you guys need any more background info on the novel, just shout out. I really need some help with this >w<**

She looked at the little bot who laid scared on the ground. Her eyes fluttered and her strength regained. She knew she couldn't let him down.

So smug in all your galore you don’t see me standing at the door You’re judging me so that you can’t see my pain when will you bring me in from the rain Whispering and pointing fingers clouded your discernment and it has allowed another lost soul to be in torment Envy and strife has brought division makes you wonder how we call ourselves Christians Hate has become a weight so why do you continue to participate Where is your faith what happen to the love that was sent from above and died for our sins so soul could be restored and forgiven Must we wait  until we get to Heaven   You live high upon your horse forgetting where you came from thinking you know where you’re going I pray you don’t lift up your eyes and realize Hell is your prize for being unwise What makes you better than me because you didn’t smoke weed oh please we all need to be on our knees for we all have sinned and come short of His Glory I just thank God I’m still here to tell my story   I may not eat steak and potatoes but I’m just as Anointed on my beans and tomatoes   I may not speak with elegant words nor rub elbows with the social elites but in my God’s eyes I am royalty Walk pass with your head held high while cutting your eyes as though I was a thorn in your side but did you know that I’m somebody that one day you will regret you didn’t get to know   See why you’re looking down on me for what I don’t have or possess you missed your chance to be blessed. You thought I was just a sinner or an unworthy soul who was just trying to come in from the cold Never occurred to you I’m the millionaire that you were praying for-Don’t you know judging a book by its cover is the trick the Devil uses to destroy your purpose and dreams so why do you cling to things when God wants you to birth the Dream   If you could only see me as my Lord & Savior does: He sees my heart and not my clothes He cares for my soul not the riches that are to unfold He loves me beyond my faults and meets my needs  so there is no need for there to be greed   Love with your heart and spirit and not your flesh and will Let God lead and guide you then you’ll see over the horizon Release the doubts and defeats then you want have to compete Get with the Plan Don’t you know the Anointing is in your hands         ? 2009 NORA L.
