a6ffea25c0aa401a19f230798b7a8fdaaa	Hola, lo primero que debes hacer es comer mas de 3 veces al dia en pequenas porciones. Eso te acelera el metabolismo. Si estas interesado en aumentar masa muscular debes ir a un gimnasio y hacer pesas cuidadosamente de una manera disciplinada. Lo importante para la masa muscular es la ingesta de proteinas diarias. Asi que alimentos ricos en proteinas (salmon, carnes rojas, pollo, garbanzos, soja, quinoa, etc) es lo mejor que puedes ingerir para alcanzar estas metas. Tambien podrias complementar con alguna batida de proteinas, pero con eso hay que tener mas cuidado. Lo otro importante que deberias hacer es visitar algun nutricionista, para ver que cosas realmente puedes comer sin que se te afecte el cuerpo, saber si eres tolerante a todo tipo de comida y mantener un equilibrio de colesterol, alta presion, trigliceridos, glucosa, etc.|`|H9E0OB5Aaa	jaja yo mido 1 80 i peso 62 kilooooooooos!!  y por mas que como chatarra no sirve:P  y no funciona que coma toodo el dia    ps ia nimodo te pasa lo mismo k ami|`|7yYiY89waa	Definitivamente hacer deporte....ojo con las mancuernas y el gimnasio...es una solucin solo a corto plazo.

"they" (some national thing for eating disorders) says listen to your cravings. You arent going to lose weight if you tell your self your just going to cut it all because realistically, can you? No its VERY difficult. Say you go to mcdonalds. Instead of getting a ten piece chicken nugget get a 4 piece. instead of a large fry get a small fry. Instead of getting a big mac meal get a kids meal. If you go to a restraunt, put half of your food in a to go box. want a candy bar? eat half and save the rest for later. Ease your way into this. Your setting yourself up for failure if you tell yourself your just not going to eat any of it.

Serve with tortilla chips.    Method  1 Cut avocados in half. Remove seed. Scoop out avacado from the peel, put in a mixing bowl. (See How to Cut and Peel an Avocado.)    2 Using a fork, mash the avocado. Add the chopped onion, cilantro, lime or lemon, salt and pepper and mash some more. Chili peppers vary individually in their hotness. So, start with a half of one chili pepper and add to the guacamole to your desired degree of hotness. Be careful handling the peppers; wash your hands thoroughly after handling and do not touch your eyes or the area near your eyes with your hands for several hours.    Keep the tomatoes separate until ready to serve.    Remember that much of this is done to taste because of the variability in the fresh ingredients. Start with this recipe and adjust to your taste.    3 Cover with plastic wrap directly on the surface of the guacamole to prevent oxidation from the air reaching it. Refrigerate until ready.    4 Just before serving, add the chopped tomato to the guacamole and mix.    Serves 2-4.    Variations    For a very quick "guac" just take a 1/4 cup of salsa and mix it in with your mashed avocados.    You don't need to have tomatoes in your guacamole.     To extend a limited supply of avocados, add either sour cream or cottage cheese to your guacamole dip. Purists may be horrified, but so what? It tastes great. In fact, guac with some cottage cheese added to it is my favorite.    |`|yEVM87EKaa	Make sure you buy really soft, ripe avacados. They shouldn't be hard to blend at all!!

The taste, the texture, the color...it's almost like they're not even the same species of fish. And also, you're helping local fisherman support their families. But aside from that, take a taste, smell, touch taste and once you've had wild salmon, you'll never want farmed salmon again. It's kind of like Reggiano Parmesan cheese compared to the green boxed Kraft parmesan cheese. Absolutely no comparison. Believe me. Happy eating and warm regards.|`|AA11689215	Wild salmon by far has a better flavor!    A friend gave me some wild salmon fillets.  I cut them up into serving sizes and my hands were so oily I couldn't open the zip lock baggies.    That oil gives the salmon the greatest flavor.  You don't need to add anything (seasons, sauces, herbs, butter, etc.) to it when you cook it.    Farm raised salmon has no flavor at all.  I was recently on a business trip, and went to the hotel restaurant for dinner.  I ordered the salmon.  They asked why I didn't finish it.  I told them I didn't like farm raised salmon.  They were surprised that I could tell the difference.|`|316ef2c259bd33fcd19c9b6e8ab133eeaa	I am a strong believer there is nothing better than a freshly caught salmon, particularly if I have caught it myself.

One pointer (and something that grosses me out) is that alot of salmon has been dyed red/pink. I always ask before I buy. In the US they are required to let you know if the fish has dye.|`|NkN4HoFpaa	Fished salmon is better quality.

Chauffer le mlange au bain-marie. Fouetter jusqu' ce que le mlange atteigne 40 (il doit tre tide et ne pas frmir).  Ds que le mlange est  la bonne temprature, retirer le saladier du feu et mlanger au batteur lectrique jusqu' ce que l'ensemble devienne mousseux et qu'il ait tripl de volume.  Incorporer la farine et le cacao.  Monter le blanc d'oeuf en neige. Ds qu'il devient mousseux, ajouter les 10 g de sucre restant.  Mlanger 1/5 me de la prparation au chocolat au blanc en neige afin de dtendre la prparation puis incorporer dlicatement le reste.  Sur une plaque  patisserie recouverte de papier sulfuris, poser un cercle  patisserie de 20 cm.  Verser la pate et cuire environ 10  12 min th7.  La mousse au chocolat noir :     * 100 g de chocolat noir     * 20 cl de crme liquide 30%  Faire fondre le chocolat au bain-marie.  Battre la crme jusqu' l'obtention d'une chantilly pas trop ferme.  Incorporer 1/3 de la crme fouette au chocolat fondu en mlangeant rapidement au fouet.  Incorporer dlicatement le reste de la crme.  Note : procder de la mme fa?on pour la mousse au chocolat blanc et la mousse au chocolat au lait, en conservant exactement les mmes proportions de chocolat et de crme liquide. Prendre soin de battre plus fermement la crme pour la mousse au chocolat blanc ! ;-)  Le montage :  Disposer le biscuit au chocolat sur un plat. L'entourer avec le cercle.  Etaler la mousse au chocolat noir, celle au chocolat au lait puis celle au chocolat blanc.  Rserver au frais quelques heures.  Si vous souhaitez faire un gla?age, voici la recette :  Le gla?age :     * 100 g de chocolat noir     * 10 cl de crme liquide  Raper le chocolat. Porter la crme  bullition et la verser sur le chocolat rap.  Mlanger au fouet jusqu' obtention d'une texture homogne et lisse.

NNiN0tK0aa	Yes.  White (refined) grains cause your insulin levels to soar - insulin causes your body to store fat, especially around the abdomen.  If you switch to wholegrain, this won't happen.  You will also drastically increase your nutrient intake (white grain products are stripped of almost all the nutrients) which will make you look and feel healthier.  Plus the fibre will flush out your colon, which will also make your tummy appear flatter.|`|Jm6Vtptuaa	maybe not lose weight, but a steadier blood sugar level which would give more energy and better mood.|`|fhyYh3Dzaa	I don't now how much weight you would loose, but assuming that the rest of your diet is healthy then you probably would.

You certainly will eat more fibre, protein, vitamins and minerals though. Wholemeal contains "good carbs" also, and mostly have a low GI. You will feel full longer, will give you prolonged sustained energy, and your mood might change.    Nutrition is an exact science, but knowing how it effects every individual isn't. Your body will tell you soon enough! :) You should make the change, unbleached, unpolished wholegrains are a lot better for you...|`|llkSmgLJaa	White bread and pasta is more fattening then whole grain bread and pasta. It's a lot healthier for you too. Cut out the chips, candy and other junk food and you will loose weight.
rDpvXxqSaa	There are lots and lots of websites that specialise on raw foods, although more with respect to recipes, and there are a lot of cookbooks out.     Some people eat 60 or 80 percent raw diet, which might be better for you.  It is up to the person to set the boundaries.  Some people will drink tea who live on a raw food diet, some people are fine with freezing things (most, i think), and others not, some are fine with anything that has been heated up to around 110 degrees, but that varies with each person.    In a raw food diet, if you are willing to put the time into the preperation, practically anything can be substituted, but it takes a long time.  There are several bread recipes on the internet, even cake recipes and even a fudge recipe!  There are pancake recipes out their two, which are relatively easy to make.    If you are going to go on it, you need to eat a very very lot of greens, which are not cheap....If you want to go all out, this is not a diet for people to go for who do not have the time to change their ways, and who are not willing to become more organised about planning what they are going to eat.    There are many nice quick things you can do in the blender, both puddings and more savoury, although be warned that the more savoury can sometimes require some adapting to taste-wise.     If you live an active lifestyle you will need to get a protein supplement, although being a vegan already you are probably aware of that.  There are several raw ones available.  A good protein is hemp seed protein, which is not that nice to the taste to practically anyone, although companies and people have manipulated it to taste nicer.  Another one is brown rice protein.    If you want some sites to look at, literally google 'raw food' or 'ecstatic food', or any specific things like recipes or a kind of food that you are after, and you will get several up.      Seaweed is something that you should consider eating if you are going raw, seaveg.co.uk (or .com if US) i am told is reliable, and you can buy sea-spaghetti, among other things on funkyraw.com.  Other sites that sell raw food are detoxyourworld.com and rawfoodstore.com (the latter US only, i think, never used it).  There are many ones, and more if you are in US.    It does cost a bit both to get started and to eat it (you can buy raw vegan chocolate online too, which is very good for you and yummy!), which is why i'd suggest you consider what i'm trying to do.  Eat cooked wholegrains and pulses (although sprout them when you can), and anything you'd cook them with to flavour, then just try to make your veg and fruit completely raw.  The former loose little from cooking, i believe.  Nuts should be kept raw, naturallly (warning:  often cashew nuts are not actually raw due to the steaming process to get rid of the shells, if you want proper raw ones, you can buy them online, but they cost a lot more).    You can buy cereals online which are raw too, which are not too expensive.    Obviously, i'm happy to help, but really you should consider looking on the internet first, before you ask, as all this you acn easily find by looking round on a few sites (admittedly, some more easily than others).  It also seems a little premature for you saying that you are interested in the diet, and do not know that the normal bread you buy is not raw.    The raw diet can be very healthy, and it can also be quite hard on your digestive system (you can expect several effects if you go and switch...you should always smoothly change your diet, never quickly).  For example, nuts are extremely hard on you pancreas raw.  A tip to help that would be to soak them for a few days, then dehydrate them again (on a very low temperature) slowly over a day or two.  The soaking gets rid of the things that make it hard on your pancreas.    Due to certain problems with wheat, you might be better avoiding eating that raw.  I've also heard that you should not eat beetroot much raw, although i have eaten it, and others, and not had any problems (i guess the trick is not to eat too much of it).    You should also know that occassionally (although it is occassionally) properties of foods can be enhanced by cooking, for example lycopene in tomatoes.  There was one other point i was going to make, but it has slipped from my memory...if it appears again and i think about it, i will post it here for you another time.    I apologise for grammar and spelling, but i am very busy, and thought that the content might excuse the mistakes and the roughness of the structure.    Remembered:  About cooking things slowly, for vegetables and such, there can be certain enzymes present that are better if they are denatured quickly (i.e. at slightly higher temperatures, so nearer the 100 degrees), if you are going to cook them, as otherwise they can 'steal' some of their nutrients away.    And, if you want to know why you eat nuts raw, cooking ruins the fats in them.|`|Jm6Vtptuaa	there is raw bread.     raw vegans eat fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, beans    http://www.rawfoodtalk.com|`|Q4oPyclQaa	Bread is baked, so no.  And tea... I'm not so sure about....    You could have tea that's been steeped in cold water instead of warm. But I've never tried that so I don't know how well it woudl work.|`|WIsxqR7caa	Other vegans of course!|`|b2261d1342601255ca19eb8cac0fdf39aa	Tea is usually not raw because it is smoked or roasted in some way but it is really the only way to drink it. As far as breads go you can make sprouted grain breads or maybe someone in your area makes raw breads but the only company I know of that makes sprouted grain breads is not raw because they bake at 250 degrees, they are Ezekiel breads in case you wanted to know. Mainly from what I know raw foods are not to be heated any higher than 110-115 degrees or something like that and can be hazardous if you don't know what you are doing or eating (some foods aren't edible raw and can make you sick)     These resources might help you a bit:  http://www.living-foods.com/  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_foodism    Good luck!|`|NNiN0tK0aa	Its very difficult to eat cheaply on a raw vegan diet.  To do so you need to eat a lot of grains and beans/lentils.  To eat the grains you have to soak them, water them 3 times a day until they sprout, and then grind them.  Then mix them with water and then dehydrate them into bread or tortillas or crackers.....you need either a dehydrator or to live somewhere very hot so you bake them in the sun all day.....but its a lot of work and most people don't have the time.  To eat the beans/lentils/chickpeas you need to soak them and then water them until they sprout.  Again involves work.  If you're not eating raw grains and beans as your staple you need to eat a lot of raw dark green vegetables and that is expensive.  Unless you have access to weeds that can be eaten raw such as chickweed - most weeds are very tough/hard to chew and very bitter, its very hard to eat them.  You need a vitamix (a high power blender that costs 400) to blend them with fruit and fruit juice to make a smoothie - ordinary blenders can't break down the cell walls.  If you try using one you burn out the blender.    So the answer is....if you're willing to put a lot of time into preparation and buy a dehydrator or you live somewhere really hot...then you can eat raw breads and eat raw vegan cheaply.  As well as raw wheat breads, you would have corn tortillas, buckwheat pancakes, sprouted oats ground into oatmeal.  Also sprout seeds.  Without the grains and beans, raw vegan is expensive!!|`|2r4kfcJmaa	Raw vegans only eat raw, uncooked foods such as fruits, veggies, nuts, seeds, sprouted grains, and sea vegetables. It also means no bread. You can have tea if the water is under 118 farenheit.

CXOs4mAEaa	Have a look here...  http://www.typetive.com/candyblog/catego...
4wnM8JtXaa	there is an awesome game I just learned at a superbowl/keg party. It's called KING'S CUP. here's how it's played    you need:  Alot of Beer  a standard 52 card deck (shuffled well)  1 cup per player  one cup for the center (the "King's Cup")  a good mix of guys and girls playing    You start this game by placing the empty cup in the middle of cards (spread around the cup to form a circle so from above it would look like a target). From here you and some friends sit around the circle of cards (in a circle) and begin to select cards going in a clockwise fashion. Below I've listed what each card stands for:    Ace - 'Waterfall': When you start drinking, the person next to you has to start drinking, then the person next to them until it's gotten all the way around the circle. Here's the catch, the person after you can't stop drinking until you have stopped, basically screwing the last person in line. Think of this like dominoes.    2 - Is for 'You': You choose someone to drink if you've chosen this card.    3 - Is for 'Me': You drink one.    4 - Is for 'Whores': All the women drink.    5 - Is for 'Rules': make a rule. any rule. this lasts until another rule is made    IE. you can make it so where if any girl drinks, someone you choose drinks or if someone coughs, they have to drink, ETC...    6 - Is for '*****': All of the guys drink.    7 - Is for 'Heaven': last one to point up toward heaven has to drink    8 - Is for 'Pick A Mate': When you pull this card, you must select someone who has to drink every time you drink (this works really well with large groups, not so much for smaller ones).    9 - Is for 'Rhyme': You start by picking a word that is rhymable. You then proceed to go around the circle until someone repeats the word or can't think of one. Either case they would have to drink.    10 - 'Categories': This one is really simple. All you have to do is come up with a category that has several subjects within it.    For example: You choose the category "TV Shows". You say "Fresh Prince of Bel Aire", next person "True Life", next "Family Guy"... etc. You keep going until someone can't think of one or repeats who in turn have to drink.    Jack - 'Back': the person who was before you drinks    Queen - 'Questions': This is a round of rapid fire questions. You must begin by asking someone a question, the person who you've asked cannot answer, but has to turn to someone else and ask them a question, who in turn has to ask someone else a question. This is ended by someone either asking the same question, answering the person who asked them the question, or freezing.    King - here you have to do two things; if you have an empty cup in the middle, contribute some alcohol from your glass to that cup (you can choose how much to pour)|`|oLkphni4aa	go to Spencers gifts... there are lots of cool things there. They have a boardgame called PassOut it is AWESOME!!  Make sure to have music.  Go to www.zooass.com, they have lots and lots of drink recipes.  A friend of mine that throws monthly parties has a special shot that they make for everyone every hour they get passed out. We usualy do Kamikazi's.  Pick a pretty general word and let everyone know what it is... like the word "it" or "drink" and whoever says it anytime of the night has to take a drink.    Get the movie  "What about Bob"   whenever anybody on the show says "Hi, Bob!", everybody calls out "HI BOB!" and takes a very generous drink of their beer. People on the show say "Hi, Bob" so often, that even the guys who can hold their alcohol the best will get at least a good buzz.    Watch the show Scrubs. Everytime J.D. or any other character imagines things or does a voice-over, take a shot. Every time Dr. Cox calls J.D. a girls name, take a shot

1an0UT6Jaa	Any open bottle of wine will only last about a week or so. The problem is once the air comes in contact with the wine it will start to oxidize (even if it is briefly uncorked). You will notice a sour smell and strong taste occur when this happens. Unfortunately, you are going to want to toss that bottle!|`|O8qdCBzLaa	It won't be as good as when you first opened it, and might be kind of bitter and stale tasting.

Getting drunk is not good for you and really a waste of time (no pun intended)    Second, how old are you?  If the answer is less than 21, then don't do it.  you are not old enough to do it legally and the penalties when, not if, you get caught will be significant.

aNlT1NRqaa	Sneaking drinks is what alcoholics do. You'll be on that road, unless the obvious happens and mom finds out. If she's a good mother, there's no way you'll get away with it & she might beat you until dad gets home & takes over.    Drink when you're old enough & do it at a club or party, never locked in the basement.|`|c1d312af4250951e942d357ba46d734caa	Alcohol seeps out of your pores just like when you eat a lot of garlic.

Not to meantion you're going to have to control your friends or they'll be really loud. Also, do you know how weak a drunk person's bladder is? You and your friends will be making frequent trips to the toilet, and if your mum is near by and sees one of them stumbling around trying to get to the toilet you're busted.|`|Ld5Mooujaa	It's a bad idea, she'll find out. Moms know all.|`|VYWaL2graa	Wait until you're old enough to do it without sneaking about.|`|er4Y3RSGaa	Ha ha  in a way that's a good plan but your really going to have to watch how much you drink because the drunker you are the louder you get.|`|hytS9gNzaa	it's a bad idea if you don't normally lock the door, if you do anything out of the ordinary she will suspect something and then find out about it|`|26991c1ba20b717681957ed25b316eacaa	So if you're falling over drunk you're going to put gum in your mouth?? Sounds lame, don't bother sneaking around cuz if you get caught you wont be seeing your friends for a while. Just get some balls and ask if you can have a couple friends over to watch movies say you promise you wont be loud and if they can sleep over. If you're going to drink make sure you have something to hide it in (get bottles of coke and put rum in it kind of thing)|`|ucpr0kOTaa	No that wont work, no offence but she'd have to thick not to notice you all out of it.|`|yC7jXmK1aa	Are you seriously just going to be getting drunk in your basement?

ErXKMHGAaa	Bully_ brings up a valid point, how vegan are you? Bacteria and some fungus (not all) are both more like animals than plants. If you are considering them as animals, then no. You would also not eat anything that was made by an animal or insect such as honey or royal jelly or even products such as pharmaceuticals that have gel tabs as it contains gelatin derived from animal bones. If you are considering bacteria as an animal then, no it is not vegan, and you should stop brushing your teeth and/or using mouthwash as it kills millions of bacteria and germs that will eventually rot out your teeth if kept unchecked. Oh, and don't use alcohol, ammonia, or bleach based cleaners or anticeptics or else you will be killing viruses, bacteria and germs that can possibly kill you.    But if you aren't considering bacteria as an animal (btw - it doesn't die in your digestive tract so don't feel badly), feel free to eat Silk yogurt and still be called a vegan.|`|Jm6Vtptuaa	it is vegan.     INGREDIENTS: Organic soymilk, (filtered water, whole organic soybeans), organic evaporated cane juice, rice starch, blueberries, dextrose, natural flavors, tricalcium phosphate, cultured glucose syrup solids, citric acid, pectin, locust bean gum, ascorbic acid (vitamin C), fruit and vegetable juice (for color), yogurt cultures (L. bulgaricus, S. thermophilus, L. acidophilus, B. bifidum, L. casei, L. rhamnosus).|`|LDREvRKGaa	Whoa there.

O8qdCBzLaa	When reheating foods like that, it's best to do it slowly. Heating it up quickly will cause uneven heating and it might get too hot inside. Also, overheating will make the tortilla rubbery when it cools.     First, wrap it up in the paper it came in or use a paper towel. It may pop and splatter. Then nuke it for a minute on power level 2. If that's not enough, heat it again for 1 minute on power level 2. But, pause it after 30 seconds to see if it's hot enough then.|`|Eb3SnljMaa	hmm...    if its in paper..keep wraped put in micro for 30-40 seconds    if in foil...take out, wrap in damp paper towel, put in micro 30-40 secs|`|U5d075o7aa	HEHE.  they are actually pretty gross if you let them get ;unfresh; Not that they were in the first place, but still.I say you cook it in the Oven for best results.

v4vQSzu4aa	There are several reasons that these prices can vary monthly, week to week, or even daily.  Seasonality is the first, demand, usage for your area, where the products are being purchased from (the shipping, the seasonality of that area) agricultural financial market, crop sizes planted vs. sell-able product, and these are just a few of the factors that affect our prices. For example:  If oranges in Florida are grown in a normal climate during the Winter months up North (NOV-MAY), but it's warmer down south, then the prices should be normal, but if the oranges out of California during these months are affected by heavy rains and varying temperatures, then their crops will be heavily affected and thereby, causing price differentials in not only oranges, but many other products as well.  I hope this helps to you understand (if only a bit) about how the trickle down weather effects and so many other factors affects our price tag on veggies and fruits!|`|IodpgIk7aa	depends if it is in season or not..or how much is grown|`|ylJoUuMDaa	A pound of gold costs more than a pound of silver.  Same goes for food.  Supply and demand.|`|1CkVYifEaa	It depends on the following:    demand vs amount produced  difficulty to cultivate  time of the year    Think about it.  If you buy an apple from your home state when they're being harvested it will be cheaper than, say, blueberries in the middle of winter.|`|Zo0QMB8xaa	Prices depend on supply and demand law.

Use a Starfrit dicer or food processor to dice the onions. I put the second quiche in the freezer for another day.    Pastry for 1 quiche dish OR 2 pie crusts    3 large onions, diced   2 tbsp. butter or margarine  1 tbsp. flour  4 oz. Swiss cheese, grated (1 c. grated)  2 eggs  2/3 c. milk  1 tsp. salt  Dash pepper and nutmeg    Preheat oven to 375F. Saut onions in melted butter or margarine over medium heat for about 10 minutes. Do not brown. Sprinkled with flour and mix well.      Beat eggs, milk, salt, pepper and nutmeg. Add onions and half of cheese. Place in pastry shell or pie crusts. Top with the rest of the cheese.     Bake at 375F for 30-35 minutes, until golden. A knife inserted into the center should come out clean.       HASH BROWN QUICHE    3 c. shredded hash brown potatoes (3. grated potatoes)  1/3 cup butter, melted   seasoning salt to taste   1 c. diced mushrooms (optional)  1/4 cup chopped onion   1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese   2 eggs   1/2 cup milk   salt and pepper to taste   ______________________________________...

Salt and pepper all of the chicken. Place flour on a plate and coat the chicken (including the tenderloins) on both sides with flour, pressing to make sure it adheres. Shake off excess flour. In a large, heavy skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot, add the chicken pieces to the skillet, without crowding the pan, work in batches and add more oil if necessary. Saut chicken for 4 minutes, without moving, it will become nicely brown. Adjust the heat--up or down if needed. Turn the cutlets and continue to saut for an additional 2 to 3 minutes until chicken is evenly browned and cooked throughout, (tenderloin pieces take less time, 2 minutes per side) Transfer the chicken to a plate and remove the skillet from the heat. Sauce: Add the pineapple with the juice, brown sugar, soy sauce, ginger, cloves, paprika and salt. Return the skillet to medium heat and stir for a minute. Add the tablespoon of flour and continue to heat the sauce, stirring to collect any remaining juices and brown bits from pan, and allowing it to thicken slightly (about 2 minutes).

Buy preprepared pesto (in a jar but spag. sauce)  sliced mozerella  boneless skinless chix breast    Heat oven to 350  grease a deep baking dish with olive oil  cut a slit in the chix breast ( do not cut all the way through just make a pocket)  take a slice of cheese put a scoop of pesto sauce on it and roll it loosly and stuff in the pocket of the chicken, close the pocket with a tooth pic.  Place it in the baking dish, when all the chiken is in the pan rub the pesto sauce on the top of the chicken.  Bake it for about 40- 45 mins.  Goes great on a bed of agel hair pasta.    I would say prep time maybe 15 minutes at the most, then it just cooks in the oven til its done.  Super simple super delish....I made this tonight for dinner, I just made it up.

You can get tvp but doesn't seem particularly trendy at the moment and haven't tasted the stuff myself.  I don't mind vegetarian sausages but they do taste very vegetably.    I like making laksa using bought laksa paste and following the instructions on the jar but adding firm tofu instead of prawns and adding extra vegies (bok choy and red capsicum are my favourites).

So if it calls for self-rising, you have to add in the salt and baking  powder yourself to get it to rise.    But spelt actually is a type of wheat, so you can use it as you would regular wheat flour for something like bread.  Just be sure to add in your leavening agents and salt as required.

Use canned great northern or white beans.  Rinse them and mash them a bit or puree them in the whizzer.  Garbanzos are good as a sunstitute.   If you use hummus I would use the plainest you can find as the flavored ones might alter the flavor you are trying for.|`|AA12336927	Make it how you want, with what you want.

DFXS4SB4aa	Vegetables should not be vacuum sealed fresh. It is best to blanch them (place in boiling water until the are hot, yet still crunchy), then submerge in ice water to stop the cooking process. This will allow the vegetables to retain their color and firmness. You may then continue with the vacuum sealing. You can also freeze the fresh vegetables and then continue the vacuum sealing process. If this is not followed, they will emit a gas after they have been vacuum sealed that will interfere with the vacuum seal of the bag.    Any food, such as meat or fish, that is very moist, is best vacuum sealed after it has been frozen. The excess moisture in the food will interfere with the sealing phase. Likewise, more delicate foods, such as bread or fruit, which are likely to be compressed under the pressure of vacuum sealing should also be frozen first to help the product hold its shape.    Non-chamber units cannot vacuum seal liquids. To package liquid items, first freeze them into a solid form. They can then be vacuum packaged and stored in the freezer to maintain the frozen state.    Items that are in powder form, such as flour, sugar or spices, should be sealed in a package. If sealed loose, the powder will get sucked into the vacuum sealer and will eventually interfere with the vacuum sealer's performance.    http://www.sausagemaker.com/index.asp?Pa...

vvoz2jeyaa	if you left it out on the counter you need to feed sourdough starter every day or 2 days at the least. If it has been on your counter,stir it well and throw out the starter but 1/4 cup of it. in a clean container with no metal mix 1 1/3 cups of unchlorinated water with 1 3/4  cups unbleached AP flur and 1/4 cup whole wheat flour and let it set out for 24 to 36 hours until it bubbles. when it starts bubbling real heavily, remove 1/2 cup of the starter and repeat with another 1 1/3 cup unchlorinated water and 1 3/4 unbleached AP flour and 1/4 cup whole wheat flour. This process removes most of the toxins and reactivated the starter, it is called rinsing.     If your starter was kept in the refrigerator you only need to remove about 1 cup and feed it as normal. the reason in the fridge you need less feeding is because the cold temperatures slow the metabolisim of the yeast down so it only needs to be fed every 2 to 3 weeks.|`|d1ccf9053469ceab6ca29b6196c67c35aa	It partially depends on where you're keeping it (refrigerated or room temp, as it keeps longer when it's chilled). The only way to really know is to feed it and see if there's any activity. Throw half of it out, feed it with an equal measure each of flour and water, and leave it out at room temp. It may take a few feedings to come back to full activity, maybe once a day. Also - if there is a pinkish film on top, that means that bacteria have gotten into it, and it must be thrown out.    Hope this helps.|`|aDL7xmt6aa	It'll die or stink|`|lLPIs7WFaa	Throw in a handful of raisins and 1/2 cup of flour, stir it in and put it out somewhere wqarmish.

Use bread starter as the foundation of a bread recipe. The starter requires "feeding." So gather a few ingredients, combine them and watch your bread starter grow.    Things Youll Need:        * 2 1/4 tsp. yeast or 1 package      * Warm water      * Sugar      * Instant potato flakes      * 1 wooden spoon      * 1 large glass or wooden bowl      * 1 large glass jar with a lid      Combine yeast and 1/2 cup of warm water in a large bowl. Stir the mixture until the yeast is dissolved.    Add the remaining 1 cup of warm water, 3/4 cup sugar and 3 tbs. instant potato flakes. Stir the mixture until completely combined.    Pour the mixture into a glass jar. Cover the top of the glass jar with a towel and allow it to sit at room temperature for 8 hours. After 8 hours, place the lid on the jar and refrigerate for 3 days.    Remove the starter from the refrigerator after 3 days and "feed" the starter with 1 cup of warm water, 3/4 cup of sugar and 3 tbsp. of instant potato flakes.    Stir the mixture until it is completely combined. Cover the top of the glass jar with a towel and allow it to sit at room temperature for 8 hours.    Measure 1 cup of the starter to make your first loaf of sourdough bread. Store the remaining mixture in the glass jar in the refrigerator.    Repeat Steps 4 to 6 to re-feed the starter and make another loaf of sourdough bread after four days.

fskCvWWiaa	Yep truffles are in the mushroom family.. distantly.  As they are both fungi.  Mushrooms are grown above ground and some can be poisonous as we all know.  Truffles are more rare than mushrooms are very much more expensive and are found underground.  I would consult your doctor or allergy specialist just to be on the safe side.  Besides truffles cost too much for the average person.|`|mlmSRkhGaa	I would steer clear of truffles if you know you are allergic to spore-type vegetation.|`|iHFZLsDTaa	Play it safe and leave them alone.|`|AA11962763	Mushrooms grow above ground and truffles grow underground, but they are botanically related.  They're both types of fungus.  If you're allergic, I'd steer clear until you consult with an allergist.|`|OQge8bqYaa	Yes.  Truffles are in the mushroom family.  I wouldn't risk it.

About 20mins to cook I'd put it in the middle of the oven.|`|QWY0P98Haa	You can also pound the breast flat, roll the cheese and bacon inside the breast close with a skewer and salt and pepper then brown in a pan, when brown add a little white wine or chicken broth put the lid on and simmer for about 15 min.

NNiN0tK0aa	Onion Bhajis, Vegetable Pakoras, Vegetable Samosas, Lentil Dhal.....|`|p9rIPd4Maa	I'm very lucky to live near a vegetarian run and owned indian shop and they have many exotic products in there! Curries in general are vegan! Just avoid the meat laden curries, and curries with cream, milk and cheese in them!    Palak Paneer is my fav vegetarian indian dish!    Spinach  1/2 kg  Paneer 100 grams  Onion 1  Butter 3 tbsp.  Bay leaves 2-3  Cumin seeds 1 tsp.  Salt to taste    Black pepper powder 1/4 tsp.  Ginger-garlic paste 3/4 tsp.  Green chilli paste 1/2 tsp.  Garam Masala Powder 1 tsp.  Vegetable oil as required          1.  Mix ginger-garlic paste, green chilli paste and some water with spinach. Pressure cook it for about 7-8 minutes (just before the first whistle).  2. Cut paneer into small cubes. Keep 3 cubes separately for decoration.  3. Heat oil in a pan. Fry the paneer pieces on 'medium' heat till they turn slightly brown. Set the paneer pieces aside.  4. Heat 2 tbsp. of butter. Fry bay leaves and cumin seeds. Add chopped onion. Fry until the onions become pink.  5. Add salt, black pepper powder, garam masala. Stir well.  6. Add paneer and cooked spinach (grinded). Mix well.  7. Put palak paneer in a baking tray .  8. Add rest of the butter. Bake for 1/2 hour at 180 deg C.      It isn't the easiest to make, but it sure is delicious... (Replace the butter with margarine, works the same. The paneer might be a toughy to get past, if you're vegan, but I'm sure there is a substitute vegan cheese you could use - wouldn't be the same though =[)|`|cfdc405defe60d37e2129e3f90174096aa	As a vegan you will want to ask if they use Ghee an Indian clarified butter, some will for cost purposes only use vegetable oil, you will want to avoid some of the Tandoori dishes as they marinate in yougart, Dals made with chickpeas and lentils are a good idea, spinach dishes, but paneer is cheese, Potato dishes like Aloo Goobi,  Eggplant, Okra, plain or Jeera rice ar fine, but again check if the add butter to fluff it, the naan can be ordered or requested with out butter, but chapati is whole wheat and the dough has no dairy in it.    Just read the menu and ask questions, tell them you eat no animal products, dairy and butter, and what can they recommend or what is on the menu to choose from, I ama former chef from Canada, and I am currently a lacto-ovo vegetarian, and here in Toronto Canada we have many choices, I generally go to Indian Buffets so I can pick and choose plus I have control over the food and portion sizes.

If anyone asks, just say you don't feel like cheese, or that particular cheese doesn't taste right to you. Or, of course, you could go to  1 again.    Good luck.

v4vQSzu4aa	I hear you on this one, I'm kinda sick of the same 'ole toppings myself, so I wander about the frozen vegetable isle during the Winter time, seeing as most of the produce section is full of chemically grown veggies. I get some fresh greens, (love mixing them up, Spinach, Romaine, Green/Red Leaf, Iceburg, Bok Choy, Chinese Cabbage) and so on, toss in some freshly cooked steamed veggies (steamed, then chilled) then add them to my normal toppings, change up your dressings, add on some toasted nuts or some big baked croutons, over a bed of seasoned rice or small pasta.  Serve your delicious salad with some large chunks of steak, chicken, duck, oven roasted pork or turkey, or put some warmed tortilla wraps on the table and let your family make their own salad wraps (putting all of the toppings separate) Forget the heavy dressings and put out some citrus wedges with Lemon/lime juice, Balsamic/Red Wine Vinegar and Light Olive Oil,  fresh herbs like Basil, Parsley, Cilantro, Dill, Thyme...........this way you and your family can appreciate the simplicity of flavors without a sugary, caloric salad dressing and it could be less expensive.  Anyways, I hope some of these suggestions help you out today and healthy eating to you!|`|9z5NASypaa	Warm lamb salad with raspberry and mint dressing    cooked lamb sliced, lettuce, tomato, red onion, feta cheese, pine nuts.

We shredded/cut the turkey into bite sized pieces into a casserole dish and mixed it with the veggies (corn and peas in our case) and the gravy (if you don't have gravy, some cream soup or a little stock/broth will do) make sure you use just enough to coat/moisten everything.  Lastly we topped it with the mashed potatoes, leaving a 1/2 inch gap around the edge of the potatoes from the dish sides, cut a tablespoon of butter into 9 cubes and dotted the potatoes on top with that, and sprinkled a little cheddar cheese on top, you can use Parmesan cheese too.  Bake if at 350 for 20 minutes or so, just till its all reheated through, and serve.|`|AA11689643	not a casserole, but you can make fried rice with it instead of chicken.|`|36a3ynpJaa	Use Tuna Helper Alfredo and just substitute turkey for the Tuna.  I also add in some frozen peas and shredded carrots and then top it with crushed Triscuits when it's in the casserole dish.

You take a scoop of the filling in a bowl and top it with a pie crust.
xACwWEXHaa	I had an aunt who used to say that she made wonderful scratch cakes- she scratched the top right off the box and followed the directions.  :)    I have an idea that isn't what you meant though.  "From scratch" means different things to different people.  Some think it's only from scratch if you soak the beans and stew raw tomatoes for chili, but others think  soaking the beans and adding canned tomato sauce is sufficient to call it scratch, if you add your own spices and herbs.    I make many things from scratch now that I'm not working, but not everything.  Some days I just do not have the time or energy, and I keep canned beans on hand for just such days.  It isn't canned chili, but it isn't "scratch" either.    Cooking bread from scratch is a big deal, but the rewards are worth it.  Except for very special occasions, we buy bread already baked.  Hot rolls fresh from the oven onto the dinner plate  make the meal, even a very simple meal, seem wonderful.  I remember beans and ham-bone, a "poor man's meal," with hot bread and home-made butter as being one of the best meals of all those feasts my mother ever made.  But one has to be able to put hours into preparation.  You mix the dough, work it then let it rise, punch it down and work it again, let it rise again, all before it goes into the oven.  Much of the time involved is simply waiting for the yeast to do its thing, of course, but it still takes hours from starting to putting the bread on the table.  My husband is the baker, and makes breads and pies always from scratch, but only, again, for special occasions.    I make most meals with a combination of methods.  For economy, I buy canned tomatoes. They are far more reasonably priced than stewing fresh tomatoes in this area, especially in winter.  I used prepared tomato paste, prepared mustard, prepared catchup and relish.  I don't stuff my own hot dogs, either, though my mother did all these things literally from scratch, including butchering the hog and grinding the sausage.    I do cook some because I enjoy it, but mostly I cook from scratch so I can control the ingredients in the food I present to my family.|`|1wNsBNmxaa	yes i make home made lasagna & i make home made apple & cherry pies from scratch in no it is not hard to read the directions yes it is worth it once you get a hang of it the next thing you know you will be cooking up every thing in the house    D?mon~~?|`|hT7BhNamaa	D.O.T. 99% of the time I cook from scratch, but admittedly I do get lazy and cheat at times.

FicyC2TXaa	I can't account for your weight loss/gain or comment on soya's role in it or otherwise, although it seems unlikely soya is the culprit here.    But just to comment on a couple of other issues raised here:    The whole issue of soya, oestrogen and cancer; Soya proteins contain isoflavones that can mimic a weak oestrogen effect. It's not the same as the oestrogen your own body makes though - it is 1,000 times weaker than your own body's oestrogen, but it's this that has led to concerns (and rumour) about oestrogen dependent cancer.    There is no actual scientific evidence that soya causes, prevents, contributes to or affects the progress of any cancer, including oestrogen positive breast cancer, which is the one most often cited. There are those in the field who argue that isoflavones may be of help in preventing breast cancer or be beneficial to women who have had breast cancer.    There is current research into whether increasing phyto oestrogens in the diet helps to prevent breast or prostate cancer, and a study in 2002 found that women with the highest levels of soya products in their diets had the lowest breast density - higher breast density being associated with higher breast cancer risk.    Women with the highest levels of isoflavones in their diet are reported to have significant risk reductions for uterine cancer.    There are concerns about soya and certain thyroid conditions, but I don't have sufficient knowledge to comment on that.    In the UK at least, any product using soya that's genetically modified must be labelled as such    So, while there's controversy there's little in the way of evidence; soya in moderation is fine.|`|AA12031316	I think soy is one of the very worse things you can put in your body.  Most soy in the US and UK (even organically GROWN soy) has been genetically modified, making it no longer a natural food.  Soy has been spliced with the DNA of so many different things, including scorpion venom to make the crops pest resistant, pesticides, herbicides, and fungicides, etc (google "roundup ready soy)  We are not just talking about things sprayed on the crops during growing, but actually altering the DNA structure of the actual seed-and all of those DNA splices become part of the "food".  To me, its the equivilant of altering the DNA of a human with that of a leopard to make us run faster-it just doesn't add up.  Since soy has had the DNA of many other plant and weed species added to it, it is the single leading cause of adult onset food allergies.  Allergies were uncommon in adults until GMO soy was introduced in the US, and almost unheard of in the UK until soy turned up as a major import.  There is just far too much controversy surrounding soy.  Sadly, its next to impossible to avoid in foods, and even harder in non food things.  Soy is the basis for most inks used in pens, newspapers, clothing dyes, etc.  It really creates problems for those of us severely allergic to it.|`|p9rIPd4Maa	In terms of weight loss I can only say one thing - calories.    Calories are simply a measurement of that invisible thing physicists came up with centuries ago, "energy". Granted, it's a different sort of energy, but it's energy nonetheless. As a defence mechanism, nature gave us the ability to store energy, which we call Fat. Just something mother nature gave us for those rainy days when food was not so available. When our calories fall below our BMR and required calories for that day, our body seeks the remaining calories from fat.     When we eat more calories than we require, our body quickly stores it because it knows that this might not last for ever. Survival of the fittest - or more accurately, survival of the fattest.     Count your calories, you may have been eating too many calories (with the tofu) and when you stopped it, your calorie intake dropped..    You could actually be losing muscle mass, now that your most readily available source of protein is gone. I don't recommend dropping soy protein from your diet - maybe just don't rely on it heavily.     Count your calories for a week on tofu, and a week off. Get back to me!      beebs: "Soy has been spliced with the DNA of so many different things"      --  And yet meat is completely free from Genetic Modification? Please, all those antibiotic, growth hormones and steroids, GMing those poor animals go through is nothing compared to soybeans...  Oh and some companies actually sell non-GM tofu, and soy products - maybe you should have a look at those instead.|`|6e34f1c3efbd3d63fb5b79e4334e8388aa	All soy, unless it absolutely says "organic" is genetically modified with Monsanto's famous Round Up Ready pesticide. This means the pesticide has become part of the soy, so you are eating it. As with all GM foods, these new synthetic bacterias do not leave the body after ingesting, creating severe bloating and weight gain since our bodies do not know how to process it. (It's not natural!)...    Besides the GM issue, even organic soy is not healthy. It was never meant to be a food product. Soy raises estrogen levels and in women can cause breast cancer and other issues.     I left a few videos on the subject.|`|nRObJuJeaa	only if its genetically modified, but that goes for all foods. just make sure that any soy product you buy says that its not genetically modified. For example, if you look at a carton of Silk Soy milk, on the back it will say that the beans used to make the soy milk weren't genetically modified. Like I said, it isn't just soy.|`|L0a3Q1Rqaa	I've never had a problem with soy, and neither have the Chinese who have been eating it for thousands of years. It sounds like you may have a soy allergy. Many soy dishes are high in salt too, so that may be the problem.|`|b9wICW1Paa	Soy has been the subject of controversy lately.  Commonly touted as a "superfood," soy may not be quite what the public has been led to believe in the past 15-20 years or so.      One issue is that soy contains a number of "anti-nutrients," including phytic acid, which interfere with the absorption of many important minerals, including calcium, magnesium, copper, and zinc.  These anti-nutrients are only minimized/eliminated by extensive soaking and fermentation.  The Chinese and other Asian countries who are noted for their soybean consumption, do so traditionally in the form of soy sauce, natto, and tempeh, foods that all undergo extensive fermentation.  Tofu is also consumed, which is not extensively fermented but is soaked.  Even the famous "China Study," conducted by T. Colin Campbell, indicated average daily legume consumption in subjects to be an average of 13 grams per day, or approximately 3 tablespoons.  A condiment, yes, but certainly not a staple.    The typical soybean product in the US, UK, and Europe is likely to consist of highly processed, additive and preservative-laden meat analogs and others such as soy milk, soy burgers/hot dogs, Textured Vegetable Protein, soybean oil, and the like, none of which has undergone much soaking and little, if any fermentation.  All anti-nutrients will not be eliminated or even significantly reduced in many of these products.      One of the most potentially tragic consequences of the soy health craze is its use in infant formula.  Although adults are not free from any potentially harmful effects, I can imagine that growing infants, who require significant amounts of fat, fat soluble vitamins, and cholesterol for development, are especially vulnerable.      So to answer your question, soy can certainly be bad for your health, if it is not properly prepared.  It is not necessary to avoid properly prepared soy products, but as with any other food, moderation is recommended.

Hencefourth, if you were to perhaps take all three of the suggestions into account, i believe your 'alien' would be a satisfied one!    p.s. the levels and strengths of the differening textures plays a large role in an 'aliens' diet, and can determine whether an alien will be slimmer (i.e tough food), or larger (i.e soft food)    I hope this helps you!
hKlsJgVSaa	Okay so it is your bio cousin that wont eat? Pretty lengthy explination sorry.    When you are so young even if they had grown up together and not been spoiled that would be a hard situation for a child.    Why don't you take your cousin to do something special? Just a girls day, or even plan a picinic, pb&j's choc milk, chips, fresh fruit and candy bars for dessert.    It's not the healthiest meal but she may be more willing to eat if it is a special occasion for her. Explain to her that it is just a day for the 2 of you, or set up a day like that for her to have lunch with her Mom. do Mac and Cheese or Hot dogs, fries-tater tots or chips. Lemonade and soemthing simmy and funn for dessert.    Ask you aunt to keep it up at least every other month. And her hubby and step daughter can do the same. And then each parent can switch around each time so they each have quality time with each girl.    Other trip ideas would be the movies, putt putt golf, shopping at the mall, a nice dinner, make a meal together etc....    ***********  I am a little confused as to wich girl is not eating. But if it is the girl with cancer. I understand. I've been there.    She does need nutritious food but chemo does wierd things to you. I had cravings like a pregnant lady. I would wake up in the middle of the night craving a grilled cheese, and tomato soup sooo bad.     I was in the hospital after they put my catheter, It was 4 days before I ate anything. Thank goodness I was already in the hospital, and those nurses tried so hard. When I decided I was hungray I just wanted to broth from chicken noodle soup. I had like 4 bowls.    Stuff tastes different because all cells are being killed off even healthy ones. I had a lot of cooton mouth, the best thing to get rid of it was holding cola (it's fizzier) in my mouth and letting it bubble out. No matter how many times I brushed my teeth nothing worked as well as the soda.    I also found sour stuff could take away a lot of the nasty tastes in my mouth. Something like warheads sour drops.    Untill she starts wanting real food her parents should not try to force her into eating anything she doesn't want.    Right now if she wants cheetos and a slice of apple pie that's what she should get. After she gets her appetite back then she can start eating better meals.|`|Eb3SnljMaa	what any of this story has to do with what to feed the child is beyond me but anyway...    its a sad case when a child gets cancer, everyone pretty much feels helpless that there is not more they can do. but what this child needs is proper attention and nutrition. she apparently is still very young but she still needs fruits and veggies, healthy meals and snacks...the doctor too I am sure can give a diet plan if she needs one..or ways to help her eat. the chemo makes you not want to eat much because you feel ill, may have to doctor some thigns up so they taste a little better for her some how tooo. chemo sometimes tends to make your food taste metalic which just sucks even more so for a child who dont completly understand what is even going on with her.    as far as the other child she too is very young and will just have to learn and try to understand that jade is sick...    I am making note of the black molassoss I have never heard that before I will be looking it up in a few minutes. that is something new to me and something good to know.    I hope for the best for this family...|`|xFv6LirIaa	The meals should be healthy with lots of antioxidants to help her.  Welch's grape juice has lots of antioxidants and many veggies taste good with dips such as ranch dressing or peanut butter. Lean meats like chicken breast but try a mustard sauce over it.  Do research on Black strap molasses.  It has been known to shrink tumors by taking a tbsp or 2 a day.  But it has to be BLACK strap molasses.

Cuban Crema Fraiche recipe        Creme Fraiche is a cultured heavy cream. It thickens and develops a delicate sour taste as it sits. It is not normally used in traditional Cuban or Spanish Cuisines, but I find it wonderful to use when making sauces or as toppings for desserts.      *Wonderful spooned over fruit desserts and fresh berries.  *Use it to add body and richness to sauces. Since it can be boiled without curdling or fear of separation, it is more versatile than dairy sour cream.  *Stir in a few spoonfuls into butter-warmed vegetables for a simple sauce.  *Whisk a dollop into salad dressing for extra thickness and creaminess.  *Since creme fraiche can keep in refrigerator for at least 2 weeks, it is convenient to have some around all the time.    1 cup heavy cream (not ultra-pasteurized)  1 cup dairy sour cream    Whisk heavy cream and sour cream together in a bowl. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let stand in kitchen or other reasonably warm spot overnight, or until thickened. In cold weather this may take as long as 24 hours.    Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, after which the crema fraiche will be really thick. The tart flavor will continue to develop as the creme fraicha sits in the refrigerator.

FNjnYvz2aa	Make a chicken pie.     Here's a super easy -recipe.     Buy 2 pre-made crusts at the store, and a can of cream of chicken soup, and a can of veg-all. :)     Strip the chicken from the bones, making sure it's clear of all skin and fat and tear it into bite-sized pieces then put it in a bowl. Drain the can of Veg-all and put it in with the chicken. Pour in the can of cream of chicken soup. Mix in a little cream or milk, season with salt, plenty of fresh ground black pepper and a dash of onion powder and garlic powder to taste and mix it all up in the bowl until all ingredients are combined.     Put one crust in the bottom of a pie plate. Put the filling in the bottom crust, and then put the second crust on top. Crimp the two edges of the crust together by either pressing them together with the tines of a fork or pinching them together with your fingers to form those pretty bumps on the edges. Cut a few slits in the top of the crust for air to escape.     Next, take an egg and separate it using the shell to shell method (Here's a decent tutorial for that: http://southernfood.about.com/cs/eggreci... sure to reserve the white in a separate bowl. Discard yolk and shells. Beat the egg white until slightly foamy and then brush over the top crust and the edges of the pie. This will give it that pretty shine when it bakes and help the crust get golden brown. If you don't want to go to all the trouble, just brush with milk. It won't have the shine, but it'll get nice and golden anyway. :)     Bake in an oven preheated to 375 degrees for about thirty to forty-five minutes, or until the top crust is golden brown. Let sit at least twelve minutes before cutting and serve with mashed potatoes or a fresh green salad and enjoy! :)|`|py0DpCh4aa	TORTILLA TURKEY STACKS   2 7-inch flour tortillas   3/4 cup chopped cooked turkey or chicken   1 tablespoon bottled fat-free Thousand Island salad dressing   1 TB bottled chunky salsa   1-1/2 ts thinly sliced green onion   1/2 C canned vegetarian refried beans   1-1/2 C shredded lettuce   1/2 of a medium tomato, chopped   1/4 C shredded reduced-fat Monterey Jack cheese or reduced-fat Colby and Monterey Jack cheese     1.

Chicken and Cheese Mexican Lasagna  You will need:  cooked chicken shredded perferred, 1-2 packages of big tortilla shells, 1 large can of enchilada sauce (i like the mild, old el paso brand), 1 can of Cream of Chicken soup, 1 can of black beans, 1 slab of velveeta cheese, 1 can of original rotel (optional)    In a pot on medium heat, melt a pretty big chunk of velveeta cheese, (add a bit of water to the cheese, it helps with the melting).    Add 1 can of Cream of Chicken soup.  When it's all melty, add your cooked leftover chicken.    Stir.    Add 1 can of black beans, and if you like tomatoes, add 1 can of Original Rotel.  Mix together.     Now, you have your chicken and cheese mixture ready.  And like lasagna here comes the layering!    In a square baking pan, lightly grease bottom with Pam.    Now take your tortilla shells, and cut them all in half.    Layer the bottom of the pan evenly with shells.  When your done with the layer of shells, add the Chicken and Cheese mixture.    Add another layer of shells.  Add another layer of mixture.  Add another layer of shells.   (in total there should be 3 layers of shells, and 2 layers of cheese and chicken)  Top it all off with the Enchilada Sauce, and sprinkle with some cheddar cheese.    Bake at 375-400 degrees, for 20 to 25 minutes, or until cheese and sauce are bubbly!  Cut like lasagna pieces, and serve with a side of sour cream!  Enjoy!    Hope I helped, don't hesitate to e-mail for more recipes.

Or saute the rice in a little butter or olive oil with a handful of broken spagetti or orzo pasta, just until the rice is translucent and the pasta is light brown.  Then cook the rice as usual with an extra splash of water.    For something really exotic try Middle Eastern style rice pilaf.  Saute a small handful of pinenuts, a minced onion and about 1/4 lb of ground beef or lamb - add salt & pepper and allspice.  When browned, add the rice and water and cook as usual.

Most Irish find the whole idea amusing actually.  Irish food consists more of Roasts and Stews.    The primary meats are Beef and Lamb.    Irish bacon looks more like our pork chops and is not only eaten with breakfast but can be cut thick and called served as a pork Chop.  I have had Pork Belly (what the US makes into Bacon) roasted and braised, served on a bed of Mash(ed Potatoes).  Deep dark stews of lamb or beef, or sometimes Mutton, cooked with a dark beer as the liquid.  The seafood is also incredible, the place is an Island after all.|`|7810b482021aa21d7006247d38601648aa	corned beef and cabbage and carrots. serve with boiled potatoes and youve got a true irish meal.  suki|`|usxeet5vaa	I really am obsessed with mashed potatoes, and so that's my fave Irish food.

It might just be the ones I've heard of.

LDREvRKGaa	Even many who do not drink wine may know this.  Tannin. It is what gives red wines an astringent quality.   But wine is often described in terms of many flavors. Flowers, grass, plum, cherry and Vanilla are all used to describe the taste of wine.  But for universal taste. Sugar and acid ( sourness )|`|WKKdQq2Aaa	Tannins.|`|TIJNWt77aa	Currants, Chocolate, Pepper.|`|W1MgefrWaa	Tannin?|`|60kK01PXaa	grapes|`|O8qdCBzLaa	Different wines have different flavors that naturally occur by using different kinds of grapes, blending juices together, and using different aging techniques. This produces various undertones (just a hint of those flavors) on the palate that can taste like certain kinds of foods.    For example, some red wines can have chocolate, raspberry, pomegranate, or even blueberry undertones. Some white wines can have citrus, pear, apple, vanilla, or even butter undertones.|`|c1d312af4250951e942d357ba46d734caa	I don't know about ingredient, but depending on the wine there are lots of different notes you can pick up on.  I do have one in my collection though that I bought because it was unique.  Before it was filtered, the winemaker soaked the Cabernet with green bell peppers.  The resulting wine is heavy and spicy with a faint bell peppery taste.  Its so weird I had to buy a bottle.

4Z8wogroaa	I HATE tofu, but then my sister made me get the tofu from Panda Express, and now I ALWAYS want it. it's SO good. so don't rule it out completely! there's many different ways to make it taste good.    I told my parents that it was a personal choice and that it's my body and I know how to take care of it, and all in all it's really my choice what goes into it.    Getting rid of meat is easier than one might think, first of all just start incorporating things like Morningstar warm ups (the veggie buffallo wings are so good), Boca burgers, those sort of things, and then with getting rid of meat, just tell yourself exactly what it is that you're eating, and make yourself know that what you're eating isn't just food, an animal died against their will so that you could eat it.  not so appetizing, haha.    and cutting out junk food is a gradual thing, once you start eating it less and less you'll start feeling better and your body will respond very well, and that alone is enough motivation I think, but you can also just keep your mind aware that it's very bad stuff you're putting into your body.    you should get a multi-vitamin for teens or something so that your parents won't worry about you not getting enough vitamins and all that stuff, too. =)|`|BiWbEMXtaa	Morning Star & Boca are very good vegan food brands,  they have a lot of things!  I loooveeeee their hamburgers, corndogs, chicken, and their rice-patties, they're really good and appetizing.

Y8YsL4pMaa	I have soooooo many!!!  Here are a couple I have tried multiple times and LOVE...    Sausage, Peppers, and Onions - Giada De Laurentiis    1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil   1 pound sweet Italian turkey sausage   2 red bell peppers, sliced   2 yellow onions, sliced   1 teaspoon kosher salt   1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper   1/2 teaspoon dried oregano   1/2 cup chopped fresh basil leaves   4 garlic cloves, chopped   2 tablespoons tomato paste   1 cup Marsala wine   1 (15-ounce) can diced tomatoes   1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes, optional   4 to 6 fresh Italian sandwich rolls, optional     Heat the oil in a heavy large skillet over medium heat.

Add the tomato paste and stir. Add the Marsala wine, tomatoes, and chili flakes, if using. Stir to combine, scraping the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon to release all the browned bits. Bring to a simmer.     Cut the sausages into 4 to 6 pieces each, about 1-inch cubes. Add the sausage back to the pan and stir to combine. Cook until the sauce has thickened, about 20 minutes.     Serve in bowls with penne pasta. Or, if serving as a sandwich, split the rolls in half lengthwise. Hollow out the bread from the bottom side of each roll, being careful not to puncture the crust. Fill the bottom half of the roll with sausage mixture. Top and serve sandwiches immediately.

2577f0992ce02aa0bade7b777b040d17aa	a sourdough starter does make a sourdough sour.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sour_dough  I hope it helps.|`|QmIK2vgqaa	Pretty sure it's the sour stuff.|`|dCzoIUP7aa	It does a lot of sitting, and rising. It is not really sour but it is called sour since it sits out so long.    Obviously it is the yeast that causes the chemical reaction, it is used in a lot of bread. So why isn't every bread "sour"? Well know it all's? Get out of the kitchen and into a classroom. The amount of fermentation, like one person mentioned, is what earned it the name "sour dough". Like I said from sitting and allowing the chemical reaction to take it's time. What happens when you leave milk out? It sours. What happens when you leave out un-pasteurized goats milk? It sours, but unlike cows milk it is used in many things and tastes great.    Well it looks like this is a show down. I have managed to get the most thumbs down. This is just weird.    Yes Richard K and Wize woman, those are techniques used in making sourdough. Good job!!! That wasn't the question. *sigh*. Also, people shouldn't just leave links to Wikipedia. It's a great source of info but if people wanted to fumble through a 10,000 word discourse from an internet based encyclopedia to find a little bit of info they want then they wouldn't use Y!A. The point is to answer their questions as best as possible. I would rather give the best answer I can than run around tossing links and saying look it up yourself. Add a link as your source or as an addition to what you display.

Chris|`|53giV6PFaa	I don't know if it's perfect, but I do consider mine really good.    The key is to season your beaten eggs before you cook them.

I like sauteed onions, mushroom, and green pepper.  I also add ham and cheese to that too.    Butter my skillet over medium heat.  Pour in thte mixture and cook until the eggs set.  Put the toppings on 1/2 of it, then flip.    I then top my omelet with warmed salsa and cheese.  Turn the heat off and  put the lid on for a minute or so the cheese melts.

Sorry mate I dont know|`|QEEweJUaaa	Introduction  Legend has it that while camping outside the French town Bessieres, Napoleon tried a local innkeeper's new dishan omelet. Bonaparte was so impressed that he ordered the people of Bessieres to collect all the eggs in the village to prepare one large omelet for his men.   Making an omelet is fairly straightforward. Once you know the basic principles of how to prepare the egg, adding the ingredients is at your discretion.   Step 1: What you will need   A medium-sized non-stick skillet. Photo by Mahalo.A stove (you can't cook an omelet without it).   A medium/large non-stick skillet.   One spatula for working the eggs.   One fork or egg beater to whisk the eggs.   One bowl for mixing the eggs.   Oil (canola or olive), cooking spray (PAM) or butter.   3 eggs are the preferred amount. You will be safe with anywhere between 2 and 4.   Milk is optional.   Ingredients to fill your omelet. Cheese, ham, onion, tomato, bell peppers, sausage, bacon and mushroom are popular.   Ingredients that are placed on top of the omelet once it has been cooked, such as salsa, avocado, sour cream and cilantro.   Step 2: Preparing the food   Three eggs, cheese, green onion, mushrooms and ham are just some of the ingredients you can use. Photo by Mahalo.Get all of your ingredients ready before you turn on the stove. This will make cooking your omelet much easier.   Break the eggs and place them in your bowl. Add milk if desired (this makes the eggs fluffier).   Take your fork or egg beater and whisk the eggs until the yolk has been broken.   For a fluffier omelet, whisk the eggs more than usual. The more you whisk the eggs, the more air gets in them. The more air you have in your eggs, the fluffier they will be.   Grate your cheese.   Cut up all of your vegetables and prepare any meat you will be putting in your omelet.   Step 3: Start cooking  There are two basic philosophies when it comes to cooking an omelet. One is the 'flip', while the other utilizes the 'fold'. The first eight steps are virtually the same; then they branch out.    Saute your ingredients. Photo by Mahalo. Spread the egg evenly across the pan surface. Photo by Mahalo.Turn on the stove to medium/high.   Coat the skillet with either the oil, spray or butter and place onto the stove.   Wait for the skillet to get hot and add any vegetables/meat. This is a must if you plan on using the 'flip' technique. If you plan on doing the 'fold' method you can pre-cook your meat and veggies or you can add them in prior to the fold.   Use your spatula to help stir the ingredients. You won't have to do this for long because they will still be cooking once you add your egg.   After a minute or so, add the egg.   With your spatula, push the egg from the outer edge of the skillet toward the center. This allows the runny egg on top to spread out to open skillet space and cook.   You can also tilt the pan so that the egg runs to open areas.   Continue to do this until the egg starts to turn white and the edges get a little crispy.   Now you need to decide whether to use the "flip" technique or the "fold" technique.   (The 'flip' technique)  The 'flip' technique is flashy, fun and all in the wrist. It might take a few flips to perfect, but it's worth a try. Remember, if you want to make an omelet, you will have to break a few eggs. In this case, if you want to flip an omelet, you will have to deal with a potential misfire. At any rate, a successful flip is almost as satisfying as the omelet itself.   picking up where we left off.....   Flip your omelet like a professional chef!     If the egg is stuck to the pan, add a touch of oil to the edge of the skillet and let it run down between the egg and the pan to provide lubrication.   Take the skillet off of the fire and move the omelet around so that you know it isn't stuck.   Now you are ready to flip. Very quickly, draw the skillet toward you and then in a sudden sharp movement thrust the pan away from you and flip the egg pancake. Hopefully, the eggs flipped and landed runny-side down. Because the eggs have been cooking, they won't need much more time on the skillet.   Once you have flipped the eggs, place your cheese in the middle so it can start to melt.   When you think that it's done, fold the egg into a semicircle with your spatula and slide it out of the skillet and onto your plate.   Garnish the top of your omelet with whatever you wish. More cheese, salsa, sour cream and avocado work very well.     Tip: If you are deathly afraid of ruining your omelet by flipping it, slide it out runny-side up onto a plate and then flip it back onto the skillet so that the runny side is face-down.     The 'fold' technique  The 'fold' technique is the preferred method of omelet-making. It is safer than flipping the egg, but not as risky, showy or fun.|`|gQ26TFYEaa	put however many eggs youu want in a jug, whisk them add salt and a little pepper and milk then pour into the pan so its like a big thick pancake then grate as much cheese as youu want and sprinkle on top, then if youu want add some other filling (spring onions really niice or peppers or whatever) then turn it over and the fold it in half    OMLETTE :D    theyre nice with seeeded bagels and brown sauce :)|`|432d817139a5e0be18e400a33e0e1908aa	Make a Spanish one ...     SPANISH OMELETTE    Serves 2     INGREDIENTS    1 potato  ? an onion  2 eggs  Ground pepper to taste  100ml of water  1 tablespoon of olive oil    METHOD    Peel the potato and chop it into 1cm (? inch) cubes. Peel the onion, cut it in half, chop one half into tiny pieces and save the other half.     Break the eggs into a bowl and pick out any bits of shell. Mix up the eggs. Season with the pepper.    Put the water into a saucepan on a medium heat. Bring to the boil, then turn down the heat until it is just boiling (simmering). Add the potato. Cook for about 5 minutes, checking that they do not fall apart. Drain the potato in a sieve or colander.     Put the oil in a frying pan on a moderate heat. Add the onion and potato. Fry the onion and potato, stirring to stop them sticking. When they are golden add the eggs.     Turn the heat down really low. Cover the pan. Leave it for 10 minutes.*    After about 5 minutes, turn the grill on to a medium heat.     Uncover the pan. Put it under the preheated medium grill for a couple of minutes until the top is brown.     Cut into triangular pieces.     ADDITIONS & ALTERNATIVES    An authentic Spanish omelette uses just onion and potato. However, omelettes are a good way of using up leftovers. Bacon, cheese, cooked ham, mushrooms, peas, sweet peppers and tomatoes all work well.     * Yes, 10 minutes. It wasnt a typing error. The low heat stops the egg sticking and the long, slow cooking makes the egg fluff up.     PS. I can't spell omlet, either.|`|a4e971e4ecd5f35c24d665e6dc1d67cbaa	Start with a good Teflon non-scratched saute pan Get pan very hot, add butter and small amount of oil (keeps butter from burning-higher melting range) Add eggs and roll pan as you are lifting the sides to allow the uncooked egg to be cooked. This goes fast but the best and with the heat, the omelet inflates. You can use slower heat but the finished product will not be the same. It takes practice to get the perfect omelet. One good thing is you get to eat the errors :)|`|vAtiLhloaa	By getting  someone else to make them.|`|DXtpSeb2aa	Okay, so heres what you do. Get a nonstick skillet and put it on the stove with the heat on Medium (not too hot or the eggs will burn). Put in about half a tablespoon of butter and let it melt    Crack the eggs into a measuring cup and add a little milk-I dont measure it, but its probably about two tablespoons for three eggs. You can make an omelet without milk, but I think it makes the eggs fluffier    Swirl the butter around in the skillet so its an even coat, and then pour in the eggs. And now, heres THE SECRET-hold a fork parallel to the eggs, and whip the surface of the eggs as they begin to set. This is what one of the Top Chef contestants did during the Quick Fire, and as soon as I saw it, I knew exactly why-it whips air into the top of the omelet so it will rise up and be more fluffy!    Some omelet recipes will tell you to lift the edges of the omelet and tilt the pan so the uncooked egg flows underneath. I do something different-I use a spatula to pull the cooked eggs into the center so that the edges can cook.    Keep gently pulling the cooked egg into the middle, if the uncooked egg isnt hitting the bottom of the pan you can tilt it a little. Once it is set, sprinkle cheese and any other toppings you like onto half of the omelet.    Slide the spatula under the side of the omelet opposite the cheese, and flip it over. Let it sit in the pan for a minute so the cheese will melt.     then serve!|`|hKlsJgVSaa	I do agree that you are opening a can of worms. Everyone has thier own way, and we all that way is perfect. Mine is also a bit wordy but I hope easier to follow than others. Here is my "prefect   omlet method.    Omlets    Cook what ever ingredients you want in the omlet first i.e. bacon mushrooms, bell pepper, ham etc..... (Yes even ham so it's not cold on the inside of your omlet.) Except the cheese.    Whisk together the eggs with a little milk or water, your choice but just a quick splash. Or put them in the blender for a really light and fluffy omlet.    Heat a medium sized pan on hi. Add butter, olive oil what ever fat you want to use. When the pan and oil are heated pour in the egg. Immedietly reduce the heat to medium low.    Using a spatula (I like the rubber ones best for this part) slowly scrape the edges in. The runny egg will fill in, in the "wake". Work your way around the pan until there is no more super runny egg.    Add the toppings and cheese, using a nice wide and firm spatula fold the omlet in half. Turn off the heat and leave for about 30 seconds, flip over andlet the omlet cook on residual heat for another 30-45 seconds. Slide out of the pan and if you are serving it to someone else then top with a little more cheese, and 1 piece of each of the toppings so that it is obvious what is inside|`|t3A9qpQIaa	If you can get through Freight Night's  windy instructions, I think he's got it covered.

Which would mean 7 1/2 tablespoons.    That is a lot of ginger.    http://www.fareshare.net/conversions-vol...      If you are talking fresh ginger, you wil be using significantly less.     While the calculation is imprecise, I will estimate that is about a 2 inch slice from an average root.    That will give you about 3-4 tablespoons.

I sort-of shaved half the bar with a knife and then cut the rest into bigger chip-sized chunks. You can make your own almond meal by pulsing almonds in a food processor until it is the texture of sand - don't go too far or you'll end up with almond butter. And lastly, the coconut oil works beautifully here, just be sure to warm it a bit - enough that it is no longer solid, which makes it easier to incorporate into the bananas. If you have gluten allergies, seek out GF oats.  3 large, ripe bananas, well mashed (about 1 1/2 cups)  1 teaspoon vanilla extract  1/4 cup coconut oil, barely warm - so it isn't solid (or alternately, olive oil)  2 cups rolled oats  2/3 cup almond meal  1/3 cup coconut, finely shredded & unsweetened  1/2 teaspoon cinnamon  1/2 teaspoon fine grain sea salt  1 teaspoon baking powder  6 - 7 ounces chocolate chips or dark chocolate bar chopped  Preheat oven to 350 degrees, racks in the top third.  In a large bowl combine the bananas, vanilla extract, and coconut oil. Set aside. In another bowl whisk together the oats, almond meal, shredded coconut, cinnamon, salt, and baking powder. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and stir until combined. Fold in the chocolate chunks/chips.The dough is a bit looser than a standard cookie dough, don't worry about it. Drop dollops of the dough, each about 2 teaspoons in size, an inch apart, onto a parchment (or Silpat) lined baking sheet. Bake for 12 - 14 minutes.

9cTAi7waaa	Ok you'll love this. Take an empty soda bottle or milk jug and cut the bottom off. Cut the container about halfway, keeping the top half. Take the piece at the top where your pour the soda or milk out of, and wrap foil all around it and poke little holes in it. Not too big or the green will fall through. Now thats obvioulsy where you put your green in.     Then seperatly, take a big deep pot (has to be deeper than the milk or soda container) or something big and fill it halfway with water. Now pack the soda bottle with your green and submerge the soda/milk container so it hits the bottom of the pot. Light it and slowly lift up and youll see the smoke pull into the container. Dont let the bottom of the container come up past the water it must always stay in the water. Once the container fills will smoke, take the foil piece off and suck the smoke in while at the same time push the bottle back down into the pot of water. Youll get a big hit that will do you good.

16e730ba39930a9906b368149bb74bbfaa	The best way to prepare it is to cut it in half, seed it, sprinkle with salt and olive oil and bake it in the oven until tender.  Once it's cool enough to handle, scrape out the flesh into a bowl.    You can do a number of things with it then, from adding it to a casserole or fritata,  or just serving it with tomato sauce.    But my personal favorite is to pan saute it with olive oil, butter and garlic, then finish it with pecorino cheese before serving.|`|HHDq9ajTaa	Bobby Y gave the instructions for cooking it. I will add that after it is soft, the pan sauteing with garlic and olive oil and topping with good Cheese is great for a side dish. I know it is a low calorie alternative to pasta noodles, and topped with Pasta Sauce is also delicious.  Our favorite way to cook it is, microwave it covered with plastic or saran wrap, I add butter to the middle and pancake syrup or brown sugar then wrap them up and nuke them for about 10 min, then with a pot holder I squeeze them to see if they are soft clear thru. If not I give them 3 more minutes or so. Then serve them in the shell if they are on the small side. If larger then I cut them in half after they are done and we just scrape them as we eat the center leaving the shell on the plate.  It is easy that way and fast for a hungry fella always looking over my shoulder, when I am cooking. My Italian is always hungry and nosey.|`|QRhQ2fLtaa	If you cook the squash, you can serve it with a fresh tomato sauce...     1 can of diced tomatoes      And some spices and herbs     simmer it down and spoon over!!! YUM!!|`|zFwjZy53aa	Bake it with a lot of butter, then sprinkle it with cheese|`|DXtpSeb2aa	You can prepare spaghetti squash in a variety of ways. Baked, boiled or micro waved are good ways to prepare spaghetti squash. Micro waving spaghetti squash is the fastest way to prepared it. Cut the spaghetti squash in half and scoop out the middle with the seeds in it. Then put the half spaghetti squash into the microwave and set the microwave on for about ten minutes on a high setting. After ten minutes take the spaghetti squash out of the microwave and poke it with a fork to see if it is soft. If it is still hard put it back into the microwave and let it cook a couple more minutes or until it is soft.     When the spaghetti squash is soft fluff it with a fork. Sprinkle it with salt and pepper to taste and serve it hot. Or you can serve it with tomato sauce like you would pasta spaghetti.     When you bake spaghetti squash prepare it the same way you would micro waved but bake it with aluminum foil over the top for a half hour at 350 degrees or until it is soft. then prepare it like you would after it has been micro waved.     Spaghetti squash is a favorite type of squash that can be cooked and used in many ways. It is easy to grow and it can be stored for months.|`|KUYQ9IMHaa	Make a chunky tomato/vegetable sauce, using mushrooms, peppers, onions, zucchini, broccoli - any combination of veggies you like. Or use a jarred sauce and add veggies to it.    After the squash is cooked (baking it cut side down is the easier way to do this) - toss it with olive oil and s & p. Then using either individual casseroles, or one big, fairly shallow one, pile in the squash, top with the tomato sauce, and then smother with grated cheeses - parmesan, monterey jack, white cheddar, a combination of any of those or just one.    Then bake until hot and bubbly and the cheese is melted.     This is a vegeterian dish we used to serve at a restaurant I worked at, and it's very good. But you can just as easily use a meat sauce, if that's what you prefer.|`|8bh0IGwJaa	I am making it tonight and what I am going to do is:    Get some jarred roasted red peppers, portabella mushrooms, fresh basil, fresh mozzarella balls, garlic and olive oil, salt/cracked pepper.

Maybe some good parmesan sprinkled on top.|`|ygTr3fvVaa	I've got two spaghetti squashes just waiting to be eaten.

I was one for eight months, to lose weight, and then recently became vegetarian when I learned of animal mistreatment. But it's just called semi-vegetarian. And also, over those eight months, I only lost three pounds out of the ten I wanted gone, so I guess white meat does a lot of damage to your body as well. Or, I guess, it could have been because my body is still growing. Your call on that one.|`|4Z8wogroaa	Halfatarian.  haha, that's what I used to call myself when I wasn't fully vegetarian yet.

ewUQuX4Kaa	Drinking water will help, but not cure it. Honestly it's the type of beer, as far as how many and what preservatives are used in the beer. All of the mass-market beers (Bud, Miller, Heineken, etc) add preservatives such as formaldehyde to prolong the shelf life of their brew. Some use more or less than others, and there are many types of preservatives.  Artificial ingredients such as these lead to headaches... or rather, speed up headaches which are also aided by dehydration.  Drink water no matter what you're drinking, but drinking better beer (esp local craft beer) will result in a much more pleasant morning after...

It's all about how much alcohol you drink.  No beer will give you a headache if you drink responsibly.  Only idiots drink too much.  Are you hanging out with idiots?|`|0ad3d9385a23d07ebf364d2182637b63aa	The underlying reason you get a headache after drinking any kind of alcoholic beverage (beer, mixed drinks ect.) is because alcohol dehydrates you. One of the symptoms of dehydration is a headache (actually the majority of headaches are caused by dehydration). Since beers vary in alcohol percent per volume (how much alcohol is actually in the beer), some beers have more alcohol so drinking 5 of one type of beer may be the same as 8 of a different type. Here's a tip: drink a couple of glasses of water before going to bed, and this reduces and possibly eliminates your hangover/headache.

He is a total advocate for me when we go out to eat, he always tells the waiter I am a vegetarian, so we know what is meat free and if it has chicken stock in it, etc.   The only problem is when he eats pork, it grosses me out, and I can smell it coming off his pours. Eeeeewwww LOL! Even then, we are okay!|`|6JcjVEsRaa	Why not? As long as neither one pushes their beliefs onto eachother, it should be fine. I wouldn't choose someone for their eating style alone though, there are more important things.|`|8gHbOG7Haa	I believe so , since I am in one. But it has it's ups and downs. Some of it will depend upon how strict your s/o is , like will he still kiss you after you had  cup of coffee with milk in it? Will he sometimes go out to eat at a place that serves meat to make you happy? Do you like vegetarian food, so if you go out with him you can both find something on the menu?   As long as he lays off lecturing you.  If he constantly makes side comments and says how disgusting it is or you are, or even things more subtle than that, it may drive you crazy and destroly the relationship. If he lets you know he loves you and doesnt try to convert you to veganism everytime you eat or make you feel like you are amoral because you eat meat, then everything should be fine. Just be willing to compromise and not comment too much on each others' lifestyles. .

They'll be rock hard, and flat. Won't rise properly.     What I do is mix the dough until all the wet ingredients are properly incorporated into the dry ingredients (at the most this should take five-six minutes). In cookies, some lumps are okay.:)

AA11962763	Italian pasta dishes freeze well, especially baked ones like lasagna.    So do baked Mexican dishes like tamales or enchiladas.    Empanadas or pasties are easy and fun.  Pizzas, too.    Stews, chilis and soups always freeze well.  Or get fancier with Osso Bucco or brisket.  Pretty much anything you can make in a slow cooker or a caserole, you can freeze.    All of these things can be made in bulk and then frozen in quart or gallon ziplok bags or small aluminum or plastic containers for individual or two-person servings.|`|J2Y5zx4Saa	-Stews/Soups  -Most casseroles will freeze well  -Pizza (bake the crust, put on toppings, and freeze)  -Mac and cheese  -Hambergers    I would recommend cooking up something such as a pound of ground beef that you can take out of the freezer and toss into something to make a meal out of. You could also stock up on foods from your freezer section of the grocery store.

Buy  some  thin  New York Strip  (already frozen  and  packaged  at  Walmart )  or  Rib Eye  Steaks  and  wrap  them  individually  in  foil,  they  will  thaw  out  quick  and  can  be  cooked  quickly.

xrRZeROmaa	This is from an on-line news source.  one particular peanut butter supplier, is currently being blamed for the salmonella outbreak that has caused recalls nationwide.  The reasons given for the recall are that this source, Peanut Butter Corporation of America, has not maintained proper cleanliness standards in its processing plants.  You can read this information in detail at the source listed below.  Google  "Sallmonella in peanut butter, and click on the site listed as source.    A combination of epidemiological analysis and laboratory testing by state officials in Minnesota and Connecticut, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have enabled FDA to confirm that the sources of the outbreak of illnesses caused by Salmonella Typhimurium are peanut butter and peanut paste produced by the Peanut Corporation of America (PCA) at its Blakely, Georgia processing plant.|`|2r4kfcJmaa	Salmonella and the symptoms are fever, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain.|`|tgEiSxVVaa	Peanuts them selves are nutricious. Its what can contaminate them in the preservation and preparation processes. I have mainly seen that salmonella has manifested somehow into the plants that produce peanut items. It may be from the transportation or just the country.|`|874EAxkfaa	ground round rats
2b2b44d6eca8fb7aaf87dfd1b1da9f9baa	There are other meat you can "eat pink" as well. Pork is now safe (due to different raising practices), duck, lamb, and plenty of fish you can eat when it's undercooked.    Salmonella is the main concern when eating undercooked chicken that can make you sick.|`|9UmP1s0Waa	pork and chicken eaten raw (even if its just a little) cause diseases...salmonella comes from raw chicken.    they have bacteria that needs to get killed off by the heat when you cook it.|`|AA11962763	You can eat lamb and pork pink, just not poultry.  Pork got a bad rep in the 1930s because of Trichinosis, which used to be a big problem.  But it was phased out with new processing techniques and there hasn't been a case reported in the U.S. since 1969.  still people overcook it and they also overcook lamb for no good reason.      Of course the amount of "pink" that works depends on the cut.  But as long as the interior of the meat reaches 137 degrees it's perfectly safe.  Beef can go down to 125 as long as it's not ground (bacteria lives on the surface, but when you grind it, it gets throughout).    So that's a long way around to say that beef isn't the only meat you can eat pink.  In fact, most wild game is fine rare or medium rare, just don't do it with poultry, more because of the texture than the health issues, because, as with meat, the bacteria lives on the surface.  As long as poultry reaches 137, it's safe, but not particularly appealing until around 145.|`|tgEiSxVVaa	Some reasons not to eat raw meat.    Trichinosis is a parasite found in the muscle of some meats. It use to be common in pork, but, according to the FDA, that is rare now. Looks like you have to watch out for wild game.    Salmonella is found in chicken and eggs.     E. coli in beef. It is safe to eat a rare steak if the outside is seared. Ground beef should be well done.     Pork tapeworm  is rare in this country. I watched a Discovery Health program where a number of people got this because food was prepared by infected people who had not washed their hands.     Here is the FDA list of foodbourne illnesses associated with seafood - some cooked and some raw. http://vm.cfsan.fda.gov/~mow/sea-ill.htm...    I have no idea how to be certain the raw meat is free of danger. I cannot guarentee that the apple that I eat or the lettuce I put in my salad tonight was safe either, but they are less likely to be contaminated than meat.     For tuna and salmon, I would buy sushi grade     I am sure there are websites about raw food diet. Yup! Here is a Wiki
AA11682618	wow please don't tell me we have been eating clone cow is this type of meat in our mcdonald and white castle hamburgers? if so i am going to become a vegan|`|AA11098327	No way, did you really read it?  It said the cost to clone was $10,000 to $20,000.  Any producer who would sell a clone for beef would be absolutely crazy because they would lose at least $9000 on the animal.  As a beef producer, I can assure you that the beef we are producing is done the old fashioned way.  We have cows, we have bulls.  They have calves and when the calves are old enough to be weaned, they are sold and eventually become your hamburger or steak.  Some producers do use artificial insemination, but it is too expensive for us.  Relax, it will be a long time (if ever) that you will have a choice of buying meat from a cloned animal.  I would imagine it will have to be marked as such as well.  In the meantime, enjoy!|`|AA11091315	Maybe the vegetarians and the vegans have the right idea. That's nasty!|`|tyvFUPOxaa	Are you eating cloned cow meat? Wow! Down here in Texas, we prefer to eat naturally grown beef; but with this recession in command of our economy, we're pleased to just have some red beans and fried taters.     If you don't want to risk eating cloned cow meat, try raising your own beef or buying it direct from your local real beef producers.|`|2n4nCec1aa	Not sure about the first part of the question.    For the second part...buy only all natural organic meat.  You can find it in most large grocery stores and definitely at natural food markets.
