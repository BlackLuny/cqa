It comes and goes very often, i get a very intense shooting pain through my chest, either side or both at the same time, as well as my mid-upper back and shoulder blades. It hurts to move, breathe, bend over, anything. I want to schedule an appointment but i want to know what i should get tested for, and not just another go in "idk" leave. Doc said he doesnt think its heart disease as im young and tests are oka, but never got tested for lupus.      19 years old by the way, almost 20. Its been going on for years now off and on, since around the age of 16. One doctor thought its GERD, meds didnt help. Most recent thought swelling of the chest wall, wasnt it either. 3 ekgs negative for heart disease.

Anyway, now my knee hurts like crap and there is a bump on the side of it. I think that it is a soft tissue injury, and my mother says that the bump will gradually go away. Do you think I should get it checked out ASAP or wait a little bit to see if it still hurts in a few days and then get it checked out. Thanks!   Abby

20090307175543AASgNsS	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Heart Diseases	I am having weird heart palpitations, help?	Well let's get a few things out of the way, I've been taking Klonopin 2mg a day for the last couple of years and I am also a smoker. I'm 22 years of age and male. Anyways I suffer from anxiety and depression and yesterday my mother took a plane to visit her parents and ever since then I have been having "heart palpitations". I'm not sure what's causing it, I'm thinking it may be the smoking or the klonopin or maybe some internal anxiety. Anyways it feels like my heart is beating then it gives an extra beat, pauses, and goes again. this has happened before i go to sleep and when i have woken up the last few days. i am also under stress.       I found this wikipedia excerpt which describes what I feel very well      "Those who experience palpitations may have the feeling that their heart stops beating for a moment, and then starts again with a "thump" or a "bang". Usually this feeling is actually caused by an extra beat (premature beat or extrasystole) that happens earlier than the next normal beat, and results in a pause (called a compensatory pause) until the next normal beat comes through. People are not usually aware of the early, extra beat, but may be aware of the pause, which follows it (the heart seems to stop). The beat after the pause is more forceful than normal (due to filling with more blood than usual during the compensatory pause), giving the "thumping" sensation."      anyways please help

20090307175935AAKmBr5	Health;General Health Care;Injuries	Please Help? Advice on car accident injury.?	I had a car accident a few months back and after CT scans, x rays and MRI's I ended up having 2 slipped discs at L4 and L5 which were hitting my sciatic nerve which gave me such great pain starting from my lower back through my left bottom cheek and straight down my leg to my ankle. I have been going chiro sessions and even though the pain is not as bad as what it was, i still after several months get pain in my ankle and lower back. I have seeked legal advice against the driver who hit me from the rear and am dealing with a solicitor who mentioned this type of injury is substantial and considering i am only 25 years old have a whole lifetime of working, I havent had any children yet and that this will bring me trouble in the future. My chiro also said that once discs have slipped you can not fix them. For this type of injury what would be an appropriate payout figure, I have never done this before and obviously do not want to be out of pocket later on down the track for any medical sessions I need. Has anyone had anyone in a similar situation and what was the offer made my insurance. I really am not one of those people that sue for the hell of it and am not abusing the system. I have genuine injuries and why should it come out of my pocket when i was hit by the car?

I am a short/petite girl and I weigh usually 120 lbs, today when I weighed myself last month I was 145! That's 25 ******* pounds!       I weighed myself in again this month and I am 155. WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME? I FEEL LIKE I AM ALWAYS HUNGRY.

20090307181015AAnVP7n	Health;Women's Health	Period Question, preferably someone who knows what they're talking about to answer.?	I am 17, I usually have a VERY scheduled menstrual, 28 days and 6 days of bleeding. Over the past, I'd say 6 months, it's been changing. I started getting cramps to the point of passing out. That didn't worry me because my mom used to have the same problems. Well, it progressively got better, the cramps started to even out and then I noticed my cycle started changing. Again, didn't think much of it.   Now I think I have a problem, they started to get shorter, and now I have them every two weeks and my cycle only lasts three days. Among this are other strange things before the period starts:   Severe Acne   Cramps in my back and lower abdomen   Headaches   Upset Stomach   Weight Gain   Extreme Hunger and Thirst      And my flow is different too, the blood isn't thick and dark red, it's very light red and thin.      Its not an STD because my only partner was tested for all STD's and HPV's and came up negative.      Also, my body has gotten more curvy and my breasts more firm, so I know it's some sort of hormone thing if that helps.       What could be going on?      Thanks for all your help.

And not just a bowl of ice cream, a quart.  Yes, a QUART of ice cream.

My mom has had bipolar since I can remember and the other day my mom had another one of her spells when she comes out and says she's dying. I start to freak out and she says it's cause something in her brain is making her have seizures and heart problems. I know this might sound bad to someone who doesn't have someone they know who has it(you probley shouldn't be answering this question anyway then,) but I'm not sure whether to believe her or not. Life has always been hard living with my mom especially when she tends to over exaggerate things and freaks out, as well as lying. I called my grandparents,cause she said they knew what had been going on  and begged them to tell me if something was up other than her normal bipolar and they said she could go to sleep and never wake up, but they're not experts on it and old and I'm wondering if they heard that from my mom, but other than that,said their wasn't anything wrong(heart and seizure stuff) when I told her what they said she said they weren't telling me the truth. What's going on? I've always had this problem with my mom and not knowing who's telling the truth. ( mostly with my dad who divorced her cause of her freaking out all the time) I don't want to sound cruel but it doesn't sound true. I mean I'm not a expert on bipolar,but can you actually die from it? And she said there's a chance she might live if I help her out by spending more time with her and not being mean and not set off her bipolar?(which I never am,but like I said she flipps out over everything)she says her organs are deteriating cause of her bipolar it doesn't sound like a real disease. is this real? Or am I just in denial? Can someone please help me ? And only someone who has experience (doctor) or knows about this kind of stuff? I'm freaking out here , so only serious answers, please.

20090307180746AAuuKoW	Health;Mental Health	Feel scared all the time, what to do?	Hello,   just wondering if anyone else out there feels like how I do and what I should consider doing about it. I wake up in the morning and feel ok for the first few minutes, but then I get scared of just about everything and think I might just fall over dead. My heart always feels like its pumping real hard and they have said that I have high blood pressure and doc hasn't really found out what could be causing it, he gave me some inderol(sp?) to take daily and it seemed to help a little. I always feel out of it like I am in a dream, and that makes everything a whole lot worse. I always have chest pain below my underarm on the rib area, it seems to come and go as I get more anxious.I focus too much energy about worrying what may be wrong with me and it has been taking over my life for the past 4 years.   Heres a more basic list of symptoms and what a feel,   anxiety   panic   scared of dying   pain in the side of my chest   headaches   feel like im on edge   depressed   out of it   fatigued   snore a ton (possibly sleep apnea just went for test)   high blood pressure   fast heart beat   a hard pulse(possibly just cause of high blood pres.) but I feel like I can feel my pulse in my finger tips or most places I touch.      Thats just what I can think of off the top of my head. I was on lexapro for a while and that kind of helped me, but doc wheened me off cause Im only 25 and didnt want me stuck on it for life, when the symptoms came back I took it again but it didnt seem to work it just gave me all kinds of weird numbness and made me alot worse I think, so we tried zoloft and quickly came off of that because it made me feel extremely out of it and very confused. Now I just seem to be dealing with this day by day and don't know what to do about it, I just want to feel normal again..........

20090307180946AAzf7a4	Health;General Health Care;Pain & Pain Management	Is it possible to ignore the pain of testicular torsion?	Last month I woke up with a very unusual and surprising pain in my lower abdomen, on the left. My testicles were swollen and red, and I had trouble getting an erection. I assumed that it was something to do with me and my partner having a little rougher than normal sex recently, so I just took some pain killers and decided to see how if things got better on their own. It was very painful to get aroused for a long time. After about two weeks the pain had generally subsided, and everything was around normal. The only weird thing is that now it seems like either my right testicle is smaller than the left or the left hangs lower. The typical mass around the left testicle is significantly bigger that it used to be. Things still feel very tense down there, it is like I can't relax back to "normal." I don't know what is wrong, I have went to the doctor and they gave me epididymitis medication. Everything is still the same except my testicle pain. It just seems like things are close to numb in my testicles. I can still feel the testicle when I squeeze it or poke it. I have yet to see a specialist. What I am wondering is, could I have somehow ignored the pain from the torsion without realizing it?

I am starting to have problems dealing with getting older, especially my mother. It is bad enough that I am scared of dying myself, but now I have to worry about my mom My mother is 47 and isn't getting any younger. She is healthy,though. My father took off before I was born and so my mom is my only parent. We are very close and the thought of losing her is more than I could take. I know the time comes when everyone loses their parents, but I am scared. When I think about it my throat closes up and I start to cry. Sometimes I call her up just to make sure she is still alive and just to hear her voice. I get scared she will be a car accident or fall or die in her sleep. Most people my age have parents in their 60's and 70's and my mom is much younger, so that is a little comfort, but not much. I wish I can turn back the hands of time, but it is impossible. Only just yesterday, I was starting kindergarten, now I will be 30. I do have anxiety and depression issues, but no amount of medicine can stop the obsessive thoughts of dying. Is this normal being afraid of losing a parent?.How can I cope with this?

20090227094929AAxhPqW	Health;Diet & Fitness	Those with high heart rate can it be lowered through exercise or are you doomed for life?	I've been reading information about high heart rates. I just read that high heart rates is a precursor to diabetes which means there is a problem with the sympathetic nervous system. The study was done in Japan so weight had nothing to do with it but they said that high heart rates can increase your chances of obesity. I also read that those whose resting heart rates were above 70 bpm were at an increase risk of suffering a heart attack, but then it might not always be the case since children and small adults normally have high heart rates typically above 100.       Since I can remember I've always had a higher than normal heart rate. No doctor seem concerned about it until I went for a TB test for my current employer, at Kaiser even if you go for something as simple as a TB test they check your blood pressure and heart rate and both were high but the nurses were concerned about the heart rate. I think I was nervous, I don't really like hospitals or doctors. It seems like no matter how hard I workout I can't seem to get my heart rate down. It almost sounds like it's genetic and there is nothing I can do to get it down. Even medications don't work, I took them for 4 years and they make me really sick and I heard they increase your chances of developing diabetes. I know endurance runners and cyclists tend to have lower heart rates so I thought about doing marathons to see if that would help lower my heart rate. It would be nice to see it go down to 60 bpm.      Can heart rate be lowered through exercise or are you doomed for life to suffer from heart disease and diabetes?

20090307184522AApbyRP	Health;Diet & Fitness	Is this a good exercise routine or should i increase what im doing?	Ok so currently I am about 152lbs 5'7 male and trying to drop to about 135. I started dieting/working out back in august when I made the decision to cut soda out of my life for good and immediately dropped 10lbs(Started at 183lbs) just from that and nothing else. So now Im about 173 and started running at night and got to about 165-160 and kept that up. Took a break and just started running/bicycling about 2 months ago and have attained my current weight of 152. When I bike which is probably 1-2x a week I go for 30 miles with high resistance, when I run which is 3 times a week I go on this trail which takes 1.5 miles to walk/run to and 6 miles to the end and back bringing me to about 9 miles of running and walking as I can not run the entire 9 miles yet lol. I can usually do about 3-4miles without stopping. So anyways back to my question, does this exercise routine seem like it will help me get to my goal of 135 in the coming months(I would like it before summer). If not do you have any other suggestions to help burn the rest of my fat off? I realize losing the last bit of weight is the hardest part and will do anything to finish what I started...

But a few nights ago, right when i got into bed, i could not close my eyes. my legs and some of my upper body started shaking    uncontrollably.   I felt very closed in, but my room is big. I am not claustrophobic.   I started getting tears in my eyes, and cried for no reason, unable to stop.   I was hyperventilating (felt hard to breathe).   all of a sudden, my mothers room felt miles away. i wanted to see someone, anyone, but then again i had no intention of walking into her room, if i could manage to walk at all.   I felt hopeless, sad, ect.   But for the past year and a half, i have felt hopelessly sad. such as thoughts of death (suicide), secluding myself from others, loss of appetite, and weight loss. nothing can make me laugh anymore. i have cried uncontrollably for no reason.   even my friends have called me and said that they have noticed my personality change (slow, depressed).   I have imagined of which pills i could take to commit suicide and overdose. i also thought about drugs, but never tried them.   After the sadness began, i developed short periods of eating disorders, feeling like it didn't matter what happened if i died from it, and i have nothing to lose.   Is this anxiety or depression? should i tell my mom, or should i be taking anitdepressants (Prozac)?

20090227093152AAt5mHr	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	Scarred by Alcoholism?	Hey there the names Michele. I'm 18, and my son is almost 9 months. I live with my dad who is a very bad alcoholic. He drinks beer from morning to night and becomes verbally abusive and sometimes physically. He doesn't care about anyone else but himself and that is very hard for me since I need help with my son. He's kicked me out when i was pregnant too many times I can't even count, and even after I gave birth to my son. I bounced back from town to town, living with my sister and my dad. I have taken the next step on being a good mother and protecting myself and my son from this monster, and filled out an application for housing. They said they were gonna send me a letter letting me know when there is an appartment open, but that was a few weeks ago, and i need to call them. My only option is to move out, my sister who has raised me my whole life lives in a different town about 45 minutes away, and my mom and I don't have the best mother daughter relationship. I don't think I can take this anymore, I'm very depressed and that affects how I parent my son. My son's father wants nothing to do with us so that makes me more angry.   I've researched online about support groups for teenagers who have alcoholic parents, and the nearest to me is about 6 hours away. My dad has been to rehab 3 times, detox once, and he's also been in the [nut house] and had to take anger managment. I've had a very bad childhood he's drank my whole life and I rarely see him sober.   Does anyone have any advice for me?   Please help!   Thanks!

20090227094011AAIrKVE	Health;Mental Health	How can I be myself, instead of a puppet trying to be normal?	How can I be myself, instead of something i'm not?   I have been what other people want me to be for so long that I think it's one reason why I had to deal with depression in my life. And also because of this I'm scared to attempt anything for fear of exposing myself to others. I always change my outward personality to suit the person/people i'm with; so that no one knows who I really am. I say so many things to suit the people I'm with, to please them and always doing what they want to do, afraid of rejection, so much so that I've developed fake phobias, likes and dislikes....just because it is easier than showing people what I'm really like. Now because i've been doing this for so long, i think i've lost myself. And lately I've just been getting so tired of having to live a double life. What can i do. this is holding me back from succeeding because i'm always watching myself around people. And one reason why I hide my true self is because i'm tooo weird, eccentric and "deep" for most people. and the time I accidentally let something of myself slip, the whole room got SSSOOO quiet; " this is not the funny, easy-going, relaxed happy-go-lucky girl we know" kinda quiet. I want to be me, but I think it might be too much for people, and for once I could give rat's @$$.

Also about the internal organs, shortly after she mentioned it I began having kidney and bladder problems (not serious, but a bit of mild damage). Could that be the result of the pox?

Anyways, the treatment is extremelly painful, and there is no laughing gas or something that knocks you out, nothing. Well I've been doing this for some time, and yesterday I was sensitive and it hurt so much, that i started crying, like tears would run down my face from the pain. It was the most i've ever experienced. So by the end, i was fine cause the pain went away.      Now, yesterday night and today, whenver I think of something sad, i start crying. I don't know why, anything sad, i get a lump in my throat and tears come ot my eyes. Example. I was watching this movie with Grace Kelly, and then i was thinking about it, and I know she died when she was only 50, and she had a too short movie career, and I started crying. And then later, i was thinking about how some other guy who i never knew in life died, again same thing. I don't know why, i mean they're people i see on the screen, but yet i still feel sad and crying?      And if thats not weird, Im a guy, I hardly ever cry, like if i do it'll be extreme situations. And here I am almost crying everytime i think of something sad. Why?

It started on Friday around 11:50 am after talking at people with no common sense..then my head kept hurting. I was just recovering from being sick...I thought it would go away so I went home then spent the night at my friends 'cause we had plans the next day. But it still continued. I tried sleeping that night. I had a hard time because my head is just HURTING. I tried listening to calming music. Not working. I wake up and it is still there. So all today it kept hurting then somehow it started getting to my teeth. No, it's not anything to do with my teeth. It's not a fever, too painful to be a headache, but not painful enough to be a migraine. Anybody have any idea what it is and how to stop it? I WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE IT! :] Thanks!

Ok, so last Friday( not yesterday) i went to my orthopedic doctor because i had fallen really hard on my knee a couple days before The pain was dull by then so he concluded it was sprained and didn't take x-rays. He said to apply heat after 48 hours and to wrap it. I did what he said and it was just dull pain. He also said if it kept hurting or got worse to come back for x-rays cause it may be more than sprained. On Friday (yesterday) i had to run for 20 minutes and i had to do it not wrapped because i couldn't run with it wrapped with an ace bandage and my other ace sleeve thing kept falling down. After about 6 minutes the inner side of my knee started hurting really bad. I had to keep running the whole time or i would get an F for the day. I was able to make it through the day though. Today i was walking around a lot and when i finally got home my knee was hurting a lot more. I took ibuprofen and iced it and then slept off and on for like 2.5 hours. When i woke up it was hurting super bad. It hurts without putting any weight on it and epically hurts if i push just a little on the inner side. My parents think its not bad because i don't want to ice it because it doesn't seem to help. What should i do? Should i keep on icing it or should i wrap it up again? Right now i don't have anything on it. I don't think i can get into my orthopedic again until Monday, probably not till much later in the week. Should i go to a urgent care that around my area? How do i get my parents to take me? Please Help!!!

So I got all new soap, but now almost everything that used to smell good, smells TERRIBLE.  All of my shampoos, face wash, deodorant... and mint is the WORST.  I have no sense of smell for mint whatsoever.  It's just this terrible sour bitter smell... brushing my teeth is now really unpleasant.  I noticed it's getting worse, not better at all.  Around the beginning of January I got over a mild case of the flu.  I'm not sure if that would relate at all.  Another thing that might relate is that I slept wearing this strong perfume, and symtoms kind of started right after that.

So I just got back from the hospital after having some chest pains, and they told me it was probably nothing and that without chronic pain or definite signs of a life threatening disorder, they would not be able to do much.   I'm 23, male, smoking eight years, drink 3-4 cans of pop daily (for approx 10 years) no history or heart problems including family history, very tall (6'5") and underweight (143lbs)    Basically it starts as a sharp pain on the left breast, followed by similar pains throughout my entire body. Mostly left leg, left arm, both wrists, but not limited to. Having frequent headaches lasting seconds to ten minutes. Numbness in my left hand, sometimes left leg. Pain increases (or begins if not already present) when I have a cigarette, pop, lay on my sides, and if I lay on my back it hurts my chest AND back significantly more than if I was on my sides. No palpitations, but heavy pounding, not significantly more rapid heartbeat than usual. Straightening my posture seems to alleviate the pain most of the time.....   Think that's it.       Anyone with something similar????

I went to the doctor on Thursday and he prescribed Maxalt... I took 3 that day, and the pharmacist said I can only take that much in one week.  I got a massage this morning, thinking the tension in my neck could be contributing, but it's still here. I've never had one last this long. The doctor mentioned getting a shot or something if I had another bad one... has anyone had a shot for a migraine? The doctor also told me that Excedrin (which is what I used to take) can actually make it worse...        I would love advice from a nurse, or someone with experience with a long term migraine... I'm thinking of going to urgent care, but I don't want to waste my time either. I can't do anything like this though... ugh!

20090307192417AARQ5Vz	Health;Mental Health	My brother is acting really weird. Help, anyone?	I'm worried about my brother's mental well-being.      Ever since we moved to this new house, my brother has been acting weird. He acts all nice around everyone else but when he's alone in his room, I can hear him talking to himself. He talks about killing our family because everyone has sinned.I dismissed it because I used to talk to myself about weird things when I was a kid. That's not the weirdest part of it though.      One day, while I was just roaming around Yahoo answers and came across a stupid question, I laughed really hard. Suddenly, the door crashed open and there my brother was, standing with a knife. He said in a really creepy voice "Do you like making fun of other people?". He lunged at me with the knife, but I got out of the way just in time. My mom was outside, hearing the racket. She rushed up to the room, just when he was about to stab me one more time. He stabbed me in the arm, and she saw it. She got scared scared, and said, "You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air." I whistled for a cab and when it came near The license plate said 'FRESH' and it had dice in the mirror. If anything I could say that this cab was rare, but I thought, "Nah, forget it. Yo, holmes to Bel-Air!" I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8 and I yelled to the cabbie, "Yo holmes smell ya later!" Looked at my kingdom I was finally there, to sit on my throne as the prince of Bel-Air.
20090307192030AAr1DA6	Health;Women's Health	What are my options if I am pregnant?	Today I was having sex with my boyfriend and the condom broke. I generally take birth control. But I've been on antibiotics for a really bad sinus infection for almost 3 weeks now, so I didn't take it this month because it's not effective when you're on antibiotics. Anyway, since the condom broke I ran out to the pharmacy (literally right away) and got the morning after pill and took it within 1 hour (and a half, TOPS) of when he 'finished'.       I am really nervous, because I am generally a very responsible person, I don't drink, smoke, and do drugs, and school is very important to me. So if I am pregnant, other than having the baby I am not sure what my options are. I work on my school's campus but I can't work more than like 10-15 hours a week there. And so I don't know what to do. I can't really afford very much. Please let me know what my options are if the plan B pill doesn't work.      Important Info: Last menstrual cycle began approximately Feb. 23/24th and ended the 28th.       Generally have 28 day cycles

20090307194519AABcJ2b	Health;Men's Health	I was once a man with a six pack... Now it's one ugly belly. How do I lose it?	At one point I was leading a very active life style. Active in sports, training with the Canadian Forces, and walked everywhere. Today, I drive everywhere, sit in class all day, and eat a lot.    About 6 months ago I was 165 pounds with a pretty muscular tummy. Today, I'm weighing in at 180, and I've never had a belly so big. Love handles aren't looking too good either. It's not so bad that I can't suck it all in and still show off some muscle, but it seems I'm sucking in a lot now, as it's starting to appear very, VERY, clearly when I wear medium t-shirts. It's just killing my self esteem is all.   From what I've heard is that it is cardio exercising and eating right that'll do me well.   I am more than willing to exercise again, but I won't be changing my eating habits. I eat the same way I did when I was more active, and stayed looking good. It's only the issue of me not being active at all any more that has me looking cuddly.   If anybody could give me some good exercises, maybe a small plan, that'd be great! :-D      I'm male, 18 years old, and completely able-bodied. And the only build up of fat has been in the stomache region.

I stopped talking my meds because they weren't helpling at all. I did it without the doctors permission. I haven't taken them since friday. Now when I eat I eat as much as I can. I don't over do it. Not because I want to stay skinny, Or im worried I will get fat. I just eat very little. I have noticed I have been throwing up a lot. Im not pregnant. I threw up Thursday night and I threw up friday moring. I have been throwing up even though I was on my pills. I eat like a cup of ramon noodles sometimes or what ever is in my room. I live in a dorm right now so that's why I said my room. Like I said I eat very little and lately I have been wanting to through up. sometimes I do sometimes I don't. Most of the time when I through up it's very little and then the rest is acid. I had told one of the staff members not to long ago about something that happened to me just last week. Ever since I told him that my right eye was twicthing for two days. I don't know whats wrong with me.

I was hospitalized because my lymph nodes got so big it stopped my breathing. Then about 2 months later i go back to school for 1 day and i caught phenomena. So know i have been throwing up for 2 weeks. Nothing has worked for nausea. I have been to hospital 6 times to get me rehydrated and i got a cat scan and all my lymph nodes in my lower belly were swollen. I have been getting way weaker than i was. My balance is way off, vision is a lot worse, had a migraine for a month. It burns really bad when i pee and i have been tested for UTI, STD, and kidney stones all came back negative so that just baffled them. I have been getting real bad pains right above my groin to were i cant even bend there cause it hurts so bad. My one doctor says it is all mono that is it. My bowel habits have changed as well. I decided to get a second opinion at a gasterologist and they are doing a colonoscopy, and the mouth one with a biopsy i don't really know what for though. My nausea has been so bad they made me go to a compound pharmacy to get this cream i put on my arm and it really don't work. I have been very miserable.      So does mono get worse and are all these symptoms of mono?      Im sick of being really sick. Also i been sweating like a pig even when it is very cold

20090307200151AAHArXC	Health;Mental Health	How can I have more confidence in myself?	I hate myself, especially my body. I think I'm fat. People tell me I'm skinny, but I don't believe it, especially when I see other girls who are skinnier than me and are taller (although I also see girls who are skinnier than me and shorter, but it still doesn't help). I'm pretty sure ugly, especially considering I've been called ugly my whole life by the kids in my schools, since kindergarten (I've gone to three different schools in three different cities) and even my family is pleased with my appearance (especially my short hair and my taste in clothes and they're always trying to force me to get my hair done, use a certain hair product and pick out different clothes). I also wear glasses and have acne (not severe, thankfully), which I think really make it worse.      Every time I look at myself in the mirror, I think something like "I'm getting fat" or "my hair looks horrible" or "my face looks like a monster's face" or "my teeth are awful." I hate looking at myself in the mirrors and I hate taking pictures. As I get older, I just look worse and worse and feel worse too. There's nothing I can do. I'm not good at any sport or art or even school (I have As and Bs in all my classes, but I'm in resource, so it's simple). And everyone thinks I'm strange because I have a habit of talking to myself (which comes from physical and emotional abuse I went through when I was younger) and because I have a love of fairytales (because they usually describe a character with a supportive family and who is treated with respect, which is what I wish I had). Even when I try to tell myself things like "I look fine" or "nothing is wrong with me," it never works. Any advice? I would greatly appreciate it.      I'm 14, by the way.

Usually I eat quite abit of junk & drink alot of fizzy stuff, But i've found that drinking hot chocolate usually stops my need for munching out on crisps, chocolate bars and eating bigger meals and stuff.      Does it sound like a better idea now to eat a healthy breakfast and drink some water, then have a hot chocolate at lunch, again between lunch and dinner, then have a healthy dinner?

I am seriously phobic about having blood drawn or getting a shot and I get all dizzy and panic-y every time I have to.

I would like to be able to donate because it's such a great thing to do but I can't even imagine it right now.       It's not the pain, it's just the idea of having a needle in my vein that freaks me out. I'm wondering if anyone else has had this issue and what you did to overcome it. Maybe hypnosis would help? I don't know, but it's getting embarrassing.

If I start this diet March 9, 2009 and end it on June 9, 2009 (a span of three months) will I/can I lose 22 pounds (10kg)? How much weight do you guess I will lose if I didn't do the exercise listed?      - walking 6 miles on saturday and sunday   - 1,000 skips on and unweighted jump rope each night   - 100 crunches each night   - eating 1000 to 1200 calories of fruits, veggies, and lean meats (mainly tuna)   - very, verrrrry basic yoga & basic stretches everyday   - no junk food, no soda, nothing processed   - only drink water and green tea (w/o any sugar, just plain ole' green tea)      I made this diet so I would eat well, do exercises that I won't hate and not get bored and quit.      Info/stats:   Age: 15   Weight: 122 pounds   Height: 5'3"   BMI: 21.6   BMR: 1400-ish      I know I'm normal weight. I know if I lose 22 pounds I'll be 100 pounds (which isn't really my goal, my goal is 105 to 107 (107 is still normal weight for 5"3'), but it's not that big of a differance). I'm aware of what I am doing and will stop if this diet makes me sick in anyway.       Thank you to everyone who give a useful answer. : )

20090307211159AAmyd41	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Heart Diseases	I feel like i'm losing it..( I know it's long, but plz read )?	My grandmother was in a pretty major car accident on Monday. She totaled my uncle's car. She refused to go to the hospital, because she didn't want them to keep her in there. They finally got her to go to the doctor & they said she just had a concussion & should take a few days off work. Mind you, my grandmother is 68 years old & works as a waitress. Her heart has been in A FIB a few times & she really shouldn't be working. Anyway, I got a text from my cousin at 7 this morning, telling me that my grandma was being taken by ambulance to the hospital. I rushed up there to find out that she has congestive heart failure. They had to intubate her & sedate her. They put her on lasicks {sp?] to try & get some of the fluid from around her lungs.       I know this probably sounds stupid, but how serious is this? I'm 21 years old, but my family is really treating me like I'm 10 with this situation. I know they're probably sheltering me as much as possible because I lost my great grandmother oct. 1st of 07 & lost my father on sept. 25 of 08... but i would really like to know what's going on... what exactly is congestive heart failure & A FIB? What can they do to make it better?

20090307194958AAkCdaD	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	Is it worth asking my doctor about my canker sores?	I am a 19 year old female in college.  I had herpes encephalitis when i was 6 months old.  As a result, i have seizures laying dormant in my body.  I have had 2, each about 8 years apart.  I am taking Keppra 500mg twice daily for seizures, because one of the 2 seizures i had just occurred last year.  Also, i get very many canker sores.  I usually get 2 a week and they last a week.  2 years ago my cheek swelled up, making it hard to talk.  It was at night, so i went to an urgent care place.  They said i had 15 canker sores in my mouth and the swelling was caused by a form of the herpes virus i had as a baby.  They gave me Lidocaine Hydrochloride Oral Topical 2% Solution.  I apply it whenever i have a breakout.  The canker sores would heal faster.  The medicine is now outdated, and as a result the medicine doesn't work well and more breakouts are occurring.  I avoid all spicy foods and don't eat tomatoes and pinapple, because i know those food make me break out faster.  Is it worth asking my doctor about my canker sores.

If I had to get braces again..can I get them only on the bottom teeth to correct the problem?  Anybody had a similar experience.       Thanks.

20090307203009AAoakRd	Health;Women's Health	Why all the discharge?	I'm 15 and I have constant clear discharge. I know it is normal to have, but what happens to me is ridiculous. It flows heavier than my period and it continues without stopping for weeks at a time. Also, my period has become longer. It's like 9 days. I've been menstruating since I was 11. It's too the point where I'm wearing pads all the time. If I'm not on my period, I'm discharging this stuff.      I guess my question would be: does this mean I'm more fertile? My mom said that it is just because my hormones are flowing so fast. I mean, is it supposed to flow so heavily? Is my period supposed to be so long? I'm thinking I should see a doctor.       Input would be nice.

That's why i am really concerned but i want to be sure before i confront her about it. I have started to wonder over the last week.   Would she be losing weight?? Do you think she is bulimic??

Now these couple of last years I’ve been having high anxiety problems that cause my mind to continue to race during the night that don’t allow me to fall asleep right away and also causes me to wake up sever times a night.   I was thinking on doing a couple of experiments, first is when I find myself awake in the middle of the night cause I cant sleep, I will try going for  jog then a hot bath and then pray to fall into a deep sleep.  The other is just to stay awake until I feel so drowsy that I don’t have any other option but to fall into a deep sleep.   Please provide any feed back that you might think could help.

I just turned 18 and around two months ago I started to have excessive hair loss, literally clumps of hair. at first i did not notice my hair thinning but now it is becoming much more apparent. I have curly hair and it is around 3.5 inches long.      What i have noticed lately is that I have had an itchy scalp and along with light dandruff. I am an extremely healthy person, I shower ever morning, go to the gym 6 times a week, have a multi vitamin every day, and have a healthy diet that contains a lot of protein. I do not have any stress.       in the last two days it has become apparent that I am getting a bald spot near the back of my hair but when I do look at my hair loss it is occurring all around my scalp. Knowing that this gene is carried on the female side, my cousins who are older have not shown any real sign of hair loss until their mid to late 20s, My grandfather lived with a full head of hair.       if there is anything I can do or anyone might know a solution to this issue any help would be much appreciated.

Also do you know anything that would help?   it is really hurting.   thank you.
