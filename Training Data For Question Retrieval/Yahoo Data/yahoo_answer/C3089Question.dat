I haven`t really been impressed by choice, but I bought one T-shirt and one cotton jacket... In few days after, for some reason I decided to return on of the item. I came to the store with original receipt ,but when they scan it, something different came up, item did not match with purchase on the receipt.  and I was blamed for try to return something what I never bought... They confiscate item and did not refund it,.!! Well, I wont tell what I went through, but I feel humiliated and embarrassed at this point, and its not about the money anymore...   If anyone had been in similar situation I appreciate for sharing your experience and any advise how this problem can be resolved.Thanks.

I had a package from Hong Kong that was going to be delivered today, I wasn't home  and didn't get back till 5:30pm.  I checked online and it said they tried to deliver it at 5:00pm and a notice was left, there was no notice left anywhere, I was thinking they didn't come by to deliver it yet because I didn't see a notice.      Can I still pick up the package without the notice? Last time they left a notice, it had to be signed and then taken to the post office to pick it up but now they didn't leave one, was wondering if I would have any problems picking it up.
