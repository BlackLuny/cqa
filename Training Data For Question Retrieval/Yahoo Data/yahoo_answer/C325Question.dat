"Now, listen carefully: Who killed Abraham Lincoln?"       The blonde looked a little surprised herself, then thought really hard for a minute and finally admitted, "I don't know."       "Well, why don't you go home and work on that one for a while?"       So, the blonde wandered over to the beauty parlor, where her pals were waiting to hear the results of the interview.

Finding he had no matches,    he asked Ole for a light.       'Ya, shure, I tink I haff a lighter,'    he replied, and then, reaching into his tackle box, he pulled out a Bic lighter 10 inches long       'Yiminy Cricket!' exclaimed Sven, taking the huge Bic lighter in his hands. 'Vere dit yew git dat monster??'       'Vell,' replied Ole,    'I got it from my Genie.'       'You haff a Genie?' Sven asked.       'Ya, shure. It's right here in my    tackle box,' says Ole.       'Could I see him?'       Ole opens his tackle box and sure enough, out pops the Genie.          Addressing the genie, Sven says, 'Hey dere! I'm a good friend of your master. Vill you grant me vun vish?'       'Yes, I will,' says the Genie.       So Sven asks the Genie for    a million bucks.       The Genie disappears back into the tackle box leaving Sven sitting there waiting for his million bucks.       Shortly, the sky darkens and is filled with the sound of a million ducks... flying directly overhead.          Over the roar of the million ducks,    Sven yells at Ole, 'Yumpin' Yimminy,    I asked for a million bucks, not a million ducks!'       Ole answers, 'Ya, I forgot to tell yew dat da Genie is hart of hearing. Do yew really tink I asked for a 10-inch Bic?"

I know this cancer guy from almost 4 years. we were in same class while in school. we were good friends. All of a sudden i started developing feelings for him, and i 'm sure he also feels for me. he has been very caring for me, he never forgot wishing my birthdays etc. although i always forgot his:). a few months back he said he wanted to say something to me but then suddenly he changed the topic and said that he 'll say it someother time. then he joked saying i 'll see him in my dreams, i replied in same tone saying how come i 'll not and this is a truth. he become so concerned and said if i can swear that this is not the truth. i said i can swear and he was like OK i 'm sure about this and 'll keep my words for sombody else. I said OK fine. from that day he seemed a bit distant, and then i just told him that my parents are evaluating a few proposals for me and I may marry in next 5-6 months. i was just trying to tease him a bit and was trying to make him commit. But he suddenly changed and become aloof. if I call him or text him he doesnot respond enthusiastically as was before and he stopped initiating contact with me although in past it was only him who initiated contact first. i am just wondering what's wrong what happened. I am sure he feels the same as I am. but why he become distant suddenly. any idea? How can i make him commit in this relationship.   I am Cancer girl

20090309183753AAW89Wx	Entertainment & Music;Movies	What do you guys think about Twilight>? Also do you think they should make twilight2? What about the actors?	Ok, so I guess twilight was ok. But they could have picked a WAY better bella and edward. I mean robert pattinson is really not  edward at all. And he said in an interview that he hasn't washed his hair in 6 weeks! I know what your thinking, it wasn't for the movie! It was just in general! I mean ew! And kristen is just a bad actress. I mean we all have different images when we were reading the book but they didn't match any of it! And they are really bad role models. Kristen smoked pot and robert smokes and drinks. I know what your thinking again, I know they are people who have real lives and they can ruin it, ect. But they do it in public and don't care when people stare and take pictures. There are young kids who look up to them and they just completley ruin there minds with drugs and acholol. I can see it now, a young edward or bella fan saying to thier mom, mommy bella does drugs so can i? It makes me sick! The effects in the movie were really corny too. I hope they make a way better new moon! I mean there are lots of people who will probably make remarks on how they love twilight and they wil never stop reading it, but COME ON!!! That's what everyone said about harry potter too! And he is already forgotten. STATE YOUR OPINION HERE! 10 POINTS EASY!

He said he'd give me extra points for accepting his offer, and showing that I'd go through any lengths to improve my grade.

20090309191755AATCrYj	Entertainment & Music;Celebrities	Tokio Hotels Bill Kaulitz New Hair?	Aright, I am a guy...a straight guy...and I have liked Tokio Hotel since I saw them at the VMA's.  At first I thought there were freaks, I mean the lead singer looked like a girl, and TOm looked like a wannabe rapper...but then I heard them speak and they both seemed like genuine nice guys.  So I bought their album and loved it...      That leads me to my question.  Another reason I am so intrigued by them is that they have alot of guy fans although Bill comes off as feminine and a little gay.  But it never bothered me.  And i personally thought the hair made him and his image.        What does everyone think of this new hair style.  i think it now makes him look like a little boy who is wearing too much makeup.  Before he came off as a chick but eveyone accepted him for it, but the dreads with the white hair just don't suit him.  What do  you think??       http://www.tokiohotelrocks.com/

She's this girl living in a cottage with seven dwarves but they're girls. They're more like trolls that control certain elemants like thunder, wind, or earth. I don't remember why, but the girl has to go on a quest and this creepy little dude is following her. Turns out its the Prince but he's been turned into this weird old man thing by the evil queen.   Its really trippy and it brings back childhood memories but I can't remember the name!

Rate comment, and do you think it should be one whole story or separate verses.      I heard he was the talk of the town, so I came around   to listen to his lyrics, and envision his sound   Vocals were astonishing, a breath of fresh oxygen   watching him in the hood the crowds stood acknowledging   In amazement, he was the poet of the pavement   With a brave wit, if Hip-Hop is dead, he can save it   Voice is music when it's heard, the prophet of the streets    Absurd treats of word, like Easter sweets, lofted over beats    A resurrection, through every section it was heaven sent   In the next election, I nominate him for the president   Like Eric B, and to see him was like to view Rakim   They said he's next coming, that's what I feel I heard them humming   And dude was pretty real; I think they're for real on to something   Talking about he was great, had more than few blocks rocking   Even with a bad state, you'd never catch rate of his stock dropping   Plus he stayed true to himself, drew attention with massive skill   and, his soul he would never sell to get mass appeal......      Studio time was driving things closer to a record deal   Every time he blessed the mic, he gave the right type of feel   A rappers delight, took flight to a newer height   A truer light and only a few could view the future sight   Or had an idea about what was destine to be    He tested at a degree that had yet to be let free   Still a teen but his style was rather clean   And behind the scene, he was just a guy with a dream   But without a team, he chose to go alone for real   Got a call on his phone it was known he has shown his skill   A big company they said they liked his vibe as whole    Gave him a paper with a line for him to sign his soul   The fine print was not shown, he had yet to dance wit the devil   To him the industry wasn't know, far advanced pass his level   His crystal ball now got rearranged his destiny in all changed   But in his mind at the time he didn't now what he was   About to sign with that dotted line   He got out his pen would he seal the massive deal   Would he really sell his soul to get mass appeal?....      He got his lime light and the fame his name came quick   He was still a hit, still legit all in all it was the same shyt   Did a couple shows, ready to drop his first LP   Steady with the flows and his stock was wealthy   He had his spot locked, and the people was still looking   Till the industry started talking and it wasn't what he had cooking   They said the people don't want to hear intellect prevail   This isn't '94 lyrics with knowledge doesn't sell   Half of the viewers aren't in college, the rest could care less, what your saying   **** facts they just want hot club track and beats playing   He started to argue, this is my music   I choose it, I'll never lose it, I own my sound, so don't abuse it   Try and use it, to make money and profit   This **** ain't even funny so stop it   I'm not hear to be played and slayed, to get you paid or changed   Music is to be made, I will not be enslaved and chained   They then turned to each other and said do you want your massive deal   Showed him the contract as a whole and his soul he passed for real   The man said we now own your goals, to us your *** is sealed   I guess he would sell his soul to get mass appeal…………..

20090309204030AAUweWz	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	My questions (1) Should I rearrange by bedroom closet again or (2) Am I being too compulsive?	My questions (1) Should I rearrange by bedroom closet again or (2) Am I being too compulsive?       The spring/summer clothes that I hang up are staying in the den closet and my winter clothes that I hang up are staying in my bedroom closet.  The bags (that are full of clothes) that are on the floor in my bedroom closet are making the hanging clothes in my bedroom closet tight but I am still able to get to things.  I don't ever have to change closets for each season but  now that everything is arranged I feel compelled to rearrange my bedroom closet so the bags don't interfere with the hanging clothes.      Last night I took everything out of my bedroom closet and rearranged them.  Then I put all the clothes back in my bedroom closet.   You see at first I was rearranging my bedroom closet to make it easier for me to switch the out of season clothes with the in season clothes in another couple of weeks.  But then I started to think why do I have to change the closets every season.  It does not make sense.  All I have to do is go into the den closet if I need something and if it is wrinkled iron it.  Now the spring/summer stuff is in the den closet which is going to stay in the den closet forever unless of course I move out.  I told my mom that I decided to not ever switch closets again and I told her why and at first I thought she was going to fight me but instead she said "I don't care do what you want".  You see every time I had to change closets I dreaded that day and then today I started to think why do I have to change closets every season, I hated doing it.  All I have to do is go in the next room (the den) and get the summer stuff and the winter stuff in my bedroom closet. I have tons of clothes (both summer and winter) in my linen closet and dresser draws.  All that I will really need in the den closet are my summer pants.

And Waits....   And Waits.... Until you're ready,    Then closes in and devours you...   From the Inside out.   ALL you see is shadows of the ones you once knew,   No more happiness,   No more laughter,   No more love,   Its like a thunderstorm that blocks your soul.   Your soul becomes a black hole,   Whatever said, heard, or learned,   Is forgotten, never brought up again,   No longer does anything matter,   Its all darkness,   Like a plague that never goes away.      ?

20090309204241AArM2Da	Entertainment & Music;Comics & Animation	Watchmen review....did anybody else feel the need to walkout?	I bought into the hype for a solid year and was sooo excited about its release.  I guess the main thing that was awful for me is the fact that I sat through 2 hours of the movie and there was no attempt at a plot.  Over and over they tried to setup the characters but really never did.  The Comedian was way over done to not even be a major factor.  Mr. Blue Penis and Night Owl were just plan boring. Rorschach was really the only bright spot of the characters.  Ozymandias should of had a huge role in the movie but was rarely mentioned. The only plot that I noticed was that humans really suck.  The graphics were great and the opening fight scene was the best part of the movie.  Heard the prison break scene was awesome but I couldn't handle all the soft porn so I had to leave.  Guess if you're weird enough to enjoy watching 20 blue penises then I can understand why you would enjoy this film.  The soundtrack was great but it really overtook the movie from the beginning.  Almost seemed like they were trying to do it as a musical.  There were good parts to the movie but heavily outweighed by the blunders.  I had really hoped that the previews didn't do the movie justice but unfortunately I think I would have rather set through 3 hours of the awesome preview with the cool Billy Corgan song.

Ill try to make this as brief as possible. i have a business plan that i have to do starting with creating a new product. My product is a program that contains Information such as business theories, concepts and so on and behaviours of different customers. the way this works is you use the program for a specific product that you want to create. You added into the computer and it gives you different concepts in which you can start to develop it and also gives you an of what your target market can be by giving you possible reactions form the different behaviours that are in the program. It has other factors such as there are three levels to the program one being you pick a product from a verity that's given to you and u match the concept you use and the customers that you target and it gives you an overview of how successful it will be. second level is a bit more complicated and involves creating your own product while third level it goes as high as creating a whole company with how many employees you will need and also financial factors and so on.      Could you please tell me what are your thoughts about this particular invention. this is only an overview and im sorry its so long but your help will be much appreciated       Thank you for your time

She told him:   I'm done with this    I'm through forever   I'm not going back   I quit this task   Oh and if anybody asks about this instant found bliss   Just tell them I'm done with this       And now he's put the bottle away for years, no more crying no more tears   Her arms aren't black and blue anymore ever since she walked out of the door   And they said:   I'm done with this    I'm through forever   I'm not going back   I quit this task   Oh and if they ask about this instant found bliss   Just tell them I'm done with this      Ohh,   I'm done with this    I'm through forever   I'm not going back   I quit this task   Oh and if they ask about this instant found bliss   Just tell them I'm done with this      Ohh, I'm done with this       Note: None of this stuff ever happened in my life, I know I must freak some people out when I write my songs but that never happened.

20090309212355AAxqyyh	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	A Poll for my fellow Jewish Y/A users and contacts please?	This was inspired by another question in Yahoo Answers  that linked to this survey by the Pew Forum on Public Life    http://usatoday.com/news/graphics/2008_p...    I answered there with my opinions on a few of them, but primarily why I think the poll showed the statistics it did for Jews in the U.S.       I hope all my Jewish contacts answer and that all of you get other Jews that you may be connected to that I don't yet know here to respond.   ONLY responses from Jews will be counted for the purpose of this survey.  If you wish to make a Yahoo poll of your own for the views of other religions, please do so and email me, I'd find that interesting as well.  This is an interesting topic to me and I wonder if these same q's were asked of Y/A users if it would match Pew's random calling.      I am connected to a number of Jews here from every branch of Judaism and from five continents and am very curious to see if your answers to each of these 13 questions would be give similar results.     The poll at USA Today reads to me as if a high percentage of secular and or Reform Jews answered and I'm curious if the Jewish users who frequent Y/A would have a similar pattern of answers.   Since I am also asking Jews in other countries, this poll is slightly different since it is about American life.  I'm more curious of overall Jewish worldviews..since I'm a Jew.  Best answer goes to most thorough explanation for your choices..because this isn't really about deciding who is best but is a real, actual POLL under Polls and Surveys  and every answer giving a real opinion from a real Jew is a best answer but I can only choose one:)   Please include what branch of Judaism to which you belong and or were raised and if you are practicing or not.     list 1-13 and then your choice   Thanks a bunch!

20090309211403AAQa2fR	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Blacks and whites dating...What do you think?	I'm white, and I've been bright up that race doesn't matter what so    ever. And I honestly believe that it's nothing more than the way you   look. BUT...I love in Atlanta (which is more black than white)   and when I like a guy, I'm normally not shy about it. And I   just go for the guy.    But, when it's a black guy I'm always afraid that the guy might have   a problem with me bc I'm white.   Here in Atlanta, I've come across a lot of blacks that didn't like   me bc I was white.    And, I have a few white friends that think dating someone out   of your race is "gross"   So this just makes me afraid of letting someone black know that I   like them.      Is it weird to you if it's a white girl and black guy?

I really don't plan to publish... but in the future I'm going to have to do a Senior Project--so I might as well start now~ :D      Anyhoo:   I was wondering if anyone had any tips, tricks, or advice on starting to make a manga. I'd like to know how to divide the panels up, what materials to use, etc.   I pretty much have the plot set up... along with the characters. I just need to get it on paper!   I also plan to have the manga read right to left~      Thanks!!

20090309225832AAze5jk	Entertainment & Music;Television;Comedy	How many actors have managed to have a second successful TV show?	I'm mainly interested in sitcoms, but if you have other examples, that would be great. :)      I'd say "two successful TV shows" would mean two shows that had runs of 5 years each and/or became syndicated.      The only one I can think of is maybe Lee Majors with the Six Million Dollar Man and Fall Guy, Kate Sagal (Married with Children, Futurama), and on the border would be Hank Azaria (Mad about You, Simpsons, Herman's Head).      Of course, the queen of TV would be Heather Locklear with TJ Hooker, Melrose Place, and Dynasty.

I am having a lot of trouble talking to people, whether it be guys or girls. Like if I am with a group of people I am completely fine with not saying a word and just listening along with the convo.

Also, this doesn't happen all the time, just most of the time.      Any advice?

20090309215510AA6iycM	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	What's you favorite childhood story?	i didn't grow up with this one. i read it in a book once.      here goes                      "The Most Foolish Traveler in the World"         A foolish traveler was on a journey. He was stupid because he was easily tricked. The townspeople took advantage of him. On that journey, he was tricked into giving away all his money, clothes, and shoes. But the traveler was foolish, so when the townspeople lied to him saying, "This will really help," tears would stream down his face and he would say, "Please be happy."   When he gave away his last belonging, he was naked and ashamed to be seen. So he decided to travel in the forest. Then he met the monsters who lived in the forest. They wanted to eat him, so they tricked him with clever words. Of course, the traveler was fooled and when the monsters asked, he gave up his arms and legs.    Eventually, the traveler was nothing but a head. He even gave his eyes to the last monster he met. As the monster munched on his eyes, he said: "Thank you. I'll give you this in return," and left him. But that was a lie too.   His gift was a single piece of paper that had "fool" written on it. But the traveler cried and cried, saying: "Thank you. Thank you. This is the first time anyone's given me anything. I'm so happy. Thank you. Thank you" and tears kept flowing from his eye sockets, and while he was crying.....   ......he died.

20090309232003AAwsZDy	Entertainment & Music;Horoscopes	I'm a Sag yet I don't get along w. my compatible signs?	I'm a Sag girl and I'm very loyal to my few close friends and family. I'm also the oldest and it's natural for me to want to take care of those around me. I'm not overbearing but I'll do little things to express I care, that I'm there anytime. Lately, I feel that whenever I really need someone - advice or emotional support, my friends aren't really "there" for me as much as I am for them. I feel alone and me asking for advice seems so selfish. I'm very independent minded and I'm not clingy yet they sense something and run off and I'm left alone.       LEO: I've known her for about 5 years now and she's considered one of my few close friends but she's so overbearing for me. Like I said, I'm very open w. ppl close to me - if I'm scared in a given moment, she'll respond with, "omg. I'm a year younger than you are and I'm not even scared. I'm more mature than you are". AURGH. She gives crappy advice in which she gets biased. I feel like I can't be myself w. her anymore b/c w. if I'm at one of my bad points/vulnerable times in my life, she judges me based on that. For the past 2 yrs i was an idiot and was screwed over by a fellow sag friend who i grew to love. After watching "she's just not that into you" she said i reminded her of the main character - i was offended b/c that's not the person I am normally. I was in a bad situation but that doesn't mean I'm a weak person. Yes, as a sag I'm a blunt person but I"m not rude about it - she is.       GEMINI - okay, in my blunt sense: she's the most immature 22yr old I've ever met. I'm not saying all geminis are immature but fr. my experience she has this "air head" mentality at times. I tolerate/respect it but inside it bugs me. We had a semester of nursing school together and during one of her labs, I broke down fr stress (normal for that class) and she started LAUGHING. I also realize that she never calls me UNLESS she wants something fr me. She's very manipulative and doesn't take "no" for an answer. She's a selfish "youngin".       I'm grateful for friends like these - they're not all bad but the older I'm getting, i'm doubting my friendships. Quality vs qunatity, right? They live very close to me and are they are there for me but not really "THERE" for me, you know? I've been told I'm mature for my age (i'm in my early 20's yet I get along w. older ppl better)...or maybe I'm just weird...      what's wrong w. me?

20090309212332AAyQsKj	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rap and Hip-Hop	Please dear god somebody know this?	I'm trying to find a song but i don't know the artist or the song's name, it isn't really hip hop but this is the closest category i would put it under. The beat is like a techno beat but its really slow and pop sounding. The song doesnt sound like your average stupid lil wayne/souljaman hip hop song. The only reason I would consider it hip-hop is because the guy raps in it but its more like talking and it's way to slow to be a techno song. The guy had long curly hair and the background in the music video was kinda tripy-ish, I only remember green.

I ordered a case for my mando, and I kind of have to force the lid down as I have to have the top lid push the mandolin down and I don't know if it should be like this. It seems like it could break but the lady told me at one store that the mandolin should fit very snugly in there and I'm not sure if I'm going to break it or what. So I tried it only latching two of them and leaving the middle latch up to see if that would create less pressure where it is pushing down on and I don't know what to do, just ask my mando instructor or what do you think

I applied to a million different places with a very impressive resume and I got nothing.  Probably because Im not a guy (they apparently get better jobs most of the time.)  I am a single mother.  I make GREAT money (around $300 in tips and then whatever I get for cashiering and part-time managing) doing what I do. It's freaking fun and I love the people I work with.  That's rare that someone actually loves going to work everyday, lol.      What made me ask this question is because a guy I USED to talk too (he's apparently an asshole), said that I should get a real job like being a secretary, which I wouldnt even make that much money doing that boring crap.  He's a sarcastic person so I dont know if he was serious or not, but made me think.      Tell me what you guys think.        P.S. Im not gonna quit my job because of what he said.  Just want other people's opinions.

20090309210633AA823wq	Entertainment & Music;Celebrities	Jonas Brothers fans...Do you think that if they were on American Idol, they would make it?	Personally, I'm not sure they're quite good enough to make it through Idol. Nick, maybe -- he's the best singer out of them all -- but he's not very confident. He's not comfortable in his own skin. But the other two, I don't think they'd stand a huge chance.

Who else thinks that the song Dead and Gone would be much better if T.I. wasn't in it? I love Justin Timberlakes chorus but can't stand the rap part.      I guess I am not the biggest TI fan since he spits 16 bars and the word at the end of each sentence is the same. If you pay attention he will use the same 5-6 words to make each of his lines rhyme.      Also I can't think of 1 TI song on his new CD that is tight that does not have a guest on it. GARBAGE!

"Go Telemann I've lost my baton!"      So this guy was writing a movie about Mozart, and he wanted  Arnold Schwarzenegger (sp?) to play him. The former Terminator read the script and said, "I don't really want to play Mozart right now. But if you change the script a little bit, I'll be Bach."      Show me a piano falling down a mine shaft and I'll show you A flat minor.      Pretty awful, right? XD So, what are the worst classical music jokes YOU'VE ever heard? I'm a proud violist, so feel free to tell viola jokes but don't expect to get best answer. XD This could arguably go in Jokes and Riddles, I know. Wanted my fellow classical lovers ideas though.

The class was relatively easy, but there was a catch. There were no homework assignments or tests, but there was a final exam that would have only one question on it.      When everyone received the test it was a blank sheet of paper with a solitary question on it: "What is risk?"      Most students were able to pass, but only one student received 100% for the class! Even stranger was that he only wrote down one word!      What did he write?

So all of the names that they wrote, and the names that any posessed humans may have written, are all in there. That is a lot of names. Crackpots like Mikami are filling an entire page per day! So if the pages never run out, and the Notebook isn't getting visibly thicker, what is being deleted?   What do you think?

It’s also unfair that he might be dropped from his record label.      I still love his music and it would be sad if he his career ended because of this.      Does anyone agree

I'm not exactly sure if this is the write wording, but how do you sing high while sounding like your voice is lower?  When I sing high (I'm a guy), it sounds like a voice that would sound like Coldplay's voice.  But when you listening to something like Foo Fighters, he sings high but it doesn't sound quite the same.  If I attempt the same high pitch from a Foo Fighter song, it doesn't sound the same but sounds much more similar to Coldplay's voice.  Is it just how my voice is?  Something I can't change?
