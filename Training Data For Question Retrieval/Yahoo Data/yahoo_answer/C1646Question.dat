If there was a "George Galloway" anywhere in the Muslim world and he was the other way around, i.e. supporting Israel and criticizing Islam, etc, he would be pelted with stones all the way to the police station, tried, and imprisoned and tortured or killed. Or his corpse would rot in a gutter.      Yamin Zakaria and Anjem Choudary in Britain, Tag El Din El Hilali in Australia, Mahmoud El Masri in Canada... the West cherishes freedom, even when freedom is used to destroy its own government and culture.      Remember this every time you think it's racist to say, "Our values are better."

20090310051152AAWS5mh	Travel;Asia Pacific;Japan	How would a 5'11 ft (180 cm) woman be viewed in Japan?	I spent some time in Japan in my youth but I haven't been back in a few years. In that time, I've grown to be 5'11 ft. I rarely remember seeing women or men that tall while I was there. So anyway, I wondering if being tall will make me stick out like a sore thumb. I'm already a red-head and darker skinned so I'm not in the running to blend in very well and I'm not a fan of standing out. Also how hard will it be to find clothing to fit me. As an American, I find it hard to find clothes to fit me a lot in America so I was wondering about Japan. Also my shoe size in America is a 10. I think that's a 26 in Japan. Will that be hard to find? Also one last question for women about bras. In America, I go between 32-34 around and at least large DD (usually DDD/E) for cup size. I think in Japan, that's equal to around like a 75G cup in Japan. Will it be easy to buy bras or am I just hoping for too much? Thanks.

Minor children had been involving themselves in crimes and you will never know what and who are behind these children. They could be used for crimes knowing that they cannot be put behind bars because of our law.

I have a wee baby of 7 months and a partner who is an English teacher, as am I. Anyway I would like some suggestions as to where to move?

Myself and my partner are not well off and this holiday was very expensive for us. We would have preferred to have been able to tip more often, but we ended up giving the staff who stood out most a tip on our leaving day.   We gave around ￡5-￡10 to those we really found the best, is this alright? I would have like to have given more but we were unable to. Do you think our tips were reasonable?      What are the wages like for hotel staff in Egypt?    How much are Bar and restaurant workers, room cleaners, and the amazing entertainment staff probably paid per hour?       Also they all seemed to work very long days, the restaurant was open from 6 til 11 and the same guy was there all day, then he would work seven days a week all year! Is this correct?

Will be traveling (in celebration of college graduation) to Europe from May 13th (Wed) to May 25th (Mon). I want to fly into Rome and out of Paris, spending about half of my 11 vacation days in each country. I'm open to visiting Rome, Venice, Florence, Pisa, Milan, Paris, possibly Brussels, Normandy, Mont Ste. Michel, etc. I know it's impossible to do it all. Does anyone have any suggestions/ideas or a successful itinerary for this trip? What should I leave out, and what is a must see? I'll have a France/Italy 5 travel day Eurail pass.
