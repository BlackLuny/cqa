Additionally it reduces waste in landfills which are gatting very full. It is increasingly harder to find space for landfills.<br>  <br>  Good question!|`|68a986852f756433d4bb1ec748016462aa	DJ suggested<br>  *We don't fill up our landfills as fast.  <br>  What is wrong with sequestering carbon in landfills?<br>  <br>  * The plastic doesn't break down over time and leach toxic chemicals into our drinking water.<br>  It isn't a serious risk<br>  <br>  * Plastic is oil that has already been discovered, pumped, and refined, so we eliminate the environmental degredation associated with making new plastics.<br>  Carbon is the 5 most abundant element in the earth's crust (if memory serves).  Much of the that carbon is in hydrocarbon form from original accretion of the earth (if the cold accretion theory is true).

This notion of saving resources is nonsense.  It is a recipe for poverty.  The US didn't become the richest nation on earth, and the greatest country in the history of the world by not utilizing resources.  It is precisely this sort of idiotic reasoning that spawned AGW.  The left fought against oil in the 1970s saying it was causing an ice age and now they are saying it is causing global warming.   It is purely about politics and extreme politics at that.<br>  <br>  It is pretty typical.  They don't want us to use oil from domestic sources or foreign.

20f3291b9320a302e9070bf55325531daa	One factor you're neglecting is that while TSI has decreased 1.3 W/m^2, the forcing we experience on the Earth's surface is only one-quarter of that, or a change of about 0.3 W/m^2.  Actually according to Hansen's calculations, it's closer to 0.2 W/m^2.<br>  <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/~jeh1/mailings/2009/20090113_Temperature.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.columbia.edu/~jeh1/mailings/2...</a><br>  <br>  This is equivalent to 7 years worth of the forcing from increasing CO2 (currently at 0.035 W/m^2 per year - see link above), which leads Hansen to conclude that even if we enter an extended period of solar inactivity, we're not going to enter any sort of Little Ice Age.<br>  <br>  So anyway, TSI has had a non-negligible impact on global temperatures in the short-term, and its combination with the recent strong La Nina cycles are the main explanations for the 'temperature lull' in recent years.  The bad news is that as we enter the increasing portion of the solar cycle and switch to El Nino conditions, we'll experience very high global temperatures as the anthropogenic warming signal is no longer masked, but rather amplified.  That's why GISS and Hadley have predicted that we'll break the 1998/2005 global temperature record within the next couple of years.<br>  <br>  *edit* by the way, jimbo and johnny illustrate the difference between AGW deniers and proponents perfectly.

y0MnsQRNaa	Nuclear energy by definition, is the energy from the nucleus of an atom. How a nuclear power plant makes electricity is described below.<br>  Despite all the cosmic energy that the word "nuclear" invokes, power plants that depend on atomic energy don't operate that differently from a typical coal-burning power plant. Both heat water into pressurized steam, which drives a turbine generator. The key difference between the two plants is the method of heating the water. While coal plants burn fossil fuels, nuclear plants depend on the heat that occurs during nuclear fission, when one atom splits into two.<br>  There are several components common to most types of reactors:<br>  <br>  Fuel. Usually ceramic pellets of uranium oxide (UO2) arranged in Zirconium steel alloy tubes to form fuel rods. The rods are arranged into fuel assemblies in the reactor core.<br>  <br>  Moderator. This is material which slows down the neutrons released from fission so that they cause more fission. It is usually water, but may be heavy water or graphite.<br>  <br>  Control rods. These are made with neutron-absorbing material such as silver, cadmium, hafnium or boron, and are inserted or withdrawn from the core to control the rate of reaction, or to halt it. (Secondary shutdown systems involve adding other neutron absorbers, usually boron in the primary cooling system.) This controls the average temperature and allows extra fuel to be added for a extended time between refueling.<br>  <br>  Coolant. A liquid or gas circulating through the core so as to transfer the heat from it. In light water reactors the moderator functions also as coolant.<br>  <br>  Pressure vessel or pressure tubes. Usually a robust steel vessel containing the reactor core and moderator/coolant, but it may be a series of tubes holding the fuel and conveying the coolant through the moderator.<br>  <br>  Steam generator. Part of the cooling system in Pressurized Water Reactors where the heat from the reactor is used to make steam for the turbine. Some reactor designs, called  Boiling Water Reactors, do not have S/Gs but instead allow boiling in the reactor core to produce steam for the turbine..<br>  <br>  Containment. The structure around the reactor core which is designed to protect it from outside intrusion and to protect those outside from the effects of radiation in case of any major malfunction inside. It is typically a meter (3ft.) thick  concrete and steel structure designed to be air/water tight to prevent any leak to the environment in the worst case Loss Of Coolant accident.<br>  <br>  Most reactors need to be shut down for refueling, so that the pressure vessel can be opened up. In this case refueling is at intervals of 1-2 years, when a quarter to a third of the fuel assemblies are replaced with fresh ones. The CANDU and RBMK types have pressure tubes (rather than a pressure vessel enclosing the reactor core) and can be refueled while still generating electricity by disconnecting individual pressure tubes.<br>  <br>  If graphite or heavy water is used as moderator, it is possible to run a power reactor on natural instead of enriched uranium. Natural uranium has the same elemental composition as when it was mined (0.7% U-235, over 99.2% U-238), enriched uranium has had the proportion of the fissile isotope (U-235) increased by a process called enrichment, commonly to 3.5 - 5.0%. In this case the moderator can be ordinary water, and such reactors are collectively called light water reactors. Because the light water absorbs neutrons as well as slowing them, it is less efficient as a moderator than heavy water or graphite.<br>  <br>  Practically all fuel is ceramic uranium oxide (UO2 with a melting point of 2800°C) and most is enriched. The fuel pellets (usually about 1 cm diameter and 1.5 cm long) are typically arranged in a long zirconium alloy (zircaloy) tube to form a fuel rod, the zirconium being hard, corrosion-resistant and permeable to neutrons. Up to 264 rods form a fuel assembly, which is an open lattice and can be lifted into and out of the reactor core. In the most common reactors these are about 3.5-4.0 meters (3ft.) long.<br>  The  uranium 235 in these pellets absorb slowed down (moderated or thermal) neutrons, becoming unstable U-236 which splits, creating; heat, gamma, neutrons, and fission fragments. The heat generated can be calculated from the mass loss in the fission process equal to the famous equation E=MC squared, also known as binding energy. The energy released from a single fuel pellet is equivalent to the energy released burning 1 ton of coal.<br>  The links below have some excellent detailed information and graphics about nuclear power. I hope this helps you to de-mystify nuclear power, it really isn't that complicated, and is a safe, reliable, environmentally friendly, economical, energy source.|`|Homzf386aa	energy made from exploiting the atom (nucleas) is simply called nuclear energy.it is very expensive ,dangerous to maintain the reactor,ther are chances to radiation effect.E=mc2 einsten formula is basic behind this .

If the ice returned 6,000 years ago that would be a far shorter interglacial than we've had since the ice age began and though the interglacials have many common features they don't all begin or end in the same way or at the same rate. There is a lot of necessary speculation and inference done from fairly tenuous ice core and sediment data so there is a lot we don't know. That data can be cherry-picked as well such as excluding tree-ring data that doesn't agree with preconceived notions.<br>  <br>  Interglacials don't always last the same amount of time and it's unclear exactly why they begin or end. Theories include orbital eccentricities, solar output variation and other things but the Earth has endured far more CO2 than we could possibly put into the air with no dire consequences and endless warming. You're right that this interglacial has been unusual and beneficial for humanity, the variations have been minor with no rapid cooling or warming compared to many past interglacials.<br>  <br>  You probably know that the Little Ice Age included the Maunder Minimum, a period with no sunspots, which was the coldest part of the period. Today's sun is nearly devoid of sunspots, the oceans are in a cooling trend that may last decades and we're nearing the end of the average length of an interglacial. Draw your own conclusions from that but even another Little Ice Age would cause far more death and damage than warming would do. You can adapt to heat but you would find it very hard to live under a mile of ice.<br>  <br>  Humans have survived temps warmer than they are now and also far colder, but cold temps and ice would cause the population of most species to plummet dramatically as natural adaptation is too slow to keep up. It would get very crowded in equatorial areas if the ice does return since there is little land mass there, most of the land on Earth would be covered in glacial ice again.|`|75977462e20038311663eefd8f52cc2daa	during the past ice age, homo sapiens were only living in warm areas.<br>  there wasn't a need for cold adaptation.<br>  <br>  yes, we're in our 2nd interglaciation.  but it's the first one during which we've moved out to the entire world.<br>  <br>  ice ages are not regular enough that you can set your clock by them.<br>  i (i was going to say we) don't know why one didn't start 6k years ago.<br>  it wasn't us.<br>  <br>  from the fact that this is posted under global warming, one might infer that you think that what's been happening for the last 100 or 200 years is natural.  the rest is.  but that's not the case.  it might be good to keep in mind that the world came out of the little ice age only 150 years ago.  many decades after coal came into use.  no, i don't think that amount of coal use was the cause, but it sure is an interesting coincidence.<br>  <br>  however, to think that what's happening today is a result that's related to the fact that the ice age didn't start 6k years ago is not correct.  the temperature curve in the last few decades is very different from any found in geologic records.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.seed.slb.com/en/scictr/watch/climate_change/change.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.seed.slb.com/en/scictr/watch/...</a>  <== good article, and temp graphs.
20f3291b9320a302e9070bf55325531daa	Sounds kind of similar to an individual author's h-index.<br>  <br>  I would bet a lot of money that the quality of references used by the IPCC is leaps and bounds above those used by skeptics.  Just as one recent example, in discussing climate sensitivity, Roy Spencer cited a reconstruction by Craig Loehle which was only published in Energy&Environment.<br>  <a href="http://www.drroyspencer.com/global-warming-background-articles/2000-years-of-global-temperatures/" rel="nofollow">http://www.drroyspencer.com/global-warmi...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2007/12/past-reconstructions/" rel="nofollow">http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/arc...</a><br>  <br>  As you note, this doesn't even register on the scale.  In comparison, I believe the IPCC uses a number of peer-reviewed reconstructions, including the deniers' favorite, Mann et al.  The updated Mann reconstruction was recently published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, which I suspect registers rather high on the impact scale.<br>  <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2008/09/02/0805721105.full.pdf+html" rel="nofollow">http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2008/0...</a><br>  <br>  This is not an uncommon comparison.  Skeptics are forced to seek out the few studies (if any) which support their positions, and these studies are often published in journals with low standards and impacts like E&E.  Spencer wanted to find a reconstruction which showed that today's temperatures aren't particularly high, and the best he could do was Loehle's study with its many flaws.<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=ArPC72DeC62arxK.0701_wojzKIX;_ylv=3?qid=20080131103827AAvI6b0">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  The IPCC had thousands upon thousands of quality publications to choose from, and there's no reason for them not to use those with the largest impact.<br>  <br>  And then of course there are the layman 'skeptics', who usually cite right-wing blogs rather than any kind of scientific publication.|`|1219d6000cca01c9f3c4489d1c7b4a16aa	"An impact factor rates each journal in terms of its importance in a given field."<br>  <br>  Does it?  Because I read on the link you provide that impact factors are based on the frequency with which a publication is cited, and the 'quality' of the citations it uses, citations which are also cited more often are considered better.  It's similar to the page ranking system used to index the internet, links can be considered citations.  Google used to exclusively use Page Rank, until people figured that out and abused it, creating many domains which linked to each other, giving them higher placement in search engines, REGARDLESS OF THE QUALITY OF THE CONTENT.  Needless to say, the quality of the content was bad, these sites were often trying to lure users into buying something or generate ad revenue.<br>  <br>  But I digress... what this says is that the IPCC cites other papers more, and takes care when documenting where it's information comes from.  But none of that gives any more credence to their theories, because science is not consensus, nor is it based on what is popular, it is based on what is observed.<br>  <br>  Global warming alarmists keep telling us we're going to see increased hurricane activity, shorter winters, more severe droughts and hotter summers, but that is not what is observed.  They really beat their drums when their is a heat wave, or a strong hurricane, but they are silent when we have a long cold winter (like we have now) or a dull hurricane season.  They film icebergs calving and push those images on the public, yet the never talk about icebergs forming, and that's difficult to film because it's a slow process that takes a long time, and is very boring.  They say that a runaway greenhouse effect (and I do understand and believe in the greenhouse effect) is going to keep pushing up the average temperature globally, yet since the birth of industrialization, it's increased by 1 degree, well within the natural tolerance of the Earth's temperature to change in a 150 year time frame, and even within the tolerance of a thermometer.  I was taught in third grade that we reject changes in measurement within the error tolerance of a device, in the case of a thermometer, the error tolerance being 1 degree, because it may be related to a faulty device.|`|Uc7GM2Rnaa	You forget that many scientists and their research are funded by government.  Speaking against the current world political body, regardless of whether they are right or wrong, is akin to turning off the spigot of research dollars.<br>  <br>  Governments do not generally fund studies they do not believe in.<br>  <br>  So where do you think the general population of research scientists will fall on Global Warming when their paychecks can well be in jeopardy.<br>  <br>  You talk about skeptics as far out radicals.  I believe that Al Gore likened them to Holocaust deniers.  By saying that he hurt his own credibility.<br>  <br>  As evolved as science is, there are still miles to go and millions of discoveries to be made.

'Skeptics' grossly oversimplify the AGW theory, which proposes that CO2 is currently the dominant forcing, but not the only forcing, as is clear from this IPCC report graphic:<br>  <a href="http://www.realclimate.org/images/ipcc2007_radforc.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.realclimate.org/images/ipcc20...</a><br>  <br>  There is still plenty of variation in average global temperatures on a year-to-year basis from any number of factors, from TSI to PDO to volcanic eruptions, and so on.<br>  <br>  I don't know if AGW is too complex for these skeptics to understand or if they understand it but intentionally oversimplify it to build this strawman argument.  Either way, the argument itself is ridiculous.  This is a common debate tactic though - when you can't disprove what the opposition is arguing, just build up an easily-disproven argument and attribute it to your opponent.|`|1oxBCtmZaa	We're just going by your chief prognosticator's prognosis, which has so far been considerably off base.   <br>  <br>  When your side goes out there and says "we've got ten years" and most of the way into those ten years there is no increase in temperature, that fuels skepticism.  When your side makes specific predictions of warming given three scenarios - increased rate of CO2 emission, flat CO2 emission, and reduced CO2 emission - and the actual CO2 emissions increase at an increasing rate but the actual temperature increase is less than that modeled in the "reduced CO2" scenario, that fuels skepticism.<br>  <br>  In short - we expected nothing more or less than what your side predicted.   And the predictions failed to come to fruition.|`|aeVz0lrBaa	Why wouldn't skeptics say ''hey, Co2 has steadily increased over past 10 years, but why has any Global temp increase slowed ?'' <br>  <br>  seems perfectly reasonable to me, seeing as the main weapon in the AGW armour is that CO2 is the driver of Global Temp and is the main player in the AGW theory.<br>  <br>  Please remind me,  what was the name that Jim Hansen gave to Coal Trains ?|`|zince8g1aa	The claims of a linear system is a form of a strawman argument from contrarians.  They claim that the scientific community believes that only human activities affect the climate and thus we should largely see a steady year-over-year increase in global temperatures.  Then, every cooler year or two can be spun.|`|68a986852f756433d4bb1ec748016462aa	It is a good question.  Too often it seems to me that alarmist seem to predict that we increased the CO2 by 100 ppm, the temperature has increased by 1 degree (F), therefore another 100 ppm would increase it by 4 degrees.  In fact it would be nonlinear but would be nonlinear in a downward direction not increasing.  This should be due to less percentace of available spectrum that CO2 could absorb.  I would expect the increase CO2 to have a nonlinear reduction in effect with increased concentration.  Obviously I am extremely skeptical of the feedback mechanisms that are required for wild temperature increases.

Most surface stations are cited in violation of NOAA guidelines, too close to heat sources and pavement, a heat sink, so we don't know how much warming we actually had either. Rural stations lagged behind urban stations for this reason and we don't know what if any correction was made for this Urban Heat Island effect.<br>  <br>  The total amount of CO2 in the atmosphere is a fraction of what's stored by the oceans, a large portion of our emissions is taken up by the oceans. Yet a lab experiment will show that CO2 in a controlled environment will block certain wavelengths of long-wave infrared radiation. In the real world it's less clear since most of the infrared the Earth emits is already interacting with CO2 in our atmosphere and some is also effected by water vapor which is responsible for most of the global warming.<br>  <br>  To be technical, CO2 at the rate of 381 parts per million makes up .04% of our atmosphere. The overall warming we get from all sources is 33C and CO2 causes about 9% of that warming or around 3C. Yet the IPCC predicts that even a slight increase will cause catastrophic warming of 8C by 2100. This requires them to assume there is some unseen amplifier effect where the warming releases more water vapor to cause further warming, but the opposite is what actually occurs. If the IPCC predictions were possible we'd have had runaway warming many times in the past and it has never happened. The Earth has had CO2 levels 20 times higher than they are now with a temp increase about equal to the IPCC's predicted amount of 8C, but that would take thousands of years to put into the atmosphere at the current rate of increase. CO2 was 10 times higher than today during a past ice age and somehow the CO2 didn't keep the glaciers from advancing.<br>  <br>  Wanting to curb fossil fuel use and dependence is a good thing as is recycling and lower pollution and so on, but creating unfounded fear to achieve that end is short-sighted and wrong. With the sun still nearly blank of sunspots and the oceans in a cooling trend that may last decades, they still worry us about warming even though it is not happening today and their models are fatally flawed. Do you know that if you plug in real-world data from the past, those models cannot accurately predict the temp for that period? Then how can they predict future temp, the models always predict far more warming than the world experienced which is an odd coincidence.j<br>  <br>  It's also odd that NASA GISS, run by James Hansen a big proponent of global warmign, shows far less cooling since 2003 than satellite data, .96C/century instead of 3.6C/century.<br>  <br>  Here are some links for linlyons benefit:|`|liGKWP31aa	hmm.....well lemme start off by saying yes, global warming is a myth. its something made up by activist tree huggers saying SAVE THE PLANET, realization is that we cant save the planet.

AA11500132	see the Global Eco-village Network <a href="http://gen.ecovillage.org/" rel="nofollow">http://gen.ecovillage.org/</a><br>  <br>  Ecovillages are urban or rural communities of people, who strive to integrate a supportive social environment with a low-impact way of life. To achieve this, they integrate various aspects of ecological design, permaculture, ecological building, green production, alternative energy, community building practices, and much more.<br>  <br>  The technology is less important than the motivation and approach taken to create community and take account of the local ecological setting.
O0FGFJ69aa	yes the local health dept.should get you pointed in the right direction, as for myself i grew up on a farm and all we drank was well water and i miss it, the city water has a terrible taste to me, i wouldnt be too worried about the cloudy color its just sediments that have been stirred up by the rain but as for the water filters, brita uses a uses carbon filter which "catches" impurities, and if you dont change them at the recommended intervals you might end up with water that is contaminated|`|503f82e81abb8901e8e1451d174089feaa	Contact the health dept. in your area and they can tell you how to get that done.And yes a water filter is nice,however it also filters out the chemicals that keep you safe.Thar would depend on the results of your water tests.

uFQFRdczaa	Ethanol makes good economic sense in Brazil, even after paying the market price for cane sugar the materials are cheap, and distillation is done by burning the waste cane product.  Even now that gas prices have fallen, ethanol will be competitive.  <br>  <br>  This is not the case for corn ethanol, which takes tons more raw materials, far more land and water, and it takes nearly as much energy (often from the grid) to distill as you get back by burning the fuel.  <br>  <br>  Methanol is made from natural gas, which is often but not always cheaper per btu than petroleum.  In 2007 methanol made from natural gas was selling at $0.47 a gallon.  If it's made from biomethane, the fuel is free--though the natural gas digester is a huge building that will of course need to be paid for. Also, the reaction from methane to methanol is exothermic--which means it generates heat that could potentially be used to power the operation (loading the digester, for example)  Really it's a question of how fast a return on investment you're looking for, a well designed biomethanol operation would certainly net more income than its labor, materials, and energy costs.  Eventually the infrastructure will eventually pay for itself--after that it's all profit.|`|wX3P9Tlcaa	turning food into fuel is a bad idea. not in a world where people go to bed hungry.it also won't pay for itself ,the cost of the gasoline and diesel fuel to produce methanol ,cost much more than any savings you will realize using it.regardless of the alcohol   produced your not going to produce it economically . so no it doesn't make sense.|`|HL8W9yU6aa	Of course ethanol would make sense, but methanol is a completely different animal...|`|bfe4ad38e28ddda61b321173866c1f9aaa	Not yet, why do you think that the Federal government has to subsidize ethanol?  It takes more energy currently to make ethanol then the ethanol creates. It is a net loss of energy.|`|lmSoNMhPaa	if you make ethanal fuel  for every gallon of energy you use you get a gallon and 1/3 back from like corn. if you use sugar cane for every gallon you use to make it you get back 10 gallons of fuel.|`|z4V9kdR8aa	ethanol only makes sense if we can develop the process to convert cellulosic corn into ethanol.|`|0z5oESMSaa	FYI: ethanol does not require the use of food crops. The corn used for ethanol is FIELD CORN which only 10% of is used for food products like chips. It's main purpose is for livestock feed. In fact more than half of all the corn grown in the U.S. is field corn. And a third of the processed field corn used for ethanol gets fed to livestock afterwards which is actually better than feeding them straight field corn.<br>  <br>  Some more food for thought: it is doubtful anyone is going hungry due to the use of field corn for ethanol or any other crop for that matter. The sad fact is that farmers receive very little of the money you pay for food. Most of the price is due to middle men and transporting the product (fuel prices). If you look at MN, you will notice that overall field corn production has increased due to ethanol. Where farmers where struggling and ultimately calling it quits, MN farmers own their own ethanol production and profit well enough to expand their operations, reclaiming land from subdivisions which foreclosed . We transport little food to starving nations because it is not very economical. Ethanol is meant to give us more independence from foreign and domestic petroleum, and by investing in it, it will actually bring down the cost of transportation so we can ship more food to these starving nations. Of course we should not start replacing forests with ethanol crops like Brazil, but we should invest our money here rather than on imported fuels. Eventually we will start using second generation fuels which will be more effective and won't require the use of fodder.
