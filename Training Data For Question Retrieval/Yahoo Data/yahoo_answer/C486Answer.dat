gWSWRUAbaa	Dont know about the long term affects but I experienced short term effects.    I had a job and college with a tight schedule and only got 6 hours of sleep on a good night.    I took a mixture of energy pills, drank energy drinks one right after the other. Aside from the free coffee and coke.  It took a while for me to feel the effects. I remember it came on slow.. I started feeling a little dizzy and more tired like all that caffeine wasn't working anymore. I remember I got really nervous out of no where. THen I got nervous for stupid things, and it felt like I was always gonna get caught... I guess I became paranoid then one time in class I presented a project and started freaking out cuz I forgot what I was going to talk about... my hands started shaking and I wanted to pass out.. on top of all that my joints began aching more often...      after I quit I felt normal.. it took a while for the tired feeling to go away, I slept almost a good 24 hours before I completely recovered from it. I really don't suggust getting by on so much caffeine|`|k91hDzu9aa	worst of all, liver dammage.    insomnia, depression, mood swings, erectile dysfunction, ect.

hl4kkvXhaa	Well, everyone is different, but lavender, patchoulli, ylang ylang and vanilla are commonly used.  The top ones recommended by my friend who is a holistic healer (and relaxation therapist) are lavender, frankincense, and jasmine.  Personally, I prefer dragonsblood (I have never heard of the dragonstail or the other mentioned by someone else...but dragonsblood is really relaxing for me).  My second favorite is patchoulli.    The most effective method is to use some sort of relaxation technique such as meditation, yoga, or guided relaxation in conjunction with the aromatherapy because it will ease the physical tension caused by withdrawl from the pills he is taking.    You might be having trouble researching this because of the way you typed it into the search engine...calming isn't typically what you would look for.  Rather than searching for just incense, try typing "Aromatheraphy scents for relaxation" and other variations.  Otherwise, just typing "incense" is basically saying you are shopping for it.  Oils are also widely used, and your friend may benefit from trying these methods together...such as using the incense at home, and taking along a bottle of aromatherapy oil for when burning incense isn't convenient.    Hope this helps a bit!|`|yE2vM76naa	http://www.spiritualscents.com/eshop/10E...    That would be what I suggest, but if you think that you are going to get an addict off pills by switching them to incense, you might want to look out for the backlash. Just a heads up.    Anyhow, they smell much like burning leaves in the fall.|`|d3VV4b6vaa	frankincense is the very best for this.  or the scent of clary sage and/or marjoram can be very very sedating|`|k91hDzu9aa	lavender scented, and dragon tail. not dragon breath, not dragon smoke, but dragon tail.|`|paerqxfMaa	Different scents for different people.

cPRuJQ1Paa	I had my lap band surgery through Forerunners Healthcare Consultants in India I don't regret it at all I had a baby since then and I'm still able to take the weight off so far i am very happy. The key is to use a reputable surgeon. You want to be carefully screened beforehand to make sure you are a good candidate. Since my surgery I can walk without getting tired, I can play with my son; I can walk down the street with my head held high. I feel pretty for the fist time in years. I was given another shot at life. The surgery is a tool and how well that tool works is up to you!!    I would do it again in a heartbeat. I would recommend to every one who is suffering from the same problems as I did before but I would urge anyone who is interested to seek the best surgeon possible and make the decision based on the surgeons recommendations and your own personal goals!! Make sure the reasons for the surgery are the right one. The surgery isn't for someone who just "wants to be skinny". Do it for your health, for your life, for family. FOR YOU.    You can checkout their website.  http://www.forerunnershealthcare.com  Hope this helps.

OgaJqkSQaa	This happened to me after coming off Dianette - I gained almost a stone and developed severe acne and body hair to boot. You need to get your hormones back in balance. I recommend the herb vitex agnus castus. My periods were only coming every 50 days when I stopped the pill, but agnus castus brought them back down to 28. It also helped with the acne and weight gain.  Get some flax seed oil (cold pressed) and take daily to balance hormones. Evening primrose oil works well for some people but not others. Also take a good quality zinc supplement of 15mg per day.

NTBbZ7ITaa	sometimes your pulse may elevate a bit when you are sick....its still within a normal range.  Any where between 50-100 could be normal.  If you don't have chest or arm pain and shortness of breath chances are it could be nothing.  My daughter had the same thing ( turned 14 last dec ) turned out to be a food allergy.  Anxiety can cause it too ( its not easy being a teenager : - )  Happened to me when I was 35..had all the test and stuff..turned out it was anxiety.  Got treated for that and it went away.  ( it comes back now and then but Im 42 now )    I am not a medical professional so let your parents know what is going on ( now ) so they can get you checked if it continues.  Most likely its nothing.  Good luck young lady|`|517360c1a1db979fb2f19bbb959f22eaaa	The average pulse rate for anyone is 72 + or - 8 bpm. But pulse rates for girls is slightly faster by about 7 beats per minute. So a resting pulse rate of between 80-100 is normal for someone your age. And if you're a bit sick, it might be a bit higher, because your body's trying to fight off bugs. So don't worry. Your pulse rate if fine.|`|gXt0wdLuaa	Maybe you should see a doctor or something because it doesnt really sound right. 72 is the average and if you are fit it should be lower than that.|`|YYLzML9gaa	no its at a good range|`|eurqDxKCaa	It's normal

When you join, usually they will ask your goals and offer some sort of orientation. After that, if you don't want a personal training package, just say no. They are good about honoring that. The act of getting into workout clothes, getting in the car and going somewhere to work out really helps me stick to it.|`|SptW7fDCaa	The other person is correct. People don't usually bother you after you've signed up. I would go to a few gyms to check them out. They all have different ammenities and some are more busy than others. The busy ones might have limits on how long you can use machines and you might have to wait to use certain machines if they are too busy. That's why they have free trials at most gyms. Most major gyms have free 7-day trials. Different gyms have different machines. Some have machines with individual TVs, some have one TV for all of the cardio machines. Each gym has different classes. You'll want to see if they offer classes you like at times that you'll be available to take them.    I live in Los Angeles, so it's common to have busy gyms at peak hours(in the morning and in the evening).
O4KBKZEkaa	My mother was "Loosely" diagnoses about 8 years ago. We were basically told it could be a stroke, a tumor or M.S. They ruled out the first two but were unable to "Prove"  M.S. nevertheless her case is treated like M.S. She has weakness from the neck down and is unfortunately progressing very fast. It is a brutal disease and there is far too little support out there. Doctors often say it's all in your head.I find 90% of the medical community know far too little about what they are supposed to be treating. I truly hope your condition is not worsening. I know what my mom goes through and no one deserves that. My thoughts and prayers are with you. take care.|`|XhIYAH6Laa	I have been diagnosed for a little over a year now...I have had one episode where only my right arm was affected, but my last episode was my entire body...from my chest to my feet. The numbness..pins and needles feeling. It went away after about 2 months. I haven't had many attacks, as they think my symptoms of MS only presented themselves so soon because of the birth of my son, but from what I have experienced it defiantly can affect both sides of the body.    Edit: For someone to thumbs down my diagnosing process and what I have personally experienced is rediculous. Sorry had to throw that out there.|`|tAMRLjmgaa	I was diagnosed two years ago.The first sympton I had was slight numbness in my left foot which spread to three of my toes, a few weeks later my fingers on my left hand went numb.I also had a lotof pins and needles in both legs which got worse when I bent my head and if I walked quickley my legs would get very weak.I was on a steroid drip for three days but I dont think it helped.I have been on Avonex for nearly two years now and I havent had a major relapse.Now and again I have numbness,sometimes on both sides but I have the pins and needles all the time.|`|IzBgewmUaa	I was diagnosed 17 years ago with Chronic progressive MS.

hl4kkvXhaa	I don't know of any web site that gives you the statistics.    I usually don't go to either holistic/natural doctors or traditional...I have a lot of reference tools (books, web sites, etc.) that I use if I know what the problem is.  If I'm unsure about treating something, I ask a friend who is a certified holistic healer.  I don't turn to conventional meds until all else fails and it's a last resort (as in, I'm on my last legs).|`|duVTqRM4aa	"According to a new nationwide government survey (1), 36 percent of U.S. adults aged 18 years and over use some form of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)."  http://altmedicine.about.com/od/alternat...

1cef0b31719e047b8c16caf5d29cfedbaa	That's what second opinions are all about. You may not want to dish out the additional $40 but you're peace of mind is worth the money, especially if you find out that you do in fact need to have them removed. In the relative scheme of things $40 isn't that much money. Complain to your insurance company if you feel that they haven't gotten what they pay for and ask to be sent to another dermatologist.|`|xNkmK0SHaa	I can see that you had a troublesome experience with the dermatologist, but I can't quite see exactly what your question is.    On whose recommendation did you see that doctor?|`|654c7643984cd6b3f7f0f00356056e81aa	You are right--absolutely right.  I would call the office, tell the office manager you have a problem after your visit today and you would like to speak to the doctor, and for her to call  you.  Explain that either she calls you to discuss it, or you will call the state board that over-sees the licensing of doctors in your state.    That ought to get her to call you back; explain that you felt like you were at a Mary Kay party, not a doctor's office, and that you are concerned about the moles, you want her to re-examine you, or to give you a referral to another doctor, and that you WANT A REFUND!    What she did is way out of line.  I am a volunteer cancer educator for the American Cancer Society and I work closely with doctors and my sister is a doctor.  I can assure you that most doctors NEVER would do anything like what  happened to you, and would be as offended and full of disbelief as  you were.  She needs to be reported, whether or not you get your answers from her about your mole.    If you have health insurance, file a complaint with them, in writing, and tell them that you do not feel you were properly examined, you don't want them to pay her, and you want to see another doctor.      Good luck--please let me know how this turns out!|`|H1NjIT10aa	I wouldn't want to NOT treat moles that I felt suspicious about.    Go to a PCP.... If the mole isn't on your face, a PCP can remove your mole just as easily as a dermatologist.      FYI... My dad had a spot on his face that he was concerned about.  Three different doctors said they didn't think it was anything.  But they'd freeze it off anyway.  It kept coming back.  He went to one more doctor who took an actually biopsy and found yes it was cancerous.  She referred him to a different doctor because of the possible scar tissue involved.  The spot that three doctors said were nothing had grown and was sending off roots that were as long as three inches!      If you are uncomfortable with the moles Have Them Removed!|`|614tYbzxaa	I would get second opinion my brother had a mole he scraped it by accident when he went to hospital to check it out they kept him in it was cancerous.I wouldnt trust anyone that was more concerned about selling me something , she doesnt sound like a good doctor|`|AA12225723	Moles are not dangerous unless you notice changes in them, in size or appearance, over a period of a couple of months.  Dry skin in a bad condition during winter when we live in heated houses and the air is dry, over the counter medication will usually solve that.|`|NWwGl4k6aa	photoshop them.  ps: sounds like a quack.  get a new doctor.  if you can't trust your own doctor for medical advice, what's the point in fattening their pockets?|`|g0iQW5T1aa	What.....?  I don't even get your question.  Maybe you could learn to express yourself a little better.|`|tAYXUXreaa	You should have said that you were unwilling to pay the bill before you even left. There is no way out of paying it now. I would have told her I am not here to learn about fine lines, I am here to learn about my moles. If that didn't shut her up, should have gotten up and walked out. Doctors never sees to amaze me. Another idea is to turn her into the board. Search the name of it. They could fine her for doing this. That might not save you money, but it will other people just like you.
YUjVFkocaa	ur hands should be slightly wider than ur shoulders, by about 2-3 inches from the edge of ur shoulder, on each side.    They should be in line with your chest- not in front or behind your chest.    Your legs should be straight out, ur back and legs should be straight in a plank.      When you go down to do your pushup, your elbows should come out sideways, so you work your CHEST. if your elbows are going back right next to ur body, and u feel it work ur triceps (arms), you ARE DOING IT WRONG!  This can hurt the wrists and elbows, and makes you a little-bod with weak core strength.      ====================    Tips:    Do them on a soft but firm surface, like a mat, rug, carpet floor, or just a couple shirts if you don't have anything else.    Do NOT do pushups on something TOO soft, like a bed or couch- they may feel easy on the hands, but it hurts the wrist, because there isn't enough support, and they will bend funny when you do push-ups on them.    Take more calcium pills, get more sleep, and eat a healthy, high-protein, organic, balanced diet.  This should do many things- heal and strengthen and grow your bones.... get you more rested... recover and grow muscles... and make you healthier in general.  All this will help you not be as much of a wimp when it comes to doing push-ups, as you will be stronger and have better bones.    you should run if you're that fat (IF you're fat... I can't really tell)... if you're not fat, then the problem is the one above.    You should work out your legs equally (as in lunges and prison squats, if ur gonna do pushups and pullups)... and you should run sprints and middle/long distance.  To look "sexy" and also to become a great athlete, you MUST vary up your exercise and become good at everything.|`|TuOp3hNPaa	jus keep doing them. ur wrist hurt cuz there getting a workout too. when u get them stronger they wont get as sore.  but for a normal push up...lay on your stomach. then ur feet together an be on your toes then put ur arms out an push-up. then the key thing is keeping ur back straight, also to come all the way down on each one an touch ur nose. ur nose should touch an ur chest an stomach should be almost touching.

M3pRAe7Vaa	Stretch marks are caused by the skin stretching faster than the body is able to grow/stretch.  I feel your discomfort; I too developed stretch marks around 7th grade, on my breasts.  Unfortunately, they are permanent, but there are things you can do to reduce their appearance.    Stri-Vectin cream.  This cream has been shown to reduce stretch marks in clinical studies.    There is always laser surgery, which is extremely expensive (I've looked into it).  This is truly the only way to eliminate them.    Please know that you are more focused on your stretch marks than everyone else is.  Most people probably don't notice them as much as you do.  I am now nearly 27, and have lived with my stretch marks for years.  Just be confident, and know that people aren't focused on your stretch marks, but the wonderful person you are.  My advice is to try the Stri-Vectin cream, it will reduce the appearance.    Best of luck.|`|5R3IyPPUaa	I believe there's a cream that does make it so they go away at least a little bit, and its called Retin-A.  I used it for a little while, and it started to make the ones i had fade more.  Exercising and working out do help if what youre doing helps you to get rid of a muffin top, but yeah I used Retin-A and it helped them go away. I also had them at a real young age, so i know how it feels. I hope the cream could help you out, if that's what youre looking for. =]|`|bmr9ELhUaa	use coco butter you can get it @ drug stores

kqSd3y2saa	Are you planning to eat or not? If you just drink water, you will lose your weight short term, but then you will experience the yo-yo effect, because your body will naturally want to replenish missing nutrients. So fasting is good to cleanse your body, but if you want to lose weight you need a long term plan based on healthy food and exercise.

A good friend of mine switches completely from soft drinks, tea, coffee, and even milk to just water and lost a great deal of weight.     Now, those kind of results aren't guaranteed, but by switching to water even to a lesser degree is likely to help you lose weight. You're just cutting a whole lot of excess calories.|`|OgaJqkSQaa	Yes - I think so. I really believe soft drinks contribute to obesity and poor health. Don't touch them! I don't know about tea though.|`|vvT9WmqIaa	Water and tea are good for you.  If you normally drink non-diet soft drinks and stop, you will definitely lose weight.

What many people don't realize is that this cannot just be done overnight! If you try to make drastic changes in your diet too quickly, chances are that you will only be frustrated and disappointed with your loosing that belly fat.    Also, there is more to weight loss than just diet and exercise. In this article I will give two great Tips on How to Get Rid of Belly Fat.     1. Avoid self-sabotaging train of thoughts: Self-sabotaging thoughts will do you more harm than think. Just imagine, if you always think that you cannot do the things you need to do in order to lose weight, how can you ever loose that belly fat? If you think that you cannot do sit-ups and push-ups, you are probably jumping to conclusions and being too overly self-crital even before you have tried any exercises! If you think that doing thirty push-ups is too much for you, then start small. Start with 10-15 push-ups, and thank yourself once you have done it successfully! Then try to add one or two extra push-ups every day to your routine until you reach your target of thirty.     You see, when you start small, it becomes much easier to reach your goals! Instead of thinking too much about it, just take action and DO it! The amount of time you spend on thinking and criticizing yourself, you may as well as spend it on some exercise. While the former will do you no good, the latter will help you burn fat and loose that belly fat fast!     2. Get help & support: Proper support is important in order to keep you on point and motivated. Without support, you won't be able to lose weight successfully. That is why it is essential that you enlist the support of your friends and family who understand you and support your goals. It is also essential that you choose a weight loss program which offers support to its members in the form of a support group or forum. In a forum, you will get support and tips from your peers and experts alike! Surround yourself with supportive people and stay away from the negative people who can only find faults with you!     If you follow these Tips on How to Get Rid of Belly Fat there is no reason why you won't be able to lose that belly fat! Remember that you can achieve whatever you believe or think in your mind. If you believe you can loose belly fat fast, then you WILL! I know that this sounds very much like The Secret and The Law of Attraction but it is very true!|`|NWfIT0saaa	5'5" and 126 lbs....I really don't think you need to lose any weight.

Ccs9LeIEaa	Hahah I don't think its a big secret, just look at the facts. Its so obvious why fat people look for the easy way to lose weight...they put it on the easy way by refusing to make healthy choices in the first place, opting for fast food and soda rather than a salad with salmon and water.   I don't think its that they are stupid. Its more an issue of laziness...and I think its some peoples nature to look for the easy out|`|AA11909297	I KNOW!    I have a friend who has struggled with her weight for years - it's not a genetic thing, it is because she has about 5 meals a day.

So yes working hard is the only way to lose weight.  There is not magic pill or supper skinny drink in a cane that well make you thin.    It's Takes hard work, and a Strong will.  But the only way to do it, is too do it for yourself and no one else.  Thats why most people fail at it, and want a quick fix to lose weight  Cuz they want to look good for other people., and not for themselves.    Thats why i ended up gaining like 15 of those pounds back, Cuz i have not went jogging in over 3 months now.  First i stopped do to being sick, then when i get better i did not start up cuz of Holidays, and now it's hard to get back into it.  Cuz i was getting stressed cuz i started wanting to lose weight and look good for other people and not me.  Thats how i lost the 90 pounds last year, and worked out for just me and only me. that way i knew if i failed i would not be letting anyone else down but myself. So if i did not lose weight it would have been ok cuz no one wanted me too really.    Why dont Skinny people understand what us Fat people go through or went through|`|AA10844779	Why do some people not understand that not everyone can be skinny? Some people just are big just like some of us luckier ones are skinny without having to try - stop looking down on people just because they're fat, OK? Some people just can't exercise (people with severe asthma for one). Some of my relatives are naturally "big-built" and tried all sorts of diets and exercise over the years, one of them now finally lost some weight after a stomach operation.    I'm lucky enough to be skinny without even trying, but that doesn't go for everyone, what's so wrong about diversity anyway?|`|AVzQs5Uhaa	WELL MOST PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE THAT YOUR NOT GONNA LOOSE WEIGHT SUPER FAST BECAUSE  ITS NOT HEALTHY. YOU NEED TO EAT A BALANCED DIET, THE RIGHT PROPORTIONS AND HAVE YOUR CALORIES EQUAL TO THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY YOU PUT OUT A DAY(THERE ARE CALCULATIONS FOR THAT) THEY THINK THAT SKIPPING MEALS HELPS WHEN IN REALITY  IT ONLY MAKES YOU BIGGER. ACTUALLY THEY SAY TO EAT 5 CORRECTLY PROPORTIONED MEALS A DAY MEANING, LIKE BREAKFAST, A SNACK LIKE NUTS OR FRUIT SOMETHING HEALTHY NOT A HUGE MEAL,THEN LUNCH, ANOTHER SNACK AND DINNER. ALSO A LOT DON'T GET THAT YOU NEED TO FIND WHAT WORK FOR YOU, SOME NEED LESS FAT, OTHERS NEED LESS CARBS  AND SOME NEED BOTH. IN REALITY THE HEALTHY WAY TO LOOSE WEIGHT IS 2 TO 3 LBS A WEEK AND EXERCISE REGULARLY TO WHERE YOUR HEART RATE IS IN YOUR TARGET RANGE FOR AT LEAST 30 MINS. THEY ALSO THINK THAT CUZ THEY ARE DRINKING DIET ITS BETTER FOR YOU IN REALITY ITS NOT, BECAUSE YOU ARE DRINKING DIET THEY SUBSTITUTE SUGAR THEY USE IS CHEMICALS AND THEY TEND TO DRINK MORE THEN IF THEY JUST HAD A REGULAR SODA ALSO THEY DON'T DRINK ENOUGH WATER. IT COMES DOWN TO THE FACT THAT THEY WANT IT DONE FAST AND NOW  AND WANT THE EASIEST WAY TO DO IT WITH OUT CHANGING WHAT THEY EAT. YES GENES DO PLAY A SMALL ROLE IN  IT BUT YOU CANT BLAME IT ON THAT IT JUST MEANS THAT YOU HAVE TO WORK A LITTLE HARDER ( AND NO IM NOT SKINNY EITHER) . IT'S JUST COMMON SENSE TALK TO DOCTORS, NUTRITIONIST AND TAKE CLASSES YOU WILL FIND OUT THEY ALL SAY THE SAME THING.

ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).  you can try sparkpeople.com (sparkteens.com), these are free sites for people with weight problems.|`|gScUXaOEaa	Try eating a calorie-based breakfast, such as Frosted Flakes Gold which is good for you and good for your taste buds.

Then I felt in love and stopped eating, and I got slim permanently.  This experience showed that when you torture your body and constantly think about eating or not eating (staying on diets forces you to food obsession), it will always strike back. Once you stop thinking about not eating and focus on your life (love, work, passion), you will lose weight without even noticing it.  And of course: healthy life style is always helpful. Exercise (find activity you enjoy) and eat healthy organic food. But don't do it just to lose weight, do it for your overall happiness.

hl4kkvXhaa	Well, for me, I feel better.  For one, alternative medicine is about healing not only the physical problem but also helps with underlying causes.  For instance, stress and depression are known to make you physically sick, and it's nice to know that there are safer alternatives such as meditation, relaxation, chakra balance, and things like this.      Another major plus is that you are not using manmade chemicals.  I find it terrifying to hear about how prolonged use of "traditional" medicine can cause severe damage to your body...liver, heart, blood vessels, etc.  Plus, it amazes me how many lawsuits are in the news today about medicines being recalled for causing life threatening blood clots, stroke, or death.  Most alternative or holistic medicine is found within nature, and so you are left with a lot few side effects.    The cost is another major factor.  Billions are spent each year in traditional medication.  It amazes me that drug companies can spend so much money on advertising stupid products like Cialis or Viagra, and then complain that they need to charge hundreds of dollars for a month supply of one pill!  My ex is on medicine for depression...and if it weren't for Medicaid for the disabled, the bill for four Rxs would be over $500!  That's all that money the drug companies want you to pay for medicine you just might find out later in life has caused damage that warrants another medication (or more)...and basically, you are paying to destroy your body.  It just makes no sense to me.|`|a48b8f799e030a044da781ffac6f94cdaa	Its safe - no chemicals are used , it treats the whole person - it strengthens the vital force (or immune system)|`|bjN4eaqUaa	Normally plants made medicines called alternative or herbal medicnes.

vhr6VXRkaa	The atmosphere really depends on the gym you attend.  The gym I used to go to (a small local chain, smack in the middle of Center City) is geared mostly towards professionals and people generally go before or after work or on their lunch break.  Everyone is there to get in a quick workout before heading home or getting back to the office and as a result, I was never bothered by a trainer or another member while I was trying to workout.  Unfortunately, I had to switch gyms to LA fitness and that place is more of a meat market.  I have been harassed by the trainers to do personal training sessions (which I don't need a. because I am very proficient with the equipment and b. because my workout buddy used to me a trainer and can give me tips).  I basically told them no very sternly once and they stopped asking.  I also get hit on by meat heads at LA Fitness while I am trying to workout.  I combat that by working out mostly with a guy friend, wearing my headphones all the time and very assertively telling them that I am here to workout, not get a date and that they might look better if they stopped using the gym to pick up girls and actually utilized the equipment instead.|`|Z6ARD2iYaa	It sux|`|WwXrTQgaaa	I'm that way too. Just don't make eye contact or act like you don't know what you're doing. Go to a far corner if it's spread out.

It's your weight you should trying to keep with in a healthy range. Calculate your BMI and you will find your healthy range. I believe it is 125-170 for 5'10". I know this cause I am also 5'10" and I am 25 years old, but I have been 5'10" since I was 17 (got a 1.5 inch growth spurt when I was 17). Don't stress honey, your are fine.

F0LgeWs5aa	Good Luck   I hope this helps..    I have put two links below that are very good standards for a total weight (BMI) and Military standards for push ups and sit ups.    But first get your doctors approval to do these types of exercises, OK?  It does you no good to injure yourself and toss what you have done already out the window...    I helped several new recruits pass a fitness test with a push up and sit up system, that worked for me.    first day do a set of each until total exhaustion, that's one strait set of each until you cannot do even half a push up or sit up without rest. Write it down. Now take half of that number and do three sets two times a day, one in the morning, one at night. example, your total exhaustion number might be 10 push ups. you will do 5 P/U rest one minute, 5 more P/U 1min. rest  5 more, and the do the sit ups the same. This actually builds muscle memory and and does not burn you out beyond recovery.  Rest one day if needed, your muscles will let you know.   at the end of the week Rest 24hrs , now go for that total exhaustion number again.... it should have doubled.  now put a routine together that works upper body and ABS on separate days as the Cardio that you are doing already.  Hopefully you have a training partner, if not its OK.   I started working out alone during lunch and had people laugh at me when I went out the door, literally in conversation I simply asked  when are you going to come with me? they would decline, and that stopped them from being critical and now they ask how far did you go today?  Oh yea there are four of us doing the cardio thing from one group now.    You have three months so any change is an improvement and everyone will notice.    Good Luck, hope you stay Happy Healthy and Wise.|`|TuOp3hNPaa	go till  failure. do them till u cant do any more. this will get u the fastest results.  an do them everyother day|`|yagl1sOcaa	as many as you can|`|8Rq20myeaa	The cool thing about pushups is that you can never do too many. I was under the impression that I would hurt myself doing them, but after going through basic training, you realize that pushups are awesome! Just do 2 or 3 sets a day (No exact number you need on each set, just go until you hit muscle failure). I do, on average, 8-12 sets a day (Again, Muscle Failure) everyday. At first, you might be a little sore, but after a week or two, it just becomes repitition. SIt ups you can do just one set, until you can't bring yourself up anymore. You'll see results in about a week.|`|b1R1bpKTaa	what i do is i have a number in mind of how many pushups or situps i want to do. then i start working out without worrying about counting. when i start to feel the burn from working out is when i start to count. this makes u push urself to meet ur goal or even go past it. it also ensures that u get a good workout each time. also, there are many different kinds of pushups and situps that work different muscle groups and this also helps to get a good workout. make sure u drink plenty and give urself ample time to rest between workouts
jgRRsG8Daa	Especially when someone loses his/her nearest and dearest loved ones and is also obliged to face or feel the monetary pinch,then he/she  instinctively develops a sense of preservation and survival against very  tough odds.The mind then becomes sharp irrespective of lack of even basic education.If one has had a good education,that person is better   equipped to deal with and face life's complex problems.They become very inventive and innovative so much so that they are able to face the world with aplomb and equanimity.The lesser educated or uneducated   too are,within their limited capacities,generally able to overcome their  problems and continue their struggle with confidence.So you see,it is all a question of one's capacity to withstand pressures and the will to   survive.If one throws in the towel right at the outset by being overawed  even by the thought of how to cope,then one becomes not only a wreck  mentally but even physically prone to all ailments and diseases and infections.  As for the case of the two brothers that you cite,it is  a simple case of one brother being diligent with a will to succeed in life and make something of himself while the other would be a wastrel or a profligate    thinking only of himself with nary a thought for others or even for his  bleak future.He would be the classic hedonist who would not even find time to repent but end up in the gutters when the family wealth runs out.|`|xl3G0SeMaa	It depends of the experiences that they lived and what they learned with them|`|4f46a3ab367e69b76b30e6290112ed68aa	People are all different.

It is amazing how something so simple could cause so much pain.  Make sure you find a good one though.  I've been to a couple of them and some aren't very good.  I would at least give it a try.  May not be the answer but then again it could be.  I kept going to my dr. because the left side of my left hand would go numb.  Just a pinched nerve they kept saying for years.

I worked out that they are stress related. Try and clear your mind or think only nice things as you are falling asleep.|`|sI3BVNlFaa	Its called sleep paralysis and is quite natural, although not many people experience it.  Don't worry about it, the only harm it does is the fear it causes to people who have never had it before and think something serious might be wrong.    When you are in a deep sleep your body is effectively unlinked from the brain (this is when stops people acting out their dreams) and the limbs are 'paralysed'.  If suddenly awoken sometimes the body still hasn't caught up yet and thinks it is still in REM sleep.  Even if you try to move you can't for a few seconds.|`|kEZP3BmBaa	I'm sorry you died    But at least your alive right now!|`|tmL3zyVyaa	It could have been sleep paralysis.|`|uJKTR4d2aa	Edward cullen parlyzed you      Its called sleep paralysis.

4eTyCuRSaa	First thing I would examine is your diet and other activities you may be involved in.    Do you eat healthy or have you been hitting the fatty fast foods?  Do you smoke?  This tends to cause weaker erections.  Have you started drinking or drinking to much, this could add to the problem.  How often do you have sex?  Recovery time is important.  Have you used any drugs like meth.  A definate woody killer!  And of course stress can add to the overall problem.|`|satoCRC6aa	normal problem for guys. Exercises , eat right and get some sleep.

b959c1bacc75d8acf50a00e99fc88981aa	Your belly probably has less fat on it than you think.    Untrained muscle is soft and floppy, and feels just like fat. The muscles around your belly keep your waist tight and slender, IF they are trained (they also help your digestion, by compressing your intestines). But weak waist muscles will allow your innerds to bulge outwards, so that a lot of people think that they have a lot more fat around their waist than they really do.    Situps, leg lifts and crunches won't help. These exercises concentrate the effort on a superficial layer of muscle (Rectus Ab) at the front of your abdomen. Making this muscle hard and lumpy can look good (producing a 'six pack' effect), but it won't reduce a bulging belly or slim your waist.    To make your waist and belly smaller, you need to exercise your waist in many different directions (especially twisting from side to side), and in a variety of different positions (especially with your torso upright).    Capoeira, Belly dance, Kayaking, and Hula Hooping are excellent activities for improving the tightness and flexibility of your waist muscles. This will help you to move and breathe better as well as improving your digestion and your figure.|`|5n4yIcCTaa	Crunches, leg lifts, jack knifes, there are tons of exercises...|`|YlLdIPRvaa	Cardio, sit ups and weights.  You should not lose weight if you strength train and tighten up your core.  But you will look good!|`|ItJzrvQ4aa	jogging is an excellent exercise because it let you lose weight  evenly throughout your whole body. If you want to lose weight in  specific areas, you should target them with exercises. If they are  your problem areas, they will be very difficult to tone. You will have  to work double on them. The best approach is this:  1. Lower/control your daily calorie intake (control for normal  weight, lower for overweight).  2. Run/jog to lower your overall body fat percentage.  3. Target your problem areas with exercises.  an  excellent  exercise,  you  can do it in front of your TV: sit on a  stool,  and  put  your toes under something (piece of heavy furniture,  for  example). In your hands hold a little dumbbell. Please, make sure  that  it  is  not very heavy, start with one kilo, for example, or you  will  damage  your  back and spine! Slowly move the upper part of your  body  back, until it's parallel with the ground. Stop for a second and  move it back to the sitting position. Repeat ten times. Every week add  to  the  number  of  repetitions.  You will see the results in a week,  guaranteed! You will see or feel under the fat - if you have any - six  pack  and  muscles.  Dumbbells  do  wonders.  Much  better  than these  crunches  -  I  came  up to three hundreds and there was no results AT  ALL. With the dumbbells you will see it in a week.|`|8Rq20myeaa	Jogging is the universal answer. It will burn fat on all parts of your body, and tone your thighs/butt. If you combine that with crunches or situps, you'll have the sexy body you want in no time!|`|IrNUeRNaaa	You have to work on your abdominals area, sit-ups would work, and try to be consistent everyday|`|GHRXKrXAaa	How to Lose Belly Fat    1. Understand the risks associated with belly fat. Belly fat is linked with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer. Specifically it's the deepest layer of belly fat--the fat you can't see or grab--that poses health risks. That's because these "visceral" fat cells actually produce hormones and other substances that can affect your health (e.g. increased insulin resistance and/or breast cancer risk). The fact that they're located right next to and in between organs in your abdominal cavity doesn't help. For example, fat next to the liver drains into it, causing a fatty liver, which is a risk factor for insulin resistance, setting the stage for Type 2 diabetes.    2. Wrap a tape measure around your waist at the level of your navel. If you're a person of healthy weight, a measurement of more than 35 inches (women) and 40 inches (men) is considered to be unhealthy    3. Exercise for weight loss. Aerobic exercise will facilitate fat loss all over your body, including your belly. You can't "spot-burn" belly fat, but it's usually the first to burn off when you exercise, regardless of your body shape.[3][1] Just be sure that you focus on calorie-burning exercises, rather than sit-ups or crunches. If your abdominal muscles are covered in fat, no strengthening of those muscles is going to change that. Aerobic exercise is key.  ..........An additional benefit is that exercise reduces stress and insulin levels, which reduces the presence of cortisol, a hormone that leads to more belly fat deposits    4. Change your diet. Unless you restrict your calorie intake, you're not going to lose belly fat. There are some tactics that might help do away with belly fat faster, but only when you've already consistently restricted your calorie intake. For example, eating an avocado after eating an entire bag of chips isn't going to help you get rid of belly fat--in fact, it'll probably make the problem worse!  .........Switch out refined grains for whole grains. In a scientific study, people who ate all whole grains (in addition to five servings of fruits and vegetables, three servings of low-fat dairy, and two servings of lean meat, fish, or poultry) lost more belly fat than another group that ate the same diet, but with all refined grains. A diet rich in whole grains changes the glucose and insulin response in your body, which hastens the melting of fat, and visceral fat, that deep layer of fat, is easier for your body to burn than the subcutaneous fat under your skin (the fat that you can see and grab)  ..........Studies suggests that a diet with a higher ratio of monounsaturated fats (avocados, nuts, seeds, soybeans, chocolate) can prevent the accumulation of both types of belly fat. Some experts argue, though, that it's not that these fats specifically target abdominal fat in any way; it's that anyone will probably lose weight on a lower calorie diet (regardless of where those calories come from) and as discussed earlier, belly fat is usually the first to go.   ............Trans fats (in margarines, crackers, cookies--anything made with partially hydrogenated oils) seem to result in more fat being deposited in the abdomen, so avoid these as much as you can.   ...........Soluble fiber (apples, oats, cherries) lowers insulin levels, which, as mentioned earlier, can reduce the presence of cortisol in the stomach    SURE HOPE THIS HELPED
AHk1r9wbaa	Yeah man that's totally normal.. You can do pushups everyday, but they require rest in between if you bust out your max, til failure.    If you wanna see how many you can do at once time, rest a few days.. your muscles do get tired even though they don't feel that bad the next day, they still need some recuperation time.    If you don't wanna experience all the fatigue, I'd try doing pushups in written sets/reps.. like 10 sets of 30 this day.. and 5 sets of 40 on another day.. or something.. then a few days rest where you do maybe a few pushups just so you don't feel lazy, and come back after you took a break and do how/e many until failure, it'll work a lot better than failure day in and day out.    You could probably get around 60-65 if you rest, 57 ain't bad by no means.. nice. Keep up the good work brother|`|gScUXaOEaa	Try saving energy and buy weights lift about 5-10 1/2 pounds about 15 lifts a day.

STjduXgfaa	It would take at least 3 months to loose 20 kg = 40lbs. My hubby used to weigh 117kgs and lost 30kgs drastically in 4 months no kidding!.Everybody who saw him lately doesn't recognize him at all ! He now weighs about 83 kgs and wears size 33 pants down from size 40 !    He just avoided eating food with carbs ( carbohydrates stuff mainly like pasta, rice, noodles, bread & potatoes ) and got more lean meat / fish in his diet. He didn't drink any beer or any drinks laced with carbs ( wine included... tsk-tsk ) for 4 months drinking mainly soda water . plain water or coke zero. Plus he went on a strict exercise schedule of 45 mins in the morning by either running or swimming and 45 mins at least on the threadmill in the evening every single day. If you are serious about losing 40 lbs I suggest you try what he did ... eat no carbs and exercise everyday ... it 's a matter of self discipline so if you stick to the rules , you'll be on your way to loosing those unwanted lbs. ... so goodluck !|`|iUwyd7o5aa	well since your 148 not bein sure how tall you are ... loosin that amount of wiegh will take long just because your prob not that fat youll prob lose about 10 in 2 weeks and the rest will take long because when theirs not alot of fat to lose it would take long get real skinny|`|XHnpraaxaa	No matter what diet program you go on and no matter how much you pay they are all really the same.

Because honestly, that is what will help you maintain a smaller figure and maybe even lose a couple pounds. 148 is nothing when you could be at 183 or even more. :) Plus, when people weigh 100lbs, they just don't look healthy...

Busca una piedra, de buen tama?o, mas o menos que te puedas sentar, y que tenga como un angulo  picudito que sobresalga,hay que ponerla al sol a que se caliente, mojas un algodn con alcohol y lo aplicas directamente a la  bolsa que sientes en el ano y te sientas en la piedra caliente, en la parte picudita colocada en el ano lo ms que aguantes.. Al instante sentirs  como toda la parte baja se sube. Reposa y ya.  No tienes que volver a hacerlo. Santo remedio.  Claro, lavas bien la piedra antes.Espero te sirva|`|ZIpx2sxyaa	Luego que el medico te a detectado hemorroides puedes ver lo siguiente en   http://www.tiensperu.com/  http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=...

Perch, se non vai in bagno in quel momento, vedrai che riuscirai a resistere, finch non ce ne sar proprio bisogno.

Nel frattempo, mi sono diplomata Naturopata, e ho preso in mano la situazione. Utilizzo tecniche terapeutiche di equilibrio psicosomatico quali floriterapia, oligoterapia, aromaterapia, massaggi, con risultati soddisfacenti. Cerco anche di seguire un'alimentazione equilibrata. Ormai, so che se bevo alcolici, caff, oppure se mi espongo al freddo, elementi soppressori dell'ADH (ormone antidiuretico), il fenomeno si esaspera, altrimenti  gestibilissimo.  Auguri

rtx7GUCdaa	My gynocologist advised me that often times a period out of cycle with heavy bleeding or clotting is often a sign of a very early miscarriage. He told me that it happens to many women and they don't even know it. No need to feel guilty though, he says the embryo never really forms and that is why the body gets rid of it. You may want to see your Dr. if your next period is heavy with clotting. That could be a sign your body hasn't gotten rid of everything it needs to.|`|60Sc6zP3aa	mabey im not sure|`|4BsLom1yaa	nope. not a chance|`|cri0DxM4aa	If you have bleeding, then you're not pregnant... sorry.|`|y8F8JZAVaa	i dont think your pregnant your body must just be changing because that is a lot to endure on your body 38 days of your period|`|0a0a4d74d7f2f7b6fb7a2b9d67428c9daa	nope better luck next time

I got pregnant a few months after and only gained 16 pounds my whole 9 months... after i Had my baby i was 50 pounds lighter.  I was nauseated though...AGAIN.  Nothing like feeling like this for a straight freakin year...lol  But now.... I'm feeling better and eating more... and not being as careful as to what foods i'm eating.   I've gained 15 of that back...haha  Maybe it's because we feel better.  We eat more....it's easy to do.

iizKx4Bvaa	Sometimes in your position the anxiety due to your having to perform can be an issue. Tell her to try doing kegels to tighten the walls of her vagina  and you should try some pc muscle excercises to be able to control your ejaculation. Try some tantra techniques or look into taoist sex techniques.  there might be several factors contributing to your situation. You didn't mention if when he "takes matters into his own hands" you provide additional stimulation . For instance to his legs, testicles, perenium etc. You should discuss this with him but at a time other than during sex. it is quite posible he achieves orgasm easier and with more intensity while maturbating and with your assistance. Aside from being erotic it is considerable less strenuous. Quite frankly shortness of breath or muscle fatigue may be inhibiting ejaculation during intercourse. Try increasing foreplay to get him closer to climax before intercourse. Try running your nails on his knees or reaching under to touch perenium. Possibly even add verbal stimulation and encouragement. If a guy sense he is on the clock ,lets say that might delay orgasm. do some genital excercises too. Most of all relax. Your brain is a tricky thing. Relax.|`|dBoC8fR2aa	It very simple to solve. Get your wife to masturbate you till it almost going to ejaculate then have intercourse. Did you use this method already.

RGvNRH8Iaa	My mom has them too.  She is 45; her sisters are around 10 yrs older than she is and they dont have them.  Its because she used to spend a  lot of time in the sun and they didnt; that is what causes age spots--they are not caused by stress.    And yes I would say its normal for her to be emotional; a hysterectomy is a very major surgery so the emotional and physical stress from what she just went through is probably still affecting her, not to mention what it does to a womans hormones.  If she seems depressed for an extended period of time though, encourage her to talk to her doctor about it.      PS--Sounds like your mom is very lucky to have you :)|`|5FhRoNVUaa	my mom's 40 and she doesn't have aging spot.  some of my friend's think she's hot.  she probaby is getting aging spots because   she stresses out 2 much.  idk what hysterectomy sry.|`|MenTTJ8zaa	everyone ages differently      and if thats you in your picture, your mom has every right to be stressed. your freakin hot, you must guys over at your place all the time. =p|`|63899b8a7193738547e937e28a651057aa	Yes people usually get emotional and depress at times after surgery, so try not to stress her out.  Age spots are caused by sun damage.|`|U2KdP1y7aa	Some age spots are just freckles and the  hysterectomy can cause imbalances in hormones. She is basically going through menopause a little earlier than normal because of surgery. Age spots are also caused by to much sun exposure when she was younger. I'm 48, and getting older is just the norm and as we say; it's a ***** getting older.|`|5Ioe0GE8aa	People grow old and differently, no one wants their parents to age but it's life.|`|7oF2o4q5aa	Age spots are really from sun exposure.  There are plenty of face creams that can make them lighter.  Yes, a hysterectomy can make one more emotional, especially if they took the ovaries which provides the hormones.  It's kind of like PMS.  Her hormones will be off for a while.  If they didn't take the ovaries, it is still kind of tough as some women feel they are no longer "a woman", which of course is not true.    A little friendly advice???  DON'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT HER AGE SPOTS RIGHT NOW!!!!!|`|ae2d2c69dd32c072dbe6fd640d2db003aa	Age spots come from too much sun when you are young. There are creams that really work to fade age spots. You didn't cause it. Sometimes after a hysterectomy it can force you into a type of menopause. It can be a hard time for both of you. What I suggest to you is that you give her less stress and show her more love. You are lucky that you are able to recognize just how much you love and need your mother. Best wishes.

BFXOBS0Daa	I took breast enlargement pills from BellasPM and I grew from a small B to a full C in about 6 months. The pills have pueraria mirifica herb in it and you only take it half the month then you take a 15 day break to allow your period to run its course. They also have a serum that you massage on once a day that has pueraria in it too and it absorbs into the breasts. The massage is supposed to be good for increasing blood-flow and promoting growth.     The pills and serum worked fine for me but it took awhile to grow to a full C. I tried other pills like Bloussant and GroBust and after spending $$$ I got no growth at all so Bellas was totally worth it for me. My boobs seem fuller and rounder (wider) and I really like my new size. I feel so much better 'coz here in Florida it is almost always bikini weather. :D  I hope that helps you. Good luck!|`|yNU2MiTFaa	This sounds liek the greatest invention ever lol
fl4aUHitaa	Coming from a woman who is 22 years old and has never had a regular period, I can guarantee you are fine. It is normal for someone at your age to even skip your period completely for a month or two. Your body is still changing which means your hormones are still out of whack so it could take even a few more years to get on a definite cycle. Stress can also keep your period from coming. Athletes are also more likely to miss their period. As long as you aren't feeling any unusual pain or discomfort then you are fine.|`|JiENP5H4aa	yes you wont regulate until your just about done growing

And both of you together getting closer and it goes in your vigina and their he can start kissing you and then so onn basically i agree with the one above me and he's funny     hit me up some times if you want you want to know more
BKr3y30maa	I am on Weight Watchers and have lost 60 lbs in 10 months. That's what I would recommend to you just because you don't have to give up all foods, just have to learn about portion control.  Definetly exercise at least 3-4 times a week for a minimum of 30 minutes. Good luck with whatever choice you make!|`|MOWFjKIjaa	You could try taking that hydroxycut fat burner.  Besides that, you can will need to do Cardio. If you dont go to the gym, run a mile or two everyday. Also, cut down on your diet and eat around 1600-1800 calories a day. Not snacking will also help. Eat right(healthy) and stay away from junk food and fast food.    But basically, two most important things in weight lose are Diet and Cardio.    Goodluck|`|UCq4Ap5Eaa	acai berry is a lie...dr.Oz was never on oprah endorsing this product or anything..it is a scam and do not fall for it.  you really want to lose weight?  eat right and excercise.  no more than 1200-1500 cals a day.  at least 30 minutes of cardio a day.
uueuW6IHaa	Order some dominoes, and do sit ups till it gets there. It worked in that one commercial...|`|1nIeHzofaa	If it were that easy don't you think everyone at the pool in the gym would have six pack abs?  75% of it is a healthy diet of low fat foods and almost no saturated fat, whole grains, low fat protein (fish, chicken, yogurt, soy, beans) and a lot of fruits and vegetables.  Then do push ups while keeping you stomach flexed, pull  ups and chin up while keeping your legs out straigt, and sit ups.|`|TNdFsJw8aa	Paint them on.  LOL  I have started to eat smart and do a variety of sit-ups.  It's really working yeah.|`|8rMgQv15aa	Eat right do some cardio and bust out a ton of ab workouts every day. you'll see results in no time.
yjWwRMT0aa	The dreams that happen during nocturnal emission are not always sexual, but they usually involve the penis in some way, like a boy is playing with a girl or leapfrogging her.  He ejaculates at the moment in his dream when his penis touches the girl. You can learn more about wet dreams at the link below.|`|LHh7WX2Maa	idk. if u wanna have sex dreams, think about it right before you go to sleep.|`|72TYyMsEaa	Jerk off before you go sleep and the damn dreams wont come anymore.|`|6gLSicSaaa	you prob dont remember, just like u may not remember normal dreams but obviously ifu wake up to a mess u know it happened,|`|E64juLwJaa	Most people do not remember their dreams at all.  So who knows what triggered you to get a wet dream?  Planets.|`|u8CFwtyMaa	You can't always remember what you dream about, so you could be having a sex dream, and just don't remember it.  Whenever I had a wet dream, I never remembered a sex dream, but always remember the feeling of something being forced through a tube that was too small. I still don't fully understand that myself.  Hope this helps|`|3wFt9fyZaa	cause your stoned and dont remember....|`|5e1d217c8c231120f789426cabdc7d33aa	that is what you think you have about 10 to 15 dreams a night just because you can't remember them doesn't mean you didn't have em|`|gW2PJRONaa	idk but i had a dream i was banging kate beckinsale and when i woke up there was a mess everywhere lol
pjYQhPPBaa	I would say the 65 g of fat should be limited to saturated and/or trans fat. Why limit omega-3 fatty acids, polyunsaturated and unsaturated fat when it is beneficial to your body?
2facaa92a7738bf74922d878ba7e3647aa	Almost everyone knows that loosing weight is about changing your eating habits to a considerable extent. What many people don't realize is that this cannot just be done overnight! If you try to make drastic changes in your diet too quickly, chances are that you will only be frustrated and disappointed with your loosing that belly fat.    Also, there is more to weight loss than just diet and exercise. In this article I will give two great Tips on How to Get Rid of Belly Fat.     1. Avoid self-sabotaging train of thoughts: Self-sabotaging thoughts will do you more harm than think. Just imagine, if you always think that you cannot do the things you need to do in order to lose weight, how can you ever loose that belly fat? If you think that you cannot do sit-ups and push-ups, you are probably jumping to conclusions and being too overly self-crital even before you have tried any exercises! If you think that doing thirty push-ups is too much for you, then start small. Start with 10-15 push-ups, and thank yourself once you have done it successfully! Then try to add one or two extra push-ups every day to your routine until you reach your target of thirty.     You see, when you start small, it becomes much easier to reach your goals! Instead of thinking too much about it, just take action and DO it! The amount of time you spend on thinking and criticizing yourself, you may as well as spend it on some exercise. While the former will do you no good, the latter will help you burn fat and loose that belly fat fast!     2. Get help & support: Proper support is important in order to keep you on point and motivated. Without support, you won't be able to lose weight successfully. That is why it is essential that you enlist the support of your friends and family who understand you and support your goals. It is also essential that you choose a weight loss program which offers support to its members in the form of a support group or forum. In a forum, you will get support and tips from your peers and experts alike! Surround yourself with supportive people and stay away from the negative people who can only find faults with you!     If you follow these Tips on How to Get Rid of Belly Fat there is no reason why you won't be able to lose that belly fat! Remember that you can achieve whatever you believe or think in your mind. If you believe you can loose belly fat fast, then you WILL! I know that this sounds very much like The Secret and The Law of Attraction but it is very true!|`|iTtMQud1aa	Congratulations,80 lbs is huge i don't know what you weighed before or what your goal is i lost 60lbs and wanted to know what i had to do to keep it off,but still wanted to go out on the town and enjoy eating with family and friends.I found the answer i needed and would like to turn you on to this information,it could gross you out but boy what i didn't know but im glad i do now.

They have loads of free articles and information.  Check them out..
WXpdkbG8aa	I'm sure you'd be allowed. They may have you speak with a counselor before hand to be sure the decision you're making is best for you, and that you're certain of it. That's a really awesome decision though. :) I commend you deciding to help someone in need. You will save a life and that's incredible. Good luck!!!|`|e158WyFGaa	Yes.you will be fine.      you will be a little sore|`|FcNOkHquaa	Probably with parental consent.  And i think you could die in this process.    /m|`|w9Yqi10kaa	There's always a risk, no matter how old you are.|`|jgtfWjE4aa	you would have to ask a doctor and make sure you're healthy enough to.    by the way, you're an angel :)   sweet girl.|`|1hciyvKdaa	If your other kidney fails you may die if no donor is found. It would depend on the laws where you live after you recieved your parents permission.|`|xyJVGCulaa	Yea, you can.|`|LPuqI70jaa	ya i think so if ur parrent/guardian gives u permission and or comes with u..|`|JrysfTCNaa	if you want to suree?|`|ImiSyO23aa	you will die without ur kindey|`|Phd9irMmaa	u cant eat anything too salty   u cant hold and not go directly to the washroom  u can have problems with pregnancy  ask ur doctor   and search it up on the internet|`|CUBKOchYaa	You can with parental consent|`|AA11599430	you need to consult your family doctor and ultimately that decision is your parents since your a minor|`|nJVdEGjVaa	you can but its a risk you can take you should probaly ask your gardian,if they say no tell them its for a great cause
oEGbJNOeaa	maybe go to a calorie calculator website and join for free and add your weight and height and age and type in how long you did the exercise ..and it will tell you.    since we do know how hard you worked out , how long, and your weight, we cannot answer this question accurately. sorry (:|`|kYqkCwSNaa	it depends on how much you weigh and what your height is   a great website where i get lots of great info is     http://caloriecount.about.com/cc/calorie...  or   http://www.healthstatus.com/calculate/cb...    there are many others but these are good too!    tip- a great way to control food cravings is by drinking lots of water and chewing gum...its my secret weapon!
wbWqboTaaa	I'm not sure what you have, but it's obviously not good to sit in bed and wait to see what happens. I suggest you go see a doctor before it gets worse. Also you can look up the symptoms online and see what you get. That could hopefully help.|`|gfhN4CXBaa	maybe stress/anxiety see a Dr. and find out|`|e04025e23b950e2f3fe00c64e34a3bf1aa	see a Dr.
W0seY2K8aa	Playing basketball or jumping won't help.  There's a chance that you'll get another growth spurt in the next year or two.  Milk/calcium and a balanced diet can help, but your genetics will play a role too.|`|lBZRbQbqaa	umm no.... just be proud to be short|`|XWttyiWLaa	Exercise will not help you get bigger, but it will encourage the strenghtening of the bones.  I'm a shortie too... it sucks... but has some advantages too.    A doctor can give you growth hormone to give you a little boost to help you get to where you peers (same aged kids) are.      If interested, YOU MUST CONTACT A DOCTOR AS SOON AS POSSIBLE because they typically stop considering growth hormone for people after they reach age 16!!!    Here is a little information:  http://www.magicfoundation.org/www/docs/...    You have to see a doctor for this, however.  Lord, how I wish they had this when I was a kid.    You are not far below the growth trend, so you may have to see 3 different doctors before one will consider giving it to you, short term.    I'm only 5'7" and now in my 30s.  I wish I were taller, but I do consume much less food than others and can use my SUV as a comfortable "tent" when camping.  And I can ride in small asian-manufactured cars without any problems.  So, there are some hidden advantages, but still, I would RATHER be 5'11"
uC75y83Taa	You'll get the best and quickest results if you go to a psychiatrist.  Not because you're crazy!  (That's just an old stigma.)  Shrinks (easier to spell!) are the smartest doctors.  They go to school an extra 4 years, and they know the most about medications and putting the pieces of the puzzles of phobias together.    Don't even waste your time and money going to a family doctor.  A shrink will fix you right up. You'll see.    Bless you and good luck!  :)|`|AA11155768	There is medication to treat all things that cause anxiety. There are also treatments that don't involve medicine. I'm glad to see there's a name for this condition. I don't like seeing them either but they just make me cringe a little.     Good luck!
Mx33cku8aa	shaving will make the hair a bit more coarse, and possibly thicker. but it's really no guarantee. how your facial grows in depends on many more factors than simply shaving. look at the men in your family, especially brothers and those on your mother's side. their facial hair will be a better indicator as to how yours will be.|`|72ddVB2iaa	FUNNY!    I just heard a guy on the radio talking about this. It was on public radio. He said there have been many studies on this exact topic and that shaving doesn't do a thing to make hair grow faster. It's just a matter of time and hormones.     Do yourself a favor though.     DON'T EVER TRY TO GROW A MUSTACHE OR ANYTHING UNTIL IT GROWS IN COMPLETELY THICK!    It's an embarrassment to the entire male gender when you go out with a little soft mini-mustache!    GAK!    Words to live by!|`|72iZuDjeaa	no... i can't believe people think this,,, boggles my mind|`|bm1rsts7aa	Shaving causes all the hair to grow back at the same time, which does cause it to look thicker.|`|laXOkUD1aa	Just keep shaving. The more you shave the darker and thicker it grows in.|`|C9nOqOZKaa	eventually with age, your hair will be thick.  the more u shave the more prominent facial hair you will have.  But as you age, not right away as u shave once a week or so.|`|58DOHTmwaa	yes|`|gsQWS0tuaa	the more you shave the thicker it will get|`|moJcpqQ4aa	yes|`|EKnOkmrmaa	yes once you start shaving it gets thicker and thicker|`|kAEqC1Taaa	NO. Hair is thicker at the bottom, near the skin, than at the top. When you shave, hair appears thicker because the base is growing out. Eventually it thins out again. You cant make hair grow thicker. You just have to wait...|`|lF1LkLCTaa	Hormones dictate how thick your facial hair will get as well as the pattern of growth but shaving does help however I wouldn't expect to start on that beard until you are closer to 20. |`|dTZwemUBaa	*girls dont like mustaches*
KrQ4j0VXaa	you are right you started you period now you should get it every 27 days from the day that you start. Good luck.  Have a Happy Period always.|`|svZAe990aa	You may have your period, but depending on whether you strained going to the bathroom it could be rectal bleeding.  Do you have a grown up you could talk to? I know it may seem embarrassing if you do not have  a female to talk to, but trust me, dads understand that their kids get their periods too.  It may feel odd talking to a grown up at first, but you really need to do it.  If it is your period, welcome to the sisterhood.  It also means you can get pregnant, so think before you put yourself in a risky situation.  Someone needs to talk to you about the birds and the bees if you are not sure if you have youe period.  Not to be overly descriptive, but just so you know, your period can be bright red, brownish red, and chunky.  The chunks are the tissue that you are shedding. Don't be scared by it.  Find someone you trust to talk about it.  I know I would want my daughter to talk to me.  Hope this hepls.|`|S53fL5C1aa	maybe you did start your period.talk to your mom|`|lBHvvKkPaa	it's either ur period or u wiped 2 hard, use a panty liner 4 now and if its not gone later then congrats on ur peirod|`|nwewdFb6aa	you got your period.|`|9btcOpxXaa	your probably about to start a heavy flow. wait till the end of the day or a couple of days and ur period should come|`|aNKLCCUJaa	congrats enjoy the next 40 or so years|`|EncopDCmaa	Welcome to womanhood.     You started your first period~!|`|NOyxiZXqaa	you are now entering womanhood. Tell your mom (if shes home) My mom wasn't home when I got my period. I had to wear a dinosaur pad cause I couldn't find a different one. And that was all on my b-day! |`|OrlkRatGaa	You started. Woo. Haha. Use a panty liner, and tell your mom. Trust me..been there, done that. It'll seem scary at the time..but it's not. Just calmly tell her. |`|laXOkUD1aa	You started your period. Tell your mom and she'll help you.
JnEUAR2kaa	No I like mine...Well it's better than being flat chested..I was flat chested growing up and was always teased in elementary and highschool.  I did grow some when I got preg....and I haven't been talked about since then.  Learn to like what you have and work with them eveyone isn't made perfect.|`|laXOkUD1aa	I can't really take you seriously. Maybe you should learn real English and then you can worry about it. But i don't know. Big boobs are a plus for guys. |`|f47113d44e9a74a9d99bce1ab768ababaa	C cup is not bad especially is ur skinny, dont consider brest reduction until it gets over D, then it could be extreamly painful.|`|kmokuk3iaa	well its not a bad thing at all because some women wish they had a naturally large rack like ours. But just everything else in this world having large breast has its down falls. Don't worry its normal.|`|M9XgexhSaa	If you dont like it, drink a lot of coffee. This will help them shrink.|`|5soag6xyaa	depends i was a D when i was 15 ..im 20 and now i am a DDD and let me tell you back problems galore...im thinking about having a breast reduction done myself|`|rrlhskIUaa	no its sexi chica. los hombres le gusta los tetas grande
AA10478980	You do need to talk to a counselor and do a reality check.  Edward Cullen is not real.|`|MPX0f5jzaa	Let me guess, you're very very very very very very young.  You'll grow out of it, but no, it's totally not normal.|`|f7c5f574e4f1a6efb425246391dcb433aa	yeah your pretty much a freak glad im not Edward Cullen.|`|Lc2qdDLhaa	It's a damn book character! You serious need to    GET  A  LIFE!|`|laXOkUD1aa	You need to get over him.|`|ioMX4E4Taa	That's pathetic. You need to find yourself a boyfriend, and I'm not saying this to be mean. Once you become OBSESSED with a celebrity like that, you know it's time to get a boyfriend. Or go to the shrink.|`|LHaexjwpaa	Don't know if you're for real or not, but I would give these books to your momma and tell her to hide them. Then go get a job, volunteer and get some real friends.  Once you live for a while in the real world, then you may resume reading fiction, but I would stay away from Stephanie Meyers.|`|JmibPXTGaa	I used to be the same way with Harry Potter!  I know how you feel. Some day though you'll get over it even though it doesn't seem like it now.  You'll meet a real boy even better than Edward Cullen.  It's completely normal to have an infatuation with a book character. Don't worry about it. It's a phase and everyone goes through different phases.|`|r2bbLMUZaa	Get. A. Life.    Or just fall asleep to whatever media/whatever in which you find this edward cullen.     This is a childish crush, an obsession you will get over once you realise the room is too cold, or that you're out of Haagen Daz.|`|K8pdXxVeaa	if your thinking about him that much , try speaking to him , or asking him questions or tell him how you feel about it. but slowly , dont go straight into it. If he rejects you then try moving on to someone else , ( i know this is hard) . if you cant maybe tell him that your finding it hard without him. if he's nice then he will notice how you feel.   hope this helps babe x  xx  |`|COuY1g2Caa	Don't listen to what other people say. Almost everyone has a crush on a celebrity or someone from a book or something. I'm in love with Chase Craword!! About the crying though. Go to a psychyatrist about that. They can be a big help.|`|a9fRdIxLaa	Haha, I was so madly in love with the couple! They were just so cute together. I understand how you feel except for the crying part. o.O  I don't cry myself to sleep. Haven't cried for years.  Ah, back on topic, I suggest that you try to move on and read another book. You could re-read it, too. But if I were you, I would go out and find a boy that strikes you as someone who equals or surpasses Edward. If not, find someone who shares your extreme love for him and you too can express your feelings for a fictional character together.    You really just need to let your emotions go, is what I'm thinking.    Gee, I think that whole answer had a negative feel to it. I'm sorry, I didn't mean for it. I wanted a positive vibe. Sorry 8[|`|3VPuivZsaa	Try to occupy your mind on something else. It's the best thing to do. I used to have obsessions too, but i got over them, but mines were a real person. Try to go out and stop reading that series of books! Thats the best i can do.    GOOD LUCK!  |`|zwiWRlB2aa	That isn't very normal. Edward is not real, you have to remember that.    Maybe what you're crying for is a boy like Edward Cullen. And sorry, but there aren't many of those either. =] So, take a deep breath, clear away some of those teenage hormones, and wait for the right guy to come along. He won't be as perfect as Edward, but he'll still be insanely important to you.|`|l6XvHv4Uaa	Any who is edward cullen and why do you like him?|`|MSNVFxJjaa	I like the twilight series myself, but Edward Cullen isn't a real person. Go out and find a real boyfriend.|`|9dqZqyPbaa	Stop obsessing|`|5nRl3t74aa	wow dont think about him then|`|tttEpZAyaa	Look for other ppl. Find someone, someone real this time, and start crushing on them. In the movie he's not as dreamy as in the books. Just think of all of the bad things about "him."|`|UtRuxx7aaa	He's an imaginary character.  He's not real.  It's like crying over a jug of milk because it looks great to talk to, but it can't talk to you.  It's not worth it.|`|47K6Zloraa	ya, perfectly normal. keep doin what your doin, your dream will come true soon.|`|Jd4o7Og3aa	how old are you? why are u crying? Why cant u be with him? |`|3c30aa4263d27ab6160b3aeeb8b23303aa	thats a little bit extreme..just take a deep breathe and remember   edwards a fictional character    maybe focus on a real guy to distract you?|`|uoPeuKvKaa	well since he IS a book character, you obviously can't date him. But find someone who acquires his same characteristics (minus the whole vampire thing). |`|bed19efc1f301e9cdc2db3d861f85effaa	The concept of normalcy is only eclipsed in terror by your dissertation. |`|aTPlYPWSaa	You cry? Now that's just crazy. Get a boyfriend and forget about Edward.|`|CU4yNW5Daa	how old is he and u think about things like that like reasons you wouldnt be good for eachother and then think of someone else to crush on|`|xTEmBEBGaa	Start writing your own stories about the adventures of a guy that is way better than him.|`|AA11463505	HHHMMMM...Jus get a life  lol... or find someone that u can actually see everyday and start talkin to them and crate a relationship|`|nXaGxuV3aa	obsessive much|`|EOgmJIwEaa	um....i'm being honest with you.....that's not normal.|`|Sy3djTWTaa	He doesn't exist dumbass.  |`|Lgmp6bqsaa	you're weird|`|knvXQDvzaa	Grow up maybe?|`|r4CDvxmTaa	go find someone like him that is real
hXBDQUJ9aa	If not often, and you're working out REGULARLY, then no, you won't gain weight.|`|Dy7j7yRtaa	The extra calories and effect on your hormones will cause you to gain weight.|`|WaI693jHaa	No - it's just a few extra calories and chemicals and a few more trees chopped down to graze the cattle.|`|oojO4WAraa	No, you won't.|`|laXOkUD1aa	If those two times you eat fast food you get like 30 chicken nuggets and 3 large fries, then you'll start to gain weight. Plus if you work out then you will just burn off those extra calories in fast food.
AA11155768	Sounds as if the people you know have body image issues. You aren't fat and you shouldn't compare yourself to anyone else. Stay fit and stay away from those with body image issues. You do not want to start down the road to anorexia, bulimia, or overeating!|`|8bISKi4maa	no your fine|`|tdQ45dKNaa	omg shutup im 5'6 and 150 pounds |`|8DAkH4Vwaa	Ms. Sakura Uchiha.

AA10299912	My girlfriend had it done... no it's gone but it's going to hurt more then your usual periods and worse then normal periods after abortions because it was so late but don't worry u should be fine in a month or so...|`|AA11155768	Please edit your question. Your question is very difficult to understand. |`|l6XvHv4Uaa	Wait. What are you saying?
AmrtEi4Raa	girly, you can try talking to a gyno maybe they can prescribe something for you since you are allergic.|`|AA11155768	If you are allergic to lubricants, you could have other skin allergies, too. Also, it could be abrasions from hair. I've had that problem before and have to stay trimmed. |`|Qk0Utjc9aa	i have this issue from time to time, i can usually tell if it might be becoming a problem and when i get home i use baby powder. resort to the basics right, but hey it works. :)    as to the lube issue have u tried using one that was a water base rather then say an oil base?|`|ds5XtyCBaa	you may try some medicine or use natural items like mentioned http://optionbiotechonline.com/products/...    just have a look i think ur problem will be solved, |`|IGSlwhyzaa	If it is just a "rub burn" try putting diaper cream on it. Diaper cream will help cool and help with the irritation and pain. It also does not contain harsh chemical as it is made for babies.
Bptxl9g0aa	Ask your aunt, mother's sister, dad's sister or any other female in your family who has a job and earns money to buy you your first pack of tampons.  No need to go in to long explanations about the situation, simply go to this adult female and say, "oops, can you help, I need a pack of tampons fast".  Usually they do not query. Use the tampons and if you are comfortable with using them, tell your mother that you have been using tampons anyway and it is no big deal, so she will know to buy you some next time.  |`|Wi97GrVVaa	Just buy a box and hide them. Your mom is being ridiculous. Using a tampon isn't the same thing as having sex. If you can't convince her, just buy a box, or get a friend to buy a box for you.    Do you have an older female relative [preferably an adult] who could help you win this battle?|`|AA11155768	You may have to go to your doctor for help in fighting this battle. If your doctor sides with you, you may win the battle but be prepared in case your doctor decides it's not a good idea for you to use them. |`|Qk0Utjc9aa	my mother was the same way.  she is just not informed. get her information, show her that you have done your hw on this one.  Print out studies, show her, talk to her about it.  My mother knew nothing about them, there for she didn't want me to use them because she couldn't offer help and she didn't understand them.  You can get pamphlets at the doctors even have the doctor talk to your mother.  As long as you follow the directions, they are usually harmless. |`|S1Cjz9oyaa	Why don't you just go out and buy them yourselves? Your mom shouldn't have any say in what you want to use. As long as you know the bacterial risk with tampons it's okay. And there is no "too small" to handle tampons. Tampons are really small and very easy to insert. My nieces who are 13, 14 and 15 all use tampons and they're very skinny|`|CfZCd7snaa	just tell her that your pad sticks to you and irritates your skin. you like to have fun so explain to her beg her to let u wear them. its not that bad besides if u are in high school and for p.e u do swimming they require u to wear a tampon so use that too|`|73599901bc5bc81dcecb4c0222533fbcaa	I see that at slightly ridiculous that your mother isn't letting you use then.     Maybe, you can just sit her down, and explain this situation. she might let you use then for when you're in the pool, and then she then might be convinved to let you use them all the time.    Tamopn pros-   -They dont leave a line in pants or other tight clothing like pads do  -They are the same concept as a diaper, and you feel as if your just sitting in your own blood   -Pads might make you smell, where tampons do not  -Changing a tampon is less time consuming than changing your pad  -You can swim in them :)    Stay calm when you talk to her. Explain your reasons, and then listen to her when she explains yours. Even offer to go to the doctor to see what s/he has to say.    Hope this helps!    ~C|`|wOctW2ssaa	Be mature about it.  Sit down with her and explain to her that you would prefer to use tampons.  You are right about the slim tampons. As far as I know there is no regulation on Tampons that you have to be a certain weight to be able to use them.   I've got a few points that might help:    Many women prefer the use of tampons to pads because they find them to be much more comfortable and discrete than menstrual pads. - Pads can be quite embarrassing and bulky.     Explain that you know the risk of TSS, and are aware that you will need to change it at least every 8 hours. Pads usually need to be changed every four to six hours.    Tampons can be worn when swimming and playing many different sports.    Hope this helps.      |`|jdOGWRbgaa	I think your mom's just worried. You can always go swimming when you're not having your period can't you?....
DWKKkOM9aa	i can relate to your problem but i think its nothing bad because nothing really happened to me it just started on different times |`|AA11155768	First, stop freaking out! Stress is not going to make it better. There could be several reasons for your sudden irregularity. Has there been a change in your diet or exercise? Have you lost or gained weight? Have you started or stopped any prescriptions?    If you do find there is a problem, there is a lot of support available. I've had PCOS for over 15 years but it is treatable and I've made some friends in the process.    Good luck and God bless!
AA10178069	go to your doctor or gyno. It could be many things so go just to be safe.|`|BWmSvTZ0aa	See your OBGYN, it could be little leftover pieces of your cherry still getting popped, or it could be serious.|`|AA11155768	Are you on birth control and have you been taking it regularly? If you are and have not been taking it at the same time everyday without skipping any doses, it's possibly break through bleeding. It could also just mean the sex was a little rough or that it's almost time for your period. This is something you should ask your doctor during your next visit. No one here is qualified to answer that question. |`|S4bwflsLaa	The contractions caused by orgasms can cause spotting.

Have you changed your diet or medication recently. Are you on birth control? Have you been under more stress than normal?

Z7ILDphGaa	When I was 10 I went from 5'0" to about 5'3" and from 100 to around 130. Don't worry about it too much, some girls' bodies are prone to storing energy (aka fat) before growth spurts. I grew like 5" in a year and didn't gain much weight because my body was simply getting ready for that major spurt. (I'm 6'0" now, by the way. And female if that matters. :) )     Focus on eating right and exercising, I found that when I was 10 team sports were a really fun way to work out and enjoy the company of friends. People put way too much emphasis on girls' weight, if you eat healthily than your body is just doing what it needs to do to help you develop into an adult. :)|`|AA11155768	Please speak to your parents and doctor about this and don't listen to the insensitive people on this site.

AA11155768	You really should speak to a nurse at your school so that you can learn a lot more about sex education because you are so not ready for it. I hope that you decide to stop the intimate contacts altogether and find other things to do with your boyfriend that don't involve being alone...especially in a bedroom.

A delayed or missed menstruation is the most common pregnancy symptom leading a woman to test for pregnancy. When you become pregnant, your next period should be missed. Many women can bleed while they are pregnant, but typically the bleeding will be shorter or lighter than a normal period.     Swollen and tender breasts are actually another. Swollen or tender breasts is a pregnancy symptom which may begin as early as 1-2 weeks after conception. Women may notice changes in their breasts; they may be tender to the touch, sore, or swollen.     There are other symptoms as well, such as fatigue, nausea, backaches, headaches, frequent urination, and many food cravings. If you think you are pregnant, I suggest seeing a local doctor or specialist in that area. Good luck, and if you are, congrats on the baby! |`|qapjl7g4aa	If you had a true period you should not be pregnant!!  Go to your gyn MD. NO nipple discharge is normal!

Don't worry about it.  When you get a little older 18-20 you will be more mature and should then be able to get more intimate with a man.|`|AA11155768	There is nothing wrong with being scared. It just shows you aren't ready for sex! There is NO right age for being ready for sex, you'll know. And it could quite possibly be that you aren't ready until your wedding night. The longer you wait, the better it'll be!! Especially when it's with someone who loves you. Kudos for waiting and not being afraid to ask questions!|`|ePEEiFNtaa	do it when youre ready. don't do it cuz your friend(s) have. and wait a few years. 16 is tooooooooooooo young. |`|fIo1JXcuaa	Im 16 too and my advice is,don't worry about it if your scared obvouisly your not ready, don't do it unless you know you REALLY want to.  When you lose it it should feel RIGHT, plus you seem to have a wonderful guy who you've been dating for 2 years and yet he's not pressuring, just enjoy that and do it when you know your DEFFINALTY ready :)|`|7DPNxP8gaa	DO IT U ******* *****|`|vSRTEOCuaa	If you don't want to, then tell him.  He'll understand.  You're only 16, and no matter what your age, if you don't want to have sex, then you don't have to.  It's your body and your choice :)    I've never had sex either, but I've used tampons, and I've been fingered...and honestly, that doesn't hurt.  You'll feel something in there, but it shouldn't hurt.  A penis should be considerably larger than a tampon or a finger, but your vagina is meant to stretch (after all, babies come out of there), and while having sex for the first time often does hurt a little, on the whole it should feel good.  If it didn't feel good, no one would want to do it, and that wouldn't get the human race very far, would it? ;P    You shouldn't stress about it too much though, or you may actually make it hurt when really it shouldn't.  There's a condition called vaginismus, in which the vaginal muscles contract, making penetration painful or impossible.  Vaginismus can be caused simply by worrying too much that penetration will hurt; you worry it's going to hurt, your body becomes convinced of it, and when you try to put something in there, your muscles contract because they think it's going to hurt, and then it does hurt because everything is so tense.  Now, don't worry about this either; it's not meant to scare you, just making sure you know you shouldn't stress about it :)  Just try and relax, and maybe even try using a tampon next time you have your period, or just stick your finger up in there sometime and feel around a little.  Just be gentle, and get yourself used to it.  It'll be okay :)|`|1nAkF11Raa	Don't worry.    First of all, tampons don't hurt. You just need to relax when you put them in. Which is the same for sex, really...    If you want to have sex, experiment with yourself first. Masturbate, find out what turns you on. You can stick a finger up there, it won't hurt. 2 or even 3 fingers might feel strange, because it will stretch you, so go careful and start small. Relax Relax Relax.    You've probably heard that you need to be well lubricated when you have sex. This is true--it might hurt if you aren't. When you get turned on you will get wet, but in case you aren't wet enough it's good to have something on hand, like lubricant or even regular lotion is good.     Now, when you actually come to it, it probably will hurt, because most likely he will have to break your hymen. So yes there will be some pain, but you don't need to get freaked out about it. It won't be as bad as you probably think, and it is only the first time. Your first time won't be the greatest anyway, because everything is new so it's going to be awkward. Everything takes practice.    And as everyone always says, really only have sex if you want to. If you're not ready, there's plenty of other stuff you can do, like touching each other, oral, etc. And USE A CONDOM. if you don't know already.    So take it slow, relax, and be selfish!--do things that give you pleasure, not just pleasing him.

fk9AvB25aa	You need to talk to an adult that  you trust or a guidance counselor.  You need to take your friends advice and get tested for herpes, so you would know for sure if it's herpes, it may not be. By the way the test for herpes is not done in the routine std test you have to ask for it. You can go to Planned Parenthood, I have heard that they are very confidential about every thing. You should go while you still have the bump and the rash so they can accurately test you. You should really tell your mother. I know it's hard, telling people and getting diagnosed and out breaks are the worst part about having stds.  I have oral and genital herpes.

gjAZeRyfaa	There are alot of things that go into your weight, such as water,  muscle, and fat.  If you continue to eat well, just increase aerobic  exercise, such as running, biking or swimming.

A3jfhR80aa	First, there is no real way that one can be diagnosed over the internet. You need to see a physician asap. Sadly these are quite common signs of an STD. Usually with many bacterial sexually transmitted diseases or infections there there is a white or greenish soapy discharge and abnormal oder coming from the genitals. These can  also be significant of other non-bacterial infections as side-effects but it is much less common. Common bacterial infections include: chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis among others. As for the bumps, depending on their appearance they may be a number of things. Commonly open sores can resemble herpes most of the time. If the bumps are not irritated or sore and do not have any bleeding or discharge they could be genital warts HPV. Both are viral STD's and are incurable. Some milder strains of HPV have been found to be transmissible  or a-symptomatic but most forms will stay in the skin cells indefinitely.         From the sound of your symptoms you may have syphilis. There are three stages of progression. In the first stage there are initially sores called canchres. The bacteria progresses into the second stage and begins to present other symptoms such as fever, sore throat and patchy hair loss among others. In the third stage or the latent stage the symptoms begin to disappear. This is the most dangerous stage because it can begin to damage other parts of your body such as your  internal organs, including the brain, nerves, eyes, heart, blood vessels, liver, bones, and joints. This link should be helpful:  http://www.cdc.gov/std/syphilis/STDFact-...    YOU NEED TO GET TREATMENT FOR THIS IMMEDIATELY.  SEE A DOCTOR AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.   I AM NOT A PHYSICIAN AND YOU NEED TO BE SEEN BY ONE IMMEDIATELY  |`|rSNejsfvaa	well your hair falling out shouldnt have anything to do with it but the odor and bumps might me hpv usually you get tested with a blood sample urine why dont you go to a clinic and the bad odor comes from the discharge there is different colors of discharge you might have chlamydia you should get check|`|fZ32cQmwaa	go to webmd.com and you can check you're symptom's there.|`|AA11251265	it's possible that it's nothing. sometimes bumps can be ingrown hairs or just clogged pores, and is quite common at your age, for them to happen every once in awhile, (when i was your age i got one every couple of months) and the odor could just also have to do with puberty. same with the discharge. i am concerned about your hair falling out though. this could be unrelated but it could be a serious problem.     you must go to the doctor. if your mom won't take you in for this, wait till you go in for something else, (or make up some reason to go right now) and just mention it to your doctor that you are very concerned. or, depending upon where you live, try to get into a planned parenthood. you should be able to get in at any age, with out a parent and free of charge or little charge.    best of luck and i'm so sorry this had to happen to you. even if you have to tell a school nurse, you need to tell someone. maybe even a guidance counselor.|`|qeBTNlIUaa	Oh my god, I hope your kidding.  That is horrible, you need to go to a doctor ASAP!  I can't believe your mother knew about this and didn't do anything.  If you don't feel like you can go to the Doctor on your own try asking a teacher or counselor at school for help.  You definitely have signs of a STD so take care of this fast.|`|AA11155768	Those could be signs of several things. If your mother won't take you to a doctor to get checked out, you need to confide in another (more responsible) adult such as a trusted teacher, counselor, aunt, etc. Either way, you must tell someone about the assualt, whether or not your mother will get in trouble. It's important for you to come to terms with it.    Self-diagnosing can lead to a lot of unnecessary worry and make things worse.    God bless!|`|PsA4nRk0aa	You should go to the nearest County Public Health Dept., they would see you for free or to the nearest hospital and get some help b/c it sounds like you have a STD. Im sorry that had to happen to you and your mom isn't helping.|`|DP0AjzJ2aa	That is so horrible!  What happened to you was illegal and the jerk should have been put in jail.  The bumps could be a number of things.  This discharge is definitely a sign of something.  It could be syphilis but without a proper diagnosis it could be anything.  Please go and see your school nurse.  She should be able to help you out.  Also, any free clinic or major hospital can help you.  If you have to, go to the emergency room.  They can treat you quickly.  
z0HWA6vRaa	umm its completly natural and ur hair doesnt fall out because of cancer, the chemo therapy makes your hair fall out....theres also a allergy to hair called alopecia arieta wich basically means all your hair falls out |`|cASB8Sh3aa	It can be a number of things that cause this.  Hormone imbalances, thyroid conditions, uncontrolled diabetes, infections or lupus.  Check with your doctor.  Cancer patients usually lose hair due to chemotherapy, not the cancer itself.|`|AA11155768	Hair loss is not a symptom of cancer but is a result of the treatments (chemotherapy) for cancer.|`|tkC04c5xaa	yup, sarah is right. One of the side effects of chemotherapy is alopecia, or hair loss. Some cancer meds attack cells that grow or divide including the bone marrow, the cells that responsible for your hair, etc. Another example, since i mentioned bone marrow, most cancer meds suppress the bone marrow thats why people who take these meds are risk for infection.|`|b5278795de772832ea8fb4db71b4866eaa	the most that u could lose is ten a day... it dosent have to be cancer.. it could be stress   new shampoo   change in ur diet   medicine   drugs   so  dont think as cancer as the first thing   good luck   go and see a doctor|`|3dfReEElaa	Seems a little too more,but don't worry,if you don't have the sign listed in www.kungfucancer.com,you be fine

oojO4WAraa	Suggest that he go to the doctor.  Night sweats can be a bad sign.  Have him go get checked out.|`|jge0vqkLaa	Yes i do agree to go to the Dr. for the night sweats. But as far as the sheets being dirty because of it, yes that is normal. Its because the human body is constantly shedding your skin. That's why dust is made up of 80% human dander. And when he does sweat it causes his skin to get wet and rub off onto the sheet when he moves. My dad was a construction worker for 24 years and counting and he has the same sweat issue. But only during the summer time when his body gets to hot that day.|`|dniMLHETaa	I agree with the first answer, go to a doctor.  Look on BestofUS.com to find a good doctor in your city.  Also does he drink alcohol in the evening this could be the cause of the sweats.

213Tajn3aa	just drink beer|`|YtfmC2lDaa	Your body prioritizes where it stores weight so there's not real way to put it where you want, same way there's no way to take it off from exactly where you want.  Women usually store weight from the hips down then it goes elsewhere (depends more on genetics)     If you tend to store it in your legs first, then stomach, then chest if you started to try and lose that it's going to work backwards.  Chest then stomach then legs.  Really that's a total generalization, everyone's different.|`|NPhepcBkaa	Just eat a lot more high carb and fat foods. Targeted weight loss and gain is pretty much impossible so you'll gain weight in other places as well, but 7 stone is very thin so you can afford to do this!

efYQvJXLaa	When you lose weight it is lost equally.  Because faces are a smaller body part your weight loss will be noticed there.    You face shape is what it is.  A round face and a thin body is a sign of youthful good health.  Many emphasize that full face look with blush makeup in the center of the cheeks.|`|YKeF3FyBaa	I want to tell this to EVERYONE:  I tried this program and lost all the baby weight,  I am 20 lbs lighter than I was BEFORE I even got pregnant  It's guaranteed  and i swear it works  give it a try  http://www.turnoffthefatgenes.com/?hop=j...  i lost it everywhere  including the face and neck|`|hXGi9Wehaa	It's technically impossible to target a specific area for weight loss, but when you do lose, you usually see facial results first. just follow this seven-step plan that concentrates on eliminating water weight gain (which can account for up to five pounds) and helps you begin a simple overall weight-loss strategy.    1.Drink at least nine 8-ounce glasses of water a day.     2.Eat at least three servings of fruits and three servings of vegetables every day.    3.Just say no to alcohol.    4.Every day, cut 250 calories and burn 250 calories.     5.Increase your intake of calcium.    6.Hold the salt.    7.Do some strength training.|`|toxCN8oEaa	The key for losing weight is not difficult - consume less food and move more - the problems arise when we actually try to put that into practice! There are lots of opportunities to fail out there aren't there?! The sole method that clearly worked for me was wu-yi tea, it can be seen in the resource box below, they have a few free trials in stock, it was featured in Reader's Digest and CNN. I lost 25 pounds, it clearly does produce results!|`|4f46a3ab367e69b76b30e6290112ed68aa	The only way I know is to lose weight in general. When I lost weight, the first place it was noticed was in my face.
zhk8o514aa	That isnt always bad :-)|`|nUvy2g64aa	Boobs usually stop growing like 3-5 years after puberty I believe. So usually you will be fully developed by the time you finish high school.    I hit 5'7" by like my freshman year, stopped growing. But my breast size still changes a lot, because I'm one of them girls who experiences a weight change and my breasts get larger or smaller with weight fluctuations. And I'm 18 almost 19. Also I heard somewhere girls who take the pill may also grow up to a full breast size, and pregnancy can also affect your breasts someday.|`|kBQnBBV1aa	65|`|pGKnBmNxaa	Wait a while longer...18 is usually the longest it will take if you're a late developer. ;)    Plus, boobs/butt isn't everything. Being flat certainly has it's advantages. Like, I was flat when I was young and all of a sudden they got really big and started throwing me off balance. Not fun!     In a few years if you're not happy with your size you can get implants. Boobs size will usually increase/decrease with weight change.|`|GAhjctqNaa	some girls are just small..., and boobs/butt isnt everything to attract someone.  plus you can always get implants :)|`|oOfD9HFBaa	im 16, almost 17  im still getting a little bit taller.    so you probably still have a few more years for your boobs and butt to grow in. lol
qP58qlVraa	go to the doctor and he will send you for an ultrasound, same thing happened to me and I am waiting for an ultrasound, possible small hernia. Not saying that is what is wrong with you but could be too, get it check out, not worth the pain not knowing for a peace of mind. good luck :)|`|DhZ99ikFaa	Go to the doctor or hospital,get some tests done. It's most likely your appendix. best of luck.
pIhqD8JOaa	It happens when you are washing your hair.Some go into your butt and slide down to your clitoris or your vagina. It's normal.|`|02SG8Dchaa	Omg this is so silly but hopefully it is helpful. Ok I have REALY REALLY long head hair and most of the time when i shower and i am washing my hair i collect a bunch of hair in my but from my head lol. i will notice it sometimes in the shower and others when i am peeing. it sounds hilarious cuz it is. Maybe that is it.
AA10237782	Lifting weights does not make u lose weight. It is the cardio that does it, because u r burning the calories that u ate. I would say that u take a couple protein shakes a day on top of ur food, and do some lifting. Even if it is only ur bodyweight. Go to this site, tons of info:)  http://www.bodybuilding.com
w7JAVIzHaa	This is true. Your period should be coming soon. When I was 13, my period started being weird and sudden. Now, it's a lot easier to keep track of. Most women get a brown discharge. That's what also happens to me. Usually my discharge is very light-clear yellow. But when my period is coming, it goes brown. Maybe this is the answer to when yours will come.|`|MCSWTIPkaa	yea its coming|`|2F9EcT7Haa	it's probably coming soon.|`|H7fUC8ILaa	Nope their is nothing wrong with you  cramps are normal when your almost or getting or on your period|`|0c9e1b3ae869853565acf7c72f5fb7a9aa	sorry sweety its life  take midol or advil prior to that thing|`|EAqs9586aa	oh man.   I used to have THE WORST period cramps, like. I couldn't even move. Sometimes, id stay home from school they were so bad.   If you would like to not have a period, just go get the birth control shot, you can go to your local planned parenthood, and get it for free, (well, theres some stipulations, Just tell them that your parents don't know your there) but anyways.   You don't get a period for 3 months, && you wont get prego, not saying your having sex, but- you understand!   I love it.   no cramps.   no blood.   no tampons  no pads.     its love.   haha|`|KL1Y5FeHaa	Yes, it sounds like cramps, meaning your period is coming. Take some pain killers and wear a pad/tampon incase it comes. You could also be having some ovulating pains.
KPtrfsEYaa	I think a very wise woman once said "where oh where have all the smart people gone"|`|sQu3LLqtaa	You need to gain between 15 and 35 lbs to reach a normal weight.    Perhaps you could have a good supper every night as those calories are not burned up with most of the day behind you.  Bigger dinners would also help.|`|i7o1zE8Saa	no.. that;s not fat, ur pretty small...|`|Vk1Aj44Waa	fatass|`|6sPcYQr0aa	It doesnt really matter what you eat (besides the obvious junk food) and when you eat it, as long as it has the nutrients your body needs and you give it to your body when it needs it.  You cant forget protein, which is not only a main building block for your body but for your mind as well. I will explain.  One of the worst things you can do to your body is stop eating. Your body needs fuel just like your car needs fuel. And just like your car, the better the fuel and oil is, the better the cars performance, the better the food and liquid is that you put in your body with too make you "run" better.  If you are trying to lose fat. Try to raise your metabolism by eating smaller meals, more nutritious meals, and about five or six meals throughout the day.  Also, remember that if you are working out you are also building muscle, and muscle weighs more than fat does. So as you lose the fat and gain the muscle your weight might not adjust for a while until your muscle building reaches a plateau and your body begins to really tare away fat.  If you do not want to eat five or six small meals a day. Eat three meals a day, smaller portions, then between breakfast and lunch have a healthy snack or meal replacement shake, and another between lunch and dinner.  The idea is to teach your body to get rid of all extra fuel it doesnt need, which are fats, carbs, and simple sugars for the most part. And once your body begins to understand that you are giving it the fuel it needs when it needs it, then your body will no longer store fat cells as a fuel reserve.  It is also a good idea to use a body cleanser, or detoxify before beginning any change in diet. Especially if you are going to begin eating healthier. The process might cause head aches or muscle cramps depending on what your body has become used to. Also diarrhea is a common side effect of most cleansing programs, but dont worry this is a sign that your body is getting rid of the toxic substances. The cleans will help your body to easily extract the nutrients it needs from the food you intake and bypass the rest as waste.  To expedite the process it always helps to concentrate on full body workouts to keep energy storage empty. Also, drink water, water is used to clean your body inside and out. Stay away from caffeine and soda.  This will take time. But once you are able to achieve routine with your eating habits it is one of the easiest ways to keep the fat off.  So with this, your diet can be very flexible as well. You can have sweets and things but for best results I would stay away from all simple sugars, like candy.  Good luck and God bless.|`|Ff1zFcRBaa	your 53, eat some mickey D's|`|uNizUHJVaa	you should most definitely weigh more than that.  how old are you?  the average person with a small frame at 5'3 is supposed to weigh from 111-124 pounds    stop thinking you're fat you are underweight.|`|5dPLwEwbaa	no not at all dont worry|`|exFsWQy7aa	thats not fat hun  thats ANOREXIC!|`|lmVRIzVtaa	Are you crazy???!!

I used to use pads mainly because it's what my mom bought me when i first started my period and i was kinda scared to ask her for tampons, but eventually i thought enough is enough and if i'm not able to talk to her about tampons, how will i ever be able to talk to her about anything? So i asked her one morning and she said ok so i went and bought playtex sport with 18 regular and 18 super because i wasn't sure if i should get super or regular...and so i bought them and used them and they are really comfortable...in fact i totally forget that i'm even on my period...until the cramps come anyway...but it gives you so much more freedom...like you can go swimming or do whatever you want...so i would suggest tampons but pads at night...and i recommend always overnight pads...they are the orange ones...and playtex sport tampons...it has a plastic applicator so it's really easy to insert and remove...oh...and btw...i'm not sure if it matters to you or not but i'm 14...|`|zm7aJwrIaa	I use tampons, I used pads for the first year of my period but now that I've tried tampons I wish I would've used tampons sooner.  I've used Tampax Pearl:  They are good, comfortable.  Playtex Gentle Guide:  They are really comfortable and easy to remove.  I would recommend Playtex Gentle Guide.  I forget that I'm on my period sometimes when I'm using tampons, when I used pads it was a constant reminder every minute that I have my period.  But use a pad at night so you don't over sleep and go past the 8 hours.  It takes a couple tries to learn how to properly insert a tampon, but just keep trying and it's easy after awhile.  And It feels a lot cleaner.  Good luck.|`|6VFaNmcQaa	I'm with you this is my first month too.

XZqSO94saa	If it's that time of the month, you usually get bloated within a week or so of you're period- and during it.   Don't worrie. You're right, weight doe's fluctuate espesically at night.   At night you weigh more than other time's.. that's why it's suggested to weigh you'reself first thing in the morning after a bowel movement, weekly for weight-loss/ weight-gain , and monthly for maintaining.  Hope i'v helped!|`|A0C1dOB9aa	you probably have water weight since you are getting ready to start your period. I would not worry about it too much. Weight yourself again after your period has ended, and you should be close to your 103 weight.

This site offers the best acai products available on the market. Their products are 100% pure 100% organic, and kosher. When I first found their website, I was first impressed that they don't give false promises, nor do they make false claims of loosing unheard of and unhealthy amounts of weight in short amounts of time....and unlike those "bogus "free trial" sites, their site is NOT deceiving you by posting pics of skinny women (who probably never even have had a weight problem. All those so called "free trial" sites have just very small traces of Acai Berry in them if at all, with most of their products containing worthless multidextrin corn starch powder. Oh, and those so called Acai Berry reports and reviews are just these scam Acai Berry companies in disguise. Their so called reports and reviews are just recommending their own product, and then give you a link to their product website..I know because I fell for one of those so called Acai Review and reports, but only found out after I had ordered their so called  1 product, and what I got was off white tablets with just a few small purple specks, which I guess is their Acai, and the rest is the multidentrin corn starch powder. And in closing, again I emphasize DON'T FALL FOR "FREE TRIAL" SCAMS
RFglBYVKaa	The most effective way to burn fat is to consume less food and workout more often, the difficulties surface when we actually aim to put that into operation! There are lots of stumbling blocks in the big wide world don't you think?! The one method that clearly delivered for me was wu-yi tea, it can be seen in the resource box below, they have a few free trials in stock, it was highlighted in Fox News and CNN. I lost twenty pounds, it clearly does produce results!|`|huNpyxV7aa	omg me too im the same way lol.  so basically i just dont eat as much,  but i exersize every night.    like in my room with youtube.   lol try that.|`|lBZRbQbqaa	the first step is to love yourself and your body because if you don't you'll never feel happy. Eat food in portions that would fit on your palm, dont snack on chips but on veggies|`|AA10251366	I am registered on sparkspeople.com and it makes it very easy for you. After making a profile, you can fill in your food, water and exercise daily and they will calculate how may more calories, etc. you can have for the day.

G2bl7ztsaa	OMG I have the same problem too!!    I heard when ur'e hungry,drink a glass (or 2) of water instead - this fills you up more and you won't be be as hungry or it distracts you from eating a lot.    take up reading....walking....whatever ur'e into...keep busy!!|`|iJR6qAV9aa	Find a hobbie lol...that sounds mean.  but yeah if your bored find something else  to do other then eating. I recomend you see  the secret, its a movie. You can get anything  you want by the law of attraction it changes peoples  lives...everyday. :] So i though i would recomend it  they even have a book. So whatever interests you.  After that grab a paper and write down future  goals you want to accomplish then work on them.  You only have one life do something, that will  help you advance with it. Like say one of  those goals is to lose weight, which is possible since  your posting in this section of yahoo answers, then  as a current past time hit the gym, go for a run,  do workout tapes, play wii fit, go biking, swimming,  ....everything and anything that has to do with losing  weight and reaching your goal.:]  GD Luck|`|KWL7Y3Rzaa	You could go exercise! That's what I do-pick the time of day you're mostly likely to binge and use that time to exercise (that way you can eat whatever you want later).    Or get out of the house. Go run some errands, take a drive, do anything! Just stay away from the kitchen.    If you're house bound, try to not think about food. Call a friend, get online, watch tv, read a book. Or you could get yourself feeling pretty (that way you won't want to eat) by painting your nails and such. Just think about all the things you need to get done, that way your mind is too busy to eat!|`|qaQueMU2aa	I have the SAME exact problem. I tend to sit around the house too much...and when I do I eat nonstop and am always looking for more stuff to eat! It's really bad! My best advice for you is to join an activity or start going out more with people and being more active. I've learned that when I keep myself busy I definitely don't think of food as much. Invest in an exercise machine like I did. I know it may not sound like much fun, but it helps me get my mind off of food!!    I hope this helps!
OsT64mqMaa	Yeah it comes right before and after your period.|`|JxUFDutxaa	Yes.|`|TORBP6QIaa	Yes , sometimes its all you will get for a few days instead of a first period with all the blood you have heard about.|`|AA11106650	yeah it could be that. or its a possibility that you could be pregnant.|`|27gnpuxwaa	ive heard from girls yes|`|t6TvsWDeaa	It could be a sign of pregnancy. When you are prego, around the time of you period you can get something that is similar to your period but much darker. My doctor also told me that it could be a side effect from birth control pills, and that the reason it is a dark brown color is because it is "dead blood".|`|CJZyZ1Braa	yep|`|RYZ8CVZTaa	well it would be, but the white discharge gives u the sign that ur period is coming|`|lyJbZA2baa	yes,, this could be your period|`|mlLzIua3aa	Um, if you already got the white discharge and you're bleeding, then you are definitely on your period. Totally normal, every girl goes through it. Scary thing is I didn't get mine until I was 15!|`|ae2d2c69dd32c072dbe6fd640d2db003aa	It can be a sign of period coming. Sometime it happens between periods but should not be much and it shouldn't last long. If you have any fears, see your doctor.|`|M1vaxvUZaa	ya|`|99YDEbkcaa	It's dried blood. Small amounts of blood dry faster than large amounts, so usually when your period is coming or going away, it is often found dry. It's called spotting.|`|U3TYx75raa	YAH.  i had the exact same thing.  and i got so scared.  i didnt know if it was my period or not.  But it is, what happened to me, was i had that for about a week.  then it will eventually in the next while get bloody.  Wear panty liners, incase, it will hit you and you wont expect it.    be prepared, and carry pads with you.|`|AA10327722	Yeah.
1bZgTD8Haa	Scratching and your underwear elastic could be a source of continued irritation. Change to cotton with covered elastic for a while? Also, have you changed laundry soaps or fabric softeners recently?    Could also be a fungal infection considering the location. If your itch is not responding to cortisone cream you might try a fungicidal cream such as over-the-counter Tinactin, Lotrimin, or Micatin. If the itch is indeed fungal then hydro-cortisone will not help.    If it doesn't clear up after using an anti-fungal cream for a few days then you should consult a Dr. or other health care professional.|`|OsT64mqMaa	If you shave, it could be a razor burn. You should just stop itching it. That's what causing it to flake. Try different panties.|`|99YDEbkcaa	Wear cotton underwear and try wearing thongs, which eliminate that crease. Also, not wearing underwear to bed or at home lets the whole vaginal area breathe, and feel more comfortable.
OsT64mqMaa	Periods are very irregular. But that is perfectly normal. Just wait another 25 days, but be prepared with a pad about a week before that, just because you started recently. It fluctuates, so it will be light then heavy. It's just the way it is.|`|AN9PdKmgaa	the blood comes from your vagina the urine from your bladder these are 2 different openings. There is nothing abnormal about your period coming in 25 days especially when you are just starting the average is 28 days but can be longer or shorter. you will most likely have varying time between periods until your 20s|`|Xmc8C2Psaa	it's normal...however your period probably won't be regular for a while so don't freak if you skip a month or get 2 a month or something like that...also periods are very weird...they start out very light(right now you have a light period) and then they get heavy...the heaviest will be in the middle of that 6 days so probably be expecting your period to be really heavy on the 3rd day and then it will get lighter until it's over...honestly i'm 14...almost 15...got my period about 3 years ago and am still trying to figure it out lol|`|AA11106650	25 days is normal. usually they say 28 days, but if it comes on a little early then thats ok. Usually the first couple of days of my period it is really heavy and then it lightens up at the end.|`|SRlzo5yXaa	it's normal.  2 years ago ; when i first started i skipped 5 months and after that i became regular.  it's evening out , give it time.|`|naPYuaDQaa	Everyone's different, but it is definately normal to have an irregular period when you first get it. It usually takes a couple years for it to be regular, but again everyone's different.    Good luck,  Jokerbear|`|IYvenrU7aa	since this is your first few cycles, it is very common to have an abnormal flow, it should even out within a year or so, good luck  and welcome to woman hood =D|`|PyjZVn28aa	yes..everything you are experiancing is normal.....the 25 days inbetween and the 6 day period....your period starts light then maybe the second day it gets a little heavier...its very normal....dont worry...|`|oxsawg31aa	When you first start your periods they are usually irregular and it takes a while for them to get into a routine, and become regular. It just takes a while for your body to adjust, dont worry its normal and happens to everyone|`|WvRTxbdoaa	don't worry when i was your age i had my first period and then i didn't get it again for 5 months and they use to last for 7 days but now only 5   days.    the first couple of days are heavier then it gets lighter   good luck|`|yTiXirgXaa	It honestly just depends on the person. It is normal for your periods to be anywhere from 15 to 60 days apart, but since it is only your first period, it could be irregular. start tracking it now on a calendar and try to se a pattern over the next couple of months.    As for how heavy or light the blood flow is, I can't tell. It, again, depends on the person. Just be prepared for anything. Always have some protection on you. Hope I helped.
2d7e5cc0bc66da2c368bc5cd10c16a35aa	hey, well im not a doctor and im not you but don't worry to much because i had that happen to me it was like i had two periods back to back and i was so worried but, after that it was fine so don't get to worked up but if you have it another week deff. go see a doctor :) hope i help|`|OsT64mqMaa	You are just spotting. It's perfectly normal, there is nothing wrong with you.

Symptoms often occur after reading, computer work, or other activities that involve tedious visual tasks.    Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) is a rare form of stroke that results from thrombosis (a blood clot) of the dural venous sinuses, which drain blood from the brain. Symptoms may include headache, abnormal vision, any of the symptoms of stroke such as weakness of the face and limbs on one side of the body, and seizures. The diagnosis is usually by computed tomography (CT/CAT scan) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) employing radiocontrast to demonstrate obstruction of the venous sinuses by thrombus.|`|t6TvsWDeaa	What exactly do you mean by vision problems?|`|vbPx0uENaa	Dry eyes.|`|vyxqoI9eaa	I get migranes, and these are usually some reasons..    Too much stress  Not a balanced diet  Working out, way too long..  ( i have bad vision, going downhill ) So when i strain my eyes to see stuff, my eyes get stressed easy.|`|FAsQczkAaa	at computer too long, lack of sleep, possibly need new glasses, you should go to your opticians for a check up :).|`|LbtU8iWAaa	prob not enough water and protein. i heard that coffee really helps with headaches! try that!|`|8lARhhoOaa	you prob. just need glasses just go and see an eye doctor. the reason you are getting the head aches is because your eyes are having trouble focusing.|`|HxAyoEQVaa	A need for glasses on the mild end and a tumor on the occipital  lobe of the brain on the more severe side|`|999a56cf1347f99ff9dee6fe42651eefaa	You could be over stresssed.
KeeaVzxpaa	It will get infected as has already been stated. She will need a tetanus booster shot plus antibiotics. They will probably want to admit her to the "special ward" and I would second that idea.|`|5YMkieeXaa	FIRST doctor    SECOND ice cream    THIRD threapist.|`|jm2ppj62aa	get her to the hospital, chances are with your home bandaging its bound to become infected so unless you dont care i would take her to the hospital.|`|MQJ8w56Qaa	She needs to see a doctor before these cuts becomes infected and they will. If you wait, she will most likely get blood poisoning and require intravenous antibiotics and a long stay in the hospital.  Also, did you consider the idea that maybe she needs alittle more than medical help??    You said she was a friend, friends help friends. Call 911.
tIldpr7vaa	u cant diet, but u want abs? sorry kid thats an oxymoron, it wont happen. You have to diet to get the abs, simple fact of life. Decide which one u like better, junk food or abs...    and cardio is your  2 on way to get abs, hate to break it to u, but if ur not doing cardio or dieting, those abs will simply never come    watch ur sugars/carbs and calorie intake, and do cardio( why does someone ur age have to be on the machines??????) i know u dont wanna hear it but thats the way to abs.    ***and dont listen to Ms. Cut 'n' Paste answer below me, thanx|`|SQzku8AQaa	you shouldnt shy away from cardio machines because there are 40, 30, or 60 year olds on them. but if it really matters so much, you can try circuit weigh training. circuit training is bsaically no rest in between sets so that your heart rate is elevated throughout, thus burning fat. because ther are no rest in between sets, you put work on your respiratory system, in which oxygen is needed to oxidize fat. so it is important to work on breathing techniques- breathe more and more often during workout.     some good food choices: natural peanut butter, nuts and almonds, beans and legumes, whole wheat/grain anything-pasta, bread, cereal, unsweetened oatmeal, eggs, olive oil as your only oil for cooking, milk, nonsugary yogurts, tuna, fish, turkey, chicken, roast beef, lean beef, flaxseed, banana, apple, oranges, grapefruits, raisens, grapes.|`|b1feaaa978d115c4f2ff497d30752baaaa	I would try this workout. At the same time you will be gaining muscule and burning fat. So its awesome.       WHAT YOU'LL NEED: Two 5 pounds weights.  * means one 5 pound weight in each hand.    If you don't have two 5 pound weights try using water bottles full of water.      Workout:  Stretch  *20 Bench Press x3   20 squats x3  *20 side arm lifts x3  20 crunches x3  20 push-ups x3  *20 lunges x3  20 leg lifts x3  Walk for 30 mins  Stretch    Stretching before your workout helps you not to pull a muscule during your workout.    Stretching after your workout helps you not be AS sore afterward.     I try to do this everyday, but I'm sure you would get results doing this only 2-4 days a week. I recomend everyday.      Eat 1500 calories a day and drink 8 glasses of water daily.    You will lose weight and tone up!      I've lost 6 pounds and I've only been doing it for a week!      You can do it! i know you can!    You will be sore. and it will hurt but you can do it.    Don't be scared to add more excercises of more reps.      Hope this works for you!
J9jAwJ6saa	Vitamin C is a good vitamin to boost your immune system.    The best preventative measure to bacteria and viruses in washing your hands frequently... does not have to be excessive.. but especially when using public facilities. Try to avoid touching your eyes or mouth a lot. These are the most common areas when viruses enter your body. They are transferred by your hands through the mucus membranes in your eyes and mouth. Hence why hand washing is so important.
ZvhtPCWQaa	eat better, lift weights, do cardio.    but more importantly - get your physical health checked out before doing any of the physical activities mentioned above.|`|b1feaaa978d115c4f2ff497d30752baaaa	I would try this workout.

p0guNQhiaa	Your height is pretty much genetically predetermined. Girls normally gain height until they're 15 or 16 while boys grow longer and have later growth spurts.    My guess is you're pretty much done growing (save an inch or so). Don't ever take any medication that claims to alter your height. You'll likely suffer medical side effects and see no results (because they don't work, they can't work from a medical stand point).|`|KeeaVzxpaa	Human growth hormone will make you grow if you growth plates are still open. An x-ray can tell this. The treatment is expensive and involves shots every day. Once the growth plates close you are finished growing.|`|G1sEBPQkaa	Sorry. The only way to get taller is with heels.
p0guNQhiaa	Everyone experiences period side effects differently.    Some people get cramps when they actually get their period and others get them when they ovulate (the really unfortunate get them twice a month). These cramps that you're experiencing are due to your ovulation (which occurs in the MIDDLE of your cycle) so you should be approximately right in the middle of two menstruations.
UZJ7wVc8aa	Getting a nice set of abs is such a misunderstood process. It's actually a lot easier than most people think which is why most people are in a never ending quest to get that perfect six pack - it's because they're doing all the wrong things.    When you eat more calories than you burn, your body takes those extra calories and stores them as fat somewhere on your body. For some people, the  1 fat storage area is around the thighs and for others it might be around the stomach - it differs from person to person. Sometimes the fat is perfectly distributed around the body so it's not as big of a concern.     If an excessive amount of fat is stored around your stomach, the reason that you're not seeing your abs is because your body fat percentage is too high. What you need to do is create a calorie deficit (take in less calories than you burn) so that your body is forced to use its fat stores for energy. After a few weeks of doing this, you'll notice that your abs will start to show.    You first step is to figure out how many calories you burn each day. Use this calculator http://calorieneedscalculator.com for an estimate. Now you need to increase the amount of calories you burn by exercising more and decreasing the amount of calories you eat. Cut out junk food such as fast food, candy and sugar. Eat foods that are high in fiber: bread and pasta made from 100% whole wheat, brown rice, oats, fruits and vegetables.    You shouldn't ignore targeting your abs with sit ups, leg raises and twists but doing hundreds of sit ups won't do anything about the layer of fat that is covering them. Cardio and calorie restriction should be your main focus. If you need more details on getting a six pack, visit The Guide to Getting Nice Abs - http://www.straightabs.com|`|PWIjeHmQaa	just do a lots of crunches and sit ups.|`|sx0PpjvAaa	Google it old son.|`|2y2hqusNaa	The best advice I can give you is core training. Yoga and Pilate's are two key exercise to introduce into your routine.   In order to have get that Six pack abs.     I would also recommend taking an all natural supplement visit http://www.flathealthystomach.com/natura...    Flat Healthy Stomach will increase both your digestive system and increase your awareness with out the JOLT found in other caffeinated products.    Good Luck|`|8rMgQv15aa	In order to show off your great 6 pack, you have to burn the fat that is sitting on top of your muscle. That is done fairly easily with cardio work outs such as jogging, walking, biking etc. I find that the most effective way to burn belly fat is (if you are new to working out anyway) walking for about 10 minutes then do a 15 second burst of running/sprinting then 10 more minutes of walking and so on....    Good luck!

D2SLmkwKaa	Neither are good for you. I'm not meaning to be rude, but by smoking cigarettes you are putting yourself in much danger. Cigarettes cause lung cancer which makes breathing complicated and many other diseases. Carcinogens in the tobacco cause rapid cell growth. Cardiovascular disease will come along too. By smoking you are also putting your peers in much danger too. When you smoke and people inhale it, it is worse for them then you. That seems selfish to me in many ways. While your smoking just remember some day you'll probably be eating and breathing out of a tube in your throat. Oh and don't forget you'll have wrinkles and a scratchy voice.|`|HoHHpwDlaa	Well, hookahs are "better". Let me explain    Shisha can go through a "washing" process. Think of a tea bag effect. They take the tobacco and "wash" it and a good amount of tar and nicotine and other nonsense washes out. (then onto the yummy flavors!). After that, the water inside the hookah base helps as a filter while your smoking. After that, you can even buy a Heba Diffuser filters your smoke even more. AND THEN you can buy a nicotine filter to put on the hose. lol    Cigarettes are just straight up tobacco with lots of nifty chemicals of death. And a filter that doesn't really do anything.     So yeah, hookah is "better & safer." But, i'm not going to lie to you. Smoking is never good for you. But on a personal note, cigs are WAY NASTY. they stay on your clothes, give you bad breath, leave a weird film on your tongue. Hookah acts like an air freshener and only stays on material no more than 2 hours.     :] hope i helped|`|lTvoE3dPaa	water will filter out some carcinogens, so my vote is yes, it is safer. plus smoking the hookah is awesome :P|`|ODf41iN4aa	No, I don't think so.

Women typically have cellulite because as they gain weight, their fat cells swell but their connective tissue stays the same, causing a dimpling or cottage cheese look that we all hate!    Since cellulite is fat, the key to ridding yourself of it lies in reducing the size of your fat cells. This is best accomplished with a combination - a specific diet and effective exercise program. And, in case you didnt already know, body wraps, toning lotions, electrical muscle stimulation, herbal remedies and other quick fix solutions you see on TV and in magazines DO NOT WORK!

edFyHFRhaa	No it shouldn't affect your future chances of becoming pregnant but you should be careful to only take this medication as an emergency. Try to be more diligent with protection.|`|xv3opX9Maa	no ( =|`|FJswVeqbaa	no it will not...but paln b should be used for emergencies only not all the time...|`|p8U4586yaa	No, it won't. It's just a very high dosage of birth control pill horomone.|`|rev4lrn0aa	Nope, it shouldn't effect your ability to get pregnant down the line. You should consider getting on birth control though because it is more effective than Plan B and it is better for your body. It can't be good for you to put a large amount of hormones in your body at once like you do with Plan B. As far as the future fertility though, you're fine!|`|HLagddByaa	dont take plan b just because you dont want to use a condom  or dont want to use birth control.  its for emergencys,  get on the pill
mqXyDTwwaa	Whey protein is food, just like any other food, so buying Professional Strength Whey Protein would be like buying a Professional Strength Can of Tuna. It's just a marketing gimmick. If you already eat enough protein then adding Whey Protein won't do much. If you don't get enough protein then you should drink whey protein like you eat food, which would be every day.    A bottle of water is usually a little over 16 oz, so 4 oz is a quarter bottle of water. You should buy a measuring cup.

BQOrTZuwaa	I'm sure you will find this article very enlightening :)      The best way to "detox" the body is simply to let your body do its job. Unless you have a medical problem, your body takes care of itself quite nicely, experts say.    "The liver and kidneys are nature's best-kept secret, because they are the weapons to eliminate toxins from your body," says Gerbstadt. "If you are concerned about certain substances in your diet, it is easier and safer to simply eliminate [those substances] rather than engage in unhealthy detox plans."    Be mindful of what you eat, drink plenty of fluids, and avoid excess medications and alcohol, say the experts.    If you want to promote water loss, Gerbstadt suggests doing it naturally by consuming cranberries, celery, asparagus, and herbal teas, and limiting salt.    Most detox diets promote herbs, pills, potions, colonics, and/or fasts to rid the body of impurities. They also promise quick weight loss. And yes, you will shed unwanted pounds -- not because of any medical magic, but because these plans are super-low in calories.    "You will lose weight, but it is the not the unhealthy fat you want to lose but precious body protein and fluids," says May.    Detox diets tend to be extremely restrictive, allowing only unprocessed plant foods, which are supposed to assist the lymph, kidneys, and liver with the detox process.    Gallons of water or specially formulated drinks along with herbs (usually only available on the diet's web site) are generally the only liquids allowed. One regimen calls for liquids (various concoctions including laxative teas) for 10 days, without any solids. Coffee, tea, alcohol, processed foods, and animal products are not commonly part of any detox diet plans.    Enjoying a plant-based diet is perfectly healthy, but most detox diets go to extremes, experts say.    "The limited variety of foods and beverages and minimum calories is of concern because it is very difficult to get all the nutrients and energy you need for good health with such restrictive regimens," says Christine Gerbstadt, MD, RD.    Unless you have religious or cultural reasons to fast or follow detox programs, she advises against them.    "Massive fluid losses upset the delicate fluid and electrolyte balance, can cause gastrointestinal distress, headaches, fatigue [and] irritability, and can lead to dehydration," says Gerbstadt.    Colons don't need flushing unless you are prepping for a medical procedure like a colonoscopy. Colonic enemas tamper with the body's natural fluid and electrolyte balance and can lead to infection, irregularity, and dehydration. Instead, Gerbstadt suggests a high fiber diet.    "Eating more fiber in whole grains, bran, fruits, vegetables, beans, and nuts is a safe and natural way to add bulk to your diet," she says.    Gerbstadt also warns that fasting or following very restrictive detox diets can slow your metabolism, making it harder to lose weight once you start eating again.    "In many cases, they result in rebound overeating because of excess hunger, deprivation, and an out-of-control feeling that is not because of a metabolic imbalance or addiction but instead driven by the deprivation of the diet plan," says May.|`|y71F17T4aa	just exercise and drink water if u just want to get in shape. but if u r trying to detoxify your body from drugs then try not doing any and stay clean!!!!!|`|ioBay4k8aa	water!! plenty of it.
Eh7tXrhoaa	I'm a AA too, tiny boobs happen to the best of us, im really active and have a low body fat percentage. but the same thing happened to me, it passed in about a week|`|A2JbYCWFaa	People develop at different times, just be patient.|`|27aea472b3667b064c6f98d70ac05c5caa	It is perfectly normal for breast to develop at different times and rates. This is all a part of the process and more than likely it iwll correct itself soon. Do not worry or stress over this it is temporary. Give it about a year or so.
Q5qpMLOVaa	That's what you perceive. We tend to be extremely pessimistic about the way we look. You also saw your progress every day, and got accustomed to it.    I'm sure if you visit a friend you haven't seen in the past month, they will notice the difference.    Good job by the way!|`|mqXyDTwwaa	Your pants fit you differently. Either your jeans got bigger, or you got smaller. Just because you can't see a difference doesn't mean there isn't a difference.|`|8jVQxbjvaa	I'm the exact same way and I've lost 21 pounds. I don't think I look any different but everyone keeps telling me how much thinner I look.|`|HKHCuRI8aa	you will never see yourself different unless in pic, others can tell usually but 10 lbs is good, but you know its there cause your pants fit better. SO chill and enjoy it.
X8BJ5rSSaa	how much were u before and after?     edit- oh ok, woh maybe its just ur perception, i mean if u were 200 then when down to 190 then maybe u wouldn't notice cos it wouldn't be a lot to lose for someone of that size, butyea 10 pounds is a lot for that weight. but yea, u might still see ur problem areas and feel like u haven't made much improvement but i bet other people have noticed, when it comes to body image other peoples opinions on ur body are usually more accurate than your own.|`|AIVd5OHOaa	if your like most women you have areas u wanna lose weight off of, you could have not lost alot of problem areas and just over all so you dont notice it to much|`|AA11842267	yes u look a lil different trust me poeple should be able to tell u lost 10lbs   because 10 lbs is a big difference but my mom isnt on a diet but she is eating more healthier and u said u lost 10 lbs in 5 weeks my mom weighs about 250 and she lost 10 lbs in 1 week...in the last 3 weeks she has lost 38 lbs..|`|HBFHZXybaa	Yeah. Suppossibly Ive lost some weight to, and I also don't really feel different. In fact, someone today was like, "Nicole, your so skinny!" And I don't feel like that at all!
p3qrj7HDaa	You sound healthy. I'm 5'0 as well, and in high school I was anywhere from 110 to 120, and have always had an athletic figure, not small boned at all. It used to be something I was insecure about when I was a teenager (not having a petite frame), but I think everyone is insecure about their body in high school - even those you would never believe would feel that way.     5'5" trying to get to 100 lbs is sickly. Unless the body frame is very lanky and small boned, but I know that anything less than about 110 on me makes me look too skinny for my body type.    That muscle (which weighs more than fat as I'm sure you know) is going to make you feel healthy and happy and strong - be happy that it comes naturally for you, some people have a hard time keeping muscle on. Every guy I have ever dated has always told me how much more they prefer muscle tone in a girl as opposed to being "skinny"    Just get into the habit early on of getting into cardio every day for at least 30 min. Even if it's low impact like walking your dog or something, it'll help keep anything from getting out of control later on.|`|TuOp3hNPaa	cnt tell unless i see a pic. you should be able to judge that by looking in the mirror|`|ThdFMIFUaa	Maybe. I'm 5'5", 116 and trying to lose 16 pounds. But it depends on how much muscle you have.    And 'big boned' is just another word for fat.    Post a pic!!|`|Ipnnj07uaa	well honestly u are just about fine for your height. there is little scope of losing about 6-10lbs. but hey dont bother too much.......be more particular about being healthy and fit trather than weight loss. u have age to your advantage.......u be just fine when u turn 16-17 years.     if u have inherited a broad bone structure just like me the right choice of clothes can make u look really slim and fit. start to do some exercises for a tonned body.|`|LoXvNBEmaa	no. you're obviously healthy. and who cares what other people think especially if you are in the healthy zone and you're happy with yourself.|`|BgZA7lvQaa	It sounds like you are fine.  But try not to worry about what others think of you.  What you think of yourself is what counts.|`|MlCrsp5haa	remember, muscle (while the same weight, pound for pound, as fat) is half the size of a pound of fat.  You're just fine the way you are.  You're also 14 and still have some years of growing left to do.|`|Q7EN2Zqbaa	nope|`|ebJ02QZJaa	"big boned' is not another word for fat.  Ignore the poster that said that.      No, I don't think you are too big, especially if a lot of it is muscle.|`|lcP4AjhLaa	Ugh don't listen to the first girl.  You can tell she's an overweight white-trash whore who likes to make herself feel better by putting others down.  Don't worry your weight sounds fine especially since your playing basketball and yes, whether the first dumbass poster believes it or not, there is such a thing as big-boned.   God she's a *****.|`|411c9e50db3e6aa419765275e1da7d4aaa	since you have a ton of muscle mass, then your weight is just right. :]|`|SE8SElEMaa	I'm 24, 5'0 (YES im short :) )  and 115lbs...I'm trying to gain more weight!

AFy1dcTcaa	I wouldn't think that eating ice pops on a diet would be that bad.  My wife and I are on the Weight Watchers diet.  Weight Watchers uses points instead of calories, although calories, fat grams, and fiber are used to calculate the points for each item.  With my weight, I have a total of 37 points per day, and although we are not eating the Weight Watchers brand, the regular fudge pops are only 2 points.  Under this diet, I can eat one a day.  If you only want to eat one a week, then you should be fine.  Just remember to exercise at least 3 times a week.|`|3TdT5mG2aa	What exactly are the ice pops made of? Pepsi? Orange juice? What? Or is it just ice?    If you want ice pops, try them with something like OJ or perhaps grapefruit juice. That is a healthier way to eat them.    Just buy a ice cube tray and fill it with your healthier drink. Let it sit a few hours and put tooth picks in them!|`|H0LfFGmlaa	Oh yeah breaking the code.|`|pWnsUHMBaa	hha. not really.   but do it anyways|`|fvuEtkROaa	Check the calories !|`|v2ZBawa7aa	Well, they are flavored sugar water with food coloring mixed in.  The main problem with them is the sugar.|`|DWE2EI35aa	What's the point of a diet if you're going to regress in terms of eating habits?    Make it a healthy living choice whether to eath ice-pops per week.    Before you choose to eat something ask yourself this single question:    What can my body benefit from eating [insert food item here]?    Seriously, you should eat what your body needs and having said that, I don't think our body need ice-pops at all.|`|FXe5Lv9eaa	Go ahead, splurge. There isn't much inside of an ice pop other than water and flavoring...|`|6bqL4BmCaa	Diets don't work.    Weightwatchers does.     It will let you eat what you want.    Only smaller amounts.    So you eat what's good for you.    Not a whole lot of crap.    So yes you can eat icepops.|`|63899b8a7193738547e937e28a651057aa	That's mostly sugar and water. Don't do it!|`|o1pXRFtUaa	lol yeah its ok... its actually good to break your diet once per week, it keeps your metabolism in check and fluctuating which is good. If you want to eat them more than once per week, buy the sugar-free kind... then you can have one everyday! the sugar is the only thing in ice-pops that is really bad for diets.|`|VIGCR9Xiaa	Treat yourself with wait-watchers treats once a week. Ice pops are full of sugar! The high corn fructose commericals are not technically correct. Yes, the syrup is made from corn. However, only a hair of corn is found in it.|`|kW5HfnRnaa	you can have one everyday!  get sugarfree ones.  there are a ton of diet ice pops out there for when its your snack time.|`|DksKPjHsaa	Squeeze some oranges and poor it in an ice cube tray! Plastic wrap over, leave in freezer for 1 hour, then put toothpicks in! Overnight, then you can eat them! DON'T make them out of things like Coke or Other juices, they are bad for you! But if it's fresh? Go for it! :D|`|Zo0mKtRDaa	Yeah as long as water is in your diet|`|123aGpwgaa	No. You'll get fat.  What you need is a nice trip to McDonalds 3 times a day          STAY AWAY FROM THOSE ICE POPS!!!|`|Ov7VJe54aa	They actually have a brand out now for people on diets. I can't recall the name, but it has a cow on it..
0lnamekJaa	First off... You are already either at your target weight or slightly under.    Second... If you eat under 1,200 calories a day, your body will go in to starvation mode and you will lose all energy and your body will both start to eat it's own muscle and you will store each and every calorie you eat as fat because your body thinks it is going to die.    Doing what you say will be an incredibly stupid thing to do...    PERIOD.    It sounds like you have an eating disorder.|`|h0rt6YJ4aa	You don't need to loose any weight, your only 15, its unhealthy to diet aggressively at your age in an effort to loose weight, your still growing.

Your weight is good anyway.|`|HO47ZZ9gaa	girl don't starve yourself ur good at ur current weight if you have like a bulge in an area ( I mean it in a good way I'm so not trying tooo be rude sorry if I am ) you'll need to look into exerciser's for that specific area of your body. also if you were to only eat like 800 call a day it still wouldn't do you any good. it's what you burn not what you don't eat what ever you do take mutivitamins like if its ok with your doc and all that jazz your body needs nutrients nutrien that you can only get from the food you eat.so if your going to do it make the 800 cal count eat food that nuritious your body. for more info on this stuf you can read articles from web md  or google it. and get this stuff from an expert cuz i sure ain't one I just know what I read.  just be carful not to over do it you dont want to fall out.   kay god bless ^_^!|`|zA1dEHkKaa	eh you don't need to lose any weight your only two inches shorter than me and i weigh about the same as you and i am pretty skinny, so ppl tell me to eat more. 800 calories is not a good idea because we are young and still growing we need about 2,000 calories per day.|`|ae2d2c69dd32c072dbe6fd640d2db003aa	You don't need to diet. If you have soft areas, exercise. You may need to ask yourself if you are anorexic. Eating less than 1200 calories a day is dangerous. One of  the first things you might notice is that your hair will start falling out...I am not kidding. No dieting.|`|EQydFhzmaa	This isn't healthy for anyone! You are crazy to think it is right of you to loose weight this way. I would hope that you wouldn't do this. You will only damage your body this way. Go see a dietitian. This is not good at all.|`|Sm9cq8KKaa	You don't need to loose weight. Eating 800 cals/day will result in UNHEALTHY weight loss. You will loose valuable muscle make and become very frail and that's not good. Weight is not only a measurement of fat; it also measures things like bone density, muscle mass, and water %. I am 5'0 and weigh 125 and that's still in the range for my height, so 115 is fine, even on the skinny side, for you (I have tons of muscle mass and really big bones). Your healthy range is 103-136 lbs so you're FINE! What's more important than weight (and it's been proven) are: is your waist under 32 in. (females)? Are you living a healthy lifestyle?  And focusing on your weight to such an extent is unhealthy and will only make you feel badly about yourself for no reason at all. Don't go down that path - too many women do.|`|Kp4rkRL8aa	thats going to mess up your metabolism which will make you GAIN WEIGHT|`|4cOMTVTcaa	honey please, eating 800 calories a day is madness! that's considered starvation. and when ur body goes into starvation mode, it starts to eat away at ur muscles...which you will never get back.  at ur age, and at ur weight your fine! but if you want to lose weight, dont cut down your calorie intake, more like snack constantly throughout the day on healthy things, like vegies, fruits, etc. and maybe go for a walk everyday for 30 minutes.   this is help you ton up as well as lose the "fat" that you may want to lose.   but please don't eat only 800 calories a day, it's really not good for you. and when you reach your goal (the right way) you want to healthy and not sick.   hope that helps, good luck :)|`|da2KJ9fXaa	i don't get why everyone is exaggerating you are not underweight you are at a normal weight. i definitely understand i want to loose weight too. anyways yes eating 800 calories will help you loose weight drink a lot of water that way you won't feel hungry, cuz you're stomach will always be full with water.|`|FI3NgjJXaa	From my own personal experience, I've been losing 1-2 pounds a week, but it depends on how much exercise you are doing. Me: not so much. If you add some running or something, that could probably get you to three to four pounds a week.  I don't know much. I'm sorry.  This is really not a healthy way to lose weight, maybe you should try something else. I don't know.  Good luck, I guess.  P.S. Your weight sounds normal enough to me...|`|AA10100051	Eating 800 calories a day will make pounds lost the least of your worries. For your age, height and BMI, 800 calories are not enough to sustain you. You'll likely feel faint, or actually faint, and be too tired to get through your day.    Sandy|`|IpIx4Naiaa	Ok no 800 calories a day is unhealthy way unhealthy you should be eating at least 2,000|`|Je6BQcERaa	You would die... x_X They say that a 1600 calorie diet is enough to lose weight and stay healthy.  Try that.|`|eAupvb3taa	You sound the right size to me already. I was 5'3 and 115 pounds for many years (I was thin). It all depends on your metabloism and how much you work out. If you are very active and cut your calories, you can safely lose 2 pounds/week.
AA10242807	You'll lose a lot of water out of your body,  so drink lots of water to keep hydrated, healthy looking skin, and the energy to keep running.    Doing this,  you will lose weight quick, but if you stop suddenly and go back to eating lots of meats or junk food, you'll gain it all back really fast.  So ween off of this diet slowly when you're ready to.

AA11856941	Popping of joints releasing pressure bubbles and was previously thought to cause arthritis.  While this has been largely disproven, it is a VERY bad idea to pop your knees as they are load bearing joints (unlike fingers).  Popping them can cause misalignments that, under pressure could result in injury or dislocation.  Popping is not a physical needs, but a compulsive behavior. Make a decision to stick to your finger and toes.  Steer clear of the knees, back and neck.|`|AA10109345	i would say yes as you could pop your knee out of place and need medical attention to get it back into place|`|AA11956628	my mom told me that if you pop your knuckles, your knuckles will grow larger than it should be and it would look ugly.|`|AA11848993	no it is not bad - in fact it is now thought it might even slow down arthritis    the pop sound is the sound of air escaping the joint - this eases pressure on the joint which is why it sometimes feels so good!

Guys get "wood" throughout the night (approx every 1-1/2), which is the typical cycle of REM (a stage of sleep with rapid eye movement).

e8fa2fbd26261aed1d25efb84f86fc73aa	WHAT IS BELL'S PALSY?  Bells palsy is a condition that causes the facial muscles to weaken or become paralyzed. It's caused by trauma to the 7th cranial nerve, and is not permanent.    WHY IS IT CALLED BELL'S PALSY?  The condition is named for Sir Charles Bell, a Scottish surgeon who studied the nerve and its innervation of the facial muscles 200 years ago.    HOW COMMON IS BELL'S PALSY?  Bells palsy is not as uncommon as is generally believed. Worldwide statistics set the frequency at approximately .02% of the population (with geographical variations). In human terms this is 1 of every 5000 people, and 40,000 Americans every year.    IS BELL'S PALSY ALWAYS ON THE SAME SIDE?  The percentage of left or right side cases is approximately equal, and remains equal for recurrences.    IS THERE ANY DIFFERENCE BECAUSE OF GENDER OR RACE?  The incidence of Bells palsy in males and females, as well as in the various races is also approximately equal. The chances of the condition being mild or severe, and the rate of recovery is also equal.    WHAT CONDITIONS CAN INCREASE THE CHANCE OF HAVING BELL'S PALSY?  Older people are more likely to be afflicted, but children are not immune to it. Children tend to recover well. Diabetics are more than 4 times more likely to develop Bells palsy than the general population. The last trimester of pregnancy is considered to be a time of increased risk for Bell's palsy. Conditions that compromise the immune system such as HIV or sarcoidosis increase the odds of facial paralysis occurring and recurring.    CAN BELL'S PALSY AFFECT BOTH SIDES OF THE FACE?  It is possible to have bilateral Bells palsy, but it's rare, accounting for less than 1% of cases. With bilateral facial palsy, it's important to rule out all other possible diagnoses with thorough diagnostic tests.    CAN BELL'S PALSY AFFECT OTHER PARTS OF THE BODY?  Bells palsy should not cause any other part of the body to become paralyzed, weak or numb. If any other areas are affected Bell's palsy is not the cause of the symptoms, and further testing must be done.    HOW DO THE SYMPTOMS OF BELL'S PALSY PROGRESS?  Very quickly. Most people either wake up to find they have Bells palsy, or have symptoms such as a dry eye or tingling around their lips that progress to classic Bell's palsy during that same day. Occasionally symptoms may take a few days to be recognizable as Bells palsy. The degree of paralysis should peak within several days of onset - never in longer than 2 weeks (3 weeks maximum for Ramsey Hunt syndrome). A warning sign may be neck pain, or pain in or behind the ear prior to palsy, but it is not usually recognized in first-time cases.    IS BELL'S PALSY CONTAGIOUS?  No, it is not contagious. People with Bells palsy can return to work and resume normal activity as soon as they feel up to it.    WHAT ABOUT RECOVERY FROM BELL'S PALSY?  Approximately 50% of Bells palsy patients will have essentially complete recoveries in a short time. Another 35% will have good recoveries in less than a year.    Regardless of the trigger, Bell's palsy is best described as an event - trauma to the nerve. As with any other injury, healing follows. The quality and duration of recovery is dependent on the severity of the initial injury. If the nerve has suffered nothing more than a mild trauma, recovery can be very fast, taking several days to several weeks. An "average" recovery is likely to take between a few weeks and a few months. The nerve regenerates at a rate of approximately 1-2 millimeters per day, and can continue to regenerate for 18 months, probably even longer. Improvement of appearance can continue beyond that time frame.    IS MUSCLE ATROPHY A CONCERN?  Not as a rule. It takes longer for the muscles to start to atrophy than it takes for most people to fully recover.    IS BELL'S PALSY LIKELY TO HAPPEN AGAIN?  The possibility of recurrence had been thought to be as high as 10 - 20%. These figures have been lowered as more has been learned about conditions that are now diagnosed as other types of facial palsies. Estimates of the rate of recurrence still vary widely, from around 4 - 14%. Most recent reports hover at 5 - 9%. The average timespan between recurrences is 10 years.|`|95074504f3e1102dd72e54155df6d07faa	Google it. There will be lots of answers and support groups|`|AA11511980	Bell's Palsy is usually hereditary.

It is also a great place to meet other people who are facing the same situation as you.|`|AA10892605	Bell's palsy is a condition in which one side of the face becomes paralysed. It is usually temporary, and the majority of cases start to get better within three weeks.    Bells palsy accounts for about half of all cases of paralysis affecting the face. Medically, the condition is described as a facial paralysis that comes on suddenly and has no obvious cause (such as an injury).    Over 80 per cent of cases of Bells palsy clear up without treatment in a matter of weeks. However, the condition can be distressing and many people affected are reluctant to socialise because of it. In less than one per cent of all cases, the paralysis may affect both sides of the face at once.    A self-help programme of physiotherapy may stimulate recovery from a mild attack of Bells palsy, though evidence is slight. The following may be advised:    Massage the face using a moisturiser.   Exercise the facial muscles in front of a mirror.   Apply gentle heat to reduce any pain, using a microwaveable pad for example.   Bells palsy may make it hard to close the eyelid. These safeguards can help stop the surface of the eyeball drying out:    Using a finger, regularly close the eyelid to moisten the eye.   Wear protective glasses or an eye patch, to guard against dust.   Tape the eye closed for sleeping.   Use "artificial tears" (eye drops) to keep the eye moist  ask a pharmacist for advice.|`|babf04621256dff724b65efc27619372aa	eletrical stimulation of facial muscles with massage will be a best treatment.....|`|2889b7708743bbca0b71792f90a65926aa	The main symptom of Bell's palsy is a sudden weakness or paralysis in one side of your face that causes it to droop. This may make it hard for you to close your eye on that side of your face.     I assume she is getting medical treatment.  That's a shame.  All you can do is support her.  She is probably having to go through a lot because of it...she needs to know you love her and will help her any way you can.  I hope this helps you.

You're probably just a late bloomer. Don't consider plastic surgery! It's discusting and fake.|`|UCGpCA9haa	it all takes time like about a couple months ago on the news there was this person who had breast implants when she turned 18 and then her boobs started to hurt because they were still growing. She had the implants removed and a month later she was up a cup size. plus your boobs dont stop growing until your 30 so youve got a long time! dont worry. plus im 15 going on 16 and I have been a b cup for the past 5 years and I am a lil overweight!|`|0gLec1VPaa	Does it really matter about your boob size? (laughs) Well, it kind of depends on what kind of person you are. Some people, who are naturally skinny, have smaller breasts, because they usually build up upon fat. Also, if you dance, the energy you use in bouncing around from place to place might also stunt your growth. It's okay though. I have weeny boobs too. :P|`|SMVsmzi4aa	no u probably wont, im turning 14 in march =], but anyway yeah people say im underweight for my age too, but i really don't think of it as a bad thing, and anyway u don't want huge boulders.|`|iWg7Z1mDaa	Oh Emm Gee!! i know how you feel!  im 15 and an A to. but my mom was small so im scared i wont grow lol. but plastic surgery was made for a reason lol but if your family is decent then i bet you will stilll grow. but be happy with your body until then =]|`|7fQ24aQQaa	There's a program you can look into called 'Fuda' to develop breasts quicker.

When I was your age, I was the same. I took the very smallest size. By the time I was in my mid twenties, I was, wait for it, a 36C.    One thing you could do to help things along is stop dieting if that is why you are underweight.  Just eat sensibly and try not to fall into the trap set by the media and your peers that can make you feel like you must be a stick to be anybody.    Remember, the mammary glands are one of the places a girl stores fat.  If you eat properly, your size there will automatically go up. So fat is not always bad!  Everybody needs to have a little :)|`|CWwpCQfSaa	you'll grow same w/ me|`|AA10750123	Don't worry you are still young!|`|jpqSnCpuaa	probably|`|Xw9LqSUNaa	Well my girlfriend is a A cup too  Shes 15 also  But it like runs in her family.ha  But maybe just wait it out?

Like if your in high school..they really can't do much, but if your in like a military kind of thing then you might get in a bit of trouble. try not to smoke really close to the time of the test. if its a urine test ..it can be detected a week after the smoke session but blood test can tell about a month after. Hope this helped and good luck.
ijduNTgyaa	Ok for eating, dont eat junk...duh, thats easy a lot of people know that. Try to not eat a lot of salty things, it traps water in you and it doesnt help you lose weight. Drink lots and lots of water, stay away from slim fast/vitamin water/energy drinks, some might be good the energy drinks are horrible for you and water beats them all out for quality and its FREE! Water is the bodies oil. Drink more and youll feel great. Try to eat small but more portions of good food throughout the day, it speeds up your matabolism.     To burn fat, you need cardio and lots of it. Go running, biking, swimming, jump rope is pretty good and fun sometimes and rowing.     But if your serious about losing FAT you need to forget about your scale and just look at your body. Muscle weighs a lot more than fat so if you start working out and get discouraged because your gaining weight its because your getting toner, and thats a good thing!     Ok then, some good work outs for ya...These are gonna be good for ya because you dont even need a gym or any real equipment, just mostly dead weight exercises.    For the buns  Plie  Stand with feet slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, arms at sides, toes turned out.  Tuck tailbone under and contract glutes.  Lower body into a plie squat as low as you can go without allowing knees to creep past toes.  Simultaneously raise arms to shoulder height in front of body, palms down. Hold for 2 seconds, then return to starting position.  After 20 reps, pulse at the bottom for 20 seconds.    Hip-Lift Progression  This is an awesome way to relieve tension in your lower back and work your butt at the same time. (A cushy mat will keep your tailbone from crying afterward.)  Lie on your back with your arms at your sides with your knees bent and your feet on the floor.  Lift your hips toward the ceiling. Hold for 1 count, and then lower back down.  Repeat the lifts for 60 seconds, squeezing your glutes and hamstrings at the top of the range of motion. Be careful not to overarch your spine.  To make this exercise more difficult, extend one leg at the top of the lift. Keep your thighs parallel and hold the lifted position for about 5 seconds.  Keeping your hips up, place your foot back on the floor and then lower your hips.  Repeat this exercise for 30 seconds; switch sides and do the move for another 30 seconds on the other     Dumbbell Squats  A simple way to kick off even a quickie workout, these squats are powerful little moves. Over time, increase reps and dumbbell weight to amp them up.  Start with your feet shoulder-width apart and 8- to 10-pound dumbbells by your thighs.  Squat down as if you were going to sit in a chair, keeping your weight over your heels.  Squeeze your glutes as you return to the start position.  Do 15-20 reps.  As you continue, keep the weight in your heels, making sure your knees do not past forward of your toes.  For a bigger challenge, try it without the weights, jump explosively, and land in the squat position.    Legs  do lots of squats. also do leg lifts on your side and your back (lay on your back and SLOWLY lift you legs up and down, if it doesnt hurt, do it a lot slower. shoot for 25 lifts, if it doesnt hurt, go to 50)    arms  Bicep Exercises  Standing Barbell Curls   1. grab your weight with an underhand grip with feet shoulder width apart  2 . allow the weight to hang in front of you, keeping your elbows close to you at all times.   3. moving only your forearms bring the weight into your shoulders.  4. hold for about 5 seconds and then repeat.   Dumbbell Concentration Curls  1. sit on the end of a bench with your legs spread  2. reach down in between your legs and pick up a light weight with one hand.  3. place your elbow on your knee and make sure your arm is fully straight.  4. place your other hand on your other knee so the upper body has some support.  5. using your forearm only bring the weight to your shoulder and hold for a few seconds.   6. repeat and then switch arms  Triceps exercises  Lying Barbell Extentions  1. lie on a workout bench with feet shoulder length apart on each side.  2. grab the weight and hold it above your head with your arms straight.  3. using your forearms only, lower the weigh until it is about one inch above your forehead.  4.then push the weight back to starting position and then repeat.  Tricep Dumbbell Extensions  1. grab a light weight with one hand with feet shoulder length apart  2. lift the weight so your arms are straight above your head  3. slowly lower the weight behind your head  4. then slowing lift the weight again above your head until your in the starting position.  5. repeat for one set of 10 times and then do the same for the other arm.  Forearm exercises  Barbell Wrist Curls  1. grab a weight with your wrists facing down.   2. sit on a workout bench with your arms resting on your legs and your wrists hanging over the bench.   3. using your forearm strength, curl the weight using only your wrists  4. hold the weight
b1feaaa978d115c4f2ff497d30752baaaa	I would try this workout. At the same time you will be gaining muscule and burning fat. So its awesome.       WHAT YOU'LL NEED: Two 5 pounds weights.  * means one 5 pound weight in each hand.    If you don't have two 5 pound weights try using water bottles full of water.      Workout:  Stretch  *20 Bench Press x3   20 squats x3  *20 side arm lifts x3  20 crunches x3  20 push-ups x3  *20 lunges x3  20 leg lifts x3  Walk for 30 mins  Stretch    Stretching before your workout helps you not to pull a muscule during your workout.    Stretching after your workout helps you not be AS sore afterward.     I try to do this everyday, but I'm sure you would get results doing this only 2-4 days a week. I recomend everyday.      Eat 1500 calories a day and drink 8 glasses of water daily.    You will lose weight and tone up!      I've lost 6 pounds and I've only been doing it for a week!      You can do it! i know you can!    You will be sore. and it will hurt but you can do it.    Don't be scared to add more excercises of more reps.      Hope this works for you!

nINIHF8baa	I was a couple of weeks after my 10th birthday.  My aunt was just short of being 9 years old.  However my mother was 12 and my sister 15.  A lot of it depends on your physical development.  If you have started breast development and have a more 'womanly' shape rather than a girlish shape, if you have noticed secondary sexual development (body hair).  You may notice a slight sensitivity in your breast area too.    Cramps do not mean anything either.  I didn't have cramping at all until after my second child was born when I was 24.  Most women do get a slight amount of discomfort, usually through fluid retention, just prior, but cramping isn't the norm.  The media and society have carried on so much over cramping and whatnot, that now, young girls expect to have cramping issues and guess what?  They do.

z5JkgFOyaa	Birth control pills are not dangerous.  If they were, there would be millions and millions of women out there with problems and birth control pills would not be prescribed by doctors anymore, so unfortunately your Mum is wrong.    Birth control pills are a synthetic form of the hormones progesterone and estrogen. They prevent ovulation by maintaining more consistent hormone levels. Without a peak in estrogen, then, the ovary doesn't get the signal to release an egg. No egg means no possibility for fertilization and pregnancy. They also thicken cervical mucus so the sperm cannot reach the egg, and make the lining of the uterus unreceptive to the implantation of a fertilized egg.    Some common minor side effects of birth control pills can include some mild nausea when first starting birth control pills, spotting or breakthrough bleeding, breast tenderness, mood changes, decreased sex drive, weight gain, cervical changes and vaginal discharge.    Birth control pills can be good at helping prevent ovarian cysts from forming on your ovaries as ovarian cysts usually form during ovulation.    Typically, ovarian cysts are functional (not disease or cancer related) and occur as a normal process of ovulation. During the days before ovulation, a follicle grows. But at the time of expected ovulation, the follicle fails to break open and release an egg, as it is supposed to. Instead, the fluid within the follicle remains and forms a cyst.    Functional, or physiological, ovarian cysts usually disappear within 8-12 weeks without treatment. They are relatively common, and are more common during a woman's childbearing years (puberty to menopause). Ovarian cysts are rare after menopause.    Functional ovarian cysts are not the same as ovarian tumors (including ovarian cancer) or cysts due to hormone-related conditions such as polycystic ovarian disease. Some non-functional ovarian cysts must be treated to go away.    An ovarian cyst can cause pain if it pushes on nearby structures, ruptures or bleeds. Pain may also occur if the cyst is twisted or causes twisting (torsion) of the fallopian tube.     Symptoms of ovarian cysts can include:    * Pelvic pain - constant, dull aching   * Pain with intercourse or pelvic pain during movement   * Pain during bowel movements   * Pelvic pain shortly after beginning or ending a menstrual period   * Abnormal uterine bleeding (change from normal menstrual pattern)   * Longer than usual menstrual cycle   * Shorter than usual menstrual cycle   * Absent menstruation   * Irregular menstruation   * Abdominal bloating or swelling     Often no symptoms are noted and ovarian cysts are found only be routine examinations.  Usually birth control pills may be prescribed to help establish normal cycles and decrease the development of functional ovarian cysts.    Simple ovarian cysts that are larger than 5-10 centimetres and complex ovarian cysts that persist should and will usually be surgically removed via laparoscopy (minimal invasive surgery).    I would recommend that if you think you have an ovarian cyst that you consult with your doctor/gyno about this and ask them to answer any questions or concerns you may have.    I have suffered from many bilateral ovarian cysts over the past 11 years and have surgery 2 times to have them removed (it wasn't anything too serious).    I hope this helps to answer your question.  Good luck :)|`|YoryG2zIaa	I would keep using the method that your using if you like it after all your doctor prescribed it to you and you've been ok this far!  Every birth control has risks but they are usually few and far between...  You can find out if you have a cyst by going to the gyno for a check up and she'll press down by your ovary and if you feel pain and/or she feels a knot she may tell you to get an ultra sound if she thinks you   have a cyst...then you would go from there but they are treatable even if you have one or get one....|`|nO2vflnPaa	A cyst is a fluid-filled sac. They can form anywhere in the body. Ovarian cysts (sists) form in or on the ovaries. The most common type of ovarian cyst is a functional cyst.    Functional cysts often form during the menstrual cycle. The two types are:    Follicle cysts. These cysts form when the sac doesn't break open to release the egg. Then the sac keeps growing. This type of cyst most often goes away in 1 to 3 months.   Corpus luteum cysts. These cysts form if the sac doesn't dissolve. Instead, the sac seals off after the egg is released. Then fluid builds up inside. Most of these cysts go away after a few weeks. They can grow to almost 4 inches. They may bleed or twist the ovary and cause pain. They are rarely cancerous. Some drugs used to cause ovulation, such as Clomid or Serophene, can raise the risk of getting these cysts.|`|AA11783467	Pills are fine. & there's no way they'd give you the same thing as something a MAN had. Birth control pills work via hormones & technically prevent your period (you'll still get blood, but that's so you [as in all women who use the pill] don't freak out b/c they don't have their period).  Ovarian cancer is VERY rare, but is deadly. If you're truly worried, you can get screened by your doctor. But I wouldn't worry b/c I doubt you have ovarian cysts of any kind, cancerous or benign.  If you & your boyfriend are having sex, you should be taking birth control. Better safe than sorry, right?  Next time you go to the doctor (or schedule an appointment soon), talk to him or her about birth control &, if you want, have your mom in the room. Your doctor can explain all possible side effects, etc. associated with birth control pills.|`|TlHwwnmBaa	I think what your mum says is an old wives tale.  I have Polycystic Ovarian Syndrom (PCOS).

If you have that, your Provider can prescribe what is needed.      If hyperthyroidism is ruled out, and you have stopped growing/developing, (reached maturity of at least age 21), you could try increasing your daily fat intake by about 20 grams a day.     This will provide you with an additional 180 calories of intake a day, which should add a pound to your body every 19-20 days (3500 calories to a pound).     Then you should slowly but steadily reach your goal of 115 within 300 days, 10 months.    When you reach it, cut back to only 10 extra grams of fat a day and see, over the next 2 months if you can maintain your desired weight at 115 .    2 slices of cheese a day at bedtime will provide the  necessary 20 grams of fat.
yY2Czxy2aa	As far as I can tell, there are no proven weight loss benefits from the acai berry, juice, or capsules.    It does seem to be a great supplement (I take it, but don't sell the stuff!) and is full of anti oxidents, which help prevent damage to your body. But that's what you should take it for, not weight loss or fat burning.    The acai berry itself is an amazing thing - has a lot of anti oxidents etc and is really good for you.    But there's nothing really to suggest in scientific terms that it helps with weight loss.    And there are a lot of scams out there, be careful where you buy it from!    I take it, and I think I feel healthier and better. But it's not some type of magic formula, sorry.|`|S730dpLfaa	WARNING! Read this blog before trying Acai Berry!  http://acaiberryscams.wordpress.com/2008...  Thanks to this blog, it helped me a lot to choose the best.  Hope this helps :-)|`|NPzDQmlQaa	One thing that brought my dieting and losing weight out of the plateau I was in so long was the Acai Berry.  I was stuck at my weight loss goals and this brought me through it and made me lose a lot of weight.  So in my opinion it helped me lose weight tremendously.  I know a lot of that dieting stuff is expensive but I found a free trial of Acai Berry(I think it only cost me like 7-8 bucks at the time for shipping.)  The site was theweightlossplace.com -  All I did was try it out for a month and I was sold,  I saw the results I wanted to and like I said I was in that plateau with my weight loss.  This kicked it up a bunch.    Good luck and I hope this helps.|`|BQOrTZuwaa	The acai berry is an inch-long reddish, purple fruit. It comes from the acai palm tree, which is native to Central and South America. It is a relative of the blueberry, cranberry, and other dark purple fruits.    Research on the acai berry has focused on its possible antioxidant activity. Theoretically, that activity may help prevent diseases caused by oxidative stress such as heart disease and cancer.    Some studies show that acai fruit pulp has a very high antioxidant capacity with even more antioxidant content than cranberry, raspberry, blackberry, strawberry, or blueberry. Studies are ongoing, though, and the jury is still out.    People eat acai berries to address various health conditions. But so far, acai berries have no known health benefit thats any different than that of other similar fruits.|`|GRzGP7ruaa	Even though the actual berry is technically still under the scope there have been good reports of what it can do.  Especially when it is mixed with other nutrients.  If you are wondering due to some medical/supplement experimentation, I have some more information.  Acai Elite and South Beach Acai are the two that I have seen work better for most people.  Their needs ranged from losing weight, to being healthier, and even needing more energy.  The most convenient place I have found both these items was Diettrials.info.  Plus, both were under five dollars for a two week trial.  Just some added info in case you take this search further!|`|gUHBJiCfaa	Not really sure what I would recommend to you specifically.

Maybe you need to get to the doctor ASAP. Could be something else.      Plan B is safe and well-tolerated. Some women may experience side effects which are generally mild, similar to those of regular birth control pills. The most common include: nausea, abdominal pain, fatigue, headache, menstrual changes, dizziness, breast tenderness, vomiting, and diarrhea. After taking Plan B, women should be informed that their next period may be heavier or lighter, earlier or later. In a clinical trial, the majority of women (87%) had their next menstrual period at the expected time or within  7 days. Patients should be advised that if their period is more than one week late, they may be pregnant. If your patient experiences severe abdominal pain, she may have an ectopic pregnancy and should seek immediate medical attention.|`|pQz6k4r2aa	could be something he transmitted to you sexually, go get it checked out, STDs are no good, the faster they're detected the better.|`|ulzBv4w1aa	i would go to the doctor. it seems like your body is cleaning itself out but if its a chunky discharge it could be infection|`|jb9guNo3aa	It might just be some of the sperm coming out from the intercourse. I'd say you should go see your doctor and make sure it's nothing serious. Plan B is basically a bunch of hormones, and sometimes hormones can mess with your libido, so not being able to get wet doesn't seem like it would be a strange effect. I hope this helps.

zJzUjYeTaa	I am not saying that you are or are not pregnant but to make sure you should buy a pregnancy test. It is better to know then not to know. How I would do it is take the test and then put it on the counter. Don't look at it until you are ready to see it.   But even though you are 23 your breasts are always growing. So they will get sore sometimes before and after your period. Also, I get post menstrual cramps occasionally and i have consulted with my OBGYN about this. She said it was normal but if I would like it to be regulated then I should be put on birth control.     I hope I helped!    |`|wPfPjbuiaa	When you go to the doctor tell him exactly what you told us.  You may be pregnant and your period was actually your body having a miscarriage.  I had a situation where my period was late and I took a pregnancy test.  The test was positive and I went to the doctor the same day.  I started to bleed while I was there and he told me that I may be having a miscarriage.  The next day, it was like my period started.  I called him back to make sure and he told me that more than likely I was having a miscarriage and that if my flow was heavier than a cycle to go to the emergency room.  Well, it wasn't, but when I went back to him, I was no longer pregnant.  If I hadn't taken the pregnancy test and what I thought was my period would have started the next day, I never would have even known I was pregnant.  I was only 10 days late, which is normal for me, but one of the clues that I was pregnant was that my breasts were tender for 3 weeks.  When I counted back to see perhaps when i could have gotten pregnant, it was one of those days where me and my boyfriend had unprotected sex before he put on the condom.  Men have pre-ejaculatory fluid that leaks into the vagina during intercourse even if they don't ejaculate inside you.  It is always best to use the condom at all times, because you can get pregnant even if he only inserts it one time and leaks a little fluid.  Trust me, it happened to me. Take the pregnancy test.  If it turns out negative, go see your doctor.  Your body may not have had a full miscarriage and there is still some left that needs to be cleaned out. (That's what my doctor told me)|`|4b644d3e9fa1328649e31b2870d579ccaa	Try to think if you carried a heavy object a day before the pain occurred.  But then it is normal.

Also, kindly apply baby oil to your arms, shoulders, legs and hips before you go to bed tonight.  Take care and GOD BLESS!|`|jb9guNo3aa	Pregnant women can sometimes still have their period. If the last time you had any unprotected sex was more than 2 weeks ago, you should definitely do a pregnancy test to see if you are or not. You're going to find out eventually. Definitely tell your doctor about having sore nipples about thinking you may be pregnant before the exam, because it may change things. (I honestly have no idea, but I would want my doctor to know I may be pregnant before probing around in my vagina!) I hope this helps.|`|TflNnrjkaa	YOUR EGGO IS PREGGO|`|57919765ad901b66eb0087eac952de3caa	Your nipples being sore could b from not wearing a bra...it happens to me if i don't wear one especially if it just around the house and on a cold day.

OOL4XdjPaa	running is always a good way to lose weight.. honestly, it works really well. I had a friend who joined the marines and he was like 260 and within just a few short months he was down to like 180. He RAN all the time. As much as he could. And at first, he couldn't go far and wasn't fast.. but over time he built up and got really good at running long distances..     Also..     I don't know how much money your family has but the Nutrisystem Diet really works. I did it in high school... which was hard cause my friends were always eating out, but I lost a lot of weight and pretty fast.. the first week alone I lost like 8 or 10 pounds. I didn't stick to it though cause I wanted to be out with friends..  I regret it now.    And I ordered it again just last month. My first week alone I lost 10 pounds and then my second week I lost another 5.. and I was never hungry..    and if you cant do nutrisystem.. you can email me if you want like more suggestions of cheaper ****.      The real secret is to eat a lot of protien. It fills you up. Seriously.    When you get hungry instead of junk food try like fruit or a hard boiled egg..    ALSO drink 8 glasses of water a day. Not only does it keep you hydrated but it also helps flush fat.    good luck and feel free to email me anytime.|`|TKA2mgFBaa	Run 3 miles a day 6 days a week and you will see dramatic results in less than 4 weeks.

0lnamekJaa	Your body knows something that you don't...    You are lacking in something and your body is telling you to eat everything you can until you find whatever it is you are missing...    Sometimes, your body will know what it needs... It will say "I need potassium so I will make her crave bananas" but in general, your body doesn't know what it needs... Just that it needs SOMETHING...    So it tells you to eat and eat until you get what your body needs.    Start by taking a multi vitamin every morning... Eat a wide variety of foods... Avoid the junk your body automatically tells you to eat...    You need a vitamin or nutrient that you don't have and until you get it... Your body will keep telling you to eat until you do.    Also... What you eat changes how fast you get hungery...    Eat a candy bar or some white bread and your hungry again in an hour... Becaues it burns right up...     But eat complex carbs and whole grains, it takes longer to digest so you stay full longer.     You sound like you need to see a nutritionist to figure out what is going on with you...    There is also a 0.0001% chance it is a tapeworm!

That is how boxers keep their weight down.|`|AA10289095	hi :) am not sure whats available in the markets...but, this is what i did to lose weight... PLEASE DONT TAKE PILLS... pills are nothing but anorectic agents... they make you feel less hungry... there is no way to loose weight fast... though , sauna , steam and massages help slightly... it has to be combined with diet and excercise... pills are very bad in the long run... can lead to impotency and infertility...    Also... short term diets are no good because , they terribly pull down your body metabolism rate since you dont eat much during that period ... Because of this , once you break your diet , you'll start putting on more weight, the reduced body metabolism will take longer and slower to burn the food you take in...    They also dont work because once you break your diet and start eating normally, you will get back to your normal weight as you might not be cautious as to how many cals you take in per day...      i lost 10 kgs in about 5 months time... i am getting married in august and i desperately needed to loose weight... i was 65 kilos when i started... according to my BMI , i was 10kgs + overweight... i stand 5'2.odd and 65 kilos is grossly overweight...    just dieting wont help like i found out in my case... diet + exercise will do the trick...    i'll tell you what i did... it worked for me... hope it works for you too :)    the trick is not to starve but to eat smart :) and stay healthy :)    what you should cut down :  oil , butter , cheese , margarine , mayonisse , sauces (depends , will get back to that a bit later), chips , crisps, nuts , chocolates , sugar , cola, fizz , areated drinks ,ice creams , chocolate , alcohol , cakes and everything else thats hi - cal... you'll need to avoid everything thats sweet , oily and sticky... if you are not sure about what foods to avoid... check the net...loads of info available...    vegetables / meat to avoid :  potatoes - very very important , beetroot (its a root and has concenterated sugar in it) , all kinds of roots basically except carrot... avoid lamb, mutton , pork , beef, and prawns... all these put on weight... eat only lean meats... thats fish and chicken.. avoid eating egg yolk... eat just the egg white...    fruits to avoid :  mangoes , bananas , jackfruit      now that we had a look at what foodstuff is to be avoided...you might be wondering if there is anythig at all that you can eat... thats how i felt... there is loads of stuff you can eat actually :)    here they come :)    fast foods are a big no no... you can order salads and special lo cal foods that are avaailable in most outlets...    its best to eat at home for the period you are dieting and trying to lose weight...after those few months... once you've shed your load...you can get back to your usual lifestyle... of course with some caution...      my diet...  breakfast:    skimmed milk (use skimmmed milk , is low in fat , other typer of milk are higher in fat content) , fruit... i am from India... am not sure where you are from and hence you might not understand certain food types we consume here... but let me tell you something... Indian food is very very oily and very difficult to diet...    and try cereal in the mornings... oats, weetabix... etc... have a good breakfast...alwaays use brown bread... whole wheat brown bread is very good for weight reduction...      for lunch , we are staple rice eaters... rice is bad for fat reduction... but i still took rice because its a habit tht cant be changed... everyone takes rice here... so... rice - one cup - 100gms and lots of veggies cooked in less oil.. and absolutely no coconut and curry with less oil... all in all keep your oil intake to 2 tea spoons everyday... that would be just for seasoning... also using olive oil helps a lot...      then for dinner... compulsarily have wheat... pasta is a good option...but make sure you buy wheat pasta... check before buying... and of course in pasta absolutely no sauces... some varities of sauces are acceptable... as far as they dont have cheese , butter , oil ,mayonisse and fattening substances in general... you can use tomato spicy sauces etc... make sure your sugar intake doesnt cross 2 - 3 spoons per day... (not tablespoons) and no butter and ghee of course... eat a lot of fruits and vegetables... and all kinds of cereal... if you are hungry... eat a fruit... or you can eat stuff like puffed wheat and puffed rice... but no puffed corn... corn products again put on weight...      eat sandwiches as much as possible... i dont know which part of the world you are from and hence cant suggest much for you in terms of recepies...    and combined with dieting... you need to excercise for atleast an hour everyday... you'll see the difference...defenitely... if you think gym is boring... take up dance classes... or run along the beach... if you have one... or skate... or just about any physical activity... brisk walking will also help...  the key is to stay healthy while you diet and lose weight...    drink loads of water...atleast 6 glasses per day... and do a lot of physical activity.... take the stairwy instead of the lift.... and small things like that...  if you have any more queries...mail me... cheers :) and good luck :) its not difficult...you'll get used to it in a few days... and of course the results are fab:) who doesnt want a great looking body...    you can get back to your normal lifestyle once you slim down... after that... its just eating what you like and burning it out the next day with just a little bit of excercise :) also check your weight everyday... its a great way to motivate and monitor your progres :)    Source(s):    personal exp :)

1ae7e839ec5d4526ca30f3217c29341caa	It's not necessarily that your face will always be darker then your body because it gets more sun.  My skin on my face is lighter then the rest of my body and I'm always trying to figure out ways to make it darker.  Have you started using a darker foundation?  Always make sure your foundation blends with your skin tone.  I've seen so many girls that have that mask effect going on on there face.  They feel that since its summer they should darken their foundation, even before they have tanned evenly, they use a color that usually is way to dark and ends up looking orange and quite ghastly.   If that isn't it, try using a spray on self tanner for the rest of your body, to have it match your face.  Don't forget about your back and go easy on rough patches of skin cause the tanner shows up more on them. (such as knees and elbows) Hope I could help.|`|AA12399771	got alot more sun|`|AA12059569	Cause it gets more sun than the rest of your body.|`|AA12127008	it gets more sun than the rest of your body|`|8f954d05e43ea8e991acf0f8690c6f6daa	Although it is true that your face is being exposed to the sun more than the rest of your body.

2d9e5564a6d7647ee34df83f9e3d1083aa	I have a son with mental retardation. (this is a more correct way of describing him rather than "he is mentally retarded").    Through his school years, he had a few classes with "normal" school kids involved.  These became good friends over the years.  Our school system had special activities which included both "normal" and "disabled" kids in the same activity.  These included a Circle of Friends program (movies, bowling, parties, etc.), Unified Sports (part of special olympics where teams are mixed), etc.    Why don't you check with your school or community and see what's around?  Check with Special Olympics in your community and see if you and he/her can get involved together.    Set an example for others by being first to spend time with him/her.|`|AA11408895	I have a "special" friend as well and I dont think he has the burden of scocietys judgments.

I dont mean to say that fat girls can only date retarded people, I just think that some girls and guys are less judgmental of others no matter how big or retarded they are. There is a special people conference that meets in my town once a year that he usually gets hooked up at. Look into them in your area.    Everyone deserves to be loved. Im gay and make an effort not to pass judgment on others as I dont like to be judged myself.

Second, and most important, these woman, as well as nursing mothers, should always see their health care professional if they suspect a yeast infection rather than self-treat because yeast medications may interfere with medications needed for their other health problems (HIV, diabetes) or pose risks for the baby.|`|6657ddbfd244bd7d724b2cfd30cc1996aa	plain yogurt i heard you can use.|`|AA10460778	If you have never previously been diagnosed with a yeast infection then you should not attempt to self treat.  If you have never been previously diagnosed you may not have a yeast infection, but BV which has symptoms similar to yeast infections.  However, if you have been previously diagnosed and can recognize the signs then self treating is something doable.  For a diabetic, it's no big deal.  However, pregnant or nursing women should never put anything into their bodies without checking first with their doctors.  Anything that an expectant mother or a lactating mother puts into her body can pass to the baby.  As for a person with HIV, any infection of any type should be discussed with a doctor.  HIV is a disease directly affecting the immune system which can make something as simple as a common cold potentially deadly.|`|d1f9bf9f7c5d543fec83194a58bf6e5caa	I don't think yogurt insertion (plain yogurt, non flavored only!) carries any risk.

AA11755374	fruit or fruit smothies|`|AA10256302	A balanced breakfast should include a protein and a carbohydrate to keep your blood sugar levels steady.    Before a work out a breakfast with some complex carbohydrates such as whole grain toast or cereal,a fruit and some milk, or milk alternative.Will give you energy for your workout.    After work out,you need to restore the amino acids to ur muscles so you will need to eat a protein with a carb,such as half an apple with nuts or nut butter,or a piece of cheese,hard boiled egg,or chicken,fish or legume.Or you can drink a protein meal replacement drink.|`|aa00a767a77cb150d4fb5cfd9994cdfcaa	Egg whites and fruit are very healthy after excercise.  Try 4 egg whites, and melon fruits.|`|AA12199525	A bowl of special K with fruit.|`|AA11840385	Breakfast should come before exercise. No matter how much you eat the night before you will always wake up with low sugar stores in your body. So it is important to have at least a small breakfast so that your body doesn't break down muscles to use as energy. Before you work out I would reccomend something light, such as a glass of orange juice, a yogurt with granola and a slice of whole wheat toast with peanut butter on it. This way you are hitting all the food groups. After your am workout it is important to eat again right away, even if it is somethig small like an apple or a banana, because again if you do not your body will break down muscle in order to repair muscle. If your work out is really intense have a nice meal after, like pasta or rice with vegetables and chicken or tuna. Most people find it strange to eat this way in the morning, but it's actually much better. You should have your largest meal in the morning, a mid sized meal at lunch and a small dinner. Think about it, most people eat a huge dinner and then flop down and watch tv. Eat a huge breakfast, and you will have energy all day to burn!|`|d8cdbdd0e5cc60625fa4afad382163c2aa	bananas and bagels are good

I just had it done, and it is NOT something you want messed up!  You have to live with your new breasts for the rest of your life!  However, there is absolutely no need for you to pay for the procedure.  If you need it, your insurance will cover it.  Mine was very good about it and covered everything after my deductible.  Yours will too!  You should find a plastic surgeon in your area who is board certified.  Ask to see their portfolio to get an idea of how they work.  Get a consultation and they will work out the insurance details for you.  It's a wonderful surgery and you will be so pleased that you did it.  It is certainly worth the 8 to 12 grand, but someone else should pay it!|`|AA10240928	I know it's cosmetic surgery, but maybe you could argue that the reduction is a health necessity.

Talk to your family doctor and explain your problem.  Your doctor may have information and maybe there are alternatives to reduction surgery.

Symptoms include missed period, fatigue, tender and swollen breasts, implantation bleeding, nausea and or vomiting, food aversions, frequent urination, and increased sensitivity to odors. Not everyone experiences symptoms, and some people feel some but not all symptoms. Implantation bleeding occurs a bit earlier than expected, and it is scanty, spotty, pinkish and not red and heavy like a period, and does not follow the normal pattern of a period (light to heavy to light). If you feel you may be pregnant, your best bet is to wait at least two weeks after a missed period, and see your doctor for a blood pregnancy test as this is the most accurate way of testing.|`|a5fa814463162ce965ae513e4b726f3caa	yes nasua vomting feeling tired and missed period and yes there is discharge.|`|AA11524577	MORNING SICKNESS,  hungery all the time, mood swings like crying all the time|`|AA10728704	Usually nausea, moodiness, tired, some pinkish discharge and sore back.|`|8e22a11a13ad8c1aa6fbe2fdec773bcaaa	Depends on the person but generally yes.

But, sometimes it's best just to express your irritation when it occurs rather than let it build up to a point where you feel like you have to scream into an internet void in hopes that the human echo will come back to you.  Your negative feelings are more likely that sense of abandonment we all feel when our only connection is nameless and faceless.  For so many people today, this is how we connect, and it just isn't enough.  What results is an anger, not toward people, though we might misinterpret it as such, but anger at the condition of our lives.  Guess what?  There are so many of us that do understand, but we just don't know how to fix it.

I always catch one when I go to work and someone else has a cold.    I don't know why you'd want one though.  It will last more than one day.you should just complain of stomach pains and really play them up if you need part of a day off, just go to school, and lay down in the nurse's office, if all you want to do is get out of the assembly.

af28c57b9781c8df210e70eb7645338baa	Sexual intercourse is a common cause of urinary tract infections because the female anatomy can make women more prone to urinary tract infections. During sexual intercourse bacteria in the vaginal area is sometimes massaged into the urethra by the motion of the penis.

Although it is rare, some women get a urinary tract infection every time they have sex.|`|AA10793254	Urinary tract infections are caused by bacteria.Where or not it has been contracted sexually depends on the type of bacteria that has caused your Urinary Tract Infection.

You will definitely feel it and get improvement.|`|AA12086491	its not a weight bearing exercise.

Fat is nothing more than stored energy (about 3,500 calories or 1.5 days worth of energy is stored in one pound of fat).  If you burn 300 calories by riding your bike, but eat an additional 300 calories because you are hungrier, then you've just maintained your weight.      In my blog and book I teach you how to balance your caloric equation in order to achieve the weight goals you desire.|`|cb28ec3dd23e46f943fccae9851d36feaa	Biking is not a weight bearing exercise, which is exactly what you  need to add to have a more balanced exercise program.

AA11309384	It depends on your build. I'm also 5'6, and my "ideal" weight is about 135-140. If you have a small frame, then you're "supposed to" weigh around 120 at your height. If you have a larger frame ("big-boned"), then you could weigh up to 150 lbs. So, anywhere from 120-150 lbs, depending on your build.     Don't put too much stock into what some chart or what someone tells you that you should weigh. Everyone is different. Remember that while looking good is nice, the goal is to be healthy above all.

AA12346188	I am unable to understand whether you are male or female. Both can perform or indulge in masturbation with difference.  Male:  Apply some coconut oil or some good gel or ointment, on glans penis as well as on foreskin and full length of your penis to make both the areas smooth.  You can use either right or left palm according to your convenience and start moving your palm back and forth slowly and steadily and the rytham changes automatically.  As the penis is not made of metal, you have to take care not to use it roughly, otherwise, curvature may/will occur (Curvature means bending). Let your palm movement be smooth on your organ. Though it may not harm, it affects you psychologically. Excess in anything is bad and hence, as far as possible, avoid frequent masturbation.   Female:  You can use your full palm on your entire vagina to caress the area (called Libia Majora). Then gently, let your ring finger caress the inside lips called libia minora, slowly let your finger caress the clitoris, till you get orgasm. You can adjust the speed of caressing, fast or slow, according to your excitement and choice. Apply any smooth medicated gelly to your palm and fingers to make the action smooth.

I'm 23 years old and I've been smoking since I was 13 or so.  I've tried the gum, I've tried the patch....the gum is nasty and the patch burns like hell, so after a few hours I had to stop.  If you do it cold turkey, apparently that if you can not smoke for over 3 days, then you've basically quit.  It takes 3 days for nicotine to leave your system, so if you make it past day 3, you're there!  YOu can also try hypnosis.  I don't believe in hypnosis, but a lot of people use it these days.  Also, doctors say that, every time you get a craving for a cigarette, take a sip of water and that will help with the cravings.    when I quit cold turkey, since all my friends and family smoke, i asked them to not smoke around me and that if I ask for a cigarette, no matter how much I beg, DO NOT GIVE ME ONE!  That seemed to do the trick for the most part until I started again Lol.  GOOD LUCK!|`|AA12304950	Get patches or the gum and try. I will never smoke.

I smoked for 7 years, and was up to a pack and a half a day by the end. I started going to the gym and replacing my cravings with exercise. Funny though cause for a while Id finish my cardio then go out for a puff. It became less and less over the next 3 months and eventually Id just have one maybe three or four at a hard night a the bar. Eventually that became maybe 1 then none. On a few occasions Id ask a friend for one, but it became harder and harder to choke it down. It go to the point where Id have a puff and cringe at the feeling, and I could have any more. Last year I thought Id try it at a party I was having and asked for a drag...oh dear god. It was horrible and I felt awful for the next two days. I could feel it in my lungs, and the only thing that cleared it out was a good long walk with a bit of jogging to clear me out. It also helps that in our town people are not allowed to smoke in restaurants, bars and within 15 feet of any entrance to a public building. Four years ago I may have complained about it, but now I am thankful, and it was definitely for the best.

717d62d5de202b46c46f5becd784a752aa	It usually takes about two months for your body to become accustomed to a birth control regimen -- what you're having now sounds like what they term "breakthrough bleeding" and is relatively common when you begin a hormonal birth control.  The large amount of hormones entering your body can be a shock to the system, causing it to do unusual things.    I had this problem when I began my birth control pills, and I had to have my dosage adjusted several times until I found one that worked best with my system.  The best advice is to speak with your OB-Gyn -- probably not just your physician -- and tell him/her exactly what's going on.  If you can, document at exactly which times you begin to bleed and when/if it slows down or stops.  According to your biological calendar, your doctor can adjust the dosage to fit your needs.    But, whatever the case, don't hesitate to speak to a doctor, because you could have an underlying health condition, or your medication could be potentially causing damage to your system.  I see that you said you've spoken to your doctor, and they said to hold off, but if you're having concerns don't be afraid to be a little pushy -- it's your body after all!  Also, an increased level of stress hormone can also result in breakthrough bleeding, as well as a heavier period!  So the more comfortable and relaxed you are, the better.  And, keep in mind  an increasingly heavy flow during the time you should be having your period can be a sign that your dosage is becoming ineffective, which can result in accidental pregnancy. (That's where part of the percentage comes from when they say that it is 98-99% effective!!)  Ultimately, don't get too freaked out -- it's a pretty normal problem and a lot of women have it.  If it doesn't go away by the time you get to your third ring, you definitely need to get checked out -- but remember, it may get better, but it might not go away completely! If it doesn't, you can always get your medication changed so you don't have lots of extra laundry to do!! Somewhere out there is a dosage that is perfect for your body.  Haha, sorry this was so long -- good luck!!|`|AA11103295	i would probably talk to your gyno bout taht one...|`|47fd0dba92e5a2bd9fe50b8fe014458eaa	Best person to ask is your OB/Gyne -D'OH!!!|`|5e4d11d18a3eedc4edfb533e87c0e69daa	You should maybe call your doctor.

I sthis the first thing you have used?DID you start the nuva ring the first Sunday after you started your period? I use the nuva ring and i don't think that that is what is making you bleed.Because like i said it is just like the pill and it releases little by little hormones supressing the peroid until you take it out exactly 3 Sundays after you put it in ,in then which you should have a period FOR 5 DAYS THEN YOU start all over.....I think you need to see your gyno and find out where the bleeding is coming from.....I love it i haven't had not one problem so far? Good luck see your gyno....

Avoid High Glycemic Load Carbs (sugar, pastries, desserts, refined starches such as breads, pasta, refined grains like white rice; high starch vegetables such as white potatoes) and drink lots of water.     Do not try fad diets or diet pills. Here is an excellent food pyramid that anyone can follow: http://www.rayandterry.com/html/images/P...    *3) Exercise on most days by doing cardiovascular training and/or resistance training activities.

If your shoulder or chest muscles are big because you've been using them hard, it can somewhat impinge on the blood/nerve supply.  It's not life-threatening, but can be somewhat progressive.  Stretches, mild physical therapy, and osteopathic manipulative treatment can help with this condition|`|b7f9f8629b47c3af8e901463c5c060c9aa	loss of blood|`|e9f5cd9471401de04f2f2b14f7f39805aa	Pinched nerve maybe?|`|c4a655f17f0974ef1a8538212db60e5faa	contraction of muscles, it happens to me sometimes but if he cant handle it, maybe he should get it checked out, or start streaching more|`|6865662fa27b688c86a4b2450cb0ed73aa	i do too. the erason why is because if he workd out really hard then he must do bench press. his fingers go numb because the blood that tries to circulate is stopped by the weight of the bar. then he finishes, his fingers are numb|`|a6bc30a2168bd622945bbd38c2f1c771aa	poor circulation. i would see a doctor to make sure.|`|AA12275316	Probably because the blood in his body has to go to his muscles, this blood comes from his fingers so they go numb.|`|AA11354519	Not getting blood circulation to his fingers.

Find a good personal trainer who might give you tips on what you need to do.  Good trainers will come with a lot of education.  Look for certifications like NASM or a college education.   And the truth is the biggest or the most beautiful trainer may not be the most educated.  I ran health clubs ofr years and trained hight level athletes, as well as your average everyday individual.

We "fluffy" people store our fat, because we have very efficient bodies.  For some reason, we are primed to store it.  This could be a result of genetics, of starvation style dieting at some point in life, or of an underlying illness or metabolic disorder, among other causes.  Our bodies are set up to do more activities on less energy intake.    Yes, we could "dump" a certain amount of it, more or less depending on how quickly your bowels move, but for the most part, it is absorbed by the body.    Fat absorbtion actually begins at the start of the small intestines, where the gall bladder releases chyme, which emulsifies the fats, allowing a greater deal of surface area for intestinal enzymes to do their digestive work.  Fat digestion continues throughout the intestines.|`|AA10291049	There is no maximum you can take in...you will store most of them; however, there is a maximum amount you should eat, which is around 20g.

This is where the breakdown of fat molecules begins.  Food remains in your stomach for about 4 hours before being passed into your small intestine, where the absorption of nutrients takes place.  Some of the fat will be passed through your body as waste, because the body does not digest anything at a 100% rate.  Most fat will be stored on your body if not burned as energy.  To burn the fat at the highest rate, you must be in a state of ketosis, which is the principle of low carb diets.|`|70a76c6cde06d4ea41f91cccf3cdfbdeaa	our bodies have this cool thing called metabolism that allows some skinny people to eat as much fat as they want and still be able to not gain weight. Every persons metabolism works differently.    So to answer your question depends on how high or low you metabolism is. I don't think there is a certain amount that your body can or can't take before you excrete it.

Also, there are several drugs your neurologist can order that can help with the fatigue. Trying to stay cool can also help. Heat really exacerbates symptoms for most of us with MS. If there is a local MS support group where you live you will find a lot of help from people who are living with the same problems.

Whenever you eat refined sugars, your insulin kicks in to store the sugar as fat to use at a later time.  A lot of overweight people cannot lose weight because the insulin level is too high and their bodies store too much fat.  Once the insulin gets out of balance, the pancreas is affected, causing uneven levels of insulin production.  It is like the pancreas doesn't understand why we are so fat so it goes all wacky.

The are many culture mediums that are used for different specimens and/or different organisms.  Most plated media is based on Agar, a gelatin like substance where the specime is spread on the surface then icubated to see what grows.  The most common are blood, chocolate and MacConkey.  Most Organisms will grow on Blood plates.  This is an agar base with 5% sheep red blood cells.  Chocolate Agar plates are called such because they look like chocolate but they have none, these are agar plates with hemolyzed sheep blood, that is the cells are broken to release their hemoglobin and other nutrients.  Chocolate plates are especially useful for isolating Neisseria species and Haemophilus species as they don't grow on blood plates, these organisms lack the enzyme required to lyse blood cells themselves.  MacCinkey plates contain an antibiotic against gram positive organisms so they are for the growth of gram negative such as E. coli.  There are several other plate and tube media for other applications.  Special media for anaerobic bacteriea that cannot survive when exposed to oxygen, media that is specialized for mycobacterium species such as tuberculosis and thayer martin that is specifally for neiserria gonnorhea.  Certain sets of media are used for certain specimens, a throat culture will normally get a blood and chocolate plate, urine is normally cultured on blood and macconkey.

The following healthy living recommendations will help you if youre trying to lose weight, tone up your muscles, have aspirations of building lean muscle mass, are attempting to get a wash board stomach, or just want to feel better:    *1) Burn more calories then you're consuming everyday and measure your results using the following formula: Calories Consumed minus Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) minus Physical Activity minus the Thermic Effect of Food (TEF).

It is difficult and unhealthy to lose more than one or two pounds per week. There are 3,500 calories in a pound. If you eat 500 fewer calories per day for a week you will lose one pound. If you burn through exercise 500 more calories per day for a week you will lose one pound.     *2) Eat natural and organic foods found on earth versus something created by a corporation to make money. Eat meals in small portions throughout the day and take a good multi-vitamin supplement.     Avoid High Glycemic Load Carbs (sugar, pastries, desserts, refined starches such as breads, pasta, refined grains like white rice; high starch vegetables such as potatoes) and drink lots of water.

If you are over 45, it may likely be peri-menopause.  If you are younger, it might be a hormonal imbalance.

ASAP. This can be caused by a condition known as PCOS ......Polycystic Ovary Syndrome or a hormonal imbalance.     If you've only started your period a year ago then this could also be the cause of this. But my bet is its PCOS or a hormonal imbalance. If your a teenager I would lean more towards it being a hormonal imbalance.     See your doctor or better yet, your GYN.

AA10115021	You may hate to go to the doctor but that's what you MUST do. Something is definitely wrong. Frequent urination could be a sign of diabetes.  The rapid heartbeat could be causing the sweats but what's causing the rapid heartbeat? Not a good thing, particularly at your age. Extreme hunger - are you gaining weight? If not that's another indication that your body has a problem. Please, please, go to the doctor. You are much too young to be having these kinds of problems.

The cells are underdeveloped, like a man's mammary glands, but in some women, the prostate cells release a clear or milky fluid when the woman orgasms.  The cells are located around the urethra,  just as in a man, so a woman might think she is peeing during orgasm, but it's fluid from these underdeveloped prostate cells.|`|7d64b1f34ed0c751dfa72572fff29641aa	what!!!!?|`|AA11485580	cuz we evolved from cows|`|9ed85f5524265551d9d7b8c991c0140caa	Chocolate or regular?

One, milk has a substance that actually leach your calcium away form you... exspecially if you drink too much of it, it can actually cause ostioprosis (can't spell sorry).    Didn't you hear of that teacher who did that experiment with the students, the students learned that if they tryed to drink too much milk in one go they will throw up.    Also, it's BAD for people who have diabeties ... actually it's been known to cause diabeaties...    Anyways,  Unless it's oganic milk, it's VERY VERY unhealthy for you...  Hormones to produce more cow milk,  Growth Hormones,  Anti-Biotics (which can be bad if you DO not need them in the first place).  Other cancer causing chemicals... too.    You're better off getting your calcium from greens like Spinage  & do some weight training to keep your bones building density (get stronger both mucle and bone wise)  ;-)          "Dairy products are a health hazard. They contain no fiber or complex carbohydrates and are laden with saturated fat and cholesterol. They are contaminated with cow's blood and pus and are frequently contaminated with pesticides, hormones, and antibiotics. Dairy products are linked to allergies, constipation, obesity, heart disease, cancer, and other diseases.    milk glassThe late Dr. Benjamin Spock, America's leading authority on child care, spoke out against feeding cow's milk to children, saying it can cause anemia, allergies, and insulin-dependent diabetes and in the long term, will set kids up for obesity and heart disease, America's number one cause of death.    And dairy products may actually cause osteoporosis, not prevent it, since their high-protein content leaches calcium from the body. Population studies, backed up by a groundbreaking Harvard study of more than 75,000 nurses, suggest that drinking milk can actually cause osteoporosis."

Physical restraints are not appropriate unless the patient is aggressive towards other people or destructive to themselves, and even then, there are other methods if you can redirect their thinking. If you have a patient with dementia and they are trying to pull out tubes/IV's, you can give them something else to focus on (have them fold washcloths or do something else that can keep them occupied). Patients with dementia need repetition for ADL's. Make sure you have plenty of patience when working with a patient with dementia... it can be difficult to have to keep saying the same thing over and over... but that's the way it is.|`|AA10793254	You cant teach a patient with dementia anything obviously because they dont have the memory to learn new things.     With the every day living, its best to make things repetitive from day to day as in routine, whilst assisting the patient with the tasks they are unable to carry out.    Such as feeding, toileting and showering etc.    Changing routine or correcting them creates confusion and upset on their part.    Good Luck

Causas  A bromidrose plantar, o popular chul,  causada pelo suor excessivo na planta dos ps e agravada pela falta de higiene.    Vtimas do mau cheiro  O chul n?o escolhe sexo ou idade. Os adolescentes, porm, sofrem mais com o chul. Os horm?nios, que est?o a todo vapor nessa fase da vida, aumentam a transpira??o nos ps. O suor excessivo tambm pode estar relacionado a doen?as como hipertiroidismo, diabetes e obesidade. Em alguns casos, o chul acompanha problemas como micoses, alergias e eczemas. Pois  mas de facto isto podem ser s as consequencias de causas mais profundas e ao mesmo tempo at bem simples de controlar. Como por exemplo o consumo excessivo de carnes vermelhas. pois tendo estas grande quantidade de toxinas, o organismo tende a excreta-las, o que pode tornar o pitu mais apetecivel s bactrias e por sua vez as feses destas causarem os tais odores.    A??o das bactrias  O mau cheiro decorre da a??o de bactrias que se alimentam do suor e de todo material que se encontra sobre a pele. As bactrias est?o presentes na epiderme, a camada superficial da pele.A umidade faz com que elas se proliferem mais rapidamente. Os microrganismos decomp?em o suor excessivo.A decomposi??o  um processo de fermenta??o e libera gases de odor ruim.

AA11743017	Dear TG  Of course.  Infection caused by Kleibsiella in the skin of the auditory canal  Othe cause of that specific odour, is the infection with hemophyllous influenza,  Both can be cures with oral amoxicillin (dose depending on the weight of the baby)  Do not use ear drops. They can only compound an established infection.  Have the baby leaning over(ON) the side of the affected ear, to let it drain any secretions,and watch the pillow for green or yellow stains-  If the ear drum (tympanus) is not yet perforated, this will suffice.  Check first and before any medicine, wheter there is a foreign body in the ear canal (sometimes this simple step is skipped even by experienced people).

AA11103615	Several Anatomy and Physiology textbooks. All agree that, based on medical research (somebody actually dissected cadavers and counted ribs, somebody actually looked at x-rays and counted ribs), men and women have the same number of ribs as each other. For example, one book says:    Twelve pairs of flexible, archlike ribs form the lateral portions of the thoracic cage. They increase in length from the first to the seventh and then decrease again from the eighth to the twelfth.    So from where did the urban legend that women have more ribs come? I dont know for sure, but here is my guess. As I mentioned on my History of Science Web page, back in the Middle Ages, people came up with all sorts of ideas that were commonly thought to be true and were even put into print, but were never tested, never verified. For example, someone decided that that since giraffes had spots, they must result from a cross-breeding between a leopard and a camel, but no one ever actually did anything to check and see if this was really true or possible! I recall reading that a heavily-debated topic back then was the number of teeth that horses have. Numerous people vehemently insisted on a variety of numbers, and no one would or could agree with each other, yet no one ever actually opened a horses mouth and counted its teeth! The notion that women have more ribs than men sounds suspiciously like an idea that could have arisen back then.   So, why would anyone think that? The notion that women have an extra set of ribs is probably based on a misinterpretation of some Bible verses in Genesis. The actual quote is:     But for Adam, no suitable helper was found. So the LORD God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep; and while he was sleeping, he took one of the mans ribs and closed up the place with flesh. Then the LORD God made a woman from the rib he had taken out of the man, and brought her to the man.    Notice what this doesnt say. It doesnt say anything about how many ribs Adam had before or after this surgery, and especially it says nothing, whatsoever, about how many ribs Eve had! Nowhere does it say that Eve had more ribs than Adam. Who made that assumption without checking? Wouldn't it be just as logical to guess (also without checking) that if she was created second that God might have made her with the same number of ribs as the new, reduced number that Adam now had? Wouldnt it really be more logical to guess that God might have created her with the same number of ribs as Adam just to avoid confusion? Genesis doesn't say one way or the other, so the only way to know is to cut open cadavers and start counting. Who has done that  the theologians or the biologists? My guess is that, once again, if human misinterpretations are set aside and if it is remembered that theology looks at why while science looks at how, there is no conflict between what the Bible, itself, is saying and what biologists know to be true about our bodies.    A reader of this Web page sent me an e-mail message with another point worth remembering. If, for example, a person would accidentally lose a finger or would have a body part surgically removed, then subsequently that person would create a baby, that baby would still be born with all his or her body parts. Similarly, if Adam had a rib removed, that does not mean that we, his children, would have missing ribs.    Another reader of this Web page sent me e-mail stating that (s)he had read some religious literature which made the even-more-preposterous claim that men are lopsided, that they are missing a rib on the left side. Would-be theologians who dont do their homework, who dont have high standards for scholarly research before publishing, and who, as a result, publish such misleading information are acting very irresponsibly and only contribute to the poor reputation that religion has among some people in our society. I would encourage publishing companies to insure that articles and books that are submitted for publication are thoroughly peer-reviewed by recognized experts prior to publication. I would encourage seminaries to require a minimum of non-majors biology, anatomy and physiology, and non-majors physics courses as part of their degree programs.|`|ceaa21c6fdfc15a63d5834d986f74c96aa	Males and females have four limbs.

Easy to do -- For squats, get a couple of dumbbells or heavy cans, hold one in each hand, stand with your feet about shoulder-width apart, and bend at the knees until they form a 90-degree angle, squeeze your buttocks hard, then return to your standing position.  Be sure to keep your back straight.  Same starting position for lunges, just take a big step forward and allow yourself to drop until your front leg forms a 90-degree angle (knee bent).  Again, squeeze your buttocks hard, then step forward with the other leg.  Repeat, using the other leg as your "front" leg.|`|5464df66dbae6fc0e00a20df3e4b6768aa	Windsor Pilates..

BUT, you have to squat DEEP - BELOW parallel.  If you do above-parallel squat like most jack-as-ses in the gym, then you will almost completely ellimiate the glutes.  Leg press does works the glutes about 60% as much as a deep squat.    Another note - a lot of people don't like squatting because it is hard.  So if they actually do squat, they don't go very low because they can't put a bunch of weight on the bar.  They use the excuse "they are bad for your knees" - but this is not true.  a deep, below parallel squat can be very theraputic for your knees.  A recent study by a NFL strength coach found that all knee-related injuried drop (some as much as 90%)  when he had the athletes squat well below 90-degrees.|`|2b564cef9343bfa37da58dbdfbb2db78aa	Squats with weights    Lunges with weights|`|AA12022821	ummm dogystyle rump bumping....|`|AA11221532	Anal sex|`|81cdce80c1da86b8fbeb8b8c922ad988aa	I think squats, lunges, and stair stepping.

Yes...a bit of a tricky situation.  Most cities have public libraries.  Sign up for a library card and this will give you somewhere interesting to go that your parents can approve of...and connect you to library sponsored activities.    Look into age appropriate activities you could join...like the girl scouts, or a church group that offers safe, fun activities for you.  Find a hobby that gets you excited...maybe start a journal...a place to record your thoughts and ideas.  You can develop your writing skills.    Maybe someone in your age group will see your question and send you an E-mail address.  Then you can talk to people in your age group...and find out what they do for fun.    You are young...and it is important that you have some fun, social activities that can put you touch with kids your own age.  Join a Choir or Glee Club for example...something along these lines.  Do encourage your parents to allow you to attend school. I hope this gives you some ideas...and wish you the best.|`|5385aa5fd0d900a3997ee20f8a1b9c73aa	Im sorry that you feel that way I've been depressed in the past before it feels awful I hope you can get away from that feeling!Good luck sweetie!Pray alot!

2c84db6774971e42d9637d3e42058884aa	I have had numerous cysts on my ovaries, and everytime that one would burst i would have almost unbearable pain for about an hour, but then it was over like nothing had ever happened.  The doctors told me that they could put me on birth control pills and that would make them stop but i was about 14 at the time and my mom wasnt up for me going on birth control.  So i am now almost seventeen and havent had one in about six months...knock on wood lol.  I have been told that they get better with time because one of my good friends had them but as she got older they became less painful and eventually stopped all together.  Mine first started about six months after i started my period and i think that my body was just trying to adjust to the change.      I dont think that you will have to take off from work for the whole day but i would recommend that you maybe go somewhere that you could relax until the pain is over. But i do understand your concern and i think that if it would make you more comfortable that you could take off because after it is over you feel really drained and tired.|`|6d744cd17e71075c03f4c88865c306abaa	go to the doctor..see if it needs draining...or if 1 day surgery may remove it....not sure...but..I believe that I had read somewhere... the fluids in certain types of cysts..are toxic...not deadly...but will make you very ill|`|7bc6eba64f6b9a2c26012496e1712c28aa	i had one under my tongue.

First things first - there will always be a scar where you remove the mole - how badly depends on you and how your body normally heals. With some people, you don't notice anything. Also, if it's on your face, definitely consider how much it annoys you. If it's a mole you were born with, the color may return so instead you should have it cut out, which includes stitches. When dealing with the face, it's better to go to a plastic surgeon -you'll get better cosmetic results. If it's in your eyebrow, it sounds like you're more concerned about the bump. Shaving the mole off is probably your best bet. Your dermatologist would be the best person to advise you and let you know about hair regrowth in the area.|`|e586bb3cfc9564be7b54ba0b3b87ce3eaa	if you get it removed, your eyebrow will not grow back in its place.

Para parar de fumar:   Ajuste uma data para parar. A cessa??o  melhor sucedida quando se para de uma vez so, e n?o lentamente reduzindo o nmero de cigarros fumados diariamente.     Jogue-os para fora.   Ponha afastado todos os cigarros e fsforos em casa, e no trabalho. Jogue fora cinzeiro e isqueiros.     Compartilhe seu objetivo.   Diga a sua famlia e amigos que voc est parando e pe?a-os apoio.     Evite tentadores.   Evite o lcool, o caf, e outros tentadores para fumar.     Ajuste uma poltica nao fumante.   N?o permita que qualquer um fume em sua casa e evite as pessoas quando est?o fumando.     Utilize de "ferramentas".   Tome vantagens dos acessorios existentes para se parar de fumar: substitutos de nicotina(chiclete de nicotina, ou adesivo), terapia, e aconselhamento.   Menos de 1 em 10 fumantes podem parar sem alguma ajuda. Os pulverizadores e os inalantes nasais de nicotina requerem receita do seu medico, mas nao o chiclete ou adesivo de nicotina. N?o fume ao usar estes produtos.    Receita medica:   Bupropion (Zyban) e o varenicline (Chantix) s?o duas medicacoes de receita que podem ajudar a parar. Comece a toma-las lo apos a data que tenha decidido parar.    Se associe a um grupo de suporte.   Encontre uma fonte de aconselhamento grupal ou individual. Somente aconselhamento pode ajudar, mas e melhor com a combinacao de medicinas ou chicletes-adesivo de nicotina.     Encontre algum suporte via telefone gratuito.      Embora estas medidas possam melhorar suas chances de parar de fumar, existe mais de 50 por cento de chance que um fumante que pare comecara a fumar novamente. Espero que nao aconteca com voce, mas se acontecer, nao desista.

c1614069110bffbb9428677955d485fdaa	N?o ligue para aquelas pessoas estpidas em que vc faz uma pergunta...come esta e respondem que vc j tomou tudo. Essas pessoas tm mentalidade de 7 anos...ou menos.    E esta  a minha resposta    Ecstasy  Origem: Wikipdia, a enciclopdia livre.  Ir para: navega??o, pesquisa     Composi??o qumica do MDMA3,4-methilenedioxido-N-metanfetamina... MDMA (metilenedioxi-metamfetamina), mais conhecido por ecstasy,  uma droga moderna sintetizada, neurotxica, muito popular entre os jovens, cujo efeito na fisiologia humana  o estmulo da secre??o de serotonina, dopamina e noradrenalina no crebro, causando euforia, sensa??o de bem-estar, altera??es da percep??o sensorial do consumidor e grande perda de lquidos. As altera??es ao nvel do tacto promovem o contacto fsico, embora n?o tenha propriedades afrodisacas, como se pensa.     vendido sob a forma de comprimidos e ocasionalmente em cpsulas. Embora estudos mostrem que a neurotoxicidade do ecstasy n?o cause danos permanentes em doses recreativas, ainda SUSPEITA-SE que o consumo de ecstasy cause tais danos a cada dose, e perigo de desenvolvimento de doen?as psicticas (e.g. esquizofrenia). Os estudos a respeito do ecstasy em humanos s?o pouco difundidos por quest?es legais que proibem ministrar doses de MDMA para humanos.    [editar]  Histria  O MDMA foi sintetizado pela Merck em 1914 com a finalidade de ser usado como um redutor do apetite, mas nunca foi usado com essa finalidade. Em 1960, foi redescoberto, sendo indicado como elevador do estado de animo e complemento nas psicoterapias. O uso recreativo surgiu em 1970 nos EUA. Em 1977, foi proibido no Reino Unido e em 1985 nos EUA. O uso do ecstasy concentra-se nas boates, nos ambientes classificados como "rave", onde h aglomera??o noturna em espa?os fechados para dan?a com msica contnua.  popularmente conhecido por "Bala".    [editar]  Experincia     Uma curiosidade das pastilhas  o facto de serem coloridas e baptizadas mediante o desenho impresso, o que permite distingui-las entre si.Dependendo da quantidade ingerida, o MDMA demora tipicamente 30-60 minutos a surtir efeito. Ao contrrio de outros psicoactivos, o efeito do MDMA  muito rpido: muitas vezes quando o consumidor se apercebe que os efeitos est?o a surgir, j estes se encontram muito prximos do pico. A quantidade de MDMA em cada comprimido varia, em mdia, entre 30 e 100 mg, dependendo da pureza da sua composi??o e da tolerancia do consumidor.    A dura??o do efeito  de cerca de 3 a 4 horas, quando ingerido oralmente,podendo ter dura??o de at 06 horas. Existe, porm, um perodo de tempo acrescido associado ao declnio dos efeitos primrios em que o consumidor tem a percep??o da persistncia dos efeitos, embora n?o possam ser considerados a verdadeira experincia, isto , os efeitos primrios. Neste perodo ocorrem frequentemente insnias (devido ao estado de agita??o),coceiras,rea?oes musculares como espasmos involuntrios,espasmos do maxilar,dor de cabe?a,vis?o turva,manchas roxas na pele,movimentos descontrolados de vrios membros principalmente bra?os e pernas.    Durante o perodo de intensidade do ecstasy podem surgir circunstancias perigosas: nuseas, desidrata??o, hipertermia, hiponatrmia. Estes sintomas s?o frequentemente ignorados pelo consumidor devido ao estado de despreocupa??o e bem-estar provocados pela droga, o que pode ocasionar exaust?o, convuls?es e mesmo a morte. Assim, tornou-se frequente ver os consumidores em raves e clubes de dan?a dotados de garrafas de gua ou bebidas energticas.Quando ingerido com bebdas alcoolicas pode ocasionar num choque cardiorrespiratrio levando ao bito.    Em termos de efeitos secundrios, o MDMA provoca frequentemente varia??es de humor nos dias seguintes; alguns indivduos registam perodos depressivos enquanto outros registam aumento de auto-estima. Imediatamente  cessa??o dos efeitos primrios, prevalece tambm a falta de apetite o que deve ser activamente combatido para repor a energia gasta durante as baladas.    O relato de um usurio acerca dos efeitos da droga descreve inicialmente uma sensa??o de tontura semelhante a de embriaguez. Essa sensa??o  a primeira manifesta??o da droga. Em seguida perde-se a sensa??o de peso do corpo, e sente-se como se estivesse flutuando. A partir da todos ao seu redor parecem amigos, e sente-se uma forte atra??o fsica por todos. Cerca de 20 minutos aps a manifesta??o inicial, come?am formigamentos que, segundo relatos, se assemelham a repetitivos orgasmos por todo o corpo. Os efeitos da droga ficam oscilando entre momentos com fortes efeitos, e momentos em que os efeitos passam. Dependendo da quantidade que foi ingerida, quando os efeitos passarem o indivduo vai se sentir desanimado, querendo "voltar pra casa". Ao deitar, os sintomas causados pela febre alta v?o dificultar o adormecimento, e ser?o horas de tremores, suor frio intenso e nuseas, acompanhados de pensamentos frenticos e irrita??o causada pela alta sensibilidade dos sentidos.|`|125693f21089fe7c1a20aae6330dcd7faa	O ecstasy  conhecido com a "Plula do Amor", j que aumenta a concentra??o de um neurotransmissor (substancia responsvel pela comunica??o entre os neur?nios) chamado serotonina.

Se essa compuls?o se d particularmente em "guloseimas", alimentos de algum modo prazerosos (ou socialmente condenveis, "proibidos", "indevidos", a na? ser em quantidades e locais certos), pode haver na compuls?o uma compensa??o na busca do PRAZER.    Eu sugeriria uma observa??o melhor de sua vida emocional, se esta sofreu varia??es, se voc teve episdios depressivos recentes.     Porm, se o comportamento  algo de longo prazo e mais patolgico a seu ver, eu investigaria tambm possveis abalos na fase oral da infancia, de 0 a 2 anos, o que sugeriria acompanhemanto terapeutico.    Tente se dedicar mais a coisas prazerosas, n?o necessariamente orais ou alimentares. E n?o tente reprimir o gosto de uma hora para outra, isso n?o d t?o certo: afinal, certo ou errado, foi assim que voc "aprendeu" a extrair prazer, a dar escape para algo que explodiria de maneira imprevisvel, e sem prazer as pessoas adoecem. O que a sociedade v como mania de um, loucura do outro, compuls?o acol, tique, etc, muitas vezes  a melhor forma que deu para o organismo compensar e se curar de um dano maior, at que a ajuda venha de outra forma, ou a "press?o" re-primida alivie um pouco!!!    Ent?o, ao invs de reprimir, tente dar vaz?o ao prazer em outras formas, com mais qualidade (parques, gua, assistir comdias, dan?ar, praticar esportes, namorar, sexualidade, etc). E quando ainda assim vier a compuls?o, procure conscientizar-se dela, ao invs de enfretar no tapa o "Sr Smith": quando notar a compuls?o, pense a respeito, e de vez em quando permita-se, porm com CONSCINCIA, extraindo ao mximo o prazer de cada fatia ou bala.

Ou seja,  aquele perodo onde qualquer cuidado  pouco!  O mtodo  baseado em ciclos de 28 dias, ou seja, parte do pressuposto de que a sua menstrua??o ocorra a cada 28 dias. A ovula??o, que representa o perodo frtil feminino, acontece no meio deste perodo. Metade de 28  14. Dessa forma, o perodo frtil de uma garota que menstrue a cada 28 dias, ocorre por volta do 14o dia aps o incio da menstrua??o.   Vale lembrar que os espermatozides, aps o ato sexual, podem permanecer vivos na mulher por 2 ou 3 dias e, como os vulos podem ser fecundados at 24 horas depois de liberados, ent?o o perodo frtil pode iniciar um pouco antes do 14o dia, ou se estender para os dias seguintes.   Como os ciclos n?o s?o rigorosamente regulares e iguais  ainda mais na adolescncia, o mtodo da tabelinha n?o  considerado seguro.  Ah, e n?o se esque?a.

O carter, a meiguice. Mas  claro que um rosto bonito e um corpo bem feito ajudam bastante. Para mim, a mulher ideal teria que ter o olhar sonhador, os cabelos longos, seios apontando o infinito, lbios carnudos, cintura escultural salientando as coxas fartas, firmes e bem torneadas|`|b032c5bfa30dc0bfad219b5c4dcfe13baa	Isso  muito relativo, e todos aqui ir?o dizer: "peit?o, bund?o, pern?o....", "tem que ser gostosa...", "mul boa!"....    Toda mulher j nasce com o dom natural de conquistar o homem s pelo fato de existir, n?o importa se  feita ou bonita, magra ou barriguda, sempre um homem ir te querer.    Para conquistar um homem, basta ter uma boa cabe?a, ser gente boa, ou seja: ser voc mesma.    Agora para atrair um homem, acho que esta  a parte mais fcil, em geral, homens gostam de:    Mulheres altas:  Alta significa, menor do que ele, se a mulher  2 a 6 cm mais baixa do que ele, j  considerada alta para ele, acima de 2cm  um monumento de mulher. Monumentos s?o algo problemtico na rela??o, em geral os homens acham bonito e tudo mais, mas na prtica n?o d certo, at mesmo para mulher, quando querem usar aquele salto bsico de 6cm...    Peso:  Isso depende da altura da mulher, logo n?o  aplicvel falar em nmeros exatos, no geral, uns gostam de umas mais cheinhas (n?o digo gordas) e outras das mais magrinhas, tipo modelo porm n?o t?o raquticas o quanto.    Pele:  Quanto a colora??o, j  um gosto muito pessoal, mas como estamos no Brasil, em geral a tendencia  pel  morena clara, mas tal gosto n?o deixa de ser muito pessoal.    Olhos:  Pela opni?o esmagadora do homens, olhos claros... sejam castanhos claro, verdes ou azuis. N?o que olhos escuros n?o tenha seu charme, principalmente com mulheres de pele branca e cabelos igualmente escuros!    Cabelo:  Tambm outra opni?o pessoal, muitos falam de loiras, morenas, ruivinhas... nada que uma tintura n?o resolva.    No final, voc nota que n?o existe a mulher perfeita que agrade todos os homens, acontece at mesmo com as mulheres que s?o capa de revista da playboy, como homem  tapado do jeito que , tudo que sai da playboy os caras j ficam babando e idealizama mulher na cama a seu lado. Ou seja, pode ser loira, morena, azul.... se for "gostosa", manda pra dentro!    E aposto que voc n?o quer "conquistar" um homem s pelo seu corpo, mas sim pelo o que voc realmente tem de melhor para oferecer para ele!|`|8468634d2d51ef7dcb11c0468956743daa	N?o importa a aparncia da mulher, n?o adianta ela ser muito linda se tem crebro de passarinho!|`|866abc171f8a3f0221def29f701abfddaa	homem adora mulher s.fada mas que seje s pra ele aquela mulher tmida e triste j ta fora d moda tome um banho com sabonete bem cheiroso cabelo unhas e roupinha limpa um brilho nos lbios e voc ta linda|`|67420733354b89e4223c32490b650235aa	Para isso n?o tem regra.|`|fc38771aceb5cb3aa8771f11324e221baa	Primeiro voc presciza estar bem com voc mesma, e n?o se preocupar com sua altura peso pele e etc.  Nenhum homem busca perfei??o em nenhuma mulher,pois eles tambem nao sao perfeitos.  N?o existe um PADR?O para uma mulher IDEAL, pois cada mulher tem seu proprio estilo, suas proprias caracteristicas fisicas, fazendo de ns UNICAS.  E sempre existe um homem muito especial para cada uma de nos, e este homem nao ir se preocupar com suas caracteristicas fisicas e sim com as caracteristicas MORAIS.  Porque o que adiante vc ser linda maravilhoza, e sair dando para deus e o mundo?! Os homens nao querem s uma parceira na CAMA e sim uma que ele pode contar confiar e amar inten?amente.  Come?e a dar valor em voc mesma, se olhando mais no espelho e falando EU SOU LINDA EU ME AMO, se todos os dias de manha vc fizer isso vai chegar uma hora que todos que estao ao seu lado vao achar que VC  REALMENTE LINDA E QUE REALMENTE PODE SER AMADA POR ALQUEM.  O eskema  vc estar bem com vc primeiro, pois quando isso acontecer todos que estao ao seu lado vao notar  MULHER MARAVILHOZA QUE VC .

Its actually very easy to lose weight if you follow my weight loss tips.          * Be in right frame of mind        Before you can start any diet program you need to be in the right frame of mind. If you do not feel good about yourself you probably will not want to choose healthy foods. You cannot expect the act of going on a diet to make you feel better about yourself. The only way you can choose to eat a healthy diet to lose weight is if you have a positive self-image.        * Eat whole food        Top weight loss tips        Eat whole foods that are as natural as possible. When you eat whole foods that are full of nutrients your body will know how much to eat and how much not to eat. You do not have to count calories because your body is a wonderful machine.        * Eat fresh fruit        Eat at least two servings of fresh fruit every day. Choose whatever type of fruit is in season.        * Drink enough water        Drink the best weight loss supplement known to man, water. Most people do not know the difference from being hungry for food or thirsty for water. A great deal of times people eat when they should drink. Most likely you will not feel as hungry if you are getting enough water. You will be satisfying the thirst, which is confused for hunger. Water also helps you digest food better. Drinking water before you eat will help fill you up.        * Always chew your food        Always chew your food well. Chewing your food well will ensure that you get the most nutrients out of your food. Getting the most nutrients will satisfy your body therefore you will eat less. Another benefit of chewing well is that it helps aid in digestion.        * Take small meals        Eat small, frequent meals in a day. Large meals tax your digestion system, making it work harder. Taking too much time in between meals makes you hungrier for the next meal.        * Include protein at meal        Include good sources of protein at meal, chicken, fish, legumes, peanut, cottage cheese, eggs or yogurt.        * Shut off TV while eating        Shut off the TV whenever you eat  that includes meals and snacks. Studies show that we automatically eat larger portions when we snack in front of the tube, and typically those foods are high in fat and sugar, which means excess calories!        * Increase your physical activity        Increase your physical activity. Most people are over weight because of a lack of physical activity. Start walking more, bicycling, walks your dog for longer periods of time, swim, dance and leave the car at home when you can. Its important that you choose a physical activity that you enjoy because youll stick with it.|`|7d01b5bc6e3988fafc80aa1e8005d32caa	That sounds like a good weight. I would stay there.|`|AA10668529	Diets aren't good for your age. Try to drink more milk (about 4% fat), add more vegetables and fruits to your daily food. Don't drink refreshments (as coca-cola) only fresh juices. Don't eat junk food and many sweet or ice creams. Eat roast low fat meat and fish. Stay active! Good luck!  Ti

Embora as suas origens sejam desconhecidas pensa-se que ela teve inicio no antigo Egipto, por volta do ano 2300 A.C. A prtica da circuncis?o tem, portanto, cerca de 15000 anos de idade. E era usada pelos  egpcios como forma de puni??o de guerreiros capturados ou de escravos. Como um ritual, foi praticada por astecas, aborgenes australianos e polinsios. A  circuncis?o em judeus tem a sua origem na Bblia, quando Abrah?o foi circuncisado aos 99 anos, como um pacto com Deus. Lus XVI da Fran?a n?o consumou o casamento com Maria Antonieta  por causa da sua fimose, devido  qual tinha erec??es dolorosas, at que foi circuncisado 4 anos depois.         Ela consiste, muito sucintamente, na remo??o cirurgica do prepcio(no homem porque na mulher a circuncis?o leva  remo??o do prepcio clitorial).A tcnica mais comum da circuncis?o neonatal inclui o uso do plastibell ou o clamp de Gomco. A circuncis?o consiste na  ressec??o do capuz de pele redundante seguida de sutura entrecortada da pele peniana com o folheto interno restante de mucosa prepucial.  provavelmente o procedimento cirrgico mais comum em crian?as e como tal o mais frequente na pediatria cirurgica.         Calcula-se que em todo o mundo, 1 em cada 7 homens  circuncisado. No universo islamico e judaico a circuncis?o  ritualmente executada em todos os recm-nascidos masculinos, sendo tambm utilizada em vrias outras culturas.       No mundo ocidental, a taxa de homens circuncisados varia muito de pas para pas. Na Europa a taxa varia entre 4 e 10%. Contudo, na Austrlia e Canad atinge 40% e, nos Estados Unidos da Amrica, 80% dos homens. Essa elevada taxa de circuncisados deve-se a ter sido, nesses pases, fortemente advogada a circuncis?o para todos os recm-nascidos masculinos, a exemplo do que algumas religi?es tradicionais imp?em.       Hoje em dia defende-se uma posi??o muito mais conservadora, mesmo nos Estados Unidos, estando a circuncis?o sem raz?es mdicas ou religiosas, a ser fortemente desencorajada. De facto, uma melhor higiene peniana oferece todas as vantagens da circuncis?o de rotina, sem os inconvenientes funcionais e sexuais inerentes ao procedimento cirrgico. Na verdade, a maior parte dos rapazes aos quais n?o  removida a pele prepucial, n?o ir ter qualquer problema futuro.       As raz?es mdicas em que a circuncis?o pode ser indicada reduzem-se aquelas situa??es em que existe fimose verdadeira e balanite recorrente. Sendo a pele prepucial pode ser a sede de infec??es urinrias, a circuncis?o tambm pode ter indica??o nos rapazes e homens que tenham refluxo vesico-ureteral e anomalias renais significativas. No adulto e no velho, ainda existe outra indica??o, que  a balanite xertica obliterante.       As raz?es religiosas e culturais podem, naturalmente, ser tambm uma indica??o para a circuncis?o. Geralmente ela  solicitada pelos pais ou outros familiares. Embora a circuncis?o seja, nesses casos, quase sempre realizada logo depois do nascimento, pode ser adiada ou n?o realizada por vrias raz?es, nomeadamente por haver qualquer anomalia do pnis, como hipospadia ou corda, em que o prepcio se deve manter para posterior utiliza??o em cirurgia reconstrutiva.       As maiores complica??es da circuncis?o incluem 1% de hemorragias significativas e menos de 1% de outras complica??es, que incluem complica??es anestsicas, les?o peniana por electrocauteriza??o e amputa??o parcial peniana. As complica??es menores podem atingir 5-10% dos operados, compreendendo hemorragia ligeira, infec??o local, lcera do meato, remo??o de excessiva ou inadequada de pele, deiscncia de sutura.       O ps-operatrio  geralmente fcil. Pode utilizar-se um creme ou pomada antibitica, ou simplesmente vaselina aplicada na glande, aps limpeza diria. O doente  geralmente visto pelo cirurgi?o no dia seguinte e cerca de 2-4 semanas depois.         Indica??es comuns para a execu??o da circuncis?o:     - Balanite recorrente   - Fraca higiene   - Infec??es no tracto urinrio   - Raz?es sociais ou religiosas   - Fimose   - Parafimose     Estudos realizados demonstram que as raz?es para a circuncis?o s?o: 80% fimose, sendo que 42.8% tinham fimose congnita, 10% apresentavam parafimose, 27% tinha fimose adquirida e 5% BXO. Cerca de 10% das circuncis?es s?o feitas por motivos religiosos.             Complica??es da cirurgia     - Vmitos   - Infec??es   - Hemorregias   - lcera de meato   - Estenose de meato   - Fstula uretro-cutanea   - Linfedema   - Reten??o urinria   - Fimose ps-circuncis?o   - Morte   - Complica??es da anestesia   - Erros cirrgicos que podem levar  perda da glande ou do pnis inteiro     Muitos homens circuncisados sofrem de:         -Cicatrizes extensas         -Sangramento no local da cicatriz         -Curvatura do pnis         -Erec??o dolorosa         -Dificuldades na ejacula??o         -Impotncia         -Sentimentos de terem sido mutilados     Todos os homens circuncisados perdem alguma ou a maior parte da sensibilidade da glande e toda a sensibilidade do prepcio, que lhe foi amputado.                 Contra-indica??es             -Na vigncia de infec??o urinria, balanopostite ou dermatite amoniacal           -Durante o uso de fraldas, para se evitar, com o meato uretral exposto, aps a cirurgia, as lceras de meato.         CIRCUNCIS?O E RELA??ES COM OUTRAS DOEN?AS     Alguns trabalhos recentes apontam para uma poss|`|826659aa27374b0a38a2f94b96f4be0eaa	Circuncis?o  a extirpa??o (retirada) do prepcio, aquela pele que recobre a glande (a "cabe?a" do pnis).    Ela  feita por um religioso especialmente preparado para isso, chamado "Mohel". O mohel tem tanto forma??o religiosa quanto cirurgica para poder realizar o Bris (circuncis?o).    Como fica, depende muito da habilidade do mohel.    Embora algumas pessoas discursem sobre motivos higinicos, a circuncis?o no judasmo  feita por motivos rituais.    Atualmente vrias sinagogas adotaram o chamado "Shalon Bris" ("Circuncis?o da Paz") onde ao invez da circuncis?o propriamente dita, apenas retira-se uma gota de sangue do prepcio do beb, apenas para cumprir simbolicamente o ritual.

Please go to these websites for details: http://www.amateurwrestler.com/health/ea...  http://diet.ivillage.com/issues/itimingm...    The following healthy living recommendations will help you if youre trying to lose weight, tone up your muscles, have aspirations of building lean muscle mass, are attempting to get a wash board stomach, or just want to feel better:    *1) Burn more calories then you're consuming everyday and measure your results using the following formula: Calories Consumed minus Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) minus Physical Activity minus the Thermic Effect of Food (TEF). A website that explains this formula in more detail and will help you determine how many calories you need to reach or maintain a certain weight is at http://www.primusweb.com/fitnesspartner/...    Get an online, desktop, or cell phone diet and fitness calculator. This will allow you to easily calculate the above formula, set goals, log your daily calorie consumption, and register your physical activities.     Set realistic goals for your ideal body weight. Here are two websites that will calculate a suggested body weight:          Adults: http://www.halls.md/ideal-weight/body.ht...  Teens/Children: http://www.kidshealth.org/kid/exercise/w...    It is difficult and unhealthy to lose more than one or two pounds per week. There are 3,500 calories in a pound. If you eat 500 fewer calories per day for a week you will lose one pound. If you burn through exercise 500 more calories per day for a week you will lose one pound.     Here are two articles on how to break through a weight loss plateau:  http://www.webmd.com/content/article/86/...  http://www.webmd.com/content/pages/18/10...    *2) Eat natural and organic foods found on earth versus something created by a corporation to make money. Eat meals in small portions throughout the day and take a good multi-vitamin supplement.     Do not try fad diets or diet pills. Avoid High Glycemic Load Carbs (sugar, pastries, desserts, refined starches such as breads, pasta, refined grains like white rice; high starch vegetables such as potatoes) and drink lots of water.

I made a rule that I had to vacuum, clean, iron or whatever for 15 minutes.  When the 15 minutes is up you can quit if you want to, but surprisingly, you will probably continue doing whatever it is.  I found it is the getting started that was the worst part.  Once you start accomplishing things you will be more motivated.  I never need the timer anymore and I am no longer lazy.  I call this "The 15 Minute Challenge" and it has worked for my kids and friends as well.  Good luck, I hope this works for you!|`|01d952017a78f86d6a17cfdd53ad5a95aa	if you figure it out let me know

AA10213236	Go to the food network website and look for healthy recipies, like salads, seafood dishes, and fruit.  http://www.foodnetwork.com/food/lf_healt...  Remember to eat a good breakfast, lite lunch , and healthy dinner and make sure you finish eating at least 3 hrs before you go to sleep at night.  It really does help!|`|AA12056708	Prepackaged meals are rarely healthy.  They're full of preservatives, overprocessed, laden with salt, and generally just not the best food choices.      And anything with the world "Helper" in it is crap.  :-P  Not diet food!    Tuna salad is FULL of mayo by the way.  This is a very calorie dense food, so you can't have more than a small amount of it.   Maybe a few ounces of tuna salad plus a nice serving of regular salad w/lowcal dressing?    You need to eat sensibly.   Buy most of your foods from the outer aisles of the store; this is where the fresh foods are kept.       Think about replacing foods.  For example replace cheapo white bread with a quality whole grain to cut calories and protect your glycemic (blood sugar) index.  Replace candy with whole fresh fruit.      Before you try to lose your 30 lbs, look at the nutrition section of your bookstore.   A starvation diet of mostly TV dinners is doomed to fail.   A slow phase out of junky foods for better ones = best chances of success.|`|9fa1adb1c8a5e488f13a34915c1381ceaa	If you really want to develop healthy eating habits you will have to learn to do some cooking, and it really isn't that hard. All processed food, even the stuff that says "diet" or "lean" on it, is less healthy than fresh, home-prepared food. Most foods that are truly good for you, don't even need any prep. (or not much) How about a lunch of fresh raw veggies, with some lite ranch dressing, and a hard-boiled egg? Not much cooking there, and very healthy. Lean sliced deli turkey & sprouts with spicy mustard in a pita pocket is no cooking at all. Fresh fruit for a snack - no cooking there. Just go through the produce section at the store and look around, you will find lots of things to eat that require little or no prep. Tuna is good, but forgret the helper, its loaded with fat and starch. Drain the tuna, dump it in a bowl and add a small amout of lite mayo, relish, salt & pepper. You can do this. Good luck.|`|AA11371298	walmart go there|`|2dfe4e10f22ec8e7d8cf0c053d012909aa	you should buy lots of fruits then you would not have to cook that often.

Sufferers find that by cutting out particular types of food such as dairy or gluten they reduce their symptoms, or they may find that they have certain 'trigger' foods that always set off symptoms.  One way to find out what foods are hurting you is to follow an exclusion diet, where you gradually cut out different foods for a week or so and see if you feel better. This should be carried out with the help of a nutritionist to make sure you dont end up with a diet that hurts you more than it helps!  Esdifan is a revolutionary, natural nutritional supplement designed to treat these problems.

"LDN may well be the most important therapeutic breakthrough in over fifty years. It provides a new method of medical treatment by mobilizing the natural defenses of one's own immune system." David Gluck, MD    Low Dose Naltrexone  FDA-approved naltrexone, in a low dose, can boost the immune system  helping those with MS,TM, HIV/AIDS, cancer, autoimmune diseases, and central nervous system disorders.    In May 2006, clinical trial researchers at Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine reported: "LDN therapy offers an alternative safe, effective, and economic means of treating subjects with active Crohn's disease."    Here is a list of what LDN stops the Progression in....    What diseases has it been useful for and how effective is it?  > Bernard Bihari, MD, as well as other physicians and researchers, have described beneficial effects of LDN on a variety of diseases:  Cancers: Other Diseases:  Bladder Cancer  Breast Cancer  Carcinoid  Colon & Rectal Cancer  Glioblastoma  Liver Cancer  Lung Cancer (Non-Small Cell)  Lymphocytic Leukemia (chronic)  Lymphoma (Hodgkin's and Non-Hodgkin's)  Malignant Melanoma  Multiple Myeloma  Neuroblastoma  Ovarian Cancer  Pancreatic Cancer  Prostate Cancer (untreated)  Renal Cell Carcinoma  Throat Cancer  Uterine Cancer  ALS (Lou Gehrig's Disease)  Alzheimer's Disease  Autism Spectrum Disorders  Behcet's Disease  Celiac Disease  Chronic Fatigue Syndrome  Crohn's Disease  Emphysema (COPD)  Endometriosis  Fibromyalgia  HIV/AIDS  Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)  Multiple Sclerosis (MS)  Parkinson's Disease  Pemphigoid  Primary Lateral Sclerosis (PLS)  Psoriasis  Rheumatoid Arthritis  Sarcoidosis  Systemic Lupus (SLE)  Transverse Myelitis  Ulcerative Colitis  Wegener's Granulomatosis      How does LDN work?  > LDN boosts the immune system, activating the body's own natural defenses.  Up to the present time, the question of "What controls the immune system?" has not been present in the curricula of medical colleges and the issue has not formed a part of the received wisdom of practicing physicians. Nonetheless, a body of research over the past two decades has pointed repeatedly to one's own endorphin secretions (our internal opioids) as playing the central role in the beneficial orchestration of the immune system, and recognition of the facts is growing.    Witness these statements from a review article of medical progress in the November 13, 2003 issue of the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine: "Opioid-Induced Immune Modulation: .... Preclinical evidence indicates overwhelmingly that opioids alter the development, differentiation, and function of immune cells, and that both innate and adaptive systems are affected.1,2 Bone marrow progenitor cells, macrophages, natural killer cells, immature thymocytes and T cells, and B cells are all involved. The relatively recent identification of opioid-related receptors on immune cells makes it even more likely that opioids have direct effects on the immune system.3"    The brief blockade of opioid receptors between 2 a.m. and 4 a.m. that is caused by taking LDN at bedtime each night is believed to produce a prolonged up-regulation of vital elements of the immune system by causing an increase in endorphin and enkephalin production. Normal volunteers who have taken LDN in this fashion have been found to have much higher levels of beta-endorphins circulating in their blood in the following days. Animal research by I. Zagon, PhD, and his colleagues has shown a marked increase in metenkephalin levels as well. [Note: Additional information for Dr. Zagon can be found at the end of this page.]    Bihari says that his patients with HIV/AIDS who regularly took LDN before the availability of HAART were generally spared any deterioration of their important helper T cells (CD4+).    In human cancer, research by Zagon over many years has demonstrated inhibition of a number of different human tumors in laboratory studies by using endorphins and low dose naltrexone. It is suggested that the increased endorphin and enkephalin levels, induced by LDN, work directly on the tumors' opioid receptors  and, perhaps, induce cancer cell death (apoptosis). In addition, it is believed that they act to increase natural killer cells and other healthy immune defenses against cancer.    In general, in people with diseases that are partially or largely triggered by a deficiency of endorphins (including cancer and autoimmune diseases), or are accelerated by a deficiency of endorphins (such as HIV/AIDS), restoration of the body's normal production of endorphins is the major therapeutic action of LDN.      LDN comes highly recommended and it is the only drug that can halt MS in its tracks. No other MS drug can do that. They promise only a 30% chance of slowing down your MS. LDN stopps it completely! Some doctors and thousands of patients think it is the best new drug in over 50 years!

Good luck and I hope all works out!|`|AA10296217	If your iron goes down, you'll end up with anemia--a condition in which you have too few red blood cells; a symptom of anemia is breathlessness and palor.    Could you have rheumatoid arthritis--this is an autoimmune disorder in which the body's own immune system attacks the areas of the jjoints, causing stiffness and pain.    If your pain is accompanied by fatigue that is chronic i.e. doesn't go away after 3 or more months, you may have a condition called fibromyalgia or chronic fatigue syndrome, both of which may be accompanied by the symptoms you describe.  both of these condtions are sometimes characterized by a sudden onset--i.e. people appear fine one day and the next week, have come down with it. Additionally, these two syndromes affect far more women than men.    Lastly, have you been exposed to any environmental chemicals to which you are allergic like tobacco smoke, aerosols, paints etc. In people who have Multiple Chemical Sensitivities, they are hyper-sensitive to these chemicals and develop a fever and general feelings of malaise (sickness).|`|2faa2ad4ad6b088e311e4c7d5b52b7c3aa	I had those same signs and I went to hospital they said my kidney's were failing.

It means simply ,"pain in muscular tissues. It is a chronic(ongoing) condition of pain, stiffness, and usually fatigue.  It affects several million people in the U.S., more common in younger adults, and more women have it than men.  Pain is the MAIN symptom,  the aches, pains, stiffness in the muscles and joints vary from day to day or week to week.  I hope this helps.  See your health care provider.

cc549f80e4095392c803b080654eda56aa	Many things can cause irritability. Stress and hormones are two of the biggest causes. It may help to start keeping track of when you get irritable and what triggers it. Writing it down in a brief jornal format may help you discover a pattern that would otherwise go undetected.     Once you have a general idea of what gets to you, it wouldn't hurt to talk to someone, maybe join a stress management or anger management course. After my divorce, I had a lot of anger and I noticed I started taking it out on my son a lot. I would get really irritable and snap at him a lot. I took an anger management course for a few months and it really helped. They teach you techniques on how to avoid and diffuse stressful situations.

Next, take the alarm clock and put it on the other side of the room. This way you have to get out of bed to turn it off. Now set the alarm to a sound that you hate whether it's the alarm or a radio station you can't stand. Not only will it be on other side of the room, it will be playing something you can't stand which is additional motivation to get out of bed.    Also, If you like coffee you can also set the coffee maker to start making coffe at a certain time. Sometimes this helps people wake up as well.

AA10503960	Rince your mouth with a good antiseptic mouthwash after eating to keep sore clear of negative bacteria.....    Some Effective home Remedies are:   Ingredients: Baking soda  Instructions: For canker sore , mix 1 teaspoon of baking soda with 1/2 cup of warm water. Use this mixture as a mouthwash 3-6 times a day (it may sting), especially after meals and before going to bed. note: baking soda contains high levels of sodium, rinse your mouth thoroughly if sodium intake is a concern.   Ingredients: Apple Cider Vinegar  Instructions: Mix 1/2 cup of warm water, Swish around in mouth for 30-60 seconds 2 times a day and your canker sore will go away quickly!   Ingredients: Onion  Instructions: Apply raw onion on sore    Ingredients: Salt water  Instructions: Mix 2 tablespoon of salt in 1 glass of warm water. Use this as a mouth rinse 3-4 times a day. The salt will draw fluid from the canker helping it to heal more quickly.   Ingredients: Baking soda   Instructions: Make a paste of baking soda and apply directly to the sore (may sting a bit).   Ingredients: Aloe Vera Gel  Instructions: Apply 2 tablespoon of Aloe vera gel to canker sore. Repeat 3 times a day.

In very vulnerable people, they'll hurt like heck. They will go away on their own in 10 to 14 days. But you probably don't want to live with pain for that long, so here's what you can do.     Cover it with hydrocortisone. A prescription gel or paste containing hydrocortisone will seal off the canker sore and make you feel better and usually speed the healing, says D'Anne Kleinsmith, M.D., a dermatologist in private practice in West Bloomfield, Michigan.     Rub some salve on the sore. Over-the-counter ointments, such as Zilactin or Blistex, will coat the sore and sterilize it to some extent, Dr. Shapira says. Ointments will at least numb the pain so you can eat more easily.     Try a Kaopectate quencher. For a canker sore or any other minor mouth pain, mix equal parts of Kaopectate with Benadryl elixir, both of which you can find at pharmacies, says Louis M. Abbey, D.M.D., a professor of oral pathology at Virginia Commonwealth University/ Medical College of Virginia School of Dentistry in Richmond. Swish the concoction in your mouth for at least a minute before eating, to soothe your mouth. The Benadryl numbs the pain, while the Kaopectate helps the anesthetic stick to the inside of your mouth, he explains.     Soothe it with saline. Rinsing your mouth with some salt water several times a day will help ease the pain from a canker sore, Dr. Shapira says. Mix a teaspoon of salt in an eight-ounce glass of warm water and swish it around in your mouth.     Don't eat the acid. Spicy or highly acidic foods like tomatoes and citrus juices will burn and irritate the ulceration. Avoid them until the sore heals, Dr. Shapira says.     Lysine gets the red out? Several years ago, researchers showed some interest in treating canker sores with supplements of the amino acid lysine. "It works for some people and doesn't work for others," Dr. Shapira says. Check with your doctor before taking any supplements on your own.     Handle with care. Because your hand can slip while you're vigorously or hastily brushing your teeth, take your time and gently go through your oral hygiene routines, dentists say.     Good luck!
8c7d3562a68c6c4d8e097fff0538cf5faa	is that 180 pounds or 180 kilos?  first answer, is that pushups do a range of muscles, its a compound movement (it uses more than one muscle, an isolation exercise isolated that muscle,such as preacher curls,lateral raise etc). pushups work the shoulders,mainly the anterior(front), head of the shoulders,that small lumpy bit at the front of your shoulder.it also works the chest and triceps.  incline,on more of a slope,will target more of the upper chest area,and will concentrate on more of the chest,not so much the triceps.  it depends what you want to work really.you may have a strong chest althought weaker triceps,this is maybe why you cannot do that many pushups.   also,strength does not have a direct correlation with muscle stamina. you may be able to bench 200 pounds,or 90 kilos,but not able to keep that up for over 10 reps. if you want to do a lot of pushups or reps,concentrate on a program that included high reps,high sets, and lower weights.  this will give you muscle stamina|`|2bab7047ef7c34f7d4027e5d8a7eff79aa	there is a difference in the muscles you use between the pushups read tips on some great workouts that will help you on this site|`|e6f1de5544fee8deac05b3eed1aa1567aa	Great job on the 50 pushups! That's impressive for a female.  My max last month was 60.  You are working the chest, shoulders, triceps. biceps, abdominals, quads and deltoid muscles when you do a pushup.  When you change the level of them (regular, incline or even decline) you are adding resistance to the exercise making your muscles work harder and you will reach muscle failure quicker.  The Bench Press works basically the same muscles except for the quads.  For increased resistance on the bench press you can also do them inclined or declined.

67aa281b701f545a96fd441433dd4c0faa	It continues to amaze and irritate me that these kinds of stories appear so frequently among lay people.  Maybe the comment by the physician was said in jest, or the patient didn't quite catch the context of the statement that was uttered by the physician.  Or just maybe the physician was having a bad day, month, year, or life.    At any rate, if that statement was made, it is, in my humble opinion, irresponsible, at the least.    Physicians are trained to be non-judgemental, but they are only human too.    The cause of any cancer is a combination of factors which, at the level of the molecular machinery of a cell, cause that cell to begin to divide uncontrollably.  Errors appear in the DNA (genes) of the cell and it just becomes a cell that "can't say no" to continuously divide.  Thus, a tumor forms and as the tumor grows larger, more errors occur, and the behavior of the cells is no longer helpful to the person, but harmful.    When we understand that each of our bodies is made up of trillions of cells, yes, thousands of billions, it is a wonder that more cells do not become tumors than do.    The body has mechanisms for dealing with these abnormal cells, but for reasons still unknown completely, these mechanisms allow the tumor to progress.    The more rapidly a cell type divides normally in the body, the more often those cell types become cancerous.    Thus, in women there is a relatively high incidence of breast cancer, and in men, prostate cancer.    There are many factors that are associated with a higher incidence of cancer in certain ethnic groups, but as to the certain cause of one individual's cancer, medical science is simply not sophisticated enough to make that determination yet.  It may never get to that level of sophistication.    So, take good care of your body, it is the only one you will get in your lifetime.  And the same goes for me and for any other person.

AA10564932	For whatever personality you have at present, your emotions will always be there. Someone who has lost his/her emotion is dead...     I think, with you having borderline personality, your emotions would vary time after time. Try to imagine the peoplw who are more mentally and emotionally disturbed than you. They'd laugh and soon you'd find them crying... So that proves it...|`|AA10378559	Just the opposite, I think, emotions are overabundant; yet true feelings may be less than emotions show. I've a stepdaughter who has borderline personality disorder. She is very gushing, loves everybody, yet when it comes to it, there is little love for anyone, and none for herself. She is doing  better since marrying a year ago, yet takes to times of disappearing and driving her husband wild about it. But I don't think emotions are lost, they are only focused in a way that is not real or totally good for the individual when they focus on some thing or someone who may not be good for the individual. My daughter had a string of boy friends, a couple who pimped her, all to keep their drug  habits, as well as hers. When she disappears now she goes off the wagon with some druggie friend or another she keeps up with. It's sad, really.    Her mother and I haven't been able to do much for her--as counseling is very expensive, very intensive and long-term, and very iffy. We've tried to be there and love her, and we've been supportive of her marriage. She calls about daily and we're 800 miles away now, having moved to our retirement place in the mountains.

36629c24a394389070f2cb6ad21ed239aa	if you diet and change to a healthy life style|`|AA12308795	Yes but how much depends mostly on what you eat. Diets do not work. 99% of people gain the weight back. Here is how it works. No one teaches the animal what to eat and what not to eat. He knows instinctively what to eat. Humans also have the same instinct. The way it works is just eat whatever tastes good and that will be healthy for you and non-fattening. That is why a baby tastes everything. So again whatever tastes good, is good for you. This is why you will spit out spoiled milk.    But wait!!! Man has the technology to create rat poison. It tastes like healthy food (good taste) but kills the rat. So man has done that to you. Note- any food unaltered by man (uncooked) that tastes good, is good for you. So if you are stranded in the woods, that is how you  know what to eat (cooking changes that). So man has created fake fruit. It tastes like fruit that exists in nature but it is terrrible for health, addictive and fattening called sweets.    So it is natural  to like real sweets called fruit, like a baby does, but they have fooled you just like the rat. But they do not want to kill you. They want you to become obese so you will buy lots of their foods. This is called GOOD BUSINESS.

efcd7b39cbaf01bd9ef001b6b250f240aa	Try adjusting your sleep schedule 1 or 2 hours earlier each night.  One hour earlier each night is best, but since you only have 3 days to do it, you'll have to do two hours earlier for a couple nights.  Also, get up early, even if you have trouble getting to sleep.  This will encourage your body to feel sleepy earlier.  If you have trouble waking up, getting more light in your room in the morning will help.  Putting your alarm on the other side of the room is a good idea, too.    Also, have a bedtime routine that gets you ready to sleep.  Lower the lights and avoid the computer before bed.  The lights make your body think it's still daytime.  Don't watch TV if it keeps you awake.  Do something relaxing before bed.  Writing a journal can get worries off your mind that keep you awake.    Foods like turkey will tend to make you sleepy, but try not to eat in the 3 hours before bedtime.  A little milk before bed can help, though.  Don't drink caffeine in the afternoon and evening, it can make it hard for you to sleep.  Too much of any liquid toward the end of the day will also cause yo to get up to use the restroom and hurt your sleep.    Make sure your bed is comfortable to sleep on.  Keep your room very dark during your sleep hours.  I've also heard that keeping your head cool and your body warm at night gives you the best sleep.  Another thing I've read is that exercise in the early afternoon will encourage sleepiness at bedtime.    If you still have trouble getting to sleep, but are worried about taking sleep medicine, there are medicines that are not habit-forming.  Tylenol PM has the same medicine as Benadryl (antihistamine for allergies) plus pain reliever, so you can take one of those two instead of the more serious stuff.  Bonus for people with allergies: no sneezing, itching, or wheezing to keep you awake ( I have this problem sometimes.)|`|AA10740824	Same here. My schedule is bad.

After your bath, have a warm drink (not caffinated), and a short bedtime story.  Really any reading would be great as long as it is not too stimulating for your brain. If you do this your body will see this as time to go to sleep and it won't fight you as much.|`|AA12367941	Just do things which make you tired during the day & don't nap.

Good Luck.|`|1fad4cff1b4a7560be1a8dbd3e6e5ba7aa	There is a nutritional supplement/sleep aid called melatonin that is actually a naturally occurring chemical in the brain.     Avoid any sugar, chocolate, caffeine for a few days.  If you are used to lots of caffeine, you may get a caffeine withdrawal headache.      Force yourself to get up early after going to bed late, avoid the caffeine, etc. and don't take any naps.  You should be plenty tired by 9 or 10 p.m.

AA11808736	O transplante de medula ssea  uma modalidade teraputica que visa o tratamento da doen?a com uso de altas doses de agentes quimioterpicos associados ou n?o  radioterapia corporal. A reconstitui??o hematopotica do paciente  feita pela infus?o de clulas viveis da medula ssea ou do sangue perifrico. Estas clulas marcam-se fenotipicamente como CD34+ e tem uma alta capacidade proliferativa.    Existem trs tipos de transplante: o alognico, o autlogo e o singnico. No transplante alognico, a medula ssea  retirada de uma doador previamente selecionado por testes de histocompatibilidade, normalmente identificado entre os familiares ou em bancos de medula ssea. No transplante autlogo, a medula ssea ou as clulas tronco perifricas s?o retiradas do prprio paciente, armazenadas e reinfundidas aps o regime de condicionamento. O transplante de medula ssea entre gmeos univitelinos  denominado singnico. Mais recentemente, o transplante com clulas do cord?o umbilical vem sendo empregado em alguns centros de forma experimental.    Durante duas a trs semanas aps a infus?o da medula, o paciente permanece em aplasia medular intensa (fase em que os leuccitos, glbulos vermelhos e plaquetas permanecem baixos) quando ainda n?o ocorreu a enxertia. A neutropenia severa predisp?e  infec??es bacterianas, fngicas, virais e protozorios. Aps este perodo, os leuccitos come?am a aparecer no sangue perifrico, demonstrando a recupera??o medular.  Qualquer pessoa com boa sade entre 18 e 55 anos poder ser um doador de Medula ssea. Ser coletada uma amostra do sangue para realiza??o de sorologia e tipagem HLA (exame que identifica sua gentica). Os resultados ser?o armazenados em nossos computadores. Caso haja um paciente compatvel, o doador ser convocado para a realiza??o de outros testes de comprova??o. Se a compatibilidade for comprovada, o doador ser chamado para a doa??o da Medula ssea.

Na medula ssea s?o produzidos os componentes do sangue: as hemcias (glbulos vermelhos), os leuccitos (glbulos brancos) e as plaquetas. Pelas hemcias, o oxignio  transportado dos pulm?es para as clulas de todo o nosso organismo e o gs carb?nico  levado destas para os pulm?es, a fim de ser expirado. Os leuccitos s?o os agentes mais importantes do sistema de defesa do nosso organismo, inclusive nos defende das infec??es. As plaquetas comp?em o sistema de coagula??o do sangue.    Qual a diferen?a entre medula ssea e medula espinhal?Enquanto a medula ssea, como descrito anteriormente,  um tecido lquido que ocupa a cavidade dos ossos, a medula espinhal  formada de tecido nervoso que ocupa o espa?o dentro da coluna vertebral e tem como fun??o transmitir os impulsos nervosos, a partir do crebro, para todo o corpo.    O que  transplante de medula ssea?   um tipo de tratamento proposto para algumas doen?as malignas que afetam as clulas do sangue. Ele consiste na substitui??o de uma medula ssea doente, ou deficitria, por clulas normais de medula ssea, com o objetivo de reconstitui??o de uma nova medula. O transplante pode ser autognico, quando a medula ou as clulas precursoras de medula ssea provm do prprio indivduo transplantado (receptor). Ele  dito alognico, quando a medula ou as clulas provm de um outro indivduo (doador). O transplante tambm pode ser feito a partir de clulas precursoras de medula ssea obtidas do sangue circulante de um doador ou do sangue de cord?o umbilical.    Quando  necessrio o transplante?  Em doen?as do sangue como a Anemia Aplstica Grave e em alguns tipos de leucemias, como a Leucemia Mielide Aguda, Leucemia Mielide Cr?nica, Leucemia Linfide Aguda. No Mieloma Mltiplo e Linfomas, o transplante tambm pode estar indicado.Anemia Aplstica:  uma doen?a que se caracteriza pela falta de produ??o de clulas do sangue na medula ssea. Apesar de n?o ser uma doen?a maligna, o transplante surge como uma sada para 'substituir' a medula improdutiva por uma sadia.Leucemia:  um tipo de cancer que compromete os glbulos brancos (leuccitos), afetando sua fun??o e velocidade de crescimento. O transplante surge como uma forma de tratamento complementar aos tratamentos convencionais.    Como  o transplante para o doador?  Antes da doa??o, o doador faz um exame clnico para confirmar o seu bom estado de sade. N?o h exigncia quanto  mudan?a de hbitos de vida, trabalho ou alimenta??o. A doa??o  feita por meio de uma pequena cirurgia, de aproximadamente 90 minutos, em que s?o realizadas mltiplas pun??es, com agulhas, nos ossos posteriores da bacia e  aspirada a medula. Retira-se um volume de medula do doador de, no mximo, 10%. Esta retirada n?o causa qualquer comprometimento  sade. Leia mais informa??es sobre a doa??o de medula.    Como  o transplante para o paciente?  Depois de se submeter a um tratamento que destri a prpria medula, o paciente recebe a medula sadia como se fosse uma transfus?o de sangue. Essa nova medula  rica em clulas chamadas progenitoras, que, uma vez na corrente sangnea, circulam e v?o se alojar na medula ssea, onde se desenvolvem. Durante o perodo em que estas clulas ainda n?o s?o capazes de produzir glbulos brancos, vermelhos e plaquetas em quantidade suficiente para manter as taxas dentro da normalidade, o paciente fica mais exposto a episdios infecciosos e hemorragias. Por isso, deve ser mantido internado no hospital, em regime de isolamento. Cuidados com a dieta, limpeza e esfor?os fsicos s?o necessrios. Por um perodo de 2 a 3 semanas, necessitar ser mantido internado e, apesar de todos os cuidados, os episdios de febre s?o quase uma regra no paciente transplantado. Aps a recupera??o da medula, o paciente continua a receber tratamento, s que em regime ambulatorial, sendo necessrio, por vezes, o comparecimento dirio ao hospital.     Quais os riscos para o paciente?  A boa evolu??o durante o transplante depende de vrios fatores: o estgio da doen?a (diagnstico precoce), o estado geral do paciente, boas condi??es nutricionais e clnicas, alm,  claro, do doador ideal. Os principais riscos se relacionam s infec??es e s drogas quimioterpicas utilizadas durante o tratamento. Com a recupera??o da medula, as novas clulas crescem com uma nova 'memria' e, por serem clulas da defesa do organismo, podem reconhecer alguns rg?os do indivduo como estranhos. Esta complica??o, chamada de doen?a enxerto contra hospedeiro,  relativamente comum, de intensidade varivel e pode ser controlada com medicamentos adequados. No transplante de medula, a rejei??o  rara.     Quais os riscos para o doador?  Os riscos s?o poucos e relacionados a um procedimento cirrgico que necessita de anestesia geral, sendo retirada do doador a quantidade de medula ssea necessria (menos de 10%). Esta pequena cirurgia tem dura??o de aproximadamente 90 minutos e consiste de 4 a 8 pun??es na regi?o plvica posterior para aspira??o da medula. Dentro de poucas semanas, a medula ssea do doador estar inteiramente recuperada. Uma avalia??o pr-operatria detalhada avalia as condi??es clnicas e cardiovasculares do doador visando a orientar a equipe anestsica envolvida no procedimento operatrio.    O que  compatibilidade?  Para que se realize um transplante de medula  necessrio que haja uma total compatibilidade tecidual entre doador e receptor. Caso contrrio, a medula ser rejeitada. Esta compatibilidade tecidual  determinada por um conjunto de genes localizados no cromossoma 6.

61fca05fbd88ba435c53554bd162087daa	 uma ferida nas mucosas da boca, principalmente na lngua, nos lbios e na parede das bochechas, Raramente surge nas gengivas e no cu da boca. s vezes, no lugar de uma afta isolada explodem vrias ao mesmo tempo.         Em geral est ligada a distrbios como diarria e m digest?o. No entanto, certos indivduos tm aftas depois de uma febre alta ou porque est?o estressados. Em algumas mulheres, elas aparecem durante o perodo menstrual. As feridas podem ainda ser uma rea??o a antibiticos e antiinflamatrios, remdios que liberam substancias cidas no es?fago. Algumas pessoas tm maior predisposi??o para o problema e por isso suspeita-se que a afta seja hereditria.         Frutas cidas como o abacaxi, assim como temperos picantes - ketchup, pimenta, mostarda, molho de tomate, vinagre, entre outros -, podem funcionar como fatores desencadeantes, mas s em quem apresenta uma tendncia para o problema.     CARACTERSTICAS   As aftas surgem na maioria das vezes em pessoas saudveis;   A afta comum n?o provoca febre nem mau hlito;   N?o tem cura definitiva,  um problema que vai e volta;   N?o  transmissvel de uma pessoa para outra;   As feridas s?o limpas, pois n?o h nelas fungos ou bactrias que desencadearam o problema.         O CICLO DA AFTA       Desaparecem espontaneamente entre sete e dez dias.       As aftas costumam acompanhar o estresse. s vezes, elas castigam as frias de quem resolve experimentar pratos diferentes daquilo que est acostumado a comer. Apesar de os mdicos n?o entenderem os motivos, muitas mulheres que sofriam do problema de tempos em tempos relatam o seu sumi?o depois da gravidez. Assim como existem ex-fumantes que garantem ter come?ado a apresentar aftas com freqncia depois de abandonar o vcio - mas, aqui, outra vez, o estresse pode estar por trs, uma vez que n?o costuma ser fcil para os dependentes do tabaco a adapta??o a uma vida sem fuma?a.         TRATAMENTO        individualizado, visando aliviar os sintomas, prevenir o aparecimento de novas aftas e diminuir a gravidade do surto. Bicarbonato de sdio: serve para diminuir a dor, pois destri as clulas nervosas responsveis por ela. Faz a afta demorar ainda mais a desaparecer. O bicarbonato destri os tecidos saudveis da mucosa.         Voc n?o vai encontrar nas farmcia nenhum remdio capaz de curar a afta, apenas produtos que podem aliviar seus sintomas. Existem pomadas que formam uma pelcula protetora sobre a ferida para que os alimentos n?o fiquem esbarrando nela e piorando o tormento. Outros medicamentos agem especificamente contra a dor local. Claro que qualquer medica??o s pode ser indicada por um especialista.         O prpolis pode ajudar - apesar de a ferida arder mais no primeiro contato com esses produtos, o desconforto da afta parece aliviar em seguida. Aten??o: vrios estudos recentes indicam que a prpolis pode, sim, ajudar na cicatriza??o dessas les?es. O bicarbonato de sdio tambm  comumente usado, melhor sendo fazer bochechos com uma solu??o de 1 colher de ch dessa substancia para 1 xcara cheia de gua, em vez de pass-la diretamente sobre a ferida.         Quem tem propens?o para aftas deve evitar consumir frutas e condimentos cidos e, na medida do possvel, combater o estresse. N?o coma alimentos cidos capazes de agravar a situa??o. Nunca passe metiolate ou mercuriocromo sobre a ferida. Esses remdios s?o agressivos para esse tipo de les?o.         Antiinflamatrio corticide:  muito usado em bochechos ou em pomadas apropriadas. H tambm inje??es antiinflamatrias que s?o aplicadas sobre a les?o.         A aplica??o de substancias custicas, como o formol, sobre as aftas destri o tecido da regi?o, inclusive as termina??es nervosas, o que faz desaparecer a dor. Entretanto, o que se faz  substituir a afta por uma queimadura qumica, que causa injria a tecidos normais. Alm disso, h risco de maiores danos pela inadequada manipula??o dos produtos por parte dos usurios. N?o se recomenda tal prtica.     DICAS       Desconfie sempre daquelas aftas que nunca cicatrizam, e perduram por 20 a 30 dias. Nesse caso,  preciso avaliar se n?o h uma doen?a mais grave por trs, como herpes ou at mesmo Aids. Os fumantes e pessoas que gostam de bebidas fortes, tipo uisque e vodka, precisam analisar as aftas com cuidado porque correm o risco de desenvolver tumores malignos na boca.         O cancer de boca, ou carcinoma epidermide, freqentemente come?a como uma les?o ulcerada. Por isso, frente a uma lcera bucal que n?o cicatriza dentro de 15 dias, o paciente deve procurar o cirurgi?o-dentista para o diagnstico da les?o. Alm disso, algumas doen?as infecciosas, como o herpes, e algumas doen?as dermatolgicas com ocorrncia intrabucal, como o lpus, embora tenham caractersticas prprias bem conhecidas, em certas fases de seu desenvolvimento podem parecer-se com aftas, principalmente para o leigo.|`|05f96161a53bdc7a144104e0e75afc6caa	 uma ferida nas mucosas da boca, principalmente na lngua, nos lbios e na parede das bochechas, Raramente surge nas gengivas e no cu da boca. s vezes, no lugar de uma afta isolada explodem vrias ao mesmo tempo.

AA11808736	As olheiras s?o originadas por um depsito de melanina (pigmento escuro) na pele que podem ter vrias causas como gentica, cansa?o, estresse fsico ou emocional, noites mal dormidas e outros.     As olheiras ocasionadas pelo estresse ou uma noite mal dormida s?o originadas pela dilata??o dos vasos sanguneos, os mdicos chamam este sintoma de congest?o vascular. Assim que o organismo se recupera o problema desaparece.     Quando s?o ocasionadas por um fator gentico  mais complicado, pois costumam ser permanentes e a tendncia  aumentar com a idade. Neste caso, alm da influncia do cansa?o h uma grande tendncia para o depsito de melanina na rea abaixo dos olhos e como a pele  bem fina o escurecimento  rpido.       Tipos de Tratamento     Compressas  o ch de camomila gelado  recomendado para as olheiras roxas, causadas pela dilata??o dos vasos. Pelo fato do ch ser gelado, ele contrai os vasos fazendo com que as olheiras diminuam.     Cremes  presen?a de substancias descongestionantes, vitamina C, vitamina K, anti-radicais livres, cidos ritinico e gliclico. Os cremes tiram o incha?o e clareiam as olheiras. Os resultados aparecem aps um ms de uso.     Laser   considerado o melhor tratamento. Para aqueles que tem pele clara e olheiras bem marcadas  o mais indicado.

9e16ab711fce9547c9e78ca037fe1561aa	Est na hora da refei??o e voc n?o sabe se bebe ou n?o um copo de gua ou suco para acompanhar. Beber ou n?o beber? Ser que vai dar barriga? Ser que vai prejudicar a digest?o?    Ingerir um pouco de lquido durante as refei??es n?o  t?o problemtico assim. "Desde que n?o seja sempre", diz a mdica especialista em nutri??o, Carla Valria de Alvarenga Antunes. O mais indicado, segundo ela,  beber uma hora antes e uma hora aps as refei??es. "Isso n?o impede que uma pesoa que tenha que tomar um remdio depois do almo?o beba o comprimido com um pouco de gua", comenta.    J para a nutrloga Alice Amaral, n?o h problema em beber sempre, desde que n?o ultrapasse a quantidade de 200ml. "Medicina  igual amor.  nem sempre e nem nunca. Voc n?o vai comer uma comida a seco, n?o ? Mas se voc bebe muita gua, voc mastiga menos que deveria", diz. Em um ponto as duas concordam: tomar refrigerante n?o traz benefcio em momento algum.  melhor sempre evit-lo, seja antes, durante ou depois das refei??es. Alm de engordar, ajuda no aparecimento das temidas celulites. Os apropriados s?o os sucos naturais ou gua.    Fatores negativos ao ingerir lquido durante as refei??es  Quem come fibra sabe que esta  uma forma de facilitar a digest?o. Mas se voc ingerir gua ou qualquer outro lquido, a fibra vai passar mais rpido pelo intestino, diminuindo sua fun??o. Outro problema  que o est?mago produz o cido clordrico que  bem concentrado para digerir os alimentos. A gua dilui este cido e prejudica sua atividade, que acaba atuando menos em cima do alimento. "A mdio e a longo prazo, pode atrapalhar o processo de digest?o", enfatiza Alice.    Quem possui problemas como refluxo, esofagite, gastrite, hrnia de hiato e outros problemas na mucosa gstrica, ingerir lquidos n?o  nada apropriado. "Quanto mais lquida a refei??o, na hora que o est?mago contrai  mais fcil do alimento, misturado a gua, refluir para o es?fago, causando esofagite", explica Carla. "Se a pessoa possui alguma patologia digestiva, a ingest?o de lquido pode atrapalhar.  uma quest?o de bom senso", diz Alice.       Quem deve beber  Existem casos de pessoas que devem ingerir lquido durante as refei??es, como aquelas que n?o tm saliva, como quem passou por radioterapia ou quem n?o produz saliva. "Essas pessoas tm que beber, porque a digest?o come?a na boca. Quem n?o tem saliva, at para deglutir  muito difcil", afirma Alice Amaral.     Engorda ou emagrece?  Beber durante a refei??es n?o d barriga, segundo Carla. "N?o  a ingest?o de gua que d barriga.  que a pessoa come mais e engorda. Quando se bebe, come-se mais.  mais fcil comer bebendo do que comer sem beber".    Carla alerta ainda que a sensa??o de que o est?mago est vazio  mais precoce quando h ingest?o do lquido durante a refei??o. "A pessoa vai ficar com fome mais cedo. Para quem quer emagracer n?o  uma boa".     J Alice diz que existem trabalhos que mostrarm que a pessoa que toma lquido durante a refei??es, vai se saciar mais rapidamente. "Ela vai ter uma necessidade menor de alimentos. Isso poderia at ser um coadjuvante no tratamento de perda de peso".    Uma coisa  certa: bebida alcolica engorda sim. Ent?o, seja coerente e n?o exagere.  importante frisar que, tirando a hora das refei??es, temos que tomar dois litros de gua por dia. E n?o se esque?a: cuide sempre da sade!|`|d50c25ec9c96c5dfda1451c76d1b5505aa	Mal n?o faz, apenas atrasa a digest?o.|`|8468634d2d51ef7dcb11c0468956743daa	A gua n?o d tanto problema que at ajuda na digest?o, mas refrigerante (por exemplo) fazem o est?mago dilatar, por causa do gs, ocasionando na m digest?o.|`|9abb669f87a5759ed1a3437c8a4681b3aa	ahahahahahah       o mente suja a minha! rsrsrsrs|`|b8ae113981116cf1fa7fb858519996c9aa	DEPENDENDO DO LQUIDO, MAL FAZ N?O TER O QUE BEBER QUE NEM NA AFRICA.|`|7599e3167357b7d31021c50a418f8ba6aa	Olha, dizem q n?o  bom beber nada enquanto estamos fazendo a nossa refei??o.

You don't sound overweight for your height, playing the sports you love & eating healthy should be enough. Practice would be great exercise.|`|2bab7047ef7c34f7d4027e5d8a7eff79aa	read tips on weight loss and exercise programs that will help you on this site|`|3ecfc8682d237a3dfe7f706906e10117aa	You can not really spot exercise weight off.   You can make the underlying muscles tighter. But not necessarily loose the fat in the areas that you want.    Just watch what you eat and continue to work out.|`|042fee1021e1f27c63a61f7a7d369c42aa	First, quit eating fast foods.  Too much fat and calories.    Instead eat sensible, balanced meals and cut down on the portions.  If you get hungry, then eat some healthy snacks like fruits and vegetables.  Oh yeah, drinking a glass of water before you go to bed and after you get up in the morning helps your digestion.    I know.  I know.  Easier said than done.    I probably lost you already.  Are you still with me?    Next, try some isometric exercises for toning your arms and thighs.  Isometrics use your own strength to put resistance on your muscles.  For example, you can tighten you arms by pressing against a wall with just using the muscles you want to tighten.      For tightening the stomach, crunches, leg lifts and alternate sit ups should do it.    As for pumping up the heart rate (cardiovascular) exercises, try aerobics, jogging, bicycling, swimming or your favorite exercise that exerts your heart and muscles.  Basketball does that too, but you want an exercise program to complement your basketball training that raises and sustains your heart rate while exercising.|`|cb41d5c23ca37f5dcfa845618b4f9e28aa	Get used to drinking lots of COLD water. If has more oxygen and promotes faster metabolism.  Quit drinking soda, and high-caloire sports drinks.  Eat 5-6 times daily, and each time, eat no more than the size of your fist.  Do something that gets your heartrate up to at least 132 for at least 30 minutes, every other day.  Increase as time goes on. Racketball is fun, and so is swimming, and soccerball-hackey sack.  When your alarm goes off in the morning, roll  over and do 10 pushups every other day, and 20 crunches every other day.  Alternate days.  Increase periodically. Volunteer to vaccuum often, and use both arms evenly, switching back and forth.  Rake yards and mow lawns.  Wax the cars.  These are fun activities  that build your upper body while getting things done, and earning priveleges from your parents.  Plus, any boys you have over to help you, will earn points with your parents for helping you get things done.  Best ab/arm exercise with a partner:  lay on your back, hold your legs up, bent at knees, ankles crossed, lift your head up and throw a soccer ball to your partner standing in front of you, throw and catch back and forth as fast as you can, then have your partner stand beside you while you throw back and forth (you do not move positions, just exercise your obliques by throwing to your side).  When you get stronger, graduate to a 10 pound medicine ball.  You can accomplish 3 major goals for a 13 year old.  1-get fit having fun by switching things up,  2-do fun and healthy things with a boy you like,  3 show responsibility and earn points with your parents.  Get used to doing this kind of stuff as part of your lifestyle, and you won't have to worry too much about dieting or giving up your favorite snacks.  Get used to it now, and make it a part of your life, and you probably won't have to worry about cellulite until you are at least in your 40's.  Use your exercise routine to get a cute guy's attention and spend time with you.  it makes guys feel important to be asked for help, admired for athletic skill, and appreciated for their time and attention.  It feels good to their egos, too.  You will have their attention and get into shape while having fun and earning priveleges.  Hope that helps you....|`|459ed6559163c6157adf60e402be1671aa	Hi   Try this simple plan it really works so here goes,  If you are serious about losing weight, the calories in the food you eat should be less than the energy you use.

This is a weekly diet. For SIX straight days you are not allowed to eat anything that contains SALT, SUGAR, STARCH, FLOUR, OR DAIRY. On the seventh day you can eat what ever you want. After a few weeks on this diet, on that seventh day you most likely will be used to eating certain foods and wont have a taste for that other stuff. So from now on look at the ingredients in whatever you eat. IT WILL BE HARD AT FIRST, BUT AFTER A MONTH YOU WILL DEFINITELY START TO SEE SOME MAJOR RESULTS.

The adage, Tie one on for a good nights sleep, isnt true, says Gerard Lombardo, director of the Center for Sleep Disorders Medicine & Research at New York Methodist Hospital. Alcohol will help you fall asleep faster, but it also inhibits deep REM sleep, so the slightest noise or movement can wake you. How to ensure a good nights sleep? Stop drinking at least four hours before going to bed, Lombardo says.

Recuerda que todo tiene su tiempo, de la noche a la ma?ana no vaz a tener un resultado, sino poco a poco.  Es mejor seguir este dicho: Mas vale paso que dure, y no trote que canse, no te desesperes.  Practica la caminata al aire libre, algun deporte que te guste, escucha musica instrumental para que te olvides de estar comiendo cosas que no te nutren, cuando estas en un momento de ocio.  Tienes que tener ocupada tu mente en otras cosas positivas, que te ayuden a cumplir con tu objetivo de ADELGAZAR.  Adelgaza, primero por tu salud y despues por tu apariencia, recuerda esto que te escribo,yo admiro a las mujeres y las quiero, por el simple hecho de ser mujeres, yo vengo de una mujer, las admiro y respeto, por el simple hecho de ser mujeres.  Te escribo esto, porque independientemente de tu apariencia personal, actualmente muchas jovencitas pierden la vida, por ser extremadamente FLAQUITAS, de que les sirve si van a afectar su salud, al no llevar a cabo un control medico calificado.

Some people grow gradually, some grow in fits and starts. When this happens, you body just screams for food. Its normal. When I was your age I grew 6 inches in one summer. It was so fast it actually hurt. I used to eat ALOT and sleep about 14 hrs a day. But I was still skinny. When you are done growing this will go away. In the meantime enjoy being able to eat!|`|AA12101266	You have to set limits and goals for yourself. Hunger could also be malnourishment. Try eating only organic.

To tell u the truth to make you feel better, the nutritionist told me that growing teens need 3000-3500 calories a day. Really, I'm not joking! If you eat this much a day and do a fair amount of exercise, you'll be perfect! If you continue to binge, at least eat something low calorie and healthy. If it really gets out of control, ask your parents for help, because it may become an eating disorder. Right now, you are perfect where you are, no need to change. I hope I helped you!|`|5c8dfa09a5c3c9b4bf1d631a9dfdbcb0aa	I so have days like that.  You are only 17 so it is very possible that your body is growing and it doesn't feel you are getting enough calories.  I find that a good bowl of cereal often helps with my binge eating.  When I am really hungry and I can't see to curb it a glass of milk helps too.  Good luck.|`|3ae43a81ba1bc679288836fca29b2168aa	I am the same way when I'm on a diet--except I'll be great all day until after dinner....then right before I go to bed I'll get the munchies. What I do now is basically schedule my meals in the beginning of the day so I know what, how much, and what time to eat. I'll schedule a small snack (i.e. 100 calories) an hour before bed time so I'm not hungry before bed. Also people eat when they are bored--so I usually try to fill my time with exercise, studying, shopping....the more outdoor the activity, the less I tend to eat (leave the food a home!). Good luck!|`|c88cd62c31024feb1aec77f1755266e5aa	You need to see a doctor, end of story. Uncontrollable desires to eat and insatiable hunger can be the sign of a compulsive overeating disorder you have no control over. If you are eating even when you are full and cannot control yourself it has gone too far. You can gain a lot of weight and in addition give yourself some bad health problems.

Apartir de meados do Sculo XX, a circuncis?o tornou-se uma prtica mdica vulgar, especialmente nos EUA. No entanto, a sua frequncia reduziu-se progressivamente, devido ao facto de a prtica de hbitos de higiene genital regulares terem o mesmo efeito, sendo estes hoje comuns  maioria dos cidad?os.

Existem diversas ONGs, especialmente nos EUA, que buscam a proibi??o legal da circuncis?o infantil.      Origens e fatores culturais da circuncis?o  A circuncis?o masculina provavelmente come?ou como um ritual mgico, talvez para aumentar - ou, ao contrrio, dominar - a virilidade. Em muitas culturas, circuncis?o no incio da puberdade  encarada como um ritual de passagem - que marca o incio da adolescncia e a entrada do rapaz na vida adulta. Serve ainda como um sinal permanente de identifica??o como prova de inicia??o num grupo social ou religioso.    Circuncis?o na cultura judaica    Cr-se que os hebreus ter?o assimilado a prtica da circuncis?o dos egpcios. No Antigo Israel, a circuncis?o tinha-se de se realizada no 8.o dia do nascimento. Tem o sentido de um sinal da alian?a entre Deus e Abra?o e seus descendentes e um rito de inser??o no povo eleito. Deus ter tornado obrigatria a prtica da circuncis?o masculina para Abra?o, um ano antes de nascer Isaque. Todos homens na casa de Abra?o, tanto dos seus descendentes como dos dependentes, estavam includos, e todos os seus escravos receberam em si mesmos este "sinal do pacto". A desconsidera??o deste requisito era punvel com a morte. A circuncis?o torna-se um requisito obrigatrio na Lei dada a Moiss. (Levtico 12:2, 3) Isto era t?o importante que, se o 8.o dia casse no dia de Sbado, teria-se de realizar a circuncis?o. No 1.o Sculo da EC, entre os judeus, era costume social dar nome ao recm-nascido do sexo masculino quando era circuncidado. Mas os profetas do Antigo Testamento mostravam ser mais importante do que a circuncis?o literal,  a circuncis?o figurativa ou no "circuncis?o do cora??o". (Deuteronmio 10:16; 30:6; Jeremias 4:4; 9:25) Os judeus que n?o eram sensveis s palavras dos profetas, s?o chamados figurativamente de "incircuncisos". (Jeremias 6:10; Atos 7:51)    A influncia cultura grega come?ou a predominar no Mdio Oriente, e muitos povos abandonaram a circuncis?o. Mas, quando o rei siro Antoco IV (Epifanio) proscreveu a circuncis?o, ele encontrou m?es judias dispostas antes a morrer do que a negar aos seus filhos o "sinal do pacto". Anos mais tarde, o imperador romano Adriano (117-138) obteve a mesma atitude quando proibiu aos judeus circuncidar seus recm-nascidos. Alguns atletas judeus, que desejavam participar dos jogos helensticos, esfor?avam-se a se tornar "incircuncisos" por meio de uma opera??o destinada a restabelecer certa semelhan?a de prepcio, no empenho de evitar zombaria e ridculo.    Porque era realizada no oitavo dia?  "Com base na considera??o das determina??es de vitamina K e de protrombina, o dia perfeito para se realizar uma circuncis?o  o oitavo dia". (cita??o de "Nenhuma Dessas Doen?as", Dr. S. I. McMillen, 1986, pg. 21, em ingls) Seguir esta regra ajudava a evitar o perigo de uma grande hemorragia. A circuncis?o era usualmente feita pelo chefe de famlia. Em tempos posteriores, usava-se uma pessoa treinada para esta opera??o.    A circuncis?o e o cristianismo  Com a funda??o do Cristianismo, a circuncis?o deixou de ser um requisito religioso obrigatrio para os crist?os judeus, embora n?o fosse expressamente proibida. (Atos 15:6-29) A prespectiva da Igreja Catlica  contrria  circuncis?o (rito judaico) desde seus primeiros dias. Conforme o Papa Eugnio IV oficializou na Bula de Uni?o com os Coptos, de 1442, a Igreja manda a todos os seus fiis que "... n?o pratiquem a circuncis?o, seja antes ou depois do ba|`|56eb96c4900dd2ab27553061dce6d88caa	ixi tambem nao sei rs|`|a9d5332bf39ac298696107d04d8a79d1aa	Fimose  quando o pnis tem excesso de pele cobrindo a glande (cabe?a do pnis).

AA11586730	Hi, I'm a LPC, licensed professional counselor in TN.  And, yes, I hold the NCC (National Certified Counselor from the National Board of Certified Counselors).  Each state has its own rules and most require certification, if not a license for that state.  A Master's level degree in counseling is usually required and a set number of supervised hours.  In my state there is an MHSP designation (Mental Health Specialist Provider) for those who want to work in a clinical setting and requires more hours of study and supervision.  If you want to go the social work route you can become an LCSW and do therapy inpatient or in outpatient setting.  There are some states that permit counseling of addiction, etc. with lesser degrees in some settings.  You need to start first by going to your state's government site to find what their requirements are and talking with someone who already holds the type of position you are looking for.  Going to the counselor education department of a college near you would also be helpful.

It can usually get your teeth about 3-5 shades whiter. After the Zoom is done you get a take home whitening kit to do touch-ups to keep your teeth really white.  There may be some sensitivity but it's usually gone within the first day after the procedure.

AA11096432	Some advice : you need to do 200 minutes of cardio a week. Remember fat does not turn into muscle, so you need to lose your fat while putting on muscle. The 45 minute thing is not true, but don't over 60 minutes at a time.    Do 5-10 minutes of cardio to warm up, then do your weight training. Do 30 to 60 minutes more of cardio, then go home.    The best time to eat is just after your workout within an hour when your metabolism is raging. For your muscles, incorporate some isolated soy protein or whey protein. Whey is more potent but the soy tastes better!    Don't look at your scale as the be all and end all, but get a measuring tape to check your progress, and that will show more tangible results.    Good luck and stick at it.|`|9fa1adb1c8a5e488f13a34915c1381ceaa	If you are shelling out the bucks for a personal trainer why are you second-guessing them?

El tema de la ansiedad y el estres suma a que persona fumadora fume mas dado que es como una especie de tranquilizante pero no lo es.  Es normal que al levantarse tenga bastante tos.  Mi consejo es que consulte con su medico de cabecera y que lo evalu y si necesario que lo medique para el tema de la tos.  Segundo.El dejar de fumar es bastante difcil dado que es una adiccin mas lo cual toda adiccin es bastate difcil de salir y la nica salida para ello es VOLUNTAD.Si carace de eso es bastante complicado.  Remedio no hay por mas que te digan los parches, el lser y miles de cosas mas.  Hay personas no todas que al tener un peque?o susto dejan pero como te comente antes no todas.  Ojala que pueda con su voluntad dejar esa adiccin.  Espero que mi respuesta te  sirva para algo y que tu esposo  no deje de hacerse un chequeo por control.  Suerte !!|`|30a874872ab4642445a05eeac096c281aa	1a -tener muchas muchas ganas de dejar de fumar;  2a - espaciar los tiempos entre cigarrillo y cigarrillo;  3a- beber mucho lquido, de todo tipo y... durante todo el da,   4a - al encender uno, ..... tirarlo enseguida... y que no te importe;  5a - beber mucho lquido durante todo el da (aguaaaaaanta);  6a - permanecer en lugares abiertos y huir de los fumadores;  7a- beber lquido ...............de todo tipo;  8a- si pasas el primer da..... ppuedes pasar dos.....  9a - beber lquido....... de todo tipo; y que te guste mucho;  10a- si pasas el segundo da............. puedes PASAR TRES...

Por todo fumas, porque estas triste, feliz, tomando unos tragos, por nervios, por cualquier cosa que pase a tu alrededor. Merme un tiempo la cantidad de cigarrillos, cuando en la empresa en la que trabajaba estaba prohibido fumar, para solucionar esto opte por fumar antes de llegar a la oficina, a la hora del almuerzo y a la salida; al principio fue dificil, me escapaba y en la calle prendia una a la carrera  unas cuantas aspiradas y lo apagaba. Todo se encuentra en la mente, es fundamental la fuerza de voluntad y toda la ayuda externa que te brinden, un llamado de atencion es la tos, acudan al medico para que lo diagnostiquen y determinen que es lo que lo esta afectando. Con tu apoyo tu esposo podra salir adelante. OJO: no te conviertas en rega?ona cuando lo veas fumando, llamale la atencion con tacto, no sabes lo jarto que es cuando te dan cantaleta todo el tiempo.  Suerte y fuerza de voluntad. Chao|`|63b96ce35e0fb35c72fe89d51a21a509aa	Miles de personas hemos dejado de fumar en todo el mundo con el mtodo de Allen Carr.

da51afae29cbcdce1fab7bbd57137e36aa	What is sleep paralysis?     Sleep paralysis consists of a period of inability to perform voluntary movements either at sleep onset (called hypnogogic or predormital form) or upon awakening (called hypnopompic or postdormtal form).     What are the symptoms?     A complaint of inability to move the trunk or limbs at sleep onset or upon awakening   Presence of brief episodes of partial or complete skeletal muscle paralysis   Episodes can be associated with hypnagogic hallucinations or dream-like mentation (act or use of the brain)     Is it harmful?     Sleep paralysis is most often associated with narcolepsy, a neurological condition in which the person has uncontrollable naps. However, there are many people who experience sleep paralysis without having signs of narcolepsy. Sometimes it runs in families. There is no known explanation why some people experience this paralysis. It is not harmful, although most people report feeling very afraid because they do not know what is happening, and within minutes they gradually or abruptly are able to move again; the episode is often terminated by a sound or a touch on the body.     In some cases, when hypnogogic hallucinations are present, people feel that someone is in the room with them, some experience the feeling that someone or something is sitting on their chest and they feel impending death and suffocation. That has been called the Hag Phenomena and has been happening to people over the centuries. These things cause people much anxiety and terror, but there is no physical harm.     How can I stop the sleep paralysis?     In severe cases, where episodes take place at least once a week for 6 months, medication may be used.     You may be able to minimize the episodes by following good sleep hygiene:     getting enough sleep   reduce stress   exercise regularly (but not too close to bedtime)   keep a regular sleep schedule|`|b36fc8ef084f59d24b824cdad8c1ad2daa	yes, it's scary as hell|`|372756d8b33251da4e8985b965223c0baa	It is called "Sleep Paralysis."

97ef3844451fae9cab1881b9914f164caa	L'expression "petit juif" viendrait du temps o les commer?ants juifs occupaient une place importante dans le commerce, notamment celui des tissus et des vtements. Comme tous les commer?ants, ces derniers mesuraient les articles  l'aune (l'aune est une mesure utilise autrefois qui correspondait  un avant-bras, on mesurait avec l'aune les tissus, dentelles, galons, etc...) en les enroulant autour du coude et de la main dans un mouvement de bascule, quitte  ce que le petit juif commer?ant se cogne le coude sur le comptoir en faisant ce geste. Cet emploi traduirait aussi un soup?on de drision satirique  l'gard du commer?ant juif.|`|5dbf77e644b3c5da2d6c5c000981ded2aa	je l'ai entendu aussi il y a trs longtemps mais il semble d'une expression qui tombe dans les oubliettes.

BIEN DE CHEZ NOUS ...  ----------------------------------------...     Un peu plus d'explications !      Je vois tout de suite des yeux grands ouverts et une interrogation immdiate : "De quoi qu'y nous cause, lui ? Quoi que c'est-y donc que ce nerf ulnaire ?"  Eh bien, pour ceux qui n'ont pas fait d'tudes de mdecine, c'est un nerf (si !) qui suit tout le membre suprieur, passe au niveau du coude derrire l'picondyle mdial de l'humrus (re-si !), donc prs de la pointe du coude o il provoque une dsagrable sensation de fourmillement ou 'lectrique' intense lorsqu'on le compresse fortement ou on le cogne ().    Maintenant, pourquoi l'appelle-t-on le petit juif ?  En ces temps de "politiquement correct" avanc o il n'est plus possible d'appeler un chat un chat sans qu'il sorte ses griffes pour vous faire regretter de ne pas l'avoir appel 'flin de compagnie', voil une expression qui est peut-tre mal venue car,  l'origine, elle vhicule une certaine drision (euphmisme, peut-tre)  l'encontre des commer?ants juifs.    En route, donc, pour l'explication.  Peut-tre vous souvenez-vous d'avoir vu, dans la vraie vie ou dans un film, des gens mesurer des longueurs de quelque chose (corde, tissu...) en l'enroulant autour de l'avant-bras, de la main  l'arrire du coude. C'tait ce qui s'appellait "mesurer  l'aune", l'aune tant devenue la longueur du tour de l'avant-bras (soit environ 1,20 mtre) aprs avoir dsign l'avant-bras lui-mme.  Ce mode de mesure demandait des mouvements particuliers des deux membres suprieurs, le coude de celui portant la chose  mesurer devant faire des allers-retours de bas en haut et pouvant tre amen  cogner l'ventuelle surface au-dessus de laquelle la mesure se faisait.    La dnomination petit juif viendrait d'une poque o, dans le commerce des vtements et tissus, les commer?ants juifs taient majoritaires.  Et lorsqu'ils taient amens  mesurer des produits  l'aune, ils pouvaient facilement et rgulirement se cogner le nerf ulnaire sur leur comptoir (avant que la douleur leur fasse faire une courte danse du scalp)."

Aqui hay muchas variantes que vale la pena aclarar.    La dosis de cualquier medicamento se debe ajustar a la edad y el peso del organismo, Por otro lado, hay dosis especificas para uno u otro padecimiento, por ejemplo, crisis de ansiedad, reacciones conversivas, convulsiones, stres y cualquier otra enfermedad en la que el sistema nervioso se encuentre de manera anormal en un estado de hiperexitacion o facil estimulacion. Si la dosis que tomas no es la adecuada para ti y especifica para tu padecimiento puede haber variaciones en su efecto de alguna manera no deseables.    La sobredosis de benzodiacepinas ocasiona depresion gradual y progresiva dependiente de la dosis y puede ir de simple somnolencia hasta un estado de coma. Se ha descrito, como arriba te lo mencionan, en un sin numero de ansioliticos un raro efecto llamado insomnio paradojico, se cree que tiene que ver con los receptores especificos para el medicamento en el cerebro, que reacciones de manera "paradojica", es decir en lugar de deprimir estimulan.    En tu caso, es conveniente que valores con asesoria de tu medico un peque?o aumento de la dosis y si con esto no ves resultado realizar un cambio de medicamento.

Los compuestos con actividad anticida reaccionan qumicamente para neutralizar o amortiguar las cantidades de cido existente en el estmago. Esto resulta en elevacin del pH del contenido gstrico, por este mecanismo proporciona alivio de la hiperacidez. Tambin reduce la concentracin de cido en la luz del esfago. Esto ocasiona aumento del pH intraesofgico y disminucin de la actividad de la pepsina.   Los anticidos pueden aumentar la presin disminuida del esfnter esofgico. Hidrxido de aluminio tiene accin citoprotectora sobre la mucosa gstrica que puede estar asociada con la estimulacin de la secresin de prostaglandinas, que proporciona proteccin frente a la necrosis y hemorragia causada por factores corrosivos, tales como el cido acetilsaliclico y el alcohol.  Peque?a cantidad de aluminio se absorbe por el intestino, su accin se inicia lentamente y tiene efecto prolongado. Se elimina por va renal y fecal. Aproximadamente 10% de magnesio presente en hidrxido de magnesio se absorbe por el intestino.  El inicio de accin depende de la capacidad del anticido para solubilizarse en el estmago y reaccionar con el cido clorhdrico. El hidrxido de aluminio tiene un inicio de accin rpido y una duracin prolongada, el trisilicato de magnesio es de accin lenta pero y de efecto prolongado. De tal manera que gracias a esta asociacin HIDRXIDO DE ALUMINIO/TRISILICATO DE MAGNESIO suspensin es un producto que ejerce un rpido inicio de accin (hidrxido de magnesio) y efecto anticido prolongado (hidrxido de aluminio y trisilicato de magnesio).  La eliminacin de las peque?as cantidades absorbidas de los compuestos anticidos es renal y fecal; aproximadamente 15 a 30% de las sales formadas se absorben y se eliminan por los ri?ones.  salu2|`|c4cf715bc9e31b92992d5b4a4a0b5e83aa	claro que no, es un tranquilizante, te relaja.|`|0b39a8e02661d533eb3a71638e266103aa	El Diazepan, conocido como Valium, es de la familia de las benzodiazepinas o tranquilizantes menores.

For each injection, measures of CV function and CNS PK [15O]water were made. Postsmoking, MJ influenced all measured CV and [15O]water PK parameters. C users reported significantly lower "highness" and smaller heart rate (HR) changes, which resulted in reduced rate pressure product (RPP) changes compared to O users, even though {Delta}9-tetrahydrocannabinol levels were higher, whereas changes in blood pressure (BP), arrival time, and [15O]water concentration were not significantly different between the groups. Significant CV changes resulted in changes in the whole-body distribution of cardiac output rather than changes in cerebral blood flow. Chronic MJ use produces tolerance to the HR increases induced by acute MJ smoking compared to changes observed in occasional users, without changing the effects on BP and [15O]water PK.|`|7550a3a9834af20d4b512ced8b49bdc7aa	gets you high..hahah 2pts!

AA11808736	Asma  uma doen?a cr?nica dos pulm?es que se caracteriza por tosse, aperto e chiado no peito e falta de ar. Ela faz as vias respiratrias se contrarem em resposta a um agente desencadeante. Quando isso ocorre, a pessoa asmtica sente grande falta de ar ou mesmo n?o consegue respirar.    A asma desencadeada por alrgenos  considerada asma alrgica. A associa??o entre asma e alergia  significante. De 80 a 90% das pessoas com asma tambm sofrem de rinite alrgica. Para muitas pessoas, o contato com alrgenos como caros, plen, fungos, animais e resduos de baratas pode desencadear n?o apenas sintomas de rinite, mas tambm uma crise de asma. Alm disso, a asma pode ser desencadeada ou agravada por numerosos outros fatores, como, por exemplo:  fuma?a de cigarro ,polui??o ,partculas de p, giz, carv?o ou talco; cheiros fortes e sprays sinusites e infec??es etc...  Embora a asma seja uma doen?a cr?nica que deve ser tratada de forma sria, ela n?o impede que voc participe das atividades que mais gosta. Assim como as alergias, a asma pode ser controlada, basta descobrir os desencadeantes da sua doen?a e seguir as prescri??es de seu mdico.  Provavelmente a asma seja uma doen?a hereditria. H estudos recentes apontando para os genes da asma, apesar de n?o se conhecer, ainda, sua capacidade de penetra??o. Parece certo n?o se tratar de um nico gene e possu-lo n?o significa que se ficar doente. No entanto, se um dos pais for asmtico, a probabilidade de um filho com asma crescer. Se os dois forem asmticos, o risco aumenta consideravelmente.  Heran?a gentica n?o  a nica responsvel pelo aparecimento da doen?a. Continuada exposi??o a certos fatores ambientais pode desencadear a crise.  o caso, por exemplo, das poeiras organicas, dos resduos de madeira, do feno e outras forrageiras usadas para alimentar gado. Trata-se, porm, de um tipo diferente de asma cuja crise  deflagrada por um mecanismo semelhante ao das alergias de pele. Portanto,  vlido repetir que existe distin??o entre asma alrgica, ou extrnseca, e asma associada a caractersticas individuais. Exemplificando: h pessoas que entram em crise quando fazem exerccios fsicos e a respira??o se acelera. Ora, ningum  alrgico a exerccios, logo elas demonstram maior predisposi??o para contrair a doen?a.|`|0bbe06d97b322f93674230989e549388aa	nossa voc pode muito bem,se tratar com medicamentos homeopticos, isso e muito bom ,tenho bronquite e fa?o tratamento a uns 6 meses ,nunca mas tive crise...  voc pode fazer tratamento com aerolin!!!lembre-se somente com orienta??o de um medico...  espero que melhore!!!!  beijos|`|2e07a344866cab403c7c63bcfca79820aa	Pode levar uma vida quase normal, se tiver uma bombinha sempre a m?o.

fbe51db101ec3f97faee84b56533fa51aa	Ok, i am sick of this atkins diet. You carbcounting people really need to stop. All i hear out of your mouth is "O i can't eath that it has carbs...*Waah*"     You know what you need carbs. If you don't eat carbs your brain rots and your liver gets damaged. Yeah sure your thin, but you have some weird mental disease and a bad liver. Yep The vanity is worth it!    Im also sick of the exchange program; where you minus the fat grams from the carb grams and the fiber grams to determine what the carb ratio is in your food. Forget that. When i pick up a food im not going to start doing addition and subtraction to determine whether its a food i can eat. How about just minusing some food from your every day diet?     STop looking to some dead man for a quick fix diet and just eat like a regular human being. We are all going to grow old, we are all going to get wrinkles and we are all going to eventually die.    Stop being so concerened about your image and just be yourself. If your a fat, then fine, be fat. If your an anaretsic with a thyroid problem, fine, be a twig. Stop doing all these unneccessary diets.    You know even when you do get down to your goal weight, you will be like, "sure, i can have an extra peice of cake, look at all the wieght i lost!" Then next thing you now *screech* your back on a ddiet because your butt is falling out of your jeans.    Besides im not going to by into some diet that says that i can eat 3 burgers and a pound of bacon, but i can't have an apple because the appple has carbs.    Just be yourself, eat that twinkie, enjoy that cake, and buy that extra pound of courmet cream cheese you always wanted. And if people look at you funny because your too fat or too skinny, tell them to f off and die.     You don't have to adhere to an idealistic vision of beauty marketed by fasion magazines and negatively reinforced by a society dumb enough to believe that beauty only appears on the cover of a magazine. Forget them all.    Now, wheres my waffel sundae?|`|68e51ddfd810d6caeb656eff80706649aa	Base your weight loss on the GI(glycemic index) which helps you chose healthy carbs, resistance training and varied cardio workouts which include interval training.

I finally tried diet pills on the market are made from Hoodia. I saw this stuff on ABC News. It's all natural and safe, and it works! My wife took it for a month and dropped 20 pounds. I took it for a month and lost about 13 (but I didn't exercise).    I bought the natural hoodia from this website: http://www.alllsite.info/free-diet-pills... . I checked the web site address so I can post it here and I saw they're running a promotion now to get a free 2 week sample for only $4.97! I'm going to order this supply for my wife and give it to her for Christmas =)

It just takes a regular exercise routine, where you start out with slow sessions that get longer as the days go by.|`|AA11096432	My ideas? Try to do 200 minutes of cardio a week. Remember fat does not turn into muscle, so you need to lose your fat while putting on muscle. Work hard, but don't over 60 minutes at a time. Do planks and other abs exercises on alternate days.    On training days, do 5-10 minutes of cardio to warm up, then do your weight training. Do 30 to 60 minutes more of cardio, then go home.    The best time to eat is just after your workout within an hour when your metabolism is raging. For your muscles, incorporate some isolated soy protein or whey protein. Whey is more potent but the soy tastes better!    Don't look at your scale as the be all and end all, but get a measuring tape to check your progress, and that will show more tangible results.    Read magazines like Shape, Womens Fitness, Fitness, etc to get tips and to stay motivated.    Good luck and stick at it. This plan has lost me 20 lbs in 12 weeks so far, just go for it!|`|f19ac66aaa158c0f453dc4cf284b44caaa	How to make my stomach flat  http://www.askaquery.com/question/How-to...|`|10fcc5ab0d67a6110220e0bc1ba8a3f8aa	Run to the liquer store as fast as you can.  You can get a six pack there. : )    It is hard to get a six pack, not just for girls either.  You'll have to work at it for months.  There's nothing fast about it.  Lots of crunches and variations of crunches.  A medicine ball can speed it up a little.  It gives you a much tougher workout.  Plenty of protein while you're building your abs.  Good luck.|`|3ff28066355b23888d9fc6698b2f0203aa	No matter how many crunches you do in whatever direction you want to do them, you will not have a six pack until you burn the fat covering them.    Everyone has msucles. Big or small, they are there. Its what makes our body move.    The only difference is that most of us have a layer of fat covering our muscles, so there is no definition.    If you want a flat stomach, with slight lines defining the muscle, you just need to burn fat.    If you want bulging six pack muscles, you have to burn fat and exercise.    Being that you are female, i think you are probably going to want option number 1, and contrary to the poster above, I as a male find a flat well-defined stomach on a woman very sexy.    I must be in the .1% of males. ;)    This is the hard part -  you cant burn fat in only one area. To uncover your abs, you have to burn fat on your entire body.

When you go to the doctor, let them know that you are afraid and don't want them to hurt you.

863faf19ce5c6665af6397bd2adf0a40aa	If you are suffering from mild acne, the use of creams and lotions that remove the oil sebum are the most effective. It is best if these products contain benzoyl peroxide. Benzoyl peroxide helps by reducing any infection within the skin; it also causes the top layer of the skin to be removed which is helpful in unblocking the pores.    There are other creams containing antibiotics that help to combat infection, these help by reducing the severity of the infection.    Other helpful creams are those that contain synthetic vitamin A, these are useful for those who suffer from blackhead type acne.    If topical treatment is ineffective such as those suggested above, oral antibiotics might need to be considered. Antibiotics should be used with caution, as they can effect the body's natural immunity to fight infection. Antibiotics for acne related skin infections can be used for up to six months. They help to kill the bacteria in the skin, as well as reducing the production of sebum, and prevent further inflammation within the skin's follicles. If your doctor believes this is the most appropriate treatment, it is important to know that you should not stop taking the antibiotics unless your doctor advises this. Stopping them before the required time can cause your acne to flare up again. It is important to reduce the dose slowly to avoid this from occurring.    For women there is the option of using the contraceptive pill. This helps to counteract the levels testosterone (yes woman do naturally produce testosterone), and as a result the use of the pill can reduce the severity of acne due to the oestrogen contained in it. The pill can in some women, can do the opposite, and in fact increase the severity of their acne, so it is important that the therapeutic response is closely evaluated.    In the most extreme cases, retinoid drugs may be used. These work by reducing the production of oil in your skin, as well as drying the skin. Retinoid drugs should only be used as a last resort, as they can have unwanted side effects that can be damaging to the liver.    Scaring  It is much easier to avoid scaring these days, as treatments are usually pretty effective, and with so many available, you should be able to find one that will work for you. If it's already too late, and you have some degree of scaring from acne, there are various treatments that can lessen the damage.    Improvements can be made through the use of 'demabrasion' therapy, in which the top layer of the skin is removed. Speak to your doctor or beauty therapist for other available treatments.    Tips for healthy skin  Wash skin twice a day. Dermatologists normally recommend a gentle non-scented cleaning bar. Remember, don't go overboard, as the more you wash your skin the more your sebaceous glands will try and compensate for the loss of oil by producing more sebum.    Treat an outbreak of acne as soon as possible to avoid permanent skin damage (try benzoyl peroxide first before other treatments).    Use a non-scented moisturiser regularly to avoid your skin from drying too much.    Drink plenty of water, this will keep your skin hydrated.    Eat lots of fruit and vegies, as they contain anti-oxidants, which help to promote healthy skin.    Avoid oily cosmetics, and regular contact with cooking oils, as these will add to the oil already present on the skin.|`|bded4f67b6a56e9e6daa5fec2c1ba559aa	they could be sebaceous cysts that sometimes turn into boils. you would have to see a dr to first take antibiotics, and when the soreness is gone, have the sacs surgically removed so they can't return, not in the same area, anyway. good luck.|`|c977fc0c2d0200077bc63648813bf096aa	It sounds to me that your body is getting rid of all the toxins which come from smoking and being on the pill. I've never suffered from spots, not even as a teenager. I live by Avon clearskin products. I use the wash and scrub daily, and I use the face mask twice weekly.   Make sure you drink plenty of water to help flush the toxins, and avoid heavy foundations and oily cosmetics.  If all else fails see your GP and they may prescribe some medication for them|`|79343ec53c8109d77868efbbcc3d6f28aa	Proactiv ... it really works.|`|56d4a929b4359d02537e0d7aab0e6b1caa	You don't make it clear - what kind of spots are you talking about?  Anything to do with the skin can be caused by stress but it could be something else.  Better check with a doc just to be sure.|`|0e707e795cb608f682c90cb2d53c7589aa	That must be upsetting.  The one thing to definitely remember about spot treatments, is to not use stuff like oxy pads or anything.  They're made for young skin.  If you use it as you get older, you'll find you still get spots, but you're skin dries up horribly!  I would try using a mild facial clenser for combination skin morining and night, followed by witchhazel.  Use it on a cotton pad like a toner.  Then before bed and in the morning before you put on any cosmetics, try a tea tree moisturiser.  That works pretty well for me.  I'm thirty and still getting the occasional spot.|`|e37f90abaadffc75963d04cec7aa5edbaa	check with your doctor there may be a serious problem. i do not think the smoking is the problem. you may need a hormone shot of some kind because of stopping the pill|`|f8528513b861575bb290407acd98887caa	Suggest: antioxidants e.g. Green/black teas, different colours of vegetables; yoghurt with good bacteria eaten and on the face; chilling out; hot water and a flannel repeatedly on face for about 5 mins to cleanse gently.  Also I love T-tree oil neat or in products, it is very antibacterial.
6a1fd5cf59992d37fe7f0d96482a6e5aaa	I'll explain by example.  I AM trying to lose weight/trim fat, but I am also working on increasing strength and endurance in the process.  I am currently using an elliptical machine.    Three to four times a week I workout. I began by doing five minutes at the lowest level of incline and resistance.     Each day that I used the machine, there after, I added a minute to my workout until I got to 20 minutes (trying to keep my speed at 2.4 to 2.5).   I maintained that level for a couple of weeks.  I increased the incline to the next level up, but maintained my level 1 resistance and speed.   I then began adding a minute per week with the goal of 25 minutes (I am currently doing 24 minutes).    I have also started to up my resistance for a few minutes at a time during the middle of my work out (since I caculate the entire time into segments).    Since I began, I have found that I am able to last longer and can handle the added resistance.  If I had attempted to begin at the point I am at now, I couldn't have pulled it off.    I've slowly conditioned my body to be able to handle this workout and build up to go further in time.    The entire point of this is to gradually increase my stamina and strength (while attempting to lose weight/trim down).    Choose what exercises you want to do and when. Then, each week, gradually add to it. Consistancy is the key.    Good luck.|`|AA11982425	Exercise plans won't increase your strength and endurance.  Exercise will.  So stop planning and start exercising.|`|AA11096432	My ideas? Try to do 200 minutes of cardio a week. Remember fat does not turn into muscle, so you need to lose your fat while putting on muscle. Work hard, but don't over 60 minutes at a time. Do planks and other abs exercises on alternate days.    On training days, do 5-10 minutes of cardio to warm up, then do your weight training. Do 30 to 60 minutes more of cardio, then go home.    The best time to eat is just after your workout within an hour when your metabolism is raging. For your muscles, incorporate some isolated soy protein or whey protein. Whey is more potent but the soy tastes better!    Don't look at your scale as the be all and end all, but get a measuring tape to check your progress, and that will show more tangible results.    Read magazines like Shape, Womens Fitness, Fitness, etc to get tips and to stay motivated.    Good luck and stick at it. This plan has lost me 20 lbs in 12 weeks so far, just go for it!|`|AA10045887	Sounds like a good plan to me.|`|334719dcf5a7ae123bf2de7edda6a138aa	Not bad!  Hey, in time you may want to increase the reps and also add more weights.  Do push-ups, do pull-ups (on a chinning bar, overgrip with fingers pointing forward), do curls and over head lifts.  Don't forget to do a lot of stretching before and AFTER each workout.  Are you eating balanced meals, fruits and juices (no sodas, no donuts, no candy) plenty of water and not fats?  Good luck and very best wishes.

8320586775a9ac69ad095ef26516eb32aa	Sounds just like mine!  I have carpal tunnel.  There are braces that you can wear to help releave it.  Wear them at night always, and while you work if you can.  But, do go to see a doctor.  I waited too long, and I lost the strength in my right hand.  The doctor told me I was lucky I didn't lose the feeling too!  In the mean time, put your hands palms together, and push the fingers of the affected hand back, and count to five, then take the fingers in the other hand and gently pull them back and count to five.  Bending your wrists backward helps to open up that area.|`|AA10341989	maybe its a pinched nerve. you should see a doctor no matter what it is|`|684b7e6901e0e1ac219796c26ca34d6daa	It could be, so it's a good idea to get it checked out. However, if your fingers stiffen up and curl towards your palm, it's definetely carpel tunnel. It's always a good idea to get it sorted before it reaches this stage, though.|`|AA11224039	yes it is carpal tunnel, go see your doctor.|`|4f9b9a7c117c4ba505cceab84ef1df6caa	Carpal Tunnel Syndrome- Happens after repetition movement.  I think you might have. See your doctor about it.|`|AA10210669	Could be carpal tunnel.  Typically, the hand will tingle as if it's asleep, and you'll get that sensation from the ring finger over to the thumb, not the pinkie finger.    Eventually, your hands will be so crampy you can't open them in the morning.     I've had two carpal tunnel surgeries, and I really, REALLY suggest that you ask for sedation to have it done, and don't have both surgeries done at the same time because then you can't wipe your butt yourself!    There are some exercises that you can get, like physical therapy to try to relieve the symptoms, but in my sister's case, they made hers worse.  I had these hand braces with a hard metal splint in them, but they say you should only wear them to sleep, because if you work in them, use them during the day, it makes your muscles atrophy.      In short, we can't diagnose you here.  You'll need to see an orthopedic surgeon to be sure.|`|AA10012524	could be a pinched nerve (ulnar nerve) at your elbow or wrist from having your arm in the same position.  I had that for about a week and did some stretch exercises and styed off the mouse for a few days.|`|AA10263279	Your question is the answer...you work with computers, with repetitive movements, now you have carpal tunnel syndrome...  some time's a brace might help...if it's really bad you might need surgery...good luck...|`|AA12195034	The fact that you are not feeling it in your pinky (check, I bet you are also feeling it on the half of your ring finger toward the thumb), is an indication that it is. The nerve in question only affects three and a half fingers!    Over the counter anti-inflammatories (aspirin or alieve or ibuprofen), a store-bought wrist brace, and as much rest as you can give your hands should help until you can get to the doctor. Use the brace especially on the computer.    See a doc soon! But don't assume you'll need surgery! Mine cleared up with just the treatment above.  .|`|544b54d69583ab91c0b4e656b30040faaa	YES U NEED TO SEE A DOCTOR OR IF U CAN TAKE A BREAK FROM COMPUTER STUFF|`|4e139f94baaf10dd8755c7d3035a6b19aa	Could be, I'd do get it checked out soon before you make it worse.|`|AA11083319	fairly typical of carpal tunnel symptoms, you could try simple carpal tunnel wrist supports over the counter, and if ineffective then see your doctor for appropriate referral. I think the timet o return towork after surgery is 2 days, good luck
AA11931000	You should avoid any foods that m de your gall bladder hurt.  and as for gaining weight, if it is accompanied with diarrhea, try a drug called Questran. It may help.  I had mine out 11 years ago, andhave had problems ever since. I took so much questran, that it no longer works, and i justhave to watch what i eat. I can no longer eat most veggies raw, and haven't had a salad in 5 years. Just remember, with digestive problems, bland is best.|`|9aef4e9f7563c84ef5c2bb5c2e0c87acaa	I also had my gall bladder removed due to a gall stone. Had trouble with indigestion. Now I am free of pain. Why...?  I don't eat white stuff. No white flour, white sugar and milk (except Yogurt (plain) and mild cheeses.) I avoid alcohol and caffeine. I drink a hot cup of lemon water in the morning   ( instead of coffee) and have a habit of drinking cranberry juice (watered down) with a sweetner called Stevia.    Stevia -- From a South American plant.           It is 300 times sweeter than sugar so it is        used in extremely small amounts.  It is used by        diabetics in many parts of the world.   I did a liver cleanse for three weeks before I started my new eating routine. I'm reborn.

Researchers at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center and at Presbyterian Hospital, Dallas, found that found that women with higher amounts of abdominal fat needed more oxygen during exercise.    The study results may aid researchers in finding ways to help obese people better tolerate exercise and lose weight. The findings were expected to be presented Tuesday at the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology meeting in San Francisco.    Researchers tested eight mild-to-moderately obese women with similar age, height, weight, body mass index, and pulmonary function at rest.    MRIs of the women's upper bodies revealed significant differences in fat distribution between four women who suffered exercise-induced shortness of breath and four women who did not have that problem.    There was a significant correlation between the amount of abdominal fat -- fat under the skin of the abdomen, instead of fat actually inside the abdominal cavity where the stomach and other organs are located -- and the "oxygen cost" of breathing. Oxygen cost is a measurement of how much oxygen is utilized for breathing.    It's not clear whether the exercise-induced shortness of breath in these women is due to increased weight and forces on the lungs or if the higher levels of abdominal fat decrease their lung volume, resulting in the women feeling that they were short of breath, the researchers said.    However, the findings suggest that some obese patients with exercise-induced shortness of breath may not be as out of shape as previously thought, but may have respiratory limitations. Doctors need to instruct these people to focus on weight loss and to do special types of exercise, the researchers said.

Doctors need to instruct these people to focus on weight loss and to do special types of exercise, the researchers said.    All of us should be participating in some form of aerobic exercise a couple of times a week. You know the kind, keep our lungs and heart pumping, plus it never hurt to keep those muscles toned up and strong. While it may not seem so at first glance, even those suffering from asthma will receive a benefit from regular workouts, in helping the lungs function more effectively from the increased capacity. More often then not asthmatics that are taking part in high aerobic activity have a fear that their asthma might act up, or course this keeps them from participating in things due to their conditions. Wile these to issues (exercise and asthma) might seem like water and fire there are ways around the dooming attack that might come on. There are numerous athletes in the professional world who suffer from some form of asthma, how ever they've found away to subdue the symptoms when they need to perform. To help with the symptoms there are several allergy and asthma meds available. Some over the counter, while others require a prescription, all will help subdue the symptoms you might experience while exercising.    Emotional well beings, as well as physical well being can both be improved through exercise, at least according to the American College of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology, of course exercise can also help you manage your asthma better. Here are just a few exercise and asthma tidbits to get you active and stay that way. While it's not known by all, it isn't just any type of exercise that will bring on an asthma attack. It's ideal that you consult either an asthma or allergy specialist prior to beginning an exercise program. Asthma and exercise can cause symptoms such as shortness of breath, a tight feeling in the chest, or coughing, all of which can develop into a full blown asthma at

S?o tres passos iniciais, se vc ven?e-los, tem grandes possibilidades de parar para sempre, vamos l: Primeiro: Observa??o; Observe a si mesmo, antes de tudo fumar  um hbito, observe a Vontade quando ela exer?e sobre vc, tudo  psicolgico por que a qumica adicionada no fumo  pra que vc n?o tenha controle embora saiba que, como vc mesmo disse: Tenho conscincia de que n?o presta. A droga usada  muito forte, para ven?e-la  preciso mais que conscincia,  preciso fazer uma reflex?o profunda sobre o problema, observar os gestos automticos da m?o se preparando para pegar o ma?o...para a?ende-lo...para traga-lo, vc vera que n?o tem controle sobre estes gestos, vc  escravo das Drogas contidas criminalmente no fumo, e n?o do cigarro em si.   Segundo: Amor Prprio. Voce esta destruindo aos poucos o org?o que recebe o elemento mais vital a vida: Oxignio, veja sua pele quando acorda, vc tem uma pelcula de nicotina sobre todo o corpo, fa?a um teste com um algod?o, vc fede a cigarro, suas roupas, seu len?ol, seu travesseiro...as substancias para criar a dependencia s?o cancerigenas em alto grau, seu folego diminui, seu dentes ficam amarelados... ai a hora de perguntar a si mesmo: Ser que vale a pena tanto mau por um prazer t?o pequeno?  Terceiro: este passo s deve ser dado depois de bem compreendido os outros dois, A Conspira??o. Assista o fime - "O Informante", veja duas, tres, quatro...quantas vezes forem necessria para se preparar para o prximo e definitivo passo: Prara Para Sempre De Fumar...Boa Sorte, eu sei que vc vai conseguir...abra?os|`|bf70ebe869e9e2da9a92254c463c47b5aa	Deixe de comprar e n?o seja sem vergonha  pedindo aos outros|`|008f0bef00ac198b13289e356daffe86aa	Ol!

5f5bdda9f22a52bc94cd6a38f328275daa	I think your problem is a really common one.  I'm 28 also, and a guy, but am exactly the same way.  If I wake up during the night to go (which I do most of the time) it's not as bad in the morning, but if I sleep through the night without waking up then my bladder feels like it's about to explode when I wake up.  If I'm really overtired or stressed about something, occasionally I'll even sleep so soundly that I don't notice my bladder filling up past the limit, and end up wetting the bed.  Thankfully that's pretty rare now, although it was worse when I was going to college.    From what I've read, there are a couple of possible things that could cause this... first, the obvious, you may just have a smaller than average bladder, which would probably mean you had to go to the bathroom a lot during the day, and couldn't hold a whole lot at one time.  I've read that it's possible to have a bladder that's "functionally" small even though it's physically normal, which basically means that even though it could hold a normal amount if stretched out, it takes less than normal to make it feel really full, which is what I've been told is probably what's happening in my case.    The other possibility is that you could be lacking in a hormone that most people's bodies produce that naturally limits urine production during the night.  It's called "anti-diuretic hormone" (or ADH), and it tells the kidneys to shut down during the night, both to conserve water and keep you from having to urinate during the night.  This is why most people don't have to urinate at night even though they might have to go every few hours during the day.   If your body doesn't produce enough of this hormone, you'd produce a lot more urine than normal during the night, and your bladder might get really full by morning even if it's normal sized or even on the large side.  If that's the case, there's a synthetic version of this hormone (called DDAVP) that your doctor can precsribe as a nose spray -- it's normally prescribed for bed-wetting in kids and young adults, but it could probably help with your situation too.  It still wouldn't allow you to drink much before bed, though, because drinking a lot when you take it is bad for your kidneys -- but if your bladder being full in the morning really bothers you, DDAVP might be an option.    The last thing I'd suggest (which also might be common sense) is to avoid consuming caffeine or alcohol within about 6 hours of bedtime, as both of those are diuretics that cause you to have to urinate more.    Good luck in finding a solution to this... even though it can be frustrating, I've kind of come to the conclusion that the easiest thing is just to live with it, since dehydrating myself before bed and trying to go to sleep thirsty makes me feel a lot worse, and paying for a medication that I'd have to take every night just isn't worth it.  Hopefully this will give you some ideas, though. :)  Feel free to email me if you have any other questions.|`|66a67a10e2b1ba398397e4f143b1558eaa	How old are you? This can be a part of aging. When we're young, we eliminate most of our urine volume during the day, but as we age (over age 50) this circadian elimination cycle starts to weaken and reverse...they don't know why. There are theories about declining kidney function as we age being the cause, but they're only theories. Are you getting up during the night to pee as well?     When was the last time you had a full physical? If it's been over a year or so, you may consider getting in for one. Tell your health care provider that you are experiencing an unusually full bladder first thing in the a.m. and they will will perform some blood tests and urine studies to make certain your kidneys are functioning normally.|`|AA10092567	don't drink anything a few hours before bedtime|`|2f79ac4e90cf1618d87ef16a5013590daa	ha, same here... i wake up every morning from 4 AM to 6 AM just to use the bathroom... i found that not drinking water 3 hours (or eating) before sleep really helps. Of course you can take small sips of water so you won't go to bed thirsty but just drink less than half a cup. Good luck with it!|`|e352d74460a4e7f7ab88976bf730d080aa	reduce liquid intake before going to bed. make a habit of getting up in the night once to empty your bladder.|`|7a3e7a1748def8d5ed5fb02c8130cd59aa	If it is not bothersome to you then there is no need to worry.  Unless it is affecting your sleep.  I to have to get up in th emiddle of the night to  urinate and then wake up a few hours later with a full bladder ready to bust.  Don't drink anything after 6 pm.  Small sips of water are fine.  The last thing you do before you go to sleep is go to the bathroom to urinate.  That is what I started doing and i've not had to get up anymore during the night.  Also your body is sleeping and resting during this time so it might try to get soem excess fluid off of you while it's trying to rest.  Good LUCk.  sweet dreams!|`|815fd0f7eeed6c377c02d2816929fd1daa	do you drink alot of caffeine? caffeine makes you need the toilet so try not to drink it too much at night, especially a few hours before sleep x

fa009bd11ed8b792f68aa913ac414684aa	Asperger Syndrome or (Asperger's Disorder) is a neurobiological disorder named for a Viennese physician, Hans Asperger, who in 1944 published a paper which described a pattern of behaviors in several young boys who had normal intelligence and language development, but who also exhibited autistic-like behaviors and marked deficiencies in social and communication skills. In spite of the publication of his paper in the 1940's, it wasn't until 1994 that Asperger Syndrome was added to the DSM IV and only in the past few years has AS been recognized by professionals and parents.     Individuals with AS can exhibit a variety of characteristics and the disorder can range from mild to severe. Persons with AS show marked deficiencies in social skills, have difficulties with transitions or changes and prefer sameness. They often have obsessive routines and may be preoccupied with a particular subject of interest. They have a great deal of difficulty reading nonverbal cues (body language) and very often the individual with AS has difficulty determining proper body space. Often overly sensitive to sounds, tastes, smells, and sights, the person with AS may prefer soft clothing, certain foods, and be bothered by sounds or lights no one else seems to hear or see. It's important to remember that the person with AS perceives the world very differently. Therefore, many behaviors that seem odd or unusual are due to those neurological differences and not the result of intentional rudeness or bad behavior, and most certainly not the result of "improper parenting".     By definition, those with AS have a normal IQ and many individuals (although not all), exhibit exceptional skill or talent in a specific area. Because of their high degree of functionality and their naivet, those with AS are often viewed as eccentric or odd and can easily become victims of teasing and bullying. While language development seems, on the surface, normal, individuals with AS often have deficits in pragmatics and prosody. Vocabularies may be extraordinarily rich and some children sound like "little professors." However, persons with AS can be extremely literal and have difficulty using language in a social context.     At this time there is a great deal of debate as to exactly where AS fits. It is presently described as an autism spectrum disorder and Uta Frith, in her book AUTISM AND ASPERGER'S SYNDROME, described AS individuals as "having a dash of Autism". Some professionals feel that AS is the same as High Functioning Autism, while others feel that it is better described as a Nonverbal Learning Disability. AS shares many of the characteristics of PDD-NOS (Pervasive Developmental Disorder; Not otherwise specified), HFA, and NLD and because it was virtually unknown until a few years ago, many individuals either received an incorrect diagnosis or remained undiagnosed. For example, it is not at all uncommon for a child who was initially diagnosed with ADD or ADHD be re-diagnosed with AS. In addition, some individuals who were originally diagnosed with HFA or PDD-NOS are now being given the AS diagnosis and many individuals have a dual diagnosis of Asperger Syndrome and High Functioning Autism.|`|983da09dc3ea0ef9d60b736fb7da884eaa	what do  you want / need to know about this...

I haven't experienced any side effects other than the first week when I felt very hot-flashy and my boobs grew (I'm not lying :P) but I think that was just the hormone change from one bc to another.

The effectiveness of the nuva ring is the same as the effectiveness of the patch and the pill and the side effects are the same. You may feel less side effects with the ring though because the hormones are low dose and you do not need to swallow them (nausea can be a problem for some women taking combined contraceptives).|`|521c592e792c6576e0407f9825a586f6aa	I really like this product.

If you don't want to have a period you can leave it in for an entire month then replace it with a new ring (and this was advised to me by my gyno).    It is small and flexible.. goes in easy..   I am very happy with it.  I have not had the side effects I had with the pill years ago  (weight gain), probably because it is a lower dose.    The only side effect I have had is a loss of sex drive while on it.   So yeah.. I guess it really does work as birth control!

8320586775a9ac69ad095ef26516eb32aa	With a complete hysterectomy, you've lost your ovaries.  That means your hormone production is down.  Your doctor should have prescribed a hormone replacement therapy. (We do tend to gain weight when we turn 40, because our metabolism changes, but all the other stuff is hormonal.)  Contact your doctor, maybe s/he can make adjustments to your prescription.|`|79b925086d95f7b70d82315a1020d91aaa	FACT: Women experience a loss of physical sexual sensation as a result of hysterectomy.    FACT: A woman's vagina is shortened, scarred and dislocated by hysterectomy.     FACT: Hysterectomy's damage is life-long. Among its most common consequences, in addition to operative injuries are:     heart disease   osteoporosis   bone, joint and muscle pain and immobility   loss of sexual desire, arousal, sensation   painful intercourse, vaginal damage   displacement of bladder, bowel, and other pelvic organs   urinary tract infections, frequency, incontinence   chronic constipation and digestive disorders   profound fatigue   chronic exhaustion   altered body odor   loss of short-term memory   blunting of emotions, personality changes, despondency, irritability, anger, reclusiveness and suicidal thinking     FACT: No drugs or other treatments can replace ovarian or uterine hormones or functions. The loss is permanent.     FACT: The medical term for the removal of the ovaries is castration. 76% of women are castrated at the same time of the hysterectomy.    FACT: The uterus and ovaries function throughout life in women who have not been hysterectomized or castrated.     FACT: Twice as many women in their 20's and 30's are hysterectomized as women in their 50's and 60's.    FACT: 98% of women HERS has referred to board-certified gynecologists after being told they needed hysterectomies, discovered that, in fact, they did not need hysterectomies.    FACT: Gynecologists, hospitals and drug companies make more than 8 billion dollars a year from the business of hysterectomy and castration.      Are you taking a synthetic estrogen right now? That seems to still be standard practice for hysterectomies. Most likely you have too much estrogen in your system, which will cause weight gain.    You need to have a saliva test done to check your hormone levels. You want to balance your hormones back out to the levels nature intended, with NATURAL hormone replacement, NOT synthetic.

1b08790b635aa92946a66d1e59fe8a9daa	Lo que provoca da?o renal es un mal control en la enfermedad. Yo soy diabtico tipo 1 y perd mis ri?ones hace 8 a?os (ahora soy transplantado) y en ese entonces todava no haba Lantus, as que eso es todo un mito.    Tendr unos dos a?os que la vengo usando y me va mucho mejor. Recordemos que la insulina intermedia (NPH) tiene una duracin de 12 horas y tiene lo que se le denomina "picos", que es una mayor potencia a ciertas horas de su aplicacin, por lo que se es ms proclive caer en una hipoglucemia.     Ahora la Lantus (tambin conocida como glargina) ofrece una duracin de 24 horas, sin picos, es decir que su accin es siempre la misma.    En cuanto a la aplicacin para ni?os y adolescentes es totalmente fiable, pero desde luego tiene que ser prescrita por el mdico para que haga las conversiones adecuadas. En la referencia que menciono abajo dice: "Uso peditrico: Lantus puede ser administrado en ni?os desde los 6 a?os de edad. No ha sido estudiada la administracin en ni?os menores de 6 a?os".    Para iniciar el tratamiento con Lantus en personas que nunca han utilizado insulina se recomienda iniciar con una dosis de 10 unidades. Para migrar de NPH en pacientes que la usan 1 vez al da, el reemplazo debe ser de 1UI:1UI y para los que se inyectan NPH 2 veces al da el cambio deber ser reduciendo de un 20 al 30% la nueva insulina (Lantus).    Desde luego todo esto se debe consultar con el mdico tratante. No hay que tenerle miedo a las innovaciones. Pero siempre es bueno informarse, educarse y platicarlo con el mdico o consultar una opinin profesional distinta, porque cierto es que muchos galenos estn desactualizados.

( if not, that could be it, I'd still seek a doctor)  feel free to email wiht additional quesitons if you wish  papeche@yahoo.com

81954f629d3ad57d8db11d69a58cd8c4aa	hey thomas! for you and others dying to know the answer to this age-old question, there isn't just one. the remedy i would advise you to try is this:  TOOTHPASTE!!!! yep, the regular, pasty kind, not gel. it really dries out the pimple in just a day or 2.  but, to begin with, get a routine together for Cleansing every day and nite and in between, if possible(reg. Noxzema is good). and NO HOT WATER! more COLD than warm is best.  use an Astringent after wards to clean out your pores and any excess 'grime' (Witch Hazel or Alcohol are super cheap).  you should Exfoliate at least once a day(St. Ive's is good and cheap). use a light moisturizer after each cleansing (baby lotion is good--keeps baby's skin soft & supple). try that out for a week or 2 and let me know how that works for you. remember, your toxins have to come out first before you see the flawless results!! good luck!|`|1755e653099559c4c2c8bd91e3c76616aa	most definitely toothpaste, my daughter uses it all the time.|`|fb3281f522c7986213f3483b5bbc92c0aa	Pimento cheese and vinegar.

I believe the home pregnancy tests are only at the most, 5 days early detection.  Is that particular test saying a vertical line and horizontal line mean pregnant?  If it is, she may be pregnant-if you read the directions, somewhere it will say that even if the line is faint, that could mean positive.    Is she having symptoms of pregnancy? nausea, breast tenderness(this also happens before a period), fatigue?  If she is, you may not be able to tell just yet without some symptoms.  Maybe wait (i know that is hard) a few more days when she is closer to her period and redo the test. Find a test that can detect 4 or 5 days before her next period.|`|AA12239453	chances are you are pregnant but the digital test isn't sensitive enough to pick up the hcg level try again in a week it will probably say positive. any faint line still means a positive result.|`|94fec27ff257b9c0ad61eefc98b2b503aa	You have to wait a few more days.

AA10722993	Cold sores feed on the amino acid arginine.  Foods high in arginine are seeds, nuts, peanuts and peanut butter, and chocolate.      L-lysine fights against arginine.      A friend of mine had cold sores occasionally between his lip and his nose.  He started taking lysine--2000mg twice a day.  He continued this for several months, and hasn't had any cold sores since.  I'm not saying this will cure them forever, but it has helped him.     So I would start taking that amount of lysine, and continue taking it for several months.  And avoid the  foods high in arginine.  See if it helps you.  Lysine is found in the vitamin section of stores.      If you should start to get another one, start the lysine again right away---it will help make the outbreak shorter.|`|c95fa483a3e45001e6ef1b2c2898402aaa	I used to suffer from them all the time.

People make the assumption that Yahoo Answer is just in the States.  Am I right?    Anyways, I drink organic milk.  Organic milk doesn't contain the toxins from conventionally fed cows.    For example, no toxins from conventional feed.  No hormones or antibiotics, otherwise the milk can't be USDA certified.  So organic milk is better for you and you know that the farmers have to treat the cows better to achieve the USDA certification.    If the farmers didn't treat the cows better then antibiotics would be a common thing and USDA doesn't certify milk that has antibiotics in it.

This can be hard to detect on a vaginal swab test, as you really need to look at a fresh sample straight away under a microscope.    If it happens straight after a period, it could be made worse by the sanitary product(s) you use.    Other things can also cause your symptoms. A GUM clinic would have the facilities to examine a fresh sample of the discharge, and give advice. Clinics are not as bad as people assume they will be, and they are a great way to get that area checked by people who specialise in it.    If that doesn't help, get a referral to either a gynaecologist or a venerealdermatologist    Good luck with finding a solution.|`|AA11450491	Does this always happen after your period?    I think you need to see a different doc, and make sure that you go WHILE you're having symptoms.|`|AA12185767	Hi there!!    It sounds like the PH balance in your vagina is off. Sometimes after a woman has a period, there is a slight imbalance in hormones that can cause some unusual discharge and itching inside the vagina. It also might be a yeast infection----but since you have already gone to the doctor and he/she didn't diagnose it as a yeast infection, it most likely isn't what's going on. As far as the discharge goes: does it have an odor? You might try wearing a lightdays pad just to catch the additional discharge after your period is over. Anti-itch creams for vaginal itching are available at your local drugstore (Walgreen's, Rite Aid etc). They are a cream that you can use on the inner and outer vagina lips and clitoris to help ease the itching.   Here is a link to a product that might help: http://www.walgreens.com/store/product.j...  If this problem persists for a month or more, you might consider going back to the doctor (gynecologist) and having them re-evaluate your situation. Hope this helps, and good luck!! :)|`|4507080d087ea5233158c44546840f50aa	I completely disagree with Dolphin Lover. There have been more and more statistics proving Douching is a leading cause of most bacterial and virul infections in women.    If this only happens at the end of your period, then you are most likely just ovulating, but as for the itching, do you shave? If not, then you should most definitely see a doctor, as itching could mean a few different things: yeast infection; bacterial infection; STDs (herpes in particular); or an allergic reaction to a newly used laundry soap.     And I totally agree with momma78239, you should probably go seek a 2nd opinion.|`|d7922b3f6282b8867db4d9cedf75cf79aa	Periods suck, because they mess with the pH in a woman's vagina, and that lets yeast get out of control. Also, wearing pads creates a wonderful breeding ground for stuff, all that moisture and heat. I'm not saying tampons are better, just that pads don't let your body breathe. You might try eating yogurt with active bacterial culture in it every day during and for a week after your period. it can help keep your good bacteria and yeast in control. If you must douche, I suggest vinegar and water rather than medication. Using medication when it isn't necessary just makes superbugs, which are so much harder to kill.|`|99aec736873337f005579944c4876997aa	This sound a lot like a yeast infection.      A yeast infection, also known as candidiasis (pronounced: can-dih-die-uh-sis), is the name for a common infection caused by a type of yeast-like fungus called candida.    Yeast infections usually occur in warm, moist parts of the body, such as the mouth and moist areas of skin. When they cause an infection in the vagina, it is known as vulvovaginal candidiasis.    Candida can overgrow for many reasons. Stress, pregnancy, and illnesses that affect the immune system may allow yeast to multiply, as can certain medicines. These include some birth control pills and steroids. Or if you're taking antibiotics, such as for strep throat, the antibiotics can kill "good" bacteria that also live in the body and normally keep the growth of candida in the vagina in check. Yeast also can flourish if a girl's blood sugar is high. Girls who have diabetes that isn't controlled are at a higher risk for yeast infections.    Many girls find that yeast infections tend to show up right before they get their periods because of the hormonal changes that come with the menstrual cycle. Clothing (especially underwear) that is too tight or made of materials like nylon that trap heat and moisture might lead to yeast infections because yeast can thrive in this type of environment. And douching and using scented sanitary products can upset the healthy balance of bacteria in the vagina and make yeast infections more likely.    Yeast infections can happen to any girl, and they're not related to having sex  although they occasionally can be spread from one sexual partner to the other. This is quite rare, though, and the partner of someone who has a yeast infection does not automatically have to be treated. Yeast infections that are spread through sex are not considered a sexually transmitted disease (STD). A doctor won't be able to tell how you got a yeast infection, but will be able to tell you if you really have one, and if so, how to treat it.    What Are the Symptoms of a Yeast Infection?  Common signs and symptoms of yeast infections include:    itching and irritation in the vagina   redness, swelling, or itching of the vulva (the folds of skin outside the vagina)   a thick, white discharge that can look like cottage cheese and is usually odorless, although it might smell like bread or yeast   pain or burning when urinating or during sex   If you have any of these symptoms, see your doctor or gynecologist.     Also, try another doctor and tell him/her the same thing.

As people age, they tend to do less and less physical activity. This is why elderly people tend to lock up and have limited mobility. If people stay healthy throught life, then down the road they'll have a better life too. :)    Muscular strength an endurance also means that you have a healthy, efficient heart. Also you have more energy throught the day, and will have less trouble making it through the day than most people who are of shape.    And if you're a big eater, having so much muscle also means you can eat more. Muscle tissue burns alot of calories. :)    As for endurance..well..you can save money on not having to hire movers!

You might also lose your life.  You need to consume at least 1,000 calories a day or you will start to lose muscle, your hair, the elasticity of your skin, and other important aspects of your personal appearance.    You need to read the label of the multivitamin bottle to find out if they have calories.    I think you need to become more informed regarding a healthy lose of weight.  I would suggest the following website for current and healthy information.    webmd.com  self.com    Type "weight loss"  into the serch boxes and follow the links to the articles.    Good luck and please be careful.

If this is an uncommon feeling, and symptoms you have never experienced before, it sounds to me as if you may have had a slight stroke. I suggest you get a family member or next door neighbor to drive you to the emergency room right away. I had a slight stroke a couple years ago, and was having the same symptoms as you, mine was near the brain. I woke up also with a severe headache, and memory lapse. I got to ER very quickly, and today I'm good as new. You know a stroke can strike the young and the old. Please let us know how you are doing, and take care of your self.    Hugs  Texas girl

AA11585577	It could be an ovarian cyst... I've got one that causes dull pain on my lower left side that spreads around my back (on a bad day).  Got it checked out at Planned Parenthood, and they said to wait it out (they usually go away on their own)... however it's important to get it checked because if the cyst is large it can rotate around the ovary or fallopian tube and cause problems.    Plus, lower back pain that on one side could be a kidney infection... sometimes that's the only symptom for that.    So I would go see a doctor or ob/gyn!  Or planned parenthood!    Good luck and I hope you feel better soon.

If you're weeks late, that might be a cause for concern.  Ovulation usually occurs in the middle of your cycle and is the best time to get pregnant, so a few days after your preiod shouldn't have gotten you pregnant.  But that's not a guarantee.

First - your tongue is nothing BUT muscle and a heavy blood supply - the lip is more connective tissue  Second - your tongue has no bones at all!  Third - Try not to type in ALL CAPS _ IT LOOKS LIKE YOURE YELLING!  fourth - You didn't answer her question...     here ya go:    If you smoke and get your lip pierced, you are no more likely to get lip cancer than just smoking.    You are far more likely to get lung cancer than mouth cancer from smoking, but believe it or not, smoking causes more mouth cancer than chewing tobacco.    The lip piercing is usually not as bad as a tongue piercing, as far as affecting teeth and gums.    The very WORST is the Le Bret...if you pierce your skin under the lower lip, I can almost gaurantee that you will eventually loser your lower front two teeth due to the backing of the stud rubbing against the gums there.  It's just a matter of if it takes 4 years or 15 or so.....    As for the answer below, where the girl says you can just hide the tongue piercing - Yeah...

Then after a while your body will distribute it where it is needed most.

It's amazing, and even a little funny...    When you run backwards you work your quads, and they work much harder when you run backwards as opposed to running normally.    After warming up (we have the luxury of a track and a group of people so it's safe..  For God's sake if you are doing this on your own BE CAREFUL) for about a quarter mile we usually run about 3/4 laf in reverse, then turn around and switch off with a buddy.  When you switch from running backward to forward you are instantly hit with a sensation that I can only describe as an intoxicated feeling in your thighs.  It wears off after about 30 seconds, but it's pretty intense.  The point im trying to make is that running backwards isolates muscles that normally are not used during a normal run.  It is certainly beneficial, so long as proper safety precautions are taken.

AA11096432	Recruit training is the initial indoctrination and instruction given to new military personnel. It may be common to all recruits, officers being selected on the basis of competency shown during recruit training, or for the enlisted ranks only. Officer trainees undergo a much longer program, which may either supersede or follow the common recruit training. Officer training takes place either in an officer training academy, in ROTC (in the United States) at college level, or at Officer Candidate School after college graduation, since warfare has become much more complex and technological than in the past.    In the United States, recruit training in the Army is called Basic Combat Training (BCT) and in the Marine Corps and Navy it is called boot camp as the Marine Corps term for inexperienced Marines is "boot". The term is also used for the general training period they spend there before they get to their own combat or other units, where besides refresher courses they may also be given more job-specific training.|`|00ba14df888a1fbc98d0509d2fdf84a8aa	"Bootcamp" is the first hard training of the Army or Marines.

Vegetarians have a big advantage when it comes to loosing weight.    You need to get a check up if you did not have one in last year or so so see a doctor first or soon.    Here are my 2 articles it explains the mechanism of weight gain and loss. Please read, understand it and act on it.    In your case give up soda and start drinking water only.  **************************************...  Life Style Change Program for Loosing Weight    By   minootoo     Who needs to loose weight?    Answer is simply not every one, only the over weight person.    Who is over weight?    This is simple, it is easy to find out and it is available on line, it is call Bio Mass Index, and calculations are simple. According to this calculation if you find your self say only 10 pounds more, you may not be over weight. Remember every one is slightly different and you can just watch it, on your own and not let it get out of hand.     What is the reason for being over weight?    This is also simple, have doctor check you out for any physical or hormonal abnormalities. The doctor should be advising you of your ideal weight even though you have already figured out the ideal weight and you are seen a doctor because your weight is not where it should be according to BMI.      Basic understanding of loosing weight.     Every one uses calories at all time. There may be some exceptions to this rule, for most of us; the rate of use, even when we are resting, we use 65 calories per hour minimum. This comes to1560 calories per day. The actual range is between 65 and 100 calories per hour. This is consistent with heart rate of 60 to 80 bits per minute.    Simply put any person eating only say 1500 calories a day will not put on any additional weight. At this level of calories consumption the person should loose some weight over long haul, depending on the individual rate of metabolism.    What is a healthy weight loss?    When one tries to loose weight, one should loose excess fat; there should be a healthy loss of weight. Loosing muscles tissue is unhealthy.    How much is one pound of body fat?    One pound of body fat weight is approximately same as one pound of butter. If you look at a one pound package of butter, you will see it contains between 3200 to 3600 calories. This means that each time a person burns 3600 more calories then what the person takes in, the person will loose one pound.      How many pounds should a person loose in a month?    Any one that is trying to trim down can figure out how long it took to put on the excess pounds. The fact is; it did not happen over night. It usually creeps up, but the person realizes one day suddenly.    This is why a person should not be in a hurry to loose weight. The person should start at once but go slowly. Do not wait for New Year.    Taking above in to consideration a person should not loose more then 2 pounds per month. If a person looses any thing more then that, chances are that the person will not be able to maintain the weight loss. It will take extra efforts to loose and it will take extra efforts to keep it off. Remember slow and steady wins the race.      When an overweight person should start loosing weight?     At once. The person should not be in a hurry to loose weight. The person should start at once but go slowly. Again do not wait for New Year.    How does body react to weight lose?    Any time there is depletion of fat beyond certain level, the body reacts by slowing down metabolism, so that it can build up fat. If the body is use to say 2000 calories per day and detects only 1500 calories per day for considerable length of time it reacts to the situation by reducing the rate of metabolism. When this happens one need to help body by increasing activity. Usually takes about four weeks for body to react.    What is the relationship between body and body fat?    Under ideal condition fat act as a reserved energy source for our body. Certain level of fat is good for healthy living and even may save our life in certain life threatening situations. Every one should have minimum required level of fat on their body.    What if there is no weight loss at 1500 calories in take level?    This is a rear occurrence. Do not panic. The body has slowed down the metabolism to such a great extent that you must help it. The only way to help is to increase activities, this means you have to exercise. You do not need to join Gym but you can go on an an half an hour walk every day or batter still engage in a power walk for same duration. Power walk burns 250 calories per hour and walk burns 100 calories per hour approximately.     What is the importance of body fat for a female?    Females require little more body fat then men. In the absence of certain required level of body fat, females are not able to function properly; in particular they may not be able to conceive. You can find lot more about this on internet.     At 1500 calories intake per day what one must drink and eat?    Drink    One gallon of liquids most of witch should be in the form of water (zero calories).

I just posted a question asking the same thing! Since you're veggie I don't see a problem. Any green leafy vegetable should be present in your meals ATLEAST once a day. Also, if you're fond of milk, try to move to skimmed, or semi-skimmed milk.    One of my favorite food tricks is to drink a nice big bowl of soup before a meal. It'll help you fill up faster, and eat less. Keep your last meal of the day light, and don't sleep right away after eating.    GoodLuck!|`|69848c15da927c72e380ce62ae199e9baa	drink one glass of water before eating.after one month you will loss your weight.|`|645b465ba99e06e14ba5bcec4c61d5ffaa	same problem with me too yaar.blind cannot lead way to a blind|`|AA12254435	I've lost 55 pounds using Himalayan Goji Juice and Carbs Away (some pills you take after meals to reduce carbohidrates) You can find that online @ www.jrl.freelife.com|`|ebec17f29fbb843e3ecf553ba7f60499aa	The biggest fitness mistake I ever made was believing that I didn't have time to walk for a few months due to my work schedule. (I was opening a hotel.) I gained back 53 pounds I had struggled to lose. If I could get a do-over, I would gladly admit that although I would have had to give up half an hour a day of sleep to do it, it would have been best to continue my walking routine. It would have changed the course of my life, as I have suffered a lot of medical problems in the past couple years as a result of gaining that weight back and haven't been able to re-lose it yet. My advice, please, re-examine whether or not you can walk even 30 minutes a day. You will thank yourself for it someday. If you are vegetarian, it seems you should aready have a healthy diet, unless you are eating a lot of junk food, too. If so, just cut that out. Drink lots and lots of water a day, and you shouldn't have a problem. Good luck.|`|d6cee21fa790cd047624ac3f7125b353aa	Anytime you want to loose weight, the key is fewer calories and more exercise.  You DO have time to exercise, if you really want to.  You didn't say why you won't have time to exercise in the coming months, but you can fit it in your day creatively.  I only have 30 minutes for lunch each day, so I eat at my desk when I'm not too busy with work matters and spend my 30 minutes running/walking in the park behind our office.  I started walking 3-4 laps and am now running 12-13 laps.  You can do this anywhere, just take some appropriate shoes to work and go outside when you can.  Then there's the obvious, park farther from the door, take stairs as often as possible (great for muscles) and walk wherever you can instead of driving.  Look at your diet and if you drink regular soda, try diet or water, fat free milk, fat free or no dressings on salads, etc.  Good luck!|`|a6cabb181ea8d27d745870c3fa32dba6aa	Just keep eating lots of fruits and veggies but also make sure you get some servings of nuts (but be careful as the calories in nuts add up VERY quickly).

I did and lost 11 pounds and 21 inches in only 9 days.  I was very happy with the results and continued on the program and lost 29 pounds in 5 weeks.  This is the fastest I have ever lost with other diets like Jenny Craig, Weight Watchers, Medifast, Slimfast etc. Cleansing works by removing toxins from your body.  You get toxins from your food (pesticides, preservatives, food additives, colorings) water, chemicals, pollution, medications, alcohol, hormones that the animals you eat were fed etc.YUCK!  The toxins get coated with fat and remain in your body.  To remove the fat, you have to remove the toxins.  This system worked for me, maybe it can work for you too.  You can check out the website or call this toll free number 1-877-587-4647 for more info.  The program is not cheap, but it is worth every penny since it works and keeps you motivated.  Good luck!

Here is how I did it.  1. Every morning get up and walk for 45 minutes.  You can start with less time, but you want to get up to 45 minutes, and it must be fast walk. You want your heart rate to go up.  It must be in the morning, it kick starts your metabolism.  2. I cut out Red Meat, and fatty foods.  Boneless skinnless chicken breast, baked, or grilled, rice and vegetables (steamed).  3. Eat half.  Just eat half of what you normally eat.  Put 1/2 on your plate, and put the rest away.  Cook less.  When you go to fast food, get salads only.  Or grilled chicken.  No fries,  only diet soda. Or water.    It will work, once you get into a routine, you will get hooked on the results, and you will keep the routine.  It has been over a year for me.

I decided to modify my diet and begin doing a power walk almost everyday. I eat sensibly, but I don't deprive myself of foods that I like. If on a particular day I have a craving for fettuccine Alfredo, I'll eat it. However, I closely monitor how many calories I consume per day. THAT'S THE KEY!!!    Don't worry so much about carbs. That's your energy supply. Don't be too skimpy on those. Diets will always come and go. Today, it's the South Beach Diet, tomorrow.... who knows??

You will be so much healthier after surgery, don't worry how you will look, as far as excess skin, Look at how long you'll live with all the excess weight gone.

Sabes, en una ocasion, hace algun tiempo mi sobrina, que en ese tiempo tenia 27 a?os, cayo en manos de un psiquiatra psicopata, ella cada vez se sentia peor, las dosis de calmantes que le recetaba iban en aumento, ya no podia sostenerse en pie, los ataques de ansiedad eran exagerados, ella en su desesperacion hablo con un sacerdote, este sacerdote le llamo por telefono al psiquiatra y le pidio que la dejara en paz y que dejara de hacerle da?o en todo sentido, especialmente con los medicamentos, ya que gradualmente le estaba subiendo las dosis, el sacerdote le dijo al psiquiatra que si no la dejaba en paz lo demandaria, pues tenia conocimiento de muchas personas a las que estaba enfermando a proposito para sacarles dinero... con el tiempo se descubrio todo en relacion al psiquiatra y se le suspendio su licencia, ya no puede ejercer, tiene un puesto de tacos!    =))    Finalmente, gracias a Dios mi sobrina encontro a otro medico profesional y dejo poco a poco los medicamentos, siguio en terapia con una psicologa y ahora esta muy bien, totalmente recuperada.

Ansonsten schlafe m?glichst so lange, bis Du von alleine wach wirst.

Also ganz okay, wenn du deinen Schlaf nachholst.|`|b1d55d436d2e20f96fe4abf102790a48aa	Erst mal ist berhaupt wichtig zu wissen wie alt du bist, und wie du dich nach 8 bzw. 12h Schlaf fhlst.  Das individuelle Schlafbedrfnis des Erwachsenen schwankt etwa zwischen 6 bis 10 Stunden.  Man spricht von einem individuellen Bedrfnis, es ist also von Mensch zu Mensch unterschiedlich und kann nicht nicht durch ?Training ausgeschaltet oder l?ngerfristig ignoriert werden, ohne dass der Organismus Schaden erleidet. Wer zu den Menschen mit vermehrtem Schlafbedarf geh?rt, sollte also versuchen, seinen Tagesablauf dementsprechend anzupassen und eventuell auch nach den Grnden fr diesen erh?hten Schlafbedarf suchen (teilweise ist dies genetisch bedingt).    Verl?ngerter Schlaf ohne vorherigen Schlafmangel fhrt zu einem Zustand der "oversleeping" genannt wird, ein unangenehm lethargischer Zustand, der einige Stunden andauern kann. Die Konzentration an Schlafhormonen ist dann sehr hoch und wird nur langsam abgebaut. Es stimmt also, dass man sich durch zu viel Schlaf unausgeschlafener fhlen kann.|`|8702b6b8ce98d444d2ef4280cd5a04fcaa	Es gibt Menschen die Mehr Schlaf ben?tigen und Menschen die Weniger ben?tigen und wenn Du am WE l?nger schl?fst dann hat Dein K?rper die Erholung gebraucht.

AA11686626	I've had many rips and thankfully none ever got infected.  A few things that you can do are:    Make sure the skin stays moist.  My preferred lotion was a Vitamin E cream and then I put lanolin on top (seals in moisture), but you can use an antibiotic cream if you are truly concerned about infection.  The biggest thing is to make sure it is clean.    Also, you need to make sure that there is no flap or skin that can rip further.  Either you or your parents may want to shave the flap/callous with a razor blade.  That will prevent it from ripping longer.      If you don't use grips or if they don't cover where the rip is, I would cover the rip with tape when working out.    Good luck!

d78253b3026406d31c9242c83af40176aa	I'm only 19, but I am about 50lbs overweight. It used to be 70lbs...i've lost 20lbs (It took about 5 months, but it happened!)..    My grandma was always bugging me telling me "You need to get enough sleep when your losing weight!"....  For adults (that includes myself) they say that you should get about 8-10 hours of sleep. I was hitting a tough spot, and couldnt lose any more weight. I decided to give it a shot and try sleeping a bit longer and...believe it or not...i started losing weight again. (Along with healthy eating and exercise)..    I guess the reason you need so much sleep is b/c when your exercising mroe than you usually would throughout the day (when your activity is increased at all), your body needs time to repair, and the muscle needs to be built and whatnot...and a lot of the process that your body goes through happen while you sleep. ... Also, if your body is well rested, its going to do a great job at burning all those calories/fats/processing the food that you do eat..etc... If your body is tired, it'll basically slack off(to put it in easy terms)    Also, getting into a good sleep pattern is very important. Try to keep your 'bed time' and 'wake time' the same..whatever times those might be .. your internal clock will eventually become used to it, and you'll feel amazing.(Even if you feel that you already get enough sleep, even though your sleep patterns are iregular...you really will feel better if you regulate things a bit)    Good luck with this!

There is no correlation between sleeping and slimming except that eating a meal shortly before you go to bed will lead to weight gain as  slower metabolism will provide for slower absorption.  With the height you quote,I am sorry to say that you are significantly overweight and your correct weight should be nearer to 200 lbs or 14 stone.  Far from worrying about your sleep duration you do need to address food/calorie intake and correlate this with exercise.  Sorry-not being rude and Good Luck

AA11692333	I started using it since last week for a very bad cold that seemed to be turning into a flu. It cured it. Since I started drinking it, my facial skin actually has a glow to it! I look so healthy. I then started using it on my face and I swear it has healed my pores and cleared my blemishes. Works wonders for acid reflux (heartburn)  and can save you from food poisoning. It is so amazing. It will actually replace all your medicines. The list goes on. I can't brag enough about this miraculous ingredient. It has done wonders for me in over a week that I couldn't do for myself in years.     I was encouraged by this website below and give them credit for curing my sore throat, cold and healing my skin. It's all about apple cider vinegar and other wonderful remedies that actually work. There are plenty of testimonials on there.    PS: My father used acv everyday of his life by putting it in his  salad. He never had the flu or a cold and was always healthy. He lived to 93 years old. Now I understand why he was never sick a day in his life.

Six-packs are something like 60% diet.|`|06a5b4be000ee041a4e5da71aa1db2d8aa	read tips on some great ab workouts and more to help you on this site|`|b725bd4233753125a0b5b65e6af14e29aa	no, that's why we always say eat junk in moderation.    say if you're having a slice of cake for every meal of the day...you would have to do cardio day and night to burn that off.|`|e63052db9e9b25c99b677c003ed25e28aa	Sort of.  But you would be jeopardizing your health in other ways.  Yes, a calorie is a calorie is a calorie, but eating nothing but junk will not provide your body with the nutrients it needs and could clog your arteries and damage your heart.  Working out "to the extreme" would put a huge amount of pressure on your body if you are not giving it the right fuel.  You would end up looking good on the outside but inside you would be a ticking time-bomb - a heart attack or stroke waiting to happen.  Not a good idea.  Stick to lean proteins, whole grains, fruits and veggies.  Indulge in the junk food once in a while but don't make it your only form of nutrition.|`|i8IVoLj5aa	If only.  I have found that lean meats, veg, fruit, no alcohol (goes straight to the waist line) or sugary foods are the only way to a sculpted stomach. Crunching about 30-40, and doing the plank (yoga move) in the morning and the evening and maintaining a good diet helps me.|`|053b0aa19ec4f431461d12cec11cbdadaa	of course it is

But my advice is to go pronto, ie tomorrow. If it goes on its own then you'll never find out what it was and if it is something like herpes, which it might not be, they need to swab the actual sore.|`|yTGhMW4Uaa	ooh that a genital wart  you have done it with someone who has had them and now they gvce it to you  oooh.  go to the doc|`|pD329JO2aa	see your gp  xxx|`|yHC04V6uaa	cancer ???????|`|WdwASGvRaa	A vaginal wart!
