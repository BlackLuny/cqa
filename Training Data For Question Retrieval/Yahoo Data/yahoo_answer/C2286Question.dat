Which of the following best explains why the free-market system follows a circular flow model?             The allocation of resources affects both production and distribution.

Consumers and producers protect their own freedom by making economic decisions.             The government makes and enforces whatever laws are needed to guarantee free choice.             Workers pressure producers to provide them with high enough wages to make free choices.             Conflict and competition among producers automatically lead to free choice for consumers.            6.

The motivation to work hard at a job in order to buy more goods and services.             The incentive to buy at a low price in order to be able to sell at a higher price.             The desire to make money through the production of goods and services.             The decision to allow market forces to decide on the price of goods and services.            8.

20090202102547AAfm0gs	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Can someone please help me?	April 2004 marked the 30th anniversary of the April 3-4, 1974, super tornado outbreak. It was the worst tornado outbreak in U.S. history, with 148 twisters touching down in 13 states. Before it was over 16 hours later, 330 people were dead and 5,484 were injured in a damage path covering more than 2,500 miles.      Twenty-five years ago, National Weather Service forecasters could see only green blobs on their radar scopes and had to wait for visual confirmation of the tornado before issuing a tornado warning. Thanks to a $4.5 billion weather service modernization effort, today's forecasters, view evolving storms in graphic detail and can now issue warnings before tornadoes even form, with an average lead time of 11 minutes.       "Deadly storms such as the 1974 super outbreak can and will happen again," said Ken Haydu, meteorologist in charge of the National Weather Service's forecast office in Wilmington, Ohio. "The people who experienced the super outbreak have an important story about tornado awareness and preparedness to pass on to later generations."       In all, 13 states were struck by twisters: Alabama, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Mississippi, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia.     http://www.publicaffairs.noaa.gov/storms...        1. The author’s purpose is to. . .       a. describe the effect twisters had on thirteen states.    b. compare twisters to other natural disasters.    c. contrast weather forecasting today with that in 1974.    d. allude to the high cost of damage done in 1974.    e. personify twisters as destructive monsters.       2. In the second paragraph, “modernization effort” is referring to. . .       a. updated computer technology    b. updated construction technology    c. updated media technology    d. updated forecasting technology    e. all of the above       Choose the answer below that indicates the correct order for each of the two questions associated with this reading passage:    17        1. a, 2. b        1. c, 2. c        1. c, 2. d        1. d, 2. d        1. e, 2. d

20090202102723AAM3Hx9	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Correct this text and you will be awarded the "best answer"?	First step is to create a cylindrical ?14mm (Ds) rod. To create the treads we use the “helical sweep” function and define the thread as right handed with the cut profile that is calculated using the table above.   When done, a single threaded screw is constructed.   Next we repeat the process above with difference that this time a left handed thread is defined.   Finally the double threaded screw part is completed by creating a handle at one side of the screw.   The cut profile and the finished part are shown in below:   Designing a double threaded nut is very similar to the screw. Except the cut profile has a different dimensions than in screw and we chose the cutting pattern as “norm to trajectory”.       First step is to extrude the nut part, then create a hole slightly wider than the diameter of the rod used in the base construction in order to ensure a free translational motion. Next we drill an ?10.5 mm (kn) hole into the nut which will be used to construct the threads.   Using the table we find the dimensions on cut profile for the nut.   In the end a T shape lock designed in order to constrain and prevent the screw from sliding out of the base construction.

20090202103725AA9M2V9	Education & Reference;Homework Help	What is bad about Churchill here?	Winston Churchill’s major achievement in this post was to establish labour exchanges. In 1910, he was promoted to Home Secretary. As Home Secretary, Winston Churchill used troops to maintain law and order during a miners strike in South Wales. He also used a detachment of Scots Guards to assist police during a house siege in Sidney Street in East London in January 1911. Whilst such actions may have marked him down as a man who would do his utmost to maintain law and order, there were those who criticised his use of the military for issues that the police usually dealt with.

Dear Mrs. Thompson,  I don't think Laura has a bad memory for languages.  She is a bright student. Maybe your daughter lacks interest or she doesn't like the subject for one reason or another. Perhaps she is studying at a wrong time of the day. You say that she "tries to study". Why doesn't she really study? I mean, study and not try to.  Sometimes people pretend to study, but unconsciously they don't pay attention to what they are doing. Ask Laura to talk to her teacher before it is late.  Ken Clover (coordinator)

I need to know what the pattern of the sum of degrees is in stars that have 5-12 points when the 3rd, 4th, 5th points are connected for each star.             For example : A 5 pointed figure when every point is connected has a total of 540 Degrees in it and a 6 pointed figure with each point connected adds up to 720 degrees. So the pattern is (n-2)x180=degrees, n = the number of sides.              Example #2 : For a 5 pointed figure when every second point is connected (which makes a star) will have a total of 180 degrees and a 6 pointed figure with every second point connected will equal 360 degrees. So the pattern will be (n-4)180=degrees, n= number of sides
