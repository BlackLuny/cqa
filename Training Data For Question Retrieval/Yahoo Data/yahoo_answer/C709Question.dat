20090128152907AAaVRCM	Family & Relationships;Friends	My friends aren't getting along!?	2 of my friends keep arguing, Sydney and Moria. Sydney is saying that Moria used to be her best friend, but she is turning into a girly-girl and Sydney hates girly-girls. Moria says Sydney is mad at her because she doesn't give Sydney food at lunch when Sydney doesn't get to to pack a lunch. Moria said Sydney told her she ate her lunch for breakfast, but that is not what Sydney is saying now. Sydney is saying Moria is this close to being on her most hated list. Can you give me ideas on how to get them to quit arguing about this and become friends again?
20090128152806AAXRSHm	Family & Relationships;Family	Who has legal custody when they parents are never married?	I need some advice on child custody. I'm leaving the father of my child and in no way want to keep my son from seeing his father. One of my coworkers was in a similar situation and told me that since we never got married the mother automatically has full custody. Is this true? I want my son to be able to see his father but honestly his father isnt very mature. He never even wanted me to have my son when i told him i was pregnant. After that I feel like he really doesnt deserve to ever see him but that's not whats best for my son. So.....do i already have full custody? I'm planning on moving out of our apartment asap but i need to figure out the whole custody thing. Also.....is ther any way to figure out how much he would have to pay for child support? He would probably have my son 2 maybe 3 days (he would rather have time to hang out with his friends. ***hole!). He makes about 2500 a month and i make a good amount less. Thanks for any help. My son is only 5 months by the way.....not sure if that makes a difference. I also pay for his medical insurance and all his doctor visits and shots.

I'm not sure what to do. well, i have a boyfriend. and we just became official "boyfriend and girlfriend" yesterday. but we've liked each other for a long time, and we were friends before this relationship. not best friends, but like okay friends. the problem is that i dont feel a "spark" or in other words, im not as excited as i was yesterday. i mean we talk but its through text messages (hes calling me tonight, and were going on a date friday, dont worry.) but i dont really feel any excitment or a burning desire to hang out with him. and our conversations are sort of boring. like, ive asked him whats up, how are you, whatcha doin, a bunch of stuff like that. my question is, how to i make this relationship more exciting, and what do i do to make our text or phone conversations more interesting?

20090128153021AAli852	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Have you ever caught your husband "pleasuring himself?"?	I came home early from shopping last weekend and found my husband masturbating to internet porn in our living room.  He didn't hear me come in and had no idea I was standing right behind him.  So, I just watched him for a few minutes.  I have to admit is was sort of funny seeing him totally captivated by porn and holding his penis in one hand and his testicles in the other.  I then tiptoed out of the room and pretended to reenter the house by making a bunch of noise.  When I asked him what he was doing while I was out, he said he was "watching basketball."  LOL.      Anyway, he still has no clue I saw him.  Any wives have a similar experience?  Did you later tell your husbands you saw them "doing the deed?"

20090128153051AAN1WLM	Family & Relationships;Weddings	What should I do about my bridesmaid?	I've been engaged for a while, and now that my wedding is just under 4 months away, I asked my bridesmaids for help, since I can't do it all myself. It's little helps, like finding a cake place for me or coming up with centerpiece ideas or telling me what they think of the bridesmaids dresses. It's not a huge deal like paying for anything, and 3 of my 4 bridesmaids were more than happy to help. The fourth bridesmaid, not so much.      She won't respond to my emails, phone calls, or texts about the wedding, and when I try to talk to her about anything BUT the wedding, she gives me one worded answers or doesn't respond at all. I'm getting really frustrated, and have given up trying to talk to her. I feel like I shouldn't have to buy her a bridesmaids dress if all she's going to do is eat the food, get drunk at the bachelorette party, and flirt with the groomsmen.      So my question is, should I relieve her of her title? Is it right of me to not let her be a bridesmaid anymore if she won't even talk to me as friends? And if so, should I just flat out tell her I'm firing her, should I warn her that I'm going to if she doesn't help more, or should I just go on without her?

20090128153115AAzLHwN	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why do I feel so crap?	I was in a relationship which ended on Monday. It went on for 5 months or so. I didn't think I was taking it seriously, but now I feel god awful. It's my fault I lost her. I took her for granted and didn't make her feel special. Maybe she set the bar too high. Now I have to pretend I'm alright as we share the same friends and see each other every day, but really I'm crying out inside. The way she ended it was that if I could commit more and have a better shot at it, we could try again. But now I'm in so much pain that I'm scared. I don't know what to do. I could get back with her but I don't know if I can commit more- if I do that and it doesn't work I'll hurt her so much and whatever I'm feeling now will feel 10,000 times worse. Also, she might turn around and say no. The rejection would feel awful. But I don't know if I can endure this feeling much longer.

20090128153333AAxQNmC	Family & Relationships;Family	Is this being a hypocrit?	My siblings and I are talking about being a hypocrit. Not sure if I spelt  it right but we are talking about this because My 16 year old sister told our 6 year old sister that she had to pull up her shirt because she was showing her chest. My brother got mad because he said my sister was being a hypocrit because she is saying for our younger sister not to show her chest when she shows clevage. Is that being a hypocrit? I was trying to tell him its not because she is 16 she is older so she can do things that our 6 year old sister cant so she isnt a hypocrit. What do you think?Is telling your 6 year old sister not to show her chest when you are 16 and showing a little clevage being a hypocrit?Thanks in advance!
20090128153259AA75STM	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Do you notice patterns?	I cannot help but notice patterns, and within M&D, there is a really obvious pattern that I can't not see!  Every day, without fail, there are one or two new user names with some variation of my first name asking questions that are sometimes eerily similar to my circumstances.  I have noticed my first name and last initial, my husband's first name and last initial, even my (extremely unusual) middle name and last initial.  I have also seen several unusual names  of family members.  Is this really uncommon?  I thought it was so bizarre that I even asked my husband if he was messing with me (asked my bf also.)  Neither of them was, so either I am nutso (always possible) or there is a weird pattern going on here.  Have you ever noticed any patterns like this?

20090128153630AAsaYyd	Family & Relationships;Family	How do I stop bottling up my emotions?	Okay, so, my parents get on my nerves a TON, my teachers constantly pester me, and I can't seem to get all A's like me and my parents want.  I'm constantly stressed out with the workload of high school and I'm cracking under the pressure.  My parents push me waaaay too much in school and they can't be proud of my 3.4 GPA.  (I'm not that happy about it either, but at least I don't get C's and F's like the other people at my school.)  My parents think I'm an okay teenager because I have never ever yelled at them, cursed at them, or even told them "No" when they tell me to do something.  They really make me angry with their constant nagging and high expectations.  I can't be their perfect little no-backtalk little angel for much longer, I just can't handle it!  They wouldn't even let me go to my own cousin (and best friend)'s Conformation because I needed to study for a test I have tomorrow, even though I studied for at least 2 hours yesterday.   Any suggestions on what I should do and how to stop bottling up my emotions?  Thanks in advance! :]

She has been in an abusive relationship for the past 2 years. Although I support her decisions (but still insist that she should leave the beating and drug obsessed guy behind) I still love talking to her.   Since we live in different towns, its hard for us to get together.   So we made plans for her to come to see me with her son (hes 1.5 yrs old) I have told her that her guy isn't welcome at our house, that me and my husband are not okay with him knowing where we live. (if she were to ever run, she would come to our house)  Now, Its Wednesday - and thus far, the plan was for her and just her son to come out -it never included her guy. But now all of a sudden, hes coming too.   I thought we were clear on our feelings about him but obviously not.   So how do I not hurt her feelings, make it clear that he is NEVER welcome at our house and that it was rude to wait until two days before she is supposed to come - to tell me that he is coming too....

Our relationship was not the greatest and there was alot of mistrust. Is it normal to have dreams of exes and wonder what life would be like if you didnt do this? What was your experience
20090128154513AAyUAMn	Family & Relationships;Family	BE HONEST IN YOUR Answer!!! (easy best answer)?	Will I get a good grade on this poem. I'm in 7th grade and this is a change poem.       It's supposed to highlight a significant part of our life where we noticed change.       Here it is:      I remember that night.   I remained in the dream, that is, childhood.   Endless days, when you could do whatever you want,   but that night, the nightmare that some call "growing up" began.      It was raining that night, a rather dull night.   My siblings and I, all allies, gathered at base, the living room.   Sitting across from us, my mother and father, the opposing forces, stared directly into our eyes.      My mother had that devastated look in her eyes.   "Your baby-sitter will not be with us anymore," were my father's last comment before the tears started streaming.   The bullet from my mother and father was shot into my beating heart lying in my chest.   They had stabbed all of us in the back with no warning.      My baby-sitter, whom I had known since birth, was more than an ordinary baby-sitter.   She was my best friend,my pillow, my second mother.   I loved her like a mother, and she had changed all of our lives.   She had been diagnosed with a rare disease, cut back from us, her children.   We were all crying our hearts out, our weapons had been dropped.         All my life up to this point had been perfect.   Childhood is perfect, an everlasting dream.   There is never anything to make you sad, never anything to put you down.   Everyone is your friend, even the stuffed animal you cuddle by every night for protection.   That moment, when my parents shot me in the heart, was more than just the ending of an alliance with my best friend, Dotty.   It was also the beginning of childhood, at age six, fading away.      It was that ability to wake up every morning and say, "What should I do today?" fading away.   It was the opportunity to walk on clouds, that thriving imagination, fading away.   It was the beginning of life with no sadness, fading away;   and once my baby-sitter was disabled from coming to play with me every day,   that perfect, indescribable time from life faded away.

"Hey, My mom brought up a point today, which surprisingly I was already thinking. I need to discuss with you the whole money thing. No worries, I'm not mad, you did nothing wrong, but I do need to have a serious conversation with you. I'll be home tonight, around 10:30, I'll talk to you on AIM. I love you, ttys!"      The money things is me having a negative checking account balance. I kind of dragged my boyfriend into the situation and he brought me to the bank to talk it out with someone. If he was thinking what his mom was thinking shouldn't he have told me? Shouldn't he have talked to me about it?
20090128155302AAmv56T	Family & Relationships;Friends	What Should I Do About Prom?	my senior year prom is coming up in may and I don't know what to do. I am currently single. I liked this girl for a while but she clearly said that she WOULD date me, but she doesn't want to ruin the friendship. But she did offer to go to prom with me. The other girl is like a sister to me, but nothing more. So she is pretty much an escort and then she goes off and does her own thing. (i took her last year). I was hoping id have a girlfriend to take, but im not really sure. I just think that it's a waste of money just to take a "friend" out. What do you think?

20090128160232AAcKGgS	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should I do about this?	One of my guy friends told me last friday night that he like likes me. Well, the thing is I just like him as a friend, maybe just a little bit more than a friend but not enough to REALLY like him. But I have a crush on this one guy in our grade too. My guy friend and my crush are kinda friends but i dont talk to my crush (dont have any classes with him) so its a little weird. And the guy that likes me knows that i like this one guy and he says hes jealous of him. Then my guy friend also told me that he would ask me out but isnt going to cuz he knows the answer and i told him that i didnt know.      i really dont know if i should go out with him, or not. all my friends say to do it but im not really sure cuz im not supposed to "date" anyone. and we are only in 8th grade btw. I mean, sure i like him as a friend, but as a boyfriend...mmm not so much. and at the same time i really really like this other guy (my crush).       What should i do? (i hope thats not too confusing)

20090128160908AAfb0je	Family & Relationships;Friends	Why in United States of America, girls/women don't like hairy chest or hairy men? I think it's a media...?	Why girls/women here are so lesbian? Media brainwashed the century? I've heard that in many countries it's different. I'm almost 19 and have a hair on my chest, and I like to wear a shirt. Even when I close my buttons, it's still visible from the shirt. Sometimes, I feel more confident when I don't close the button in the up of the shirt. It's visible to women... Perhaps, it's one of the reasons I can't find a girlfriend... I think I should move out from "the country" lol. It's a joke... By the way, I live in New York.

20090128155343AAPtKku	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Should I marry him, he may be giving up a lot more?	His parents have said they will never speak to him again if he marry's me.    His brother has already proven his ability to dissapear whenever I am around and exit the phone and internet when he knows I am in conference.   His friends have already begun inviting him to engagements and telling him I am not invited nor will I ever be.   I am afraid this is just the begining of our world (in his world) together.    My family and friends accept him 100%. Actually, they adore him and we have a great time together when we hang out.      I am three months away from marriage where none of his family and friends will attend. He is so sad.       I told him I would release him from our engagment but he became very upset and said he loves me dearly and has fought so hard for his family to change their minds...he couldn't believe I would consider leaving him after all he has been through.       I am considering this FOR him...his life will be better off without me. He will have his family back and his friends. Before they found out about me Mikail told me stories of all these people and how wonderful, kind and loving they all were. Since they found out about me they have become vile, mean and hateful towards him and me. Traits he never experienced before. It is terrible...I mean HORRIBLE!       I am of a different culture and age then he.
20090128160238AAEx5oz	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Who else would never date someone with plastic surgery?	Alright, this has been on my mind for a long time.  What I don't understand is people getting plastic surgery such as face lifts, breast implants, lip implants, etc.      I don't understand the men who go after these fake women and even consider marriage.  If nature gives you smaller breasts or no lips then you should accept and appreciate God's gift.      I don't think I've ever met one person who has had plastic surgery with  even a substantial amount of selfesteem.

20090128155458AAS2RQ3	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is pre marriage sexual experience helpful for after marriage?	I am thinking about one common opinion suggesting that if an individual experience different people of the opposite sex, then after marriage has less temptation and sexual desires toward them.  On the other hand, some people believe the least pre marriage experience gives the more chance of having a happy sexual life after marriage since the individual will not compare their partner to their previous partners, so they feel more satisfied.   I dont have and am not in favor of the first opinion, but I am just afraid that might be true, then I might feel regret of not having enough experience before marriage. This has occupied my mind very much and I need your help, if you have been through similar concerns.

20090128155042AAMnF1T	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Mother in law and Husband problems! HELP URGENT?	My mama's boy / abusive (physically, emotionally and mentally)  HUSBAND of 15 yrs has been in contact with his estranged similarly abusive mother for 4 yrs without me knowing.  She has abused him as a child, and myself when I was first married.  We have lived in two different coutries for all these years.  His mother disowned him and his children (our daughter and son) 15 yrs ago b.c she did not want him to marry me.  My motherinlaw's own husband is ill and in a home, and she is also estranged from her sisters who all live in the same country we do.        Unfortunately, she has decided to come into my life without any warning and into my childrens lives.  My husband being under her spell and trying to win her approval (she never wanted him as child and tried to have a purposeful miscarriage) allows her to move into our house for 1 week, use him as a driver to go on a weekend trip with her sisters and given my kids a couple hundred dollars gifts. My children do not know her.  She has never met them except as children for a month.   My husband does not listen to me or care except for his mother's wishes. She has come back to live with us again on her holiday and he is allowing it.  They are both controlling and manipulative.  Her family makes their spouses suffer and they all end up usually alcholic, dead, sick with cancer...These people are like the devil.  I am worried she will live with us permanently or find a way to break us up or have him take sides and manipulate my children into hating me. They have done this so many times...her sisters hated on their spouses and so have children.       I don't know what to do.  I have tried to help him get over his pain and suffering due to his mother and father since he was a child, I have seen him hurt me, my children etc. but I never wanted to divorce him b.c I wanted my children to have a father...he also scares me terribly and I don't know what minute he may explode again and try to attempt to kill me bc of his RAGE.  His mother has tried to slap me a few times early in our marriage and verbally abuses me.        I am worried I may either get sick with cancer or another illness from all this stress, or leave my famly and have my kids turned against me or hate me for leaving, or try to take my TEENAGE KIDS away whihc is impossible b.c they do not listen at this age to reason, OR perhaps try to divorce him....I don;t know what to do.

20090128155520AAs2zgN	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	THIS IS FOR SUZI!!!!!?	Thank you for answering my question, you gave the best advice so...    I am going to arrange a dinner and invite my family and I am just going to lay it down on the table, I'm going to let them know that there is going to be no more of milking me for money, all giving stops here,NO MORE! and the best way that I am going to help them is to do NOTHING! and that I WILL NO LONGER PICK UP THIS FAMILY"S TAB!!!, I'm going to tell my brothers that I will sell there houses and give them the money from the houses! and as for my mother I am going to let her know that her house is paid for but if she wants to we can sell her house for a smaller house and she can have the left over money but I will no longer be giving her 3500 a month and I will only be giving her 1000 a month and I will still pay any taxes on the house, light's, water and phone ( I think that's fair, she is my mother + she's not a gold digger)    You also suggested that we invest with our  money, and we are and have: we have four condos that was also an inheritance, we remodeled from inside to out and we make about 15,200 month from those which is about 182,400 a year give or take a little.     We are also in  the process of buying three condo's here in nashville and they are brand new which we will be renting for 4000 a month so that estimated value is 144,000 a year, my point is we are investing so that we can always have flowing income. And as far as finding someone we can trust with our money is NOBODY, we trust no one! My husbands dad is an investment banker/ Broker  so he gives all the free advice we need.    And our other plans for this year is to open a night club and  restaurants with New Orleans inspired food.  My husband want's to open a  couple of McDonalds ? what do you think about that? I want a chain of snow ball stands!( I grew up in new orleans)  I am also about giving back! We mostly give back to New Orleans community because that's our roots so we give to the public school systems there and something that I am very proud of is the McMillians Nursing School foundation which is a nursing program that is free for High School students who want to pursue a Nursing Career and may not be able to afford to go to College other wise!( it's a great program) that allows grades 9 - 12 with a 3.5 GPA to start nursing school! and this is college credits!!! and after graduation of high school 100% of our students receive academic scholarships to go on to the best nursing schools in the US!    SUZI I would love your input so get back to me.  Thank you!

20090128155549AA2U9L1	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What are some funny things to ask my husband?	Me and my husband both love to play this game we call "Truth". One person asks the other a question and they have to answer it honestly, or else they lose the game. Similar to Truth or Dare, just without the dare. :)      Anyway, I need some funny things to ask him. I always end up being the one to come up with some stupid question that I probably already knew the answer to.      I don't want crap like "What's your middle name? What's your favorite color?". We're MARRIED for god's sake! I know a lot about him.      So, just some funny questions I could ask him would be greatly appreciated!   They can be sexual or whatever, I don't really mind.. Just try to keep them at least semi-decent!      Thanks! ;)
20090128155722AAMWzVC	Family & Relationships;Weddings	White Goth Wedding...?	I've always had a thing for the dramatic and after I chose my dress and my girl's chose their dresses, I realized the contrast between my stark white and their jewel tone indigo and bordeaux.  So I began to read several articles on Billy Martin's wedding and after listening to the score on Corpse Bride decided that I wanted my wedding to have an dark, ethereal feel to it.    The Maid of Honor:  http://i63.photobucket.com/albums/h128/L...    The Bridesmaids:  http://i63.photobucket.com/albums/h128/L...  http://i63.photobucket.com/albums/h128/L...  http://i63.photobucket.com/albums/h128/L...    {If their chest are bare they will have an amulet necklace and all parties will have jeweled chandelier earrings} such as these fom 1928 Jewelry {these are also the colors}:    http://i63.photobucket.com/albums/h128/L...  http://i63.photobucket.com/albums/h128/L...    And my dress and veil:  http://i63.photobucket.com/albums/h128/L...  http://i63.photobucket.com/albums/h128/L...  http://i63.photobucket.com/albums/h128/L...    I'm detailed I know!!    I plan to do most things myself.      This is the church and the ceremony area {Both already finished but no new pics, sorry}:  http://i63.photobucket.com/albums/h128/L...    I didn't take a picture of the reception area but its white with tulle and christmas lights hanging fom the cieling, we can dim the lights and the tables are round.    So after this long introduction, now to my question.      I would like an ethereal ceremony and reception with everything white.  I am planning to use music scores by some Tim Burton movie's and the Twilight score including Bella's lullaby as well as classical music played throughout the reception.    I just need some advice and tips on how to incorporate a ghostly, dark mood into the pure white wedding and reception since I want no color except for the bridesmaids.    I would appreciate answers and just in case I am in no way goth nor am pretending to be, I'm just an overly dramatic, over the top young woman who wants to have a beautiful wedding.    Thanks in advance for your kind answers...

I feel like I have to steer the relationship, cos if I don't,it just dies out. I have to call, go over there, make a plan for us to go out.   For the past 6 months, we have darly seen eachother, because I stopped going over and calling. The other day I told him I loved him( he has heard it before from me), and got off the phone with him and texted it to him and then asked if he loved me-he said"of course".    Then I said"ok, then, let's get on with our life's together once and for all"   He has been calling and texting since, and I am going over there tomorrow. Any ways or ideas how I can have him take more of a leader role?

So once I told her my crush, at Cheer practice at one of the girls house she screamed KC LOVES *my crushes name*. Then I tackled her. Today were were in LA and she threatened to tell my crush I liked him because I laughed when people asked what a mark was on her neck (she told me but won't tell anyone else) after I told her that I didn't like him anymore so she would stop saying things like that.  Then today we were playing kickball and I was joking I was gonna kill her for not helping me, and I'm doing a report on Scott Peterson so I said I was gonna wait till she was 8 months pregnant then smother her then throw her into the San Fransisco Bay (AS A JOKE), then she said I'd get pregnant by my crush, even after I told her I didn't like him anymore. What can I do to stop her from doing things like that?

We are getting close to four years. I don't want to date him for much longer. I want to be married to him, he wants us to get married soon as well. And I want us to be together. I am in college and so is he. Would it hurt our relationship to get married? What does too young mean? I don't think we are too young....I know people we get married after knowing each other for a shorter period of time. Also I think if we made it through high school together we could get through anything. We also made it through my first two years of college, which have been complicated. Is marriage going to cause more problems?

20090128163720AA3Dy6T	Family & Relationships;Family	Is it ok to be jealous?	Hi. I'm 17, my sister is 11, and my younger bro is 8 (i'm saying our ages for a reason, lol)   So, my sister and I are usually very close. We do everything together, and she looks up to me. But ever since my bro and sis played a Wii game together, she stopped talking to me, and started hanging out with him more.            I started getting jealous, because now we don't hang out as much, she barely talks to me. whenever they laugh about stuff, and I ask what was funny, they both say nothing. I feel left out, lol. I know I'm older, and shouldn't care, but it's hard to have people ignore you that you love.         So, after that long thing, is it ok for me to be jealous about this?   What can I do to make my sister talk to me still?   Or should I stop worrying about it?   Is she spending time with him because they are near the same age?      Try answering all questions, and be specific, give details. Thanks!

20090225143953AAeX3jd	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My marriage is not what it should be and I'm looking at other men?	It all started 6 months ago on vacation when I met a guy from the UK.  I live in the US. We kept in touch via email then went to phone calls (we've had 4).  Now I can't stop thinking about him, when will he call.  Right now my heart is breaking because he said he would call in a few days and hasn't.  He has no idea I feel this way and I don't think he sees more than a friendship..this is all playing out in my head.      Okay now I thought my marriage was okay before meeting this man.  Up until this point I worked, raised a family and for the most part all on my own (husband works a great deal).  I barely had time to think.  I recently (past year) stopped working.  Now that I have more time I feel like I am seeing things I haven't in the past, as though I woke up.  I love my husband but don't have a passion for him and don't think I ever did.  This new guy has awakened so many feelings that I never had with my husband and even if they not based in reality, I'm afraid that I'm am missing something in my life.  I would never have an affair and I don't want to leave, but I'm not sure how to get back my happiness or if it was all an illusion that, because I was so busy, I never recognised. Please don't think I'm a bad person as I walked into this will the best of intentions and now I am ruined.  I find my self looking at other men, not wearing my ring...This is not me. I have never even cheated on a boyfriend in my life.   Married 13 yrs w/2 kids.

We've made eye contact like twice and his eyes get really soft when he looks at me. Its weird though because sometimes it seems he is ignoring me and then other times its like he really likes me? WhY? Also i dont know why but suddenly he started taking interest in me just a couple of days ago when ive been in his class the whole year. Why?? Oh and one more thing. Do you think he was trying to impress me or something?? Today at our mardi gras party at school when i walked into the hall with my friend i saw him across the room and he was like doing the Michael Jackson slide walk lol. He did it right when i walked in do you think he was trying to look cool or impress me??? Thanks!!! I dont know why he doesnt talk to me though?? Is he maybe shy he talks to all the loud outgoing girls and im pretty quiet. Thankss!

You say something to embarass him, shame or simply make fun of him in public or private.    Call him stupid.  Make him look like a fool that can't control the bad manners of his wife.       How would you like it if he would show you the same disrespect?

We'd spend most of the time just talking. Or would that be too boring?

20090225143758AA9L6XB	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My life is getting really out of hand, what should i do?	I'm 17. Recently I've been having some family issues at my house. my sister has severe depression, my dad is getting surgery, and my mom has been talking about how rocky their relationship is.   I've spent the last 2 months on the verge of a nervous breakdown, but thankfully i have good friends to help.   anyway, the only thing that I've really had to keep myself happy and my mind occupied is this guy I work with. I've liked him for about a year. For the past few months he's really let on that he likes me. He's 23 (I've known him for a few years, and completely trust him. Also, age of consent is 17 where I'm from. ) He's shy, sweet, funny... but doesn't drive.   I've just become so frustrated with everything in my life that I really don't know what to do. I really want this guy to get his license, ask me out, etc. But I need a stable foundation right now, and I don't think he's going to ask me out anytime soon for a few reasons.   1. I don't flirt, he probably can't tell who I like.   2. he can't drive   3. the age difference.   4. we work together   Should I let go of the one thing that's making me happy?       please take seriously, mature answers appreciated. best answer chosen.

20090128161701AASMVGf	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Big Time Relationship Problems [guys answer please & ladies too]?	okay, so a while back, in September, i met a guy, at an undisclosed place which id rather not say, and i guess it was "like" at first sight. we hit it off, and after that we decided that we wanted to keep in touch after we left the place we were at [which was for like a week] so we did, and i found out that he semi-cheated on me, because im not sure if we were official. so i was really mad and i didn't want to talk to him, even though deep down inside i know i wanted him back. so after that he still messaged me and the whole bit and i wouldn't keep the conversation because 1. he's on of those guys who for me its hard to do that and 2. because i couldn't tell if he was seriously into me, so there wasn't a point in gassing my head up thinking we were serious. so we recently got re-re-connected and i found out that hes in a juvenile detention center, hes in a gang, he got caught up messing around with the law, and personally, i love guys like that. i don't know why but its a weakness. my friends tell me i don't need a guy like him, but he's so sweet to me. now i don't know if it could be me being naive believing everything he says or what. so i asked if he was gonna call me one night, and me being a stupid girl, i stayed up late waiting for a call, and i never got one. now my question for the guys is: is he still into me & should i bother trying to keep a relationship with him and for the girls: should i keep this relationship & what would you do if you were in my shoes. thanks it would really mean a lot to me.

20090225144042AAyCBmz	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	His friends are breaking us apart?	Okay so I and my boyfriend argue a lot. We sound like a married couple of the verge of divorce. But we always make up and move on. This probably stems from the fact that we have known one another since we were kids. He was the boy next door who put worms in my ice cream and I was the girl next door who kicked him in the groin. But I am madly in love with this guy and have been for years. We bring out the best in each other. I never get tired of our pointless arguments and always look forward to being with him. I am pretty sure he feels the same way.       Anyways his friends are not really all that bad. They are just looking out for him. They see us arguing and such and wonder why we are still together. So basically they have concluded I am some hell cat in bed or some other superficial reason as to why we are together. So they tried to get him to break up with me. He told them they just didn't understand our relationship. So anyways they started using the guilt card- that our relationship was ruining their's, bros before hoes ect. So Ivan agreed to hang out with them more often and such. Well this obviously wasn't there goal. So now they are going to the point of lying and manipulating, just to get us to break up.      I don't want to make him choose between me and his friends, but I don't know what to do. Any time I talk to his friends about this they same I'm full of it. And now I am not so sure what Ivan(my bf) is thinking. His friends are breaking us apart.      What do I do?
20090225142535AAYkvst	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do i still love him? is this normal?	i have been with my bf for 20months now. we have just 'half' recovered from a break up, as today we discussed our faults and agreed on having some space. but im still having some problems.       firstly, we split due to his arrogance whenever we argue. he broke his promise so many times after saying he wont make the same mistakes again. however, he does still realise where his faults lie and told me that he loves me to death and that he will try even harder to make this work.      secondly, i have forgiven him a little, for what he did. i told him that i love him and want to be with him but i need time as i dont want to rush into things again and then get hurt again.      now i dont know whats happening. part of me doesnt want space from him as i cant live without him, but the other part is scared that he may break his promise again. i know he loves me, but i am so confused about what i want right now!! i actually rang him up, even after we agreed on having space, telling him how i feel. he said that he doesnt want me to feel confused and is willing to give me a couple of days space, and that he will be waiting for me. he also told me again and again that he loves me. what do i do???? :(
20090225141914AAJDy7Z	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should i go out with him?	Last week i mat this guy, we start to talk about each other jobs.

Just a minute ago I told her to look at this bump on my lip to see if it was a blister or cold sore, but she tried to touch my face, and I asked her not to because I am a germaphobe (I dont even like touching my own face) and she gave me a dirty look and told me I was not better than anybody else, and I wasnt trying to say that?            And just last night.. she went and got a snack and then not too long afterwards my dad got what she had been eating, and she made a big deal about it. I mean, that is something me and my brother would argue about? Not parents? I dont know, she is just a very difficult person and I dont know what to do.            Yesterday she said she was tired, so I suggested she go take a nap. Well she said she had laundry to do so I told her I would take care of it after I finished my math homework and she ignored me and did the laundry anyways? I dont understand?

20090128163457AAif6qm	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How can i explain it without getting him angry?	I have been married for almost 7 years. He was a wonderful guy at one point, but over the years i don't know what happened to him. His days are spent working and playing call of duty. He gets mad over the smallest thing. For example i accidently got his laptop dirty and that instantly made me a dumb ***. Today he told me my weight bothers him.  I weigh anywhere between 138-145..He joked that i was in a size 28. He calls me a b, a dumb b whenever he feels i didn't do something right. I do all the cooking, cleaning, taking care of the kids while he sits and plays his game. I am this close to walking out of this marriage. I don't even feel i am in one. I feel so disrespected, and am emotionally spent. he has me to the point where i am scared to death to mess up, to spend anything, to do anything that i know he wouldn't approve because i do not want to be called names and put down.  He wasn't always like this. We use to spend time together and we were a team. Ever since a deployment a few years ago things have changed and i don't know why..but i cannot live like this anymore. I do not want my children thinking its ok to treat your spouse like this, i do not want my daughter thinking this is how a woman should be treated.   I have always thought if you show a man respect they'll respect you in return, but sadly i think that was a boldfaced lie. How can i explain this to him without him getting angry. I want him to listen to me. i do not want him to tune me out.

I do believe her that her mom has stopped any sort of physical pain, but she still says some nasty things to her. I don't know what to tell my friend. She's not suicidal anymore, but what if something happens? i'm so worried about her, please help me!

This guy that i have told you guys about before, hes almost 22 and he went to prison when he was 18 for car theft, well him and i had wrote each other over the years, and he just recently got out and has been calling me everynight and we talk for hours. I have known him since i was 12 and im 18 now, We were best friends and i had feelings for him or should i say a crush, but now the feelings are stronger, and he actually has the same feelings for me now. And when we talk he tells me how much he cares about me and stuff. And we just cant get each other of our minds. What do you think this means?
20090128161659AAVyBqm	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can I get my boyfriend to...?	...talk more openly about sex and related things?      He's really closed about it, and it annoys me, because it means I can't find out ways to make things better for him, or to give him guidelines...I feel it's pretty essential to a relationship to talk about it, but if I ever ask something, I get a 'lol' '=/' 'uhhh' or something monosyllabic or he just ignores it...then gets annoyed when I ask again.       We've been together 17 months, so shouldn't he be comfortable with it all? If he's willing to walk the walk, shouldn't he be willing to talk the talk?      Im at a loss what to do. Someone help?!

20090128161421AAD51Sy	Family & Relationships;Friends	We broke up, and things have gotten odd. Need advice.?	This guy I had liked for a while and he liked me for awhile, decided to ask me out. We were together not that long like almost 2 months. Things got weird when my ex started texting me and my boyfriend, john*,  at the time found pictures of me topless on my phone. We broke up a few days later, and he went out with his bestfriends girlfriend.. she told John's bestfriend Joe that she was just using john, and i have all the messages. she told joe that she just wanted him to know what it felt like to be hurt, so the first week they were together, John had sex with his new girlfriend which totally disgusted me. BUT the girl was hooking up with Joe when John wasn't there...    so John and I agreed to stay friends. but he seemed distant for the first week...and i just ignored it and moved on with my life. now i loved  John and i just want him to be happy, so i accept that he is wish a different girl. There is no hate, although he did things that i won't mention that i should hate him. anyway, he has gotten clingy but it seems fake? like he is trying to be my best friend, hugging me and all of that stuff. He says goodnight at night, and has been going to the park down the street everyday, he lives a mile away and has his own park across the street. he keeps saying i'm ignoring him, but i just think he doesn't really want to be friends.    i want to be friends, but i can't figure out his deal. some of his friends say he probably misses me, but i think he wants to break me. I never cried over him, and he knows that..

Hi guys - am feeling a little bit lost.   me and my boyfriend are going on a group holiday in march with some friends but i was really cut when he didn't include me in his flight plans so i have to travel by myself to the destination. his reason for this was that in case we break up you don't have to feel forced to go.   i feel this as a slap in the face and i confronted him about it last night.      i ended up sleeping in the spare bed and he came and got me in the morning - said he thought he was doing the right thing. however i argued that he was selfish to think that itd be ok for me to travel alone on a INTERNATIONAL flight and for him to go with everyone else.   so i aid im not going on the trip.      its not the trip, its the fact the he doesnt seem to think we'll be together and hes saying his "being careful" by not including me so early. not very reassuring for me. makes me think, why am i with him today? i might as well end it now and not waste another day..   im just feeling a little lost and need some advice.

20090128162211AAtZ1Cc	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Forgive or Forget a Cheating Husband?	I would love other peoples opinion on my situation. I am a Mother of 2 small boys and have been married for 7 years. 2 years ago, I found that my Husband had an affair. I did confirm that it was an emotional affair not a sexual affair, however this still crosses the line as far as I am concerned. Day after day, I started accepting what had happened and moved on, but just last week, I was told that my Husband had been sleeping around while away working. After confronting him, he has admitted to me that he slept with 5 different women over a 2 year period. Now I know what my head tells me to do, but my heart is confused. I have my children who love their Dad very much and fear they will resent me for leaving. I also have the fear of loosing a comfortable financial lifestyle and the crazy fact that I still love the man (can you believe that? ) . He seems in a very bad mental state and seems truly sorry and is seeking help with a counselor. So I am throwing it out to you for your opinion.
20090128162240AAfXxcN	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does this girl I like have interest in me?	Ok so there is this girl I like, we both go to the same high school I am a Senior and she is a Sophomore(idk kinda weird?) Ok well I have only talked to her through myspace, and yes I know I got to talk to her in person but I'm too damn shy. I don't know her too well. Well anyway, one of my friends and his sister both know this girl so they both talk to her, about me. Supposedly, my friends sister is already telling this girl I like, really good things about me; like I'm a real chill guy, laid back and funny. She then proceeds to tell her that she should give me a chance. Why? IDK. Kind of a little to quick for me. Anyways, the girl said that she is willing to give me a chance but she just needs to get to know me better. So now this girl knows that I have interest in her. So today, during our break, she was sitting at a table with her friends. And, I was talking to some of my friends when I noticed that her and her friends just kept on staring at me. I would look up at them and they were still staring so I would turn and look away. They proceeded to do this until I walked back inside. I didn't do anything, when I probably should have. It was really weird. This isn't the first time she's done something weird like that either. So does this girl have a little bit of interest in me? or is she just really weird? What do you guys think?? Any advice is appreciated!

20090128163106AAThN4i	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does she still love me (Long)?	I have been with my girlfriend for more than 2 years now and we are very much in love. We are currently long distance with my being and college and her still being in high school (just a year in age difference). I have no idea where our relationship went wrong or what I did to her but over the past few months everything has been rocky. It all started when I asked her if she wanted me to come visit for the holidays and she said no which I found to be out of the norm. A few days before christmas I found out that she was out of town with one of her male "best friends". I couldn't believe that she wanted to go somewhere with another guy rather than just spend time with me. Out of rage I cheated on her with her best friend. We both forgave each other and everything went back to normal      Over the past few weeks she has been lying about where she has been and who she has been hanging with. Just a few days ago I was incredibly sick with the flu and to my surprise she was hanging with another guy. I asked her what she did today and she didn't fess up. She said she was getting her hair done when her myspace clearly said she was hanging with that same guy she was out of town with, with a little smiley face beside it :).       Today she told me she was sick and that she will still have to go to work. But at the time she told me she was supposed to be working she said "Im with a friend so I will talk to you later" with out a bye or anything. I just don't know what's up with her anymore. I tell her that I love her and she just changes the subject. She tries to break up with me but then turns around 5 minutes later and says that she was just joking. I just don't know what to do anymore. I love her and I have changed a lot to satisfy her but she just doesn't understand. Any opinions on this? I don't think that she would ever cheat on me. I have helped her through one of the hardest times in her life (rape) and for her to cheat just seems unreal

20090128163137AA7JDuL	Family & Relationships;Family	Is this child abuse by neglect?	I am homeschooled.  My parents started feeling like it was too hard to take me places, so they are keeping me at home most of the time.  Except I do get to go to the track to run most days.  Except for the track, though, they never let me leave our small bit of property, besides when I go to the grocery store with my dad.  It's such a relief to go there because I finally get to see something I don't see every day.  Sometimes I don't go because I feel stupid thinking that it is so interesting.      I've been basically a prisoner for two-and-a half years.  I have no friends, of course.  Could my parents be considered child abusers?  My house is so small, I feel like I can't take it anymore.  Nothing in it even belongs to me.  I have to share a room with my four-year-old sister and my dad's clothes are in my closet...I don't know when this is going to stop...help...It's basically being grounded, and homeschooled, except it's not a punsihment.  My parents just don't think it's that important that I have friends or go places.

20090225141708AA7gweJ	Family & Relationships;Family	Should I let my family come in between us?	I have been dating my boyfriend for about year already, but he refuses to spend time with my family because he is insecure about himself. I don't blame him, because when he first met them my cousins and brothers gave him the cold shoulder and made him feel unwelcome and he cant seem to shake that off. That was in the beginning though, it's been a while since then and he still seems to make no effort or show any interest in wanting to participate in my family activities. He thinks that they believe he is the worse guy in the world. It's causing havoc on our relationship. I feel like he is not there for me by having this attitude so I'm wondering if I should dump him before I get in over my head. Do you guys think it's a deal breaker?Thanks -P

20090225142508AALZBrZ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do you think about this girl?	I met a nice girl and became friends with her, and I tried texting her all day, but she never responded. When I asked her about it, she said she doesn't have text because it's more expensive than just talking and it's impolite. It was strange to hear a girl say this, so I figured this was what her parents told her. Leaving that aside, I asked her out several times and she said she was busy, even though I didn't make it sound like a date. On a day she wasn't busy, I found something we could do, and I told her about it. She said she doesn't date, she's an old maid type. The words she used were "Better to never marry and die unloved." Once again this seemed extremely weird, so I looked up her parent's names online, and found out that their last names are different, so I'm guessing they never married. Do you think this is her parent's decision?      To set the record straight, I'm not another pervert looking for sex. I'd just like to spend some time with her. We both have the same interests, and we even listen to the same music.

20090128172102AAamCdS	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Does my ex want me back?	We divorced 6 years ago.  She is 20 years younger and she wanted out.  I remarried, but last year I divorced the next wife.  So I sent a letter to my previous wife.  She called me back and we had a nice talk, but she said she doesn't want to get back together.  Then 3 days ago she sent me a text message and asked if I have copies of our wedding photos.  Today she sent me an email with 2 photos of her wearing only a thong.  If I didn't know better I'd say she's trying to get me back.  She won't have to try very hard.  I think she's the most beautiful woman in the world.  What should I do now?

20090128170126AA6XyQY	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I start talking to a guy more?	Well, I still like my ex who broke up with me almost a year ago. I've liked him for over a year though. I've tried countless times to get over him but now, I think I'm starting to move on a little. I'm a freshman and there's this senior in my class who's cute, kind, and very funny. He randomly starting talking to me a couple days ago and now I can't stop thinking about him. But the thing is, we only talk before and after class which is only for about 5 minutes for both. We can't talk in class because our teacher won't let us and if we do, we get in trouble. So my problem is that I do talk to this guy a little, but I want to get to know him a lot more. How can I go about doing that? I'm really trying to get over my ex and I think this guy might just be the one to help with that.
20090128171629AAHQ6mE	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do guys mean when they say the following?	Is it true that if a guy says a girl is "Hot" that it's more on a sexual level? For instance, when I'm talking to one of my guy friends, he will talk about how 'hot" certain girls and his female teachers are. He never says this to me though. He tells me that I'm beautiful and cute. Does that mean that he respects me and that he isn't just interested about sex when it comes to us?
20090128164934AAuMokT	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Please help! why is he being so weird? ?	Alright so, I had been talking to a family friend for 4 months, ever since September. He is 19 and im 16. And when we first started talking he was very sweet and showed me he really cared about me. he even told his little brother about me, and how im not like most girls. He would call me 3 or 4 times a day and we would talk for hours and we would talk about everything and he was so easy to talk to. And after a month of talking he asked me out, and on our first date he made out with me, which i thought was a little too much for a first date. And on our first date he really planned it out and got a really nice car and took me to see a really nice view after the movies. but All my friends kept telling me "Oh hes using you" but i never listened to them because he always showed me he cared. Like one time i hung up on him and didnt call him back and we fought and he showed up to my school the next day to apologize. But after 2 months things started to get a little weird.he would never call me and i asked him about it and he said that college is getting hectic and he also owns a recording studio..but everytime i called him he would be out .. He asked me out 2 times after the first date, but i always cancelled last minute (the day of the date) because my friends threatened me if i ever went out with him they would never speak to me. ( He came over to my house to make up for the times that ive cancelled on him, and hes still made out and done the same thing..   And the very last time he came over which was in the middle of december he went a little too far and made me touch his d*** and after that hes NEVER spoken to me again. we had a family gathering after that and he just said hi and ignored me the entire time. and i txted him a couple of days later to know what was wrong and he said nothing..and i was like alright ill call in a little bit but he said he was "busy" ..and he txted me later on that night saying happy new years and thats the last time weve spoken.      do you guys think i should call him and talk to him..its almost a month since weve spoken but its really bothering me to know that hes ignoring me like this which he NEVER does..its like i have every right to be mad at him but i really want to talk to him to see maybe theres something bothering him too or maybe hes embarassed of what he did.      btw were not together.

20090128165148AASwb4g	Family & Relationships;Friends	How can i tell her?!   HELP!!!!!! I NEED ADVICE!!?	this girl really likes me... i mean she LOVES me to the extreme...      i don't think it will work out.       ya see, she sends me messages, like... "the rose you gave me, when i get home... i look at it and think of you for hours"  she also told me...   "i broke the bracelet you gave me playing guitar hero. i cried a little... but i saved the beads in a cup that says... LOVE" after school, today seeing her. i just start thinking... i don't know if this will work out.  i was talking to her once... and i said... "why did you choose me" she shot back at me... "because, your heart is warm, your real nice, respectful, and fun. i would never choose anyone else" and i asked her another time... "ya know... just out of curiosity, what would you do if we had to break up?" she responded with a small tear almost thinking about it. "i would cry for days and probably skip school for awhile, and just die inside" then she hugged me... "i love you!!!" she said" i was thinking... "GULP. this will be hard." but i just played along... i don't know what to do. she will get REAL depressed and probably cry every time she saw me. and plus she really is dealing with a lot of family conflict. then when i break up with her, she will tell her mom and her mom will probably be relieved... her mom is strict...   and another thing... one time she was really sad... she ran to me and started crying in my arms.      she is really sensitive, she sometimes just needs to cry, and she will come to me, we've known each other (as friends) for a long time now, she really wanted to kiss me, and she hasn't been able to yet... by the next day she will probably cry enough tears to make a lake. i think this is what will happen...         HER (her name is Alexandra): (walking down to class, see's me, then runs to me) "Hi Ian!" she says with a big smile on her face.      ME: (frown) "this is going to be hard to say, but... (sigh)      HER: (looks in my eyes) "what's wrong?"      ME: (holds her hand) "i don't think this will work out... ya know... us"      HER: (looks sad) "is there someone else?"      ME: (sigh) "no... but i still don't think this is working"      HER: (tears) "no! please tell me your joking"      ME: "I'm not"      HER: (walks away with her head down and tears falling on the ground)      ME: (feel really guilty, and walk away)                             LATER         ME: (i see her in her social studies classroom, just with her head down and tears occasionally coming from her eyes) (i keep looking, at her still feeling guilty)      TEACHER: "Ian, pay attention."                                             THE NEXT DAY         ME: (see her outside, with a hood on her head) (i go over there, and say to her) "It's OK Alex."       HER: (dose not respond for about 5 seconds) (then looks at me) "ya know you ran over my heart with a giant semi truck."  "i bleed for you, ya know"      ME: (a little confused) "what do you mean?"      HER: (sigh) (pulls up sleeve to reveal all her scars on her arm)      ME: (frightened a little)      HER: (cry's a little bit) "i hate you" she says softly.          i don't want that to happen to her...  if you can... give me some 'how to let her down easy' kind of tips... thanks
20090128164905AAiwP40	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Please Help! Confusing feelings About Ex-Girlfriend! Feeling Really Trapped!?	Hi guys I know this is pretty long but please help me out if you can find it in your heart to aid a really down college student.      I will choose a best answer and dish out points whenever possible      Alright so basically, my ex-girlfriend and I broke up like 3 months ago because she said that she needed time to "grow up". Basically, we decided to still be friends because we really still like each other and get along great. However, I am still very much in love with her.      The problem is that lately I've been feeling really down around my ex and kind of jealous and I don't know why. She's basically perfect at everything. She's very attractive because a lot of guys flirt with her, wears size 00 pants, exercises constantly, her parents are wealthier than mine as she lives in a half a million dollar house and her dad retired at the age of 48, she always gets whatever she wants (material-wise) i.e. she has two pairs of Uggs, wears all Abercrombie clothing, gets the newest iPod every year, breaks her cell phone at least 3 times a year, has two pairs of Sperry type shoes, and gets Tiffany and Co. jewelry costing around $175 once a year (She gets all this stuff usually for Christmas or just because presents but she always gets whats on her list of wants), she makes friends easily, has time to join lots of clubs in college, works as a store model for Abercrombie and has a higher GPA than me while majoring in journalism, and sometimes I feel like she has all of God's blessing even though she is extremely atheist.      However, I am the complete opposite as I always work for what I get. I'm in one of the top 10 business schools in the nation but struggle to maintain a 3.0 GPA and spend most of my time studying, I haven't met very many people in college because I'm trying to save money by living at home with my parents (my ex lives in the dorms which her parents pay for), I spend all my free time at home, I don't find myself as attractive because I've only worked for American Eagle and I am Asian, my parents want me to earn things so I have to work to pay for my clothes, cell phone, car repairs and other stuff I want unlike my ex, and lately I've felt like God's deserted me even though I try to follow his teachings.      I just feel crappy to the point that I've been unmotivated to study and I want to sleep all day. I've stopped going to the gym and I have been wallowing in my own self-pity, I'm always wishing that my parents were a lot richer because my ex gets to finish college at her own pace while I'm pressured to finish in 4 while her parents can also afford to let her take summer classes to make her workload easier while I don't have that luxury.      The only thing I feel like I have an advantage over her is that I know how to invest and save my money better than her because she can't save her own money at all. She doesn't even know how the basic definition of a stock or how a credit and debit card work. I am very ambitious and always look for ways to make extra money through investing and saving but I always still feel down because I know that she'll still get ahead of me in the future because her father is already investing money for her for her retirement in the thousands already.      Despite all this I feel like God's let me down. Why does he bless people that don't believe in him? Should I stay away from my ex even though I still love her? She is white and we've known each other for 4 years and dated each other for 2 and a half years. Can a relationship with 2 different people like this work out again? Why do I feel this way? I get really jealous because no girls flirt with me at college compared to guys hitting on her. What should I do?      -Please help torn college student

20090128171025AAJhTNZ	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Do you think this too much red?	I have a white dress, white shoes & veil with white gold jewelery and a silver diamonte brooch on my dress. I am having wine-red roses. The groom is having a black suit that has a very long split jacket, with a black pinstripe, red vest. I have one bridesmaid, whose dress is satin in the same wine-red as the vest and my flowers. There is one best man/groomsman and he will be having a wine-red tie. Is this too much red? Keep in mind I can't actually change any of it, I'm just wondering what people think!      Should I have red tied around the white chair covers, or just have white satin? The chair covers are very matte so the satin will probably still stand out. I was thinking about the red satin but wonder if it will be way too much? This is something I can change, I haven't confirmed with the restaurant yet.      :)

20090128165217AAu23gJ	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Is it just me or do my parents really suck?! Help!?	Okay, I think my parents are way too overbearing and snooping. I will give you some background information on me first, so you can see if what they do is right. I have had my boyfriend (who is serious) for a very long time and I am involved sexually with him but we use protection and are extremely careful. I am four months short of being eighteen. I have gotten jobs, and proven that I can be reliable and mature. I make wonderful grades in school and got scholarship offerings and I'm talking to different colleges. I've never gotten into legal or even school-related trouble. Yet my parents still think that I deserve to be snooped on and completely put in the spotlight for my whole family to laugh and judge. They always dig in my room as soon as I leave the house- once I said I was going to a friend's house, and I did. 2 minutes later I came back to my room and saw they were snooping in it because I forgot my cell phone and purse. They do it when I am at school as well. I recently got in trouble for my private notes and condoms. My boyfriend's parents also punished him for having condoms in his room. Why? We're almost adults, we're responsible, make good grades, make pretty good money, everything. Why are my parents so worried about it? They snoop on my computer, my iTunes, iPod, read all my diaries, notes, and have even tried to drug test me. What is up with that? My mom always thinks I am stealing because I periodically purchase new makeup that is a little on the pricey side. My parents say they're saving my life for snooping on me, but all it did was break trust and now I have serious issues with them. Punishing me for being sexually responsible? I'm so close to being a legal adult! I should be able to have sex without being punished.  My parents also will not allow me to get a license for the fear that I will "sneak out to parties." I'm almost a freaking adult! I don't even know people that go to parties!!!    I haven't snuck in my parents things yet they still snoop around in mine. Should I snoop on them too since they clearly won't respect my privacy?

My partner and I have spoken about moving in together hopefully withing 6 months - 1 year. Just renting, not buying.      I am renting with two other girls, have things pretty well set and love living out of home. I have no worries about the thought of living with my boyfriend, we get along great.       I am just concered his parents won't take it too well as 'I think' they look down on me for some reason, I don't why? I have a great job etc, I'm just a normal person, don't get into trouble, etc (I am 21, he's 23)      He has lived out of home before with friends but moved back after they moved interstate.

20090128165721AAKY0PP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does she like me regardless?	Okay, so for awhile when I pick my kid sister up from school, I always saw this other girl who, I felt would always kinda give me looks, I then saw her at a school mixer.      A couple days ago, me and my friend went to her school's formal, me and my friend went as friends. Both of our schools are single sex. But i saw this girl there again, so at the after party, I finally started talking to her, she seemed really interested and shy, while her friend did a lot of the talking, I still caught her looking at me, she told me to text her sometime, and gave me her number.      So we got into a conversation the next day, a long one, but she told me she just started dating her ex-boyfriend the week before, so now, a week later, she said she just broke up with him cause he had been cheating for a while. And while i was talking to her, she said she didn't like being restricted to one guy. So is this what she really feels, or is she still just pissed off at her ex, or is she trying to make me jealous or something?

Hello, my name is Lindsey- I know my username says Mike, that's my brother.     Anyway- I have been with my boyfriend for over five years.  We are together every single day.  We have a great relationship.. we are mean't for each other!  We plan on getting engaged this year.  We have talked about marriage a lot here lately.. I think HE is more excited than I am!   Anyway- here is the issue.  I am pretty sure I am pregnant.  I haven't taken a test yet due to weather in my town- can't get out!!   I have a health condition that makes it hard for me to get pregnant.  (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome)  My boyfriend says that if I am pregnant to keep it... and he is overly super excited.  I am SCARED to death.  We both still live at home... His career is slow- he can't work during freezing temperatures.. and I just finished school.     I know for a fact I will marry this man at some point in my life.. and I really really do not want an abotion at ALL-- my family would absolutely freak if I kept the baby.  (I do not know for sure if I am pregnant or not, but signs point to yes.)  Money is super tight.. and I am the kind of person who hates asking for help, and money.  My family isn't poor nor rich.. but I hate asking them for money.  My boyfriends family owns a huge company that brings in millions each year- still.. I don't want to live off of someone else.   Here's the really big problem- while I still do not know for SURE.. my boyfriend really wants me to be pregnant.. We have still been having sex, and it seems like he is trying to "fertilize the egg".       I have talked to him about this, and I said it would be BETTER if we weren't pregnant, but it's OK if we are.  We can make it.  Why would he be trying so hard?  He is already thinking of names and such!     Whats going on?  What should I do?  How can I let him know just how scared I am?

20090128163751AAEtZHJ	Family & Relationships;Friends	Somebody- What to do when ...    ?	What do you do when you're the ugly friend?   My best friend I guess never realized that she was perfect until this year when new people are coming up to her and asking her out and asking her to hang out.   She's kind of leaving me in the dust, but that's okay because I think she's changing for the better by being more comfortable in her skin.      But now I feel even more insecure than I normally do, I hate being the ugly friend. No one notices me and people hate me because I guess I don't look friendly. I always thought I was friendly, but I guess I'm delusional.   I tried expanding my friend circle, I'm being a lot more friendly to people and asking them to hang out, but she's still my best friend and we still hang out all the time.   Whenever we go some place I feel like all eyes are on her and I end up making myself have a bad time.   I don't like having my boyfriend hang out with my group of friends because they're all pretty and I don't want him to get distracted.      My best friend is a real flirtatious girl, without really meaning to.      What should I do?

20090128164132AAzM3F8	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Plz help me, I BEG OF u!!!!!?	Ok so in 6th grade i was at a middle school but then because we moved houses, I had to go to another middle starting 7th grade (im currently in 8th) and soo like i met this one boy in one of my classes and he wasss soooo nice like he was super sweet, the only guy that seemed to care for me he did nice things like get my stuff from my locker, walk me to class, opened doors for me etc. So then I started liking him (more than friends) but then at the same time, ppl were getting to know me more and i had a lot of friends and a really good reputation.  Most of my friends (girls and boys) didnt approve of him cuz they said that he was a looser and super ugly. I didnt think so, so i continued talking to him and what not. We got to know each other really good, it was like he knew everything about me...what i liked, what i didnt like, etc. Then of course the week of valentines day, he asked me out and we began dating (last year). But then I was  sooooooooo stupid and dumb and retarded and what not and i listened to my friends and i dumped him after 4 months:( He cried and so did I! He said i was his first love:( Sooo  sad. Then i dated other boys and i realized none are like him and i wanted to be w/him again but then I changed my mind and said no cuz like we r only in the 8th, i shouldnt be in a long term relationship and commit to someone----thats something serious. So then, I broke up with him again! Then i dated other guys and he never even dated another girl after me he said if its not me, its no one else. And yes i do admitt that prior to the relationship, I did think he was BUTT ugly but then after dating a while, its like it didnt even bother me and i didnt notice it anymore. I saw him differently then every girl at my school. So then this year i dated a guy and broke up w/him cuz he was just boring then i dated another and he was tooo talkative like he took away my spotlight, all he worried about was himself. And now like 3 weeks ago i confessed to the first guy that i still had feelings for him and he was all happy and he said he knew i was gonna snap out of it and come back into his life. I reallly do like him like a whole whole lot so i feel  that if i say no, he will move on and possibly find another gf (lose him) but then if i say yes i feel like i must commit to something thats long tern and to be quiet honest, im deffinetly not ready for something like that......im just 13!! So yeah....what should i do??? I cant keep him waiting forever!! Im confused and fustrated with myself! I H8 myself for loving him. And i know what ur thinking....that girl knows nothing about love, shes just  a little girl. But ive dated A LOT of boys and i felt liking towards them but this one.....its like i think about him day and night nonstop (and no, he wasnt my first bf so dont say its just first love, cuz its not) So really, what do i do?? HElp?!

Needless to say, it is VERY hectic to keep everyone's schedules straight when I am keeping track of 4 children, and my husband works 12hrs/day, 5dys/wk. plus weekends! My mother-in-law flies for free (family perk) and thinks nothing of flying into town without notice (or to my husband only, who doesn't say anything until the last minute!) very frequently! I have a VERY busy life to keep-up with as it is, without another person to distract things in my home. My husband thinks I'm being ridiculous because it's family, however, he's at work so much that he doesn't understand how difficult it is to have another person in the home. Besides that, I never know when she is arriving, or how long she'll be staying. I come from a family that is very detailed and scheduled, and I find this to be rude and disrespectful that I don't have a say in my own home! Would it be wrong to let my mother-in-law know that she is welcome to visit, but it needs to be discussed first, and dates need to be set ahead of time?

I find myself in a rut. So far in high school, I've come to question: where's the balance? If you're too loud, you'll come across annoying and obnoxious. If you're too quiet, you'll come across as weird, and creepy. If you're too intelligent, you'll come across as pensive, and boring. If you're too imbecilic or brainless, you won't be taken seriously. If you dress differently people think you're weird. If you dress like everyone else, people think you're an imitation. Is it like this after High School too?

My boyfriend, however, has about two years left of school and just started to take out loans. His parents did not save money for his schooling (nor his siblings'), but they are also in a tough spot because his mom died of cancer a couple years ago. I just don't know how I feel about marrying someone who has tons of debt. I really would like to wait until we are both financially stable. After college, I want to go to grad school right away and get my master's degree in Education so that I can make more money as a teacher, but my boyfriend thinks I should hold off so that we can pay off his loans. I just think it's unfair and unreasonable that I should have to work to pay off his loans when he isn't even a good student, and there aren't even many jobs in his area of study. Also, I hear that the longer you wait to go to grad school, the harder it becomes. But... I'm open to hearing other people's opinions - I'm okay with hearing that I'm wrong and not being fair. Has anyone been in a similar situation? Did you marry someone with a lot of debt, how did you work out how to pay it off, and where are you now? Any advice?

He is a fan of wrestling and wouldn't accept that wrestling is fake after I told him hundreds of times that it is so he threatened me. Later that day I told my friends about it and we puched him a few times in the parking lot earlier today but he wasn't really hurt bad so I don't think we will get in any trouble if any at all. Will we?

I am a Muslim girl living in the united states, and i am madly and deeply in love with a Christian guy living in Europe. we meet 6 years ago and we both just fell inlove. i tried to stop myself as much as possible because he wasn't neither my religion and nationality. but i couldnt because its true that you cant stop your heart, he is the sweetest most honest person you can meet. he is a good guy and loves me alot. he is great in every way. i dont find anything to complain about except his religion, i mean im fine with him being a Christian because although im religious but not to the extend, he isnt either. but my our parents just wont accept it. we told them about us and they just went bizarre, and there is no way i would marry him if it means i would lose my family for ever, but i also cant let him go, please help us . what can i say to my mother to make her understand? she needs to know that love conquers all and i would let him follow his religion and he will let me follow my religion. but they dont understand and i want them to be there in our weddings and be happy for us. we can get married on our own and run away but i dont think of that as a choice because i dont want to do that. please help! any advice?

20090128171633AAxe3jk	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Has anyone used contemporary music during their wedding ceremony?	I'm planning a wedding for June 2010 and I'm trying to take care of my little details first. I've seen many different sites offering suggestions for contemporary music (ie things you'd hear on the radio) during the ceremony. I have many songs I would love to have during at least the prelude, and I don't even really want to walk down the aisle to any version of a piano song. I just want to know if anyone has used music instead of classical songs during their ceremony. Also, any suggestions or examples would be welcomed. I would love the wedding to represent my fiance and I while still remaining elegant. Is contemporary music during the ceremony tacky?

I have my eye on a Tacori engagement ring setting, but am trying to stick to a budget so that would mean I'd have to go for a smaller sized diamond to go into the setting. If I wanted to, could I just change the center stone for a larger diamond when funds were available in the future? Is it possible to do this with engagement rings or can it not be adjusted to accommodate a larger diamond once it's been set? I don't want to buy my dream ring setting but have to settle for the rest of my life on a diamond that's not perfect for it.

So i couldn't wake up in time i woke up at 7.30 sharp because my friend had rang me a few times.. and my mom had left already.

20090128181303AAYoQ5Z	Family & Relationships;Friends	Someone please help me!?	This is going to be a long post.  I have a major issue right now, and I feel stuck thinking about how to handle it.  I'm just going to tell the story, and I'll use the people's initials instead of their names.      All of my life, I've been a shy person.  In first grade, I met ZS, a short girl who had some issues with people because they made fun of her height.  Later on, around third grade, her parents started to have problems with each other (I don't know the details) and finally her dad moved out.  She started to become a tough person, especially in middle school.  In fifth grade, I did what could've been the worst thing in my life: I made friends with JN, another girl in my class.  She was an only child.  I was still friends with ZS at the time, so we became a threesome.  At first, they fought with each other, but it soon changed.  In sixth grade, ZS and I were in the same homeroom, and JN was in a different house.  The entire year, ZS started being tougher, and I didn't like that.  I started to have fights with her, and we grew apart a little bit.  I made some other friends for a little while, like a girl whose initials were SO.  But, that year, I found out some things that made me not want to hang out with her anymore, like that she sometimes smokes with her sister.  Also, she started treating ZS badly, and since ZS was still my friend - although we weren't as close - I took her side and lost SO as a friend.  Then, in seventh grade, a whole lot happened.  First of all, I made another friend, JG.  I met him through ZS, and showed him my favorite game, The Sims 2.  He was also in my house.  He joined my clique with ZS and JN, mostly because of me.  Now, JN is the type that thinks that the world revolves around her, and she's the best at everything, and that she's the light of everyone's life.  She couldn't stand to be the only one in our clique in another house.  She transfered into House 4 (my, ZS, and JG's house) in my homeroom.  I was excited, but not for too long.  Then, my arguements with ZS came to a peak.  She was getting even more tough and depressing, and I'd had enough of some of the things she said to me.  I finally just stopped being her friend.  I was done with her, but I did say some mean things over time, which was very wrong of me.  Then, I started getting somewhat friendly with a boy in my class, KB, and these two girls, BB and CW.  I kind of liked CW, actually, but one person ruined my life: JN.  I told her, "I know something you don't know," when we talked on the phone once, and she started guessing like crazy.  I kept bringing it up just to tease her, and finally, not long after, I gave her too obvious a hint.  She somehow guessed that I liked CW, and I still don't know how she did it.  But, that doesn't matter.  What does matter is that she started threatening to tell everyone, including CW.  After class one day, she ran into the girls' bathroom with her, and I knew that was a bad sign.  She later told me that she asked her what she thought of me, and CW said, "Why, does he like me?"  JN said yes, and CW later told me she didn't like me.  Then, JN started to blurt it out at recess every day.  I constantly tried to stop her, but she wouldn't shut up.  I could've died the day all that happened.  She did it so much that every seventh grader whose name I knew finally knew that I liked CW.  Here's the scary part: I still didn't get mad at JN.  I was under her spell, as I think of it now.  Anyway, after that, something else happened with me and ZS.  We were outside for recess one day, and I was probably trying to take back something that JN took from me.  ZS, who had been so close to JN that she'd practically been a puppet, started karate chopping me and protecting her mistress, as I say now, JN.  I couldn't stand her from the fights we had before, so I shoved her off of me.  JN got so upset that she started yelling at me.  I couldn't have cared less, because I saw KB, CW, and BB standing somewhere else, and I just walked over to them.  I was officially out of that clique from that point on.  I started to hang out with KB, CW, and BB at recess, and they even invited me to go into town after school on Fridays, and I felt happier.  I considered them more popular, and JN, ZS, and JG were more of the geeky type.  The only thing was that I felt too nervous to ask any of them to hang out during weekends.  I had by then spoken to JG less, feeling that he was kind of a geek and I didn't like him as much, which I may have felt because of KB, BB, and CW's opinions, not really mine.  As time went on, not much changed until the end of the year.  JN and BB got into a fight because JN felt like BB and her friends took me away from her, and BB said that she saved me from her, which I entirely agreed with and still do.  They physically fought and got in trouble.  As one of the main people involved, I was called to the guidance counsellor to give my side of the story.  I sait that the two went into the hall
20090128173207AAyQCI2	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My guy friend likes me? ?	I have a guy friend who I really think likes me because he always asks me if I have a bf and tells me that his friends are saying we look like a great couple. He even skips his lunch period to sit with me in the library. He is cute and a nice guy but the thing is I'm not really interested in having a bf because I'm only in high school and I don't want any type of commitment until later on, maybe in my twenties?    The problem is I feel really bad if when ever he asks me out because I'm the only person he really talks too. Meaning he is very shy and a lot of people don't seem to understand, like my friends who think that he's some ugly weirdo freak. Which makes me really upset to hear them say that becaue I know it isn't true. Anyway I want to know how to give him a clear sign that I would only like to be friends? If he even does happen to like me? Please help

Should I Tell Her I Like Her Or Ask Her Out      She like always say hi when she sees me .(SHE GAVE ME A NICKNAME ITS NOTHING BAD JUST MY NAME SHORTENED AND ALWAYS CALLS ME BY IT)..    In Class last year if the teacher calls my name she would turn around look at me and smile and even now she still doesSometimes she would tell me she loves me but i wasnt sure if shes serious because her friends say it to. We talk mostly on msn and barely at school, but her and her friends always get excited when i show up. We are both 17,& a few months ago without telling me one of my friends ask one of her friends who she likes and her friend said sum guy from another school, then he asked another friend and the friend said she likes no one and is waiting for that special guy, which now makes no sense to me and im confused.       (Earlier this year she told me to write I luv her in my msn nick cause it would be funny:S then the she did the same for hers. ppl started asking us if were dating then she said she when I asked her why she removed her nick she said because she was tired of people asking if we were dating:S, On facebook she left a message on facebook and had bro in it.      We started talking less after prom & for A week in the summer she had a Bf but I didnt really think she liked him that much because her msn name was the same while his was he loved her and less than a week after she broke up with him.This summer we didn't really talk until she left me a message on facebook telling"Wats Up Long Lost Home Dog I miss U with Smily Faces ,      Recently She started saying Hi to me less but in gym I see her looking at me alot, .and recently when she says hi she makes her best friend say it to, also if she sees me talking with sum1 she will wait till Im done and she will say she woulda said hi earlier but didnt want to interpt me,& when I walk bye her class she will call me and wave with her cute smile:).       *I was at my bustop 2day and when she saw me she yelled my name so then I went to go talk 2 her , she then asked me if I get annoyed that she says Hi everytime she sees me and I said no its np. And when I got on the bus her & her best friend saved me a seat.

Everyday i hear something new about them saying that she spends too much time with me, and they get jealous about it. The thing is that one of them likes me and even told my gf and admitted it to me, and the other one likes me but her way of showing it is acting really mean with me (she told my gf too). The sad thing is they say she spends too much time with me, when in fact we have spent more time on the phone then in person. We've been going out for more then 3 months now and i haven't even been able to take her out on a date because of her parent's. She promised me that we would spend the whole day together tomorrow  after school because it is a half-day, but i think she forgot and is now going with her two annoying friends. Believe me i want her to be with her friends, we all need our space, but they act like im with her 24/7, i only get to see her between classes, and only get to spend 1 hour with her after school. They're in the same classes with her, and get to go out with her and i still "spend too much time with her". What do i do or say?            One more thing, on Saturday, she was going to out with them downtown to Navy Pier, which is Absolutely fine, but they invited two other boy's and told my gf to not tell me, eventually she told me of course, but that just makes me feel like utter crap, i mean I'm a nice guy i don't understand what i've done in order to be treated this way....

20090128173201AAOJFhc	Family & Relationships;Family	When's the right time?	I'm in the middle of a dilemma. My husband and I want to try to have a baby soon. He will be coming home from deployment in around a month. However, within the next few months we will be moving to a different duty station.    My debate is whether to wait until after the move, so that I avoid the stress and hassle of moving in my first trimester. This could lead to him being deployed again for the birth, or do we just get down to business and try our best as soon as possible to avoid . I just know that it's crunch time and we may only have one chance for me to ovulate.    I know that the decision is mine in the end, but I would greatly appreciate any input to help me pick a direction. Thank you so much in advance.

For the longest time, I've been flirting with him and I knew he could tell, because it was obvious I did it. Let's say his name is Matt. I'd be like "Matt ! hey!" and stare and smile at him in class. I'd also text him and be like i love you and call him matty (as a joke and a little nickname) but now that i've been doing it for a while I think i really DO love him.      I just had him, my friend, and another guy friend over cause we're all doing a couple dancing competition for my school. The bad thing is: my friend is dancing with matt. NOT me. and now i'm getting kinda pissed cause they were like flirting. I was dancing with my other guy friend, but i dont like him the way i like matt. I was trying to step it up by like putting on matt's hat while we were playing rockband, and i even sang in front of them for the first time. (i hate singing in front of people) and we were all dancing and having fun, but my friend was flirting with matt too.      i really dont know what to do. i reeeally like him. after today, it feels like i wanna hang out with him allllllll the time. how do i attempt to tell him my feelings? we cant switch partners, so how do i know if they like each other or not?

Now i might be loosing friends:(?	okay well, i guess we're in a little fight. all of a sudden, my best friend got mad at me for no complete reason i don't understand why. so i kinda avoided her to, and stopped talking to her because she stopped talking to me. and i don't wanna ask her why, cause im scared lets just say she can be a good friend, but when you get on her bad side she can be your worse nightmare. and all of a sudden today she talked to me a little bit, but she gave me dirty looks and i could tell that she was talking about me to other people. i just don't get what i did wrong i think she has no complete reason to be mad at me. i dont even think its worth asking her why, cause she might come up with some lame excuse or be like '' oh nothing! what are you talking about? -__-. what do i do! trust me, she can be a big huge help and a great friend. but at times she can turn into a whole different mean person. she can torture you, she would know all of your weaknesses and how to torture you. it seems like right now, she got some people to turn against me also. cause whenever i talk to some people, they end up trying to have a short conversation with me then walk away. i dont know how to deal with this. i especially dont wanna be a loner, im scared of being a loner. and trust me, i dont have anyone else i already tried finding people out there but they just weren't the right people for me.

20090128181145AACwKSE	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is it worth staying in a relationship where one person doesn't communicate well?	My boyfriend and I have been together for a year and a half and currently we are on a break. We had a big fight a few nights ago because he had some bottled up feelings inside and one night during a small argument in a bar in a drunken stupor, he's like, "ITS OVER! I CANT TAKE THIS ANYMORE!"   Turns out that he had been keeping things that have been bothering him to himself for quite awhile. During our break I have realized that I think our problem is communication and he has a very hard time communicating. He is the type that likes to pretend it never happened, without discussing it.   Is it worth it to stay in this relationship if he doesn't want to change his way of communication? Should I give it another shot??

So when I got married, I admit, I suffocated my husband and was clinging becuase I wanted so bad to be loved and secure, but instead of supporting me, he pushed away and called me crazy and siad I suffocated him too much, well with 2 years of this going on, I went to see a counselor becuase i was so hurt, and he encouraged me to show my husband that I did not have to be dependent on him. Well I am doing that and I'm scared becuase I am starting not to care anymore about this marraige. I guess I have begged and pleaded and tried so hard, but it seems he just doesn't care. So now we rarely talk and I just don;t care. I don;t want our marriage to end, but how can it survive with neither spouse caring?

20090128181050AAdaW28	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Would this behavior concern you...or does this show the depth of his love?	My boyfriend and I have been having problems. We love each other dearly, but we attend a strict church and he is divorced. He cannot remarry int he eyes of the church unless he fills out the remarriage paperwork and the church sees him as biblically released from her. My boyfriend is 32 and I am 23. He has asked me to wait for him while this decision is being made, and if the church says we cannot marry, to wait for him until they change their mind because he is certain that this will be made right and we will be together someday. This is a difficult request for me as I am young and want a family...but he is the one and I don't ever want to be with anyone else.       Lastnight I was weak and had made the decision waiting to be able to marry or be intimate with him again was too hard so I broke up with him. He is a very patient, loving, shy, self-controlled, disciplined man. His last wife left him after beating him up and being arrested for it. What my concern is, is that when I told him that I was so sorry but it was too painful and hard to wait for him, and gave him his house key back...once he realized I was planning on leaving him (after promising I'd try to stay and wait), he threw both hands in the air and banged them to the sides of his head, he hunched over and made this painful screaming noise, then went running towards the bathroom throwing his glasses at the wall on the way. He locked himself in the bathroom and curled up in the fetal position on the floor and started crying uncontrollably. It took several minutes to convince him to let me in. and when he did unlock the door, he stayed on the floor bawling, banging his fists very hard against the sides of his head and ripping at his hair saying "I'm a failure! I've failed and I didn't even know it!" and "I've made so many mistakes, I'm so sorry!" He repeated these phrases over and over. It scared me to see him like this. It broke my heart. I was wondering if what I had done was reopening the wound of his ex wife leaving him. Does this show that he really loves me and what I did was wrong...or is this abnormal emotional behavior?
20090128175001AAmVxqr	Family & Relationships;Family	Stepdad gives me the creeps...?	So I just turned 14 earlier this month and following my birthday about a week later my mom got married to my stepdad. Now he lives with us, but scares the crap out of me sometimes. Like one minute theres noone in the door way and the next hes standing there staring at me, in the beginning i used to ask him if he needed anything, and he would say no, so i stoped asking, and now when he does it I just stare and look away and then he leaves, and once he was even standing in the door way of my room while i was asleep and when i sat up to see who it was he just walks away, so i ask him not to do that because its still hard to remember that he lives here now. And anyways hes starting to give me the creeps. How can i ask him nicely to give me a little privacy and at least knock if hes going to stand in the doorway, without affending him?

What can I do to supress this troublesome love?
20090128174405AAPt3jT	Family & Relationships;Family	I don't know what to say to my mom?	Sorry that this is long! It's just hard to explain the situation.      My parents have been divorced for years now the only thing is, I didn't know it. They kept it a secret from me for a while. About 2 years ago, my dad finally told me, but I'm pretty sure he didn't mean to. I've always pretended that it didn't bother me because my older sister (15) was so sad about it. I've lived with my dad and sister and I used to see my mom around twice a year. Now the only time I hear from her is at Christmas and my birthday. She just writes me a letter. I've tried calling her, but she told me that she doesn't have a phone anymore. I try not to be upset that I have no contact with her, but lately I can't help it. I'm 13 and I don't have a mother to talk to about my problems. My dad and sister are never home now so I'm basically alone. I know people have it worse than me, but I just don't think it's fair. I recently decided to write her a letter so I can still be in touch with her. As I sat down and tried to write, nothing would come. I don't know what to say to her anymore. I miss her and I wish I could know why she left. I'm tired of crying and thinking it was something I did wrong that made her go.       So my question is what do you think I could say to her? I can't write that because I think it's too personal. Yes, I know I'm telling Yahoo Answers, but I'm just desperate for help now. Thanks you for reading this! It's so long, I know. Your help is greatly appreciated though. Thanks again.

My wife's ex is making threats about taking the two girls away from us when we go to take him back to court to have the child support amended.  Right now he is supposed to pay half of all expenses 30 within 30 days of receipt.  Of course he is not following this agreement at all.  He is threatening us with taking the girls away from us when we go back to court.  What would this involve for him?  We have taken extremely good care of them always.

20090128172304AAkjR8Y	Family & Relationships;Family	Was I Asking For Too Much?	Hi. I am fifteen. I want a $15 I tunes gift card. I have no money. My parents complained that I don't know the value of money. I wanted to impress them. Instead of asking for my parents to buy it for me, I wanted to earn it. I asked for an allowance if I did chores. They refused saying I was too old for an allowance. I asked then how to get the gift card. They said to get a job. I have tried to get a job before, but I couldn't because I was too young. I can't get a job till the summer, and I am busy during the school year volunteering and spending time after school with my Latin teacher.         Now I don't know what to do. I feel resentful of my parents for not allowing me to have an allowance. Should I?

20090128174926AAboF0p	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	What would you do if one parent disagreed with your choice of colleges? more info included?	Here's the story. I wanted to stay close to home so i was looking at WVU Institute of Technology or Marshall University (both in West Virginia). I like Marshall better for several reasons: newer facilities in my program, more friends, more to do, not as dangerous to travel to in snow storms. I can get most of my college expenses paid for through scholarships and grants at Marshall. WVU tech has it's pluses too, but I don't think I would be happy there. I have talked many times about this with both parents. My dad thinks Marshall would be a good fit, but my mom doesn't. She mainly doesn't because she thinks I just made the decision to be with my boyfriend (He's just a plus, I was looking at the school even before we started dating, Plus the programs are nearly identical now and I wouldn't have to travel as far.). What should I do? I really like Marshall a lot.      Also, how do I tell my boyfriend's parents if I do go there? They love me to death, but because of some previous family issues they are fearful of having their son and his girlfriend on the same campus without some sort of supervision.

20090128181633AAyiOaT	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you think my girlfriend cheated? ?	Ive been with my girlfriend for almost 3 years. a while back a two people told me that she cheated on me with some guy. i didn't confront her at the time because i wanted to get some proof before confronting her. finally i confronted her about it and she denied it. I\i keep asking her about it and she finally admitted that she did cheat on me. we argued and finally being the dumbass that i am i forgave her. a long while later we were talking and i asked her why she did it and she said she didn't. she said she only said she did because she was tired of me asking her. then after some time while argueing i brought it up again and she said she did bang him but it was a while before we got together. what do you think? did she cheat?

20090128181142AAZMlR9	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What does this mean? Men only please?	My husband and I have been married 4 years we have two children ages 3 1/2 and one at 3 months. He has been married before but divorced after 2 year because she cheated on him while he was deployed and she felt that he was "too country" for him. He swears they are just friends but she calls him baby and sweetie. About 5 months ago they get in contact with each other which he hides from me and I've only found out about 2 months ago. We fight about it, he says they are just friends and he needs a friend to talk to, and I say it's ok as long as he doesn't hide it from me, but he does, he deletes his calls and texts everyday before he comes home from work. Then a month ago he tells me that he's not been happy for over a year. He doesn't get that warm feeling when he sees me anymore. He loves me, but there are a bunch of little things wrong but he can't tell me what they are. Then He tells me he wants to go camping by himself to think and clear his head, then last week I found out that his ex-wife is also taking a trip close to where we live, their individual destinations are less than 400 miles apart. When I asked him about it he swears he's not going to see her, and that he didn't know anything about it. Is it a coincidence? Or are they going to meet, and when i suggest that maybe he put it off for another weekend he got REALLY upset. Whats going on in the words of men?

20090128175543AAjtLIw	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Am I waisting my time?? What more can I do?	Too make a long story short, when I was 6mons prego (Im 8 now) my child father (who I was engaged too, living with and who was ecstatic about his first child, and just wonderful through the WHOLE pregnancy )decides he no longer wants a relationship with me or the child in a span of 4hrs.  He then proceeds to change his number and I haven't heard a word from him since.  Well me thinking he's just getting nervous, I send him baby updates and such following my dr. appts & of course he doesn't respond. Well my question is What should I do?  Should I continue to force the information upon him? I can't make him love our child or should I just leave him and the whole situation alone and send him a pic when shes born? Or should I just let it all go and just let him get served and he can be a check daddy?.. Im so confused and heartbroken.. Can someone offer some advice..

20090128181428AAh5BCs	Family & Relationships;Weddings	RE- being forced to marry someone i dont like. (im explaining everything more clearly)?	in my other question i never explained or gave details properly. so in this question i will explain more. my mum and dad is really strict. they never let me out of my room unless i need to go out of my room to use the bath room or to get something to eat. A couple of days ago when we were having dinner my dad told me he wanted me to marry his best friend's son who is a doctor and who is also 8 years old older than me.(i am a legal adult) one day my dad got promoted to as a  lawyer and had a party. that was when i met him i didnt know who he was and he didnt know who i was either, i was just walking out of the bathroom when i saw him (im quite isolated to the outside world. ive been home schooled all my life and because of that ive never made any real friends) he aked me if i knew where the toilet was because he couldnt find it, i told him where it was but he said my description is confusing so i walked him to the toilet. then he turned around to face me and he smiled at me and told me that he wanted me. and then i walked off because i had no idea what that meant until i asked one of my cousins. my parents are both lawyers so they're abit more strict then most other people's parents but they also have another reason for being so strict. i had an older brother who ran away from home to be with his pregnant girlfriend, then it turned out to be that his girlfriend was already married, he got depressed and started using drugs and he died because of drug over dose. my parents got really sad and my mum wouldnt eat for weeks after his death. i dont think she is over it yet, they are worried i might turn out to be like my brother so they've been really strict on me. i know they cant force to marry him but i want to make my parents happy again maybe if i do agree to this marriage then they would be proud of me for once.. when i said in my other question my life would be ended i didnt mean i will go and take a knife and cut myself, im not that sort of a person.what i meant that my life would end because i made my parents dissappointed in me, my only goal in life is to make my parents happy and to be proud of me. im sorry for writing so much bt i had to write every detail. ive decided to go and get married with that guy. and thank you to everybody who had gave me some really good answers.
20090128181638AAqJzA5	Family & Relationships;Friends	I lost my closest friend. What do i do?	My best friend and I were really close. As much as she put me through, I ignored it in order to keep our friendship. She treated me really bad and I never said anything to her. I went out with this guy and after we broke up I started to think about straightening out my life and becoming the person I should be. So I started defending myself and not letting her take advantage of me the way she did before. I also stopped telling her everything the way i used to. But now she's saying that I changed for the worse and that I did all of this for a guy. I want things to get better but there's no reason for me to apologize. What do I do to make things work?
20090128181649AA1gKLx	Family & Relationships;Family	Does someone have a suggestion about my last names?	My parents never married and my legal last name is both of theirs. My dad is in law enforcement and I'm going to be a police officer someday, so my plan is to use his name for work. But I'm debating about how everything is going to work when I get married, because I do want to take my future husband's name. I thought about taking both, but it sounds awkward (it'd be Rowley-Lee). Sounds simple but I can't figure out what to do. Thanks!

I know it's a complicated question but it's something my s/o and I are facing right now.      Lately she's just been accusing me of doing things for her because I'm needy and I care more about getting her approval than about her.

20090128183051AAZ74nD	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why is this happening to me ? Is this normal post divorce depression?	My divorce was final dec 4th 08, it was a rather long drawn out ugly affair. I married the wrong person, I was her 3rd husband and she is already onto #4. I have a 2 year old son with her, I had to relocate to her hometown in order in be in my sons life. Therefore I have no friends or family here that and I have taken a 60% pay cut in the process. At any rate something has happend to me over the last month. I am not being the person that I once was. I feel darker and withdrawn, let me make it clear that I do not mourn my x wife as she was poison to me. The divorce was ugly cus she lashed out at me for moving to her city to see my son. Her other babies daddies are far away and out of the picture. To this day she tries to get more money from me all the time. She even admited that she would stop being this way with me if I left town. I refuese to do that, I need my son. Perhaps that is what this is all about. When I have him I feel like I am alive, I feel home. When he is gone I feel so dark, I feel empty. In the last month I noticed that I am drinking a lot more,never with him around. I also am loosing interest in things that I should not be. I have a parenting plan, but it sucks. Every other weekend and weekday visit do not cut it for me. I am having a hard time keeping it together at work, sometimes I will look at his pics or drawings and it makes me cry. Or I am home and I will look at one of his toys and it just makes me feel so broken. At any rate I will stop ranting, I just wonder if there is a way to get thru this without seeing a dr.

20090128182631AAjhM4X	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Am I an idiot... please read?	I just got off the phone with my X. He says his new wife of 17 days is filing for an annulment. (Can't blame her.) Probably not true though. ~ But, don't get me wrong, I have no intention of anything with him. I actually can't stand him for what he's done & not doing for me & the kids. ~ For a moment I felt sorry for him & then I thought why? He's a leech. He called me for advice, sympathy, whatever... he said he wanted to see the kids. Snow day & all. So, he got another call & then he said he'd call me back. I waited & waited. Called him, got the voice mail... text him... "I thought you wanted to see the kids, but we have other plans now." ~ How do I stop him from putting our lives on hold or from being at his conveinence? ~ When custody came around, he never showed & I told the master I would have visitation as agreed. The guy lives a quarter mile away. He pays no child sipport or alimony. I just wanted out of the hell. ~ Have I made a mistake? I can't ignore his calls. I can't really say no when he only sees the kids once a month if that... It's almost like he's still in control. The kids want a relationship. So, I have tried to be open... Help. Advice on this would be helpful.   Btw, he's leaving for St. Bart's for 6 weeks again Feb. 1st. He has a friend that has a place there & leaves every few months for 6 weeks at a time. He's taking his new wife I think... They can afford that, but not to help with the kids? I am an idiot aren't I?

20090128182105AAowqbv	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What would you do if your husband did this to you?	My husband of 5 years is a great provider and a good dad. He always yells at me really, really loud on various occasions. His family has seen the way he treats me. My 3  year old son said to him one day Daddy, do not talk to mama very "woud!" he can't say L yet. Anyway the other day we were arguing and my husband physically throws me off his chair and I got so scared I ran for the phone which was behind him. He must of thought I was comming at him but I wasn't and he threw me again physically from the air to the floor. He grabbed the phone from me and I ran upstairs, he came after me and grabbed all four phones from me. He is strong. My son was crying. I was frightened I finally told him if he doesn't leave and go downstairs I would scream for someone to call the police for me so help me God.  I am very scared. I don't know what to do. I left and went to my mom a couple days and she is telling me to save my money and leave. His parents are talking to him but I don't think any of them has told him this is unacceptable behaviour and he has not sought out counseling. I have though. I think that night he exploded because he is understress. He is very angry with me. Even now. I just think he is stressed out with all the jobs he is doing right now. He is probably worried about money because I can only tell you and you can only believe me when I say I did nothing to warrant his anger. I wake up in the morning and give him Hot lunches, tea to go to work. I have dinner ready when he gets home. I try to clean house or he would complain. Despite all I do he still finds something to complain about. Tell me please. Should I stay or should I go? He thinks he is right. I don't believe he would seek out counseling on his own.

I am ruining my marriage by always getting upset when she leaves or talks to him. i am not and do not want to be this controlling *** but as much as I know she is not cheating the little question in the way depth (What If) still lingers and i always act on that rather than be who i want to be. I need to understand and change who I am about this and move on with my marriage and enjoy who and what I have . I don't know what tomorrow will bring but the one and only thing I know is I love her and do not will not live with out her Thank you
