qoS3gUukaa	I joined a site called Yahoo Answers, and I got addicted and wasted my life answering questions. The end. Xx|`|AA11631965	lived on a farm|`|DkP14oJaaa	The weirdest thing I've ever done was ;;    When I put on a blanket around my neck and  started running around my ex boyfriends house  acting like spiderman!!! ;] That was the best   thing EVER! than I got a milk shake hahaha.|`|6F32sfLeaa	i called up my principal and abused him....|`|wE2etBzbaa	Watched p-rn  for more than 10 hours, after that my balls were hurting,  and everything was wet    Edit:  people who gave me -2 , either jealous, religious freaks or can't believe it, but it was true and the question about weirdest thing, and that is weird.|`|zth3G2b6aa	i have danced on the top of my jeep with my best guy friend. the song playing was sandstorm by darude. it was hott.|`|NBjta8Kyaa	well  umm  the weirdest thing iv'e ever eaten is jelly fish      the weirdest thing ive ever done isnt very appropriate  for this    LOL|`|8CTLfMGZaa	I was singing very loud and practicing to scream, then my neighbors are comes to my house, scolded me for annoyed them!  hahaha! it was happen about 3 years ago!
6e17209667f5095dbf74ca7bd2427f10aa	These guys seem a bit impatient to me. Probably they are just hunter, going around to look for a "fast shot". If a guy really interest in you, he will wait for you to be ready.|`|tC6MG0nyaa	dont play hard to get... if u r interested in the guy say yes, or else no...|`|F3VPADcRaa	if they show intrest in you then you say lets be friends, it's not what they really want. all they want is to either be with you or they just want to get into you pants. that's what most guys want. if he was really into you then he would respect your wishes and just be friends untill he knows you are ready for a real relationship.|`|W2rCKPbBaa	cuz maybe they just become your friend because they want you....its happened with me too but now i try to keep it slow with any guy i think is goin to turn that way with me...dont worry its a guys stupid nature...|`|6eKqfXkwaa	WTF ..you must be some catch if after only weeks they confess thier undying love =/|`|tQ6IxTfwaa	GOD,i mean,what is it with girls,wants to know me well first?girl i can pretend to be the nice guy on earth,just coz i want u even for 100 years.and i wil change after i impress u,so whats the use of getting to know each other,if u like each other,then go for it.
2f41ea2602e30f4f0556ed46e45b7055aa	Well,  Know the fact That you are God Element...the Pure Soul.  Life is active till soul is there in the Body...Body becomes useless with Soul departed.  Now, A Pure Soul is dictated by Intellect and Karmic record.  Five senses are receptors and Brain is a store of Karmic Sanskara's.  Memory of Repeat Sanskaras becomes intellectual opinion of Ones Own Ego.  Knowing the truth as above...if you have a pure Soul, unpolluted by Egocentric opinions and behaviour ..you will find all souls you meet are lovable.  Your neighbour's Wife Must be truly lovable...despite your Ego.|`|2R5mNJWZaa	thats real awkward question! you cant be God nor have experience to talk of him in this manner. God loves everyone regardless of size,colour,intelligence etc. on behalf of your neighbour thats really upto you coz i have never been you! you are best in answering your own questions|`|q4nEp0Rbaa	Yes, I would say I would like me.....  Im always nice and even though I have made some mistakes in life Ive never set out to harm or destroy anything or anyone. What more can you do?  When my times up and Im standing in front of God and he calls me on all the things he thinks Ive done wrong I might just call him on a few of the F@ $ ups I think his made!  But Im thinking his answer will be the same as mine....  "It wasn't intentional"|`|cBKpDtWNaa	I don't can answer your question ....I also not a God .......Katie.|`|T3AYLMg3aa	yes|`|AA11861437	mad fellow :)
76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	I think that's a cute idea!  I think if women have to wear a ring to signify they're taken, men should too.|`|EQOnbP3Qaa	Yes!! Were looking for a ring kinda like that, men suprise you they like diamonds too!|`|haCssg2Laa	i wouldnt by my OH  a diamond ring  small diamonds or not    i know he wouldnt want or wear one   he would prefer a plain or celtic band    if you are sure your guy is into something like this, then well done  i'm sure you know his taste better than anyone|`|gWCj87Y4aa	ide like it...can i have it? my bf will love it|`|R1zUIh7taa	Does he like to wear rings?  What will he do with it once you get married?  I guess you can figure this one out on your own, since you know him the best.  I would just answer those questions.|`|zdpp7cubaa	It sounds beautiful and I'm sure you know your fiance well enough to know what he would like. Congratulations, on the engagement by the way. =)
Zf18VjlCaa	Her getting to work isn't your problem, neither is the 23 year old gamer that doesn't work... tell your husband he needs to tell them to get out. You graciously let them into your home after being newly married and she is walking all over you because she think she can do it cos it's her son. She will ruin your marriage. Don't be afraid to voice your concerns... it's your house.. not hers. You didn't marry them... you married him...|`|AA11648899	1) set limits  2) enforce them.|`|zrUbBiFdaa	simply tell her its YOUR car and you can use it whenever you want to, it doesnt belong to her in any way at all. but you have to find a polite and well...nice way to say this to her because fighting will just lead to a bunch of family problems.|`|iDqVy21gaa	She gets the bus    And you get her and your useless brother in law out of your house    Good luck    And your Husband must put his foot down and not leave everything to you|`|fca3b6ac45b683b2c3cb75b6bfcba848aa	.......v sailing in the same boat...i mean(mother in law problem)  um sure shez not out alll the time....so weneva u catch a car ..home jus take duh away.......afterall u gotta get ur checkup done......|`|jYLZYxDvaa	Tell her to get her own car, and you think she is selfish.|`|SKNFNC3waa	just say please give me the keys to my car,i really need it.take a bus to work,kick out the brother in law or tell him to get a job|`|MUDDyIKtaa	I won't beat around the bush here so "KICK THEM TO THE CURB" she is supposed to be an adult here, you and your husband need to discuss a plan of action to take care of this, otherwise it will continue on and on, sounds to me like someone is getting taken advantage of here.SHe has a job, get a different car. I am sure she can find a couple hundred dollar beater for the time being. And as for the brother in law- get off the duff and do something or get out!  ITS YOUR CAR!|`|Q2aW0LCTaa	Tell your monster in law (lol) to go with her job and go to a used car store, buy a car and after all that is done tell her she got three months to find an apartment. Same with your bum brother in law. Also tell your husband that he needs to enforce your and his will, tell him to stop being worried about hurting their feelings and be a man. After all is he not the man of the house?                                   take care                             -Matt|`|DcVoq5Tuaa	meeting time. get everyone together and go over what is expected of everybody. Who's going to pay for what, who's going to use what, when? get everything in writing. Give them a deadline to move out on their own and stick to it. You marriage isn't going to last if they continue to stay there.
Iarvsn7yaa	Yes, it is normal, but people do stupid things when they're young, and so it is important not to hold anyone's past against them.|`|vh0yVJ7daa	Well why would you wanna marry a hoe?To me if a girl has had more than 4 sexual partners before marriage she is a hoe...|`|GYkOoQwAaa	I think that it is the most Beautiful feeling that  a husband  be jealous of his wife that reflect that he is a real man and he love his wife..   you must be jealous for her present more than her past if she is not that respectable in her wearing or type of talking with others .. be sure that if a woman don't care about jealousy of her husband then she is not sincere to him she might not love him deeply because the word I love u  are easy but the real love is not always exist.. she may find another better man than u and go to him what would stop her? any small thing can destroy your marriage because of the irresponsibility of your wife or u..  never worry your feeling is normal and if u r not u are sick no matter how much sick people around u ,u should always follow your heart and conscience which will never lie to u|`|NuUdCz0Laa	Why would I care about the past.  Everyone has one, I'm sure you came to the marriage with a past also.  So get your head out of the past, and look to the future.  Your wife married you and loves you, so you apparently had more to offer than anyone in her past.  So count yourself lucky.|`|aOjMf5SPaa	Hmmm, if my husband told me he was jealous or annoyed at how experienced I was, I wouldn't sugar coat the numbers anymore. I would tell him the truth, and walk away - who needs a sh*t man like that who thinks he can control my past. NEXT. (and one more notch)|`|K5IOSGXAaa	You need to grow up and stop being so insecure. You will ruin your relationship with thoughts like that. Go get counseling to get your head straight.|`|i1rDJY2aaa	Her past is her PAST. This means, it's none of your business!!    Grow up.|`|417a83c7cb091ac86d2ec601c9b825e2aa	I am not a guy, but I don't understand why it would upset anyone,. The past is the past and it needs to stay there. She is with you, SHE CHOSE YOU. How would you like it if she constantly worried about the ones you were with before her.>? Same difference!! Please let it go sir, you are going to have a wonderful marriage if yo do...Life can be so simple and wonderful but you can't let things like this bother you.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	Look at it this way--if you divorce her over this, you can go out there and date all kinds of divorced women with pasts.  lol    I think this is a sign of immaturity when people are focused on this instead of building a great future together.  And generally, I consider negative emotions like possessiveness, jealousy and insecurity to be the problem of the one who has them and he or she needs to get control over their own emotions so they don't destroy the relationship.|`|FzFSzilmaa	makes no difference to me... meant she was experienced and knew what she wanted and how... :D    i married her cos i loved her, not for anything else... her life is her own... i do not own her or fixate about the past...|`|JjoLo4e1aa	I am cuz i married a porn star, who only did lesbian movies, so im jealous of all the sexy gals shes slept with, but im holding out hope for a 3some one day.........|`|jTtNE6dmaa	So you have no past?    You married her.  Why would you marry someone if you had a problem with their past?  Why would she marry you if the past still mattered to her?    Unless she has given you reason to suspect the past is not in the past, you are being....well.....a jerk.|`|RP6Xmvxsaa	no im not bothered as for me if i truly loved somebody , i will forget all the past i will love her if you love somebody you must be understanding and open minded|`|ZSAbJEv6aa	Should you be?  When you decided to marry her, it went with the promise to love and cherish her that you forgive and forget whatever was her past.    It doesn't do you any good dwelling on your wife's past.  What is past is past, you have no part in that just as she has no part in yours.  Move on, build a future together and be happy. =)|`|AA11809359	your past makes you who you are.  if  you didn't have a past you would be someone else, different.
5acf40d2aa61e65eff15834add1f7bd5aa	I would confront him first and ask what the hell that was all about before you make it public knowledge to your mom and go from there.....Good luck|`|kEeUsdnYaa	BARF.    My question is that he pashed you for FIVE SECONDS..5 SECONDS...as in    "A thousand and one,  A thousand and two  A thousand and three  A thousand and four  A thousand and five"    And you just stood there?    If one of my cousins did that I would have whip lash for jerking my head away so fast.    Yea. tell your mum.|`|IPS3hWweaa	He finds you attractive and was in the mood. Good thing your mom was around.|`|wE2etBzbaa	what age are you? if you are under 18, tell them.   if you are above, say  NO if you don't want.      but now you ll tick  incest-freaks from the US will tell you how this is bad and how it is terrible even though cousins can marry in most of the states.    but I'm only concerned if your cousin is terrible and criminal.  I suggest you tell your parents anyway|`|zth3G2b6aa	EWW INCEST|`|5HeNp5tjaa	weird where are u from?

I could last close to an hour when I was 19-25. I don't really know now that I am married.    It really depends on the girl your are with.  If they can keep you turned on during sex, you can last a while.  My wife used to be this way. If you find this girl and experience it, you will never forget it.      WARNING: This mostly will not be your lifetime partner.    Male 31, Married.|`|iTJ2YIH5aa	i liked the answere of that guy,lasting long is nothing but the problam reaching to the state of orgasm.|`|Kes3oGPqaa	Stephen, you don't last long, you're having trouble coming.    anyway, a couple of minutes.|`|Oo1uQf2yaa	30 sec|`|VTR2kqcQaa	Well, i think it all depends on the situation. Sometimes, i (or the guy) just wants a quicky...and in that case, it doesn't last very long...10 minutes tops. But, if you're talking about average, I'd say that most guys I'm with can hold on for a WHILE...half and hour to an hour? Or at least until I've *** 2 or 3 times.
ise05jjUaa	Well it could go one of two ways, she's playing you means she's kidding with you as in joking or teasing.  It also could mean she's working you like one of those marionette puppets.  You're basically at her disposal, if she's talking about playing you like a hand puppet.|`|hwFs3F0Waa	most likely she meant she had fun but she's not interested in u or she said that she was just using u|`|yktlEbZeaa	it means u her rebound. she hanging with other guyz but when they cant go out she will always go 2 u|`|E6In8bW1aa	Not good dude.. not good.|`|17FKGiJbaa	it means she is playing with u. it can only lead to unhappiness if persisted in.
9Kkf1RfTaa	Watch the movie Fireproof. It just might change things.
tFC13Xsgaa	just be yourself and ask her our quick  I'm a lot younger and i have a girlfriend   i asked her our and she said yes and she has a good personality, and also amazing looks
PyRxe9B2aa	Why approach her at all. SAY GOODBYE That should explain the way you feel.  No one treats a friend like that and stays a friend. She is whats called an enemy. Let her loose.|`|AA11861437	you should also get her embarrassed in some way ...  watch the movie hitch
xb7ey8c0aa	You will always worry about your children, but you have to let them solve their own problems so that they do not become dependent on you.  Spend more time together as a couple, use that money you used to spend on the kids and travel, start a new hobby and volunteer.

It drives me insane.  Just talk about anything.  You know the stuff you talk about with your best friend tell him, or if you have to, bullshit an interesting story that's believable.  Say anything tell him what you did what you wanna do.  Don't make the whole ride silent or with a weak sound track on an iPod.|`|wE2etBzbaa	Hi My name is Eric and I'm calling you from God customer service not, how are you doing today?    well say anything, talk about religion and the kingdom of God, and heaven and bible.   that will turn him on not    otherwise talk about anything, lots of topics , they bring each other|`|FzFSzilmaa	take some music to play, and just listen to that... :D|`|tXlvg1ahaa	Pack a picnic basket with all sorts of nice goodies to eat and drink.

That sort of thing.|`|Qyue0Ykgaa	Turn on radio, listen to conversation, and songs! sing :d your way there.|`|RQ9KdIwlaa	There are so many words ,like ..sorry, excuse  me, hope ,etc.    anything you will get in return.
Iarvsn7yaa	You should forgive and forget, but it is hard. Its very normal to be jealous of her - otherwise you wouldnt love her.     It doesnt mean that you don't forgive her about her past, it means that you are jealous someone else shared her. And women feel the same way about this too towards men.     Most people end up having sex outside marriage because they don't count on marrying a virgin. They don't believe it anymore. What makes them answer so boldly like "it was her past" is simply because they have a past. In fact, they intended to have a past because they knew that their wives would have a past, and that's what reassures them.|`|WzAHKILcaa	I think we can both make educated choices based on our past experiences. Neither of us is judgemental about it but we can definately appreciate our compatiability after realationships where this was lacking.|`|FzFSzilmaa	why are you fixated about it??? perhaps this says more about you as a person... and that maybe you aren't mature enough to go into an adult relationship...|`|HxKCvUb9aa	yeah it bugs me  but its important to remember that their with you now|`|Qyue0Ykgaa	Yes it bothers me, and no she didn't, neither did I. God made girls for marriage not for shooting practice.|`|BfmV2KpUaa	That's something you need to quickly get over. Everyone has a past. As you get older, you'll realise this and it becomes far less of an issue, at least, it should. If you get jealous over a partners history, then you're not emotionally mature enough to be in a relationship. What matters is who they are with now.    My thumb-downer is likely a hormonally-challenged teenager.|`|Lo23vA2Oaa	Oh hell yeah!  That's why I prefer virgin guys =D    They might not know anything at first, but not once I'M done with em!    I try to get over it though, because everyone I will ever be with... chances are they will have a sexual history. I just try not bringing up the person.. not to bring up any past feelings and such.    X.|`|dSMb8JDvaa	Yes! (May be because my husband is my first) I know it is good that man should better have some experience before married but I don't think he should tell her all details like who, where, what....because women's brain can memorize this source of information of her man very well. And that could relate to future argument.|`|kEeUsdnYaa	This is something that bothers me severly.  Thanks for reminding me, BUDDY.    what bothers me about it is that I am saving myself for my wife one day, whomever she is.    I feel that if she hadnt saved herself for me, she would not understand WHY I saved myself for her and therefore would not appreciate it.  That hurts.|`|4x8ONJ5eaa	Not at all. everyone has a past, what really matters is your future together. x|`|WWNWtzvDaa	nope ...as long as they haven't brought any STIs from their last relationship to the one they start with me    EDIT = how would the kids know =/ ...... its not something you discuss over sunday lunch is it  ...|`|hiY7CCc7aa	Yes it does bother me, but I mean I guess there isn't much I can do - they are in his past|`|wE2etBzbaa	No, I only want to know how many, and did she ever tried something weird, or something she does not do with me, and whether I'm the best, because i know I'm . but just to hear it from her.|`|tC6MG0nyaa	to be honest, yes it does bother me..|`|FaKZTIe7aa	yeah it does. i prefer not to know or not to imagine it.

1Byis7Flaa	Sit the hubsand and the son down together one day,   and speak calmly, and tell them,   I love you guys, and I enjoy doing things for you,  but I need help.  Then tell them both::  put your clothes in the laundry basket.  pick up after yourselves,  set the dinner table   and put the dishes in the sink/ dishwasher  *it be great if you could do the dishes once in awhile too    thanks     specifically his son, develop a relationship with him  not a step mom, type, but a friendly relationship  don't yell, don't scream..    and show him his baby sister/ or brother...|`|SsfnitjXaa	Sorry to say you are typical step mom.  Some dwelling on the fact that this son is a product of your husband having sex with another woman. That 10 seconds happend over a decade ago.    Personally when I see my husband's son I smile.  He is 50% of my husband (the fact the other 50% is my husband's first wife never enters my mind).  Your husband feels guilty about not being their for his son and that is the reason he lets the kid waste his time playing like a 2 year old.  There really is nothing that you can do about it.  However on the other hand I would not be a maid to him and clean up after him (as I don't do with my own teenagers).  After he leaves, go into the room and remove all food, for sanitary reasons, strip the bed, wash the bedding, fold the bedding and place it on the bed, he can make it himself the next time.  Leave all the crap where he leaves it, unless he puts the dirty clothes in the hamper you provide in the room don't was them.  The next time he comes his pig sty will be waiting for him.      I have to tell you though, we decorated my step sons room in the college colors of his choice, everything has a place and we really don't have a problem anymore with him keeping it neat.      May I also suggest since your husband is not interested in actually doing anything on these visitation weekends and spending any quality time with the boy (which is really the reason for the visits, not an excuse to get away form his step father) may I suggest you plan those weekends shopping, visiting your mother/sister and just keeping out of the way.    Your husband is being a lazy parent, what a shame.|`|mXYxRsB5aa	It's always really hard when your partner has a child. As for the he is on holiday bit, i would say to your husband , this is his second home not a holiday one, that means he is part of the family and has to act as if he is , this means doing chores.   I don't know what else to suggest, but i really hope that things get better for you|`|oSmFTHQ5aa	jus try your level best cuz even he is a human being and wants someone to love him.......|`|PyRxe9B2aa	Fake it till you make it. Just pretend to love the poor kid. If you love your husband and this will make him happy,  just do it. He is your sons brother and hopefully they will be friends forever. I hope you can find it in your heart to try to give this kid some happiness.
ise05jjUaa	I know you're asking the girls, but I've never felt that there was anything wrong with that & I understand what you're saying.  Besides dating is merely two people getting to know one another better & figuring out whether they would like to get to know each other better or not.  I wouldn't be mad if she was dating someone else at the same time as well, as far as sleeping with other men or women while dating others.  I would think this person wasn't serious about starting a relationship, I'd think they were just out for the sex.  There's no commitment when you're dating, unless you both agree to it.|`|0zdHykkSaa	it doesn't fly with me. I am happily married now, but when I was dating, the guys that did that sort of thing got dumped if I found out he was doing that. I am special and I want to feel special by my guy. not just another fish in the sea.    now I never minded just dating to see who I liked, but it never involved anything physical. usually dinner or something to get to know him and I usually knew after one date whether I liked them or not, and then I would move on to the next person but I've always been one person at a time.    and call me picky, but I always only dated virgins since I was one myself. If I even thought the guy wasn't he was dumped right then. I want more substance in a relationship than just feeling like another used thing. and have more respect for myself than that.|`|2619ac5601e4ab0451baa7ec9c4a082faa	i'd never date a guy who was dating other girls at the same time...i've got better things to do with my time than 'compete' for some guy|`|HzV1LeIvaa	Depends.  Monogamy is between two people and two people only.  Concepts in monogamy could be emotional, sexual and social.  This is the basic relationship.    An open relationship would consist of more boys/girls.  However, this is dating one person while still seeing other people.  This is harder to explain, but that one person would have the emotional string, as well as the sexual and social, while the other person would not have the emotional and social concept of this relationship.    If the person is single, then it is relatively normal for him/her to be seeing more then one person, if it is mainly sexual (and safe!) then it is healthy, seeing what you like in one person, and dislike.|`|5O1HtiqAaa	they will NOT be pleased soon enough they will find out and you WILL be hit by as many as you were dateing, i should know my boyfreind did it to me!!!    SO DONT!!!!|`|OE8r1VtRaa	i think its kinda wierd as what if they picked you but then had second thoughts or maybe liked all of them and decided to play all along on the saide atthe same time, im a woman so i'd instantly disagree, women are so paranoid and jealous and defensive and controlling of thier men, nasty as it sounds we're pretty much all the same its imprinted into our dna lol.    So my answer would be i dont agree with this approach to dating.|`|VXiMtwIsaa	If hes sleeping w/ other girls then there a f*ckin W*ore!  And no girl wants 2 be 2nd best!
eTTkAv9Yaa	You don't mention work...do you work, are you still at school?    Living costs add up, after a couple of months if you are not paying your way you are bound to feel unwelcome.    Why can't you sing?  You can leave the house at your will, right?    If they don't want you singing in their house then you have to go with it.    Edit: Get a full time job then, with the minimum wage in place you must only be working about 5 hours a week, not even one day - what do you do with the rest of your time?  Do you think the world owes you something?|`|12Aifvf4aa	Is it that you need somewhere to rehears. try your local pub if you can use a back room (providing you are old enough) or a local church if they have somewhere you can practice for free.  If you are looking for somewhere to live, try the local social housing organisations to get your name on their lists.   If you only get 20, is that an allowance or wages? don't know your financial situation is but are you claiming any benefits, you can apply, it can't do any harm?
1VKOqf1Xaa	Ignore the first answerer!     I have seen this kind of situation happen lots of times. Very often it results in a beautiful relationship because the parties involved know each other so well and most likely know their families also.    I understand your fear of being rejected since no matter what you still want to be friends with the guy. However I think the bond of friendship will still endure even if at this time he has an interest in someone else.    So my advice is to go for it!. Let him know how you feel and how much he means to you. You will regret it if you do not say anything. The pain of always wondering what could have been will be worse than any rejection.|`|262016589c2b056459386b15672dd2c8aa	Dump your bff for him or just stay out of it.|`|CMhSvyS8aa	Ask him how he feels. Like, simply. Not complicated talk. Just like your friends. Ask him out, after a couple days of talking and bonding. See what he says then.|`|Mjn6Fr7caa	wow, like 'princess diary' much.be girly . if u likes a tomboy, boys think u r their friend.now, just say ur true feeling .don't be afraid. coz may be he likes u too but u don't know. hurry or he 'll find another girl . gd luck, sis|`|d70zRUS6aa	I suggest asking him a what if question just joking around.  Drinks will help, cause you can always play it off the next morning.|`|g4Cpi1fnaa	well ask sum1 that u trust, like ur bff 2 c if he would ever b interested n u, or wut kinda girl he wants.|`|gkJrmFwqaa	another whore putting all females to shame|`|hwFs3F0Waa	either u secretly date him (kinda cruel if u ask me) or  talk to ur bff about it and see if its ok with her.|`|FC32XPnzaa	I think you should very subtly flirt with him and see if he flirts back before you tell him how you feel because if you tell him how you feel and he doesn't feel the same way then things will be awkward between you two. At least if you do some harmless flirting first and he flirts back then you will get signals that maybe he's in to you too. Good Luck!! My older brother had a few hot friends when we were growing up and it was always weird when crushes came about.
MN9535Itaa	Well, everyone is gonna look at porn sooner or later. If its right or not. No, its not especially at that age. I would talk to his parents and give them a heads up.|`|IPS3hWweaa	Yeah, thats bad. As in against the law bad. I'd drop hints to his parents, and if for whatever reason they didn't get it, I'd drop an anonymous note to them explaining the situation.    Also, from now on, don't shake his hand.|`|LamVaAETaa	No its not appropriate! But he is still going to do it anyway.|`|cDubFtwlaa	yes im 11 and i used to|`|op4gBJRJaa	Yes it is perfectly fine to watch it at that age because thats when you are in to your teen ages, your hormones develop.  Watching porn is the best way to release stress as it feels extremely good, many children watch it at ages below that which are very young but 14 is a fine age.|`|JdmwlvSRaa	no if u r 14 u could be in prison for your whole life. If nobody in your house get you that doesn't mean the police will get it. They could find it in their computer what u watchin|`|CkuJ5vbmaa	yeah..but everyone does|`|uwWUx1Uoaa	Well... that's a tough one. It's honestly a matter of opinion. So I'm saying this from experience since I'm 15 right now, but I know last year at my school (When we were 14), pretty much every guy watched porn and jerked off to it. It's just a hormone thing. I'm pretty sure it's fine for him to be doing that, considering everyone gets "urges", but if he's talking about it a lot at school and if he's getting addicted to it, then no, that's not appropriate.     The general idea is that everyone does it, but you don't go around "bragging" about it, and you do it in moderation.    Just tell him to be careful and not go overboard.|`|52b0f62af53dd437245aea3bc2df6601aa	If he masturbates that isn't the problem...most teen and adults masturbate, but porn is NOT appropriate for him to watch.|`|EMUcJ5JPaa	Tell him to stop doing it immediately, porn is just another form of sexism and coming from a girl it's first of all disgusting to know some girls can fall that low and second of all that some boys are just pigs to watch all of that quite happily! If he doesn't stop tell his parents or whoever, this form of sexism has to stop.
N85XB4jZaa	it could just be a little reminicing.  when its random and u feel like this for a couple weeks or a couple days.  u just have to realize shes not the only girl in the world buddy, and there r better girls that will love you and NEVER want to lose you, and the only way u can find that girl is meeting them.  so just go out wit ur buddies, and meet some girls. and soon youll forget about how much u missed her.  just try not to think of her that much.  i no its hard =[|`|AA11817078	first love is first love, you never forget it, even don't try to forget it, it is not possible for anybody, and in your case your ex has not cheated you, she told you the truth, why she is going away, it might be she returned to her first love.so now treat her as your friend, and move out in your life, think about your Carrier, job Future, just don't go for hunting girls, because couples are made in heaven and there is someone for you also, and she will come automatically in your life, work hard for your bright carrier.
ecb41de6b1cd7b5071902909f6a45435aa	you cannot be in love with two people at the same time...if he is in love with both then he is probably infatuated by both not in love with them...first of all he needs to sort out that who he really wants to be with on one end is his wife who for no fault of her;s has been with him and supported him and loved him unconditionally...if he was so in love with someone why did he get married???so he needs to think responsibly...what will happen to her future and why should she suffer because his love who actually went ahead and married someone else has come back???!!!secondly...will this man be able to accept fully the child his love has???it is not easy u know....he needs to sort things out...on one end his wife and married life offer a very good uncomplicated future and u have said that there is a chance that he loves his wife..so he is bound to be happy...on the other end is this other girl who is complicated probably does not feel the same way about him and may or may not accept his proposal....why risk a secure future...let the past be over and though romance seems really Nice and great it is not easy and especially when it involves a child...so make a wise decision think thoroughly....All the best|`|a1dpU3JMaa	he should prefer his wife  the end  no more to discuss|`|rvSrjNeQaa	Is he ready to have two wives ?

kEeUsdnYaa	Get a piece of paper out and get a pen.  Or open Word or something because you should do the following:    Write down what your ideal guy is.  Looks.  Personality.  etc.    Define him to the utmost detail.  You may say to yourself "this is unrealistic" and maybe *MAYBE* it is.   But at least you now know what you really want and because you have searched within yourself to find this, you are now aware of what you want and can recognise it when you meet him!    What I think you are suffering from is called "limerance"  It is a termed coined by some attraction scientist to which the name escapes me.  It is defined as a period of time where the couple are great together and are crazy about each other, the period lasts on average 2 years.    This is a reason why many people break up- the limerance period ends.    This is also incentive to date for LONGER than that before marriage or else it may fail.    When the limerance period ends, the fire/speark etc just leaves and it seems stale and 'boring'.    The only thing I disagree with this idea of limerance is that its pushed as if its a universal law, unfixable and a fact of life.    I say bullshit.    When a relationship gets boring, its because BOTH parties have ALLOWED IT to fall to that level.    What happened to spontaneity?  Keeping things fresh and unpredictable?    No wonder relationships fail so often these days.    if you want more info, I suggest you grab a copy if Anthony Robbins "Get the Edge 2" which goes into mastering your life and relationships to great details.    Awesome program! I'm so glad that I went through it, it helped me so much.  Maybe it will help you to?|`|7AfRkORxaa	Not everyone will get a fairy tale love life but you should try to settle for what you have.

If he beats you up like that you do not want to make a baby with this a-hole and model that behavior for a child.  quit wasting your precious time on him and find someone that will love and treat you with respect.  Move on, because being alone is better than riding the roller coaster with this one.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	He beats you.  You need to leave.  End of story.  Call a domestic violence hotline and get out.  He doesn't deserve to have excuses made for him by you or anyone else.|`|f4422f216561e6952afc8a35de25e36baa	Regret?  Regret what?  Leaving that piece of smelly garbage?  You've got to be kidding.  Get some police reports by reporting any I mean any more physical abuse.  Get a good lawyer, and tell that piece of crap good bye.  He is worthless as a husband, and even worse as a human being.  The only thing you might regret is ever meeting the bum.|`|4e1nRQCUaa	if you "give him a chance", you will be disappointed later.  That is not the right attitude.  instead of giving him a chance, see what you can do.  Emphasize to him that you really want to make things work, and see what he wants from you.  See if you can do that.  Sexually, it sounds like he is not really keen on having a baby right now.    Maybe he is, but make sure you figure out where he is.  If you two have different feelings on that subject, try to explain your point of view without getting argumentative or making it seem like he needs to do what you want.|`|6wzQhsIkaa	Ummmm...he will kill you soon if you do not get out. All the cheating is nothing compared to the abuse...THAT IS NOT NORMAL. And HOW DARE you wanting to bring a child into it!|`|NuUdCz0Laa	Okay, you want objective, here goes.  You have been in an abusive marriage, and I promise it will continue.  Your doing the right thing by going to school to further your career.  As long as the abuse has stopped for the time being, I would just allow things to continue.  I would start working on an exit plan, just in case.  I would open a checking account that is your private unknown account, you will need to start putting back money into it.  Your rainy day account.  After you have graduated and are ready to step back into the professional business, then you should have money saved back and be ready to leave at the first sign of abuse.  Good luck and hopefully things will go smooth for you.|`|K5IOSGXAaa	You already have your answer. You feel empty inside. You have been through too much with this guy. You need to move on. And you have found out a very good lesson to serve you in the future, which is to really know someone before you marry them, and that material things do not fill you up inside.|`|Xr5bU3t1aa	Why would you regret divorcing a man like him??  After what he's done to you, no... I would not even entertain a chance to redeem himself.  I doubt that he'll be able to do it without professional help.  But, bottom line is that it is your life.... if you want to take the chance that he'll change, then go for it.|`|x0J8S5sWaa	From my outsiders points of view, I would advise you to leave him straight away. Financial security does not and will not make you happy. What he has done, especially the abuse, is completely unexceptable. The possible cheating? You can't prove that, but it certainly adds to his list of bad qualities. But physically beating someone, choking them, hurting them or in any way taking of advantage of being the person with more physical strength is horrible...and you shouldn't put up with it. He is probably "shaping up" right now because he's worried about losing you, but in my opinion it's just not worth it. Hurting someone physically just once is bad enough and he's done it so many times. Whatever you do, don't get pregnant by him until and if you've worked out your problems. You wouldn't want to have a child with him if you end up divorcing anyway.    I know you don't want to contribute to the high divorce rates, but you have to make sure you are happy because that it much more important. You need to find someone who deserves you. And no, I doubt you gaining weight has anything to do with his behavior.    Goodluck and God Bless :)|`|h9ZqxS4Caa	Save yourself and get out of this marriage. He is dangerous.|`|nTJ8bKJnaa	Document everything you have mentioned in your question, find a GOOD divorce lawyer, make sure you know where all the assets are, and are up to date on his financial affairs and then DIVORCE him. This man will not change, however this a good chance of him physically hurting or even killing you......the violence has escalated steadily. You haven't listed one redeeming quality, so why would you think he is going to change? Get out while you still can and DO NOT get pregnant by this man, it will be a form of control that he will have over you. This is not LOVE, this is all about Controlling you.|`|gapWTVmDaa	Well I am divorcing for lot less. I mean nobody was beating anyone or drinking, we were too different. It's your choice, your life and how do you want to spend it and what do you want to achieve. I think you should forgive him and he should to you and then you decide by your feelings and rational judgment.|`|Lrf1NgUxaa	You need to get out of there.  You're trying to talk yourself into staying because it's easier.  4 months without violence?  That's supposed to be a plus?  I've gone my whole life without so much as pushing a woman and if you were my sister or daughter this guy would not have the option of breathing. This is not what you want for your life.  You can do better.  You could throw a dart into a crowd blindfolded and hit someone better.  Thank god you don't have any kids with this loser.|`|K6vEbdqxaa	Your husband is the scum of the f*cking earth!  Should you leave him? Will you regret it later?   Are you serious?  If you really need to ask this question, you are either deluded, or just not that bright.  I don't mean to be harsh with you, but c'mon!  Have a little self respect for crying out loud!  He's cheated on you (don't act like you don't have proof so maybe he didn't, HE DID), he's repeatedly abused you!  Move out and move on, and quit making excuses for being miserable!  He doesn't deserve it.|`|AA11648899	Stay if you wanna...    But that marriage is over.|`|fmIDB4ZFaa	OMG!!!  You need to go back and re-read everything you just wrote here.  I cannot believe you actually need someone to tell you to get out.  What the F is wrong with you?  Why would you stay with this Jack @ss.    ggeeeeeeeeeez!!!!|`|hpFsK6DXaa	Why did you marry this guy? Seek a priest. No joke. It might solve your religous dilema.|`|RP6Xmvxsaa	i think all you need is patience and prayers you are on adjustment period , just pray pray and pray GOD will there to help you|`|jTtNE6dmaa	No.  You should not give this man a chance to redeem himself.    1.  he does not want to redeem himself.  If he did, he would agree to a counselor.    2.  He blames you for angering him.  He is abusive, physically and emotionally.    3.  He has no respect for you - not one ounce of it.  You deserve better than that, and if you don't believe it, believe that at the very least you deserve to not be lied to and hit.    Start putting away a little bit of money at a time in a safe place.  Find your local woman's shelter and hook up with a support group.  They are fantastic, and will help you see how wrong this is and help you get a plan for getting out.      Good luck.|`|1xFwfz5Raa	It sounds like you've finally realized your sick of someone treating you so poorly.  It seems like it's a "little too late" for him, because now he has started to clean up his act, but it's too late because you're thinking about divorce.    Why would you regret divorce with him? In case you can't find anyone else to get married to and have a family?    Don't settle for less than what you deserve.  You might get a divorce and you might be single for a long time before you find anyone worthy of you, but that's NOT a bad thing.  You could use that time to yourself and to figure out what kind of a man you do want in your life.  And by dating and going out you will meet him.    You need to figure out if he makes you happy.  It seems like you already have your mind made up that he doesn't.  Next time he beats you I would call the police, and then you will have proof and good reasoning to end your marriage. The parents will understand.|`|TLzbS8AIaa	My God!  You really need to get out of the relationship.  You may think that you can endure for the financial reasons, but at what price.  Loss of you self-esteem from being beaten and made to think it's your fault for "pushing his buttons"?  DO NOT have children with this man, leave as soon as you can.  You'll get a little something, financially, out of the divorce.  But, most importantly, you will walk away with your life and be able to rebuild your confidence.  Any woman, regardless of how they look, deserves to be loved.  And love is not beating, cheating and sneaking around.  Love is holding, kissing, making love, being faithful, honest and open with your partner.    It's far better to be alone for a while and search for that man than to continue to endure what this relationship holds for you.  Please, please get out of there.  It won't be easy, but you'll be very glad you did in the end.|`|e86b89a7ddaf966bb49bf950c5769b72aa	You should have left a long time ago, your as crazy as he is if you stay!! Get out before he does some serious damage or kills you. Don't EVER have a child with this man. You want him beating up on them or worse?|`|3ee8101ef611dcb2fe20c82dfe728d6caa	Your words - I cant stand his attitude. Among other things, we're so different, and I really wish I hadn't married him, we're not compatible in our outlooks, values etc.    I know you want a baby, but a baby will not help this situation, only make it more complicated. You have wasted enough of your life on him. Do you expect his parents to babysit him forever? Even with the parents involved he is not safe to be around. I think you have given this your best shot, but there is more to life than financial security. You never know when the next attack is going to happen and that isn't any good for your physical or emotional security. You should feel like your spouse is your best friend and will do anything to protect you. You should not have to wonder if/when he's going to hurt you next because "you pushed his buttons". That is a classic line from most spouse abusers. It allows him to absolve himself of guilt because his violence is your fault, not his. Get out now before it's too late and he really hurts you or kills you. It might be one thing if he recognized he had a problem and was seeking help, but the fact that he lays it all on you is a clear warning sign that things will go back to the way they were as soon as he feels his parents aren't watching him as close.|`|UJ6D0Wm5aa	It is crazy to read that even though he does all these horrible things to you, you still can say at times he's a good person. He's the same person that treats you bad even when he's being nice to you. I know it's easier to say when you are not in the situation, but this situation will never get better. Go stay with your parents for a while, finish school and move on with your life.|`|AA11809359	long story --- didn't read it all - i really can't read about physical abuse, it bothers me to know people actually put up with that.

Easier said than done, i know.  but you need to leave, get out... sorry to be so blunt.|`|AWb0L9IKaa	In other words, you got beaten often, spit on, injured, denied sex, have to copy with him cheating, just because he is financially ok and could afford to give you a good home and a car, belief me it aint worth it, it is a part of his responsibilities as your husband to give financial security, it is not a luxury that you have to exchange for your happiness or maybe your life as the case maybe.|`|m0WUEtqXaa	read your entire account of things that have happened and you will see the answer as plain as day................|`|AA10128876	I think you know the answer, it just is painful to face the truth, but get out now before you bring a child into the  world, You could have a second chance to love again, wipe the slate clean, leave this guy before he totally screws your life up, get out now, do not prolong it, come on!!! it's   not o.k. to get hit, beat,  never never never o.k.  prove to yourself you are a strong woman and get a lawyer and file for divorce, and  ask for mainstaince, so you can finish school, you can do this.|`|dDasUgW8aa	Oh, my god- get out as soon as you can.  There is no way in hell that I could imagine staying with this man.  Why would you want to get pregnant by him?  If you stay, you will never be happy with him, and I totally see why.  Please- for yourself- get out of this situation and find yourself a real "grown-up" man.  You deserve better.   In re-reading-  5- why the HELL would you stay with a man who choked you and beat you up?  What kind of future is this?  If he comes home from drinking and sleeping around one night- and you confront him- one night he may kill you.  This is not love- this is horrible.  I would call the cops on him, as it is.  A nice home, a nice car, it's not worth it if you don't have your life.|`|c4866dcc8d04594ae3a344216f80a8eaaa	The answer to this equation  = leave him.  No one, especially your husband - has the right to hurt you.  It sounds like a movie often seen on the Lifetime Network - and by staying - you are just waiting for that ONE opportunity for him to go too far.  Then- we'll be hearing about you on CNN.     Leave!  Leave NOW
AA11861437	ya , it is a nice romatic hobby dude :)    i like listeinig to music in terrace , i feel poised and happy ...  i enjoy being lonely ....   i also have a cat which often comes to me and wags its tail when i sit there alone|`|KPXwwwMMaa	I don't know that anyone would classify that as a 'hobby', but as long as you are not staring into the sun - yes, it sounds pretty safe and relaxing.    Hobbies are a lot of fun, and help develop your personality and depth based on your personal interests. In this sense, sky-watching would NOT help develop you as a person (although it's a great, relaxing thing to do from time to time).    The typical hobbies are sports, arts and crafts, or developing a personal passion. What are your interests? Would you be interested in taking a kickboxing class? or an art class? or a pottery class? Or maybe you could volunteer at a shelter or a retirement home to develop your social skills. You could join a club or join a campaign about environmentalism... find something your passionate about and follow it.    good luck!
lAN2wFXcaa	I think you should point out to her that life has three component parts:-    1. family/domestic.  2. social.  3. work.    and that all three need to be pretty well in balance if a satisfying and fulfilled life is to be lived and if all three aspects are to function as near as damm it to 100% efficiency.    On occasions compromise is called for and generally more time may need to given to work commitments at the expense of the other parts.    If the person you are talking about spends every available hour on preparing for the next day at school when in reality there is no need she could end up with a nervous breakdown.  She must take time out to relax and recharge her batteries.  By doing what she is doing she is depleting her energy reserves and all the extra hours she is putting in are to no avail.  I dread to think what she will do during school holidays!    If she says she is a c**p teacher she may be lacking a little in self-confidence.  If this is the case, her students could pick up on this and exacerbate the situation by playing her up.    You ask "what can we do?" I would suggest you convey my thoughts to her in your own words and if this proves ineffective have a quiet word with the Head teacher and voice your concerns.  You could also ask her what is the base line she is using when coming to the conclusion she considers herself to be ineffective.  I would have thought it is for the head teacher to assess whether or not teachers are good or otherwise.  Alternatively suggest that if she has any concerns to discuss them with the appropriate member of staff.|`|FzFSzilmaa	leave her to it... just cos the rest of you wing it... she wants to do the best she can for the kids... that is to be commended... :D

It is a family heirloom|`|lYZ71zYAaa	Send it back. I'm sure the ring has a sentimental value to his mother.|`|3ccacc540edb8d292ca1dabc548ee002aa	You definately need to give the ring back.  Since, i'm sure, it's something special to his family.  Also, what the heck would you want to keep it for anyway?  I know I would feel horrible keeping it or trying to sell it.  Do the right thing and get it back to your ex.|`|JXw0U77aaa	As in any tough situation like this, I'd say it depends on how it ended.  Did he end it, or did you?  If you ended it, I'd think you should definitely return it, not just because you ended it but also because it's a family heirloom.  If he ended it, I'd still say that you should return it because it's a family heirloom...but you may also want to think about (a) how difficult it's going to be to get in touch with him or another family member in order to return it, and (b) if it's going to cause significant heartbreak for you to do it.  Also to consider: whether it'll hurt you to have the ring around.    Either way, it would be nice to return it just because it's his mothers, and it was probably meant to be kept in the family - so it would be a nice thing, for his mother, at least.|`|Ub1KbPvDaa	Why would you want it?  If you called off the wedding and you want nothing to do with him, why on earth would you keep his property.  Unless the ring is worth something...I would give it back to him.

However, it were me I would probably return it since it was his mother's ring.|`|ACecbVghaa	I would return the ring to his mother directly with a note thanking her for offering up a family heirloom.

There was no marriage, so the ring should be returned.|`|3SSVBJAqaa	By all means give it back. His mom gave it to him, to give to the woman he was going to marry.

Since no marriage happened, you should return the ring, especially since it's a family heirloom.  It really doesn't matter who ended the engagement.  If no marriage happens, an engagement ring should be returned to the person who bought it.  The only reason an engagement ring does not need to be returned is if it was given as a Christmas or birthday gift.|`|Midbg5BJaa	You should return it, especially as it is a family heirloom.|`|757f10afa027007eb6d9e797f2776feaaa	I really think you should send it back.

And if you can't find him, I'd put it in a very safe place until it becomes clear to you what the "right" use for it will be.      Maybe someone will need emergency cash for a good cause, maybe he will contact you, you just never know.|`|AsFiWxhUaa	give it back.....not only for him but for you. it obviously has some bad memories attached to it so why would you want it. if you do not wanna talk to him get his mom's address and mail it back to her.|`|EQOnbP3Qaa	Give it back!!!|`|R1zUIh7taa	Did he end the engagement, or was it you?  It does make a difference, if he ended it then you can keep it, if you did then you need to send it back.  Either way the mother gave it away, but she probably intended to keep it in the family!  I would probably do the right thing and give it back to HER!|`|mTKD9GQvaa	i think you should give the ring back if it means something to his family. but if its going to cause too much emotional heartbreak, track down some family member and leave it with them so you dotn have to face anyone for too long!

If the marriage never happened then you are morally obligated to return the ring.  The fact that it was his mother's ring makes it that much more important that you return it.  At the very least, contact him and ask him if he even wants it back.  If he hasn't contacted you for it, it may not mean much to him, but at least you know you made the effort.|`|RoEyFm5yaa	CONTACT HIM AND ASK HIM.YOU SHOULD TELL HIM THAT YOU FEEL IT SHOULD STAY IN THE FAMILY.IT SHOULD BE HANDED DOWN TO HIS CHILDREN.|`|SsfnitjXaa	The law covering who keeps the engagement ring has changed in the United States.

Sorry it didn't work out.|`|m81dfyOYaa	Send the ring back, it should stay in his family.|`|AA10820533	Send the ring back|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	Send it back.    First, it was his mothers.

You can't make some one forgive you so he should stop right there and give you your space. If you have a place to stay away form him thats a good start.     You'll need your space so you can think things over and not hive him influence your desicion. In time you'll see you dont want a man who make you feel this way.You need someone who will make you cry with happyness no sadness!     I hope this helps and that your make  the right desicions now... and later.|`|SsfnitjXaa	Do you really want "it" back inside you, knowing where it has been?  Sounds to me he is not really sorry.  He probably wants you to break up with him.  As long as you are not pregnant I would get out of this mess ASAP.  Better to cut your loses now.     If you go back with him he will think he can do it again.... after all he got away with it once, why not twice. Plus the fact you will never trust him again.  You deserve better.     Once a cheat always a cheat.|`|NuUdCz0Laa	Sorry, but you need to distant yourself from him.  To cheat on you after only five months of marriage is not a very good start.  He is still a selfish little boy and obviously is not ready to give up his boy friends and his childish actions.  After your separation, you can get your head on straight and then file for divorce and move on with your life.  Good luck.|`|AA11328507	My only answer to cheaters is to dump and or divorce them.  There is nothing to even consider in my book.|`|fqZifENVaa	It's been 2 years since I discovered my husband's infidelity and it still hurts, but not in the same way. What has helped is getting marriage counseling and also educating myself through reading about affairs. Even someone who very much loves their spouse can end up cheating for various reasons---mostly because they and their partner did not discuss how to handle opposite sex encounters and danger situations (like a night out with friends drinking).     Right now it feels like your entire world is crashing down upon your head. The very foundation of how you defined your life and your self has been flipped upside down. Who IS this man you love? Suddenly you don't know. Allow yourself the time you need to feel these feelings. Be good to yourself. It is a very good sign that he feels remorseful, wants to be forgiven, and wants to stay married to you. Those are the best indicators that your marriage will survive.     But do make him go to counseling with you to figure out why he allowed this to happen and how to prevent it in the future. My husband flat out refused to go 3 times and down played his actions---his was an emotional affair with a high school girlfriend from 30 years before, until he realized I was serious about leaving him unless he went with me.     Oh, and help him realize that his so-called friends aren't really good friends. Good friends watch out for each other and keep each other from getting into trouble. They didn't, because they wanted him to slip up and for you to find out. They are not friends of your marriage and should be cut out of both of your lives like the cancer they are.|`|W5wCArLqaa	Sorry to hear that. I think you can get out of marriage within six months, you don't have to file for divorce. But this man is not good for you. Within 5 months of marriage he slept with another woman, I think there is a lot more to happen if you don't get out. Please don't hurt yourself by staying in this relationship. I know it is hard but the longer you stay the harder it is going to get out of relationship.|`|T2iYetpkaa	its not a great start to a marriage really is it!  maybe sleeping in a different room for a little bit.  going back to NY is kind of running away from it and at the end you will still have to cope with it.   if he is genuinely sorry maybe you could have couples therapy and do more things as a couple to try and reconnect.   however there is the old once a cheater always a cheater so if you take him back you will have to learn to trust him again.|`|aLyRNFRTaa	Hey Isabel, so sorry to hear about your situation geez thats horrible.  But I do think it's a very good idea for you to go and sort things out.  I mean your right he should of told you himself but I guess he knew what your reaction would be.  Wow you have only been married 5 months thats a pretty stupid mistake for him to make that early in the marriage maybe he wasn't ready at all to get married I mean either way I think that It's all up to you now don't worry about his feelings at all because whatever his excuses are he certainly wasn't worried about yours was he?  You do whatever you think you need to do for yourself but I can tell you from past experience that unless there is a miracle you will never ever get this horrible time out of your mind completely the trust will never be the same you will always question every move he makes now and rightly so.  So I mean if you think you can live with that stay with him for myself once he cheated I was gone I just couldn't stand looking at him and wondering if he was thinking about her or me...sorry again.....good luck...angel|`|Lsj49nhHaa	Where do you go? To a pub, duh! Get drunk, get grunk and get ****** up! Anything he can do, you can do better, right?|`|0f5d692c2ddaae1a325f6df3f3c8059baa	yes dear you can go back to NY and let him be alone and another woman will warm him up while you are away from him. he never meant to hurt you, if he did he could have told you himself. i wonder what is the motive of the friend for letting it slip, friends are supposed to be the brother and sisters from another mother. Crying wont solve the dilemma you are in but facing up your fears will. talk to him, understand why he did what he did. yell at him, poke him, just let him know how you feel because if you don'tt you will drift apart day after day and when you wake up it will be too late.|`|010e45dc0e6346ff817fa3cf9c7d3649aa	I cant imagine the hell you must be going through, I am so sorry.  I think marriage counselling is needed here to find out what was going on in his head at the time.  I don't think leaving him is the answer because if you want to salvage this marriage you have to do it together, otherwise it will never work.  You are married to this man, you have taken vows, you cant just walk out at the first sign of trouble.  If he is genuinely sorry, go to counselling, decide if you can forgive and move on, and work on it together.  it will be tough as, but you may go on to live a happy and fulfilled life together.  i wish you all the best xxxxxxxxxx.|`|1YXcXNdNaa	Hi Isabel,    I am so sorry for your pain and your loss.  Check out marriagebuilders.com for more great feedback.  Here's my advice:    Find a great counselor (or friend) and talk to about what you need to do to take care of yourself.      For me, personally, I would choose to divorce him because it doesn't sound like there are any children in the relationship yet, and because at 25-years-old, I would still have time to find Mr Right.      Remember:    You don't have to process all your pain all at once.  You can choose to deal with it a little bit at a time.  It is not going to go anywhere, if you want to give yourself a break from it once in a while.      Also, you do deserve to be happy, feel loved, feel cherished, feel appreciated and respected, and have your husband be your best friend.   It is not your fault he made bad choices.  All you can do is try to make good choices for yourself and the kind of person you want to be.     Good luck,    Mrs. W
db67c0941f0845d64edf1a84aa913e6aaa	perhaps you should get yourself together.   Dr. Phil had a family on that had this situation.  I remember she wanted to be with him but couldn't accept that and was scared it would happen again.  He said that the man/spouse has to be willing to answer and be completing open with their spouse.  No secrets.  It will take a long time, but time can heal if you allow it.      If I expected my friends not to gain new friends and leave me out, I'd be friendless.  I've had days, weeks, months where these friends didn't include me on GNO.  Why hold a man any higher than I hold my best friend since the age of 9.  I don't, and I will not.  I am willing to forgive but it needs to be worked on by BOTH sides...   No one is perfect.  He has to learn to steer clear of temptation.  You can both learn to do this together by studying self help books, going on couple retreats.  Those aren't there only for couples in trouble!  Why on earth do we believe men (or women) once they become our spouses will be perfect 365 days a year for the rest of their lives because they married us.   He isn't Jesus.  We all stumble and fall, but it will take more than just effort to walk the straight and narrow.      Go for a while and get your head straight.  Write your feelings for him down.  List your requirements (i.e. open conversations, more togetherness, etc.).  Allow your body and mind to let in forgiveness.      Now if he starts going all crazy... having one every so often then it's time to split.    I have hope for you, and I said a little prayer in your name that you'll find strength.    AND Please do not tell everyone in your life about this incident.  They will think of it when they here his name.|`|vtW3qPZmaa	Get out, get tested for STD's, and make a new life for yourself.  Being able to trust your partner is incredibly important, and very few couples can get over a betrayal like this.  It's not fair on either of you to live under a constant cloud of suspicion, and will you really be able to respect yourself knowing that you're with a man that thinks so little of you he'd have a one-night stand, putting both your relationship and health at risk?|`|UmpJ0UCfaa	the fact that he didnt tell you and you found out behind your back should answer your question. either he felt it was a mistake and he didnt want to hurt you or he is the sneaky cheating kind and is just apologizing cuz you found out and he still wants his wife but chicks on the side. just know if you forgive him it will most likely happen again (unless you're with him 24/7 but that would be exausting). i mean think about it first time offenders in general are about 80% more likely to reoffend. so either you'll have to accept the fact that he loves you but wants other women occasionally or you'll have to let him go and find someone that only loves you and would never throw your trust away. I'm in a similar situation but we have a baby together. i never forgave him because i believe he had a brain to think before he did what he did. i'm trying to forget and move forward but never have. you can't control what you feel and someone betraying you is the ultimate end for ever trusting that person again. i dont ever trust him i am constantly worried but realized if i dont get over that soon it is a waste of time. i went to my parents house to think. yes i suggest you go away and think on your own for a while. dont talk to him just go. you will feel better.|`|lFPsPzxzaa	get out because once a cheater always a cheater|`|63e2aec32e614ade5313fefe8f42b5a2aa	You sound as if it would have made a difference if he had cheated with girls instead of with guys.

What do you want him to do?|`|vvlLXjOdaa	Drop him.  I find that inexcusable.  If you enter into a relationship with the intent to be monogamous, then you'd better be able to take the consequences if you're not.  Drop him, that's so unbelievably disrespectful.    And look at your choice of words. "Make me forgive him."  He shouldn't have to make you forgive him, and you should not give into him on that no matter how persistent he is if you don't have it in you to forgive him.    I know I wouldn't.  Call me cruel if you want, stay with him if you really want, but I'd NEVER want to be in a relationship with someone who'd be willing to have a one night stand of any kind with another woman and expect me to just forgive him, while thinking that he probably didn't love me as much.    No. Just no.|`|D2bI2T0paa	sorry to say hun but i think u should leave him... once a cheater always a cheater... and how would u trust him in the future anyways... and it would ruin ur relationship...so its the right time... leave him now... and don't cry for someone who didn't care about u.... be brave..|`|yTirNVXyaa	Ok take a breath...  This is just my opinion but I would rather my fiance have a one night stand and it just be a drunken night where he was and idiot rather than an affair... there is a difference one is sex the other is emotional. You need to ask him to tell all the dirty details and explain why he didn't tell you. If he made a mistake, realized it, didn't continue talking to the girl, and decided not to tell you he might have been trying to save you what you are feeling now. You both need to talk to a relationship therapist and really work on your marriage. I wouldn't give up just yet on your marriage give it some time, if after talking with a therapist and working with your husband for a few months and don't see things changing than I would consider a divorce or separation.   It is common for men to have a one night stand during an engagement or the early part of a marriage they tend to think about the whole you are the last one they will ever sleep with blah blah blah... It sucks and is an excuse however you need to decide if you can move past it.     sorry you had to deal with this|`|Ub1KbPvDaa	I am so sorry to hear this...  You've only been married five months and he is already being unfaithful.  Maybe he should of gotten that out of his system before taking those vows.  It's difficult to tell you what to do.  But what I can tell you is never allow yourself to love someone more than you love yourself.  If your husband is acting this way and its only five months into the marriage... Do you really think it will be five years or more?  And just wondering... How did his friend "let it slip"?  He could of really been trying to tell you on purpose.... I say you are young and life has too much to offer than for you to be hurting and upset behind some knuckle head that can't keep his pecker in his pants.  I'm not saying stay or go.. But I am asking.. Can you live with this?  Will you be able to get over this?  You will NEVER be able to look at him the same.  Are you willing to lose a lot of you to gain none of him? Marriage is not easy.  It's about compromise, sacrifice and love.  Do you see any of that in this relationship? And if you do and it's all coming from you, you need to reevalutate this and go from there.  YOU know the answer!|`|crxbob5jaa	You know what? Only you can make this decision. And I'm not sure it's wise to make a decision when you've been hurt this deeply and your body is still in shock from it.     You need time to process what happened and be able to think clearly. It will be safe then to make your decision and it will be something that is wise and you will be able to justify your reasons for whatever you decide.     I know one thing. He doesn't deserve a second chance, but that doesn't mean he won't get one. And not all men cheat. Any woman who buys into that lie is destined for heartbreak. It's not acceptable!     Just one suggestion to mention to him:   Would it be alright with him for you to have an affair with another man? If so, then your marriage isn't what you thought it is. If he says no, then he needs to figure out where his priorities are.     But he also is going to have to realize this. IF you choose to forgive and stay with him. He has totally blown all trust that you've had in him. And trust isn't a gift you give to him. Trust is a character trait he's earned. It takes time to build trust. And right now there is none there. Does he understand how much it will take for you to ever trust him again? It needs to be his primary issue right now.     I do wish you the best.|`|ACecbVghaa	In NJ everything is 50/50 split.

The guy cheats on the girl, the girl is the victim, the girl divorces the guy and gets a bloodless money grubbing lawyer to take half of everything the guy owns, even though they've only been married for 5 months.    Interesting how so many people have answered your question with seemingly unbiased advice, I wonder how many of them are married and don't know about their husband's or wive's extra things on the side both past and present.    And by the way, "Julia B", "SirenSong", and "Poppet", you "strong women" are all damaged goods underneath. That's why all you have are your opinions.|`|AA10330186	First of all sit down and discuss the matter with him.  Find out if he loves you enough to get some marriage counseling.  If he won't get counseling then go yourself!  Learn to either forgive the matter and save your marriage or get out of it.  Then the next suggestion I know a lot of people will disagree with is that there shouldn't be guys nights out.  Try couples nights out together.  If he is still trempted then he is just going to be a cheater.  I have never been one for guys or girls nights out!  Cheating is forgivable but never forgotten.  It changes your entire marriage and relationship.  However, people have had it happen and they still survive and sometimes end up loving each other more.  Please though get some counseling for yourself!!|`|qidFLs0Naa	You poor thing.  I truly know how you feel because I've been through all that.  It's hard.    Once you get past the terrible hurt, (and it could take a while) you need to really have some deep discussions with your husband to find out where his head and heart are at.  To flee to NY and think things thru by yourself seems to be a safe thing to do. (you're guarding yourself from further hurt).  But it sounds like HE's the one that needs to "get his head together".    You and he need to talk, talk, talk, talk.  Keeping your hurt inside does no good because it will surface again l promise you.  Men will tend to move on and think it's over and forgotten, but women tend to harbor hurt feeling forever.  I wish you luck sweetie!|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	it's over.  you love him more than he loves you?  that's not a relationship, it's a fixation.  let it go.|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	First off, get yourself tested asap, for STDs and HIV/AIDS. From here, you just have lots of questions to ask yourself, and only you know the answers to this.   It's not like he confessed, he got caught. To me, there's a big difference.|`|f6OOxJQsaa	Once a cheat, always a cheat.  Go back home and file for divorce.  You're still young yet.|`|aOjMf5SPaa	Yep - go to NY, have some time to yourself. Have you ever considered cheating on your partner? NO, because you love him, so why did he cheat on you..... you know the answer.   Go sort out your head, enjoy life, drink with your girlfriends, and experience life without him, hurt, cry, miss, and youll wake up one day with a straight head - and ready to live your own life and find the right man for you.   I'm sorry, but if his mates let it slip, it means they don't disaprove. They've known the whole time, and didnt tell you. He's more likely done it more than this one time. No woman deserves to be cheated on. Once a cheater always a cheater. You're young you still got so much time to get it all right. Go for it, dont look back.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	Once a cheater, always a cheater. You deserve better than what he is offering you.|`|2o3BHgCCaa	You need to think about what you want to do.  Do you want to stay with him even though he cheated on you?  Could you ever forgive him or will you resent him for the rest of your life?  He has hurt you alot and right now I do not think you are in any emotional state to make an informed lifelong decision.  You should kick HIM out for some time by yourself to get your head together and make a decision.|`|w1kvhxX5aa	lol he cheats what do you think you do leave him rofl you stay with someone that cheats then you gonna be made out to be a fool when it happens again and guess what it will|`|VpCtXEMGaa	IF he did it once, he may do it again. Personally, I would go back to New York, and find a place to live. Get some marriage counseling, and go from there.|`|757f10afa027007eb6d9e797f2776feaaa	If it was one mistake 20 years into the marriage, I might tell you to take it slow and consider working it out in therapy.    However, youve only been married 5 months-- you should be the only thing on his mind! Additionally, he did not tell you himself which suggests he was planning to hide it from you. Also, you say you love him more than he loves you and that worries me because the love should be based on mutual respect, and it doesnt sound like it is.    If I were you, I would go away and do some thinking. Also consider seeing a therapist, it will give you someone to talk to so you can gain some perspective on the situation.|`|01b990b6feebbb819d33fb976c859438aa	STOP DONT DO ANYTHING , dont jump and get a divorce but take some time to truely figure out what you want. Dont cheat on him, go to NY and think about things. You cheating will just compile the heart.     you can make it work if he is willing to try and you are willing to try and mutually work on things|`|TAufQoc7aa	What a complete ********. I dont think I would ever find it in me to forgive and trust my fiance if he ever did that. I mean I love him he is my world but that is just the ultimate betrayal. He has no excuse..    Sorry for what you are going through..  x
8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	Maybe she thinks you're stalking her.  Might as well go up and talk to her and see if she wants to go out for coffee again.  You have to get this out of your system.  lol    And this is Marriage/Divorce, if you care.    Opposites do seem to attract (especially when you're young and dumb) but similars make for better life-time partners.|`|ltUzwXZEaa	There is nothing wrong with being polite say hello you guys were not mad at each other the last time that you spoke so there is no harm in saying hello then by all means keep it moving.|`|0IhCFeXLaa	opposites attract|`|UONwTWIQaa	yes, the president of russia uses "wtf!" LOL|`|dzbblpjgaa	We can all admire people from a far. Treat her like any other friend unless she actually wants to see you again. You could always ask. I think you are in your early 20s mentally if not physically. Get some other interests to take your mind off her for a while. You are a bit obsessive about her and will either have do be more direct or stay away - no middle ground - sorry :) If you are too persistent she may accuse you of stalking.|`|0nW8wMBdaa	Probably just a sexual thrill, a one nighter sort of thing.|`|DiSwWfc4aa	Unless you want to think about that girl until  the day you die.. I suggest you do. You don't want to be one of those people who always wonder.    You don't have to have anything in common.. Down the road in the relationship you will do new things. Those things will become the things you have in common.|`|GYkOoQwAaa	I think that these signs means she is the best woman 4 u :b|`|Lsj49nhHaa	She don't love you like I do! Haha! :P

If you dont love him you ought to have forgotten about him.|`|BqgXCxwVaa	hm mm, only time will make you forget him. Just try to get you busy in life, school,work,dating with other boys and going out with friends|`|85da46ed027af96aa8233e30bac20ba9aa	It will be hard, and even harder if you was the one who was dumped (you haven't told us that).  But the best way is to go out to new places. Do new things and meet new people. Talking to others can help, but don't dwell on the past or your ex. Find a new hobby or interest. If you used to go to a particular place then find a new place to go to. Have fun (and not in a stupid way) and a laugh. Try a comedy club (if they still exist). The more you have fun the less you will be thinking of him and the easier it will become.|`|71LeWL4waa	well one way you can hang around your friends and go to the mall or somthing and try to have just some girl time...|`|ka5O1iFQaa	You just gotta stop thinking about him and stop reminding yourself of him.    Keep your schedule busy by constantly doing other things that make you happy.|`|UeCgFgucaa	ignore him

However, when you first meet some one your intrest is based soley on apearence,then you talk to them and make your desision,it's human nature. basicly it's 50/50  apearence/personality   unfortunitely looks are what a girl sees first, but if she's not a total snob she wont care.|`|AA10423276	for gals, body matters more than cute face. i think you shud work out. a little muscle will do the trick.|`|wE2etBzbaa	So if a cute woman face were on a goat body, would you date her? does it matter for you?    so I think the answer is similar.    this answer comes from a guy with no perfect body, but not a goat body.|`|OE8r1VtRaa	i dont really go for looks, but i like the rough rugged kind of thing, i dont like guys that arereally fat, skinny i can deal with, as im only small.|`|lgNcsY8Aaa	he cant have man boobbs or have the michellin tyre around his beli
OE8r1VtRaa	you have to really turn each other on, foreplay is a big part, you have to really get each other going and then the sex is more passionate and you'll more than likely orgasm, may take a while but dont try too hard, maybe the stress of the situation puts more pressure and its harder to let yourself go when you fear letting someone down.|`|AA10423276	its very normal that you can't orgasm, most gals can't orgasm through sex coz female orgasm takes time to build up and you have to be extremely relaxed and very turned on to have an orgasm but its very very strange and abnormal that your boyfriend doesn't have orgasm. could it be that he's also having performance anxiety? try getting drunk together and then have sex. if he still can't have an orgasm, he will have to go to a doctor soon. as for you, try with a vibrator or just masturbate, if you *** it means you have no issues.|`|0bgsTaSIaa	Stop Drinking and taking drugs. Try vitamin e supplements..|`|T4gQCSzeaa	relax geez..y'all are trying too hard|`|71LeWL4waa	maybe you two just dont truly love each other....or you just have to do more kinky stuff.. the to answer your last qeustion no i dont think so..|`|jYLZYxDvaa	Your arm aches LOL, try talking dirty to each other or something, maybe some role play, break out the hand cuffs..|`|AmZiGXSRaa	Maybe there needs to be more... energy between you. You know, not just going through the motions. You could try talking dirty (unless that makes you uncomfortable) and making the occasion special with candles, lingerie, music, etc.    Good luck.|`|Qyue0Ykgaa	Out of amo... System overload. Your too young for it.|`|J0288uiFaa	You guys need to relax, if your thinking about to much then you wont do it. Just concentrate on each other, start with a lot of foreplay and go from there.  You need to explore your own body so you know what you like and vice versa and talk to each other so you both know.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Sex, like anything else worth doing, takes practice.|`|5FVyVS9vaa	You guys need more foreplay.|`|nrnVqh7iaa	Medication can cause this.  Is he on antidepressants?|`|w1kvhxX5aa	cause ya ain't working it|`|BquqToGaaa	Did you not try the buttocks? Works every time.....|`|YIlP4yNaaa	use both hands... one to massage his testicles and the other to stroke his penis... use some oil or lotion on his penis... all this should make it easier for him to ***|`|cO6BD3hVaa	i sure hope you're not sitting there like a quiet duck.  Get into it, ask him what some fantasies are, then do them!   Get down one night and toss him on the bed and blow him, then sit on it.  Good Luck!  Remember don't make sex too much of an issue.  The more worked up you get about it and nervous, the less enjoyable it is.|`|FP4Ati8uaa	maybe he's not really into sex. If he's horny then it shouldn't be a problem getting him to orgasm.|`|rcRoF7WNaa	No, that's not possible.  A lot of girls don't orgasm through intercourse.  Some can only orgasm when involving the clitoris, so you may be one of them.    The problem is him.  I've never heard of a guy who can't orgasm from sex unless there's an underlying problem either physical or mental.    It's not you, it's him.|`|AA12290150	Just give it more time. You are both nervous. Analysing it will probably make it worse. Maybe drink a little wine and watch a sexy movie together before will oil the wheels. I'm sure once it happens, it will continue to happen.|`|0GDgg2zsaa	just wait. K? K.
143bm6cnaa	You are now approximately 26 years old?  And, you have been having sex your uncle for 13 years?  And, now you decide you do not want to do it with him any longer?  Are you sure???    My advice is to tell the following people what has been going on between you and him; (1) his wife, (2) his children, (3) your parents, (4) your bothers and sisters, (5) his brothers and sisters, (6) his employer, (7) the police.    Then tell him, "No more."|`|sowS7KW2aa	he is married already , he used u and ruin your future  , if he is not married and he said he loves u its ok for me not for all but sweet , u will think what if every1 knows , and found out ,... then every1 will hate u , go and found your own|`|7e8NN8saaa	Darling - what your uncle has been doing is not merely illegal - but immoral.     It changes in some places but most states agree that you are you are not old enough to be a consenting adult before the age of 16 or 17. What your uncle did is considered statutory rape and because he is your uncle it is also incest.     In addition, he is a married man - swore an oath to his wife to "cleave only to her." This means - have no sex with anyone else.     This is an entirely dishonorable man.     You are old enough to move away. Get as far away from him as you can.
nX1QW5GCaa	You already know the answer to your question.  You don't owe him anything.  Never mind the fact that he's a jerk.  Your relationship is over.  PERIOD.  End of story.  You've moved on.  It's time he did too.  Sounds like he's calling anyone he thinks he can convince to give him money.  I bet he called a few others too and you were just one of the people on the list.  I bet as soon as he finds out he can't get money from you, you won't hear from him again until he needs something else.|`|cUfOnldzaa	Just tell him that after looking at your finances, you just can't afford it.  He sounds like a user, so if you lend him money, you won't get it back.|`|AWb0L9IKaa	He is just using you, don't lend him any money you hope to get back.|`|JOQJwcR6aa	Give him as much as you are able to give away. Even though he says he'll give it back have you set to where you don't have to worry weather he gives it back or not or you could just give him half of what he's asking for and say that's all you have. i don't believe in turning your back on him you really need to be the bigger person here... say if it were you and you need some help and the last person you had and could turn was him wouldn't you only hope that he'd help you out.. I say put your foot down and tell him you really need the money back for your baby if that's the case... Just remember no good deed is ever over looked you'll just be building your karma.. good luck|`|tPRRUs4Jaa	what a manipulative jerk--don't give him any of your hard-earned dollars. yes, the guy who crashed his car should pay for it. not you!  don't give in!!|`|hAa4LjFHaa	You are not over this guy who are you kidding it after reading what you wrote it seems like you are sweating him.  He is over you though, and only wants to use you to get money for himself.      You need to just stop calling this guy and get over it and find somebody else to obsess over that will not use you for your money.|`|appjNRs1aa	I wouldn't share a video game account with my ex-husband, if he asked for money, I'd laugh him off the phone.    Personally, I think that your assertion that you're over him is shaky at best, and the further you can stay away from him (even regarding lending money) the better.|`|DZzBfzVeaa	You say you are over him but you are obviously NOT over him. If  you were then you wouldnt care if he called on your bday or not. And if he was fully over you he wouldnt be calling you babe or saying "happy bday MY LOVE". How do you think his new girl would feel if he found out he was talkin to you like that? I know its hard to get over someone, trust me ive been there done that! First of all i would  NOT lend him any money at all! I dont lend people money for any reason becuase i know i will NEVER get it back. I know you just trying to be nice and you have a big heart but its time for you to stand up for yourself.  you said that after all these years of him knowing you he still treats you like you are weak, you should stand up for yourself and tell him NO so he doesnt think your weak. To drive a car you have to have insurance and when someone is driving your car and wrecks it they are liable for the damages, so insurance should pay for the damages he should have to pay for anything. Unless he is driving illegally with out insurance. Plus if you let him borrow money thats just one more tie you have to him, your gunna have to follow up and try to get your money back and you should really just break all ties with him and not talk to him so you can try to get over him. Good luck.|`|SsfnitjXaa	DO NOT LOAN HIM ANY MONEY.  Where is it your responsibility to bail out his friend (who might very well be the new girl he is banging).  He should not be connecting with you and wishing you Happy anything and you should not be expecting him too.      Move on, you don't need this kind of person in your life. (I am assuming you do not have any kids with him).|`|NuUdCz0Laa	Your responsibility ended when the divorce was filed.  Big heart or not, he is taking advantage of you by being nice when he needs something.  Tell him no money and watch how quickly he changes into a mean SOB.  Your responsibility is to yourself and no one else.  Stop being a pushover and tell him to get a second job if he needs money.  Good luck.|`|m81dfyOYaa	I think you'd be a sucker to send him money to help a friend. He's your ex and has another family. Cut him off, ex's don't care about birthdays or any other holdays involving an ex wife. Unless you want to appear on Judge Judy to try to get your money back don't do it.|`|tvuhGTD9aa	If you're willing to do this, two things:    1. Offer to pay the repair bill directly. You're not underwriting his Super Bowl wagers.    2. Don't expect to get the money back. Nice if you do, but don't expect it. You'll give yourself peace of mind this way (don't tell him you don't expect to be repaid).|`|K6vEbdqxaa	I agree with INTERNET HATE MACHINE!  If you were to mail this dude money, you probably would never see it again.  He doesn't care about you obviousely.  He just wants to use you for his own personal gain.|`|FzFSzilmaa	don't lend ANY money.... you won't get it back EVER...|`|EIcj9KhCaa	It's ok to lend a helping hand every once in a while but in this instance I would tell you no.  He knows he can come to you for help and you give it to him. If his friend crashed his ride then his friend should be paying for it not you.  Tell him sweetly this is not a good time for you to do this and that you hope he resolves his problem.
MUDDyIKtaa	Well I was married once before, and my husband then had the same issue, the same time of the year he got really cranky , UGH he was down right nasty. It turned out later after we were divorced that his parents had a very rough divorce the same time many years before that. We did manage to get one or two counseling sessions in before we divorced, but I actually found out through my brother who married my ex's sister. HE had the same problem, they are divorced to now. I don't know if this will help, but you need to find out if something major happened in his life at that time of the year that would impact him this way. Wishing you the best.|`|oRzqWhsDaa	suggest couples counseling he is not opening up to what is really bothering him and without him telling you whats wrong you two are going to go your separate ways|`|ooT1Gj2Xaa	Maybe he has that seasonal affective disorder.|`|AA11809359	i'm wondering if there wasn't something that happened a long time ago around this time of year that he hasn't told  you about that bothers him and his only way to deal with it is to get mad.... you know?

k0mfmJpSaa	when a guy says that he has "luv 4 me"....it cant be true....  Like you said...you couldnt say it back becuase it was too quick to say...I guess he doenst know how powerful that word really is and he uses it like any other word. Be warn, Dont trust it till you feel certain he means it...  Since he likes having conversations with his Homeboy, then ask him if he asked you to go out or his friend.....Tell him thats a childish thing and if he cant understand that then He isnt worth it.|`|65AEYuSHaa	Invite him over for a coffee or something to your fave joint, or if possible, a drink to make him comfortable and ease out, for what you know, he probably just gets nervous around u.. and definitely, don't need to try too hard, Girly is good... Get him a ticket to a movie or a game, and since you would get only 2 tickets he wouldnt have an option to ask his friend to tag along...|`|tXlvg1ahaa	Take some English lessons if he is English, and when you can use the language more easily try to send him a texted message to say that he is missing out on so much of you when he brings his friends along on a date with you...|`|Qyue0Ykgaa	Invite him to your place, or a public place, then tell him lets go ice skating.

XQREZMZ6aa	i reckon its cause loving (or 'liking') someone can be such a deep feeling and as soon as you admit it you feel like the the other person sees you differently, or sees you too well. you feel kind of exposed. and also cause the other person then knows how much you'll get hurt if they reject you|`|17FKGiJbaa	an answer that would make it clear that u don't matter|`|RoEyFm5yaa	BEING REJECTED.|`|M64Od7VOaa	Getting cake thrown in my face.

S4jm4j98aa	you sound like a nerd.
VTR2kqcQaa	LoL. Love the "nerd" confession. We're all nerds...somewhere...deep...deep...down! Anyways, my advice for fashion would be to wear things that make your body type look good. Don't be so concerned about brands or fashion trends. A great looking guy can look really retarded in something that just doesn't fit his body type. If you're kind of a big guy, I'd stay away from American Eagle/etc because it tends to make bigger guys look like little babies in tight t-shirts.     Personally, I love a guy in jeans and a white or dark t-shirt. You could also try a more rugged look, since you've been sticking with the white-boy Abercrombie-ish stuff. Diesel is a hot brand. Simple, but SEXY. My advice would be to find colors that fit your skin tone, or your personality and THEN look for clothes that are in those colors. Also, it wouldn't hurt to start your own trend! Don't be afraid to try out some new looks on your own...you never know what might catch on.|`|qy07K2k5aa	Try and wear army-style clothes.|`|oUcLSDZ6aa	Buy what you like, not whatever some name brand store is selling.    Personality trumps trend every time.|`|71LeWL4waa	nope sorry|`|XQREZMZ6aa	in my mind the guys i always see as the most confident are the guys who wear clothes that look good on them, but they can be whatever brand and the guy doesn't care - thats what makes him confident
a495b03d41f960c1a8471bd603c42ab6aa	Our friends sent us a Christmas card made by Vista Print.  It was printed on a lighter weight card stock and had amazingly detailed caricatures of their faces on the card.  Very unique!    Can you order a sample?  Unfortunately, I do not see it listed on their site where you can check out the weight of the paper.|`|JXw0U77aaa	I haven't used them myself, but in an online wedding community I'm in, several ladies have posted that they've been impressed with the quality of invitation they've gotten from them.    You could also order just one as a sample, and see what you think of the quality.
4su2AwvCaa	So you two broke up?    Then you let him back into your life again  It sounds like he is doing all these things to you because he knows he can.  Because he knows that you still need him  Like .. after breaking up.. 3 months later you still want him and I think he is just abusing that  To be honest it doesn't sound like he is that interested in being with you and is with you more for the fact of being in a relationship rather than particulary feeling..or wanting to be    Do you know what he did while you two were broken up?  Because if you dont i think you should find out  Ask him.    If he really loved you he wouldn't have done anything with any other girls.. but to be honest it sounds like he did    I'm not saying he didn't love you in the past    But i think his feelings have changed since then.. since you two split up    If you split up with him he might just feel resentment towards you and know hes hurting you by doing all this  If he split up with you and then got back with you he knows he can have and drop you at anytime he wants - thats what hes abusing.. knowing that you may get pissed off.. split up with him.. then want him back again and you will be caught in a continuous cycle    If you really want to try and make it work.. tell him.  Tell him that it really hurts you when you see and hear him acting like this and that you feel if he cared for you he would be abit more considerate of your feelings. And if he is not willing to do this for you then its over.    And stick to that.    There is no way of him knowing how you feel unless you tell him  and its better he hears it from you rather than a 3rd party because it will only complicate matters more    He may be significant in your life and shared and been through alot with you, but even though you think your world would end without him, you may be suprised at how well you cope.. knowing how badly he began to treat you and how he might just not be the same person you fell in love with    good luck|`|BqgXCxwVaa	Well that's a hard situation. The way this scene is turning is bad for you. Definitely you should get out of this relationship. Whether you are in love with him or like him so much, you should think twice that the way he is acting, he can't love you.|`|RriL4AQ2aa	tell him your problems with every things you've listed if he makes an honest effort to stop doing these things stay with him hes a good guy if he doesn't leave his *** as fast as you can he isn't worth it!|`|DY5bukfsaa	i would say leave him.   it will be hard for a bit but he dosen't deserve you if he treats you like this.  i really sorry about it hun.  * loves *   xxxx|`|VTR2kqcQaa	It's pretty obvious that he's not that into you. He obviously has other girls on the side that he's having sex with or fooling around with. He probably enjoys having you sit around and wait for him while he visits these other girls' houses. Don't be one of "those" girls who lets a guy walk all over her. Read what everyone has been telling you....better yet, listen to your heart. You KNOW that he isn't good for you. You're smarter than that. Get rid of him and find someone better.    P.S. Once you break things off, he'll probably call a lot and ask for you back. This does NOT mean he actually cares for you. It just means he's sad that he's lost one of his groupies. Move on and keep your chin up! Remind yourself that you deserve better.|`|X7rPWJU8aa	dump him and move on|`|y1lr564raa	I think it would be better for you to leave him|`|RSbn5STjaa	Get out.|`|HzV1LeIvaa	Hes cheating on you, i agree with the first answer.  You need to get out of there before it hurts you to a worse extent.|`|hEcKmleVaa	I am not a teenager anymore, but I think I have insight to your heartache.  You gave this guy your most precious gift:  your heart and soul.  He was your first love.  I am forever trying to protect my own daughter from the gut-wrenching experience of giving everything to a guy only to have him "act differently" or just move on after they have been through so much together.  I don't know if you have talked to your bf about how much it hurts when he goes to other girl's homes and flirts with them and professes "love."  I am sure it cuts you to the core.  Your bf probably has a whole different perspective than you do.  He obviously doesn't want to be exclusive--his actions say otherwise.  Even if he's not actually having sex with any other girls, he is betraying you with his words and actions.  This relationship probably should not have started up again after the first break-up.  Teen relationships are generally temporary, as they should be.  The best thing you can do is stand up for yourself.  If he wants to keep you as his exclusive gf, he needs to cut out the crap.
vKvSgkhHaa	All states are different.  I know that in Minnesota you have to take a full year of English every year.  And that there are minimum amounts of history and math.  The best thing to do is ask, preferably a councilor however if you have a favorite teacher they would be more then willing to help you understand.  Ask.
dZxjXHA2aa	You could make him a giant card; really large with pasted pics of either you guys or cutesy pics and write a little poem with a line by each pic    Do you have dollar stores?  They actually put out some decent stuffed animals and picture frames you could put a pic of you in the frame and have the teddy bear holding it    If you act quick you could probably find a cheap chain w/ cross from EBay or on Craigslist.com|`|7h5wxsL7aa	Pawnbrokers for chain.|`|oSmFTHQ5aa	i dont think he is accepting gift frm you  ithink he wants you tell him how much you like him|`|8zZlv8hzaa	if cant give him the present you think he would like why not give him like a baked cake or a card something that would make him love you more.. it's the thought that counts though..|`|aIS1asOjaa	lucky you to have a bf!  make little pretend vouchers like 'this voucher entititles you to one kiss' and so on :)    its a very sweet idea :D     x

In order for you to even work out, you have to be friends on some level. My fiance is my best friend. We understand each other and we know how to comfort each other whenever either of us need it. We were friends for almost two years before we started to date and that made the relationship sooo much better. So, I think friendship is important because no matter what that person can be the one person that you can always go to no matter what. Hope this helps!
TShsb3EXaa	Making friends is something in my opinion which must be done by oneself socially in person.  Giving your own 'Yahoo! Messenger' or 'MSN' address to people you do not know could put your own safety at risk no matter what your age.  I hope you make friends.    Best of luck, Q&A.|`|qeYdErVtaa	U sound so dogdy soz like, but get ur own friends
QAwwmDuDaa	I can tell you what to do but only you know the answer to this,your social circle has to change,you must find new interests and new friends.These neanderthals are dragging their knuckles on the ground and you want to be more intellectual.Take time out from them and concentrate on your up coming exams,your father,Matthew.|`|07e1041f41de92a29534cc87d6f3c8d8aa	Nope, they don't sound much like friends at all.  Ditch and find others.|`|DUgo8Edjaa	i'd suggest not being friends with them... they don't sound like the best friends... or maybe just see them less for a while something like that... go out with other friends who aren't like that :)    good luck.

Is he your first?    Yes, I would defo say he likes you.|`|CeyJaFs6aa	u also need a guys point of view seeing they'd no how boys react when they like girls.    and the way u describe it sounds like he does either that or hes really comfortable with u and likes u as a friend only.    u cant really know unless u ask|`|cuvBHGyraa	Awww...that's so cute...of course he likes ya Honey...those are the first signs that a boy likes you...Good Luck!|`|tXlvg1ahaa	Ho yes.........

I would ask one of his friends if he has told them that he likes you and just wait to see if he asks you out.  And if it takes a long time you could always give him a few signs that you like him.
TShsb3EXaa	Considerate means being respectful of others.     Other words for 'Considerate' are as follows:    Accommodating   Amiable   Attentive   Benevolent   Charitable   Chivalrous   Circumspect   Compassionate   Complaisant   Concerned   Discreet   Forbearing   Generous,   Magnanimous  Mellow Mindful   Obliging   Polite   Solicitous   Sympathetic   Tactful   Tender   Thoughtful  Unselfish   Warmhearted      Words meaning opposite of 'Considerate' are as follows:    Disrespectful  Impatient   Inattentive   Inconsiderate   Mean   Scornful   Selfish   Thoughtless   Unfeeling   Unmindful      I suppose it is a good thing being considerate to others but only to an extent. Too considerate could make you seem like a bit of a push over and people may take advantage of you.|`|4b5dd20b671818419f41cccb282c242caa	i often ask friends if i am over the top being considerate. i think it's kinda a 'what will he/she think/feel'. if youre think about this and they are good friends then you would become quite considerate. you also need to have them on your mind constantly, which is pretty easy with a good close friend

Just get out on different parties and you'll find one. Believe me.
dZxjXHA2aa	Don't worry about justifying yourself to the people on here :)  Guys can just be so nerve-wracking!  I would wait until he gets up, give him a cold drink and then tell him calmly that you understand how hot it is and that is why you need him to drive you to the grocery store.  Tell him (again CALMLY) that you understand he's at work all day but you're home all day wishing you could get your groceries bought and meals made because that is what YOU are responsible for.  If he's going to be too tired after work can you agree on a time and a day when it works for him so that you aren't feeling like you and your errands don't matter to him.  What if he comes home, takes a cool shower, changes his clothes, but then has to drive you to the store? Something like that kind of compromise.|`|1a8PBGguaa	He must be tired all day in the office and the hot weather isnt helping|`|RvShEWESaa	Learn to make cohesive sentences!!

KPXwwwMMaa	i would NOT suggest to your boyfriend that he is cheating on you. This will upset him, even if he is not cheating... seriously, who likes to be accused?    Helping your man set up the girl with one of his friends is definitely an option. But instead of getting jealous, or upset that your man doesn't understand your feelings on the matter, why don't you ask him what HIS feelings are on the matter? Why does he want to help her? Has he had a friend or relative in the past that he's had to rescue from a bad situation?    Try to appreciate your man for having a big heart for helping people. And as long as your man isn't hanging out with this girl and smoking weed all the time, be supportive.     Try to get to know this girl closely and personally. Sympathize with her. The more you get to know her, the more that 'vibe' will disappear. And if you know the girl really well, you'll know her well enough to know if she's been cheating with your man.|`|rcRoF7WNaa	Find a nice guy to set her up with.  Keep her busy!  And if that fails, try talking to your guy and see his reaction when you hint at something going on.
JI7NQ9TNaa	That depends.    The old fashioned annulment made the children illegitimate in the eyes of the church. Essentially an annulment means the marriage never existed, so the kids were essentially made outside of wedlock.(Anyone who disagrees should ask a priest about this.)    If you are not Catholic yourself, or are not devout, then I am guessing this won't bother you. But some people go for the legal divorce, and not the religious one on those grounds.    One is legal (divorce) and the other religious.The annulment will not change any aspect of the legal divorce.|`|AA11328507	Its a Catholic thingy.  The decree still stands|`|3ee8101ef611dcb2fe20c82dfe728d6caa	Nothing changes with the decree. It will still stand.    Needed to reply:  the annulment will make the children illegitimate in the eyes of the church, but not the eyes of the law or the parents.
xGshAiXOaa	I can't make out what your full question is, so I will just go from the headline.  If your family loves you, whether they like your husband or not, they will respect your decision and not force you to choose.  If your husband loves you, he should realize that your family is a big part of who you are, and that can never be changed.  Therefore, he will respect that, and also not force you to choose.    Either tell him/them that you will not choose between the two, or make your choice.  If I were put in the situation, I would probably choose the one that wasn't forcing me to make the decision.|`|417a83c7cb091ac86d2ec601c9b825e2aa	You should not have to choose between the 2,. you love them both and if they can't get along, its their fault , not yours.|`|veZLfnGFaa	Why should you have to chose between the two?  I'm sorry, but I don't understand your question.|`|1BGwGFQZaa	You Committed to a Man for life and now you are asking if the family comes first. There comes a time when you have to make mature decisions. This is not  a Good Question. You Committed to your husband for LIFE that is the answer.|`|oRzqWhsDaa	there is more to this story so tell us more and thats not the right spelling of the word|`|BhXOLas1aa	choose both. Ask your husband to respect your family as they are who made you and took care of you until you were ready to marry.  If your husband has no respect for your family, does he really love you?  Do you love him?   If you love him then you need to talk to him, if you don't love him then walk away and go back to your family.|`|jROpVbrhaa	I know how you feel now coz you love your husband and also your family,So dont choose if you can patch up their differences much better.and it will take time for that.Just pray fr them both parties.I know someday they will realized that . So keep bridging them, so that your family will be as one.God bless.|`|AA11481207	what's vargua?|`|8bplNvAQaa	Tell him to sort himself out and realise you will choose him over them, but if he really loved you and cared he would let you have both.    I'd give up may family for my wife.  but she'd love me enough not to force me to do that over something that really doesn't matter.    You need a family, and you need him to be a part of it.  Tell him to get over himself because you love your Mum.    If he's serious he sounds very unreasonable.|`|YBISOapbaa	family always COME first

There are very few "rich" men in this world that don't work their tail off for the wealth they have.  Working takes up almost all their time.  Contrary to what you see on TV, "rich men" don't have a whole lot of free time in their lives.  You will be quick to see that "wealthy men" are often married and divorced several times through their life.  There isn't any room in their life to settle down and fall in love.  Because of this relationships are based on convinece.... and often, money is the only piece of the relationship that keeps it together.    To answer your question... most rich men don't care if they are in a superficial relationship because that is the only type of relationship they have time for.  If money is what keeps a woman around to deal with the type of relationship they are in, then so be it.|`|92f1395ac162c7f39c8c0b5d4f04c596aa	nope|`|YCKnnbsraa	If I was 60 years old, I certainly would marry a 20 year old despite her just wanting my money.|`|LuIsLQH2aa	Not if she wasn't nice to other people other than me.|`|TVHhBMWnaa	really id use her for what i need then id give her the can i know what its like to be used and it sucks|`|K0XuYMEIaa	lol depends..... hehe|`|6ZfbuWaIaa	yes i will.at least from the start i know she is just after my money rather i being made to belive that she is in love with me but the truth is she is just after my money.besides thats part of the relationship,if i could help her,why not.there are so many ways to take care of my money much more that i know that she is just after my money.there could be a pre nuptial agreement for both of us.who knows,i could even change her attitude towards life.|`|UVUYG5jaaa	a prince dates a princess, a prince doesn't date peasants|`|hoBREUGLaa	No. I would act like I was poor until i found someone that wasn't after me for the money that I had, but the way that I acted when I was around them and appreciated me for that instead of the things I can buy.|`|qy07K2k5aa	I would make sure that she is after my money.

However not all at once. You can gradually do things that are a little outside your comfort zone until you get used to it and it's no big deal anymore. For example just try and chat a little to people in stores for starters. Then move up a notch to something a little more challenging and conquer that level.|`|BqIyO3x3aa	go to like a self help class or just find people who you dont have to be shy towards thats what i did|`|aLb3Ar85aa	well there's nothing really that can stop you being shy   but some things can help    if you just be happy with yourself,  and just go for whatever you're worried or shy about doing    you only have one life so why hesitate?

uho96JIZaa	You can not protect her from getting hurt. The more you try to cling, the more it will push her away. You should probably move on. Life is harsh and so is high school.|`|BfmV2KpUaa	The beginning of the end already started when you had your break. You need to know where you stand however, so ask her. If it's bad news for you, you may still remain friends, but as the above poster so rightly said, you can't prevent her from being hurt. She has to be allowed to make her own decisions and learn from them too. You have to be mature enough to handle that. It's all part of growing up I'm afraid.  Many years ago I had a break-up with a girlfriend and after a few months we got back together again, but it didn't last. All we did was put ourselves through the same hurt all over again. It really is best to just move on when things aren't working out.|`|eooUzAfzaa	Everyone has to have a break sometimes.  Give her some time.  If it's meant to be, it will be.    But I can tell you that people need to grow and change.  Sometimes a break is for the better, and when she matures a bit more, I think you guys can make it work.  Just stay in her life, but don't be too needy.  It will turn her away.      Let her know you're still there for her if anything happens.
GeruGGOQaa	As a man I don't think your kids need to know your sexual history.  Too many parents are trying to be their kids friend instead of their parent.  If you think you need to share your sexual exploits with your kids, why stop there?  Why not share with them what sexual positions you enjoy while your at it?  Your job as a parent is to help to inform them of the risks that go along with having sex and the right ways to protect themselves and that's about it.|`|c2f7ef4507c724db34ebbcc925ef59e1aa	I wouldn't tell them! Unless they were old enough to handle the answer and to keep their mouths shut. I'd probably give them an answer like "Haha, well you know I've had at least one and that's your daddy!"|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	I would ask why they wanted to know, my son is an adult and would in no way intrude into my private life but I would be more inclined to tell him than my daughter who is only 11.|`|03ec65bf77c70de35e61bf195676e487aa	Yes.  I told them one, their father, and that's the truth.|`|fe9b89ef9075d826f6d2b372470173b0aa	I really believe that some things should never be talked about and that is one of them. First I think I would ask why that kind of information would mean anything to them. I think the only possible use they could have for that information is to use it against you when they decide it is ok for them to have sexual partners.    The person you were before you were married is probably not the person you are now. I really do not think it would be wise to give your children that type of information.|`|EENUWAP7aa	I was asked that before from a girl and my reponse was I have loved them all since I was five and I still love them at my age now.|`|e8f304081fca5eabe282a819a91143f3aa	I would tell them that the facts about my past certainly don't dictate what their future should be.  I would tell them that I perhaps had a few of lovers that I regret, especially when I was young and couldn't make grown up decisions.  That I learned later in life that if a Boy/Man trys to pressure you into sex before you feel the relationship was stable, and commitments were made, then Don't Rush In To It - Make Him show you that HE is worthy of you.   That if you don't, you will see it as a bad mistake once the dude dumps you after he gets what he wants.    You will know when it's right - and you can come to me first, and we can talk about it, so that you can make sure she is prepared.    Be the parent, but also listen, and remember how you felt when you were her age, and just speak from  your heart... and yes, you can change the numbers is you want to, or i Promise you they will hold it against you some day,|`|0d0W0nbVaa	as a man, if my kids asked me that, i'd say "i had one partner too many, I should have stopped just before I met your mother".    lol.|`|3y96DmJdaa	ye i would lie and say one, your father. Might make them think twice|`|veZLfnGFaa	My son and I can talk about anything, but we've never talked about that. I feel like that was before he was born and had nothing to do with him.  Besides, would you want to know how many sexual partners your son or daughter has had?  :)|`|AA11706291	No I wouldn't tell them, they just don't need to know.|`|BhXOLas1aa	Grief, I never counted them, they weren't sheep !!  Do I count the one who raped me when I was 5? hmm not that easy is it?|`|ma6Re8B1aa	NO>>> That is personal and adult information my children don't need to know about??And I wouldn't have to let them in on that info to help them out with their problems???? These people are not your friends!!!!! They are your children!!!!|`|IfwpibHqaa	no no no|`|9HDd2OCGaa	no its just wrong|`|5e260042c3dea6bca47d97a351125157aa	I'd tell them the same as I'd tell anyone else who asked that question..."None of your business."|`|RdHeKBUMaa	My parents never had sex. Just twice to make me and my brother and both times was due to banana peel slippage.      La la la la la - I can't hear you!|`|MWjNp6y3aa	I am a man but if my future offspring asked me I would tell them. It is good to instill a sense of reality in them. They are looking for good information about the real world from someone they are supposed to trust. If they have enough guts to ask I would tell them. It will help them trust you for future questions that may help them greatly throughout life. If a kid somehow thinks that you are perfect and never had relations before you are married it puts a unrealistic view in their head that may make them think they will be broken or something if they do differently. In life you need experiences and if you can't have them because of your mental picture of life is off then it is going to be rough. That happened to me and I am glad bad things happened to me to make me realize that certain things need looked at more rigorously.|`|0nW8wMBdaa	I guess it depends on how open minded they are but maybe not say the actual number if more than five.|`|Q2MLikeUaa	Yes of course, but then I have only had one, never needed anyone else, can't answer for my husband though because in this life you never know if anyone is telling you the truth you can only hope they are.|`|8bplNvAQaa	If they are at the age of sexual activity then yes.  Be honest.  They will end up a being a small version of you, albeit a different version, so you shouldn't worry about answering a question.  Would you rather they asked their friend how many is normal and their friend gave them the wrong impression and messed them up?      This is probably where their principles and expectations of life are forming.    Maybe say, "at your age I had XX".  I don't know, but remember they will be adults one day and want you to be a source of answers for the things they think matter.    Do not lie, so speak to them and tell them the truth and then where you went wrong (if at all).    It's good they look up to you and respect you like that.    It's your call but be wise and remember that your action will have consequences.    :)|`|Q0SIuZWjaa	i think it depends on why they want to know, u should ask. if its just general nosiness, then dont tell them. if its perhaps because theyre worried about sex before marraige or how many partners is too much maybe you should tell them. if your ashamed of your number then increase/decrease it.|`|AMMiU5usaa	I think you should tell them. If you have a good relationship with them they can guess if you're lying. However, I'd keep the number low even if it isn't (that's my catholic guilt shining through). Parents should always be an example.    by kids I take it, you mean teenagers?|`|52b0f62af53dd437245aea3bc2df6601aa	My "number" is my and my husband's business only.  Its not that I'm ashamed its just that it is none of their business.  If they would like to learn from the knowledge I gained from my past sexual experiences (married and/or unmarried) that is fine but my "number" is irrelevant.|`|qaP03QImaa	ewww too much information ....I would never want to know as a child and now that I have my own kids don't see the point of discussing something like that!|`|QIwhMrBraa	first, ewwww! my son is only 5 and just the thought, crikey i dont know wot i would do, probably lie, ha. it really depends how old your son or daughter is. of course id admit to having sex with other men before i was married, to me that is nothing to be ashamed of im gonna encourage my son when hes old enough to have loads of fun before he commits to anyone cos i think thats the best thing to do and i think its well f**king abnormal to be a virgin until ur married unless ur married at 18 and that in itself is f**ked up.    just how many have u slept with anyway? he he    if its more than, say, 100 or 1000, then... LIE!    x
RgNUsKfxaa	i think your a strange person but hey no ones perfect.    i was beat with a belt on the bare bum when i was 11 for gluesniffing it was well deserved but it left me with scars i didnt enjoy it and i definitley stopped gluesniffing after it even tho i was only experimenting|`|AA11923501	I think I been bad too and need you to spank and restrain me.Oh and gaged if you please.|`|urDhIpogaa	wow that really ou like abuse even if you ihnk you deserve it thats really bad
5JevTJVkaa	I'd say spank away baby! If I had a fetish that I needed fulfilled I would. I would try to keep it under wraps though. Just make sure that it is clear to yourself and the guy that spanking is all it is going to be. Good luck with your spankings, and have a cheeky day.|`|d5PyQ6lvaa	Lets see here.  Your boyfriend won't spank you so you go and find someone who gets off on spanking you.  So you are giving pleasure to another man behind your boyfriends back.  How would you feel if he and another girl he met online were messing around but weren't having sex.  Would you be okay with that?  You should tell him and probably ask him to forgive you.  Oh, and stop seeing this other guy, because that's what he is.|`|Y8RznRGjaa	lol omg weird much????|`|WjSJBWl7aa	Don't ever ever bring it up with your boyfriend.. ever.. it will kill him..|`|CPkW0F4Taa	WTF thats still kinda cheating on your boyfriend another guy touching you!|`|lgNcsY8Aaa	lol wtf
60b0d42c3c92dec6d976704c90ee8eb5aa	He doesn`t sound a very good bet to me.  Where would this be going anyway.  Why waste time on him?  Internet relations are only fun if both parties enjoy them.|`|KNYF1hnhaa	You could be right about him.  If all he wants to do is talk dirty then he might be using you.  Try to talk to him about something non sexual and if he wont talk about it and insists on dirty talk, you have your answer and know what to do from there.|`|fMpKj0DYaa	It is VERY possible that his dirty talk was just that. Talking. But since he said he'd visit then i doubt it was just talking.|`|k1wAbgiHaa	Yes    ........|...  ........|..........SteveC ..........|||"|""\__  ........|__________________|||_|___|)  ........!(@)'(@)""""**!(@)(@)****!(@)|`|eO4y3m1maa	Yeah if thats all he wants to do he is probably using you.    Tell him straight up, hey can we get to know each other and stop with dirty talk. If you let them walk over you...they will, if you put your foot down he will stop talking to you (if thats all he wanted) or he will relax and have conversations with you...to eventually visit!|`|9FlAKRSRaa	Annoy him, saying, "Meh, I've seen longer."    LOL    Yeah, that guy just wants Internet dirty talk.  Dont count on him visiting, if he does, he might rape you.|`|fRX4GxUhaa	very unlikely, sounds to me like he's either married or in a relationship, and is using you. get out there and find someone decent|`|3hLZUvMZaa	First of all you are pathetic if you can't talk to a person in real life    Over The Internet?  dumb ***
eO4y3m1maa	When you go out looking for guys you won't find them, and when you do find them you will end up settling. I had a friend like that, she never found boyfriends...and would hang out to assholes that weren't going to date her..just looking for a bar fling.    At our age range, its tough. But don't go looking in bars! The best way is through friends of friends..or through some sort of class? Don't be shy anymore in the stores when you see a cute boy...ask for those digits!     Online dating is actually pretty successful too! I know alot of people (even myself once...we dated 2 years)..try it. Craigslist. (you will get slammed with alot of losers just delete them...but you can find a good one!) but its anonoymous so they dont see you sitting on a website..    I'm 24, so I totally know what your going through. The guy Im dating now has been a social friend for years but always had a girlfriend...one night at a show (happened to be my bday so i was being quite loud) he came up told me how he was single...and we'd been dating since. I was single for 3 years before that! I wasnt looking and it just came up to me..super odd! Sometimes there isnt a special tactic....it just happens.|`|7pFVHdssaa	I am here, call me, lets chat and have fun.  Talk to you soon I hope.|`|Fc4WF8Pqaa	TRY WOMAN|`|OMOuxROoaa	you can't find one because you are looking....the good ones always come when you least expect it.|`|eooUzAfzaa	It's hard, especially at this age.  You don't want to find a guy at a bar, but it's like..."where else do I look?"    I agree with the answer that suggested you're "looking" too hard.  It's totally true, you'll find each other.  In the mean-time, just have fun being single.  There isn't anything wrong with it.    I believe so much in fate.  My boyfriend of a year now, happened to move here exactly in the same month I did.  We got a job at the same place, went out on a few dates, and BAM!  Here we are a year later.    Just have fun, don't look around.  Like I said, you'll find each other.|`|jK2lvFWGaa	Well i am always looking to meet new people so Send me an email we'll talk ;-)|`|YVRXdfGHaa	One suggestion I could make, since you asked, is that you go back into your Answers profile and allow IM and e-mail. Then fill out your 360 page, complete with photos. You will get a lot of contacts, some from the perv crowd, some from the nice guys. Who knows, you might even hear from me.    Love comes from a lot of strange angles. Just be open, friendly, and get out of the house.|`|qy07K2k5aa	You should widen your social circle.|`|0nW8wMBdaa	It's easy when you are a girl.

I work with loads of women and the things they say and the amount of flirting I do with them would probably cause their husbands to divorce them if they knew!!! However this has never amounted to more than just fun.Trust is best but that is where you need to be a good judge of character.|`|fHHeal1Vaa	i would lock myself in the deepest forest trying to find the key why have I been given it apart from "helping others" because it seems you use it for such petty purposes. for nothing worthy actually. to attain impossible rich and help misfortunate, maybe, to rescue abused children, to be the president of the usa and turn human history around...when I see how awful your life is WITH such power, it makes me sick. it is not a gift in your case, it is a curse. He has given it to you to test you and you failed. Even if I am THE best thing that happened to you, you did utilize it for the right purpose in the beginning, to get to me, to make love to me and assure me that loving you as a man doesnt mean that I need to kill such an important part of myself such is my body and my desire for you, to postpone my disgust with your life for a while and establish some kind of connection, however falsely based, but some kind of connection because I was so afraid subconsciously of the experiance of being raped and powerless in the hands of a lunatic that I stayed on the track of "love" sufficiently enough for you to show your real face. But then, after the beginning and the right use of it, you used it to force me to communicate the unspeakable dirtiness and uglyness, forced yourself onto me when realized that I am slipping through your fingers and when you saw that the connection with Him that I have is real and not whatever you believed it was. but it was too late already. I honestly believe that I have met satan and I am not surprised that he is not what stupid ignorant people see in books but what he really is, the opposite of my Beloved. He tricked you, destroyed you more than you could have ever made it yourself but I suppose you asked for it. We always do. A few wrong turns here and there and you end up as my teacher. In the deepest corners of hell. But he only meant well and mostly unselfish, suffered so much pain, poor poor man. Imagine how desperate pain you are in forces you to dive so deep into irrelevant things. And all that time you ask for an explanation instead asking for comfort. Only a male mind can do such a stupid thing. Tragic, stupid. However, the consequences of his actions in the world are so severe. Poor man, I will always have a tender heart for him, for his struggle. Imagine to describe all your life into details what you have read in books and what you maybe even saw in others but never to be able to experiance it yourself. It is like he was saying - yes, some of you, His people, you are maybe happy but look at me, I am big, I am so useful, I am His real servant. Like he was, poor child, attempting to seduce the Father by helping His other children see, helping them so strongly that he attacked everything that existed and believed that the goal justifies the means. But how do you know how to please the Father if you dont Him? Poor poor child. So strong, so immensely intelligent, so gifted yet so crippled.I feel He did the same with you. I feel guilty for being saved and not being able to give it to you but there is nothing I can do about it. It was between Him and you. You have no joy of watching us when you cannot be a part of it. You could have been but you have destroyed the conditions. Maybe He wants you to see yourself in the mirror of my mind and my relation with Him. I am sure He does. But where you end, my life begins and my lesson is not as easy as yours. So, when the time for children is to go back to bed, the adults will remain to discuss our issues. Darling, I wish there is a way to make your concerns important when it comes to you walking hand in hand with me, so much younger than you, after all that you did to me. But the only concern that both of us should have is how to keep me alive after what you did, everything else is just some dust in your hand that will be gone with the wind in the moment of your death. And insisting in dealing with your petty things NOW, after all that happened, makes things only worse for you. especialy without making love, waiting is unbearable and tension in every aspect of my life is so strong that I need to get out of it soon and forever, however strongly you believe that everything will be ok. I believe that there is evil, rather undeveloped consciousness, however much childish, still it can kill if the weapons in their hands, I believe that this doesnt HAVE TO end well for both of us because it takes away our own decision and the Lord is not a tyrant, it doesnt amuse Him to impose EVERYTHING. There is something in our effort too. He set the scene perfectly but they are our roles. What could be at the end of this in a right way, I can only imagine, I believe He doesnt have a chance to have something like this very often. Can we fall down or maybe we have already, yes. When I look at my teacher my heart breaks, despite all the terrible things he must have done to the ones that loved him the most , it breaks to see how close yet how infinitely far he wa|`|NuUdCz0Laa	I would not want that power.

It's not going under false pretences, it's allowing someone to confide their trust in your and eventually tell you what they're thinking when they feel the time is right and they actually want to talk about it.|`|oRzqWhsDaa	If I had the power and I would make up a fake name and photograph and have him going on the internet and make up a fake date watch him squirm while he is waiting for this mystery woman and knowing he was cheating and chasing other women I would get some divorce papers and give it to him it would hurt but I would make a new life for myself|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	You know, a person could talk themselves into paranoid state of mind thinking like this. If you don't trust your partner, there is a reason for that, and the computer is only a communications device. Should we install key loggers? How about a wire tap on the phone? Or go through their text messages. People do have a right to privacy, but if, as you have asked, you suspect a partner is cheating, you need 'real time' evidence. How far you are willing to go depends on you.

If that was the case then yes I would get to the bottom of it and see exactly what he was doing on the machine that robes you of your time. If not then leave him alone and have some trust if he says hes not being bad on the computer than believe him its up to you but if your relationship has gone so far that you already know without the proof and don't want to face it than your probably prolonging some sort of heartbreak for yourself so in the long run stick to your gut instincts and if you think hes is doing things he shouldn't be doing than find out my God why would anyone want to stay in the dark like a fool I wouldn't.....sorry for the harshness good luck...angel|`|hoOU6HDbaa	If i had, i would use it, yet I would rather not have that power.  What we do not know won't hurt. False pretenses would surface naturally soon, not only thru' the internet.  Should there be no trust, we do not go into further commitments.  I believe privacy and trust is a must in a relationship.

He likes camping and  has a tent but a portable hammock! just an example!!! or by him some lingerie! depending on your age! i guess you need to take into consideration how much you can spend does he deserved to be spoilt and are doing this to make him like you more? or?? ask yourself some questions first... but just try and think about what he likes. dont look like another woman that falls at the feet of a man! so if he gets you a pressy then give it to him and if he doesnt give you one then dont give it to him and dump him!

Perhaps, if I had called a girl that, I would stop if she didn't do it back.  So, say, if you don't compliment him, or don't really make out that you like him, he'll stop (I would)  As it would sound really obsessive if he kept doing it and you never did it back. So there is your answer.  Although maybe now he isn't interested, and wants to break it to you gradually. That's happened alot to make with girls, their texts have just slowly declined to nothing.

I don't like it cause it's long. =p|`|VSBVqfRCaa	i think i am fine. with my looks. god made me this way. and if anyone has a problem with it take it up to god.|`|ZlYmbAVQaa	yes, my hair because my roots need doing lol|`|haw8rJHGaa	Yea i do im working on it now i've always been a big fan of Guns n Roses so im trying to incorperate things from the bands style into my own. I don't know yet if it will look good lol.|`|7TgQuIWsaa	yes i do, because its the most depressing thing to have guys say "the first thing i love about a girl is her eyes!" and then you realize you dont have beautiful eyes to wow them :(    and also no, because then i'd know a guy really loves me for who i am, and theres only one of me out there.|`|AA11861088	No. If people can't love me the way I am and want to change me, then they don't really love me.|`|oiyugIE0aa	Yes....completely....because I do not feel all that attractive, and everyone seems to be attracted to slim pretty blue eyed blondes these days....rather than a brown eyed brunette with a little more muscle|`|jYOBoEwAaa	i want to lose weight
qy07K2k5aa	You can try and initiate more conversations with him when you are at the supermarket.|`|tzNqAWhdaa	Just strike up a conversation and see where it goes, ask him out for coffee or lunch if you don't try you will never know and you will always wonder|`|Fc4WF8Pqaa	BLOW HIM!!!
28HLij60aa	It seems you've lost your motivation over everything else.  I'd suggest looking over the problem as a whole before you start trying to solve it.     Your grades were of a higher standard this time last year and your teachers have actually started to bug you. The answer then could be, you find the work set for you is too easy and you need to be set higher and harder challenges to get your brain working in the way it should be.    Other than that, you're going through a bit of a grey patch at the moment and you need more stimulation from your extra curricular activities. for example, do you attend any study groups after school? Do you play any sports after school or at weekends? You need to break your own pattern and mix it up a bit...it could be you're not bored so much with school, you're more bored with the day to day run of events.     By giving yourself something new to look at to break the monotony of study, you could be doing yourself more of a favour in the long run.     Try going to modern art galleries to get a fresh look on perspectives for your graphic design course, try asking your biology teacher for more info on the stuff you've learned in class so you can get more of an idea of the subject areas being studied in your own time. You could even read up on the links between maths and science as far as subjects go-you'll be amazed how closely linked they are. Above all, refresh your brain with new info that relates directly with what you're studying. It might help you out a lot!|`|aIS1asOjaa	Go to school every day with a smile on your face :)|`|4MSuBBJfaa	Think of how sucky your lifes gonna be if yo don't start to do well. You will flunk and not be in college living on the streets poor. Think about that and I lose interest in shool all the time . Your in HS many people your age do but thats why it's your responsiility to find that motiv or reason behind school. If you didn' goyou won't see your friends as much, you'll get really bored at home all the time, you'll be stupid nd well its a dumb choice.  Glad I could help!|`|q8bJzyUaaa	oh come on, I feel like that everyday! everybody does, just deal with it and go to school  .|`|CRhS02q8aa	Then don't. Just be ready for the consequences. School is one of those things you have to pick and choose your battles.  Just remember your GPA for the past four years will matter on graduation day.|`|NEJgU0BNaa	too bad
nibQqNaaaa	I have yet to meet a woman smarter than me|`|hoBREUGLaa	I like having things explained to my from my girlfriend rather than trying to explain something to her, it's just personal preference.|`|ma6Re8B1aa	Of course some guys wouldn't date them. Their just as insecure as some woman. You see it every day just being on here.|`|qy07K2k5aa	It depends on how much smarter.|`|e5f4c192231c92a0d059825b151f7553aa	Actually - no.    Sometimes it is soo relaxing knowing that you don`t need to know it all - and that your partner is smarter than you, so you can ask her to help if things go over your head.|`|KNYF1hnhaa	Absolutely not.  There are things that she will be smarter at and things that I will be smarter at.  If that is intimidating to a person then they have some serious issues.  I love learning new things from my fiance and love sharing things with her that she does not know about.|`|ybkQ2slOaa	no|`|J29mNySoaa	Nah....I wouldn't mind as long as they don't try to correct everything I say or talk in a strange way. I personally like smart girls.
qy07K2k5aa	Just be brave this once. Imagine a scenario where you can be scared of everything in your whole life, but this once you must have the courage. Remember that if you really like her, it would have conquered your fear already. When you have a conversation with her, don't ask "Yes" or "No" questions, get her to talk more. Be calm and straightforward and remember to smile. Good luck.|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	Girls like guys with confidence (not arrogance) so learn to assert yourself in a confident and mature way. Try to find out what she likes, and if you have any common interests and go from there.|`|9eMYzY0Paa	You can talk about things she likes, and get to know her.|`|jROpVbrhaa	Be man enough to introduce yourself.you have nothing to loose.Good luck.|`|iz57WUymaa	Just smile wave maybe leave something of yours with her in a store or something???

H6ugevITaa	Yep i think he wants to talk but is maybe scared of what u will say to him? If u want him to talk to u? maybe smile?  :)|`|WjSJBWl7aa	You have two options:    Continue ignoring him  Talk to him    Which is going to give you an answer on whether he wants your attention?|`|fHHeal1Vaa	you will never get the same attention from the beginning, i will never be like that here on yahoo answers, they have served their purpose, its age is over. this is the ringing of the end of communication here so i want to leave as much as possible so you leave me alone as much as possible before my ideal news, my whole heartedly awaited news.

It's not like you're talking about sex or something!  Either grab him and give him a hug, or say "hug me!"  !!!      This is like the sweetest question ever asked on here.|`|vbyxckpdaa	hug him first?|`|dbCkTKDxaa	ask for a hug or just do it your self|`|0ox8VKwKaa	Invade his space.

2aef05726285279aabdf8cdf33d05ea1aa	sounds to me like you dealt with a lot of rejection in your life, maybe as a child.  you should seek therapy.  your feelings are not normal and are quite sad.  i hope you do seek help, because love can be wonderful.|`|AA11082556	THERAPY|`|aee8316837d471fcec00e37d6053028faa	I would have to say that you are one of the most loneliest people i've ever read, well that and you hate yourself and as long as you keep that up, your never gonna like anyone... so you can sit there and be miserable or get up and do something about it...my guess on this one would be for you to sit there and be miserable until you can't take it anymore.... don't even ask for help, be miserable, be miserable, be miserable... I do know your kind of self hate because i've suffered with that too... just sit there micheal and be miserable- no one will be affected by this but you, so go ahead and suffer away... If I could scream that over and over again I would, just so you could know how ugly that really is to yourself... a part of you really wants the rest of you to suffer and that wont quit happening until you just make it stop...|`|96c966b8691bf8b7a40ea9fe0d761803aa	Mate we all have dysfunctional personalities to a certain degree - we are all off balance in some way. It's just about understanding yourself and then getting yourself out of the habits. I agree that a professional really can be a great help - they can often see things that we can't see or are unwilling to admit.|`|AA11286083	Satan has a firm grasp on your mind buddy!  He wants you to believe that you are worthless and no-one will ever love you etc.<br>  If he can convince you that God doesn't care about you, he's won. Don't be a wuss! Put up a fight, everyone in the world WANTS love. They may fear it because of past hurts. That's life though, you have to take the good with the bad. Even if there hasn't been much good.<br>  Take a minute and read the Bible, pray, talk to a pastor, or a Christian counsel. Go on-line to a prayer group and ask others to pray for you.

AA11463342	Hmmm....I am in the same situation. My ex cheated, lied, abused me, gambled, stole, did drugs, sold drugs....the works. He is now in prison for selling drugs and I can't help but feel sorry for him because he has always been so pathetic. Maybe, like me, you were raised in a family where your parents stayed together through anything. Maybe you were raised in a religion that tells you to make it work at all cost. Maybe your ex was very good at passing the blame off on you and lowering your self esteem. In any case, you made the right decision. I stayed in my marriage for eight years until he finally left to "get his life together" (which was clearly not happening). During this time I moved on and he was upset by it. He divorced me and I am glad he did because I would probably not have had the courage. It was after that he went to prison for five years. Four years later now, I am engaged to a great guy but still feel pangs of guilt that I am happy and that I failed at making my marriage work. I feel bad for things I did that contributed to the nightmare that was my life, though I know that one would have a tough time reacting any other way. I have found that it helps to remember the times that he had no consideration for the sadness and misery I felt while he acted terribly. I thank God every day for helping me out of that mess. I hope for my ex to turn his life around and find a good relationship of his own and still communicate with him and assist him when I can without letting it consume my life. Maybe it is time we both stop beating ourselves up and taking over where our ex's left off. You were courageous to leave. Try to stop looking at the closed door or you may not notice the open door in front of you. Leaving may have been the best thing you could have done. Not only for your benefit but for his. When someone is faced with consequences of their actions they are closer to making changes. Had you stayed and constantly forgave him.....the behavior only would have gotten worse.  Good luck and God Bless|`|a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	u are feeling a false sense of guilt, blaming yourself for what he did. u feel bad, cause your the type of person who doesn't like to give up on anyone. u did right, u will love him forever, love doesn't just die. u grieve what u thought the marriage was, u grieve what the marriage could have been, but he made the choices to do what he did, this had nothing to do with you. infact u are quite a strong woman, to know when to walk out.|`|3678a63c227fb95efdb295c02f4aa475aa	Good for you!<br>  The guilt is from the death of a union.  I just got divorced about 18 months ago and I know what you are saying.  It will get better but don't you dare look back OR go back!  If you do I will hunt you down and pinch your head off!!  LOL.

In some ways, you may feel as f you have failed. You have not. You may feel as if he is going to hurt himself if you leave. He may, but it is not your fault. That is his choice. You may even feel ashamed that something was more important to him than you relationship. What it comes down to is, he was too immature to see his loss...You are saving yourself.

aa2647e104c44122e49de578200f60faaa	Well for starters I would show him this letter, it would really let him know how you feel. Second, if you really love him then never give up.

Try doing some of the things you used to do together, and hopefully, the old feelings will return. Knowing your ages would help you get some better advice.

Lay it on the table, give him a little time but if he says 'no' then you are free to move on, and he wasn't right for you. At least you'll never have regrets about not trying.

Some times it's not peasant.  Don't deal with them, because you are playing into their game.  You can't please everyone all the time. Don't hold on to any hard feelings.

yiRatTLtaa	OK:This answer will be long....Well first of all , you must look inside of you and see what ever made you think that when you  talk you sound stupid or  that something is wrong.Nothing is wrong with you , you're just FINE .And you need to learn to be a bit more bold ! ! ! Even if I haven't got the slightest idea who you are , I highly doubt that when you talk you sound stupid ! You know what? It MIGHT just happen that when you say something , it will be a little silly from time to time but that is just FINE ! Nobody is perfect and being right and correct all the time will give people the impression that you are some sort of a robot ! So stop worrying so much , stop overnalyzing and start LIVING the Highschool life ! !It's actually very CUTE when someone says something silly cause flaws are adorable.So there will always be the people who will either LIKE you , or HATE you .....The shades of grey are going to be very rare when it will come to this topic.Who likes you FINE , who doesn't FINE again.At least they will RESPECT you for not changing in order to fit their demented pattern  like a tree's branches when the wind blows..have strong branches and strong roots!.So step up there and who doesn't like you it's their problem ! Not yours.Hope this helped a bit...|`|JXY0Vuvtaa	listen 2  rebecca=]  shes right ?|`|w1kvhxX5aa	just bear hug everyone you see that should fix it|`|UDu828VEaa	Professor Chester says just talk small talk.  Weather, Nice bus ride.  Just practise on people you meet on the street.  Make sure they are going your way, or just hanging out.  Watch their reaction, judge to see if they like to talk to you, if not move on.|`|fvUAYU7xaa	I feel the same way about myself.  I cant really talk to someone that im not super-close to without blushing. i feel stupid and i feel like somebodys laughing at my somewhere. I worry too much about what people are thinking.    The best thing to do is to think to yourself "Nobody thinks im stupid. Stop worrying about what people think". I keep repeating that in my head and it seems to help.  Try joining a group or club too, to be more involved and to gain confidence in yourself :)|`|sDqS69Q6aa	It depends on how serious the problemause is.  If it interferes with your daily life (where you go, what you do, what opportunities you take) then you need to get help.      1. Tell your parents what is going on.  They might help and support you.  You'd be surprised.  If it is going to affect your major life decisions, like going to college, getting a job, or getting married, let them know!  They might have good advice.  If the problem persists ask if they would consider taking you to a therapist or to the doctor.    2. Tell your guidance counselor.  Some schools offer support groups for social phobia.    3.  Try to assert yourself in small ways.  Read about overcoming shyness.|`|giQBO1ctaa	I'm extremely shy by nature and lack confidence.  I know it's hard and uncomfortable but the best way to overcome it is by talking to as many people as possible.  Push yourself to do new things and don't worry about looking stupid --- everyone looks stupid at times....just laugh it off.  Start with something small.  It's okay to be afraid but it's not okay to just give up and not try at all.|`|fca3b6ac45b683b2c3cb75b6bfcba848aa	dance like nobodyz watching you.......sing like nobodyz hearing u......  that wud come out the best.....jus be free in ur approach that would help gain self confidence........believe me its gonna work!
1uRUaSblaa	You mentioned: "I have this wonderful, caring guy in my life. We get along great. He's like my best friend. But i'm gonna marry someone else. (My kids father)"    The word 'But' sounds like you are unsure if you settling for the right person for life.    You may have to settle your feelings for this great friend, so as not to bring them over to your marriage and feel regretful you married someone 2nd best.    I believe one would be most happy to marry his/her best friend, confidante, play-mate...someone who can complete him/her.    Marrying someone you feel less than best even before marriage can be very challenging in the long run.|`|AX4ffdNbaa	My best friend has always made me laugh & smile. We were with other people. After 5 years he realized that he had fallin in love with me. He takes my breath away everyday and now we are engaged. Go with what makes you happy not necessarily what's right. If you marry him for your kids, you may end up miserable down the road. my fiance did when his ex-wife was pregnant (kids are now adults) and he regrets doing it for that reason, it wasn't for love
AA10757358	Your husband should not be afraid of his son.  He should have not let his son be a trouble maker all night he should have put a stop to it.  The son has to respect his father before he can change his attitude.  Your husband can be loving but firm when he tells his son to do something.  Make going to bed fun.  Let you husband start putting him to bed even if you are there.  Let him tell him a story or read him  a book, bounce him on the bed, take him Piggy back riding to his bed.  They have to get to know each other and 4 years old is a tender age and you have to earn their respect and love.  Let you husband take just his son out for a special outing, to a movie, to get ice cream, or to the library.  Let him give some suggestions to his son and let him ask his son which he would like to do.  Let his father swing him.  Good luck to the boh of them.|`|WZVz5jWHaa	Just stay with it.  Your son will eventually get used to the new idea of Dad being there and that he has to mind his Dad.  Time will take care of it.  Good luck.|`|MUDDyIKtaa	He probably is dealing with some form of separation anxiety, he was so used to you being the one there, try making the transistion a bit easier by doing these things together on occasion and then gradually phasing yourself out, and eventually just taking turns. your husband is probably a great father, but children grasp at routine, it is a comfort. its like taking there favorite blanket or toy away. Your husband i am sure does things just a bit different, your son needs to get used to that.
4MSuBBJfaa	Well go for  a walk and say we need to talk . Then sit down and say I think I have more feelings for you then I thought. ____ I really like you. Just tell him how you feel you a really lucky girl he sounds incredibly sweet you should go for him! Hes defiantly crazy about you just don't wait  around to long...|`|RZfDrdIRaa	I would just tell him! be honest. but you need to ask yourself if you like him or your current boyfriend more!

IKXZZDH9aa	He has every right to decline signing this paperwork if he feels that it's not in the best interest of the child and his relationship with the child. I'm sure if the shoe was on the other foot, you wouldn't allow him to move, especially giving terms that fit YOU best.    You're sitting here telling me that a man that is ordered to state standard visitation, which only allows him to see his children 25% of the year, which pans out to roughly 91 days a year out of 365, should negotiate with you on YOUR terms to see his child less often????    I wouldn't allow the move, and in fact would allow the judge to decide if the move is necessary.    The main question that you have to answer is, how is this in the best interest of the child that you move. How will the circumstances change to better benefit the CHILD, not YOU?|`|RZfDrdIRaa	tough one! Im going through a similar situation. my current hubby is moving out of state for work, i cant go because i have 2 children from a previous marriage and the ex said no even though i offered him out of child support, offered every school vacation and the entire summer---very generous and he still said no! I had a friend JUST go through this and she took the ex to court and the judge said no because there aren't enough fathers who want to be involved with their kids....I don't know laws in KY but thats how it is here in MI! Oh by the way my current hubby knows all this and is moving anyway!|`|78BZKEuraa	talk to an attorney|`|NNHdkLDWaa	You mean he did not get over the fact that you decided to break up and whatever man is in your life sees the daughter more often than her own father while he still have the pleasure to pay child support punishable by jail if he fails to ? Shame :p .    And Shannon, was your EX really so bad that he deserved divorce ? What is it with yu women expecting your exes to lube up and just take it ?|`|JRV8gHbkaa	Good for him. He wants to keep his child close to him. Just because thats what you want doesn't mean he has to be ok with it. You already took his kid away from living with him all the time to just part time. Now you want to change the judgement or agreement. How selfish of you.
AA10757358	I hope they let you bury your cat.   A person just can't eat their pet I am sorry your parents do not understand that.|`|AA10436595	I can relate to your issue.  When I was a child, I had a pet hen "Mandy".  She would come to me when I called her and let me hold her.  One Sunday we were having a guest for dinner.  My grandmother chose to roast a hen.  You guessed it!  I couldn't find Mandy that morning.  She had chosen her because she was tame and would come when called.  I was heartbroken.  My grandmother later said she dreamed she had reached over to cut off the hen's leg and found it was I she had cooked.  Bury your pet!!!!!|`|oRzqWhsDaa	bury your cat|`|Tn0EBBCZaa	Its your cat you do what you feel is right for the cat.

884v4VhGaa	If you need to look traditional why not a sari? I've seen a lot of women wear them to mass on a regular basis. There are no real traditions for what is worn at a Catholic wedding, so aside from making sure you're covered up enough for church (which as far as I know most traditional Indian clothing does) you're completely free to wear whatever you want.     Ask your brother how traditionally he will be dressing. If he's wearing a Western-style suit then wear a Western-style dress, but in Indian wedding colours. If he's wearing a mix, then do the same, or wear something like a shalwar kameez, which looks a lot more like Western outfits than a sari does.     Best of luck, and I'm sure you'll look great no matter what you choose.|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	well I'm assuming you're not in the wedding party because in that case the bride would tell you what to wear and pick your dress for you.  what time of year is the wedding?  if it's spring or summer, a short dress is OK, like at the knee.  if fall or winter, get a dress a little longer, to the calf.  there's probably no need to get a full length evening gown unless the reception is black tie optional.  in a catholic church it's customary to have your shoulders covered so nothing strapless.|`|oUcLSDZ6aa	Ask the bride, it's up to her.

If "someone" understands their emotional state then they can tell the "someone else" how to deal with "someone" when they are feeling down.

If she has repeatedly said things that hurt you, then she was not being a good best friend.   She was being a 'toxic' friend and you don't want to keep toxic people in your life.    You made the right choice and I hope you meet good, positive friends in the future.|`|mOgdarRIaa	you know, i can relate to you. sometimes it's difficult to fight the odds. if it's just you against the world, it's really hard that you feel like giving up. i kept on going being the best friend i could be for the girl i loved but she just wasn't able to recognize it. and it's more than seven years now that i've waited.    my advise is this, try to make friends with other people. don't look at it as though you can't survive without her. if you were destined for each other, she'll come back. and also look on the bright side, maybe she really wants the other guy, she has her own choice. just pray that she would find the guy who would be good to her. if you did your best for her, it's not your loss, at least you loved . just be happy for your friend, ok? you'll pull yourself together...just pray and seek God's guidance.|`|156157bb626c5793b1ec18abc01f56cdaa	sometimes in life we grow apart from friends.

That she means a lot to you and you do not want to hurt your friend relationship with her. It's ok to tell her that sometimes she hurts your feelings. Be  careful and don't get into a abusive situation. Just because you want the friendship. That's not good for either of you. You should not have to be a afraid of getting your feelings hurt from your best friend. Best friends are suppose to be there for you and to help you fell better. Not to tear you down. I hope you can work this out. I had a male best friend for years. I lost him to cancer in 1998. I miss him a lot. And would give anything to see him again.

Good luck with it.|`|SDaJkLMfaa	No, whatever you do, don't give up this friendship. Everything works out for the better in the end. Never give up hope. Try to forgive and forget if you can. Don't expect your closest friend to know what you're thinking of all the time though. Nobody knows you better than yourself. Don't assume. Give the both of you another shot.
lsFDEx2oaa	I should really charge you for this therapy session here, but since I'm such a nice guy, keep your $150 and enjoy.    All your problems to me see sound they are intertwined.  You say that you are introverted most of your life and that you have no friends.  You feel alone because you feel that you cannot be accepted the way you are, you are machine like-- except internally self-conscious and probably lacking real self esteem.      You think that women see you as a lost boy inside a cage because you see yourself as a lost boy inside a cage.  However, you are misguided here-- women do not bring it out of you, you bring it out of you.  You can easily bring this out in front of a family member, friend (I'm sure you have at least one you are close to), real psychologist, etc.  You WANT a woman to bring it out of you, you want to feel vulnerable.      Feeling vulnerable is nothing to be ashamed of or embarrassed about; everyone at one point is vulnerable.  It's understand how to cope with that particular problem that makes you vulnerable.  Example:  if you break your leg, your leg is vulnerable.  If you get crutches, your leg is still vulnerable but at least you are taking the steps to cope with the problem.  And time will heal all wounds, mentally or physically.    Having fears about being vulnerable is common; you need to build up your own self esteem and learn to take care of yourself.  An angel might help you to your feet, but she will NOT rebuild you head to toe.  You need to take some time to help yourself and not be so dependent on your "angel".  If you feel you are truly alone, you must be independent.  You have to show your independence here, too.  Women love guys with self esteem and the ability to feel vulnerable and take care of themselves.  Women LOVE to help guys that feel vulnerable yet can help themselves.  You are not helpless, you are unwilling to help yourself.    Jump.  Free-fall.  Listen to Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers - Free Fallin'.  People understand your pain if you open up and try to help yourself.  You won't be immediately rejected.  You're 21, enjoy life.  Meet some people to surround yourself with, you won't feel so alone.  The void will begin to become filled and your happiness might carry over and be human-like.  It might even be reflected in your art, never know.|`|AA10451072	Oh my god. You are an AMAZING writer.

It's human nature to appreciate beauty. I actually worry about people that say they don't look at ANYONE - men, women, whatever. I am just as likely to "check out" a woman as I am a man. Hell, women are beautiful!    But I think women tend to ( generalizing here ) look in a more "appreciative" way and less of a "lustful" way... so nothing to get jealous over. =)
uJ9waJDYaa	I think its more how you use it and how you can use your hands an other ways to make her feel good than just penis size alone.

There is a difference between making love and just having sex.  Making love involves your heart as well as your body, and the size of your man's penis doesnt seem an issue if you love him, its the way you feel when he touches you that is important. (well, unless its a shockingly teeny weeny one, that is).  But I guess thats easy for me to say, as my fiance's "magic wand" (lol) is a perfect fit for me, hallelujah :-)|`|Gx14PIvxaa	YES! I had that problem with my ex. Of course like you said, size isn't everything, but I was used to a little more...    My boyfriend now, I promise you, the first time we had sex was so amazing and so special so I don't want to insult the act, but honestly when I saw his... I let out a little happy squeal in my head! He is perfect! Of course if you love someone, you would be with him regardless, especially if you don't sleep together right away. Sex is so common now, people have sex before they really get to know each other. If you love someone before you have sex, the physical aspects aren't so important...|`|fMDS4vTGaa	That is such a personal preference that its impossible to assume that all women may feel one way or another.  I'm sure everyone has had a former lover who was good at one thing or another that they look back upon fondly.      There is no way that anyone can possibly be everything at all times.  What your friend told you was pretty personal.  Why on earth was she telling you something so intimate?      Stop dwelling on something like that, who cares?  I had a friend of mine tell me that she prefers smaller men because the sensation is "easier to control" whatever that means.      You are applying the age old stereotype that a large member is what all woman yearn for. Ain't necessarily so.  Your lady friend should keep such intimate details to herself in my opinion.
H3WHxCgaaa	It's been almost 13 years and I still think my husband is the funniest, sexiest man alive.  Yes - I still feel giddy when I see him...I think that what they say is true - men are like a fine wine - they only get better over time.      That said - there are some times that it's not giddy - it's more like an internal scowl...every marriage has it's ups and downs and when you are heading down the slope, giddy is hard to conjure up.    I think that overtime you become a more solid team - you share more, you trust more, you just get to know each other in deeper more meaningful ways...ways that the outside world will never get to see.  Your levels of caring and compassion just grow stronger over time.|`|ma6Re8B1aa	Ya I still get in awe over my husband now. I think he's the kindest person to me in the world.

A: I never looked at her in awe.  We've been married for 22 years.  I've looked at her with adoration, respect, gratitude, and love, but never awe.    Q: Like just they still are the most amazing person in the world and you still get that giddy feeling when you look at them?  A: I never got giddy when I looked at her.  Happy, yes, and lots of other positive feelings.  Giddy, no.      Q: Do you still think they are the most gorgeous person in the world?  A: I never thought she was the MOST gorgeous person in the world.  I always was and still am attracted to her, though.  She's certainly more attractive than I ever would have thought I would have a chance to marry.    Q: Basicaly I wann know what goes away with time, do you still get giddy inside over them?  A: I thought we already addressed the giddy issue.  And I can't think of anything that's gone away over time.    Q:And what new feelings come around after you have been together for a while?  A: A deep, strong, and powerful love and connectedness comes around.  But, I wouldn't expect you to understand how much better that is than being giddy, lol.|`|on6bS2Vaaa	I think after 5 plus years it become a routine and can't do with out that person.|`|145c8348c6805dffd8ad539dedd6effbaa	25 years for me.  I still see her as the person I met on that first day.|`|TDiRmT9daa	When I first met my husband, I thought he was pretty amazing. He was tall, dark and handsome with a slight European accent - very sexy. He was intelligent, educated and cultured. But what made him really amazing was the conversation. On our first date he took me to lunch at the university we both attended. We got so lost in our conversation that we didn't notice that the cafeteria was closing. We had been there for 9 hours!    I always felt butterflies in my stomach when I saw him or even when I heard his voice on the phone. Being with him was like coming home.    27+ years later, we have bought and sold homes, built businesses, raised 4 children, took care of each other through major illness and surgery, and got each other through other critical times. He is my best friend and my partner in life.    The new feelings that have come from being together for more than half our lives and sharing the most profound experiences and achievements with each other are a deeper, richer version of the feelings we had for each other at the beginning.    I admire him more now because there is more to admire. I love him more now because I know how authentic he is. I still get butterflies.    I think the difference between couples who are happy and couples who aren't is in what they bring out in each other. When people first get together, each is trying to show only their best side. After a time, people start to relax and are less careful to be at their best.    If you are with someone who strives to always be at their best and who brings out the best in you, that becomes a lifelong habit. If you allow your relationship to fall into a dynamic where you bring out the worst in each other - fighting about things that don't matter, holding anger and placing blame, saying hurtful things, etc. then the baggage that accumulates is very difficult to clear. It is much better not to go there in the first place.    So I will caution you about that "giddy" feeling. Try to see your partner as a balanced individual. Notice that they have faults but keep your attention on the strengths and good that doesn't fade - their integrity, their authenticity, their values and beliefs, their capacity to give, love, share. Then the admiration you feel will not diminish when their hair turns gray or falls out! It will grow because its roots are planted in fertile soil.    There is a huge difference between love and infatuation. Love lasts a lifetime and grows with time. Infatuation is intense but fleeting. When it fades, there is nothing underneath. This is why it isn't wise to rush into marriage. Take your time and you will learn the difference for yourself.    EDIT: Your love will change with time. How it changes will depend on how each of you changes. Sometimes people grow apart and sometimes they get closer. Ironically, the same things that bring some people closer drive others apart - things like having children, career changes, financial changes. I don't think anyone can really answer your question except to share their own experience. And everyone is so different...    I would say the best thing you can do is have faith in your love and your future together. Life has many mysteries that it reveals to us as we go along. That's what makes it interesting and exciting! The most fulfillment that we can have, however, is to embrace the now - live in the moment and live fully because each moment creates the next!|`|5eb91cf6975ab0255d6bcd6a2f138343aa	My husband and I have been married for 10yrs together 14yrs and i love him more today than ever our love just keeps growing. I still get giddy and just looking at him thinking how good looking he is. He is my only and he is my true love and soul mate. The longer we are together the more we love each other. Nothing has really changed we have just gotten older and had kids but we still love each other. The only thing that has changed is we don't get as much alone time together as we used to before children but when we do we make up for it. So being together for a long time doesn't have to change anything if you still love each other its all good. To be honest i can be just sitting around doing nothing and start day dreaming about him just like i did when we first met and i still get chills and that butterfly feeling in my tummy when i think about him!
kprKXEOSaa	"Pantsing" is what 13-year-olds do.    If you're in private and take a guy's pants off, though, he's going to think you want sex, it doesn't matter how old you are for that.  Not a smart thing to do, unless you're married.|`|Midbg5BJaa	Pantsed????    Is that what the kids are calling it these days?    No imagination...|`|pUvEmPrCaa	It depends how close you are with the guy and what his sense of humor is.  He might get offended if he doesn't feel the same way.|`|LihoWe84aa	hell yeah ! : )  if you see something you like you should go for it!  Love  Rebecca|`|TTaLB4kdaa	Probably. It depends though. It's hard to panse a guy if hes wearing a belt.|`|Q2UDhYgkaa	No - sorry to disappoint you. I guess that is just too classy for me.|`|BFfP8IYkaa	no|`|RYARNa8Qaa	yes!|`|OMOuxROoaa	in high school i did it in the middle of the hallway!!!|`|Ku6446uyaa	no that is not how you tell a guy he is hot walk up to him and just say hey your hot then he will no that you are on to him|`|6YTjC3Aqaa	watch  your language ....loool ,,,,well not really actually|`|FQ0lKEB0aa	Personally, yes I would. But its not for everyone.|`|8PkNZTnLaa	Yea!   Haha:)  Lol  That would be  Funny ;)|`|PpYl2dFVaa	no
1d86ed5e88a024daffb47bccfc5a461baa	OK! Everything sounded ok until you used the F word. Try to leave that word out next time. Because when using the F word. That is the only thing she heard. But I think you were right. I guess they are trying to get out and go home. Good Luck|`|V5PxYG17aa	Remember this.....the lunchladies spet all day preparing your food. They then have to stand there and serve the food. They are probably really tired and dont' get much thanks or support from the students. Maybe they feel unappreciated. When you go through the lunchline don't say, "why dont you mind your own fu*king business and do your job". If someone said that to you would you like that? Instead say your sorry and you'll try to remember that nextime. Give her a smile a thank-you a card. Just encourage her. Don't be so mean...you don't know what she goes through.|`|dBkEqT2naa	It's wrong to swear. I think that it was mean. You could have articulated what you wanted to say in a more polite but firm manner.|`|clu2Ia4paa	it was kinda mean...if it weren't for "fu*king" it would have been well deserved i mean she should mind her own business  but.....|`|Gx14PIvxaa	That's rude no matter who it was. You don't talk to people like that.
rApLHbmWaa	I am also the 13 year old girl who was a victim of the very much older friend of the family! And even though it has been many many years I am still dealing with the pain and confusion of the whole situation!  At such a young age you have learned what sex is in the mildest form and you think that the first time it happens in your life your suppose to be married and be so much in love that it will be glorious!  But then this happens and it is like the difference between heaven and hell! There are so many things going on in your mind... Why me? What did I do to deserve this? Am I an awful person? Is it my fault? I thought the first time was supposed to be glorious?  Being in this situation you really want people to be around when you need them but to give you space when you need it! Encourage everyone to keep it very secretive.. because some people believe you but a lot of people don't believe you all because they didn't see it with their own eyes or because they can't grasp that things like that really do happen! You definitely don't need people that don't believe... it is really discouraging when you know what hell you went through... that makes you really confused!  Sometimes they will offer counceling! I encourage this only if she wants to talk! if she doesn't want to talk now don't make her! She may be able to push this to the back of her mind and leave it their as way to deal with it. But more than likely she will eventually become comfortable! At that point it may be a time to ask her about counceling that way she can be around other people who have also been through this and they can work together at healing!  Also encourage the mother that it is not her fault! My mom thought it was her fault because she didn't see the signs that something was wrong! Therefore she became very over protective and it really wounded my realationship with her!   As for what you will want to do.... Nothing different than normal! She will want everything to be as normall as possible or else she will feel like she has screwed everyones life up and it wouldn't have been this way if she would have done somethng different or not told anyone at all!  Let the mother and daughter know that you believe them and that you are there for them! If they need you they will come to you!!  Everyone should keep a positive attitude and not make it too dramatic!    I read your question and being the person that was once at the center of the situation I hope that this will help you with understanding what she needs!|`|19sa1ITfaa	kick the boys *** who did it or just drop it im sure the friends DONT WANT ALL THE ATTENTION!!!!!!!! seriously if i where melested i would want KNOW ONE TO KNOW how suckish would it to be if people kept on asking u about it i feel so bad for her|`|ae8823673c3e8e421f769986450c0cd2aa	I do not think that is an age to think about something terrible. You should all guys sit down together in a table and try to orientate the one who did the stupid thing. If you punish the guilty one at that age, he can get confused and do things even worst.  Be a human being before thinking you are a perfect person.  Sorry about my english, I speak Spanish.|`|5ee0364dd7d0159e953e987902e16956aa	Nikki B's answer is so great I thought a thumbs up wasn't enough.    I agree, give the girl space so that she can call the tune, organise the speed she wants to repair, slow or fast. She needs to regain control of her own life.|`|eFxN59SXaa	this is horrible! let your friends know that you are there for support and let them know they need to report him to the police ASAP. your daughter was very smart and must have been raised very well to tell her friend to go to the counselor. I was in a similar situation when I was younger, my friend told me something like that was going on with her, I immediately told my mom, who notified the school and authorities. This guy needs to be punished and you need to make sure you stress to your friends that he can't get away with something like this or he will be doing it to some other child.|`|d9WUbMBmaa	Just let them know that you're there for them anytime they need you and that they can come to you if they need anything. They most likely don't want to talk about it much - let them deal with it in their own way and just support them as much as possible.|`|OMOuxROoaa	it is tough and all you can do is what you are doing....give moral support.|`|8Mhlj4kgaa	your daughter already know the event.Let both of them go together, but not lonely. Give the victim courage to withstand the ill and if possible,councel the boy along with his parents. Soothen your freind that there is always your support. Let the matter be not unnecessarily wdespread.|`|gM4exZNEaa	Support your friends daughter, and your daughter, because it is traumatic for both of them.     Also, put that a sshole in jail! Call the police and get him put away! Its nowhere near as much punishment as he deserves but its something that keeps him away from any other possible victims. That man deserves to rot.|`|ivg0lRUraa	Kill whoever did it..seriously
NWwGl4k6aa	sounds fair to me.  especially if it was his idea|`|DHcEbZKVaa	It sounds like a weird arrangement for two people starting a life together. Will there be consideration in the case that one of you lose your job. What happens when that person uses up their savings, out on the street with them?|`|Yy28UP2aaa	I don't know what the right answer is for the two of you but definitely get it settled so you both feel comfortable before you get married. If you try to split 50/50, the monthly bills, the household repairs,vehicle repairs etc. it can get touchy, especially if one makes more money than the other. How much would you each put in your personal savings every week, who pays for the boat if you both will be using it,who pays for groceries if one of you likes something and the other doesn't? See what I mean. I suggest a joint savings, a joint checking and a separate savings for vacations, toys etc... Both of your names need to be on all accounts though in case something happens to either of you.|`|ma6Re8B1aa	I wouldn't marry anyone that is obviously just looking out for himself!!!!!!!  That's not what a marriage is. I would really think about if you really want to marry this guy. He's someone to keep an eye on at all times!!!!!!!  NOW>> do you want to wast your time on having to watch your back from your husband???? I wouldn't!!!!!|`|jgw1buUAaa	That depends. If you are planning on having a really nice big white wedding, that is going to cost a lot of money. I too am planning a wedding and for the one i want, it's going to cost at LEAST $6,000. So if you are planning on a big wedding, then i would split it 50/50. Put half in the joint account and half into your account. Or better yet, put the money into a CD (certificate of Deposit) and let it earn some interest for awhile until you are ready to get married. Hope this helped!|`|AEPx9H1baa	he wants to keep seperate accounts, so hey that money is urs and it should go into ur account. I dont really understand why he would need you all to have seperate accounts when ur talking about getting married but even if u have seperate accounts, everything is still community property when u get married. Put that money in ur account.|`|7d632fbyaa	well mi opinion is if you place is yours it should go to your account. it's fare. my opinion. but is all up to you. It's like I always said always follow what your heart says. GOOOOOOOOOD LUCK MY FRIEND TAKE CARE|`|b24df69d84b8825cbad6921ea5cc6874aa	Your place   Your money.  Most people that want to have separate accounts really never consider them self to be married, just thought you should know that.  They like to say things like that way I can buy what I want when I want.  They just use that for an excuse to never account for their actions.  They also like to do the guilt game your to demanding, or noisy, or I make it, it's mine, you buy what you want, ect...   Real couples work together & buy things together save together   If he still wants to keep his money, makes me wonder what he is hiding from you.  If he wants a family then it is time to grow up & do just that.|`|lgyPxg26aa	Generally, the money you bring into a marriage is yours if the marriage dissolves, providing you keep it separate from the marital assets.  Your state laws may vary.  So, yes, keep your house sale money in a separate account with only your name on it and do not give him access to that account.    The joint account would then be only for joint bills and you each would put money into that account based on the percentage split you agree on.  If the bills for the month are $2000.00 and you have agreed to a 50/50 split, you each would put $1000.00 into the joint account and then pay those bills from that account.    Many couples have this arrangement.|`|AA10559135	My initial reaction to this was ACK!  but if that's the agreement you both have, then it's your choice, I guess I'm old fashioned.  It actually could work to your benefit in a worse case scenario.  I would say that after the sale of your place, to take a portion of that money and put it towards your new home.  He should be fronting an equal part of his monies.  Whatever joint bills you have together should be paid out of the joint account, and both of you should be putting in equal amounts.  You may consider getting a pre-nup spelling out every detail as money issues can really tear up a marriage if both parties are unclear of the expectations.
BJERgbM5aa	Leave without a word about the cheating.  Just say goodbye.  Be the better person that you are.  Go forward with your life.  And make sure that everyone (including she) sees you moving on.  Soon enough, she will see what she lost.  That's revenge enough.  And you're still smelling like a rose.  Hard to do but can be done.  You can do it too.|`|0a3e8afcef784f7c3fadf1171e01b3e0aa	Leave them. Then concentrate on putting the past behind you and having a happy future.  If you are hell bent on revenge it will eat away at you and you will just end up miserable and unable to move on.|`|lgyPxg26aa	You are never going to be able to hurt your cheating partner as much as your partner has hurt you.    Leave the relationship and find someone who can be with you and only you.|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	Be successful and leave them where they belong, in the gutter !|`|V7grzObHaa	Great question!  I think that if one took revenge on their cheating partner, i.e., gf, bf, wife, or husband, then my question is:  Are they really any better than the one who cheated?  A person cheats because they have very low morals, low self esteem, no loyalty or integrity, the inablility to love, and obviously are very selfish.  That is very low ground to walk on, so why would you want to go down and walk on that low ground with them by taking revenge?  Just take the high road and show them that unlike them you have qualities like: high morals, high self esteem, loyalty and integrity, you know how to love (love does not become provoked) and you are a giving and FOR-giving person......Really isn't that the best revenge possible, when we kill them with kindness.      PS - I did like Beyonce's comment, it was really hilarious!|`|ab2c491e6bca420e2c45c21f91d16208aa	move on, let go and be happy. do all the things you wanted to do and enjoy life. most ex's hate that.|`|BhXOLas1aa	pretend you couldn't care less as you never loved them anyway. You were just using them for sex.|`|Yy28UP2aaa	Completly and totally lock that person out of your life, no discussions about it, nothing!!! Believe me, that will do it.|`|GeruGGOQaa	Leave them.  Move on with your own life.  Live a happy and fulfilled life without them.|`|2Cw0DfaSaa	sleep with hers/his parent      payback is a b!tch|`|dDSuBQURaa	Don't even bother wasting your precious time with a cheater. Do things that would better yourself and your future.|`|y9CgveCGaa	You either leave them or forgive them.  Anything else is a waste of energy.  Seeking revenge might hurt them, but, it won't help you get over it.  Use your energy to move forward by forgiving or moving on.|`|OHydEvTCaa	You don't take revenge on anyone! Let God handle all your situations. Don't pay evil with evil!|`|W8aiAWe2aa	revenge can be sweet.  If you live together then change the locks so he cannot get in.  Put sugar in his car engine.      But the best revenge is to just leave and get yourself a decent fella.|`|tvUAO4ioaa	To move on with you life and show that them they didn't break you. People think revenge is the best medicine, when indifference is usually the most hurtful payback.|`|78c5d650f87826bfbfea0158b5e3884faa	You could just divorce them, cheat on them, kill them (just kidding)...|`|yp3ktx0Caa	death|`|dd1ed523a17927679c4955f404f3e139aa	Lead a better, find a better love, be happy.|`|5WDsdDQ6aa	Leave them...for good.  Not just temporarily, because for some insane reason people think breaking up and getting back together actually works, new flash it doesn't.      So you have to walk away from the relationship and move on with your life without that person.  That's the best way to get back at them, anything else would be childish and they wouldn't take it seriously anyway.  If you stay, they'll just do it again.|`|QVEHBMp3aa	Tell them you contracted a disease.. And they need checking.. The worry is bad enough..    OR say you knew the person they cheated with and you found out he/she had a disease..    =)|`|d5928aef823e729cbef56cb2408fdda4aa	First off, pretend like you don't know that he/she is cheating. Next get a pic or some real proof of that person cheating (kissing another guy or something)    Next throw a party at your house or invite a bunch of people that he/she really likes out to eat somewhere. At some point during the meal say you have a surprise and hand everyone a brown envelope with the information inside. Have them all open it and while they are all in schock tell them how your partner is a cheater. Then walk out!      This way he/she is embarrassed in front of the people he/she cares about and looks like a total idiot in public. Keep in mind, you really need some Balls to do this but the revenge feeling is Top Notch. And beleive me, this person will never live it down.|`|RsJHmJKYaa	call her husband tell him she was cheating and kill 2 birds with 1 stone ....!

Just let it be and watch|`|zAoKd2DBaa	Revenge is a dish best served cold.     Pretend to forgive them, pretend you are going to take them back.     Wait until they feel secure and safe, be as loving as possible to achieve this.    THEN and only then, start to behave very slightly suspiciously, do little things that will unsettle and alarm them.  They'll know the signs, they've been there, they know the lies.  Make them feel how you felt before you found out.  Then choose someone - their friend for example, and seduce them.  Ideally your "partner" should catch you in the act and you will put on the performance of your life.    That ought to show them.     ha ha ha ha ha that's what i'd do.|`|AA10980192	you can also cheat on her.|`|5NKa5Y8laa	The best way?  Two wrongs dont make a right, but they do make an "even"...seduce/sleep with a friend of theirs, and make sure they find out (a friend of mine did that few years ago to her cheating husband.. and it was really childish I know, but very effective).    Personally, I'd just end the relationship. Tell him they can have their plaything, I dont care.  I reckon that might take some of the naughtiness out of his game, when its no longer cheating its not half the fun.|`|T0biNswsaa	The word is justice and|`|JbWGwAFXaa	The best revenge you will ever have on a partner is to - Look Good - Get out and have fun - Move on with your life - Be Happy!!|`|AA11063878	sew all of his boxers together along with placing itching powder inside. then.....place exlax in his coffee, but tape down all the toilet seat lids. afterwards, draw up fake doctor reports stating the progress on his STDs and leave them in places where his other women can find them. after causing said chaos.. move on with your life as quickly as possible, making sure to completely ignore him and come out just fine.|`|dDGKUTT1aa	don't waste your energy ,count yourself lucky and move on,leave the bad vibes behind good luck|`|d43572be4d732509a5fdc4d8b9b9291baa	Leave!|`|AA10348638	Have sex with their best friend..if its a man  you know that they will be very into it|`|4FeJ6B5Faa	The best revenge is to let the cheater go.

Just leave.|`|n5tm4cYHaa	I always imagined this is what I would do if my partner cheated on me...    sell all your partner's possessions away. Take bank book and kids somewhere far and don't tell your partner anything.|`|1IweC4O7aa	Stay married to them. That's probably revenge enough.|`|76Dl0NnGaa	Simply leave them. Revenge is childish and i'm sure you have better more important things to worry about than a cheater.|`|jl2xZGK6aa	move on and dont let him/her know. when they realize n break up with u it wunt hurt u it will hurt them|`|lYZ71zYAaa	Just leave and take everything you can.|`|OkZBNhhgaa	If you're going to forgive them then leaving would be out of the question I suppose but in order to forgive them I'd have to see them suffer a bit first.  For example:  Pepper (Cayenne preferably) in the pants; Dog poo under the door handles of the car (only works if they have their own car); Mashed fish under their mattress / sofa cushions (again only if they live on their own); Sugar in the petrol tank, etc, etc you get the drift.  The saying goes 'Revenge is a dish best served cold' in other words don't go getting your own back straight away or they're going to know it was you!  Wait a few weeks even months then do it.  But remember DO NOT leave any incriminating evidence behind and ALWAYS give yourself an alibi or you could find yourself with a criminal record!|`|orqloVMNaa	revenge is a nasty word. I know from this and I did take revenge but then really I didn't accomplish anything.  I had to learn 2 wrongs don't make a right. As bad as it hurts sometimes its just best to let it be and move on so you can be the better person.

Why would he be bringing them home? He wants you to find them. That's my opinion. I immediately think he is cross dressing, but there could be many other reasons for this.  Maybe he hates the things you sell and would prefer you to wear things that he likes, it could be that simple.  Why not just ask him again why he brought them home?|`|b24df69d84b8825cbad6921ea5cc6874aa	Why the h*ll is he taking sexy underwear to work?  Who is he giving it too?  What is he hiding?

clu2Ia4paa	we have these kind of girls at school i dont like them at all. they think they're hot sh:t but they're only sh:t!!  they are popular in the sense were everybody knows them but not everybody likes them  i think they actually strive for popularity!! they will do anything just to be noticed and get attention. they think if they get attention then they're popular|`|4YFFb2kGaa	Nope,  there isnt actually any girls like that at our school.  See i go to an arts school, im not in arts but its my home school,  i would say that the Arts Drama students are maybe like those girls, everyone hates them but then people also with they where them...|`|gM4exZNEaa	See, its really funny because generally those girls are only nasty because they're really insecure and they take it out on others. I have been told Im pretty and I get a lot of nasty looks in the hallways because either people are scared of me (cause Im tall) or they think automatically that because Im pretty I must be a **** and a mean person. Im not, lol.     There are girls like that at my school. And I know someone who's kind of like that but not really mean... just has about a hundred billion friends, and its just because, as i said, they're insecure. They feel almost worthless if they're not always surrounded by other people. My sisters that way, its kind of sad.|`|1d86ed5e88a024daffb47bccfc5a461baa	You are always going to have those kind of girls. I'm 57 today and I had them when I was in school. Oh yes! The girls everyone loves to hate. But everyone wants to be around. Every generation has them.  I know it's hard to ignore them. But you must try, because they can ruin your life. If you let them. Yes they are fake and they work real hard to be popular. It's a personalty defect, that they think they are all that and yes a big bag of chips. Don't be pulled into that stuff. Do your on thing. I guess the best is people do really see them for who they are. I was not a popular girl in school. In fact we were very poor.And I was made fun of everyday. My mother was the town drunk and ran around with other women's husbands. It's a hurtful thing and kids can be so curial. But you can be above them and better. Be your self and be proud of who you are. Good Luck

There are a lot of good women out there that will love and appreciate you and won't treat you this way.|`|Q2MLikeUaa	So you said yes, maybe she would stop if you would tell her you loved her too, perhaps this is what she is waiting for and she needs the convincing and not you.

NO!    the snow is nice though :)|`|pUvEmPrCaa	Based on all the different answers, you can tell everyone has a different opinion on what's romantic.  You should find out what they think is romantic.  If they don't handle the cold well, I wouldn't recommend it.  Or if they're afraid of being seen by someone or don't really like school too much, I wouldn't recommend it either.      Try to take their personal favorites into mind.  If it's meant to be, romance will just happen.|`|PpYl2dFVaa	do it do it  i would like that if i was young again it is somethng to remember|`|Ku6446uyaa	no|`|dvd19200aa	no just cold|`|oXtWBo9Vaa	school building? Eek. Snow (: yes.|`|679b6c2e3d98d5af9b9c37cd3490d71daa	it sure would and thanks for asking|`|6YTjC3Aqaa	yea it is but what if a teacher saw you|`|SGh5R0rraa	no..... don't do it behind a school building|`|OMOuxROoaa	romantic that is not the meaning of romantic that is just making the first move|`|F1qHLgdtaa	Kinda.   If it is snowing at the time - yes. But if it isnt snowing.. it's just kinda normal, not romantic.|`|yMLGL8APaa	no in my case (in the first place my country dun have snow)|`|TzSrUsvUaa	da 1st kiss is obv. romantic...bt dunt agree wid snow..cuz in winter..lips get chapped n dry u noe....|`|10kHL8SMaa	snow YES but go to the park or something  and sit down...|`|AmfqQLhJaa	i guess that would be|`|yA8sw0bOaa	i guess in my opion it's not something i would want a boy to do but you might end up in the bed with that boy .|`|034289d2e5f2ba9ddcddc9d244cfea7eaa	I hope alone here means boy and girl (behind the scenes).    People should talk about how they feel about each other. When one feels that pang of passion, they should tell their partners.    Animals use instincts but people should state how they feel to their partners. Then they must appoint for further review of their feelings and motives.    So, just kissing without knowing what you are doing is just meaningless!!|`|GgKpHMixaa	No,not at school it wouldn't|`|0PWnOjILaa	yes without the SCHOOL!!!! the snow would be soo cute!!! it is the truth!!:)

NOT READY also means NO.   Once a person (male or female) says NO, back off.   Pushing it at this point will classify you as a borderline stalker.   Accept defeat and move on.|`|pXp6tYLmaa	uhm if hes   "just not ready"   he probably isnt  that into you   or hes seeing if there is other girlfriend material out there   before he goes out with you.    found that out from reading the book "hes just not that into you"|`|YNdc7sTNaa	. . .make him miss you., if he really likes you, he will be the first to come back and make the move.,
PBdPD748aa	i would personally start with a letter... it has been sooo long and its important you do your best not to get things to an awkward start! Maybe tell her that you have found her, how happy you are and how much you are wanting to start a relationship with her. Give her your number and ask her to call you when she is able and ready. I think that would be a really thoughful thing to do, so you leave the ultimate choice up to her - but saying how much you cant wait to hear from her, just so she will feel a little more comfort whilst talking to you on the phone for the first time :)    All the best to you, this must be sooo exciting! You do what you think is right, if you would prefer to call - do it! What i said is my opinion only.    Good luck!|`|T0biNswsaa	Well, to start with, I'd never trust a single word she has to say.|`|yDNv30Okaa	phone her.|`|n0MxemfYaa	Via the umbilical cord I believe.|`|WOHc22Xiaa	Call her and then go see her. I know it may be a little awkward at first but shes your mommy. Good luck!|`|vF1ZgvxTaa	Couple of months ago i was in the same situation with my Real Father. i know if i phone he would deffo answer however i know i would go totally brain dead and wouldn't know what to say  So i wrote a letter which had everything in it that i wanted to say. which h i felt pleased about but the thing is...he hasn't replied so now i do not know weather he has received it or not or just not replying. and it's is really scary phoning but in the end i Phone. Yeah i totally broke down but i said what i wanted to say, because i had little notes beside me to let me remember what i wanted to say.      Hope it helped because it's really not nice in this situation
yiRatTLtaa	First of all this is something only you should know .If he would cheat on you or not .And since you asked for honesty and I am always honest, then I should probably tell you that . having the thought that I do not know anything more than just what the text depicts , then ....When I read it it HONESTLY gave me the impression that  you do not mean very much to him if it's been THIS long and he still didn't tell her.You have to have a very SERIOUS talk with him and make it crystal clear that you are not going to take this anymore and you are NOT just his mantle for bad weather ,.! ! !  But his GIRLFRIEND an  you deserve to have that TITLE in his life and not just hiding all the time >! If he loves you then  he will LISTEN and APPLY what you asked him.Tell him that this thing with his ''co-worker'' has to stop or else  it's OVER.I know it might be difficult but....It needs to be done ! He  displayed and is still displaying  a total lack of respect towards you.And has SOME SERIOUS ISSUES.that need to be dealt with !! ! Good luck and if he won't get it then he doesn't know what a girl he is MISSING ,since you wrote here asking for opinions about it it means you love him a lot.How do  the people who read this feel about this situation?Well , I don't know about the others but It DISTURBS me !..When you love someone ( and even if it will sound like a cliche) You go through ANYTHING to make it right...Think about that...and since you asked for honesty in the answers , when you will think of this be honest with YOURSELF too...|`|kpW7Jyb2aa	Your out of school, so it's legal now. He needs to tell her or you need to break up with him. Them going on a trip like that without her knowing about you is just wrong.    You need to talk to him about this. Let him know how you feel.|`|fca3b6ac45b683b2c3cb75b6bfcba848aa	........jus tell him that he have to tell his co worker abt all this.....coz u cant stand that.......if hes true hell definately do that else no
QC94lBXOaa	Take his dirty dishes, his dirty laundry and any trash that he is supposed to take out and dump it in the middle of his bed.  Tell him that if he doesn't want to do any washing up that's his business, but since the kitchen, lounge and bathroom are common areas he CANNOT keep his mess there. I would take any rotten food that beongs to him and dump it in there as well.   Then, you and your other flatmate write up a notice that says "Effective immediately: you will be billed for any time we spend cleaning up your mess.""   Another option you have is to take anything of his that he leaves in a common area and throw it away, or donate it to charity. When he asks where it is, you simply say "I don't know...where did you leave it?"  Eventually he'll get sick of losing his stuff.|`|FzFSzilmaa	dump his stuff in his room and tell him to do his fair share!!!|`|QVEHBMp3aa	Find a new roomie BEFORE you kick him out is one option.    Or alternatively, hide some of his important stuff, and blame his mess.. Should sort him out|`|12Aifvf4aa	You could put all the mess he produces either in his bed or in his room!  I shared a room with a girl who never tidied up. I used duct tape and said she could do what she liked on her side, anything that strayed over the line it would go in the bin. She soon got the message!|`|rpqHLJGGaa	Take pics of his mess & print off posters with WANTED for crimes against hygiene|`|zon13nY2aa	My bf has 2 housemates and they are the dirtiest pigs ever. They don't lift a finger. They keep their bedrooms tidy but the kitchen, bathroom and living room never get done!    My bf has been reduced to making a rota for the cleaning and they think it's a joke. He's giving them 1 week to get their act together, if not he's hiring a cleaner and adding the money onto their rent.    We take some comfort thinking that soon I will be moving in and they will be given their notice to find somewhere else!|`|8PO93dFZaa	tell himmmmm sit him down and say its not a joke|`|RoEyFm5yaa	TELL HIM THAT YOU ARE SERIOUS ABOUT HIM HELPING TO KEEP THE FLAT CLEAN.SAY THAT YOU ALL NEED TO CLEAN UP AFTER YOURSELVES.IT WOULD BE A GOOD TIME TO BRING UP THE NOISE SITUATION ALSO.TELL HIM THAT HE NEEDS TO RESPECT YOU BOTH. IF HE CAN'T,THEN YOU KNOW SOMEONE ELSE WHO WILL TAKE OVER THE ROOM.|`|GvgmSxdCaa	Wait until he goes out have the locks changed and throw all his clothes out on the garden.|`|4qT0TfMZaa	You can do nothing - he's got you wrapped around his finger.    Grow up and throw him out or live with the pig.  There are plenty of people who'd gladly take his place.    Tell me - what would you do if he refused to pay his share of the rent?  The answer is your answer...|`|wGw834Gkaa	Put a dead cat in his room.  Hide it well enough and he'll have to clean his room to find it.  I once hid an Easter egg in my brother's closet.  I forgot about it until the next July.  Didn't take long to get in there and find the freaking thing.|`|e5f4c192231c92a0d059825b151f7553aa	You can a couple of things.    - keep on not cleaning his stuff. Clean your own and lock it away for your own use (and maybe some friends).   - make noise when he is sleeping (a vacuum cleaner is effective!)   - quietly : Try and find another flatmate, or see if you can move elsewhere - dont tell the messy one.    If there is an owner to the building, maybe he/she can help you?  You could consider also to get him to pay more. After all, he wants you to clean - well, fine - but then he`d better pay for the service.  An extra $50 a week ought to initially cover the services. (For housecleaning and dishes - don`t do the laundry for him!)    But, best thing really would be to find a cleaner replacement.|`|BLTq0vLWaa	Had a similar issue a few years ago, as already said by a fair few one here, just shoved all the crap left around in his room. Anything of his worth anything he left around we used it for ourselves    And If he left his pots/pans to be cleaned up we just left them until they stacked up to a ridiculously high level.    He got quite annoyed for awhile then realised If he cleaned up after himself we'd stop, took him a little while but he figured it eventually.
znjl6WrWaa	First I would talk to your mother to find out what happened between her and your father. maybe she never told him that you existed. If he did know did he pay child support? If you want to get to know your father you need to find out what happened first and the whole situation. Also you can't expect to be welcomed with open arms after 23 years. Maybe he didn't tell his wife about you and she thought you were some prank call (really possible if he didn't know you existed or wasn't part of your life at all).     I had a older sister come into my life when I was 12. I never knew she existed. she was from my father's first marriage and he wasn't part of her life. She just called up our house one day asked who I was and said "I'm your sister!". talk about shocked Lil so do some investigating and then ease yourself a little more in their life. Your stepmom might not be jealous-she could just be in shock (or think you're lying)|`|kpW7Jyb2aa	Does it honestly matter? I hate to be cruel but get over it.    There are thousands of people that go through life without a father. It doesn't make you less of a person because he left. It's his loss not yours. Forget him. He didn't want to be apart of your life, then **** him. He isn't there so he doesn't get to stake any claim in your progress.    Why he left doesn't matter. The only thing that does is that he wasn't there.|`|AA10986891	U think that due to the way things ended your dad was afraid to contact you. He feared that he would get the same response you got from his current wife form your mom when ever he attempted to contact you.    Try contacting him again and before you judge him get his side of the story.|`|FzFSzilmaa	maybe she drove him away... you only have her side of the story... and she may NEVER tell you the real truth...|`|eT9cRbgFaa	maybe she never told your father, your father could not know you exist!!!!  his current partner probally feels threatened and doesnt want you intruding in their happy home!     maybe your father was too young to hold that resposibility.. there is no excuse... i have a half sister somewhere that my father never tried to contact.. so i really have no explanation... maybe try calling when his home alone, or make an excuse like you calling from the fone company to get to talk to him, then tell him, i am your daughter and i wanna know why you refuse to talk to me!!!!!!!!!    if he lets you down... well. you made it this far with out him! :)|`|B6mzmKFpaa	It sounds like your question is not related to the real case of what had happened for your father to "abandon" you. The real answer will be discovered when you contact your father directly.   Men and women were meant to become couples, the fact your father had another child 6+ yr. later shows a possibility of proper behaviour.
10kHL8SMaa	:) U DEFINATLY HAVE A CHANCE!!!!!!! She's being all like thanks so much for being a friend and all you should try and aske her out. Then ask if she wants to be ur gf if she says no now you'll never have a chance anyway. She is close to you and trusts you so she'll be your girlfriend. Or so I think...|`|nKwcGLQraa	im drowning in all the cheese.    yes, you might still aheva  chance though.|`|ZUw8DBJVaa	honestly? stuck in the friend zone...that is what i tell my best friend, NOT my boy friend... sorry:/...|`|N6z3R9pCaa	you still have a chance.|`|a0ba9a8354b58d576f00709d3e7d9584aa	you still have a chance, but you should hint that you're looking for more than a friendship while you have the opportunity. ;)    hope i helped    ?|`|YFXusnT1aa	Sorry dude this is a friend zone moment|`|8d220f500762c84b66042158d9d97babaa	As a girl (good god, woman at this age!) I would only say this if I only wanted to be friends. We are so sneaky and disgustingly sappy with our words. I think it's in our DNA. - SORRY!|`|40xAVBblaa	you could possibly still have a chance   just give it some time   good luck|`|oXtWBo9Vaa	Still might be a chance (:|`|K1xbosX9aa	I think you have a chance, maybe tell her how you feel about her. But keep in mind that she may only like you as a friend, so also let her know that you will always be there as a friend for her!|`|PpYl2dFVaa	this might sound confusing but women are confusing trust me i am one    but she is throwing that out there to you to see your response to see if SHE is in the friend zone    i hope that makes sense
3WCONjyfaa	Yes and it is freakin hard to get over it. Just be a friend to him and if he breaks up with that person, you'll be there to comfort him|`|NDnnUcP9aa	take one night out of the week [prefferably friday]  and drown yourself in chocolate icecream:D  .....just make shure you hit the treadmill first thing the next day lolol :]      works for me every time rotf    and sprinting on the treadmill always seems to make me less angry if you think about how much you hate that other chick thats mackn' on the guy you like, then run faster lololololololol    idk why it just makes you feel better|`|sFKgWed0aa	If its True Love no body can stop it. We all sail in the same leaking boat. Few reach there destiny.|`|oiyugIE0aa	Oh yess........and not very well...I wasn't that happy till I did not like em anymore...I had a lot of icecream and choocolate  :) the good stuff|`|0PVOkUtcaa	ya,kind of.it happens to lots of pple but you beat it up and move on with your life.|`|IRUsj3h5aa	Yeah. i kinda tried to break them up but if that didn't work. i moved on. theres more fish in the sea. *wink.  lol|`|svkqdHTAaa	there's is a whole lot of difference between love and lust, infatuation and the likes.    so i guess u should find out if it's not lust and the likes.    but if it is love u need to be very careful....and be patient, take it easy, dont explode.    another thing is if the person likes u too.    dont go hurting someone or urself. u can control ur feelings till the coast is clear.|`|qy07K2k5aa	Yes, I have.|`|nfGDZWfBaa	Yes I have i just stopped going where he was, and answering his phone messages and texs. then Eventually I was over him and did what was right for me.|`|PpYl2dFVaa	YEAH   those things u just get over try to find someone else
y5i8GIFWaa	well.......since you have the kids   you should be the one getting more money from him as children can be hard work!  trust me i have been through this,anyway- you have more right then he does and your almost a single mother with children- the income of 1 isn't enough. u need that money to support the children' s future and pay the bills. remember if the income is less then the outcome     you will then end up in a wakky situation! so go on girl  fight the facts and kick his ***- get what you and your children need. a future and a roof to live under !  good luck x|`|kbIkVS0raa	I personally think it is fair to rotate years of claiming the kids. Yes I think it is fair to split it this year. They are his kids too and if he is paying child support he should get some tax money|`|UgcPxd4maa	If you have the kids, you get the money for them. Obviously you would be filing seperatly because you don't live together.
gSwobfujaa	no i have not. the guys i dated before were complete douch-bags. even if someone paid me i wouldnt get back with them. the thought alone gets me nauseous. there is only ONE guy who wasnt officially my boyfriend who i would probably hang out with again. as dumb as it would be for me to do that. but im in a committed relationship that i hope lasts forever. and if thats the case--i wont have to make that dumb choice. the guy im with is a keeper. i love him to death. and if we ever split up -god forbid- i would hope we met again in future years. i truly do love this man. :-)|`|jnG8sOzWaa	no way|`|IPS3hWweaa	Yeah, I got back together with an ex, it had been like nearly 5 years since the first time we were together. Of course it didn't last, just like the first time. Sometimes it just isn't meant to be, no matter how bad you would like it to.
083e9846706988570511a5b3e605f74aaa	u can't relate to anything that she's going through. u dont know what it's like to loose something that huge. i was only able to relate to my sister having a miscarriage because @ this point i cant have any kids...so it was easier for me to understand how it felt...the only thing you can do is be there for her. let her talk to you and just tell her your sorry and that you'll always be there for her no matter what.|`|hEcKmleVaa	You just can't relate to this kind of sadness.  I believe you love your sister and all you have to say to her is:  "I am so sorry."|`|4ZktwobSaa	just tell her ur sorry|`|52e7jxDjaa	Well the fact that you feel bad and are asking this question shows that you do care! Even if it is subconscious, you are feeling something, otherwise you wouldn't have asked this question.    Just tell your sister that you are there for her and how much you love her. She needs to hear that. And you said that you love her a lot so you aren't anti-social or anything (don't feel emotions/sympathy or guilt).   Having a miscarriage can be a very difficult thing to handle and  knowing that the people you love, and love you most, is one of the best things to help get through it.  Let your sister know that you are there for her and how much you love her.   Even if you aren't sure how to respond, she still needs you.   Plus, just because you aren't feeling the emotions that you THINK you should be feeling, that doesn't mean that there is anything wrong with you. You just aren't sure how to respond with such a emotional and scary situation.  Hope I helped.  ---  Wonkybubbles
W0b2oqZvaa	i think you've discovered love at first sight and you should really tell her how you feel! best of luck|`|1GxMGmkqaa	are you soul mates? or more than that? are you twin flames? think about it.... what was it that turned you on? what were your first thoughts? and what did they relate to? and why? where in your past, future or past life/lives? was it transcendental or was it lust? ooohhh! you sound sooo hoootttt!!! and cute and what a lucky girl she is... !!!!   ;0)   xxx|`|TTaLB4kdaa	You should go talk to her. Maybe it's a freaky soul mate thing|`|M0KLWw54aa	do you know where is this girl?|`|A0IvDqsGaa	do you know this girl....have you seen her since that day? If yes, then you definitely need to talk to this girl. There is obviously a reason...its probably like a soul mate thing. Either that or she was just, like you said the most beautiful woman you have ever seen and people usually don't forget things like that. You need to somehow find her. Not really sure how, but somehow.|`|4b5IQWcFaa	find her  tell her how you feeel        true love's in the air!|`|F1qHLgdtaa	AWW! This is adorable! ... Obviously theres a natural connection!  Find her! lol|`|biWsavtUaa	you should try the Missed Connections area of Craigslist.com|`|AA11043633	One reason is because it's an unfinished business.  Probably, if you did went to her before and talked to her it wouldn't happen.|`|034289d2e5f2ba9ddcddc9d244cfea7eaa	People do meet complete strangers and immediately fall in love even without knowing who they are and where they come from?    This is just normal and its called love at first sight.    Love at first sight is an emotional condition whereby a person feels romantic attraction for a stranger on the first encounter with the stranger. The term may be used to refer to a mere sexual attraction or crush, but it usually refers to actually falling in love with someone literally the very first time one sees him or her, along with the deep desire to have an intimate relationship with that person. The stranger may or may not be aware that the other person has any such notion, and may not even be aware of the other person's presence (such as in a crowded place).     Sometimes two people experience this phenomenon towards each other at the same time, usually when their eyes meet.     You need to follow your heart and target this person until you appoint to meet somewhere where you can express yourself.    She however, can not guess how you feel about her until you tell her.Please be bold enough to tell her.    Good luck.

7eDqrQ5waa	of course, our friends do hate us, but their is always a reason for every thing  you should talk to hr and ask her the problem  if she really doesn't want to hang up with you then, contributing something is a good idea but i would have been better if you've decided to talk to her and visit her  she would have a reason and she would surely explain it to you  but, if she lost her temper and got angry  you should be calm if you really want to solve the problem  remember, every problem can be solve in a good conversation and without any lost of temper  just remember again, talk to her and tell her the things yu can do to help her
vDjy1eKDaa	go to a bar or a club..a bar would be great since ur 25. If theres a singles lounge around u, thats good too.|`|9fDkrrFyaa	1. Go to the park, you can take a run there, exercise, read a book at the same time scope the area to see available people (guys) doing the same. Do not rush into anything though, there are creeps lurking everywhere too.    2. Parties are great places to meet people, so are concerts and even the movies.|`|4xtJjPzyaa	If you believe in "fate" then ok do nothing maybe you will meet someone one day.  If you believe in "chance" then just practice being more social   with every guy you meet. Clubs you usually find seedy weird men   bars at times arent much of a luck either.   Try speed dating? It's brief but gives you a heap of options?|`|Bsf78pfsaa	I think that on line there are those fakes but there are some true guys out there or maybe hang out more|`|Midbg5BJaa	Ok, I keep trying to help, but you ain't listening ;)    Network, flirt at work, use you friends to meet their friends and look at other clubs. I took a work colleague with me to the climbing centre last week, she came away with three phone numbers! She now has three dates lined up to work out which one's best!    Good luck, but the moment you stop looking, one will come along, I promise ;)|`|Ff7VS8lQaa	Try doing some voluntary work, eg working for a local charity.|`|QqY8YgGDaa	It is natural that online did not work. Now what you can do is ,just make a list of your hobbies ,your good characters, your bad characters .You should also make a  list of the good  characters you are expecting in your guy. You should also make a list of bad characters you are not at all ready to tolerate in that guy. Similarly you should also make a list of bad characters you are ready to  tolerate in your guy, this is because these days, there may not be perfect guys if you are not at all ready to tolerate any bad characters, therefore it is the only choice to select a guy if he is not having unhealthy bad habits, even though he is not a 100%perfect guy. Then you should make a list of  bad qualities in  you, which you cannot stop, so ,your guy has to tolerate them , the problem with only that  solution .Do you want a very fashionable guy or are you ready to accept a guy with all other good qualities ,if he is not a fashionable one, what is the range of age limit  that guy should be within-answer to these questions  will be decisive .   If you prepare that list ,then the remaining things are easy. I can talk with my friends and relatives and tell about your good and bad. Whoever  interested may write  e  mails to you ,for that purpose you can create a separate  new e mail which will not reveal yur real name ,does not contain your bank correspondence etc.. so that you cannot get any problems from  these  guys. When I was studying  the very difficult college degree(Every semester I failed one or two subject ,it was so much difficult) I had friends with different characters. I can inform to them about you.

You will be pleasantly surprised at what you find there.|`|219329c2d061de50a947e339dc81b386aa	hahaha younger guys tend to just play around on online dating, we don't really take it seriously because it's too indirect and all we see of you are pictures. I just meet people at friend's parties or at clubs. Might be a bit difficult at first because you've been outta the game for a while, so start low by just introducing yourself to strangers that catch your eye.|`|bDzshhYiaa	you sound like a really smart lady.  You should find somebody with a degree like yours.  Maybe some of your  colleagues and college friends.  This is a new century now and girls do ask guys out. don't wait for the guys to ask you out.you could find yourself a nice church no promises that you will meet a nice guy there.  But what are your odds in a bar.  Anyways don't rush to there's a lot of fish in the sea is just finding the right one take your time sweetheart you'll catch one soon I promise your friend Tom|`|BFfP8IYkaa	when and where you least expect it. Stop looking!! It will come to you.|`|92n13q98aa	Meet guys at work, the bar, when you're out with your friends, etc.. You know, all the traditional places before the internet.. You know people used to meet each other before the internet existed, right? :)|`|5TPdNsCnaa	hi yeah you are right....never do online dating...it sucks i have had my heart totally broken becuase of it...its not the best place to meet someone.....try going out to bars with your friends or take up a hobby|`|xTDTlBLIaa	join a club, group or organization that your into and start hitting on some guys..or go back to school or something|`|mgcW9fWXaa	Have you tried speed dating or singles parties.

Wk4k7Q5Qaa	All you can do is Love him and let him know and the rest is up to him.  You can make him love you anymore then he wants to.. Don't try to get out of him which he can not give, because he will just resent you for it, which will make things worse.   Like the old saying goes "You can't get blood from a stone." If you feel He is short changing you then maybe he isn't the right one.for you.|`|e2J4r10Raa	You can't do that, there is no way for you to control his feelings. If he ends up not loving you anymore and wants to leave there is nothing you can do. But if he ever does want to leave you can talk to him and try to understand why he wants to leave you.|`|Yl1xgb7oaa	you can't make anyone love you.    the most you can do is treat him well and just be yourself.|`|RYARNa8Qaa	2 points!|`|8d220f500762c84b66042158d9d97babaa	You sound like a controlling, crazy, stalker type.|`|d861778018432f5f26321e9fa06ec7faaa	I like it when ladies kiss me on my ears. try that :)|`|KFvfXx2faa	you cant keep control on someone like that..just be yourself|`|e3AnmkfUaa	You can't make someone love you, all you can do is be loving and lovable.|`|TsyNx5Xmaa	Good luck with that. Everyone on here could give you tons of advice, but that doesn't mean it's going to work. Life is unexpected and you shouldn't try to control things like that. If it's meant to be....it will be! Don't stress about it, that's what's going to make it NOT work out! Everyone has their ups and downs in relationships....there is NO way to the bottom of a man's heart or any way to keep him from NEVER doing something. Just think positive!|`|AA12123894	You cant make someone love you.A relationship has to be 50/50 or it probably wont last.  If you have to force him to love you,you might as well forget it.|`|4b5IQWcFaa	be yourself............  be what you wanna be    no flattering or flirting|`|PpYl2dFVaa	send me the answer when u get it|`|yA8sw0bOaa	find something that you both like to do or do what he likes to do plan trips vacations.try to do something different everyday thats how i keep mine but make sure you know to keep him on lockdown but not to tight cause then you would run him away keep you man girlfriend|`|qCLWNLCIaa	The quickest way to lose him is by showing how desperate you are to keep him.  Relaxing and being yourself is the logical way. Yes, it sounds cliche... but absolutely true.  Besides, do you want him to like YOU or to like a version you've created because you think it's what he wants?  Plus the biggest mistake young girls make is to focus on how much the guy likes them, not on how much they like the guy.  Stop worrying about whether he'll leave, and start thinking about whether he's good enough for you! Trust me; the moment you flip that switch in your brain... he'll be there for the long run. You, on the other hand, may not!|`|3c9Z6nvFaa	You can't control someones intimate feelings really. Just be the best girlfriend you can be. Show him that he comes first. That's what love is really all about: the other person coming first.
ApSWv6Otaa	you bimbo do you want to look like a whore?!?!?! that is one way to make people either A) look down upon you or B) look farther down upon you. Do you not know how dirty a hot tube is? You can get so many infections it is so gross.|`|lFPsPzxzaa	yes tell them unless u clean it before they come over|`|A0IvDqsGaa	ummmm....no you shouldn't. Why would you?|`|OlKXuKaCaa	I think you give your guests the option of knowing it. I would of been pissed if I went onto the hot tub and then found out that you were fornicating in it beforehand.|`|zJS00hvTaa	That all depends on the type of person you know your dealing with, how well do you know them(because you know if they know you, then they already know,lol). if you dont know em too well, you don't have to tell them anything, as long as you keep it clean an no one will get sick,then who cares,right?|`|r1D9P4Vyaa	As a certified Pool/spa operator, I would say no IF, you keep the Bromine levels at around 4-6. if it is less then that, that is when germs can just be floating around in there and sensitive skin can be effected, rashes, hives ect. A question for me is how offen do you shock the tub? (bring the Bromie level over 10 for a day, don`t use at 10+) shocking your tub will kill everything in there and clears the water too.I hope this will help your answer. Good luke!|`|JLayHNZCaa	Don't tell them unless you have diseases or your dates do.  But you should clean the hot tub before you let them into it after your latest escapade.|`|qy07K2k5aa	No, you shouldn't.|`|oRzqWhsDaa	no you shouldnt|`|BHeBSGemaa	Haha no, don't tell them|`|nDQOwAA3aa	only if you want to brag|`|Ub1KbPvDaa	Well how often do you actually clean it?  I think I would want to know...|`|gIaQ7Y4oaa	No, it'll be funny.|`|IzsGakLRaa	Why would you offer that information to anyone unless you want them to think you're a total skank!|`|luQ326QOaa	depends if you want to have sex with them too....|`|FzFSzilmaa	yes, you might get more offers... :D
UgcPxd4maa	talk to your mother and remind her that you are her kid, not those boys, and you would like to be treated with the same respect she is giving them.|`|rvSrjNeQaa	Better to talk to your mother first !!|`|zY64xc6xaa	No one can take advantage of you without you letting them.  Take yourself out of their unfair employment and get another job.
219329c2d061de50a947e339dc81b386aa	Bah, from a guy's point of view, this is annoying depending on how much you hold back because you make us feel like we haven't done enough / done something wrong.|`|BRMKkAXqaa	yep|`|A0IvDqsGaa	You have no idea. I am in love w/my best guy friend but i am too afraid to tell him because i don't know what he will think. Like i said he is my best friend so we do everything, just minus the actual kissing and making out part. It is very hard to not tell him how i feel, and it breaks my heart not to. But he has a gf and i don't know how he will take it. So i just keep my mouth shut.|`|sFKgWed0aa	True Love never waits for time.|`|fqgSkbBiaa	yes, i do.  if it's not a right time, then it's better to keep it all inside of me.   :)|`|fRX4GxUhaa	With my ex, oh god yes, but if he wanted to be mine, he would be, there is no beating about the bush, if you really want someone you give yourself to them, and its the same in reverse i'm afraid|`|qy07K2k5aa	I don't, because I have never like a "him".
dDasUgW8aa	When I was younger, yes, but as I got older and realized what friendship should be, I stopped being manipulated.|`|6MHuI3NXaa	honestly, yes.|`|kLK2peV1aa	if it has to do with sex, yes.|`|vgXGNAuCaa	no im not actually|`|79eBn6V8aa	I was when I was a teenager...but as an adult, no not at all...Like most adults, I realize that it's best to just be yourself and not worry so much about what anyone else thinks....you will have true friends who love you for who you are.  Nobody likes a fake or a phony.|`|8Mhlj4kgaa	Yes, if ultimate satisfaction is expected.|`|hoBREUGLaa	No because I just whip it out!|`|wGw834Gkaa	When you have enough self-confidence to trust your own judgement then this stuff doesn't happen.  And good friends won't do this to you on purpose.|`|mqxEw2daaa	No, I manipulate them though|`|aoBg9jMZaa	no|`|a7364c50b7e6712ee3c77218a3232b45aa	Just need to check on that - will get back to you.
1d86ed5e88a024daffb47bccfc5a461baa	Never ever give your morals to the back seat. That's when mistakes happen. And we normally regret it the next day. If your friends are trying to make you do that. You have to be the bigger person and stick to you morals. It will pay off in the long run. And you will be remembered for keeping your morals. I told my daughter many times to think about the situation first. You did that by asking for a opinion.  Don't feel pressured Good Luck|`|PyV1R4Xzaa	My morals are mine irrespective of who I'm with - If they change depending where I am or who I'm with then the're not morals.|`|ZA11WBR2aa	Sometimes|`|U4V6TkZEaa	If they are real friends, then you shouldn't have to.|`|NOeCoN59aa	Sometimes|`|5pgVIlLFaa	Never, if they don't accept me for who I am  then they are not really my friends.|`|nDQOwAA3aa	my morals always take the back seat you gotta do what makes you happy|`|OQdPzl15aa	When I was a teen, I would say it depended on the friend.  Now, as an adult, I don't hang around those that would want me to compromise on my morals.  A real friend loves the real you, and won't put you in a situation where you have to choose friendship over your values.|`|9a734c12c8a5bcbcb7f973ccdc4ed0eaaa	"morals" what means this word? is that those teeth in the back of your mouth    hehehe|`|TqLPR72Daa	Nope|`|dkZW4zMNaa	I would have to say never. I feel that if I say I am one way, then portray myself another way around certain people, I am being hypocritical. Morals are an issue of mind over matter. Even if my friends don't mind the way I act, it still matters to me. :]
kpW7Jyb2aa	It's been 9 months for me.    I'd prefer at the least once every other day, but ideally everyday.    And no I don't get sex as often as I'd like, but i'm a patient kind of guy.|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	Believe it or not, I am about the same as you, lol. It sucks! You just ruined my day, lol. Just kidding.|`|fFpa0rz9aa	a ******* while|`|Midbg5BJaa	Last week    No    5-7 times a week.|`|AdeD0xMuaa	I am 25...had it last night. I would prefer twice a day.    I am assuming you're single right now...I hardly had any sex for a year until I met my new man!|`|w2WFDunnaa	NO   NO   AND NO    I'm not over 21 and i'm not having sex until after marriage!  thanks for the two points =]    PEACE ^_^v|`|FzFSzilmaa	last night... :D  no... :(  2-3 times a day!!!|`|GVlzdZKsaa	Every hours until I got blisters on my hand.|`|JOQJwcR6aa	For me it's been to long i haven't had sex for 3 and some years ....not dating anyone right now...no i don't if i could find the right clean and tested person i really think i would everyday as much as i could but hell i might just be talking because i'm horny as hell....LMAO|`|YjRkpIG4aa	Yesterday, and why is this limited to over the age of 21?|`|xYgFcEfwaa	2 weeks ago  twice in a month..  not too horny like other dirty people.|`|EJYp5fIcaa	i had sex on tuesday, i would like sex a bit more often. me and my bf used to do it nearly everyday (except when im on my period) but atm my bfs job is stressful so hes not in the mood as much or too tired!! :( hopefully that should change next week when the busy season of his job has ended! :)|`|0orskWGbaa	eeerrr ??????   never lol XD!!!! im not over 21 but its an open question SO HAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

LOL  Call me, let help each other out then.
e37b1e55a5a94cf30d038c8a0dd1c521aa	yeah i think that was a little over board ( saying that the baby momma will be more important than the person he is dating ) i mean it is okay to say that obout the kid but not the baby momma. I am also in a current situation with someone that has kids but till this day i am the one to tell him to make sure he ALWAYS take care of his kids no matter what i or anyone else says or thinks. Kids should always come first .....    Good luck to you on that ~|`|d5KjFHwkaa	OMG i just got out of this mess. My ex has 2 babies, one, i was there for the birth. We were best friends long before we started dating. Baby Momma drama is the worst thing ever. She tried to put me on the papers saying his new girlfriend couldnt see the kids, because it "might confuse them" We lived together, so he had to sneak to bring them over. And all the late night phone calls, when she would call crying because she missed him. It was the most stressful, ridiculous, situation I have ever been in. Hugs on the holidays, him being nice, his excuse was, I have to be nice, or she wont let me see them. Wtf ever. It was court ordered that he had visitation. However he treated her, has nothing to do with seeing his kids. I totally feel you.|`|Gx14PIvxaa	Of course that person is always "important" as the mother of your child, but that sure won't get far with many women as a new relationship prospect. Who would say that??|`|FzFSzilmaa	the child is most important... and the person who is their primary carer should be very important too... if you can't accept coming 3rd in his life, then don't date someone with a child!!! :D|`|AA11632353	naw honey...u need to let him know he aint bout to treat u lyke no tissue,hes basicly using you to just be with him why his baby moma wont...screw him show him ur not the one to play with...your not the one who needs him...and until u make sure he knows that...hes going to continue to treat you like crap|`|5BKHud3baa	WOW!    Do you have kids? Either you trust your guy or you don't. To me it seems he is a good guy and one Who appreciates the person who cares for his child.|`|gBnOqY5Yaa	That would be a total slap in the face.  I would call that the end of my relationship with that person.  It's OK for the KID to be more important, but I would have to be   2 on the list.  Just be pleasant around each other and no hugging is necessary.|`|YmLezz03aa	yes i would agree, but you cant change the fact that he/she had a baby with someone before he/she came along.      i'm like DR. PHIL only i'm not a dill-weed|`|Hub1UGqPaa	He's letting you know where you stand.  In other words - deal with it - you're 3rd.      Don't try to get in the middle of a relationship that is already established between the Mom, the kid and the Dad.  Obviously it works for them - and their main importance is their child - as it should be.     Without even looking - those who have never had a kid or have a screwed up relationship with their baby daddy will tell you how horrible it is and you should dump him....that's exactly what he's telling you too; but for different reasons.  If you can't appreciate the fact that he values the relationship between his kid, and his childs mother....then you need to back out of the relationship.  That's not to say that he won't love you more than his childs mother some day - but he focuses on maintaining the relationship already established.      *EDIT*   You didn't 'mention' they were hugging and crap.  We can only go on the information you give us. Obviously you're not getting the answers you're wanting but the funny thing is - you're still not going to change his situation.  He's in that relationship with her and obviously doesn't plan on changing it.|`|hKZ5dRbSaa	I would actually feel hurt. But at the same time understand. Because the childs real mother is more important. And Tbh, I would never put myself in a relationship with someone who has kids allready.|`|mwv79AIhaa	i got that baby momma drama, but my daughter is the only important thing that came outta that..she did me dirty and knows i could never forgive her for it.    my daughter came out with all the love in that chapter.
iPNOVR6Gaa	If you want to go, then just go and stop the analyzing.  He already said yeah.  You could just take him at his word, because he would not have said yeah if he was strongly opposed to you going.  He was trying to be nice, but you wouldn't let him - you decided you needed to force him to reveal that he didn't really want you to come.  And again, he tried to be nice, by telling you the excuse that you'd be bored, and once again, you're not letting him be nice.  Do you really want the truth?  Do you really want to force him to say, "I just think I'd have more fun with my buddies if you weren't there."?      If you want to go, go.  You are certainly within your rights as a wife to go with your husband.  However, you'd be doing him a small favor if you graciously declined to go.  So which is more important to you, going to a motorcycle rally, or doing your husband a favor?|`|4PK0hiWeaa	Give him some guy time, we need that.|`|yNbGq4viaa	Every man (and woman for that matter) needs some alone time.  If all or most of his friends are single and aren't bringing anyone then your husband would probably feel like a schmuck dragging his wife along with him.  Maybe the other guys will have a hard time doing the drinking, groin scratching, smack talking thing around you and would be more comfortable and have a better time without you there.  Basically, it boils down to a matter of trust.  If you trust your husband then get over your insecurities and let the man have some time with his friends.  If you don't trust him then you don't need to be in the relationship as you will constantly be second guessing him and yourself and that will only lead to problems.  Besides, wouldn't you rather have an excuse for a day at the spa or a lunch date with a couple girlfriends or something?|`|wGw834Gkaa	When I was married my hubby had a once a year vacation plan with his buddies.  I loved it!  I got to do the things that he thought were boring and we had a break from each other.  I probably could have went with them but I realized it was his recharge time and didn't put him in the position of having to tell me no.  Even the most in love people can use a breather now and then.  And really, what if he insisted on going with you and your friends sometime when you had plans, how would that seem to you?|`|AA11404742	Stay home, and let him go with his buddies.      Speaking as a guy, getting out with your buddies now and then is a great thing.  It's a chance to drink beer and burp and fart without worrying about what the wives and girlfriends will say.  Yes, that's crude and obnoxious, but deep down, there's still a 7 year old boy in there.    If you want to go to a motorcycle rally, tractor pull, or car show with him, schedule something for the two of you, or maybe with another couple that the 2 of you get along with.  But give him a little "guy time" with his friends.  He'll appreciate it.  And he'll appreciate it even more if you give him a special "welcome home" afterwards.|`|pwejv6jpaa	he wants to hang out with the boys. where is the trust?  if all his friends are single why would he want his wife around.|`|JLayHNZCaa	Guys often say and do childish things when out together, you know, "look at the headlights on that one", "I would do that on the kitchen table", etc.   It doesn't mean he will do anything out of line, but he may want to act silly like his buds and you may cramp all their styles?  Or maybe, one of his buds has shown unwanted interest in you and he doesn't want you that close to them now.  Don't insist on going, just tell him, when he gets back, you will be waiting in bed, all revved up and ready to rumble.  He may leave his friends early to get home to you?|`|zoH6rMCPaa	I don't blame him, it's bad enough that I have to see my wife around t he house never mind her tagging along after me everywhere!|`|oRzqWhsDaa	its up to you do you trust him don't make a big deal out of this unless his behavior has changed then you have a right be uneasy about this|`|w5sK75MPaa	Sounds like he wants to due some male bonding with his buddies. The times you went with him maybe he felt he couldnt be one of the guys. I think you should let him go with his friends. Just tell em next time your gone.|`|K1iUzewyaa	Charissa, I think that you should let him go by himself.. He probably loves to spend time with you, and enjoy the events with you, but sometimes it's good to go out on his own from time to time. I say let him go alone, do a little male bonding with his friends... It'll also mean a lot to him if you don't give him a hard time about him going alone... Sometimes we just need to get away for a while.. It'll also be a good chance to build eachothers trust.. It seems like you really want to go, so if he asks you, or insists on you going, than go... either way, maybe plan a girls day, I'm sure you need time away too...|`|l4d1Vg2Vaa	Come on, turn this one on its head - how would you feel if you were planning a nice weekend away with the girls and your husband was mooching about muttering about wanting to go too?   You haven't told us if you actually LIKE motorcycle rallies? Be honest with yourself anyway - wouldn't you really rather be doing something else? Would you be wanting to go to this event if your husband wasn't in the equation?   Listen, everyone needs time away with their own friends once or twice a year - let him go and enjoy the time he's away by doing something with your own friends. He'll owe you one then - so next time you want a girls' weekend away he won't be able to argue about it!|`|AA11349925	Stay home, he doesn't want to look a tool being the only one with a wife tagging along.    If you trust him you'll stay home|`|RoEyFm5yaa	IF IT WAS JUST GUYS GOING I WOULD SAY HE SHOULD GO ON HIS OWN.IF THERE'S CHICKS GOING YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO GO AND HE SHOULDN'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IT.IF HE NEEDS TIME ALONE THEN HE CAN DO THAT ANOTHER WEEKEND.|`|X6gbqrdzaa	I think that he may just want some time alone. Dont think of anything bad i am sure its just wanting to be with his friends. I am the same way!|`|zllFsqMYaa	well i go to bike week every yr. me and my wife...her gilrs do what that do n me n my boys do what we do..yes girls get on the back of my bike n I seen her on the back of other guys bikes but the trust is there so maybe u n some girls can go n see his reaction i bet it will be different if so that raise's a RED FLAG but dont jump out there if his reaction changes just listen to what he says ..i bet if u told him u n yur gilrs r going he will say  4 what|`|niSRQw53aa	Just let him go alone.  Sometimes guys just want to hang with their guy friends.  Even in marriage, some couples need a little time away from one another.  Don't take it personally.  This could be a good time for you to spend some time with your girlfriends.    When I was married I needed time away from my husband.  And he fought me every time I even wanted to go to the bookstore alone.  This made me feel very suffocated and angry.|`|8bplNvAQaa	His mates probably don't feel comfortable to be themselves when you're there.    Let him go and do something yourself while he's away.  Maybe go out with some girlfriends and treat yourselves.  :)|`|ea75636c818cdaebe524dace2d00f82caa	I just noticed this thing is showing a male icon that I'm a guy - but I'm a chick! just so you know. I wish I knew how old you are and how long you've been together, but that's OK because I've got your answer. LET HIM GO ALONE. It's going to kill you, but you must do this. Do it and this will strengthen your marriage. It doesn't matter that you've gone in the past. A man needs time alone with his buds. But do not despair - this is just what you want to happen and here's what you do: Pack he and his buds some nice snacks to take, give him a great night of sex before he goes, give him a nice kiss with a pretty smile as he heads out the door and wave goodbye. Starting right now tell him you're totally cool with this. Don't pout. Don't tell him you're scared or insecure. It's going to go against every fiber of your being, but if you love this guy and want to keep him do as I tell you. After he's gone DON'T text him and don't call him. Let him do that stuff IF he wants to. It'll be hard, but don't do it. This guy is going to start wondering what's up. He'll immediately begin rethinking how much he loves and values you. He'll start wanting to get his butt home quick with a bouquet of flowers in tow. (He might not have the flowers but that's OK, too.) Don't be concerned that all the buds are single. I know exactly the things you're worried about. Sure, he and his friends might start looking (I said "looking") at other women but there isn't a man alive that wouldn't do that no matter how blissfully happy he was with his woman or if the friends were all married and also happy. It doesn't mean much. It certainly does not mean he's hell bent on cheating on you. There are undoubtedly at least one if not several of his single friends who secretly think you're hot as hell and only wish they were in his shoes. Trust me honey, I know what I'm talking about. I'm waaay older than you, I can tell by how you ask the question, and I know what's what. When he gets back you'll have an attentive, loving, hot for you man on your hands that will tell how lousy the trip really was and how much he missed you. It'll be hard, but be a smart woman and do it. Love, Lynn
iOo9MAxJaa	I'm sorry you're "traumatized."  Contact the police if it will make you feel safer. Your safety is the most important thing.|`|SsI4LLUZaa	You'd better call the police if you think he will get you because then they can prosecute him if he comes back to bother you.|`|5WDsdDQ6aa	You're crazy....call the police and get a restraining order against this guy!|`|Yy28UP2aaa	The police need a record of his abuse in case he finds you. You should go to your local guidance center and seek counseling. The more professional people you talk to the better of you will be. Call the abuse hotline.www.nationalabusehotline.org|`|BhXOLas1aa	Write a letter to the local police saying that this man has threatened to kill you, give them all his details.  If you are now many miles away from him and he really does not know where you are. You must never let him be told by a friend or member of your family.  Most men who beat or threaten to kill a woman are bullies, he had power over you while he beat you and made you frightened that he would kill you.  I can't see any point in him killing you as he would not have control over you then.  If he does find you, you can tell him that all his details are with the police, that should stop him hurting you.|`|78c5d650f87826bfbfea0158b5e3884faa	You should contact the police because you never know, he might find you but if you already spoke to the police about your situation, they should be able to help you.

You have to put a restraining order against him in order to start a paper trail. I would also suggest you contact a local battered woman's shelter for some other ways to stay safe. May God Continue to bless and keep you.
qW3dVcRtaa	here is what i did:    5lb bags of: reeses (his and my fav), white chocolate covered pretzels (my fav), sprees, peanut m&m's and the big snow caps. As well as a 140 count of twizzlers. We purchased our candy at our local bulk candy store Sweeites. But i  do recommend sams or costco as well, they sell five pound bags of most of your name brand candies.     This went over well with everyone, and i had 120 guest.  Sorry i do not have a pic, but i had them in pretty glass containers that i purchased at patcatans, and flowerfactory, All in all i think it cost me about 250 for the whole setup, maybe less...    best of luck to you, the candy buffet is alot of fun, and you can get really creative with color, or like us we just chose come of our favorites. And we posted a poem in a pretty picture frame that read    Step right up  To the candy buffet  Its a sweet addition  To a wonderful day    This is a treat  We are offering you  On this day we say I do  Use the scoop  Choose what you like  Leave some for others  Be Polite.    As you enjoy  Your bag of treats  Please remember  Love is sweet!      Thank you for joining us today!  Love,  Bride Groom (names     And i made labels on my home computer for the little baggys that read "wishing you sweet goodnight" with our monogram in the middle with fall leaves behind them, and our names and wedding date at the bottom.     Best of luck to you, and congrats!   HAVE FUN!!|`|D4I1hmRPaa	You could get a ton of those little chinese take out boxes as the "treat bag."     You should have a bunch of different sized hurricanes, bowls, dishes that are all full of different candies with little scoops. Garage sales are great places to find a bunch of unique glassware for really cheap.    Also you could buy candies in bulk to save money OR you could have friends and family make things for you. Like have Aunt B make chocolate covered pretzels and Aunt A make chocolate chip cookies, etc. Most families have people in them that would LOVE to help a little and that LOVE baking.     Use your resources around you!     Good luck!|`|7G1AU7m9aa	We bought different size vases and decorated them in the theme colors and will fill them with different candies, and then I bought organza and am going to make the bags.|`|NRJdsk9Saa	Great idea !  Try pretty jars like in old fashioned drug stores. Put in colorful candies like M & M's with a tiny scoop in each jar. Shop on-line as well  as at local stores  for super- economy sized  bags. After Valentines day you should be able to buy Love candies at greatly reduced prices. They  should be appropriate for any wedding.       Also , provide guests with small (snack sized )   plastic bags to put their goodies in.    And it helps if guests have eaten their cake before starting on the candy.  Have someone appointed to set out the candy at an appropriate time. Say , 5 minutes after most  of the guests have  gone through the cake line. Then invite the children to be first in line.|`|AA10405438	Chocolate fountain with marshmallows, pretzels, vanilla wafers, etc...  Buy in bulk|`|AsFiWxhUaa	try sams and costco for the candy and do m&m's, jelly beans, jolly ranchers, life savers, get smaller bags and that should help cut the cost as well. best of luck and congrats|`|MkErhX7Haa	I had a candy buffet at my reception.  I found jars on sale for $3 each at Pier 1.  Other good places to look for jars are TJ Maxx, Marshalls, yard sales, and dollar stores.  I bought candy at Walmart and the grocery store--I checked the sales flyers and just bought a few bags here and there each week depending on what was on sale.  I looked at bulk candy suppliers online, but I found that after shipping, they were actually more expensive than shopping for candy in stores.  Oh, and Cracker Barrel has a great sellection--I got candy sticks for 8 cents each.      For bags, I ordered them online from www.creativegiftpackaging.com.  I got 200 bags (coffee bean bags) for $15, and then I printed labels with our monogram on the computer and used a sticker machine to put them on the bags.    Bubbles, speak for yourself.  I never get tired of candy.|`|2219815a5f68b0925e6613039b0922b6aa	Well, I don't know if this idea would work for the type of wedding you're planning, but we're doing a wedding pinata.  We'll just fill it with all kinds of candy and some small wedding favors, and let our guests have a whack at it.  To me it just seems like a more fun way to give people their treats and favors at the end of the reception.  Plus. it's a lot less expensive than the trendy candy buffets that are showing up in weddings everywhere.|`|ge3meKYEaa	Skip it- most adults don't care about candy.  Seriously, I would have to have a gun held to my head to scoop up candy at a wedding- I am not 7 years old.  It's just so immature to me...........
Yy28UP2aaa	I've been married for 30 years (to the same guy) Kevin summed it up perfectly I think. It's verry hard sometimes to fight fair but if you can both leave a disagreement with your self respect still intact then you BOTH have won. It seems like that is the main goal in most arguements: to WIN!!!!  Unfortunate, but if you can put the winning aside....... If you "keep the sex dirty" that leaves you both very happy & noone is looking for a change or excitement any where else!!!|`|5MAx8mHxaa	If you can have a conversation with your significant other, while they're on the can and not be fazed that's a strong marriage! lol|`|aDIPIu7xaa	LOL @ KJ.......

And hey, I am hungry now too!    : )|`|8103f5a386f35ec2420460c4f3b3dcabaa	Try some mutual respect and love with lots of kindness and a bit of committment..along with compromise..and you might just keep a marriage going..|`|0d0W0nbVaa	well, now i'm hungry for some eggs and BACON...  hash browns on the side with a biscuit or two.. and glass of orange juice.|`|zAoKd2DBaa	oh yes i like the sound of that.     i don't think that's all you need though.     but it's a good start.
bg9qKq46aa	Try asking him out  Too many girls lose guys because they're too scared to ask them out or because they think it is the mans duty    Its not  I am friends with lots of boys, and most of them seem to think its attractive if a girl asks them out, shows your willing to put effort in.    If you dont want to ask him out, try flirting, you don't need to be subtle.  Push him and stuff, gently of course.  ALWAYS laugh if he tells a joke, and try to make him laugh.  Look him in the eyes, and as he looks back, look away  , then slowly move your eyes back to where they were.. It hints that you like him : )   Touch his hand if you are walking together.  Smile at him lots.  Joke around and stuff with him, he'll get it soon enoughh ; )  Good luck!!|`|uAefMTNNaa	Im a guy, and don't worry, it doesn't pressure him to say yes. But if what you say is true, he should probably say yes. But if you are one of those people that kinda get shy asking out people in front of other people, just find out if you're in any of the same clubs/classes, sit beside him, or get him as you're project partner, and then go for it.|`|jZ03Zdjdaa	We are in the 21st century.  If you like the guy, ask him out.  Why should guys have to take all the dating rejection risk?    P.S.  To your additional details:  Cussing at people on this board shows serious immaturity.  IMO, you are not mature enough to be dating.    Also, you have your hands full with motherhood.  Teenage boys are not emotionally or financially ready to be dating teenage mothers.  Given your maturity level and the fact you're a teenage mother, I recommend you don't date at this time.|`|W0b2oqZvaa	you should take control and get into his head then if that doesn't work then ask him out|`|bXGwTQy6aa	he best thing to do its find a way to get closer to him and start some conversations to build trust between you 2,it will be apparent at some point if he likes you too..then you can jump in and sk him out|`|OAYaeW22aa	rub up against him in like a flirting way. hold his hand whenever he isnt doing anythin. wenvr u r free u shujust talk about personal stuff.|`|ABhmJepFaa	Did you ever hear about the benefits of Ventriloquism?|`|RsJHmJKYaa	If he don't take you to dinner dump him!

I am not sure how this guy is, but every guy is different. But if you sense that he is showing the same interest in you, ask him out, dinner movie, or just to hand out, as friends or whatever.

Hope I help|`|034289d2e5f2ba9ddcddc9d244cfea7eaa	Once you have a child (at least natural sense), you are typical deemed to be old enough to do certain things such as dating.    It all depends on the age (18 and above in most cases). Like you have just said, you have a child, so why not ....?    The guy approaches you in a nice manner, just show the same openness by responding in a positive manner. (Tit for tat).    If you do not want others to see you and mr. X, just tell him you are not comfortable during class and that you can discuss the issue after class, or after hours.    Just be neutral until he says what he means by just being nice. Nice could just be because he wants a female friend and no more than that.    So, if he wants to appoint with you, be willing to say check me later and we shall talk about this, not now gentleman. If he is co-operative he will agree to your suggestion, besides he looks interested by your description.    He should be able to wait for the right time to express himself.  Normally young man of the same age group are also shy, and would not like to be seen in public with girls?    just wait for him to make the first move and you respond positively.
P7PdJKGfaa	Any relationship that you don't feel comfortable with should be immediately ended or reconsidered. It seems that the "tiger" controls you, before doing anything drastic you should try to talk to him, and if he doesn't respect you then just remember one thing:    IT'S HIS LOSS!|`|6f4f7d14ae8b69e50ccaf068c55c7152aa	To your last comment.

I will not leave you for a younger man, I will join you for activities that we both enjoy but we each need time to pursue our individual interests.  I am happy that you are willing to help with the necessary house work chores; that will give us time to devote to something we are both passionate about - (pick a charitable cause) or (pick a hobby) or (pick a physical activity).  I feel special when I am with you, and I know that men think you are lucky to have me as your wife when they see us together.  I love you and will always be with you."

Now is not the time to cut out on your husband. You have children involved in the decision making here not matter  what the ages are. Studies show that children can hold bitterness and resentment when parents divorce. In a way  they lose hope of having a lasting marriage and happiness in their lives. When you committ to a partner you commit for life.     Do you plan to divorce your child if he or she got into some legal trouble that made you suffer. Of course not, just because the option exists does not mean that you take it. What is the reason that you married this Man in the first place. It must have been because of the qualities that many older Men have and that is to provide.     You are not going to find a Man that will be able to fill your husbands shoes. It has taken him 25 years to fill his shoes. I am young and have thought about the age cap that I have for a mate. I don't want to be in your shoes. This is about your Character here, not his willingness to make you happy. This Man has sacrificed for you and the Kids. It is your turn to take on the Cherishing Wife Role!

I am in sort of a similar situation and I would like to know if you feel that you have made a mistake. I am engaged to a man that is older than me and he treats me better than any man that I have ever been with. He enjoys spoiling me and spending a significant amount of time with me. We moved to a town where I don't know anybody and I don't have any family near by so I depend on him a lot. I'm just wondering if I will regret marrying him later because of our age difference. Also, when he gets even older, will I continue to be attracted to him? I feel that older men that are involved or married to younger women are insecure that they will leave for a younger man. My fiancee is always asking me do i think he is too old for me. I'm very much happy with him right now but I don't want it to be because he is the only one in my life right now that I can depend on or who is there for me at all cost. He has proven his love for me numerous times. I try to assure him that I love and care about him and that the age is not a factor but after reading your question, i wonder if it will be. Will I regret hanging out with my younger generation and dating younger men? Am I missing anything? These are the questions that you should also ask yourself. Remember: Most people think the grass will be greener on the other side but it never truly isn't.   Its the same grass, just a different lawn.|`|3g1ZgTe4aa	What attracted you to him to begin with? Search your heart and go back to the first time you both met. Keep that thought . Do you not think that perhaps he sees you differently also. You do not have the same body you had 25 years ago. that is just a terrible reason to leave your husband. We are all going to eventually get old and grey, and we cannot control that. Put yourself in your husbands shoes. If you were the older one would you want him to leave you?|`|s5XRrBZ4aa	What if it was the other way around and he was the young attractive one who decided he was done with you, the older not so attractive one! isn't there are a saying like the greatest gift of all is life? he gave you two of those already plus 25 years of committed love. as someone who is about to get married, that is exactly what i'm hoping for in my life. stop being selfish, work out your marriage. i mean, what a tough break!  you found a man in this world that can put himself aside for you!!! rent some porn if you need a younger man!!
PDcnXgE6aa	Hi, I am an IITian completed my B. TECH from IT-BHU.  First of all don't think too much about the coaching fees. Yeah it will cost u more than 1.5L for 2 years together with class 11&12.  But once u got selected, this money is nothing for u...and if u not selected then ....u will become sufficient strong in ur subjects that u will easily crack AIEEE or ur STATE Engg. TEST.  And currently IIT-JEE allows you one more year after class 12. So If u find urself strong enough and not selected first time ...plz u try for second chance...It took me 2 attempt to selected.     Once u selected in IIT ur mind will be considered and ISI marked among ur family and friends .....so try to take privilege of that pride.|`|oRzqWhsDaa	go for it and its what you want and if you dont go for it you will regret it|`|rvSrjNeQaa	Work hard..........and go for it !!|`|dnfjdbSOaa	hey cool gal...my advice 4 u is concentrate in ur 12th...cos that is more important than anything...admission and scholarship in various institutes can be earned with ease anytime (especially 4 someone as stusious as u)....but 12th is the basic and u really have to concentrate in that and do wat u do best - score high marks....!! :-)|`|mYkjTDzYaa	This is a very common practice followed by the institutes. They basically have to find the students for their business. They may offer discounts, certificates, trophies etc just to befool the students and often set deadlines so that they are not able to consult others. Just concentrate on your studies for now. Your fundamentals should be strong.     You know better wheather you should invest in coaching or in lot of sample test papers + self study +  (local tutor if required!).|`|Np6vDWO5aa	never let urself feel  dat u cannot do i its good dat u realised that ur parents will be spending about half lakh rupees onur coaching so definetely there will b seriousness in u for the coaching and when u say u r a good studentthat will be not hectic. relax, and go ahead. good luck.|`|CGtZ0hSEaa	Ya go to it..Its best for your life ...you will feel it after your studies that "Oh!

It is likely that she may be busy and therefore cannot get into a conversation with you as a result.    You need to let this girl know that you are interested in her (just don't rush in to any thing) take time to see how things go.  It seems to me that you built up a good raport with her the other day so there is a good foundation with which to build upon.      Don't get stressed out, or obsessed, with a response from a text message mate.  Women want stability in men.  Just allow conversation to flow between you and her and enjoy the time you spend with her.  Doing this will make her enjoy your time together also.  Just build foundations until you feel comfortable enough with how you are getting on together to take her out to the movies, or some such thing.    Good luck|`|lfsxZA59aa	I think she is trying to lead you on. Girls play hard to get with. You can expect her to ask you something, she wants you to do it. Girls do that a lot.

If that's what it is, you don't have to tell any one. Straight people don't walk around going "I'm straight!" so you don't have to do that either. It's your personal preference, nobody else's. Now if it's something else,  then just tell some family member that won't get upset over it, and then wait til after the wedding to tell the rest of your family.|`|8II1frHiaa	Secret is a personal matter and why you are so much interested to tell your family and dragging the issue as a big matter.    secret should always be a secret until last breath, so it is called secret, if you tell others it is not a secret, it is an information or news to them.    ok..whatever comes, you have to face the consequences out of the secret.  so, it is better to be calm until marriage of your sister completes.  Then, the secret will have no effect, since you preserved the secret for two months and nothing difficult in continuing the process.    Don't confuse your peaceful family by telling an useless matter as secret.   why i say this as useless ?  The matter may be a secret to you, but it is not a matter for others.    Are you joking ?  when you are maintaining the secret from childhood, and now what happened ?  hence, continue the secret and no need to tell your family or others. it is good to you as well as your family. ok?|`|fvUAYU7xaa	It depends what the secret is.  Good luck anyway x|`|NXwzuv3Paa	go with your gut feeling|`|X88lyKHoaa	No offence but now it's gonna bug the heck out of me what this secret it. But eh..it's your choice that you don't wanna tell and i respect that(:  But wait, til like a month after the wedding. because if you've waited this long i betcha you can wait longer(:  Good luck!|`|LuIsLQH2aa	WTF YOU'RE MARRYING YOUR SIS?!?!?|`|4UkyrTKZaa	well if its something that has to do with her then say it....like epsecially if her fiance cheated or soemthing|`|1d86ed5e88a024daffb47bccfc5a461baa	It's never a good time to give bad news when something good is going on. It is time for your sister have her wedding day. And nothing should enter fear with her plans. If this is something that goes back to your child hood. Then it can wait a few more months. You might think about telling them both at the same time. Or maybe your sister first and ask her to go with you and tell your father together. Ask her to be your support system. I know first hand how hard it is to deal with child hood things. It just eats you up in side. But you can do this..  Put a well thought out plan together and I know you will get the love and understanding you are looking for. Oh! give your sister some time to settle into her new marriage. Good Luck|`|dBkEqT2naa	Why would the secret be such a big deal? Is the person getting married to someone who your family wont' approve of?|`|3d1XRIzkaa	You have to tell him some time. Might as well tell him and get it over with.|`|hoBREUGLaa	You should have at least said what the problem had to do with, but since you didn't I'm going to assume it's something lifechanging to peoples opinion about you. It's better to tell your family something if you need to get it off your chest, no matter what they should be able to accept you because they're your parents. Just come out of the closet, after that you'll feel alot better.
1Z0Lmrk1aa	All you can do is try your best to convince her its a scam. Lay out the facts to her and then just let ti go. Sometimes you can talk to these people till your blue in the face and it won't do any good. It's like a gambling addiction or any other kind of addiction, they have to see the light of day themselves to finally get the point.
lgyPxg26aa	If they were received during your relationship, at least after your relationship became exclusive, then it is a form of emotional cheating.    If they were from a former love, and kept for sentimentality then I would think nothing of them.      Most everyone has had a former love.  Feelings for and about those relationships don't magically go away just because we are in a new relationship.      If your current relationship is strong, there is no need to worry about them.  If your partner is dallying on the side now, your relationship isn't as strong as you think.|`|KO4Ea9Xkaa	If they were from before we met, they wouldn't bother me, if they were written whilst we were together then I would be asking him to explain...|`|zAoKd2DBaa	My advice to you would be to try very hard to be calm and even try not to let him know that you know.  If something is going on and he knows that you have found the letters he will cover his tracks immediately and you may never know the truth.  You may not want to know the truth.....    I'd get his phone and send her a message (if you have her number) or return the letters with a note from him saying "please stop contacting me you f*t b*tch" - ok you don't have to add the end bit on.     if you really truly want to know what's going on keep quiet and do some investigating.|`|5NKa5Y8laa	Depends when they were written.      If before me, I would think the writer must have been very special to him if he kept them, and I'd probably feel a little jealous, but just put them back where I found them and dwell on it for a while, and then find a way to casually mention them to my guy.    If during our relationship, then I would be crushed, angry and worried, and considering I wear my heart on my sleeve, I wouldnt be able to ignore them and pretend they didnt exist, and would confront him and demand answers.|`|BhlGe0A8aa	My husband's ex wife of over 38 years still sends him Birthday cards and Christmas cards-I don't really mind that.What I do object to is what she writes in them-all lovey and and lots of kisses.She knows our address but sends them to his office so she knows she is doing wrong.!  If I could find out her phone number I would give her a piece of my mind.!  I have found two poems that my husband wrote(but never sent) to a woman he met on Friends Reunited.  I have told this woman what I think of her and as far as I know communication has stopped.  You just have to tell these sluts who is boss!|`|Te7H58XEaa	If they were sent whilst we were in our relationship i'd....    Burn them all.........  and then burn him.|`|QIwhMrBraa	how old are they? if they were before he met you, then get over it. people hold onto all sorts of s**t. dont mean they havent moved on, and it aint your business anyway if this is the case. stop spying.    if the letters are current, thats another story entirely. id confront him, and her if i had her address.    good luck|`|H3WHxCgaaa	Depends on when they were written...|`|3g1ZgTe4aa	check the date. Regardless, why does your partner still have those letters. does your partner still love this person. Have them prove it by throwing them out and forgetting about them. If your partner does not want to throw them out then you have a problem. Just do not keep this to yourself, let your partner know that you found them.|`|78c5d650f87826bfbfea0158b5e3884faa	That happened to me before I was not married to my husband at the time.  Some nasty whore, wrote him a love letter and sent nude photo's to him.  She happen to call when I was there and I let her have it. I threatened her and she was all scared and I told her that if she ever called him again I have her address, that I would come to her house and kick her a*s...  I was not really going to do that because she is not worth going to jail.  I just wanted to scare her.  It was also my husbands fault because he must of said something to her to make her that comfortable for her to send those photo's.|`|315pFf1Waa	if the letters were written before you met then rearly its not your business , but why has he Still got them if its recent then ask him out right .there might be a simple answer .but don't rush straight in say casually oh sorry i found these letters .are they important .if they are not he will throw them away but its up to you to make this decision .a relationship is based on trust .are you insecure  ask yourself first .hope this helps .|`|SRY26lUTaa	Well I think it depends on when it was written, and where you found them. I found a love letter to my husband from before we were together in a box of paperwork, tax papers etc when we were moving.  I got jealous even though it was from years ago, I showed it to him, he said throw that crap out. So I did. IF its from the past you really shouldn't be upset. If he got that recently while being with you, THEN I would be totally pissed off and confront him about it in a calm and rational matter. Men don't react well to crying over emotional talk. Good luck|`|AA11063878	it would depend on when they were from..for instance when me and my husband were just engaged, we were moving in together, both out of our places and into a new one, so we were both cleaning out our homes, getting rid of as much clutter as possible. well he had all this high school memorabilia, and it contained pictures and letters between him and friends, and the occasional love letter, movie ticket stubs, etc. he was going to throw them out, I insisted he keep them, it was just too sweet, he still has them, and I still have mine. I think it will be really sweet to show our kids one day..even though they are not between mommy and daddy it will be cool to show them our lives before we met each other, and those people are a part of it. so if its somethng like that, I would just ignore it. However, if these are recent letters while you are in a serious relationship...I would fold them up very nicely, and tie a pretty ribbon around them and leave them on his pillow while you sit beside them in nothing but a tie....and then when he comes in....leave and tell him you have a date.|`|JE3ak8JCaa	if i realised that my partner was receiving love letters from another person then i would talk to him about it, if he seems open and honest about whats going on then believe him, but if he seems uncomfortable about it then you should be suspicious.|`|4np4Av70aa	manipulate a way that he would discover some love letters(obviously made up and planted strategically) address to me.......see his reaction ....and do the same reverse the situation.    Obviously if love letters made had to have the same criteria (ie written before or during)your relationship with him.    Have some fun and at the same time you could discover a lot.|`|aDIPIu7xaa	Depends when they were written.    Before the engagement?  Not a big deal.  After the engagement, the $hit would hit the fan!
kYgblA7Faa	hang out with JUST him so he can get comfortable being around you most of the time hes probably shy to kiss you because its in front of other people or something but just hang with him alone and get comfortable i used to be really shy too and that changed cause i got more comfortable|`|pwejv6jpaa	grow up|`|nfGDZWfBaa	You be the aggressive one then you take his hand when you are at the mall, he will get used to it and do it on his own.  kissing thing should come natural once his is comfortable with you in public places some people just think that kissing privately is just that not for public. but grab his hand.|`|dm9evixvaa	tell him how you feel. tell him its ok to be shy but that he should feel free to be a little more... intimate (lack of a better word). don't push him though, that could make him panic. give him time and then things will get better.|`|pUvEmPrCaa	A relationship grows into a comfort level.  It's not going to turn into that overnight.  Don't push him into anything he's uncomfortable doing.  But try and talk to him and tell him how comfortable he makes you feel.  Ask if you make him feel comfortable or if he still gets nervous around you?  Those are cute questions that won't offend him, but will help bring up the subject.  You can tell him how much you love holding his hand or showing him off in public.  That will boost his ego and let him know that you want more of it.    But he wants you to like him for him and if you can't accept him for his shyness he will be hurt.  You need to let him know that you like him regardless of his shyness, but you can use tips like that to work your way around it.  He will come around.|`|EIK4TaWoaa	Most shy people are the type of people who never want to be a bother or cause anyone any trouble.    They are also very risk adverse. Many are afraid of making social mistakes so they do as little as possible to get by. They rarely draw attention to themselves. They think everyone is looking at them unless they hide in the crowd. One of their biggest fears is that they'll make a fool of themselves and everyone will remind him of it for the next twenty years. They find it very difficult to get over things and move on. They are very hard on themselves and cringe over memories that if it happened to you, you would laugh and forget about it.      Tell him he has your permission to hold your hand or kiss you. It will take a little time for him to feel comfortable with that. When he sees it's safe to be himself his shyness will begin to disappear.|`|jCn2VAIxaa	I used to be the same way.    This is a bad situation, if you put up with it he won't change. If you're too harsh he MAY change or he MAY just go further into shyness.    Here's what I would suggest:    Be frank with him. Sit him down and tell him straight up "I need you to be a man. Don't be a pu55y, I already have one, don't need another. If you can't start acting like a man, I'll have to leave you until you become one."      I know, it's really hard, and that's not what happened to me. I had to realize it myself, nobody helped me. But looking back, I think something like that would've helped.|`|5zuGJxnkaa	i had a gf like that..im just telling you. dont push him. itll ruin the relationship. it happened to me|`|yA8sw0bOaa	what you need to do is dump him but if you really like each other try to sit down with him and ask him whats going on and if he don't try to open up try to tell him the things he could miss out on i'm sure your beautiful tell him how you feel to get him to open up and if he don't my best option is to find someone who appreciate you|`|8d220f500762c84b66042158d9d97babaa	Don't do anything to push his comfort level. Let him move at his own pace. He sounds young so he's probably new to all of this dating stuff. His shyness sounds so sweet and cute. When your older, you will have guys pushing themselves on you so cherish this moment. You will have fond memories of him when you are older.|`|4b5IQWcFaa	give him some space and time.  let him be more comfortable and dont push it.    slowly he'l come.|`|vi231UoZaa	he obviously is scared he will screw it up. Im shy when im around my girl and thats what i think. "What if i do this? What will she do? Will i Screw it all Up?" So talk with him. Let him know that you won't leavehim for just making goofy little mistakes. that you'll always like him (or love him if you've gotten to that point),no matter what. and hell get a little bit more comfortable. and once he acccidently does something goofy or unatractive, just dont get mad. if its funny laugh. if its not but its still no biggy dont do anything. just be chill about it.|`|FQ0lKEB0aa	He obviously doesnt match you very well or match your needs, sorry love.|`|pc1EKWSuaa	i think he shy coz u just dated for a MONTH just wait...give him space...  if u wan to kiss him..juts kiss him on his cheek that's all...|`|oDI8ez1Vaa	just grab his dick yo  freals
V5PxYG17aa	I would say shy but interested. You better talk to him next time before he gives up thinking you aren't interested. Don't be afraid to break out of your barrier. Talk to him and be friendly. I think he likes you!!! lol.|`|el8yX5q3aa	Well you better make the next move...he probably doesn't think you are interested if you didn't talk to him when he took a risk.|`|TTaLB4kdaa	I'd say interested.|`|kfuA1RBoaa	friendly
iPNOVR6Gaa	If a man has sex with someone other than his wife, his wife is only to blame if she grabbed his penis and stuck it inside the other woman.      If a husband has a problem with his wife belittling him, he needs to address this issue directly and assertively with his wife. He needs to use his words to solve this problem, and not try to make it better by using his penis.|`|417a83c7cb091ac86d2ec601c9b825e2aa	Yes, both are to blame and they both need to grow up and try to have a marriage, if that is what they both want,. if not, they need to divorce and stop making each other miserable.|`|ma6Re8B1aa	It takes 2 to tango as the old saying goes. It is NEVER just one persons fault when theres problems in the relationship. If truth be told>>>> The wife should have never belittled him to get him to do what she wanted him to do. BUT>>>The truth here is>>>that if they had a decent realtionship to begin with, then the belittleing and cheating wouldn't have taken place. NO ONE can MAKE you do something that you don't want to do. Cheaters can't blame their partner for them cheating. It was a choice they made for themselves to make themselves feel better. The reality is if they felt good about themselves at the beginning>>>they wouldn't need to cheat at all!!!!!!!!!!!  It's always about YOU and what choices you make in your life. No one can make you do something you don't want to do.|`|e5f4c192231c92a0d059825b151f7553aa	In this case - yes.    Woman should be supportive, not belittling.  Man should find help or grow up.|`|ooT1Gj2Xaa	Both, anyone that is belittle time and again has the propensity to look for positive attention else where.|`|xGshAiXOaa	Yes, both are to blame.  They both said I do.  The wife should have known ahead of time that the husband was immature.  The husband does sound immature if he is going to try to blame the wife for his infidelity.  But that's the bigger picture.  Strictly for this situation, the husband was unfaithful, that was his indiscretion.  The wife was not there pushing his lips against the other woman's.  Everyone makes their own choices, and subsequently some people will make excuses and play the blame game.  The husband is at fault.|`|ChpS0laRaa	Yes both are to blame, Talking about things rationally and in an honest and controlled manner may have stopped it getting to that point but neither made the effort, Distance from each other helps also, if an arguement was brewing then take some time out to think about things and defuse the situation|`|Q0SIuZWjaa	belittling him isnt a good enough excuse for him to sleep with someone else. belittling doesnt breakup a family, cheating does.|`|QIwhMrBraa	at least you have some degree of self accountability, unlike too many men, and some women, ive known. so brownie points to u for that. it is  unacceptable for your partner to belittle you, even mean, and to some degree i dont blame u for cheating, though u are right, two wrongs dont make a right, and u kind of went for the jugular, didnt u, by cheating rather than by choosing a lesser form of revenge or a less hurtful way to make yourself feel better, or, lo and behold, trying to work it out constructively rather than just jumping into the sack with some tart. this just proves your immaturity that she accuses u of.    both of you are to blame, but end of day, she didnt cheat. u did. and cheating will do more damage to trust than belittling a partner, though if you are both willing u can work together to not play these little games that will eventually wreck your relationship beyond repair.    continued digs at a partner are a form of abuse, so monitor this. if she doesnt stop, regardless of the cheating issue, the pair of u will not work unless u put up with it,  which u shouldnt do.    best x

Look up "Histrionic Personality Disorder" on Google and you will find a description of a person like this.    This is not normal, but fairly common. Her husband probably trusts her at this point, but it is a matter of time before he figures her out. May be he loves her and thinks she will become more mature with time. May be he knows about her personality disorder. It is hard to say, but it is easy to explain her behavior.|`|TwtJxyn5aa	enjoy some nsa fun, i slept with this girl 2 weeks b4 she got married, and whenever she comes into town, we still bone, even though she married|`|145c8348c6805dffd8ad539dedd6effbaa	For your sake, end it.

I think she is more attached to her husband than to say that she loves him because when you truly love someone, you don't cheat on them period.    Don't give her so much credit because who's to say she won't cheat on you if ever things go rough between the two of you. Once a cheater, always a cheater, why ? because they know they can get away with it. They know how to play and manipulate people|`|78c5d650f87826bfbfea0158b5e3884faa	Some people cheat on they spouses because they are not getting any attention or they are not satisfied in the bedroom.  You must be doing something right for her to want to keep having this affair but she better be really careful actually you both better be careful.  What's done in the dark comes out into the light.  Meaning he will find out and things might get ugly.  Good Luck!!!|`|XVCbQ92Gaa	I'd stay away from her if I were you, she sounds like trouble. She's no longer available.

Bigtime.|`|925687da9c5df0799ce376427de4e62aaa	It does not seem to be normal. She is doing whatever she likes to do but at the cost of her promise made at the time of he marriage.

No wonder she never left her husband.    Like I stated previously, don't give her so much credit. She clearly demonstrated that her words and promises cannot be taken seriously because she cheated on her husband for 3 years. I don't get it. I don't think she loves him but she is more attached to him. Attached to the stability and security that her husband provides. Or maybe for the kids. Either way, if she truly loved you and respected you, she wouldn't be playing these mind games and play you for a fool.    If she truly loves you, she'll leave her husband to be with you.

If she is going to keep quiet and let her husband believe it's his, then I would let it be.  Just consider yourself a sperm donor.  If she wants to tell him, then be there for her and your child when he tells her to get lost.|`|Kl9zdMfpaa	You go to jail.|`|8bplNvAQaa	You'll be the father and have to pay child support.  If her and her husband stay together they will rinse you for every penny you've got and treat you like a piece of sh-it.|`|DIkfJ4DRaa	u'll be his husband usually   and do your responsibility as a good father   or husband to your wife and unborn baby usually ^^|`|AmfqQLhJaa	are you married to her.  if not then i guess well you are an @$$  i guess her spose will have to mess with tat|`|3g1ZgTe4aa	After blood work proves that you are the father, then you get to share custody with the baby. She may not want to tell her husband. So, it all depends on whether you want to claim the baby as yours. If you don't then she will live a lie and not tell her husband that the baby is not his.The baby will go on as his and hers.|`|OlNFzx8eaa	yep i agree with the guy above :)
W5wCArLqaa	Sure but Are you looking for friend or fling|`|beiztH7iaa	Yes, it's perfectly okay. In fact if you're discerning about who you become email friends with, you will love it. There are lots of interesting, caring, entertaining people all over the world. And it is a great way to meet and really get to know someone you would not otherwise have the opportunity to encounter. Just be mindful of those who practise deceit, but most people are decent and honest.|`|BhXOLas1aa	J H it's an excellent way to meet many people.  I hope you meet people here who would like to email you. Perhaps join a chat site for single people or those wanting to find friends.  Good luck.|`|DkAY3oNbaa	If you are not married, what is the harm.  Just make sure you don't get overly tied up with a stranger.  You never know who is really at the keyboard.|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	Why don't you just email your wife?|`|30ba6b2b18a194d0cef3eda2f3b0e6d6aa	Yes, it's good fun, get on with it!|`|92n13q98aa	Dude, 21st century, get with it. Of course it's ok!|`|10d29030429ea7a1527ba8f23128d41eaa	If your married that is not a good move. Emailing can always lead to other things if your married.
m0WUEtqXaa	dont listen to rumours.....AND sit her down and ask her honestly what is gping on and ask her to be accountable for her actions. See a therapist together and try to sort things out. If she is cheating the truth will surface sooner or later, but you will have peace of mind that you did nothing wrong and you did what was in your power to preserve the marriage.|`|0ImXbZTjaa	i believe that she is cheating...but maybe shes going through something since she had the baby and she needs to find herself...have u tried therapy|`|ma6Re8B1aa	What you need to do is to follow her to these bars shes going to. Then you'll know if shes cheating or not. It doesn't sound good by the way shes behaving. I'm not going to lie to you. ALL of it doesn't sound good!!!!!!!!  I would follow her to the bar and find out whats going on???? Any partner coming home at 4 or 5 in the morning is WRONG!!!!!!!!!! And trust me my friend>>>SOMETHING IS GOING ON!!!!!!!!!!!!  HEY BUBBLES>>> Theres NO rumors going on when shes walking in the house at 4 or 5 in the morning??? THAT my friend is a reality. And no married person should be walking in at 4 or 5 in the morning!!!!!  We did those things when we were single. REMEMBER???  HEY  AMYBEE 8??? Why are you putting the cheating on him??? Even if he was a bad husband. It doesn't give her the right to go CHEAT??? Theres other options we have in life. And just because the wife chooses the wrong one>>>doesn't mean it's HIS fault!!!!!!!! Grow up and stop blaming other people for what they do???? We all all responsible for our own actions and choices in life!!!!!!!|`|jROpVbrhaa	Yes shes cheating you.But are you also a good husband to her? Have you not given her headaches in the past , thats why shes acting that way.Convince her for a talk.If she will turn down,than thats the time for you to seek legal action.God bless.|`|BhXOLas1aa	Having a cell phone at her side all the time and keeping messages a secret is not a good sign. She is obviously not very happy, but that may not be her fault or yours. Sometimes women who have had children, no longer feel sexy, no matter how much you say she is. She may be testing that by going out and flirting a bit. That does not mean that she is having an affair. Women also go off sex sometimes and dare not cuddle because they know that it gives her husband the idea that she will want more than that.  This is not uncommon and it's not always easy to make it better very quickly.  She may have depression, or low self esteem. There can be many reasons.   My suggestion is that you find a quiet time with her and ask her how she feels about you and her life.  Ask if you are doing anything wrong.  Tell her that you love her and need a hug but will not ask her for sex until she tells you that she is ready.  If she is willing and you are both able, then see a relationship counsellor.  Talking through problems and not accusing her is the best way.  I hope that your marriage will be very happy again soon and that she is not having an affair.  Good luck.|`|AA11635143	She is placing red flags all over the place telling you that she is a cheater.  Read the signs!  She is not showing you any affection because she is saving herself for her boyfriend. Walk over to her, take her cell phone, tuck it into your pocket and leave the house.  Forget the crap about not invading her privacy. Check her calls and text messages and you will find out the truth. Confront her and make her tell you what she is up to and with whom.    Also get someone she doesn't know to follow her and make some cell phone pictures of her and the new guy.  She is neither being a good mother or a good wife and you should not tolerate it any longer.  Lay it all on the line and don't take this bullsh*t any longer.  It will ruin your nerves and cause you anxiety and depression if you don't handle it now.|`|d36f7c4fb8b8952c08aa3139dc2554b9aa	Well, I am not sure how long this lasts, but, she could have that condition when a women has a child, afterward she can get moody and act different and depressed at times.  The key to any relationship is the ability to communicate, sit down and talk with her on the couch, hold her hand at the same time (if she lets you hold hands) and tell her exactly how you feel and your concern for things.  Hope this helps.      The Pauper.|`|dPcU3Ethaa	its wrong decession|`|A1iDPPOeaa	Get a lawyer and kick the cheating wife to the curb.|`|vh0yVJ7daa	She is cheating on you dude you know she is and like it aint half obvious is it?Hello putting on make up to go to the gym?Coming home at 4 and 5am drunk?How do I know she is cheating on you?I work as security in pubs and clubs I am constantly around cheaters I have been with a cheating wife myself and had an ex cheating gf,She use to tell the husband she was working late then going out for a few drinks after it,Him like a mug believed her just like I belived my ex gf when she use to tell me she was working late,She is no longer the girl she was in bed with you?Dude get rid of that filthy hoe......|`|qrrdxE0Faa	there are several reasons why she's not having sex.  One could be she's scared of getting pregnant.  Also she could be having sex with the other guy and she's scared to get pregnant because then she wouldn't be sure who the baby belonged to and who wants that?  Also if she's "serious" with another guy, she could have promised him she'd stop sleeping with you, although she made the promise and commitment to you that she would only be for you and no one else.  Try to catch her in the act and have proof in case you (or her) decides to file for divorce that way she can't screw you over (again) and you have to pay out the a** in child support and all of that mess.  If you want to stay in your marriage even though you know she's cheating, then confront her about her cheating.  Suggest counseling.  A marriage without trust isn't a good thing.  Because it gets annoying when your spouse is checking your phone, your e-mails and asking you a million questions, but just let her know she's gonna have to earn back your trust if she decides she wants your marriage to work.  Be strong for your children.  And think about them in your decision, but also about yourself.  Good luck.|`|TqWXXZ34aa	Sounds to me like your wife may have been having an afffair. She needs to grow up. She sghouldn't be going to bars all all hours of the night. She is acting like someone that is single and doesn't have children. She is not being a good role modle for those kids either. She is leaving you home to take care of the kids while she is out partying and doing god knows what with god knows who.   I suggest that you tell her that you will NOT support her behavior of going out to bars and staying out till the wee morning hours. I would tell her that you love her but lately you have noticed a huge differance in her affections towards you ans it is starting to make you wonder. Tell her that you are only human and what she is doing is not right. YOu 2 are married meaning that she should be at home  with you and her kids. Not out partying and meeting with "other" men. Tell her that you want to go to counciling with her. Tell her that iof she will not decuss what is going on with you that maybe she and you should speak to a councilor. This needs to be delt with. Or it can/will only get worse. I would give her an ultamatium.. YOu stop going out to bars or we break up . Take some time away from her.  Imagine if this was you ans she was staying home with the kids and you were partying and not coming home at a reasonable hour.?! I would put it too her that way she how she would feel. She does this because you let her. She knows that you will never confront her on her behavior. stand up to her ans tell her enough is enough. Tell her that the 2 of you have a family now that the partying days are over and that she needs to stop. If she can't won't or doesnmt you may want to move on so that you can meet someone that wants the same out of life as you.,

CdBxhRcVaa	yes its happened, but not to the point of violence.   ive never done it, but im sure it would feel good to hit someone and make it seem like your the winner, but if they do it back, whos the winner? you certainly cant keep going!   so if your arguing with someone and feel the urge to hit them and can no longer say anything becasue either their so stubborn to understand or you feel YOUR loosing and hes gunna win, just walk away. it may seem childish but when your fighting with someone all your hormones are going crazy. thats why you may say things you would never say normally. just throw your hands in the air and get out of there!|`|eTO0ZIGvaa	Try living with your in law who tries to rule your life and your house.|`|O4atxtCkaa	yes it s always happen!

HzevoVflaa	People want the absolute best from their children, quite simply because it makes them proud to be able to say how good they are, and I believe in the Asian community, it's good ' face '  As long as you can say that you did your absolute best at the time of the exams, and did everything possible to achieve the best grades that you could, then they should be proud of you, no matter what you achieved.  The problem would come if you did not give it your best effort, because saying that you did may fool them, but deep down, you are cheating on no one but yourself, as it's your future.  If someone is paying for your education, then you have a duty to do the best that you possibly can, because then not only are you cheating on yourself, but them as well.

PpYl2dFVaa	wow im at a loss for words  no idea|`|Q2UDhYgkaa	You can report him if it was rape. Also the church may 'excommunicate' him or whatever because he is supposed to be refraining from sexual relations.

Report him, but don't sue.|`|FQ0lKEB0aa	Yeah report him to the church, he could be removed from his job. The child would be proof of this - dna and everything. If she was raped you need to report it to the police. Remember rape is just non consentual sex, it didnt have to be violent or physically forced, if he threatened her or intimidated or coerced her into it, it still counts.   Just be there for her, listen to her. If you start to get worried or feel out of your depth encourage her to see professional. I am a counsellor, it should be an easy, casual and safe experience for her. It doesnt mean theres anything wrong with her, just gives her someone objective to help her sort through her thoughts and experiences to try and understand and move forward.|`|C1TUaxISaa	i know priest here having sex with guys.. most of the priest here are gays..LOL!

JXw0U77aaa	You can find some pretty reclusive places in the British West Indies, if you go to the right island - try something like Anguilla, or something equally or more exclusive.  Or you can try the Pacific Islands...Fiji, Bali, etc...you can get some really, really private islands if you try out there.  Do a Google search for "private island rentals" and see what turns up...oftentimes there are some rich people who've purchased islands and built villas on them for their exclusive use, and rent them out...it'll definitely be expensive, but it's worth looking at.|`|crxbob5jaa	OK........close to "where?"

If you go up and ask her out it would be sweet not really romantic but i'd probably fall for it :)|`|s2wcWcu1aa	cheesy as a cheese factory after a mix-up causing extra cheese production.  but still romantic and cute :)|`|F1qHLgdtaa	Every single girl wants a date for Valentines!  Ask her!  |`|jzH53hADaa	That would be so sweet! Just as long as your confident in yourself. don't send her any texts or have a friend do it for you. Take it from me, it not that flatting if  your scared to ask her out. Good luck! I hope it works out well! :-)|`|yMLGL8APaa	it depends what the girl feels about the guy|`|8PkNZTnLaa	So Cute :) and tottaly original!|`|n5tm4cYHaa	It's totally adorable. If I were the girl I would definitely go out with you.
sM6d8ZgWaa	Don't say anything . Just breath hard and moan a little. :)|`|OxBdjqWXaa	just tell him I have the house to my self today and I am lonely. He would be there before you hang up lol|`|qy07K2k5aa	I think it's a great idea, especially if he really likes you as well. I would love it.|`|bry9Tk3Maa	uhhhhh, if he was a proper friend he should just come over, but that way might work....... O.0|`|VsLSJ65Paa	You gave....the have house to yourself?   Ok .. . haha  This sounds really foward but, whatever :] Thats what friends with benefits are for?~|`|aaBWUx7Iaa	you don need to say anything else when u say to a guy that you want him right now ,the rest is understandable *wink wink*|`|FzFSzilmaa	i'd be there before you got to the wet part... :D|`|BqIyO3x3aa	well uh i would probably high tail it over their and mentioning that your wet is a bonus for some guys|`|MW3Br5V8aa	i wouldnt say the wet part... leave it too his imagination... be better when he gets there!! :D|`|Fc4WF8Pqaa	TELL HIM YOU ARE NAKED ON YOU'RE BED AND ARE GANNA START WITH OUT HIM IF HE DOESN'T GET OVER SOON.|`|gFgltsmcaa	no tell him that your going to give him the best sex he has ever had    and that nothing will be off limits   then do it|`|wsF1bXL3aa	tell him if he's not there soon your guna do the next man who knocks on the door,that might get his interest. if he dosent show up e-mail me.x|`|kLK2peV1aa	I UNDERSTAND.  I've gots a few of those. :D  seduce him.    Say some thing like:    "Hey baby. I got the house to myself.  Come get me."  Tease him with what he wants.  Make him lose control.  It's more fun.    I have a fwb whose i seductive teaser.  : ] fun as hell|`|CI3BdOHdaa	By just saying "I want you, right now. You need to get over here" will get his butt over to ur house in a mo. But if u add ur wet, he'll get there even quicker|`|IaN18Gbfaa	lol wow, well u could mention that if u want but if i was him n u said that to me then i would rush up there n u know the rest|`|JvrrRCh6aa	Call him and tell him you got the house to yourself today an you wanna spend it with him. Don't mention stuff just let it happen an see how things get|`|qlKP0B8daa	corse he would, any boy would love a gal to ring him and say i want you come now.
vn2Lq7hIaa	He can hardly be called your ex if you only knew him one day, and he   used you then. I'm sorry I don't under stand what you mean. It sounds   like you met,you had sex and you called the next day and he said i don't know you.    If that's it, why the hell would you want to see him again. Do you like being picked up just to be diddled and dumped. I don't think so.     My advise is to forget about him,he is doing it to you because he has no respect for you. Start over again, only this time keep a do not enter sign in your pants, until you at least know him for a month.    Good Luck    God Bless|`|9zEE54e6aa	hey get outta it while u can..it will hurt but its the best wayy to stop getting hurt. there are so many guys out there that will appricate what they have and will make ur world so much better. dont let him ruin u!  good luck  steve-o|`|92n13q98aa	Because he's a jerk. Let him go, you'll be better off|`|cj41cz2Iaa	I dont mean to be rude, but if he did that, he is a complete, insensitive jerk. Thats what I am getting out of this. But he apologized and he is probably looking sad because he feels bad for hurting you. I have met guys who cry when they say or do something wrong, if you forgave him and let him back into your life, I am sure you'll forget all about what happened earlier. :) I hope I help|`|nTBxEcjIaa	he seems to just wanna use you and have you around when its "convenient" for him. if he truely liked you, he would treat you sooo much better. so, forget him and show him that your strong enough to move on. stay strong! good luck!|`|C8DOT8Y7aa	Man he is Big a jerk brake up with him.|`|6Y9zWhvHaa	why are you even wasting your time over him. get some self respect.|`|CtBVWMeoaa	um maybe he didnt like commitment so he done those things and when seeing how sad you are he has that sad face on from guilt of doing those things|`|F1qHLgdtaa	If I were you i would try to forget about him. Life is too short to waste time in a relationship where you are constantly reminded of somethign that has happened in the past. If you can't get over it - which I really couldn't blame you if you couldn't - then save your time and heartache and move on.|`|Ku6446uyaa	he played you to get back at some one you all were not even dating. If he apologized then he is sorry and he wants to make it right if he told the truth to everyone then he could be the guy of you dont let him think that you have never forgot it if you like him the tell if ok have a great day
AA10986891	I know it is annoying that she took your KIT KAT and it is rude that she then lied to your face. But is it really worth it to get this upset, I know probably she has done other annoying things and this just brought you one step closer to lossing it.    But it would be better for everyone if you let everything go. If a confrontation should occur it would not be fair to your husband to find himself in a position where he would have to take a side and it would be really awkward for your daughter that granny and mommy can not be in the same room at the same time and when they are it feels tense. I know it is hard but try your best to let it go, it will be the best for everyone.|`|Gx14PIvxaa	Let it go. Maybe she was embarrassed that she took it without asking or didn't think you would notice. Seriously, I thought this was a serious issue like she's doing somehting to your child or something. lol|`|1015550a74d6acc9fb8b60a911e82b56aa	Sorry, but it's a Kitkat, get over it.|`|T0biNswsaa	The question is what else has she done to take the piss?|`|q2WpoAf8aa	It's a Kit Kat bar! She obviously lied because she's embarrassed to have eaten it. She didn't know you were reserving it for someone else. She just saw some yummy candy and did what most people would have done. She didn't know you were bringing her a muffin. It isn't spitting on your kindness or anything personal towards you at all. She likes candy. No big deal|`|UgcPxd4maa	are you fat?? Its a friggin Kit Kat bar - who cares - shes a crazy old lady - go buy another kit kat if your that worried about it!
uwWUx1Uoaa	You definitely should stop him.  I answered your porn question too, and that's one thing, but actually having sex is completely and utterly stupid.      Trust me, I was in a situation last year where I had an opportunity, and I was THIS close to taking it. And I think of I did it would've been the worst mistake of my life.      Besides the fact that there's a pretty big chance that he's going to get her pregnant or get an STD, you should tell him that he has his reputation to worry about too. Obviously the girl is going to tell people if they do it, and secrets don't stay secret for very long. Pretty soon, your entire school is going to know about it, and your friend's relationship life is probably completely screwed. You guys are probably 8th graders, right? Trust me, your friend isn't ready. Like I said, I'm only a year older than you, but at my school, there are a lot of people in my grade getting pregnant or who have even already had babies, which is the result of having sex in 8th grade. It's just stupid. He may think he's ready, but he's not. Tell him to just wait for a while. And if he doesn't listen, I guess there's nothing you can do about it, but hopefully he'll realize it's not a good idea.|`|3NnFn5ejaa	lts do it and finish busines|`|YByGY4u3aa	Ummmm tell him he is way to young to have sex 14? ummm ya a little to young sit him down and tell him|`|4evaEQVwaa	I know your a good friend who's just concerned but he's gonna do what he wants to do regardless if you tell to or not. He's been looking at porn so that shows he already got those strong urges and more than likely he's gonna act on it.Personally I feel he should wait at least 2 years 14 is wayyyy to young to be doing those things. But if his mind is already made up then encourage him to where protection because you cant see someone and say " oh yeah she got an STD" the only way you no is when you catch it. I truely belive that one should wait until marriage but now a days thats out the window. I didnt wait and now I regret it not because I have a baby but because life would have seemed so much easier because I would be more focused on other things but anyway I hope you follow your own advice.Good Luck|`|JlNolovdaa	of course u shud! for heaven's sake he's just 14!!!|`|gM4exZNEaa	If hes gonna do it, hes gonna do it. Warn him once that you think its a bad idea, but then if he decides to carry on anyways, tell him he should at least be safe about it and use a condom.|`|bUN8FHRraa	I am not sure how you could stop him if his mind is made up. I mean you are being a good friend for think about this, but I just don't think that you would be able to do much. Has he talked to other people about this? Maybe you could go to the local clinic and get information for him or take him with you. Also tel him NO MATTER what to use something. It would be better for both of them to use something. You can get all if this at the health dept. in your area.|`|Gx14PIvxaa	If you think he would listen to your opinion, advise him. Sounds like you are pretty mature! STDs are no joke, especially at y'all's age. Your generation, I fear, is gonna see some pretty nasty stuff because sex is so commonplace. Personally, I think you should wait until you're 18 or 20 AT LEAST to have sex. I know you can't control others, but a lot of people I know feel the same way when they look back. It's a serious thing, not to be taken lightly.    Good luck!

2o3BHgCCaa	Aqua and Cranberry: 5    Tiffany Blue and Chocolate: 2|`|ECe1rgsdaa	Aqua and cranberry: 5  Blue and chocolate: 1 only because I have seen it way too many times|`|lgxE5nUoaa	Both combinations sound lovely but here are my ratings:    Aqua/Cranberry - 4   Tiffany Blue/Chocolate - 5    The Tiffany Blue and Chocolate is a great combo, you really can't go wrong with it.      I know it's a spring wedding, but the Cranberry/Chocolate combo is nice, too.  Whatever you choose, either set will be stunning.|`|O71xlcG3aa	for the aqua and cranberry i say just a 1 because i don't think i like the aqua in that combo    5 for the tiff blue and chocolate|`|F4k68ilkaa	I prefer the Tiffany Blue and Chocolate. I would rate that a 5. The chocolate tone would keep the colors from being too...flashy. It adds a more sedate and classy tone.     The Aqua and Cranberry...I think there's not enough of a 'grounding' note with the bright cranberry color. Too gaudy. I vote that a 3.|`|gK0vcdnDaa	Cran & Aqua - 3 - I'm pretty neutral with this combo    Tiff & Coco - 5 - I love this!  Someone said that it'd be too dark for a spring wedding, Chocolate can be lighter brown all the way to dark brown so its a great complimentary color.    Have fun with it and Good Luck!    -Elle|`|MkErhX7Haa	Aqua and Cranberry-5    "Tiffany" Blue and Chocolate-1    I think aqua and cran is a surprising combo and it looks really sharp.  There's some great pictures on theknot.com galleries of this combo.  The "Tiffany" blue and chocolate is way overdone, in my opinion.|`|zTPXwkp4aa	My opinion is aqua and cranberry!! I agree with the other people from your previous post that Tiffany Blue and Chocolate are more fall colors.    I am not trying to be rude but you how many times are you going to post this.|`|AsFiWxhUaa	tiffany blue and chocolate 5! these colors meld so well together and they are crisp and clean.    aqua and cranberry-2 they are so bold that no one color is going to be able to accent the other.|`|ge3meKYEaa	I think both are too dark    How about Tiffany Blue and WHITE for a spring wedding.  Brown is dark to for spring- the white keeps it clean and crisp plus it would tie in great next to a wedding dress and you could keep your flowers light colors.  Your pictures would look much more clean crisp and spring like- trust me!!|`|f6ZFjatlaa	I like the idea od aqua and cranberry. Blue and chocolate are overdone.I would go with something different.|`|caa265fc73cd7f24fe83d9a186ac1af9aa	Aqua & Cranberry - 5  Tiffany Blue & Chocolate - 1    I just hate brown at weddings.  Besides chocolate, nothing nice is colored brown - - dirt, tree bark, dog poo, etc.|`|omr1Kv3Haa	Based on my experience, pick the colors that are easiest to find - which is aqua & chocolate.  I think when its easy to find makes it less stressful & possibly less expensive. Just do the chocolate in small doses. Use lots of white and maybe some pink flowers. A beautiful combination I saw was in the Sandels informational packet - aqua & light pink.|`|GeVwijjGaa	Aqua and Cranberry-3  Tiffany Blue and Chocolate-5|`|pzDXp2cFaa	I've thought about this a lot (for me) and I love the idea of aqua and cranberry red. It's very bold... and if that's the type of personality you have definitely show it off!! My mother was not happy when I mentioned those colors to her, but she's also a very traditional person. She thinks "red" is not a proper color for a wedding. I say go for it! It's your day!    And yes The Knot has a lot of color choices.|`|G7ZTFMk5aa	Aqua and Cranberry: 5    Tiffany Blue and Chocolate: 2
8sJQP3Y4aa	Dreaming about something doesn't make it true.  Subconsciously you're worried about him being unfaithful, and something gave you reason to doubt or distrust him.  Or he didn't give you a reason at all, and you're totally happy with the relationship and trying to find fault when there is none.  I wouldn't worry about what your dreams mean.  If it makes you feel better talk to him about it, laugh about it, and you'll probably stop dreaming about it.|`|UgcPxd4maa	they're just dreams|`|sM6d8ZgWaa	If you sleep with me you'll probabley never dream about him again :)|`|6Y9zWhvHaa	no.|`|nfGDZWfBaa	I think that it means that you yourself are insecure in the relationship. and need to work that out first.|`|GVlzdZKsaa	No. He is sleeping with other guys.|`|3ee8101ef611dcb2fe20c82dfe728d6caa	If you dreamt every night you have 3 heads, does it make it true?.....It shows more about your insecurities than what he is actually doing during waking hours.|`|RYARNa8Qaa	2 points!'|`|Ku6446uyaa	no it mean you don't trust him enough learn to trust him before you think that he is cheating.|`|IKUCz1GRaa	it probly you panicing about it|`|4b5IQWcFaa	no way|`|pUvEmPrCaa	I don't think it's true.  Dreams really can't predict reality.    However, it's probably coming up in your dreams because you are worried about him cheating or thinking about him being with other girls, subconsciously.  It may have to do with your insecurities that you have or haven't addressed yet.|`|a35c4a3ab714036bfd3c31e133920f9caa	it is just stuck in your head.  don't worry about it, unless he gives you reasons or signs that indicate he is...|`|8d220f500762c84b66042158d9d97babaa	It just means you are subconsciously afraid of him cheating on you. Did a previous boyfriend cheat on you? Try to find the source of your fear and conquer it.|`|em6Sm8zcaa	LoL  No, maybe you like the guy, and u dont wanna loose  him.|`|cj41cz2Iaa	I agree with Lisa, its because you not trusting him. Let it go take a risk and trust you guy. Its not gonna kill you. Does he trust in you? If he does return that favour and trust him. I dont know the guy, but just because you have dreams about him sleeping with other girls doesn't mean its true, its just you not believing in him. And if its to the point where you can't take the dreams anymore, and you want an answer, confront you guy aout the dreams, maybe that will take the images away|`|bnEQozqZaa	no it might be just a nightmare but maybe its true maybe ur like me u can see a bit of te future like once i dreamt that golden fish died when i woke up the same fish died :'(   it may happen later but if ur parents have like seeing the future in their dreams then it might happen if no then its just a nighmare     hope this helps! ;)
el8yX5q3aa	You can contact the company and tell them the story and that you need the other one.  You CAN give back gifts...and the money would just be credited to his account.  If he notices it you can tell him it was a cheaper model you needed and knowing he was in Iraq and under enough stress you just handled it yourself.  Tell him thank you again.    He will appreciate you handling it and being honest enough to make sure he has the extra money back.|`|GqTSa85daa	Get the one on Ebay and put TI-89 Titanium series in a drawer for those time you might need it.|`|eUGOn77aaa	This question is too long!|`|679b6c2e3d98d5af9b9c37cd3490d71daa	i don't know i wasn't expecting a book i don't have all day|`|OMOuxROoaa	the one he bought is better than the 1 you need just buy the one you need for school and use the one he bought at home....who knows the one he bought might come in handy in the future. tell him somrtime after he comes back.|`|e5f4c192231c92a0d059825b151f7553aa	First - i would go to your school and explain the background.  Ask if they can make an exception for you (sometimes they are lenient that way)     That would make things so much easier.    As to the lingerie - wait till he gets back - and go shop together.  Safer, and he can see you showing :) Or imagine you in various sets...  Make sure to tell him not to send packages to your home address..  (use a PO box if you can)    If he wants to give you another gift - ask him for his safe return.|`|ksauGspUaa	uh. seriously hun    dont worry so much . its bad for your health|`|ZA11WBR2aa	You can see the one that he sent you and buy the model that you are allowed to use and when he returns, tell him then that it was not the one you were allowed to have so you traded it in.|`|IdtzdpqGaa	Just tell him that is not the one required for your courses, have it returned and exchanged for the right one, too easy|`|a429735b11d5ee8244a7769333ae26ffaa	I couldn't finish reading it.|`|lKof1n0Xaa	explain this all to him, not us.

You left, good. I would too. But now what are you going to do? I hope you don't go back to her. Trust is very hard to get back, if at all.I have been there, and I never got trust back. I left him, it has been over 35 years. I have been remarried for 32 years, And no I still don't trust the ex. Good Luck.

If he didn't mean to really hurt you and leave a mark that is painful after wards then he should defiantly say sorry. Not saying sorry makes it look like he is not sorry and thinks its ok if it happens again which makes him look a lot more like he's an abuser.  Me and my boyfriend mess around a lot and sometimes he might throw me around too much or push me too hard and i get hurt and he says "oh im sorry, im so sorry are you ok?" then we laugh it off which lets me know he didn't purposely do it and he didn't mean or want to hurt me.  Maybe one day you should "accidentally" hit him really hard and then do what he does when you get hurt and see if he wants an apology.      And I dont see 'sorry' as any form of weakness,  its acknowledging you did something you didn't mean to do and taking responsibility for knowing its k=not what You wanted to do especially if it hurt someone you care for.|`|vh0yVJ7daa	Future woman beater girlfriend basher wife basher he is scum he likes to leave bruises on you and can't say he is sorry?I see this behaviour all the time little play fights and little slaps then it gets serious he thinks you like it like all women beating scum do thats why he doesn't say sorry,He is no bf he is scum.....I garrantee if your still with him in the future you will be his punching bag.....|`|8bplNvAQaa	Stop being rough with him.  You will get hurt if you play with the big boys - we get a bit into it sometimes.    After all, its because you don't know when to stop.  What do you really want from him?      But, he SHOULD say sorry if he hurts you, regardless.  If he trod on your foot and said sorry would that make him feel like an abuser.  I always feel bad when I rough house with my girl and hurt her, no matter what.  I hate it when she gets all like that because I know I'll end up pushing her off the bed or something.  But i will say sorry.  She loves it though.  Dam.  What is she really after hey?  I know anyway, just don't give in all the time.|`|frVREVcRaa	you should stop playing so rough and do other things with him like go to the movies and stuff|`|7823c88a25415e1b637f82bb9e175c56aa	Personally I would find another form of entertainment or learn martial arts|`|QOITXwDIaa	It sounds like he just doesn't care that you are hurting.  If you aren't willing to assess your relationship and consider how selfish and mean he is, than just stop rough housing with him.  If he tries to start and you should just tell him, "I don't want to because I always end up getting hurt."  If he gets pissy over that, than hopefully you will realize that he doesn't care about your feelings at all.      I had an ex who used to do things that hurt and he would say I was faking and that I put the bruises there myself.  He never apologized.  As time went on, it turned out he didn't care about my feelings in many other ways as well.      I eventually saw the light and broke it off.  I am now happily married to someone who cares about my feelings (emotional and physical).  I hope you will find someone like that too.|`|92n13q98aa	jesus, has he pushed you down the stairs yet? next time he leaves a bruise, kick him square in the pecker.. I play rough with my gf all the time, but if i ever accidentally hurt her, i immediately apologize. The fact that he refuses to apologize because it makes him think he's abusing you is the stupidest thing I've ever heard. Get out before he cracks you over the head with a bat.|`|B0WsLzUnaa	Maybe hes paving the way for future excuses, sounds like you need a new beau... I am a big guy my wife and play around, but I have never left a bruise on her, and she bruises easily. Lay down the law, tell him no more bruise or you are gone. period. The apology thing is pride and he needs to swallow that too. He hurt you, he should be sorry.I accidently kicked my wife in the face one time when she was taking of my boots and socks (my arm was in a sling)I am very tickilish and I felt horrible I couldn't stop apologizing. Something is wrong with your picture here. Better stand back and take a good hard look.
V5PxYG17aa	You told him your problem. He tries to get you to eat. Don't you see? He does care about you. If he didn't he wouldn't try to help you. What I think he was trying to say is that you can wind up dying anyway. He doesn't want to see you kill yourself slowly. He's tried to help you but you shrug him off. He may be trying to get you to think. He is fustrated. I don't blame him. He is probably hurting inside becase of your problem. Talk to him. Let him help you. He does care....|`|4V2lk6RDaa	He is just trying to help. You are making it hard for him by not caring. I bet he only said that because he is fustrated that you are not evening trying to fatten up. Let him help, and yes he is being supportive, but your about close that he won't anymore.|`|dBkEqT2naa	It's because you talked to him about it alot. I think that he thinks your trying to get attention by bringing up your illness and he's tired of hearing you say the same thing over and over again even after he offered advice. Do something constructive about your life and make it less tiring for people to listen to you.|`|slJlLGMVaa	He's probably just fustrated that he can't do anything to help u. He's probably really worried and just wants u to be ok but doesn't know what to do anymore.  I think he still cares but just feels lost at how to help u. I'm speaking from experience, I was also anorecix and my friends got really fustrated and said some hurtful things, but they didn't mean any of it.  Hopefully this helps =] Good luck and I hope u can over come ur anorexia =]]]|`|1d86ed5e88a024daffb47bccfc5a461baa	It's hard for someone to care. If you don't care about your self first. It's very hard to watch some one you care about hurt them self's.  You have to want to get help and help is out there for you. I hope you will find it. Maybe you and your best friend can find  you help together. It's easier when you have a best friends by your side. Educate your self on why you are anorexic. Deal with your pain and I know you can get though this. Good Luck|`|4XlWLeSsaa	you are dragging it too far . meant what he said....if you can't take care of yourself then you can't help him either...its like standing next to a bomb....no sense in getting too close...respect yourself first then and only then you might respect how others feel around you..P.H
S4VVE0onaa	nothing just be yourself|`|FzFSzilmaa	sounds like he isn't interested...    but you can always just ask him out and see what happens...|`|AhCuDpU0aa	talk to him ask him to hang :)
Midbg5BJaa	Change your hair to something sexier and get yourself made up, that will change his immediate perception of you and then it will give you that window...|`|C9845Dzvaa	Start to act a little bit girlier. Wear a nice blouse,maybe a skirt on occasion.|`|nX9eoEZ8aa	any woman who can debate rock music with me....... Man that's sexy. If you could fight id marry you lol. I dunno about your mate though. Maybe you have to find someone as screwed up as I am haha  good llluck!|`|Z6ZM9p1waa	ask one out... but first make sure he knows ur not a guy!|`|45UTKuamaa	Just a thought,  tackle him sit on his chest and tell him you like him and want to be more than a buddy!  That should at least wake him up!|`|stv1JMXNaa	You could wear make up and change your hair. Also, try different clothes. Be yourself when you're with him, try and make jokes, but make sure you know that he'll laugh at them. About them calling you dude, well around here, anyone can be called a dude. It doesn't really mean anything unless you're the only one they call it. They might just do it because you're close to them and are always with them, so they feel okay with it.|`|nxh8xxQvaa	Talk to him, explain your feelings. Obviously they need to realize that you're a girl somewhere down in there. If you tell them your feelings, you have better chances of them seeing you in a different way.|`|4b5IQWcFaa	ask him out first?|`|JSqc3dDBaa	flirt with him.. dress kinda girlish.. but don't lose the rocker edge. that's always hot.. n ur athletic so use that to ur advantage know what i mean?|`|AsFiWxhUaa	it is all in the way you cary yourself. all of my boyfriends started off as my guy friends. i am kind of a girly girl but i love sports and i like to play them . my guys friends say that is a turn on for them  best of luck|`|ZUw8DBJVaa	liking sports and rock music doesn't mean you have to look like a boy...the next time a party comes up wear the prettiest sexiest girliest dress (remember sexy but not slutty) , put on some make up (don't over do it) , make up your hair, and stop talking to him about football...... that's how i got my last boyfriend....|`|PpYl2dFVaa	ive been there when i was in the 6th grade  i was a tom boy too  i think its just something you grow away from   maybe just ask him to hang out sometime like watch tv or something lame then when you do ask him questions   like see if hes into anyone and stuff   he may not have even realized you were an option probably just assumed u werent interested   but ill tell u this  as you get older  more and more and more men start to like women into sports|`|fHHeal1Vaa	because i believe my female energy is so strong, when a man is forbiden, like a husband of a friend or so, or when i know there is way in a million years to have a conversation with him let alone make love "my way", i dont have that female energy at all. it is easier that way. it is for the one I want. or have a chance with. you know i will find somebody if you dont take me. maybe for making love only. marriage of course. once a day making love with a person that loves me and therefore I love is a sufficient assurance I come to end of my days in a natural way. I dont have a lot of goals. He put me through so much that He only wanted me to stay alive. Imagine how little He will ask from me NOW!|`|whoHoGjuaa	ehmm ,, !! why don't you stop acting like a guy ,, !! try to wear dresses,put some make up and don't tie your hair if it's long and try to be more girly .. !! and am sure he'll notice you ,,! and you can talk to him about your feelings towards him 
BhXOLas1aa	You poor thing, your heart must hurt so much, I'm so sorry.  Your husband has broken your trust and you will never be able to totally trust him again.  I would personally get a solicitor and start divorce proceedings, there is no way that he can take your children from you if you are a good mother. He will be allowed access rights to see them, you don't have to see him if you don't want to.  Remember that in the 6 years that you have been a housewife, you have had an important job in your relationship. You have looked after the home and children, which has enabled him to work. So you are equal in this partnership. This is how the law see's it, so don't worry about his stupid threats.  I also believe that you should not jump into another relationship straight away especially as the other man is in the middle of a divorce too. Be friends and support each other until you both are able to cope with the emotional turmoils of divorcing.  Your husband will have to support his children and provide a home for you. He is the one who broke the marriage, not you.  Please speak to a lawyer/solicitor as soon as you can. You need real legal advice so you know exactly what to expect.  Please don't let your husband stay, he will only cheat again. He loved someone more than you, get rid of him, you are worth more than that.|`|fMxVDps3aa	Well honey guess what. I know where you are coming from. First, don't stay if you aren't happy. Don't jump right into another relationship too soon. You can get by without him. It is hard to get used to. But you will see how much stronger you are without him. I am going through that too only I did jump into another relationship. My kids are my life to and he doesn't even see them all that much. 4 days a month if they are lucky. Go to school. You wouldn't believe how much there is out there for single moms. It is tough but it is amazingly rewarding to be able to say you are everything to your children.  Housewife or not, you are a woman and you are a mother which makes you stronger than you even know right now.|`|ddP3klT3aa	Get marriage counseling and get at least a part time job. Staying at home is nice, but women seldom think "What if we divorced?" No education and no work experience to fall back on. All women need it. Don't leave for another man. Leave for yourself. You also need therapy to learn to trust again. You don't need to jump into another relationship immediately because you may have problems trusting this man. You need time to take care of you. Also, if you leave for another man, your husband could use that against you in the custody battle. Try to work it out. Get yourself together and start working again. Maybe take online classes.|`|vh0yVJ7daa	Go for it get your own back on your husband.....|`|winmjHAmaa	My friend is going through this.  She has decided that she cannot live with the pain any longer.  They will, in most cases, lean toward the mother having custody of the children.  The fact that he cheated on you (and your family) leads me to beleive that you will get sole custody.  Don't worry about that.  You have to do what's right for you and your children.  Your home is already broken due to your husbands actions.  It's scary, but move on.  You and your children deserve so much more.|`|NNHdkLDWaa	Divorced fathers get to see their kids I do not see why you should not get visitation.|`|3ccacc540edb8d292ca1dabc548ee002aa	Honestly, I would leave my husband if he ever did that to me.  Cheating for sex is one thing but he's cheating and in love with another woman.  That is so beyond betrayal in my book.  Don't leave your husband for another man.  Leave his because you can't trust him.  That trust was broken and I don't think anyone can ever fully recover from that.  How could he say you would never get the kids?  If he's gone on business all the time he would never be able to take care of them . . . not being a good parent.  You would get them.  If you've been their primary caregiver all these year I find it hard to believe a judge would hand custody over to your husband.  Do the right thing, think really hard if you would ever be able to get over the fact that he cheated.  If not, get out of the marriage.
8II1frHiaa	she is not acting.  she feels that you are not equal to her in sharing jokes or fun.  First, you should understand that the girl you are mensioning is just a friend only.  she may feel happy when more friends are around her.  it is natural.  you should avoid finding fault of her every movement.  To continue her friendship be sportive and join the friends and laugh with them, she may like you.  if you are serious or getting jealousy, no will come as a friend. ok?|`|dBkEqT2naa	Because she probably thinks that you might think she's an idiot for acting that way. Or she thinks that you're the type of person who might do stupid things like make a comment about grammer, or do something to prove that she's inferior to you.|`|z3ZdnJtAaa	she may be not comfortable around you or like what candlewood had told already that she probably thinks that you might think she's an idiot for acting that way.
tkacoC0haa	kill the dumb bastardd    then youll be king of pride rock and you can fukk all the lions whenever you want|`|uwWUx1Uoaa	Ok, well judging by the way this is written, I'm going to assume this is your idea of a sick joke. But just in case it's not...      There's this thing called "the law". When you kill someone, you are breaking this "law" I speak of. When you break the law, you go to jail, and are generally repeatedly violated by angry men.       By the way, how is a recent trip to Africa "several years ago"?? Mhmm...    Anyway, don't kill him. Just find a way to exploit him for the fat bastard he is so HE goes to jail and gets fucked every night by angry men ;)|`|dnfjdbSOaa	and wats ur name....simba ???|`|UgcPxd4maa	Lion King|`|PwVrqyIGaa	Hmmm...your story's very familiar...*thinks* oh i know...it's almost exactly like 'The Lion King' lol|`|f6a7A85Gaa	I wouldn't. Maybe you could hurt him some other way, but you shouldn't kill him.|`|MUDDyIKtaa	Well its sounds like your writing a book or making a movie! And first you said your trip was recent and then you say you ran for several years, which is it? but my answer would still be don't do it.|`|WOHc22Xiaa	The first thing I thought about was the lion king! I love that movie! Your not really gonna kill your uncle. Besides if you take him from here without him wanting to go that's kidnapping and then if you kill him no matter where it is its murder and the law does apply dumb dumb! Some ppl are idiots on here!

Something like this is personal and should not be sent anywhere. I am not some religious finatic, just a grown woman who has a bit of common sense I want to share with you. You are degrading yourself and if he wants this or even has suggested such a thing get yourself a new man...one who respects you.|`|bry9Tk3Maa	NOT all men are jerks like the person above me said, just some lingrire photos be good, nothing so nude n if he was real gentlemen he wouldnt show around|`|CRhS02q8aa	Don't Do It!

They were not revealing down there but they still had sex appeal. I would probably say to you to wear some sexy lingerie as the main purpose is to tease rather than display and leave his imagination to do the rest. Plus this way if you ever breakup you won't be so worried if he posted them on the internet!!!(or showed them to his mates)|`|Fc4WF8Pqaa	http://www.nsgalleries.com/belladonna/14...|`|Tl40qXrzaa	I'd say play dress up with it. Sexy looks that he doesn't see you in normally.     For real though, I GUARANTEE the pics will get out to the masses, so just use your discretion. I ain't telling you not to do it. But I've received wild pics of ex girls (or current ones) from friends, and friends of friends, at least a dozen times.   There's a ton of blogs and websites out there devoted to these "revenge" pics. So have fun, but be warned.
uJ9waJDYaa	Having ONLY money isn't enough for a happy life. You can live your life but you may feel empty. Without having someone to love or even some close friends or freedom to do what you want within reason life wouldn't be worth it even with loads of money.|`|417a83c7cb091ac86d2ec601c9b825e2aa	what ? ~|`|e8f304081fca5eabe282a819a91143f3aa	correct!|`|YBU4x9IMaa	Huh??|`|YyVGXt83aa	It isn't the most important thing but be very careful.  My ex would accuse me of being obsessed with money.  She was spending well above our means and then took off with a welder.  Now I'm stuck with 5 years of debt and she just starts over so I actually should have been worrying about the money more.  I think she just did this to overspend and get what she wanted since she knew she was just using me.
RC8Pxx8eaa	There are no rules on this kind of thing, if you and he are happy having sex 6 times a week then that is fine for you. Sex should not be counted by number but by the love and emotion felt for each other whenever you make love.  Some people have sex a couple of times a month but its what they want, some couples have more sex than others but its up to the couples involved and nobody else.  When sex becomes orientated it loses its spontaneity.|`|60b0d42c3c92dec6d976704c90ee8eb5aa	It don`t come much better than that.|`|qy07K2k5aa	It is much much more than enough.|`|VsLSJ65Paa	Thats plenty, haha I think the ideal for most people is 3-5 times/week.|`|fMpKj0DYaa	Mmm....i think it just depends. Just do it when you both want to. How many times you have sex really differs from every relationship. I think if you are concerned about it you should just openly talk to him about it. I mean it is your guys sex life, you should be able to openly discuss it with each other.|`|gFgltsmcaa	thats enough for two days maybe|`|gCP6uZOvaa	Sounds like plenty|`|pDptioSNaa	I think he is cheating on Day   7.

eTTkAv9Yaa	Tell him that his eating habits are starting to affect you, that it makes you feel fat and you think you'll start a diet and exercise regime too - basically let him know hat his eating disorder is rubbing off on you - if he is worth his salt as a father he will see the potential damage and at least make a point of looking after himself while you are around, which is a start, if it doesn't make him open his eyes and see his problems for what they are.  He seems to have food issues, or is he just cutting down because he used to eat way too much?  We don't need to eat as much as we get older as we slow down and our bodies don't need as much energyu.|`|y4SUDnpaaa	Just tell him outright that you noticed he is barely eating, you're worried about his health and you are wondering if he should see a doctor to see if there is a physical  reason.   If he is not receptive to you or your ideas, you have no choice but to let it be.He's a grown man and has a right to live his life the way he wants and you will have fulfilled  your obligation to let  him know you are very worried.|`|DMhAPurkaa	I m guessing in the dark here as to why this is even happening.  He may be reacting to stress.  This is something he can control, if he cannot control or change something in his life that he would like to. This may keep his mind off of the situation he wants to avoid or doesn t know how to solve.  He may be ill and trying to get well.  His cholesterol may be up and he is trying to lower his levels, and do exersize to help his heart.  He may have lost his appetite due to stress or illness or maybe his mind is busing thinking and he isn t interested in eating. Men are problem solvers and he may be working on some problem in his work or life.  Perhaps what he used to eat he doesn t like anymore, but he doesn t know what to eat instead. Or maybe he is trying to eat healthier, so he has cut out things he used to eat , but hasn t put back in the healthy things. A new habit is hard and takes time and thought and trying new things.  How does he feel?  Sad?  Tired?  Good?  If he doesn t feel like eating first thing in the morning, maybe he would like a fruit smoothie .  For peace of mind please continue to watch your dad and do some research such as http://www.byron yoga.com/articles/ayurveda/37-health/89-...  How lovely of you that you care about your dad so|`|66a2033899b05175e184558f79110fe4aa	cook for him, be really sad if he doesnt eat it all, bat your eye lids, say pleeeeeeeeeas...|`|n0MxemfYaa	Give him an ultimatum.

417a83c7cb091ac86d2ec601c9b825e2aa	He will only have to pay for 2, unless you can prove with DNA that the 3rd is his.|`|RjpPzbBJaa	If he is the father of the third child, you should have him added to the birth certificate. If there are any questions about paternity, then the court/judge will likely have a DNA test ordered. Once he is found to be the father of the child, then he will be ordered to pay child support for all 3 children, if you have been given full custody of them.
pVnUhYLQaa	You HAVE to talk to her about this. You HAVE to. I swear most of the questions on this site are people who are having problems because they are not communicating with each other. She is your wife, she should be the one with whom you confide in, who knows all of your likes and dislikes, your kink and your fetish's. This is so sad to me, that people who are married and/or in committed relationships with each other can't even talk to one another. You 2 should be in sex toy and video stores together, picking stuff out together and then going home together and enjoying it together. She should know all of your sexual fantasies (assuming they're legal) and you should know hers. What you just told us here on yahoo answers you should be telling her. Maybe not so bluntly, you need to soften it up a little, but, you need to say "I want to talk about sex..." and go from there. If you can't talk about it you can't do it. Communicate with her. A marriage without communication is doomed.|`|4qT0TfMZaa	Well, you sure as hell can't have it with me!|`|M3maZgdyaa	Introduce your films slowly start with a few role playing games (in bed) move on to fantasy's then movies.

6b8cbbdcbfb34ad6e49d598a03f113a0aa	Do you want to win your love back?   Are you sad that your partner has broken up and do you want his love again?     If u have tried but he is not reciprocating,u may have begged him to give you love and when you do not get it, you feel shattered. My advice is that unless you are very sad do not try that any more. If you think that life is becoming difficult without your partner then let us see what you can do.    Reflect upon the period preceding the breakup.   Did you change towards your partner?   Were you less attentive or less loving?   Were you taking your love for granted?   Think about all the mistakes you may have committed. If you find that you were not the reason, then better give up the idea. You can only do something about lost love, if you caused it. If you find that you were probably the reason then arrange a meeting and apologize for all your mistakes. Promise never to do same thing again. You may probably win your love back or else break up, the relationship may be becoming one way and may lead to a disaster again.

She must leave her husband's home, and divorce him before you should see her in a romantic way.|`|vh0yVJ7daa	Get over yourself dude she doesn't love you she loves the fact she is screwing you behind her husbands back and has not yet been caught,She was forced into the marriage?Is she muslim?You do know the price you pay for screwing a muslim mans wife if they are real strict law obeying muslims?Infact screwing anymans wife for that matter,She is a hoe who can't keep her legs shut so she tells you the sob story "My husband doesn't treat me right" then after she has had sex with you she goes home to hubby and tells him how much she loves him,While you like a mug play the waiting game thinking she is going to divorce the husband,I've been there before mate getting involved with another mans wife is just a fantasy but come reality their is prices to pay and in the end she never leaves the husband to be with you,Get yourself your own woman dude she is a hoe and if I where you I would just tell the husband what a cheating hoe he has for a wife|`|a3ODeDf0aa	it can be hard to let go of what you think MIGHT be someday, but if she is not willing to let go of her marriage than maybe there is more to her relationship with her husband than she is leading you to believe, and possibly just using you for the emotional attention that she might not be getting fully from her husband. try to talk to her and get out of her what she REALLY wants and what she would be willing to do for her realtionship with you. i don't think that it is healthy to persue the relationship if she is married. it is cheating, and not to mention, if she can cheat on her husband, she is capable of doing it to you as well. i hope everything works out for you!|`|AA11349925	If this was a woman talking about a married man I can't help but think the responses would be a lot harsher and foul mouthed.

By the way, most wives have sex with their husbands....its a very very popular thing to do.|`|lGqx66zAaa	Hi, i really don't think its a good idea getting involved seeing that by law they are married whether it was willfully or not.

54042690d0ee8dda741121976af71b28aa	I just don't get why you couldn't realize this before she was married. I'm not sure how long you two have been friends but you've probably had plenty of opportunities to start a romantic relationship with her.    Also, not to put you down but guys like you are why many men are uneasy with girlfriends & wives having male friends. If you're a true friend, you will respect her marriage.|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	Your last chance to tell her was in April of 2008.  Stop talking to her and get on with your life.|`|zllFsqMYaa	did u realize this before she got marry or after ask yurself that first then tell her|`|jROpVbrhaa	Leave her alone and go on with your life.|`|xGshAiXOaa	Too little too late.  If she is unhappy, then let her make her own choice without your feelings clouding her thoughts.  If she gets divorced, give her some time and then tell her.  If she doesn't, then she obviously isn't that unhappy; and as a friend, you need to let her be.|`|TAufQoc7aa	The best thing you can do is be honest with her. But if she shoots you down be prepared to feel awkward for a while.    Good luck...|`|7ziKvIIpaa	kiss her shell relize she  luvs u to|`|3996c86c61103007ffe22b481f70f0bcaa	You keep quiet.  If she chooses to leave her husband, she needs to make that decision independent of your feelings for her.|`|TqWXXZ34aa	Your friend got married. If she wasn't sure or liked you and wanted to be with you she would have never gotten married.  You also need to consider cutting the friendship with her a little if you have feeling for her now they will get stronger in time. Even so strong that you could be the reason why she divorces her hubby. it is not healthy for her to call you up and tell you that she isn't happy. Your emotions start to run wild with a comment like that. She is probably wondering if the grass is green on the other side. Meaning with you. I would give her space and tell her that marriage isn't always a bowl of cherries that it is tough. Give it time... Be there for her a friend but that is it. Don't have an affair with this women either . Just be here friend. it is too late don't you to tell her that you loved her. You should have done that be4 she got married. It's too late!|`|MUDDyIKtaa	you need to continue to be her friend, cause if she really is not happy she will need you when the walls come tumbling down. KISS HER , no way. If her marriages fails do you want that on your lap that it could of been your fault. Any chance she is playing you with those comments of not being happy, to see what you will say. Maybe she knows how you feel. You are truly in a tough predicament, but you need to do the right thing. She needs to get out of her marriage for the substanial factual reasons, not because of someone else.|`|AA11043633	Stay quiet.  I'm sure you don't want your friends' marriage to be ruined because of you. She may did told you that she is not happy, I guess it's her husband turn now to make her happy anyway, she did marry him.

You should always tell the truth about your experience because sooner or later it will come out.     But, just try to express that you value teamwork because it lends to generating ideas on accomplishing something and helps individuals grow. If you can, use an example of when you were part of team to show your experience.|`|qy07K2k5aa	I don't think this is the right category.|`|PpYl2dFVaa	say you enjoy working as a team to get more ideas and approaches     really you would need to know the type of work your applying for because this question could be important   you may also need to make sure you let them know you like working as a team however you work efficiently on your own as well  would just depend how you answer that as to what the job is|`|tupKcZuGaa	This does not mean that you have to share all anything that doesn't put you in a positive position though. The key is to be honest and only bring up examples that are going to highlight your talents and work history in the best possible way. Don't claim or state anything that cannot be backed up by your references.

IzsGakLRaa	Who knows, just because you were a good girlfriend doesn't mean you're not worth breaking up with.Were you clingy, were you am emotional basket-case? You have to ask HIM why, we haven't a clue...|`|KDst9z5Naa	That was very kind of you to help him . When a guy loses his job, it can effect your self worth as an individual. He might feel bad that you had to help him and was not independent . You may want to try to talk to him about trying to go out again. He maybe just upset about losing his job and acted badly. Guys make mistakes sometimes  when they are under pressure and depressed. I hope this gives you a little bit of clarity about your situation.|`|ks2oieV0aa	Don't stress him right now, be his friend.  xox|`|VPJJdYCNaa	dude that sux. i dont rlly kno...i kno ur prolly rlly upset, but this guy doesnt sound like the rite guy. he used you n then broke up with you. try to find someone else and keep a distance from this guy.|`|lHPdGgvTaa	He may have felt like you were baby-ing him and men don't like that.  Also are you sure his roommate isn't telling you what you're boyfriend wants you to hear?|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	you may have unknowingly made so much of an investment in the relationship that he felt excluded. In other words, you did too much for him and that made him feel that he couldn't 'invest' in your relationship. Some guys like to feel independent. That's where he is going with this.    If you can find and keep a balance of give and take then you might be able to get your relationship back on track.|`|8d220f500762c84b66042158d9d97babaa	Here are three possibilities for the break up:    1. Using you as a crutch was helpful but enabling for him. He needed to gain control over himself and except responsibility and start doing for himself.     2. Your help was suffocating him.     3. It's hard for some men to accept so much help from a woman, especially when it comes to paying their bills. Perhaps that made his depression worse because he didn't feel like a 'real man' if you know what I mean.     I hope this man at least thanked you for all your help and offered to pay you back when he gets back on his feet! Since you guys are still hanging out, you two might get back together in the near future but don't push him. He's going through a hard time right now.     If he hasn't shown appreciation for your help, then I wouldn't even be friends with him and I would not wish to get back together.|`|ypnWDDB8aa	You may have damaged his masculinity?  Not on purposeofcourse but I think he wants to prove he doesn't need any help.|`|19sa1ITfaa	he was mad ask him back out if u really want him flirt with him tell him how much u want him if u want him back if u dont just leave it at that!|`|92n13q98aa	The only thing in your question that could lead to a reason why he broke up with you is that you were doting on him at a time when he probably felt pretty crappy already about not having a job. But, that would be a pretty lame excuse, so I doubt that's it. Something else happened. Email me if you want to talk about it more.|`|gEx05xSKaa	Perhaps he found his independence from you. You may have scared him by doing so many  things for him. After he realized this he may have decided to revamp everything in his life including you. It is not even your fault really, he could be embarassed by his previous situation or maybe he thinks you are holding him back. Either way you are probably both better off as friends. Who knows, he may see you in a new light as your friendship progresses.|`|sFKgWed0aa	It happens when a person is in stress. Friend in need is a friend in deed.Its Ur time to help him come out of stress. Fight and go away is not the answer to this.|`|5BIIG6Qwaa	It sounds like he was ashamed of not being able to care for his self much less you. With men money is pride and with out money, Well lets just say we are our own worst enemy. It hurts a mans pride to accept money from a girl friend so he has to do something to make his self feel useful.|`|427474e9b9e4f46a16d65e677dc54d68aa	It's really hard to say what this means because we can't read his mind.  We can give you many different interpretations and unlimited scenarios... but there could easily be some other underlying issues that we don't see or know about.    The best way to find out what this means would be to talk to him about it.  If he doesn't want to talk (like he's stated) then it may be difficult to figure out.  If anything since you know him best you could probably piece it together much more easily than we can.    You could try to approach him with a talk by saying that you need to know "why" in order to be friends with him.  Tell him that you need some closure and to understand his side and his feelings etc.  You could tell him to be fair to you that he should give you an explanation.    If he's adamant about not wanting to talk it could be a pride/ego thing or he could be hiding something.  Maybe you can get some clues from his roommate.    If I got help from my GF to me she'd be a keeper.  I would know without a doubt that she cared about me and I would do everything in my power to be a better man for her, take care of her, and repay her generosity.  His behavior IMO is somewhat peculiar.  Even if he's "prideful" (and you bruised his ego) he did accept your help... he shouldn't be upset about it now.  Just my opinion.    Good luck... hope things work out for you either way.
IzsGakLRaa	You cant make someone 'love' you. Just be yourself and let it naturally happen. ?|`|QQv8f1vRaa	i think you should tell her how you feel. There is no reason to stay hooked on someone if you don't even know if they are into you. The worst thing that could happen is she dosent feel the same but thats better than not knowin at all..right. :)|`|PD9x9Oioaa	there is no way of getting someone to like you, unless u act like something ur not but it sounds like u really like her so don't pretend to be something ur not. just get to know her and show her what kind of guy u our and eventually tell her how u feel

How ridiculous. But I am extremely paranoid and I tend to look over my shoulders quite often...I suppose I'd suspect a stalker or foul-play.|`|7fsHAF2maa	The thing is, you wouldn't know that they're watching you, so everything would be happy days, unless something like this question crossed your mind. Still, I wouldn't get too worried about it.    And, also, people are quite perceptive. If someone was looking at you weirdly in a store, you can sometimes feel eyes in the back of your head, then I'm sure something would click.    Again, you'd have to have done something wrong/be suspected of doing something wrong, which isn't something very common place.    Interesting "question" though. I can bet that it's not happening to me, pretty high.|`|U4V6TkZEaa	Why to go, dip h t.

No I would "not" cheat.It "isn't" worth it for me because of the hell I went through.|`|79eBn6V8aa	Yep, I do.  I don't know if I'd attempt a serious relationship with one, but the attraction is there for sure.  I'm single though so I don't know about the cheating thing.|`|3VwquAraaa	No. I am 35 and I don't find college guys attractive. I would rather have someone with maturity before youth.|`|RMYidmGaaa	Answer is yes.  Most older women go for the younger guys.  It gives them a sense of security.  Plus they don't have the wrinkles :p|`|agJ53hEXaa	yes i find younger men very appealing,infact i had a relationship with a guy who was 19 and i was 35,it lasted 2 years,he thought it was fab and said he learned everything from me,i thought it was fab too,he had no hang ups or responsibilities and was just fun,fun and more fun.i did eventually end it though because he started to annoy me with his immaturity,things like spending 12 hours on xbox and not bothering to walk dog,etc...    i would not cheat on my 60 year old live in partner as i don't have one,i like same age or younger men.my new hubby is same age but looks 10 years younger,bonus!!!!!!  i would add that most women if honest would prefer a younger man...    cute question...

To get over hurt you need to find joy. You might be hurt now but you will fall in love again and it will all be a faded memory before you know it. Life is too short to spend time worrying about why some one cheated on you. Live your life to the fullest and you will be great.|`|uJ9waJDYaa	People cheat for all different reasons. It is wrong but doesn't mean that, that person should be automatically hated just for some bad action/s they made which they might think of as a mistake or just a bad impulse they acted on.  I mean Id rather hate someone who raped someone than any of my partners who might have cheated.    In one way be thankful that person from an old relatinship cheated on you and you found out because it's just giving you reason to move on from that person and get closer to meeting 'the one'. Of course it wouold have been easier to have broken up for other reasons, but it gives you another reason to not go back to them.|`|h9XhZyoYaa	Hmm, I have been kind of cheated on and I felt exactly the same. But for your own self esteem you shouldn't think about it. Try and do other things, get new interests, don't do things that you did with your partner and it's best not to talk to them. However, people make mistakes and they are not necessarily bad people for cheating, it is a wrong action, a stupid action...and people make mistakes. But I got myself into assignments and stuff and it really helped me, and talking to friends and the like. Just surround yourself with positive energies. It's a self esteem thing and you just have to know that you have wonderful attributes and not put yourself down because of this experience!    Good luck and I hope you are feeling better soon :)
QYv6VI99aa	People that Bully other People usually, have very low Self-esteem ~ They don't think very highly of themselves, & They need that extra attention. So they feel if they pick on someone else it makes themselves look bigger & better. The real Truth is, It only makes them look Smaller, & Weak.  I suggest to Your Friend, To tell a Teacher, or her Parents, or talk to the Principal about it. Tell her Friends. Make it clear and open, & Show the Bully They can NOT Bully You around. Keep persisting until something is done about the situation. Of course The Bully is going to be upset because He/She is Losing. They don't want People or Adults to know. Well Too Bad for them. They need to experience the Feeling of "SOMEONE WHO CARES" & That Someone will be the Person who Helps You or Your Friend, & Them ~ To do the Right Things in Life.   & Another Guarentee ~ That Will Work ~ Pray To GOD, Ask Him to help You in this situation, He Always Hears, & He Will Always Help you in every situation. At the same time when You Pray to GOD ~ Believe that He Will Help You & He Will. Also start reading the Bible, It's Free & So Helpful. GOD knows Our Hearts & He knows what is Good For Us. & He wants Us to Read His Word ~ Which is the Bible, & He wants Us to Pray to Him, & Talk to Him, & To do Good to others.  GOD is Love & GOD is Good & Everything Good comes from GOD.  & When You recieve "That Goodness" When things are Looking Good, & Things in Your Life or Your Friends Life are going better ~ Then THANK GOD For it!  & Keep doing this & Your life Will have Good things to come.  GOD Bless You & Your Friend & The Bully.  Remember GOD Will always help You!|`|4evaEQVwaa	yeah that restraining orders gonna work by 3oclock what an idiot to say that.

Good Luck.And for a couple of pointers1) dont ever fall on the ground or youll get stomped 2)if you start losing grab any thing and hit her with it like garbage cans, chairs , bottles 3)take your sock off and fill it up with rocks and keep it in ya pocket just in case you need to wild out on her a** if you start losing.(i no i keep writing "you" but its really advice for her)4) Make sure a buntch of you guys friends are there to witness it because if all else fail jump her a**|`|BhxycGViaa	id call the police let them know whats going on have a restraining order against her i think that will do it good luck

W5wCArLqaa	Ummm, you guys should consider sex therapy.|`|Kr09aQJkaa	This is not normal. Either he is depressed, having side effects from medication or having an affair.    Something is going on and I have a feeling it's an affair by his reaction to the question. It seems he wasn't as angry about you asking if he was gay. Very suspicious! Start some investigating.    Edit: Oh maybe it's not an affair? It is possible that he doesn't feel part of the family. Some men do this. They come home and the activites are going, the wife has a handle on everything and he doesn't know his place. When he comes home don't look exhausted and don't ask for help as hard as that may be. Act very happy to see him, have his dinner ready and have everyone sit down to eat together, ask about his day and compliment him. Say things like "you handled that well", "you work so hard", "we are proud of you". Tell him what a great provider he is and how much the kids love their giving, involved father. Do this faithfully for at least two weeks then start building his sexual ego. Flirt with him during the day, grab him as he walks by and say cute, sexy things.     Treat him like you want him to behave. If you want a sexual man treat him like one. If you want an involved father act as though he is one. This works in the same way as when someone puts you down, says your ugly and you start to believe it and feel rotten. Reverse the senario and you'll get a positive response. Treat him like he is all of those wonderfull things and he will try his best to live up to your expectations.|`|0d0W0nbVaa	yeah, i have a suggestion.  dump the limp MF*er and get something with a pulse.|`|jROpVbrhaa	Convince him see a doctor.thats unfair.|`|145c8348c6805dffd8ad539dedd6effbaa	When you mentioned another female and he exploded, that should have been a signal.  The answer is yes.  Don't get mad; get a divorce.  There are plenty of good men out there who would make you a fine husband.  Why waste you time on a person who obviously doesn't care about you anymore?|`|DkAY3oNbaa	Go see a counselor.  Something is going on that you don't know about.  It may not be an affair but men don't just turn off like that without a reason.|`|AA10348638	Guys don't understand that sex means affection and that is what us females crave..I would sit him down and talk to him honestly..I would ask him the problem..the real problem..and then suggest a counselor...maybe that could help..Don't feel bad..I feel like I have to beg my husband for sex..I just don't understand it..It makes me feel awful so I know how you feel..Good luck!|`|92n13q98aa	9 months without sex? Yeah something's seriously wrong. Does he have a ridiculously stressful job or something?|`|g7PuU0dgaa	Do you think he may be stressed? Even the funnest things can become a hassle when you've got too much on your shoulders. You could try changing it up a bit, maybe he's bored.    Also, men who cheat usually enjoy the thrill of sleeping with their wife AND the other girl. Not saying that it isn't probably. Although males can't simply "turn gay" so you shouldn't accuse him of that.|`|8bplNvAQaa	The problem can be summed up as,  you're spending too much time together, and he's playing with the wii.  You need to sort it out somehow.  The wii is a distraction from reality.  he's stressed.    I don't get it if your initiating sex and its not happening.  If it was a 2 minute wonder then maybe that would make more sense.    You need to get away somewhere and make him fell less depressed, that's the problem.  Don't push him and make him feel like a man again (somehow) then he'll want to tear your clothes off.    Maybe a little time a part, but careful with this one.    you're probably rubbing it in his face at the moment too.|`|10d29030429ea7a1527ba8f23128d41eaa	I completely understand what your going through. your not a alone. Maybe there is a medical reason as to why he can't do it. Just maybe he is ashamed to share it with you. If you can get him to the Dr's maybe you can find out if there is something medically wrong. That is all i can think of. Beside he is still too young to just turn down sex so my best bet is a medical issue.|`|wUXDKIbuaa	1. You get counseling  to help you out and maybe he'll go after a while. Don't count on him going but let him know that it is available to him and it would help your marriage.    2. He needs a medical check up, maybe he has low testosterone and has no libido. Blood pressure meds. can cause a decrease in libido and he may need to change his meds once again.    3.  His job could be very stressful and he is not telling you tings always change at work and just because he was fine before doesn't mean his job duties haven't changed. Maybe he's in fear of losing his job. Just the stress alone of this would put a damper on your psyche. Besides working as a correctional worker seems like it would take a toll on your mental health.  Being surrounded all day long with the dregs of society would put a sour outlook on life.  I would think there would be counselors there at his work to help with the officers.   4.  Quit nagging him and let him be.  You are driving a nail into the coffin.   Pull back and stop nagging.  Do simple kind gestures for him, pack him a lunch and leave him a love note, leave him a note in his car, give him a massage when he relaxes on the couch or before bedtime.  Don't ask just do and don't expect anything in return.  He may turn around after random acts of kindness and no nagging.|`|lYZ71zYAaa	I highly doubt that this is a health problem. Come on he is 31 and doesn't want to have sex with you! Sorry but he is getting it somewhere else. I have been through this with my ex husband. I was 26 and he was 27, he told me the same thing I'm tired , I have too much on my plate, work is so hard. Bull sh*t. I found letters in our car in the glove box.from an other women, And finally someone told me that they saw him at a bar with a women. The reason he got so mad at you for asking if he was seeing someone else, was because you were right and he didn't know what else to say, so he put you on the defensive, and tried to make you out as the bad guy. Your going to have to look for more proof.  I could go on and on but you have to decide for yourself, I just gave you my opinion, from my experience. Good Luck. Just read your Additional details maybe being around criminals all day long depresses him, Or maybe he is gay, who knows what goes on behind closed doors. I'm at a loss.again Good Luck.|`|YBISOapbaa	you need serious help.!
sM6d8ZgWaa	Hang out with me i"ll make sure you get nothing LOL|`|Ff7VS8lQaa	Either just do your best to ignore it, or gather together any of your friends who are also single and have a night out.|`|KT0UTX8taa	Being single is not that bad, Im not single , but Im also not a fan of this event:)  Maybe stay at home, or go face to face with those teddy bear enemies!|`|Q2UDhYgkaa	Do something nice for yourself. Go shopping or cook a nice meal for yourself. I'm single but I'd rather be than settle for a guy just because I want someone around for V-Day.|`|Bsf78pfsaa	I am single and I love getting things for my friends. I don't think about not being in love with a man I always buy flowers for my mom and sister and I try to make sure that they know I love them.

Have a blast being single even on the national day of love.|`|SR1FN2nqaa	im so glad i ran across this question. im single and requested the day off of work so i could go out to eat. im going to do something for myself and take my son as well. being single isnt a bad thing, although i can totally understand were your coming from. all the hype does get you depressed a little but as i said im going to turn it into something positive for me and have a great day....|`|fYzXwMNIaa	Good question... I'm wondering the same thing. I even have school that day. I'll have to endure seeing every1 with roses in their hands and stuff.. Oh man.. I guess I'll just act normal like nothing is bothering me and the day will pass just fine.
yhEDUN6qaa	It doesn't seem like a good reason to leave the father of your child if everything else is good. But there is no reason he should be calling you disrespectfull names like that. Have you talked about it to him? Have you told him how you felt? If not, you need to. Tell him that if he respects you he would not say things like that and you don't need your kid or little sister learning words like that.|`|SsI4LLUZaa	Why are you with him?  He's a horrible influence n your son and has no respect for you.  And you says he's alcoholic?  This sounds like it will escalate into abuse in a few years.|`|0d0W0nbVaa	you know how pot is a starter drug for something a lot heavier like heroin?  every wife beater starts out with calling their wives  the B word.    leave.    now.|`|3ee8101ef611dcb2fe20c82dfe728d6caa	You are the one that gave the ultimatum. If he called you a ***** and you haven't left, then he knows you won't and will continue to do it. You may be losing respect for him for calling you that, but he is also losing respect if he's still doing it.|`|7382e6436bbca0c2034d94d4e72448aeaa	It might be a good thing to leave him.    However, try this first.    When you are both calm and chatting.  Discuss it in a heartfelt way.  Explain why that word is so offensive to you and how it is not good for children to hear it.  Pour out your heart and show understanding that sometimes people say things they dont mean in fights.    It may work.|`|OHydEvTCaa	No I would not accept any disrepect from a man!|`|jl2xZGK6aa	move away from him he has no respect for you|`|s2wcWcu1aa	have you even told him that you dont want him to swear in front of your son? he might just not realise what he's doing and saying something might make him do so.  but if he reacts badly then you should leave him, especially since he's an alcoholic :| you, and your son, don't need that kind of influence around you.|`|76Dl0NnGaa	If he has the nerve to call you the B word and he sees that you dont do anything about it, then he will start to think that he has the right to do other things too, perhaps physical abuse. And the fact that he is an alcoholic does not make it any better. Get rid of him. You dont want your son being influenced by someone like that.|`|TPhIWWniaa	No I would not stay if he called me a "B".  By you staying in the relationship even though you've already told him that you'd leave him if he continued to do it is telling him that it is OK for him to keep calling you that.     He is going to continue to do this and perhaps call this name out in front of his friends, family and perhaps even your own family; at the same time you said he's an alcoholic? From personal experience alcoholics escalate in their abusive ways. You DON'T want this as a role model for your son, you want better than that! HELL you deserve better than that!!!
G5vGTTqhaa	Yeah you should, she's just having a really hard time|`|YVJQ7Y4jaa	If it was my mother and I had the same circumstances as you have had, I would contact her, using the telephone. I would not invite her over to my home until she proved herself. Seems like you come from a broken home, Mother with a boyfriend and father with his wife. That in itself is hard to deal with. After a period of a year or so, if things work out, you can invite her over for dinner. Dont take her in. It is better that she live by herself. Mother-In-Laws sometime create problems if living with their children and spouse. Your wife seems to be a really good wife and person. Your obligation is to her and your children first. By the way, no one has the right to abuse a woman, no one. You may disagree about things, but never become violent, or use abusive language. This advice is for the benefit of your mother.|`|PBdPD748aa	It really is ultimately your choice. People on here cant understand the depth of the problem and dont know who she really is, people generally automatically assume 'shes your mother, you have to' which should not be the case at all.     My opinion - she will not change, so dont waste your time. My fiance and I have had issues with his family, didnt speak to them for years, they protested their change, recently brought them back - and bang, it doesnt take long for them to be comfortable and show their real self (unchanged) believe me! Worst thing we did, really disrupted our household. She has been like that for so long, caused you issues for so long why do you think she will change now? I wouldnt fall for it again, your grown and you should be able to see the truth now. You need to worry about your wife and children, and i see you do, and she seems like trouble.     Just because you are born to somebody does not mean you are them or mean you owe anything to them, and it doesnt give them a special right to do things to you you wouldnt allow other people to.|`|1n3Cm4u7aa	i think yes|`|hEcKmleVaa	I would give her another chance, but ground rules have to be in place.  She does not have the luxury of name-calling, yelling, etc. around the kids.  Your mother has made some poor choices and her dependency on an abusive man is worrisome.  Let her know she is not allowed to bring him around or expose the kids to him in any way.  How does your brother feel about her?  How does he cope?  Families should be together if at all possible but if she cannot follow your ground rules, she does not have the priviledge of being in your lives.|`|ebae2bb97120c05a8385c8a1fc06cefbaa	Wow that's a lot of crap you have had over the years. Im afraid there is not easy solution for you. The decision has to be yours, and your wife's, she has been through this with you, and has to have her say, and don't forget you have children now to consider.   If you start a relationship with her again, will it effect your life for the worse, have you been happier since she has been out of your life?  Will it effect your relationship with your wife, she has to go through it all again as you do.  Will it effect your children?  Although it is good to get advice from the family, its not their life, its yours. You must make this decision for you and your immediate family nobody else.  One last thing, she is your mum, but that does not mean you have to like her, or get involved in her crap.  Good luck.|`|Yw1hoH05aa	Yes|`|4ZktwobSaa	YES IT'S A MUST|`|xpZsYckoaa	yes!|`|6YTjC3Aqaa	only good mothers deserve a son like you ,,,,she doesn't deserve that at all ...she has to apologize to you|`|OMOuxROoaa	well you only get one mother and thats it....... love works crazy and she fell for the crazy part of it. I would talk to her again and let her see your kids but keep it to a very minimal like start seeing her holidays only then see what happens.|`|4FeJ6B5Faa	My friend, you still have some unfinished feelings about your mother choice in who she wants to see.  I am sure that she sees what she was doing is wrong.  I will say this to you, while you are not talking to her, your kids are missing out on a chance to meet grandma before she passes. I am sure that you can have her see the kids with rules of course, but to simply not let them see her because you don't agree with her choices in a man is selfish.  You and your wife needs to both sit down and work this out.  When emotions are involved, which they are here, your judgment can be impaired in making what is best for you kids and not for you.    Let the kids see here, I promise you will not regret it.|`|8e61ac311eda0e888ee3a9de2be8875daa	A mother is a precious gift.  We only get one.  You don't have to like the decisions that she has made, you just have to respect them.  Families are essential especially in today's tough times.  Look at it this way, would you want your mother to separate herself from you if you had made these same poor choices?  Often times, the best judge of character and decision making comes from within.  If your were to separate her boyfriend from this equation would you still have ill feelings towards her?  If not, then I encourage you to make contact with her.  Your children should not have to suffer because you and she cannot be on one accord.
a61d29f848346a3a635d768e9c48bb90aa	he wasn't cheating on you if you broke up on saturday.  if something happened after he asked you back out, then yes.  and if they are interested in each other i don't think he would ask you back out.  and who cares if she likes you or not?  it's none of her business what the two of you do.  and in the case that he is interested in her and you tell him not to talk to her, he is going to do it anyway.  so don't tell him not to talk to her.  if you trust him, it should be no problem, and if you don't, you shouldn't be with him.  especially if you are pregnant, because it will make for the worst nine months of your life.  trust me on this.  and he may be acting weird because he may be nervous about you being pregnant.  so i don't think he is cheating on you.  but time will tell.|`|8103f5a386f35ec2420460c4f3b3dcabaa	Sounds like he is cheating|`|vt2VS0lDaa	yes.|`|eu3Gi5BNaa	there must have been a reason you broke up, no?  you shouldnt be back with him|`|lKof1n0Xaa	I think it's married when you're married to a poor bloke called Robert, and you're pregnant with your boyfriend's baby. :\|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	I'm not sure why you care if your boyfriend is cheating on you, since you are obviously cheating on your husband, Robert.|`|TAufQoc7aa	Take a pregnancy test|`|6RiLrsuBaa	he wants to be with you and he probably loves you, but he isn't comfortable with the idea of having sex with just one person for the rest of his life.  most men aren't.  and he's probably afraid that, since you're pregnant, he'll end up getting married and only be able to have sex with one person for the rest of his life.    honestly, i think you should get married, but occasionally have affairs.  or adopt a "don't ask, don't tell" policy when it comes to cheating.  because monogamy is no fun, at least not to people like me.|`|DbVOtAIBaa	how long has he been with you ? if it has been long....then there must be something called TRUST between you both.

Then decided he prefers you and asked you back.  She's hanging on, and he's bullsh-itting you both.|`|bhtcwR9Aaa	Well this is only my opinion so you know...I think your boyfriend is playing you along. I'm not sure if you are the type to do everything for this man before ya split. Based upon my past experience with men, when they add another female it doesn't necessarily mean he's cheating and it doesn't mean that he isn't either...it might be a control thing, where he want it to bother you so you can feel bad with in yourself. So he can have the upper hand here. Now that your pregnant maybe by the surprise of it, it displays the inner child in him, who is going to take care of me? That's another reason why he might hang onto this girl! They want it both ways to control you and make you feel terrible and have the other girl too in case it doesn't work out with you? This is only my opinion!|`|78c5d650f87826bfbfea0158b5e3884faa	He is cheating on you.

He just may be in love with the both of you. She probably doesn't like you because she has feelings for him. And she knows you two were involved.

Maybe you deserve someone better.|`|Kr09aQJkaa	yep, he's cheating!    How can you be Robert's wife and have a boyfriend?

Edit: I wonder why most people seem to be assuming that this question is sexual.|`|kprKXEOSaa	Well, you categorized under "Marriage & Divorce" so it all depends on what you're talking about.    You can love your brother, your father, your son, your close male friends, an older male mentor.  That's fine.  If you're talking about being a closet homosexual, that will cause problems in your marriage, and may lead to a divorce.|`|ma6Re8B1aa	You mean loving as far as a relationship goes?? being gay is what you mean ?? I think that gay people have a lot of issues. I think thats why their gay. I don't think being gay is normal.|`|BhXOLas1aa	no, love is precious and beautiful.

If you are gay, then of course you would love another male, and if you are not, well loving another man just means that you really admire him and are probably great mates.  I love my female friends, and Im certainly not a lesbian, my gal pals and I are just great friends who care about each other.|`|UZBULUuraa	I am not sure what kind of love you mean. I love my brother and my father. I also have a type of love for my friends who are also male. I have never had a homosexual relationship so I what is right for me might not be right for you and vice versa. Love is never wrong unless it becomes obsessive.|`|5WDsdDQ6aa	Nothing wrong it just means you're homosexual.|`|yJmjg9sEaa	If you mean, loving a male relative like your brother, father, grandfather, uncle, male cousins, etc.: Of course not. Sometimes we love members of our family even when there are some (or lots of) things we don't like about them.    If you mean, loving a male friend: Of course not. There are different kinds of love, and you wouldn't be really good friends with someone if you didn't love each other. I have male and female friends I love a lot -- as friends.    If you mean, loving another male in a romantic or relationship way: Well, I don't think that's wrong, and neither do most of the people answering you. Let's see what the experts say...    1. Many U.S. states and foreign countries let same-sex (2 men or 2 women) couples register as domestic partners or a civil union, or even get married. (Many other places ban and even refuse to recognize unions or marriages performed elsewhere, but civil rights have never been granted everywhere at once, whether the group denied equal rights were members one gender, one race or one religious group.)  2. Being gay (or lesbian or bisexual) is not considered a mental disorder, but some psychiatrists believe paranoid homophobia (fear or hatred of gays) is a mental illness. (Some unscrupulous doctors offer to "cure" homosexuality, but their claims are dismissed by the majority of psychiatrists and psychologists, and "ex-gay" patients usually admit they've only stopped acting gay rather than being gay.)  3. Being gay isn't as common in humans as being straight, but it is both "normal" and natural. How do we know it's natural? Scientists have found gay animals in over 1500 species, most of them wild!    So many judges, and the majority of doctors and scientists, all agree that there's nothing wrong with a male being attracted to or loving another male.    What about religious leaders, though? Is being gay sinful?  4. It's true that many Christian churches say homosexuality is wrong. But many other Christian churches welcome gay people as they are.  5. Some claim the Bible teaches that gay behavior is sinful. Religious scholars, however, point out that many of the passages used to support such claims have been misinterpreted or even mistranslated.  6. As with Christianity, some modern Jewish groups condemn homosexuality, while others welcome gays and lesbians even as rabbis and perform same-sex union or marriage ceremonies.  7. Similarly, there are authorities in other major world religions including the Baha'i faith, Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, Sikhism and "pagan" religions such as Vodoun (voodoo) and Wicca on both sides: some who say homosexuality is against their religion and others who say it should be accepted.    No matter which kind of love you're asking about, you can find someone who will say it's wrong -- that male relatives are only required to respect each other, or that a male liking and caring about a male friend shouldn't be called "love", or that romantic love or attraction between two males is wrong. But the growing (and in some fields, such as psychology, overwhelming) consensus is that there is nothing wrong with any kind of love one guy can feel for another.    I hope this helps you.|`|NSua62vxaa	Hardly. I don't think your the first guy to like other guys lol.|`|6dbb12cad0e32f793a90d33f0e0c9ae1aa	i dont think there is. what do you think?|`|0dqoVqWbaa	follow your heart, nothing should get in your way.And who are we to say is it normal or not?You should do whatever is the best for you man.    Good luck|`|fMDS4vTGaa	No, not at all.  You are of course bound by the same duty of respect and consideration to your partner that is routinely expected of any heterosexual couple.      Having a mutually respectful and satisfying relationship with another consenting adult is a core part of our existence, I think what sex that other adult is is of little importance.|`|LB368QD8aa	if you meant more than a friend : its your choice, if people dont respect that then its there loss    if you meant love as a friend: then i am the same my mates mean the world to me|`|6KQq8Tdraa	No way! People who think there is something wrong are close minded.  If thats how you feel, well thats the way it is!!|`|GzE4ibLtaa	I think that whoever thinks that gays are not right, i will ***** slap them!                       you go baby!|`|AA10696155	no|`|AA11043633	Personally I don't see anything wrong with that.  But I guess it all depends on you.  Will you be uncomfortable with it with your immediate surroundings and family?  It's your life and you know where you will be happy.|`|4V2lk6RDaa	There is nothing wrong at all loving another man. You can love anyone anyway you want.|`|vMK8zIJ6aa	ewwwwwwwwwwwwww  yuck|`|8bplNvAQaa	I love most of my male friends.  the close ones.  We're like brothers man, I love those guys.  But I'm not sexually, or romantically, in love with them.      Anyway, its fine either way these days.  Live your life man.|`|78c5d650f87826bfbfea0158b5e3884faa	No, there is nothing wrong with it at all.|`|3g1ZgTe4aa	Do you not love your dad, or grandpa? It is ok to love another man as a friend, or best friend. Just not to love that other man sexually.
kprKXEOSaa	I'm not sure what to say about the dizziness.  But, two months is not very long at all to know someone before having sex with them.  You're really rushing the physical part of your relationship, without knowing her at all.  Sex really clouds your judgement, so now you are not objective about her or your relationship at all, because you've gotten involved with her sexually.  That's just a fact.  You may need to take a step back and focus on building a foundation for your relationship.  Relationships based on sex often don't work out.|`|el8yX5q3aa	goodness dude..you are wearing yourself out.  NO ONE can keep up that pace foreer.  Stop thinking of yourself as a sex machine and you two slow down.      LOVE IS MORE THAN SEX!  If all you have is sex that is all hormones..get to know each other and spend time doing other things.    You are putting way too much stress on yourself.  Sex is the main thing in your relationship and for a relationship to last you have to have other things...like friendship.  You should be able to say no now and then and not feel guilty about it.  Just because you aren't in the mood one time doesn't mean you lost interest...Give your relationship a chance to grow more...it is screaming for some change.    Try sitting and talking and not touching each other...be FRIENDS too....if it is love it is forever...one day is not going to kill either of you.  Satisfying someone isn't just about sex..it is about every aspect in your life....so talk and do things and balance out your life some and stop putting so much stress on you.  She might be trying to keep up with you and wants to slow down too. When you can do that and not think something is wrong...you are growing up and know that life isn't all about ripping off each others clothes.|`|Q7TUfJkeaa	It sounds like just stress overal, Your job, School & your relationship. Just thinki positive. Your doingso much with your life and thats a good thing you just have to learn to take breaks because your doing so much. Youll be fine just talk everything out with your girlfriend if you can ry to make days when you guys can meet up or time for eacother.|`|kpW7Jyb2aa	Sounds like you're pushing yourself a little hard. The stress is making you a little paranoid, making you think people are looking at you.    You should try to find some ways to relax each night. Se xis good for relieving stress. There is also meditation. Look up some way to relieve stress and find one that will work for you.    I think if you can find a way to relax a little each night you'll see these problems kind fade over time.
DMhAPurkaa	I can t tell you how much it costs to live because it depends on where you live, there are more expensive areas of cities and cheaper areas.  Try to get a job that makes enough money to be able to pay your part of the rent with one paycheck. If it is more expensive than one paycheck, you need to make more money every paycheck, or move to a place that is cheaper.  Be careful because cheaper rent districts are sometimes more crime ridden.  Be careful who your roomates are. You need someone that will give and take equally so that there will be harmony and peace in your place .  You can be very thrifty and smart with the money you do have and be ever so careful where every bit goes.  Try to get a pot or planter box where you live and grow lettuce or flowers to cheer you. Even in a small place you might have a small area to put a pot that you could grow a pot of some vegetable to eat. Lettuce is good because you can plant the seeds, it grows, you cut some off with scissors, and then more grows back!  You can buy what is on sale at the market...  Freecycle . com to get free things others were going to throw away...  Clean with baking soda for a bathroom scrub and oven cleaner ( it s cheap and non toxic)  Clean with vinegar and water for a glass & countertop cleaner ( cheap and natural antibacterial )  Clean floors with vinegar & water or isopropyl rubbing alcohol  (cheap again )  Wash your clothes with half the soap you usually do, or sometimes if you are out of soap, just use a tablespoon of baking soda and wash just like that. The baking soda gets rid of any odors.  I am telling you these because you might run out of things, and need to pay your rent, or buy foods , ...  You can get a bike and ride everywhere you can , with a basket or box tied onto it, you can grocery shop and so on with your bike and then it won t cost you any petrol money , plus it lessens your carbon footprint.  You can do it. Peace comes with a price.  I moved out when I was 17.  Live with your Eyes Open however.  Soup is very cheap, and you can eat on that to save money.  You can go to thrift shops to buy clothes and pots & pans you may need , cheaper and you help recycle that way.  Dream it and live it!|`|WOHc22Xiaa	you might just want to wait until you get out of school. I pay 600 in rent and thats not included.

Looking at renting a place, then you may be able to get help with rent and rates, but there are things like water and sewerage bills, power supplies, food, furniture and fittings, even t.v. licence if applicable.  Moving out will give you a bit more freedom, that's for sure, but at what price will it cost you.  before you take the plunge and sign anything, ensure you have weighed everything up, and that you can afford it, as well as having some cash over to be able to live on.  Good luck,   Mike t.

Does she love you or does she need a meal ticket?  Does she feel that she made a mistake and should have stayed with you?  Or is it the financial support she needs?

That is the only way that you are saved from the nightmares that unconnected people do to us, like you did to me. I dont say I changed my mind, I still think I would never ever marry you but would I want you to put us to that position so we can at least see if we can make it, yes. We will never know. I will never know. Seeing you do things for me at least a small little thing in the ocean of pain that I will probably still have with you, I dont know. Does it have to end with your departure and me knowing you have just played me and that as a part of my growth I had to be let to be attacked by a satan in the most terrible possible way. I can never have Him here, the closest is to have someone that loves me as much and this goes for you too. You canot have Her or Him here in body flesh and hold your hand while sleeping (if you need any of that mushy stuff) but someone that loves you as much, out of pity and compassion for us both and our despair. If I want to live in every day life I must let Him go of my consciousness and let Him work through my sub-consciousness. Otherwise I am locked up in a world of only one dimension. You see that I am not interested in anything else but Him. And He is not that selfish to deprive me from other aspects of my being in the body and in the mind and other whateeeeeeeeeeeveeeeeeeeer. I love you but that is based on His love for you. My love is not to remove Him away from you so we can be alone, dont do that idiot. I, a human being, love you, a human being. We love each other BECAUSE we allow each other to see the Creator, not for any other purpose. Dear God, be my witness, I hate in my lover everything that comes from him himself because it so arrogant and self absorbed, whatever resembles You, I adore beyond anything I have ever dreamed about.
71VRvldJaa	If it's only been 3 weeks and you're already running out of things to talk about, that's really not a good sign.  I would hope you're mature and smart enough not to think sex is going to keep you together because it won't.....so I'd put any thought of sexual activity right out of my mind!  Instead of doing one on one activities, why not plan some group activities with 2 or 3 other couples?  Even one other couple will open up your options  You mentioned skating so I'm assuming you live in a cold country.  I'm in Ontario, Canada and we have a heap of snow here at the moment!  Go tobogganing, skating, bowling, a movie, build a snow fort in the yard, etc.  Things like that are great fun when you have a group of friends together and then go back to someone's house and hang out for awhile.  Play some board games (Balderdash is a riot with a group of 6 or 8),   If one or both of you are church goers, get involved with the church youth group.....they usually have socials planned.  The problem with today's electronic society is kids of this generation have no idea how to entertain themselves.  You said yourself, when you were on msn you could talk all night.....yet you can't do that face to face.  Have you ever asked yourself why that is?  Think about it!

A really good heart-to-heart should bring you both on the same page so you can move forward.

It's not something you're going to find in a traditional jewelry store.    Don't forget to remind your fiance, though, that a bolt-shaped ring probably isn't going to be that comfortable to wear every day.  If that's what he wants, fine, but he might be better off getting a round ring with some unconventional embellishment, like a tribal pattern, on it.|`|k6F9zkIRaa	http://www.jewelryvortex.com/fine-jewelr...

If you are talking about your 14 year old male friends, I guarantee you they are all lying or wildly exaggerating. Expect pecks on the cheek to have turned into blow-jobs and make out sessions into full-on romps.    If they are female friends, they probably have no reason to lie to you, but you should know that it doesn't matter what age they lose it compared to you, because girls lose their virginity much younger than boys. Think about it, all the 14 year old girls you know want like 18 year old boys right? So the age levels for people losing their virginity is going to be 14 for girls and 18 for guys. The figures aren't quite that polarized, but they show the general concept.    From personal experience, losing it or keeping it, is not as big a deal as everyone makes out. There are better things to worry about, buddy.    Also to everyone else answering, its clearly ALEXANDER.

And there the old personal preference. The age for this one is up to you.  Nothing wrong with that. If you believe in abstinence then you follow your beliefs! On the same note don't try to push yours onto others. :) Virginity is special. Once its gone its gone. Don't let people persuade into changing your mind. Its your life and the choices you make are yours to live with. Its the same with your friends too. Don't be pressured into anything. Peer pressure sucks but hold in there! Don't be a clone. It would suck if everyone was the same. Wouldnt it?    Hope I've helped! :)

That has got to be really tough for you.  It's very normal to feel very sad after something like this happens.  First, it's important to talk to your aunt and uncle about how you're feeling.  If you don't feel comfortable for some reason, try talking to another trusted adult, like a school counselor, neighbor, or youth leader at church.  Sometimes it really helps to just vent to someone.  It will get easier in time, just be honest and open about how you feel and you'll get through it.    Take Care,  Counselor KB|`|WOHc22Xiaa	Im sorry for your lose sweetie.

Oh dammmm now i'm turned on :)|`|GVlzdZKsaa	That is just a guy thing and is normal.|`|W0b2oqZvaa	well usually guys like that and you probably have good looks so he will basically get horny|`|rvSrjNeQaa	This is like a wireless current !!|`|DGJZxoJdaa	Guys like vagina|`|JSqc3dDBaa	visuals r hot thingss.. its a guy thingg... lol// good work jane|`|RYARNa8Qaa	idk?|`|tzNqAWhdaa	Some people just enjoy it and get turned on, maybe they would like to be doing it to you theirselves.  It might be fun you won't know unless you try|`|A0IvDqsGaa	its just a guy thing...a lot of guys are like that...its normal|`|4b5IQWcFaa	ew|`|FzFSzilmaa	maybe he likes you picking your nose... :D|`|8d220f500762c84b66042158d9d97babaa	It's a complement.

I hope you feel comfortable with that too.|`|3c9Z6nvFaa	He likes to see you please yourself. He wants to see where your most sensitive parts are so he can please you there too. He just wants you to be happy and comfortable with your self too.|`|W84gB7FYaa	I undertand what're at, you don't like to watch your boyfriend touch himself I guess. When guys do it is like it's deemed homosexual but for the girls it isn't. For me example, not to come off as a pervert or something but I totally detest guys touching themselves but with girls it's totally fine. I don't know really, it's just really a matter of your opinion.|`|x3ye9hKnaa	thats like asking why do they like hunting for deer and cretters.we gust do

So he might like you, and just doesn't know how much is too much.    Good luck!|`|IPS3hWweaa	One word:    Crush!    He totally loves you and either can't admit it or is afraid to let you know.|`|1GxMGmkqaa	you've been eavesdropping on too many incantations! lol!|`|FzFSzilmaa	maybe he has a bad short term memory and keep repeating it to remember it.. :D

Your stalker problem will be solved.|`|vOOf7xdEaa	yeah.............uh..............call the cops|`|bglr4m0Naa	well is he stalking you or is he just trying to win you over when your not interested in him? Because a lot of girls will say a guy is stalking them simply when someone fat or poor is pulling moves on them.|`|jChbnuafaa	i have no idea what that means       hes a creep kick in the balls if he doesnt quit it    good luck|`|Kh9Wzrhyaa	If he does not stop I suggest producing a fancy paper of your own: a restraining order. Enough said.|`|oJPn5Rgtaa	Use the magic words:    Restraining order|`|grAU3MJcaa	Tell him he'll get some writing on fancy paper that says "Restraining Order" if he doesn't let up.|`|WpaQKpckaa	Sweety.. only a stalker would say that|`|nxh8xxQvaa	Creepy much?

A stalker is someone who follows the victim around making them feel uneasy but a secret admirer doeesnt.|`|q1pwHXrMaa	Still creepy that you have a stalker but gotta say that's a good line.    He's pretty much saying that there's not difference between the two "titles" except a secret admirer is not as up front with the person they like. Where the "stalker" makes their feeling clear.    He prob doesn't see himself as a stalker, more so a guy how is making his feeling known.    Either way if you are uncomfortable he is  wrong. Let him know that what he does make you feel uncomfortable and if he is still persistent then you need to take things to a higher authority (ie parent, teacher, police if necessary).|`|8d220f500762c84b66042158d9d97babaa	He's twister words to confuse and manipulate you and to justify his actions. He has way to much time on his hands.

caa265fc73cd7f24fe83d9a186ac1af9aa	It depends upon what you mean by "fixed".    I am very self-conscious about my teeth, they are minimally mis-aligned and it bugs me.  But I don't have $5-grand for the braces it would take to fix them.  I do have the money to keep them white and to have a bleaching treatment shortly before the wedding (about $400).  If I could come up with $5-grand, I'd fix them to my satisfaction before the wedding, but that is just too cost-prohibitive for me and I hope that someday I will scrape together the money to have them fixed to my satisfaction.|`|d3icrU62aa	yes, if you think it'll make a difference for you then go forward with it! The last thing you want is to be self conscious on your big day....you should feel beautifull on your wedding day|`|db67c0941f0845d64edf1a84aa913e6aaa	I am taking this time to get all my teeth fixed!  I made an appt next week, and I need MAJOR WORK.... I'm considering getting invisalign as well if I can straighten my smile within 6 months.  I'm going to bleach and do whatever I can.  I ALWAYS cover my smile if the picture is close up, and I'm tired of doing that.  I know I won't be able to have such a glamorous wedding as I made a resolution not to use credit cards so it's cash only for me.  I prefer though to be able to smile a little prouder on my day!|`|a3422bad6666b60894e80bace0f14387aa	Anytime is a good time for dental work! Now you have a good reason too, not that you really need one. Depending on what you need done you could have it done before the wedding. Check with your dentist and see what they recommend.    Good luck!|`|VgJBXSQhaa	Yes it is a good excuse, but make sure you have time to complete all of the treatments. Also, if you have dental insurance, confirm how much all of the dental treatments will cost beforehand. I am in a similar boat, but unfortunately am unable to complete all of what I want because my insurance won't pay for the oral surgery I need done.|`|kRh3slhdaa	I personally think that it's always a good time to get your smile the way you want it to look. I've had braces all through high school (and it sucked, lol) but I'm sssooo glad they are straight (got slightly crooked because I don't wear retainers anymore), but pretty straight pearly whites. They really boosted my confidence up and it really shows in my graduation, wedding, and other photos.     I think if you have been thinking about it for a while, it would be a good excuse to get it. Get invisalign if you don't want braces lines running across your teeth. Of course, if you can afford it, then why not? Hopefully your insurance can cover some and that will help out. Oh, those crest whitening strips work! You don't need to get that professionally done at an office, it's only $40 a box. They taste crappy though, lol.    I don't think this is bad, trust me, I've seen brides that get boob jobs for the wedding and I just think that's atrocious, hahaha. It's one thing looking good and another that screams for attention!|`|zmqN0M86aa	I'm the same way, I don't like showing my teeth in pictures either.  My teeth aren't that bad, but they look crooked if I'm photograhed at a certain angle.  I want to fix my teeth, but I wouldn't be able to do it by the time I get married (only a little over 4 months until the big day).  I want Invisilign but it's so dang expensive.  Maybe some day...|`|R7b150Iyaa	I agree with Nova_Queen.  I have a minimal overbite as a result of taking off my retainer too soon when I was younger. I looked into getting Invisalign in order to straighten out my smile before the wedding.  However, even with my health insurance through my employer, it will still cost me about $6,000 out of pocket to have something like this done, and $3,500 if I choose to go with regular braces (never!)  I decided that it is way too expensive, especially since we have a wedding and honeymoon coming up.  The good thing is, my teeth aren't crooked, just the top ones are a little bit over the bottom ones, so my smile still looks good in pictures.  My fiance also wanted to get his teeth fixed before the wedding but decided to forgo for the same reasons as me.    If you have extra money for this, it won't cut into your wedding budget, and you have enough time before your wedding, go for it!    Good luck and congrats!|`|AsFiWxhUaa	yes because you will be taking pictures that you will have for the rest of your life it is a great reason!|`|01b990b6feebbb819d33fb976c859438aa	sure, fixing your teeth is such a good thing to do anytime. it will make you feel better about yourself regardless.

VcAFnpk9aa	To draw up prenupitual papers, you need to sit down with your spouse to be and a lawyer and hammer out the details of the agreement.

Kr09aQJkaa	I have been married for 20 yrs. We have our home, our cars, our kids and our money. I am not a border that pays my half and has sex with him. Share and share alike.|`|NyjxygFmaa	My hubby likes to spend money more than I do like that too. Yes we talk about what he wants to buy before he does but he doesn't think about other things that could be bought with the money like diapers, or even shoes our kids may need. It doesn't seem fair. I do not have a job but I know how it feels. I think that both of you should be able to have access to all the money still have your own accounts but you could both get to eachothers money. You could always say what my hubby says and say hey I pay the electric and turn lights off on him or keep your heat low and say I pay the heat bill.|`|zdpp7cubaa	My fiance and I plan on doing things that way, but we have agreed on an amount each month to place into the joint checking. Enough to cover bills, food, and things for the house. Once the kids come along we will start a college fund and both place a set amount of money in there as well. Honestly, I wanted to do this because I have expensive taste and I don't want my future husband to know I spent $500 on a dress. If I wanted to do that I should be able to without hearing his mouth, the same for him. Also, I'm being realistic, what if our marriage fails and all we have is a joint account? But say I point in more money or he did and then we are supposed to split that? Or what if he gets mad and decides to take all the money out of it if he decides to leave me. I am not planning for my marriage to fail; I plan on being married to him for life, but I know a lot of people who had to leave their spouse and then did not have the financial means to do so.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	We have the same accounting system in our house - yours, mine and ours.  We base it on the earnings - I make about 40% of our total income and my husband 60% so we scale the contributions based on that.  He puts in a little more than I do for the bills now, but I worked two jobs and helped put him through school and made all the money at that time - so it balances out.  Truth be told - he puts extra in our account frequently so we can add it to our joint savings.  I wish I had the opportunities he does for overtime or side work...but I don't.  I think that as long as you both have a focused set of joint financial goals you'll be fine!|`|6dbb12cad0e32f793a90d33f0e0c9ae1aa	how about you put a certain percentage into the joint account-each 50 percent for example- and then you each have a percentage to do with what you want.  i urge you to get this under control before you marry, even if it takes counseling. money can be a real problem in a marriage, dont go into it without having discussed it and come to an agreement|`|atzw0IP4aa	I would think long and hard on that. I agree joint account for mutual house hold expenses, and separate accounts for your own $$. I would suggest having a discussion that stipulates that you agree to discuss as a couple any purchases over 500.00 (or any amount) and set a plan up for emergency savings, regular savings, and retirement. Maybe premarital counseling? Sounds like he still wants to be single if he can make choices with out your input or opinion.    My other 2 cents and wholehearted beleif is that the energy that you go into a marraige with ( or relationship) will be there the whole time.     Has he shown you red flags before this? Are you hoping that he will change?     When people show you who they are the 1st time, believe them.     If he will not budge on any of it, you have your answer. A mature person will look what they need to do to work as a team, because you will be faced with challenges as a couple .|`|qIDBrSmnaa	Sounds like you want a peice of his pocket... I am not suprised as you are awoman but if there is at least some love betwen you two then this should not be an issue...

Sorry to be harsh but it is what it is honey...|`|vMK8zIJ6aa	Well my wife and I fell a marriage is a partnership.So everything is mine and hers together. Never have understood ppl who have my money and her money, that's not being a 1 whole unit couple, and still holding on to some of the single "ME" life. If he insists on doing this way. Tell him ok, but the joint account will be contributed by percentage of each others take home pay. Therefore you will put in less cuz you make less.|`|TDiRmT9daa	Marriage is a transition from "me" and "you" to "us". To have a successful marriage both partners have to fully commit to "us". If you hold onto a belief in "me" and "you" standing against each other, you will stand against each other and never become "us".    It sounds like you feel you need to protect yourself but feeling threatened is going to make him the enemy. What you need is to come to an agreement that works for both of you. You need to stop judging his attitude about money and let go of the need to be right.    It isn't about who is right. It is a simple case of his way doesn't work for you and your way doesn't work for him. Both of you will need to accept taking a few steps towards each other.    Ask yourself what you really want to achieve. If you are a saver then you probably value security. Can you ask him to come a little more your way by agreeing to set aside a certain amount of his income in savings? The savings would be neither for him or for you - they would be for "us", that is for your future and for your family.    In terms of the bills, perhaps it would be more fair to pro-rate the contributions. Since he makes more money, perhaps he could pay a higher percentage of costs rather than split the bills 50/50. This is likely to be more fair since he is likely to have more expensive tastes than you might choose if you were not with him.    If he is into "toys", maybe you could appreciate that these things make him as happy as having money in the bank makes you. Can you let him have this freedom without resenting everything he chooses to buy?    There are many options. This is a negotiation and the object is to come up with an arrangement that is a win/win. It can be if you take the attitude of "us" and plan for the long term as well as the short term.    From your end, you need to examine why you hate money. If you don't understand your own attitudes and issues, you will just end up blaming him for the beliefs and feelings that are your own doing, not his. You need to realize that just because you feel strongly about money it doesn't mean your beliefs are the right ones. They may be right for you but you have no more right to impose them on him than he does to impose his beliefs on you.    Being "us" is about unity but it is also about respecting each other as individuals.
I6vMxEU9aa	Without a doubt, a joint account (for bills/mortgage) and then have separate accounts. The main reason my husband and I do this is because we like to keep everything fair. Our school loans are drastically different amounts, and it is unfair for one of us to have to pay into the other's. Also, if we didn't keep things separate, I feel like we'd make more extraneous purchases because in the back of your mind, you'd always be thinking, "Well, just because I couldn't afford it, doesn't mean WE can't."     All I can say is that we've been doing our bills this way for about 8 years and have never had a problem.    In regard to kids, we have one on the way, and the plan is to share her expenses equally as well.|`|8txWayVnaa	Joint account with separate accounts.    The joint account should include money for the children's needs.|`|KILFoc6kaa	Its all about what works for the couple involved and everyone has different reasons for what they choose.    We have joint accounts, I am a housewife and full time college student studying education as I plan to home school our future children, my husband works full time and goes to school full time.  There is only one source of income so no reason to even consider two accounts, not that we would ever do that anyway its just us.      When we have kids, of course that money is shared and will be used for that, since we plan on homeschooling the expenses will be different than most, more on supplies instead of clothes.    My husband doesnt say the money is his, he never has. Thats our money, we share it, we discuss it, and we budget it.|`|muTZeGOgaa	It's whatever works for you. All our accounts are joint. The only reason we could think of to keep separate accounts was if we wanted to buy presents for the other person and not ruin the surprise. Well, we each have our own credit card, so there was no need for that.    And, we don't have kids.|`|xYgFcEfwaa	separate better.  so things dont get messed up .|`|K542Db29aa	if your married a joint account to all because when we get married we become one and so does everything else in our lives! their are times i cant get to the bank and my husband can and he can get the money to pay the bills. its a lot easier and not as stressing.. say for ex your wife is on bed rest being pregnant and all she can do is get up to pee who will go to the bank and pay bills if its only her name or yours on the account. it wont get done then you fall behind then you have a fight. The main person you should really talk to this about is your spouse. write down on paper the advantages and disadvantages of not having a joint account and having a joint account together hope it helps..good-luck :)|`|Sjf112pKaa	We have a joint account, but my husband takes care of the bills and finances. We don't give each other "allowances". We simply just consult each other when we want to purchase something that is expensive.     Well my thinking is that once you are married you share everything. You share a house, so why not share your money? If both of you work just put all your money together. That saves you from getting in fights about who pays for what.     I think that having separate accounts and each being responsible for paying for different things can be a great source of contention in a marriage. But what ever works for you and your spouse is the best course of action.|`|HFjeW2esaa	Definitely a joint account for all bills and everything to do with "running the household"  Like vehicle repair bills, school clothes, home repair.      Then we also have our own accounts for our personal spending money.      We also set aside money for vacations or trips separate from all three and it works out great,, that way your not infringing on either your accounts and the trip gets paid for.    This system works very well for us,  been married 2 yrs now.|`|8bplNvAQaa	I bought a house with a girl and we have a joint account for bills and mortgage only.  That way you pay the same in each month and don't have to live in each others pockets.    This way money won't be a problem that messes with your relationship.    Any food or other expenses can be discussed and agreed.  You keep your own money and have control over your own lives.  It's a far more sensible situation because if you become hard up you can bail each other out far more effectively, and keep track of all YOUR outgoings.  The joint account can be standing orders and direct debits (fully automatic and not a problem).    Being married this makes even more sense because you will be able to have your own things and treat each other.  Imagine getting a present you paid for with your own money from the joint account.  Its not a problem but come on, that's lame.      Keep financially independent and you'll have a far more comfortable life.  Share the things you need to share.  Whats your marriage? a communist state.  I don't think so, keep it fair.    If you pay your spouse housekeeping then that goes straight into their account.  Simple.  You just have to handle your own bills and sit down from time to time to divide the amount you need to pay into the joint account.  It should be 50/50 whilst there are no kids on the scene, and you can divy up the percentages you pay into the joint account at a later date.      I don't know if there are any tax advanatges, but this system works.    If you need to pay money for clothes etc then discuss how much you each pay and give it out accordingly.  Maybe get another jont account for household general expenses (such as food and kids stuff).  Alternativly, shop together.  You'll work it out, but the one account is a BAD idea.|`|YWPJzFoOaa	My husband and I have one joint account. We both work a full week and we share everything including chores.  We've been together for almost 9 years and never once had a fight over money.  We agree that a marriage is an equal partnership.  Totally 50/50.  We have two wonderful children and we both take care of them physically and financially.  I am proud to say that he's not one of those "I don't change diapers" dads.  So, we both put our money into one account and budget our funds.  That way, no one's better than the other person.|`|mvKDbb2uaa	We have two separate accounts and one joint account.    It's whatever works for you both as a couple--every couple is different.|`|kEtYEmhqaa	Joint account -- everything is "ours".

puJxykXeaa	u get to be maya only in dis life n life is supposed to be lived to fullest.every bit of life is supposed to be enjoyed because u never know what can happen next    dis is what my father caught me when he passed away few months back.....u should love the people around u who are ur parents n friends ...    and if u ever feel like this then go to a counsellor who can help u open up from inside out and can get ur positive side out......    p.s-remember to live very moment of life because it will never come back|`|4cdq26oraa	I'm not sure. I think that's where hopes, dreams & goals come in.  If you have none, then what's the purpose ?  As for the meaning of life . . . . much like religion, a lot of opinions but no way of proving who's right or wrong.  Just do what you think is right and what makes you happy. Can't go wrong with that.|`|YfFFzOw1aa	Hey maya,x, to me the meaning of life, is make the most of it and live everyday as if it was your last, help the upset and suffering, tell the truth, and just take it as it comes.  also to me there is no perfect life there are always problems which is what makes it exciting and worth while, if your life was perfect it would be so boring and pointless, and at the moment i don't know what i want from life but i am sure that one day i will click and no exactly what to do, just be patient babe life will make sense one day. x
577ba10a2319b430720b5a913b74b862aa	if he makes you feel uncomfortable now, and is "making" you do stuff, sexual or not, you may want to rethink the relationship.  be very careful about committing yourself to this type of man.  he will NOT change after you get married, and he may get worse to the point the he is possessive and violent.    it is NOT your fault -- never never never take responsibility for another's actions.  i did that in the 12 yrs in hell i spent in my first marriage.|`|sMUiGFPraa	Tricky situation. but bottom line if it makes you uncomfortable you need to reevaluate the relationship. Sexual tension is a funny thing for both men and women. It could be just simply that!|`|BENiX8eDaa	For him to get angry about you pleasuring him is a huge red flag.  Please consider leaving him.  I ignored red flags like this before I was married, and it ended horribly. If he makes you feel uncomfortable that is another huge red-flag going up.  Think about taking a break or some time apart to evaluate your feelings.  You don't want a man that will make you feel stress or who prioritizes his own pleasure over having respect and honor towards you.|`|JtEBaOdjaa	Just have sex with him.  Waiting til marriage is stupid. What if he's bad and then you've married him? You are stuck!!  Plus the first time sucks really bad (it's so painful for most girls) and it's REALLY awkward.  You do NOT your memory of your first time to also be your memory of your wedding night.  Not if you want your wedding night to be perfect.    Edit: honestly, when I reread this it sounds like you are a c*ck-tease.  You get him all worked up and then stop just short of pleasuring him.  OR you are willing to do things one day then get all "Innocent angel" on him the next.  I'd get angry too if I were him.  Hike up your skirt and let him in or move on so he can find a better woman. One who isn't a c*ck tease|`|mvKDbb2uaa	This somehow bothers me....    The fact that it seems like you've both talked about it but he still tries to do stuff and makes you feel uncomfortable isn't right.  He should respect your wishes and exercise some self control.  The fact that he's getting angry at you for something like this is not right.  And for you to worry that he gets a bit too angry about it is even more worrisome.|`|WwXrTQgaaa	There are men who are not freaks. There are not many and they are hard to find. Good luck. Leave before you get hurt.|`|7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	I think it's time for you to re-evaluate the relationship.  If he gets angry about your having an opinion about this, he's going to get angry about your having opinions about other things for the rest of your lives.  The license may change your opinion about sex, but it won't change his opinion that things have to be done his way or he gets angry, and he doesn't care if what he wants makes you uncomfortable.|`|2o3BHgCCaa	He is wrong. You should never make your partner (or anyone) feel uncomforthable, especially when it comes to sex. In a way I suppose it is a form of rape if he keeps trying things without your permission.    Don't let it get that far in the future and be harsh with him to keep his distance. If you both have decided not to have sex before the marriage then maybe he needs you yelling at him and making a fuss so he begins to think you have a mind of your own and won't be bullied into something you don;t want to do.

AA12204752	I think it depends on what type of relationship you have with your Mom. If you think she will freak, keep it to yourself. After all, you're in college now and should be wise enough to be careful in what you're doing.|`|slJlLGMVaa	Nope, because I want to live to see the next day =]|`|I4VI0FR8aa	i would never tell them not just from the fact that they would kill me but also cause thats my business they dont need to know that..but i am scared of my mom lol|`|705dbe30dde9b45b3c57171f93776b70aa	No i haven't told my mother but i doubt she would say anything cus she already assumes I'm no virgin.|`|x68KtQUcaa	My mom against loosing virginity before marriage...so I would never tell her...|`|LvK6rg1caa	I love That 70's Show - HYDE IS SUCH A BADA$$ :)  I think its pretty weird telling either one of your parents every time you are with a new person, its your intimacy!    I just keep it between me and my partner, (& my 2best friends for advice in the relationship). Parents its just too weird.    I didtn tell my mom, my bf used to come to my house and we used to chill in the room, my litle brother used to be watching TV he was like 6 or so, and he snitched on me thats how mom found out i wasnt a virgin. HAHA fun times. Yea i almost got killed! lol     After that i have not spoken about my sex life, its just weird!|`|K542Db29aa	At 16 no I didn't tell my parents in the end they found out though because my boyfriend then who is my husband now his dad asked my husband and called my mom and told her that night! so ya they always end up finding out if you want them to or not lol :)|`|6KQq8Tdraa	past year i have been having sex and there was NO WAY IN HELL i was telling my mum hahah , BUT unfortuantly she found a pregnancy test about a month ago lol BUSTED!!!.    It wasnt the easiest way for her to find out lol|`|YjRkpIG4aa	I'm not going to tell my parents, I think that would kinda be a gross conversation because that could open the conversation up to talk about her experiences. (ewwwwwwww to the max) Plus, I think that's a little weird, my parents don't tell me so i don't tell them. Wouldn't it gross you out if you had a kid and they told you about their first time? (if i had one it would)|`|GZgUBcENaa	It all depends on your relationship with your parents and if you feel they should know that bit of information! Well I havent yet, But depending on when it happens, I probably would tell my mum! She's the person I trust the most in my life so I tell her most things and yes those convos do strike up her past experiences (ewww haha) but we just laugh about it :P
d43572be4d732509a5fdc4d8b9b9291baa	My husband and I had pre marital counseling from my pastor.  I was very apprehensive because my pastor is also my brother!  It was the most fun I'd had in a while.  Because I am a born again believer, it wasn't as intense as I thought it would be.  He basically had us define what we thought marriage was about, he asked us why we wanted to be married to one another.  He asked for reasons why couples don't stay together, etc.  All of the answers we gave to him, he contrast those with passages from the bible and showed us how to apply spiritual things to our natural lives.  It was great.  He told us that effective communication and the embodied commitment to stay together is essential for a lasting marriage.  He let us know that it wasn't always going to be roses (as we have found out in a short time), but that if we were committed and put God first, we could go wrong.  I would like to say to you that when you feel you can't go on in the marriage, go back to what it was that made you want to be together with your spouse in the beginning and recapture those feelings as a base point to rebuild on. He did not ask us personal questions about our sex life, but he did let us know that sex is essential and we must desire one another in the spirit of Erros love. (erros means the spirit of desire-errogenous)|`|3J3IH2maaa	yes me and my fiance just finished ours it was cool they ask you how you are compatible.about your interest and your sex life if any, and they ask you your feelings for one another it was pretty cool I believe they ask questions like how you feel about having a family, children, how you will communicate with each other - general but important things to consider before you get married. it's more about your relationship and future goals. Don't sweat it!|`|H3WHxCgaaa	I believe they ask questions like how you feel about having a family, children, how you will communicate with each other - general but important things to consider before you get married.

God is actually three persons in ONE substance - The Father, the Son, the Holy Ghost.  God is the "God-head" of all three.|`|asxqampCaa	depends on who you ask.    the christian bible says "in heaven they are neither married nor given in marriage."    the terrorist suicide bombers have a different opinion. they say they get 72 willing virgins for their acts.    book of mormon has the star Kolob around which circle the planets where good mormons rule with all their wives and children. One day on Kolob is equal to a thousand earth years according to the mormon 'Measurement of Perfection.' (same rules that govern the layout of Salt Lake City.)     But does god have a wife and kids? and commute to his office? and hit the "Smite" button on his computer all day? then commute back home in traffic? then pet the dog, play with the kids and read the paper while the little mrs. fixes dinner?     no that's called being  "antrhopomorphic" and not many religions believe that.       but hey! start your own and sell the married with kids god idea. everyone else starts their own religion - why not you?|`|KO4Ea9Xkaa	I gave up having imaginary friends when I was around 5, therefore I do not believe in God and so cannot concede that he has/had a wife and children. I do however believe that Jesus existed, and I strongly suspect he may have married and fathered children.|`|IfwpibHqaa	im one of his child|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	Jesus is the son of God, but God was never married to his mother, so God does not have a wife.
Sl0iE8cbaa	I am not saying that cheating is ever right, but it is more understandable in some situations then others. Your situation sounds like she was going through a lot of emotional stuff and so were you. Your husband not being able to have sex must be really hard. She might have even blamed herself or felt like she wasn't sexually attractive anymore. Then you pulling away emotionally made things worse. I know that you must have been devastated and going through your own sh**. If you guys can make it through ED and an affair you must really love each other. Just because someone has an affair once doesn't mean that they will be unfaithful in the future. I know firsthand that it isn't true. I can tell you from a female that I have had 2 good friends of mine have affairs and be faithful for years after and still are. But you need to fix what caused the problems in the first place. See a doctor for the Ed and a therapist with your wife about the other issues. If you can't have sex then you better be keeping her satisfied anyways, get my drift. She and you both still need to feel that intimacy and she needs to have that sexual release. Also still say sexually charged comments to her to let her know that you are sexually attracted to her on a regular basis.    Good Luck!!|`|0bYcYz2jaa	You could have worked together and failed to.  That does not justify her actions though.  If you have chosen to try and work out your problems, then do it.  See a doctor and work on giving her the attention she wants.  She also needs to understand that she broke your trust and it will take a long time before you can let it go.  So now, she needs to have the patience to deal with your mistrust when it flares up, and work with you to renew the relationship you both took for granted.  Good luck and I hope for your sake that she is sincere, maybe re-hashing it all the time isn't the best way to work it out.|`|O36qjj7Oaa	Only time will tell if she is being sincere or not.|`|Ga9oCLavaa	She told another man she love him and spread her legs for him.    I would kick her to the curb.|`|K8OjmMUAaa	Well first off, her "reason" for cheating on you was just an excuse and it was NOT a valid one. No one forced her into doing it so please don't let her lay the blame on your doorstep! She has two hands, I'm assuming, and they make plenty of "toys" that are capable of many wonderful things. She had alternatives.     But it does sound as if she is truly sorry for what she did. I can understand how it would be kind of infuriating to know that they work together, but honestly, even if they didn't, that wouldn't prevent them from running into each other in different places. So try not to dwell on that....she's coming home to you, and it sounds like she's being honest with you about things. As for as the trust thing, you just have to give it time. You build it up again by finding out that she's telling the truth when she tells you things, so pay attention to her and go with your gut feeling about stuff.     Have you considered counseling? Lots of couples balk at that, but with the right counselor it can really do you some good. Maybe you should look into getting one to help you work through all the leftover emotions and aftermath.     Good luck...|`|3mb5IV1Zaa	Is it unreasonable to ask her to switch jobs? or transfer to another location? I don't know where you located, but in this economy... maybe I didn't think that advice through :o). I don't know your wife, but you do. Trust takes a lifetime to build, and a second to destroy- like someone set fire to the Sistine Chapel. I'm sorry that you are going through this, but it will only make you stronger as a couple, or lead you in the direction you are supposed to go. You have a purpose on this earth, whether your wife is meant to stay or go, it will shape who you are in the long run, in good ways. You have to climb the mountain before you can enjoy the view :o). Good luck.|`|sfn6SpbCaa	Eduard V, you are not going to like what I have to say; however, that's the brakes. You should have never felt sorry for yourself and got down to a doctor and seen to your erectile dysfunction straightaway. This whole situation is your fault not hers. Had you done what you should have done from the get go you would not be questioning her sincerity.|`|6GUpUXoXaa	trust is very hard to gain back from someone after it has been broken and you probably aren't emotionally ready to be with her right now.  she should have stuck it out with you about your problem before and she shouldn't have had an affair ...     if she wasn't able to be with you and only you then what makes the difference now?  because now you cant trust her so you will not be able to connected with her emotionally now either... yyou should maybe think about marriage counceling|`|U88H6YlEaa	I had an affair, my husband found out, it almost destroyed us. We chose to stay together and rebuild the relationship, which is stronger for it. Once a cheater, always a cheater is rubbish, I would never, never do it again. I think your wife sounds genuine and if I were you I would focus on the rebuilding of the  relationship, make it more beautiful than ever before. And do something about the erectile dysfunction, there are solutions to this problem, and it will help save your marriage. Good luck to you buddy!|`|1kfeghDDaa	Hummm...the way I look at it...I couldn't stand for anther man to put his hands on me. I belong (so-to-speak) to my husband.    It will take time to be able to trust her again, but she needs to be an open book, nothing to hide.|`|AA11704353	Once a cheater always a cheater!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  it will happen again they work in the same building|`|NuCu5RbTaa	relax, pal. noone needs your wife except u. if this other guy wanted to live permanently with her she would have been already gone from your life. a guy just wanted to screw smth, he didn't want to marry it. so why re u still fretting about it? and losing life over a cheating wife? this is stupid|`|kHRD7uUAaa	you need to growup and stop being a big baby about it no wonder she cheated on you she needed a real man one that don't go around crying. so suck it up and stop your pity party.|`|i1rDJY2aaa	So what have you changed about yourself to correct the problem.  1. Erectile dysfunction = go the the Dr and get yourself a prescription  2. Lack of affection - call her every day and tell her you love her. Hold her hand, kiss her every day, cook for her, make eye contact with her and smile at her, tell her she's beautiful.    You admitted that it was your own fault that she cheated, now what are you going to fix about your behaviour to keep her wanting you and only you?|`|0rlGY8DXaa	once a cheater, always a cheater, sorry. :\|`|G2K8gsKLaa	time shall tell|`|UtS0bNufaa	number one go see adoctor for ur problem as soon as possible and number two get urself another girlfriend who will really stick by u thick and thin she broke the trust chances r she will do it again u r much better than tht don't go through it again|`|ZVb8azf2aa	Well that's a tough one.  She's probably sorry but at the time he was something new and exciting and was giving her attention. Women need that.  So regardless of what's going on with mr. happy always try to make her happy in other ways because if you don't, no matter how much she loves you she has needs.  I know you can't help your condition and I'm not validating what she did.  It sounds like she's sincere and that she loves you very much.  But she needs more than you were giving her and it sounds like you guys have a good chance at working it out if you make her feel needed and special again and don't push her away.|`|BI8c6XXPaa	I agree with Day A and Giddy.    She probably felt that you put her on the back burner because you didn't get help for you erectile dysfunction. My husband went through a bout where he never wanted to sleep with me because he was so stressed out, and it killed me, I thought I was ugly and fat, I thought he was cheating on me! If you withdrew from her, she was probably feeling a little neglected. Not to excuse her actions, but maybe explain them.    It will take time. Go to marriage counseling, it will help you. Get help for your erectile dysfunction. Lack of sex can really kill a marriage.
a3422bad6666b60894e80bace0f14387aa	My BMs are all different too. I asked them to design a dress together that had elements that they all liked and would be flattering. They got together and did just that and the result is amazing! I am making the dresses from a fabric we chose together as well and so far they are awesome and the girls love them. You could always try this.    If you are not crafty or a seamstress or know anyone, you could let them wear different styles, or just go out one day and look and see which dress flatters all of them if you want them to wear the same thing.    Good luck!|`|577ba10a2319b430720b5a913b74b862aa	my daughter is having all her bridesmaids in the same color but in different styles.  she picked out several styles so that they would have some choice there, as long as it was in the color she picked.  as far as what colors i think, it depends on what colors you've picked...if you haven't picked yet, it depends on when the wedding is.  some colors would be better for spring/summer, some for fall/winter.|`|E7LQp6VRaa	A darker colour, maybe an A-line gown...|`|AA10431095	for bridesmaids....hm... definitely violet... SHOCKING violet  OR yellow!, and it depends on the age they are. they could choose the lengths they wanted acoording to their age nad preference.. and preferrably sleeveless.    howvever... do you really need your bridesmaids to wear the same color? more variety is generally better, no?|`|3MDY29gnaa	That sounds like me. Well i Was going to let my  girls get all different dresses (as long as there floor length) in the same color. And then 4 out of the 8 wanted the same dress so i just had to go with that one. One of my girls is a little bigger then the rest and she just purchasing a wrap to go around her arms. Try letting them get different dresses in the same color and see what that turns out like|`|vtW3qPZmaa	I'd say go with a neutral colour that suits all skin tones, like a chocolate brown, black, midnight blue etc and go with a dress company that lets you do separates so that each girl can get a skirt and top in the same colour and fabric, but make sure it's flattering on her body.|`|LAXbJfvwaa	Go somewhere like David's Bridal or Alfred Angelo - they have a range of different bridesmaids dresses but the same colour schemes - so you can just tell your bridesmaids what material, colour and basic length (ie floor length for formal, t-length for semi) and then they can each choose the dress that suits their figure - but will all match each other because the material and colour will all be the same.|`|73193e3b067ba4736d1fab4da3289625aa	Since there are a lot of 'big' words in your question a darker colour scheme might be more flattering to most of your bridesmaids. Why not choose a colour and let them choose the dress...with consultation from you of course you don't want any hoochy mama clothes or stripper dresses in your wedding. Having said that something that has an empire waist (flattering to most shapes and sizes) and short sleeves ( to cover big arms)  and isn't satin (satin makes everyone but a model look huge) might work out for you all.|`|b4d9549d46983fced7e264d76911b93aaa	I just had my wedding 5 months ago, and I kinda went through the same thing. What I did was I chose 2 patterns that would flatter any shape. I chose dresses that had a high waist and flared out... the dresses came out absolutely beautiful. Some of the girls were more "busty" than others. And some of the girls had more "curves". =) So I had the dresses made for them and if they needed to be adjusted in any way, it was definitely possible. I'm not sure where exactly your located, but where I live there is an area called the Fabric District, and they sell all kinds of material at very reasonable prices. For the 5 girls I decided to get the material myself and let the girls actually pay for the seamstress to make the dress. I spent about $100.00 total for the fabric, thread, and zippers.   And my family knows a seamstress which was happy to do the dresses and only charged $55.00 per dress. My colors were Turquoise and Chocolate Brown. The dresses were made out of chiffon, which made them very flowy... it turned out perfect.     Hope telling you my story might give you some ideas... and don't stress it will all come together.   Good Luck.|`|by9KuBizaa	I attended a late December wedding in which there were four bridesmaids of various shapes and sizes.  The girls all wore deep red gowns in different A-line styles.  Each of the girls looked beautiful because the bride let them choose the dress they felt most beautiful in and as a group, they looked individual yet matched well because of the common theme of color.      I've also been to a wedding where the bridesmaids wore separates:  All wore long skirts but then each girl chose the top that best fit her figure.  Several designers have separates but here's an example.    http://www.alexiadesigns.com/main/separa...|`|qhKP68eiaa	For my wedding...I know we all love the previous bride stories! :)...I chose a color based on the over all theme of the wedding (fall wedding=chocolate brown dresses), but let each bridesmaid choose their own dress.  It honestly looked so neat seeing each dress really reflect the maid's individual style while still fitting into my overall theme of browns and other fall colors.      I'd say pick your favorite color.  You're going to be the one looking at these pictures on down the road.  Try to stay away from the trends, just pick something you find appealing and you will continue to be happy with the results down the road!|`|hdj5OncVaa	A-line dresses work for most figures. For colors, you may want to choose seasonal colors. If you want affordable bridemaids jewelry for the dresses, you may want to check out http://www.glamforless.com/. I got by bridesmaids jewelry from them and they loved it.
JlDcVTVsaa	i think it means he loves you but because of the bad situation he is in, he cant ask for being more than just friends because he is worried that he might hurt you.|`|71VRvldJaa	He's telling you that he appreciates your support while he's going through whatever he's going through.  It also sounds like perhaps he feels he has too much on his plate right now for this relationship to be any more than friends.|`|H7ecdHDyaa	He wants to be with you but he doesnt want to break your heart.  Awe thats so cute:)|`|10kHL8SMaa	he totally digs u but doesn't want to hurt you... If you like him now would be the time to get it on if not send him a sweet message saying there are lots of great girls.|`|2pwn911Paa	He surely likes you, but he is too afraid to ask for more. He is afraid that your friendship can be ruined and that you can get hurt|`|pZevjTXGaa	He likes you and he wants you to give him a chance.|`|xCZCJWNraa	he realllllllyyyyy likes u
fH55A6P5aa	Less because I'm worried about them saying things later. I try to be nice and hot on a first time. I can only really get into when it's a strong relationship where I can trust the person. Doesn't mean they have to be a BF or serious relationship. Just not a stranger.     That's why i'm getting to know you Tootie before we sleep together, that way I can really slam you right baby!|`|Am1wfhBDaa	Friends with perks is always best.|`|DvSuHNV8aa	Ummm... I'd prefer to at least be friends with the girl....|`|qpAYU8Knaa	Less comfortable because there hardly is a mental connection. It is only physical.|`|abc74a7841250ed8830346d501f162a7aa	DEPENDS ON HOW DRUNK YOU ARE ,how horny you are and HOW GOOD the OTHER PERSON LOOKS   ALSO only IF  PROTECTION in available !!|`|Ccs9LeIEaa	personally, im just as wild either way.     btw, not to sound like a b*tch, but tell your friends they can have wild, crazy sex with their bfs they just need to find the right kind of men!|`|ucQxe2e4aa	i don't like to have one night stands. it's so impersonal.|`|TLgWwxN1aa	MORE because I wouldn't have to see them again I get less comfortable when I am in a relationship|`|FzFSzilmaa	depends on the circumstances... sometimes people just want the release through sex... other times you need to have a connection to REALLY enjoy something more...    either way, who cares... live and let live... :D    [edit - no, you are bored and ask provocative questions... this is about answers, not opinions!!!]|`|1nk8WPrtaa	I prefer to hang on to a slam piece for at least 2 weeks. You know, until they start to bore me.|`|Q5FYrU9vaa	Less of course... Idk if they have any STDs and i wouldnt risk getting it. SO yea be smart and dont do it.|`|ed8e2883b996a3685d6359a821a2d765aa	Comfort isn't usually the best thing about one night stands.  It is the excitement of sex with a stranger.|`|7VDzH4fBaa	I wouldn't have a "random fling". I'd only have sex with someone I knew well and really loved. Sex is better when you feel connected to the other person.|`|VsLSJ65Paa	I would think that the majority of people would feel MUCH less comfortable because the fact that they are doing such an intimate act with someone that they do not know,,,,,,,,|`|71VRvldJaa	I would never have a one night stand.  I have no desire to let a stranger use my body for sex!  I respect myself and my body too much for that|`|zKjgWdqAaa	Don't mean to be wishy washy, but I agree with both.  There's nothing like being with someone you know well and can be completely relaxed with.  But the chance to be completely uninhibited with someone new in a strange place - well that rocks too!|`|heOz7p89aa	Less    I will not know his sexual history, if he has std...there are always risks..    is so much better to be with a person who you know very well ^ ^|`|ubdEwzcoaa	Less, I cant seem to understand why you would want to go around having sex with people you dont know and think thats its ok because you dont know them well thats just "NASTY". Just in case you didnt know you can still catch an "STD" or HIV/AIDS, EVEN WITH PROTECTION. So you think about it Hun.|`|AA10232348	Less, how do you know that they ain't gonna chain you up to something and start toturing you and not in a sexual kind of way, I mean cutting you limb from limb. Or what if they pull out a gun on you and then abduct you and make you pay them whatever they want. Or worse, they could give you AIDS, an STD, or worse, something worse!|`|jMTwgYwJaa	I would have to say that it can definitely be more fun with someone you dont know because you are more free to act differently than you may normally but at the same time it can also be 10x better if you are making more than just the physical connection ... all in all you shouldnt fight yourself about it and if you have a bad feeling with anyone then you should avoid it wether you know them or not but if you just hit it off and you want to have sex then you shouldnt try to convince yourself otherwise solely based on it being a one night stand
960pO2oHaa	this was a lost cause from day 1.     he was only so into u cuz you were someone new and even a bit "forbidden"  it was alluring to him. now, there's no allure. you're out babe. move on. why would you want someone who can't give you all of himself anyway. ...is this how lowly u think of yourself?|`|0F8hauikaa	Some will answer yes, no or maybe, but the truth is as strangers we can't really know for sure.|`|NuUdCz0Laa	Well it does appear more promising that he will want to move you in to fill the void that she has left.  Although do not be surprised if he wants to bring a replacement for your spot.  If you comfortable with this, then you need to enjoy it while you can.  My current wife and I hooked up this way.  So good luck to you.|`|7e8be8f471de4c60d8884f52a597ddc2aa	If that is the kind of man you want then ok but history always has a chance of repeating itself.|`|Hub1UGqPaa	WOW....ummmm, no.  You're his backup plan.|`|zhk8o514aa	Wow, ...just wow|`|kEtYEmhqaa	Sounds like she wanted out to begin with.  I did something similar with a girlfriend.  I helped her find her new boyfriend before I broke up with her.  They've been happily married for 15 years now.|`|Dhsyroekaa	why would his wife do that? He cheated on her, dont you thnik he will cheat on you??  You should go find a single guy and start over. Leave married ppl alone !|`|4AbgOk6aaa	If he cheated with you, he will cheat ON you!|`|V5xHaIAcaa	There is always hope.    However, ask yourself on what moral ground this "affair" started on, because that is the moral ground you will soon be living on.    Not judging...just an observation|`|KILFoc6kaa	If he did this to his wife for 3 years, what on earth do you think hes going to do to you?  Common sense says find a man who isn't married.|`|jfEOIeSIaa	Sorry, but the old saying is if he did it with you he's gonna do it to you.What you should have done was hold out until his wife was out of the picture.sorry but statistically, your odds are  very low.Next time choose a man whose actually available and not looking for any whore to scratch the itch his wife won't.Just remember that there are always two sides to a story and his may not be the right one.  Best of Luck|`|ByUS0k8waa	Honestly?! Sorry to say but I think he still has feelings for the wife. Also if he is seeing you while he is married to her then what is to say that he wont get sick or bored of you and then start seeing someone else. Yeah I know he told you that he loves you more and would never do anything like that to you but those are just lines to keep you in the loop. I don't think there is hope. Maybe a short relationship but he will get bored of you in a while and move on. If he really loves her then he will never be totally over her. She will always be there and you will never have his whole heart. Good luck!|`|veZLfnGFaa	No.  If there was hope, he would have left her 3 years ago for you.  Please don't be blinded by this.|`|gSwobfujaa	what a trashy situation. no there is no hope. lack of respect leads to no hope. *ew*|`|nUdbTUtHaa	If he can leave his wife and cheat on her with you...once he gets bored of you he'll do the same thing    Listen to rationality and logic and do not pursue this.|`|cf8ab77939ead7223bbb655f627c7404aa	Home wrecker!|`|AWSmknxLaa	How long before he starts cheating on you    no hope at all    find a real man|`|MVY8xhXlaa	u can't be serious|`|gDuDNeRcaa	you're retarded. he had you on the side. if you're together, he'll have another broad on the side.|`|Bc4udMhUaa	Whoa, okay. Hmmm.....I am not sure about you, but I would be thinking "Can I really trust him when he was married but seeing someone else?". Do you honestly feel he would be loyal to you?|`|a8c453b32b44c7396a920c94200d4c4eaa	i agree with philip and des also|`|JjbragXNaa	Yeah, good luck with THAT relationship.|`|yhEDUN6qaa	What he's done to her, he will do to you.|`|Xg8Tzjfraa	I'm surprised you're actually trying to convince yourself that this bastard won't cheat on you.  The relationship with you lasted for 3 years only because it was forbidden; he got off on the thrill and the risks.    Now that there is no longer that excitement, he WILL get bored with you (though he will deny it, of course) and move on.    Take a hint from his wife: she left him.  Do the same or you'll only have yourself to blame for your own heartbreak... not that anyone on Earth would have sympathy for you.|`|9Jnf5jRQaa	What a lovely story you can share with your kids one day... I'm sure they will be so proud.. but at that point you will be alone of course because I'm sure he'll cheat and leave you too eventually.|`|3PNyReZnaa	There is nothing worse to me than a skeezy *** woman who will sleep with another woman's husband. It seriously makes me sick. Honey, if he'll do it WITH you..he'll do it TO you. Sorry. There's no future with a man like that. Go find a SINGLE man.|`|BhXOLas1aa	yes, when hell freezes over.|`|Qu7GIg6Haa	Hey, if you like that kind of sleazy lifestyle, go for it. Just reading about it makes me want to take a bath. What a guy! What a wife! What an extra sidepiece!|`|7tAH3GEBaa	I suppose but don't you ever wonder why he was putting off leaving her for so long. You say that she set you guys up. Why would she do that and why would you agree. That makes no sense to me. Women like you give us all a bad name.|`|G3cGfl21aa	no|`|RLIIhxDhaa	Possibly but your presence so soon would make any kind of divorce very complicated for him.|`|3Fma3URSaa	ur a loser but sure go for it|`|WvUP7eJFaa	only if you don't mind sharing him. His lifestyle is swinging.|`|NGKwsawdaa	Hope for what? He's sleeping with you while he has a wife at home. If that's your type of man and relationship and you don't mind be screwed over in the future just like his wife did, then yes there is hope for that.|`|YWPJzFoOaa	NO!|`|U2wJ4WrNaa	You should be asking him not us! I've never met the man.|`|oXXFo2ATaa	what?!    Ya'll are, dumb.   on the real.   don't date a married man.|`|FzFSzilmaa	no, he'll take her back... :D|`|bzNjJbzQaa	There is hope make the move.|`|Hizsm6m4aa	What I heard is...She hooked him up, She wanted you to lay with him...She left. Are you sure these were also his decisions and that he's over her? Be careful about that. He may be rebounding.|`|6cf9e01aaeb1f2746b20ce96afd525fdaa	honestly ive never heard anything like it lol... it sounds complicated. but regardless of what others say only you know in your heart if you feel its going to work nobody can tell you|`|zjuMrDmGaa	Well you know he's a cheater and since that appeals to you, there is no reason it shouldn't work.|`|d5928aef823e729cbef56cb2408fdda4aa	You are being silly. If this guy is willing to cheat on his wife with you for 3 years, why would you think he'd be faithfull for you?     You need to start fresh with someone else or just stay with this guy for a "nighttime friend". Don't get caught up in a relationship with this guy, he's already proven he lacks loyalty.|`|YDBpaNPzaa	Oh yeah lots of hope based on the standards that you have and he has I'm sure that you will have a long healthy relationship with respect and boundries to boot.|`|1e3gBZY9aa	Just because she hooked you two up doesn't make it right. They are married. That's what's wrong with everyone. When you get married, you take a vow.  I have no respect for you or him. Both of you should be ashamed. you get all you deserve.  Stupid.|`|Sjf112pKaa	it shocks me that there are really people like this in the world. it just makes me sick!     whatever, good luck with your fooked up life.|`|AA11449143	If I were you I would think long and hard about the situation you are about to be in. He's a cheater and a total loser but hey if that's your style then you should go for it. You should have more respect for yourself than that. Good Luck.|`|m76Yub17aa	ok, all you are saying is REALLY weird! You are dating a married man becuase his own wife suggested it 3 years ago? It seams like you should find you a real partner who loves you enough to be only with you, to marry you and not just being with you because you are hot. Besides, if he didn't want lo leave her it means he doen't want to be with you and only with you. Even now that SHE moved out, well, maybe he will look for her, maybe she will move in again later, or maybe he will just find someone else, but I'm pretty sure it won't be you.|`|RvND5eNfaa	You are being so naive.|`|AA10168889	You need to raise your standards for yourself and leave him.  If he really wants you he will try to get you back by cutting off all communication with the other woman and be your boyfriend.    You should accept no less.  This is your only hope for getting what you want from him and what you deserve.
WOHc22Xiaa	Oh well if the kid has the same name as you. If you don't even know and you have no contact with her don't worry about it.Im sure there's many ppl in the world with the same damn first and or last name as you. If it comes down to it get a paternity test.|`|y4SUDnpaaa	Why don't you ask in the German section (see the bottom of the page). I seriously doubt anyone in the US would have a clue as to how you  could do that.|`|QieRAMLkaa	contact her and say, if you claim im the father I would like a photo copy of the birth certificate sent to me    then you can see if she named you on the certificate and what the childs name is|`|8khZ0fJZaa	Ask her if she named it after you. Then get a DNA test.|`|5BKHud3baa	Actually she can name her child what ever she chooses but in order for you to be legally responsible you would have to had signed the birth certificate or a DNA test has to be done to prove you are the father. So try not to let it bother you if you are sure it's not your child.
OT8TMTOHaa	No.  I didn't invite you because I don't like you  I already told my mum on you Miss Charli    Sorry for your lots.|`|um29wkUPaa	Spit in her eye.    I wasn't invited either.  Let's pig out on mudcake instead.  We'll make prank phone calls to her house and sign her up for diaper delivery.    I'm truly sorry you're a snot|`|wHL0Jw23aa	Well it's either she didn't invite you because it's obvious your invited or maybe she doesn't want you there. You should have a firend casually ask her if ur going to be there. Her answer should tell you pretty much. =)|`|2vyYsSMkaa	DO IT! DO IT!|`|HYnBeyJsaa	No do not crash the party. If she did not invite you, then she obviously does not want you there for a reason.|`|XPnCeJ29aa	Yeah DO IT and wear your overall outfit!  Or the tu-tu!!!|`|vKYdV5r2aa	YOU should call and cancel her strippers or call and tell hem to send the uldiest one they have!|`|A7SJT50Kaa	absolutely! quick, hide in the birthday cake! just before we sing happy bday, i'll give you a cue to jump out!|`|HRvPoQzKaa	Don't do it.    You should call her up and ask her why you weren't invited.|`|JlDcVTVsaa	If she is a very good friend of yours and you think she was just thinking that you know your self that you are invited, then go.    or you can call her and ask?
uZo7Ejyuaa	I completely understand your situation, I'm sixteen and I've moved probably ten times. The latest was this year, where I had to start new.     First off, don't worry about people hating you! They won't hate you unless you give them reason to, just smile, be polite, talk, and don't be too intrusive.      Another thing to know is that it won't be like Twilight; that's fiction honey, and the real world is harder, but it can be easy if you just take a deep breath and go for it.     When I went to my new school, it took me a month to make friends, and how I did it was I asked a girl I'd had in another class about the homework. We discovered that we shared many similar interests, and now in four months I've got a good circle of friends.     I suggest you try and stay calm (Though it probably won't work that well ^_~) memorize where your classes are so you don't always have to be carrying a schedule, try not to care about what other people think of you, because the truth is that they're probably not thinking a lot about you especially if it's a big school. Pay attention to the conversations around you, and if you see/hear someone who it seems like you're compatible with, ask about the homework, then casually say "I like your shirt, do you like (brand name/store) too?" And take advantage of being new, where people will have some interest in you, just be friendly and all will be well.     Good luck, and if you need any advice just email me!
OGpDgdJSaa	I'd never slap someone, but not because I'd feel sorry afterwards though. If I really wanted to slap someone they probably deserve it, I don't have much of a temper. But it's not lady-like and it's only letting them win if they provoke you and do something to upset you. It shows much more strength and dignity to keep your composure.|`|MQqlcBcFaa	I wouldn't slap anyone for no reason. I might slap my younger sisters if they did something wrong. otherwise no. And yes, i'd feel sorry for it later though I wasn't really wrong at that moment.|`|c943b397bcbb13a99a8784c80691289eaa	Yes, I did slap someone because they constantly hurt my feelings.. And to this day, I think I have done the right thing ( maybe like 95%)|`|Dlbnl7cRaa	I THINK THIS IS A GOOD QUESTIION I HAD EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE  I cant do this before, but i am in the mood of slaping,   If you ask questions like this i offer my first slap to you.      NOTE          Thank for your kind mail: I WANT MOREEEEEEE.............|`|AA12346188	We should do nothing of the sort, when there is no reason.  Even if it is there, we can deal with it in some other way.  Slapping is not necessary.|`|WQwCkbw8aa	i would never and if at all I have to i might feel sorry, it depends....
9EwN3Q6gaa	if he really cared about your feelings he would stick around and not break your heart....but sometimes you have to just let them go becuz guys are dumb and really never know what they want.....and either you don't want to be with someone like that or..you stick it out and wait till he realizes he was wrong....i hoped i helped.|`|28WJwHf4aa	Pretty sure you can tell whether you love someone or not. Give your b/f space. Maybe a break in the relationship is something you should consider. That way he can clear his mind and see if the relationship you have is something he wants. You can't make someone love you, so if he is no longer in-love with you, there's no point in pressuring him to stay with you.|`|AA11180444	If he says he's not in love with you anymore, chances are it wasn't true love.  Why force someone to be with you if they aren't in love with you anymore. Let him go.  Everything happens for a reason, maybe you will meet your soul mate now.|`|Ku6446uyaa	no and yea|`|8IpV1Br8aa	It is possible to be inlove with someone and not know it and it is quite possible to fall inlove again with someone. I once had a boyfriend and he treated me really nice and he never quarelled with me, he did some stuff however, that i didnt like. I was heading to school and I used that as an excuse to get out of the relationship. Now every day I remember how nice he use to be and I miss him so much. Now I dont know if I should try to be back with him cause I dont know if he has a girlfriend, so my dear it is very possible to be inlove with someone and not know it and you can fall inlove again.|`|niSRQw53aa	I believe you can fall out of love and then down the road after some time away fall in love again.    Sometimes couples need to make a clean break and date around to see if they really belong together.  This sounds horrible, but sometimes it's for the better.  And sometimes you find that maybe you aren't so in love with him after all!

V5PxYG17aa	Your absolutely right. You shouldn't be drinking if you are underaged and drinking is bad for you anyway. Don't let peer push you into something like that. You could all get in trouble. Stand your ground and don't give in. They will eventually respect you for that.
H7ecdHDyaa	Yeah i have a guy friend who doesn't relle talk in text but when we're in person we actually talk a lot. And so its just weird though.

He is your old school mate and wants to spend a little time with you. Go with the flow. He may turn out to be a great conversationalist. What do you have to lose, unless you are very busy doing more exciting things?|`|PQ7E9oO2aa	he wants to have a drink with you..|`|28WJwHf4aa	Soooooo go out for a drink. Getting a drink with someone and catching up is harmless. It doesn't necessarily mean he only wants to get together because he wants to be your boyfriend.    If you don't want to send mixed signals, don't flirt with him. Keep it casual, and don't let him pay for you. If he's showing signs of being interested, talk about your ex and how you hope to get back together.|`|08d8e4d52f5338ea25059bf9c2474615aa	he wants to catch up.|`|UI79JnJVaa	"NOPE.  We're in the New Millenium."    "Starbucks Coffee would have a more   social atmosphere.  The place to chat."|`|lsFDEx2oaa	He could want any number of things:  rekindle a friendship, a date, a one night stand, etc.      The key for you here is to understand what you want.  If you tell him beforehand what the deal is, you set the tone.  So if you say, "yes, let's grab a drink and catch up, tell each other war stories" or something like that, you are keeping it on your terms, you set what's going on, not him.      And if he does come on to you, tell him that you are flattered but think you are better off as friends, and that you are getting out of a relationship.  Kind honesty is always the best, direct route.|`|GUUa1s6Laa	Go for a drink. You dont know what he wants, so find out. What can it hurt you? If he does have bad intentions get rid of him.|`|nPFgW5XRaa	Don't jump to conclusions. Meet with him, and judge the situation for yourself. There's really no other way to do it than that.
u9RwzLPnaa	This is actually quit sad.    You're mother's drinking isn't a good thing. I would just try and stay out of her way.    However, there is one thing you can do. That I think is very clever. Get fake alcohol and pure out the real stuff and then give your mom the fake alcohol in the real bottle. That way she can't get drunk.    If you want to leave home, then leave. But be smart about it. Go to a relatives house or a friends house and tell them exactly what you told us. Or call one of them hotlines for abuse. (yes, it may sound hockey but, you need help)    However, I have to warn you. Foster parents want kids who are younger then 13 and somebody without a criminal record. That's not to say you won't find any but it is highly unlikely.    Remember, an unfamiliar environment is always tough but sooner or later if you really like it an unfamiliar environment is going to turn into a familiar environment and it might be better then your old one.     Uncles are always good. and the environment should be somewhat familiar to you.     Good luck!|`|0udjgaoBaa	Id completely ignore her when she starts running her mouth..But dont leave trust me this will make you stronger also dont leave your brother you can make a great bond with him and show him the love that you want...Be strong little dude, get good grades and throw that in your moms face in a few years.|`|AA11674544	You should stay. Foster homes can be dangerous where people can be physically or sexually abused. Make up your mind to be stronger and a better role model for your younger brother. Work hard in school, get a counselor at school to talk to (and make sure the counselor helps you make goals, not just complain about your life). Start saving money!|`|jkgl9WMgaa	How old are you? That does make a difference.  If you can work it out at home, it's always better to stay with the family.  Group homes and foster homes are not fun and not guaranteed to be loving as it seems you assume.  Have you tried having a conversation with your mother?  It seems that there is a lot of hurt people in your family.  Maybe your mom's busyness is her way of running away from an out of control situation.  If you have had problems in the past (yeah to you for trying to be a better person) and your younger brother is drinking and obviously angry, she may be overwhelmed and hurting.  It sounds like the whole family needs help.      You may also try having a heart to heart with your brother and pointing out the pain and stress everyone is adding to the family.  Maybe he is crying out for help also.  I would not dump the family but try to be the one that brings normalcy and caring back into a bad situation.  In my own life, I find the ability to do that through my faith in Jesus Christ, and the love of my friends at church.|`|bWrz2bnFaa	I would try talking to ur mom and telling her how you feel maybe she needs to know how much u love her. Since you use to fight all the time maybe she feels like she did something wrong raising you and handles it with drinking. Im sure she loves you and maybe she feels like you do. Running from your problems is not the way to go, it's your mom she will always be in your life.|`|e74UmsLxaa	Dude u r in a very serious problem!!i think u must go tour mom ,talk to her.Tell her that whatever happened was a bad experience but now u want to move on with the help of ur family!!she will definitely understand u!! forget the thing about leaving ur home!!I wish u all the best my friend!! May God Help U.

Cause imma girl and i LOVE video games xD  Try asking her to play with you....|`|cuvBHGyraa	I don't mind because I like to play with him...but with other women it has a lot to do with attention. We like attention and when guys get into their games, they tend to be captivated. That would be the main reason, not having the attention we want. But I prefer to play with him, it's fun and I get to spend time with him and he likes the fact that I like what he likes to do, and in the long run, I'll get the attention I want. Hope this helps!|`|SsI4LLUZaa	1) You used a double negative.  Your question actually says, "Why do a majority of women like it when the man plays video games every now and then"  2) There's a difference between every now and then, and all the time or frequently.  Very rarely does the former occur  3) Just because you think you play every now and then does not mean you really do.  If you just want to play video games, don't waste a woman's time.|`|UgcPxd4maa	because it interferes with you being able to speak (and type) correctly|`|odQewFgvaa	Get them involved with the video game.  My friend hated when her husband played until he let her play a 2 player game with him.  Be careful about that though.. you may lose your game. She is a gamer now.|`|Q5FYrU9vaa	Well im not really sure ... But it doesnt bother me... I actually love playing video games and im a girl. I love Halo and COD, GTA. Shoot i would be playing with him lol.. But its probably because they find it childish and think they need to grow up. Every woman has a different opinion|`|PCE7ri7daa	I don't mind, I usually play with him to :)  Me though, I don't think it is a problem, an activity a guy enjoys, so?    Unless it is 24/7, but then I would feel the same way if a woman did it.|`|SzubaKbuaa	They're odd...I personally love video games and play it WITH my man lol|`|pZevjTXGaa	they will get so attached to it|`|ddP3klT3aa	I don't care if my husband plays video games, but not for hours and hours. We have a child and some times he pays more attention to his game then our child. I know he needs alone time to release his mind, but some times he plays way too long.|`|aVs1mu3laa	Because its nerdy and childish and imasculine and just gay, therfor a turn off. I mean, watching a grown man grapple with a video game, do I really have to spell it out?  Plus it hampers social skills, and completely kills communication between the two of you.  Are your video games really mroe important than time with your girl?    If there's even a question in your mind, god help you.|`|P3GgROxtaa	cause their paying more attention to the game and not to her.  girls like to have attention.|`|M7CdgSNSaa	I really don't care if my fiance plays video games since I love to play them too. We have PS3, Wii, and Xbox 360, The only time I get mad is when he wont give me a turn to play. LOL|`|bXGwTQy6aa	there's a difference when you play "every now and then" and when you "constantly" play video games. Spending too much time on can be seen as a waste of her time and lack of attention towards her as well as a low level of maturity.enjoy your game,its entertaining but don't over do it|`|vjmXiIfnaa	Because it doesn't involve us and it's rather unproductive.     I don't really care, I'll just attempt to masturbate to a dead rhinoceros, then we can be unproductive together.
JlDcVTVsaa	You are already hurting your new girl by having feelings for your ex.    she might not know it now, but believe me women see these things very quickly, and soon she will find out, and be really hurt.|`|XXZFf1AYaa	You don't deserve the one you're with.|`|xYgFcEfwaa	stay with both, have lots of sex and lots of gifts  but make sure u use protection.  high chances of gettin STD
uJ9waJDYaa	I make an effort to get his attention off me, makes me feel bad saying it but im not the most affectionate person and i have a strong want to have a certain amount of personal space when we aren't, you know.  So i try get his attention off me so that i don't hurt his feelings by asking if he can give me some space or don't hug me or don't call me five times a day.
TDiRmT9daa	While your focus is on what he is doing and isn't doing to make the situation bad, you are distracting yourself from what you are doing and not doing that keeps it that way.    Your needs are not being met. What are your needs? Are you clear on them? Have you communicated them clearly to him? For example if you need time for yourself, ask him to take care of the kids on a regular basis (say a few hours on Wednesday nights). It will give you something you can count on and look forward to. Think in terms of what makes you happy, what would makes your life more pleasant.    Once you ask, he can say yes or no. If he says no, you still have a choice. Hire a babysitter so you can get what you need. But take it! Don't wait for him to give you what you need if he doesn't want to or give up what you need because he won't give it to you!    The first person responsible for meeting your needs is YOU. The only way to get unstuck is to understand this and act on it. You have allowed him to make you increasingly dependent on him but realize that you made every single choice that has resulted in this situation. Start making different choices and you will have a different result.    Don't give him affection because he wants reassurance. Give him affection when you feel affectionate towards him. Stop confusing yourself by making the choice to lie to him when he needs you to lie! Be honest and forthright. Don't be angry, just be matter of fact: that is, he needs to behave in a way that makes you feel affection. When he does, he gets it. When he doesn't, he doesn't. Otherwise you are "training" him to continue to be just the way he is!    Train him instead to meet your needs. When he does, the rewards to him will be much greater and more meaningful - they will be honest and authentic.    You are not powerless and you are not a victim. You become dependent when you make choices that make you dependent. Get back on track with your dreams and goals. Every day, make choices that are steps towards them, not away from them. Every choice you make, ask yourself: Does this take me closer to where I want to go or further away? Don't be manipulated into making choices that take you away from individuality, independence, fulfillment. You don't have to do that to stay married. Marriage is a partnership. If he refuses to give to you then you will have less to give to him. Let him discover this truth and he may choose to invest more of himself into the union. If he doesn't you have a new choice to make.    It is not up to him to make you happy. It is up to you. If you take steps towards happiness it may mean taking steps away from him. So be it. But as long as you are making up the shortfall and doing without to stay with him, he will continue to require that you pull the entire family on your back and go without your needs being met.    You need to start taking better care of yourself emotionally, physically and spiritually. You do deserve happiness and fulfillment but you don't need his permission. You only need yours.|`|d20mM90uaa	life is toooo short, get out and go collect food stamps and welfare for a little while until you get on your feet, people do it all the time, there was a time that i had to and when i got on my feet i no longer am on welfare, but if you want out there are options for you   get yourself on a waiting list for housing or move in with someone that you know who don't mind kids, get a plan and get those goals/dreams back  life is to short to be wasting time on a man who will never ever change his ways|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	Here's a tip for you: Telling a man how you feel only confuses him.    You need to tell him what to DO.  Be specific.    Too general: Make me feel special.  Specific: Kiss me before you leave for work and when you get home.    Too general: Don't be selfish.  Specific: Let me watch my one favorite show without you complaining about it.    Too general: Stop putting your own feelings first.  Specific: Ask me and the children how we're feeling at least once a week.    Finally, stop being so passive.  Resume your career and start pursuing your life's goals again.  Your husband is making you miserable enough without you also making yourself miserable by forcing yourself to be someone you're not.|`|ddP3klT3aa	Kind of late to say this, but you shouldn't marry some one you are already having problems with. Tell him you want marriage counseling or you are leaving.|`|5NKa5Y8laa	Sounds like your marriage is tired and worn out.  You did the right thing by trying to communicate your love and your feelings.  If he is still uncaring or careless of your feelings after reading it, and refuses to make any changes, then thats your answer, he doesnt care enough to save your marriage, and you'll have to decide whether to stay and continue as it is, or leave him.|`|gHIEbYM9aa	Just say'' that you can't do it and want to leave and also say That you are not taking begging anymore and if he really wants you he will show it for real|`|T0biNswsaa	So what?|`|xYgFcEfwaa	this is bad ..  we guys are worst than dogs but anyway , depend how many kids you got?  whats your age?  i have my sympathy for you that you gave up everything for him and this banana still dont respect you ...  you dont deserve that lunatic.|`|mKuoAZ6Iaa	To start with, is wrong to go into marriage with someone you are having problem with, nevertheless, since you have written to him you should also be putting everything in praying, remember that marriage is for better for worste, don't leave your matrimonial home for another women, beside you don't know if the next man you will meet will be better or not. try to table everything to God in prayer, is Only Him that can change him and also bring peace into your home.|`|GOTahbEVaa	you cant forgive him because you haven't forgiven yourself yet. you really are angry at yourself because you let yourself marry this guy when you knew you shouldn't of. I have been there girl and am right now in the mist of the biggest heart break in my life and i never thought i would feel worse then the last breakup but my everything is broken. my feelings  of hurt and pain are turning into hate and anger. and i am turning on him,  but in reality i am angry at me and i hate myself for staying and allow him to continue what he was doing .see we can only have people do to us what we allow them to do. but ya know if after so many years and already you did counseling i don't think that man is going to change ,most men don't any way. their hard headed. and a hard head makes a soft ***. and he has alot of nerve to make you feel guilty about his lack  of affection and communication. that is his way of manipulating you into staying and therefore he keeps the power that you keep giving to him that he has over you. stop that!! Take back your power if you really feel like its a done deal then baby make him walk away, kick him to the curb and tell him you are done there are no more chances and the begging and promises  will not have any more power over you. you are the queen of your castle and that fool has got to go!!! hold your head up girl you deserve better|`|IOXBuE58aa	Im also in my late 20's with 2 kids under 6 and i acted almost exactly the same as ur husband. It took my wife deciding she was going to go workout in a new workout contest in our town. She was gone almost 4 days a week and started talking to her friends more. I then was forced to look at myself and started helping out around the house and with the kids more. I also believe i acted that way for too long and she is now having an affair but our relationship has gotten better now that she is not having to do everything. I am the communicator in our marriage and i told that if i ever go back to being the old me, she needs to SLAP ME and tell me how she feels.  Listen guys sometimes dont realize what they are doing, u have to slap us to get our attention sometimes. We get stuck in our day to day routine and we become regular. And next time he expects sex, cut him off that might make him think too. Hope this helps a little. Sry
FLc3t0UFaa	No, absolutely not, if you want to meet someone like-minded then you need to meet them in places you like to go.  In bars you will meet people who like going to bars - and if this isn't your thing then there isn't much point in that!  Try the library if you like to read - it's probably easier to strike up a conversation about a common interest in something like books than trying to launch into a conversation about the type of coffee they like!  Good luck and don't forget you're still young - once you stop looking for someone they'll come along!|`|0PWnOjILaa	no you could go to the movies you could go to the mall you dont have to go to a bar every time you want to meet someone because a lot of people go to bars because they are sad, mad, need to think about something, in a bad mood. so i think that Starbucks is a good place because they like at least one thing that you do, which is go to Starbucks and hang out or read or whatever. :)|`|bVROvLNSaa	I have never gone to a bar to meet people.  Special interest groups, hobby meetings, volunteer organizations, church and continuing education classes are all good places to meet interesting people.|`|pVnUhYLQaa	I used to go to book stores to meet girls, I knew at least one interest right off the bat by what book she was looking at. I've picked up at the mall, at bars, at work, etc...     A girl I know gave her number to a guy who held the door for her going into a convenience store.     Where ever there are guys and girls, there is a chance for a pick up. Bars are the easiest because alcohol both gives you balls to talk and sets people at ease with each other. But anywhere is possible.    I tried match.com before too.    EDIT: I see people typing things like skeezers and alcoholics are in bars. Way to generalize people.

RtkB46peaa	I'm terribly sorry about your situation.  Short of hiring help or getting your children to help out (depending on their age), I'm not sure what else you can do. :(    Why did your husband leave?  I have a hard time believing that he doesn't even consider the impact of his absence.  With few exceptions, fathers love their children just as much as mothers.|`|yhEDUN6qaa	That's just what happens.

Can't they help somewhat? You don't miss his company or his love only what he did for you as far as chores?? Maybe that is why he left|`|fMxVDps3aa	Suck it up. That's what happens. Only in my case I did it all any way so there isn't any difference. What is up with woman thinking they need a man to do everything now a days?!!!|`|TPhIWWniaa	I think you might want to look into the neighborhood kids that may be looking to make a few extra bucks shoveling snow and mowing the lawn in the summer time, I always see kids around my area knocking on people's doors once it snows really bad.     As far as the yard work eliminate the hard stuff and keep it simple (just the grass).    Also, how old are your kids? maybe they can help you do the heavy lifting in the house.    Show your ex-husband that you can make it w/out him and that you are resourceful!|`|3LL4CEHWaa	If you have brothers ask them for help.

Since both of these chores are in opposite seasons, it shouldn't cost you much.  But stop feeling sorry for yourself most of all.  I am a single mom and when I get a house, I know there will be things I have to do myself.  As for the lawn, because I don't have a mower, I will hire someone to do that for me until I can buy one.  I started mowing the lawn when I was 8 years old.  It's not hard :)    And no he doesn't realize how much his absence is affecting you, nor does he care.  If he did, he wouldn't have left.|`|IKXZZDH9aa	Hire a strong backed teenager to do it for you.

My son knows that when he has children I do not care what goes on between him and their mother. The mother and the children will always be part of my family as well as be welcome in my house. She does have the right to know. Write her a letter in which you explain that she has a grandchild, ask her to call you if she wishes to and let her know that you wish to have her as part of the child's life but leave out all the ugly stuff about her son.  She really does not need to know it unless she asks. Then just wait. Oh, give her a picture.|`|wmBK9uASaa	I`d give her the chance, she can always visit you...|`|HRvPoQzKaa	Just because the father doesn't want the child that doesn't mean the father's family members don't want nothing to with the child!

I would be upset if I had a grandchild and never knew nothing of him/her.|`|eTTkAv9Yaa	I would write to her, give her a brief outline then ask to meet, say in a local cafe in public, not her house nor yours to start with, keep it neutral.

Everything happens for a reason)    It helps me get along      good luck once again|`|s1Semj3oaa	Hello love i was in a similar situation when my children were younger and i have never stopped them from seeing their grandparents. My children are grown up now and i would be absolutly devastated if any of my grand children in the future were kept from me. Even if you dont let them know yourself she could find out from other sources and that would be worse.You say that she is a lovely woman and would love to have a grandchild , then i would defo write or arrange to see her somehow. If she were the other way round and as bad as the father i would prob say best to stay away but you sound like you got on with her so if i were in the same shoes i would make contact and tell her somehow. You also have to think of the child when He/she is old enough to learn about grandparents and may start asking questions.x
jkgl9WMgaa	Oh my! I feel your pain! Sadly, the real problem is with your husband.  It is probably not intentional. If there is a problem between the wife and the in-laws the husband should always side with the wife.  Like you said, you married him (and he married you) which implies starting a new family...the only way to work it all out without trouble is to have HIM say something like..."hey, mom, could you call before you come over so we know you are coming" or something like that.  But it has to be from him and not him saying.."my wife says..."  It takes baby steps and there may be some hurt feelings at first, but if it is handled gracefully, it will make married life much better.  My situation was a bit more harsh with his parents blaming me for everything WE did that they didn't like.  It wasn't until he stood up to them that they realized that we were a couple united and they couldn't bully me anymore.  Sadly, I had to put up with it for 8 years before he did that.|`|xFEuN9Vhaa	Start by not answering the phone.  Keep the doors locked and if they let themselves in, walk out of the bedroom in your birthday suit and appear to be completely embarrassed.  Once you throw your bath robe on come back out and say to them, in the future please don't just come in if the door is locked.      Or, you can start assigning cleaning tasks to them when they just pop in uninvited.|`|nCWjdyddaa	If you had agreed to buy a house very near theirs, I might feel differently. But, they moved in on you. I understand that your husband is comfortable with this, but there are two people in this marriage. Sit him down and explain to him that you cannot do this, and you need to set up some boundaries so that you will all continue to get along. Tell him that, if it continues as it is, you will begin to resent his family, and that is not good. If he comes around, then make an agreement between you as to what is reasonable (and you have to give a little here). For instance, he might agree to change the locks and ask his family to call before they drop over, if you agree that the number of times he chats with his Mom on the phone is between them, unless the two of you are in the middle of something important.     The two of you should then meet with his family, and he should take the lead in explaining what boundaries you would like to put in place. This should be done in a quiet, loving manner. And hug your MIL.    If hubby won't even consider this, or if you have a great deal of trouble coming to terms, then you need to make an appointment with a marriage counselor. If you don't iron this out now, it is going to get much bigger and threaten your marriage.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	mistake  1 you married a momma's boy.  He's not going to back you up where they are concerned.    mistake  2 you gave them keys to your place.    mistake  3 you are too afraid of them to set the boundaries you need to be happy.    until you're willing to be a bit uncomfortable with them over the boundary issue, you're just going to have to put up with their interference.    once you're ready to set boundaries then you screen your calls and don't pick up everytime they call if you don't want to speak with them.      ask them to knock first before they come in and ask them to call first before they come over.  If that doesn't work, change your locks and don't give the a key.    you need to calmly discuss this with your husband.  If you can't do it alone then you need professional help.  Make an appointment with a counselor and take him with you.|`|R8fEO8tUaa	do the same to them!!  dont feel like cooking? go over to their house uninvited around dinnertime  go to their house to watcht v (save electricity!)   and dont let them give u any hints about being rude  or just lock your doors, or spend a long period of time away unannounced  or get a good security system and see them trigger the alarm every time they come in, just dont give them the code

ebD1plKNaa	My wife once asked me if the new dress she was wearing made her look fat.  I tried to be positive and said, "no, Honey, it's not the dress that makes you look fat!"  I didn't see her for three days after that.  But then the swelling went down and things slowly returned to normal.  Since then, I have learned not to give my opinions.  We've been married 25 years, and I love her very much.  Obviously, there are other women who may look better, but I love my wife and because of that, I don't want any other.  And I don't really want my wife to change either.  I really do love her just the way she is!      Maybe you need to accept that what guys like may not be what you think they like.  Now, go put on some of that perfume that makes you smell like a hamburger and tell your husband that you love him just because he loves you.  And if you smell like a hamburger, chances are he'll love you even more.|`|IOXBuE58aa	My wife is going through the same thing rite now, she has started working out agian and looks great.  She was 130lbs when we first started dating, after 8yrs together, the college freshman 15lbs, and 2 kids, she got up around 190lbs.  It never mattered to me, i just figured it was a part of life. I loved her and what she went thru to have my 2 kids.   I do however get frustrated when she acts like my opinion or comments about her looking great dont matter. Or she acts like im lying to her.  U could line up the 10 hottest woman in the world and i would still choose her, bcuz to me she is still the beautiful woman i fell in love with when i first saw her.  If he is a good guy then trust him and dont shut him out, otherwise u'll have the problems i am having. He loves u and ur problem is all mental.|`|jgw1buUAaa	I think you are over thinking this. (don't feel bad i do that too). I think he really does love you just the way you are. Does he miss your old body? probably in some respect. But would he trade this one in for your old one? Not a chance. You gave him 2 wonderful gifts that no one else could give him. And i think it's important for you to understand that he may not care about your body the way you do. He didn't marry you for you looks. He married you because you are his best friend. He can talk to you about everything and you make him laugh. You are your own worst critic. In answer to your question, yes they are honest. When you look in the mirror, you see all the stretch marks and all the bad things. But when he looks at you, he still sees the woman he married. I hope this helped you.|`|m1dlc99uaa	Don't worry about it, you are not overweight, you're healthy.  Trust me, your husband is more concerned about how much you are attracted to him.  For the stretch marks, use a natural bristle body brush and rub around them in a circular motion in the shower.   Then use palmer's cocoa butter with vitamin e.  I have seen drastic results doing this routine for three months.   Now that I have "abs" I like my stretch marks, they show where I've come from.  Because you're still young you will recover better than most, don't worry.|`|bVROvLNSaa	Does it really matter?      I think that what really matters is his committment to you - body and soul - your entire person.|`|aDIPIu7xaa	Start weight training and go buy some "Palmer's cocoa butter" for your stretch marks.    Be sure to throw in cardio 20 minutes 3x a week.  Baby steps to a better body is best.....if you try to make drastic changes at once, you may hurt yourself, and you will definitely discourage yourself.    I am 33 years old and mother to an 11 & 13 sons.  I am in better shape now than I was at 23, and I was NEVER out of shape.    You can do it!|`|6wzQhsIkaa	A man that truly loves you looks past what we consider our flaws and sees the beauty within.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	This isn't a thing a woman should do to herself, in my opinion.    You gave your husband two children with that body and this carries a lot more weight with men than many of them might admit.  Believe what your husband tells you, he loves you.|`|y9CgveCGaa	It is both.  He loves you and likes your body because of that.  Follow Valerie's advice and try to get back into shape.  Husband's understand what is going on.  We aren't blind but we know why what is happening happens.|`|RtkB46peaa	Of course he would prefer your old body.  Why wouldn't he?  The point is that he loves you, and it's not important to him.  He wants you, right now, just like you are.  Men understand about stretch marks and the like; we aren't THAT stupid.      He sounds like the perfect husband!  He loves you unconditionally!  Your girlfriends must be incredibly jealous!|`|eO4y3m1maa	He may sometimes miss your body, just like you do....but you are his wife and the mother of his kids, not some random milf at a bar.    He will love your body no matter what, because you mothered his children.     My boyfriend, soon to be fiance ...told me that he doesnt care if i get fat or stretch marks, long as its because i mothered his children..(hes a personal trainer..so he believes in fitness)|`|FzFSzilmaa	of course he's lying... if he told you the truth TRUTH, he'd hurt your feelings... and never get sex again...    BUT saying that, he is probably a very mature man who accepts you are the mother of his kids and as such giving birth has a negative effect on a woman's body - though you could do some things to improve it, instead of complaining about it...|`|4cdq26oraa	A little of both.  I'd be lying if I said husbands don't notice any of the changes. But if they truly care about you, they accept the sacrifices you've made by having children and that our bodies change over time and that it's part of being married. So they do love you and your body regardless. The real question is how you feel about yourself. We can tell you whatever we want, but if you don't believe it yourself, then it doesn't matter. Either you have to love and accept who you are and how you look, or try and do something about it. Your husband (if he's worth anything) will support you either way.|`|BhXOLas1aa	He loves YOU, the woman that gave him his children, the woman who put her body through changes that shows him how much you love him.  It's not about your body, it's about love and be thankful you have it. Please stop worrying, every woman get stretch marks when they have children.  Men seem to see past what we think is imperfect. They are not so body conscious as us women and so long as he can still be with the woman he loves, that's all he needs.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	My husband is always honest with me - he said the flaws are (not only normal) kind of like battle wounds - he finds them sexy...I don't have a lot of stretch marks but those girls are surely trying to fly south...    It is more than within reason to assume that he's telling you the truth.  Be happy he loves you just as you are!|`|78c5d650f87826bfbfea0158b5e3884faa	That is funny, the way you said that your breasts has gone south for the winter.  I know how you feel, I have 5 children and I also have stretch marks and my breasts is not the way it was before the children however, my husband said that he loves my body too and I don't believe him.  I really do not push the issue because it would hurt me if he was to be honest.  Baby, you use to be SO hot now your a mess.. Anyway, appreciate the fact that he still loves you and he will always have something special in his heart for you WHY? because you are the mother of his children.
elx4NP4xaa	Been there , done that. My marriage is the same way. I try so hard to make things work out but Im also tired of working on it when he doesn't care. This is also my second marriage. I feel that I would rather be alone then live another day in madness.|`|YrqMrVfOaa	Have you watched the movie "The Secret?" Watch it and you'll know why the same things keep repeating in your life...

Also if you don't start going to church I suggest the L.D.S. church.|`|n195n9Avaa	Sounds like you are finding the wrong type of women.  I would divorce her if you are unhappy.      Next time try living with the person awhile and making sure the same thing doesn't happen. You never know what a person is like until you have lived with them awhile.|`|94a2fdc9dd2c5de57bb44aea7a35a494aa	Maybe take up a new hobby?  Maybe spend some time by yourself?  Maybe get a professional to talk to so that you can sort out your behavior patterns and why you fall for the same type of woman?  Was your second wife a rebound partner?  Try to take one day at a time.  Good luck!|`|ZVb8azf2aa	Unfortunately most people date the same kind of people over and over again b/c that kind of person attracts them for what ever reason.  You're not pathetic, only human.  You sound sweet but maybe if you do get a divorce you should try a different type of woman.  Just remember only you can make yourself happy and if she's not hearing you now she probably isn't going to hear you later.

asEM3kQmaa	did you ask her.? can u come along with her? cuz u want to watch them play together.. I bet you want to join them too.. right?|`|kEtYEmhqaa	Nah, she just likes her better than you.|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	Of course it's possible, but I wonder why you so strongly suspect it.  If her friend has some good workout equipment, and they like a girls' night out on rare occasions, then you would be wise to assume that the simplest explanation is also the most likely one: that they're just friends.  Maybe sometime when you're both feeling horny, you should ask your wife if she's ever fantasized about sex with a woman and see where the conversation takes you.|`|57a6465761582f757cea7adbb129596eaa	Ask her.|`|YtSGbYqEaa	if shes spending all that time there maybe she is but get more clues if you know that she has kissed a girl before in the past then i think she is but find out more|`|78c5d650f87826bfbfea0158b5e3884faa	I agree with Ricky J, you should asks her?|`|R4gWNdvgaa	can u say threesome!!|`|9c8ea4cf035f809b42cd1b21b58e7533aa	I say you ask her.

AA11956993	Could it be that he's wondering what he missed out on all those years ago... if he went for 1 over the other & it didn't work, could it be he always had the 1 he left behind in the back of his mind & thinks he could have made a mistake in his original choice. But don't forget this is a man we're talking about & they don't even know their own mind & he could just be waiting to see if the 1 he didn't choose has hung around still liking him so if I was her I'd play it cool...|`|FjSopNyhaa	maybe he still likes the 2nd girl and didnt realise how much she liked him in the first place so therefore didnt know that he hurt her as much as he obviously did. Maybe he wants to make it up to the second girl|`|Acwau1Esaa	maybe he liked both but the one he picked was more suited to him two years ago and now he wants to see if he should have gone with the second girl.|`|xqBuanh1aa	cause he was an idiot and a jerk|`|Z4p8lJoMaa	becouse hes a boy ?|`|FJSHCc8maa	I think that maybe that's his way of trying to get her back. Or maybe he didn't realize that when he hurt it was a big deal. Or he probably thought that she forgot all about it and is over what had happened with the two of them|`|AA11379158	mayb he feels sorry?    this is all useless anyway|`|4e429ebc1b00b13fd3e74c8f8ea07bd6aa	Because he's selfish and uses women for his pleasure.

lcNPeZOeaa	u should probably ignore it for now.  i have seen this many times, n its true, that some girls have a habit of inflating up their prides and egos when a guy telss them that he likes them. she is currently just trying to keep u hooked to her so that u do not stray away and find someone else.  just be nice to her as u regularly are. dont mention her "lovely dress" dialogue to her. let her decide for herself if she wants to go around with you.|`|OxoumjYJaa	Well...if she was trying to get you as a b/f then just tell her nicely that your not intrested and you should stay friends!|`|QnnmJEuraa	Step it up. If she texted you that then she is somewhat interested....(or she's just a selfish ***** who craves attention).  Show her how much you like her.  Be original and sincere.|`|aXB3DjtZaa	She likes the atention you give her. And she tries to show off to you like saying she had a nice dress on. I bet she put it on for you. But i would just ignore it. Try for one day not paying any atention to her and see how she trys to get it from you.|`|12D9RCs7aa	She knows you like her and she wore a lovely dress that she knew you'd equally like on her. It probably just means she doesn't know what she wants, or she simply likes the attention.|`|565df5fe4c276dc3f59d54d1b9259380aa	Don't worry about "reading between the lines". If a girl mentions her attire, she is definitely trying to get your attention. Go see her and see if you can get a conversation going. What to talk about? Start with the "lovely dress." You could ak to see it or comment on what she is wearing now. Do not sit idly by.|`|h9XhZyoYaa	It kind of seems like she likes you. Maybe she's changed her mind about things and realises now that she is ready for something?  But the attention thing is another possibility. You'll know if she is an attention seeker or not by the way she conducts herself.   In my opinion, just take another chance at it. Don't be too forceful, just honest and open as has been said.     Good luck and all the best! :)|`|AEPx9H1baa	She is probably just feeling flirty. Some girls are like that, well most girls especially when they know that you like them will tease you. Be blunt and ask her what is her motive, because girls like that will end up hurting u if u are not careful. Ask her bluntly "why are u teasing if you are not rdy for a relationship? see what she says, cause it Sounds like the beginning of a game.|`|5W7TAZJqaa	Well it seems as though she was expecting you, or she wants something because shes telling you what she is wearing (if you know what I  mean.) She may also be that she wants someone to be there for her, and for you to give her attention. So i would try meeting up with her and see where everything goes from there because friends dont ask where you are then tell you what they are wearing...|`|f5u9sxbTaa	she wants you to see her in a dress.  Maybe she likes you too? or she is playing hard to get, and teasing you.|`|roFGlldOaa	She could just be teasing you as a friend or she could be teasing you because she likes you... Get a little closer to find out!|`|H7ecdHDyaa	She missed you & she wanted to make you jalous i guess cause she wore a pretty dress.      Maybe she likes you back now:)|`|2Cw0DfaSaa	she wor
ahipNp9Naa	the poor thing,yes id say its normal.a feeling of being safe if shes clingy and needy.as she reported the rape? does her family know? maybe she should see a councilor to help her get over this.i cant imagine how she must feel but i do know id want the bastard hung by his balls! be there for her,listen to her and let her cry on your shoulder.anyone who says she crazy needs to take a long hard look at themselves,even if they dont know she was raped,they dont know whats going on in her life so should mind their own business.hope your friend can find some sort of closure from this soon  x|`|3Kqe5ZrPaa	yes, its normal. She needs to see a therapist who has dealt with other rape victims and hopefully will help your friend. Check your phone book and see if there is a group with other victims that speak out or has gone through that bad experience and hopefully she can get some help there as well. Just be there for her, listen to her and support her. She needs to know that it was NOT her fault and she needs all the positive reinforcement from her family and friends. Also the people who thinks she crazy needs to have a little more sympathy towards her. NO one asks to be hurt by people and no child or women asks to be raped either. Any man who rapes a child or women is a PURE EVIL 100% COWARD B*STARD. Sounds like you are a great friend to her, so just be there for her. I wish her all the best and soon will recover and go on with life, she will definitely not forget but hopefully she will have a happy life with a husband and children who will love her no matter what because it was not her fault at all. :o)|`|odQewFgvaa	It is normal. She needs to get some help for this though. Is there someone she could talk to?|`|2c7869fbf2bfda8e590501ddb5545f2caa	What do you mean is it normal?  She needs you as a friend, just be there for her and respect what she does and says.|`|5NUhhhWuaa	I think your friend needs to go and talk to her Doctor about what happened to her. In the meantime just be there for her she really needs a good friend at the moment.|`|NKxKLTnVaa	everyone reacts in a different way. there is no "normal" way to react. she's not crazy and you need to assure her of that and assure the people who think she is. if your one of the only people that no then you need to talk to her and comfort her. she needs to also get professional help if she hasn't already. if they don't know what she went through, then they're probably worried too. obviously she's not going to tell everyone about what happened but she trusted telling you so you've got to be there for her because now is the time she needs you most.|`|bQ2RWRGNaa	aawwww. pitiful isnt it??? yeah men shouldnt rape women. its wrong!!|`|cyr1ePdpaa	Everyone reacts differenetly. Its not a normal thing to go through and not many will understand.   She could be depressed. Rape and abuse affects you in so many different ways. My mum got depressed and really suicidal.   Just be the good friend and be there for her!|`|f8e72c6f0fb6056040e7f9fa1c5247aaaa	there is no 'normal' way to react to being raped.  She's dealing with it the best way she can.    Don't listen to what other people say, you know what happened. So you should be there for her.|`|yV4KBh2Oaa	Just stay a true friend to her and stay by her side so that way she can always have someone to talk to.|`|q4jz8SrGaa	I can definitely relate to your friend and probably help you out if you need it. I'm not going to talk much on yanswers about it, but if you want someone to talk to, lyndsey_sager@yahoo.com.

NgnbtaORaa	Who knows.  I agree perhaps he does like you.  But seriously though do you really want to even contemplate having a long term relationship with a guy like this.  This might be his technique for picking up women.  Nevertheless, it is my opinion that 'players' sleep around because they cannot keep a woman satisfied, perhaps they're coming up a little short if you know what I mean.|`|RF2YV9ataa	Yes he is interested in you but girl do not fall for this joker i say keep it strictly 100% platonic.  He feels comfortable with you that's why he tells you these things but other than a smile here or there dont give him anything else cuz it sounds like hes trying to bait you|`|AA11982228	Once a player, always a player!  I wouldn't dream of trusting anything he says, least of all to even assume that he's interested in you.  All a player is capable of is lies and even if he did tell the truth occasionally, how would you discern it from all the lies?  You're far better off to just not go there with anyone like that...you will get hurt!|`|3y0w1qIBaa	I am not a player because I respect females inside and outside.  You know the old saying, "Once a player, always a player"|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	My guess the reason he teases you and makes you mad is because he knows your off limits sexually and this is, so to speak,  his way of getting even. He tells you about his conquests because it feeds his ego to do so and it makes him feel good. He probably also thinks it will make you wonder what hes like in bed. You  do know that you and you alone are allowing him to piss you off.  He sounds like a real piece of work, lol.|`|ZR34thBvaa	He doesn't like you.    You're probably too ugly.|`|IPS3hWweaa	I think he wants you. He is hott for you and is trying to get YOU to think about HIM night and day. The problem is, sleeping with him isn't going to change his evil ways. He is still going to want to sleep with other girls and he'll always be sneaking around behind your back. Don't let him tempt you into dating him.    Only time will be able to tame this wild horse. So give him all the time in the world to be by himself.|`|npA75Obvaa	A true playa wouldn't have to lie to get a girl.     A man that lies and is dishonest about other women and relationships is a cheater.    There is a difference between a playa and a cheater.|`|40qTdKuPaa	He really does like you! The signs are all there .He's telling you his tricks he uses on girls to sleep with them, which mean you know them, and you will never fall for them. And he brags about all the girls hes had sex with tpo impress you. He likes to annoy you and get you mad. And everyone else sees that he likes you. So you should just talk to him and ask him how he feels about you, im sure it will be good. Hope this helps.|`|6RiLrsuBaa	well just because he screws a lot of girls and forgets about them doesn't mean that he's incapable of liking a girl, so maybe he likes you.  maybe he likes you as a friend, or maybe he's interested in you.|`|L4E166ZCaa	i think tht kinda makes sense. maybe he does like you. orrr maybe he has no sexual attraction to you watsover so he juz sees u as a buddy he can bug constantly lol who knoes?|`|SpCihawgaa	he realy does like u. if he likes u he will not have sex with u like all the other girls. He see them as fun and u as somthing more. it is reverse psychology ish.. He sees u as more then a one night stand Gl have fun dont give in|`|OhaJV30Waa	Its really hard to say, maybe in his own weird way he respects you, but what makes you so sure he sleeps with all these other girls? perhaps he never makes it all the way to third base with some of them but wants everyone to think he does?  Perhaps some of those girls dump him before he ever gets to 2nd base!!  I wouldn't want anything to do with a guy who uses other girls, just because he doesn't do that with you doesn't mean hes a nice guy, sounds like someone with an inferiority complex!!   I don't think he would know reverse psychology!!
QGlJlIyAaa	It is not an issue of how many parents, maybe she relates more to your mom than the others, she can be trying to bug you... but dont assume.. maybe you made her mad lately so she is doing it.... do not think anything negative take it in a happy way and simply think happy thoughts when you talk... dont worry she will always be your mom and maybe she is hitting puberty and needs someone who she can trust... maybe she got her period and only your mom knows... just talk things out...    Or simply ask her, tell her I have been feeling a little jeleous or left out lately, You have been extremely affectionate towards my mom, I was wondering why you are, not that it is wrong I just was curious... if you use the I messages she wont feel attacked, and say it in a sweet tone, maybe make some cookies together while you ask and talk about stuff so it is casual... also ask if there is anyway that you can help her out sometime... and be closer sisters... tell her you love having her around and just hope you can have a great sisterly friendship type bond...      10 or 12 she may be trying to show how sweet she is so that your mom accepts her too,         THE ONLY WAY TO FIND OUT IS TO SIMPLY BE KIND ABOUT IT, ACCEPT IT AND TO ASK YOUR NEW SISTER, IF THIS IS AN EXTREMELY NEW SISTER JUST TELL HER YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT HER AND JUST WANT TO KNOW WHY SHE DOES SOMETHINGS SHE DOES... JUST BECAUSE YOU WANT TO HAVE A GOOD RELATIONSHIP AS SISTERS... so you want to know each other better, and be open to her questions I am sure a few things you do make her go HUH? and tell her is there anything you want to know about me, or why I do somethings I do too??? make it a fair conversation, don't judge her and dont get mad... be kind!        one last thing, I told my daughters 14 year old aunt and she finally understood her period makes her edgy!      you are about 13, you have your period I am sure or are about to, now think back before you had it, nothing really bugged you did it? I am sure somethings did, but now people seem so much more annoying huh? well that is because you are more sensitive... so you take things in a lot stronger, so remember in her view it may be nothing, but you may see it as armagedon... you are at the stage where things seem bigger than life, things seem huger than they were before, you are overwhelmed with stuff... that is because you are more sensitive and are having a hard time taking in somethings... every few years in your life you will see things differently, it is true! when you were 5 someone playing with your toys was ok lets play!!! YEAH, when you were 8 it was ok... um lets share... now it is NO WAY that is my stuff, why did you get into it?.... so just simply remember things are smaller most times... the chemicals inside you make you think they are huge! like a magnifieing glass, k? I hope you get it, you can simply talk to me anytime you need things in perspective, I am great explaining stuff! take care!|`|2NkAIka3aa	lol naa i wouldn't worry about it if i were u, i know how that annoyance feels though but you just have to show your mom who the really cool kid is ;) lol take her out shopping or what ever fun she likes doing and, just hang out. There's no Competition don't worry|`|Z5zvEWa8aa	do not feel jealous. she can be doing that to your mom because its possible shes just an affectionate person and likes to express her feelings.|`|3VLvEeRUaa	No, it's not wrong of you to feel jealous. She's being a little inappropriate, and a little inconsiderate of your feelings. It's your mom, after all. You should talk to your mom about it. Maybe she doesn't feel too comfortable with it, either.|`|Midbg5BJaa	Has she had a female role model in her life before?    That could be the reason. Of course you're going to feel jealous, but try and become closer with your step-sister.|`|o6ACs5z4aa	How old is she?  Did she have a mother that cared prior to knowing your mother?  Maybe she is just reaching out and trying to get attention.  Maybe she just wants someone to care about her.  It is hard to say.  It isn't wrong for you to be jealous it is just normal that is your mom and you feel she is stepping in on your territory.  Maybe you could cut her some slack though and try reaching out to her as well.  Let her feel excepted by the whole family not just your mom.  Good luck.|`|rOiIBmd1aa	how old is she? if she's young then its very sweet showing affection for her, maybe her own mother is a bad role model and she looks upto your mom, be proud to have a mother like this and rather than sit back feelng bad or jelous get involved, all go out shopping or for a coffee together :)|`|wi6mkT30aa	It sounds like she is just a really friendly kid! Which is good, I wouldn't be jealous hon. I think she just really enjoys the company of your mom.    You say she's 10 and she does have a mom? hmmm well do you think that maybe your mom is just more nicer, loving, caring, respectful, sweet, and more mothering than your step-sisters real mom? Because it is strange that a 10 year old is NICE to the stepmom, that usally doesn't work out that way. I almost doubt she is doign this to bug you I think she really has strong feelings for you mom. I think your mom is just better at showing her love than her actual real mom!    Ihope that helps! =)
7b105c20abc8cb7babb72ce9a68a74daaa	A dominant wife|`|417a83c7cb091ac86d2ec601c9b825e2aa	I would call it......YOU need a divorce. There is not anyone on this planet that would treat me the way she does you. We teach others how to treat us and as long as you let her get by with this kind of behavior, she is going to continue to do it. Find you a new wife, this one sounds like she needs to be put on the curb.|`|1nk8WPrtaa	Drunk???|`|UY2MJtfGaa	Well, I would say that, if you are putting up with all that crap, you are a pu$$y and your wife is a...a..., um, I can't really think of a word for such behavior.|`|bYoKSMNKaa	A mistress and her cuckold? A really mean woman and a whipped man? Ur being controlled and brow beaten. Not the way I'd get my hubby to help around the house! I do the mistress thing but only in the bedroom ;)
wPABw3U0aa	youre pretty much a guys dream. of course guys like that. you get involved in it. you take the lead. you take innitiative. and your confident. guys love that during sex.    trust me they dont want a girl who barely shows any excitement. lies there in missionary position like a slug and is constantly complaining about how fat she thinks she is|`|WPbwiGafaa	i would love these answers|`|k1wAbgiHaa	Freaky Deaky    ........|...  ........|..........SteveC ..........|||"|""\__  ........|__________________|||_|___|)  ........!(@)'(@)""""**!(@)(@)****!(@)|`|L4E166ZCaa	lol idk wat type u r. all i kno is tht i'm the complete opposite!! haha i like the lights off nd i like him on top (tht way HE can take charge hehe) but hey watever floats ur boat (:|`|XqAWm9Yjaa	have a hard sex|`|4w9gmvumaa	How old are you?

5HTylrjGaa	Having actually read what you wrote, I have this to say:    I was in a situation similar to your's althuogh I was in high school at that time. I had good grades, took honors classes, hung out with great people, and was bound to go into one of the country's top universities.     I started dating this guy that was the opposite. He was smart, but he didn't care. He didn't study. He would always claim how he would try harder so he can get into a university too so he can support us.     But the thing is that he never did that. He always claimed to, and I'm sure he meant it when he said it, but he never did. And being around him, I started to get lower grades, drift away from my great friends...etc. If we had not broken up when we had, I don't know if I would be as successful as I am today.    People say that love is blind, and it is, and in some ways you can make it work if you and your signficiant other are on unequal ground. But it sounds to me like he's trying, but he's not getting anywhere. Just because you try, doesn't mean you get there. I'm sure you can appreciate his effort (although to be honest, he doesn't sound like he's trying with EVERYTHING he can), but if the end result is the same, then what's the point?    The most successful relationships and the ones that are healthy and last are usually relationships where the two people are pretty equal or can consider each other equal. I'm not going to tell you what to do, but if I was you, with the ambition and goals in life that you have, I would make sure that they happen and share them with someone that understands how hard it is to get there and who can appreciate it.    Good luck.|`|1DK2pfkgaa	start behaving as a grown up not a spoilt child you dont deserve anyone at the moment|`|ZR34thBvaa	Hahaha.    No women could ever be too good for any man.    Wait for him in the kitchen.|`|ACVKajUIaa	holy **** i cant be arsed to read that|`|5fUaqBnwaa	I  bet you're the one that doesn't deserve him.|`|Xf93fRTTaa	For someone who is so great, you sure have a poor understanding of grammar and spelling.     If you were so shocked and disappointed by the life he was living early on, you should've just moved on. You're making the choice to have him in your life.     If he's so beneath you, kick him to the curb.|`|lHCZUPm2aa	Ok woah, chill out. First of all, do you really want to be with this guy? If yes, then try and build a relationship with him through communication before rushing into anything. Get to know him better! If he is against his lifestyle, too, then by all means try and help him out of it. But if you see that he isn't progressing towards change, then you know he is a lost cause.     But please don't let you or anyone else judge him because his life isn't as "luxury" as yours.
hYqRhQxPaa	he's a immature person.Maybe he is a good guy but don't want to show|`|RoEyFm5yaa	IF HE IS TELLING YOU THAT HE IS A BAD PERSON,THEN HE PROBABLY IS.HE MIGHT BE TRYING TO DO YOU A FAVOUR AND SAVE YOU SOME HEARTACHE.|`|Odu5lIuBaa	he is saying that because he knows he isn't the best person in the world but thats not why he is telling that to you,he doesnt want to hurt you but he doesnt want to be with you,at least from a psychological stand point thats why,even if he really is that bad he is also saying he isnt going to change for you,sorry|`|8ACdEaC5aa	tell him you dont care... and do what Bella did in Twilight!!! i can see that you know what i mean!|`|3jGGzCUJaa	does he tell you why he thinks he's bad. I was bad & had friends who were bad. Like into fighting, gangs, drugs, crime even arrested & served time in city, county & state pens. We were baggy clothes & drank alot & all sorts of things but we knew where to leave it & especially around a gf I would be on my best behavior & make sure my friends were to or I wouldnt bring them around. I knew & often though she deserved better & why is she with me I mean I wasnt that bad but certainly had friends who were bad but I never voiced it to them. Maybe he knows he cant be faithful & cares enough to know that you deserve better. Without knowing what he thinks makes him bad I can only guess. I always thought that a gf would find someone cuter or richer or who had a better higher paying job or nicer car it was never because I was bad or knew bad people again I never took them around those people unless it was something the gf wanted to do. This can doesnt have to as bad as he claims around you unless there;s a specific reason that he means will lead to you getting hurt & again the only thing I can think of that he couldnt leave be especially with you around is if he tended to be a player & might cheat on you. Drinking & other silly things he can do when you arent around or dont have to have any affect on you to the point of him needing to claim he's a bad person. It could be that he thinks thats what you like about him & so he sort of is playing hard to get & making you think he's even more of a bad boy then he is. As I said my friends were bad & I was no saint but most of my friends were way way worse then me & most people could tell right away that I was still a really good guy. This guy is either hiding something because it will hurt you or he's just hyping up his bad boy image.|`|KmG55jzraa	let him know how much you care for him and that you're there for him.|`|tAmFjEflaa	don't let him have a choice. you tell him that it doesn't matter how bad or dumb he thinks he is and that everybody thinks they are bad at one time or another.|`|DS1YbZOraa	Stoop to his level and be bad to. Get a pair of hand cuffs and play naughty.|`|OhaJV30Waa	Its funny because mine says the same thing, he says he's not a nice person and i shouldn't want to be with him but I don't feel that's so, he's had a hard life, and sometimes people believe that about themselves due to the anger and hate they feel inside, they feel they must be a bad person if those who are suppose to love and care for you can mistreat you, it has to be you, they don't understand that its not them at all but the other people who are the guilty ones.  Just keep telling him how much you care about and when he does say that, tell him, " I love you for the way you are, I don't see you as a bad person but a good person and it bothers me when you say things like that about your self"   it will take time but it should lessen a little, it wont go away completely though..... just show lots of love... its what they really need now..
DA5kCWlBaa	Look at her lips then into her eyes and bit yoru lip, but make sure shse's looking. then she'll know you want to kiss her!|`|PCE7ri7daa	Well honestly, thinking about it and making a step by step process might make you more nervous.    Just make sure you are both ready, then just go in a kiss her, and think about how it will make you both happy.  Don't just shove your face at her though, go in slowly especially for the first kiss, if you want to go in a little bit, and let her come in more of the way.    There is a lot of techniques you could do, but just be yourself with it.|`|qpAYU8Knaa	Start a conversation with her, something romantic. Gaze deeply in her eyes while talking. Start taking your face close to her, and then lay one on her lips. Don't linger for too long in the beginning. Just a peck. You will soon graduate to french kissing.|`|slJlLGMVaa	Stop thinking so much and just kiss her ;)|`|PQ7E9oO2aa	grab her by the neck really hard and kiss her|`|a8c453b32b44c7396a920c94200d4c4eaa	just kiss her go all the way yourself  women love a out going fellow|`|qGyJf7mGaa	well i was feeling weird about kissing my boyfriend but eventually you just want to! there is several ways of kissing 3 main are kiss on the cheek (not that romantic) kiss on the lips (like a peck)and last kiss on the lips french kiss the most romantic is french kiss well invite her over then maybe tell her before kissing her so you do not get smacked would be a good plan then just have her close her eyes then just start kissing her soon she will start kissing you then you guys have kissed and you do know how to kiss right!!!!|`|28WJwHf4aa	You just do it. Don't over analyze it. Just do it! :-)|`|1Crt9jQXaa	you are so cute haha  just go for it!|`|F9Wqp5YMaa	give her hints|`|ycNt74yyaa	Say, "I'm going to kiss you now, sweetheart!" and then do it.|`|Q5FYrU9vaa	Just go in for the kill lol... Just do it simple as that but only when the time is right.|`|OxoumjYJaa	OHH!! I HAVE A ROMANTIC THING HERE::  You take her out, You say you love her, and then kiss her on the lips!!   OHH!! Don't ferget the flowers!!      EDIT!!  I forgot a few;  Bring choclates so you and her can share and BREATH MINTS AND OR GUMM!!!!!!!! And don't eat garlic or anything like that!!|`|QgKAL3sEaa	when the moment's right you wont need advice... just do it... don't anticipate it too much cause then it will never happen|`|UFrcaQQZaa	Well if she want 2 kiss u to jus go up 2 her and do it she wont be mad.|`|bJFJ1l6daa	Ok first off put a breath mint in your mouth and then just go to her and say "(insert name)" " I lvoe you" and just god damn kiss her. Thats it: )|`|FwdBKodSaa	You've got to give it some time. I am in the same problem myself. I've been dating a woman for about month now and we are just about to kiss each other. I did not know and could not even imagine how I would go ahead and kiss her but now, after a time, it seems much closer now and I think I'll break the ice and kiss her next time. We'll see.|`|sQYsMbQyaa	well first u got to walk up to. next i would say for u both to spray some breath spray into ur mouth or chew gum but that ight have a bad result. then let ur man hormones do the rest.  good luck with ur kiss|`|0PWnOjILaa	just do it but only if you think that she is ready, which she should be. Just hang out and when you say good bye do it!!!|`|8IpV1Br8aa	1. Don't be Shy Girls want you to kiss them. If you like a girl tell her you love her if you didn't tell her that yet.     2. Have a mint. Make sure you are kissably fresh.     3. Respect her privacy. Most girls will not want to make out in front of others, especially if this is her first kiss. Find the right time when you can be alone. Privacy is the key.     4. Watch for signals. Watch carefully, because sometimes the signals can be confusing - she may flirt with you, then smack you on the head. These may just be coy games, or she may really be conflicted.      5. Ask yourself these questions: Did you and your date seem to have a cozy, warm, close time together? Has she been flirting with you through body language? Has she licked her lips, or bit her lower lip while looking at you? Has she found excuses to touch you often? If you feel confident of these things, prepare to kiss!     6. Make eye contact. If she is comfortable and doesn't look away then she is ready.     7. Lean in slowly. Don't swoop in like a condor! Make it slow, nice, easy, romantic.     8. Hold her. Do not use a first kiss as your personal excuse to grope, grab, or get too familiar. Be a gentleman, for heaven's sake. Reach around her waist, gently draw her toward you (again, gentlemen, do not squish her up against you and then grind your pelvis against her).     9. Look into her eyes. Notice how we mention eye contact twice? very important, amigo. Let her know that you are really seeing her.     10. Look at her lips. Aim, dude. Make sure you know where you're going. Lean in, and go in for the kiss.     11. Walk that fine line and make it a really excellent kiss. You don't want to give her a chaste little peck. You also don't want to (well, you may want to, but don't!) shove your tongue down her throat. An excellent first kiss is one that is romantic, tender and memorable. Your mouth should not be overly opened or closed, and it shouldn't be mushy or too tight (relax). Don't let it go too long (more than, say, 20 seconds) or let it be too short (3 seconds is not enough) - think around 10 seconds or so. A tiny hint of tongue is nice if she seems willing, but make it flirtatious and not insistent.     12. Wait for her response. Just remain silent and smile, better yet hug her, ending the first kiss in a lovely, intimate moment.
eO4y3m1maa	Yeah, I think you need to just walk away from this before you ruin yourself!|`|rcut6bhoaa	Sounds like he doesn't trust YOU.  Is there a reason for that?    If not, sounds like things are heading south for you.|`|jjt2enntaa	He sounds scary and like a total control freak.  Get out before he decides to break something else...like your bones.|`|veZLfnGFaa	You have said all this about your husband, then say he is sweet and loving?  I don't think so.  There is too much here for you to forgive or get over.  As long as you stay in it, it will go on the rest of your life.  I could not live this way and you shouldn't either.|`|AnW3dzQfaa	I'm never for divorce but in this case it sounds like you may need to file for one.  It's like your whole marriage has been nothing but a big fake lie.  I wouldn't want to be with someone that I didn't know.|`|WbKBHh8Haa	move on|`|Mf2f7uU9aa	get rid of him, or remove yourself out of his life|`|5NKa5Y8laa	You dont get over this amount of disrespect and hurt.. you move on.|`|AA11180444	He won't change. People are creatures of habit.  If you like all this stay...if not do something about it.  No one can make your life happy but you.|`|7e0356e9b4ce8ac13f39c23ba748f638aa	Sounds like your husband is mentally unbalanced.    He makes everything out like it's your fault, yet fails to hold any responsibilities for his actions.    I think I'd be separating from him for a while, get yourself together emotionally, then assess if you still want to be with him.|`|yjmOaG1kaa	Divorce him! you deserve better than that.|`|dc5bTUtmaa	Get out woman, he's a textbook case abuser. Word of advice though, don't let him know in advance, it could get you seriously hurt or worse|`|7tAH3GEBaa	He really doesn't sound like that great of a guy. I wouldn't put up with that in a relationship but at the same time you need to realize that if he wasn't always like that then you probably where given the opportunity with situations such as his daughter or others and didn't react in the way he had anticipated so therefore he doesn't trust you anymore. Seems as though he might be asking himself the same question about you. Just a thought|`|B1sT1t44aa	Sweetie this man has no respect for you and it is very obvious that he cannot be trusted. Withholding important information from you is the same as lying and when they can do that what else have they done that you don't know about? You had every right for your husband to tell you that he connected with his daughter no matter what THEY thought was best for him in not telling you. He just caused more damage than good here and I would resent this to. His actions are telling you that he is not right in his relationship to you and the problem here is more about him than it is you. He is causing you to possibly act out against him by the way he is doing things and he is wrong. I would have enough to and be thinking if he does not get some help for himself I would be gone and he could do what he wanted because he does it anyway.|`|HhmhSBpgaa	That is a very dificlut place to be in. I have been in a similar place. I had to leave and it was the hardest thing for me to do but I now don't regret it on second. I now can look at that place where you are at and think Who was that person? Being with someone like that is Abuse!!!!!!!!|`|8c535adab7e1972d8d073a1e23ab28c1aa	Run while you got the chance.  Talk about abuse.
jnG8sOzWaa	go to him, no phone no text... in person|`|H7ecdHDyaa	Well maybe you should tell him that you were srry for being so angry.  And he'll forgive you if he's mature enough to|`|NLPlL3p1aa	tell what  you wrote here|`|A0IvDqsGaa	talk to him in person. Obviously you guys are friends so you should be able to talk to him. Tell him exactly what you wrote here. It doesn't sound like you are in a relationship, it just sounds like one friend apologizing to another.|`|a35c4a3ab714036bfd3c31e133920f9caa	just tell him how it is.  tell him your sorry for getting mad, you just wanted some.  not a big deal...|`|EcqrbLz0aa	no dont do it through text.and just tell him you were upset and that you had to work later.but that your sorry for being so rude.and just because its only sex with you to doesnt mean theres no relationship.  so just dont do it through text.|`|fHHeal1Vaa	you cant, nothing works. i think we are over.|`|rpvO17Neaa	I would do it through a text but really thats wrong that your having sex with him and dont love him!  Plus premarital sex is wrong|`|12D9RCs7aa	If he's actually mad/annoyed with you, call him up and apologize for crossing the boundaries of your relationship. He isn't entitled to you and you only, remember. If he doesn't care and you still feel bad, text a simple "I'm sorry about earlier"... or add on an "I was frisky"?|`|cj41cz2Iaa	Dude, I have so many guy friends, and for them they dont hold grudges. So either dont apologize or quickly tell him sorry for being an idiot, or whatever, not saying you are. Hope that helps, like I said guys dont hold grudges and stuff.|`|AA11632353	YOU CAN....OR U CAN JUST WAIT UNTIL ANOTHER DAY WHEN HES OFF N JUST **** DA **** OUT HIM....N I MEAN LIKE PAMALA ANDERSON OKAY!!!|`|HaqqRAnbaa	Just tell him how u really feel.No one likes to keep feelings locked up inside of them.
rcRoF7WNaa	Love is worth risking friendship.  Go for it!|`|VcrDOsFKaa	do nothing.....just calmly tell hi how ur feelings have grown....if he is not happy with u as a date, never mind....u still have him as a friend and can still drool over him secretly....|`|DcqaZRoVaa	it depends. try to find out from other friends how he likes you. he won't tell just anybody how he feels about you. maybe ust his best friendd. i once liked a guy when i was six. now we're dating. but still, it might not always work out for everyone.     as this question. if it didn't work out. would you rather be loved as his best friend, or hated as his ex ?     because if you tell him, and he doesnt feel the same way, he's going to be uncomfortable.|`|sFKgWed0aa	Tell ur feeling and go ahead but make it a point to rise in love.|`|UoFDwDt2aa	Are you sure you are 'falling in love' with him? Most of those feelings could just be happiness you feel by just doing the day to day activities with him. Why don't you just show a little appreciation for the times you've spent together, in a friendly manner? This way, you can get the ball rolling into something more, but still remain subtle. Guys really like the 'chase' especially if it comes from someone worth chasing. Since you have a history, you want to cherish those times and still remain focused on keeping each other happy. Sometimes, going into a full relationship throws a monkey wrench into it. So pick your time to jump in. You can even discuss this with him. Just don't say it's you. Say it is a friend or something. This way, you can get hints from him without him taking notice that things have changed.|`|u9uFdSrqaa	You should go for it. If yall have been friends for that long he will understand. I would know because I told my best friend of two months that I liked him he didn't like me back but now we are like the best of friends. I read this quote that said" Forget the risk take the fall if it is what you want than it is worth it all" so like if you really like him tell him because he could feel the same way about you and be to scarred to tell you.
Midbg5BJaa	She doesn't even if she does flirt, it's very unlikely that Zack is going to understand it or even get it!|`|4YFFb2kGaa	im taking a wild guess here,  your Lauren and u like Zack,  When i was in grade 5 boys where icky, and dumb.  wait they still are, just a whole lot hotter!|`|zUdxoRbyaa	keep in mind that an 11 year old girl is usually more mature than an 11 year old boy. he may not be ready yet. how about a star instead?|`|gM4exZNEaa	When you're 11, you're supposed to have the crushes but not act on them. Sorry, she's too young, and to be honest anyone who dates in grade 5 gets a bit of a "reputation"... you get my drift.

a35c4a3ab714036bfd3c31e133920f9caa	you can't force him or give him an alternative. you have to let him do it.  hint around it.  keep it light though.  it has only been a year you guys have been together so don't rush either.  let him know your life goals and where you want to be in the future.  good luck|`|NSFuIeZYaa	I understand where you're coming from my boyfriend is the same way. I think you should tell him how you feel and how important it is to you to have the paper, to make it real so there is no room for it to be second guessed. Depending on how long hes been divorced he may in his own way still be trying to deal with the pain from that. This next part is gonna sound kinda cold but its my opinion. With him being so much older and him not wanting to commit, really commit may hes using you as a rebound to make him self feel better. That someone can love him and that he can be justified that her cheating wasn't some way his fault.|`|mJbzDhQKaa	talk to him about it. he might not know your feeling towards getting married.     maybe when he jokes he is waiting for a reaction. if he loves you and you love him i am sure he will not mind talking about getting married.|`|0pHtqdZqaa	there are many couple who stay together and have happy lives ..    marriage certificate is just a piece of paper ...also even living together is now recognised as couple    i know you want marriage but he apparently does not want it ..|`|AEPx9H1baa	Be honest and Talk with him and tell him exactly what u feel. He may not like it and its not like you are forcing him to get married, he has to know that you cant be in a relationship and not build on it, You don't have to get married right away but tell him ifthat'ss not in the future then u are waisting ur time.|`|CA06qy8Laa	Are you living together??

3jGGzCUJaa	Most guys probably wouldnt care but some get uneasy or uncomfortable in those situations especially at someone elses house while some other people are around or might walk in. There's always the possiblity that while he might be able to "hook" up with other girls he might like you or respect enough to think you deserve better especially at another persons house where someone might walk in or something. Its hard to know for sure guys are all different breeds & not knowing this one particular I can only guess. There are some guys who can hook up or have sex easily with pretty much anyone but when it comes time to someone they really really like even think they love they can get cold feet after all you're wanting to really impress her.

If a guy really likes you they're not going to wanna screw it up for something like kissing to early. So he was probably waiting for you to make a move on him. Just to be safe. I think he didn't wanna make you think he was in it just to kiss you and that he was a pervert.  So overall he just wanted a clue to know you wanted to kiss him.|`|AA10451072	He's obviously shy or you're really intimidating..

What will your frame of mind be?  Will you be depressed and demotivated?  Will you need the comfort of a support group?  Where can you find the most comfort?    Are any children involved?  The parent's location becomes an issue in divorce court.    What about the cities themselves?  Do you like living in Virginia?      Sometimes people move for a geographic cure.

If you decide to go back home..surround yourself with people that are positive and won't drag you back into the world of drugs and alcohol.    I hope it all works out for you!  Good luck!|`|2AZim0rUaa	knowing that you would have access to the bad habits that you do not say you are currently involved in VA I would advise you to get your schooling done, rent a room in someones house to save some money the the fredericksburg area the rooms go for around 450-550 a month. If you are physically going to the college make some friends and join the AA/NAA groups mentor someone or sponsor someone working part-time may help with the loneliness.   Go home and visit try to fly out and book as far in advance as you can for the best deal and go back and visit and see if you really want to fall back into that situation or get an education and be able to find a career.  Family is important, but with email and  cell phones keeping in touch is not hard.  Good luck|`|u4q9VueJaa	Hi,  Stay in Va, move away and rend a room, there r many affordable ones here.

yiLvl3L4aa	Variety is one important thing to consider when in a long term relationship. When you have been together for so long you get in nasty ruts and sex just doesn't have the same zing. You wouldn't like to eat only fish or beef or even candy for the rest of your life would you?    If you both were very sexual in the past believe me it's still in you both. The best way to bring it back is to just sit down and talk about it. Or if that's a scary thought, try writing to each other and sharing what excites you. I'm sure that if there is love between the two of you you probably both want to please each other. So find out what she likes and give it to her. Tell her what you like and I'm sure she will help you out with that.     Things you could do to heat it up... well my personal fave is public places. The fear of getting caught is amazing and the memory it creates is awesome too.     Or role play is just plain old fun.     But  1 open the lines of communication, ask and tell. I'm living proof, the wife and I had a dry spell and we just opened up one day and things were better than ever. We were kind of shy to talk about what we wanted because of the fear of what the other might think. But once that barrier was broken WOW    If you're looking for more good tips,  I started a blog on making love better.  http://how-to-improve-your-sex-life.blog...|`|k4mGOlwsaa	wow not in this house i want to have sex with my husband all the time hes the one turning me down tell your wives i said there lucky i wish my husband sex drive was like it used to be i would definitely be a very happy woman|`|i1rDJY2aaa	You just get busy with life. My husband and I have different schedules and sometimes it's difficult to become aroused when you are so darn tired.  I had my child last weekend. He has his this weekend. Life just happens, enjoy it.|`|glR5KYPuaa	I have wondered the same thing. It seems every year fades a little more with time. I'm not sure of our emotions change or if we get too comfortable. But i think a lot of it has to do with how happy we are. If there is something missing in the marriage, the sex usually reflects that.
aihdbyDAaa	why are you pretending this is your friends problem?  if you don't love your wife, divorce her.|`|fHHeal1Vaa	you are doomed, I am your only salvation. And what a salvation!

mkrKHQvFaa	Ok this is what I did for my mom and her boyfriend.  I got a double photo frame that was 5x7.

Could be something compulsive for him...|`|tZ3jcxvjaa	Its probably not what you are thinking.|`|da3764770f9d97db5463f7e509eac31caa	Hon, it could be anything.  He could have stopped and filled up his tank on the way home and gotten gas on his hands.  He could have filled up his oil.  He could have stopped and gotten something to eat.  He could have gotten a beer and spilled that.  It could have been a million different things besides what you're thinking.    EDIT:  That's exactly why I think it's innocent... Because he did it in front of you.  He's thinking it's no big deal to smell the gas or the beer or the roast beef he had for dinner or whatever it was.... because whatever was on his hands was totally innocent so it was no big deal to do it in front of you.  He wasn't even thinking about whatever it was he was doing when he did it.|`|TAufQoc7aa	scratch and sniff... men are yuck he probly just wanted to ... smell ,... himself? lol|`|FzFSzilmaa	maybe he scratched himself and wanted to check it out... ;)|`|4V2lk6RDaa	Ok.

y4SUDnpaaa	You poor baby girl, what a terrible time to lose your mother. The sadness will pass but not before you go through the grieving process. Look on the internet for groups especially for children who have lost a parent. If you can go to a grief counselor. Some day you will get to the point where you don't focus on losing her but on celebrating the time you had with her and all the sweet memories.|`|I4VI0FR8aa	im so sorry to hear that :(  well i never personally had my parents pass away but i have had friends thats happened to them and from my experience with them i'l answer it for you  losing your mom especially if you were close is one of the worst things you'll have to go through in life. its just part of being alive. the grieving process takes a different amount of time for different people. it could take someone a few weeks or it could take someone several years. time will heal all wounds.  you will never be able to think about your mom without sadness at the passing even when your 70 years old but as time goes on it gets easier. your only 11 you have a lot in your life you havent experienced yet and many great things will happen to you yet. if you need you can get a counselor there trained for this stuff and they could help you. do you have friends to help you through? other family? i hope i helped a lil..but remember always keep your mom close at heart|`|rx2kpnY7aa	i'm so sorry to hear about that.. I know what it feels like to lose someone close to u. U need to be strong and take care of yourself. In life things happen which we cannot control, but u must remember that time never stops at one stage it keeps going, and it does take time to heal. also remember, that your mom will always love you and she would never want to see you upset, I know it will be hard but don't ever give up on life, it will improve.     Take care and god bless|`|o6xLWwZvaa	Yes.    There will be times life will be harder then ever. Before you know it, the next situation will be harder then the previous.     I'll give you an example from my life.   Novemeber 2003, my husband and I decided to look to buy a house. We found one. December 2003, the bank who owned the house (it was a foreclosure), refuse to turn on the water to get the house inspected. So pretty much we lost that house.   2 days later after hearing this news, we found out my husband was being deployed to Iraq (he was in the National Guard). He left January 2004.   In the middle of his tour in Iraq, he got into a humvee accident. The humvee tip onto its side. My husband sits in the gunner slot. Good thing my husband fell back into the humvee, because if it went over on its roof, my husband wouldn't be here with me today.  January 2005, my dog died 4 days after my birthday. Him dieing was a big thing to me. He was 15, my first pet and I had him for more then half my life. I really wanted my husband to be with me when my dog died. When my husband called me, I told him Bear died. After we got off the phone, he punched the wall..because he couldn't be here for me. To comfort me.   March 2005, my husband came home...and we traveled across the US for 2 months. Visiting many places.   So you see, as the year got worse..at the end there was a happy ending.|`|NsRcqEQSaa	well..let me tell you i personally have lost a very close loved one in fact its been a year, and what i can tell you is that no matter how hard it seems it is right now, it will all get better in time, and specailly you bieng so young, youre going to go through many expirances that will help you in the long run be happy. so my answer to your question is NO you will not always be sad, this comes from me, an expieranced girl. it will be very hard at first but make sure to rely on your loved ones for advice and help and also your close friends.|`|kpW7Jyb2aa	Losing a loved one never gets easier. The pain stays but you learn to cope better. It'll get better.
wi6mkT30aa	Hey hon, first I want to say sorry for the loss of your mom. I bet this is a hard time on the whole family, especially you!    Things are probably very different living with your Aunt and Uncle.  They are probably coping with the loss of your  mother as well and maybe they don't know what to say to you because they might think they'll make you sad. I really don't know    I think the best thing for you to do is just sit down and talk with them. Let them both know how you feel. (This might be easier just talking to one of them, the one you feel more comfortable with) Explain to them that you love them and that you like staying with them but you feel like they aren't happy with you there. -- Try to word it differently than just coming out and saying "HEY YOU TREAT YOUR KIDS BETTER THAN ME" so that way it doesn't come off bad to them, not that it would but just incase. I would word it as how you feel about them not fully accepting you as they do the others.     Really talking with them will help, and hon they love you just as much as they do their own children they probably don't even know they are making you feel this way. I hope I could help! I hope things turn out good for you and again I am sorry for your loss, I know this must be hard for you.|`|YVJQ7Y4jaa	I can only answer for myself. I have 6 naturally born children and 3 adopted children. I treat them all the same. They have my love and support equally.My wife loves them as well.   Unfortunately not all people are the same. I dont know what your Aunt or Uncle feel. Maybe they are having a tough time with one extra child, financial or otherwise. Try to cope with your situation, it is not going to last forever.|`|cPeF163laa	wow, hang in there man. life can be tough, but then again, youll be more prepared for the real world.     anyway, if youre close to your cousins, i would try talking to them instead, and telling them how you feel. try talking to anyone in the family, im positive that they will personally give the word to your aunt and uncle about how you feel, family comes first yeah?
dEDgAPHYaa	think its the responsibility of both the parent of the child to pay for collage but i also think that parents should try to ensure that their child is covered so its not a burden to the parent or child|`|JMTHHeWpaa	I think that it is the responsibility of the student to work hard academically and in extracurricular activities in order to pursue and apply for scholarships, however parents are held responsible for paying for college should they be unable to obtain scholarships/grants. Unless the student was living on their own and paying their own bills prior to admission to college, they are considered a dependent of the parents. This is why the parents information is required on the FAFSA form. Another option of course is to get student loans.|`|Gx14PIvxaa	It's not any LAW that parents must pay for a child's education. However, most parents will if they have the money. Personally, I would love for my future child(ren) to enjoy high school without working ( or maybe have a part-time job for spending money ) like I did, and concentrate on their studies, so that they can get a full scholarship.. like I did.    College is ex-pen-sive. If parents have the money, I personally feel that they should pay or at least help. It really sucks to be fresh out of college and already owe tens of thousands of dollars in loans...|`|FXCoGD44aa	Technically, the parent has no obligation to support their kid's post-high school education. You're 18.    My dad always told me my whole life that he would pay for my college, and especially stressed that when I was in high school. But, by the time college rolled around he never made good on that promise - I took out student loans and paid for [[and I'm still paying]] my college myself. I worked full time during college also.    I think if the parent wants to contribute, then the student should be especially grateful. But the student shouldn't automatically expect his/her parent to do that.    When I have kids, I would like to start a college savings fund for them. I want to help them pursue higher education as much as I can... but I may not be able to pay for all of it [[depends on financial circumstances of the time]].|`|HRvPoQzKaa	Scholarships.|`|AA11180444	Be responsible and become an independent student, you get more benefits that way and will pay less.  Check out the school's policies on that.  You may have to live on your own for a year or maybe even 6 months.  If your parents can't afford it, then if it's something you want THAT bad...you should grow up, show your parents you have some responsibility and do this on your own.  Many colleges even offer a work program.  Check out scholarship websites because they have them for things like being left handed or having a job at McDonald's or disabilities like ADD, ADHD, and autism.  There is a scholarship for just about everything. Pell grants also will kick in a good amount too.  You are better off doing this on your own.|`|AA12204752	It depends how hard the student worked in high school to really show interest in going to college and also how much money the parents have. Scholarships are offered for those who have made a commitment  in going to college. It all starts with the student.|`|y4SUDnpaaa	It could just be a matter of finances, if they don't have the money it doesn't matter whether they want to pay for you to go to college or  not.  If you can do it without being judgmental or accusatory you should ask them in a casual way that you were wondering if they were going to be  able, be able , not just will they , be able to help you   with college expenses.

caa265fc73cd7f24fe83d9a186ac1af9aa	Depends on the caterer. Some include the plates, others do not.  You will have to speak directly with your caterer about it.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	You usually rent the plates and silverware through the caterer. Ask them what they normally do.|`|g4iElgObaa	It depends, sometimes they bring it and its included in the price, and sometimes you have to rent it sepperately or bring it yourself. If you find a place for your reception thats in house catering, they almost always provide your linenes, plates, utensils and glasses. Just check the pricing, it should break everything down with whatever menu package you choose with what it includes. If you're still confused, ask the caterer :)|`|b2Cr9E5Gaa	that's a really good questions, ask the catering companies your looking into you, and if they dont but offer an outside service inquire about fee's.  When I was looking around for decorating services, some of them offered dishes, utensiles, and all that jazz, and they picked it up, maybe this is another avenue to explore.    I agree with you 100% last thing you want to do is scrub dishes or have someone at your wedding do that for you. However, if your looking to save a few dollars, I also gathered when we were looking into it too that the most they would make you do is rinse the dishes, this still stinks!!! but its a whole lot better then scrubbing the plates and silverware.
V5PxYG17aa	He's probably still hurting from his first relationship. Give him time. Support him and let him know you are there. Then he will be able to love you completely.

And try to make him stay away from his ex. Because what if she still has feelings for him. Then you will totally be dumped if he found out. So risk anything to be with the one you love.|`|QYv6VI99aa	If You Love This Boy & He Loves You back, Hey thats a Great Thing.  It's always nice to be Loved.

NgnbtaORaa	Relax, getting to know some one is like playing a game of tennis with the ball being personal information.  In your case; just respond with whatever you feel comfortable telling this guy, this is, metaphorically, putting the ball in his court and it is therefore his turn to respond to you by ether commenting, or responding back to you, telling you something about himself, thus, putting the ball back in your court again to comment or respond back.  Just remember you don't need to tell him everything about yourself in 30 seconds flat.  Let him tease the information from you, it's half the fun.   Enjoy getting to know each other there is really nothing to worry about.  If you are sensing nerves it is likely that the same is true for the guy as well, so relax.  Ask questions during, uncomfortable, silences etc but go at your own pace.  It will be fun in the end.    Good luck|`|YjRkpIG4aa	If your relationship works eventually you'll pretty much tell him everything (assuming that it's healthy) but for now just say what you feel comfortable. You shouldn't feel pressured to do anything, when your ready to open up is when you will reveal these things to him.|`|nTBxEcjIaa	well your dating so the guy obviously likes you. . .i would just strike up a conversation. say your watching a movie or something and it makes you think of a past experience from your life. . .tell him about it. he obviously wants to know more about you sooo tell him girl! lol. and he will share things with you too. be confident. good luck!|`|uCp7rO6yaa	hmmmm lookin good !!! a very healthy relationship indeed....  so blieve me....

b8eef8ed799e7a478635e6f44aac0d4faa	just move out....they may surprise you....but when you do, be prepared to foot the expenses.....because... do you hate the freedom of their financial support ??  Why tell them anything to hurt them.  Involve them in your "moving out process"...my guess, they'll be tickled pink...|`|IaN18Gbfaa	well thats really up to u cuz u da only one that knows how ur parents really are, but if it was me i would just say, look mom n dad i dnt wanna live here no more, i wanna live on my own n so on, well dats me so do wat u gotta do|`|YjRkpIG4aa	Why would you tell them that? They made sacrifices for you all your life whether you realize it or not. I suppose your a teenager going through the "I hate my parents" stage thinking that they're the worst parents ever. Some day when your more mature, you will love your parents, probably after you move out. Just say that you want to move out, you don't have to give them a reason. If they ask just say you want to experience life on your own.

Good luck!|`|3SSVBJAqaa	Did you try any dresses on, or you just looked? That is the biggest mistake people do.

We found gorgeous Beautiful dresses on ebay that are handmade can be designed by yourself and are really affordable. Mine bridesmaids ones cost 55 each.    I started looking for a dress on ebay for myself and there are some Beautiful ones on there and not very expensive either just look on ebay shops :D     I got my actually dress from a little home owned shop in llandudno wales, it is gorgeous and i got my dress, shawl, a cute little jacket, she is putting swarovski crystals in our initials on the back of the dress, tiara, earrings, neckless and bracelet, veil and guess how much ...1000    Dont go to big stores that are a chain go to small home owned ones that have original dresses for half the price, they treat you like an individual and not a person on a conveyor belt.    I'm talking from experience me and 6 of my bridesmaids went to a big shop and the women in the shop told 5 of them they were to fat for any of the sizes (they were all size 10 - 12 girls) they would have to lose weight to get into a dress and then proceeded to tell the 6th that she was a b*tch for being smaller than a size 6.

twuEvpiVaa	I know what you mean. I had a best friend for four years but it blew up in this massive fight, at school should I mention, and now we hardly talk. She has new friends and I have new friends and that's the end of it. It really isn't the same as it was though. I just think, oh f*ck this, college isn't that far away and I'll be outta here, but that's probably not good advice for you, haah. You should talk to her somehow, I don't know try to find her at school alone (not meant to sound creepy), or maybe online. She might feel the same as you do, you won't really know until you guys start talking to each other. But even if it doesn't work out, it happens, and you have other friends.   Hope I helped a littleee :)  ?|`|V5PxYG17aa	Ok, sometimes this happens. It's happened to me lots of times. Friends 'outgrow' each other and want to fit in with the crowd. It is sad that this happens since it does cause a lot of pain. Sometimes hard feelings too. My best advice is to tell her how you feel and move on. Get some more friends. Maybe she'll eventually see her mistake and come back. Don't let it bother you too much. I know it's hard to not let it bother you but just try. Live your life. A hard lesson I had to learn is that I can't let my live revolve around one person. I have to get out there and be myself and move on.

28WJwHf4aa	Well first, she has a boyfriend. You need to control your feelings and establish boundaries. What makes you think that if she were to leave her bf for you, that she wouldn't then cheat on you? Keep it on a friend level until she is no longer seeing someone, and then pursue a relationship with her.    As far as your parents, have they met her? I would think that if they can accept friends of other races, then they will eventually come around to accepting a gf of a different race.    Best of luck.|`|odQewFgvaa	She has a boyfriend. Nothing you can do. Just stay friends with her and maybe if the timing is right, it will work out.  As far as your parents.

Maybe after some time your parents can help you make that decision when you are ready to tell them that you really like her.  Not that your parents should make your relationship decisions for you but they know you best and can usually tell whether someone is a good match for their child (young adult).  That will also give you time to get to know each other better.  Invite her to do things with your family.  That would be a BIG help.|`|aXB3DjtZaa	Your right you cant help falling in love with someone. Race should never matter. Dont go by what ur rents say. But if she has a b/f you should respect that.

That is your personal life, but they do have their opinions. I say you go after her and flirt. Give it about 2 or 3 days the least to call her, so don't want to seem eager. And plus if you really really like her, than go after her. Who cares if she has a boyfriend, as long as she is not cheating on him then you are doing nothing wrong. If she does stuff with you while she is dating that guy, then you are getting yourself in a whole lot of trouble.|`|0pHtqdZqaa	at your age you are not capable of thinking straight -- i say try not to go crazy over this and have a balance|`|PQ7E9oO2aa	sprinkle whip cream on her|`|a8c453b32b44c7396a920c94200d4c4eaa	i think you should eat pudding|`|jMOhEUjaaa	: ] go for it all the way   what, 3 years?|`|BO28Mn8haa	if you like her, go for it. but wait till she leaves the bf first
XTy7mLAkaa	Believe it or not, when you're a little sister, you see all the mistakes that your older siblings have made and sometimes, we vow not to make those same choices because of the punishment you received from your parents.  She's definitely watching you but she's also watching the consequences you're getting as well.  I wouldn't worry too much about it but I would try to make better choices in the future and coach her about things that she shouldn't do.  As an older sibling, it's our responsibility to be 'our brother's keeper' so you should talk to her and protect her from harm.      Take it easy though.  We all make mistakes but choosing wisely before doing things helps avoid costly mistakes.    You'll be just fine.|`|Hizsm6m4aa	I think as long as you have a close relationship and she feels comfortable talking to you things should be ok. Keeping the lines of communication open (without judgment) will allow her to seek advice from you. It may be too late to change the impression she has, but be honest with her no matter what and let her know that you love her and want better for her. Also realize that some mistakes are learned through experience and as she grows older she will take her own path. Just be watchful of the types of people she hangs with.|`|AA11101806	tell her that you've done things that are bad (or wrong), and that you don't want to see her follow in the same pattern because you care about her.|`|rc07XP7laa	i feel the same with my sister. YOU HAVE to change. u cant expect her to see what you've done is wrong if your still doing it. If you cant change lie about it. Use your experience of how awful it is and mention it in conversation. say nothing appealing about it. even if you have to lie through your teeth.

cGbTJobeaa	It should not be a problem. Just double check with your priest and ask.  BTW,  I found the pre-Cana class that we had to take to be very helpful in guiding discussions between my fiance and me about our future and our views on marriage.     Towards the end of the class, we each had to write a love letter to each other.  To this day, if either of us are annoyed at the other one, we will pull out the letter and reread it.  It helps us to stay grounded and focused on our relationship.    Are you having regular meetings with your priest?  We had to meet with our priest about 3 or 4 times before our wedding.  I thought those meetings were very useful too.|`|a3422bad6666b60894e80bace0f14387aa	You should be fine but check with your priest.    Good luck!|`|01b990b6feebbb819d33fb976c859438aa	it will be fine.|`|Wzws8v8daa	No, that's fine. We did ours 3 months before the wedding.  It doesn't matter when you do it - it could be a couple days before the wedding, it doesn't matter.|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	This depends upon your priest's and parish's guidelines. For our parish, one year notice has to be given for a marriage.  Some dioceses have weekend Engaged Encounters, as well.|`|FVFxE6owaa	You will need to speak to your parish priest about this and see what he says.  They usually require that you complete it three months prior to the wedding date, but maybe if you explain to him that you were having financial difficulties at that time but are now able to afford it, he might understand.

Don't try and be overbearing with him it will only make things worse.    A child is a gift that many people will never receive your a lucky girl and he is a lucky man and i'm sure he knows it just give him time and space. You know men don't have much room in their heads to deal with many things at once.    Congratulations    (and dont listen to some of them blokes in here.

XTy7mLAkaa	That would make the most logical sense, yes, but since our judicial system is off kilter, they may just deem the one child unfit and not the others.  Each child is treated as a 'case' so if the other children aren't in this 'case' then they may be able to stay with the unfit parent.      I would like to think that the courts would take into consideration all the children in a family like this but unfortunately, it doesn't happen that way.|`|yZxgC1e5aa	It matters the reason why they were unfit for that child but Yes.  If that parent can't take good enough care for that child, why would they be good enough for the other(s)?|`|gjdd7bVWaa	I think so, but our courts don't always make a lot of sense.|`|npA75Obvaa	One would assume so.
n4AgDwCGaa	It sounds like she might be jealous and is trying to be defensive. (By the way, people of all ages will gossip about others that they are jealous of sometimes. Some people just never grow up.) It is likely that she is jealous, it is also likely that there is more to the story, like it sounds to be. Other than openly asking her, you probably won't know. As far as critiquing every word you say, you can either just say that you have to go for now when she speaks to you and she may pick up the pattern that you do not want to talk when she acts like that. Maybe she will change. You could also just not show that you are annoyed by just saying, oh yeah, I mess up sometimes, off day, no one is perfect. Something along those lines.   I hope this helps and good luck.

You just have a physical problem that needs treatment.  It's not as if you caused the condition.  Maybe it would be less embarrassing to talk to your dad than your mom about it?  At any rate, at least tell them there's something you want to talk to the doctor about.  But I don't think your parents are going to react in an embarrassing way.  It gets easier to talk about stuff like that as you get you're older.

b4c080d0f4c39aa94fde4b1f35a009fbaa	The decree of divorce was issued in the month of May,2007 & since the time of appeal against any order/decree of divorce is ninety days has expired hence legally this case is closed for ever & the parties are no more married now hence no legal claim/right of any sort exist between them. The wife has not sought any permanent alimony and maintenance for almost two years hence her claim now for the same may not be successful even if she tries for it because the most important question which she will have to reply will be her source of maintenance for these two years of more & why she seek it now after such a long period. Other then this the issue of custody of child/children was not there between both of them, so question of it being raised now.

kjOsSmM0aa	I know exactly how you feel. It is sad, but my husband is exactly that way to me. Is there something that she's told you that you do to bug her? I mean I'm not really sure what to do or I would have fixed that part of my relationship.  Here's an idea:  Line up a babysitter and take her to a restaurant that meant a lot to her when you were still courting.  Then just let the evening pan out. If the mood doesn't seem right, then don't ask her about it at the restaurant. Watch her at the restaurant, though, and see if she is distant with you. Then maybe just ask, "What's the matter?"  I don't know if this will work, but it may be worth a shot.  I really hope it helps! God Bless!|`|1id6XTOBaa	i smell an affair|`|AA12014364	There is obviously a lack of communication between you and your wife. Communication has to be the foundation of your marriage. Sit her down and remind her that she is married to you and not her work and that she has a responsibility to you first and foremost. Do not be aggressive.|`|UKqDzATkaa	There is communication problem. First you have to sit and ask her what bothering her? Is she feeling lack of affection from you or she is more serious about her professional life. Taking care of child is not only your job, she also has to care. Dad cannot give comfort to child compared to mom.She has to balance her professional life and family life. If she is not ready to communicate you better consult marriage counsellor and discuss the problems. I hope you will solve all your problems and live together till death. All the best :)|`|49A8M4ZSaa	Talk to her and tell her how you feel and think.  Maybe she is just too tired. Usually, it is the wife who feels ignored but in your case, it is the other way.

Maybe you will get her attention then.|`|nfl9xrLFaa	Hav u done anything to make her act that way..analyse urself.

KBU2X921aa	Hey dude. i am exactly like you. I did everything possible to make my gf happy yet she fell out of love with me. except it lasted two years. It is probably the hardest thing we could go through, but what i realized is that there are so many women out there that wish they had a guy that treated them right. When you have a chance to put yourself out there let them know how great of a guy you really are. And you never know, maybe you being with another girl might make your ex realize how great of a guy you really are and maybe you might get another chance with her. I know i didn't answer your question but i hoped this gave you a boost. I had to do this all on my own and i wish i had someone there for me. That's why i try to help people on here. Thanks for the question.|`|034289d2e5f2ba9ddcddc9d244cfea7eaa	There are many reasons that make people to break up or fall out of love relationships such as money matters, going to parties, drinking, smoking, fighting, rude, abusive language etc.    You need to search for other reasons because no two relationships are the same.    Some reasons from the website are as follows:  1.) Not caring about or expressing care for the feelings of your partner. When you are troubled by something or if something fantastic has happened, youd naturally want to share this with your partner. Imagine him or her not listening or bothering to respond. How would this make you feel?    Remember, youre part of a couple now, the concerns of the other are your concerns as well. The key here is listening and thoughtfully responding.    2.) Being a control freak. Relationships arent perfect democracies. Its only natural that there will be a dominant person in the couple. This is largely determined by the personality types involved. When the dominant member over does it, the relationship stands on rocky ground. No one wants to be treated as a slave or a robot.    There are many reasons for controlling behavior, most of which are pathological. If you find yourself doing this, stop it right now. Understand that your partner is a person with needs that you should be concerned about.    3.) Cheating on your partner. This is a very serious offense that in many circumstances is unforgivable. In addition to the emotional trauma that youll be causing, youre also exposing your partner to disease.    If you find that you cant control this very base instinct, you dont belong in any relationship. You should resign yourself to remaining a solitary individual for the rest of your life.    4.) Lack of fun and spontaneity. This is often the fate of many relationships. After youve spent a lot of time with another person, they become so familiar that boredom slowly creeps in. Everything requires maintenance over time and your relationship is no exception. If you want your love to remain strong youll have to put some energy and imagination into keeping it enjoyable.    5.) Allowing arguments and fights to escalate out of control. A little self restraint now and then is never a bad thing. Diplomacy can be useful as well. A small unresolvable issue can really blow up over time.    Its best to understand why the same argument keeps surfacing and to do something about it. Arguments in general are normal but be careful not to allow them to become a habit. They can get worse in severity if both partners get reactive or touchy. If the fight is over a small matter then just give in. Theres no shame in agreeing to take the trash out|`|Bsf78pfsaa	people dont fall out of love they cease to love. being busy is no excuse and I would learn that love takes work and unless you want to work at it its going to fail|`|UgcPxd4maa	she obviously doesn't deserve you anyway|`|PQ7E9oO2aa	people fall in love so that they can have a soulmate|`|F1CwVqScaa	I don't know...

They would do the same if they were still white. Most shoes will react to being wet. But sweat is not going to effect them, and if it does then there is a bigger issue. I'm not sure if they sell or recommend anything, but 3m has a waterproof spray. But don't do it unless you have consulted with the company. They will know what will work for their shoes.|`|TfPDMDZMaa	It's the outside of the shoe that is dyed so don't worry about if you sweat. I will give you this warning though - don't wear them in grass - even if it's not wet - they dye will turn darker and blotchy. They just have to put the warning on there so people don't get mad if the color doesn't last forever.    Hope this helps!

Ccs9LeIEaa	it sounds here like the reason you are getting married is that you have sexual chemistry. and that is not the most important part of a relationship.     buttt if you insist, you could do everything but, or just go for it.     God is not going to smite you for having sex. Honestly. I was a firm believer in waiting til marriage, but with my current, I just couldnt resist. I felt guilty for a little while, but now, its all good!     good luck :)|`|RgNs6Tsdaa	Clearly just go with what your senses are telling you. Im not a Christian personally, but if you believe that God has created you then there is a reason why he has made you have the feelings you are feeling now, and to deny them is surely more of an insult to him then to go with what he has given you.|`|Q5FYrU9vaa	Try to control yourself. Dont think about it soo much i know its hard. But your virginity is something precious and its something your suppose to lose after ur married. Just try not to be alone with him because that just makes you more tempted. You know just do what you can. My brother is a christian as well and he waited until he was married. He was 21 so i think you can wait a little longer.|`|Ar6wD9Oeaa	well, coming from someone who lost their virginity at age 14 and not to the man i married, I would say just wait it out.    I cannot tell you the dissappointment i have in myself for not waiting and i think the  fact that i wasn't a virgin before i met my husband has kind of put a damper on our relationship.    So, Has he porposed yet? If he has and you do have a nice sized rock on your hand and have already started to plan the wedding, then POSSIBLY go ahead and do it. If you know for sure he's going to be staying with you.    Have you ever thought about moving the wedding up? It's not that serious of a commitment if you are already in the commitment with him. It's a piece of paper that says  that you two are legal combined as one now. In the eyes of god, your sexual relations will then not be a sin. Also, weddings dont need to be that huge princess fairy tale thhing. In the end, you spend a whole day  getting ready for something that is only going to last about 5 - 6 hours and spend tons of money in the process.    Sounds like if you two really love each other that an earlier wedding may just be right for you and then you dont have to worry about Hurting god.    I have two children, and the thing i want to encourage the most with them is to wait to be sexually intimate with someone until they have found the right one, settled down and got married. I can not stress how important that is. I would not sacrifice what you have beleived in for all of these years just to be "closer" to him now. Imagine how great it will feel; on your wedding night ot be that close to him.    I say dont do it, and move the wedding up if you are that serious with him. You'll feel better about it in the long run!|`|Xf93fRTTaa	It is not going to hurt God if you have sex.    I was baptized Christian, but do not follow it closely. I feel that if you live your life well, and aren't hurting anyone, then you will still go to heaven or whatever.|`|IzQJEqv5aa	Well if you know that you guys are going to get married then why not?|`|aVPhSOHFaa	well wanting to is just as bad as doing it...you should wait till you get married to have sex...but if you do go a head and have sex all sins a forgivable..well taking your own life isn't but anyways...if you do go ahead and have sex ask forgiveness...im not really good at this stuff..but bottom line is wait...and if you don's like i said ask forgiveness...i hope i helped you..i am a christian my self too...|`|tao83sDxaa	you know the answer to that, you just need someone to tell you that you are right to wait. as much as you have feelings, don't do it, wait until your married. not just because you are a christian, but because too many things could happen if you don't. what would you do if you broke up, but you found yourself preg. it would change the rest of your life. i know the rules are olf fashoned but they are for reasons.

You stop hanging around with her if she DOES get caught some day.|`|veZLfnGFaa	You are never to young to be arrested.  You may not go to jail, but you do go to Juvenile Detention.

T5ztIAZbaa	I'm absolutely positive that they do.  But if they make a commitment before they do that, then they know that they don't need that to be happy together.|`|grAU3MJcaa	A lot of times when a couple has been sexually active with one another, they are more capable of understanding what the other is feeling without them actually having to say it. For example, if one of them is having a bad day, the other doesn't need to ask to know.
8vfCRg7Caa	the problem with sex is that everybody thinks they are the greatest thing to happen to there lover. And they want to be the best they can be and get upset if you give them any criticism about anything on their performance. And when you get done they act like 2 year olds with stupid questions "was it good" and stuff like that.     If you find something that bothers you during sex whether, its too quick or too long, speak up. It usually takes alot of concentration for a man to orgasm and women will never know how much work it takes. Its not like, "orgasm", "ok". And keep the side jokes to your friends about anything. You want more action, just say it before you have sex next time. "i want to get my orgasm first". Dont forget men or simple. Not complicated. So just say it like that and you will see results.    I was reading somebody post and hes right. If the female is realy smoking hot and hes been waiting to get a chance. (like its been a dream of his) then that will happen. Ive only been done that quick twice. And both girls i thought were blazing hot. And strangly both girls were dancin with me all night long so i knew what was going to happen by the end of the night. So i had alot of energy built up.     Dont talk about sex before sex, dont work them up. Dont make them wait all week or tease them.

Also how often you have sex, the more often the longer he will start lasting. Also if he hasn't had sex in a while.|`|4HoVVCenaa	Not uncommon, especially if the female is way sexy and the guy is young and inexperienced. It should improve over time. Suggest that he masturbate before coming over. Have him lay "still" and let you control things.|`|a2b21f2cee1471018ba8eafddb953922aa	have him m-bate before hand. lol|`|72UNDrwkaa	my boyfriend c**s quite early every time, but he keeps going and usually c**s about 5-6 times during sex so i'm quite lucky really|`|WFRooU7Maa	Deal with it  All guys shoot their wad early|`|15e58edf21f33dd475298413b3cd6d8caa	have him give  u oral 1st... let him have his fun bang away..

Sometimes it sucks to put a number on things like marriage...but usually theres a reason why people wait until there 20 and even later to get married. It allows for time to grow, develop into independent beings, get educated and learn a few things about life until we settle down with someone for good.    Although all your intentions are there, and I do not deny the love you have for your boyfriend, I think you should listen to your family, talk to your boyfriend and think about having a long engagement, there is nothing wrong with that, me and my partner have been engaged for 2 years and finally getting married in august, in this time your parents will begin to accept your relationship and in a few years will be a lot more supportive and open to the idea of marriage.    I wont preach to you why at 18 we think so much differently then we do at 20 and up, you ll eventually discover that for yourself, but remember, if its meant to be, it will be (love will always find a way).|`|jrVlzffeaa	Don't get married yet, you've only been together for a year, if he is for keeps you can still get married when your in your 20's Xx|`|f547b0547924b21590b8ffb102004fdeaa	18 is too young to make such a commitment, on top of the fact that you have only been together a year. Give your relationship some time to grow. Maybe you should consider the things your parents "haven't liked about him" in the past. Maybe those issues could cause problems in the future but right now you are too blinded by being in the honeymoon phase of in love. Just grow up a little bit first before getting married.|`|AA10351134	There is often something a big sad about moving out of your kiddie room in your parents' house straight into a marriage without ever experiencing life on your own. If you skip this step, you run the risk of marrying before your eyes are really open about what who you are and what you want in your own life, much less a partner. You also could find yourself 30 years later starting over, but having to acquire all the basic skills of living alone from scratch.|`|PMpvtKUwaa	you are too young. crazy kids.|`|AA10645224	WAIT A COUPLE OF YEARS UNTIL YOUR SURE    SAME WITH KIDS|`|GTvyBTGyaa	Way too young to get married! If you are meant to be together you will be together in 1,2,5,10 years.  no need to rush. Your parents are right. Wait till your 21st and see how its all going.|`|JhcOeplZaa	My boyfriend and I are about to get married. We have only been together a year. I am 18 and he is 22. First of all if you still live at home you need to move out and get a home with him to make sure ya'll can stand each other on a 24/7 basis(very important). No one can tell how or what to do with your life so if you feel like you are doing the right thing do it. And if it fails get a divorce.  Good Luck in your choices.|`|8yGKvP5xaa	Do you really need to get married, to know you love each other?    Marriage is a technicality.  It also leads to divorce.  --IF--, you REALLY are in love, time isn't going to kill it.|`|44Sj3bsZaa	If you truly believe in your relationship with him then you should have no problem waiting to get married. If your bond is as strong as you think then waiting will only make it stronger. Marriage should never be a rushed thing and with out the support of your parents then it can be extra hard. The love your parents have is unconditional and irreplaceable. It sounds like this guy may have hurt you in the past. I think you should wait and let him prove to you and your parents that he is worthy of your love. I don't suggest going against your parents wishes, because weather you want to believe it or not, they really do have your best interest at heart. Right now, you should focus on college and getting a wonderful career. Love and creating your own family will come when the time is right and rushing things never makes them better. Good luck sweetie...|`|e90a8e2ee095e648a3f92f15f7959eb6aa	You are too young.  Finish college first, then get married.|`|9N3JuK8yaa	I personally think you should wait a few years. Think of how many divorces there are today, broken families everywhere. You may not love him as much after a while of marriage. Getting married at such a young age doesn't usually turn out well. But you shouldn't not marry him because of your family, you need to do what you think is right, and if your family loves you they will support whatever decision you make, whether they like it or not.|`|P6CFBfCTaa	you marry him|`|3SSVBJAqaa	Wait to get married. Go to school, get jobs, move in, but wait to get married, wait to have kids.     I have a friend who got married at 18, and so does my sister. Both of our friends are now divorced, her friend divorced with 3 children, and her ex-husband got remarried and has another 2 children. He doesn't see his first three kids. I would have never thought Dave would be that way, considering I knew him since he was dating my sister's friends since they were 15 and I was 11.    Bottom line, people change as they get older. Wait, get good jobs, and then, if the two of you are still madly in love, get married, just wait to do it until you are at least 22-23.|`|0F8hauikaa	I think 18 is too young with very few exceptions. I was 19 and realized later that I never got to experience adulthood as a single and regretted it. The first few years were great but it kept getting harder as we matured on different levels and it ended in divorce after many years and two children, and starting over isn't easy. It's wonderful to be in love but unfortunately love alone is not enough to make a marriage work.|`|4HoVVCenaa	You are 18, do what you want. But think about your and his abilities to make it work over time. Most, but not all,  that get married at that age have regrets... they feel they have missed out on a significant part of life, and wish they had waited.|`|w1necKzYaa	wait until you have gone throught the 2 year thing you are too young to get married! forever is a long time!|`|rlUUaSgqaa	As somebody who's done a lot of research about how to predict whether a relationship will last before the marriage, I have to warn you that the odds are very much against you.  You may have already heard about the statistics that getting married under the age of 20 doubles or triples your chance of divorce, and that getting married to somebody you've known less than two years also doubles your chances of divorce.      What you probably wouldn't expect is that for couples who've dated less than two years, the MORE in love they are at the time of the marriage, the HIGHER their risk of divorce.  I know that doesn't make any sense, but the single best predictor of how likely a marriage is too last is how much it changes for the worse during the first two years of the relationship.  The couples who rush into marriage because they're really excited about their relationship during the first year or two are usually the ones that see the biggest changes in the relationship and end up the most disappointed with the relationship after the marriage.    I would recommend waiting until you're at least 20.  If you still want to marry him at that point, then there's a much better chance things will work out, but why take the risk at this point?|`|4lL34wJnaa	I was "engaged" to my high school sweetheart.  We had been together for almost 3 years when we broke up just before my 18th birthday.    I started dating the man of my dreams at 19.  We are getting married 7-11-09 and we'll both be 29.  I realize in hindsight that waiting until I am older was much better than getting married young.  I know my relationship will last because he and I have lived through many ups and downs together.  We have never broken up once in our almost 10 years together.  We have rarely had a fight that wasn't resolved before bedtime.  We also have lived together for going on 5 years, which means we know our financial habits, living, and cleanliness habits mesh together.  Waiting turned into a blessing in disguise for me.  I have changed a lot since I was a teenager, as most people do.  I am more in love with him than ever.  Waiting was the best thing I ever did.    NO ONE can stop you from getting married once you are both 18.  HOWEVER, you need to figure out how you will afford a wedding, btw- the average cost of a wedding is around $28,000.  You also need to figure out how you will live because it sounds like living with your parents is NOT an option.  How are you going to support yourselves?  Are you going to go to college?  Marriage is a lot of work.  Are you prepared for it?|`|fQgbBx7caa	When you turn 18 you are pretty much on your own, better check with the laws in your state though.  Do not expect your parents to pay for the wedding, get a job, move out, do not have kids for a few years.  You are young and the odds are against you, don't make a baby pay for it. Whatever it is your fiance did in the past you had better take a good look at it and see if it is worth marrying him, he will be part of you.  I would listen to my parents, I know you think they are stupid and don't know what they are talking about.....you will learn I hope.|`|851c6ba054fa621b9fc32855c092c444aa	Getting married is a huge deal. And it's not always happily ever after. You have to deal with finances, pay bills and other things that comes along. It's a huge responsibility and maybe your parents are thinking,"What's the rush?" Why not enjoy your youth instead of carrying all these responsibilities? I'm not saying learning to be responsible is a bad thing, but to enjoy life is what we live for. And why do you want to get married? It's just a piece of paper. You guys are still gonna be together, married or not. Here's a suggestion, why not try live together and see if this is what you both want. Good luck.|`|6d718b2ca0424bba8e88fd0bd7a40273aa	This is clearly only a question you can answer. Personally, I believe you should wait a little bit longer until you have fully developed and your life is somewhat in order. You need to ask yourselves some hard questions about what expectations you have and what changes may come up, how you plan to handle those changes. It might be wise if you stay engaged for another year or so, that way you will have some money saved up, sharing living expenses, and you would have a better idea of what the every day strains of your relationship will entail. Now family is important, but as an adult you have to make your own choices. Just talk long and hard to your fiance about what to expect and perhaps wait a year. You are so young that a longer engagement would be beneficial instead of detrimental. Enjoy being engaged it's a fun time.
q9yGiIPUaa	call him if it's that important. just start the conversation off like this...  you: hey (insert his name), this is (insert your name). i think there was some confusion the other day. you see i only wrote my number, if there was anything else that was on that paper it was written by the messenger. not me. i'm sorry for the confusion.    him: he will say something that corresponds with this.    as you get into the conversation casually throw this in there...  you: so i am a little confused, i thought we may have had something between us and i was wondering what happened to it.|`|UfOP3xtcaa	Hold your head high. don't be embarrassed because you gave out a number. Don't call him if you think he is a jerk.
tPxvm6yaaa	As a guy, this is my own point of view.    If he always ask you if you're hungry and ask if you want something to eat whenever you're together strolling the mall, park, or wherever, even if you just had snack 30 minutes ago.  He always pays the bill.  He always caress you.   He always kiss you on the cheeks.  He always kiss and smell your hair.  He always hugs you.  He is sweet to you.  He always phone or send text messages to you.   He don't easily get angry or mad even if it's your fault.  He always have time for you.  He say he loves you and want to marry you.  He respects you.  If he discussed marriage to you and asked you how many kids you will have.    There are a lot more a guy can show his true feelings and intentions if he truly loves you and be his partner for life.    Remember: Words without deeds, is like a garden full of weeds.|`|GTvyBTGyaa	When he respects you. Puts you as his number 1,|`|LGHMmRVFaa	if he tells you that he loves you i would not look in to that but if he SHOWS YOU then i think he loves you|`|KZlgdMeEaa	actions not words... does he do the little things that matter?
5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	You place it at the back of the crown of your head. My veil came with a small tiara attached. You could also do as you said.  I wore mine similar to this placement -  http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v11/su...  http://www.anythingbridal.com/_images/ve...    The hairdresser took a small chunk of hair from the crown of my head in her hand, twisted it around and around until it coiled on itself, and she pinned that down (yes it hurt!) and sprayed the heck out of it. Then the comb from the veil/tiara slipped in under it. (you don't see the hair-knot thing, it's covered)   Now, that thing did not move all day and all night - absolutely amazing!|`|a3422bad6666b60894e80bace0f14387aa	Actually your idea sounds ideal. I would have your stylist try it and see how you like it. Or, ask your stylist to make other suggestions based on how well she feels she can secure the comb.     Good luck!

1l04qpOKaa	I used to have the same sort of problem in high/middle school and it always terrified me. I would walk by and accidently trip over her backpack and she would go off on me saying I was trying to ruin her things and threaten to beat me up. The way I got through it was to just be mild towards them. Don't go out o f your way to be nice or mean, just ignore the rude comments. What they are doing is trying to get a rise out of you, they want you to be scared or get angry. I know ignoring them sounds like a wimps way out but theres really nothing else you can do. They are just like any other type of bully, stick up for yourself in a mature way. Someday they will grow out of it! Now I'm 27 and one of my best friends is black.  Good luck  :o)|`|3y0w1qIBaa	Wow, these Africian American are racist to you.

They are jealous of you because the black boys are in to you.|`|2nWtytwQaa	They must be jealous of you. You know that's how girls are sometimes. Next time she/they act like that towards you just ask "what did I do to make you not like me??"(even though you know the answer) Say it when people are around to. That should make them be quiet. If guys are nice to you, they must notice it because they want the attention. But definetly DO NOT STOUP DOWN TO THERE LEVEL|`|PNA7f0q3aa	be like the stfu u fking black wh0re. LOL!  just kidding. just go up to her face and cuss them off.|`|PpAb8fezaa	shes racist .  just stick up for your self.|`|5j0qSHXjaa	Sweet Heart they probably mad because they are maybe thinking its the average "white girl" who are taking there men... idk this happens alot but .... other than that you need to step up maybe your an easy target to get teased or theyre just hatin|`|IVHyKRCCaa	hi dear  maybe, they are insecure because in the first place you are white and 2nd you said that black boys are nice to you, maybe they see how they are nice to you so if these boys are nice to you it means they like you and nobody will like them because you steal their attention hahaha...|`|QB6cCK1caa	Well, i say either ignore them or if you are brave enough just ask the girl " What is your problem with me? What did i do?! Is it just cuz im white?" that might help but if she is the type of girl who might so call " box you" for saying that then just ignore her or when she talks to you give her a look that makes her seem like she's crazy :) hope i helped

Obviously there isn't an instant strong connection or she'd be trying to take you off the market quick. So back up a little (romantically) and let things unfold and don't make her feel obligated.|`|8d2dafa2e677fbcd1bf84bcf3389e331aa	Sounds like she wants you to open up...spend some more time with her...show her what you're into...if you're into video games go to an arcade together. like movies? take her out to one or stay in and watch your favorite. be affectionate and show her that you care.

Make sure you make a young woman feel comfortable around you, not like you are up on a totally different level. Joke and laugh and be personable. And maybe sit down. =)|`|uXeGsxSVaa	I am 5'10... 6'3" on heels. I dare you to intimidate me!    But yes, no way to tell why they go so quiet.

Anyway, ask your friends and acquaintances who are girls on what they think about you and whether your height affects their perceptions at all.|`|q3cbuc3Eaa	no, tall guys are cool!  they can reach the top book on the bookshelf!  it's even cute when they are a "gentle giant"|`|IGY2ofRBaa	with me being 5 ft 1 im sure u could easily trample on me without noticing? but height has never put me off !|`|FuFAwiJBaa	Im only small so I couldnt date you but I know someone who is my height and is married to someone really tall so cant see it being a problem|`|2X7NjsAcaa	nah ur not tooo tall , for me i like tall guys ! it depends on what gurls like .|`|KO4Ea9Xkaa	For me, being a tall woman, that really wouldn't be an issue. I can see how it may be intimidating to others though. Are you not perhaps being a little sensitive about women being quiet around you?

8IpV1Br8aa	He still loves you and he wants to fell that you feel the same way. The fact that he lied to you twice about this new girl. He want  you to show him more love. This is not the time to give up if you really love him, this is the time to show him that you really love him.|`|HLIv7TLHaa	Sounds like someone who is insecure, confused and jealous.    The confusion is apparent in the "hot" and "cold" way in which he approaches you.    The confusion could still be about how he found himself on the "outside" looking in.  That often times happens to guys who take their partners for granted and simply assume "all is right" with you without really listening to what you say or paying attention to your overall demeanor.        Confusion can of course lead to insecurity of left unchecked.   Insecurity is popping up with the lies and uninnvited interest in your dating habits.    Of course, jealousy is fueled by insecurity.       In short, he appears to be unwilling to accept at face value what your reasons were for terminating the relationship .  ie  he wasn't really listening or paying attention to you then (or throughout the relationship) and he hasn't changed that modis oprendi|`|61fcf832e5d4b87f1c941578ef4bacd3aa	I said it before Blue Eyes. Don't get bogged down in the drama. Move on and be happy.|`|7e8be8f471de4c60d8884f52a597ddc2aa	Games, how old are you two?  I think he needs to grow up and move on|`|kEtYEmhqaa	Revenge|`|veZLfnGFaa	As you have said - he is your "ex".  Forget him.  Move on - don't worry about what he says to you.  He knows you are running around behind him checking to see if he is dating someone or if they have met his family.  Don't do this.  Get a life - and don't include him in it.|`|9Jnf5jRQaa	he's your ex for a reason - move on!|`|Bc4udMhUaa	It sounds like you have or had a very passive aggressive man. He seems like he is playing on the jealousy factor to make you beg. My thoughts are he is either  1.) unhappy with himself  2.) had something traumatic in his past    You can't change someone like that. They need to realize their own destructive behavior and change on their own accord.    I would take this knowledge to heart, he doesn't respect you. He probably does not truly respect anyone and he'll probably do this with the new girl.    Stear clear of him. Let him be someone else's problem.|`|B1sT1t44aa	He is playing with your emotions and that is wrong. You can only change what you are feeling here by thinking about him differently. He does not know what he wants and if he is trying to make himself feel good at your expense he isn't worth it. You had your own reason for breaking up with him because you were not content in the way the relationship was. If you want him back into your life and if he wants you the best solution here is to get straight to the point with one another and be honest. Jealousy will only make things worse and put a bigger wedge between the relationship if the two of you are not finished yet?|`|H3WHxCgaaa	Stop all contact with him and it won't matter to you either way.|`|IhYWT0i0aa	Because you still have a place in his heart and he wants you back, but does not want to outright tell you even though you already asked.
lfKWA2Agaa	Don't worry if he loves you, he will be there for you. And by the sound of it, he does love you. They are just going through some hard times, I know how it feels to lose someone you love, and sometimes without knowing it you take it out on other people you care about. So I think you will probably move with them. They have already let you lived with them for a while, and you've dating him for 2 years, so I think personally that you won't get kicked out. :) good luck!!!|`|Q0SIuZWjaa	no offence, but stop thinking about yourself, his dads just died. If he truly cares about you then he wont just leave you on the streets. It sounds like he just pressumes your going to move with them anyway, because he said he wanted you to get a place of your own.|`|aRkIJVvCaa	wow, i think that you need to sit down and for real talk to your boyfriend, you've been together for 2 years and he knows you have no where to go why would he just kick you out. I don't think he would.  As for the baby momma you need to just stop worrying about it, he has to keep it cool with her because that is his kid. No matter what she will always be a part of his life because they do have a baby together.|`|sLUiQ6Txaa	he seems to care about you so i dont think he would abandon you. it seems to me though that you need to sort you're life out and sort you're own housing etc so you are independant. you cant realy on this guys mum to house you!|`|eloWO2piaa	Oh god.. you are the reason I left Singles and Dating and had my TC badge here removed.    I cannot stand illiterate children.  Please, use proper grammar and spelling if you'd like serious, thoughtful answers.|`|7VDzH4fBaa	Tell him more of your concerns.|`|jl2xZGK6aa	time will tell
ysexlf9baa	da second 1|`|aVPhSOHFaa	don't really matter to me as long as i get loving...lol|`|029d970e89f49628d1a27a4f7084f48faa	By "no effort" do you mean he's not really into it? I'd much rather have my man totally focused on me.|`|brd9Z8VRaa	McLovin loves the lovin.
f1eafc98e5bf801dd57f622beb176ed2aa	Nope, not anymore... I am who I am :) and to be honest I can't wait to go my seperate ways!|`|j6RbKNmjaa	Nope not one bit|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	Yes, to some degree I am, especially when I ask them for there opinions.|`|5F1UErrhaa	I used to be, but now I think: if they don't like me the way I am they're not real friends, because real friends like you no matter what your tastes and appearance are.|`|2Cw0DfaSaa	no. not really.   everyone has there own personal taste and if i like it thats all that matters. im the one thats going to be wearing it or listening to it or dealing with it not them.   besides it shouldnt matter to your friends because they should like you for you anyways|`|nAK82h6vaa	No not really,Thats what makes them who they are|`|M7Sf8eFwaa	Nope, i used to be but now i've grown up and matured i've realised that i don't have to care about what others think.|`|FzFSzilmaa	i have no friends, so i really don't care... :D|`|9HUjDaBVaa	No as that is what makes us individuals|`|2c7869fbf2bfda8e590501ddb5545f2caa	Well I'm not bothered about what they like and dislike with regard to music, clothes ,etc.|`|28MbFXyJaa	Yes, but only to some degree.|`|qdmi87Cgaa	no never! they are my friends :)
mkxSLZqIaa	I can honestly say that whenever my mom told me not to date a guy for whatever reason, I actually liked the boy more, but I was a rebellious teen!! I think your mom absolutely can tell you if she is concerned about him. She is just protective but I don't think moms always word it very well! If he is a good guy though, I would give it time, and let your mom get to know him. Let her see the good person that you see. I have had boyfriends that my mom took one look at and was not pleased but ended up caring for when she had the time to get to know them.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	get used to it.  it doesn't matter if she has the right or not.  she's your mother and she's going to do it anyway.    as long as you know who he really is and you aren't dating him just to spite her, just ignore her when she makes comments about how someone looks.  Pay attention when she mentions how they behave--then she has a valid arguement.|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	Yes, if its justified. But in this case I think she's stereotyping him and unless he has you fooled  she's dead wrong.|`|AA11501437	it isn't a matter of right or wrong - she is telling you her opinion.  I will never forget comming out of my room the first time i put on lipstick and perfume for a school dance and my mom letting me know that I looked and smelled like a french hooker.  didnt feel great at the time, but thats what she thought, and ya - she has a right to her opinion....and now that I think about it, she was probably right.  good luck.|`|QieRAMLkaa	no  its not right for your mother to say that  i know many kids from when I was in high school that people would have considered "freaks" who were actually the least likely kids to do drugs or break the law    judging someone unreasonably based on looks is wrong.  but maybe you can change her mind a bit by making yourselves look responsible.  Have him wear some nice clothing and invite him over for dinner,  (he must have family affair clothing someplace)   and have him explain calmly to you mother that he knows his appearance seems unconventional but that he is just expressing his adolecent views of society and music, that it doesn't negatively impact his judgment or his morals......seeing a teenager approach a parent in such a way not only makes the two of you look respectful and responsible but it also opens up a flow of communication that both your boyfriend and parents can be comfortable with      explain to him  this isn't changing what you think of him, and you don't want him to change who he is, but there is a time and place to act your age and there is a time and place to straighten up a bit.      I drink, smoke, swear, dress like a 17 year old from 1985, and listen to punk and rap music....but I know how to tone it down when Im going to my husbands  parents house for dinner.  remember  mutual respect will open many oportunities for you and your boyfriend|`|Y95mhtUnaa	Most moms will tell us that someone isn't safe for us based on their looks. Yes she has a right to tell you this but she can't control what you choose to do! Either way, it's your choice not hers. But if you're tired of her disapproving your boyfriends, why do you pick guys she doesn't approve of? But she's probably scared of him based on his stereotypical look, chains and black, she probably thinks he's a evil and whatever...which doesn't really make sense but whatever. Tell her she needs to get to know him first before judging him and tell your bf he should dress down just for one day and see if she'll get a little comfortable around him.|`|xFEuN9Vhaa	yes she does.  And if your boyfriend was concerned about you and your relationship, then he would stop stereotyping himself.|`|3GHXk05saa	Yes, it is. She may be reacting to the black and chains bit, but she may also be seeing personality traits she doesn't like, even if it's just an unsettled feeling she can't put her finger on.  Moms have great instincts and you should at least hear her side.  Prejudice is another thing entirely, but ask her to give specifics. Have him come to dinner and spend time with her so she can see past the way he dresses. Toning it down around her wouldn't hurt, either, and it's a sign of respect. If he's so sweet he shouldn't mind.  After a bad experience I made sure my parents met all my dates. We had a code, as he and I were leaving I would ask what time I needed to be home. The time they gave was an indication of how much they trusted the young man. One guy who was a friend and an awesome person was told him to have me home at dawn. Of course we never stayed out that late, but they trusted him, and with good reason. One guy they said 9:30. They were right, he was a real creep and I developed a stomach ache and was home by 9. They saw things I couldn't because I didn't have enough life experience, so give her opinion some weight.|`|AA11674544	Of course she has the right to tell you this. In fact, it is her obligation to tell you this! She isn't saying that he IS a criminal, she says he LOOKS like a criminal, which, by your definition, I think he looks like a attention-wanting teenager. Seems like your mother is just trying to guide you so you are aware that he will be judged by society harshly for his choices in style. She doesn't want you to be harshly judged as well. For example, If he goes to a job interview with long hair..... you get the point. She is just concerned that he will bring disapproving eyes toward you and that you will suffer for it. She loves you! Of course, he is most likely just expressing himself and learning about how styles affect the way people treat you. Thankfully, he has the sense not to get piercings all over his body or tattoos on his face. I am sure he is a nice guy.  Tell your mom that you understand that he will be judged by society (and so will you) by the way he chooses to look, but that either it doesn't bother you, or you like the excitement of that. Good luck!|`|WOHc22Xiaa	She can tell you whatever the hell she wants doesn't mean you have to listen. Don't worry about it if you like him tell her to get used to it. Just in a nicer way.
5boLbxzdaa	I'm not a hubby but I think I speak for all men when I say the resistance against shopping is strong unless it involves shopping for tools, toys, or trucks.    Remember the three "T's".    And one more thing....it's evil to tell your hubby you're taking him shopping for one of the three T's and end up taking him bra shopping!!!    I just had a brain storm.....what if they had LIVE MODELS?????  I may be persuaded then.|`|FzFSzilmaa	i love looking at womens underwear... even when i'm not with my wife.. ;)|`|muTZeGOgaa	I don't usually set out "to bra shop," but if it hits me when we are at the mall or something, he doesn't mind tagging along. He likes to hold up ridiculous lingerie and say with a smirk, "How about this? This looks like it gives great support!"    He's silly and has fun with it. He doesn't mind.|`|5NKa5Y8laa	Nah.. but I'd tell him I was going shopping for some sexy lingerie.. then I'd wear them home and pop open my shirt to flash them at him..lol.. which he would love!|`|BhXOLas1aa	I have never even taken my husband clothes shopping. He would only go into shock at the amount of money I spend.  I like 'Agent Provocateur' underwear and I've never had anything but approval.   Why should I want to take him shopping anyway when he could be doing something practical like buying me hand made chocolates? :))|`|AA11460234	Hey...look...I do the grocery shopping. That's also because I eat and do the cooking. I have no interest in underwear that supports, separates  and enhances knockers.    Actually...I'm more intrigued about what's in the bra then looking at a bunch of empty ones in the store.    However...if you're looking for someone to give a professional opinion as to how your breasts look in a couple of them you've come to the right place. I majored in Breast Appreciation in college and have a degree in Mammary-ology and Science.|`|3g1ZgTe4aa	Absolutely. Why not? We go shopping for everything else.|`|532XA7lkaa	NO...my husband has no desire to ever shop for himself let alone with me for me!  I don't like him shopping with me anyway...he complains a lot and it's just not his thing.  I buy all his clothes like a teenager haha!  But this is what works for our personalities...he hates shopping and I love it...it's also a great time for him and our 3 year old son to hang out at home while I get some time to myself doing what I enjoy!|`|6aVtiTKiaa	My hubby resists too.  It's pretty funny actually, he'll stop dead right at that line where the bra area starts.  He'll look around uncomfortably for a minute, and then says he'll meet me in the men's department.  It never fails .. I used to try and drag him in, but he fights it hard.    And this is from a guy who's held my purse on occasion.  I wonder why that is ... ?|`|RBQrgByeaa	I see no reason to go along with wifey. Girlfriend, on the other hand ...|`|ByUS0k8waa	I don't have to make hubby go with me. He loves to help me pick them out. Then I know he likes them and I know they will work good. So together they are sexy and comfortable.|`|odQewFgvaa	No I don't take him.  He can see them when I get home.  He would be so bored. That is like him take me tool shopping.|`|W5wCArLqaa	no As long as the shop allows him in a dressing room. He is perfectly fine.|`|C4bxnKDXaa	No i loved this... : )|`|y9CgveCGaa	She has never asked.  I would resist if she did.  I don't think I could add anything helpful to the process.|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	She does not try to take me because, yes, she knows I would resist it.  Now, if she were shopping for them at Victoria's Secret, then maybe I could be talked into going along!  But ordinary bras with only the purpose of keeping the twins in place hold no interest for me.|`|AA11587827	not if they had sporting good in the same dept.
f5u9sxbTaa	why are you making fun of "red dots"? its religious!!!!  um, I would say not allowing girls to date guys from other countries or religions (mostly the middle eastern) is the worst...  DAMN!!!!I'm Sri-Lankan, and I can't go for anyone middle eastern girls than fellow Lankans.   I hate the middle east for this sole reason   :P|`|WMR8hVlfaa	o.O    "The ones with the women that have the red dot on their head."    I don't know about shallow, but you sure are an ignorant one.|`|VHOWEjdAaa	western culture I hate stereotyping...In my opinion I think its stupid and good people get overlook...   -look ok friendly and outgoing people seem warm but propably inside they are spiceful and hateful.You will never know   -and shy and quiet people seem cold but inside they have a good heart when you get to know them they are just the same as friendly people and I like those kind of people they are deep and nice. also just like ..outgoing and friendly people ,seem like they are good at first impression but maybe not long enough...No offense though...This is just my opinion...
ByUS0k8waa	Well its public records. So anyone can find out. Also if you have done your social security card changed then make sure you didn't mail it to the home where he lives. That is how my family found out. If he goes online he can pull it up for like 5/10 dollars. Sorry I would tell him before he finds out from someone else or from the internet. That way he will be mad but not feel like your ling to him.|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	he could look at public records that the county courthouse has. there is no way to hide them either. better off ebing a adult about it and telling him the truth. If you can be honest with your family then you didnt make the right decion getting married. You need to be grown up enought to confront your loved ones, if you cant do that then how in the world will you make a marriage work.|`|a7xuzUPeaa	well he could look at public records if he has suspicions,  other than that i'm not  sure.|`|qXCSWQpdaa	If he checks the public records (all marriages are a matter of public record) of the place where the two of you got married, he will know the truth.|`|YDBpaNPzaa	If you are married why do you care if he finds out what is going to do punish you. Your married now, You are no longer his child to raise! So, tell him yourself. Instead of sneaking around asking this question.|`|c773a6d9618f1549ce3fc0daab46330daa	Yes he can find out being that it is in the public records department, but I would tell him so that it doesn't break his heart worse.|`|AA11417059	Unless someone tells him I dont believe there is. He cant pull the records or anything like that. If you got married without a parent present you are an adult. There's nothing he can do.|`|ExiYNaT9aa	I'm going to tell him
fQgbBx7caa	Let them call you....don't call them.  This is exactly what I am doing to 3 people right now, they do not work so they have the time to make a phone call.  If they do not call oh well, have plenty of other friends I don't need them.|`|Hizsm6m4aa	Once they tell you they will call you sometimes it's ok to give a "Hey how are you?" reminder call. After that it's up to them, but no more than 3 days.
u9RwzLPnaa	You should look for somebody new. While I think a boy should know his father. It sounds like you have given him chance after chance and you know what. There simply comes a time when you have to stop giving people chances.    I would go down to the court and make him pay "child support" and while I'm there possibly get a 'restraining order' maybe. It will send a very strong message that you fed up with this behavior. and maybe he'll pay more attention to his kid if nothing else.    However, you really need to find a new guy.     One your son will eventually grow up and son without there father's around might do the same thing to another woman. Would you want your grown up son to do this to another woman 20 years down the road his father is doing to you right now?    Two, Mother's have a hard time letting go. You might grow too attach to your son and that's not good. Even though it sounds okay, it's actually not.     You have to let this 'man' go.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	You can't force him to see the child if he won't do it.      You can however force him to pay.  if he's not paying his child support then you can take him back to court and garnish his wages or if he's refusing to work so he doesn't have to pay then you can have the judge charge him with contempt and jail him.    A final option is to have his parental rights removed based on abandonment, then you'll be rid of him legally but that won't stop him from trying to make contact later if he has a change of heart.|`|R8fEO8tUaa	telll his father that if he ever wants to see his son again, its permanent, meaning he cant leave and come back a year later    also, wether hes with you or not, request, i mean, demand child support|`|jkgl9WMgaa	You might have to take it to court and have visitation rights set up that he has to follow.  Also, at that point, he will have to pay child support.  Every boy needs a father, but one that does not care for him, visit him often or provide for him is really no father at all.  It would be hurtful to your son to get attached to his father only to have him disappear.|`|0udjgaoBaa	Ive gone through that in my own life....My dad was never around I met him once...But my mom let me establish my own opinion about him. I could care less whether he lives or dies. You should let your son establish his own opinion if his dad wants to come around a few times a yr so be it..As long as his dad isn't a junkie or anything I dont see any true harm.|`|XTy7mLAkaa	Girl, don't put yourself through the drama.  The relationship your son has with his father really isn't your business (just hear me out... don't get mad).  Your son will start asking questions about his father at some point and you'll have to answer him honestly.  Do NOT bash his father, do NOT offer your opinion on him just tell your son the truth and be completely neutral about it.  He will develop his own opinion of him and sure enough, he will learn that his father is a dead beat.      My daughter hasn't seen her father in over a year.  She just barely spoke to him for 3 minutes about two months ago.  She doesn't like him and knows that he's not worth the time.  Of course I wish it were different.  I had a fabulous relationship with my father and I miss him terribly now that he's passed away but you can't do much about this situation.  If dad decides to come and see him, let him come.  Never be the person that kept your son from seeing his father. It'll bite you in the end... literally and you don't need that.  What you want to hear from your son is that you did what you could to make it happen and you're the better person for it.  Trust me girl, it's worth it when it happens.|`|eo9HVIBZaa	Hi,     As a father it broke my heart when my youngest son asked if I was his dad. Lucky for us both and his brother I always wanted to do my best for them.    In your case you got a selfish self-centered BOY. It takes a man to be a father. I would suggest that even though you are his mother to go to the court and file for sole custody. In that process you will also establish child support and visitation. You can request no visitation, supervised or what ever. I would suggest none so that if your sons father regrets his actions further down the road he will have to work at getting back what he threw away.     By the way, I am the parent who has sole custody of my children. And I got them without a fight. But then my circumstances are slightly different.

mLeEQpwHaa	In my perception of reality I do agree that most people have a need for acceptance, a "sense of belonging".  Without this life would have less meaning.      I am however thinking of Mazlow's needs hierarchy, where he proposes that humans need to have a secure life with food, shelter and clothing being the most basic need.    His second basic need is a sense of belonging to family, school, church and social group.  without these two basic needs being met we are incapable of true love which his 3rd level.    Some of us have a greater need to be loved than we need to love.   It i sign of modern society    I guess though that you are referring to a particular person or group of people, who have all of that and still don't want to do the right thing because it might cause them embarrassment or psychological pain for some reason.    I don't know what we can all do about that.  I suppose that we just have to accept such people as being very weak and leave it at that.    (I love the quote from Hamlet.)|`|9vOBtO1Oaa	TRUTHFULLY, FACTUALLY??? YES! Some people need acceptance THAT badly. They forfeit their integrity to be liked. To be admired for being part of the herd. That's a loss of oneself, Methinks!|`|NTUr0t3haa	It depends on the situation. If they are at risk of losing too much, then they are probably not going to stick their necks out.|`|g09x06Zpaa	Yes we really do. We are social creatures who would rather die than be embarrassed.

ee74IXUKaa	I met some of my good Friend girls at the Airport. I travel a lot and I wait a lot by the gate.  Some of my good friends now are from other country which is cool. their more open minded and humurous.

Most of them are 2-3 years older than me.|`|1l04qpOKaa	It takes awhile for someone to turn into that true honest type of friend. Avoid bars, bc usually there only reason is to get wasted.

So unless you are cheating and having two full on relationships, I dont think that you can be IN love with more than one person.|`|6wzQhsIkaa	of course you can.|`|0ac02757252bf3673e5594f1927600faaa	I am currently in love with at least 4 or 5 guys, but just married to one, love the others chaste and from afar, kind of sweet that way|`|H7cNZYIYaa	I never have, sorry that you're having trouble|`|abc74a7841250ed8830346d501f162a7aa	some woman can fall in for what they think is love ,sex , money or just because .there is not perfect man out there yet there is only 1 for another OK|`|4S6V4sb4aa	Yes,, love is a weird thing.. but it's kinda like saying can you love more than one freind, or song, or uncle/aunt.. or more than just one pet..|`|1GxMGmkqaa	me - nah!   others - who knows waht others do...|`|zKjgWdqAaa	Absolutely.  Our capacity for love is unlimited.  Making more than one relationship at a time work, well that's another matter.  Even one is challenging.  I've never pulled off more than one at a time.|`|FzFSzilmaa	have done... :D|`|aC9dBaNqaa	I don't believe so I think you can love one and be infatuated with the other|`|swV3SIw7aa	actually i have  one guy i fell in love with (pfft i know this is stupid) once i met him  i truly did  i met him at an anime convention and i was having a panic attack (im claustrophobic...anime convention+creepy ppl=ppl tackling you into a huge group hug)  the other guy i also met at that convention  he told me his feelings after i started going out with the first guy (who im still in love with)   and i thought about it and realized im in love with him too  i didnt know what to do  but im in love with two guys    hope that helped you at all|`|yz6G7jfXaa	donno about the Ladies,    but guys can. i have, honest.  very very confusing stuff, needless to say, both of them went away!!!

IGY2ofRBaa	awww, thats a tough one, he has every right to be closer to his baby though, and good on him for wanting too. if you have not noticed him acting strange around you like they have discussed getting back together then maybe his reason really is genuine, however if he did tell you to stay because of your job then maybe he is trying to wriggle his way out cause he is scared to tell you the truth cause i cant understand why he wouldnt want you with him if this wasnt the case?|`|lyNgNpRgaa	You melt my brain.  I think I am now stupider for reading that.|`|Hs3ihi4faa	I think u are paranoid too...seriously though you should just talk to him and ask him these kind of questions.|`|jMOhEUjaaa	he makes perfect sense,  i just think your a little insecure  about him getting with his baby momma  but you can't live off your boyfriend, patch things  up with your mom.|`|RvShEWESaa	Talk to his momma,  not him.      If you think your gonna be left behind, you need to know, ask the family.    Bad situation,   I have been there.|`|RNUCiRhqaa	He will leave you I would.|`|T2J8QnBvaa	Make peace with your mom! Seems like your best option. (Or you can sleep in your car!! its up to you to steer a course for your life because others wont!|`|Y2bfm2vUaa	First of all you should make up with your mum just to be on the safe side and maybe just have a little talk with your boyfriend about how worried you are he should understand and reassure you that he would never leave you but if he doesn't then you'll know that you'll need to move on maybe be independent and get your own place that you can afford.  Hope this helps x|`|93ef28cefacaf49d52606517946a2d08aa	You're a mess, I guess that's the reason your folks kicked you to the curb (which isn't the right thing to do), you need to be independent instead of relying on this guy who could go any direction at any given time. Be responsible, make your own life. You are ONLY with him becuase he is providing for you = NOT true love and it's NOT the way to lead a good healthy productive life. He's going to knock you up too and your life will be over before it began. DO SOMETHING WITH YOURSELF GIRL GEEEZ!
AA10272321	Let me ask you, are you a gold digger?|`|sLUiQ6Txaa	im sorry but hes 35 years older than you. get out of there!|`|x3mFm4exaa	yea he just want some eye candy, not a relationship|`|lyNgNpRgaa	He wants sex.|`|JGOeJOFDaa	Yes, he's shallow. He does want sex. AND he wants to make himself feel young again by dating you.|`|WkbEAvZPaa	I would say so. Why else would he want to be with someone that young. I hope your not shallow either, and date this guy for his money.|`|lsFDEx2oaa	To be quite honest, both of you are.    A guy can have preferences, but to only like Asian women is pretty narrow-- thereby shallow.      A girl can have preferences too, but to not even consider dating someone that old is pretty narrow-- thereby shallow.  Dating is getting you know someone is dinner and conversation, not romance, unless you're a hooker.       Regarding everything else, have some confidence.  And grab some water wings.|`|cVOQUBXeaa	All men and women are shallow|`|AA11180444	Maybe the older guy is just being respectful.  Being that "old" is a perception.  Him and you may have tons in common.  Open your mind to his personality and you may find so much more there that you attracted to.  BTW, older men have lived life and know what mistakes NOT to make.  He may be a perfect match for you.  Don't shut him out because he is "old".  Be leary of the fact that he likes asian women, why?  Maybe ask him.  If you don't fit his expectations of asian women, don't do it.
bda293c7e62b91bcb5c4eed0f3cd5839aa	They assume that the guy is tried, tested & works very well, having been test driven by his wife/partner. But they don't seem to think that if he is the type of guy who would cheat on his partner, or dump her for them, then he is the type of guy who would do exactly the same to them in future. I'm sure this is only a small majority of all divorced & separated women.   If this is bugging you, I would speak to your guy about it, because we men can treat such things as a bit of a joke & won't even notice it happening, when in fact it may be very serious & worrying for you.|`|65653c6c063e99db1f7f272c5c93e006aa	1>  It could be she likes the challenge and the chase, some people can't thrive without chaos.    2>  Because there is a misguided sense of security or better yet, safety.    An attached man has answers as to why she can't get a relationship right and she can search them out without confusing issues.(since you are already 'taken').    3>  For the same reason she can test-the-waters without fear of slipping into yet another failed attempt at love.    4>  On the other hand some people seem to need to set themselves up for more hurt. She has a role tape that keeps playing in the sub conscious telling her she can't have and does not deserve a good life.  Many who grew up in alcoholic family structures have such demons.    5>  Or she may have the mindset of, somebody did this to me so I will just get even.  "If I can't be happy,  then nobody's gonna be happy!"    I am not saying any of these are justified; just responding the "why".  In a nut shell, we have been raising our children without God as a guide and a lot of young women don't have moral conviction to help them make choices beyond selfish wants.|`|Acwau1Esaa	Cant say I have noticed droves of women chases men around churches on their wedding day or lining up at school fetes.|`|0TfwJNOfaa	It's probably because women have to train men (or break them down till they lose the will to live). And when the man finally realises this and makes a run for it. Rather than be troubled with having to train a guy from scratch again she opts for a work in progress. LOL all you feminists.|`|IaN8AqtAaa	Some women have serious commitment issues after going through separation or divorce. They go for married or attached men because (subconsciously) they know the relationship will never last.   If they already know the relationship has an expiry date, then it won't come as a shock to them when it does eventually end (shock: like a sudden divorce after years of marriage).    It is a safety net. This is their way of protecting themselves from getting hurt. I know this, because unfortunately I do this. I am a commitment-phobic, and so the only relationship I will let myself get into, is one with a guy who I know will not be able to fully commit to me (eg. a man already in a relationship, a co-worker, a boss, a professor at my university). I hate that I do this, and I feel guilt all the time, but I can't help it. I have absolutely no interest in ruining a family, or "stealing" him away. The minute the relationship starts to get serious, I bolt. :(    Enough about me, I just wanted to explain why SOME women do this. (Other women may just do it because they're *insert word here*).|`|UZ0t2tz4aa	Married men are familiar, understand kids and are not underfoot.|`|RjpPzbBJaa	I don't think its only divorced or separated women. I've found that women in general enjoy "getting" men that are already taken because they often consider it a challenge... somehow, as sick as this is, they get a boost in their self esteem from grabbing a married or taken man. I guess ruining another persons life is what makes them feel more in control, it makes their life not seem as bad? Sad all the way around really....|`|Am1wfhBDaa	Money and security.|`|g2R7e2eVaa	Conspiracy Theorists who have nothing better to do.|`|veZLfnGFaa	That's not necessarily true.  If it were - why do married men make a bee line to divorced or separated women?|`|3Kqe5ZrPaa	it not only women who do that, MEN do it also, my ex is a sample of it. He broke up a very nice family, beautiful children and a wife who did everything for him and he goes and has an affair with his married secertary and she has 4 kids. Her husband left her because we both found out what a B*TCH and B*STARD they both were. he took his kids and moved back to Italy where hes from and now they are both suffering so don't go blaming women, you men are as guilty as anything..|`|AA11241138	all women want what they cant have.    whats with all the thumbs down   dont you like the truth ?????|`|HvALvdc7aa	IDK, but they better stay away from mine.|`|AA11297232	The men have a house a car and everything a woman needs, it is a power thing, a [lets see how many other life's we can destroy] thing. I have no time for common woman like that.|`|WvUP7eJFaa	You are lumping us. I don't date married men or attached men. None of the ladies I know date married or attached men.   That would be like me saying "Why do all men beat their women"? I don't believe all men beat their women. I believe some people do things like this and what you said but I do not believe the majority does.|`|Hizsm6m4aa	It's sometimes not so much about the part that they are attached, it's the qualities that are developed by attached men that are hard to come by with men who are out there just dating and playing around. You learn to be responsible with money, keep a job, pay bills, you are family oriented, and don't play a lot of games when it comes to other people, it also gives a sense of stability and some women want the dream that they can have that. Especially if like you said they were once in the exact same situation, they want the answer to what was wrong with their union.|`|b8f0CfSsaa	1. They don't, there are a lot of divorced women that either remain alone or form new relationships. My mum divorced my dad and did a law degree, she didn't act out your infantile stereotype.    2. Its a two player game, attached men should not have an affair any more than the other women should take part. Women are not illustrious madame's that sit in wait to lure married men in to their sex traps. There is equal weight to each party, anyone who thinks anything else is biased. The men know their attached too you know...or do you think us evil women poison them.    3.Where in hell did you develop this theory? I'm actually intrigued to see as to where your dumb idea came from.
1Z13L9h2aa	Hey there Im not a guy but i guess guys are really like that. But you cant blame them, thats just short-term relationships. It's not like they're gonna marry the girl and settle with them. And dude, what do you expect form teenagers?|`|GBr9YngTaa	When you mean bitchy, how bitchy is bitchy?     I say if she is bitchy to the point where she bitches about everything you do or TELLS you what to do a lot, than don't stay with her. But if she just bitches about things here and there (things that bug her), you won't find a girl that won't.|`|S6nVVfwVaa	no|`|X3GRTBXtaa	no i don't think so, I don't really care all that much if she's very attractive. i care more about who she is.|`|aVPhSOHFaa	like they say Beauty is only skin deep...if she is bitchy all the time and yall are always fighting...i wouldn't want to stay with her...i like guys for there looks yes but....somebody can look really good and be a *****..and it wouldn't work for me...that's just me... my answer made no since at all did it??|`|jl2xZGK6aa	a bichy girlfrend is ok to toy with but NEVA a marriage material|`|H7cNZYIYaa	nope, bitchy girls bug me...|`|MLdykhQNaa	I always love it when someone asks for a guy's opinion and the first two posts are from girls lol.  I wouldn't care how attractive she was.  If she was bitchy I wouldn't date her.
AA11097612	You killed his baby.  He acted cowardly towards you by not giving to you his opinion and then blaming you for your decision but it seems that he does blame you for killing his baby.|`|mjTmQzvFaa	He made it clear he is against abortion and he should've been more upfront on his feelings with that.For you having an abortion , their are so many families out there that can't have children and would love to give a baby a loving home. You could've very well carried the baby to term and immediately signed all rights over to a loving family. That baby was of course defenseless and it was never given a chance to be loved and be a blessing to a family who would love the baby unconditionally. More than likely if you think about it , then yes more than likely it has crossed his mind too and that is more than likely why your friendship is the way it is with him . If you ever have any children in the future and see the love you would have for them , just remember how you'd feel if you were able to remember the love for them and they were all of the sudden not there anymore, it would break your heart . I'm sorry , don't mean to sound cruel , but the abortion thing infuriates me especially when you know the feeling of not being able to have children to love from your heart and soul for all loving eternity.|`|swV3SIw7aa	im sure it did  if your against abortion...  why the hell did you do it?  you could have put the baby up for adoption  x-X  im sorry   really against abortion    and answers  making me mad  x_X|`|fc964df50bc3ae84b97937ecb982821baa	You already asked this one..same answer...YES! If he's against abortions he probably feels you murdered his child so yeah I would think that would change his perception about you.
2Cw0DfaSaa	if you become friends with his friends it will be easier for you to get to know him and vice versa. or you can just start talking to him and suggest that you guys do bible study together or something.. try to find out his interests becasue it will be less awkward and give you guys something to talk about!|`|u7zmUivHaa	6 years is a lot when your young because when your young which i assume you are he has experienced soooo much more than you so if your 15 he has experienced over a third more than yourself has in your lifetime thats a lot, its not so bad when your both older because you have both matured to the same point and have both grown up i wouldnt go out with someone 6 years younger than me and im 20.. i suggest stay away and get someone your own age

He and you are married, and he fired you?  That's so wrong.  Does he have a boss?  If yes, go to his boss and tell him or her what your husband said and did.  And be calm about it, so the boss doesn't think you're simply being a crazy spouse.  Good luck - that sounds like a mess.|`|TfPDMDZMaa	That's messed up! File for sexual harassment. See how he likes that!|`|gdnL63ngaa	Oh well now you can be a stay-at-home-wifie.  Its his fault and now he'll have to work 2 jobs to pay the bills.  Tough **** for him|`|OtfSP7kHaa	Nice one-liner!

If you have been faithful then don't worry. Someone is spreading rumors or is jealous of you at work.|`|AWb0L9IKaa	Sleep you way up with whom? i thought you said he is the boss.
28WJwHf4aa	People change. The person he was as a kid does not mean that it's the same he will be as a teen, no matter how many layers you try to peel back. He is what he is.     You can try to be-friend him again if you want, but if he's only going to be a jerk, why waste your time?|`|qCLWNLCIaa	As boys (and girls) go through puberty, they become crazy, hormonal versions of themselves. In fact, most guys in their 20's will say they have more in common with who they were as a child than who they were as a teenager.  So, if you want that boy back you used to know... you're going to have to wait until he reaches his 20s.|`|lsFDEx2oaa	Alright, first off, you do not love him.  You might of liked how he was back in the day and loved your friendship, but he isn't the same person.. you don't love him.      If you want to try to become friendly with him, give him a call and tell him you want to catch up.  If he says no, forget about him.  If he says yes, great, do something like you used to do back in the day-- bring him a Matchbox car and a juice box, meet him by the swings.  Try to rekindle the friendship, catch up.  If he doesn't meet you half way, forget about him.
G024yAU3aa	Take it from me this boy definitely likes you! You could drop a hint that you are interested in him by asking him what he is up to this weekend.  See if he would like to hang out. That is very informal if you are worried about making the first move to tell him that you like him.  By asking him if he wants to hang out, it puts the ball in his hands to tell you if he likes you or not.  I am not sure how old you are, but a good first date is always a coffee shop-they usually have a good atmosphere to hang out and get to know each other. If you live close to a city or larger suburb-check out a local coffee shop.  Good luck!    Also-just because you went out with a close friend of his-does not mean that he can't date you.  I am 25 and when I was a teenager we always thought that.  Obviously things did not work out with his friend so there is nothing wrong with you dating someone else :)|`|029d970e89f49628d1a27a4f7084f48faa	Obviously he's not totally against the idea of being around you, so go for it. Talk to him, ask him to hang out, etc. Just cuz you dated one of his friends doesn't mean he's off limits. Guys work differently than girls.|`|y2AlaCnfaa	aw thats so cute!   go for him!    give him some hints so he knows your  interested    maybe tell one of his friends to talk to him about you.. and see how he feels.

I've had several REALLY bad tickle tortures,  but one stands out when I was in college.    My best friend got 3 of his other friends to  "play kidnap" me on my 21st birthday. I   came back to our room and they grabbed  me from behind, put a pillow case over my  head, tied my hands and carried me out to their van.    They drove me out in the woods to this shed  where they had it set up, carried me in and took  off my clothes. Then they tied me spread out  to an old damp mattress, still with the bag over  my head. Then they started tickling! I had no  idea who they were yet and OMG I was scared!  But I'm horribly ticklish and I went hysterical in  like 30 seconds.    Anyhow they tickled me everywhere for like  hours and I wet all over the mattress I think  3 times...I don't remember. I do remember being  SURE I was going to die there, because no  matter how much I screamed and begged they  wouldn't stop. I guess it was hours later I felt  myself getting so weak from laughing I couldn't  breathe. Everything went grey, then I passed out.    When I woke up there was my buddy hollering at  me and they were wiping me down with towels.   They were the ones scared by then, because they  thought they had killed me. They almost did!
hhduYRfdaa	Absolutely. People are are always looking for the next best thing. For all you know he may be a shmucko.|`|KBU2X921aa	you have to understand if she is with her bf she is probably not interested in other guys at the time. when they break up i suggest maybe telling her how you feel but its very hard to try to pursue her now and try to break them up. i mean imagine how you would feel if you were with her and some guy tried to be with her and try to break you guys up. I know its hard but you have to be able to get through it. try to be good friends with her now and get close and maybe show her how nice of a guy you are (assuming you are a nice guy).|`|nDQOwAA3aa	damn it, i'm gonna stab that asshole this time.... no, no i'm not but i'll think about it..... haha that asshole had it coming|`|2c3rcQRbaa	No.  That's called stalking and I don't want to get shot.    Find another scrub to pester.|`|X9RBRqL2aa	absolutely not. but the second they break up. im there
9EwN3Q6gaa	if your to shy to approch him ....give him the eye make sure he notices you checking him out ...smile at him....but i would act fast...so many shy women right things like this on yahoo but the next time they write a question on here its usually "i really like this guy but he has another girlfriend what do i do?" so act fast for you might miss you chance. good luck.|`|r1D9P4Vyaa	Ok here is your BEST answer, shooting him a "wink" tells him I think your cute, if he doesn`t talk to you then, when passing him a simple"HI" will tell him I like you with out saying so. I was shy in high school and this is a simple way of showing your fellings, I would then go over and talk to the girl, Good Luck! hope this works for you!|`|UgcPxd4maa	talk to him, flirt|`|2c3rcQRbaa	Tell him that after the meet you want to take a shower with him.    Hell why not?|`|slJlLGMVaa	Start a conversation|`|WWNWtzvDaa	OMG ...talk about whatever it is you teens talk about these days =/     its hardly a life and death matter is it|`|XiT8q49Daa	flirt with him...make your move first...that'll get his attention...|`|1C0Tm9ipaa	Ask him if he can help you stretch before you run.|`|STbRyyEFaa	Well if you are both shy its going to be a bit more difficult. But not impossible. You are spending 8 hours together, that's great! Make the most of it, you have to talk to him. Don't worry so much about the what but more about actually having a real conversation with him.  Good luck and have fun on Saturday!|`|08a48zP9aa	I'm not trying to sound mean but do the obvious talk to him about anything! Ask him if he's looking forward to the weekend or if he's seen any good movies lately. Be friendly and don't think about how you like him just see him as a friend that way the nervousness will go away!    Please help with does he miss me question thanks =)|`|7CXVSa23aa	well, if you really like the guy then you must overcome your shyness and take the initiative to talk to him. you already have something in common because you're on the same team, so things to talk about is not anymore a problem.    don't let the great opportunity pass without taking any action. goodluck and have fun! :D
x25teaR3aa	Hey would i would do as a guy is go to a big Beautiful park like the one in New York , Central park, and just go around and about having fun and watching the scenery . or you could go to a place where you could see the stars at night and just enjoy it with your boyfriend. those are the things i would do and is really cheap.|`|jbGsNRh8aa	See how many ways you can think of to have sex.  Give each other prizes for the most creative.|`|sM6d8ZgWaa	Naked Twister|`|piDDZ6Ywaa	Go out for a meal! That is cheap enough. Go cinemas, or walk around the park. Although, it's cold, watching movies and snuggling up to your boyfriend is romantic and sweet. And um, if your not ready for the whole 'sex' thing, then it can't be fun for you at the moment.|`|P347b7nVaa	same happened to me a few years back. play cards and board games. i know it sounds lame but when you are bored its awesome.lol. or have sex....be safe though.
kRh3slhdaa	It does seem like it's getting more and more popular these days, I'm definitely reading it more on Y!answers and seeing it done on wedding tv shows...I haven't been to a wedding where there is one, so I guess I could say I can see myself entertaining the idea of going down a line of candy and putting candy in a bag I'll never eat. lol. Or even really finish it all. I'd prefer it if it was like a favor placed at the guest's plate, something simple. It does remind me of the stores in the mall too...like I'm paying by the pound, haha.|`|Gx14PIvxaa	For a casual wedding, I LOVE the idea. My friend is going to have something similar, but with individually wrapped candies. I don't know about the whole "scooping your own" thing lol..    I say to each his own. Personally, I am bored to tears at 99% of the weddings I attend. At 26, GOOD LORD I am going to a TON of them these days. I feel like I'm going to blow chunks if I see one more set of silver chafing dishes with baked chicken and green bean casserole (I'm in the South, what can I say). To me, ANY deviation from the norm is WELCOME and appreciated.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	They are alot more popular in theory on the wedding boards than in real life.|`|rDsKB0uXaa	not really havn't heard of it|`|b2Cr9E5Gaa	I wanted to do a candy table, have it nicely set up and this would be my favours, I dont think it was juvenile, it made more sense to me to do that then buy favours that people wouldn't want, or would leave behind.  But I have come to realize, that it might not be the most hygienic thing in the world..and it probably would be much easier if I just wrapped bags myself, so instead ive thought really creative and I am going to get hersey kisses (2 of them) and put them back to back, this will be my rose bud, I will wrap it like you do when you wrap flowers but in clear foil, and for the stem I will put green looking candy then I will put tags on them and leave them at tables for guests.    Its in my personal opinion that anything edible makes much more sense as favours, for the reason that there edible, and they would cost roughly $1 to make each!     So I do see your point, the "buffet" is sort of odd (not to mention the mickey mouse theme :S that's a little strange lol no offence)    haha, good to know I am not the only person who gets bothered by the thought of germs...or stinky hands..eww. and I love kids..but eww.. good comment by another poster, about the generic brand of candies and chocolates! I am going to take that into consideration, and maybe consider sprucing up my idea with a finer chocolate/candy (this might make it more special lol)..thanks I got some help :D.|`|757f10afa027007eb6d9e797f2776feaaa	LOL. The only time I like to scoop candy is when Im at the movies! Generally, I dont eat much candy and like you, would much prefer one delicious bite than a grab-bag of junk.    Ive never actually been to a wedding that had one, but read about it all the time on here.|`|a3422bad6666b60894e80bace0f14387aa	I am glad I am not the only one who thinks the idea is odd. It honestly reminds me of Halloween or the big wall at Mr. Bulky's lol... As an adult, I don't get excited about free candy of that nature. Now if someone were serving personalized Godiva truffles in their own individual wrappers, I would probably take one. But since these buffets seem to be made up of jelly beans, M&Ms, Hershey's kisses and other average all-brand stuff that everyone has been poking around in all day it's nothing that excites me. As for the hygeine of it, I'm with you on that. Just not my cup of tea!     Good question ( =

But ofcourse you wanna visit friends also....  But you are not required to.  My Ex GF is like that and I totally understand her.      I just think.... I dont wanna waste my time watching my girl decide on what to shop for dress for like 3 hrs...  so I feel the same when im just watching TV.    but I dont watch TV, I play Tennis a lot and go with tournaments every 2 weeks.    He can be happy but you deserve to be Happy also. :)
5613b2f0e3965fc16a2ce3623c6c5a78aa	your to young to waste time on head games. tell him the way it is and let him do his thing and you do yours and let the cards fall as they may. its time for both of you to have your own space and move on till you find the guy that does not have baggage or plays head games.|`|IGY2ofRBaa	whats his starsign? lol, sounds like a cancer ,my mine is just like yours! try distancing yourself from him and see what happens. it could be just what you need as he may realise he could lose you for leading you on like this ! let me know :)|`|GTvyBTGyaa	Sounds like he has other interests and it might not be all about his guitar!! I think he has someone else.|`|NJN8tP0Haa	coming from a guy..  not to hurt you..  theres someone else in the picture you dont know about... i could be wrong but i highly doubt it on this one. be careful|`|L0Hz227xaa	i think that he is seeing someone else. Not to alarm you, and do not accuse him, but ususally when things change that drastic in a relationship, there is someone else in the picture. Hemay not be cheating but he may be interested. If you love him have a talk and see how things go for a few more weeks. or distance urself and see if he realizes it and misses you, if he does than tell him thats how u felt too. If he started telling u he loved u all the time, and he doesent show it as much, then there is definilty some talking that needs to be done. It sounds like he is losing interest, but again keep control, just give him space and see what happends. There are always other fish in the sea.
fP46meSmaa	That's what dating is all about , until you find a guy you can call your BF then it's all about getting out there and trying to find the guy you want to be with the most**

But how do I know: it may be to put the toilet seat down after you use it.    Go ahead, let us hear it.|`|a3ODeDf0aa	i would hope that after that long she wouldn't use that as her "consequence" but i guess nobody can give you an opinion if we don't know what she wants you to do...?|`|TAufQoc7aa	lol you obviously dont give a shiit if your not bothered to tell us so we can advise you..|`|UNZuciedaa	if you take the strap on...you are definitely gay|`|NuUdCz0Laa	Then you need to do what your wife is requesting and be a good little boy before she spanks you.  By the way, does she know that your on the computer, I bet not.  So be a cute sub and do what she asks and everyone will be happy, especially us that have to try and figure out what your asking.|`|KILFoc6kaa	It really depends what that thing is, and how serious your wife is about you doing it.|`|jfEOIeSIaa	Well yes. if a woman, or anyone really, doesn't feel fulfilled in their relationship they will walk out, no matter if your together 2 years or 40 years.
ge3meKYEaa	LOL- women's wear daily which is the fashion and Accessories stock report for Fashion and Merchandising companies say that weddings are UP!  Our of all the fashion Industries, weddings it the biggest and the strongest because brides will not eat out, won't buy new work clothing or shoes but will still spend 30,000 on a wedding because they perceive it to the most special day of their life.  Stocks like Vera Wang and David's bridal are excellent compared to Fashion Bug, Ann Taylor and causal clothing shops- same with bakers, caters or anything wedding related.      Most companies like Target are even trying to cash in on this wedding trend and add to their line.  Many card companies are even doing wedding invites instead of printing more Birthday cards...      So even thought there are deals and sales- your not going to get a steal on anything labelled wedding these days.|`|3MDY29gnaa	Well i am getting married in July 09  I booked my reception site back in November. I asked if i was allowed to bring in my own food and they said yes! So i won't be payiing $20 + a head for food. I have a family full of cooks and they are all going to help me out.     My photographer is awesome. When she told be her price i HAD to meet and see her work. Wow is she amazing. She is charging me $250 for as long as i need her, for how ever many pics i need. She will also come with me to the hair salon and nail shop for pics. She is giving me a disk with all of my pics after she enhance, and edits them!    My videographer is the videographer at my chirch. He and his crew tapes the church service every week. He told me to just give him a price. His work is also amazing, he and his crew will be going with me to pick up my wedding dress, go to the nail shop, hair salon, get makeup done, the guys to get fitted and pick up their tux, and to the barder shop with them. Along with the ceremony and reception. I know that videography is very pricy. So i started with $1,000. Just to see what he would say. When i said that he said no come down. so i said $700. he said that will work. Well i met with him last week to give him his deposit and he told me no and to keep it! and said $400 or $500 will be fine. I am getting 25 copys of the DVD.     My baker is awesome as well. She has been doing wedding cakes with her grandma and mother for the past 25years. She is young and fresh out of school but i have seen her work before and i love it. She is charging me $1 per sering with buttercream and $1.25 per serving for fondant.    My wedding dress is from davids bridal    http://www.davidsbridal.com/webapp/wcs/s...    it cost $449 and i went to the local bridal show and got a $50 off any wedding dress gift card. So its $400 and i love the dress.     Favors. we are making CD's of our favorite soings. will make and burn them ourselves. also we will give them a spoon that will have 2 chocolate kisses in it saying "A spoon full of kisses from the Mr. And Mrs." and bubbles    Our DJ is a friend of my mothers. She use to work at a club and goes out a lot. And her friend was the DJ. he has everything you need and he will be out DJ and is charging us $200.     My fianes best friends father has his own limo company   "Ringers Limo" in Columbus, OH (where i am) and im Atlanta GA.   we are using their 2005 Chrysler 300 limo and they gave us a discount rate at $300 flat. Nothing else    um i really cant think of anything else lol|`|2o3BHgCCaa	My Dress: The local bridal store wanted full retail price. I called around all the stockists and got it for $800 less including postage (it is from another state)    The Flowers: Got quotes from florists in the thousands. Went to a wholesale cut flower store and it will be costing us $200.    Photographer: Didn't get his price down, but got an extra 3 locations thrown in, couple portraits (like in a mini studio) for the guests at the reception and a trash the dress session after the wedding thrown in for the same price.     Celebrants: I was lucky with this one as one of mums regular customers is a celebrant so we asked her if she would do it. Instead of $550 we are having her for $350. She is lovely too so that is a bonus.    Unfortunately we went over budget for the reception location so I have to find bargains for everything else. It really is a beautiful place though.  I do bargain though and try to get the best price possible for everything, even if it isn't wedding related.  And I am sure the wedding industry is raking in the money still. Did anyone on here change their budgets because of the economic downturn? Maybe only a few...|`|E7LQp6VRaa	One word... Ebay!|`|wcDy86xuaa	Dealdectives.com|`|DC3ewW37aa	I am getting married in Jan '10 I have started booking and I am getting great deals but I don't know if that is because it is an off season wedding (jan is not that popular in florida), because i really shop around and bargain on everything, or the economy.
cGbTJobeaa	Don't do it.    Of course, if you decide to propose to him, instead of buying him a ring, you might as well give him a dress.  You'll be the one wearing the pants in your relationship.|`|0jUGSaZPaa	You don't have to buy him a ring...but you can... It can be his right hand ring or his wedding band...  I bought my fiancee a tungsten metal ring that he wears on his right hand... He loves it so much that we're looking for that material for his wedding band.    I think a girl asking the boy to marry is cute and modern...  Only concern I have is, if he is more of the "girly-girl" type man he may be crushed if you asked him...  For instance, my fiancee would've killed me if I popped the question, b/c like us women dream of their wedding day, he dreamt of the proposal day...     Feel him out with it before you jump into it.    But, I think it's great!! :)|`|jK9H6PHiaa	I proposed to my fiance and he said yes. I got him a ring then we went shopping for mine.     I see nothing wrong with the woman asking.|`|iZDsMCghaa	Absolutely and Absolutely. You dont propose and than say, great,Jim, now you can buy me a ring,lmao!    I,myself, wouldnt propose, but thats just because I like the traditional way but still see nothing wrong.|`|XZlFLecLaa	this is a really good question! hmmmm....       well.. im very traditional in the way i want a guy to ask me to marry  him.... but ... if the girl wants to ask the guy i dont see why not... i think the girl should get the ring if she is going to pop the question ...     sounds interesting!|`|E7LQp6VRaa	It isn't inappropriate at all...     I asked my fiancee to marry me,  we are getting married this October!|`|nFlaPmnTaa	hmm it's not traditional and he may feel embarresed    but if you do ask then get him a ring|`|Gx14PIvxaa	I think most males would be a little embarrassed - since it's "traditional" for the male to ask. IMO, it's kindof about chivalry. The man wants to have that moment of proposing and asking you to be his wife.    However, if the couple is really modern and into all the "no gender roles" stuff, then he might like it!|`|b24WMflsaa	nup u cud ask him 4 marring you  but leave the ring thing to ur boyfriend even if he ever cares!!|`|AA10431095	i asked the same question once, and the general verdict was NOT a ring, but an expensive watch or maybe a great white-gold bracelet. You can ask him to marry you, but no rings. Apparently its gonna be a EGO issue :S
a3422bad6666b60894e80bace0f14387aa	David's has online specials for $99, can you check that out? They also have a once-a-year $99 sale thing, maybe that will work if you find out when it is.    Websites like Craigslist and Freecycle and eBay may be helpful.    Goodwill and the Salvation Army sell dresses for ~$25 each. Some new, some used. Check stores that sell prom gown like Macy's. Check JCrew, Target, White House Black Market and Lord & Taylor. If it is not labeled a "wedding" dress it is usually less expensive.    As for renting, look it up in the Yellowpages and call around.    Good luck!|`|7b2543f014645ca0e174d68a6e38c580aa	Please open this wabsite http://www.craigslist.org and city Tacoma WA and see lot of advertisement for wedding dress.

16b3340f6b3002b4cd5a1b38e48064f1aa	All men are different, or at least there's several different categories; you know him better than us, so trust your own instincts.  Just go out on a date with him and see how things go, don't only talk about your kids, try to show him other sides of you.  If the 1st date goes well and leads to a 2nd date, then maybe on the 3rd date try broach the subject... just ask: so how do you feel about dating a single mom? Ask if he's looking for a long-term relationship or just dating, and be honest about what you are looking for. Don't get into the whole "well I'm not trying to find a new daddy" thing, just keep it simple, make sure he understands that while you're interested in dating, you have kids and that means you can't always be spontaneous, kids get sick, you have to rely on babysitters ect.  Take things slowly and deal with issues as they come.|`|UNZuciedaa	most likely, he's just looking for a little action|`|veZLfnGFaa	You really won't know what to expect until you get to know him better.  Take your time - don't get in any hurry.  Watch how he treats your kids.  If you feel comfortable, take it to the next level.  It all depends on what you want.  Good Luck :)|`|BhXOLas1aa	Take it one step at a time. Pray about it and let God guide you.  Enjoy it too.|`|5NKa5Y8laa	I would assume that he is interested in you, and probably a family man, who doesnt mind you have children from your previous marriage.  Take is slow so everyone can get used to him being around.|`|SoMLkSPTaa	A man expect the same thing he does out of any relationship. Someone to love and share his life with. Some guys love children so see how he is with your child. Date him see how things goes. If it is meant to be then it is but just remember not sure how old your child is but have him or her involves as he or she will have to be with him also. It isn't just about you it is about your child also, men will come and go but your child will always be there for you.

Its ok as long as you love the person your with, you'll feel totally comfortable . or if your single , its ok its not bad i do that almost all the time and i have no regrets.

GUUa1s6Laa	For sure, just dont give her a creepy compliment. Make sure you are sincere, which I am sure you are:)|`|lsFDEx2oaa	It'd be kind of weird if you guys never made a non-verbal connections, like looking into each others eyes, nodding at each other, a half smile or something.    So, here's what I would do.  Build the attraction over the course of a couple days, make sure you guys non-verbally connect.  Then towards the end of the week, when their guard is down, go up to her and ask her with a smile if she is stalking you.  Keep it playful, keep it light.  Take her off guard, then compliment her.|`|JGOeJOFDaa	Yes! Girls love compliments!

Then retype in the address and see if it works then.  If it doesn't work then I have no idea. It might be your service provider...|`|jaAolejUaa	i cant even get in the website.  if i want to lookfor some dresses i just search it in google  probably theyre fixing the site|`|DqetlSB6aa	I accessed it yesterday evening and this morning.  Hmmm I don't know.  I just typed in Davidsbridal.com and it let me in. I dont have an account with them    http://davidsbridal.com/webapp/wcs/store...|`|ZbCLP2Kxaa	Yeah the site is having a lot of problems right now. I think they're updating things or something. Most of us can't even get to the site.|`|Em64TFqgaa	I can't log-in either. Try waiting a few days.
rADoF6Pfaa	well first it depends on the problem and then u and ur friends can work things out by talking to each other and telling them old good memories u guys had together....|`|NNkKixlVaa	u need to understanding each other..need to avoid the bad habit ego..than its all be fine..dnt worry friend..|`|9xI1qhbJaa	discuss the problem and analis my mistake and take solve the problem|`|mFB52yF6aa	we dont know what your problem is, but whatever it is, you just need to tell your friend what you feel and what you want. if you are true friends, you will surely undestand each other.......|`|KaAXJJo8aa	What is the problem?|`|a1dpU3JMaa	just discuss it with your friend
TShsb3EXaa	If you wanna be friends be friends...  You don't have to say you wanna be best friends.. That will come over time..  Or just say that you wanna be best friends see how it goes...  I doubt you should sign anything.. It'd be pointless..|`|8yGKvP5xaa	Real friends don't/do not need, to sign contracts.
Midbg5BJaa	I stand by my last answer to this question earlier today|`|9AGTYeU7aa	Yes he can take the car. You have no legal rights here at all if your name is not on the car title.|`|IdtzdpqGaa	he is not taking your car if the car is in his name. by the law he owns it
Oc3lmykaaa	i've been wondering the same thing for the past 4 months i've liked a guy and i dont think he even knows i exist, sorry i couldn't help|`|TLgWwxN1aa	flirt with him a lot touch not sexually just flirtatiously
kJ4g1vujaa	16 years now.  Its ok, you learn to live with it.|`|abc74a7841250ed8830346d501f162a7aa	hell no .I can guess you have  not had sex in 10yrs too ?
4cdq26oraa	I'm sure some guys don't care and others would say whatever you wear, you'd look great in.  But honestly, I'd try asking in a round-about way what type of gown style (give examples to him) that he likes and try to find something you both will be happy with. I only caution on this as my bride-to-be never asked me, and ended up getting a mermaid style gown. She still looked very beautiful, but I kind of was expecting more of traditional style mixed with some new features. I stupidly made the wrong comment and it didn't make her or I very happy about it for some time.  He doesn't have to see the final product (and spoil the whole surprise thing), but he should have a little input if you want to avoid a potential issue.|`|bXGwTQy6aa	we dont really care much...sorry to burst your bubble..we love the fact that we finally found someone to devote our life and attention to but the only thing that we love more than a bride its a beautiful bride,so get the most beautiful gown you could afford
YDBpaNPzaa	Why do you feel like if she finally gets a divorce and stops seeing him and starts to build a faithful relationship with you that you will have won, and some how you will feel like a better person that he is. You have all these questions of her actions, and his actions, and how she flirts and sleeps with you during the week and him on the weekend and how he's a loser and you make more money and basically your just and all around better person down to her mother confirming it. What about your actions, what about why do you remain involved in it. All you want is for her to pick you over him so you can have some false sense of I'm better than you. And, after you two get together you will do this to her, I'm better than you attitude look at what you did when you were married.  You should be greatful that I let you have me.   There is nothing healthy about this, and if your so smart and so well  put together you would know that.    And, why question what's really going on with them?  What's really going on with you?|`|UNZuciedaa	once it goes beyond just being f*** buddies it's time to find a new partner|`|Midbg5BJaa	You're right, that's f*cked up...    Sounds like her hubby has a hold over her or vice versa and she's in love with you...|`|fmIDB4ZFaa	You are acting like a victim.  STOP screwing her!|`|HPqCRBq8aa	Her heart is still with her husband, but her mind is telling her something different. You are going to lose in the end. I would break it off.|`|dEFap0Zaaa	Aren't you the guy that lives in Slutsville? Or is it her......I forgot|`|AA11460234	Forget the husband...she's the one that sounds like trouble.    I'll bet if you ever tried to dump here she'd go apeshit on you. Frankly pal, she sounds dangerous. I think you're playing with fire.|`|5NKa5Y8laa	Why do you even want her if she is sleeping with both you and her husband?  ewwww  Get your own girlfriend and leave another man's wife alone.|`|IOXBuE58aa	First off dude, u shouldnt be screwing a married woman. If u are, then ur an azz, but i am just pissed casue i think my wife is having an affair.  Second, i've come to the understanding that woman who cheat on husbands have other problems, like my wife i think she is bipolar. That being said, she will probably continue to cheat wether she is with u or current husband. Find someone who isnt f_cked up in the head and married. Move on!!!!!|`|CA06qy8Laa	She is messed up let her go.  She never picked you, she married him and continues to go off with him cheating on you.  If all was well and she divorced him and chose you,  1.  You would not trust her. 2.  She would not be a challenge and it would bore you.  So, there is nothing good that can come of this relationship.  Do you not think of yourself as deserving of a good relationship.? You know you are better than that.|`|UFOdwXgfaa	STOP ASKING THE SAME QUESTION OVER AND OVER AGAIN.    You already know what we think|`|5BKHud3baa	Ok she leaves him. Now what? Would you, Could you ever trust  woman with such low standards that she would cheat on her husband?  While you are tangled in the mess you are blocking true blessings.   Get out!|`|bnFcjEptaa	RUN!!  This woman has serious issues with men and you are in for a rude awakening.  She will tire of you and be off looking for someone else.  Who knows she might have someone other.    Sounds as if she hasn't finished "sowing her wild oats" and if you are too young to know what that means, you need to look it up.    If you have the feeling that something is weird, then you need to listen to your inner voice!!  Plain and simple.|`|tvK1xjzkaa	sounds like she is using you to fill the gaps in  her marriage that her husband still has her heart...You are just going to hurt your self. you need to leave and don't ever mess with a married woman..its bad news
vvcaO1xgaa	in my opinion.."hold thy horses!".. there are 3 reasons for why i say that:  1) there is a huge probability of you getting infected by some STD.. You don't want that. Besides, are few minutes of pleasure worth screwing up your entire life?  2) there ain't nothin' manly about getting sex for money. Any jackass/idiot can get it like that. What's the fun there? Go out and hunt!  3) Be man enough to stand up for yourself and your ideologies. Don't be a sheep!|`|VsLSJ65Paa	Stand by for what you believe in, dont give into peer pressure for something this serious.|`|lyNgNpRgaa	Do some research.  If you wear a condom, you have less then a one in a million chance of catching anything and statistics show sex workers (in the U.S. anyway) are less likely to give you an STD then some random person you pick up at a bar.|`|FzFSzilmaa	why didn't you go to one of the really fun women's strip places.. where you can watch the men strip then when the place closes its door, everyone gets down to some serious sex?? ;)|`|Gx14PIvxaa	I wouldn't go. You sound like you already question it in your mind, like you are uncomfortable with it. If that's your thing, and it's legal (how?), then more power to ya. Personally, paying for sex is creepy to me. Not to mention all the diseases out there and the possiblity of pregnancy (even IF you use protection). I'd stay out. =)|`|PEbFQtL6aa	I would hate to lose my virginity to a hooker.....
DKyV5CU1aa	booty jeans, no flatts!  skater shoes, and leave ur hair down, find s T that you really like, just b ur self,   ;)|`|DBdR26Ssaa	just keep offering to put out. you shouldnt have a problem finding someone to do it with. guys dont really care what you look like as long as youre giving it up.
slJlLGMVaa	Ask her out, she'll warm up eventually ;)|`|PQ7E9oO2aa	ask her out|`|1aYKV8Nzaa	Well, I am also a shy girl.  girls just need time. I would not break up with her because she is shy (that's crazy). Let her get used to you. You are her first bf. :)   GOOD LUCK!!!|`|rvSrjNeQaa	Keep it up and find the success !!|`|JB9ZV8Qnaa	dude ur lucky, if you are her first bf you get to teach her everything from a to z the way u like it. it will take time but u wont regret it.|`|gHLQMjcdaa	she doesn't want you to think she's an easy girl who'll sleep with you right away. and she's probably clueless on how to act around a guy since you said she's never had a bf
veZLfnGFaa	No.  How can you love someone so much that makes you cry every day?  You will never be able to trust him because he always breaks his promises.  It's up to you, but I couldn't live that way.|`|n7vsfdplaa	He is no good for you or your self esteem. You need to face up to what he's doing to you emotionally and see that you're miserable. All the good times in the world can't make up for the fact that you're crying almost everyday unfortunately in those situations when the relationship is gd you forget how bad it is when he breaks the promises and all the misery he causes you.|`|d5COR2S2aa	exactly what promises does he break? if he's like this, talk to him about it first... cuz maybe he's not aware of what he's doing... and then ask him to change for you.... and then if he is STILL being like this, dump him!|`|QgKAL3sEaa	have you told him what he's doing? you need to. it's such a difficult situation i'm so sorry. he needs to know that what he's doing is hurting you so much, and he either needs to stop making these promises or to keep them! it isn't worth it but you both deserve love and happiness... if you're 'soul-mates' then you can work it out. good luck!|`|7CXVSa23aa	if you'll ask me, i think you should break up with him.    relationships are built on trust, and that's exactly what your relationship is missing.    sure every relationship has it's own ups and downs, but it shouldn't be to the extent that you cry almost everyday.    you shouldn't just settle for less than perfect. i know there is still someone who's way better and more worthy than him.    goodluck.|`|maE2pBEdaa	I think u have to talk to him and tell him what's going on then if he still doesn't listen break up.|`|a1uoxczTaa	i think u need to be more on him to keep his promises then to just go and break up with him. when i first started with my boyfriend he was always late and breaking promises but soon enough he got the picture that i was gonna wait for him or put up with it. u need to show him that u r not willing to put up with it. if u cant handle it any more and breaking up is something you find as the only solution, maybe it is what is best.|`|51dBB5Q4aa	bail out while u got a chance. u deserve better.|`|29ddeea7f871392bf7b17a12fc77a694aa	instead of breaking up with him just talk to him about it and if he doesnt change in a couple months then i would consider it but if you have already talked to him about it then i would say give him one last shot cause the pain that comes with a break up is really really bad so i would talk to him about it first|`|ubdEwzcoaa	Listen to your heart, what do you desire? Dont do anything you regret! If you honesty feel that breaking up with him will make you feel better than thats what you do, but if it will only make matters worst than stay with him for the love and try to work things out.|`|z3QsWmzpaa	the exact thing happened to me like he would say i promise to call you back and he would just forget and stuff like that so i asked him is he even that bothered about me and he was like yeah and i was like well you keep breaking your promises and stuff and now he never breaks a promise i think you should just tell and if he still breaks his promises then i think you should finsh with him he's not worth it but its up to you   good luck =]|`|yPU75DdIaa	ok first what dose he promise? like to stop a bad habit or to do something for you what is it?  and second i say talk to him and tell him how it makes you feel and if he really cares about you than he'll  seriously work on it!|`|Z3Mv1pxaaa	No.First of all if he makes you cry every day he's not perfect for you . Look for someone who makes you smile everyday promises or no promises|`|ZdqCE5Pqaa	DUMP HIM|`|pdPX1Pt6aa	If you don't like it when he breaks his promises than you should sit down and talk to him about it see whats going on in his life to cause him to not be able to keep his promises. And if he continues to do so only you can make the decition of staying with him or leaving|`|AE0nK4Q3aa	don't let someone telling you you're soul mates get int he way of reality. tell him how you feel. you can't trust him. if you want to take it sereous, first talk with him and realize, if you cant' trust him, you need to break up with him. it'll be hard, but better in the long-run. so talk with him, tell him how you feel, and solve the trust issue before taking this relationship to another level.|`|trMaIiicaa	Definitely talk to him about it. You shouldn't be crying all the time, thats for sure. And if he really cares for you and wants to be with you forever, he shouldn't like the fact that he is making you cry. If he doesn't change, I wouldn't stay with him (personally). I love being happy - and my boyfriend should only enhance my happiness, not bring it down.|`|EJKhLW2Baa	if u love him so much them you would let him go. he is not worth it and you deserve much better!!! good luck!|`|lfKWA2Agaa	Personally I think you should dump him, if he lies to you, breaks promises, it isn't worth it. I had a boyfriend like that, and he dumped me saying that his mom made him, because she didn't want him to make the phone bill more expensive, but then he went out with this girl the same day, she dumped him in a day also, and plus let's just say almost every girl in my school hates this girl... And he lied to me, made empty promises, and plus when his relationship ended in a day, a couple days later, he starts talking to me again. Trust me if he is just going to make fake promises and break your heart, he is NOT worth it.|`|J5KpCgeEaa	Break up with him!  He is either a habitual liar or doesn't care about you enough to keep his promises.  If you don't want to break up then try and talk to him about the situation and give him the ultimatium that if he lies to you again then it is over and really make it over.
mBEGTccdaa	Ah the life of young girl drama! I kind of miss it. All you can do is ignore it and focus on the important things like school and your future. Yes those words you probably hear everyday but there is a reason for that. When I got my job in high school it worked out because I had an excuse not to answer my phone and hang out with them everyday eventually making cooler friends that weren't lame (gossip = lame) and repeatedly boring!|`|aPt19Z8vaa	Sounds like you got a problem. But you know that.     Look, I think your friend sucks up because she thinks that if she doesn't then she might lose that friend. Im sorry if this doesn't help but i don't know what else to tel you.|`|2Cw0DfaSaa	just ig
eO4y3m1maa	I didn't kiss a boy until i was like 16-17....just because it never arose....everyone thought i had but i hadnt.|`|OEaBSuaWaa	i havent either, im almost 15.  im planning not to kiss until im  engaged.|`|V7wn7W4Kaa	a little yeh.  wen you meet the right guy itl all be okayyy!|`|zhTcwCI1aa	no..it doenst matter when u kiss a guy...i didnt til i was 15 some ppl dont until they go to college...|`|VtZN0ov0aa	No it's not weird at all. It's weird when people DO have serious relationships when they're like 12 and stuff :L|`|P347b7nVaa	i was 19 when i first kissed a girl so dont feel bad.|`|YlMkQRLKaa	No. And do not hurry. Don't do things you'll regret.|`|mINKANlAaa	nah, im 14, 15 in June and i havent kissed a boy yet either. just waiting for the perfect guy i guess :)|`|sM6d8ZgWaa	Not weird but in some parts of the world you"d have a husband, two kids and three goats :)|`|pA4GHLXcaa	No!  It's not weird at all.
7FGsxx4Qaa	Look,you're not responsible for him nor what he does so get on with your new boyfriend and let him sort himself out................|`|MIiuJzJNaa	very easy....... be honest with him. tell him that if he is a cutter than he is not worth your time and you dont need him in your life. and dont worry about him. if he really wants to still be with you maybe he will wait but if he doesnt leave you alone than just tell him that you wont talk to him if he continous cutting|`|Xf93fRTTaa	Don't date a cutter. Cutters are kinda pathetic.|`|swV3SIw7aa	oh i love those kinds of people  x_X  send him to therapy!!  >  gah  i really dont know  explain to him that you did find someone else  explain that your happy now  explain to him cutting is the most selfish way of suicide (even though all suicide is selfish) and that its stupid he resorted to that    im sorry your going through this though  good luck!  |`|Eit68exyaa	What is cutting ?  I want to know.  Well, let him see you with the other guy, and it may even help to show anger, and no smiles or politeness to him.  That helps him get over the fantasy that he has a chance with you.  The mind fills the blanks with hopes and good things, so you fill them in with bad and negative to break up the fantasy and the desire.
iPNOVR6Gaa	Two things:    1. You should try to find out what happened to him in his life at the end of a January (or the beginning of a February) that was really hard on him.  Did one of his parents die around this time?  Is this when his divorce went through?  Sometimes people handle their feelings better simply by bringing the unconscious into the conscious.    2. Despite what you said, you're terrible about picking your battles - come on, you fought over who farted!  It takes two people to have a fight, so yes, YOU fought over who farted.  Stop it.  It takes two people to have a fight, so stop fighting if you don't want to.  Nod your head, smile, say "sorry" cheerily even when you don't mean it, etc.  Just stop fighting.  You'll feel better, and he'll feel better, and it will help a lot if you just decide you're just going to weather this bad mood he's in and not resist it.|`|IOXBuE58aa	Go on a date, get all dressed up make urself look great.  Make it known that he will have a wonderful night if he plays his cards right. Then at dinner u talk to him, its just that time of year. After xmas i think things get back to normal and take some adjustment and with the economy, stress is all over the place.  If he wants to have a good time he'll talk with u and hopefully u can work out the issues.  Hope this helps, i'd talk if u did this.|`|d20mM90uaa	SOUNDS LIKE MY FAMILY, MY HOUSE....  I AM TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO  LITTERALLY WE FIGHT OVER FARTS TOO  IT IS CRAZY|`|4boTYkt7aa	Relationships are hard sometimes,but it is so worth the struggle.Everyone has times like you are describing.I don't think you should leave,You should do your best to help him through these tough times.Later,when he looks back,he will see how much you love him.Maybe he is worried about losing you,so he figures he will push you away,but you need to let him see that when you said you love him,you meant that.It sounds like he is going through some things that he is not telling you about,and won't tell you until he is ready.But you might want to come to him at the right moment and tell him that you are in this relationship too and you want to comfort him,but you don't know how if he won't let you in.I hope this helps.
VrXSqNsPaa	Well i like a guy thats interested in me and what i lik doin and lik if i asked him about it i wuld know he listened     1.Family  2.Friends  3.School  4.Subjects  5.Hobbies  6.Animals  7.What they lik doin at the weekends  8.Music  9.GCSEs or exams   10.Sports  11.Books  12.Movies  13.Shops  14.Holidays  15.Where they hav been abroad  16.Wat they wanna be wen they grow up  17.Their style  18.Instruments  19.Internet like bebo or msn  20.Their favourite things|`|yPU75DdIaa	ok here's one ask her about herself  make a few complements if she sez something bad about herself (true or not)|`|MzP52FsBaa	Music, Hobbies, Family, Friends, Food, Home, Work/School, holidays, talents, news (be up to date), current events, places you like to spend time, Celebrities, what you did the past week, your favourite place to eat out, sports (?), some sort of story about when you were younger/little, the things you always wanted to do but never did, the things that you did and then something funny that happened to you.    Don't ever bring up past relationships. It's a bad idea!!
b2Cr9E5Gaa	Go to youtube RIGHT NOW!!!  type in the search...  Funny First Dance  Wedding First Dance  Bridal Party Wedding Dance    something along those lines..freaking hilarious..I even posted a question on this once asking if people have actually ever seen this happen.  Personally, I chickend out of the idea a long time ago...however a couple vids showed really really sweet first dance songs..that all of a sudden turned into some crazy cool dance..I would consider doing a really sweet slow dance, or something lovey dovey with a good beat..having it choreographed would probably help us both considering we CANT DANCE lol.    The others that are sooo cute I suggest you look at, are father daughter first dances..my favourite on youtube is the one when the father and daughter are dancing to temptations- My girl..its sooo sweet...warning..some of them just might make you cry..and then laugh! If you got the guts..do it!|`|y2nC8BUGaa	sounds like a great idea. I'd do it if I could dance.    I love the techno remix of 'Everytime We Touch' by cascada.  That would be fun to dance to.|`|a3422bad6666b60894e80bace0f14387aa	We are having a two step choreographed for us for our first dance to Josh Turner's "Would You Go With Me?". I think it's a great idea and it has been a lot of fun! There are tons of options, we chose our song because we like it and it's pretty much "our song" and it was a bit faster, we didn't want a slow song either.    Good luck and have fun!|`|gK0vcdnDaa	here is a link, I'm on my work computer so I can't get it to work...  http://www.parkwayreststop.com/archives/...  It might work for you, my mom sent it to me and I was laughing out loud!    But you can also try you tube / google / yahoo search for "Ultimate Wedding Dance" A few of the same song combination and same moves I think someone was unoriginal... lol... but yeah - basically is the "Evolution of Dance."     All super cute and unexpected :)    Good Luck!    -Elle|`|0jUGSaZPaa	I think it's fun!!  It def. gets the crowd going!!    Here's my suggestions:  Footloose  Whip It  Michael Jackon's The Way You Make Me Feel  Justin Timberlake's My Love  Amii Stewart's Knock on Wood|`|4lL34wJnaa	My fiance and I are planning on dancing to this song:    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_v468ptu...    It's upbeat, fun and different, but still shows everyone our love.    Because it's so trendy to start off with a traditional slow song and then bust out into a mix of dance songs, we wanted something totally different.  We are not trendy or traditional people.  We chose a cute "oldie" that we both adore.    We had considered purchasing "red energy domes" which you can find all over the internet and dancing to "Whip It" by Devo for our first dance.  Then we found a better song that we like a lot more.
bAbb37Adaa	It definitely does. I take a business trip for a week every month, and after coming home it's like a mini honeymoon (emotionally, not physically). I miss my wife every time I'm gone, no matter how I'm feeling when I leave. Try it and you'll be surprised.|`|5NKa5Y8laa	Yes and no.      Yes if you are emotionally close, good communication, and faithfull.  Reap the benefits of your reunions.    No, if either of you are insecure, or cheating.|`|3g1ZgTe4aa	Yes, I think so. I went away for a week to visit my family. I felt like I was gone forever. At the airport when I saw my husband again, I was so excited, and he looked so different. My heart leaped.I have been married for 15 years at the time. I fell in Love all over again. So, I have to agree. The longer the better.|`|UlEFgavdaa	Yes, I agree with your mother.  People tend to think that marriage is constantly passionate and that you are constantly madly in love with one another. The main point is that you continue to realize you love him even though your feelings may fluctuate - that is what marriage is.|`|gLH0gcXtaa	I think Balance is key to a healthy, happy life.    If you see someone too much, it might feel like they are infringing on your space. And you might start to take them for granted because come on, they're ALWAYS there (even when you want some time alone).    If you don't see someone at all, you won't be able to miss them because out of sight is pretty much out of mind...That's how our biology works.    So yes, do things apart from your partner/lover/man. But it doesn't have to be weeks. A day or two is sufficient for you/him to realize how much you do love and care for each other.    Good luck!|`|rQd7QuRcaa	i don't think it does it probally doesn't|`|kEtYEmhqaa	I have several coworkers who think so.  They claim that business travel has improved their marriage.|`|Ccs9LeIEaa	then i dont think so, not in marriage.     but i do think you need some time for yourself. having your hubby watch the baby while you go out with the girls once a week or go for a spa day or something.. .(even getting a sitter so he can have time away too) that might do the trick.|`|qXCSWQpdaa	Only at your age.|`|AA11460234	Absence makes the heart grow fonder however with others absence makes the heart wander.|`|nrnVqh7iaa	Out of sight, out of mind.|`|77ZVd5hyaa	Yes it sure does.|`|y2AlaCnfaa	no

gK0vcdnDaa	We were planning on doing the same thing, BUT when we sat down and really looked at cost we figured that we'll spend the same amount doing it "right" versus eloping.      We are doing an outdoor ceremony (San Diego), wedding attire, standing "room" only, BBQ/Beach Reception/Party/Bonfire.  Sounds like you are paying for the same things: the attire, the photographer, a Justice/Officiant...  what else is there really other than inviting everyone to join you?  And having the reception the same day is nice - you were going to spend that money anyway.  You don't have to do something very costly - tea/coctail/brunch/do a cake, a toast and a dance, then call it good.  Celebrate!    I've seen a lot of family issues with eloping, hurt feelings that you left someone out - especially the family.    I wish you the best of luck!    -Elle|`|AA11603468	If you are thinking of eloping to save money, then you wouldn't have the big reception afterward-that's where the money is spent. Most brides probably spend 60% or more of their total budget on the reception. You can get married for very little money no matter how many guests you have, but you cannot have a reception for tons of people without spending lots of money. Photographers are also well-paid.     Elope if you want something between just the 2 of you, but don't elope to save money. With your plan, you won't save anything.    Also, don't you think your family would want to be there? I know my family would have been very hurt not to be included in this huge moment in our lives. His family would have been devastated, as he's their only child.|`|vtW3qPZmaa	My cousin did a semi-elopement... she told her parents that she was going to do it and invited them and her fiance's parents to go with them and be witnesses if they wanted to.  They chose to decline the offer, but the fact that they asked made the situation better.    Nobody was offended by their decision, the main thing is that they're happy.  They had a house party after the fact to celebrate which they invited everyone to to show us photos etc - they had exactly the day they wanted to (they flew out to NY to get married in Central Park) and everyone was happy that they were happy.    Anyone that gives you a hard time for eloping is doing it for selfish reasons, they ought to be pleased that you've found someone you want to spend the rest of your life with, and not bitter that they didn't get to have a meal out of you.|`|LMGWEPBtaa	Lots of family problems. Lots.|`|AA10431095	firstly, eloping has fanily problems... but who cares?    1. ELOPE  2. to cut costs, possibly make it a thursday dinner????  3. or, maybe, you can have a bar-b-q... on your lawn???? on the beach???    seriously, if you're eloping, there are no boundaries!|`|a3422bad6666b60894e80bace0f14387aa	My aunt eloped when she was 17, which was 43 years ago. She didn't tell anyone, not even her mother. The family issues that arose from her aloping were enourmous and to this day some of the wounds have not healed. Her mother was incredibly hurt that she didn't even tell her they were getting married. Her father was furious because he would have attended and helped them pay for everything. Her sister felt alienated and angry for not being told. Pretty much the entire family felt that she didn't trust them enough to share what should have been the most memorable day of her life. And to this day, my aunt says if she could take it back and be up front and honest with everyone she would. Just some things to keep in mind. Not every situation turns out this way but some do.     Good luck with your decision!|`|iuSrMdwmaa	Problems include hurt feelings of family and friends.    But if you elope in a destination wedding you might have problems when you get back with simple things like changing your name. Most jurisdictions accept a local marriage certificate as sufficient proof for the bride to change her name to the groom's without any legal fees or paperwork. Where the marriage certificate is a foreign one you could be required to go through a formal legal change of name process, which will cost you.    Eloping doesn't necessarily save money - there could be travel and other costs.    Another way to save money and reduce the stress of wedding planning is to have a surprise wedding - invite family and friends to something simple, like a backyard barbeque and spring it on them. You need to have a good reason for the gathering so people important to you will be sure to attend.|`|AA12245847	Well I would not "elope" per say.  I had the same problem as you several years ago--it was going to have to be a huge affair so people wouldn't feel left out.  SO we went to Vegas.  I told people we are going to Vegas and if they want to come take a few vacation days and join us, fine.  They paid for everything themselves.  We wound up having about 26 people come along.  WE had the wedding at The Monte Carlo hotel and then took everyone to dinner.  Never had any problems or regrets.  It was EASY!!!|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	Yes, family troubles as others have said.  Choose ONE way of doing it. Either go away and elope, and have that be it. Or, have a ceremony and reception for family and close friends, for a number and in the style which you can afford.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	Make sure that you aren't eloping just to spite your parents or relatives.     If you truly want to save money by eloping, don't have the reception afterwards since that is where all the money you saved will go in the end. So you aren't saving any money. You're still spending what you would have if you had a regular ceremony at home. People generally understand that some people wish to elope. 99.9% of folks don't feel entitled to the couple hosting a reception afterwards, nor do they expect one. Anyone who does is doing it for the wrong reasons. If you want to have a party for everyone, don't run away for the ceremony. You can't have your cake and eat it too.|`|cOYkCEZsaa	My husband and I eloped and our families were really supportive. My fathers only request was that we have someone we know there to stand up with us so we did. It was really nice. The only real problem I had was that the people I worked with at the time were really offended by it and were rude to me about it, and I didn't care about their opinions anyway so it didn't really matter, but one girl went out of her way to try to make me feel bad.
2c7869fbf2bfda8e590501ddb5545f2caa	She would love that.  There are not many girls/women who wouldnt appreciate flowers.  Get her some lillies or freeshias or the love flower............. roses.    Have a great day with her.|`|Xf93fRTTaa	Any girl would appreciate that. Do you know what her favorite flowers are? Try to find out -- without asking directly -- what her favorite flowers are.     If you can't find out, go for Casablanca Lilies (though they smell kinda funny) or something else unique. Try to avoid the only standard -- roses.    Unless those happen to be her favorites.|`|MWrwnHM2aa	Maybe, It honestly depends on what she has her heart set for.   If she is a lovely, grateful girlfriend then yes!  If she has her heart set on something particularly she likes then I would save up a bit. Try asking her anything she really wants, this will give you a clear answer.   (= Good luck!!|`|0l7pyBSTaa	ok, here's somthing really romantic that my boyfriend did for me and i almost died, it was so sweet.....he got me 11 real roses and 1 fake rose, put them all together, and put a note in them that read " i will love you till the last one dies" which the last one will never die, cause it's not real...............she will LOVE it........trust me.......|`|uQpAIkhwaa	yes. i loveee them.  a dozen or two of red roses.

kecpGboNaa	thats pretty low of him, but maybe he feels awkward cause you didnt answer right away. he probably doesnt want you to see how disappointed he would be if you said no, so hes trying to convince you your disposable. i think he likes you, especially since he was able to be honest with you and ask you out while he hasnt even talked to this other girl. i think he might just be bluffing so you dont see how much he likes you|`|3y0w1qIBaa	I think this guy was getting impatient of time passes by.  He has no right to do that.  My advice for you is to think out long if you want to go out with this guy or not.  Be aware that once you guys break up, you may have a hard time going back to friends.
CfUVG6IYaa	There are several possibilities... maybe he isn't ready for an actual relationship, maybe he is worried what his friends would say, and maybe he is just a jerk and using you. Also, maybe he is afraid you will reject him.    You could come right out and ask him... but you need to be prepared for any answer.     Whatever the truth is, it sounds like he is making you feel bad, so maybe you should just give up on this guy.    Good luck.|`|VsLSJ65Paa	Sounds like to me he is just playing around/online flirting with you..If he doesnt act the same way in any given public setting there might be two sides to what he is thinking

71VRvldJaa	You don't!  You stay out of it and show his relationship the same respect you'd want someone to show you if you were in a relationship with someone.    He might be hot but he obviously wasn't hot enough to keep you together the first time.  Forget about him!  There's a reason that people from your past don't make it to your future!      He's moved on....you need to do the same.

ww9Wx0mwaa	Top 10 points i like in a girl.,.,    1. I like if a girl is smart  (u ever heard there is a woman behind every successful man)    2. I like if a girl is brave enough to face anything  (now a days society is tough,.so girls have to be brave)    3. I like if a girl is so social and practical  (see now a days girl have to participate in many things in daily day life plus they shld be so practical in life)    4. I like if a girl is not materialistic and behind money.  (see money is unstable in all ways,.for example girls 70 percent mostly like settled guys with lots of money,.see fate is unstable wat if he suddenly got a loss and become a beggar after loving that girl anything may happen in life,.life is just a mystic cloud no one can guess wats next in modern life,.so girls shld see whether the guy is capable to earn good money or not,.she shld not go just because that guy is rich)    5. I like if a girl is so kind and organized.  (most of us guys wont be organized and we are sometimes short tempers most of us get anger so soon,.i prefer a girl shld be like a ice chill to cool down a guy in minutes and she shld be so organized to guide him in her way to make life well set)    6. I like if a girl rules home well.  (most of us guys we wont be a better home maker we cant raise children well with good care,.we cant take family decisions well,.we do things but wont be so accurate than a smart girls suggestion,.she can rule over all our homely issues even without our knowledge a homely cultured girl can take good decision at home)    7. I like a girl up to my level.  (see a bottle needs right cap,.a pair of sandals shld be in same size.,.,like that,.,a girl who is just equals u in most of her body parts will be the best match.,.,i am not trying to say u have to see her head to toe t verify.,.,i am telling u society has eyes.,.,see if u r wife is sexier than u.,.,they may comment like see this guy got a young sexy girl.,.,k.,.,u may think y i am specifically saying society.,.,is there we live.,.,we have to take this also in consideration.,.,because good will and reputation is must when it comes to life.,,see get a girl who is mostly equals u r height not exact.,.,i know getting a girl in exact is not possible try to get at laest 5 inch up and down cycle.,.,she shld be higher 5 inch within or lower 5 inch within.,.,and try to get a age just 3 to 4 up and down same as height.,.,and he weight waist line all almost near.,.,if u r 80 kilos don't marry a girl in 50 kilos.,.,marry a girl who is 65+.,this i call it as made for each other.,.,money religion and race is not included u can marry any race cultured and rich or poor that is unstable even race is unstable u cant say u r 10 gen grand pa is black or white.,.,lol.,.,so better forget abt money,.race.,.,religion.,.,language and customs)    8. I like a girl is not so sensitive and complex.  (very important possessiveness and playing jealous is so common when it comes to girls in 10 5 will be having jealous of others this is wrong,.comparison is the one i hate most of time.,.,see no one is eating u r food no one taste u like.,.,no one is living u r life than u.,.,so better don't compare and put jealous,.i have practically seen some girl say to there guys don't speak to u r co-worker see her appearance i heard she is a whore so she may spoil u.,.,this is really bad if u play rumor,.gossip and many more all because u want to survive and win,.)    9. I like girls to be so cultured.  (yes here is comes dressing.,.,i know we can dress in any kind.,.,but i feel it shld not spoil others mind and character.,.,see is a girl on micro mini will sure get many guys attention on road.,.,see my personal thought is girls are not amusement or entertainment stuff to get a guys attention sexually,. sex is minor part of life almost lasts 30 min to 1 hr a day and wont last after 60 and below 10,.all i feel is if a guy looks at a girl he shld feel to respect her according to her dress and behavior.,.,see girls do u want to be a guys material which he gets entertained and excited.,.,no u want guys love.,.,love and sex is different.,.,sexually attracted love will never last thats why most of the guys and girls if having ex-boys and ex-girls.,.,if u see it in a rite angle that love is included sex but not only sex.,.,u may never get u r heart broken.,so cultural dressing behavior and way of approach and appearance is so important.)    10. I like if a girl try to change me.

5RgN3Gt5aa	Both of you need to talk Girl. You're not alone in that relationship, that's why it's called relationship, isn't it? If it's so much bothering you, then, you really have to spend a quality time to talk with him. You need to be frank to him. Ask him everything that confuses you....in a right way then listen carefully, analyze everything. Listen to everything he'll say and not only to those that you wanna hear. After the conversation, relax and think about the conversation made then decide carefully if you need so. Don't worry, every mathematical problem has its solution and every misunderstanding can be understood......only if people TALKED.|`|yj3GT7jOaa	You are probably somewhere on his list.  He may not know yet.  Sooner or later he may find you. Do you want to stick around while he checks them off or advertise available?  Your call.|`|mJDqKejtaa	call him to talk to him|`|pdPX1Pt6aa	You should meat with on an off day talk to him but don't do it dureing your lunch hour.|`|AE0nK4Q3aa	sit him down and talk together. find a time wthere it's just you two. it all sounds fishy. if he avoids your questions, I think you should take him with. counseling. you need to be careful about this. ask him if he sees you in his future. can you see youself waking up every mornign with him next to you?  Ask him, find out whats wrong, and go from there.|`|NDGEzeCVaa	um yea, u need to say something, more like DO something. he's seems like a habitual liar. i cant do those. and don't be shocked if they're still fooling around. him and his ex. honestly, i think u should break it off. he doesn't seem to too much care about u. good luck girl. follow your heart|`|heOz7p89aa	wow....he said "for his house!" that's clearer than water!    dont waste your time with somebody who do dont want to spend it with you :S    get out of that relationship and be in a loving one
y4SUDnpaaa	Were you too harsh, no...............if anything you have not been harsh enough. Evidently you have come to your senses, everything you said in your third paragraph was just how you needed to handle it. Congratulations!|`|d20mM90uaa	NO!!! I DON' T THINK YOU WERE TO HARSH, IT HAS BEEN A YEAR, AND IN TIME YOU WILL BE OVER IT MORE.... JUST DON'T TALK TO HER, BUT DON'T GO OUT OF YOUR WAY TO BE A PECKER HEAD TO HER|`|7e8be8f471de4c60d8884f52a597ddc2aa	great job you did awesome.|`|veZLfnGFaa	No, you weren't.  You were hurt and have no reason to ever talk to her again.  :)|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	nah, she deserved it.|`|yhEDUN6qaa	Not at all. Don't go back and apologize or anything either. Shut that door and leave it shut|`|p02rE5Q8aa	Honestly I think you did the right thing by saying "I have nothing to say to you"...this was your way of getting your closure and walking away. If you stood there and talked to her you would've re-opened doors that should stay closed. Move on and find someone who loves you and only you!|`|AA11417059	You were a lot nicer than I would have been. I dont think you were too harsh on her. She knew what she was doing when she did it, and she knew it was wrong. F*** the B****|`|8kh2jshLaa	nope ,your doing great|`|lYE34CVTaa	No. She is your EX for a reason. There is no need to be "friendly". All that will do it bring up old times and old feeling, probably the good ones at first. You will get pulled in before you know it and end up getting hurt again. The best thing to do is keep the past in the past.     Good luck.|`|qXCSWQpdaa	Hell no!    Now keep it up!|`|5NKa5Y8laa	No you were not too harsh, you were just letting her know that you are not taking any more of her crap and are over her.|`|VmH7e0r7aa	I don't think you were. You don't owe her anything after what she put you through. Saying to her that you don't have any words for her is a lot more mature than going off on her about what she put you through. I think you did the right thing. You sound like a genuinely nice guy. I hope you find a lady that will treat you like you deserve to be treated!|`|besndn9laa	No, because she does not deserve you as a friend|`|HH6zNHSuaa	No, why do yo need tobe nice to soemone who obviously doenst care about your wellbeing.   Dont think about it too much. You cant let her back in.  You have to be a man, suck it up, and look forward and never back. It will take time to get over her. But dont be weak, she will walk over you again.
XVygEWLcaa	i think after a long drawn-out relationship (especially if it didnt end well at all) then u should just lay low for a while. maybe even play the field.|`|AB3D5gIJaa	well if u dont like the person dont tell them u do kuz then it's just going to be a very complicated thing kuz u no u dont like them but they will think u do. And if u reall like sum1 just to be in a relationship it"s not a good thing kuz they might have feeling 4 u but then u won't feel the same way bak and dont make urself seem desprate by calling him like 24/7 just like 1 or 2 times but not as much let them call u try to enjoy the time ur not talking to that person be free not cooped up waitng 4 them to call or cslling them waitting 4 them to answer ur calls.|`|fv2GAAdPaa	well i am a girl but :    I would NEVER tell sum1 i liked them if i didnt(i dont paly with ppls emotions)    If i now got out of a relationship i woud take it easy at first but then after i healed i would be back out on the market, providing that i didnt wanna rmeain single for any longer.|`|Q8amh0rUaa	no|`|maE2pBEdaa	I would take it slow then start dating again.|`|wscyjkPAaa	No, I wouldn't tell someone I like them if I didn't.    If I really liked someone but just got out of a long relationship, I would not call that person often.  The reason is, I may have some baggage that I need to get over from the last relationship.  I would not jump into a new relationship until all my personal issues are resolved.|`|cxxbRRl6aa	no don't do that, we might be ***** but we got feelings too.|`|V0uzsE6kaa	I think everyone should take some time to themselves after coming out of a long relationship.  There's usually a lot of inner searching you have to do in order to resolve things in your brain and I feel that anyone who jumps into another relationship right away is making it harder on themselves.  Not so much "enjoy the single life," but figure out what you want before you go searching again.|`|RvShEWESaa	I have told girls I like them or love them,  just to get some ***.     At first I can seem very sincere, and call her up all the time, make jokes.    Right after the sex, it's like bye *****, see you never.
AdIrjmV7aa	OMG, you only like him becauue you don't have anyone else.  Stop using people.
c3c4f6b1cdb5f490e1caf3ca26fd885aaa	Seeing as you both are having so muc fun together, it'll be sad if you tell him and he doesn't feel the same way, 'cause that'll just make things awkward. Trust me, you'll regret it then.   SO take it slow, see how things pan out, don't rush into anything and enjoy his company.  Its probably just a crush that'll go away or maybe the feeling's exciting 'cause you haven't really connected with a boy this much before.  Sort Of like Jacob&Bella..Meant To Be Friends, nothing more, nothing less.   :)|`|5DRmXCEeaa	u can wait to see if he might feel the same way.. like u should ignore him for a lil while and see if he misses u or something, then if u feel like he might possibly see u as someone he wants to be with, then u should talk to him about it and go from there... sex might be involved later down the line so be prepared to live ur life and experience everything, if anything.  good luck to u..  yy|`|r4gRsr4Baa	I think that first you should start to talk to him during school. If you see him in the hallways, just wave and say hi. Thats the first step. And after a while, you should just start to make conversations with him when you see him. Then you need to tell him how you feel. Chances are that he likes you back!    -Courtney|`|yQHyu69taa	just tell him how u feel nd go from there|`|q9t321ttaa	I'm kinda in the same situation. But we being the girls, have to wait for the guy to make the first move.|`|qpAYU8Knaa	First requirement of being a gf-bf is that you have to be good friends. You have already achieved that stage. May be he feels just like you do but is afraid to tell it to you for the fear of losing your friendship. Since you are his friend then you must know if he has a gf or if he is interested in anyone, things like that. If you don't know then casually ask him. If he is not attached then tell him about your feelings for him. You will not be disappointed. Good luck.|`|b0cf194d51a7889f74b6caa215c4087daa	you could try flirting with him he will get the message!  :)|`|08a48zP9aa	Try being more forward or try to hang out just the two of you alone. That way you guys can spend time one on one. That way he will know what it's like to be alone with you and get on a more personal level instead of plain old MSN!    Please help with my does he miss me questions thanks =)
V7grzObHaa	Wow!  That is a very interesting question.  Well scripturally speaking there is only one valid ground for divorce that would free one to remarry and that is fornication (adultery) committed by one of the mates, with the innocent mate having the decision to scripturally and legally terminate the marriage, Matthew 19:9 says "9?I say to YOU that whoever divorces his wife, except on the ground of fornication, and marries another commits adultery.  The marriage would be binding scripturally because when you initially got married you were male and female and God's word, the Bible, states at Matthew 19: 4-6 reads " 4?In reply he said: Did YOU not read that he who created them from [the] beginning made them male and female 5?and said, For this reason a man will leave his father and his mother and will stick to his wife, and the two will be one flesh? 6?So that they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore, what God has yoked together let no man put apart.   So, it would appear that even though one makes the decision to have a sex change, according to the scriptures, that would not in itself provide a valid basis for procurring a divorce that would be recognized scripturally in order to free the innocent mate (the one who did not undergo the sex change)     However, if your spouse decided to have a sex change, that may be a valid reason for you to seek out a legal separation or in some states a legal divorce if one felt that their spiritual life was in danger, due to the gross and immoral behavior of the one spouse.|`|ByUS0k8waa	Yes they are still married. You took those vowels as man and wife. In God's eyes the person having a sex change will always be the sex that God made them to begin with.|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	Religious vows include the line, "until death do you part," so of course they're still married.  There is no clause in marriage for excluding sex change.|`|veZLfnGFaa	I would think they would still be married unless the person that had the sex change legally changed their name.  Wouldn't it be easier to just get a divorce before the sex change?  I would think so. :)|`|AA11460234	Yes.    So go ahead and get the operation sweetheart.|`|4boTYkt7aa	It depends on if the person is sexually active with someone outside the marriage.If the other person is able to accept that kind of change,it is alright.I personally could not feel like God would be alright with this kind of thing because He says that when a man and woman are married,they become one person.So it should not be something they change if their spouse is against it.You should go to a Church of Christ and talk to an Elder about this.|`|3g1ZgTe4aa	Yes, their marriage is still legal. They both signed the papers. It is a reason to get a divorce. That is a sad situation.|`|GTvyBTGyaa	They are married in the eyes of the law but one would probably want a divorce. Weird question.|`|glR5KYPuaa	They are still married but I believe you can get the marriage anulled under the false pretense that they married you knowing they were of a different persuasion. Hope this helps.|`|8IpV1Br8aa	Yes they are still married. Depending on where you live the law allows same sex marriage so maybe a little amendment would have to be done to the Marriage Certificate but yes they are still married.|`|DDmSV51caa	Not if the person undergoing the sex-change dies during the operation. Hey, it can happen.|`|de641317a0696a8d53df9d1538305a2baa	Okay, Spiritually speaking (I'm a Catholic), if one person in the marriage has a sex change, then that person must have, for a very long time, been uncomfortable being the sex that they were.  If that person didn't feel comfortable being the sex they were before and during the marriage, then the marriage was based under false pretenses, as it were.  The marriage, in the Catholic Church's eyes, not a sacramental marriage, not binding.  The other spouse has grounds for both a divorce and an annulment.  I hope this helps you.
iqrXIQctaa	First and Foremost, your virginity is a big deal sweety. Take it from me, once you lose that you will never get it back and honestly Men will respect you more because you want to wait. At least the good guys will.     If you are going to go through with this, make sure you wear protection. Not only because you don't want to get pregnant but you also don't want to get any STD's. You cant trust anyone anymore and there are a ton of things you can catch that could ruin your life all because of one stupid mistake.     Secondly, you don't have experience and that will make it hard for you to satisfy him. I honestly think if this guy isn't your boyfriend he may be using you for sex because he knows your are inexperienced.     Be careful, and Good Luck =]|`|qCLWNLCIaa	If you're more concerned about his pleasure than your own for the first time, you're probably not doing it for the right reasons. It's much harder for a girl to get off than a guy. If he's as young as you, a naked boob would probably do the job. Whether he's a virgin or not won't matter.  First thing first is to get your priorities straight. For him to have a really good time, YOU need to be having a good time. Having sex to satisfy him only is a waste of your time. And your virginity.   Besides, it's going to hurt very, very badly, especially if you're not totally comfortable. His satisfaction will be the last thing on your mind.|`|a2b21f2cee1471018ba8eafddb953922aa	i personally dont think ur ready for sex. emotionally and physically. how old are you? u shouls probably wait til u finf the right guy. he isnt the one for u if hes telling u he wants to be "satisfied". if he was the one he would wait until ur ready. and when ur ready he would be telling u thats he going to take care of you and that u shouldnt worry.      and if u still do it pleasse use a condom. and make sure it doesnt break.|`|uQpAIkhwaa	ha. he should be doing the work since its your first time.   USE A CONDOM. i cant stress it enough.     good luck. && Have FUN! (:|`|ubdEwzcoaa	Considering that it's your first time he needs to do all the work.   GOOD LUCK IT HURTS LIKE HELL.!!!!|`|dLptroBYaa	no, use a condom. how old are you? under 18. do not do it!    USE A CONDOM!|`|GTvyBTGyaa	Any decent guy would want to satisfy you. how do you know he's been with other girls he might be all talk. Are you 2 boyfriend/girlfriend do you really want to have sex. or is he pushing it on you.|`|AA10232348	Don't do it! I'm gonna go tell your mother! "MAMA, (your name) is doing something she shouldn't be doing!" Yeah, that'll teach you not to do things you shouldn't be doing!|`|GYpyTsJQaa	If you're asking this.  You should not be having sex.|`|ZdqCE5Pqaa	go NO CONDOM, lol|`|pRHHhNzkaa	just go with the flow, using forplay as a starter. lyback andlet him do all the work.    just tell him that your unsure :) he will understand.      all the best and be safe!|`|AE0nK4Q3aa	dude, wait untill marrage. don't throw your virginity away, you'll never get it back! please wait. if you need to 'satisfy' him, he probobly will just have sex, then dump you. don't fall for that. if he makes you feel like you need to give him something, don't take any dratic steps! PLEASE be careful! your virginity is a precious thing that can't be restored once it's lost!|`|r0M7gVP7aa	DON'T DO IT! Wait until your married please! You'll end up so hurt in the end.

Don't bring it up again. If he brings it up it's ok though.|`|EjhbmBzAaa	right doe i dk doe|`|gHLQMjcdaa	if that's what you really want to say then send it.|`|cQk8usneaa	Premarital sex is bad.

PDcnXgE6aa	Interesting q    I think boys have sex in there mind round the clock.....but this is not true for girls ..........Girls don't think too much about sex but if sex has been triggered in mind, then desire of sex is very high.     When girls are aroused their sexual desire is 16 times compare to boys  as per written in kamsutra|`|AA12346188	Girl - till she becomes a mother.|`|r2EBoqyiaa	both men and women have the same sexual feeling a mans isn't higher nor a woman to a man|`|FdY5qFE7aa	Girls...|`|5RlDSIeIaa	This cannot be blamed to one gender. Both of them have the same feeling. But who wants more? This depends whose chemicals in the body triggers first. If boy's chemical or estrogens triggers first then he will do sexual act like kissing on lips, pressing breast and even the hand is also not sparred. If the girls brain react first then she will kiss or pull or even touch the genetials. There is no any loving matter either to gender. But to trigger first three thinsg is must. Trust , Emotions and  space. I think this is enough to satisfy your answer|`|kyUiaDgyaa	You know, I recall when was young in my late teens early 20's I had sex on the brain 24/7, I was constantly obsessed with it, I constantly wondered was I going to get lucky and "get me some". But through the years as I got much older, I soon came to realize that it is not really that important to have sex on a 24 hr 7 days a week basis and now that I,m in my late 40's the way I view it now a days  If I get get lucky ok hooray for me but I,m not going to jump for joy like a complete idiot, and If I don't, Oh well, the bottom line is I've already done had my fair share of sex|`|z6lR0yk8aa	hi........bro girl|`|jtvhleWuaa	a girl|`|sQpoy4kfaa	hi buddy!  i like your question.i mean itz askful.  my answer is a girl would like to have more if relation is too strong that there is no question of being shy.  if itz for first time boy would love to have more sex.but according to your question,girl loves to ahve more sex.thank u.  i hope my answer is good enough|`|0cc246155e514fec3bbc8851221cfaf5aa	girl|`|2724e8c32a9de71dca3f16697d9d6ebbaa	I think it all depends on the individual person and not the gender.  For instance, one of my exes wanted sex all the time 24/ 7, and my current significant other is just fine with once or twice a week.  It had nothing to do with their age....the ex was and is older.  Just individual preferences.  And by the way, I am the girl, and I am wired for the middle of the two.
1QbFtEpraa	you can't make anyone like you but i really liked this girl for a year and a half she was with other guys on and off i just stayed a good friend and waited for her to come around eventually she did and we dated fo about 11 months when we broke up cause she started liking another guy and i'm ok with that cause i want her to be happy.this was about a month ago and we r still good friends, just be his friend don't seem desperate but make sure he knows that you want him if it's meant to be it will be if not it won't just give it some time if he likes you he will let you know.also you like him as much as you say you do be happy that he is happy i know its hard cause i'm going throught it now but that will also make him like you more cause it will let him know you care if you have any questions e-mail me.|`|kDshEkXraa	Well you cant force anyone to do anything.

fMxVDps3aa	In my situation they looked at both incomes. If one or the other were to make a significant amount more then that determines it. If he makes more I get more.

Sometimes when people are in a unhealthy relationship or just broke up with someone they had an unhealthy relationship with and can't seem to get over them then yes, they can resist that. There's no way at all they are in love with that person. They just choose to be stubborn and refuse to let that person go. It doesn't take much mental or emotional power, people just need to stop being over emotional babies.    Lovers come and go, there are plenty of fish in the sea.|`|mOi6aKtraa	no love is blind you cant help who you fall in love with it that person makes you happy then forget about what everyone thinks
lIpjuMTHaa	Write him a really sweet love letter that he can read over and over. Six months is a long time and its hard to be away from a loved one for that long. Put something silly in there that you guys got together or tickets to a movie you went to. Put a little sample of the perfume you wear, I did that for my boyfriend when he went away for a month and he would spray it on the sheets so he felt like I was with him. Boys are a lot more sensitive and romantic than they want us to believe. Just make it a fun thing to look at when he feels down about you being gone.|`|029d970e89f49628d1a27a4f7084f48faa	Record yourself telling him how much you love him, so he doesn't have to call you to hear your voice. Make sure all your new contact info is in there so he can easily reach you (or maybe send you a nice love letter). You could also help him out by giving him calling cards, stamps, stationery and envelopes, so he has no choice but to put pen to paper! Put items in there that will make him laugh and think of you. Only you know what those items are.|`|uVH046Fjaa	My shoe. So when he looks inside he can think about how his girlfriend went on yahooanswers to ask a dumb question.|`|Xf93fRTTaa	Write notes for him to read on specific dates. Put them in cute little envelopes (you can get them for free at the floral department of any supermarket) and write the date that he should read it on.     Pick special dates. Holidays. Birthdays. You could write "for a rainy day" on a few of them and he could just read them when he's feeling down.     I think that would be sweet. Also, go to a department store make up counter and spray one of the little frangrance sample cards with whatever perfume you wear. Those tend to hold the smell longer than other materials.|`|oSdQP8mJaa	Numbers of other girls (make it easier for him) lol|`|fc964df50bc3ae84b97937ecb982821baa	By CD, do you mean like a mixtape kinda CD with your fav songs?     Hmm...other ideas...a naughty picture of you (so he thinks of you when he gets those urges haha) and panties are both fun ideas.Something sprayed with your favorite perfume. Something from a memorable date you went on (menu, program business card, whatever). Other fun/cute pictures of you. A love note (a new one). Thats all I got for now...|`|AE0nK4Q3aa	well, not panties : P,  maybe write down some times that made you both laugh. deffinatly pictures, make a cd of your favorite songs. perhaps start making a journal just for him that you write about him in. make a few quizes for him to fill out about you, and you him. a few of your favorite things to do togeather, and a movie you both like.|`|EJKhLW2Baa	anything relating to you.

h4UzjZVnaa	Yes, it's very wrong!|`|aV3bFchtaa	Based on the phraseology, I would say no, as well as definitely get it accomplished, soon. Also, try a Doc's office rather than "behind your wife's back".|`|UgcPxd4maa	YES|`|ybt605Qfaa	No. Or do anything at all, actually.|`|KaAXJJo8aa	very wrong...|`|AA12041870	It is if she is under the assumption that you both are trying to have a baby.  Tell her the truth about how you feel.  The truth will set you free.|`|bfc067ab537555ada57edd464a8dfb97aa	If your married your doctor is going to ask you to bring your wife into the situation.  Marriage makes her privy to something this important.|`|K6KeN7sgaa	YES.|`|bc80b085beb98b92a6819181843ddbbbaa	Yes, and what how exactly would you pull that off anyway?  "  No honey, I'm just holding this ice pack to my balls for fun"|`|8txWayVnaa	Yes.  In some states, when a married woman wants to get a tubiligation (commonly referred to as "getting her tubes tied"), she has to get her husband's written consent.     Morally, it's wrong to get it done behind your wife's back.  Depending upon the state in which you live, it could be illegal as well.|`|v0GwTTsVaa	As a married man that is not a choice you make on your own.  When it comes to fertility a married couple are in it together.  You need to discuss your concerns with your wife.  Tell her you want to get a vasectomy and see what she has to say about it.  If you already have children she probably won't mind.  It's a lot easier for a man to get one than it is for a woman.    My hubby is planning on getting one in the next 6 months or so.  But we have discussed it as a married couple.  And even though I feel our family is complete....I would feel betrayed and very let down if my husband made this decision with out me.|`|fQgbBx7caa	If she wanted kids before you got married, you agreed and this conversation should have came up before you said "I do", now you are springing a vasectomy on her, you guys are headed for divorce court, happened to a few people I know.  I do think you are wise to get a vasectomy knowing you do not want kids though, its to bad it turned out this way, unless she does not want kids.  Even if she says she does not want kids, I would go ahead with the vas.....so there are no problems in the future, I have seen a few divorces over that one too, the woman says she does not want kids, dont worry about the vas, then she gets pregnant.  I would take care of this asap.|`|4boTYkt7aa	Yes,because when you are married,you and her become one.That is not something small,it should be her decision also.I think you have a reason why you want this,that you don't want her to know about.The thing that comes to mind is another woman.|`|DMhAPurkaa	This is a very interesting query.  Women can have an abortion without anyone knowing   or consenting.  The doctor doing the vas will require the wife s signature  You will both go in for a consult.  She will need to sign papers of acknowledgment .    If you were not married, the procedures for the procedure would be different.    Married women can have an abortion without consent , married or unmarried.    However...  the woman can still have children after the procedure.  So these two are different in this way.    Sidebar-  the term behind her back denotes you have turned away from her  the two become one thing in your vows is shattered in these words  remember the word  Together    This question denotes tearing away from her for a time and returning later after you had done something alone and without her    You both have wants needs desires  My hope is your hearts can open TOWARDS each other   not away from each other  and come to an agreement   some kind of give and take   cooperation|`|OHydEvTCaa	yes!|`|TPhIWWniaa	Yes! why are you hesitant to tell her?|`|mJbzDhQKaa	yes big time she should know.|`|o1pXRFtUaa	yes! It's not that its "wrong" its just rude and it seems like your not thinking about anyone but yourself.|`|uKFgRHeqaa	uh yeah  thats something she would wanna know     why dont you wanna tell her?  if your hesitant to let her know maybe you shouldnt.|`|lyNgNpRgaa	No, it's your body, do what you want to it.  Just like a woman can have an abortion even if the guy wants the kid, it ain't none of her business.    Thumbs down commencing in 3...2...1...|`|6cfb6cd3197d1e471020aecf96fc5902aa	My opinion I guess would be, If you want to have this done that badly your wife will understand.  Sit down and talk to her and I am sure it will be fine.  However if you dont tell her and she finds out shes going to be severely angry, and you need two days or so to recover so unless you have a hideout..goodluck|`|ih8PG93Laa	Yes! You agreed to tell her everything when you said i do if you were a single man, it wouldn't be as bad because you would have no obligation to tell her anything, but it's not just your now, since your married she has a decision too. What if your wife decided on her own to adopt a child? It would be the same thing. No offence, just my opinion.|`|tvK1xjzkaa	Well is it ok for your wife to go and get laid by someone else behind your back...I swear men think they have some power that they can have a vasectomy and keep their woman from having children. Seriously grow up if you don't want kids tell your wife and get the vasectomy don't hind in a corner like a little *****....grow up..|`|gTWgbpNFaa	the surgeons will need to see you both together if you are married they don't perform these ops willy nilly but with considerable thought & consultation.|`|TAufQoc7aa	yeah its pretty much wrong|`|QcJqmE9uaa	No, not at all. It is your body.|`|AA11063878	my first question is...Why? why would you need to do it behind her back? and Yes it would be wrong..think about it..what if she went and had a hysterectomy without you knowing it?|`|d36f7c4fb8b8952c08aa3139dc2554b9aa	I think it would be yes.  You may not know for sure if she still has a desire to have children.  I believe it is something that should definitely be talked about.|`|yd2SP7d6aa	Yes it would be wrong of you. Ultimately it is your body / decision to become sterile but the outcome affects your wife (no different than if she went behind your back and got an abortion).   So if you claim to "love' your wife (love is not selfish) than you need to be truthful / honest when undertaking an action that will profoundly affect her.      BTW, I know of no law that requires a wife's consent.  Doctor's may (or may not) request a wife to be present during the consult but its a common mistake to believe its a requirement.  I just recently contacted a Doctor myself and when I asked if I need to bring my wife (they never mentioned it) they said "only if she has questions and you want to include her".  I was also under the mistake impression she HAD to be there and be notified (nope).|`|3g1ZgTe4aa	Yes, that is a major decision, and they need to be decided together. Please talk to her, and do not go behind her back.
WMR8hVlfaa	You should get a nice suit - jacket, pants, a couple of nice shirts to wear underneath. Rotate that with some simple pieces, such as dressy sweaters, knee-length skirts, dress pants, etc. Stick to black, navy blue, khaki, white and solid colours. If you do any pattern make sure it's something eye-pleasing -- pinstripes are nice.     Nothing too dressy, but try to stay clean-cut.|`|0jUGSaZPaa	Dresses and skirts just above the knee will work, paired with cute little pumps...

It is associated with sexual afterglow and is distinguished from dirty talk which usually forms part of foreplay.    The content of pillow talk typically includes the sexual act itself, expressions of affection and appreciation, playful humor, casual anecdotes, and stories from childhood. A couple's pillow talk session is often used as a plot device in works of fiction and drama, such as movies and television. It offers a convenient setting for a couple to discuss relevant plot events or reveal new information to each other.    It also can consist of two or more friends talking late at night. The "pillow talking" generally takes place at night and involves talk of romantic interests. The friends do not have to be in the same bed, although this does happen occasionally.
Ccs9LeIEaa	i dont know your age or anything about you, so ill try to help though it may be generic info.     stop looking for a man, the number one thing to do when you are looking.    focus on some things you like to do, be it spirituality, politics, reading, whatever. thennnnn... find a group (ohhh also, sports fan clubs are good places to meet men, even if all you know about the team is that a particular player is hot, hot, hot!) and go to a few meetings or get togethers. it gives you a convo starter and it takes the pressure off bc its low key, no pressure.|`|ACVKajUIaa	try eBay|`|DWFMM23Caa	well you can start by not looking like you want one... men can sense that a mile of.  be yourself and when ur not looking it will just happen.  also the nicest and most attractive thing about anyone is their charisma, if your laughing, smiling, being friendly people will want to be near you.  bitchiness ain't s*xy or attractive and boys hate that.  in short, be you.|`|Y2bfm2vUaa	Wait for the right guy to come around and don't seem to desperate just be yourself and if you like him then just take a chance and ask him out you've got nothing to lose!

If you are looking for someone to take care of you , move back in with mom.  If you are looking for sex, look around you - its not hard to find.  If you are looking for money, - get a job.  If you are looking for companionship - get a dog.  If you want to be free - stay away from all of the above.

You only get what they choose to give.|`|Rx6p8Cvfaa	men stand to gain more by getting married then women do.  in most households now both people work, but it is the woman who comes home and does the chores, cooking, child rearing..etc.  men will pretty much still continue on the way they were, going out with friends, being secretive, lusting over other women...and then wonder why women end up leaving, or are too tired for sex anymore.  Women by nature are more devoted, caring, and open about feelings...while men do what they want to do and then deal with the hurt they cause afterwards...in most cases if a woman feels loved and cared for and like she is trusted enough to have feelings shared with her, she won't stray, but a man will stray if a woman has big enough boobs almost every time...Yes, there are benefits to a man from getting married, then when you guys eff it up, the woman benefits from the divorce. So the question should be, "Men, when you have finally spent years doing what you wanted and your wife finally tires of it and walks out on you, will you finally see what you gained from your marriage, only after it is too late?"    and then we women will gain from the divorce.  that's when marriage has no benefits to a man...when it ends.|`|omfSAeBjaa	well aside from the "kid" issue (i'm old fashioned that way) i'm trying to think how marriage is more beneficial to the man than the woman.      if the woman makes significantly more money then maybe for that guy it makes sense.  otherwise, i dont see it.  women USUALLY get more from the marriage than men do.      one answer can be regular sex but for most husbands that even passes with time.  the single guy on the other hand, if he plays his cards right, ends up with way more PLUS the variety.      forget what the wives say - they found their niche and wont give it up.|`|4vUgUfvNaa	yes. BTW I am a guy. I am on my girlfriends account with her permission. there are benifets to getting married.  1. someone that you know is there for you  2.somebody to make you feel better  3. somebody to wake up and go to bed with  4. someone to cure you when you are sick  5.someone that yo love that loves you
AA11330914	Hey. This situation definitely really sucks. i was in a similar situation to you before and i know how annoying it gets. With me i was dating a guy who ex still liked him.. A LOT.. and she was always coming up to him and trying to get him back. i told her off all the time too and said many things. she emailed him all the time but i fixed that. Eventually we broke up cuz he cheated on me with her and claimed he did it because he was confused but he loved me and wanted me. b u ll s h it right?! but anyways. no prep can ignore a scene guy. they are just naturally have se% appeal to preppy girls. i can say this because again, experience. i have been scene and many other things but i reverted to my first style. prep. and i cannot resist a scene guy. EVER. i dated a scene guy 4 years older than me, one 8 months younger, and others are just plain sexy and its hard not to stare sometimes even though i am engaged and VERY happy with the love of my life. lol but she will probably just move on. If he gave her move hints that she should. some people, especially typical preps, are oblivious. sorry to anyone offended by that but i am a prep so im allowed to say it. the best things to do, would probably be get your boyfriend to block her from his email account. its easy to do and then she would not be able to email him those awful emails anymore. and another thing is play along with the rumours. then be like are you people THAT stupid? u know me. do u think i would be like that?.. i did that when that b i t ch who tried to get my ex told people i was a $l u t and pregnant.. 6 different times... it worked. it makes people realize how stupid it is. Plus, don't let the girl see it bothers you. She might stop liking him but still pretend just to pi $$ you off. When she makes a scene just do something else, like if she is like so what i like him get over it and shouts it in the hall, stop someone walking by and say oh sorry to bother you but did you hear? she likes him isn't that just great?.. and when she's flirting with him, keep your arms wrapped around him. it shows him you care and that it bothers you but shows her that you aren't going to give him up. oooorrr even to just pi $$ her off, when she walks by, grab his a s s or do something to make him laugh. Another thing you could do is when she is there flirting with him literally in your face, hook your index finger under his chin and turn his face so he is looking at you then kiss him with everything you have and when u stop, look him in the eye and say i love you baby. when he says it back she'll get the hint a bit more and see how happy you two are, and get jealous(just a bonus). Other things he could do would be talk to her. he needs to say something like, i know you like me but im dating brooklyn. i really like her and i dont like the things you are doing. it doesnt make me want to like you because i dont like you. infact it makes me dislike you more because it shows that you are cruel to others to get whatever it is you want. please leave us alone and stop spreading rumors. and if she doesn't stop. then he needs to go up to her and say something else like okay you know what? you are getting on my nerves and are acting in a way that is very offensive. you should be the one known as a slut because that is how u are acting. i don't like you. i never will. f u c k off.    i really hope this helps. i am sorry its a bit long :S   it really sucks you are in this kind of position. no one deserves to be called a s l u t.     hopefully she stops. if i knew you or you were close to where i am, i woulda taught her not to say **** about you. it really p i $$es me off when people talk crap about others.. or kicked her teeth in :]    goodluck|`|NTUr0t3haa	Don't let her ruin anything. You're allowing it by showing her all the power she has. Instead, act as though she doesn't exist and has no power whatsoever.    This is your boyfriend's job, not yours. He needs to deflect her and reject her firmly. Unfortunately, he's probably flattered by her attention. Out of respect, he should shove that aside and firmly reject her.|`|Dhsyroekaa	all you can do is tell your BF that he needs to tell her to stop writting him and to leave you guys alone. If you say anything to her he may take her side. So get him to tell her to f off  good luck!!|`|ycNt74yyaa	I recommend paragraph breaks, spell check, and maybe sprinkle in some capitalization.|`|bWcJqSSbaa	ewww i would slap that preppy hoe!  did you talk to your boyfreind about it?  and i would have done something to her that would make her stop like writeing e-mails on here or something like that!|`|x3mFm4exaa	You are young its high school its not going to last any way so move on and live your life be free....

Your question really needs to be rewritten with actual words that are spelled out correctly.  If you have written anything to he and you wrote to her the same way you did in the question here, she probably doesn't want to talk to you because she thinks you are a complete moron.    If she has rejected you it is better just to move on and try a relationship with someone else, and in some cases (this applies to you), it is better for some people to remain single.
Acwau1Esaa	Make him dress like frodo|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	I was married to a man that was 4 inches shorter than me, it was not because of this that I divorced him.  Be careful he does not suffer with little man syndrome.|`|a2b21f2cee1471018ba8eafddb953922aa	ha its cool! lol i like this gut who is like a little shorter than me. we are both skinny. but idk we are just friends with benefits. nothing more sadly :( but him being shorter doesnt bother me or him so yeah.|`|QGSaSo6Jaa	men generally prefer smaller women than themselves, though for some people this isn't a problem.  or no tall women would have partners.|`|u7zmUivHaa	its better to be a skinny girl than a fatty boombatty and its better to be a fat boy than a really skinny boy|`|j3DqJ2BBaa	it doesnt matter as long as you like eachother. but i think its just a bit weird and prefer the boy to be taller haha lol|`|grAU3MJcaa	What matters is how the two of you feel about it, not what anyone thinks.    If the relationship isn't purely physical, then it should not matter.|`|n05GDUcUaa	if you like each other it doesn't matter :)|`|2c7869fbf2bfda8e590501ddb5545f2caa	It doesnt matter at all.

I'm 5"8 and dated a guy who was about 5"5 and it was fine. As long as you both don't have a issue with it I don't see why it should be a problem.     It's all relative when you lying down anyway ; )|`|f64elzDQaa	I don't think it matters :)|`|KJrDxAR8aa	No it's fine.  Some guys actually like taller girls more than short ones.|`|MzP52FsBaa	If you like/love each other nothing should matter.

lIpjuMTHaa	No no no. My boyfriend keeps it trimmed and neat and thats fine. But when its completely gone it just looks silly, like the boys been watching too many porn videos. The girls are the ones who should keep waxed or shaved.     On the other hand, every girl is different, just keep it the way you are comfortable having it. If you feel self concious with it then get rid of it.|`|lYjweuZmaa	No.|`|H2RibkFlaa	yur a wierd kidd....  why would yu do that   thats like all sick|`|q3cbuc3Eaa	ewe! that's just wrong. i like the all natural!|`|PEbFQtL6aa	No, Its awkward.

AWKWARD!|`|RoEyFm5yaa	NO|`|mbv2jLqDaa	Waxing isn't really necessary.  I wouldn't expect my guy to go through all of that pain for that.

But keep it trimmed neat and tidy please!!|`|ysexlf9baa	shavings better wax is silly but smooth. tuf 1|`|3lIAjgROaa	um i think if you want to you should  but i dont really care|`|2rq2v8weaa	Noo not waxing.. Im sure that would be extremely painful for a guy. lol. Just shaving and a little trim here & there and us girls will be just fine. =)|`|mJZ5tBXsaa	Personally, no I think that is weird. but other girls my feel diff. about that but, i asked my friend about what she thought and she didnt think that was cool.

AA11289793	Wow you don't have very many decent people around you, no offense intended. Well I know it might be hard but you have got to forget him becuase he obviously didn't like you that much if he is willing to go out with you friend at the drop of a hat, and also the fact that he asked his sister to brake up with you just shows that he isn't even man enough to face the consequences for his actions.    Also I would try not to associate yourself with your friend if she is willing to ask your boyfriend out while you were dating, even though she asked you first it just shows that she doesn't really have any morals. When I was reading this I almost didn't believe it because it sounds so bad....    I hope you can move on easily....|`|f2e71f6Gaa	look he seriously isn't someone that you want in your life. he sounds like a really bad guy if he is gettin his sister to break up with you thats really bad. i know it does take time to get over your ex but trust me give it time you will get over him.|`|H2RibkFlaa	go balls n tell him   maybe he mite feel the same =/|`|25VsqqA4aa	Well, you don't have to be sticky "sorry for that word" but yeah    you should have a big confidence and let it go, skip him and wait for the one who'll deserve you little cup-cake :)
YtSGbYqEaa	i know what your going through but your sisters see something you don't trust me i was like that with my sis and her bf turns out he was a real butt and a liar my sister also felt that way about my old bf she was right maybe you should listen to them maybe they r right|`|PlVh12fpaa	what did he do to you in the past?|`|2vyYsSMkaa	DO IT! DO IT! forget your sisters they will always be there! live for the moment! and my advice to your sisters is live and let live!
eO4y3m1maa	Shouldnt you have figured this out before you got married????    Marriage counseling is needed!|`|kEtYEmhqaa	Marriage counseling|`|T5ztIAZbaa	You're always going to have arguements, but that sounds a little bit excessive.      One thing I've learned is that for the most part, your wife will be a reflection of the way that you treat her.  What I mean by that is, if you start trying with everything you have to compromise or work out problems before they get to the shouting stage, and in every situation ask "What does she need from me here?"   Then go on and fulfill the need that she put forth.      Just try to be the best you can be, and when she sees that, she will want to be the same to you.     Trust me on this, I went through the same thing, and this worked perfectly!|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	Women are built dirrently then men. We fell picked onwhen we are yelled at, I hate whne my hubby yells and i say the same thing. It is better if you can work it out without being mean and hateful or yelling. I also believe that a household should be equal. If my husband works full time i clean the house do the laundry and whatnot but he still has to pick up after himself because i am not a maid. And the same goes vice versa. Do not treat her or ask her t odo somethign yo uaer not willing to do yourself.|`|4boTYkt7aa	One thing that I can tell you is,watch what you say in anger because you can't unscramble that egg.It sounds like you need to sit down together and talk when neither of you are mad.Plan a date with her and let her see that you are wanting to really know how to fix what ever is wrong.You would not believe how much easier it is to reach each other if you truly meet in the middle.Make sure,on that date,that you take her some where nice and romantic.Put your whole heart into it.Good luck.|`|Bc4udMhUaa	Okay, I hate saying this but I truly believe it. I hate saying this because people react negatively when they hear it.    I truly believe most men are engraved with the need to protect. The need to feel needed, to feel like a big strong man. That's okay. Doesn't mean you have to be a brute or anything. I know sometimes women treat their husbands like their children.    I would try to set some ground rules on fighting.  nothing physical  no name calling  and let the past lie unspoken  If you wife is reasonable she should agree to this.    Try your best to go to bed happy. To make ammends before going to bed. Even if it means maybe putting your feelings aside to make her happy.    To change things I would try treating her as a beautiful woman. Romantic stuff, flowers, take care of the kids so she can get a pedicure, massage gift certificate. Take her out to do things she wants to.  Then maybe try suggesting to take some of home burdens. Don't make it seem like you should be doing this because you're the man, but more to get some weight off her shoulders, that sort of thing.    I think if you really work at. Try your hardest not to fight.Talk to a buddy or family member if you need to unload so you can be as calm as possible with her. Try to understand what she is saying instead of getting defensive. Agree with her even when you realize fault. Treat her like a woman wants to be treated she will start treating you like the man of the house.    I would guess if she's that bitter she is probably thinking she does too much around the house and you don't contribute enough or act childish. I know it really sucks but when it gets this bad someone has got to be the bigger person, put their feelings aside and work really hard to fix it.|`|lYE34CVTaa	Definitely marriage counseling. Go to the Dr. Phil website. They had an episode about this very thing the other day.|`|5NKa5Y8laa	Compromise, give and take = equality.  If either of you has something to say, the other should shut up and listen, and give their partner a chance to speak.  Sounds like you could both benefit from marriage counselling, to learn how to fight fair.|`|Gx14PIvxaa	I think that there are natural roles that men and women fall into in a relationship. Personally, I would be delighted to cook and clean and have a part-time job, but spend most of my time as a wife and mother. I don't think there's anything wrong with that.    PERSONALLY - in MY experience - women who hold high-power jobs and are the "boss" in their home are nagging bitches and their husbands would rather sit on an ice pick than have an intimate relationship with them.    Relationships are all about balance, and what YOU feel is right for you. You may want a more submissive woman, or you may want an independent, assertive woman. Maybe I've just met all the wrong women, but I can't stand those bitches.|`|VmH7e0r7aa	I don't really understand your question. Your grammar is not so good. But it sounds to me like you need some counseling. And to understand that the whole "Beaver Cleaver" thing is outdated and unrealistic for this day & age.|`|AA11288692	Yeah dude! I understand where your coming from.  As much as we guys like to hold it in and see if we can fix it, or if it'll slide - we can't.   It'll come up later, explode, and be a bigger deal that means nadda.  Wives LOVE it when you talk all the freakin time.  Something annoying? Say so, but kinda off handed -like it didn't REALLY mean anything. They take that and analyze it 10000 different ways.  My relationship with my wife has gotten better when I immediately voice concerns or doubts about anything that happens.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	The best thing you can both do it to sit down on a calm day (not a fighting day) and discuss your expectations for chores around the house.  In my house - I hate doing laundry!  My husband hates doing grocery shopping!  So I do the grocery shopping and he does the laundry...If I cook - he cleans up and vice-versa.  We both work full-time and we do try to split household chores as equally as we can.  I will admit that most of the interior household duties fall on me and the majority of the outdoor duties fall on him.  However, we do help each other out - it is our home after all.    If things get heated while you guys try to communicate and work out the split - then agree to disagree and revisit the conversation when you have both calmed down.  It is a technique that gets easier to master over time.  Communication is key!|`|AA10228871	Biblically, husband is the head of a household, as Christ is the head of a Church, according to my faith. But at the same time, she is not an inferior person, she is your better half, your wife, the mother of your children, if any. She has rights at home as well as you do. She is a major part of decision making in the house as well as you.  In a relationship, word like "boss" does not exist but there is a word that is call "respect" You must respect one another and be able to compromise on some issues. It does not really matter who has the final say, as long as it's the best. Remember the saying "two heads are better than one" I can understand, there are some time you have to put your feet down on some issues as the man of the house but you must give her a vital reason to convince her why you gonna do that, and make sure she is happy before you proceed. No more unnecessary fight and argument as these are not healthy in a relationship. " A word is enough for the wise"    She is very right and fair, you don't have to wait and bring up a dead issues at the time when one of you is upset. You let her know her mistakes and wrongdoings at the time of happening, by telling her with respect and love and not by arguing or shouting. If you cannot tell her right   away, you wait till a time when she is calm or in happy mood, point them out to her with "love and respect". I'm sure she is not an animal, she will listen, appreciates, and apologise, if needs be, and you guys will start living a better and happy life.    Remember "two wrongs does not make a right". Peace.|`|3iNobwVraa	Yes, it is fair, because you are distracting from the topic.  She called the meeting, she sets the agenda.  You have an agenda?  Call your own meeting.    In practice, all this does is enable you to avoid dealing with your own actions and accountability.  It's pretty textbook, and probably communication mistake  1.  Stop it.  It just complicates the meeting so nothing is ever resolved because of all the finger-pointing.  Deal with one issue at a time, then move to the next.|`|p02rE5Q8aa	Well forst things first, no one is the "boss" when you're married. If either of you thinks that way, things will end badly. As far as equality goes, you both need to contribute. If you work all day and she stays home, she needs to run the home smoothly. If you both work then you need to take turns doing the "chores"...making dinner, taking out the trash, etc. I tell you the first few yrs of marriage are the hardest because you're trying to find the right "groove" to things. I've only been married 6 yrs but I would NEVER EVER re-live those first 2 yrs, they were too hard!!!   I understand she wants you to talk to her calmly...I hate when my hubby yells. Always try to stay calm but remember, ever good couple fights. It'll be ok!! Good luck!
JGGbQhCaaa	Seems like it's time for an all-cards-on-the-table talk. Seems like he's head for sowing-wild-oats-territory and is trying to prepare you for it.   You are both young; are thinking in terms of lifetime commitment? Doesn't seem that he is.    Prepare for the worst. Settle for better. Don't put all your eggs in this basket or any basket this early in your life.   Peace.|`|7e8be8f471de4c60d8884f52a597ddc2aa	Wait and if a long time has pasted just keep open communication|`|wYfLYyyOaa	wait... he is just not ready for a serious relationship if he loves you he will come back|`|SZ2fmoShaa	my boyfriend will be at college until august... and hes been gone since october. we recently broke up but im not seeing anyone. we're still in love and we still keep in contact we just dont have that label because its too hard. dont put ur life on hold. trust me, u will regret it. just have fun responsibily and trust ur gut on the decisions you make.|`|fHHeal1Vaa	i never waited for you, obeyed to get you faster, but waited NO. how can you wait, what kind of love and passion is it if it can wait. no, the moment i feel in my heart there is a way to escape, i will take it

PCE7ri7daa	Well, she might be hurt; or stunned. Although on the negative side, you have to take into consideration: Is this an online relationship? Do you see each other eye to eye contact?    If so, then online relationships are sometimes different, sometimes the person is not who they say they are, sometimes they are dating multiple people online too.    Can you call her? Try and talk to her and ask her what she might by this and ask her if she loves you and if she thinks the relationship is going good.|`|sCr2iTczaa	Wow i am weak as a b*tch i can't stop laughing ha ha that should be put into a movie make it a comedy... Oh sorry about that, well she was probably calm like that because you told her the truth straight up, and trust me girls respect any man who will tell them the truth about the wrong things they have done.|`|slJlLGMVaa	She probably trusts u, and know u were sincere in what u said|`|AA11180444	If you can admit your mistakes and PROVE that it won't ever happen again, you might be ok because the only thing saving you from a breakup is an understanding girlfriend.  Screw up again and she has every right to dump your behind.|`|YfCRmWeSaa	she might not know how to deal with it so she responded in a normal tone to ease tension but don't ever push your luck with her understanding nature|`|wAWDyFr2aa	Sounds like u need to grow up a bit. Her reply is normal for a girl that really likes you.
TPhIWWniaa	If he is the right man you'll definitely know it, I know it sounds silly but you'll really feel it all over; you'll be able to talk about anything and everything, you'll share a lot of things in common and share a lot of the same beliefs and points of view, etc.    In the eyes of God no it is not good to have sex with anyone before marriage but it ultimately is your personal choice; and if he's the one pressuring you to have sex with him then he really isn't the right man.|`|dEFap0Zaaa	Don't plan on having sex......just let it happen,and I think it's a good idea that people find out all about each other before they get married....that way there are no disappointments on the wedding night|`|tsPGVVWcaa	Usually you can just tell he's the right one for you, Can you see you self being with him for the rest of your life?? When your with him do you still get butterflies? And YES i think you have to have sex with him before you marry him  he might be awful in the sack!|`|OHydEvTCaa	Wait, wait, wait! Yes it is wrong to have sex before marriage.|`|FzFSzilmaa	sex before marriage is essential... you wouldn't buy a car without a test drive, would you???|`|fmIDB4ZFaa	I agree with Forlorn.  You have to try out the goods before you get married.
X3GRTBXtaa	just expand on your common likes and dislikes and such it may seem a little awkward but it usually is until you really warm up to somebody, start to hang out after school or whatever

vOgfAvMlaa	I would leave a message otherwise she will be looking at her phone wondering who called her. just say "hey ____ this is Joe my number is ___ please give me a call when you get a chance." i wouldn't say anything about asking her out on the message that is better to do when you actually have her on the phone.|`|X3GRTBXtaa	sure, but don't ask for the date over the message you wanna do that in direct contact. just say hi just trying to reach you or something like that|`|IVCCmdmVaa	If she offered her phone   and it was really her  , then I would say she is interested. Yes, I would leave a message but be real casual about it, if you both have somethings in common that you know of...maybe going to antique shops, ask her if she would like to do something like that with you. It sounds more like something a friend could ask a friend for the first time instead of "dinner and a movie". You both would probably feel more comfortable, and she would be more likely to return your call with yes or no.

JlDcVTVsaa	tell her that what ever happened to her, was in her past and you know it was before you were together so you cant get mad at her, and tell her that you will respect what ever she has decided to do about it and you wont pressure her to do any thing else (like calling the police or telling her family)  and when you say these please mean it, if she trusts you and tells you, please please dont make her do any thing about it that she dosnt want to do.    i hope it helps|`|IdtzdpqGaa	OMG, you need to cowboy up, stop being a baby and crying and getting sick, you should put that attention into your girlfriend and wait she will tell you when she is ready, why worry about the past, you should be more concerned with the future.  stop whining|`|WWNWtzvDaa	just wait until she wants to tell you what it is that happened .. it may not be that she has been raped ..and your 14 isnt there fun stuff you should be doing ..=/|`|Midbg5BJaa	Try and be there for her and don't pressure her.    Be also aware that she could be making it up... (Horrible I know).|`|6iR7Mvc5aa	I'm so happy that you are both christians. Give her time has she said one day she will open up to you. Remember do not to disappoint her once she opens up to you. I'm sure it wasn't her fort for the horrible things that happened to her. Has a christian remember also that you are not surpposed to renge no matter what it is.|`|rApLHbmWaa	Don't force her to talk until she is ready!   As comments  3 said just be there for her and be honest!  When she is ready to talk, let everything she says stay between you and her! Never tell anyone else!|`|zNjjuZK6aa	Yeah I raped her.  The best thing you can do now is let her go so that she doesn't realize how insignificant you are compared to me.
28WJwHf4aa	My husband is the same way. If something bothered him at work, he comes home frustrated and snaps easily. He just wants to be left alone.     Maybe your husband is snappy because he feels bad about not having a job?? Maybe he feels like he isn't worthy to be your husband as he's not supporting you?? Instead of dealing with those frustrations and issues himself, he could be taking them out on you.     You have to sit your husband down and communicate with him how it makes you feel when he does this. If it continues, I'd look into counseling.|`|jaAolejUaa	he's entering midlife crisis|`|kEtYEmhqaa	stress?|`|6a0f5242e106e58c4ca1b110e61eb592aa	You two need to sit down and communicate/talk with each other or seek marriage counseling, Sounds like the honeymoon is definitely over and you guys need intervention....|`|oojO4WAraa	He's a ***** and a big baby and hasn't learned how to get along with people.  He is probably depressed because he doesn't have a job - but that isn't your fault and he shouldn't take it out on you.      Get him some books on managing his anger if tell him if he doesn't straighten up you will divorce his unhappy *ss.  He will do this as long as you allow it.|`|HhY4Oul2aa	cuz he is being a jerk|`|AA12041870	Why isn't he working?  Is that his decision, or is his job gone?  He may feel inferior to you right now if he lost his job.  He may feel like he has slipped back into that little boy being taken care of by mommy.  Men are to proud to tell you how they really feel, so he is keeping his unhappiness locked inside himself and carrying on in another way.  I bet this is hard for you.  I hope things work out for both of you soon.|`|Rp7VvIOdaa	midlife crisis............|`|slyLXuROaa	you should ask him if soething is going on because like you said about beeing moody you may not even relize how moody you are so you should talk to him about it|`|RsJHmJKYaa	Go do the ironing ....he'll appreciate that . Oh ...and by the way ....if you are MARIO ANDRIETTE  when you drive ... teach him a lesson ...the short way and that FAST is better !|`|3Qxqh68xaa	It sounds like you both have very different boundaries, which happens in even the best marriages.  Men have tendancy not to want to be corrected, even if it is to fix a bunched shirt.  If it is not life-threatening - let it go.  If it bothers him, he'll fix it.  I'm very compulsive, so it was a constant battle with my ex-husband not to correct everything.  Pick your battles and try to not let the small things bother you.|`|wQSsw8QHaa	me and my wife have been together 5 years now and that is happening to us as well i think all relationship go tho some sort of a phase i notice its when im off of work i think it would be better for both of you if he went and got a job|`|dc5bTUtmaa	Tell him to quit spitting his dummy out of his pram n' grow up n' while he's at it learn what a sink, a cooker n' a hoover is for n' learn the meaning of the word respect. Woman, he is not mature enough to be a husband.|`|BhXOLas1aa	He feels that you are too perfect. He resents you and all you do, so he does less and less. It's a typical male trait and not unusual. Don't be so perfect, make things happen that only he can sort and then genuinely show your appreciation.   It may be that he is suffering from depression and low self esteem. You need to get him to think that he has the idea of having a chat with his doctor about this.  If he's just a lazy person who does nothing to help himself, then kick him into touch and tell him to change his ways or leave.  Leave him a list of household chores you would like him to do so that you are less tired and can spend more quality time with him too.  It might work.  I hope so.|`|j7l9gavRaa	I had the exact same issue with my bf, he was out of work and I think it made him a bit depressed, it will pass just try to find ways to make him feel like he's contributing|`|xSu5A4eYaa	bad day ar work|`|763e0791a59159a2aedd2bef60b1435daa	could be bipolar. Does anyone in his family have it?|`|0rpS2b97aa	I think he needs to back off.  With that said, wow only a year and it is going on?|`|QOITXwDIaa	The question you need to ask yourself is why you love someone who treats you like this.      You can't hold all of this in.  You need to have a sit down convo with him about how he is hurting you (NOT right after an incident).      Also sounds like he is depressed.  Is he one of those "victim" types who blames everything on others?      There are so many variables to this, but you need to ask yourself what it actually is that you love about him.      I hope he is willing to work on his communication skills or else you will either end up divorced (which isn't always a bad thing) or you will end up miserable and your self esteem will continue going down hill.|`|a8c1ec2782f2cbb1944ac1b3fd537fa6aa	give him a kick up the backside. he sounds awful. if you want to make this work take him to relationship counselling. sounds like he is depressed and has very low self esteem...which could stem from him losing his job. Was he like this before he was out of work? It might be his way of showing who wears the trousers in the relationship, he may feel like you are now the main provider and breadwinner in the family so he is showing his masculinity in other ways.  Sit down with him and talk it through. tell him you are not willing to accept the way he speaks to you but that you love him and want to help him work thru it all.|`|kPS9Okh3aa	well he could be feeling down on himself because he's out of a job and you're taking care of home while he sits home on his butt,,it could be a testosterone problem he's having and he doesn't know how to adjust his attitude,,he probably doesn't know how to react to you sometimes because he could think that maybe you think he ain't worth much or something like that or he could just be being a jackass-    HOPE I HELPED :-)|`|q9t321ttaa	It sounds like he's stressed over not having a job. A lot of the time a husband feels useless if he doesn't have a job and his wife does. Especially if he's just at home all day while your juggling work, cleaning,  and school. I've noticed that people tend to get mad and impatient at the people whom they love and trust, because they know that they have their love and trust. I would say just try to be really patient and considerate, even if it's really hard. Hopefully things will get better when he gets another job. Hang in there, I hope everything works out! :-)|`|Fa5OPBhjaa	tell him he need to stop getting angry over the little things and stop whining like a baby and to start helping you or you will kick him out and if he still does nothing and acts the same send him to anger management maybe that would help i wish you luck.|`|2Xw4Tm0Taa	I kind of sound like he views you as a bit of a nag.  That's a HUGE pet peeve for men.    Try to accept what he does w/out correcting or 'mothering' him.  If he feels you see him as capable of doing his own thing, and making his own decisions, he'll lighten up.    Just because he doesn't do, say, or act like you would doesn't make his mannerisms or style wrong.  Does that make sense?    Good luck to you both!|`|AWb0L9IKaa	It could range from mid life crisis to stress to having a bad time at work. He is in the best position to say what is going on, try talking to him.
pANpZ3vaaa	You made the right choice of living with him before taking it to the next step and getting married.    You might think you love him, but now you really know what your relationship will be like in the future.  You need to sit down by yourself, make sure you a relaxed, and think about your relationship with him for a few hours.    Ask yourself if it is really worth saving, and ask yourself if you really do love him, or is it just puppy love.    If you really do love him, then go see a counselor, or you could tell him that you want to take a break and let him miss you and remember how good he had it.    Just remember, just because you love someone, doesn't mean you were mean to be together.|`|7e8be8f471de4c60d8884f52a597ddc2aa	Counseling worked for me|`|0ZnX6Qjyaa	break up you are incompatible|`|4S6V4sb4aa	End it... The only worse you can do in a relationship is cheat...|`|t81MEJ82aa	It's good that you understand that this is also your responsibility unlike the brainwashed zombies who make it seem if two people get physical it's only the man's fault.    You two do not know how to constructively communicate with one another. I would suggest counseling. I know that this is common for people to say but it's good to have somewhere neutral where the two of you can actually discuss your problems constructively and have someone show how to communicate more effectively.|`|htSZsds7aa	Get your own place to stay, shacking up is NOT good. stop having sex, stop letting him push your buttons, and get counciling.|`|Kr09aQJkaa	How do you communicate better? You don't. How often do you see men sitting around the kitchen table, sipping tea, and talking about their feelings? Never. If you want your relationship to change then change your behavior. If you want romance be romantic. If you want sex be sexual. If you want love be loving.     Men could care less if you talk about change they want to see the change. If you are with a good man he will respond to your loving ways and return the love. If you get no response then your boyfriend is the wrong guy for you and it's time to move on.|`|lyNgNpRgaa	If he's hit a girl, he's scum.  Move on with your life and find a real man.|`|5fLEd3o5aa	You can try counseling and if that doesn't work consider that this may not be the man or relationship for you. This could be a toxic 'love' and maybe you guys have just gotten comfortable and are afraid to move on even though moving on might be the best thing.|`|a94257e28d6b37ec0048499a1cda4a58aa	If he is physically abusing you get away from him. He won't stop and it will get worse.|`|SoMLkSPTaa	I been there done that. Anyone that hits another person it isn't love it is wrong. This can't be a good love mate. You both need to work on what it is that makes you want to toss the other person. When you get like that then walk away. Talk to one another. If you want it to work out then you need to talk to one another to find out what you both need to do, I wish you both the best.|`|gDuDNeRcaa	take a break. go stay with a friend or your parents for about a week or so. let things cool down. then have a "date". meet up somewhere for lunch or dinner. then still wait a couple more days....see how things are going. communication is key. make sure you still talk on the phone, but keep it short and sweet. then when you're both ready to talk about the serious issues, do it face to face. either of you getting physical is completely unacceptable. and once it gets to that point, it won't stop unless both of you are willing to take a step back, cool off, and come back together and get through it as a couple.|`|29hcn9JRaa	We all want instant gratification, however life isn't always going to be that simple, you and your boyfriend are basically bouncing this negative energy off each other to the point of dysfunction and bitterness, this is where fighting and arguing leads to, it leads to more fights and more bitterness, till one day someone has had enough. You are both at a high risk for breaking up, and I am guessing that your boyfriend is getting mentally drained by all this, and when men get mentally drained, they bail. So if you really want to keep this relationship intact, start keeping it simple and stress free, men and women both tend to do much better when simplicity is on board, so keep it simple, and don't have any high expectations of making this work within a day, this takes a consistent effort on both people.|`|w6XnDg43aa	I was in this situation. Once things get physical it's time to leave. It won't get better.

I suggest you break it off before someone gets hurt.  Sorry.|`|gf7syTvcaa	Don't let things get physical.  If you get to that point, take a break and talk about it later.  Stress in your life can be tough on a relationship.  Just make sure you both don't take out your stresses on each other.|`|5LmcANuXaa	OMG! hahaha. Been there, done that.  I go to college with my boyfriend and we have been fighting a lot too.  One thing I realized was that I should be more patient with him.  See, he's a very short tempered person. If he's mad, I shouldn't be. I should cheer him up, not be mad as well because that won't solve anything. yes, every couple argues. It's because they love each other and care for each other. Him and I are going great now because I'm being more patient. He told me that he loves me a lot because I am so patient with him and I am so kind and sweet. See, I accomplished something by controlling my anger. It really works.|`|025255845c488dcd3b7ba13b61196283aa	Try to isolate where the stress is coming from.  If it is not from each other and is rather outside influences than you need to separate your relationship from them   In other words, sit down and talk about what is stressing you out and causing fights.  If you can determine it is not each other then acknowledge that, and make a pledge to not take out your stress on each other.  Try to find a different stress reliever (running, vidoe-games, reading....)  the big problem I see is when anger or stress is misdirected.|`|c048dda899013eb79a0dcd7544239d33aa	do you both share the same faith?

iuSrMdwmaa	The obvious answer is involve them in the wedding party in some way - but as they are your fiance's children and will be your stepchildren something more is needed.    Very important is that they hear their names spoken several times in the ceremony.    After the vows your officiant can ask them to join the two of you and have you both make promises to them. Psychologically it is not a good thing to expect the children to make promises to you. They may have mixed feelings out of loyalty to their mother and shouldn't be put in that difficult situation.    Make them a promise, give them a gift in token ("grown-up" jewelry never goes amiss), and make sure you get lots of photos together.    Have the officiant pronounce you husband and wife ... and family.    Maybe even walk back down the aisle with each of you holding one child's hand so you walk down 4 abreast.|`|577ba10a2319b430720b5a913b74b862aa	depending on age of the kids -- my sister was in same situation, the boys were older teens, and towards the end of the ceremony (a pretty casual outdoor one) they had the boys come up and gave them family rings that they had gotten for them to recognize that now they are a family.  i liked that very much.    also talk to whoever is performing the ceremony for ideas.|`|UgcPxd4maa	flower girl, ring bearer, Ushers (boys-if they're older)|`|6d718b2ca0424bba8e88fd0bd7a40273aa	I'm in a similar situation. Depending on the children ages and sex, you can have them as the ring bearer/flower girl, jr. groomsman/jr. bridesmaid, or an usher. You should first see if the mother will let the children be in the wedding, and if so, take into consideration if the children would want to do it. My fiance's oldest is shy and doesn't like to be in the spotlight, so he wouldn't feel comfortable. The youngest child's mother is not interested in her son being apart of our wedding. So you need to ask first and then see. If none of the aforementioned positions seem right maybe you can have them as a host, i.e. passing out favors, depending on maturity level and age.|`|gK0vcdnDaa	Ask your officiant of ways to work them into the ceremony.  My step father and I took vows, and he gave me a locket with the date engraved on it.  The vows were something like honor and respecting each other in times of trial and hardship, but to be a family.    My cousin married and there were three children involved, so after the man/wife did their "I Do" the officiant had them as a couple turn to the kids and vow to be a family, with respect and love.    I think that including them is very important, and as the person above mentioned it depends on age as to how much the are involved.  I was 8 in my mothers wedding.  When my dad re-married I was 16 and I was content to just be a "grooms-maid" with no real participation in the ceremony itself.  Talk to them, see what they think.    Congratulations and Good Luck!  -Elle|`|AA11065158	I'm getting married in Sept and have a 6 year old son from my first marriage. My fiance and I are are doing a sand ceremony during the wedding. Normally, the bride and groom take 2 different colors of sand and pour them into 1 container. This is to symbolize the joining of the 2 people. When we do our ceremony, we will add my son as well. My fiance will pour his sand, then I will pour mine, then my son will pour his in. After that, the 3 of us will all pour the remaining sand in together to symbolize the joining of our 2 families. I'm really excited about this! It's going to be my favorite part of the ceremony.  Just google/yahoo family sand ceremony. You'll find lots of examples.    Congrats on your upcoming wedding!

AA10065812	They can't take your money, but 20% of your income is used in the calculations for child support.  Give him the following:    Im a Fathers Rights Advocate for 20 years.       Many think the courts are rigged against dads, but in reality, it is more about attorneys unwilling or lacking the knowledge to truly fight for the father's rights.  This is why it is important to learn how to interview and hire the right attorney.  It is also important to do as much as possible on your own and not pay the attorney to do it.    Start keeping a daily journal of all your activities.  The most common way to prevent a father from getting his rights through the courts is a false allegation, usually sexual.  Over 60% of divorcing father are accused of child sexual abuse, of which only 4% are found to have any relevance, but there are no penalties for doing so.  A daily journal is your number one piece of evidence in court and you can even refer to it while on the stand.      Gather evidence.  Check the site below to see if it is illegal to record conversations without the other person knowing.  If your state does not have a law either way, than it defaults to the federal ruling which says one person in a conversation must know they are being recorded.  Youre that one person.  In Missouri it is specifically legal, in Kansas there is no mention either way.  If you live in two different states, and one has a law against it, than it applies when the call originates from within that state,    Now, you can't just record, you also have to transcribe it into the daily journal.    If you want to learn how to do all this go to Dads House in Yahoo Groups.  There's an educational manual in the file section that can teach you what you need to know.  The organization it came from is defunct due to attorneys that tried to take it over and make money from it.    Take the time to learn what you can and should do.    http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/Dad...  http://tinyurl.com/GiveKidsAChoice  http://www.rcfp.org/taping/  http://www.glennsacks.com  http://www.parentalalienation.org/|`|bO2rzfISaa	I can understand that you don't ant to loose your money, but seriously, what are his kids getting by on?

There are a lot of people on disability that have to pay child support. And your husband needs to support his children or he should not have had them.    I read what you added.  There should be documentatiion of her mental problems and you need to find it. When you go to court show that the children are stable,  happy and and well fed and you should win and then I would apply for child support from her.  If they grant it, let her get behind and don't worry about the money and if she ever gives you more problems she wont have a leg to stand on.
iqrXIQctaa	That is a tough situation to be in, I have been there with my girl friends. I have two very best friends and now that I am happy and have a boyfriend they both don't like it even tho I do make time for them.     Here is my opinion, I'd say talk to him about it once more and explain that your friendship does mean a lot to you but it also takes two people to have a friendship and you need him to meet you somewhere to fix the issue. Its not fair that he puts this on you, and talking is usually the only way to fix any problem.    I also think he may have a crush on you and that is why he doesn't like your bf. I have more guy friends than girls, I have a small group of boys that are like my brothers. Each and everyone of them has tried to date me at some point and I had to break it to each of them that I cared for them as just friends.     All you can do is try sweety if he means that much to you, but there comes a time in every girls life where certain friends just slip away for this reason. I hope this helps hun. Good Luck =]|`|dtnFX2ylaa	check out his zodiac sign what he likes , do not like tell him how you feel about your relationship make him understand that you really care for your friendship he will .|`|9vOBtO1Oaa	Leave each other alone for a while. Stop beating a nearly dead horse into FULL death. Let it heal. Give each other space. Things will fall into that space which will better explain what the conflicts.If you have really been good friends, time will allow you 2 to realize and honour that fact. If you had not been true friends, time will also let you realize that.    Wanting things to go back to normal is h just a wish. Whatever has come in to stand as a conflict will not allow wishful thinking become the miracle cure.    Take some time away from each other, even if you are the one who initiates it!  Good Luck!|`|n7vsfdplaa	If he wants to be a baby then let him sounds like he liked you a little more than friends and is now pissed you're with someone else. Let him have a cry and say well if you can't be a gd friend to me right now then I guess we can't be friends anymore.
STbRyyEFaa	It could, but it could also mean she likes flowers. We do sometimes buy them for ourselves, or for friends. If you see her again start talking to her. If she is involved you will probably find out in a few minutes and if not, well it sounds like she soon will be!|`|UgcPxd4maa	she could have bought them for someone else, mom, grandma....|`|H7cNZYIYaa	lol why else would she have a bouquet of flowers?|`|brd9Z8VRaa	hahaha. yes. flowers mean that she's happily married with 6 children. what, you didn't get the memo?      maybe her grandmother gave them to her. hell, maybe she even bought them for herself. just because she's hot and is holding flowers doesn't mean anything. just talk to her.|`|Ccs9LeIEaa	hahah it might not. i buy flowers for my friends and mom and they for me so it could have been from a female friend!     you shoulda asked her! ! :)|`|2c3rcQRbaa	Attached to what?  Look closely at the stems.  Are you sure they aren't in the form of vibrators?  Maybe this is why she is so happy.|`|AA11907960	not everyone...sometimes I carry a boquet of flowers for someone else, I love flowers and i keep smelling it and smiling wherever I am.|`|KZlgdMeEaa	not necessarily... could be shes on her way to visit someone in the hospital or its her bday or she got a promotion.|`|F9Wqp5YMaa	not necessarily  sometimes you buy flowers for other people such as grandma, mother, etc  or sometimes the guys who tries to flir with you buy flowers  or sometimes people give you flowers for your successful job   or sometimes people give you flowers beause of your birthday or some kind of promotion  or sometimes you buy flowers to your friend who has something to celebrate -like the opening of exhibition, etc|`|0PVOkUtcaa	no it doset mean that|`|DKyV5CU1aa	she was on her way to her best friends baby's funral, then you looked at her like that and made her day even feel even more like hell. . . .that you just assumed that she's attached, right now she's hurting so much she just needed someone to hug her, she is trying to stay strong for her best friend and she has no one to hold her,
70aa0db8082ddead46f656ecb978193aaa	I got married in June 2008 and enjoyed every minute of it.  There was a certain amount of nerves but the most important thing to remember is that the wedding is not the most important thing...it's the marriage.  The wedding is a few hours...the marriage is forever.  If it's the right person standing next to you, all the other stuff that happens that day is just fluff.|`|9fDkrrFyaa	Believe me you wont be the first couple that is going to be nervous at their wedding. Have you ever watch Americas Funniest Home videos Wedding edition, its a blast....everything has happen like you describe before, fainting/passing out, messed up vows, hair caught on fire.....if you think of it, it has happen at a wedding.    Try to overcome your nervousness by rehearsing, rehearsing and once the actual wedding ceremony is over, you will feel much relief.     Good luck.|`|Mwb5UkPBaa	Talk to each other about the whole ordeal. Once you know what the other is thinking it'll put you both at ease. You're engaged and that obviously means you love each other. Just remember your doing this so you can be with the one you love and what your loved one has done for you and why your proud to be with them.|`|de641317a0696a8d53df9d1538305a2baa	I was nervous.  Very nervous.  But you know what?  It was my day and my husband's day, so I decided that I was going to say and do whatever the hell I wanted and have fun doing it.  So, Up there on the altar, he and I joked around, we even on purpose played around with our vows and got people laughing.  I pulled a cigar out of a friend's mouth and smoked it  during the reception.  We did The Time Warp as a wedding dance.  It was all a RIOT and it kept me from being too nervous.|`|b2Cr9E5Gaa	My partner is a little bit worried about this too, mainly because he knows he has to make a speech, and all through school when public speeched came around...well he never participated...he refused..so this is going to be really difficult on him, plus he is definitely not one to be centre of attention.    We getting married in August and I just keep telling him that its friends and family, all the people who love us..the worst thing that can happen is you fall and trip..and no one is going to laugh, at least not until they know your ok , and even then they all all love us, it wont be a big deal. If you end up  shaking all day, and being completely nervous, dont worry about it, its your special day...try not to create so much feeling, once you get there my bets are on that your on cloud 9, you ll be fine! Our bodies are equiped with natural chemicals that work to our advantage in emotional situations :D.     Congrats|`|RmIeoU7raa	I'm having to same problem as you and my wedding is a week away.  I know that I could NEVER have an actually wedding with a lot of people because I would no doubt have an anxiety attack.  To fix this my fiance and I have decided to get married in my parents house with just my parents and his parents there.  I still am nervous about it because I absolutely hate being the center of attention even when it's that small.    Maybe you and your fiance could have a smaller wedding.  You're going to be nervous no matter what but having a smaller wedding will help tremendously.      Another idea could be to have just your close friends and close family at the ceremony.  Then after all that is done you can have the rest of your friends and family meet you somewhere to have the reception.     Since you and your fiance are both nervous I think you should talk it over and change your plans so it won't be as hard on both of you.  This is what my fiance and did and I am very glad we made the changes.  Right now I would be more a a wreck than I am now. lol      Hope everything works out for you and congrats on your wedding =)|`|U6lQVtF5aa	I wasn't too nervous.  My wife and I had it in our house with family and friends.  We did a potluck and no one dressed up too nicely.  It was a nice memory, relaxing and everyone helped contribute to the party so it wasn't just ours to bear.  One of the best ways to do a wedding I think.  I know too many people who have bad memories of their wedding because they tried to make it too big.|`|OngsAj6Kaa	oh please, who doesn't get nervous? i was when i was walking down the aisle, but when you both get up there, you can focus on each other, and it makes it easier. just don't stand with your knees locked together, if you do you will pass out for sure.     good luck!|`|pdPX1Pt6aa	Not that i've been married before but being nervous for an event like this is perfictly natural. just remember that  it's your day (when the day come) and it going to be alright every thing is going to work out theres no reason to go and worry about some thing that isn't worth worrying about. Not that a wedding isn't werth worrying about just don't think much of what could go wrong as much as you should think of what should go right. It's not the end of the world in fact in a sence it the begining of one so don't worry so much. Ok! its all going to work out it always does.|`|sEDGYy03aa	The only time that I was nervous was during the ceremony.  The main thing is get the attention off you.  A good DJ will help with that by getting people the dance floor.  The only time you might get some more attention is during dinner.
cWy17SRnaa	Yes, they are different.  An actual brother is related to you and born from the same parents and a friend is just a friend.  You call a friend a brother, when he is more then just a friend you feel like his is part of your family.
CfUVG6IYaa	You will never know unless you ask and he is ready to admit it. Even if he says he doesn't like you, he might just be too afraid/shy to say so. He is worried about what his friends would say, you know?    If you really want to know, ask. If he says no, you must be prepared to move on.|`|slJlLGMVaa	U know if a guy likes u, if he flirts with u a lot, if he smiles, blushes, stares, etc. =]|`|a0Vg5vMyaa	wen he wanna be around u...he always luk at u..nd u just kno|`|AA11180444	Ask, if he turns you down then you know for sure. You would know if he looked at you with that kind of look.|`|XmjXkmAJaa	Im going through the same thing right now..but i think you should just ask him..i think im gonna do that|`|FxhTgVg8aa	Ah, darling. Boys are hard to read but it doesn't even matter. What you should do is give him some hints and test the ice. If he seems okay with the flirting get to know him better and make sure you like him. Dont tell anyone you like him until your sure you do and then go for it, tell him.
WMR8hVlfaa	Seems to me you're just trying to get people to admit they're racist. For the type of answers you wanted, you should have asked "what would you do if someone outside your race flirted with you?". Probably would have baited more people with that than by asking them to admit to their racism outright.|`|0udjgaoBaa	We are not in the 50's....Its 2009 im german,black and ponca indian. and my man is puerto rican...I dont even see different colors...Can you make me laugh? Do you make good money? Are you good with kids? Those are the initial questions and all I need to know at first.|`|Q5FYrU9vaa	Only racist ppl would be against interracial dating. Is it really a big deal if a hispanic goes out with a black man, if a white man goes out with an azn woman. NOOO.. Love is what counts not the color of ur skin or what race u r.|`|AA11512648	Interracial dating is a personal decison. Just remember one thing, if someone outside your race flirts with you, treat them with respect, as a friend, but do not accept an offer to go out with them, unless you are willing to accept the pressure society offers. Just one statistic that you should be aware of, 95% or interracial marriages end in divorce. Other factors are can you deal with doing things with hardly any social circle, your race disowning you, and if there are children they will truly have to deal with societys issues a lot. These are issues whether anyone wants to believe it or not that someone has to deal with. I know they are cold, but the facts are they are the truth. If you look hard enough you will see for yourself these cold hard facts.
TfPDMDZMaa	Matt Nathanson: Wedding Dress, Come On Get Higher    Marvin Gaye: Let's Get It On    Bryan Adams: Heaven, Everything I do, I'll Always Be Right There|`|UgcPxd4maa	have them make a list of they're favorite songs|`|cGbTJobeaa	OK...this is going to sound racist but it's not, so bear with me.    Frequently in movies when there is a black couple and they are going to make love, they always play the same song.  I don't know what the title of this song is.  If you watch the movie Mr 3000, the song is in that movie. I think there is a rule or something that black people have to make love to this song.    Anyway. the song begins with these distinctive 3 notes on maybe a trumpet.  Since this song is played to set up the sex scene in so many movies, I start laughing whenever I hear these 3 notes.    OK...for a serious suggestion....Bolero.  It is classical music and the composer is Ravel.|`|C7rW48Cjaa	What type of music do they like?    Recent artist. Try some Raheem DaVaughn,   Anthony Hamilton, Floetry, Maxwell, Musiq SoulChild, Robin Thicke    Oldies. Try Marvin Gaye, Al Green, Teddy Pendergrass, and soooo many more. Just gotta search.     But def figure out what THEY like..|`|iWcXFF38aa	Ne Yo's 'Say It' is a pretty intense lovemaking song    Plus anything by Joe, Brian McKnight, and John Legend is good too.

If you are more of the serious and thoughtful one in the relationship, go that way.    "Keep this with you, and I will be with you"|`|Am1wfhBDaa	This is my man.|`|rlUUaSgqaa	Usually I think it's great when you can just laugh together and not just have to be romantic all the time.  For something that's going to be on a ring you'll be wearing your whole life, though, I would want something more meaningful.  I like "Lasting Love" since it's already your personal saying and means something to you.|`|ByUS0k8waa	I wish I could have engraved my hubby's ring. I would have put "You bring out the best in me."

AA10065812	After confirming the DNA, but remember that he could also file for visitation rights.|`|Am1wfhBDaa	Blood test.|`|utGddhnVaa	thats quite the sit-tu-a-tion. I'm glad i read this so i could make a note-to-self never to get into this pickle|`|veZLfnGFaa	It's according to who was married to her at the time she got pregnant. In some states, the father is the one that was married to the woman, until proven otherwise.|`|RBQrgByeaa	Tough story there. Well, do you WANT the kid? If yes, as you are legal caretaker for the wife, you have a right to him. But, sure, ask the old man to pay.|`|2esGKO2Caa	Up  have to you go get an attorney and you'll have to file to have him take a paternity test if it comes back positive you can then sue him for arrears. Then the state will have to come after him for child support.|`|7e8be8f471de4c60d8884f52a597ddc2aa	yes|`|8bplNvAQaa	She's quite a catch.    You know the answer to this question.|`|Midbg5BJaa	Yes he should be, if the kid is his.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	Get a DNA test and then sort it all out.|`|rNUIQgTmaa	I applaud your dignity and morals to your child.    Yes, if it is his, he should pay YOU child support to help you raise YOUR child that you have loved and cared for since he was born.    He should be helping you make your life easier in any way possible for your son.    The courts will enforce it if this is the case.     the "sperm" father will not be able to get custody of this child if you have been the father all this time. He may have visitation or be able to take the child on weekends.    good luck.|`|AA11328507	Depends on your state laws.  In lots of states the husband is deemed the responsible father JUST because he is the husband at the time of pregnancy.|`|hZ9omSataa	karma is a *****!!!  lol!  Though it sounds like ur the one being punished.|`|BhXOLas1aa	'the kid'? what is it a baby goat?  I assume your child has been DNA tested to prove who the father is?  When that is determined and he is the father, then yes, he should pay child support.|`|rt4OnxkYaa	yes he would have to pay child support if you decided to make him... you could also, in some cases, sue him for all the child support you have paid thus far.|`|uUuOAXcEaa	yes he should pay child support! take a paternity test to find out.|`|AWb0L9IKaa	he should pay child support.
sCr2iTczaa	It depends on what you are doing, if you are just chillaxin watching a movie just talking then no but if you two are fooling around like kissing dry humping touching then yes it is very good that you do get a *****!|`|d8h5h8IVaa	It's a good thing!  That's the goal!|`|Am1wfhBDaa	No you should ask your mom if it's okay first.|`|H7cNZYIYaa	if you mean hook up like sex, you better get a hard, otherwise it won't really work lol|`|WMem5AGoaa	No she won't get freaked out or think you're weird, just flattered !|`|lGS1zOd6aa	it will be weird if she got one|`|hwIMJBVpaa	what the hell is hooking up?      i thought it was actually having sex? why am i lost? wtf? are you like 11?    EDIT: oh, ok well 13 year old boys get boners when the wind blows...so im sure it would be expected of you. haha. if you dont she might actually be offended since its not that difficult.|`|wcDy86xuaa	It's not uncommon, don't be so self conscious.  Girls are much more scared of you having a ***** while dancing with them...|`|8juUgSK2aa	if she is a hooker she is used to it. Just make sure you have plenty of money.|`|lsFDEx2oaa	Yes, its fine.  You're supposed to like and be excited by girls, right?|`|UjhWIrJ1aa	nah you'll be fine.|`|eBT0KY4Faa	it is totally normal. every guy i have just made out with has gotten one.  i would think its weird if you didnt get one haha|`|a0Vg5vMyaa	umm dude relax..it doesnt matter if its making out or sex..just go for it.|`|xfh6ke3Vaa	I'm a girl.

I am assuming that by hooking up you mean making out? If you mean sex... that's a good thing.    But again, she wont think its weird. So dont worry about it :)|`|f64elzDQaa	Thats fine, but it probably depends on the girl  If you think she might find it weird then maybe try and hide it, or take a break from making out before you get too excited  Good luck :)|`|ubdEwzcoaa	Being that your only 13 she would think that you are a weirdo.|`|AA10232348	No, I hope not?|`|dQDL8iM6aa	hey is this ALEC Portinga!!! If it is your soo busted lol. and its kinda embarrasing to ask but its all good. Your still a youngin, just relax, and stop being perverted in your head!! that'll make you a creep if your thinking nasty.
c3c4f6b1cdb5f490e1caf3ca26fd885aaa	I think that when you're IN a crowd and doing what everyone else's doing, muckin around, living in the moment, you don't really realize that you're in the wrong crowd.  But when you wake up every morning & ask yourself "If Today Was The Last Of My Life, Would I Want To Do What Im About To Do?"  If you're answer is no too many days in a row, you know you're messed up. Thats when i knew.  Sounds lame to a person who wasn't almost ruined by a crowd, but its true|`|abc74a7841250ed8830346d501f162a7aa	thats why you your must be aware of your surrounding and company you keep !|`|nDQOwAA3aa	not really sucked in i grew up with the wrong crowd and i just embraced it until some **** came up and i had to let it go|`|eloWO2piaa	Yes. I had to open my eyes fully, pack up enough courage and tell them to f*ck off.    It wasn't easy. But they were a bad influence on my life. I was doing drugs and never going to school, going clubbing underage and out all night.    People now want my blood but are too scared of my new 'clean' friends to do anything about it. Empty threats.    If you show them YOU'RE the dominant one, in charge of your own life.. and not let them push you around, they will respect you.
xfh6ke3Vaa	I think that you did the right thing. I would do the same to a guy. I actually did once. Good luck!|`|nUdbTUtHaa	The ultimatum was a good idea (let her know where you stand and you dnot want to play games) but dont you think it was a teeny bit harsh? >.    I mean her excuses didnt sound like excuses just like legit reasons she was busy.    Maybe something better to say would have been "give me a shout if you want to hit the cinema next week, if you dont contact me I'll assume you're not interested :P  ~cheers"    or something >.|`|lsFDEx2oaa	Woahhhh, easy killer.  You were playing it just fine before the text.      She asked you to the cinema, right?  Why put more thought into planning it?  Let her tell you when.  A week is seven days.  I'm assuming this is either a Thursday or a Friday.  Which means, yes she is busy packing, getting ready to go.  Saturday and Sunday are out for obvious reasons.  Monday she WILL be tired, so it was pretty doubtful she would say yes.      Keep this in mind:  she asked YOU out.  Let HER come to YOU. You were not bothering her, she enjoyed your company.  There is no reason to give her an ultimatum.  What you should have done is text her saying "hope you have fun in Brussels, don't forget to get me a souvenir".      It's OK to let her know you are interestsed, it is not OK to give her an ultimatum and tell her that you won't bother her again.      So, in summation, no, you did the wrong thing.  Patience is a virtue.|`|CfUVG6IYaa	It sounds like she might really just be very busy at this point in her life. Wait a few days (like 3-5 days) and see what happens. Give her one more chance and ask her again after a few days go by. Then if she doesn't respond I guess it's time to move on. Good luck!|`|mhLrK3naaa	what is the question?
t3Zfddchaa	yes so leave it alone...b4 u ruin a friendship|`|2Cw0DfaSaa	you love him as a friend but your not attracted to him in any other way. yeah i get it..
WOHc22Xiaa	Let her go for visits but obviously she lives with you for a good reason if the court gave her to you. Don't give up on them  no matter how old they get they will always be your babies.|`|AzIBXcqxaa	She is at the age where she would want to be living with whomever will give her the most freedom to do what she wants. That's not always a good thing. If her mom is irresposible for God's sake keep her with you!|`|WyCmQBuvaa	How about trying it out on a temporary basis.|`|QieRAMLkaa	honestly, take her to counceling and keep her where she is....she might hate you for it but her mother sounds like she isn't responsible enough for children to be fully in her care.  Your daughter sounds a little distressed and is probably confused as to what she wants herself.   Shes a pre teen, these things are going to happen.    really   take her to counceling, one day she may even thank you|`|xFEuN9Vhaa	Sounds like she is going through THAT change and wants her mom.  It's normal.  Let her go live with her mom and let her know that she can come home any time she wants to.      However, you did not say anything about how the mom feels.  Will she welcome her 12 year back into her home?|`|cGbTJobeaa	I wouldn't let her move back with her mom simply because you two are going through a difficult time together.  All she is going to learn from that lesson is to avoid her problems.    Part of the reason she wants to live with her mom is because she only knows "weekend mom" versus "full-time dad."  Be sure you show her your fun weekend dad side of yourself.  Spend some fun time with her going to the movies or another activity she enjoys.|`|jkgl9WMgaa	To be honest, courts rarely give custody to the father unless there is a really good reason not to give custody to the mother.  So, unless the mother has completely changed her life, it may not be the best thing to send your daughter to live there.  She does, however, need help dealing with the anger and confusion she is feeling. Being split between to parents is very hard on a kid, and every daughter does have a great need for a good mother/daughter relationship.  If it is safe for her to be with her mother, you might try agreeing to let her spend more time with her.  If her mother is not the "great escape" she dreams it will be, she will realize it herself.  You may also want to find an adult woman who can spend time with your daughter and give her the opportunity to bond with a "mother figure".  A local church would be a great place to find someone trustworthy and willing to help.  If her emotional problems are severe or you fear she may do something dangerous, I would definitely get her counseling.|`|GoPYrjRlaa	no, there was a good reason the courts gave her to you.|`|4eurlgWCaa	Get a phicologist to help, you need to find out why she wants to move, also to help her to express her emotion in a better way than running away cause that can be dangerous and its a sign that you also cannot control her, i think you might be a great father, just that professional help can help you to improve showing you what are her special needs. Also i think it wont be good to separate the sisters, that can be bad for both, but mostly for the younger cause she its not the one taking the decision, but suffering all those separations
xIlIbZJtaa	Well done for losing weight! If it's a decent man he honestly won't care one bit. It probably hasnt even occured to your boyfriend. Best thing to do is to stop looking at your body in the mirror as this makes every woman hate a part of herself and it's easy to get obsessed. Then go out and buy some flattering underwear that boosts your bust. Try a few things as there are some that give a really good look to even the saggiest! Keep the underwear on while having sex as it will be much better simply because you will feel sexier and therefore act sexier (not saying you're not already!) Also buy some ' chicken fillets' as putting them in your bra has the same effect as a boob job. You can get different sizes and you can't tell theyre in. Also, when you have a baby your body shape changes and many people get bigger and fuller. Also some contraceptive pills and the implanon implant can give you naturally fuller ones because of the hormones. Get a general make over just to give yourself a boost. Also you can use your age and experience to be a much better partner and lover. My husbands brother has a 17 yr old girlfriend and yes her body is firm but their relationship is so immature and she has not got a clue about sex so haha hope that makes you feel much better!|`|eO4y3m1maa	Start doing push ups on teh regular basis..if you want to change...

HYnBeyJsaa	If you tell the guys that you are interested in the truth then no they won't be put off. Infact, they may feel a little less secure about the situation once they find out that he's gay.|`|hwIMJBVpaa	i think the possibility of them not liking him because hes gay is a bigger one that him being a guy. then again, some guys are insecure about everything, so I dont know.|`|Ccs9LeIEaa	the kind of guys who become jealous at hearing you have a gay male roommate are not the kind of men you want to date anyway :)|`|uDRajB1oaa	UMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM...      YA!|`|veZLfnGFaa	No, not if you tell them the truth.  It shouldn't matter to them.|`|d5COR2S2aa	hmmm... depends. you have to explain to ur potential mate that ur roommate is gay though, or else he'll get the wrong idea. in reality, i think that most males would be sorta weirded out by this... but gay friends are really nice =/|`|trMaIiicaa	As long as they trust you, it shouldn't be a problem. I live with 5 other guys, and two other girls. And my boyfriend goes to school a little over an hour away, and we are doing just fine. He trusts me and also - house-cest is not cool, and I would never do anything with them anyways.|`|AA10232348	YES! A dude is a dude even if he likes dare I say, guys. EEEWWWW! That is nasty! Gross! Disgusting!
1lOzRfT1aa	Sounds like you have a good head on your shoulders and plenty  of rationally about yourself|`|yj3GT7jOaa	Do you feel like a sucker-fish or a flounder?|`|nDQOwAA3aa	i would have that bullshit done in 3 months and paid my half of the bills so don't worry you can find better|`|Ccs9LeIEaa	haha not at all! if anything i'd think he'd end up owing you money.     for fun, i'd gather a list of estimates on how much the repairs would have cost, and compare it to the average rents in your area, plus ultilities, food and other expenses you paid for!     good luck :)|`|hZ9omSataa	Oh yeah, that was a sweet deal for him, sex, home, food, and very little work.  Besides, guys love doing that home repair stuff more than a 9-5 office job.  We can drink @ home!!!  Yeah, he sounds like an ungrateful jerk.|`|2esGKO2Caa	Well he shouldn't complain to loudly. For one thing he lived there rent free and what took him 10 months to do ,should of took a month at the most. So i'd say he got off really cheap. If your looking for a roommate i'd take some of that.|`|d5COR2S2aa	no you're not being irrational. i think it's a fair trade too.|`|AA10119874	Hell, no.    There is no such thing as a free lunch.|`|d5928aef823e729cbef56cb2408fdda4aa	Umm, if he was only working 2 weekends a month, how did he save 20K and pay off all of his bills? This just doesn't add up to me.      Also, why do you care? It seems like fair trade. If you two broke up then just move on.|`|GqTSa85daa	Heck no.  He made out like a fat rat.  I would have split the bills, and still done the work because I like doing home upgrades.|`|nUdbTUtHaa	No you're not being irrational.    Hell Id come live with you for free rent and food in exchange for a little manual labor (Im good a tiling lol)|`|rIOD8tgvaa	No, you are not irrational.  He is such a jerk.  He is such a Loser.  He is such a User.  Forget him and never live with someone again.  You always lose when you are a woman and live with someone.  Get a commitment or toss them out!|`|yPU75DdIaa	ok ya need ta tell him how it is it's your house and he needs to pay rent or get his sorry *** out of there!|`|15e58edf21f33dd475298413b3cd6d8caa	you have all the reason in the world,you r right! dont think other wise.|`|qmd8nkzAaa	you're nottt being irrational at all :0.|`|mGU0h3O3aa	He is just jealous because he knows he will never find another woman to baby him. No offense, I am guilty as well! Don't let him get to you, he is just being a crybaby and is realizing he will have to work for a living, something most guys think is not reality anymore..|`|h6ZSneA7aa	I also think 10 months of work is a fair trade for 4 years of free rent, food, utilities, and paying off all his debts, and save money. You ARE being rational!!!!!!!!!|`|6oy6tQGjaa	well, he sounds dumb founded and any guy i know would take that offe in a heart beat. your ex soundsstupid and ovbiously rediculous to think no other guy would do that!|`|EJKhLW2Baa	no|`|ucxfU7pTaa	who knows? no one here can do your math as good as you. and what does it matter the relationship was good when it was good the work is good move on. your not being irrational your just wasting your time worring over what kind of deal you got. iam a carpenter ive done alot of work for my exes id hate to feel like i regret anything .move along now little .honey
143bm6cnaa	I have traveled to many countries on five continents and have been known to annoy women in most of them  None of them tolerate me.    Sorry, if you act like a child they will treat you like a child.|`|PQBEqS8Caa	haha...says a lot abt english women doesnt it?|`|7aEYC0CPaa	depends on the girl|`|uVH046Fjaa	I think I like you that assume an entire country of women are all just like the couple of people you've met. Suck it bro.|`|3jGGzCUJaa	neither questions like this do though.|`|eO4y3m1maa	I've lived in both countries, now america. I would definately say english are raised differently. American women are alot more feisty
6NbFy1KPaa	Your nickname is "candid" right?  Why not try a little of that and be honest with her about how you feel.  Let her know that you're interested in exploring the possibility of a relationship with her.  Let her know your concerns about her being a friend with your Ex.  Tell her everything you just told everyone on "Answer" and get her reaction.    Good Luck
1lOzRfT1aa	Is he giving youo the eyes are showing any kind of interest towards you by doing small little things to irritate you to hgwet your attention theres a good chance hes in to you|`|YEHkJf5faa	They flirt with you often. Tease you a lot. They smile when they see you. Love talking to you. Try to look good when they are around you. Different guys do different things, it depends! I hope this helped! good luck. :)|`|UfOP3xtcaa	they are mean to you..HA ha..|`|qsBeeRXhaa	When a guy likes you he will try and make himself seem impressive to you.   Listen to what he's saying. If he likes you, and he's nervous, he'll probably start talking about himself. Many times, guys feel the need to prove themselves- especially if you talk about another guy in his company.     Be aware of touching. He might put his hand on your arm when he laughs, and won't move his leg if it happens to touch yours, or he may hug you for small things - all are good signs of a guy liking you. But be careful because this may be a result of him just being nice to you and not fancying you.     Smile at him- a big smile in return is a good sign. Also, see if he always ends up in the same part of the room as you; perhaps he keeps going out of his way to bump into you and to flash his smile in your direction. If so, then smile back!     also notice his eye contact. If he likes you, he may either look away quickly if he is shy    hope this helped lolx|`|mJZ5tBXsaa	This is how you know if a boy likes you is if you are sitting by your self and he comes and sit with you and tries to make you laugh and always picking on you that how you know he likes you. But, everyone is different on how they act when they like someone he could be just real friendly or a nice guy.|`|UkwZbcaeaa	When you kiss him, he doesn't run away.
yPU75DdIaa	good good not all to bad for our age lol but really try something a bit deeper like   your eye's are as radiant as the sun and as calming as the full moon in the nite sky follow by the wondrous star's in your mouth   (referring to teeth here ppl)   and stuff like that ya know stuff that makes her feel especially cherished  use fancy words make it long and full of romantic stuff i  had to learn the hard way|`|PCrh5bOMaa	Thats sweet, short, simple and to the point. Dont change or add anything, leave it as it is, add your name though!|`|LGHMmRVFaa	id rather a guy show me that he likes me rather than tell me but that was really sweet|`|Q0SIuZWjaa	Aw cute, thats really nice, go for it, you'll make her day! oh and put your name on the bottom too! dont know why but it always nicer! have a good valentines day!
XNKnHt8Xaa	You must tell her.I had this problem a year ago and it was killing me seeing her with other guys and the worst thing is, she told me every detail, how they kissed, where he touched her and inside I was dying, so one day I got the courage and confessed her everything.She was confused and didn't know how to react and I said to her "If you don't want to be my best friend anymore,I'll understand".Nowadays we still talk but we are not best friends and she broke up with her boyfriend.But I must say,telling her the truth was a huge relief.I guess you should do the same|`|eo3EHDVIaa	The worst thing you can do is nothing. Deal with it or be an usher at her wedding.|`|kzkrll3Xaa	i think if you want strategy to keep getting close to her then wait until she breaks up with bf... or is at least having a hard time with him ;)|`|u7zmUivHaa	how is she your best friend and u only found out she has a boyfriend today unless she is your only friend then she will be ur best un and if ur both "best friends" then you dont fancy each other your just "best friends"|`|8PO93dFZaa	tell herrr|`|HnccCVlVaa	Just tell her that you like her and see what he says|`|aPt19Z8vaa	Im guessing, that she DID like you. But you never asked her out, so she moved on. Try to talk to her about it. And if she breaks up with her boyfriend dont be right there waiting to ask her out, be there to comfort her and maybe like a day after ask what she thinks of you.|`|zWX5GDehaa	talk to her about it and see how she feels|`|RW2D2VlMaa	Stay friends as normal with her untill she breaks up with this guy (if she does of course) Then tell her! x|`|oSmFTHQ5aa	hey its better tht you tell her whtz in your heart otherwise i think she might get out of your hands.jus tell her how much you LOVE her|`|zhTcwCI1aa	If you really have strong feelings for her then you should tell her how you feel..your going to get tired of trying to ignore them and deal with it...and then, good or bad, at least youll know the truth and you wont always have to wonder...|`|8AkgUGapaa	You should really talk with her and ask her does she have feelengs about you because maybe she likes you but she thinks that you just want to be her friend... If she won`t wanna be with you then stay friends with her and find a person who deserve your love ... Good luck! =)|`|jEGf0ZyAaa	your problem is quite complicated.it is so rude to ruin others relationship but at the same time it is not fair to let yourself being like that.i suggest you to have a talk with her in the best way.but do not force her to make up her mind about this matter.at the same time,try to find another girls.may be this way can make you feel good again!good luck
Q5FYrU9vaa	Hes trying to play his gf in my opinion. If he wants to get with u tell him he has to break up with his gf and you proof that he did. But i see him as a player so i guess its better not to get involved
iqrXIQctaa	First and Foremost, it is very important that in any relationship there is trust and loyalty. If that isn't present things wont work, or they will be tough.     Here is my advice, confront her. Tell her you know that it was a lie try not to be mean or rude but tell her how you feel. That is unfair that she expects you to be honest and then she lies to you.    However, make sure you are positive it is a lie before you confront her, and if its a small thing then don't make it any bigger than it is. Either way you should confront her.     I use to be the same way, I gave my ex of four years chance after chance after chance, when he did the same things over and over. Lies are a big deal no matter how small. No one is perfect but if you love someone you are suppose to try your best to be honest with them.    Hope this helps, Good luck hun =]|`|05a7db5c0750ff490fc2e1ecfbac7616aa	the same way with my ex she will not admit that she cheated on me with many guys and wanted to get back with me. Then she ceated again so now we are friends|`|1lOzRfT1aa	Once she tod the first lie she'll have to tell anopther to cover the first one so keep your eyes wide open|`|jkgl9WMgaa	Run! As fast as you can. Trying to get her to admit will only be to benefit your own pride.  If you know for sure that she is a liar, why do you want to be with her?|`|KZlgdMeEaa	no fun being played its the hard thing in life to recover from with ur self esteem still in tact... cant start a over with a lie in way still. It will creep up on u and always be there.|`|UfOP3xtcaa	I  am in the same situation with my baby daddy :) and no matter how much i love him and want things to work i know that they never will because one lie turns into another and so on. So it is not worth my time. And i don't want to spend the rest of my life getting lied to. So until the truth can be admitted then i would move on.
eO4y3m1maa	Relax, just ask him if he wants to come over one day or if he wants to link up to go to a movie!    Its alot easier to do then to talk about it.. (i know you usually hear the opposite)    Hes just as nervous as you are I SWEAR!|`|zhTcwCI1aa	Instead of asking him out on an official date and to be ur boyfriend..  just ask him what he's doin this weekend, and just be like well if u wanna we could go catch a movie or something? or we could watch a movie at my place? just something so its like ur asking him to go on a date without actually saying its a date
1lOzRfT1aa	Find out about his special interests like music, what he want to do with his life, does he like dogs ,what hobbies he has,likes and dislikes|`|zOIgzIy4aa	start out with hi! how are you? then find out what he,s interested in, like maybe cars then start talking about that.|`|XNKnHt8Xaa	You can talk about his likes and dislikes,family,future,profession and stuff like that|`|vRQpcUwoaa	Well, I'd say you want to see if he fits you as a BF, eh? so start asking him about the properties you value in men... talk about women, ask him about himself, what does he like, dislikes, what does he like in women(this one will get his attention on u).|`|r0M7gVP7aa	How about "What was your New Years Resolution?" or "If you had to be a color/condiment/ice cream flavor what would you be?" Or "If every dessert was available to you but you could only eat one thing, what would you pick?" Or "What's your favorite childhood memory?"|`|RvFwmQOPaa	Start off asking him about his interest and hobbies. It wouldn't hurt to catch up on the latest sport scores and teams. guys are really into the Superbowl that is coming up. Ask him who he is rooting for. Ask him about his future goals, school , family and friends. Don't ask too many questions though. you may sound like you're investigating him. Add your own thoughts and interest to see if you both have anything in common and play off of that. Throw some humorist stories in the conversation to show that you can have a good time and that you have a funny personality.Talk about something that you have been through and ask does he have any embarrassing stories to tell.|`|EJKhLW2Baa	talk about his background and/or ask him out/ ask him to go to a party etc. ask him about the film etc. good luck!
ai33g11Maa	Italian food is always good, how about spaghetti or home-made pizzas on ciabatta?  If she likes fish, then bake some salmon in the oven and serve with fresh vegetables.  If she doesn't mind beef, then how about a nice steak, some home-made potato wedges and a nice fresh caesar salad?      Drink-wise, lambrini is very cheap sweet white wine, so go for something a bit nicer, but stick to medium or sweet white.  If you must use that stuff (it is her favourite after all) then mix it with some orange juice or lemonade.    Have fun!|`|AhO0Uoppaa	haha lambrini "classy" is it still 1.99 a bottle? if her fav drink is lambrini then kebab and chips would be a romantic meal to her.    how about a lambrini and lemonade cocktail, you could call it a "chav-rini!?|`|VaA74PCZaa	Go to a restaurant then you won't have to cook.|`|AA11169105	Lambrini girls will eat anything with a "Mc" in front of it.|`|QEEweJUaaa	You could cook chicken stir fry and for dessert strawberries and cream.|`|uDRajB1oaa	for a drink:  POACHED PEACHES IN CHAMPAGNE     Fresh peaches poached in champagne need to be tasted to be really appreciated.    2 large ripe peaches, preferably white  2 cups dry champagne  1/2 cup maple syrup  1/2 small vanilla bean  3 large strawberries  2 tablespoons powdered sugar  1/4 medium lemon, squeezed for juice  1 cup Romance Whipped Cream, see recipe  2 large mint leaves for garnish    Make a very light incision all around peach skins. Plunge the peaches briefly into boiling water, then into cold water, and peel. Place in a shallow pan and douse with champagne. Add the syrup and vanilla bean. Bring to a slow boil over low heat, and poach peaches at about 185F, but do not allow to boil. If peaches are very ripe, they will be poached after 5 minutes.    Place peaches and syrup in a cool place, but do not refrigerate. Drain peaches, reserving the poaching liquid. Wash strawberries, remove any leaves, and pure in a blender or food processor.

CfUVG6IYaa	It sounds to me like she likes you, but doesn't want to give up on the guy back home. She is trying to be true to him. Which is sad because god only knows what he is doing while she's away... you know? Hang in there, he will probably cheat on her and then she'll be free again. In the meantime, if you really like her and if you can be patient, just be her friend so she will know she can turn to you once he's out of the picture. Or maybe she will just decide she likes you better!|`|91ACjB5eaa	hi  Are you flirting with her?  maybe that makes her kinda forget her b.f/ boyfriend or whatever at the moment. its sad but so true that, some people with a boyfriend or a girlfriend, can still get crushes on someone else at the same time.  maybe she's just being weird b.c she's away from home, and away from this guy.  try just being there for her as a friend.  i married my b.f last year and im closer to him then anyone all b.c are friendship turned to friendship on fire.  if she can trust and depend on you as a friend, it just might open the door to something greater. if you care for her you will wait.    i bet shes just out-of-it, shell come around|`|U4MyeZd2aa	Tell her everything youre thinking, because it cant get any worse, can it? It's not worth losing any sleep over.|`|UfOP3xtcaa	She want you to be able to read her mind. So simply tell her that is impossible for you.

Run!.. the problem is, they're supposed to be "friends" but one is telling u the other doesn't like u, now that one likes u? but yet they're still "boys for life". thats how it goes sweetie. plzzz dont fall for this.

nCWjdyddaa	I cannot believe you have put up with this for more than one week. Why would you feel obligated to subjugate your own husband's needs to those of your brother? It's their kid, and they are responsible for it.    Give them two weeks to find someone else, and then you're gone. Don't let them stretch it out, or you'll never get out of there. When they see that NOBODY else is going to do what you do for anywhere near the amount of money you're getting, they might get some appreciation. I say might, because, from your description, it's possible that they are so self-absorbed and clueless that they'll never get it.    At any rate, you need to look after yourself and your husband. Tell them TODAY, and stick to the two-week limit. Good luck to you.|`|R8fEO8tUaa	tell your brother that if he doesnt pay and treat you like he would any othe babysitter, you will quit and take up a better job out of town|`|SE9bAo4Naa	you could just at first tell him "i need a break and that you feel under appreciated|`|AA11674544	BLAME YOUR HUSBAND! Tell your husband first, and then, with his approval, explain to your brother that your husband is not happy with the arrangement and wants you to quit. Give your brother 2-3 weeks notice and MOVE ON. You know this can't continue forever. You are not happy and you need to do something else. You know that the right thing to do is to not damage your relationship with your brother. So, be polite, tell him it was fun while it lasted (even if it wasn't), but that you need to work a job where you can be home more for your husband. He will understand even if he doesn't like it. You must learn to say no! You think you are doing your brother a favor, but really you are making a terrible choice by staying and resenting him! Your lack of ability to tell your brother the truth, and just resent him is not fair to him, or you! MOVE ON!!!!! For both your sake, your brother's sake, and your husband's sake!|`|jkgl9WMgaa	I would put in a two weeks notice and find another job! A brother who is demanding and expects extra without paying you usually feels entitled to such.  You would be better explaining that you need to "move back home" in order to keep your marriage relationship healthy and then move on.  You don't even have to bring it all up if you don't want to. You could demand your rights, but when dealing with family, sometimes it is better to just let it go and do something to make it better.  I'm sure you love your brother or you wouldn't be doing all that for him.  In my opinion, if you don't change the situation, the relationship with your brother and your husband will be hurt in the long run.
mkrKHQvFaa	Well to me (I just went to a show 2 weeks ago).  The one that caught my eye is the one that said BRIDAL FAIR SPECIAL.  If you booked that day you got $20.00 off hair and makeup.  If you brought it with you to your appt. you got $10.00 off.  It listed her service and a few one to two sentence testimonials.  Do you travel or do you require people to come to you?  Do you have full party specials?  Put one of your favorite pictures of hair and makeup on the front.  Where are you located at?  Good luck!    PS stay away from neon paper.  That was gotty to me.|`|8g51eBf1aa	Have it be a 3 fold brochure. Have the prices, services, hours of operation, phone  , and maybe a loco or tag line.

(Updo's preferably.)|`|757f10afa027007eb6d9e797f2776feaaa	Well, it depends on your layout. If its a single-sheet flier, you dont want to list too much or its going to look messy. Do you have a website that lists everything?  If you are folding or using multiple sheets, you could list everything with prices.   If you dont like what you are making, hire a pro.

He was in a relationship with this woman for 4 years and only thought to commit when she was done with him. This was probably a big issue and important for her to in taking the relationship to the next level. It is only natural to expect a man to marry you after he allows you into his life for a long period of time. When they don't ask you it makes you wonder if they are waiting for something better to come along. Marriage makes a loud statement that they can see you forever in their life and it allows the people around you to take your relationship more seriously to invest their emotions into the both of you to. For instance what if one of you were in a life threatening situation in a hospital neither one of you would have any say so about life support or how that situation would be handled. What if someone in the family turned against one of you at this time and had one or the other escorted out of the hospital because things like this have happened.  After 6 years if this man cannot commit to you then it tells you a whole lot about his character and what he does not see with you. It makes you wonder how a man can stay in long term relationships and what his issues are in not taking it any further?  You can love somebody but it doesn't always mean that they are right for you or that you can continue on with them only on their terms.|`|7e8be8f471de4c60d8884f52a597ddc2aa	talk to him and see|`|veZLfnGFaa	She must have really hurt him.  If I were you, I would get all this out in the open.  If he never plans to marry you, you need to know.  If you are happy in a relationship like this stay, but if you're looking for a ring, it doesn't sound like you are going to get one.|`|9Jnf5jRQaa	I think it was very easy for him to say that to his ex because they were no longer together so there was no chance of them getting married.  I think he probably said it just to hurt her.  I'm sure if you broke up, he'd say the same thing to you.  I wouldn't worry too much about it.  But if you are looking to get married, and he's not... it might be time for you to decide if you want to stay or go.|`|77ZVd5hyaa	I have a rule after one year of being together, it's either marriage or the highway.|`|NNHdkLDWaa	And why is your bf only good enough for you if he proposes marriage ?|`|RoEyFm5yaa	TELL HIM HOW YOU FEEL AND HE MIGHT OPEN UP TO YOU.|`|qXCSWQpdaa	Then why are YOU still considering him YOUR boyfriend?    His actions, or lack of actions, speak LOUDER than his words, or lack of words.|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	I think if you have been with him for this long you should be bale to talk to him. Ask him why she was good enough and why your not.
eO4y3m1maa	Ex's are ex's for a reason...    but thats true if he hasnt dated anyone before let him see what he's missing out on! Let him date other girls who will only make him want to come back to you..and you should date too...    Ask your older friends how many boyfriends they had before they got married.. don't be silly! I'm 24 and I have a boyfriend...I've had about 4-5 before him. 2 of which I had before i graduated high school that I honestly don't count because relationships back then compared to relationships now were NOTHING.    But I know its important to you now, and I know you like him....but trust me ..he will come back if its meant to be. Go out and have fun!!|`|029d970e89f49628d1a27a4f7084f48faa	He's obviously curious about what else is out there. No offense to you - it's just something he wants to get out of his system before he settles down. You should be glad he was honest with you, and you need to take this time to do the same soul-searching. You might always regret not knowing what else you might've been, or done, with your life - so get out there and find out. No sense moping over this guy. If it's meant to be, you'll end up together despite what happens in between.|`|7e8be8f471de4c60d8884f52a597ddc2aa	Give him his time and you go on with yours. If it is meant to be then it is if not at least you moved on and were not waiting for him|`|Kh9Wzrhyaa	You could wait for two months to see if the pattern repeats itself. Of course, if it does you have to ask yourself how much longer you want to put up with it because it will be a well-established behavioral pattern. Maybe he should realize what he has in you and be grateful instead of worrying about what he is supposedly missing out on. Just a thought.|`|a2b21f2cee1471018ba8eafddb953922aa	findd someone else. hes playing games with you.|`|AB3D5gIJaa	well if he asks you out again say no becuase there's a chance that he will do it again but if you think it's the right think gettin back together wit him is the right thing to do go ahead i anit stopin u just think about wut u do b4 u actually do it but i fi were u i wouldn't get bak wit him atlease now right away take some time and try to figure out if u think he wont breake you heart again then go out wit him again but if u think it's juz goin to be the same thing over agian i suggest u dont just to be save not try to hang out wit other guy more to get over ur EX it would be better 4 both of u.|`|WBpVZpb0aa	Move. On. I cannot say it enough. And I say it out of concern. I've been in that situation, but on your ex's end of things, and I just kept doing it over and over to my boyfriend, because he let me. And it ended up ruining any chance we had with each other in the future. We're still friends, now I'm just way way over him.|`|AA11137908	Uh yea. You might want to try dating someone else yourself. I say that because if he's done this already, then he will more than likely do it again. Don't allow him to keep hurting you like that. Put your foot down because if he knows he can always come back, he will always do what he's been doing.|`|MjbLGaegaa	try and get over him cause it seems to me he is just using you - when he feels like having a relationship he gets back together with you, and when he doesnt want a relationship he dumps you.     if you give it time and try not to speak to him or meet up with him you will get over him and find someone else, in time :)    he will be gutted when he realises your with someone else - and he will understand how silly he was to ever let you go!|`|7681dcb3811417e1d3133b75a5d45328aa	It sounds like your boyfriend wants to have his cake and eat it too. He probably knows you are a great girl, but wants to be able to do things with other girls. And, I am sure if you began seeing other guys he would not be happy with that? That is a clear sign your boyfriend is wasting your time. Maybe you can have a girls night on Friday and ask your friends who see what is going on for their advice (let them know you will not hold it against them and really listen to what they say). Love can be blinding, and sometimes letting go can help you rather than holding on and hurt more in the end.
QgKAL3sEaa	that's so difficult. you have to be honest, follow your heart. but bear in mind how difficult this time is. i'm sure he'll respect your honesty. good luck and all the best!|`|uQpAIkhwaa	despite the fact that he has cancer shouldnt make you feel like you have to stay with him. simply explain to him that your not happy.
2o3BHgCCaa	It is very much up to the couple and not the people attending the wedding.   She has absolutely no right to complain unless she pays for your wedding. If she does complain then tell her she can do (or did) what she wanted at her wedding so you can do what you want at yours.|`|ifgzHzA3aa	This is one of those "can of worms" questions.  You'll never get a common consensus.  In my opinion, a wedding is an adult affair, just like a cocktail party or new years party.  There is drinking involved and is not a place for children.  The only exception could possibly be the children directly involved in the wedding, such as nieces, nephews, etc.  And even then, I think they should leave after dinner.  Again, my opinion.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	Absolutely NOT they ALWAYS cause problem,s they get whiny and cranky they have temper tantrums, they steal all the attention and they make everyone's life a living hell, I never understand when people include them and I would never even attend a wedding where kids were allowed.|`|0F8hauikaa	Personally what I like about weddings is that there are people of all ages having fun together, but it's your wedding so you have the right to do what you want. Kids do tend to get bored at adult functions. I think it might depend on how well behaved they are. If they are little terrors I wouldn't want them there either. You might tell your sister that their attendance is conditional on their behavior and that she will be required to take them home or have them picked up if they cause any problems.|`|LLeQyWGcaa	i think they should be allowed but with supervision. i have been to some weddings where the parents let the kids run around like little animals. i think your sisters kids will be fine but will probably get bored soon so if your sister would like to stay make arrangements for the children to go some place else, later in the evening.|`|4lL34wJnaa	I definitely think children SHOULD BE ALLOWED at weddings.  I see a wedding ceremony as the joining of 2 families and families usually include children.      Also, if you go back hundreds of years, it was thought of as mandatory to have children at weddings because there was no marriage license or legal documentation of marriage way back when.  This way when people got married they had a child witness the ceremony and that child can stand up for the couple if anyone denies that marriage, even after all the adult guests have passed away.  This idea of having children witness a marriage is where our modern-day flower girl and ring-bearer ideas come from.|`|iKYNUni0aa	Well its your day so it shouldnt matter i dont think it wrong not to invite them adults have more fun when they dont have to worry about watching them and keeping an eye them! plus it will save you a headache and money|`|XZlFLecLaa	yes to the wedding   no to the reception    thats acceptable.|`|egqveuPjaa	Children or not, they are still family. The whole point of a wedding is celebrating your love with friends and family- regardless of age!|`|RvddYKqjaa	Your first question was should they be allowed at weddings, and my answer is a definite yes. Anyone can attend a wedding, invited or not.   I think kids should be at the reception too, especially his own relatives. That decision is yours, but at a party, I can't imagine why children wouldn't be invited to join in. If I couldn't bring my kids to your reception, I would just not attend it, but I would be at the wedding, with the children. If you don't want kids, you don't want kids, but it's not worth a family feud. If you have to pay "per head" I understand the expense involved, but I would rather have the relatives and take someone else off the list. His sister's kids will be able to say they danced at their uncle's wedding, and that's pretty neat.|`|caa265fc73cd7f24fe83d9a186ac1af9aa	It is whatever you & your fiance decide.  You are the hosts of the party and it is your choice who to invite.    Be aware that if you choose an 'adults only' event, you will have alot of grumbling.    If alot of people have to travel and stay overnight, I think the right thing to do is include the children because an overnight sitter at home is hard to come by and many people wouldn't be comfortable leaving their child with a stranger in their hotel room in a strange town.|`|AA11603468	I think they belong at any reception where the COUPLE wishes to have them there. I believe this is the sole discretion of the couple. We had children at ours, but that was our wish. I am all in support of couples who wish to host an adults-only reception.|`|LAXbJfvwaa	It really depends on a number of things whether a couple invites kids or not to their wedding.    We did not invite kids - our reasoning was that we didn't have much to do with any of the kids in our family (they are all kids of cousins who we don't see very often).  We also wanted the parents to be able to spend the full night with us - instead of having to go home early because their kids were tired.  Everyone that came actually enjoyed a night off from having to look after their kids too - it is important as a parent that you still have time for yourself (even if your kids are the most important thing in your life!)    Having said that - I think kids can be lovely to have at weddings.  They make a nice family atmosphere and can bring some entertainment as well to the proceedings!!!  After all - it is a joining of two people AND their families.    But really - it is up to the couple and what they want.  If you have good reasons for not wanting to invite kids then explain this to those people who want to bring their kids along.  If they still do not understand, then they don't have to come to the wedding - and it will be their loss.      Mind you - if the child is still young enough to be breast feeding then they should be included because they need a lot of care and will be asleap for half the time anyway.  And if someone says they can't find a babysitter or something along those lines then maybe you can help them out by finding an option for them?  My cousins ended up putting their kids together in one house being babysat by a distant relative - it worked out great for them.|`|52e1044b00e7fe6ffc7e96609443787daa	I wouldn't have a problem with a five and eight year old at my wedding. That being said, when I get married I will make sure to point out that babies and toddlers will not be allowed at the ceremony (when we exchange our vows). I do not want my vows interrupted by a screaming child.|`|g09x06Zpaa	As a child I was very clingy and cried whenever my mom went anywhere. ...I still hang out with mom and I'm 18. I think it would be a little cruel to the children to seperate them.|`|44Sj3bsZaa	I think it is perfectly fine to have children at weddings. They might cry and misbehave but so what. Children are beautiful little creatures. I don't understand what the big deal would be unless you plan on having a drunk fest reception with inappropriate dancing. Remember, you too were a child once.|`|4SyINs07aa	i think the 8 year old should come because they seem more mature. The 5 year old might be a pain|`|8e8567b844b0b4f44175063cd920c8aeaa	Is it wrong to bring children to a marriage reception. Allow them to know the intricacies of life.    Once they reach the marriage hall, they are not bothered about the bride and the groom. They look forward to their own group of children, make friendship and spread innocent love|`|tRhRjYsLaa	Yes I think that they should be allowed to go to the wedding they want to celebrate a new member joining the family. Its not like there is really anything inappropriate about a wedding except drinking. I would be complaining if someone didn't invite me to a wedding.|`|h4UzjZVnaa	It's your day. And you get to have whatever you want! I would say anyone younger than 10, doesn't need to be at a reception.|`|c6v8veJgaa	I think kids are going to come whether you want them to or not.  Weddings are family events, so people bring their family (including kids).  Although, I agree that they are sometimes a pain to deal with, you do have to account for them.    I had friends who wouldn't go anywhere without their kids, so if we said 'no kids allowed' they wouldn't have come.|`|P9wMY4Zpaa	why wouldnt you want children there? i thought the point was to be surrounded by all your loved ones...and don't you love the kids in your life?|`|IMzza26Aaa	I think it should totally be up to the bride and groom.  If people with kids don't want to attend without their children them let them stay home.  It never bothered myself or my husband if we were invited to a wedding and our child wasn't.|`|b2Cr9E5Gaa	if your children are apart of your wedding party, and your asking guests not to bring kids, I think things could get a little messy, peoples feelings will be hurt, and youll have guests upset.  But if your not inviting children period to your reception, or ceremony, or none are even apart, I dont see any reason why this is such a problem.  Spread the word that its more adult orientated, and you want your guests to enjoy the night unaccompanied by there children, plus kids are expensive, for our reception, it costs us just the same for children unless there under 5 in which the meal is 1/2 price..we have a lot of children so in this instance, we are asking that children not to attending, however, I know there will be a few people who bring there kids, and as long as we know this ahead of time, then I am ok with it, but I am not paying for one of my cousin to bring her 5 children, with enough notice, finding a sitter should not be an issue and if it is, send me your regrets. Plus my nieces and nephews will be apart of the ceremony, so in my case its a little difficult to ban children completly, alls we can do is suggest parents find sitters, however we have spread the word that after 9pm, its highly recommended people find a babysitter, as this is when we are opening up our reception to friends we couldnt invite, and the crowd may not be appropriate for younger children.  Ive said it before, but just be sure that if you do say no children, then dont even allow one to slip through the cracks, it wont be fair to the rest of your guests.|`|uuMCGT9taa	I help plan weddings and one thing i always tell a couple is think of the venue first . is it child safe and friendly ? cause the kids are old enough to where they will go wonder off and may get into a little trouble.     If you dont want kids there tell people the reception hall / venue doesnt allow children so they cant come then tell people who work there ur rule and to inforce it.     they did it and it worked 2 people tried to bring there kids and at the door the one couple wasnt let in and the other couple got passed them but seen them and let them know they had to leave the property. its just easier with out kids.    ive seen kids put there hands on the brides dress , and get it dirty. they cry during speeches or the vows,   put there hands in the cake b4 it gets cut,.    tell ur sister that its more important for her to attend but if she feels that strongly about it shell have to wait to she the pictures.    both my sis & bro had no kids it was nice|`|MTr14Obbaa	It is your day and your wishes are the most important. Have you considered setting up a babysitter for the few folks that might need one during that time? I know that some churches (if that is where you will be married) can help you arrange for a couple of reliable teens to watch the kids. Or perhaps some of your friends have a younger sibling that would be available? I have been at a couple of weddings where this was done. One used a hotel room for the children and babysitters (2 sitters and maybe 5 kids), another used a smaller lounge at the country club and hired a sitter from a service (also a small number of kids).|`|ge3meKYEaa	We didn't invite children and when we explained it to my husband sister's they understood better.    1. There was an open fire place at place.  2. Open bar- lots of drinking.  3. Smoking outside on the deck- which was on a lake.  4. Adult Dance music.    My one sister inalw gave me an earful but when I asked her if she would take her sons to a club or bar- her thoughts changed.  And I said do you want your children to see your family members drunk or tispy- she really changed her mind.  Then it quickly became a FUN night out for the parents instead.  His other sister were thrilled they had an excuse to go out without the kids- saying the last couple wedding were hard, becasue they left early when people started drinking and some of the music was not child friendly.    We did NOT offer babysitting and everyone attended most people feel more comfortable having a person watch their children in their home or have a grandparent watch them.  We didn't have any issue or anyone complain after we explained it.  Most parents were happy to have a night out.|`|ge7QGN9Zaa	Like everything else there are guidelines.    What does the couple want?  Is the venue child-friendly?  Ages of the children?  Are the parents responsible about supervision?  Time of the wedding and reception?  Cost of adding children to reception?  Will there be an excess of drinking?    If and when I get married again, I would like it in an Antebellum home (I live in the South). Many would not be child friendly (or should I say that the children would not be friendly to the home). So no children. However I just moved into one of the homes here and if I used it, I wouldn't have to worry so much about them breaking something as opposed to a rental.    Also, I have 3 cousins that are known for not watching their children (7 kids among them) and letting them run and be totally out of control. I would prefer that they not attend but rather than start a family feud (it is already at this point during holidays), I would let them come or hire a babysitter to take them to a game center or movie.    Also some see a wedding as a time for drinking to excess. I would not want to have that kind of behavior in front of kids.    It is up to the couple in the long run.|`|884v4VhGaa	As long as you invite the kids to the wedding it's ok. But don't try to pretend that it's because there'll be drinking. If people are going to be drinking to excess why are you inviting them without warning the bartender to keep an eye on them? Admit that it's because you want an adult-only evening, and people will be much happier.     And remember - people might choose to not attend if they can't bring their kids. It's their prerogative, and you don't get to be upset about that.|`|vtW3qPZmaa	Depends on the kids, the parents and the couple in question.    I'm from a huge extended family - if everyone is invited to a wedding, including kids, we're looking at a guest list of 350 minimum.  One of the reasons I'm not flying home to get married is that I don't want the giant wedding.  We haven't banned kids from the event, but we don't have any people attending with kids any older than 2, and she's going to be out flower girl.  All the people who have kids at the ceremony during the day have organised for babysitters in the evening so that they can have the evening to themselves.     I say it depends on the parents because there are a hell of a lot of truly awful parents out there who have no control over their offspring and see no issues with their misbehaving.  If you have friends/family with respectful kids and parents, there's no issue.  If not, however, I see no problems with excluding them from the occasion.  Of course, I also have no issues with telling people exactly why I don't want their little darlings in attendance - it all depends on how honest you're willing to be.|`|2rq2v8weaa	No...cause then you would be ruined and not want to have your own children.  hehe ;)|`|GytKvNFoaa	depends on their ages, and still make it more adult than child friendly, and if the parents have problems with some of the behavior then they can deal with it.|`|Ep2uYJQDaa	Of course they should be able to come but only if they are quiet!|`|mbv2jLqDaa	It'd be rude to not invite his niece and nephew to celebrate your big day!  Of course children can be loud and run around at events like this, but you have to trust their parents that they will keep their children in order.  Try to have a little something there for the kids to do, it'll occupy them.  Or maybe you could talk to his sister and work something out.|`|8dRhiDRNaa	My sister is going through this right now.  Honestly, it's a personal choice.  For one thing, having kids there can be more expensive as you have to pay per child as well (even though maybe at a discount).  If you really don't want children there, try having a night wedding.  The reception will then happen at a time that is perhaps past their bedtime!  Plus I feel like parents are often relieved to have a night out alone without having to worry about watching their kids.  Good Luck!|`|GLTAtHtoaa	Of course I don't know the kids you are referring to but I think weddings are family events and I don't see how they could be a distraction at something like a reception.  If their parents let them run wild then they need to be advised that they need to keep a close eye on them.|`|AzoBLpHNaa	I think it depends a lot on the type of reception you choose to have. My husband has a twin brother and another brother. And all of our weddings were completely different!!! His older brother and wife had a very elegant wedding reception. Think rented china, seated dinner, open bar, huge ballroom in a reception hall, etc. There were several small children there (under the age of 8). They were all well behaved. The twin brother and his wife had a beach wedding and my SIL has many younger cousins. Although being a beach wedding it was a family event and even though the wedding was on the beach, the children were very well behaved (and there were 3 or 4 under the age of 4). When we got married we had an outdoor reception and many of our friends/family had little ones (11 children under the age of 10 with the 2 youngest being under a year). We made accomodations for the children so they would have a great time and be entertained as well. They each got a special little goody bag with crayons, coloring books, and, as we had a very relaxed wedding in which the bridesmaids wore denim skirts and the groomsmen wore dress jeans, each bag came with a little cowboy/cowgirl hat and a sherriff's badge. They had a great time and they played with each other in an area that we had designated "kid friendly". We also made sure that they had a kid option so they got to have a hotdog or a cheesburger. They all had a blast, as did we. I wouldn't change it for the world!!! And they also got to have fun with us and their families by dancing and playing and it is a fun family event that they still remember to this day.  So I think it depends on: A) the type of reception you plan on having (although all receptions can be made kid friendly) and B) how well behaved are the children and are the parents willing to keep an eye on them and not be over by the open bar taking shots with the bridal party.   Hope this information helps :)|`|OHGJkcFPaa	I'm getting married this year also, however our situation is a little different.  My fiance has a daughter who lives with us and who will be our flower girl.  We also have several immediate neices and nephews so we wouldn't want them to miss our special day.    We also have a lot of friends and distant relatives with many children and the thing is, you still have to pay for their food and hope they don't run around and ruin moments at the ceremony and reception.  We also want the parents to have a good time.    Our plan is to include an additional note card in our invitations to people that have children that tell them that we regret that due to our limitations of guests etc we are having an adult only day with the exception of bridal party children and immediate family children.    We will find some good way to say it, very tactful but to the point.  Once we make this rule we plan on making NO exceptions and are still debating the possibility of children of peopel that are travelling from afar and have no other options.    For the reception we have a hotel attached and plan on having a room for the children to go to, including our own with a trusted babysitter who is not a guest at the wedding.    I thikn its made for a simple solution but we will see once we get the response.    Hope that helps!|`|i86oSVkjaa	As people have said, it varies--and you're the one who'll need to figure out what the consequences are for your relationships.    We're making our wedding and reception kid-friendly. Almost everyone will have to travel from different areas to come, so we're providing optional babysitting in a separate room, though people are welcome to keep their kids with them.    I've realized that my issue is.. I don't want kids at the rehearsal dinner! I want a relaxing dinner at a restaurant, one with a quiet, fancy atmosphere, and.. not kid-friendly. I'm not at all sure how our combined three sisters with young kids & babies will react, though.

hIe7qLN5aa	hmm i don't think u did anything wrong    question u need to ask is ?? is this a guy i can truely see myself with 20 years from now...if not..they y bother..move on now!!|`|y9CgveCGaa	Why kiss and tell?  How does that help anything?|`|eO4y3m1maa	I dont get this situation.    Ill recap, you were messing around with a guy, he stopped talking to you for 2 weeks so you went met his friend and started talking his friend?    Wow does that have slut stamped on your forehead. Whether you are dating seriously or not, you atleast give a year or so gap before you hit up a friend! Do you want everyone to know your business?     You were wrong in thinking you deserve respect, for you going back to this guy..maybe made him realize he liked you (since he cared enough to even tell you that bothered him)    Be careful what you do...don't sleep around in your social circle. go outside the social circle..make other friends.|`|iupKQv1Maa	why are you so worried?  theres bigger problems going on in the world.|`|qXCSWQpdaa	Who knows and really, who cares besides you?    It's YOUR life. Live it and talk about it all you want to whomever you like.    If you had healthy self esteem this would not be an issue for you.|`|iU1yT9LXaa	Dont worry about that....just forget about him...|`|kej0H1AXaa	you want to go out on a date tonight with MR. O? I'll call you tomorrow...i promise|`|HLIv7TLHaa	Perhaps you might want to soul search and see if there wasn't any alterior motive for you "talking" with the friend.      Us guys do get blasted regularly for our uncouth habit of kissing and telling and that does sound a bit like what you were doing.  That kind of disclosure is okay amongst you and your previously established friends    But when you "entrust" what could be construed as inflammatory information to a person you a)  know is a friend of the lover (read loyalty issues) and b) that you don't really know the character of.  You open yourself up a huge can of worms re: the current situation you find yourself in.|`|MYbRICxqaa	Agree to the people who said you should not have told your lovers friend. What type of person are you to tell anyone that. Your situation was not for anyone else to be included in. As you can see, the friend told your lover or whatever he is too you. You should know that friend is going to stick up for one another and you put yourself in more drama than you need.|`|764563e236641925edbeefe032c813b3aa	So, there are no other guys besides your homie and his friends, where you live? That was your first mistake, to hook up with his friend. Even though you don't owe your homie anything, it's common knowledge that a woman shouldn't date friends because they could be exchanging notes about you behind your back. The second mistake is you telling the friend about you and your homie hooking up. That's not something he would need to know until you two are talking about relationships, not the first time you meet.     If I were in your position, I'd set the homie straight and tell him that I didn't do anything with the friend. If he chooses to not believe you, he's extremely immature. Do you want an immature guy or one that can handle an adult relationship? While it's true that you're free to do what you want, it shows poor taste to get with your homie's friend. So, it's not like it isn't something you couldn't have done and not felt guilty, it's most like something you shouldn't have done because you should've known better and known that the friend would've tried to make you look bad once you told him you didn't want to see him anymore.|`|6KpZ2fIRaa	It doesn't matter what people think.  You do have the right to say whatever you want.  It's a smart idea to not kiss and tell.|`|4boTYkt7aa	There are some things that you just don't do,hooking up with his friend and talking about him is not done.I get the feeling that you already know what is wrong with what you did.Self respect is very important.
0udjgaoBaa	You started talking to his friend, thinking he would go back and put in a good word for you, well as you can see it back fired. If you and his friend never had a friendly rltshp before then there was no reason for you to try and start one,....Hope you learned your lesson.
gGZz2EGyaa	It does sound like your best friend  has problems, she needs to pull herself together otherwise she will loose all her friends.  I take it there are no problems at home which she is keeping to herself.  Based on that line I have no time for people who speak to their parents the way she does.  She is obviously a little bit jealous of you and why she is your best friend I do not know.  To be honest if it was me I would ask her out right what is the problem, if she becomes abusive or the answer is not satisfactory then I would move on to other friends.  She will have to shape up then.  You have been friends for 5 years and if this behaviour has only just started there could be something wrong.  If she has been like that all the time then please move on, you deserve better.|`|Xhivbo6zaa	You should to talk or texts her again, if she ignore you or your texts, you could dump her but maybe you need explain to her how you feel about her. I think she do have problems with her family or stuff but you could ask her parents and brothers or sisters if you can. She should be support you after you break up with bf/best friend, it is really what friends for but not her. Just try again to ask her what wrong with her. I hope this helps to you or not.|`|2Cw0DfaSaa	simple...   if you dont like the drama dont deal with it!|`|DAHBUvtLaa	tell her she is a ***** and you no longer   wish no waste time on her shitty moods.  but do it thru myspace or something. XD  add me.|`|NTUr0t3haa	I think it's time that you retire her from your 'best friend' list. You've outgrown her, your standards are higher, and you don't need this crap. So distance yourself. If she asks the reason, tell her that you are no longer willing to put up with moods, being given the silent treatment, criticized, and that's the size of it. Don't explain any further. It's simple--you are no longer willing to tolerate it. If she can't understand that, it only confirms your decision.|`|xdUjRxKzaa	You're really not going to like what i've got to say but as i am eons older than you, went through the same thing at school and saw my own daughter go through it too, then i really know what i'm talking about. She's not your best friend - that isn't how a friend behaves. Friends don't try to control you, they share with you. Don't drop her friendship altogether but make sure you have plenty of other people to socialise and hang out with (do you still use that term????) you need a best friend like her just like a hole in the head. Move on from her best buddy time and you will probably find a lot more people who want to spend time with you but didn't because of her silly stroppy attitude. You're right, she's silly, immature and rude. Besides being someones wife and a mother of three i too was a daughter and would never, ever have been rude to either of my parents - she's also disrespectful and if i was her mom, she'd get a slap across the face for being rude - it would only happen once! For 30 years i was also a personnel director so i'm a pretty shrewd judge of character.|`|pWA3gybAaa	push her off a cliff|`|RO8m9VTyaa	You seem nice and the best thing for you to do is tell her. You may find it hard but once its done then its done. If she goes moody because of it leave her because she will just drag you down more and more and MORE and I know I couldnt live like that.|`|HNSHwnJ8aa	jealousy, maybe?  sounds like you're the hot one.  or maybe you two are just on different "cycles", you know what i mean?  or maybe it's the same cycle, only while you're both on, she's real bitchy and you're real sensitive?  who knows with you girls...never been able to figure it out.|`|CA06qy8Laa	I know the type.  She is probably bipolar or depressed.  One of my good friends and I were friends with a girl like that, we always had to cater to her wants we always had do the work in the friendship it was not worth it.  I moved away and my friend continued with her for awhile and then got fed up and quit calling her and they had been friends since grade school and they have not spoken in over a year.  She never put forth any effort and she was always jealous.  It is just not worth the hassle and disappointment.|`|Gb1nodDMaa	well hon stop being soo close to her  keep alot of distance and shell learn  i had the same type of problem with mii frinds  if you want any advice email me  or add msn or bebo-  melemmabbzx  mel_emma@hotmail.co.uk|`|Anzu2Nr4aa	1. There is a possibility that she is jealous.  2. What you need to do is talk to her about it.   Tell her how you feel and take a risk. It will be hard but its something you have to do. but don't be mean about it.. Calm voice is best.   If she freaks out then I think thats a huge redlight saying that you need to find a new best friend. But if she's willing to work on it. then thats great! And tell her you really appreciate her friendship but lately is just not been the greatest experience for you.     Hope this helps.   Good luck!  =/|`|VCa9zIqwaa	just find another best friend and don't compliment her anymore because she doesn't say nice things to you... so give her her own medicine! and maybe try to tell her how you feel but that might make her mad but she is rude to you... so good luck! I hope you could find a new friend who will be nice to you always! =D|`|6OxMpo9vaa	u need to leave her behind and find some new friends tht will act like they should and mean it. you deserve someone better than her.|`|f8e72c6f0fb6056040e7f9fa1c5247aaaa	Uhm, well...stop being her 'best friend'.  Simple when you think about it!|`|piv3lVD2aa	well you can make her a regular friend or not a friiend at all or maybe treat her like she treats you for a while and see if she notices|`|nCb4aw3Naa	Don't be mad at her, but you don't have to hang around her.|`|jEGf0ZyAaa	if i were you,i`m not going to be friend with this kind of person.try to advise her to behave but if she ignore you,it`s time for you to leave!go and find another friends that match you well,ok!|`|AA11302281	I've almost had a sitituation like this happen to me,  but i had to find out the hard way?  Most of the times, even when you ask her she's likely to deny it.  To make it short, if you really don't want to lose her as a friend, don't give up have patience.  To  me, it almost seems she's jealous or unhappy with herself.  If I were you, i wouldn't talk to her at all.  See what her reaction would be, see if she cares!*    If she's not worth a friend, don't worry.  It's her lose.  A friend will NEVER say anything bad to you, even if she believes it.  and if she's like that with her MOM, do you ever get to think that maybe, she talks lik that about you?  just think about it.  lol, well goodluckk(=  -rubyy|`|XNKnHt8Xaa	Tell her immediately! State it in a very calm, mature, non aggressive tone. Be brief but give examples of the behavior. If this is someone you wish to or must maintain a relationship be sure to tell them positive things about their personality but, don't make excuses for the bad behavior!    If they get upset stay calm and kind but, don't back down! Just end it with a comment letting them know you are sorry they are upset but, you knew the right thing to do was to let them know that it was a big problem for you so that you can be comfortable with them.|`|GdGwodM5aa	I think you should talk to her, but try your hardest to remain really calm even if she's gets really upset or offensive. Ask her if there's anything wrong because usually people act like this when there's something else going on that's getting them down. As hard as it may be, she might need your friendship more than you realise.
kecpGboNaa	i think you have to have some things in common, but opposites do attract. i have some friends who are totally different then me, and then others that i can finish there sentences. its all about balance    i dont think it affects our friendship, i think it draws us closer and helps us realize we arent all alike. we complete eachother :)|`|2Cw0DfaSaa	me and my best friends are the completely opposites in looks but are the same in personalities. we can predict what the other one is going to say and do and even what we want to eat!!|`|VCa9zIqwaa	me and my other friend is not alike because she likes naruto so much and I  also want to try what she likes and I am starting to like what she likes so it takes time to know each other even though you don't have the same likes and dislikes... =D|`|Hg5Rup4Raa	me and my friends  sort of all have the same sence of humour and think the same things are funny , but we are all totally difefrent and we all bring difefrent things to the table . but we do have compleatly  different personalities and styles and some are more athletic , some wont go near  that stuff , some are more ito music some are both , you need that balance , if your all the same its gunna be boring , and it does get frusturating but you have to try and find a happy medium between you|`|eM03LZPBaa	Well,me and my friends are a lot a like  but we don't always agree on everything it's normal for you and your friends to disagree on things.|`|2gjEPZtlaa	Well most of my friends are like me but I have this one friend who isn't. The thing is she's my BEST friend. We're so different, it's insane. We listen to different types of music, we like different types of food, and we like totally different syles of clothes. She's really emo/goth and I'm girly. But even though we're really different, we get along great.|`|1l04qpOKaa	We all have different personalties and attitudes but we share the same interest. My group of friends we have the funny one, the serious one, the motherly one, the crazy one, the smart one, the leader, the shy one, and so on. but we all get along so great! When we all get together we always have the best times and always have each others backs, there is never any fighting or aguments   :o)|`|3y0w1qIBaa	Personally, I don't really care if my friends are different because you get to learn new stuff from each other and learning from each other is what makes us unique.|`|7rPZZuOPaa	Most of my friends are similar to me.

KOctm8uKaa	Yes,like the lottery.  One day Steve came home after losing a lot of money playing golf. A short while later his wife, Julie, came home from work wearing a new fur coat. "Hey, where'd you get that coat?" he asked her.     "Can you believe? My boss won on a lottery ticket and this was my share!" she explained.     A week later, Julie drove home a new car and once again explained that it was all part of the lottery winnings. A few weeks after that she came home wearing an expensive necklace and matching earrings. She came home a few nights later and told Steve she was very tired and asked if he could please start a bath for her. But when she got to the bathroom, there was only an inch of water in the tub. "Why did you put in so little water?" she asked her husband.     "Well, WE DON'T WANT YOUR LOTTERY TICKET GETTING TOO WET NOW, DO WE?"|`|q3cbuc3Eaa	stop hoping and get what you want!|`|oDL02s8kaa	sometimes, but i will not give up!! and you better not either!!!!    wait it out my dear!!|`|dl0EpJPDaa	Jump ship only if there is a life raft in sight and you know the coast guard is on the way.  Or if you can tread water in freezing cold temperatures until you can find a shore and climb out and stand on your own two feet again.      Wait it out only if you can stand the way things are now?  If you're happy and comfortable wait, if not do something about it.      Hoping for something, doesn't mean that you will never get it. It just takes time.  During that time, you cry, yell, scream, lean on your friend's shoulders, and take as much sound advice as they are willing to give out.    When you feel yourself falling and falling and falling, the good side to that is you haven't hit rock bottom yet and you may be able to rise up again.    When you have hit rock bottom, the good side is that there is only one way to go, UP.  It all depends on how you look at things.  It also depends on your personal circumstances.  It depends on what you actually mean by jump ship or wait it out.  Any answers here don't mean diddly squat becasue No One really knows what you are jumping out of or waiting to happen.|`|m6jE5KVUaa	PI believe that hope only works if you work for what you are hoping for..If you just sit and wait then it may never come! you have to meet it hope!|`|nRtf72u8aa	Who doesnt? that my friend is a part of life|`|yAG3PFcsaa	Yeah I definitely am doing that!

rj004nrlaa	I did a long distance relationship and we saw each other every two weeks for a weekend and it worked. We were together for over 8 years. It really depends on the people involved and how much you feel for each other. If you really love someone then your do everything you can to make it work.|`|QGSaSo6Jaa	to be honest, i doubt a relationship where you saw each other for one weekend a month would last long.    but if you can make it work then good luck :)|`|7Q0UBqBYaa	if you love him/ her anything will|`|57ceddb785d960ae7ee37f6562986527aa	Yes, it can. Will test the relationship to see how much in love you are though. Win win situation. If it works, fantastic, if not, then you know it wouldn't have worked anyway in the long run, so that's good also.|`|aLgY4l3Naa	If you love each other enough it is possible!! I think 2hrs away is not completely impossible, this can be worked out but you both need to give a valid effort to make it workable!! I have been in a long distant relationship for 5yrs now and its not as easy as 2hrs, he is on the east coast and im on the west coast, but we have managed because we both agree on one important thing, we love each other and we both give the effort to make it work!! You truly need to be two very strong individuals who are very much committed to each other!! You need to make every effort to keep close when your apart such as e-mails, letters, phone calls, messaging and most importantly you both need to make a greater effort to see each as much as possible, truly 2hrs is not that long, you both will make it what it is, so if you both really want to be with each other then you both need to make the sacrifices to make it!! I wish you luck and i hope everything works out!!|`|vBiv67Lbaa	Yeah it could work! i know loads of people that have been to uni and have had there partners be away, but have managed it as it hasn't been a permanent work. Just give it a go, if you love each other that much, there's no reason why it won't work. In 5 months, thats like 20 whole weekends together, which is alot of time. Could even make you closer. Good luck!|`|OKvqRBGMaa	I ve been in a long Distance Relationship with my boyfriend for  4years now.. and the main issue is trust.. I trust him so much and so does he.. this really makes things easier when we go out with our friend in our town erm in the beginning it was really hard though but we eventually sort of came up with rules.. i know it sounds silly but they are really important like for instance we know we will roughly see each other once or twice a month (and we live 4 hours away from each other).. we call each other everyday or even a text msg ( communication is so important).. oh yeh and at times when we miss each other we are honest about it.. no point of being embaressed but then again when one is bussy and the other one feels sad...well the sad one must give respect to the bussy one and deal with it on their own untill the bussy one has time to get back to you.    Honestly I think LDR work but it takes time to adjust to the new lifestyle it takes dedication but its all well worth it in the end.    There are times when we argue alot and its harder to make up at the end of the dday though we know that we want each other so we try so hard to make up and make reunion twice as special    gud luck|`|0HZMpkKXaa	Nope, it won't work. Sorry|`|AA10808686	I used to do those but I hate them now.  People always say that "If it's for the one you love, you should do it".

In my experience, they don't work.|`|sfZP0Cz2aa	god there has to be ALOT of trust in the relationship to make it work. you have to be able to trust each other with other people if you get jealous easily it wont work. i really hope thinks work out for you!|`|6ZfJpOKpaa	Of course it will!

She ended up moving in after 18 months but the last 6 months before she did was tough. Hope this helps.|`|mbv2jLqDaa	A long distance relationship can work just as a normal one can work.  If you really want it to work, then it will.  I've been in a long distance relationship for 11 months now and my boyfriend lives 5 hours away.  We see each other every now and then and plan on moving in with each other in July.  I think that with a long distance relationship, you face a lot of challenges that normal couples wouldn't, and you miss out on the daily things a regular couple may take for granted.  In my opinion, those things only make you stronger.  It will work if you put in enough effort, stay strong and keep in touch.  Talk on the phone, text, IM, and visit each other as much as possible.  It will be difficult at times, but it is so worth it!|`|7rPZZuOPaa	It won't work. You both will fall out of love eventually. One of you are going to have to make adjustments.
5NKa5Y8laa	C - Small ring, small intimate ceremony.    Because thats the way it will be, and I love my fiance, and neither the size of the ring or the ceremony will change that.    My engagement ring is small, probably inexpensive, but I dont care, I know its the best he could do at the time. The way he proposed, on my birthday, in front of my family, and asked my teenage children for my hand in marriage, and my mothers blessing... thats what is special to me, and everytime I look at the ring, the memory of the proposal makes me smile and feel warm and fuzzy inside.    A co-worker got engaged around the same time as me, and although her ring was 3 times the size of mine, all she did was complain and winge about it.  I couldnt believe it!  Where is the love?|`|B0ypUuHXaa	i've always wanted a big wedding but as long as the ring is nice i don't care it's size.|`|5V2VClqQaa	C.- Small ring, no ceremony, nice and decent guy who loves me.|`|Gx14PIvxaa	Huge ring, small ceremony. Are you kidding? You enjoy your wedding for what, 4 hours?

Some are more into things you can see, some are more into things you can feel. Meaning that the big ring is nice to show off for a woman who's materialistic. A big receptiuon is nice because you can invite more friends/family to share in your moment with you for a woman's who's more sentimental. Me personally, neither one of those would be my preference. My option would be,    C. small but nice ring, small ceremony, huge honeymoon.|`|7e8be8f471de4c60d8884f52a597ddc2aa	a|`|ByUS0k8waa	Personally Im a tomboy, southern girl.

Our rings were tattooed on as soon as we got engaged and we got married quickly after at the courthouse.

Some couples/people put far too much emphasis on the ring. What matters most is the relationship and your love. A ring is a ring. If most of you who fawn over diamonds knew what the people who dig them out of the ground went through to make sure your finger sparkles, you'd probably be sickened. At least, I would hope you'd be sickened... otherwise I'd seriously question your humanity.|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	big ring small ceremony.

People spend all that money on one day when it can be spent towards a first home or a honeymoon.

b4d9549d46983fced7e264d76911b93aaa	I had 2 flower girls. and they are both 8 yrs old. Since they do grow soo fast I was afraid of the same thing. I ordered them from a web site and the delivery was 1-2 weeks. So i ordered the dresses 1&1/2 months prior to my wedding day.      They might grow a little bit but in 1 month it wont be that drastic of a change. I got their shoes 2 weeks before the wedding.     You might be taking a risk with e-bay... maybe you should order 1 dress, and see if you like it, and then order the rest. I've seen some poorly stitched dresses before and it can ruin everything. Make sure you find out what their return policy is.|`|DqetlSB6aa	you're right, kids grow.  wait until maybe 2-3 months before the wedding. that way, if they grown you wouldn't have spent the money and if the bridal shop needed to order the dresses..it would be back in time.    12-14 weeks sounds like its coming from China.  Id try to find a retailer on Ebay who distributes out of the US..that way it doesnt take so long and id order from them. 24.00 is a good price|`|3MDY29gnaa	im not buying my jr. bridesmaid and flower girl dress until May (im getting married in July) Im just going to buy them right off f the rack, That's the best thing to do. My flowergirl is 4 and my jr. bridesmaid is 9. They both grow so fast so i think this is the best thing to do

gGZz2EGyaa	British men are no better or worse then any other men from other countries about ringing or not ringing a girl.  It does sound as if the man is only interested in you as a friend, if you want it to go further then you will have to wait for a while and see what happens.  There is a time difference between both of you and you did say he has a busy job.  Perhaps after a hard day at work all he wants to do is relax and not think about phoning or texting someone.  For the time being I would just carry on with the texts and the odd phone call, after a month you will know if it is going to progress any further other then friendship.  Good luck and I hope it works out for you okay.|`|lIO4uiJmaa	Well from my experience most British men don't expect the women to do the calling, however reserved they are.  But if you talk for over an hour on the phone, then he could hardly be described as 'less chatty' than most American men. I haven't met an Englishman yet who was willing to chat for nearly anything like that long on the phone !    Are you sure that he isn't married or in a relationship and this is just a bit of fun for him. Or maybe he sees no future in the relationship because of the distance between you ?    You need to ask yourself what do you want from this relationship?  I would say, if it doesn't upset or hurt you when he is out of touch for a bit, then stay with it as you have nothing to lose.  Like you say nothing romantic happened when you were together, so why should it start when you are 3,000 miles apart ?|`|QydVDaXRaa	Bear in mind the time difference:  when you're ready to chat at 9pm, it's at least 2am here.|`|2c7869fbf2bfda8e590501ddb5545f2caa	No they dont.  If he is not calling much then he is either not making a big thing about what you are sharing or you are much more into the relationship than he is.   If a guy is keen on a girl then he will show it.  If your not hearing from him then it doesnt say too much.|`|rj004nrlaa	I would say it's down to that individual rather than country of origin. I know some blokes who call all the time and some who hardly ever. Since you're just friends he probably see's it as keeping touch, so a call every now and then would be acceptable.
5d5t1Rpeaa	thats a good photo of you, so i wouldnt know, and your virginity isnt just something to give away, you will find someone!|`|X3GRTBXtaa	you're pretty, but don't lose it just to lose it. if you wait to do it with somebody that you care about it'll mean something and not just be a one night-er with some guy that was just horny.|`|mCAuoWQ7aa	Wait!! Just because your friends have doesn't mean you have to. I bet half of them wish they cold have it back.You have something they don't.  And you would be amazed at how they could turn their backs on you because you slept with some guy just to lose your virginity. Wait for the right guy because this is a major time in your life.|`|tjKwiYZtaa	well i think that you should wait until you find the right guy who wont be an *** hole about it and want it all the time. it will hurt the first time and maybe some times after that. I know that you may need foreplay before having sex. you also want to find a caring guy who is nice and gentle  cause if he just slams it in u you will bleed and be hurt. make sure its what you want and not what you could regret sometime later|`|15e58edf21f33dd475298413b3cd6d8caa	if this is really you?  you are VERY NICE! do not do what others do,do what you think is best...|`|P347b7nVaa	dont throw it away. you only have one shot at it. give to someone really special.|`|aVUDYQWqaa	well the best place to do this is a bar try and slip in with friends or a party try and find a dude with a smell one or skinny one so you want be so sore the next day you do this by fondling him or going down once you get him errect he will be at your mercey and you climb abourd or just finish him off there  if you decide to change your mind .|`|143bm6cnaa	Send me your address and I'll help you lose it.|`|029d970e89f49628d1a27a4f7084f48faa	If you were that hot, you'd have shown your whole face. Stop being pathetic and trying to follow after your friends. They'll all have STDs if they keep it up. Wait for the right guy so you keep a good reputation. If all the guys think you're easy, so will the right guy, and he won't try to date you.|`|dv0zbH7gaa	From that picture its hard to tell but it looks like you are hot!|`|a2b21f2cee1471018ba8eafddb953922aa	wtf. all i see is an eyeball. can i get a pic of ur entire face? no body can tell if ur face is unproportional or crooked...|`|DBdR26Ssaa	ahhhh...someone is looking for attention. and besides wait until you are ready and you have found someone special, or you will regret it later. sex is not that big of a deal. you will be disappointed.|`|zXIhB8Ycaa	My question to you is why settle?  Ask your friends if they had to do it over again...would they have gone through with it or waited?  My guess most will say they wish they had waited.    This may sound idealistic...but there is a "right time* when you will know.    And yes, you are stunning!|`|ACVKajUIaa	why the hell wud u wanna lose it just coz ure friends hav. desperate much? and that pic is bad u cant even see half of ure face so i cant tell u sorry|`|hIwJxNVkaa	dont be in a rush to loose your virginity... wait for now.. if ur in a rush, then you must be still a teenager.. dont follow people.. just cuase your friends have lost it, dosnt mean you have to. wait for the right guy to come along...|`|pX8qJzjIaa	All im gonna say is dont rush it, but if you want to than definately do it.  And yes, your very beautiful, amazing eyes.
RoEyFm5yaa	SHE MUST LIKE YOU IF SHE GOT BACK WITH YOU.IF YOU WERE HER FIRST,THEN IT IS UNDERSTANDABLE THAT SHE HAVE STRONG FEELINGS FOR YOU,POSSIBLY EVEN LOVE.GOOD LUCK.|`|eS9nPWqBaa	Maybe she just wants too????...you took her virginity and now you want to hold out on her MEAN!  =P|`|AA11417059	Could be she just wants to have sex and because you took her virginity it could be because she is already familiar with you. Dont wear your heart on your sleeve with this one. It could turn into a booty call. Keep that in mind|`|WMR8hVlfaa	First of all, is she on some form of birth control? Do you know how to use condoms? If the answer to either of these (or both) is no, then you should not have sex until you can say yes.     Second of all, why not talk to her about it rather than ask a bunch of strangers? If you are really concerned that she is trying to please you by offering sex, then talk to her about it. Tell her that she doesn't need to prove herself to you. If you want to have sex as well, then go for it - just make sure that you're both doing it for the right reasons (and that you are protected from unwanted pregnancy AND stds).|`|72UNDrwkaa	Maybe she hasn't had sex with anyone else because she hasn't felt confident too, but with you she will do because it was you that she lost her virginity to, i think if you want her then you probably wait a little while to have sex because she could just be using you to get more experience before moving on to any other blokes|`|DErBSfZgaa	Maybe she's happy you guys got back, and she could expireence it again with you. Or maybe it could be she hasn't done it since you guys split and really wants to have sex.
sRKO8s6jaa	Eye contacts shows that you either like her or paying attention to her which girls like. So it could.|`|k8CjAhpQaa	a definate yes, nothing more intimate then eye contact and for some reason all my friends agree with something sexy in a guy wearing a black top|`|p3GZERIsaa	Of Course! :] And Linx is always nice, hope i helped :]|`|rj004nrlaa	No, looking into someones eyes doesn't make them like you more and no aftershave will either. You need to win her over with your personailty!!|`|sfZP0Cz2aa	it could it always nice to be looked in the eyes and not at breasts or bum.|`|lIO4uiJmaa	I would say that if you stared into the eyes of a girl you didn't know or hardly knew, then it would give her the creeps rather than like you more !  Sorry !|`|bG6ZJCeqaa	look in her eyes and smile at her :)
IVCCmdmVaa	He may be interested in this other woman if she has qualities you know could strike his interest. BUT...he was definitely inconsiderate to you. If you are his girlfriend regardless of what you drive things can go wrong, so he should have checked to make sure you were OK first.|`|utGddhnVaa	Is he your dad? what do you care who he helps? I'd help out a girl with a car over someone with a 4x4.|`|dc49d60c4d19a92e193ce2f41c92cfedaa	Well being a man he probably didn't think you would have any trouble where as you have a SUV but if she has a SUV also and he dug her out anyway then i would kick him where it counts :)|`|vOOf7xdEaa	dont know sorry|`|c97b11f063d5417bc2c001b07d58e097aa	Your thinking way too much into it........|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	who is HE?  Did you ask him to help?    if he's your BF then I think it's strange that he helped a neighbor and not you as well.    if he's just a friend or a neighbor then it's not his responsibility to take care of you.|`|VCz1CtiLaa	Maybe she asked for his help or maybe he saw her trying to get out since she is his neighbor.  I think it was sweet of him to help his neighbor, but he also should have thought of you.|`|GaxJ5Qiwaa	no he should have helped you,|`|cQU4LO4Raa	If he's just a neighbor then you're making way too much out of this. He might be interested in her and is letting it be known. Also, he probably knew you would be able to get out ok with a SUV.|`|gb9REJN4aa	Oh man, it is totally you. I'm a girl but I have to say you are being a little bit paranoid.    You have a 4-wheel drive SUV and you had no trouble getting out of your driveway. Your boyfriend rightly thought that you were well-enough equipped and sufficiently capable to get out and back in again. He, being a decent kind of guy, then proceeded to help a neighbor who actually needed it, instead of coming down to help you when you were doing fine. It sounds to me like he did just the thing a gentleman should do. I don't think he was being inconsiderate at all. Maybe he should have accounted more for your feelings--maybe he should have known you would have appreciated it if he had come by to make sure you were okay--but I don't really think he did anything wrong. Besides, if you needed him to help and he was only a block away, he might have rightly thought that you were perfectly able to go over to his house to ask for help if you needed it.
jChbnuafaa	seriously when you guys are alone just kiss her (a peck unless she wants more)    i no that sounds kinda ridiculous and you prolly wouldnt do that but that why you have to do it   if someone told me to just go up to the guy i like and kiss him i would like hell no! and thats what you might being saying right now BUT you really should!    if you just kiss her she will know that you really like her She technically knows you like her but you have to show her she isnt confident that you really truely like her and with a kiss she will see you truly like her    whats the worst that could happen it just a kiss    if you have anymore questions Email me :)    good luck   -salsa|`|Se6ikPhTaa	the girl of ur dreams cheats on other guys? that's messed up.|`|DbyvTE4laa	go for it , take the risk, u will never really know till u try|`|sooNO69Naa	have you talked to her about all this......honestly tell her everything you just put in this question....see what she says.....sounds like you realy care about her and her feelings....hope everything goes well|`|7OUzPdt2aa	That is a very tough question. In my opinion this is what I think you should do, but you absolutely do not have to do as I say. I think you should go ahead and tell her exactly how you feel about her. I think she will understand because you both have gone though so much together. If she does not wanna be with you in that kind of way i think she will still wanna be good friends with you tho.|`|bWcJqSSbaa	so get married|`|UlEFgavdaa	There are many factors to consider in this case.  1 is both of your ages.  2 her past history. Think about the scenario of if you did become girlfriend/boyfriend and she did end up cheating on you, would you lose a best friend? I guess you have to just figure out which is more important to you - taking a chance on love or keeping a best friend.|`|AA11137908	Aww, this is so tough...What the heck, give it a try!|`|esuG2Tvvaa	Tell her how you feel about her, and that you would really like to be friends if she doesn't reciprocate your feelings.    IF she doesn't understand, doesn't reciprocate your feelings AND does not even want to be friends after you have told her than she is probably not worth it. Either way it's a win-win situation.|`|3y0w1qIBaa	You should give it a try.  You don't want to waste all your life, instead, life is all about taking risks.
2hAuIg5baa	i like to ***|`|RoEyFm5yaa	AUSTRALIAN.|`|APgQM4QRaa	yaH.|`|FgDIEpSxaa	What?
AA11209233	It's nice when they do.  I don't really see the difference between a woman coming straight out and asking me, and trying to send me signals so I'll ask, except that I'm not going to miss a direct question, and may miss a signal.    If you've tried it and had problems getting a yes, you may have put the guy on the spot too soon.  Like men do when they ask you out, you have to make the thought cross his mind before you ask, so he isn't shocked and put off by the question.  He needs you to give him a reason to like you and you need to give him a reason why you like him.  After that, ask away.|`|IPS3hWweaa	I love it! It really doesn't happen often enough!    I'd think most guys would love it as well. For once, the guy wouldn't have to worry about getting rejected.    All you girls out there, don't be afraid to go after something you want. Sometimes a guy doesn't know you are interested, and what better way to tell him than ask him out.|`|MHwn4Tlzaa	it's awesome!|`|avykSnJMaa	I would love it if it happened more often.|`|Kh9Wzrhyaa	I don't mind at all. Usually, guys are terrible at reading girls. So this takes all of the guesswork out of it. Sometimes you ladies have to let us fellas know exactly what you want.|`|XiT8q49Daa	it would be great! saves us time and embarassment because the girl usually the ones who rejects the guy so yeah, it'll be great if the girl asks first...|`|ACVKajUIaa	i think its great in my opinion xD|`|hIwJxNVkaa	well.. if the guy likes her.. then he will be willing.. but if not.. then ya.. she would seem to availible.. but if a girl did that more often, it would take a lot of preasure of the guy because the guy has too much to worry about when he is going to say or do..|`|jMTwgYwJaa	i think its nice when a girl breaks the ice ... if it begins to happen repeatedly though it does tend to seem like its too easy but a couple of times and usually if you are interested the guy should pick up on it and start asking you|`|yPU75DdIaa	i like it honestly im the athletic  good bodied tall type but im also the shy loving quiet guy in the corner of the rom reading a book wondering about the world  it's a good reminder that im not totally invisible to the world|`|tyk9a8Aaaa	I personally think that its fine for the girl to ask out the guy, it shows that the girl has feelings for the guy. When asking him to grab a coffee together or something, it would be like a hint to the guy saying "She's interested in me". It doesn't mean that the girl is easy to get or not much of a challenge, it means that the girl feels something special for the guy. And if you asked him out, the guy would probably think that the girl really likes him. It sorta shows the guy that the girl is confident, and to a guy, it means a lot. I hope things work out, and do what you feel is right. Hope this helped!  :)
NJVm6dTiaa	Yes of course I would. I would do whatever it took to make him happy. Anything! It is such a small and very reasonable thing your husband is asking of you, and contrary to what you seem to think, it makes perfect sense. It is not good to leave mess around - it makes a most unpleasant environment which he must find difficult to relax in. You acknowledge that he does not expect you to do everything - he helps out with the housework equally - but he does expect you to pick up after yourself in a timely manner, and I think it would be great if you could try to adopt that habit to make a happier home for both of you, and the new little baby coming to join you.   You describe yourself as a "last minute person", and that may have worked out just fine for you as a single lady. It complicates things when you're married, and it is absolutely unworkable when you have children. If you could learn to become a little better organised now, you will find that having good routines in place actually gives you MORE free time and the ability to enjoy things spontaneously, because you know you have in order the things that you need to do. Do yourself (and your husband) a favour and try to do the little things he asks of you.  That's what love is all about really, caring so much for the welfare of the other person that you just want to please them! It sounds like it doesn't take much to please your husband. Some women have way, way more demanding husbands to accomodate. I think you should honour him and try and make his home life with you the best it could possibly be. You will benefit too - I think you know that.|`|ULUpOqplaa	Its called OCD, obcessive compulsive disorder.  he can get medication for it.|`|Gx14PIvxaa	There are certain things you compromise on, sure. To make him more comfortable at home, you might pick things up more often.    But for him to yell at you about it, that's not right. Just because you aren't doing things the way HE would do them, he just needs to accept that. Part of living with someone is dealing with differences that you may have in a healthy way - as long as those differences aren't hurting either of you physically or emotionally.    If he asked you kindly to change a FEW habits, I'd say "Sure, I DO want to make you happy. I can do that". But asking someone to change themselves is not why you get into a relationship in the first place. =)    Good luck!|`|ivGWF8nmaa	There are plenty of "ridiculous" things I do for my husband.  I do them because it makes him happy.  But somethings, he just needs to get over.  For example - driving on the driveway before he snow blows, leaving the light over the stove on light and not "night" light.  If it's something easy for you to do and you don't mind too much, then just do it.  But if your trying to make a point then tell him you'll do things in your own time.|`|5NKa5Y8laa	I would suggest that you take turns cleaning up after dinner, in your own individual ways, as long as it gets done by bedtime.  Same with household chores.. perhaps you put the washing in the machine / dryer, and he gets them out.  Little compromises and coordination like that can go a long way to keeping the peace.  Life's too short to argue about the little things.|`|VmH7e0r7aa	I kind of have a similar situation, and my thoughts are that your husband should lighten up. Its not like you're leaving your plate in the living room for days, or laundry all over the house. It's all a little give and take. Hold your plate until a commercial, then take it to the sink. Ask him if he could just relax a bit and focus more on the important things in life.|`|x02jsjg6aa	This will never be solved, because you two have completely different emotional reactions to mess and clutter.  Without organization and planning, I will get antsy, nervous, and feel icky.  Maybe that's how your husband feels- and if does affect him if you two share a house.    That said, if you're not a slob and you haven't caused HIM problems with your last-minute planning, tell him he's just going to have to compromise, and the yelling is certainly disrespectful.    NOTE: I believe my fiance is not clean enough.  But he does keep things cleaner for me.  And I run him hot baths when his back hurts, and keep his son quiet when he naps.  If we never did anything for each other, our relationship would be crap.|`|2YX18RE2aa	I answered your question yesterday and tried to point out to you that I felt he was viewing your intractability as a sign of your attitude regarding your relationship.    "that I should do them for him to show him that I love him".    So my question becomes are you really so selfish that you cannot even try to do anything to show him you care more for him than for yourself?    Oh that's right his analogy is "ridiculous".    Remember my dear, "In men anger and hurt are very closely related".    You think you are always right and he is being unrerasonable.    Apparently my attempt to give you some insight into the working of the male mind has fallen on deaf ears.    Can I suggest where this is going?  You will continue along just like before.  He will continue to view your lack of cooperation on anything he asks, even the most insignificant request,as a lack of respect.  This will hurt his feelings.   Because he is a guy and does not know how to verbalize his feelings  he will supress it and it will create stress.  Stress will be relieved through anger and yelling.  He will be labeled as "not normal" and the ever popular abusive.    You think I am wrong?  Keep on dear, you know you are right and he is not.  In 5 years when he has had enough of you you will be left alone  wondering why he went to a woman who is not as good looking.  You will not understand that it was because she probably did what he asked once in a while.|`|fYv0dtUFaa	sounds like you are lazy and your husband is anal, no wonder why you are aggravated with eachother.  My boyfriend is the same way as you and I am the same as your husband and we have found ways to compromise.  He tries harder to clean up after himself and I try harder not to get aggravated when I have to clean up after him...after all it is MY issue that I want things clean right away not his.  He will do it eventually.  Its all about compromise...both of you need to give in a little.  You're making a mountain out of a mole hill.|`|6aVtiTKiaa	Everybody has little things that bother them.  He can equate it to him coming to bed with you when he'd rather be playing video games if it's something that you've asked him to do.  Living with someone else is hard, there are always adjustments.  And compromises.  Maybe you can have your own area in the house for your disorganized stuff ... and he can have an area that is only for him.  My husband and I are both pretty disorganized, but certain things we still need to have just so.  And it's still that way after 11 years of marriage and a child.  So we have our own little areas, and when we must overlap we try to honor each other's wishes.  It doesn't always happen, and we still have little disagreements.  But that's just part of being married.|`|aDIPIu7xaa	OK, just yesterday you asked another totally immature, lame question about you and you husband having some asinine disagreement.    Its like I told you yesterday- wait until that baby is born- YOU MY DEAR are in for the SHOCK of your LIFE!|`|029d970e89f49628d1a27a4f7084f48faa	I do all the same things you do - leaving the dish out til I get up, clothes in the dryer til I need to use it again. To be honest, these are pretty minor requests on your husband's part - it might be in your best interest just to make an effort to do them. Bringing your plate to the sink an hour earlier won't make a major difference in your life, but clearly he'll appreciate it. If he's sacrificing his video game hour to be in bed with you, do this for him.|`|TgU9P6pdaa	If you don't want him to yell, you should try to do some of those things.  I'm the same way as you.  My plate is usually left on the floor while you watch tv, and my boyfriend will pick it up.  He never complains about doing it though.  Since this obviously bothers your husband, just do it.|`|f9sL3WgQaa	By not doing it you are showing no respect to the other person who lives in the house. Yes you need to get up and do it. Its not just your house but its a shared household.    For him.. its as if he went to your work and threw everything on your desk into the floor and walked out. You wouldn't like it if he did that so why do it in his home.|`|tCiVuFK9aa	It is amazing the types of things we find out about each and the things we find annoying about the other person.  But these are things that the two of you need to learn to deal with as a couple.  These are not big deals but obviously he thinks they are to him.  I don't think doing chores mean that you love or don't love anyone so they shouldn't be compared to that.  Here's an idea, if those things bother him and you two share household chores, tell him that you will take a couple of his chores and he can take those chores from you so that he can do it his way.  Red|`|6KpZ2fIRaa	It is important for you to care about respecting his living environment. It is also important for him to realize that you have formed life-long habits that cannot be changed over night. You two should agree to meet in the middle. And he may not realize this, but it could be a lot worse. My wife will leave empty bottles and such until the next time she decides to clean. That could be 3 or more days. Then she gets on my case about helping her clean. My idea is that if she cleaned up after herself on a regular basis, there wouldn't be so much stuff to clean that it would require both of us to spend hours working together at it. She thinks I cannot be happy with her because I am too picky about everything she does. I think that we both compromise our personal lifestyles and should be willing to form new habits that contribute to a more comfortable living environment. Hopefully we can work this out in counseling. And hopefully you and your husband can work it out together without having to call in a counselor to assist.|`|qXCSWQpdaa	You are missing the point.    HE IS your first child!    Admit it.|`|77ZVd5hyaa	Sounds like you need to hire a housekeeping service.|`|BhXOLas1aa	Has he always been like this? Ask his mother. It may be that he has Obsessive Compulsive Disorder if it is really bad. I would think he is just a neat and tidy man and likes an ordered home.  There is no way I would leave a plate on the floor after a meal and I'm classed as normal.   Maybe you both need to sit down, talk and the compromise.|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	hunny! i am exactly the same as you. My husband hates when i dont pick up my plate immedietly after eating and same thing with the bottles. i tell him all the time i do things a certain way and he does thigns a certain way. he can complain until the cows come home but i wont change because it is just who i am. If he doesnt like it he is welcome t odo it himself or wait a few extra hours for me to do it. If he isnt willing to do it then it isnt something worth complaining over. It is completely natrual. Oh i totally feel for you on the video games, my husband plays some stupid computer games on teh laptop, wheni complained he never comes to bed with me, he brought the laptop to the bedroom and played the games while i was trying to sleep! you jsut cant win, so we love them anyways.|`|Bc4udMhUaa	I would start by NOT eating dinner while watching TV.    Yes, I would do those things for him. Relationships are give and take. You must have known how clean he was when you married him. It only take a second to take your dish to sink/dishwasher and throw away a bottle. How long for laundry, like 5 minutes?    Is a couple minutes of your day worth saving your marriage?|`|y9CgveCGaa	Those are small things to do to make your husband happy.  Why not do them?  Don't you want him to be happy?  The first priority in marriage should be the happiness of your spouse.  If you both do that you will have a happy marriage.    And, when children come along, all this will seem trivial.
grAU3MJcaa	Why are you with someone when you love someone else? That is the real question.     Anyways...to answer yours...    Bring the new girl, your ex shouldn't control your life.|`|W76VDFKCaa	Bring your new girlfriend.  Yes, your ex may feel hurt and jealous but it was her choice not to be with you.
LsHsDHx3aa	He probably likes you, unless he just want's to get in your pants, but don't lose hope, if he does have a girlfriend, i think he's trying to make you jealous, just wait until they are broken up and ask him to a movie or something|`|IVCCmdmVaa	He was too shy to kiss you, but he can tell you that he had a dream and you and him were fcuking?  Hhmm, he might just be fcuking with your head.|`|d08rkYlpaa	Well, that is very flattering, but if you know what dream sex means, it's not so much flattering. You might be disappointed by what I have to say.  When people dream about having sex with someone they know, it doesn't always mean they actually want to do it, or are sexually attracted to that person, or have even really thought about it. It very often means that there is something about that person, some quality they admire, and find lacking in themselves. The dream about sex is really about "joining" that quality to themselves.  For example, if Mary feels shy and ordinary, and knows a guy who is outgoing and special, she might dream about having sex with him, not because she ever wanted to, but because she wants to be outgoing and special, and he is the symbol of those things in her mind.   So, your friend may not have any sexual intentions toward you, but just admires something about you, and wants to be more like you that way.|`|WFRooU7Maa	WHAT???    CREEPER, and I'm pretty sure thats illegal|`|VSb6S6muaa	it's a dream... and if he really did like you he'd be with you, and that's the honest to god truth.|`|btyElokJaa	Get on your knees and suck his....toes    (wot else did u think i was gunna say? c/mon this is Y/A ffs)|`|m76Yub17aa	it was just a dream, and besides, he told you so that means it wasn't a very important dream...|`|YePbJES8aa	he wants you or else he wouldn't have put that in your head. He was prolly tryin to get a feel for how you responded. Guys can be stupid about the way we try to see if a girl likes us. what you should do now is flit more then you ever have and I am sure something will happen.
6Dg3faIFaa	The only way you will know for sure. The best way to make a relationship last is to be open and honest and communicate with each other. She will apreciate you opening up to her and make her feel more comfortable coming to you if ever needed. Just go for a walk with her or sit her down and tell her how you feel and ask her how she feels. If not it will just build up untill you break and that wont be good. Girls love it I know because I am one and I date one! Good luck|`|NJN8tP0Haa	well im 20 man and im going to be striaght..  more than likely you both will not stay toegther..  its only been a month which could be the best month you have ever had since your with her.. if you think something is wrong..  more than likely there is something wrong. i just got out of a 9 month relationship.. maybe 6 months ago.. and follow your senses .. you feel something is wrong dont keep asking her.. just try to be there for her and wait to see what happens. take it day by day dont plan the future because you never know what could happen. all girls say they love you. and you tell it to them back.. dont really worry but if u start seeing ur relationship getting worse in say a week.. something is up..    dont mind the myspace stuff. i mean ya sure where wtf.. why did u take me off.. but its just myspace...      shes stressed or its the time of the month... just be supportive and see how it goes in a week,. day by day is better than week by week or even o i think im going to be with her all my life...  dont sweat it right now.      GIRLS ARE CRAZY AHAHA|`|4w9gmvumaa	She is afraid of going to jail for statutory rape.|`|ZR34thBvaa	How dare she put a picture of herself up on her MySpace.    You're giving her too much freedom, shorten her leash immediately, else she will walk all over you.|`|5Q8vMxuqaa	she probably just needed someone to talk to because she was upset..my girl takes it out on me too sometimes, everything ends up better the next day so just leave it. you don't have anything to worry about.|`|AB3D5gIJaa	i guess if things are going good you dont got nothing to wry bout but if u think sumthin is up get sum clues to find out if she really duz luv u or if she's just sayin that.|`|SvEt3d8Gaa	dont worry yar,,she just intended for a change,,,dont wory,,,she still loves u alot,,,|`|91ACjB5eaa	hi  well, it sounds to me like, her time of the month. and if she cant holler at her man... who can she holler at?  im 18 and have been having mine since i was 10, it sucks! and im going to have great pleasure beating the crape out of eve when i meet her; but any way... when i am raging-it, and all mad at the world :-)  i yell at my husband, he understands and takes it like a man, even when he doesn't deserve it (hes great!)   just try and think of it as something great  she must feel secure about you're relationship, if shes comfortable yelling at you already (that's a good thing!)   just hang in there and give her a hug, just make shure that she stops swinging her fist's before you lean in.|`|vOOf7xdEaa	dont know sorry, woman are just like that sometimes|`|K5yWLudIaa	wow, pal, by the looks of your avatars id thinks girls would be flockings to yous.|`|AA12183955	u are younger.. maybe not what shes looking for.    oh and if she does break up with u.  dont be a whinny *****, be cool, to young to be letting girls bring u down.  get guy friends, get beer|`|X5afTqKiaa	Dude it's up to You what are her actions and stuff!!!! But from my opinion I see nothing to worry about I think you are very lucky everyone in relationships fight but it does not mean she does not like you!!!! Good Luck!:*)|`|IGY2ofRBaa	if she has not distanced her self from you or acting any different to how she usually does then i cant see that there is something to worry about, i do think you need a bit more of a reason than her changing her my space pic from yours to her own, maybe your being oversensitive?|`|ilS9Pakxaa	Nah you don't have anything to worry about...  I've been with my husband for over 5 years and we have had arguments over millions of stupid things for example this one time he woke me up at 8am on a weekend after a long shift the night before and we ignored each other and never spoke for the whole day. These things happen and these little arguments make the relationship stronger. Just don't say anything in an argument that will hurt in the long run. :)|`|jhNUuz0maa	She is 20 and you are 17. So, basically you are dating a pedophile depending on what state you are in.    Anyhow, she could be upset that she got called into work, but it also could be that she is working and your not. She might be growing tired of paying for everything, if that is the case.    As far as the Myspace thing, don't get too hung up on the fact that she changed her pic. She might have wanted something new. My wife and I have Myspace, and we both change the pics all the time. For example, she has her and her best friend as her default. So don't worry about her Myspace pic.     Unless she has a habit of lying, I wouldn't worry too much about it. Comfort her and just tell her and reassure her everything will be ok, and it will be.|`|EjVjtagWaa	Being a female, I don't think you have anything to worry about. She was just ticked off and took it out on you, she would have taken it out on any person who may have been there. You just happen to be the one there.  It also doesn't matter to me who buys what for who. That's how relationships work.|`|LsHsDHx3aa	well, if she's taking it out on you, most girls do that, my girlfriend does that aswell, if she took a pic of you out of her myspace, and put a pic of her, and she says she still loves you, take her word for it|`|NeIYmhaAaa	Dude, relax she is probably just stressed because of work or something. You really shouldn't worry just talk to her and make sure she is still comfortable with the relationship. Ask her how was work?|`|EjjuQ1Llaa	no, she was just frustrated and wanted to share it with you. she also probably got tired of her myspace pic.|`|v1zbdURPaa	no worries...she loves you bt shes just bored of dat PIC......dnt believe me?????ask her...
TddxnieKaa	Wow, why question it,you are very lucky... just appreciate it! That's very sweet.|`|AA10867564	i'll let you in on a little secret: when women say they just want honesty from a man, we all know she's lying. all women want to hear what they want to hear when they want to hear it, whether it's the truth or lie.<br>  |`|5d322a52926c61df28761c367b74679baa	Because beauty is in the eye of the beholder. |`|muTZeGOgaa	The most simple answer... it's love.  Also, as to the looking "plain" on a regular basis, some men love a woman who is so secure in herself that she doesn't have to get all dressed up with a face full of make up to feel good about herself. I'm a lot like you in that respect. I like my jeans, never wear make up, and the most effort I put in to my hair involves a brush. My husband met me that way, fell in love with me that way, and married me that way. Also, I was very worried when I had my breast reduction, how he would deal with the scars. Well, he jokingly says, "What scars? I don't see any scars?" Yeah, he doesn't see my terrible keloid scars!  The fact is, he sees past them. He thinks my silly Garfield the cat nightshirts are sexy.<br>  <br>  He's ridiculous, and I love him for it. |`|BWAI6v2Qaa	beauty is not always on the outside.  He sees you for who you are, and who you were when you met.  think of this way; is doesn't matter what you wear, what you feel like, or if you had surgery, he still remembers you for you.  im sure that you feel the same way about him.  think about it and you will see that he too will sometimes do what you are doing. just how do you react to him looking not at his best? bet its the same.|`|aHmeSgqVaa	Your husband loves you for who you are. He sees you for your beauty outside and inside. You are so very lucky to have that. In his opinion you will always be beautiful. Someone cannot love you unless they see you at your best and your worst and he loves you through all that. He sees something in you no matter what and he loves you deeply. That is a a true gift to you. |`|AA12363375	He must love you very much!  He sounds like a wonderful man you are so lucky to have him.  Some guys can look at their wife and see inside her. When your sick and he still does it, shows that he loves you through sickness and health.  Remember those wedding vows?   Not every man is superficial and only see the outside beauty.   You have one of the sweeties.   Congratulations!!! |`|AA10912211	Well it sounds like he is in love and truely cares deeply about you.  Have you ever thought that it is not the external beauty but the beauty that you hold within|`|i1kl1VDUaa	Because he loves you for what you are and not what you look like (which is not to say that he doesn't truly appreciate that because I'm sure he does). I sure hope you love him for the same reason. |`|OzAj5xjaaa	maybe he's not looking at your outside, but your inside...he prolly thinks ur nice, and sweet, and the best thing that ever happened to him..you know that stuff that every girl wishes some guy would see in her, instead of just her body??????? yeah, that's the guy|`|JQyxLth8aa	Has he had his vision checked lately?|`|AA11990465	It's because he loves you, goof. |`|4eb0e2f9d5b148fde3255d87f69f396daa	Because he loves you.  We see what we want to see when we love somebody.  
Anzu2Nr4aa	Either   A. You really want to repair your relationship.   or   B. You WILL repair your relationship.|`|3y0w1qIBaa	Well, it seems that you want to surrender yourself and make peace with your friend.  Be careful, despite of the past of what she has done to you, the pattern may or may not continue.|`|4ZAZfT0Gaa	Maybe you guys are going to be friends again. But be careful!!!!|`|WFRooU7Maa	This means you want her bad G|`|OSWs1Hdtaa	it means that you miss her and you dont like the way ya'll left things. if it were me i would talk to her when she gets there and tell her that i was sorry for how things went down. if she is a true friend then she will understand and want to be friends again. if not then she wasnt a true friend in the first place. i wish you the best of luck and hopefully ive helped you out.|`|NTUr0t3haa	You already know what it means. The dream is a wish that this fight was resolved and you won't have any problems when she appears at the school.|`|2axrY4lkaa	you might not be friends with him/her but you could inside not know that you want to be her friend.

ZTEOFBekaa	Hi Super Boy !<br>  You need to take a call on this immediately. You are supposed to be tutored by her & not having these types of actions & thoughts for your teacher.<br>  You need to be clear about it. please inform to your parents of this attitude of your teacher. You may as well talk to your teacher of any problem that she has.<br>  Tell me other than a few moments of pleasures that you will get, will you be able to look into the eyes of your own.<br>  This will not be appropriate for you to make any other move than informing the right people of this.<br>  Good Luck !|`|EPTaL9Ajaa	That's gross.<br>  Confront her about it.|`|FzFSzilmaa	maybe she has an itchy rash... ;)|`|DIebEIw7aa	Tell your parents about this inappropriate behaviour , you need a new tutor sweetie....."she's so fired!"

ef3e8a055f877ac48bf7cb67749b1830aa	Where at?  That is not very much money if you are hoping to get married in a resort town or in the US.  You can do it of course b/c all you really need for a wedding is an officiant and a couple witnesses.  It only costs something like $500 to do it.  But it can be done for 15,000 pesos if you are good at budgets.

aLgY4l3Naa	Because your letting your heart rule!! And you also don't love and respect yourself enough to know you deserve better then this! You need to get a grip and know nothing good is coming out of this relationship, so what are you hanging onto? If your not going to get the love and respect you deserve from your partner, what is the point of the relationship, if its only one sided? You need to get strong and  don't doubt yourself as a person, be confident of who you are and know that you do deserve to be happy and you can be, you just need to make the choice to be happy and its starts today with getting out of a relationship you know is not going any were!

I'm sure he would love hearing it.|`|nDQOwAA3aa	only if you like him|`|RRzcbvvXaa	no, it would probably scare him if by "fun" you mean sexual.|`|lYE34CVTaa	It depends on how long you been together and how serious you are. If you are newly together and/or not serious then probably not a good idea. If you are married and extremely serious then why not?? If you are comforatable in your relationship you should be able to share that stuff. Have fun|`|WFRooU7Maa	Yes, and make sure yuo also tell him  that you got pregnant in the dream|`|fc964df50bc3ae84b97937ecb982821baa	Yes...tell him...he'd LOVE to know that you had a dream about him like that. UNLESS by fun you mean he was a clown and you ran him over with your car but he bounced right back up or something.|`|RjCgCHaqaa	no why the hell would you do that?! unless you like him or something
DytsjZKpaa	hell yes|`|2pDKXnkZaa	yeah, girls get turned on by porn its just maybe a different kind of porn. most girls get turned on if there is a story line to it, like getting it on at work in the office, instead of just getting right to the (deed), they flirt and stuff. Most men just like to get to the (point). and yet there are some girl who just like to get to the (point) as well. So 100% normal! Have fun!
yOLeRiTZaa	~_~.  Hi Dani- I just asked your question to my 19 yr old daughter to see if she had the same thought as me, and YEP...To AVOID spending the money. That's why they do it.    Guys have been doing that even when I was in school and I graduated in '82.     Guys think that we all want BIG BUCKS spent on us. IN their defense, I know a lot of girls that ARE LIKE THAT. But I've had contact w/ you for a while now and I don't think you are like that.     The hard part is accusing the guy that, that is why you feel he's breaking up. Cu'z then you'ree insulting his Manhood. Ya know?     My personal opinion, if you think he just might break-up for THAT reason only...then LIKE TODAY, you tell him you want nothing, but a'lil time with him. Tell'em to put a bow on'em. That would make it the BEST Valentine or B-Day he could give you. Tell him you feel it's more a Hallmark money making day, and you don't want to invest in it. You would rather the 2 of you invest time into each other.    Hope that was a'lil help Dani--That's all I got for this one    Have A Wonderful Day, I hope the Best for you. (in some ways I have to say I feel sorry for the guy in this situation at times).    -----------------------------~_~    .|`|029d970e89f49628d1a27a4f7084f48faa	This has happened to me. On Valentine's Day night, I asked my bf to come over and hang out (this was back in high school). He didn't show up til way later in the night and I gave him a bunch of cute little gifts and all. He asks me to give him oral sex. I told him no. He told me that's the only reason he stayed with me for the past four months. He left, ended up going over some other girl's house, and I was a bawling, sobbing mess for weeks. You get over it.
MYbRICxqaa	I am trying to figure out why you don't know your own feelings. You don't need Yahoo to tell you that. Maybe you need to understand your feelings more because I don't believe you are actually sad, but something else.
3lIAjgROaa	well my thought is that maybe hes not getting enough attention from you...i suggest you try to keep his attention on you and off of the porn...    or another reason is that he could like be addicted to it i heard that ppl can really seriously be addicted to internet porn.|`|WFRooU7Maa	YEs your right    As long as he doens't visit gay stuff your okay|`|NxiLcBlTaa	No

Though i know that society today has put a big emphasis on peoples looks, if your not hot and good looking then your NOT!! Well you know what everyone is different and beautiful in their own way, so don't down yourself because your not up to what society calls "good looking" be confident of who you are and be happy with yourself that's all that matters!! Love yourself enough and know that you matter, enjoy life and be happy with you and don't worry about the rest!! Good luck to you i wish you the best!!
4d163081b2e7d60145dd97484dd14342aa	Nah I was like that - my boyfriend was in his 20s when I was 17.  I dated a 32 year old when I was 21.  I've now settled down with a guy who is 3 years older than me - boys mature later than girls so it's perfectly normal to go for guys who are a bit older than you.|`|143bm6cnaa	I was always attracted to older women - it began as a teenager, and still today I am attracted to women 10-25 years older than me.      Some guys like young girls, some like older.  Some guys like fat girls, some like skinny.  Some like tall, others like short.  Some guys like women of a different color, culture, or race.  Some guys like guys.      By the way, the same thing applies to women.  Its a matter of personal preference.|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	No its not awful, but you need to be very careful because if you go after any guys in that age group they can get in serious trouble if they get caught with you. Girls mature faster than boys, so this is not uncommon. The problem is older guys can very manipulating and controlling, so please be careful.

a3422bad6666b60894e80bace0f14387aa	You can have whatever type of wedding you want, big or small, no matter how long you've been together. A girl in my office has been engaged 10 years and is having a large wedding next summer. It's her second marriage too, the first was when she was 17 and it was courthouse and ended after a year. Generally people will be excited that you are getting married, whether you do it with him in Vegas or at home with a big wedding. I wouldn't worry too much about what other people say, do what make you feel comfortable.     Good luck!|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	Of course not, that has nothing to do with your choice!  Just don't do the eloping thing, and then have a reception later.  Choose either eloping, OR having a ceremony and reception your family and friends can attend.|`|rlUUaSgqaa	Why in the world is that silly?!  There is a reason you waited, and there is a reason why you are ready to make that commitment now.  While you've been living together, you haven't been married.  Anybody who doesn't get that doesn't see the seriousness of the marriage commitment.  I would think the fact that you've waited this long for it just makes it that much more serious and meaningful, and that much more reason to celebrate.    My parents started dating and living together from the time they were only 16.  By the time they got married, my mom was pregnant and they had been together for six years.  Even though they had a life together for several years before, I've still always seen their marriage as the day of their wedding anniversary.  Forty years later, the fact that they were together as boyfriend and girlfriend, and even living together, for six years before seems pretty insignificant.  It makes me mad to think that would people say their wedding isn't as big of an occasion as somebody else's just because they cared enough about the commitment to take some time to grow up beforehand.|`|dPULl5hjaa	It's not silly at all - you deserve it.  As you mentioned, you were very young when the both of you started to date.    Proceed with the traditional wedding - make sure you have enough money to cover the expenses.  Please do not rely on both parents for the huge expense.  I nice gesture from both sides would be a fair amount of money to help with the wedding.    Congrats!|`|4lL34wJnaa	My fiance and I have been together for almost 10 years (living together for 5) and are getting married 7-11-09.  We're having a lakeside ceremony and a reception at the hall on site.  We are inviting almost 200 guests.  I don't think you're silly.  If you have wanted a real wedding, now's your only chance to have one.  Go for it!|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	have the wedding you want.  if you want tradtional have a big traditional wedding.  if you want to elope and throw a big party then elope and throw a big party.    do what you want.    Congrats.|`|FVFxE6owaa	Since you aren't yet married (and do not have children) then there is no reason you can't have the big, traditional wedding.  If you want to elope, go ahead, but please keep in mind that you generally forgo a bridal shower by doing this.  You can still have a reception after you get back from the elopement.|`|757f10afa027007eb6d9e797f2776feaaa	I wouldnt think you were foolish. I would just be happy that you were finally making it official! However, I think you should choose either elope or have a big to-do. Im not a fan of the two-part wedding.    Honest. I dont answer just to tell people what they want to hear.|`|agTCqkLDaa	You want to elope and you want to celebrate, here's why my mom and dad did: they eloped...and celebrated.    They ran down to the courthouse, got married, and then called their friends and family and told them to meet for dinner where they popped open a bottle of champagne and celebrated.  They saved A LOT of money and were still able to celebrate.    Best of both worlds. =)    She has NEVER regretted it.|`|ge3meKYEaa	It's really up to you but it also depends on your age... if your 55, yeah, it would be a little silly to buying a white strapless dress and have a traditional wedding... but if your in your 20s or 30s... it's normal to date someone that long before knowing it's RIGHT!|`|7HVsVspOaa	I marry many couples who have been together as long and even longer than you. My Youtube     http://www.youtube.com/user/PastorAprilG...    has video of Kristy and Ismial's ceremony. Their personal section mentions they have been together for six years, their opening words speak of how for them Marriage was not a decission to be rushed, and of how they are now ready for the commitment od a lifetime. Many times in the Welcome of the guests the idea of "would like to thank you all for being here with them, and for waiting so patiently for this day to come" can be expressed.     The renewal page of my website    http://www.churchofancientways.org/Renew...    Also has some nice words on why they did it twice that apply to why you would want to share your vows with the people you love...    Dear friends and family, we are gathered here today to join in celebration of the many blessings that Maureen and Michael already share. If our lives are as a strand of pearls, the memories that we share of events like this, are a gift that we give to those who are important to us. The thread that holds everything together and the moments of a lifetime are equally important, but it is the sharing of them with those we love that adds the luster! It was a year ago that Maureen and Michael first made their promises of for better or worse and what a year it has been for them! They have been blessed with a beautiful son and a home of their own, and although it hasnt been easy the rewards have been well worth the effort. The potential of love is limitless, yet it is marriage that brings its highest   fulfillment. The levels of commitment they share are like nothing they have ever known before. The realization of what it is to be married, to be joined in spirit and in flesh as husband and wife and parents has for them been an amazing journey.    Congratulations and many happy years to you both!    L&L, April|`|5DJcir9saa	Its your wedding and you can do whatever you want.  I was with my husband for 7 years before we got married and I didn't think anything of doing it how I wanted to.  The length of time you're together before makes no difference.  If you want to elope and then celebrate, then by all means do it!  But if deep down you want a traditional wedding but are worried what people will think, forget about them and have a traditional wedding.  =)|`|s6stLtvLaa	It isn't foolish at all.  My brother and his wife started dating in high school.  It took him almost 7 years to propose to her.  By that point she was already part of our family so it was thrilling for us to make her "officially" part of the family.      If you want to elope and the have a small celebration go for it....you are getting married and it is only once in your lifetime you get married.|`|AkUhaMm9aa	You know what dont worry about what your family or friends might think or say..you have been waiting for this day for a long time and have proof to everyone that you are going to be together for good..you dont want to have one of those rushed weddings..i think its a great time for you to do it..since you both are ready and committed everyone will be happy for you, and probably were expecting it..    you know Im the same we dated for 7 years and living together for almost 3..but we were waiting for me to finish college so now we are both financially and emotionally ready for this and everyone is happy for us, we are not having a huge wedding because we always wanted something more intimate, so we are having about 20 ppl, but its going to be a special celebration and i think its perfect because over the year you have realized who are the really important people in your lives..so you know you are not inviting people that are just going to the wedding to get a free meal and free drinks...as for my wedding i want to give my few guest the best so that they remember this special day.    I say go for it, but make it intimate..more personal i think it would make it even more special..    good luck and congrats..!!:)|`|sMUiGFPraa	Do whatever you want. It's about the two of you.|`|mkrKHQvFaa	Well you can do both if you want.  Elope and then have a big reception.  Two very good friends of mine have been together 8 years and they are having a FULL wedding this coming Sept. and everyone is thrilled about it.  So do what ever your heart desires.  There is not a time line on what type of wedding you get.  It is what ever you want.|`|ZbCLP2Kxaa	You can have a traditional wedding no matter how long you've been together (I've heard of some people getting married for the first time in their 60's). You can elope, too, but do what you feel is right. When my FH and I get married, we'll be together for almost 5 years, and we're having a traditional wedding because we want one.|`|btNUf7rcaa	i don't think you should feel silly at all... look at it from another point of view... you have been together for so long that you deserve to have a nice wedding and celebrate big!!! specially if this is your first wedding!|`|gtunOva2aa	My aunt and my uncle were together for 12 years before they were married, and they had a beautiful formal wedding. I'd say go for it. It's your day!|`|EGpFJXDhaa	Well my husband and I did everything backwards! We had a baby, bought a house then finally got married on our 10 year Anniversary! We decided to go to Hawaii to get married. We had about 40 of our closest friends and family there with us for a week! We loved it and everybody had a great time. You should not feel silly, this is your and your fiance's time to celebrate the love you have! We also had a Hawaiian themed BBQ when we got back from Hawaii for people who could not make the trip.
grAU3MJcaa	Try being a little physical. Touch her arm, hold her hand, give her a hug...some in between stuff...take her clothes off...I hope you know the rest...|`|SOxdyWQOaa	I think she does talk to her plus if she walks any and looks back it means she like you.|`|E2h4QuxKaa	This is gonna be the best answer....be a man and tell her!  Some women are old fashioned and wanna hear it from you first.  That's a good thing!|`|dv0zbH7gaa	Technicaly the only questions you asked is why won't any body answer this question and any flirty ideas. so all the crap after that doesnt have any point!|`|WWacgSKtaa	seems like she's interested. if you're playing beer pong (and you're on her team), try giving her a little hug if you or she scores... or a high five (where you kind of grab her hand and then hold on to it for a brief moment) could work if you don't want to go as far as a hug.    if you're playing against her, don't get overly competitive. like, if she scores against you, compliment the shot.    ask her if she wants a drink or something when you guys first get together (assuming the situation calls for it). do you have her phone number? if so, text her before she visits and tell her you're excited to see her and see how she responds. or if you are friends on myspace/facebook, send her a quick comment.    hope that helps.|`|rqH8mAM2aa	and another one bites the dust!|`|ACVKajUIaa	coz its **** and no one can be bothered to read such a long question. this isnt yahoo essays!|`|Z3fRg8DYaa	yea she likes you at least go for it and find out if she wants to be with you and such.|`|4evaEQVwaa	First I dont no your age so I cant say. try spin the bottle whether its alot of people or just you and her.But make sure your looking at her when you say it so she'll get the message.|`|wscyjkPAaa	Well, it seems like you're already flirting with her so as far as showing you like her, you've already done that.  The next thing is you just have to be blunt and tell her "I really like you, I think you're sweet"  and by the looks of things, she probably likes you.  But accept that the guy needs to make the first move.  It's been like that since the beginning of time and don't expect it to change.  Good Luck buddy.|`|02Rrrz47aa	just tell her that you like her|`|GTvyBTGyaa	How about being yourself no tricks just shear charisma if you have got any!  And treating her with respect.  What are your ages.  You have obviously got a good chemistry so you are already off to a good start. Are you looking for a steady gf or a quick roll in the hay?  You don't sound to sincere if you want to take it to another level ???|`|ZU2nlPGVaa	My first question,.....how old are you? Knowing thatwould make a difference in how I answered you. You sound as though all yor interested in, is getting laid,.....to that, if you can't control yourself, CONDOMS!!!  Personally I would like to know the person I am liking a lot, before anything became intimate. Beer Pong or Beer Bong? There is a difference,.....regardless,......how about getting to know the girl, what's she about, what does she like and dislike,.....and for goodness sakes, stop going through your friends to get to her. Your talking to people who have cinstant erections,....p-l-e-a-s-e! What is she doing sleeping in your bed? Is there no supervision? This is why knowing your age would help. Rule of thumb here,.....do you have a mom? do you love and adore her? With that in mind, treat this young lady, with the same respect you would want your mom to be treated,.....can't go wrong.|`|awVTKzjtaa	With girls u got to be cool. Don't rush. Get to know what her needs, wants, desire and challenges. Important thing here is to get into her frequency, her channel. Then ask her out. Bring her to places she wants to go. Do not flood her with over attentio and over serious topic and stuff. Be romantic but not geek. Overall you have to be relax, cool and truthful. Girls can sense if u have confidence or u can be trusted. Be sweet and gentle but be firm when u need to, especially when its for the well being of others.   Watch her body language, girls r more relaxed at night then day time.Take her dancing and stuff, u will know if she likes to be close to u. If a girl is willing to go on a single date with u it already shows she is now comfortable with u and would  like to get to know u better. otherwise u can opt for a group outing.    Finally,the kiss. remember through out the night u need to hold back n tease a little. don't give her everything. let there be some mystery. then when the moment come she will look at u with so much awe she just want to jump onto u and kiss u.   If u don't get it the first night don't despair, learn and improve your style. Normally if u can hold her in your arms and kiss her, that's it, level up!|`|wsJkoduNaa	Because there actually is no question,we dont know her too know how she is going to react.    ps:the quesion is long.|`|TVHhBMWnaa	MAKE A MOVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  shes tottaly into you if she wasnt she  wouldnt put herself in these situations with you had her in yer bed man just do the damn thang!|`|RjCgCHaqaa	why won't you just talk to her about it? Just like ask her out and see if she feels the same way, if she doesn't at least you know and can move on.|`|G024yAU3aa	Ok- Number One: Even if you and her didn't do anything-she still slept in your bed which means she likes you.      Number Two: Just be flirty with her. Touch her hand, hold open the door-treat her like a lady talk to her and smile at her ALOT. ALSO be yourself-she must like you for you remember that :)    Number Three and MOST important:  Make sure if you tell her that you like her you are SOBER...or she will just think that you are drunk and trying to get down her pants. Good luck!|`|Fp0cN6Miaa	I would just talk to her about it, it seems from what you have said that you two enjoy talking and that she could like you. If you want to have a good relationship with her then ask her out or even tell her that you are interested.    This does make you vulnerable but it will be worth it in the end because you will either find out she does like you and then you can move forward with her or if she isn't interested you will know that she only wants friends and find another great girl.    Good Luck!|`|aVPhSOHFaa	you dont need to ask a long question..and you need to make it were u can understand the the question...i really dont understand....it may be just me...but just talk to the girl ask her out...tell her everthing she wants to hear..im not good at this but...just tell i like you and i think you like me to and if u do you wana go out...|`|jMTwgYwJaa	well if you will be playing beer pong you have the help of liquid courage so i would say your best bet is to feel her OUT  and just things like put her in front of you when you shoot to show off if you are a good shot lol but then later in the night when ur playing you can pull her into you and if she moves away then lay off but if she doesnt mind then your getting a good sign..... tickling is probably one of theee BEST flirtation methods because while its touchy feely it forces a laugh and it doesnt necessarily trap them .... and just use the comraderie of your team while your playing beerpong to your advantage as far as being close to her and make jokes and such and just make sure she is enjoying herself in all aspects of the night and she will most likely make sure you enjoy the entirety of yours|`|XqAWm9Yjaa	try to tell that you like her alot
AA11155563	tickets to a gig or take him to see show like tommy or queen
xdSR5HcJaa	Try to give her the space she needs. If things moved too fast she may be having cold feet, she may be trying to figure out how she really feels without objectively by removing herself from the situation for a while... the worst thing you could do at this point is push, because she's already backing away. You'll only push her farther away if you're not careful. The other guy had a good idea with the flowers... you could send her something nice and let her know that she is missed and that you care, but that you understand if she wants some time. Tell her you will be there when she wants to get back in touch but you're not gonna push her. That will help to build the trust too.|`|Ys10tX6Yaa	im so sorry mate but she's just not interested, i know it hard to forget but you just have to understand that you have to forget her! movvveee on!!|`|NeIYmhaAaa	I think you should definitely talk to her and find out what happened. Maybe she is going Thur something or maybe she just doesn't know how to tell you she's just not that into you. Either way she should be honest. If you reach out and she doesn't respond then dint try again because then it is clear. Well good luck|`|UlEFgavdaa	I would try and send her flowers with a little romantic line or two on a card.  If things don't seem to get back to normal i.e. her answering your phone calls then it is most likely she is no longer interested. Girls don't like guys who are "needy", calls them all the time/texts. Usually if you call once or twice, its her turn to get back to you. If she doesn't, like you said she hasn't in 5 days, she has probably realized she made a mistake by taking things too far, especially if you were just friends before. When you get her on the phone or see her in person next, try to talk to her saying you don't want to take things fast and want to know how SHE is feeling and that you won't be judgmental.     Good luck :)
dv0zbH7gaa	Ummm in honesty boys in general aren't complicated. In relationships there intentions tend to be clear (I don't mean all we think about is sex) I mean if you ask him you'll find out the truth because if hes into you he won't play mind games. I still don't get it when people say they were on and off in a relationship surely you either together or not together. Anyway hope this helps!|`|DBdR26Ssaa	why dont you try talking to him about your feelings for him. maybe he feels the same way.|`|bglr4m0Naa	let him chase after you.... and see if he is genuinely interested in you.|`|m76Yub17aa	Ok, it's really easy: he is doing it because he feels lonely. If he where into you or something he will treat you in a very different way. You were dating on and off, and not dating at all for another year, so... He doesn't like you.     What do you do? Try to get over him and find someone else. As long as you are dating him you are never going to forget him and no one else is going to be interested in you.|`|7xoMXSEqaa	Tell him you still like him. (:    I'm in the same situation. I saw a guy briefly a few months back, and lately we have been hanging out again and we mess around, etc. I knew I never stopped liking him but I could never tell if he liked me. SO one night about a week and a half ago I told him that I realized I still like him. He told me he likes me too. THings are good now.      Don't be afraid, just ask him. (:|`|J4EVtMFtaa	nahhh girls are complicated|`|zQJESBSdaa	Wait it out for a bit and see if he shows you any signs that he likes you. And that he's not just horny all the time.

iqrXIQctaa	First and Foremost, you need to fix this routine you have with your wife. Somehow you need to find a way to get that romantic spark back in your life. Both of you got way to comfortable and now things just are not the same which is an issue.     Second, in my opinion you see this young girl enjoying life with no attachments. She happens to be in close range but this is something you know you cant have and maintain your marriage which makes it appealing. As humans we are never satisfied, we are always seeking something better or something we cant have. Its the challenge that gets us, and I think this isn't love you are feeling its most likely lust. Which in most cases its hard to tell the difference at first.    I don't personally know your wife so I don't know how she would take it if you told her the truth. But I personally think it would be best if you tried to talk with her about it, and not the younger girl. Because lets just say you tell this 22 year old girl about your feelings and hers are mutual, stuff happens and the next thing you know you are having an affair. Then your marriage will be ruined when your wife finds out because she will... and trust me the grass is not always greener on the other side.     If you are having these feelings, because there is no spark left in your relationship she may be feeling the same towards someone else. Either way you should get this out in the open before something happens and she ends up pregnant because it would be horrible to bring a baby into something you are unsure about.     Think about it, TRUE LOVE is very hard to find. So when you finally have it and you are happy don't give up or let it go because a younger hotter edition catches your attention because that could very well be the worst mistake of your life.     Good Luck =]|`|DNCmoJsiaa	I was involved in a similar situation, only worse!  In my opinion, I devolped feelings for another woman because I already knew my wife.  I knew her in's and out's, her wants and desires.  In short, she no longer challenged me, yet I still love her.  The other woman challenged me.  She was a mystery that had to be solved, and no matter what I did, I couldn't keep away from her.    Like your situation, my wife and this other woman are very close.  I found out that this other woman had similar feelings towards me.  She would tease me and openly flirt with me.  I played along because of how I felt toward her, but nothing physical happend between us.  But my feelings kept getting stronger, and I tried to stay away from her.  Eventually I said "screw it" and took a risk and told her how I felt.  It was finally a relief to get it out in the open.  But the other woman took it very bad.  She yelled and screamed at me, told me she never had anything for me, told me she had a "sceret boyfriend" even though it was pretty much common knowledge she was single, and accused me of cheating on my wife although I had done nothing besides tell her how I felt.    It really ruined my relationship with this other woman.  I still see and talk with her, but it is no-where near what it used to be.  The other woman never apologized for how she reacted and never gave me anything besides subtle little hints.  I know that she was scared and didn't want to hurt my wife.  But I don't think it was right of her to react in that manner.      I know the feelings you have for the best friend are strong and that you want to do something about it.  But please don't be forthright as this will take a very open mind from your best friend.  She will not want to hurt your wife in any way.    If you tell your wife, then you risk your wife being jealous and suspicious about your behaviors.  No matter what you say or do, you have just created some distrust between you and her. This distrust will grow and grow.  You're wife will start asking question like where did you really go when you were playing golf?  I really don't think you should tell your wife.    So from my personal experience, I think you should just try and contain the feelings as best as you can.  Try typing love letters to this girl, then just deleting them.  I really don't know as I even went as far as setting up a false e-mail account in the woman's name and sending her stuff.  that way it was like I sent her everything, yet she never really read it.  But still it wasn't the same as just actually coming out and telling her everything.  Just try to hold out as long as possible.|`|aDIPIu7xaa	No woman that is about to hit 30 has a 22 year old dingleberry for a "best friend".

My advice is to stay away from the friend for a couple of months.  This will help you determine if you REALLY do have feelings for her, OR if it was just a phase.  You have a history with your wife.  The vows you took meant something.  Before you give it all up for this 22 year old, I would give the marriage all I had to see if it could be saved.  Best of luck!|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	talk to your wife but dont tell her your in love with another woman, because your not. your infatuated with something new and exciting. it happens to us all, we loose that spark after time and you have to find a way to bring it back once i na while. a young 22 yo is not the answer. talk to your wife and make sure to tell her how much you do love her and how your just expressing yourself so she can help you overcome this issue your having.|`|s1LfdCdsaa	First of all, do not have children with your wife. If you think you are in love with someone else, your marriage cannot survive that and it's over.    You can't have your cake and eat it too. You need to be in therapy to figure out what it is that you want. If it is this other woman and she feels the same way, you need to amicably part from your wife without saying anything about anyone else. Then you need to move away, followed by this other woman in three months or so. Get on with your life after that, giving your wife the distance to get on with hers.|`|yjmOaG1kaa	First of all you can't love two people at the same time. It's a really difficult situation your in because if you tell your wife she'll feel bad and her friendship will suffer, and if you don't tell her you will keep lustig over your friend and there will be a point where you will not be able to hide your feelings for her. I will advice you to just tell your wife straight forward but don't tell her you're in love with your friend, tell her you like your friend (as a man).   I think the best decision should be she stop bringing her to your house and you stop seeing her every weekend. that way you'll just forget about her and move on.    Good luck!|`|3PNyReZnaa	Go watch the movie "Why Did I Get Married"? Before u do anything. Pay attention to the 80/20 rule. It makes alot of sense. Your wife should know better than to bring a single woman around her husband. That's nuts!|`|SCg3kDz2aa	You take this situation too much serious. Next time when you three are together, make a joke on that, how you like or love both girls being with and doing that what actually happens. If any of them ask you what  you mean answer that you spend so much time together with them, that the two girls have got the same close to your heart, etcetc. Anyways, I think that your situation is just regular, normal and banal the same time. Indeed, the friend of the wife will be lovely or antipathetic for all husbands after a while. Even, I am thinking about that if your wife feels or not exactly the same like you. :)) If you handle this situation well you can get into a very especial and exciting scenario. But do not take it so serious!!|`|YrdUWtSCaa	Wow. What a terrible situation.      I say, for everyone's feelings... keep it to yourself for now.  If you say something to the friend you are jeopardizing both your relationship with your wife and her job, considering they work together.    This is very sticky, but I agree with the talking to your wife thing, but I will tell you, there is no good ending to this.    Good Luck!|`|winmjHAmaa	If you want to make it work with your wife....    Ask her not to have her friend over to the house anymore.  Explain that you find her friend attractive and you feel you are put in an unhealthy situation when she is over there and you are at the point where you are just no longer comfortable with it.  You don't need to tell her you are in love, it's probably infatuation anyway.  If this was my hubby, I would understand and appreciate it.  Friends are fine but your marriage is EVERYTHING.    If you want to make it work with your wife's friend....    Well, it won't.  You'll lose your wife and this girl you think you are in love with.  You'll have nothing.        I would go with the first suggestion.|`|vh7J9fFtaa	Talk to your wife tell her how you feel about the spark not thier ask her how she thinks you can get it back.ask her what would make her feel good and sexy.I know it sounds crazy but I think it would work.also set up a hot and spice date night make it like the first night you ever spent together.If you do all that and still have feelings for the other girl then be onest with your wife.At least you will know you gave it one more shot.|`|mGU0h3O3aa	You can't jeopardize your feelings or happiness just to not hurt others. But I wouldn't act or say anything until you know for sure, otherwise you could end up losing the both of them. Maybe you should try spending time away from this other lady and do stuff with your wife and see how it goes..     If you find yourself really wanting the other woman than go for it, just remember you can't have both so you'll have to decide which you could live without.     Also remember you took vows with your wife, for better or for worse. Marriage is not a game.
AA11501437	i don't think your looks are the problem so much as maybe your attitude.  people get a vibe from people...they just do.  call it an aura or whatever, but you can get a feeling if someone is warma and inviting, or charming and charasmatic, or stick up and cold...by their mannerisms, by the people they are around, and by their body language and facial expressions.    "I feel women should work for me attention.. i admite, im lazy. "    sorry, but that is a little bit conceited - and people can pick up on that.    your looks are fine - i would work on being more of a 'people person.'    good luck.|`|tCiVuFK9aa	It's not about looks, it's mostly about attitude and I think your problem was summed up in your additional detail.  You want the woman to work for your attention.  How's that working for you?  Red|`|hIe7qLN5aa	u are cute...but it doesn't matter how cute you are you have to be approachable...if you see a girl you like and don't feel confident enough to approach her...throw a few smiles her way..and if she is interested she will come to you most likely.....if she doesn't come to you well **** it..move on to the next!|`|RvFwmQOPaa	Women love men that show confidence. The fact that you are shy at approaching women may be a turn off or show signs that you are unapproachable. You're a nice looking guy and there is no reason why you shouldn't put yourself out there. You may get turned down and you may not. that's a part of life and a chance you have to take if you want to meet someone. Women are taught early on to let the man be the one to show interest first and to approach us. Some of us still live by those values. Then there are those that are bold and will approach a man first but they will approach those that are giving them an inviting smile or look, not the shy guy sitting in the corner.|`|TDGhHIvNaa	It truly isn't all about looks.  You are not a bad looking guy, but you need to start smiling and putting some sparkle in your eyes. Women don't want to approach a grumpy looking man.  Smile and let your humor show through are my suggestions.  And also remember, just because one girl stepped all over your heart doesn't mean every single one is like that.  Good luck.|`|ma6Re8B1aa	Adam>>> It's not your looks that are keeping you from the woman. It's your personality. When your a shy type, people have a tendency to stay away because that's the message your giving to people when your shy. That you don't WANT to be approached??? You are good looking. But personality has A LOT to do with it too. And one more thing. Just because ONE woman broke your heart, doesn't mean you have to mistrust EVERY woman. That is not being fair!! To YOU and to THEM!!. It's possible that the message your giving to woman is that your shy and don't really trust them. You need to open your mind a little. That's the problem here. Looks are easy to fix to some point. It's the personality that is tough to change sometimes. You need to do some serious soul searching and figure out why you think the way you do. You need to open yourself up more. Then you'll see things in a whole different light. it's YOU adam. Not the woman. Of course be choosy in who you date. But it's not always up to the woman to make a relationship happen. It takes 2!!!!! Your a part of it too. You need to rethink how you look at things. And don't allow that woman who hurt you to cave into life!!!!!!!! So it was a bad break up. Learn and learn to move on from the feelings your having toward woman. There are some decent ones out there.  One more thing>>> If a woman is only dating you for your looks, then she really doesn't want to really know ALL of you. A relationship is much more then what a person looks like???|`|GC6tMi2saa	i really think that if you stop thinking about your looks and work in the way you talk to girls with out letting them know that you want to date them you will improve the way they look at you some girls just want a friend not a boyfriend and then if you treat them well they fall in love or star to like you better (you have to believe in your self ) if you don't who will ? THAT"S WHAT I THINK !|`|mGU0h3O3aa	You're not a bad looking guy, so your looks shouldn't be what you're stressing over. Just because you aren't getting a lot of attention from girls doesn't mean they don't find you attractive. Maybe try meeting girls from new places, go out to a new club or something. See if any of your friends have a single lady they could set you up on a date with..
VAI6MtPIaa	Being a Maid of Honor is a HUGE responsibility and it doesn't seem like she really wants to help with it. She's shown you many times in where she can't do something or just doesn't show up. She doesn't seem like she's in the right place in her life at the moment to lend a helping hand or be a real part of the wedding. You need support from people.. she should respect it. You need her committment.     Try talking to her first. Tell her that you are unsure if she should be the MOH because she doesn't seem like she wants to and that she hasn't been helping. See what she comes up with. Maybe you can work things out with her so she can be a part of the wedding. Maybe she can be a bridesmaid or someone with a lessened responsibility.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	You must call and tell her not to worry about it you have made other arrangements and she needs to focus on her life right now, period, do not let her talk you into having her in the wedding because she will cause problems one way or the other.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	you have two things you can do:    this is when you take her to lunch and ask her how she's doing and what's going on with her.  Just sit and listen to her.      option 1.  When she's finished tell her that you get the sense that she's not in a place right now where she is able to help you with wedding stuff because of what's going on in her life right now.  Let her know if her life is too complicated right now that it's alright with you if she steps down.    option 2: if you REALLY must have her as MOH or you just can't bring yourself to have the other convo with her then you pick someone else to be MOH and have 2 MOHs.  She can just be the one who stands there next to you and the other can pick up the responsibilities of the MOH and stand by you as well.  in this case lunch is to let her know that you are aware of her situation and  still want her to stand by you but that you don't expect her to take on more than she is able to manage at the moment.|`|757f10afa027007eb6d9e797f2776feaaa	You shouldnt ask her to step down. You should give her the option, and let her decide. Just tell her that you would understand and no hard feelings, however if she doesnt want to step down you can pay for x, y, z but not a, b, c. Just be honest, and throw the ball in her court.|`|ge3meKYEaa	i would talk to her about it and see how she feels, maybe you'll get lucky and she will step down with relief since she doesn't have the money right now.  If she still wants to do it- makes a strict rules and talk about the bills... and about her not showing up at things.  Also tell her, her comments are hurtful- get it all out and have a heart to heart because kicking her out of the wedding.  She might just drop out on her own if given the choice.|`|AA10431095	it sounds like you maid of honour has clinical deppression... before you ask anything from her.... offer to take her to a psychiatrist... it will take one day of your time to get her assessed and only 1 little white tablet a day to fix her up. she will be functioning within a month, and she'll be able ot do asll the things you ask her. with this recession and all... people do get deppressed, especially post-graduaation.    it will be bad if you ask her to step down, now, becasue she will rememeber. but if you help her now, there is still time.    tell her politely that this is what you think is happening to her.. take out your time, and it will be worth it for a lifetime.|`|K1YHSR3oaa	I wouldn't do that.  I think it will only add to the pain and hardships she is already experiencing.  Maybe you should just ask another member of your wedding party to be co-maids of honor.  Or ask your other bridesmaids to help you out and take on some more of the work. As much as you need your friends help, you need to keep in mind how much she probably needs you right now.|`|mkrKHQvFaa	I too am having the same situation with my MOH.  I sat down and had a heart to heart with her more of that I was worried about her.  I asked her if she still wanted to be in the wedding because I just didn't want that added stress on her and that I loved her and just wanted things to get better for her and I didn't feel it was fair for me to add the stress to her life.  She cried, we hugged.  She is still my MOH.  I do not expect her to throw parties for me.  My other BM's are going to pitch in and help with that part.  I have kept frugal on the dress she will be wearing and have offered to buy it for her as my gift to her.  She refused.  The thing is if you talk to her and let her know that you are more worried about her than your wedding she will understand.  If it comes off the other way she will think you are a bridezilla.  So think about what you want to say to her.  Make sure it is 1:1 and private.  Let her know how much you care about her.  Don't make it seem like you want her to step down but you want her to do what is best for her.  Good luck.|`|Gx14PIvxaa	I would think that she would back out on her own. It's nothing personal! A maid of honor should know that she is responsible for a lot. It's not just for fun, it's a serious title!    Sit down and talk to her. She's obviously going through a rough time and needs to talk. You don't have to "ask" her to step down, I'm sure it will come up in conversation that she feels that she needs to.    You are SO mature for saying you feel badly for asking her to make this time "all about you" when she has so many worries. Gosh, to have a friend like that!    Whatever you do, do NOT let this come between your friendship. And do NOT let others badmouth her or come between you. This is between YOU and HER, and it sounds like you are mature and unselfish enough to sit down and hash it out between the two of you.    Good luck!|`|g0ax1LgEaa	I think you need to talk to her. It sounds like you are only of the only people that know what's going on in her life. Tell her you're there for her and ask her if there's any way you can help her.  Let her know that you are concerned and you don't want her to feel like she has to be in your wedding, but if she still does, offer to pay for her dress again, or tell her that you will pay for it, and it'll be her gift from you.  She may like being in the wedding, but stressing about how to pay for it.  All you can do is talk to her and be a friend. You can't solve her problems for her, but you can be the shoulder that she needs right now.
S4QBvAaGaa	I'd feel the same way. I think he avoids the subject because he's conflicted about the family he wants to start and the family he has always had. This is obviously putting stress on you as well though and the lack of communication about something that bothers one spouse can lead to bigger issues. I think you should try and level with him and get him to talk about this situation. You're obviously going to have to start it though it seems.<br>  I have no doubt he might try to start something at your wedding, even if it's not big but I wouldn't let it ruin the wedding. It's your day and if someone want to have a negative time at such a memorable experience for you, it's their loss as long as you're busy enjoying yourself with your new husband. Wow you're gonna be somebody's wife! One of the many comforting thoughts that can sweep your evening in a joyful direction.<br>  Good Luck! :)|`|wYlJjgr0aa	I think he should|`|m43KM9mpaa	Yes I agree I think he should also. He can do it in a respectful way.  He doesn't have to be mean about it.  But it has to be done. <br>  <br>  I understand the need to respect elders but elders need to be respectful also.  <br>  <br>  If his grandfather is so against the marriage and you then why was he even invited?  And if he really feels that way he should have responded to your invitation as a no.<br>  <br>  The only ones that should attend the wedding are those that love and support the couple.  Not those that will come and be miserable.  Doesn't he realize that his grandson loves you and by hurting you he is hurting him?  <br>  <br>  Don't let him upset you, that's what he wants. You have the most wonderful day full of all the love and happiness your heart can hold and show him that nothing he can say or do will upset you.  He only does it because he knows it bothers you. <br>  <br>  Severe all ties with grandpa and don't let him get to you.  Just because you are marrying into the family doesn't mean you have to love or get along with everyone.  <br>  <br>  Tell your fiance that either he starts defending you or you want nothing more to do with grandpa.  Then stand by that decision. Either the old man will come around or he won't but it won't matter because you have wiped your hands of him and the situation.  Be strong.  <br>  <br>  He can't ruin your day if you don't let him get to you.  You are given him the power right now.  Take it back.  So from this day on put a smile on your face, have fun, and enjoy yourself.  I got a feeling your fiance will come through for you .  Give it time. <br>  <br>  Best of luck !  Post pictures !|`|meaTB3Oraa	I've had a similar experience and I have to say yes, he should stick up for you. If he won't stick up for you now, how do you know he'll stick up for you when it matters? <br>  <br>  My ex-girlfriend's parents literally sat me down and went over a list of things they didn't like about me. Among other things, they were concerned that I had a student loan and a car payment, and thus was not debt free. Everything on the list was extreme like that. She sat there as they attacked me and just listened, holding my hand the whole time without saying a word. She didn't agree with what they did at all, but she did nothing, which was the same as agreeing with her parents in my mind. I guess she didn't love me enough to support me, nor did she talk to me about these problems if she agreed with them. It really ate away at me that while her parents were attacking the one she loved, she wouldn't support our relationship. I broke up with her soon after.<br>  <br>  If this is bothering you, you should talk to your fiance about it and let him know you are concerned. Go easy on him though, he may just not know how to handle it and needs some support from you himself. The right guy will find a way to defend his lady when she is threatened, whether the threat be from family or foe. Good luck!|`|pSYzi55Kaa	have you tried talking to his grandfather maybe hes just really feels that you are taking his grandson sway from him he is old maybe hes lonley, but having sid that your man should stick up for you after all you are marrying him what will it be like after the wedding and when the kids come along you dont want him to be mean or nasty to the children just because you are their mum i would talk to your guy and tell him your fears before its to late <br>  <br>  by the way congratulations and good luck I hope it works out for you and have an amazing wedding day

IM only 16 but iv eleanr thow important it is to bear people you dotn really like. tO hang out with people you dont really like. I do it for myself (emotional well being) not others.

XNexFMAYaa	Oooh, I don't know... That's a tough one...<br>  <br>  To be honest, you're being a bit selfish.  It sounds like you don't care or respect your current bf enough to not want to betray him (btw you are, even for WANTING to be with this other boy, even if you don't do it)<br>  <br>  So in my opinion, I think you should break it off with your bf, because if he's like a brother to you, would it really be worth it to lose a good friend?  If you cared deeply for him in a romantic way, you wouldn't even be asking this question because it would never cross your mind.  So give him some respect and break it off.  If things work out with the other guy, then good for you!  But it doesn't guarantee it, just because you're suddenly single too.  Good luck :)  Just try to think of other's feelings too, not just yours
