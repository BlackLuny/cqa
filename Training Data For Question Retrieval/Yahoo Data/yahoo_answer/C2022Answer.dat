The Duo Pro sticks are smaller.|`|d904ae4bfe0897227c426013b23f6ac5aa	U do not need a adaptor as both are same size. But u need to check whether the Sony product supports it.

More like a demo.|`|d904ae4bfe0897227c426013b23f6ac5aa	It means it is a version with less data transfer. Mostly words and no much graphics. It save u money if u use gprs.

Xxviy63Paa	the "progressive is better than interlaced" thing gets repeated like a holy mantra. It is better when all else is equal, but between 1080 and 720, not all else is equal.    Here is the lowdown on pixels:    720p = 1280x720 each frame = 921,600 pixels per frame.    1080p = 1920x1080 each frame = 2, 073, 600 pixels per frame. As people say, 1080p is much better than 720p. Over twice as good.    1080i = 1920x540 each frame = 1, 036, 800 pixels per frame, interlaced every two frams to give the appearance of 1080p.    1080i is, even without considering the interlacing illusion, a higher resolution than 720p by over 10 percent. I've heard 1080i called 540p, which ignores that it has 1920 horizontal pixels, while 540p would be 960 x 540.     1080i is actually a very sharp, high-detailed resolution. The tradeoff of the interlacing is that you'll see some effects with small details, like shimmering, or things that don't move as smoothly. If you're watching high-framerate video, it might look better in 720p. With dvd video's low framerate, it won't matter.    1080i is nowhere near as good as 1080p, but does beat 720p for overall sharpness.     As for dvd upconversion, the ps3's is as good as any other, particularly considering it's regularly updated via the firmware. It is not upscaling. All upscaling does is blow up the image like a photograph without actually increasing the resolution. If you blow up a photograph enough, it will start looking fuzzy. That's upscaling. So if your screen is HD and the image is only upscaled to fit the screen, it will look just like it would on a regular SDTV.    Upconversion is a process that enhances the images, before displaying each frame of video there is software that processes it with various algorithms that detect details and trends in pixel groupings and sharpen them. Sometimes the algorithms get it wrong, so in upconverted video you'll often see areas of the screen that have a light amount of snow on them, pixels that the software enhanced that it shouldn't have. DVD's that have things that are easy to upscale, like lots of lines or fine details already - think CGI or Star Wars movies, stuff like that - will look much better when upconverted. Regular camera-shot movies that are mostly of people usually won't look so great because they were fuzzy in the first place, with most of the screen out of focus. Upconverters don't really have good algorithms for making people look enhanced, or for enhancing fuzzy images.     You may also notice that blu-ray discs in general are far better for CGI movies than camera-shot movies, because in camera movies most of the image is out of focus and doesn't look any better in HD.    Sorry to save this for last, but the ps3's upconversion only works via HDMI output. You can use an HDMI-to-DVI cable and use it, but it won't work with component cables. If you're using component cables to your TV, the upconversion won't work. It's part of copy protection (they don't want people making enhanced copies of dvd's)  |`|xCrxJ9Ibaa	1080p is good   if ure tv supports it  but otherwise id say 1080i|`|gKRnBqHuaa	dude where have u been it has been the future 1080p is so much better for hdmi. but 1080i is alright the only differince is that 1080p is more sharper image and my deltiled.|`|AA10423501	720p|`|22fea6bbc1c8cef52ef90812b5853c9daa	these dudes don't know what they're talknig about (p)rogressive > (i)nterlaced so i go for 720(p) instead of 1080(i).

Respawns are way more action since people just keeping rolling in and blasting everything. Then again it is more mindless shooting but still fun. :)|`|fWclxi9Baa	its not that u cant respawn some of the game modes dont allow respawning like untill the next round yeah i dont like it either but once u get good at getting some shots then it becomes more fun |`|hp9LYD4Aaa	yeah you have to look at the game types and then find the ones that say RESPAWN on the bottom. i had the beta and i got into some respawn games.|`|AA10423501	when you die, wait for the screen to show the "press x" to respawn, you will not respawn automatically...

AA10423501	i prefer my ps3 but i like the 360 controller...|`|ZvH2jZQQaa	i would say the Xbox 360 controller, it is bigger and the buttons are spread out|`|7tYWqmZnaa	I hate Sony's controller with a passion. They have used the same crap design since the PS1 in 1994.|`|2VTiC9X6aa	The Xbox's controller feels a little better to hold, and the position of the analog sticks is better, but the PS3 has much better analog sticks, and it looks better.  I would say that the PS3 controller is better overall.|`|OkJt4Phuaa	Personally, the PS3 controller is better. It's feel and look is much more attractive to me than the Xbox 360 controller.|`|fTLwGi5Waa	i use to have both but i would say that the 360 controller is better because it is a bit bigger and easier to handle|`|jWY0lMu8aa	I like the Sixaxis idea of the PS3 controller, but a change in configuration would be nice. Then again I do not notice how 'small' it is when using it.    I though the size of the xbox controller was perfect.
J5U7hsJWaa	Because Nintendo is based around more family guided games, and GTA wouldn't fit into that mold very well.|`|BjDBXyROaa	 Idk,  I won't mind if they remake San Andres. for Wii which can easly be done.    for one thing because all the brainwashed dummies that think the Wii is only for baby will whine. it should be able go to Wii because there is alot of M rated games to, alongside with the most brutal game in history MadWorld.     oh and for those that keep saying "it for babies" without proof just die. because the M rated games just proves all wrong.   I blame it on the new gamers, and those dumb causal ones.   I'm more of a old school gamer. but I play newer games too but not as much as these old stuff.   what I don't get why people don't care if a M rated game is on the playstation and x-box, but on Wii they want to get rid of it, it's stupid really.     it's possible we may see a GTA on Wii soon, but why the DS first? |`|5JF1J6IAaa	Well, i know i want to play gran turismo 5 but it's on the  ps3. I think it's because,it wasn't made by nintendo.|`|b3YmaEbNaa	because wii is for babies|`|4EF1kykaaa	 probably they didnt want to pay so much money( ok i am so freaking sick of this it is not because the wii is for babies there is a gta coming for the ds there is mad world for the wii  THE WII CAN  HAVE M GAMES BREAKING NEWS most of the people who say the wii is for babies dont have a wii)|`|AA10423501	actually, i think their making a wii version of grand theft auto, i think its called "china wars"... you could google it, to find out more...|`|BqwpzZ6Caa	i don't know

Im 12 and im  getting it!|`|8IQIkYp8aa	Yea its pretty awesome. My friend got it a few days ago and he's so obsessed with it now. But in my opinion, the best game right now is with no question, Bioshock. I picked it up yesterday and it's UNBELIEVABLE. I'm even starting to think that its even better then MGS4. Also, only get little big planet if you have online, otherwise its no fun.|`|FwgGhXsvaa	OF COURSE YOU SHOULD GET IT!!!    It's the best game in the entire world of everything that is good!

j5Apt8hWaa	You can find out ... take a SD memory card with you to a store that sells the S5 IS and do a test ... that will help you learn if the that camera provides the quality images you require.|`|icR505rTaa	I don't know what to tell you, as "good" is a matter of opinion. So, yes, I think it's useable, but not all that good. But hey, don't be so hard on the camera. Of course it's not going to be as good of a video camera as a desinated video camera. On the flip side, video cameras generally don't take good still photos. But like I said, it's useable, but not all that impressive... editing may be a pain too.  There are a lot of photo cameras that have decent video performance, but they still don't compare to that of a video camcorder. For instance, I believe the Canon EOS mk II shoots HD video (please correct me if I'm wrong). It's resolution is impressive, but it sucks in motion. That's because of it's read-reset time which gives it a pretty bad wiggle when you pan or tilt. I imagine that's the case for the Canon Powershot, which only shoots SD. So, in conclusion, it's generally okay-ish, as long as you don't plan on moving it...

75d2b526d72835ba2475910e54e5d617aa	salut,  j'imagine que tu parle de la FM (modulation de frquence) en fran?ais.  il te faut savoir que la modulation de frquence se propage par bons dans l'atmosphre terrestre jusqu' la stratosphre l'onde est renvoye quant elle l'atteint, donc, lorsque le ciel est nuageux et qu'il s'agit de nuages de pluie, car tous les nuages ne sont pas  la mme hauteur dans l'atmosphre les ondes te parviennent plus vite et donc beaucoup mieux; car les nuages forment une sorte de rflecteur qui empche les ondes de se perdre dans l'atmosphre un peu comme lorsque l'on utilise les mains autour de la bouche pour mieux diriger la voix et "porter" la voix vers l'avant au dtriment des cots.    il te faut savoir aussi que certains metteurs mettent en polarisation horizontale alors que ton antenne de voiture est polarise verticalement c'est le cas de France inter de France culture et de France musique et qu'ils mettent avec des antennes directives c'est  dire que le signal  puissance gale et concentr sur quelques degrs alors que la plupart des metteurs sont en omnidirectionnelle c'est  dire qu'ils mettent sur 360 et avec une forme de demie sphre ce qui fait que lorsque les nuages sont trs bas le signal qui se perd vers le haut est bloqu et rflchit par les nuages donc ? marche mieux  A+|`|016bb02806632148205601bfd6307763aa	Les ondes radio "rebondissent" sur les microgoutelettes d'eau qui constituent les nuages.

The latest is the best - old rule for new IT.|`|AA10401458	Multimedia  The Symbian OS is pretty adept at multimedia, with integrated support for audio and video playback and recording, though not all those capabilities are realized on the devices themselves. The Nokia 9300, for instance, comes with both an MP3 player and the mobile version of RealPlayer, which enables playback of RealAudio, RealVideo, and MP3 files. But it can capture neither audio nor video.    Third-party apps  A recent check of software site Handango revealed more than 5,500 third-party apps for the Symbian OS--not quite up to Palm and Windows Mobile levels, but far more than you'll find on other cell phone operating systems. That's another big point in Symbian's favor, especially if you're weighing it against other phones.|`|AA12310339	nada..nicht....nein.....no|`|f2cfbae64be87e08060a8936a13ab4e5aa	they r very easy to use, u can say dat they r juss problem free devices, well if u r planning to buy a nokia phone den it shud be of S60, coz S60 phones of nokia has the largest compilation of softs!!  best of luck|`|d3deb4f6005db1b21487d5cb6b060cf5aa	Nokia 6600 and others use the Os it is good and user friendly U need an anti virus also|`|d904ae4bfe0897227c426013b23f6ac5aa	There is a lot o forum users which can share with u experience on the symbian os phone.

Yes, but that only fixes the lighter grinding noise the ps2 makes when the laser is struggling to move up and down the little bars. "Dude, if you're hearing that bad grinding noise when you turn it on, buy a new worm motor.", say many people. Well this is true only on one case. If you have oiled the bars and the laser still fails you may need a new worm motor. But thats only if you let the grinding noise go on continuously and play it every day like that. Now if your system still makes the grinding noise even when the bars are oiled you might have worn out the motor. Or this fix will save your ps2.  1. Open the disc drive up.  2. Remove the disc tray. Take it clear out, but leave the system to think that it's still closed.  3. Look for the laser part and look at the disc spinner. See that little button to the right of the spinner thats on the chip. This may not be being contacted when the laser moves down and grinds.  4. Pull up lightly on the plastic that is on the worm gear, and slide the laser down.  5. Does any part of the laser/plastic part push in that little switch? If no, this will fix your system.  6. Take a small piece of plastic, and before you glue, align it with the plastic laser part and the switch, so that when it slides down the rail, it pushes in the button when the laser comes to the spinner. Mark where you are going to glue it on the plastic around the laser, and apply super glue to the bottom of the plastic piece. Put it in the spot you marked, and make sure it aligns again. If not, remove piece and replace it on the plastic.  7. Allow glue to dry FULLY! Then slide the laser back down again and make sure it pushes the piece back in. Then, make sure the plastic is clicked back in between the gears so worm gear will spin and the laser will move back and forth with no problems.  8. When finished, CAREFULLY put back the disc tray and put it into place. Be patient about this part, never hasty.  9. Turn on system and wait. If done correctly the system shall turn on, and the worm gear will spin and the laser will move down.Then the plastic will push the button in and start reading! No more grinding again! Ever! As long as the bars are oiled when needed, no more problems about that should occur, unless the motor dies (for some unexplained reason), or the plastic comes unglued. :)|`|49bc95e536997e2638ca74e09150ae4faa	It is saying it is time to take it into a Gamestop and trade it in to get a PS3|`|AA10380609	It's a pretty common issue, especially on the model SCPH-39001 and SCPH-50001.

Les acteurs n'avaient pas la possiblit de pouvoir compter sur autre chose qu'eux mme et taient dans l'obligation de jouer convenablement leur r?le.  Ajourd'hui ils peuvent compter sur tout un tas d'effets spciaux pour faire passer un acteur moyen et un scnario pas terrible.    Je ne dis pas que tout est comme cela aujourd'hui non plus.    Mais les acteurs avaient des gueules et de la gouaille !    Pourrait-on aujourd'hui refaire des films tels que les tontons flingueurs ou les vieux de la vieille ? Je pense qu'en couleur, cela n'aurait pas le mme effet. Ils suffit de voir les films qui ont t coloriss. Ca n'a plus le mme aspect.    Mais c'tait une autre poque, et c'est galement l'esprit de cette poque que je recherche en regardant ces films.|`|16fbabeefd4dfd0c27365a4507a52ed7aa	qui aime le cinma aime forcment le NetB.

Les films de guerre et de gangsters ne sont pas trop ma tasse de th. Le jugement de Nuremberg tait excellent aussi (avec Judy Garland, Montgomery Clift, Marlene Dietrich, Maximillian Schell, Burt Lancaster, Tracey Spencer, William Shatner, etc.).

Je suis un grand fan des films d'Akira Kurosawa et de La Traverse de Paris, sans mentionner Hitchcock et la Twilight Zone.|`|bd27c03a9c3881a4ed2e1395e182439eaa	Ah oui!     Surtout les films de l'age d'or d'Hollywood avec Fred Astaire, Ginger Rogers, Gene Kelly et les autres.     Il y a un film des annes 90 qui est en noir et blanc et que j'adore c'est : Pi de Darren Aronofsky.   Le noir et blanc renforce le climat angoissant, morbide et tortur du film....  C'est d'ailleurs un des rares films que je n'ai pas pu regarder jusqu' la fin mais je ne desespre pas!

545576841259ec5ed445e85d46b79898aa	Yes you will need a new reciever, as well as a subscription to an HDTV service. You will also need new cables- if your reciever has it, then HDMI is the best.|`|hUEnwHNQaa	Well, if you want just your local channels in HD, then you dont need a box. You'll get up to about 7 channels in HD without the box. But if you would like Hbo, cinemax, and stars in HD along with a couple of extra movie and concert channels in HD.....you will need concast's dvr and you will have about 15 HD channels with the dvr which also acts as a HD reciever. If you dont want the dvr service, then it will be about 5 extra dollars a month but you will still need the dvr, you just wont get the dvr service. If you DO choose to use the dvr service, then it will be about 12 extra dollars a month. So basically, if you want your local channels in HD, you dont need a box, but if you want more HD channels, get the comcast dvr. And if you do choose to get the box, comcast will set you up with some component cables so you dont have to buy any cables.|`|w6U3OPCmaa	you cable provider will set it up for you. if your looking for an HDTV try checking out Secondact.Com or Biz, its a refurb site but i got a 32in jvc for $500 and its awsome.|`|hXDxvQczaa	You will need either a digital cable receiver or cable card (if your tv accepts those).  Another option is an over-the-air antenna to receive those HD channels in your area that are broadcast over the air.  Either way, to get TRUE HD (1080p) you will need a 1080p capable tv, connected to your source via HDMI cables.  That's the only way to get TRUE HD.  A lot of people can't tell the difference between a 720p tv with HD, and 1080p tv with HD....but I can :o)

There is also the wii sports disks.  These are very fun with friends.  Call of duty WAW is also pretty good.  It is the best online FPS right now.

o6JCM59Faa	"In addition to A-GPS, iPhone 3G uses signals from GPS satellites, Wi-Fi hot spots and cellular towers to get the most accurate location fast. If GPS is available, iPhone displays a blue GPS indicator. But if you’re inside — without a clear line of sight to a GPS satellite — iPhone finds you via Wi-Fi. If you’re not in range of a Wi-Fi hot spot, iPhone finds you using cellular towers." So jailbreaking or unlocking isn't necessary at all. But it may take longer to work (GPS) than having A-GPS.

AA10380609	Not straight up.  I'm not sure what they're paying for used systems now, but last I heard it was $60.  The used systems are $119 if I'm not mistaken.  So you'd have to trade your PS2 + at least $50 for a XBOX at GameStop.  Just go to www.gamestop.com and find your local gamestop... .call them and ask what they're paying for PS2s and how much the xbox's cost.|`|4425b2168542e78a95e2a4f59b641a72aa	EB is bought out by Gamestop now.  So go to gamestop.com or your local gamestop stores.  Yes, you can...    I think they are running a special right now, 3 games traded in, with 20% extra credit.

AA10380609	No but you may have deeper problems!  I would try a friend's controller before I blame the controller.  Many times, a fuse on the playstation 2 motherboard will blow, ceasing function of the vibrate on the controller.  If you try your controller on someone else's system and it vibrates, your motherboard has a blown fuse.  If your controller is broken -- just get another one.. they're cheap enough nowadays.  If you don't know anyone with a ps2, take the controller to your local game store -- they should be glad to check the vibrate function for you.
81a3ef6cdba6f5dc0c0d4893e185acf1aa	Hi....    I hope you find the following info/links instructive:    First the i is interlaced and the p is progressive.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hdtv    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1080p    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1080i    And a Cnet comparison:    http://reviews.cnet.com/4520-6449-636160...    Here is a little from that review:    2. Why 1080p is theoretically better than 1080i  1080i, the former king of the HDTV hill, actually boasts an identical 1,920x1,080 resolution but conveys the images in an interlaced format (the i in 1080i). In a tube-based television, otherwise known as a CRT, 1080i sources get "painted" on the screen sequentially: the odd-numbered lines of resolution appear on your screen first, followed by the even-numbered lines--all within 1/30 of a second. Progressive-scan formats such as 480p, 720p, and 1080p convey all of the lines of resolution sequentially in a single pass, which makes for a smoother, cleaner image, especially with sports and other motion-intensive content. As opposed to tubes, microdisplays (DLP, LCoS, and LCD rear-projection) and other fixed-pixel TVs, including plasma and LCD flat-panel, are inherently progressive in nature, so when the incoming source is interlaced, as 1080i is, they convert it to progressive scan for display.

RQXN3cwkaa	Fuji makes several really nice super-zoom cameras that have many of the controls that an SLR has without the expensive price tag.<br>  <br>  These 2 models will be in your price range. They will give you MUCH more range on the zoom and will accept any XD memory cards you may have with your Stylus 850:<br>  <br>  Fuji FinePix S8100fd ($250)<br>  Fuji FinePix S1000fd ($200)|`|AA10929465	Your camera is well above average for a point and shoot. The only thing it's really lacking is good low light/night shots.  If you insist on getting another compact digital camera, I'd recommend something in the Fujifilm Finepix F series (F10, F30...).  That will fill your only real gap.  <br>  <br>  Then again, like someone else said, for that price you might find a much higher optical zoom.  <br>  <br>  Seriously, I'd recommend saving your money until you can afford an entry level digital SLR.

6d9184393c28fb06658453d51ee0e853aa	1. make sure your psp has version 2.0 or above, do this by going to Settings-> SystemSettings-> SystemInformation-> and the version should be listed as well as other things. if your system is 2.0 skip to  3 if not continue to  2.    2. To upgrade to 2.0 go to www.us.playstation.com/psp and update is one of the options just connect your usb cord and upgrade from the game file.    3. Now go to Settings-> NetworkSettings-> InfrastructureMode -> NewConnection-> Scan-> Find the access point (a wifi signal)-> Continue->Enter the WEP key if necessary->EasySettings->MakeaNickname-> Continue-> Save-> Test-> Hopefully it was sucessful!!!

You might also find that the heavily discounted phone is only that cheap if you take out a new contract. So you would have to pay for two contracts until your original one expired.    In either case it might be worth it.

fae55f589c6128d56bc2c1b82a0a7ac5aa	No tiene nada que ver que sean de litio para que sean ms baratas.  Claro ,existen baterias de litio para digitales(normalmente las Reflex usan este tipo).Y funcionan muy bien;tambin con pilas normales funcionan las digitales muy bien;depende del gasto que se haga de energa(Flash,pantalla,remirar mucho las fotos hechas,etc.).  En resumen,que las cmaras con mayor consumo de energia suelen usar baterias de Litio(que son recargablesy vienen con su cargador las cmaras).Y las cmaras menos gastonas usan pilas AA o pilas recargables NiMh.  Si quieres mira mis fotos aqui:  http://www.flickr.com/photos/21386602@N0...|`|mzF7JjKkaa	Si por supuesto, claro que las hay y son lo mas comn ahora.

TgBYy6HBaa	Any time you change devices on a networking device it's a great idea to power cycle the network.  That would go as follows:    1. Power down the devices (xbox, computer, etc)  2. Power down the router (skip if you don't have a router)  3. Power down the modem  4. Wait about 2 minutes.  5. Power on the modem and wait until the lights indicate it is fully connected.  6. Power on the router and wait until the lights indicate it is fully connected.  7 Power on the device you want to use.    Oftentimes when you swap devices the IP adress can get screwed up unless you reset everything (your xbox is probably trying to get connected with an IP it was assigned by the router and the modem doesn't recognize the old IP now that the router is gone)    If this doesn't fix the problem and your ISP is not having any downtime in your area, your next step is to call 1 800 4MY XBOX and have them walk you through what they know.  They normally can get you through some of the stranger problems.
bIi0PlxFaa	Unless there are special promotions from websites and programs affiliated with the producers/label of Hannah Montana, there will not be a legal way to get their songs for free.    To check for free songs, check for the band's MySpace, and do a google search. Find their label's website and the band's own website, and see if they list any news corresponding to recieving free songs.    If not, you can pay iTunes person, or per CD to download the music, legally.     Avoid piracy, it is against the law and there is a chance that you can get arrested and/or receive a very hefty monetary fine.|`|mDWiTJAOaa	maybe on mp3review.info.
0cd14558b59bca02f88377d3fee26645aa	It depends on what package you purchase. A regular $200 PSP package comes with the PSP, AC adapter, and battery only. The Entertainment Pack comes with a 1GB Memory Stick, Lords Of Dogtown Video UMD, and ATV Offroad Fury: Blazin' Trails Game UMD, and the contents of the basic package. The Value Pack comes with a 32MB (much smaller than 1GB) Memory Stick, headphones, wrist strap, soft case, and the contents of the basic package. The Giga Pack comes with a 1GB Memory Stick, headphones, soft case, other accessories, and the contents of the basic package. If you want just the PSP and Memory Stick, your best bet would be the Entertainment Pack. If you don't need a 1GB stick, and you need headphones, a case, and a wrist strap, the Value Pack is more expensive, but it's a good choice. If you need the full house, then the Giga Pack is the most expensive, but it's the best one to get.    In conclusion, the basic PSP package doesn't come with a Memory Stick, the Value Pack comes with a 32MB stick, and the Entertainment Pack and Giga Pack both come with a 1GB stick.    General prices are here:    Basic: $200  Entertainment: $300  Value: $400  Giga: $500    Enjoy!|`|d904ae4bfe0897227c426013b23f6ac5aa	It depends on the package type u want to buy. Standard pkg are cheap but only got the PSP, charger and manual. Value Pack will contains the PSP, charger, manual, casing, data cable, 32MB card and other accessories. But 32MB is too small if u play ISO files games.|`|kkor2VUmaa	it depends if you buy a new psp youll get a 564mb card there you go buddy
7HbB4VzSaa	Yeah your graphics card it pretty bad man. If you got some extra cash on you I can point you in the right direction on what you should get for that price.  If you don't wanna upgrade then I guess you just have to deal with it sorry man.    You can upgrade like any computer it is just harder to do in a laptop.|`|FB9CU3RCaa	What you can do is remove temporary Internet files, remove downloaded program files (such as Microsoft ActiveX controls and Java applets), empty the Recycle Bin, remove Windows temporary files, remove optional Windows components that you don't use, and remove installed programs that you no longer use. After you've done this, you can put the game on high graphics, etc.|`|iHPlIMOYaa	Gon't listen to that Guy freeing up hard drive space does not make games perform much better.    Most medium to high tech computers run Crysis at about 30 FPS(frames per second).  Even systems with Quad core processors & SLI(two video cards) to back it up only get up to about 40 FPS on high(not very high) settings with no Anti- Aliasing .    I myself average about 26 FPS with a 3GHz AMD Athlon X2,  a GeForce 8800 GT, and 2 GB of RAM on medium to low settings.  Still looks gorgeous though.    ADD-  Your graphics card sucks.  Thats the problem.  You can squeeze better performance if you buy a better graphics card.  The GeForce 9600GT & 8800GT are really good cards for about $150-$170.    Laptops are cool and portable and all, but they aren't the best for gaming- especially games like Crysis which are very hardware intensive.  Sorry but for your comp you're gonna have to settle for low settings- dont worry its still a great game.      Pro-tip:  hit ctrl+alt+del and use the task manager to close down unnessary processes and programs to hopefully get some better performance.  You can even close 'explorer.exe' and use the task manger to open it again by clicking 'run and typing in the program name.|`|tDM1RVH4aa	I'm surprised it loads at all on a 8400.  You want at least a 8800 or a 9800.  8400 is a budget card, which I wasn't even sure supported 3d until now.    A 8400 is NOT better than a 7800, nor is a 8600, so when it says 7800 or better, you are technically not above the requirements.  A higher number doesn't necessarily mean it's faster, the second number would have to be the same or higher.|`|GamCopDPaa	to add to Enrique M's answer the graphics card is limited by your CPU and RAM so make sure you at least have 2gigs of ram and a dual (preferably quad) core processor
ih5SidPUaa	on my L7 the memory card is on the right side under the little rubber dust cover. its a small SD card about the size of one of the keys (ie. 1,2,*, ) .|`|hUEnwHNQaa	it is located behind the battery, but if you just purchased it, there is no memory card in it.

N6JuTH0Iaa	Yes good question. The "Safari" on the 2g iPod touch can access almost any webpage. It can access the regular versions of MySpace and Facebook, and you can also download apps for MySpace and Facebook that are much faster than using the actual webpage. The apps are free so this is very helpful. Please check out my blog about the 2nd Generation iPod Touch, that I just started before you buy it so you know the tricks of the trade. My blog is http://ipodtouch2g-dje.blogspot.com/  Thanks and good luck with the iPod|`|d904ae4bfe0897227c426013b23f6ac5aa	Yes, u can access Myspace, Yahoo and Facebook on your iPod Touch. I even use the iPod Touch to answer questions on Yahoo Answers. Just take note that u can't copy and paste and not flash enabled.|`|pFyZWE2kaa	Yes, so long as the webpage isn't password protected or something like that.    However, some webpages cannot be accessed by Safari as they are too big in size. Oh, and there's no Flash nor copy and paste yet.

09644ZZSaa	There are many levels to bluetooth. A lot of phones now are only compatible with bluetooth audio (most mono, some stereo). This depends sometimes on phone model and sometimes on the carrier's software. Only one phone (Nokia 3650 eek) I have had with Bluetooth actually supported file transfer. The phone came with software as well. I'm pretty sure the Strobe (which Virgin Mobile isn't the only carrier of Kyocera phones, Alltel also carries them) needs the data cable in order to transfer files (unless you email them).|`|nay7AO3Daa	I think the Strobe has the file transfer feature locked. you can check with Virgin to verify|`|mDWiTJAOaa	I think you should get somethig diffrent from everybody so an kyocera

d904ae4bfe0897227c426013b23f6ac5aa	You can insert the music to iTunes using Add file and it will automatically change your wma file to a MP3 file. As u bought online, it has a licence attached to the song where u can download to your MP3 player for a maximum of 5 times only. If you have problem with the licence of the song, you can consult the online store.
ClCHUjKUaa	yeah you need to install the zune software    from there it is about the same as using software like itunes or windows media player|`|895c61d53a7ffc4de8304a5ff26a1b3aaa	Use Zune marketplace.|`|1fhP1oddaa	To delete =  Open media player* plug in mp3/4* highlight song/s* right click mouse and choose delete*
AqWRI3G5aa	yes, of course! it has video, widescreen viewing of the videos and pictures, ipod with coverflow and it has the real internet just like the iphone! you can even download songs directly from itunes onto it without using a computer as a middleman. then when hooked up to your computer, it transfers the songs from your ipod touch into your itunes library.    http://www.apple.com/ipodtouch/|`|jk4Hbo6iaa	ya it plays videos
UphoLYGYaa	There is only one 80gb model and it comes bundled with motorstorm.|`|ad2faoKcaa	The 80GB with Motorstorm is the only version of the 80GB that's being sold.    Sony has announced that they won't be making anymore 80GB PS3's once retailers have depleted their current stock. That's the bad news !    The good news has Sony set to announce a new PS3 version at the GDC (Game Developers Conference) set for February 18-22 in San Francisco. It's expected Sony will announce a new 120GB PS3 equipped with the Dual Shock 3 controller and the return of the PS2's "Emotion Engine" CPU processor allowing for near 100% Backwards Compatibility !    The price is supposedly going to remain the same as the 80GB, $499 !|`|AA10423501	the 80gig pack comes in the limited edition bundle with motorstorm... they don't sell the 80gig by itself... i'm not sure in japan though... if you're planning on buying the 80gig, buy it now, i read on the internet that they are phasing out 80gig version with other version... or you can wait and see what's coming next...

2Hx3mXhTaa	put the ps3 on standby so it is a red light, then when you turn it on, use the touch button but don't let it go.    press your finger down and leave it there for about 10 seconds until you hear a second beap. the video settings will be reset and then you can set them to w/e you want|`|AA10423501	press and hold the power button from the console for about 10seconds... this will restore your audio settings...|`|8Fn1KV1Saa	I had the same problem.

But, if you like downloading demos /tv shoes / movies/ game trailers/ profile pics/gamer themes/arcade games/ patches / new maps/ playing XBOX Originals:      -You'll want to make sure you have at least a memory card(arcade system) if not a hard drive(Seperately/Premium/Elite) if you're really interested in those things.|`|e0ynKGMeaa	Yes!

sKqrFqENaa	I have the w910i and I am very pleased with it. I have not played with the N95 so I cant give a comment on that one.     The w910i has a great music player, camera quality is excellent even though it is only a 2mp, so overall I dont think you would be disappointed with the w910i    Hope this helps    Tracey xxx|`|xQjToANXaa	Hey,   You have not described that mainly what you are looking for in your mobile and what is your budget. If you are interested in music and your budget is 170.17 then you should go with SE w910i. Its a very light for a 3G phone, weighing just 86 grams. Its a compact slider, with a 320x240 pixel resolution screen, expandable memory, an FM radio, 2 megapixel camera (plus a video calling camera) and Bluetooth. You can visit the place http://www.blueunplugged.com/p.aspx?p=12... before going any other store. If you are looking for more and advanced features like 5.0 mega pixel Carl Zeiss lens, DVD-like video quality with stabilization feature, wifi technology and GPS function and budget is 246.77 then you should visit http://www.blueunplugged.com/p.aspx?p=11...   Now this is up to what would you like?.|`|d904ae4bfe0897227c426013b23f6ac5aa	W910 if u are not a experience phone user on symbian software. N95 allows u to do more things with your phone if u know how to play with it. W910 is simple but packed with features like MP3, videos, photos, games and many other apps.Visit my blog http://www.pspmyspace.com|`|AcKYYf3caa	n95 i had w910i and wasnt that impressed n95 got more features|`|rUeoG8Jaaa	n95|`|OL5WYfAOaa	I work in a phone store and they are both good phones but they both have lots of problems with them. There is to much on the N95 so all it does is crash and the w910i, which i have turns itself on and off all the time for no reason. What about the Nokia 6500 slide or a sony ericsson c902, both really good phones very good cameras on both and are both really reliable phones.

But there is the facts!!! Is your Descion, they both are Great Consoles    Right Now i think the Xbox 360 is better but in the end, which means in like 2009 and later, I think the PS3 Will Prevail and beat out the Xbox 360 But right now the 360 online is better and has more games.|`|fYtISqaSaa	PS3 because of excellent processor and a lower failure rate than x box 360. xbox360 has 16% failure rate that is crazy.

Call your electronics store and ask if they have any USB hubs in stock.|`|CPXsFgp9aa	It should have came with a usb splitter, I think my cusin's came with that when he bought guitar hero world tour. But im not sure. His ps3 also is only 2 usb ports and I think i've seen his ps3 using all the instruments at one time. My ps3 comes with 4 usb ports so i dont have to worry about that. Anyways All i know is that the ps3 does support for usb splitters so you could add more controllers but you have to make sure it is a powered one. One that like connects to the power outlet. I think the guitar hero people sell one but its like 20 bucks so look one up on ebay there they will be cheaper.

0fMLMFJ6aa	First of all it is capable of being played at HDTV quality (if you have an hdtv).  You are able to hook it up to xbox live (the internet) and on here you are able to download game demoes, extra content for games (at a cost), videos, and even arcade games (also at a cost).  You are able to transfer photos to it and rip cd's on to it (and listen to them while you play the game).  It plays dvd's and for extra 200 bucks you can buy an hd dvd player (plays videos in hd).  Ummm...what else is there...you can play old xbox games on the 360 (most of them anyways).  The more expensive version comes with a 20 GB hard drive which allows you to save your games, game demos, songs, etc. without a memory card or anything.  You can use up to 4 controllers on it.  Cons for it are that it has a humongous power brick which you'll have to hide somewhere (on the cord that plugs into the wall).  It also is not the quietest machine out there.  Since it's been out almost a whole year ahead of ps3 and wii....it has alot more games out there for it (now anyways) that are worth buying.|`|AEkpzmA8aa	Requirements?  A TV and a good broadband connection for Xbox Live.  It looks amazing on both my 42" HDTV and my crappy little 14 inch" CRT.    The 360 has been out the longest of the next gen systems so it has the biggest game library as of now and by far the most complete online solution in Xbox Live.  A year subscription will run you about $50 but it is definitely worth the price for all the content that's available.  Paired with an HDTV, the 360 can put out some seriously awesome graphics, and is even quieter now that they've replaced the loud DVD drive with a better one.    You can stream movies from PC to 360, rip music, play playlists off your iPod while playing games (takes out game music and uses your own), play arcade classics and original games on Xbox Live Arcade, video/audio chat, download full length HD movies, plays DVD's, HD-DVDs (with addon), view pictures, download game demos, etc.    All fun stuff.|`|AA11353613	it kicks ***. the wireless remotes arecawesome. just get game fly &  HD TV|`|FUQdPUaJaa	The Graphics are unreal   and if u get one and you like  football games get NCAA football 07   On High Def T.V.

But I'm assuming that you already got one with those inputs.    It comes in 2 version, the core and the premium.  Main difference between th premium and the core is that the premium has:  1.  20gb hard drive while the core has none.  2.  Out of the box, the premium contains a wireless controller, while core has a wired controller.  3.  Premium has component-composite cable while core has composite cable.  If you want to play SOME (VERY IMPORTANT) XBX games, then you'll need the hard drive.  Go to www.xbox.com and do a search for backward compatibility to find the list of XBX games that are currently playable on the 360.    If you want to play with or against other people online, then you'll need to get a subscription to XBL.  It's 50 years a year.

gqUxFSmkaa	Well, I don't think it matters whether or not the disc is in it, it's how often the PS3 freezes because if its really often than you should probably take it to get fixed or check the fan there may be something wrong with that too.|`|AA10423501	just hold the power button on the console until it restarts...     and be sure you have the latest update for the game and the console...|`|ilScrvPEaa	Check if your PS3 has a 10cm gap around it for a proper air flow.

If the wire is carrying direct current, it will generate a magnetic field which can by detected by a compass.|`|82c034bbba1a57407446ce3e9b74f6f2aa	Yes there are.  They also have ones that you clip around the wire to test for current.  Your local radio shack will have in-expensive tools for you to check current.

Metal Gear Solid 4, Ratchet and Clank Future: Tools of Destruction, HAZE, Resistance 1&2, Killzone 2, Uncharted: Drake's Fortune, Heavenly Sword, Warhawk, God of War 3, Tekken 6, Twisted Metal PS3, etc. are all games worth getting a PS3 for. Plus all the multi-platform games. Anyways, if you get bored with any of those games you could always use the PS3 as the center of your home entertainment needs.
7tYWqmZnaa	PS3 games are on the 360. Final Fantasy 13 and Tekken 6 most recently.  Microsoft, the company that makes the XBOX won't ever release games on anything other then DVD. The engine that the game uses has nothing to do with the hardware in the console, well it does, but I don't feel like explaining that to you. BluRay isn't needed for games. You can get just as much space with multiple discs as you can on BluRay.

8c5ea0e99e236b290a06b18822fb87adaa	Perhaps the audio file is in the wrong format.  If you can check the file on your computer, do it.  See if it is a .mp3, .wav or some other kind of file.  Compare that to your user manual for your mp3 player.   If the song is not in the correct format, you can convert it with conversion software.  Many conversion software programs have trial versions.  Total Video Converter is a good example.  After you convert the file you want into the correct format, put it on your mp3 player.
ilScrvPEaa	There is no way to make it. Compatibility is based on some hardware from PS2. 40GB, new 80GB and upcoming don't have that type of hardware.|`|4Pk6VNftaa	You can't.  If you want to play PS2 games, Sony says you should buy a PS2.    Only the discontinued 20GB, 60GB models and the older 80GB model, could play PS2 games at all.    Starting with the 40GB model, all PS3s going forward will not play PS2 games at all.|`|AA10423501	theres no way to do that... (yet)  |`|o0b6Ha49aa	Lack of hard drive. You can't.

Xxviy63Paa	If this is happening on an online server, check your internet connection first and foremost before you buy any new hardware.    Even if your connection is fine, check with the host of the server, too. Most of the time lag is caused by the host not having enough upload bandwidth to handle all the players in the room. A lot of people don't even know what their upload is, because their provider only tells them the download. They'll say, well, I've got 5mbits/s of download, I'll set the room to 20 people. Except they've only got 300 kbits/s upload, enough for 4 to 6 players. Lag city, and the players usually blame each other, or the last player to get there, or the one with the highest ping.    If it's happening offline, which it really shouldn't on a 7-series Nvidia and 64-bit Athlon, still don't jump to conclusions. Look at your PC's running processes and shut down anything that may be taking up processing power that doesn't need to be. Like a messager. Or any program you've got running. Give the game as much of the pc to work with as you can.    If it still lags offline, the surest fix is to upgrade the most important thing, the gpu. You could trade the GeForce 7300 for a better 7-series, 7800 ideally, or you could take the opportunity to put an 8-series card in there, if your MB can handle one.  |`|AA10423501	that game should run ok on your pc... maybe its your internet connection... or if not, try upgrading your video card, try a cheap 8600gt... that should run most good games...

2148ec18f7e3c24298fb6a3389e966c3aa	On the back of your plasma or on the side of the plasma you will see three jacks next to each other either vertically or horizontally. They will be yellow, red, and white.(maybe not in that order). Take the cords connected to your playstation and plug each jack into the right one(according to color).     The jacks should have a label beside or below them that says which port they are plugged in. For example, video 2 or componant one, or componant 2, or front video, or side video. Once you know what port they are plugged into you have to get to that on your screen. Your plasma should have come with a TV remote get that remote and find the button the button that coresponds to the port your playstation is plugged into. If you do not have a button for that port then look for a TV/Video button. Press that button to scroll through the ports(video 1,video2, componant 1). Scroll till you find the port your playstation is on.

8c5ea0e99e236b290a06b18822fb87adaa	It is probably a format/compatibility issue.  Make sure your music files are in mp3 format.  Your phone supports other formats(AAC, AAC+), but I have not had too much luck with other formats on Motorola phones.  Keep in mind, just because a song is in mp3 format, it is not a guarantee it will work.  Not all codecs are created equal.  Take note as to which conversion program you use for which song, or what source you obtained the music from in order to figure out what is a reliable source of music for you.  Good luck!|`|AA10006282	This may be a DRM (Digital rights management) issue. They files might be getting 'ignored' by the phone because it's unclear if these are legitimately your songs (paid for).

8c5ea0e99e236b290a06b18822fb87adaa	There are two basic ways with Nextel phones.    1.  If your phone has an SD card slot, buy an SD card ($15-$80) and a multicard reader ($15).  Turn your phone off and put your memory card in the SD card slot.  Turn your phone on and format your SD card.  Turn your phone off and remove the SD card.  Connect the multicard reader to your computer.  Put your SD card in the multicard reader.  Click on START > MY COMPUTER > and double click on REMOVABLE STORAGE DEVICE.  This will open a window.  Leave this window open and open the folder on your computer containing the music you want to add to your phone.  Drag-and-drop.    2.  If you have a phone with mobile web and you pay for a data plan, you can find streaming music easily.  Since Nextel uses Microsoft Pocket Internet Explorer, it should be a snap.    http://nextelonline.nextel.com/NASApp/on...  Multicard reader:  http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?...

bgiZxmHlaa	Alot of prepaid companies are coming out with that but the problem is they are ridiculously high (you could just get a plan for what they are charging. lol.) So I'd go with a Cingular GoPhone. They have an option exactly like what you're looking for. I think the plan is 39.99 for 600 mins and texts are paid for each text you send (not sure though) and it's Cingular which picks up anywhere. LOL. Does that help?|`|HaYweggHaa	You didn't say what state/area you live in. I have T-Mobile and as soon as the contract runs out I'm switching back to Cingular/ATT. (I had them for 12 years and they really do have the best coverage.)  My wife went for years and didn't want a cell phone. I bought her a phone and the Metro PCS service. (It's here in Northern California and a lot of other places I guess.) With Metro PCS, the coverage isn't as great as other companies because they use the old CDMA/TDMA systems. The good thing is that there are no pre-set minutes a month. You can use as many or as little minutes as you want. The catch is that you have to ONLY call from your regional area. You CAN call anywhere in the US for free though with no extra charges and/or long distance charges. (The basic plan is $30 a month with no long distance free. If you pay an extra $5 a month to the $35 plan you do get unlimited nationwide long distance though.) They have some pretty decent phones but none of them are free like the other carriers. They have phones from $49 for a Samsung to $199 for a Razr.  I bought my niece in South Carolina a phone and got her hooked up with AllTel. They have a plan where you can be anywhere in the US and make calls anywhere to the US for $49.99 a month. I have the bill sent to me in California every month. I know that AllTel is in a lot more states than Metro is too.   It just depends on where you make your calls from. The Metro "Bay Area" plan has a pretty big region as the home region. They also have the "Sacramento Valley region and a lot more in Southern California.|`|b6afb07e17db139c29f0e94c8a82d683aa	You might want to look into the Go Phone by Cingular.

Ha. You need a program that can rip the DVD to your computer. DVD files are normally .VOB files. I suggest using DVD Shrink. I use it all the time, works like a charm.    [Can be found here: http://www.afterdawn.com/software/video_... ]    I believe it imports it as AVI format. I'm not 100% positive.    The next step, which is the harder one, is converting the file. I believe iPod Video, which is what I had to do when I did it with my iPod Video (stopped doing it, became too much of a hassle), is to convert the file into .MOV or maybe .M4A files. I believe they are these files, I know for a fact that .MOV works, not 100% on .M4A. Once you convert the file, it should import with no problem.

Y0X1rHChaa	Converting video to an iPod for free is'nt a one step process. Firstly, you have to convert to .avi then to .mov.    What you will need:  a dvd to avi ripper program (we used the free DVDx 2.3 off of sourceforge)   an avi to mov (quicktime) program (we used the trial version of Xilisoft Video Converter)   the new itunes 6.0 (free download from apple)     Procedure  Load your DVD in DVDx 2.3 by choosing OpenDVD Root from the drop down menu and navigating to and selecting the VIDEO_TS file of your DVD.  Prepare your input settings for the dvd in DVDx 2.3. In  DVDx 2.3 you should choose the correct video track,  language of audio, output frame rate, and subtitles in the  Input Settings menu  Next, choose the correct parameters in the Output Settings menu. Choose AVI, Export Settings resolution of 320x240, choose a video codec (we used Cinepak), etc. and click Apply.  Now rip the dvd by clicking on the red encode button on the bottom right.  This process may take quite a bit of time and disk space depending on the quality and length of the video. Next launch Xilisoft Video Converter and choose File > Add. Navigate to the .avi file you just created with DVDx 2.3. Now on the bottom left of the window choose QuickTime Format (*.mov). Choose a destination for the file you will create. Lastly, change the video size in the right hand column to 320x240 and click the Encode button.    Launch iTunes 6 and choose File > Add File to Library.  Choose the .mov file you created in the last step. Click on Videos in the left column and double click on your file to make sure the video works. Load it on your shiny new iPod (or not) and enjoy.|`|DF3c8Wuwaa	Try to use the great Cucusoft iPod Video Converter Suite which can convert both DVD media and video file media to iPod video/iPod movie, such as DVD, vob, DivX, XviD, MOV, rm, rmvb, MPEG, WMV, AVI to iPod video (MP4 format).

I have it too and that's not what I use it for. I just purchased PQ DVD iPod video suite (I was debated between that one an Cucosoft) and it allows you to take a DVD and convert it directly into an mpeg4 file. I opted for this one over Cucosoft because it's faster and it was the same price. Both programs are either $30 for the DVD to iPod software or $40 for both the DVD to iPod software and all other video to iPod software. I also was having some trouble getting the Cucosoft program to read all of my DVDs, but PQ DVD iPod Video Suite has worked really well for me. It takes less than real time to convert, whereas all the other programs I looked at took real time or more. Definitely worth the $40, considering the other option is to deal with sketchy freeware or to re-purchase DVDs you already own on iTunes.|`|m7GyiWCDaa	Yes, try TubeHunter which can rip DVD video or audio off to iPOD MP4.
