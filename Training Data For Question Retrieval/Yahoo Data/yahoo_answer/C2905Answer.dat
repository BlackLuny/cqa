DDT has shown to cause reproductive defects, so the closer you get to the top of the chain, the more doomed you are as a species.

So, it's a bit worse than you may understand.  I assume you're still in school and you're obviously bright enough to catch it, seeing as how you're up on your agricultural degradation statistics (Where are you, Iowa State?), so why don't you look into a class called General Science 090.  I believe you would benefit from it.|`|1729dba7da8cec3071bb2a3f1a7ebb0baa	In 1962, Rachel Carson's book Silent Spring was published. The book argued that pesticides, especially DDT and PCB, were poisoning both wildlife and the environment and also endangering human health. Public reaction to Silent Spring launched the modern environmental movement in the United States, and DDT became a prime target of the growing anti-chemical and anti-pesticide movements during the 1960s. In fact, Carson devoted a page of the book to thoughtful consideration of the relationship between DDT and malarial mosquitoes, but with cognizance of the development of resistance in the mosquito, concluding:<br>  It is more sensible in some cases to take a small amount of damage in preference to having none for a time but paying for it in the long run by losing the very means of fighting is the advice given in Holland by Dr Briejer in his capacity as director of the Plant Protection Service]. Practical advice should be "Spray as little as you possibly can" rather than "Spray to the limit of your capacity." <br>  However, Carson also made the controversial claim that DDT caused cancer in humans, a belief which is still widely held by the public. Charles Wurster, the chief scientist for the Environmental Defense Fund, was quoted in the Seattle Times of 5 October 1969, as saying: "If the environmentalists win on DDT, they will achieve a level of authority they have never had before. In a sense, much more is at stake than DDT." However, as pesticide research was still immature when it was written, many of the claims made in Silent Spring were ultimately found to be scientifically inaccurate.<br>  During the late 1960s, pressure grew within the United States to effect a ban on DDT. In January 1971, the U.S. District Court of Appeals ordered William Ruckelshaus, the EPA's first Administrator, to begin the de-registration procedure for DDT. Initially, after a six-month review process, Ruckelshaus rejected an outright ban, citing studies from the EPA's internal staff stating that DDT was not an imminent danger to human health and wildlife. However, the findings of these staff members were criticized, as they were performed mostly by economic entomologists inherited from the United States Department of Agriculture, whom many environmentalists felt were biased towards agribusiness and tended to minimize concerns about human health and wildlife. The decision not to ban thus created public controversy.<br>  The EPA held seven months of hearings in 1971-1972, with scientists giving evidence both for and against the use of DDT. In the summer of 1972, Ruckelshaus announced a ban on virtually all uses of DDT in the U.S., where it was classified as an EPA Toxicity Class II substance.<br>  The 1970s ban in the U.S. took place amid a climate of public mistrust of the scientific and industrial community, following such fiascoes as Agent Orange and use of the hormone diethylstilbestrol (DES). In addition, the placement of the bald eagle on the endangered species list was also a strong factor leading to its being banned in the United States. The overuse of DDT was claimed to be a major factor in the bald eagle population decline - a claim that has fallen into dispute. <br>  The ban has subsequently been vigorously criticized by pro-DDT advocates, including Steven Milloy, Roger Bate and Richard Tren, whose critiques draw on the work of entomologist J. Gordon Edwards, a witness at the hearings who stated that there was no evidence to substantiate the claims that DDT posed a threat to human health. They report that, at the end of the hearings, hearing examiner Edmund Sweeney ruled that the scientific evidence provided no basis for banning DDT. In the summer of 1972, Ruckelshaus reviewed evidence collected during the agency's hearings as well as reports prepared by two DDT study groups (the Hilton and Mark Commissions) that had come to the opposite conclusion. Milloy and Edwards claimed that Ruckelshaus did not actually attend any of the EPA commission's hearings, and (citing unnamed aides) that he did not read any transcripts of the hearings. Ruckelshaus overturned Sweeney's ruling, arguing that the pesticide was "a warning that man may be exposing himself to a substance that may ultimately have a serious effect on his health."<br>  <br>  One popular controversy involves claims that restrictions on the use of DDT in vector control, imposed by various national governments, donor countries and international aid agencies, in response to pressure from environmentalists, has resulted in millions of unnecessary deaths. Claims of this kind commonly include reference to a ban on DDT (although it is still in use in malaria control) and refer specifically to the 1972 US ban, with the implication that this constituted a worldwide ban, and to Rachel Carson's Silent Spring. This international ban is supposed to have resulted in hundreds of thousands of deaths according to Nicholas Kristof. Popular author Michael Crichton states in his novel State of Fear:<br>  Since the supposed ban, two million people a year have died unnecessarily from malaria, mostly children. The ban has caused more than fifty million needless deaths. Banning DDT killed more people than Hitler. <br>  One of the claims is that the ban shows a lack of compassion for sufferers in the Third World: treatments were used long enough to eliminate insect-borne diseases in the West, but now that it is only needed in poorer nations in Africa, Asia and elsewhere, it has been banned. Paul Driessen, author of Eco-Imperialism: Green Power, Black Death, argues that the epidemic of malaria in Africa not only takes the lives of 2 million people a year, but leaves those who survive malaria unable to contribute to the economy while sick and more vulnerable to subsequent diseases that might kill them. Many African resources are tied up with the sick or expended in caring for them, leaving the world's poorest countries even poorer.<br>  However, DDT has never been banned for use against Malaria in the tropics. In many developing countries, spraying programmes (especially using DDT) were stopped due to concerns over safety and environmental effects, as well as constraint and incompetence (or corruption) in administrative, managerial and financial implementation. Such limited use of DDT has not become ineffective due to resistance in areas where it is used inside homes. <br>  On the other hand, environmental groups have been strongly criticized for trying to ban all use of DDT. Many environmentalist groups fought against the public health exception of DDT in the 2001 Stockholm Convention, against the objections of third world governments and many malaria researchers. "Greenpeace, World Wildlife Fund, Physicians for Social Responsibility and over 300 other environmental organizations advocated for a total DDT ban, starting as early as 2007 in some cases." An article in Nature Medicine at this time strongly objected to what would have been a de facto ban and stated: "Environmentalists in rich, developed countries gain nothing from DDT, and thus small risks felt at home loom larger than health benefits for the poor tropics. More than 200 environmental groups, including Greenpeace, Physicians for Social Responsibility and the World Wildlife Fund, actively condemn DDT for being "a current source of significant injury to...humans."|`|f2b6d8aa39507900c3d4c0785edd85bbaa	it stays and stays and stays! always it stays around....<br>  <br>  tends to kill everything....|`|nqmEyEE3aa	what in the hell are you talking about

One reason would be the land use.  If the area is meant for agriculture and it is critical for the food supply in the country, then it is best not to put a building in the area, since putting a building would also mean building roads to access the area, thus disturbing more of the land and more of the crops needed for the food supply.<br>  <br>  You can disagree on building any infrastructure on the land if the land is a habitat of endangered animal species.

Roof top wind mills only work during stormy days. You will get very little power from a roof top windmill as some eBay scams will have you belive for $3k.|`|L8zmQS8Jaa	Using wind power to charge the batteries of a vehicle has been done.  There is a gentleman in England who converted a van to electric power.  Then he added some solar cells.  Apparently not happy with the charging potential while the van was just sitting he added a wind turbine.  The site is below and it makes for interesting reading.1<br>  <br>  To use the wind to power a vehicle has also been done.  They are called land sailers among other names, but they don't seem tame enough for the land canals also known as roads.|`|0KmJwYunaa	And how big is this turbine?   A typical modern car has 140 HP which equates to 186 KW, a typical "small" wind turbine with a blade diameter of about 24 feet produces maybe 10 KW when the wind is blowing just right, do you really think you can mount 20 of these turbines on a car?   If you have just one and depend on batteries to store up the charge, you'll probably have to wait a few days before you could drive for an hour.|`|uFQFRdczaa	Of course we can.  Build a wind turbine, and plug your electric car into it.  You might even generate more electricity than the car uses.<br>  <br>  It won't work for everyone, because not everyone has the space to build a wind turbine, nor lives in a place where it's appropriate to build one.  And some of us haven't got the money.|`|FR0manFQaa	if you are talking about attaching a wind turbine on top of a car it would create to much drag but you could hook up a wind turbine to your house and recharge it using the wind turbines energy|`|H4dswqRlaa	Yes! Can one depend on the wind? No!|`|AA10796679	i have had the CONCEPT in my head for over 60 years and now someone else has it also. i cannot understand why we don't already do it. it is very simple and perhaps that is the reason. i could have one built but don't have the resources and the big auto makers won't do it because they are in cahoots with the oil companies. i have diagram ed the whole thing but refuse to give it away for free.
HQ4PsETWaa	Global Warming is real, but you should not feel guilty.  It is a natural cycle of the earth, it is not man made.  Did you know that less than 5% of all greenhouse gasses are in any way caused by humans?  Did you know the time when Carbon Dioxide levels were the highest it was an ice age?  Did you know water retains much more heat than carbon dioxide?  Did you know humans have developed during the longest steady temperature period in earths history?    What you should feel guilty about is electing politicians that want to spend money stopping something they have no control over instead of finding ways to adapt to it.  We must adapt to our planet, it will not adapt to us.|`|7N8W2FDyaa	Why should you feel guilty?|`|AA11550519	How about the pic of a cute, cuddly polar bear drowning?Oh wait, a picture is a thousand words. I tried!|`|RjUWPz5daa	How can you feel guilty for something that doesn't exist?    It's like believing in Santa Claus and the Tooth Fairy.|`|uFQFRdczaa	From your tone I'm not going to convince you that CO2 emissions cause global climate change, but hear me out, ok?  CO2 levels are the highest they've been since there were dinosaurs.  Burning fossil fuels release CO2, millions of tons every day.  If the majority of scientists are right, that increased level of CO2 will cause the earth to grow warmer, by several degrees.      Releasing CO2 costs money, because coal costs money, oil costs money, gas costs money.  When other people waste gas in their inefficient cars, that's more demand so the price goes up for you and them both.  It costs money.  Bad insulation on your house means you run the heater more in winter, the AC more in summer, that costs money.  Wasting energy is not practical, it's not cost-effective.  Making new steel and aluminum requires more coal than recycling, and those costs get passed along to you.  It costs you money.    Living a low-carbon lifestyle is cheaper, if you're wasting energy you're wasting money.  Maybe you can feel guilty about that.|`|U6rCN4R8aa	it doesnt exist.|`|ySC3d6BVaa	Hodg Podg is right, thousands of scientist will tell you that global warming is not man made.|`|ngExeZjuaa	If man-made CO2 is causing global warming,  you should be ashamed EVERY TIME YOU EXHALE.  You should never:   exercise/breath deep  ... increases CO2 expelled   drink any carbonated beverage  ... No Soda, Beer, ...   & definitely never buy or use dry ice.|`|w5oQJpDwaa	You can't feel guilty.Global warming is cause by man. Its a made up fear to generate millions of your tax dollars on research and to fill the pockects ( with $$$) of those promoting this lie.Its a practical way to a hugh cash cow.|`|vfubWXFMaa	I can not do that because having seen where the warmers altered the data and how they did it I am waiting to participate in the tar and feathers party when it starts in 30 months. i will be providing the rough cut fence rail to ride them through town on after the tar hardens up.|`|KfCJDp0Laa	we dont want you to feel guilty, we want you to see the sense of reducing energy waste, replacing diminishing fossil fuel with renewable energy, supporting local industry and agriculture, and not falling for the 'stuff will make you happy' line of the consumer culture.  be happy! go play in the snow!|`|1YcKHGLqaa	As a geo minor, I studied climate change for over a year. The snowfall is because the jetstream is changing where it is, and because there is more water in the atmosphere.    If you are concerned about price and practicality -- have you ever seen The Day After Tomorrow? The ice sheet that keeps breaking off of Greenland that is in the news every few weeks? The current that shut off in the movie, should about 50% more of that sheet fall in, will shut off, sending all of Europe, part of Africa, and most of Asia into a terminal and brutal winter. Big deal for Americans? Yes. One, think about all those refugees? And what about food? Suddenly one half of the world will be unable to grow food. Talk about food prices shooting up.    We are also, thanks to global warming, facing a water shortage. This means that, within the next 25 years, your water bill is going to go up dramatically, as will the price of, well, everything.
