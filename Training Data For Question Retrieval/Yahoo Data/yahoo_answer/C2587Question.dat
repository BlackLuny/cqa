20090304114815AA6ZTCd	Cars & Transportation;Rail	Train ticket price malarkey...  (Scottish)?	Ok, the first time I typed this, it was ridiculously long, so I'll try & give y'all the low-down...      I'm visiting a friend of mine in Aberdeen, with another friend who gets his train journeys for free (since his father works for SPT) so he's agreed to pay for half of my ticket prices, however we would still like the cheapest option...      I have a zonecard that will get me as far as Glasgow Central, though I need a ticket from Queen St to Aberdeen - and one for the next day on the way back.  However, we've looked about & the prices have all been ridiculous.  The website asked for ￡67 for a single.  That's insane.  I got a return to Dundee for ￡12 (and that was from my hometown, not Glasgow!)      I'm now thinking of using the ticket machines in Central - though I don't know how much this will cost - or whether my 16-25 railcard can be used.        If anyone can help me here, it would be much appreciated.

20090304122114AAQ4kGb	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Mazda	Wil my 2001 Mazda Tribute blow up driving from PA to FL this summer?	I have a 2001 Mazda Tribute with about 66000 miles on it.  It is in good shape is fully function.  I do have a warranty on it until 2010.      I was planning a trip to florida with the 2 kids (12 and 14).  There are a couple of places that I would like to stop like the Biltmore Estate in NC.      I am just a little nervous about driving an 8 year old car that far.      I could book a flight to FL for about $450 + FEES and then rent a car for another 300-400, but I like roadtrips.      It is about an 18 hour/ 1000 mile drive from where I am at (mostly on I-95).      I did drive it to Chicago (12.5 hour 750 mile) last year and back without problems.      It gets good gas mileage too at 27mpg (for an SUV).

I need to be able to adjust the tire size and I can''''t pay more than $350, so that takes the smarty **or** edge out of the picture (for now!). All I have on the truck now is a AFE intake and I removed the muffler. No guages, but I will get them in soon.      So, which would you recommend? Ive heard bad things and good things about both. Im not looking for extreme power yet.. probably stay in the towing mode until I can do some work on the tranny. Which is more reliable and will cause less problems?      Oh and its going on a 07 Ram 3500 w/ 5.9l Cummins      Thanks      Sam

20090304102435AAiN8SD	Cars & Transportation;Other - Cars & Transportation	2002 dodge neon question.....Please help?	I have a 2002 dodge neon. Runs and drives great. The only problem is that the check engine light was on.       I took it to the dodge dealership to get the check engine light checked out. They said it was probably within the wiring according to the codes.       They called me and said they fixed a couple of loose wires or bad wires and took it for a test drive. During the test drive the check engine light went off. However they said the car stalled on them and now it won't run. They said the whole wiring harness played out. They also said the fuel pump played out. Then started making comments on how old the car is and how many miles it has. And they also said the check engine light came back on and because the wiring harness is fried it won't clear the codes.      I personally think they hooked 2 wires together wrong and fried the wiring harness along with the fuel pump. That just makes more sense to me than it just all of a sudden playing out.      What do you think? They are now trying to charge me almost 3000.00 and I need some suggestions.

But this car was from the factory and should have come in perfect condition but needs to be taken aprt to realign the panels around the headlight. What rights do i have ???

I have a 96 Roadmaster (a car with little use any more) it has a 160,000 on that Vette LT1 350 and still drives like new. But since I don't really need the car that much I wanted to start building up her power. Currently everything on her is stock (260hp 330lbft torque). I have spoken with a number of different individuals with racing ties (a local small time racing company owner that races Miata's and Karts, as well as a couple of retired dragsters). This will be my FIRST project and was looking to get the most advice I could. What I'm looking for is BIG HP. and even BIGGER TORQUE. I want her to stay street legal but I would like to push the limits. I don't know if I want to go big or small block. Turbo or super charger (leaning towards the latter). Which rear end will give the optimal push and acceleration. etc....I also want as much of money to go to American companies that hire an American workforce like Edelbrock and Russell. Thank you ahead of time.

My car idles really low, probably between 100-300 rpms, so low that sometimes it dies, until the engine warms up...It does this regardless of whether its hot or cold outside...Once it warms up, it idles perfectly at about 900 rpms...Once it has warmed up, you can shut it off and start it back up, and it will idle great still...What could be causing this? Please help with some ideas of where I can start, besides for bringing it to a shop.     thanks

20090304101739AAdVdLW	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Chevy Tracker with fluctuating rpm's?	Hi, I have a 1998 4wd-4dr 4cyl Tracker- purchased it new- it has about 97,500 on it now- NEVER had a problem-all I ever repalced was a $10.00 temp A/c switch in 2007-tires of course- fan belts-plugs & wires. I started her up the other morn (22degrees out) and it warmed up as ususal, I noticed that the rpm's were dropping a bit below the on dash guage-looks about to below 900 and the engine would stutter and then the rpms  would pick up by itself to the normal just below the "1" - when i put it in Drive-rpm's dropped- by stepping on gas they came back up- she's been faithful to me- so not to breakdown on the street- i took my other car- Started Tracker up the next day -same thing but not as bad- I have't cked anything in detail yet -it's been too cold here with snow storm -but a quick look under the hood- things looked ok- I suspect maybe some type of sensor or module- or maybe it's time to  overall routine maintenance? No new gas-Gas is at 1/2 a tank at regularly used station i'v been using all week- It's ALWAYS run smooth-It's my daily driver- appreciate suggestion-I do have a Haynes manual- Thanks a bunch"

20090304144751AArrZDR	Cars & Transportation;Buying & Selling	Car broke down, still owe money, repair is the same as we owe?	I have a Chevy Express 12 passenger van. We took out a 7 year loan because we have to have the size (big family) and it was the best deal we could afford, given our income, credit, etc. Now the engine needs replacing at a whopping cost of $7000! We just hit 103,000 miles and it is about 5 years old. That's a ridiculous repair cost and is about the same as we owe on the van still. We know that it will not be much different no matter where we go. If my husband were to do the repair, the engine will still cost a lot of money and he does not have the time. Vans are also difficult to work on because of the space where the engine sits...it's confined.      I am not sure what the best solution is to this problem. We know that the loan was not the best, but could not work out anything else. We need a large vehicle for my family.       Without telling us about the mistakes we made in our loan, etc., please tell us what we could or should do in this situation. We are strapped as it is, have a family of 7, and need a running vehicle that fits everyone.

YOU DON'T HAVE TO READ WHOLE THING you can just go to bottom and tell me what i should do but nothing stupid like blowing up the place or something. i feel like i have been done wrong and that they are just trying to get some extra money because they are probobly going bankrupt and need some quick money so that they dont go out of business but i dont know its a crystler jeep dodge company               ok well i took my car up to dallas dodge (running great) for an oil change and transmission fluid change, and to check why the engine light is on and see what is wrong with brakes.      ok so they had the car for a week   we call and they say that we need a brand new engine harness, new fuel pump, new wiring, and our car wont start      the thing is when we gave the car to them it ran perfectly just the engine light was on.   now i really think that they broke all that stuff trying to find the engine problem.         At first they said that it was a wiring problem they fix that and then the whole car breaks down?????? doesn't make sense   then they were fixing that and they say that the car needs a new engine harness from a wreck (there is a small dent near the front wheel where they said the engine harness is) but even if it is right there a very very very very small dent wont shatter a engine harness so i think that they broke it. and the fuel pump, they say that it wont work anymore that there is no gas going to the engine. the thing is we drove it for a long time and nothing ever went wrong.  they were gonna charge about 4000 to get all that stuff fixed      So now they are saying that they put it all together and we got into an argument. and they fixed some dead wires cause they thought that they were the problem with the engine light, they said it will cost about six hundred so they went ahead and fixed it without our ok on it. then the whole breaking down talked about above started happening.      today they called me back and said that the car is all put back together the total is 289.57 and that our gas gauge is broken it says we have half a tank of gas but the gas tank is empty.  also we had to bang on the gas tank to get the car started.      Now tell me how does it go from 600 after they fix the wiring to 289.57 after they are completely done something is not right         I feel like i have been done wrong and i dont know what i should do any help?   i will take all comments to consideration

So i took the vehicle to the dealers and they sent me to the body shop and they told me that the vehicles bumper needs to be taken apart and the headlamps would need to be realigned. What rights do i have ? as this car was brand new from the factory! and should not have any of the problems. Am i able to give the car back to the dealers and request a brand new vehicle from the factory ??? or do i have to go with free body shop repairs provided by mercedes ? i am really gutted as i dont want a brand new car to be taken apart. where do i stand ? They said under the sales of goods act they have the right to rectify any problems. But this car was from the factory and should have come in perfect condition but needs to be taken aprt to realign the panels around the headlight. What rights do i have ???

We have a bobcat skid steer loader on the farm that was built in the mid 70's. Works pretty good for its age and we don't push it hard but it has it's share of leaks mostly at the seals. We were told by a mechanic that works on them that if you didn't have any hydraulic oil on hand you could put W30 motor oil in the reservior to bring it back up to proper level. Thats been a couple of years ago and now motor oil of any viscosity is being put into it. Will this damage any of the system; seals ,pump,valves etc.? The whole system will take about 13 gals. and I'm concerned that when I change the filter and top off with oil its just going to be a waste of oil and filter unless the whole system is flushed out.

20090227080855AAI9Aql	Cars & Transportation;Safety	If you speed, why don't you run stop signs also?	For those of you out there who drive well over the posted speed limit (this means almost everyone out there), why are you willing to so blatently break a traffic law such as the speed limit?  If you are going to blatently and obviously break a speed limit, why don't you just run stop signs while you're at it?  What's the difference?  Both can lead to an increase in the chance of an accident, and both are summary offenses, which means the fines if you get caught are about the same in dollars.  Aren't you the least bit concerned about possibly getting nailed for a big fine, only to save a few minutes of time?  I'm not trying to make anyone mad here, and I'm not saying I'm right or you're wrong, so everyone just try to keep your cool and answer this question in a civil way if you choose to.

20090304145439AA7pGxM	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Audi	What do cars like the RS4 and RS6 compete against?	Car magazines and shows always compare the S4 or S6 to the German rivals of the M3/M5 and the C and E AMG respectively. Does this mean that the RS4 and RS6 are in a league of their own? I do know that when the latest version of the RS cars comes out, there is always huge hype and attention paid to the massive amounts of torque and horsepower, numbers that the BMW and Merc models can't touch. As for the latest A4 models however, I wonder if the S4 should be more compared to the 335xi for example than putting the V6 A4 up against it, since the two lower engine choices now differ little off the line.       What do you guys think? I know Quattro Gmbh produces these RS models as uncompromising performance vehicles, so shouldn't that be matched to BMW's M series and Merc's AMG series, and not the Audi S models??

20090304151530AAJghGm	Cars & Transportation;Insurance & Registration	Is my insurance going to suffer because of this and am I really not at fault?	This morning I was driving north on a busy street when the light turned yellow when I was about 24 feet from the intersection. The speed limit was 40 and I was going 40-45 mph. I decided that it was safer to go through the intersection than slam on my breaks. As I was going through the light a car turning left cut right in front of me, thinking I was either stopping or they could make it, either way I slammed on my breaks and still hit them on the back end of the passanger side. The light had not turned red until after the impact and as I was going through the intersection it was still yellow. My car is okay, the bumper just needs to be replaced but their car was a lot worse. There was  witness that stopped who told the cop who then told me he said I had a green light and I tried to break but they pulled in front of me. I didn't lie and told the officers it had turned yellow. They said something about maybe citing the other driver but seemed like they were debating the fault.They said I had to wait until the report came out to find out who was at fault? Am I liable for anything considering the police officer told me the witness said it wasn't my fault and I had the right of way? Even though I told them the light was yellow?! I am sorry I can't lie and say it was green when it turned yellow?!

I have a 2002 Chevy Blazer that has been nothing but problems since I first got it in 2004.       Within the last month I had brakes put on the car- all 4 new sets. For about a week now the car has been making a thumping noise coming from the front driver's side tire. The ABS light will come on and then go off- the brakes seem to be working fine, but I don't know what the problem could be. Last night I went to turn and hit the brakes slightly and the car wanted to pull to the right and the ABS light came on, but once I parked it and started it again- the light went back off?  I am going to take it to the shop this weekend, because I am thinking it might not be too safe to drive. I just wanted to know if anyone had an ideas what it could be- and around how much it may cost me. With the economy like this I don't know how hard working people are supposed to get back on their feet when they have been knocked down! Any suggestions and opinions are greatly appreciated!

They proceeded straight through the intersection, so, having the right of way, I proceeded through the stop sign. when I was nearly halkway through the intersection, I noticed that a truck had ran the stop sign and I tried to avoid a collision so I yanked my steering wheel hard to the left but he t boned me. he hit me so hard that my car actually ended up on the opposite side of the road in a parking lot. the whole passenger side of my car was completely caved in. the windows busted out and the doors so caved in that you couldnt even open them. he told the officers that i ran the stop sign and hit him. the police said that since they werent there, they cant tell whose fault it is. the insurance company is saying that they dont have enough evidence from the police report to determine whose fault it is either. what do I do? wouldnt it be obvious who ran the stop sign and who was responsible by looking at the damage to my car? any advice would be helpful

My question is: the car runs fine for about 15 minutes or miles, but once it warms up, the car won't go past 3000 rpms. Could it be off a tooth on timing belt and still run fine, but after it gets warm act up? If I unplug the sensor it won't start at all.      Car was fine before timing belt service, now mechanic says that if I need to replace sensor I have to pay for labor. I don't mind paying for part, but I feel labor twice is bs.

20090304153032AAltYJ9	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Acura	What happens if you put 10 dollars of diesel into a 2005 Acura RSX that had about 10 bucks of gas in it?	I accidentally put 10 bucks of diesel into my 2005 Acura RSX. It had about 10 bucks of gas left in it. I drove it to the dealer which was about 800 yards away. They drained it and filled with with Gasoline. The mechanic told me I didn't need to do anything else and that it would be fine. I am wondering if you guys know if this would destroy my engine in any way? He said that the little bit of driving I did to the dealer just used the gas that was left in my line. I just hope my car is going to be alright. What do you guys think about this?

20090304153853AAZoVP5	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Volkswagen	What is wrong with my 94 Jetta transmission?	I have a 94 Jetta, and 1st 3rd and 5th gear work fine. The only problem is that every time I go to shift into 2nd or 4th, it grinds and won't go into gear. My car is essentially a 3 speed. I think it might be something with the clutch or the clutch linkage because it grabs really late (I almost have the clutch pedal completely released and then it finally grabs). One thing I noticed is that when I put it into 1st, 3rd, or 5th, there is a little bit of play the the shifter, but when I try to get it into 2nd or 4th, then it's like it hits a brick wall, it won't go any farther and it seems like if I had another 1/4 of an inch, then it would go in fine. I'm just hoping that 2nd and 4th aren't ground down to nothing and I have to replace those gears or the entire transmission. Let me know what you think.

20090304153426AA1kten	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	1995 Chevy Lumina overheated and quit on me?	I was driving down the highway with no problems, and looked at my thermostat and noticed it was getting a bit hit and the "Hot!" light came on. I turned the vent to max heat to try and draw heat from the engine to cool it down. Ended up taking the very next exit because I heard what may have been a slight, but not loud ticking or rattling noise and got louder when I tried to accelerate, so naturally, I ceased to accelerate and tried to coast on the exit ramp to a gas station...didn't make it but to the top of the hill by the overpass.   My question is:   What would be a cause to this?   A truck driver I spoke to said it could be a water pump...which is very plausible as my coolant recovery tank is not just coolant, it's kind of sludgy in texture and consistency, and there's a brownish hue to it (rust I assume). There has been a coolant leak on the car for not real long, but lately it hasn't been a problem at all. I opened the hood carefully to make sure any steam or anything wouldn't get in my eyes or burn me otherwise. And low and behold there was coolant leaking and steaming. It doesn't look like it got on much anything real important. It missed some wiring thankfully, but now my car will not start. It tries to turn over and almost starts but the second I stop turning the key it just dies.   What are some possible causes to these unfortunate events?   Also, if possible, would there be a quote involved so I know roughly   how much it will take to fix?      A little more background about the car.   1995 Chevy Lumina LS   ~120,000mi (Almost all highway miles though)   Automatic      And I forgot to mention, the thermostat is definitely messed up because shortly before I pulled over, after I noticed the car was overheating, the thermostat jumped from around 200 down to about 110, and did that a couple times before it remained around 110.   Answers would be greatly appreciated! I really need to fix my car as I depend on it for work and getting around town.
20090304153946AAJ0wp1	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Mazda	04 Mazda 3s, Sounds like a scam to me.. what do you guys think?	This guy said he was going to sell me his 04 Mazda 3s for $4000, and I asked "why so cheap" (BY THE WAY, I LIVE IN ILLINOIS), he said       I am very glad that you interested in buying my car( 2004 Mazda Mazda3 S ).I am selling this car because my platoon has been sent back to Iraq and don't want it get old in my backyard. The price is low because I need to sell it before March 12.It has no damage, no scratches or dents, no hidden defects. It is in immaculate condition, meticulously maintained and hasn't been involved in any accident..I do have the title, clear, under my name. It is still available for sale if interested, price as stated in the ad $4000. The car is in Marietta GA, in case it gets sold I will take care of shipping.Let me know, if you are interested, email back.   Here is the information.       Mileage:  61,000      VIN: JM1BK123641133104       Sincerly,    Lt. James Atkinson       That is when I replied, "How much for shipping" (at this point im convinced its a scam).      He replied...   The price for the car is $4,000 with shipping included.   I will have the car shipped from Marietta, GA by an US Air Force cargo plane so there won't be any additional shipping costs. Also I will arrange for a truck to transport the car to your home address or, if you like, you can pick it up from the nearest airport in your area. The shipping will take 1-2 days, depending on your location.Shipping will be door to door,to your home address,somebody must be home when the car arrives to sign for the reception.The car will arrive with all the papers and documents required for registration and the keys. The clear title and the bill of sale will be already signed by me.   The payment will be done through eBay.You will send the money to eBay and as soon as the payment is confirmed they will notify me to proceed with the shipping. I will ship the car, you will receive it and you will have 7 days for inspection, both the car and the paperwork and the option to accept or reject the car.The inspection time period will begin as soon as you sign for receiving the car at your requested address.During all this time eBay will hold the money into a trust account.So, this is not a blind transaction,you can see the car before decided to buy it.If you are satisfied with the car and decide to keep it you inform eBay about this and they will release the money to me. If the car is not as advertised and decide not to keep it eBay will refund you the money, no questions asked, and shipping back the car will be my concern. I think this is more than fair for the both of us.Please take in to consideration that I will get paid only after you receive the car and make sure everything is as agreed.    If you agree with these terms and you have the money, send me your full name and the address where you want the car to be delivered to and I will initiate the transaction with eBay. You will receive all the transaction details from them.       I will appreciate an answer as soon as possible.      Sincerly,   Lt. James
