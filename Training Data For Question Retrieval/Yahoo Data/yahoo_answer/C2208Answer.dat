There is also downloadable content for 360, so that's another plus.|`|haN9IMbCaa	street fighter 4|`|t96dxzkeaa	some good games that you could try out are Assassin's Creed, Fable 2, soul calibur 4, and Mirror's Edge, all of them being some of the most popular games of last year.

UtBb83Aeaa	You'll need to answer some questions yourself before you can have an answer, I'm afraid! First, what kind of locomotive are you looking to build? Steam or diesel? Road engine or switcher? Narrow gauge or standard gauge?<br>  <br>  There are many, many different types and sizes of locomotives, and your choice will dictate where to begin and what materials and supplies you'll need to build it. You say you have access to a machine shop. What level of machining skills do you have? Would you be able to turn your own wheels, for example, or would you buy commercial wheels?<br>  <br>  Do you intend to power and run the loco, or just put it on display? If you're going to run it, will you power it with a DC motor, or do you want to pursue DCC? Or perhaps even live steam?<br>  <br>  I've included some links to information you may find worthwhile.
mDEddvqlaa	I believe there is a way to do it with cheats (Possibly "boolprop TestingCheatsEnabled true" and then Shift+Click on your sim), but the by-the-book way is to go downtown, and find a vampire. Get your relationship high with the vampire, and eventually they'll bite you (if you Shift+Click them, you can also select them and simply drag your relationship up, then make the vampire bite you.)<br>  Vampires have grey skin and their names always begin with "Count" or "Countess". They also wear traditional dresses, capes, or suits.<br>  If you just want your Sim to LOOK like a vampire, if you do boolprop in CAS and hold Shift+M, you can also unlock the skins and clothes.|`|r4pMA6oFaa	Have them get bit by a vampire.<br>  How do you even talk to the grim reaper? Lol.|`|SJx9IWWtaa	To become a vampire you have to make friends with a vampire.  (U can usually find them in downtown)  Eventually they will bite u and you will become one.  <br>  <br>  As for aliens, if you have to make new ones...or get a program like SimPE to change the files.|`|f872a7e49ec096abf5ee9af70c9d718faa	make best friends with a vampire/and yeah how do you even talk to the reaper? just stay out of the sun light!|`|STr40rGlaa	you are supposed to go to a restaurant at night... and there is a vampire there... u talk to them until they become your friend and then they will ask to bite u

bZcHoo8caa	if you don't already have a hard drive, i would highly recommend you get one. if you play more than 5 or 6 games with save data, or on xbox live, you will need one. i would not recommend the 120 though, it's expensive and is a waste unless you really think you need the space.

12048d8f757f7c0f475740cda5351342aa	According to the official site for the game, <a href="http://www.50bloodonthesand.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.50bloodonthesand.com</a> , it will only be available for XBox360 and Playstation 3.|`|raEUval8aa	No. It isn't coming out on the Wii.|`|qUDas0R4aa	why would you want to know, those 50 cent games suck and yes i mean the rapper who cant rhyme for sh*t|`|UnaNLSSQaa	No, and if it would, you would buy $49.99 worth of hell.|`|7lYxPRiQaa	no and the game it stupid
YiUQacWRaa	Well more people would be better also Ouija boards have been known to have bad mojo but dont worry nothings gonna happen its a board game its like saying if a monopoly game piece moves to the railroad ill get hit by a train|`|AA11375099	The board opens a door to another reality.  It is one that is inhabited by beings that are stuck in certain vibrational levels, usually the lower ones.  <br>  <br>  It is the Astral World.  <br>  <br>  It exists and we usually travel there when we go to sleep and dream.  Entities are drawn to this game board and can communicate to us.  <br>  <br>  Part of it could be your subconscious mind, being connected to your "Higher Self".  But you don't need a board game for that.  <br>  <br>  If you believe that something contacted you then you are probably right.  There are some mysterious things going on, some cannot be explained.<br>  <br>  My co-worker's children are being harassed by spirits and so far nothing they have done has gotten rid of it or them.  It is kind of scary, but if you pray you could close the door and God's love will protect you.<br>  <br>  It could be nothing, or everything.  <br>  <br>  But they do exist in the Astral World.
e0Dj4Lejaa	Nope. Trust me, you would know just by going to torrent sites. There is no PS3 category and there might never be.
l50seR0haa	rainbow six
w3SLNKyKaa	Okay theres quite a few changes to the game. The fighting technique is more acrobatic, he has sooooo many more moves. The game itself is a more darker version of the first one, the prince is older, wiser and more deadly than before. Gore and death are a big factor in this game. Its not overly gory but its just perfect. I suggest you buy warrior within aswell as the two thrones because once you finish warrior within you'll be hooked as i was lol
VxuMyTo3aa	You are incorrect in saying that Wrath targets all creatures. Unless a spell specifically says the word "target" in it's text, it doesn't target anything.<br>  <br>  Since Wrath of God doesn't target, shroud (in any of it's forms) has no effect here. They die.|`|JRiWK0jSaa	in magic anything is possible, but there are limitations and maybe a creature with shroud is one of them|`|CEchFOhqaa	Yes because shroud only stops it from targeting that creature. Wrath targets all creatures so it is destroyed too. You could target it with anything that says "Target..." but something like wrath or damnation kills it. Also something like Diabolic Edict could kill it because that targets the player not the creature.
CO7QiZbyaa	Erm, first of all I didn't even know there were cheats. <br>  <br>  An easy way to figure this out is make a new account with no trophies, and do the cheats and aim for the easiest trophy like complete Chapter 1. Then if you fail on getting the trophy then that's the answer. And same if you do get the trophy.|`|uqFr1Xwjaa	No its still the same

eceb3733dac41acb2209ee932703be3eaa	I used a Torque Bow to shoot RAMM when he had the Kryll flying around him and blew them off with the arrows exploding. Following with a grenade to stun him and then shooting him with my main assault rifle in the head until the Kryll comes back. I kept this up about three or four times before he fell. He never once got close to me and I beat him before he got halfway down the train. I also heard that if you have the magnum, it only takes 4 shots to his head to kill him. I haven't tried this yet, but plan on doing so next time.|`|ahELDbTWaa	There are two main things to focus on while fighting RAAM.<br>  <br>  1 - Only shoot at him when his Kryll shield flies away from him (usually towards you). So you need to...<br>  <br>  2 - Stay in the lighted areas of the board. Once you step into the dark areas the Kryll will tear you to pieces.<br>  <br>  other than that it's like the rest of the game, keep moving and find cover.

Most of these coins sound like ones that you could spend, but if I had more information I could tell you for sure. For example, mintmarks can make a difference between a $10 coin and  $100 coin. If you want someone to give you an opinion in person, I recommend finding a "coin dealer" or "numismatist".

I found one called "Broderbund Home Designer" or something on the sale rack for $10.<br>  <br>  If you want to just play around with it, the above is best. But if you want to actually design a house to live in eventually, I would just use AutoCAD.|`|AA11985792	There is software available for this, but it's not free.|`|88c5af3f5c7fb019669ffac934f1a7a2aa	i don't know tell me if you find out but you can buy a sims game and build a virtual house hell you can go to www.thesimsonilne.com and get a free trail thing i was just there|`|7e5f69d3889e55504e05cec82a4eafabaa	Yeah, theres this site where you can pick a house layout, color patterns, etc.  On the following linke, there is a list of house-building sites.  <br>  <br>  Also, if you get bored with that, then you can dress up celebs, girls, boys, terrorist, haha, and etc.<br>  <br>  A great site dedicated to suffice your decorative passion (crappy, I know, haha, I made that up, but true)<br>  <br>  Heres the site:<br>  <a href="http://dressupgames.com/rooms.html" rel="nofollow">http://dressupgames.com/rooms.html</a>|`|AA11171515	why on earth would u want 2 build a house i mean come on just what is up with that i know there is a program u can buy but what am i sayign this is wierd just go buy a REAL house peace out|`|cb9658e81880abdf4bf89b1290a76c38aa	Well, you can sorta design a virtual house at behr.com.  However, you don't get to build it from scratch-  more like you choose the layout of the room you want to pain, and then choose the colors- not nearly as satisfying.  I don't know if there are any online programs, but you can buy a program at a computer store for fairly cheap ( I got mine at  CompUSA for less than $20.00 before tax).<br>  <br>  If you change your mind and decide to buy a program, Encore's 3D Home Design Architect Home Decore and Design is a pretty good program.  Also ( this may sound a bit odd) a good program is The Sims 2.  You can download more materiels for it, and it's pretty fun-  and you don't have to make a family.

c97884712264a19f23634b93afda8d19aa	MegStatic is correct, although you can also obtain collars (and nifty skins and outfits) for your pet by unlocking Pet Career Rewards.  Each reward is given when your pet gets promoted, though they are selected randomly.<br>  <br>  On a side note, when you unlock one of these Rewards, you also unlock a code.  These codes can be used in other The Sims 2: Pets games (and can even used for the console version, though they have to be "translated" for the console format--this can also be used vice versa) to unlock the Rewards without having to get promoted again.  I'm sure before long these codes will be posted online to be used by other players worldwide.  I personally haven't unlocked any of these Rewards, yet--I'm getting the info from the Prima Official Game Guide.|`|f2ca53c7ad58a0ccb9cfcab9928bdc72aa	You can't buy them, u have to make the pet with a collar on.

The battery holds a lot of charge it lets you play for about eight hours straight

CJ tries to encourage<br>  him not to jump and then decides to try to save Madd Dogg himself.<br>  <br>  After the cutscene you'll be outside the casino. The blue dot on the radar<br>  shows a pickup truck you can use. It's nearby so run over to it, and you'll<br>  see someone talking on the phone. Kill him before you take the truck as he<br>  will try to drag you back out of the truck. Once you're in the truck, drive<br>  back over to where Madd Dogg is and park in the red marker.<br>  <br>  Madd Dogg will get ready to jump. The screen will switch to a top-down view.<br>  What you have to do is stay line with Madd Dogg as he stumbles along the<br>  ledge of the roof. When he jumps he'll hopefully land in the pile of boxes<br>  on the back of the truck.<br>  <br>  After you've caught him, a partially filled health bar will appear on the<br>  screen. This represents Madd Dogg's health and if it empties completely he'll<br>  die and you fail the mission. You need to drive him to hospital carefully and<br>  be careful not to bump into anything. When you reach the hospital, park in<br>  the red marker to end the mission.<br>  <br>  **************************************...<br>                                GLITCH WARNING!<br>  **************************************...<br>  <br>  There's a nasty glitch in Madd Dogg's mission that could force you to restart<br>  your game. During the mission, Madd Dogg stumbles around on the roof of the<br>  casino, but when you try to get the truck to catch him in, he'll apparently<br>  jump off the roof without warning and die before you can reach him. If you've<br>  used a lot of cheats up to this point, be wary of it as this is what causes<br>  it. There are no known solutions for this glitch, so as mentioned above you'll<br>  probably have to start a new game.|`|f2b1ec0181f08379e5d02ff20cd343b8aa	You can try this man

Each stew requires a total of 3 herbs, in any combination. 4) Drop a villager on the cauldron again, and he or she will go get food to add to the stew. When the stew is complete, the villager will move the cauldron off the fire. Some stews are good, some are bad, and some make your villagers do interesting things. Experiment and have fun with them. You can also find different "recipe books" that have been created for the game that contain all of the stew combinations.<br>  <br>  Puzzle 10 requires Level 3 of both Engineering Tech and Exploration Tech. Drag a villager to the ancient covered floor in the southeast part of the village and they will begin uncovering the site.<br>  <br>  Puzzle 11 is the construction of a hospital. After you purchase both Level 3 of Engineering Tech and Medicine Tech, a foundation will appear that your villagers can work on.<br>  <br>  Puzzle 12 is the construction of a sewing hut, which will allow you to change the clothing that your villagers are wearing. After you purchase Level 2 of Culture Tech, a foundation will appear that your villagers can work on.<br>  <br>  Puzzles 13-16 are the pieces of the Gong of Wonder. The four pieces can be retrieved in the following ways:<br>  <br>  <br>  A team of 3 Master Builders can open the crate on the beach, where one of the pieces has been hidden. <br>  After purchasing Level 2 of Exploration, your villagers can clear the thorns blocking access to the gong encasement, which will also reveal a piece of the gong. <br>  Prepare a magic stew that will allow one of your villagers to dive for the sunken gong piece in the pond. The herbs needed for that magic stew are: one of the black flower near the waterfall and two of the red-orange flower on the south side of the village. The pictures of the required herbs can be seen in the drawings on the wall once the vines have been removed. <br>  After finishing Puzzles 6 and 10, drop a totem in the center of the uncovered mosaic to reveal a piece of the gong.<br>  <br>  Once the gong is assembled you can experiment with the effects that it has on your village. You can bang the gong once every 24 hours. <br>  _________________________

With little money on hand, all I can recommend is get skilled at the games you already have, and play them often. <br>  <br>  2 games I can recommend (which I believe are fairly cheap) are King Kong (1000 points for beating the game) and NBA 2K6 which has very few achievements, but you get a lot of points for them.|`|JbrdZyq2aa	Well i dont know how cheap you are talking about but you can just go rent Fight Night Round 3.

The potion book you are looking for is in the resisted <br>  section second row from the last all the way to the left. Push the <br>  action button (X) when you are there than return back to Snape. You <br>  will now be able to enter his classroom.

Lily is from Puwei and Snowflower from Tongkou. As the years pass, they send messages back and forth using this language.

LOLgL5Acaa	actaully once u get finish ur pokedex u get a pokeradar from either rowan or game creator(in pastoria city in a house) and that pokeradar tells u how much the pokemon likes you so the more it likes you the happier it is|`|6JOe5873aa	Well, from my expierence, there is usually someone around who checks how happy your pokemon are, but for max effect, be sure to train it a lot, battle and win a lot, and give it aid when it needs it, then it will become really atached to you.
Js3cX3F9aa	Let it battle all the time without faint, or go for a saloon. The fastest time my togepi evolved was level 21.|`|41w8KOOPaa	Do not let it faint  in any battle and also give plenty of proteins, calcium, carbos etc. Then get it to level 30 or 30+. I made my togepy hold a moon stone just in case. But no need for moon stone. it will never evole that way|`|GsSUVRi5aa	You can do it one of two ways. First, the easy way is to just give it a moonstone at level 25, which always works. The second is to just keep it out of battle kind of. What you do is have it as the first pokemon to go into battle, and change it for another one that's stronger. This way, he will get XP without being dealt damage and he will be happy, because of the XP and be sure to give it vitimins and calcium that helps too.
FvPBux8taa	go for the plasma lcd because this tv if and your brother or sister want to watch a difrent channel you can split it in to halr trust me i have one and it worked so do the same thing|`|ad1e4c03186c3e86d4d8a206ca6be0efaa	Toymachiner brought up the main differences. LCDs are definitely better for gaming. When you finally decide on buying an HDTV, make sure you pay attention to specs such as types and number of outputs (component, hdmi, s-video), native resolution, contrast ratio etc. If you're out to get a set that is capable of outputting in 1080p, make sure that's the native resolution (i.e. 1920x1080) and not a tv that's upscaling to that resolution. And make sure you adjust and tinker with settings when in store because its often just set at the factor default settings.|`|AIJY3a5gaa	Lcd hdtv is way better<br>  Lcd hdtv: 1080p resoution, can hook pc up to, speakers, <br>  Plasma: no speakers, cost alot more than lcd<br>  so i would go with lcd lol|`|NxHnjXiKaa	I don't know what this kid is talking about, above me. Plasma televisions hit the 1080p resolution as well as LCD. <br>  "Plasmas": <br>  PRO's=1)Able to display black color better than any display. <br>               2)Has the highest contrast ration amongst other screens.<br>  CON=Burn-In's 2) Life Span<br>  "LCD"<br>  PRO: Has a lot greater Life Span 2) Immune to Burn-Ins<br>  CONS:Low contrast ration<br>  ------------<br>  My suggestion is to get a LCD, since your a gamer like me. I've seen a couple of instances when a person is playing a video game on a plasma and there is a lag accompanied with it. The fact of the matter is LCD will never "burn-in" on you for playing to much video games or doing other stuff.<br>  <br>  I would definetely go with a LCD, lasts a whole lot longer, cheaper, and IMMUNE to BURN-IN. (Can't even tell the lag)
J5o9bkZtaa	you have to follow it until it goes to a cutscene and one of the h-bombers will put a elctro shock collar on jameson or w/e his name is and then you have to follow the helicopter and get rid of bombs for a little then eventually you will battle a boss :)

ahELDbTWaa	There is essentially one save file for the game so you are constantly overwriting your old game. So overwriting the old game is the only option. I don't even know why they bother asking that question anyways.<br>  <br>  If/when you die (if I remember correctly) it gives you a couple options.<br>  <br>  1 - "save and continue" - This does not mean what you think it means. This option will save you life status, as in your level, skills, the size of your health and item bars. BUT NOT your progress in the story line. So if your a level 10, you simply restart the entire story from the very beginning. But hey, at least your a level ten still.<br>  <br>  2 - "load" - This is the option that will let you restart at your last save point and continue the story line. <br>  <br>  Some pointers on saving. Try to save when you are at full health and not under a time crunch to get a mission done. If you save a game at a bad time, like when you need to run all the way across the mall and kill someone, you may get stuck there permanently. <br>  <br>  For example, I saved a game just prior the last main guy, I ran across the mall and didn't kill him in time. So I restarted at the last save point, ran across the mall and still didn't kill him in time. I tried it about 20 times and I simply didn't have enough time to finish that mission. Since that was the only save point I had to work with I was shafted. I eventually had to start all over.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|u2vra9xoaa	you have to find one of like two bathroom is were you save   i think that game is not worth buying

PtmPkeDXaa	shiny pokemon are really(i mean really like 1/3800 chance rare). not to discourage you of course. I mean, my best advice is to not look for one, but rather wait for one to come to you. If a shiny pokemon appears, it might be really obvious because the color has changed dramatically on the pokemon, and a bunch of stars(or sparkles) will appear notifyying that it is a shiny. Just recently, i found my first shiny(yes!!FINALLY) from all the years i've been playing pokemon, i've only seen one shiny, and that was about 2 weeks ago(honestly) and it was a shiny unknown(blue). So whenever you are training in the wild, make sure you don't kill everything in sight, because you might find a shiny pokemon. <br>  <br>  You can also use a cheating device to make all the pokemon you see shiny(i don't recommend it though) hope you find a shiny.|`|t7LjjmV4aa	it is random.|`|AA10583047	dude seriously pokemon is out i played it when i was like 2

He tried to fix my x-box too. And one thing that you should never do is let sit on carpet...put it on a flat surface so that it does not suck up dust,dirt,hair,ect..One thing is about the date. If it's over 4 or 5 years old...it's probably dead(so sad...mine had a funeral at EB Games.).Um...have a professional take it apart and look at it(professionally).If he cant fix it or see what the problem was then the only other thing I can tell you to do is call Microsoft.Or you can go to X-Box.com or Microsoft.com.click on help and maybe it can tell you the problem or what to do.I sold my x-box to EB Games for $50 because of the problem i had.Then after that i saved up my allowance money for a PlayStation 2 and i say that its a lot better than x-box!!!!!------if you have any more questions just ask me at courtney_morgan14@yahoo.com<br>  <br>  P.S.-I'm glad I found your question because I love helping people

The caves with bandits have the best loot - armor and weapons are worth a lot of money.<br>  A few tips:<br>  Call me greedy, but I took everything that had a value higher than it's weight. Skip the doeskin shoes...and other crappyu clothes items.<br>  Go through the cave until you get fully loaded, go outside, and dump everything in a pile on flat ground, then go back in for more.<br>  Dump one item (or several of the exact same item) at a time, so everything lands in front of you. Otherwise, items will be dropped in a circle around you, and some can get lost. Some items, exspecially maces, will roll if dropped on any kind of slope.<br>  Find and keep any armor, clothing, or ring that has the "feather" ability. When your ready to carry loot, switch to the feather-enchanted items and you can carry much more at a time. (When you close an Oblivion gate you get a sigil stone...one with feather, especially when obtained at high levels, is great for enchanting an item)<br>  When selling the looted items, sell everything one at a time, and your Mercantile skill will go up much faster!<br>  Don't be surprised to loot 20k worth of items from a good cave...<br>  Awesome game...and my looting tips will really help...|`|7dLiFX0Taa	I'd have to say stealing is very profitable.

Here's what you have to do: Become a vampire, and then get the quest from the count of Skingrad and find the old lady and give her the grand soul gems, garlic, nightshade, and vampire dust of that one vampire, I'm not sure what else you might need. But after you get the cure from her you take it back to the count and he'll give you a large amount of reward money and if you keep talking to him about the same subject that he rewards you with, he'll keep doing it for as long as you want. Depending on your level is how much you'll get, but I got about 15,000 gold for each time I brought it up, after a few mins I had well over 500,000 gold easy

XTVCYaixaa	Hola amigo. Muy interesante tu pregunta. <br>  Hace muchos a?os jugué al original "The legend of Zelda" (el primerito de todos) que hizo Miyamoto; fantástica y modesta persona. Y recuerdo que en un principio no me gustó. Al poco tiempo jugué al segundo: "The adventure of Link", en la fantástica Nes de 8 bits (por aquel entonces, era algo maravilloso poseer la citada consola...), y me enganchó por completo, pero francamente, me resultaba muy dificil cuando avancé mucho en el juego, y me fastidiaba tremendamente que los diálogos estubieran en inglés. Adquirí tal dedicación que tuve que jugar al primer Zelda. Después, al tiempo, disfruté del tercer juego "A link to the past" en la flamante Super Nintendo, ?la recuerdan? Pero amigo, cuando llegó "Ocarina of Time"... todo cambió. Todos los "Zelda" posteriores mantienen la calidad típica y muchas novedades respecto a "Ocarina of Time", pero pienso, que el salto a las tres dimensiones de dicho juego marcó mucho hasta dónde podría alzarse tal aventura. Fue una revolución tal, en todos los aspectos que definen a un juego, que hizo sentir un gran impacto emocinal en todo seguidor de dicha saga. Por otra parte, en mi modesta opinión, la historia de "Ocarina of Time" me parece sencillamente una maravilla de la fantasía, de hasta dónde puede una persona llevar su mente a confines deconocidos y presentarnos momentos mágicos para relatar la historia. Presentarnos personajes épicos... ?Recuerdan a el Gran árbol Deku? Su sentimiento de anhelo, debido a su inminente muerte; no podrá continuar protegiendo a su pueblo, y deposita todo su apoyo y fuerza en Link... Me cautivó ese personaje... <br>  En fin, para mí, "Ocarina of Time" es el juego que he vivido con más intensidad hasta la fecha y doy gracia por haber formado parte de él, por haber sido "el protagonista", al igual que todos ustedes si lo han jugado... A día de hoy, hay máquinas realmente asombrosas, que traen a nuestros hogares diversión, tanto a solas como en común con otros jugadores, nos traen más fantasía día a día, acción y muchas más cosas. La pregunta que formulo es: ?Llegará en un futuro algún juego tan maravilloso como "Ocarina of Time"? <br>  <br>  Y para ti amigo, te doy las gracias por tu pregunta. Por haberme hecho recordar aquellos días, y por darme la oprtunidad de expresar mi cari?o hacia esta magnífica saga llamada "The legend of Zelda". <br>  ?Un afectuoso abrazo para ti!|`|10tLy633aa	Para mi el mejor es Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess por sus grandes gráficos y su fácil forma de manejar a Link|`|1864ee072b4ef344663719406f6e39daaa	el ocarina of time para n64<br>  y el minish cap para GBA es excelente tambien|`|S6oqiMzXaa	the legend of zelda the ocarina of time|`|aKwf1s9Baa	zelda:ocarine of time es el mejor yo ya he jugado todos los juegos de zelda y ese me parecio el mejor bueno no se si tu prefieras otra version|`|kJR6nP98aa	El utlimo no recuerdo como se llama, era el del lobo|`|sFwxVN5uaa	OCARINA es el mejor!!!|`|wqcbmNSmaa	ocarina of time  y majoras mask.|`|2DWaLiybaa	Ocarina of Time , elmejor sin duda, creo ke es el mejor juego ke ha sacado Nintendo|`|Lrhu2BpIaa	Definitivamente: The legend of Zelda the ocarina of time.|`|Ncd04KP6aa	ami me gusto the legend of zelda phantom  hourglass|`|QWHYerBZaa	pues esta ente "ocarina of time" (dificil,fantastico,largo) y "twilight princess" (graficas,jugabilidad,habilidades)|`|afc935d64291a8b356f6f242f4fd22e7aa	ocarina of time<br>  aunque twilight tambien es muy bueno pero parecido a link to the past|`|X0PHRAreaa	yo digo que como el ocarina of time no hay otro (exepto grand theft auto san andreas)|`|nJxAnIqmaa	bueno, para mi todos los zeldas son juegos muy buenos, muy bien realizados, y muy entretenidos, todos me gustan y me3 hacen pasar grandes ratos de diversion, para mi el mejor que he jugado es el twalight princess, me gusta su modo de juego y sus graficos son perfectos, tambien tiene armas diferentes a las de los otros zeldas, tambien me gusta mucho zelda link on the past, aunq sea de snes, me atrevo a decir q es un "juegazo" es entretenido y muy bien realizado,(para los juegos de esas epocas) , el ocarina es un zelda muy bueno, casi tan bueno como ZTP, es el 2 q mas me gusta, es muy largo, eso es lo que me gusta, son muchos templos (10) y me gusta jugarlo por que es uno de esos juegos que no termino rapido por mas que juegue, ademas sus graficos son de calidad(para el N64) <br>  <br>  bueno, eso seriA TODO, saludos|`|1g2jQB4maa	ocarina of time por que la historia es original y sin complicaciones y el twilight princess casi no lo he jugado pero por lo que se es un excelente juego al igual que su historia.|`|TXC7hOZraa	The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess. Creo que es el mejor por la cantidad de accion que tiene, y las graficas son muy buenas (aunque eso no me importa mucho). Lo mejor de todo es que puedes usar la espada montado en Epona (cosa que en TLoZelda: Ocarina of Time no puedes hacer). Tambien me gusta que despues de terminar el juego puedes hacer otra cosas, como encontrar los insectos, los "poes", son mas piezas de corazon... Zelda: TP creo que pudo ser mejor, pero de todas formas esta bien. Despues de TP es mejor Ocarina of Time y Majora's Mask.<br>  <br>  Nintendo rules!|`|W9GzOTVNaa	ocarina of time|`|bb0886c6cff120c7c70d6de68a69af64aa	Bien a mi me gusto mas el Legend of Zelda and Ocarina of Time ya que tiene una buena historia y hace a?os que lo jugue y todabia lo quiero jugar pero Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess tiene mejores graficos y la historia no se queda atras.

ETIHOWt9aa	You will find him in the wild. Check in what route it is. Then fly to a nearby rout, not exactly the same route. Then run (or use your bike ) till you get to the location it is in. Dont use your pokedex after you fly. If you dont sdee it, then check your pokedex again, and do the same.|`|THiWCOHkaa	this is what i did: i flew randomly around and checked my pokedex to track it. If i got close, i would walk there. then, i used my golbat to use mean look. Make sure the golbat stays alive and is faster than the latias, so you can use mean look first. I'm not sure how a Latios would run from mean look. oh, and are you sure its latios and not latias?|`|LubpBoMWaa	try catching a trapinch train it to level 45 but dont evolve it try going back and forth from one route to another eventually it will get to you and battle it|`|yfhg0oFyaa	well using any hm except surf will make it run away from it's point and your golbat has to be at a higher level then the pokemon using a master ball is the best way to catch it but if you used it already use timer balls or ultra balls it's hard but you will get it at a some point

To get a Larvitar, go to Route 207 and use your PokeRadar there. It should be in a patch that rustles more than others.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|WeH4SzLKaa	Professor Oak gives you it in the Pal Park!|`|JFjcLsRDaa	go to the pal park after you get the nationaldex and profeser oak will be there and give it to yuo gut its not that easy to get shiney pokemons good luck

To obtain an illegal copy of these games is 1) illegal and 2) it's stealing from the small indy gaming companies that are trying to put food on the table.<br>  <br>  It can take up to 2 years to develop cool games like this at the cost of hundred of thousands of dollars. Now you're wanting to take money from the developers pocket and potentially prevent them from making more cool games because people like you want it for free.<br>  <br>  It cost money to live in a house (or apartment), it costs money to pay utility bills and it costs money to buy food.

D5Imrjotaa	Tough question. I would recommend KOTOR. It may be older, but the story is amazing. It is extremely fun. The characters are great too.<br>  <br>  The second one is great also, but just, to me, didn't have the same feel as the original.
AA10726404	Nothing amazing.  Probably between $10 and $20 per hour.<br>  <br>  I have a friend who is a poker dealer in Vegas, and he said that the income is minimum wage plus tips.  However, the reason there is such a variance is because of the different ways that the tips are distributed.<br>  <br>  All the tips are typically pooled.  Then other poker staff are paid out of the tip pool, including money for supervisors and the guy who shows people to their tables (a brush).  So it really depends on just how big the poker room is, how much is collected in tips (I imagine that Wynn takes more large tips than Circus Circus).  And then it depends how the tip pool is distributed amongst the dealers.<br>  <br>  Also the exact way the money is distributed is relevant too.  Some casinos would let a dealer keep their own tips, but must give up a percentage for the other staff expenses.<br>  <br>  From what my friend told me, there are a lot of factors in play, so that's why I don't think there is a typical answer.<br>  <br>  But for a guy who's only qualification are the basic knowledge of poker, and throwing cards around, it is a better than average income.

mzJWNHjUaa	Thieves BURNT LOTS of money. Especially for assassins, u need moneys for the stars.Shadower burnt money in the 3rd job. Mesos bomb, it does real damage, but u will used up 50k for just one explosion. At 3rd job u can also stun enemy, just one for the skill , assaulter.<br>  Mesos guard decrease your damage received significantly, once you activate the skill, it last for minutes, during that time, every hit u got from monster will burn money. If u are really rich, play shadower, u can use the money to deal lots of damage.<br>  <br>  Hero is not a bad hero either, u dont need have to be rich to play it. They have good defense, deal good amount of damage when  reach 3rd job.U will have the combo attack and when it's fully charge, u can release all at one attack and it has a damn high damage, even though it is just one monster. the skill is good on boss monster unless they have dispel skills like zakum.They will remove all your charges every few seconds.<br>  Hero also have the ability to stun 6 monsters from quite a far range for 10 seconds, even though the damage isnt that high  .<br>  They can decrease the monster's armor too<br>  <br>  i would play hero.Good defense good damage.<br>  <br>  <br>  Visit www.hidden-street.net for more info about the jobs<br>  <br>  Note: cleric is useless on non-undead monster|`|QDnXivquaa	Shadowers are WAY funner.

BrIJ5JXAaa	This is a question I wrested with for years myself.  I have an massive lego collection from my youth that like to keep as complete as possible.  However people like to "play" with legos, both kids and adults.  I found the best way to handle this situation is have a least some legos that you aren't as protective of that people can tear apart and do what they want with and just make it understood that if something is already put together it shouldn't be taken apart.  As far as displaying them the clear plastic stands and riser available for model plans and collectors toys could easily be used to show off your sets and set them apart from the scap pieces.|`|fMllzc6laa	take some wood pieces, grind them, round the corners, varnish them. add a glass on it and hang it on the wall!<br>  Done ;)|`|dG60mKA8aa	My son has john deere legos on display.

L5Nf2pq0aa	The most common reason as to why this happens is that you might have high ping.  A ping is a test to see if a system on the Internet is working. "Pinging" a server tests and records the response time of the server, so you might have a really high ping which would result in you getting kicked off the server, even if it's local, high ping is usually a result of the latency between you and the host's server..  There isn't a a sure-fire way to stop it unfortunately, but it may also be the result of another application or program stealing your bandwidth, for example downloading or online gaming.  When playing online, look for servers with the least amount of ping.  You could try resetting your modem and router by unplugging their power cables for 20 seconds, but your problem may just be the servers you're choosing.

a0216725359f14b5fcb50069e6685c08aa	La controverse était prévisible, c'est la même chose à chaque GTA. Ce que je ne comprend pas, c'est que l'on s'obstine à nous parler des enfants, alors que le jeux est interdit aux moins de 18 ans, et à juste titre. La question qu'il faudrait se poser est de savoir pourquoi les parents sont souvent laxistes, démissionnaires ou pas du tout intéressés de savoir à quoi jouent leurs enfants.<br>  Il me semble effectivement, qu'un gamin de 12 ou 13 ans ne devrait pas jouer à GTA 4. Je vois souvent des parents me dire "oui, mais il y a déjà jouer chez un copains" je voudrais leur poser une question : si votre enfant tombe sur un film porno chez un copain, vous lui en acheter un, puisqu'il en a déjà vu ?<br>  Je pense qu'il y a un age sur les dvd vidéo et que ?a ne pose pas de problème, ?a devrait donc se passer  de la même fa?on pour les jeux vidéo. Il est indispensable que les parents suivent ce que font leurs enfants, et les jeux font partis de leur monde, les parents ont donc le choix agir ou subir. Mais lorsque l'on choisit de subir, il y a un moment où il faut arrêter de se plaindre. Je ne blame pas les parents, j'ai 2 enfants moi même et je sais qu'ils savent faire pression, mais si on laisse faire qui mettra des limites ?<br>  Bref je trouve ce "scandale" un peu ridicule donc, puisque le jeu n'est pas sensé toucher les enfants, même si je ne me voile pas la face, beaucoup d'enfants ont joué à GTA. Mais il faut être positif, ?a donne une raison à Famille de France d'exister, s'il n'y avait ce genre de controverse, ils ne saurait plus sur quoi geindre...|`|6a3df69d4fb9cef1abfbec26634189a7aa	c'est tout un bordel pour rien du tout ... sur la boite il est marqué "interdit aux moins de xx ans" donc si chaque parent fait son boulot de parent je ne vois pas ou est le soucis... le gosse de 10 ans ne peux pas jouer a GTA 4 et basta|`|S0vWslwDaa	Il ne faut pas trop en faire je opense mais il est sur qu'il est preferable de respecter le moins de 18s avant d'y jouer car c'est le jeu immoral par excellence mais a coté de cela je comprend qu un jeune de 15 ans veuille y jouer moi meme trentenaire je vais l'acheter cette apres midi.<br>  Mais si le cimportement d'un enfant change cela reste toujours au parents de garder un oeil dessus et de mettre les limites et discuter du jeu avec les concernés.|`|6e5a6d368551c435832869dc6dd84c3baa	Pour moi c'est le genre de jeu dont on doit absolument respecter la notice " interdit aux moins de..."<br>  C'est même pas une question de violence, c'est plut?t une question d'idée transmise, il faut avoir un certain recul.|`|9590bf84d0436b263c78612dbd67f0d4aa	Il est toujours préférable de suivre les restrictions d'age.

C'est de la faute au parents qui ont une arme planquée sous le lit par peur du voisin un peu trop coloré, j'ai bien été éduqué et pr moi GTA n'est qu'un jeu qui me permet de me défoulé c tt, j'ai jms u l'idée uen fois sortie de ce jeu de tuer quelqu'un ! <br>  De plus cette controverse est une publicité en plus pr ce jeu qui va etre le plus vendu de l'année !|`|iMeTzgzBaa	Je pense que ce jeu a une influence sur l'enfant de moins de 15 ans (18 est un peu sur-évalué) après cette barre le jeu ne bourra pas le gamin de mauvaises idées car il sera juste assez mature.<br>  PS: moi perso j'ai jamais aimé GTA, c'est bien sympa de se promener dans une sorte de NY, de piquer des caisses, de truander, et de passer des vingtaines d'heures à finir le jeu à 100%. Je vois peut-être que les mauvais c?tés mais je trouve que GTA c'est une sorte de Sims violent, pourquoi ne pas vivre sa vie à soi plut?t que de s'occuper de celle de personnages virtuels?|`|FfNVXkhcaa	les jeux évoluent en fonction des conséquence qu'il y a eu depuis que l'humain a eu la connaissance du bien et du mal, et qu'il est donc conscient de ses actes, pour les joueur plus jeune, ?a leurs donne une image direct de ce que l'autre attend de toi, "le plus méchant" est le plus "cool" plus de notoriété, ?a détruit la vision des choses dans ce monde car il y a encore de gens bon et de toute les couleur de peau...  ce jeux glorifie la violence et l'injustice, je n y jouerai plus. mais au niveau graphisme les choses évoluent mais en même temps ce n'est pas ce que le monde à besoin( même si je suis fan de gadgets et technologie) donc n'acheter pas ce jeu a vos enfant ni pour vous même car se sera des heures de "fun" mais à la fin de l'histoire, une conscience perverti! moi j'ai jeter le dernier à la corbeille, i l y a longtemps. j'ai moins de 25 ans donc faite moi confiance.<br>  <br>  ce n'est pas une question de recul ou de se défouler mais de réfléchir à ses actes, car ce que vous faite dans le jeux, c'est évoluer librement, et il y a des conséquence, mais vous ne les ressenter pas en votre esprit. ce que vous faite dans le jeux c'est comme la réalité mais sans le confort d'un chaise , de la sécurité et des conséquence dans la vie direct, c'est un mauvais jeux point!<br>  depuis je fais des sudoku, qui développe le sens d'observation.|`|e715MpB2aa	Pas d'accord du tout avec mes collegues!!!<br>  1/ Je suis certains que 90% des personnes qui critiques ce jeu n'y ont jamais joué, que ce soit les qriste ou les journaliste qui nous bassine sur la violence de ce jeux.<br>  <br>  2/ La question est mal posé car le probleme de GTA n'est pas la violence, mais le LIBRE ARBITRE et LA FRONTIERE ENTRE BIEN ET MAL (au sens moral).<br>  je m'explique: des centaines de jeux sont plus violents que GTA, ne serais ce que Resident evil ou un Call of duty, mais à la difference de ceux ci GTA nous place dans la peau du méchant, on fera donc du mal, on tuera d'autre personnes mais pour des motifs injustifié en terme de moral.<br>  Mais pour en ajouter une couche, GTA ne se contente pas de nous placer "du mauvais coté" mais nous offre aussi une liberté (physique et d'action) encore jamais vu. là se pose la question du libre arbitre; vais-je réaliser mes missions en essayant d'éviter les victimes civils où vais-je faire un carnage volontairement.<br>  <br>  je pense donc que si un enfant ou un adulte a une bonne conscience de ce qui est moral et immoral et de la frontiere entre virtuel et réalité pas de probleme avec ce jeu ( ou d'autre). Dans ce cas GTA n'est qu'un exutoire, un defouloire de fantasme violent mais qui ne veut pas forcement dire passage à l'acte. Chacun à son approche dans ce jeu, et c'est vrai qu'il peut etre dangereux pour certaines personnes (et a mon avis l'interdiction -18 est tt à fait justifiée). Apres pas la peine de le diaboliser car GTA ne se limite pas à la violence et au meurtre et en plus en créant cette polémique ces détracteurs ne font que renforcer le plan marketing de rockstar (developeurs du jeu).<br>  Ciao et testez le pour vous faire une opinion

Even more so in co-op.<br>  <br>  Numerous glitches - none really gamebreaking because they are preventable and you can just start the level over. (ex. falling through the floor (co-op) in when you step on the 3rd platform  to turn on the switches on the window before doing the previous ones, and the game accidentally loading in co-op mode on the beginning tutorial level which is the only one which cannot be played co-op.  And finally my funniest one, (but not surprised no one saw this when testing the game) - In the Grand Theft Scratchy level (Marge controls a mob of dogs (who can't jump)) - you need to build a bridge - the dogs build the 1st part and you use Lisa's Buddha power to finish it by placing a piece of broken highway and a billboard sign across the water in a certain place.  Well... the first time I didn't know what I was doing and I just dropped the billboard sign around where it was supposed to go (i was supposed to get the highway piece first).  Then I got the highway piece and accidentally dropped it onto the billboard sign.  The billboard sign when through the highway piece and shot straight up and out of site and didn't come back LOL.  I could still just barely make it across without it, but the dogs wouldn't and you need them for the next part. (Sorry, I had to tell somebody)<br>  <br>  And finally, I noticed (there is an extras menu in the main menu where you can watch the cutscenes that you have already seen) there is a cutscene in the game that does not show up in the list of unlocked cutscenes and there is a cutscene in the list that (probably mistakenly (it takes place at the end of the Grand Theft Scratchy level)) is not in the game itself.<br>  <br>  Those are really my only complaints LOL. (don't let my long paragraph on glitches turn you away from the game I've only seen 3 and they don't ruin the game).|`|iQliyznVaa	yes yes yes its great got it last week havent stopped playing if you love platform and you loved hit and run you will love this|`|mqxw7zrPaa	Hit and Run was awesome!<br>  <br>  If this one is better, I will get it (Dont ask me how...)<br>  <br>  [*Evil Laugh*]|`|zZxuNPhzaa	this game from 1993 year?<br>  <br>  may be...<br>  <br>  but I cannot pass

EzxeHsLHaa	I started to play it a couple of days ago. I don't play it everyday but it takes a long time to get away from it if you started once. It is pretty addicting! Probably because it is a whole story?! There is no real goal, not end to it. Unless all of your Sims die and that takes some time, doesn't it?|`|2uJQ5hPYaa	ur the only person addicted to the sims 2, i don't think so.....

The one where you are in Strangetown fighting aliens?  I love that game to death!  No, you are not the only person addicted to it..I used to have it a year or two ago, and I just got it back last night and I have started a new quest and I cannot seem to put it down.  <br>  I found out about it just by browsing games in the store one day. I liked the look of the cover.   What I like about it is the way the Sims talk in their own unique language, and how you have to pick the right thing to do when Cheering someone up , Restraining them, or whatever the case may be.  I like all the cast of characters and just love the game itself.   I am talking about SIMS 2 for Nintendo DS, so I am not sure if we are talking about the same game here, but either way..I love the SIMS. :)

I favor runescape over most other mmo's because of how fast JaGex releases content.. <br>  <br>  Maple Story is an okay game too. <br>  It's kind of a cute little game, but it's the most repetitive of all mmo's i've ever played.. but it still doesn't mean that you won't have a good time playing it.<br>  <br>  As some people will probably recommend wow...

tKL2wRNIaa	You have to get a true friend. You have to give a code to someone on the internet that you know or something like on here and that person has to enter that code in Toontown in 2 days otherwise it will expire. Then you can chat with them with your keyboard. If other people want to know what you are talking about, they will only see quack quack quack quack quack or something like that. You have to be a member to get toontown true friends. |`|AA12259461	You have to have a friend give you a secret from the game and type it in. When they make those noises, they are talking to a friend in free chat where you can say ANYTHING.

sF3y7gSuaa	If you defeat a Cog building, then you get a picture of your Toon placed inside that building. If you defeat a lot of buildings, you'll get a star. The stars are bronze, spinning bronze, silver, spinning silver, gold, and spinning gold. If you want a spinning gold star, you have to defeat A LOT of buildings.|`|tKL2wRNIaa	You get your picture and your team's picture inside the building until someone else takes it down if another cog takes over the building. You also get some cogs in your sticker book. If you had a toontask to defeat a certain type of cog or some cogs inside an building or anywhere, you get them done too. You also get your gag points up x2 x3 x4 or x1 depending on how many floors there are.
sF3y7gSuaa	No, you can't go on the same account on two different computers. It logs you off of the first computer. You actually need two different accounts. It's annoying. You and your friend could set up times for when you can be on and she can be on. That would be a good solution.|`|tKL2wRNIaa	It doesnt work because as soon as you and your friend logs onto the account and click on a toon, it will say Im sorry but someone else has logged onto your account or something like that. |`|dl8s5Lr1aa	Unless they have changed the game, no, this is not possible.<br>  If you are logged in and she tries to log in, it either gives a user error to your friend, or knocks you out of the game.

sF3y7gSuaa	Sorry, but there isn't a way to get the next Gag track without becoming a member. You can't get around that one. You can fish to help boost your laff, but that can only go so far in Toontown Central. You can also just train your Throw and Squirt.

They might also be in four stories but theres a 99 percent chance that you WONT get your task done. Go into NuttyRiver Nuttyboro and districts that are full to get in with people higher than you. If you cant find any in any of the portals then go to a quiet district and tell your tf or friend to stay there in NuttyRiver while you go and check someother place. If you find one in another place, Ask you friends to come over and then you can defeat the buildings together.....Make sure you have TONS of gags like throw and sound and toonup and squirt.

9MINEf9Haa	Peter Eastgate isn't subject to US tax laws (since he doesn't live there), but not to danish tax laws either, because he moved to Britain prior to the final. Had he still lived in Denmark, he would have had to pay tax to the danish IRS, which probably would have been 40-50%. The percentage is much lower in Britain, which would explain why he moved.|`|3Iyu7hrcaa	Different countries, different rules.<br>  <br>  The US has tax treaties with Denmark, so the IRS won't get Eastgate's money... but unless he moved, the Danish tax authority are making out.

ozK2hKJZaa	Sorry, it already passed Halloween. So Nabooti Island will come out in November sometime it might come out in November 6-20 or November 21-30. Those are the reasonable dates. Since Poptropica said it was coming out this fall, the answer is settled with November. I checked Wikipedia, the real date is unknown so don't go to clueless Wikipedia. Poptropica's Creator's Blog might even have a clue too, just like what it did to Spy Island, it said next week on the spinny letters thing. That is all I know so far. E-mail me if this helps.|`|tKL2wRNIaa	The range is from the last week of October to the first 2 weeks of November. The reason why its taking so long might be because they are planning to release the Big Nate Island too along with Nabooti Island. Maybe also with Reality TV Island...you never know. I went on Poptropica and when you look towards the down part you see click here to know when Nabooti Island is up. You just put in your email address and it will send you an email when Nabooti Island is up. I hope it helps!

tKL2wRNIaa	It was in Cottonpuff Field from October 24th to 28th. You had to go to Maple Tree Hill then fly down to where there was a leaf and a cotton puff tree. You also got a hammer from tink and also got the chance to get a 100 dandelion puffs. You cant get there now. The tinker talent thing is a rumor because I have the hammer and I dont have tinker talent. You choose it when you create a fairy. |`|GX7ata2Qaa	I'm not sure since I just started playing 10 minutes ago, but I don't think that rumor sounds very true. I saw a poll asking which talent should be added, and Tinker-talent was one of them, so I doubt it's attainable already.<br>  <br>  As for the party place, I didn't even know about it! Sounds cool. Maybe someone else has asked the same thing?

25016bef581e182dd3cebdc0d94c87a9aa	Originally, Rare Ltd. had a deal with Nintendo to create the Banjo series strictly for them. That is why you see Banjo-Kazooie and Banjo-Tooie on the N64 and even two Banjo games on the GBA. Within the past few years tho, Microsoft bought out Rare and have turned them into a strictly Xbox 360 company. I bought the new Banjo today and it certainly does not disappoint. They are still amazing games if you are lucky enough to have a 360.|`|wcgdQjaeaa	too bad i was looking forward to the game on wii(also hardcore 360 fan)it would be more fun i think...|`|XiNbUqDpaa	There's no real way to answer this. It was the developer's decision, but maybe they couldn't work with the Wii's technology, or they wanted more popularity with the 360.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Nevermind, person below me has it. Apologies for being under a rock.|`|CMNZikAnaa	Microsoft bought rare (the developer of the banjo kazooie games) a few years ago, so now they only make games for microsoft|`|ei4G8gMPaa	Well I belive it was originally supose to be on the wii but Rare seperated from Nintendo to hook up with microsoft so thats probully why... (Please excuse my horrible spelling)
ei4G8gMPaa	Hmmm....Id go with rock crabs there around the freminik shores waaaaaaay up north |`|t8BxAXMRaa	Not level three chickens lol, but level 34 deadly red spiders in the Karamja dungeon. You might need some food because a level 65 still gets hit easily
RtpspfdYaa	Yeah it is, you can play it online and play like story mode and stuff.<br>  Keeping it plain and simple :)|`|ei4G8gMPaa	I thought it was only for the xbox 360...Strange....But yes it is defenatly worth it.|`|vWuSJLkQaa	yes its worth it but u might want to try cod4 cuz its alot like cod5 to get the hang of it maybe rent it.
LTWLpGOcaa	Well...I don't buy them...but,I guess I will agree with you...so,YES!!!|`|uYysxlXJaa	yes!|`|2wdzakRpaa	yes. they dont have alot of toys r us stores in the city so its not fair.|`|ei4G8gMPaa	Well im not buying them but....Uhhh idk blah? Yes? eh...Ether dosent really effect me....|`|FhlBPCEHaa	what are you 9?
ei4G8gMPaa	Heh...First off you probully shouldent even try to buy accounts online bungie's on REALLY high security right now...And i mean like being at some germaphobics house and sneezeing on his cat. Yea. THAT BAD. Oh and that guys a jerkwad. You should probully report him to microsoft if you have his account name he'll get banned for life and stuff...Then again you were buying an account online so they might bust you to...Ok now I just killed my answer....hmmm...|`|meMVkhKcaa	Wow thanks for warning us hope no one makes that mistake it would really suck.

ysiE6IDjaa	I have never heard of a rejuvenator being offered at the official Sims 2 website if that's the site you mean.

AA10380562	depends on your atk, str, def.<br>  You would need at least 40 def, and 50+ str, and 40+atk<br>  I would wear full rune, Best weapon possible, anti dragon shield, and a ring of life.<br>  Another thing you could do is use a rune halberd and kill drags from behind a rock.<br>   <br>  Use games necklaces to tele to BH to bank. If i were you i would kill the southern most dragon.

They can breathe fire which will do extremely high damage (50+) to players not wielding an anti-dragon shield or under the effects of an anti-fire potion. It's main weakness is stab and range. I would say wear rune, if you were to melee it, or if you were to range it get the dragon hides.|`|iP8TRjXraa	Its possible, i would wear something that gives a little prayer boost, a rune plate, some dragon hide chaps.  They are pretty fast with a whip at my level, i think 107. :) Good luck.|`|xC6W8a5taa	Yeh definitely. Try using some strength, defence and attack pots (might be member can't remember), lobsters, addy/rune armour, a decent rune weapon, anti-dragonfire shield and you're there.|`|db3c27962889fac526d576dfba2e6188aa	Definately a dragonfire shield, and depending on your skill levels and quests completed id go with full rune and a rune scymmy. If not then full addy and a rune scymmy.|`|Bx06CG8oaa	If your defence is high enough, wear rune. Buy an anti-dragon shield. If not it's near impossible to kill it. Good luck! :)|`|HxrBJCE3aa	You should buy rune. And yes you can fite a green drag.|`|jSOq81bzaa	stop playing that game listen im a therapist and many of my patient suffer from a chronic illness involving such games as runescape and a game called habbo hotel which doctors in our day have created a new disorder called online-gametosis. which is caused by these games please email me.
kuCK3Bbuaa	Comparto contigo, Pero no creo que desaparesca el Ps3, de alguna manera  evolucionaran y haran algo interesante, para salir de la crisis, juralo que ahorita estan trabajando en algo novedoso y que sera sensacion en unos a?oss mas tarde .<br>  Es como las carreras de formula 1 hay a?os que una escuderia  se lleva los campeonatos por que  su tecnologia y sus motores estan por encima de los demas, pero esas  escuderias que , estan por debajo, estan trabajando en motores y tecnologias, que les rendiran frutos en a?os venideros, y asi sucesivamente, los que pierden hoy, estan trabajando en la tecnologia de ma?ana.|`|YW2hQBeiaa	La respuesta parace ser el precio. Es lo unico que me hace pensar 2 veces agarrarlo. Si estuviera un poco mas varato me cae que ya lo hubiera comprado. Mucha gente tampoco no sabe que ps3 tiene el Blu-ray disc player asi que no les interesa y prefieren gastar 300 dolares en el aparato solo. Tambien lo que me he fijado es que ps3 no tiene tanta publicidad como xbox o wii y si no se arriesgan a presentar de un mejor modo su producto no la van a hacer. A mi opinion Playstation sigue siendo mejor que todas las demas consolas y lo ha demostrado anteriormente solo que no con este modelito. No te apures seguro que si la logra hacer solo que ahorita las cosas no pintan muy bien economicamente y menos con un preciesito como ese. jajaja.|`|fA4nxiIBaa	vaya con lo que has dicho el futuro del ps3 se ve negro pero sony ya vera como se las aregla ademas esta guerra de consolas solo esta comensando hay muchas sorpresa que nos depara esas compa?ias quien sabe como mejoraran sus consolas|`|fHFqkgmwaa	De que sony no truena no treuan tiene demasiado prestigio pero de que esta generacion  truene el PS3 creo que si saludos|`|TS3ngw4Maa	jejeje compa, estas hablando un producto de sony, leeiste bien SONY, mas no mitzu o naoki o coby jeje dime algo que sony alla sacado del mercado por caro q se venda? es el mas rifado en tv`s y ahora con tv`s de lcd y plasma como bravia,  tiene los mejores celulares es mas compite con el mismo iphone, estereos y componentes genezi, xplod, reproductores walkman, laptop`s vaio y todos estos equipos de sony son de los mas caros en el mercado y cuando has visto que sony alla sacado una bravia o un w600 walkman del mercado por que esta muy caro? nunca, estamos hablando de una consola que tiene el juego mgs4 que fue nombrado el mejor juego del 2008, resistance 2 que fue nombrado el mejor shooter del 2008, en mi opinion estamos hablando de 3 empresas demasiado grandes, nintendo que lleba a?os en el mercado, microsoft que manipula todo software en el mundo y sony lider en eletronica, realmente dudo que alguna truene por peque?os tropiesos en el mercado jaja pero en fin, saludos|`|cj4T5FKuaa	Creeme Sony no va a tronar sigue siendo marca mundialmente reconocida y lo mejor de todo COMPRADA si decendera su produccion sus utilidades y seguramente tendra u gran recorte de personal entre otras cosas pero sobrevivira, Pd: Si hacemos cuentas el PS3 es la consola mas equipada del mercado si le pusieramos todos los aditamentos con los q cuenta a un xbox costaria mucho mas q el PS3 Saludos! Espero te sirva mi respuesta.
2Q2ltt1Saa	Try buying a different AV cable and usingthat, to see if it's an issue with the cables themselves.  Also try a different input on your TV if possible.<br>  <br>  If neither of these work, it could be an issue with the GPU.  MS will fix anything that's wrong with the system, including the GPU, free if it's under warranty, or for a charge if it's not.  You should learn how much it costs if you call them; it may be cheaper to just purchase a new system vs. getting it fixed out of warranty.

GKJV2EBSaa	To have two or more different hair styles this is what you need to do.<br>  To do this with one computer open up two windows.On one of the windows, log in. Go to Meezmaker and click the item you want. Don't press save! Then log in on the other window and again, go to meezmaker and select the other item you want. Now this is the tricky part, you have to press the little square button in the corner at the top, by the minimize button. Drag it to the bigger Meez screen and get both save buttons as close together as possible. Then once it's good enough, press the save buttons as FAST as you can. So it will save both hairstyles.It is very tricky to do so you will have to try it a couple of times.<br>  Hope this helps you!
