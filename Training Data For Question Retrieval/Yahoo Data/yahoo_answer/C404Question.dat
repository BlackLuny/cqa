We found a dead squirrel in the neighbors yard last week then yesterday in our back yard and now another one in our back yard. We had this squirrel that came around that we named Thumper because she/he looked like a bunny. It had its tail cut off and moved like a little rabbit. I started thinking I haven't seen her/him around, wait I haven't seen any squirrels around. I know we haven't put anything out unsafe for animals so what could it be? I heard about this new coco mulch that Hershey put out, could it be that? Some may think I'm being silly but I'm just heart sick and I want this to stop. I'm starting to worry about my dogs now too, is someone trying to poison them? Is there some sort of disease that's going around that anyone has heard of?

Right now I don't have $$ to remodel so I'm "re-surfacing" the brown tiles (Basically changing the color the easy way,) and also painting the walls.      I have included pictures of my bathroom. Some of them are poor quality. I had a horrible time uploading, so I apologize. I recommend you pause the slideshow then click on the pics individually.      I'm trying to choose between either of the yellows for the walls. Let me remind you my bathroom is TINY so I'm using this color to brighten up the room. The whole bottom half of the room is white and you should be able to see this in some of the pics.  This is also why I do not want to do more white tiles.  So much white in the room.      As for the color of the tiles, that's where that color chart comes in. I know it sounds crazy but I like the 3 on the bottom right. The browns! haha. But these have a granite look to them so they should go real well with the yellow. Question is which yellow.. darker or lighter and then which one from the color chart for the tiles.  Or a completely different color.  Just tell me what one goes with the yellow nice.      lets use yellow 1 as the light yellow 2 as the darker.      and then brown 1 2 or 3... going in the order you see them.         Sorry for such a LONG post. but I really would appreciate help!   Here are the colors.       http://s237.photobucket.com/albums/ff138...       Any other ideas would be appreciated. THANKS!!

Ive seen that type of tile done before and it each tile looks evenly spaced. The tiles he installed for me look like they were installed in 12 x 12 pieces as the perimeter of the meshed tiles has much wider grout lines than the interior. He says its normal and it happened because the floor is uneven but he installed the hardybacker himself so he should have leveled it. Please tell me if Im being unreasonable.       http://www.homedepot.com/webapp/wcs/stor...       Thanks.

So my carpet (40 year's of age) was torn out my bedroom this morning.And what do ya knw!! there was a beatiful hardwood floor underneath.

20090223102408AANJ2zw	Home & Garden;Do It Yourself (DIY)	My room is really hot and stuffy?	I have the smallest, hottest and stuffiest room in the house. It is the furthest away from the a/c but the room next to me that has two windows isn't hot and is comfortable.      I only have one window and it faces east, so it gets a lot of sun during the day. I put a black curtain up and a dark purple blanket over that to keep the heat from coming in but it still gets hot. I keep all electronics off when not using them and only keep my fan on 24/7 when I am in the room. We tried closing the vents in the rooms which we don't use but that didn't help much.      It's also REALLY stuffy. I do keep my door closed but the other room, which door is closed all the time isn't stuffy, and has twice as much sun coming in.    When the a/c comes on I can barely feel it coming into the room. Could there be something wrong with my vent?      Also, on the opposing side of one of my walls, there is a fireplace, could that contribute to the heat? I live in Florida.

I live in KY, and I harvested my spuds, Fall 08, and placed them in a dark box, but did not put them in a cold cold place.  So, now they are uneaten, and the sprouted bits are mauve and 8 or 9 inches long!!  The spus itself is a bit shrivelled, but not moldy or withered up.       Will these work for this year's plantings?  Or have they used up their growing over the winter.  It is too soon to plant here yet, by 6 or 8 weeks actually.        How can I use these 30 babies??

Hi there,      My husband found a job opening 4 1/2 hours away in a town we'd love to live in, last week. It was an internal posting at the company he's currently at, and so the job interview came quick. He's going to find out today if he got the position. This means we'll have to pack and move in just a over a week.       Any advice on how to do this quickly and efficiently? I'm staying at home at the moment because I'm pregnant so I can work on it during the day (don't worry I won't lift anything that's not reasonable).... I want to be prepared in case it turns out we're moving, I want to have some resources.      Thanks!
20090223111333AAN6vPq	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	How long is an effluent pump in a aerobic septic system supposed to last?	My sprinklers stopped working and I suspect that the pump is kaput. I pumped out the tank and it looks like a submersible pump down at the bottom there. Is there an easy way to test to see what the problem is? I am pretty handy. I do not want to put the repair guys out of work, it is just that I do not have a job right now and money is tight so if I can fix it myself I want to at least try before I call in the big guns. Thank you for helping me.

20090223111110AAu0AS3	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	New Flush Valve is leaking on toilet.?	My toilet upstairs had been acting up for years and I finally decided to go ahead and replace the guts over the weekend.      After removing and installing the new parts I attached the tank to the toilet turn on the water and notice that water started running out the bottom of the tank onto the floor.       I took the tank back off the toilet and noticed the water was coming from the outside of the flush valve screw.      So I sat the tank in the bath tub and tried a few things to get the leak to stop. Nothing worked. One thing I did notice is that if I rotated the flush valve to a different position the leak seemed to move. So I guess that is an indicator that there is something wrong with the gasket?       Should I replace the whole thing or is there a way to repair this?

20090223111614AABoUGw	Home & Garden;Other - Home & Garden	My house reeks of skunk, how can I make it smell better?	We discovered that there is a skunk likely living under our house. We've already called animal control and are just waiting for them to catch it and take it away. However, we think another animal intruded on it's home because it sprayed, UNDER OUR HOUSE, and the whole place stinks. It's hard to be in here without feeling like throwing up.       When it happened around 1am I tried spraying Fabreeze air freshener (and btw, never ever do that, it makes it smell like scented skunk and it's even worse!), putting dryer sheets on our room fan, and opening the windows. It STILL stinks in here. Fun.      Any suggestions on what I can do to help make the smell better in here? I feel extra bad for my brother who lives downstairs, right above where the little bugger sprayed. I am going to try buring some candles, but really I feel like going to spend the night in a hotel.       Any suggestions are welcomed. I realize I might have to wait it out but if there is anything I can do... please tell me!
