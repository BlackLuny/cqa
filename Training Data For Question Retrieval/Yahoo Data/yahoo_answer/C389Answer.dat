iW065Tmsaa	Hello,<br>  <br>  Well, even if it can be mitigated down to level 4, the fact that it has a mitigation system shows that the area is high in Radon. You seem to have read and made yourself very knowledgeable regarding the safety hazards, that said, is it really a risk you're willing to take? Your children are going to be living in the house too, if it turns out to be a mistake, you're putting their health in jeopardy.<br>  <br>  Another point of view is, what if you decide to sell the house or have to sell the house, it will be much more difficult selling a house that has a history of high radon than one that doesn't.<br>  <br>  Personally, I would not take the risk, especially with children.
G9rUYQqJaa	Assuming full sun, your top two things to consider is the fact you have clay soil and are sucseptable to drought.<br>  <br>  Two species that have ornamentals values and perform well in clay AND are drought tolerant are:<br>  <br>  Ornamental Pear (suggest Autumn Blaze) - Red Fall Color<br>  Hawthorn (suggest Thornless Cockspur) - Orange/Yellow Fall Color<br>  <br>  Both will give you fall color, white spring blooms and small little red fruits (more persistant with the Hawthorn).<br>  <br>  I have both of these trees in my yard (Zone 5) and they perform beautifully.  I have heavy clay soil and I don't need to supplement these mature trees during a dry spell.  In fact Milwaukee just had the driest August on record last year...no problems.<br>  <br>  Both trees are appropriate for smaller landscapes.|`|8gaPElwxaa	There are many varieties of flowering  trees, pear, cherry, plum<br>  that do not bear fruit.  Dogwood is also a pretty flowering tree, then there is Rose of Sharon (tree or bush)<br>  <br>  If you type flowering trees into a search engine you will be able to see many that will thrive in your area, you do not have to buy them but it shows photos and descriptions.|`|6xyeYjkkaa	If you don't have a lot of room try a dwarf or semi dwarf apple. An apple should do well but will require supplemental watering as will most any tree that isn't native to that area.

If you want to get an idea of size and what's available go to   <a href="http://www.starkbros.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.starkbros.com</a>    and look through the selections.

Had some in the neighborhood in northwest Texas that are like you describe.|`|w3lt3JyNaa	I have lived in your climate. I have had a lot of experience planting trees. The white flowering /no fruit tree that is so over planted right now is Bradford Pear..it has good fall color and nice white spring flowers but has very weak limbs on older trees. The first ice storm causes many of them to split in half and what you end up with is a very missshapen tree. <br>  <br>  A Dogwood is an understory tree that does best in a woodland (great soil, filtered sun).<br>  There are Plum trees w/ small leaves (no raking) and small fruit that are fun to eat or make jelly. Many bear in alternate years...and for best crops, don't rake up the fallen fruit, it disappears into the soil quickly. <br>  Do not think for a minute that you will get grocery store type apples or pears --not likely w/out a lot of spraying and irrigation, etc..<br>  <br>  A crepe myrtle grown as a tree might be a good choice but you want the most winter hardy varieties. Good flowers, good fall color, interesting bark in winter. <br>  <br>  A Redbud is also a good choice for you. Not as interesting in fall and winter tho. <br>  <br>  For a big tree consider a sycamore, they do well in bad soil. Great bark, become majestic trees but the leaves are huge and do not disappear on their own. <br>  <br>  Tulip poplar has interesting leaves, does well in your area and has cool flowers when it gets big.<br>  <br>  A Zelcova has tiny leaves that do not have to be raked, a wonderful vase shape and is a majestic large tree seldom grown. <br>  <br>  You could plant a Magnolia virginiana --Sweet Bay Magnolia....evergreen, lovely fragrant smallish magnolia blooms and the leaves flutter int he breeze and are sliver on the back---so beautiful. <br>  <br>  Outstanding tree book linked to below.

ZdF1hx70aa	Recipe - Using Multipurpose Flour<br>  ? cup multipurpose flour <br>  3 tbsp sugar <br>  2 cups cold water <br>  2 cups boiling water <br>  <br>  In a bowl make a paste using the multipurpose flour and cold water. Boil 2 cups of water and add this mixture to it. Stir continuously to avoid any lumps from being formed. Bring it to a boil and remove from the heat. Stir in the sugar and mix well. The mixture thickens as it cools. Use this paste to make paper mache projects.<br>  Recipe - Using Wallpaper Paste<br>  If you want a paper mache project to last for many years, instead of flour you could use wallpaper adhesive or paste. The reason is flour paste could become moldy in a humid environment. The materials that you require include the following <br>  <br>  1 cup wallpaper paste <br>  3 cups of water <br>  <br>  In an old bowl mix, water and wallpaper paste till it becomes a smooth paste. It is ready for use. <br>  Note: Wallpaper paste is available at any hardware store.<br>  Recipe - Using Glue<br>  Another recipe to make paper mache paste is by using glue. The materials required include the following: <br>  <br>  2 cups glue <br>  <br>  1 cup boiling water <br>  <br>  In an old plastic bowl, mix glue and boiling water to make a smooth paste. This paper mache paste could be used as a wet glue to make paper mache projects. <br>  <br>  If you want the flour paper mache paste to last longer, add a few drops of wintergreen oil. Try using non-porous wallpaper adhesive in a humid climate. It is wise to use a wooden spoon to stir and a plastic or rustproof bowl to mix the ingredients. Remember, paper mache projects would be messy; cover your floor or work area with old newspapers or old cloth.|`|2e5539046552ed43413e69a99728e78faa	water, plaster of paris and strips of newpaper|`|UQWusO1waa	yeah, Elizabeth, goood answer, and you have have my fav woman name.

1o1mcUpraa	I love those colors you have picked! I think they could definately be used together. I would add in black, and chrome accents, or white with chrome accents! Remember, you can also mix in a light green for throw pillows, and a softer pink and darker pink, and even black! Mix up all shades, used different textures, and patterns on the accents or bedding! I also think you could add in 2 mirror covered end tables, with chrome and black lamps on top! Even add a chandelier- something funky or white vintage chandelier or just a regular  crystal chandelier. Get a neon clock from the 50's. Spiral design would be cool on something. With the ideas I have, you can change things in your room to go on from years to come. Definately add in mirrored end tables and chrome and black accents, with a chandelier. It will look awesome!!!

vP4S6IZTaa	If your ceiling is at any bit of an angle like most cathedral ceilings, you will have to use a down rod. You would not want to place a hugger style fan on an angled ceiling.

Spread protective sheets around the fireplace.   Put on some rubber gloves and goggles.     Mix one quart of hot water with a ? cup of yellow laundry soap, such as Fels Naphta.   After the mixture has completely cooled, add a pound of pumice powder and a ? cup of ammonia.   Mix thoroughly.   Using a paintbrush, apply a thick coating of the mixture to the bricks.   After 30 minutes, scrub off the coating with a stiff brush and warm water, then rinse.   After your bricks are clean, pick up a masonry sealer and apply it to the bricks. The masonry sealer will make the bricks a lot easier to clean the next time.|`|AA11498082	Foaming bathroom cleaner.|`|IxhQtq5Eaa	If you have a functioning fireplace you understand that sometimes an overzealous blaze may, on very rare occasions, cause smoke to billow out of its confines (Not opening the flue prior to starting a fire is another reason this may occur). As a result, you're stuck with an unattractive film of soot on the wall above the fireplace.    A sooty wall is bad enough, but can be cleaned with a sponge and a little elbow grease. The challenge arises if your fireplace is nestled snugly within a brick enclosure. The sooty film forms on the brick wall above and is less easy to clean. Don't despair; removing the fireplace soot is not a difficult job, but if you're not careful it can get a bit messy.    Here's a surefire way to remove fireplace soot from your brick wall.    You'll need the following items:     1/A drop cloth, towels or plastic to protect the floor (which ever you have around the house)   2/Rubber gloves to protect your hands   3/Scrub Brush   4/Foaming spray bathroom cleaner   5/2 Sponges   6/Bucket   7/Water  This is what you do:    1/To protect your floor, place the drop cloth, towel or plastic underneath your work area.  2/Fill the bucket with warm water. The water temperature has nothing to do with cleaning the wall, and everything to do about keeping your hands comfortable.  3/Figure out where you'd like to begin. It is recommended to work from the top down. No sense in scrubbing the bottom part of the wall clean only to have sooty water drip down when you start working above your cleaned area.  4/Wet the sponge and liberally apply water to the area of brick.  Spray the bathroom cleaner over the wet area. Let it foam for about 30 seconds to a minute.  5/Now take the scrub brush and scrub the soot from the brick. It won't take too much pressure as the foaming cleaner works well on the soot. You'll notice the foam will take on the color of the soot. Not a very attractive picture.  6/Dip the sponge into the clean water and use it to wash the foam away. Once you wash the foam away you'll see a noticeable difference in the brick. For very sooty brick walls (those of you who make it a habit of forgetting to open the flue), repeat the process.  7/A time saving tip is to use two sponges and two buckets of water. It's easier to use one for rinse water and the other to collect the dirty soot runoff.    Removing fireplace soot is an inexpensive project. Don't buy the most expensive foam cleaner on the market. Buy the generic store brand; it works just as well.|`|4fded85bb017fba5407e3727176079ffaa	Detergent and a stiff wire brush.    If not, paint it.

b663010fec563a8838443a18a6bec461aa	Older model freezers use up LOTS of electricity.  Could you do away with the need for it and use your refrigerator's freezer?  That would save a lot.  Also, your computer should have a power-saving setting when not in use.  Small appliances like clocks and such don't really use that much power.  Your furnace and water heater use the most.  Try turning down the thermostats and bundling up.  If no one is home during the day for say, 8hrs, turn the furnace thermostat  all the way down,  but if your just going shopping or something,  just turn it down slightly.  Otherwise it will have to run longer to get the temperature back up to "comfortable."  Use your fireplace if you have one.  Also, check your insulation and weatherstripping around the house.  Thick drapes over your windows will keep a lot of the cold from coming in the house.  Best of luck.|`|PwHQSAxvaa	Don't use standby mode on TVs, cable, etc. Do not let the hot water go cold - it uses less energy to keep it warm than it does to heat it from cold.    Use low energy light bulbs. Only wash full loads. Try not to use a dryer - hang them outside if the weather permits, or air them indoors. Make use of low-rate night time tariff, if it is available to you.|`|IPu3SN7eaa	Unplug all charges when not in use. A charger for a laptop, cell phone, GPS, PDA, MP3 player, shaver... anything. When it is plugged in it sucks electricity. When not charging, unplug.|`|4z0Rk4Ddaa	Click below and see if this helps.|`|yEUo24Znaa	Start by switching all of you light bulbs to compact fluorescent. Most electric companies offer these for free or at a low cost.  Turn down the temp on your water heater and buy an insulating jacket for it.  By all means use the toaster oven instead of the range oven. Microwave whenever possible. Invest in a drying rack and dry clothing on it. I dry clothing on the auto cycle to damp dry and finish most items on the rack. It is a bit more work but saves money. In the summer use a clothesline.  Put clothes in dryer for 10-15 min to de-wrinkle and finish on the line.  If you will be away from the computer for more than 2 hours, shut it off.    Unplug small appliances when not in use.  If you do not already have drapes, there is another investment that can cut down on heating costs.  Many people have the temp on their freezer and fridge set much lower than necessary as well.  Start adjusting the furnace thermostat down 1 degree every 3 days until you have it turned down 5 degrees.  Wear layers and deal with it!   Invest in a humidifier, the moisture in the air makes you much more comfortable at lower temps.  If you shave your legs in the shower, use a bowl and turn off the water as you shave.    If you make a cake, stir it by hand.  Dont use the food processor to chop small amounts.   Invest in a couple of lamps instead of lighting the whole room.  You can use smaller wattage bulbs in many areas without noticing a huge difference, especially in areas like the bedroom. Don't leave outdoor lights on unless expecting someone.   Add a couple of blankets to the bed and turn down the heat at night and if you are gone most of the day.  It warm right back up and you do not use more energy getting it back up, that is a myth.   You can save in a lot of little ways that really add up, especially this time of year.|`|0qpf53GCaa	Think about efficiency. If you can, switch to hi quality CFL bulbs. Be sure your outside doors are sealed properly.

AA12092525	Just washing your bedding every week, can make a difference. Although you can't wash all your bedding in hot water, at least wash your sheets in hot water at 130 degrees. I wash blankets in cold water. Don't forget your mattress pads and pillows. One way to cut down on the washing of your pillows is to put them in a plastic bag and then cover them with a zippered pillow cases.    Step2 Also you can leave the plastic covering on your bed when you buy a new mattress and put your mattress pad on top of that. There are also covers that you can buy that keep dust mites out. You can search the internet for special sheets and other bedding. While you are doing all this, make sure you vacuum back of your headboard and any other place around your bed where dust mights could thrive.     Step3Get rid of your feather and down pillows. They are hard to wash and a haven for dust mites and allergies. Use pillows that have synthetic filling or are foam. Wool blankets are impossible to wash and nylon or cotton are better and easier to wash.     Step4 If you are doing your child's bedding, make sure you wash their stuffed animals, too. If there are some you can't wash then put them in a plastic bag and freeze them over night. That will be enough to kill the mites.    Step5 Because mites like it moist and warm, leaving your bed unmade helps to dry it out. If you plan to do that, flip your pillows, too, when you get up so the warm side is exposed to the air.     Step6Watch your thermostat, especially if you live in a humid state. Keeping the temperature below degrees helps keep mites away.     Step7Vacuum around the bed at least once a week, or if you have wood floors use a damp mop to dust, so that nothing goes flying into the air and landing on your bed. Wash your curtains or better yet, just get rid of them and use a vinyl shade.     Step8 The allergen sprays really work. Spray around your home and keep a bottle in your bedroom so that you can spray your mattress in between washign the bedding....|`|AA10685211	Dust mites are microscopic and invisible to the eye.  Vacuuming your mattress, curtains, or any other fabric covered surface will keep them at bay, but there is no known or definitive eradicator.    With children in the house, it is critical to use non caustic cleaners. See http://mysite.verizon.net/res8ksuo/envir... for more information on that.    I am a customer of Melaleuca. http://meleleuca.com I have detoxed my house and of late, with the Travolta tragedy, we have learned just how important that can be.

As far as I understand they're microscopic and cannot be seen. Perhaps it's something else you have?    BTW, I've heard putting affected blankets and pillows in the dryer for 10 minutes will kill all dust mites. Also seeing that dust mites live off of dead flaked skin, they probably won't be in your drapes.

bjSVClquaa	If you're buying a new mattress from a reputable company, you should not have to worry about bed bugs.  I have attached a link from the University of Kentucky Entomology department regarding bedbugs that shows what they look like on a mattress.  Best of luck to you!|`|l8yfpyy1aa	Most mattresses come in sealed plastic wrap from the factory, and won't have bed bugs.  The only way bed bugs could come into your house on new mattresses is if the delivery truck took away some old mattresses from previous customers, and bed bugs from those rode into your house on the outside of the mattress wrappings. So take a look all over the intact wrappings before you let them into your house.  Put up a squawk if the wrappings are torn or absent entirely.    As a previous poster noted, bed bugs can be picked up from hotel rooms.  They are hard to get rid of, and hotels don't always notice them in time.  When you get to the room, check the bedspread and all around the bed frame, especially near the head of the bed.  Never place your luggage on the bed -- always use the luggage rack or low console.      If you're really worried about this issue, do some research via Google.|`|GPrw1JZkaa	You can see bed bugs quite clearly, however i very much doubt a new mattress has them as they feed on dead skin, if on the other hand you mean dust mites, can't stop those, however you can buy a mattress protector.|`|vigFmfLmaa	The only way I know to check for mites is to take a chunk of the material to a lab to be tested.  I don't think the sales person is going to go for that...  Dust mites are everywhere, not just in mattresses.  They are in your furniture, drapes, carpets, etc.  They feed off dead skin cells mainly so if you're buying a new mattress from a clean, reputable store you should be ok.|`|2697c1729e017f780327da8beda5c294aa	Depends on your area, unless you have a trained dog, or a lab your not going to find them with your eyes.

Bed bugs don't infest something just because it's made of new bedding, bed bugs infest something because some mammal was sleeping on it and shed skin cells for them to feed on, and a hungry bed bug stumbled upon the find.  It's 100% more likely that, if bedbugs ever infest this new mattress, they came from someplace else instead - such as infested bedding, furniture, or stuffed animals..
0176bec1190980db12bdb38e1453e112aa	Bedbugs can be very hard to treat if 1) you have a cluttered room or home or 2) you live in an apartment. I would not bother with a "bug bomb". Bombs are usually made with active ingredient like pyrethrins and once this is dry there is no residual activity. Also the particle size of a bug bomb or a fogger is just not small enough to get into all the different cracks and crevices where bed bugs are known to hide. If a Pest control operator or exterminator is out of your price range and you are willing to roll up your sleeves and do the treatment there are a number of options open to you. Bedlam aerosol insecticide is the best product on the market to treat bedbugs. It is the only product known to kill not just the adults and the nymphs (babies) but also the dreaded bedbug eggs. This product can be sprayed on mattresses, box springs, baseboards, sofas, ..... just about anywhere bedbugs harbor. There also kits that you can get that contain Bedlam along with other insecticides in different formulations to make applications more economical. And last most folks require between 3-5 treatments done a t 2 week intervals. You can call 888-581-7378 and talk to an expert in this field.|`|b663010fec563a8838443a18a6bec461aa	Definitely get an exterminator.  Adjust your budget to allow for it.  They'll take care of it.  They have the knowledge and chemicals  and know exactly how to get rid of them quickly and efficiently.  They're really not that expensive,  and many of them offer guarantees so that,  if you saw another one,  they'll come back for free to take care of it.    And TCee is right...  most assuredly,  not alone..|`|4z0Rk4Ddaa	Bed bugs are very hard to get rid of.  You will need an exterminator to come and take care of the problem.  This is not an easy problem to fix and can be very costly and time consuming.  1) Waste - Bed bugs create a lot of waste, and that is harder to hide than they are. It can consist of dark spots on your mattress (which can be blood, feces, etc.) or of shed skins, eggs, dead bed bugs, etc. You may find it inside your mattress, in the box springs, or in the linens.   2) Bites - You should be seeing little red bites on you without really knowing why. People rarely catch bed bugs in the act - they come out when you are asleep, and only bite for a short period. Also, like many bugs, you cannot feel the bite until a few minutes after it happens. The bites are very hard to identify - most doctors actually can't tell you for sure what they're from just by looking at them.    3) Hiding places - Look in all the key spots where they could hide. This means the mattress and around it, folds in the linens, curtains, and nearby furniture. Look for the waste or dark spots. You probably won't see live ones, but they look like little mini-cockroaches.  4) Catch them in the act - Keep a flashlight by your bed, and turn it on about an hour before dawn and watch the sheets closely for movement. Bed bugs usually bite around then, but if you get up or move too much they will go back into hiding. This can be hard to do - if you've only got a few of them, they only need to come out once a week or so anyway, so you might get unlucky and not see any, even though you have them.  5) Carpet tape - This is a great way to do it. Get some double-sided carpet tape (it's tape designed to keep rugs stuck to the floor) and lay out strips around your bed, and on the sides of the mattress but where you won't run into it when you sleep. Leave it out for a few days. If you've got bedbugs, it's likely that at least a couple of them will get stuck on it. Treatment generally involves a lengthy inspection of your home, focusing on the bedroom. The exterminator will want to find all the places that they are hiding, and will use various insecticides - sprays, dusts, and aerosols are the usual methods. Baiting does not work on bedbugs.

That way no one can say "I didn't get it."<br>  <br>  So, start with your CCR's and go from there. Good luck.|`|AA10097817	I've never heard of a hoa requiring you to replace plants and trim trees. That's their job. Send them a certified letter stating your actions and request they respond immediately.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	You might want to ask in Legal but you need to post what they said & what your covenants are. You did the work a day past the time they gave you so I can't give any kind of answer. If you don't pay the fine, it will be a lien placed on your home which will be paid off when you sell the home but I would check thru an attorney before it came to that .  It might be cheaper to pay the fine than the atty fees. You also need to know if any others got similar notices & got fined or let go.
