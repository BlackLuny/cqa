This is a figure of speech based off the real girl scouts / brownies that earn points toward earning new badges by doing good deeds.<br>  <br>  In this case, what your friend is doing is congratulating you for making a good joke :)|`|RUuQ3syDaa	brownie points are not actual points, but for when you do something really good you "earn them". i think your friend used it wrong btw. an example would be :<br>  <br>  after erika spent the whole week caring for her annoying grandma without complaining to her mother, she grumbled "i better get some major brownie points for this"
Zy5TyS8gaa	Yes. I have a friend who goes to a boarding school called St. Mary's. It's in North Carolina. I can't remember exactly where in North Carolina but she another one she was looking at, also in North Carolina, was called "Salem," located in Winston Salem[, North Carolina]. I'm pretty sure there are other ones in the U.S. too though. Try Google-ing it.

cKwwt6xZaa	I don't understand the lower bit but English schools in year 7 generally do levels. I believe that the average levels at year 7 is level 4 and if they are getting level 5 that is above average. I'm sorry I can't be of more help. That is the mark system we have at the school I work in. If this doesn't help, I'm sure the teachers wouldn't mind explaining it. Well done to your daughter anyway. =]

OWGA6cFKaa	Well to be a neurosurgeon, you obviously have to go to med school. Apply to any undergraduate school and go heavy on the Biology and Chem. classes. Take a look at what med school you want to go to. ( Take a trip during the summer and explore them to get a good feeling for which one you want to attend) Find out their pre-Medical requisites.  <br>  <br>  After graduating from undergraduate school with a 4 year degree, (doesn't matter what you majored in, as long as you got all the pre-requisites.) Then apply to med school and take the MCATs (very heavy on biology and chemistry). After you got into medical school, you will take classes for four years and then you go into what is called residency, where you pick your specialization ( in your case neurosurgery) and you will study it for four more years and then congratulations you are now a doctor!|`|9ceIg9xnaa	I recommend  a Jr college (community college) for the first 2 years! <br>  <br>  I'll tell you why, Its the SAME thing... But cheaper!! Allot cheaper.. sometimes like1/2 to 1/4!! no joke! <br>  <br>  I'm in the process of preparing for college too..

You could take on an apprenticeship and study while you work.

44ujDxwqaa	i did supply teaching job for at least three years.. most of the time, we don't start on a new lesson, or topics.. we normally just let them watch movies or work on some fun school activities.<br>  <br>  Supply teachers are good because they have to know all the scopes of the lessons or subject matters in all grades, just in case they are put on the spot and have to teach a new topic.|`|1yGDFTieaa	It's difficult being a supply, however, there are some very good substitute teachers out there and yes, some pretty bad ones who just write the work on the board & let the students get on with it.|`|Q7lvSU03aa	Substitute teachers are not in general, good teachers.  This is because you do not need to be as trained as a teacher to be a substitute.  In schools I have worked in, you don't even need a college degree.  Also it usually attracts people who don't really care about teaching.  When you are only going to see the kids one day there is not much you can do to "make a difference."<br>  <br>  Honestly, for what they're paid, I don't blame them.|`|82a4bd999404bced3be0ccff2c393a40aa	Like with regular teachers, it depends. I have substitute teachers that I can actually trust to teach lessons and discipline and everything, while I have others that I have to lock my desk because I hear they snoop (from the principal) and sit doing nothing. Generally, if I know I'm going to be gone, I leave a LOT of busywork and worksheets for the students and plan on teaching the NEXT day.

W1xs3vYBaa	You can't. It's the innate capabilities that are formed in early childhood through early nurturing and genetics. However, if you want to be /smart/ that is something very different than IQ. <br>  <br>  Learn a language, eat right, exercise, and play logic games. All of these increase ones knowledge base.
QVVafz76aa	to solve this you need to look at several formulas.<br>  first the circumference of a circle the surface of a cylinder and the surface of a cone<br>  the cylinder is 20 ft across and 15 feet tall<br>  circumference of a circle is 2*pi*r where r is the radius. <br>  this translates to 2 * 3.14 * 10 = 62.8 feet<br>  now with the circumference we need to multiply by 15 ft to get the square footage of the cylinder<br>  15 * 62.8 = 942 square feet<br>  <br>  The cone area is calculated using <br>  pi * r * c where c is the hypotenuse.<br>  we need to determine the length of the outer cone. It is the hypotenuse of the triangle.<br>  We know it is 6 feet beyond the cylinder portion and we know the distance from the center to the edge is the radius at 10 feet.<br>  so to solve for the hypotenuse<br>  a^2 + b^2 = c^2<br>  36 + 100 = c^2<br>  136 = c^2<br>  c = 11.66 feet<br>  the surface area of a cone formula is then used<br>  pi * 10 * 11.66 = area of cone not including base<br>  we don't use the base sonce it is inside the tower in theory<br>  so.<br>  3.14 * 10 * 11.66 = area of cone<br>  366.124 square feet = cone area<br>  so<br>  add the surface areas of the cone and cylinder<br>  366.124 + 942 = 1308.124 square feet<br>  if you get 250 square feet per gallon<br>  divide 250 into 1308.124 to determine the number of gallons needed<br>  1308.124 / 250 = 5.232 gallons<br>  so the city has to buy 6 gallon cans at $18 a piece. They have to have over 5 gallons and they can only buy whole gallons and 5 would leave them with 58 and some square feet unpainted. <br>  the total cost would be 6 cans * 18 =  $108

8vKrxSYyaa	Study.|`|uJNVAA3saa	Log off Yahoo & start studying.|`|hyHvG1Olaa	One usually does not "become smarter" but one can always work smarter.  There is a quote from the Bible, "... whatsoever a man sayeth out of his mouth, that he believeth in his heart ..."  So the first piece of advise is stop saying bad things about yourself.  Self-talk can be very damaging or really bring one up so practice saying good things about yourself.  Check out this website for more information on positive self-talk, <a href="http://stress.about.com/od/optimismspirituality/a/positiveselftak.htm." rel="nofollow">http://stress.about.com/od/optimismspiri...</a><br>  <br>  Next, we all feel dumb when with others and this is not all bad, but comparing yourself to others is not good.  You have your gifts and they have their gifts so revel in your gifts and use them they way they were intended but do not desire the gifts of others for that is jealousy and damaging.<br>  <br>  Finally, years ago I got some great advise called the "Red Light Rule".  The rule goes like this ... whenever you want to say anything or do anything you stop and say to yourself, "1, 2, 3, redlight, red light, yellow light, green light, do I really want to say (whatever it is)".  If the answer yes then say your piece and if the answer is no then keep it to yourself.<br>  <br>  Good Luck ...|`|sN8aqb95aa	I'm going through a similar phase as you, however as i'm in the top sets, i usually try to beat the kids who get things like 49/50.<br>  <br>  My trick to you is to go on www.aqa.org.uk and click on past papers. This way you will be familiar with the questions format, and they will not trick you out with the occasional odd question. Once you have got your results, look at the questions you got wrong, and retake the exam until you get full marks. The mark scheme is usually similar, and i've found out that they always follow a similar pattern, with multiple choice. I advise that you stay off chat-rooms, e.g. MSN.

W1xs3vYBaa	It really depends on what type of IQ test you look at. If it's a ratio test about 5% of the population have an IQ over 135; however, these tests are less common than deviated tests now because people scored too high. On a deviated test there are about 1-3% of the population scoring 135 and above. It is suppose to be about 1% but scientists have found the number to rest more around 2.2% of the population. I believe, as knowledge about health and child rearing increase so will IQ's. <br>  <br>  The world average IQ is around 103, when it is suppose to be 100, so even with a deviated test intelligence isn't fitting onto the bell curve exactly. <br>  <br>  The bell curve is a pretty flawed system for quantifying intelligence. IQ tests are great for your own personal knowledge, but when used as statistics and comparing many to find an average they fall short. <br>  <br>  There should be at least 60 million people who have such high IQ's, but the number is probably closer to 100+ million in reality.|`|1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	Less than 2 people in 1000 will have an IQ over 130, so it's a bit less than that for 135 (0.2%).  Look up the Gaussian distribution for IQ scores and how to interpret it.  However, that's for real IQ tests.  For internet IQ tests, a score over 135 is actually pretty common - and a score of 190 isn't completely out of the picture apparently.|`|HBUO10i7aa	I WAS GOING TO SAY ABOUT 2%! IF YOU WERE TO LOOK AT A BELL CURVE (GOOGLE IT), ABOUT 2% ARE ABOVE THE 98TH PERCENTILE.
ORonhAuvaa	I wish you could actually meet some autistic people. It would be a very eye opening experience for you. Your niece is probably gifted. Autism is very obvious most of the time because it is so pervasive.<br>  <br>  Autism is a pervasive developmental disorder characterized by: <br>  ^Severe social impairments - often will not respond to their names, do not acknowledge you ALL of the time, not part of the time. Do not know how to play with toys. Do not share their enjoyment of something with you. Do not play with other children. Prefer to be alone. Become frightened and anxious when in unfamiliar places.<br>  <br>  ^Sensory problems. Cannot stand noise or bright lights. Often have very few food choices because they don't like the texture of most food. Some autistic children will only eat one thing. They also cannot regulate their emotions. They often tantrum as children. They do not like to be touched. Will often look at objects from the side due to sensory integration deficits.<br>  <br>  ^Gut issues: Autistic children often have digestive problems which are compounded by limited food choices. Often autistic children will refuse to eat anything crunchy and may become constipated. The other issue is having an overload of yeast in the gut which causes painful cramps and diarrhea. <br>  <br>  ^Do not understand the use of language. Children with moderate autism cannot label or imitate. When you show them a photograph of yourself or them, they do not know what you mean.

Does she she obsessed over things?  Does she have friends?  Does she play well with others?  These are things you should be asking.  I think it is great that she picks up on the details and has a great memory.  I would look more into the communication and social skills.  Does she make eye contact with you when speaking?  If she is making eye contact, playing well with her peers, has imaginary play I wouldn't worry.  If you are worried then contact the school dept and have her evaluated.|`|J7vxm1dtaa	no , she probably does not have autism.  because of her excessive verbal ability she probably has excessive intelligence andshould continue to work on it and someday she will be amazing. if you are looking to find out if she really is truely talented the best place to start woul be this website:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.nagc.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nagc.org/</a><br>  <br>  you should consider yourself lucky<br>  PS:does she have her own library card?|`|oIpsJ3Bgaa	It's impossible do diagnose your niece from the computer screen, but it could mean that she has an eidetic memory.

You're only a sophomore for God's sake, you've got some time to figure this out.<br>  <br>  Now, with regard to your actual question, the best way to find out what kind of shot you have at being admitted to a given school is to talk with their admissions office and/or to compare your academic profile to their incoming class profile.<br>  <br>  You've listed 16 schools in your question.  I would narrow down that list if I were you.  You do not want to apply to 16 schools.  You might end up applying to four or five of them.  It sounds like Ohio State is your first choice and your family's alumni connections may be helpful there (not sure if Ohio State has any type of "legacy" preference or anything like that).<br>  <br>  I would recommend beginning to inquire with the admissions office at Ohio State.  They can give you the best idea of your chances and what you might be able to do to increase those chances in the next year or so.|`|fPUixvHvaa	You are so Awesome already. . . . . .OMG!!!<br>  <br>  FIrst, I wanna tell you to take the test at least three times again.

The bombings were violent attacks to show that the Radicals were confident in forming the United States into a Communist country, like Russia at that time. I hope this helps. Good luck.

bu6BhCnpaa	I think it depends on the university.  If you withdraw, which i think might be a good idea, because they will look at your gpa and go wow, with only 1 withdraw...that's not that bad.<br>  <br>  if they ask as to why you withdrew, don't say it was too hard or i wouldn't get an a...just say "the teacher stopped attending class, and while there was a sub, i felt that i was not getting the extra help that i felt i needed to succeed in the class."<br>  <br>  that way its not necessarily you giving up, but its the teachers fault and its a respectable bow-out.|`|3OeE8kMQaa	Are you talking about a drop or a withdrawal. If you are talking about a withdrawal, my understanding is that one is not great but most admissions boards will let one pass, things happen it's life. But it sounds like you are in a bit of a predicament. for me it would come down to a few things: (1) Is it an important class for you to get a good grade in in terms of future educational goals, is this a core class that will be looked at more then an elective if you decide to pursue a higher degree. (2) Usually when you withdraw you loose tuition, can you afford to do that, especially over an uncertainty (3) Is this class so time consuming or tough that your work in other courses is suffering? (4) What's your gut, do you think you might not be getting a A like getting a C- or like getting a B? (5) Also you mentioned a test, how did you do compared to others in the class? That would give you a barometer for how you're doing. (6) Are you learning valuable things in the class, at the end of the day the name of the game is education not grades. Great GPAs are terrific but knowledge is invaluable. <br>  Consider these things and make a decision. Good luck!|`|XmLJ84YBaa	It depends on what type of class it is. Is this a class in your major or more of a general education requirement. Either way, if the prof just stopped coming to class and sent a sub without and explanation and I was in your situation I would drop the class. If the school you are transferring to asks about it; tell them the situation about the prof not coming to class and such. I wouldn't say that you dropped it because you didn't think you could get an A.

fPUixvHvaa	Colleges look for exactly that. They look for improvements. More importantly, they look for extra activities, interests and hobbies. Start keeping a list about the club and organizations that you are involved in and ones that you have been previously in. This is called, telling the school all about yourself. It's a "Personal Resume".<br>  <br>  Make sure to take the ACT at least 4 times and try and take the ACT-prep test to. Your most highest score will be listed.<br>  <br>  In addition to good grades, colleges want to know what kind of person you are and what are your interests. They wanna know what else makes you special than good grades.
Q7lvSU03aa	Ninth grade is a tough year.  Teachers expect a lot more from the students.  The bottom line is your brother has got to want to pass.  More than likely he is blowing school off and not trying.  If he has gotten Bs and Cs in the past it means he can do it.<br>  <br>  You will need to talk to his teachers that are giving him poor grades.  Have them explain why and what he can do to raise them.  Let your brother know that failing is not an option.  Set up a plan with his teacher and then check in with the teacher to monitor his progress.<br>  <br>  You may have to take away fun to motivate him.  As in anything he thinks is fun.  Remember: his future is at stake so be ready to pull out all the stops.  Good luck!|`|FmYkUfIDaa	Hi Sivree,<br>  One of the problems with young students is that they appear to want to be continually entertained. They don't cultivate good work habits when they fail to appreciate the bigger picture - their future. Some fail to understand the purpose of education and see no point in making an effort to study - 'all that stuff'.<br>  <br>  Discipline is a huge problem for many students coupled with managing their time and studies.<br>  <br>  So, how can you help your brother? <br>  Answer: You can only help him if he is prepared to listen without interrupting you.<br>  <br>  The message that you have to get across is that he alone is responsible for the choices he makes. If he doesn't take his schoolwork and studies seriously, he will not have a solid educational foundation on which to build a future career. He will have to repeat year 9.<br>  <br>  Employers are very selective when it comes to hiring people. They seek people who will help them to prosper their business - people who front up for a job-interview with a portfolio that reflects all the effort and hard work that they have invested in so that they may have better employment prospects.<br>  <br>   Rewards go to those who work for them.<br>  <br>  What should he do?<br>  Answer: Make a commitment to spend X-Time each day for his studies. Specify the time. 5pm to 6PM  I will study (name). Have a quiet study area and some peaceful music as background.<br>  <br>  Open a folder for each topic he needs to work on and title it. Each time he researches information or locates anything in newspapers or magazines, he copies this matter to the correct folder. When it comes time to complete his assignments, then he will have material to work with.<br>  <br>  On each folder, write the date that the assignments have to be handed in. Place them in date order. You will see from the above that successful study is all about getting organised, keeping folders in an orderly way on his study desk, knowing when each assignment is due, collecting supporting information and leaving enough time for the studies.<br>  <br>  Above his study desk place a motivational sign, "I'm doing this work as an investment in my future." or, Something else like that.<br>  <br>  Ask him to Google Jessica Cox, read her story and then say, "It's all Too hard!"<br>  <br>  If he does say that, then there is no way that he can be helped. Jessica is a living inspiration to all of us.<br>  <br>  No point doing all this supportive work unless you extract a commitment from your brother to make a new beginning immediately. Ask him to make that commitment as an investment in himself.<br>  <br>  Great that you care enough to help your brother.|`|8Q6mLWHsaa	I know this is an answer longer than usual, lol so please just take breaks in reading.I believe if you read it, you will realize everything i am saying connects to your brothers problem. You just have to connect the dots. It may seem like i am digressing at time but it is relevant to the topic......................................<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I thought about your dillemma, and realized it effects so many people not just your brother, but people of all walks of life, different ages, both genders, people in school, or the work force. <br>  <br>  <br>  A few things come to mind with ur problem. Your brother is not a special case. I would not dismiss the X-Box though. It is probably some of the problem. It is also probably the fourwheeler, other things and maybe girls lol. Learning is not fun, it is a disipline that Americans have to work on. Other nations do not have all the distractions Americans have. In America most American kids have a "wonderland" waiting for them outside (home, game systems, restaurants, internet, clubs, shopping, malls,alcohol, drugs, opposite sex, recreation, entertainment and what everelse) compared to some countrys where school may be the best place to be, compared to their homes, or the streets.<br>  It is very similiar to a drug in the aspect that it is "pleasing" it gives you a "high" maybe not the high a chemical drug would give you. Nonetheless though it comes down to <br>  <br>  "EDUCATION Vs. PLEASURE"<br>  <br>  Do you get what i'm saying.<br>  <br>  What can be done about it, that is a good question. <br>  I have some suggestions, however be prepared for the possibility he may have to learn the hard way, and actually "fall on his face" a few times before he wises up.<br>  <br>  In any pursuit either if it is education, working out, or a spiritual quest you are not gaining anything material right away. Education is just data chiseling away at the brain , working out is tearing up muscle, a spiritual quest is denying your senses pleasure. All of these tasks involve growth and sometimes growth is not fun. It may involve discomfort, boredom, loneliness, struggle, deprivaty, pain, etc. Why do you think truly religious people excell in many areas. Disipline, and endurance carrys people there. His education is competing with pleasure. Also we live in a country that even still has the wealth to empower the easy (pleasure) choice.KEEP IN MIND The poorest people in this county are still the richest people on the planet.<br>  <br>  You can reward your brother, and it may work but it will chart a course that he will go down that he always needs something to do something that he should be doing.<br>  <br>  Instilling disipline, and endurance in your brother is very hard. It would take a military type of experience to do something like that. <br>  <br>  Think about it most people ALSO need a reason, cause, purpose to go through a task, like education. Now there are exceptions some people just like learning. For most of us though we figure out that we need it, so we can go out and be employable in the future. Why be employed, well the answer is  money to support your self, of course.But so many kids live in the here, and now. They have everything they need at the moment so there is no need to prepare for the future. The mind is consumed by pleasure, and tricks its self into the idea things will always be this way.<br>  <br>  You need to show him why he needs to learn this, give him a reason, a purpose, even a cause. The concept of the reason, purpose, cause has been a driving force for  centurys when it comes to going through something not fun. It has drove nations, groups, and individuals to accomplish great things.  Does your brother know what he wants to do ( lawyer, doctor, engineer, teacher, VIDEO GAME DESIGNER, a trade of some kind, a business owner) If he does care, you need to show him a direct connection from the profession to the knowledge he needs to achieve in the particular field. You need good english knowledge when it comes to law, good math skills when it comes to engineering, and video game design.<br>  <br>  Your brother may need to be scared into reality as mean as it sounds. say he has four more years of fun, and if he can't get a job (and jobs could be super hard to come by, because of increasing immigration, and a poor economy) he may live in a mens shelter, and life will not be so fun. I am not saying to do this, but he may have to be "waken up" with fear or a reality check. Ask him if he has ever thought about being in poverty, or homeless. If you can get him to see that, you may be able to stimulate a "desire" to wanna learn, and grow. He will realize that he needs knowledge to continue his life style. He needs to know  his parents will not support him forever. He needs that FEAR (which is a powerful emotion), to counter balance PLEASURE(another powerful emotion) <br>  <br>  It is all about connecting the dot

TPkmiNneaa	High schools are not the same as they use to be. Now days the high schools don't give much homework assignments. At my high school, every night I had  3 to 4 hours of homework. We also had projects to do over the weekend.<br>  If you didn't turn in your work or if it was late it was automatic zero and a phone call was made to your parents. Now days, it seems like the teachers are afraid of the students, because of the potential lawsuit abuse by parents. I also see high school teachers who don't care and don't have a passion for teaching. Just the other day I was talking to my neighbor about his son's math teacher and he said the way the teacher grades their homework is by making the students hold up their assignments in the air. I have also heard this from other parents. The teachers don't even want to grade the homework. Another problem is that many of the teachers are not suited to teach the material. For example, there are coaches teaching mathematics. In my high school, most of my teachers had at least a Master's Degree in the subject they were teaching. Now days, it's all about certification, and these make the worst teachers. To become a good teacher you can't be taught, you have to acquire this skill from experience and develop a passion for teaching. Let me say again certified teachers are not the best teachers to have. <br>  <br>  I think you brought up a good issue, and the high school curriculum is not getting any better. If more students like you bring up these issues and more parents get involved then perhaps our high schools can get better.|`|RJcVtLAxaa	My English teacher from junior year was the WORST.

The next day in class they go over homework as a class, and the teacher only THEN instructs if it is needed.  They are learning everything all mixed up together - algebra, geometry, statistics, etc.<br>  She has a two teacher team that teaches all her subjects -- you can imagine that in these situations, there will be teachers who did not get a degree in one or more of the subjects they are teaching.<br>  I worry but she is making all A's....<br>  I feel they have dropped some things to the bottom of the priority list in order to have kids who can take the standardized tests well, and they teach to that end...|`|XKhNw221aa	English teachers are the worst.

YZ0ebe3Saa	That is a difficult decision to make that is for sure.<br>  I have know people that have done each of those.  But it can also depend on where you live and if you have done any "researching" on the school choices.<br>  <br>  With home schooling you are the teacher or you could chose to do the online courses, but I don't really recommend that option since they can strugle with a class and have trouble finding the help that they need.  That is not the option that I would want to chose.<br>  <br>  With the public school they can interact more with people but now these days teenagers are pretty out of control.  It doesn't matter if your daughter is the sweetest girl there could be things that you don't want for you.  There is always going to be peer presure and that is something that you can not change.  But you don't want her to hate you for not liking her friends.  But you could as have a situation were she does well and does not have those problems.<br>  <br>  With private schools there can be scandal like any other school. but she also get that intetaction with other students.<br>  There can be an issue with that. I now that where I live I didn't know this until resently but, the private school here is the same for all of the grades until you get to 8th grade.  Then you have the chose of either having you child continue to go to school in the same city but that become different since there is no longer a private school they go to the public high school. Or you could take them out of town at least 20 minutes away and have them continue in private school.<br>  <br>  This can be really difficult but I wish you luck.|`|aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	How old is she?  Take your time to decide, but if you make the wrong decision now, you can always change later.  It is not like you are stuck with one option for her entire education if you start with it.<br>  <br>  I homeschool my children, and love it!  They get a truly customized education that not even a private school, much less a public school, could provide.  Their lessons are tailored to fit their strengths and weaknesses, learning styles, etc. without them having to fit into a cookie cutter mold.<br>  <br>  Socialization is the most common argument you will hear against homeschooling, and if that is the biggest concern then I made the right choice, because socializing is no problem for us.  They are involved in 4H, Scouts, church, a homeschool association, they play on basketball and baseball teams, etc.  Sometimes we have to pick and choose which activities to do because there are so many options.  <br>  <br>  And, homeschoolers can also get into college without any difficulty before someone brings that up.<br>  <br>  Honestly, I believe that ALL students would benefit from homeschooling so I do highly recommend it-especially since you already seem to want to.|`|zhJOZhKEaa	You sound like you would like to homeschool... but you are nervous.  (I say that because you spent more words on that option than the others.)   <br>  <br>  *Most* new homeschoolers are nervous at first.  We've been brain washed by the system we grew up with... we've bought into the sterotypes and lies about homeschooling and homeschoolers that you have already seen here.  The thing is... they aren't true.  Homeschoolers can be very social... homeschoolers can get into great colleges... and you are *so* qualified to teach your child! :) <br>  <br>  Who knows your child better than you?  Who taught your child to walk, talk, toilet train, recognize their colors and so much more?  You can do this! <br>  <br>  Still nervous?  Try it out for a year or two.  Even if by some bizarre chance you were the *worst* homeschool mama in the world you would not, could not 'ruin' your child in a year or two.  Schools spend *forever* reviewing and playing catchup... your daughter would catch up if you sent her later on and she hadn't gotten far under your tutelage.   <br>  <br>  However... the reality is she will go very far under the one on one loving guidance of someone who knows her so well and has her best interest at heart.  No one... no homeschool mama, no public school teacher, no private school teacher... no one does it perfectly.   <br>  <br>  Don't let them tell you they do... I've been in public schools for years and even the 'best' certified teachers aren't doing it perfectly... and yet kids learn.  Why not let her learn in a place that will give her more time with and stronger ties to her family? <br>  <br>  Hope that helps!<br>  <br>  ETA:  No Manda, no such thing has 'acculy' been proven... it *is* just your opinion.  You will not be able to point us to this *actual* study... because it does not exist.  There have been a few studies done comparing homeschooler to public schoolers... and the homeschoolers have always performed very admirably in *both* academic and social areas.|`|Fcv0ol0Vaa	I would suggest public. It would surround the kid with a variety of types of people, so they would learn how to work with different people for when they get older and their social skills would be better. They also become faced with new ideas and it would widen their thoughts and make them more opened minded.<br>  <br>  For privet schools, it's really just one type of people so they only really know how to interact with that one type, so they tend to be a little more closed minded and they're social skills are okay but could be better.

Not saying privet school is bad but it could be better.<br>  <br>  Homeschoolding I dont like too much because it's acculy been proven these people end up not knowing how to work with people and a lot of the times it's better to have teachers who learned how to become teahcers and are spechlized for that subject then a parent. <br>  <br>  That's just my opinon.|`|fif9ku6Aaa	I'm 15 ive went to one public and 2 privates..<br>  <br>  Home school = NO<br>  dont do that every home school kid i know (besides one who then went to private) was weird and had horrible social skills.<br>  <br>  private i hate sometimes but you build better relationship and laugh your *** off at the stuff you get away with, private schools you do get a better education but the ones ive been to you do so much dumb stuff and its fun. id deffently recomend it for a few years.<br>  <br>  public i always wanted to be in it, but now i think, i really dont care.<br>  <br>  Private as long as its co ed is deff. your way to go but make sure they chill with public kids too. <br>  cos the more experiences you have in life the better you are.<br>  <br>  if you live in Maryland <br>  send them to OLH/SLS for middle school.<br>  times will be a pain but if her class is like mine it will be worth it<br>  <br>  So long story short.<br>  Private but not an uptight one, and deff co ed|`|an0asdA5aa	I would recommend a private or public school to home schooling as it is easier to get qualifications, and your child will get to know more children.  I would recommend private school if you have enough money, as the teachers focus more on the individual children, and generally behaviour is better and there is less chance of your child becoming hooked on drugs or something similar to this.  If you want your daughter to have a taste of the hard, real world and become tougher, public school is better.  She will be less pampered there but there is a higher risk of her being bullied.  Remember that private schools are quite expensive and if you change your mind and take your daughter out of private school and put her into public school, depending on the age she might be made fun of.  In private schools, she will be offered more opportunities, and it is often a good idea to change from public to private school at the half-way point in education, like moving from primary to secondary school, as she will have a well-rounded experience of school life.  If she is very clever it is better to go to a private school as she won't be held back.  <br>  <br>  These are my opinions, but in the end the choice is yours.

You are all over the place! What you need to do is streamline you introduction. Try to have a thesis and then 2-3 supportable points in your intro. Next base your paragraphs on your points in your intro. At the moment your intro is not persuasive, nor does it clearly communicate what you are trying to say. Also, rework your sentences. Most of the sentences are too short or they lack any cohesiveness making it really hard to read for the reader to stay focused. <br>  I'm not really sure what grade you are in for this kind of essay but I suggest reworking it so it flows better.

KVkU6WSpaa	It means "unnecessarily repetitive".<br>  <br>  For instance, in the phrase, "most fastest", the word "most" is redundant, since the word "fastest" means the "most fast".<br>  <br>  Many redundant phrases have actually become commonly accepted in our language, such as:<br>  <br>  "hot water heater", "unconfirmed rumor", "past history", "safe haven", "completely surrounded", "free gift", "false pretense", etc.<br>  <br>  In all of these the first part of the phrase has a similar meaning to the second, making it a redundant phrase.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|uC75y83Taa	Unnecessary.  Not needed to be said.  Repetitive.  For example:<br>  I got fired and lost my job. Or, <br>  He's fat, overweight and obese. :)|`|8PqsT1l6aa	The word redundant has a Latin origin and stems from the word redundans.

yOFmCZhbaa	"Cassius’s death (V.iii), upon ordering his servant, Pindarus, to stab him, marks the point at which it becomes clear that the murdered Caesar has been avenged, and that Cassius, Brutus, and the other conspirators have lost in their attempt to keep Rome a republic rather than an empire. Ironically, the conspirators’ defeat is not yet as certain as Cassius believes, but his death helps bring about defeat for his side."

sKFVilktaa	Congratulations on your achievements. <br>  I was the Valedictorian of my high school class of 450 students. To tell you the truth, a transcript is not the most important thing. It will not determine where you will be accepted or what you will achieve in life. Just keep a positive attitude and have full faith in yourself. Choose the one that will make you the happiest. Don't think about the money or the transcript, just think about what you really want to do. I highly recommend that you listen or read "The Secret" by Rhonda Byrne and "Rich Dad, Poor Dad" by Robert Kiyosaki. These transformed my life and I am now a successful business owner. Good luck!
Lfh0DWppaa	Hard to say, as the school district itself really outweighs state average.<br>  <br>  There are 2 websites that you can use to compare schools.<br>  <a href="http://www.schoolsk-12.com/advanced-search.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.schoolsk-12.com/advanced-sear...</a><br>  <br>  or<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.schooldigger.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.schooldigger.com/</a><br>  <br>  You have to type in the state and city or county, and you'll get rankings.

And you can always house hunt (hopefully) in a better school district when you think of your new Missouri place. <br>  <br>  Good luck!
6B3ojD2Laa	Here are some main points.  You can fill in with some examples or details:<br>  <br>  1. There are so many tasty treats to try like cookies, candy, ice cream, desserts.<br>  2. Many vending machines mainly sell fattening foods like sugary sodas, chips, candy bars, etc.<br>  3. Our lifestyle often has us sitting & not getting exercise:<br>  computers, TV, driving everywhere.<br>  4. People are busy so don't have time to choose and cook healthy. fast foods are quick, easy, and fattening<br>  5. Many people are overweight, so it seems abnormal to be too skinny and normal to be chunky.|`|iFCBEZW7aa	There are many reasons why it's hard to diet these days. There are temptations everywhere you look, fast food restaurants, chocolate and sweets in every shop, everything, everywhere. There is also the added pressure of looking good, so you are tempted to diet, but the pressure gets too much and you mess up the diet. Plus most of these diets dont even work, carb free, fat free, dairy free, you need a balanced diet with plently of exercise, not diet pills, not no food.|`|S3XT8UtYaa	We are bombarded with messages on tv, radio and signs urging us to eat!  Portions are huge, buffets are everywhere and of course, our idea of a serving is usually way off what the labels says on the box!<br>  <br>  Also, chemical additives in the food mess with our brains and tell us we are still hungry when in fact, we are quite full.  Example MSG.  Tons of articles on that controversial chemical can be found on the internet.<br>  <br>  Now add in the lack of desire to get out and move our bodies, and you have weight issues.  It's so easy to put off exercise until you lose weight, feel better, after the tv program, etc.  <br>  <br>  Dieting is a pain the butt and takes effort.  It's not fun and results are so slow to appear.  That is my personal opinion of why people have a hard time dropping and keeping the weight off.|`|TebPFTrJaa	Its so hard to diet because there's all these fast foods around us and we see them everywhere we go, they are in our everyday lives.

PnPVoakoaa	A Hooverville was the popular name for shanty towns built by homeless men during the Great Depression. They were named after the President at the time, Herbert Hoover, because he allegedly let the nation slide into depression. The term was coined by Charles Michelson, publicity chief of the Democratic National Committee.[1] The name Hooverville has also been used to describe the tent cities commonly found in modern-day America.
icB7HVxDaa	Double majoring doesn't necessarily cost more.  Currently, I am double majoring in biology and in English.  Biology requires that I take 62 credits and English requires that I take 27 credits.  Total, I only need 89 credits to complete both majors and my college requires 120 to graduate.  Since I have to complete 120 credit hours anyway, I can major in both biology and English and STILL have extra credits I cant take|`|e9d02e2d1da08594b6fa1b034ef8efbdaa	if you mean having 2 majors, then yes it will cost more in the long run because you need more credits to complete the degree, but per semester, you'll have to pay the same amount regardless of the number of majors, it depends on how many credits you're taking per semester.

cnPKAlDYaa	The student loan and bankruptcy is an interesting topic. Bankruptcy is one way of dealing with debts we cannot afford to repay, however, since 1 September 2004 a loophole was closed making the student loan non-provable in bankruptcy. Essentially this means that any outstanding student loan cannot be claimed in bankruptcy and it remains the responsibility of the former student to repay<br>  <br>  Full explanation in link below|`|LLeQyWGcaa	yep you still have to pay them.|`|7deb425958c53615415ce326bcbf08e0aa	Yes you still need to pay. You can't be discharged from a student loan.|`|AA10604086	,Good luck!!  It seems that at one time, students  deep in debt with student loans would simply declare bankruptcy and walk away from them.<br>  <br>  So, it isn't so easy anymore. With the potential of good earnings for the next 40 years ahead of him, that person better get used to the idea of monthly paymwents for time to come.|`|sN8aqb95aa	You owe them money, and they will not pay it for you.<br>  So obviously you will need to eventually pay them back.<br>  However they may give you more time, so that you can earn the money, to pay them.|`|ab2c491e6bca420e2c45c21f91d16208aa	yep its one of the few things bankruptcy can't stop,it still has to be paid regardless although if not paid in 25 years it is then wiped off your records.sorry probably not what you want to hear.|`|bf22c95447f9e45803ffe5391acb44a8aa	Student loans are NOT included in bankruptcy, .they also do not fall into the 6 year statued barred categoryy/loophole, so she is still liable for all the outstanding money and interest and will be forever.|`|tE3OKcZ9aa	Your relative is still responsible for the student loans since it is federal money. Student loans are one of maybe two things that will not go away with bankruptcy, sorry.

M7LThfoCaa	being honest it doesn't matter if you learn american english, australian english or just british english.

So don't worry and just take it easy, soon or later you will get into it in the right time|`|0rAgtGNgaa	its not really all that different.  the british do pronounce things alittle different, mostly due to their accent, and they have a few words different from ours but mean the same thing.<br>  <br>  You'll fit right in with no problems. Good luck from envy!!!!|`|gW0nD5cEaa	The thing is, the vocabulary is basically the same, of course there are some regional differences in both countries. Knowing AMerican English and say, living in New York would be different than living in Atlanta, or Maine, or Dallas. Once you know the basic language, the dialects in the US and England should not be that different. Most of the differences, like you say, are pronunciation and also slang words. Slang can vary from time to time, different generations as well as from place to place. <br>  <br>  And I don't know this, but maybe you do. How different is Portuguese in Portugal and Brazil?  If you know that, it might give you a clue as to the differences. I know there are some differences in Spanish, in Mexico and Spain, etc.|`|RNJ0NRTTaa	Well there's a big difference between american and british english, the base is the same but you will find some words are different in british english and then ofcourse the dialects.But I'm pretty sure that you'll get the hang of it quite quickly, especially as your english seems good.What you might want to check out are websites which compare american english to british english, google it, it might make things a bit easier for you for when you arrive in England.|`|SIQNnfnnaa	I think the biggest problem will be the Pronounciation and the way we use words differently to the Americans. E.g a trunk in america is the back of a car but in england the back of a bar is called the boot and a trunk in england is a box used for stroing things.<br>  The only other thing is that in London, in some areas they use a LOT of slang, but after a while I'm sure you will pick things up and in no time you'll be able to understand everyone. Why don't you try listening to some English TV programmes on the interent... eg ITV or BBC|`|c136c061470995f88a8560ed010a00bbaa	Pronunciation is not the main problem, words are used differently.

That's totally unprofessional!|`|Xu4x19y6aa	I suppose the whole thing is a messy situation.  Personally, if I think someone is pregnant, I figure they'll speak up when they are ready.

Really? I would vouch to say that all of you need something better to do with your lives.  <br>  <br>  Maybe she was pregnant before and had a miscarriage so she wanted to announce it at a time when she knew she would carry to term.  <br>  Maybe she is just gaining weight and the email only highlighted that to the whole school.  Doesn't matter what the reason was, it was her own.<br>  <br>  Doesn't matter that the letter was polite! Get real you wouldn't like if someone did that to you.  People are entitled to their own lives.  She's upset because you didn't go directly to her. Instead you made it something for the entire faculty to discuss behind her back. Nice one! <br>  <br>  I don't think you need anyone to tell you that was really inappropriate.|`|Cn4UuPFkaa	no!! that teacher is a douche bag!|`|QzWHMGHJaa	Why not, they were trying to get into her business!

And it's mean to gab about co-workers the way they did. Around here, sending emails like that could get ya fired--it's unethical. Doesn't set a very good example for the children either. <br>  <br>  So no, teachers should not behave that way.|`|L2jPYlbdaa	It's nobody's business except the teacher's whether or not she is pregnant.

You can do so much more with biology than just a biologist,  you can be a doctor if you study a little bit more in college,  and take more school after that lol.  <br>  But if you don't want to be that,  yeah, you can be a biologist,  it is a fun career,  traveling the world to empty places,  figuring out why a population of a certain animal is decreasing.

dY6HroZ3aa	Well, cooking in a nursing home is a lot more different than the regular ones.  Its a lot more responsibility since it deals with older residents with specific diets.<br>  <br>  In a nursing home the menu changes every 4 weeks.  There is a main course and an alternate course for each meal. Also you have the special diets such as salt free,gluten free etc.<br>  You also have chopped (ground) diets and pureed food for those who have a problem chewing.<br>  <br>  Care has to be taken so that the food prepared has the correct amounts of ingredients which the dietician has suggested.

qbWfyuOYaa	This is a VERY GOOD and personal essay my friend; if you desire to major in biology or somewhere in the medical field, this is an essay I would choose.<br>  <br>  I'll help you out with minor errors within the last part of the essay:<br>  One day, I hope scientists will come up with a cure for HIV/AIDS. This way, no one will ever have to suffer through such a disease in their lifetime or watch one of their loved ones struggle, even survive the pain! Many people have contributed and started to donate and fund raise towards the AIDS foundation.  However, I can only hope that one day, there will be a cure for this virus. Its unfair that so many people have to lose their lives through this disease; it would really make a difference in the world if such things were possible as to finding a cure to this disease. Even though my mother has suffered through a lot in her life, I am glad to have know her for the 17 years. She wasn't only my mother- she was my best friend. Even though she has passed away, she is still, and will always be, my one and only hero.

They seem reall stiff to start with, but if you enjoy reading, you'll spot the nuances in the writing. If you want even more'challenging' and extremely romantic in a strange way, then you need to read Wuthering Heights, In fact all of the Brontes' works are great. As much as I love these, I also think you should read some Huxley, 'Animal Farm' and 'Big Brother'' will get you thinking! As will George Orwell's '1984'.

uoknng0Maa	I recommend Keystone National High School for you. Keystone National High School is an accredited online high school. Keystone has online courses and correspondence courses (courses sent through the mail). Also, most of Keystones' online courses come with textbooks. You decide which course format you want, whether you want your courses delivered in the online format or the correspondence format or you can blend both the online and correspondence formats together and take them at the same time. They also grant you an accredited high school diploma, if you want to earn an accredited high school diploma through them. To be able to earn an accredited high school diploma through Keystone National High School, you will have to complete the high school graduation requirements of Keystone National High School. If you don't wish to earn an accredited high school diploma through them and you only wish to supplement your high school curriculum in which you are already enrolled, you can take individual courses which will earn you credits through them. Students around the world too can enroll in their accredited online high school program.<br>  <br>  You can learn more about Keystone National High School at <a href="http://www.keystonehighschool.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.keystonehighschool.com</a> .|`|Vasg3qP1aa	what state do you live in. search cyber schools on google. there are plenty of them. im in one myself. :) i go to pacyber. its only for kids who live in pa though.|`|eG7rb1Kbaa	You can even buy high school diplomas, such as from <a href="http://www.jostens.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.jostens.com</a>

The 1843 train was also dubbed the great migration The Oregon Trail died out in 1869, when the wonderful railroad was completed.

MIqdsUdnaa	I homeschool my three children.  I wouldn't go too nuts in the pre-school years.  They learn a lot more through play and conversation than they will from a set curriculum.  We did a lot of games, baking, reading, talking and playing.  As for curriculum, we've tried various programs, but we never really liked any of the all in one programs.  We, by far, prefer to pick and choose our curriculum.We've had great success with both Horizons Math and Teaching Textbooks.  As for L.A., we've done really well with a combination of Plaid Phonics and Explode the Code.  For writing, we didn't really care for any of the available programs, so we made our own.  On Monday, the kids pick a topic, draw a detailed picture and brainstorm a word list.  On Tuesday, they write a rough draft.  On Wednesday, we edit.  On Thursday, the write out the good copy.  On Friday, they present the story and enter it into their story binder.  They've really done well with this, and they all have an impressive book that they've written themselves.  For science,  we do anything and everything that grabs their interest.  For history/geography, we pick between two and four topics a year and spend lots of time digging deep into them.  We don't "study" art and music.  We incorporate art and music into everything we do.  We also cook and bake a lot and try to link the recipes to whatever country we are studying.  Yesterday, we did a science experiment in the morning.  Then we spent the rest of the day outside building a snow fort.  While building, we discussed arctic survival, the insulating properties of snow, acclimatization, winter birds and states of matter.  I'd like to offer two items of advice.  First,  keep it fun and love it as much as your kids will!  Second, immediately disregard any of the socialization nonsense your going to hear, especially on this site.  Homeschooling takes less time so we only need to "school" in the mornings.  Our afternoons are spent at workshops, dance, music, sports, woodworking, volunteering field trips, play dates, park days, swimming and skating, all with other kids.  Rather than spending six hours a day sitting next to same age in a classroom, my kids are out in the community playing, volunteering, interacting and learning with people off all ages, not just their own age.  Have fun with it and laugh a lot.  It can be a lot of work, but it is TOTALLY worth it.|`|zhJOZhKEaa	Unless things have changed... SOS doesn't start till 3rd grade.  <br>  <br>  I've used *some* SOS, but we felt to use all computer based curriculum would be a bad idea.  After using it for two subjects each year for two years... I would definately say we made the right choice.  The little 'tiny tutors' and such can be cheesy to the point of annoying.. I couldn't see making him listen to them all day long.<br>  <br>  I've tutored kids that used the LifePACs... and they make the SOS look absolutely fascinating!  They are very dry, dull work.  If you use either of these I would mix and match a bit to keep it from being the same thing all day long... but I'm not in love with either one myself.<br>  <br>  At the very least I would choose another Math curriculum... because I have seen SOS and LifePAC math and both were *horrid*.  I would recommend Saxon Math or Math U See.  I've only used Saxon with my son... but I know some families/kids hate Saxon and I've heard *great* things from those that use Math U See.  If Saxon doesn't work for any of mine we will certainly be looking at MUS.<br>  <br>  Now... all that is really my 'schoolage' recommendations... because for preschoolers I would just use the world around them.  You might pick up a little workbook or two at Walmart if you really want to do some 'sit down' work on occations... but for the most part I would just let the learning come through day to day life.  It's the most fun way... so it sticks with them best!  :)<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!|`|Z5g7hCXraa	I can't answer in regards to the "brand names" of curriculum, but I can say that preschool, as well as the next few years, should not be computer based.  These years are key for developing fine motor skills and exploring their environment.  Coloring, cutting and gluing, and math manipulatives are very important.  Lego is a learning tool.  The use of puzzles, paints, building blocks, and other toys that are not overly stimulating should not be overlooked.  Simple toys allow for creativity to flourish.  Going outdoors and inspecting the bugs crawling in the dirt is a learning experience.  These are the main things you need for the preschool years.   <br>  <br>  Introduce letter recognition when you can see that s/he is ready.  If s/he's ready, it'll all happen, but don't force it!<br>  <br>  You as the parent are the main source of "curriculum" for your child!  Keep exploring, keep busy, and allow time for your child to play with simple toys.  <br>  <br>  Go ahead and contact me if you want!|`|6fVzzNhiaa	For young children, the programs you mention are too academic.  Small children's work is playing; they have plenty of time before they grow up for seat-work and books.  <br>  <br>  If you want to work with your children (since you apparently want what's best), well-supplied and supervised play is best for the younger children who have no physical or mental challenges to overcome.

zTyj7DOiaa	I am assuming that you are considering studying to degree level?  If so, you may wish to think about that first based upon the options then available.  For example, a bachelors in combined psychology/sociology, followed by a Masters in Child and Family law.<br>  With such degrees, you could consider social work, probation service, child welfare etc.  Teaching is, of course, always an option.  At least by studying for a broad based degree, you would have a width of possibilities afterwards.<br>  It is always difficult to try to choose when you don't really know what you want to do in life.  Therefore I think to study a subject which gives you wide options, in an area that you will enjoy, will lead to you becoming more focused upon areas for employment which you perhaps would not have otherwise considered, or even known about. <br>  <br>  Your interest in drama etc. is something you could further in your spare time, joining local or college theatrical and drama groups for example.  <br>  <br>  I hope you have success with whatever you choose - good luck.|`|a2wPQqPXaa	What about a drama teacher?

For example, Atticus must shoot a rabid dog, even though it is not his job to do so. Carolyn Jones argues that the dog represents prejudice within the town of Maycomb, and Atticus, who waits on a deserted street to shoot the dog, must fight against the town's racism without help from other white citizens. He is also alone when he faces a group intending to lynch Tom Robinson and once more in the courthouse during Tom's trial. Lee even uses dreamlike imagery from the mad dog incident to describe some of the courtroom scenes. Jones writes, "[t]he real mad dog in Maycomb is the racism that denies the humanity of Tom Robinson.... When Atticus makes his summation to the jury, he literally bares himself to the jury's and the town's anger.<br>  <br>  I couldn't have put it better myself.|`|NBebnDHPaa	The dog was trying to kill the mockingbird|`|xJoMSkI5aa	Meet Tim Johnson.

It may seem odd to give an animal the last name of the family it belongs to, but it’s apparently common practice in Maycomb – Judge Taylor’s pooch gets the same treatment. But more interestingly, it allows the dog’s name to sound suspiciously like that of another character.<br>  <br>  From Shmoop/Mad Dog/Symbols/To Kill A Mockingbird

NoLKiZonaa	Well, the Industrial Revolution was all about modernization. It started in England. During the revolution, factories opened and as a result more people moved to cities so they could be closer to their workplace. This is called urbanization. Women and children were most wanted by factory owners, because they required less pay and the children could fit into smaller spaces. <br>  <br>  After the Industrial Revolution, the countries that had participated were more modernized than the others who hadn't. Weapons used in war were more effective as well as the fact more products could be made thanks to the assembly line, etc.<br>  Also, the population of people living in cities grew exponentially. Most people left farm life to work in cities were they could earn more money. <br>  <br>  Hope that helped.|`|yaq7oaH6aa	Well, the 'little guy' was still exploited.<br>  He was just gathered into crowded dirty cities so it was <br>  more convenient, impersonal, and thus, easier for the exploiters.

kiD47XbTaa	Well firstly, a metaphor is a figure of speech in which a word or phrase that ordinarily designates one thing is used to designate another, thus making an implicit comparison, as in "a sea of troubles" or "All the world's a stage" (Shakespeare).<br>  (something used, or regarded as being used, to represent something else; emblem; symbol).<br>  <br>  Firstly, I'll start with the title:  the title is a metaphor comparing Katharina Minola to a shrew, a mouse-like mammal that is extremely mean-tempered. Other metaphors compare her to animals that require considerable training before they are docile enough to serve their masters, this is especially shown in Petruchio's long monologue. <br>  <br>  ACT 2, SCENE 1 (metaphors): <br>  <br>  KATHERINE: 'Moved' - in good time! Let him that moved you hither <br>                       Remove you hence. I knew you at first<br>                       You were a movable.<br>  PETRUCHIO: Why, what's a movable?<br>  KATHERINE: A joint stool.<br>  <br>  1. Firstly, Petruchio has just told Katherine in line 190 that Katherine is easy to lead. Katherine is a bit offended about this, but says that Petruchio is much easier to lead then herself. Petruchio then asks 'what's movable?' and Katherine replies with 'a joint stool', which of course has nothing to do with their conversation. Petruchio then replies with "Thou hast hit it. Come sit on me." which implies 'if i'm so much like a joint stool, why don't you come sit on me.' which is kind of like a sexual joke. <br>  Altogether, Katherine is comparing Petruchio to a joint stool. <br>  <br>  2. <br>  PETRUCHIO: O slow-winged turtle, shall a buzzard take thee?<br>  KATHERINE: Ay, for a turtle, as he takes a buzzard.<br>  PETRUCHIO: Come, come, you wasp! I'faith you are too angry.<br>  KATHERINE: If I be waspish, best beware my sting.<br>  PETRUCHIO: My remedy is then to pluck it out.<br>  KATHERINE: Ay, if the fool could find it where it lies.<br>  PETRUCHIO: Who knows not where a wasp does wear his sting?<br>                       In his tail.<br>  KATHERINE: In his tongue.<br>  PETRUCHIO: Whose tongue?<br>  KATHERINE: Yours, if you talk of tales, and so farewell. <br>  <br>  Okie dokie, this is both the characters katherine and petruchio basically comparing each other to animals, and trying to out-do each other, thinking that they're better then the other person. Petruchio firstly compares katherine to a turtle dove which is a symbol of love, but katherine replies thinking that he meant a real turtle (when she probably knew exactly what he had said, she probably just wanted to start another argument), then petruchio says that katherine resembles a wasp. They then continue on going on about 'plucking' a wasps sting out, when in fact, all petruchio is doing is talking about how he is going to tame katherine, and since katherine has such a sharp tongue she always thinks that he won't do a thing and continues on acting like they're still talking about the wasp. <br>  <br>  I'm not going to do anymore because it's not my homework, but this is sooooo easy, seriously, there's HEAPS of metaphors in Act 2, Scene 1. I mean, there's like ten per page. But basically, they're comparing each other to something else, whether its a person or an object and talking about it as if it were something else. <br>  So, yeah, have a go of it, it's actually pretty fun because its actually a really good play (well compared to the tempest).

SIhxrxD3aa	We don't do GCSE's or A levels in America.  In America, we go to high school (similar to your secondary schools) until we are 18.  Then we go to college.  In America, college and university mean pretty much the same thing.  In order to get an MD in the US, it would be 8 years after high school.  Our pre-med curriculum is probably similar to what you would be doing in A levels.  There is a lot of biology, chemistry, physics, etc.  But, during this time you earn a bachelor's degree in a field of interest.  This takes 4 years.  After that, you go to medical school which is 4 years.<br>  So, post secondary school it would take about the same amount of time, but a UK student would be finished younger because Americans stay in secondary school until 18 rather than 16.|`|1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	You need a 4-year college degree to apply to US medical school.

If you're going to be getting it in 3 months, which is also June, you're technically the same as a senior in high school, aren't you? If that's the case, you can apply to whatever school you want, as long as they have rolling admissions and their deadline didn't pass yet. Try SUNY Binghamtom...I think it's rolling and it's a fairly good school.<br>  I'm really not 100% sure, but...yeah. .____.|`|jiBMFeihaa	I'm in a much worse situation then you are (sorry for not answering the question but I want to bring the problem up).

The school only went up to third grade and it had its pros and cons.<br>  Pros: each student went at their own pace.  Kids who graduated from that school were strong students, and independent learners.<br>  Cons: kids learned that if they just keep trying every possible answer (multiple choice) they could eventually just guess their way through the program without trying or learning.<br>  <br>  Conclusion: I think students will always be able to out smart the computer.  But it will become a bigger and bigger part of the education system.|`|6WjUi3M5aa	No, and here is the reason why. Teachers not only teach, they have a day care quality. You have a background checked, state restricted, federally mandated free daycare worker who has to teach your child, and watch after them.

d8b0Thovaa	Watershed: 1898<br>  <br>  The year of the Spanish American War is generally considered a watershed in the history of American diplomacy. 1898 marks the point at which the United States translated its growing industrial might into military and political power on the global stage. It marked the beginning of the American "imperial moment," a period that scholars have long struggled to explain. In many ways, U.S. diplomacy in Latin America and Asia after the war was driven by apostles of empire-Admiral Alfred Thayer Mahan, Congregationalist minister Josiah Strong, and Columbia University president John W. Burgess foremost among them-who urged Americans to pursue a "new manifest destiny" and spread the benefits of American Protestant culture overseas. But was this missionary spirit enough to explain the expansionist impulse in American foreign policy? During the 1940s, Samuel Flagg Bemis, one of the great historians of American diplomacy, wrote that such expansionism marked a "momentary fall from grace" by an otherwise peace-loving United States. Bemis argued that political and emotional strains of the Populist and Progressive movements contributed to the nature of U.S. diplomacy in the 1890s. The American rush to acquire colonies and dependencies resulted, in part, from the "psychic crisis" of these reform movements and a sense of middle-class insecurity engendered by the rapid economic and social transformations of the late nineteenth century.|`|04LTcTU9aa	<a href="http://www.emayzine.com/lectures/Gilded~1.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.emayzine.com/lectures/Gilded~...</a>

1RTFKnwMaa	Well, it has been a while since I have studied Julius Caesar, but I can answer a few right off the top of my head.<br>  <br>  1.  Brutus, easily.  He went from being Caesar's best friend to joining the conspiracy to kill him.  As for detail, you might refer to some of the scenes in the play with him before and after Caesar's death.<br>  <br>  2.  Signs...there was a lion walking the streets...and I think a slave's hand caught fire...I don't remember much more, but there are one or two more.<br>  <br>  3.  The only funeral I remember is Caesar's, during which Antony used his eulogy about Caesar to rally support against the conspirators.<br>  <br>  4.  He did not run from it. Instead, he asked whoever was with him (I can't honestly remember this now) to hold the sword while he ran himself through.<br>  <br>   Hope that helped.

XmLJ84YBaa	Your freshman and sophomore year do count for something. However, if the first two years are weaker college like to see an upward trend in the last two years; just like you mention. Try not to sweat your grades from early high school too much; they cannot be changed so you must accept them as they are. Many schools have a spot on their application where you can explain the circumstances you were under that resulted in the lower grades early on.|`|P0a348ACaa	actually college really looks at you freshmen through junior years transcript. they don't look at senior grades because you are a senior applying to college and the transcipt you are sending will only show those 3 years and not your senior year until the end of the school year where the college that you choose ask you send in your final transcipt. then the college will look at your 4 years of school.

That is why the United States has falling behind compared to other industrialized nations. Higher education should have been available to the American people long ago and the government should have made it feasible for people to pursue higher education. When government no longer regulated educational institutions; colleges turned to be the other Wall-Street thingy rather than educational field and raising tuition as they see fit. That is when Americans students began to flee colleges and turned to blue-collar jobs.<br>  I'm amazed that European countries and Japan take greater responsibility ensuring that their kids find higher education affordable and assist paying for it. The question is that if this is the path Washington DC is planning to take, what will happen to the next generation 50 years from now?|`|jiBMFeihaa	No. That is why their are loans, and state schools.

They can describe the person physically, their characteristics, why they like that person, achievements, and anything else they want to include.

LQbSRLbUaa	Wavelength is the distance between repeating units of a propagating wave of a given frequency. It is commonly designated by the Greek letter lambda (λ). Examples of wave-like phenomena are light, water waves, and sound waves. The wavelength is related to the frequency by the formula: wavelength = wave speed / frequency.|`|pXpOXRnDaa	Wavelength has an upper part and a lower part.

xJoMSkI5aa	So who is Oedipus, really? That’s a good question. So good, in fact, that Oedipus struggles to answer it for a whole thirty pages or so. His identity crisis is at the core of his character. He doesn’t know who he is in the strictest sense of his mother, father, and place of origin, and as a result, he also doesn’t know what role to play in his life.<br>  <br>  Everything would have been fine if Oedipus had listened to any one of the ten million warnings not to continue in his search for the truth of Laius's death.<br>  <br>  "Loyalty" is the big word when it comes to our girl Antigone. Once her father dies, Antigone has to find someone else to be blindly loyal to (pun intended).<br>  <br>  In some ways, Antigone is reliant on the men around her for emotional sustenance. However, she’s an extremely independent woman willing to get done what needs to be done (that would be burying her brother) even if it kills her (and it does).<br>  <br>  From Shmoop/Oedipus and Antigone|`|R5UIMBvcaa	In a nutshell, Oedipus is the quintessential tragic hero.  In the Poetics, Aristotle uses Oedipus and the play Oedipus Rex as outstanding examples of a good tragic hero and good tragedy.  The Poetics isn't very long, and and reading it will probably be very helpful to your paper.<br>  <br>  As you'll see from reading Aristotle, Antigone is less tragic than pathetic.  She's certainly not passive, but it can certainly be argued that she suffers undeservedly.  Another character in the play with her name is a far better example of a tragic hero.  You should be able to spot who it is and why.

Q7lvSU03aa	I think the best thing to do when finding a one-on-one teacher is to interview.  If it is an option introduce several to your son and see who he likes the best.  Having your son feel comfortable and enjoying the process is what is going to help him learn and stick with it.<br>  <br>  You could also talk to them about how they teach.  I don't think there is a right and wrong way to teach.  Think about how your son learns, is he visual or auditory?  Try to match the teacher's style with your son's learning style.<br>  <br>  Good luck, the gift of music is fantastic.|`|JwpxsMhTaa	While being a good guitarist is important, I think the biggest factor would be his teaching experience.

To be an actor, you pick SUNY Purchase. <br>  <br>  So it's really not as simple as saying the SUNYs are better than the CUNYs.

At the time, it was difficult to sail south and around the Cape of Good Hope due to the winds around the equator and sails that made it difficult to maneuver such winds.

If you look at the latitude and longitudinal values, Mr. Columbus would have landed right in the middle of India if that pesky American continent had not been in the way.|`|PnPVoakoaa	Navigation plans<br>   <br>  The "Colombus map" was drawn circa 1490 in the workshop of Bartolomeo and Christopher Columbus in Lisbon.[6] <br>  Columbus's geographical conceptions.Europe had long enjoyed a safe land passage to China and India— sources of valued goods such as silk, spices, and opiates— under the hegemony of the Mongol Empire (the Pax Mongolica, or Mongol peace). With the Fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Turks in 1453, the land route to Asia became more difficult. In response to this the Columbus brothers had, by the 1480s, developed a plan to travel to the Indies, then construed roughly as all of south and east Asia, by sailing directly west across the "Ocean Sea," i.e., the Atlantic.<br>  <br>  Washington Irving's 1828 biography of Columbus popularized the idea that Columbus had difficulty obtaining support for his plan because Europeans thought the Earth was flat.[7] In fact, the primitive maritime navigation of the time relied on the stars and the curvature of the spherical Earth. The knowledge that the Earth was spherical was widespread, and the means of calculating its diameter using an astrolabe was known to both scholars and navigators[8]. A spherical Earth had been the general opinion of Ancient Greek science, and this view continued through the Middle Ages (for example, Bede mentions it in The Reckoning of Time). In fact Eratosthenes had measured the diameter of the Earth with good precision in the second century BC.[9] Where Columbus did differ from the generally accepted view of his time is his (incorrect) arguments that assumed a significantly smaller diameter for the Earth, claiming that Asia could be easily reached by sailing west across the Atlantic. Most scholars accepted Ptolemy's correct assessment that the terrestrial landmass (for Europeans of the time, comprising Eurasia and Africa) occupied 180 degrees of the terrestrial sphere, and dismissed Columbus's claim that the Earth was much smaller, and that Asia was only a few thousand nautical miles to the west of Europe. Columbus's error was put down to his lack of experience in navigation at sea.[10]<br>  <br>  Columbus believed the (incorrect) calculations of Marinus of Tyre, putting the landmass at 225 degrees, leaving only 135 degrees of water. Moreover, Columbus believed that one degree represented a shorter distance on the Earth's surface than was actually the case. Finally, he read maps as if the distances were calculated in Italian miles (1,238 meters). Accepting the length of a degree to be 56? miles, from the writings of Alfraganus, he therefore calculated the circumference of the Earth as 25,255 kilometers at most, and the distance from the Canary Islands to Japan as 3,000 Italian miles (3,700 km, or 2,300 statute miles). Columbus did not realize Al-Farghani used the much longer Arabic mile (about 1,830 m).<br>  <br>   <br>  Handwritten notes by Christopher Columbus on the Latin edition of Marco Polo's Le livre des merveilles.The true circumference of the Earth is about 40,000 km (25,000 sm), a figure established by Eratosthenes in the second century BC,[9] and the distance from the Canary Islands to Japan 19,600 km (12,200 sm). No ship that was readily available in the 15th century could carry enough food and fresh water for such a journey. Most European sailors and navigators concluded, likely correctly, that sailors undertaking a westward voyage from Europe to Asia non-stop would die of thirst or starvation long before reaching their destination. Spain, however, having completed an expensive war, was desperate for a competitive edge over other European countries in trade with the East Indies. Columbus promised such an advantage.<br>  <br>  While Columbus's calculations underestimated the circumference of the Earth and the distance from the Canary Islands to Japan by the standards of his peers as well as in fact, Europeans generally assumed that the aquatic expanse between Europe and Asia was uninterrupted. Ultimately the discovery of the Americas, rather than the opening of trade with Asia, was to be Columbus' legacy.<br>  <br>  There was a further element of key importance in the plans of Columbus, a closely held fact discovered by or otherwise learned by Columbus: the trade winds. A brisk wind from the east, commonly called an "easterly", propelled Santa María, La Ni?a, & La Pinta for 5 weeks from the Canaries. To return to Spain eastward against this prevailing wind would have required several months of an arduous sailing technique, called beating, during which food & drinkable water would have been utterly exhausted. Columbus returned home by following prevailing winds northeastward from the southern zone of the North Atlantic to the middle latitudes of the North Atlantic, where prevailing winds are eastward (westerly) to the coastlines of Western Europe, where the winds curve southward towards the Iberian Peninsula.[11] In fact, Columbus was wrong about degrees of longitude to be traversed and wrong about distance per degree, but he was right about a more|`|6W6B26sgaa	He wanted a shorter route to the Orient to the West Indies, so he wanted to circumnavigate the globe to find a shorter passage (aka, he wanted to find a shorter passage to the Orient from Spain by going around the globe).|`|35WL9oKyaa	He intended to try reaching india by sailing west instead of the traditional eastern route and he accidentally discovered America which he called the west indies.

Women tend to experience emotional as well as physical arousal so fantasies, mood and enviorment can all play a big part in the enjoyment of female masturbation. <br>  <br>  Sex surveys have universally concluded that approximately 67% of sexually active women masturbate (though much fewer are likely to admit to it publically). Most women discover the joys of masturbation in their early teens and can continue for the rest of their lives. Females that are in and out of sexually active relationships may masturbate, depending on the preferences of the woman. <br>  <br>  <br>  Female Masturbation Techniques Let's start with the basic fact that no two women are alike. With so many different ways to masturbate, there are bound to be some that work for you and others that don't. Try new things, explore new fantasies and a whole new world of masturbatory pleasure can be yours.... Clitoral Roll Circling the Clit Can You Spell Orgasm?

Throughout the years, researchers have taken varying stands as to whether it is actually some form or urinary incontinence manifested through orgasm or whether it is similar to a male ejaculation at the time of orgasm. In any case, most researchers agree that fewer than 10% - with some numbers as low as 3% - of all women can ejaculate during orgasm. <br>  <br>  The first time a woman experiences female ejaculation, she may feel embarassed and may think that she has urinated during orgasm. However, she may be quick to notice that the fluid is quite different from urine and contains prostate specific antigens, similar to those found in men's ejaculate. <br>  <br>  Sexual research has also connected g-spot stimulation with female ejaculation. Studies have shown that continuous stimulation of the g-spot causes the surrounding glands to fill with a clear fluid, which expelled through the urethra during orgasm. When the muscles contract during orgasm, the fluid ejected is considered ejaculate. <br>  <br>  Though most women can teach themselves to ejaculate by continued stimulation of the g-spot, not all women have enough glandular tissue in the area to generate enough fluid for a demonstratable ejaculation. This may be why some women easily find their g-spot and have g-spot orgasms and why some do not. <br>  Setting the Mood<br>  In order to really enjoy the experience, you need to be totally relaxed and in an envoirnment where you don't have to worry about distractions. Take the phone off the hook, lock the door, play some soft music and do whatever it takes to make yourself comfortable before beginning. Taking a little time out for yourself is not selfish, though it may be difficult if you have children and/or a husband/boyfriend. Select a room in which you are comfortable. Most women use a bathroom or bedroom, but it can be anywhere you feel totally relaxed and comfortable. <br>  <br>  Take Your Time<br>  Masturbation need not be a hurried thing, in which you are frantically rubbing or humping yourself to orgasm as quickly as possible. In fact, you'll find that if you take your time and slowly tease, stimulate and caress yourself to orgasm, you're likely to have more intense, longer lasting orgasms. <br>  <br>  Don't Be Afraid to Experiment<br>  Let's start with the basic fact that no two women are alike. With so many different ways to masturbate, there are bound to be some that work for you and others that don't.

UBNRb2Caaa	Sounds like you got a crush on your teacher - a major one if you peed your pants just because he came near.  Crushes on a teacher do happen, but to get over it, you've got to keep telling yourself why it can't happen - he's about 30 years older than you, he probably has a wife and kids, when you're in your early 30s he'll be an old man, and so forth.  Even use the fact that you peed your pants because of this and you don't want that to happen again.  Now, as far as peeing your pants, try to ignore the "piddle pants" comments and move on.  The sooner you put that in the past and don't make a big deal out of it, the sooner others will forget or get tired of making remarks.|`|o2GuhJCQaa	Probably sort the bullying out first. Tell a teacher, you don't have to mention about the crush you have on your teacher but yeah.<br>  Then think about it. He's 45, you'll get over him ;D<br>  <br>  Hope this helped :)

pD2MtL9Oaa	A hill with a steep slope.  Water will flow down this surface more quickly, causing it to erode more quickly.<br>  <br>  A hillside with few plants.  Less plants, means less root structures in the ground, which means that erosion will take place more easily.|`|gAJHfQGaaa	A steep slope would erode faster because after it rains on the slope, the water is running at a faster rate and carrying away sediments faster than on a gentle slope. <br>  <br>  The answer to your second question is: A hillside with plants will erode slower. This is because the roots from the plants help hold the soil together and help to prevent the soil from moving. So a hillside without plants will erode faster.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

Maybe pretend you need help with something.  Talking to her one-on-one will help you see that she isn't so scary after all and will build your confidence in the classroom.<br>  <br>  If it doesn't work, don't sweat it.

A339CwZaaa	you can make 'oobleck' (i think that's what it's called). it's the slime-like thing that hardens when you hit it quickly but stays and acts like regular slime if you push it slowly. it's a little messy but fun with science behind it (it has something to do with the polymer that it's made of).<br>  you can also do color-changing titrations. if you get the right chemicals, all you have to do is add the chemicals to each other, stir and watch the colors change.|`|8sRWYB0naa	hey if you go to a local library in the children section you could find books with great science projects, there is a lot of good ideas. Hopefully that will help.
xADIsKnVaa	You are the only person who can motivate you so I would suggest focusing on what will get you through the rest of the school year. <br>  <br>  You goal will be attainable if you focus on just that...obtaining it. Also, your focus on your social life/status landed you in this situation to begin with so maybe try focusing on yourself and what would make you feel good about graduating in 4 years (besides graduating with your friends). <br>  <br>  I can identify with you as I attended a private, all girls, Catholic high school I had a great difficulty staying motivated and engaged for a multitude of reasons. I had tons of "incomplete" on my transcript. Nonetheless, I was willing to grind it out and finish in 4 years because I just wanted to move on and go away to college.<br>  <br>  Allow yourself to develop attainable goals for the future! Are you college bound? Is there a place you've always wanted to travel? Is there a cool program you'd like to apply to? Creating something to look forward to is a big help!<br>  <br>  Good luck :)<br>  <br>  You only have 3 months left and that time will go by so quickly!|`|r1Tk0Atraa	well you should know you wont become anything unless you can accept your mistake.  You really need to get your act together before you can feel better.  Failing a sophmore year means you just work when you wanna work.  Which is stupid...sorry to tell you hun, but you are not going to feel better unless you are a better person.|`|KvBA8wS3aa	If the goal is attainable, then you just have to find the motivation, think about graduating with your friends, and how horrible it will be to be kept back an extra year. You may have to sacrafice some of your social time to do the extra work, but it is better than having to do it all over again! Maybe you can get your friends to come to your house and study with you every now and then. It is healthy to take a break from it. Maybe allocate yourself a certain time each day to call on your friends or take some personal time to spoil yourself, but stick to the times you allocate. It will be hard, but it is worth it for an education.<br>  No doubt you will be stressed, but you just have to keep in mind that it is all for a worthy cause.|`|qXFACB58aa	lol. Do you believe in God? haha. jk. ummm I would just wake up every morning and go to sleep every night thinking of what you have to do for the day and not worry about anything else. Take it onbe day at a time because that is all you can do. You CAN do it, and the fact that you have the possibility to do it, you should consider yourself lucky. <br>  <br>  Also remember to take care of yourself, you can't really afford to get sick.lol<br>  <br>  Good Luck! =)
1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	You can't take the GED online - the only real GED must be taken in person.  Every state sets the age limit for taking the GED, so look up what it is in your state.
nQdUjP0eaa	Depends, how low below 3.5? 10% had h.s. GPA between 3.0 and 3.24, and 16% had h.s. GPA between 3.25 and 3.49. This is according to college board. Heres the link: <br>  <a href="http://collegesearch.collegeboard.com/search/CollegeDetail.jsp?match=true&collegeId=3186&searchType=college&type=qfs&word=nyu" rel="nofollow">http://collegesearch.collegeboard.com/se...</a> <br>  Ya you have a chance as long as its not below a 3.0 and I dont think one C will kill you.  Good luck
QITDf0IEaa	Standard grades are pretty much useless. Only re-do them in intermediate 1 or 2 form if you REALLY MUST. You can only do 3 subjects per year at college (I think you may be able to do more if you take night classes - not sure) <br>  So, if you wanted to re-do ALL of them that could take like two years, which is probably not a good idea. I say re-do the important ones, and never mind the rest.<br>  2nd year of college do your highers (again only allowed 3 per year) <br>  .. so it is entirely your choice, have a think about it before making a quick decision: Is it a MUST to re-do Standard grades?<br>  <br>  Colleges that do highers:<br>  Anniesland<br>  Cardonald<br>  Langside<br>  Stow<br>  <br>  Edit: Right in that case, yes go ahead with doing int1/int2 then. choose your subjects wisely, depending on how many you need to do, you could be done with them within a year and then 2nd yr college do part of your highers! When you go for college interviews you will be given more expert advice too, so good luck =)

bd0cc3fbe67ad2d44e48d6ce0ebc9284aa	Depends on the quality of the high school...these days keystone and public schools will be viewed equally by colleges if you choose that route. Keystone allows you to move at your own pace and just might offer more variety in courses. We have a friend who received a full ride scholarship after graduating from Keystone and was also invited to interview with Harvard. Colleges look at grades, ranking, test scores and outside/volunteer activities.

W3bELVbmaa	Just out of curiosity, what did you used to do with him at lunchtimes which wasn't dodgy? If you want things to go back to normal, go back to the lessons or the lunchtimes where you obviously talked or did excess work or something, hun. You obviously have trust in him as a friend, but you should never have told him you liked him like you do like him - meaning you have a "crush" on him.<br>  It made things awkward because it would actually have been illegal for him to have said "yes, I like you too" or something along those lines, and so you saying it to him has put him in a bit of a sticky situation.<br>  When I was in year 11 - so I was 16, as I don't know if you're from England like me and will understand our school years - a girl aged 15 was having sex with one of the teachers in my school in his office after hours and at lunch times. When the school found out, he was fired, and when her 6 brothers found out, there was a big fight in the school grounds and the teacher in question left the city I live in and moved to Ireland! It can get out of hand like that, and while I know nothing like that happened, they may well have been all the things running through his head at the time - if someone else had found the card before him, he would have been susepeded pending an inquery. <br>  <br>  Just attempt to go back to normal, as he has told you to just forget it, did he not? If he wont let it drop, the only explanation I can think of is he likes you also and is frightened on how he feels, but I'm sure he would have made his feelings clear when he saw the card.<br>  <br>  We've all been there love; liking a teacher is a normal thing for most people to go through. Ive liked at least 3 of mine lol :).<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  x|`|8cN4e8Vmaa	I think you should fine friends to confide in. Or speak to people or ME on here not a teacher. You can get him in trouble and I'm sure if you care and respect him you wouldn't do that. Just keep things about school. I've never had a crush on a teacher but I think you should try to keep your arms distance. You don't have to be cold but be cool about things but remember that you go to him for educational purposes. K! Good luck...|`|tUu5N2vcaa	you should go to him and ask if you 2 can start all over, (getting to know each other)<br>  and cos his your teacher, you should tell him your problems cos that is what teachers are there for , to help you along the way.<br>  <br>  plus after you 2 start over your relationship will start over as well and there would be no tensions on you

czXaUPIlaa	The Buddha was not a "god-man." He was an ordinary human being, just like you and me. <br>  <br>  When he attained enlightenment, he did not become a god - in fact, in his enlightenment he realized just how much he was not like a god.<br>  <br>  After his enlightenment, the Buddha taught three things:<br>  <br>  1. The Four Noble Truths - that all of us experience profound dissatisfaction in life; that this dissatisfaction arises from our self-absorbed craving; that we can stop craving; and that there is a path to stop the craving.<br>  <br>  2. The Eightfold Path - (which is also the 4th Noble Truth) outlines the actions needed to put and end to craving and the dissatisfaction that accompanies it.<br>  <br>  3. The Middle Way - When we avoid both luxury and asceticism, our life can flourish.<br>  <br>  For more information on Buddha's basic teachings, see:<br>  <a href="http://buddhanet.net/e-learning/basic-guide.htm" rel="nofollow">http://buddhanet.net/e-learning/basic-gu...</a>|`|pevh5EiSaa	He was never a god , nor did he want to be revered as such.<br>  When asked what he was he replied "AWAKE"<br>  His teachings are know around the world as a way for everyone to rid themselves of suffering and the endless cycle of re-birth

To pierce with numerous holes; perforate: riddle a target with bullets. 2. To spread throughout: "Election campaigns have always been riddled with demagogy and worse" (New Republic). 3.

Y9Hm6fYWaa	It depends on what your major is. If you're a business major and you're planning to get your MBA, or if you're going to be a lawyer, going to an Ivy League school is going to give you a competitve edge with employers and might even open up jobs where the pay is over $100k. <br>  <br>  If you're going to be in a medical profession, like being a doctor or a nurse, it doesn't really matter where you go because everyone gets paid the same going in. In these and basically every other major, going to an Ivy League school is just like having a handbag with a designer on the label.<br>  <br>  I know this because I know lots of very successful people in LA and NYC, and the guys making tons of money in business went to prestigious schools, and the doctors and surgeons went to schools I've never heard of and are still getting a ridiculously high salary.|`|RbzOPtUHaa	if you go to an ivy league school it will show up in you're resume and you wil get WAY better jobs. they have better educations.

Ov5nCTUxaa	to get to uni you need a minimum of 3 a levels grades A toC. For oxford and cambridge 3 A levels all grade A.<br>  <br>  ambridge applicants are encouraged to study either four or five Advanced Subsidiary (AS) levels in Year 12. Applicants taking four subjects will not be disadvantaged compared with those taking five subjects. We would normally expect A grades in subjects which are particularly relevant to the course you are applying for. Separate certification at AS level in the case of subjects being taken at A2 is not a requirement and applicants not cashing in AS levels will not be disadvantaged. All applicants are asked to report (on a supplementary questionnaire) the results of all AS and A2 modules taken to date, whether certificated or not. Colleges will not make unconditional offers on the basis of AS level grades alone.<br>  <br>  A level offers<br>  Most conditional offers made by the Cambridge Colleges will require AAA in three A level subjects. For advice about suitable subject choices see course requirements. All Colleges modify offers to meet individual circumstances. For example, lower offers may be made to an applicant whose potential has not been realised at school for good reasons (see Cambridge Special Access Scheme), or to relieve a very good applicant of additional pressure. On the other hand, more challenging offers may be set to ensure that an applicant can cope with pressure and the demands of exams.|`|xywgBurHaa	Your Teacher will advise you, so take notice.|`|sN8aqb95aa	Instead of doing all the addictive things you normally do, just read books instead.

Q7lvSU03aa	Any program you do on your own is going to take a lot of self-discipline and perseverance.  My advice is to sign up for a class.  Look around in your area.  Check out community colleges, they often have reasonably priced classes.  Or if you can find someone who speaks the language you can ask them to tutor you one-on-one.<br>  <br>  It really depends on how you are going to use it.  If you will need to speak to Spanish speakers, learning conversational Spanish with other people is the easiest.  When I learned Spanish (which I did quickly), I took classes and then had several books that I practiced with at home.  I also would try to have as many conversations in Spanish as possible.  I watched Spanish tv, (starting with kid programming) and listened to Spanish music.  It is actually an easy language to learn if you immerse yourself as much as possible.<br>  <br>  If you have money the most effective way to learn quickly is Spanish language school.  In most Spanish speaking countries you can find them.  They offer room, board and 4 hours of classes a day meant to teach you as quickly as possible.  I took one in Guatemala and it helped tremendously.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|P1SdGAj3aa	Get a hispanic boyfriend/girlfriend!|`|bd5c7de49b15ec5ce776bd359797a407aa	Try this website:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mansionspanish.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.mansionspanish.com</a><br>  .|`|v4YCheYoaa	Try using TypeIt ReaIt (Text-To-Speech) with a Spanish voice.

Or he will say "oh great, let's go for it" in which case he is not the loving, good person you thought he was because any teacher who gets in a relationship with a student is violating school conduct codes and obviously not good at making decisions.<br>  <br>  My advice.  Wait until after you graduate, that way if he doesn't like you it won't matter because you will never see him again.  Also wait awhile.  See if after you stop seeing him every day if the feelings go away.  Go to college.  You will find tons of great guys there your age and your maturity level.  You are 18 - you have plenty of time in life to find that right person.|`|uWUSpzOsaa	just be careful because if he gets caught talking to you in a nonproffesional manner he will get fired

XmLJ84YBaa	You would need to have an understanding of both biology and chemistry. However, it also depends on what type of work you want to do in forensics. If you want to be a lab technician you would need to take more chemistry courses than just an introductory level course.

The people who never left town and see each other every week at PTA, soccer practice, poker night etc. are going to want to dance. The ones who DID leave town and flew 1,500 miles to attend are going to want to catch up, and they are not going to want to shout over the music.<br>  <br>  The ideal solution, if you can afford it, is to hire two rooms. Unless you are from Beverly Hills High, you won't be able to do that. Having the music "on" for 30 minutes, then off for 30 would be a reasonable compromise. Promise the DJ the same amount of money as if he played all night. Impress upon him the desire of half the audience to talk. Reunions are not the same as dances or concerts. People don't go to concerts to talk. They do go to reunions want to talk. Keep hammering that home to the DJ. If necessary, tattoo it on his forehead backwards and give him a mirror. Appoint a "Quiet time" monitor.<br>  <br>  Tell people at the start of the affair what you are doing, so they know. Tell them that you know half of them will be unhappy during the music and half will be unhappy during the quiet time, and you can't please everyone. If you like, you can tell the joke about the mathematician who had one foot in a bucket of ice water and the other in a bucket of boiling water. He said "If you take the average, I'm comfortable".<br>  <br>  I hear "It was a nice reunion, but the DJ ruined it" a dozen times a year from friends and family.

w4CISs9paa	Depending on your age and grade, I would say that is not the best thesis. It's a good start, but could be stronger. That looking at the thesis based on a collegiate level....<br>  Check out this website, we use it all the time in my English classes:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/545/01/" rel="nofollow">http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resour...</a>|`|1vZ1n0agaa	im not an english teacher...<br>  <br>  the glamour of eating disorders is a facade created by (the media, peer pressure) that is damaging to those affected because beneath the alluring veneer of a thin body are harmful factors that can destroy a person's (self-esteem, health, etc)<br>  <br>  actually that's more like a structure statement.|`|dkgTuPOQaa	clarify it and make sure it sounds more negative, because "factors" sound very neutral and boring. try " detrimental factors", or  something like that|`|qdWOwXBfaa	That's actually very good.<br>  <br>  Pardon me as i digress... I once wrote a short story on a girl in a mental institute who was there because she had developed bulimia. It wasn't all because she wanted to be pretty, she developed it to cope with the fact that her step dad sexually abused her.<br>  <br>  It is very common for bulimics to become the way they do to have control over their lives when things seem out of control. Interesting really.<br>  <br>  I say go for it, you'll get to do tons of psychology research.|`|caPv3cl1aa	I would leave it at "eating disorders aren't just about being thin and beautiful"<br>  <br>  Because you should have outlined the "many factors" preceding the thesis and this is what you will be arguing in the rest of the paper|`|N8DxgAD7aa	It is not a good thesis. Every complex problem always have many factors affecting the problem.|`|725bf4b951f0e2aaeadf4a433fe7129daa	Eating disorders can also make you fat.|`|wxil7JB8aa	it doesn't make sense. when you say "eating disorders aren't just about being thin and beautiful" this implies that eating disorders WILL make you thin and beautiful and that's not the only point. but eating disorders won't make you thin and beautiful. so if you really want to keep that part, at least get rid of the word just. but the part before the comma does not go along with the part after the comma. i'd need to read your whole essay to see what you are trying to prove and what the factors are.|`|hjDZmXAQaa	From a grammatical standpoint, it doesn't work.  It needs to be 2 sentences.  Or you need to change it so that it's parallel: Eating disorders aren't just about (who?) being thin and beautiful, they are . . . etc.<br>  <br>  I think it's hard to say what your teacher will think, because I don't know the scope of the assignment.  But at first glance, it seems a bit general--could be more specific.  What is the main thing you hope to prove or show?  Why is it important that many factors contribute to eating disorders?  If you show the significance, it will give you a stronger thesis.
rlKZ40fZaa	Yes, Peter, it is a grammatical sentence.<br>  <br>  Here is why:<br>  <br>  A sentence requires a subject, verb, and a complete thought.<br>  <br>  Subject=It<br>  <br>  Verb=depends<br>  <br>  And this is a complete thought. Therefore, it is a complete sentence.<br>  <br>  The rest of the sentence are just modifiers:<br>  <br>  on the standard=prepositional phrase<br>  the standard=object of preposition<br>  <br>  (which) you use=relative clause. Describes the noun standard<br>  <br>  to measure these thing=infinitive phrase.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you need further help, there are plenty of straightforward, on-line learning centers which help you with this.|`|E7VFHwSKaa	Correct!|`|sJwV1QiJaa	yepp, it's correct.|`|AA11202852	Yes, you've structured it correctly.|`|1K0fXxMbaa	It looks fine to me.
qVz1Ch6eaa	No.  Colleges don't want to think that you'll spend the next four years partying, and the fact that you're writing about the effects of a drug implies that you've tried it.  Never tell a college that you've done something illegal unless you have a record of it.  They wont want to bring in anyone who will reflect badly on the school.
AtDwsmjqaa	That's a shame. :(<br>  <br>  If she is talking on the subject, it might be necessary or she might not know that the students are understanding so she keeps going to make sure everyone 'gets it' and then just goes on too long.  Maybe she's new and doesn't realize she's doing it or maybe old and enjoys just "telling" all she knows.<br>  <br>  If it's off topic, maybe you could raise your hand and say, I don't get ... whatever the subject is about, or can we go back to the ______ (topic necessary to get back on track).  I've been in classes where a student raised his hand and said, can we get back to reading and the teacher agreed and said yes, that's a good idea.<br>  <br>  I don't know which would be best since I'm not there, but if you're in high school, you could try working on whatever the homework is while she's off topic, she prolly won't notice anyway, LOL.|`|TanAU2aAaa	Leave a note on her desk and say POLITELY "you sometimes talk a lot and we would enjoy it if you let us complete our assignments. how about you do slide show presentations instead?|`|T7AxIHFhaa	If your teacher is teaching and talking about the subject, it is good and important to know more information from her. If your teacher is not teaching and might talking about other stuff (out of topic), yes it is annoying to talk too much. Well, I guess you better do assignments for homework. <br>  <br>  Don't take my silly idea, but if you want. Wear earplugs or earphones to listen music and ignore your teacher while you're doing your assignments. hehe.|`|Jteqao3zaa	lol, everyone has had one of those.  take advantage of the down time.  we used to ask ours questions about things we knew she would go on and on about, just so that we didn't have to do any actual learning.   lol lol lol.  she was a nice lady.|`|vriyg1cJaa	Yea, we all have had teachers like this.

SIhxrxD3aa	You aren't eligible for a Pell Grant, not because of your EFC, but because you're going to grad school.  Pell Grants, and most of the other grants are only for undergraduate students.  You will be offered loan money.  Graduate students can borrow $20,000/year through the stafford loan program.  You should also look into graduate being a graduate assistant, where they pay your tuition in exchange for teaching classes and doing research.<br>  <br>  No.  Stafford loans are not credit based.  There is no credit check and no co-signer required.  However, you can't get one if you are currently in default on a previous student loan.

45680adb63e7fda355291c38d3b4ac04aa	Always have references. Even if it is on opinion, always try to be educated on the subject.<br>  Here are some tips:<br>  - One of the easiest forms of essays to write is the 5 paragraph essay. Have a topic paragraph, 3 body paragraphs, and a conclusion paragraph.<br>     - The topic paragraph should include your thesis, which is what you are trying to tell the reader, and should categorize it into 3 categories. Those will become your body paragraphs.<br>     - In the body of the essay, try to always have at least 1 fact, and then explain it. You can have more, but always explain them.<br>     - The conclusion should wrap up the essay. It shouldn't be the thesis statement exactly, but restate it.<br>  - When you use someone else's information, you don't have to quote them. Just be sure you reference whoever had the info. For example:<br>  "The CDC did a research on obesity that shows..."<br>  Although I never directly quoted the CDC, I did tell you they did the research.<br>  - If you are writing an opinion essay, than all of the essay will be your opinion somehow.<br>  - When you form the opinion, it doesn't just have to be For/Against, or anything as black and white as that. If they just told you to write about Obesity in America, you can write about if its an epidemic, how can people change, and stuff like that. <br>  - If you writer's block, and you have don't have to worry about running out of paper, just write. Someone I know told me this, and it works. Just write whatever comes to mind, no matter how stupid. Its a simple way to get rid writer's block.<br>  - Most important of all, DON'T STRESS! When you take a test, you will stress about writing. When you finish, you'll find out that it wasn't as bad as you thought it was. <br>  <br>  Hope these tips could help you, and I'm sure you'll do fine on the essay.|`|ov3Nyk21aa	i think you should start like<br>  <br>  OBESITY IN AMERICA<br>  Obesity in America is a very common thing ? out of ? people suffer from it<br>  ??% of people will have it cause of genetics while ??% will get it from eating disorders,pregnancy craving and ............<br>  you know stufff like that<br>  <br>  (also if its an essay you SHOULD add your personal opinions and stuff  but blend it in so it fits with the essay)<br>  <br>  also if you have any questions about lets say the % of people who suffer from it then you should google it<br>  <br>  (hope i helped)|`|YS4752geaa	i learned in school this thing its called t.i.c<br>  T is for text reffernce do some reach from the inernet<br>  I is for inffence u write what u think about the text reffernce<br>  C is for connections connect to somthing in ur life or book or any think if u do like three u'll have it done in no time|`|QVpmxzFraa	In my own opinion writing my opinion is very easy. Even if you have no idea what you think of the topic just make up what makes the most sense because its just your opinion. To a get good grade on an EASY include your opinion. factual facts. what the causes are for obesity. and more. <br>  <br>  if you run out of things to say just talk about your opinion. <br>  As obesity is one of the leading preventable causes of death worldwide and with rates of adult and childhood obesity increasing, authorities view it as one of the most serious public health problem of the 21st century.[5] Obesity is often stigmatized in the modern Western world. However, it has been perceived as a symbol of wealth and fertility at other times in history and still is in many parts of Africa<br>  heres some research.<br>  <br>  also talk about exercising|`|yJCLcFVwaa	This is one of the many problems we have going on in the world today. The schools are trying to play their part in this problem, by having better lunches with lower calorie items on the menu.  Some schools are adding exercising in some of the classes.  I think you can come up with alot of ideas and i'd just mainly go by that and not use quotes from other people.  Young people will be less obese if they realize that this can affect their life ahead of them.  As obesity has created alot of health problems but if caught early and something done about, they can have a healthier life.

r5Mxre6Saa	It's the belief that concepts, or ideas, such as good and bad, or right and wrong, are not 'absolute' (or written in stone).  That they change from culture to culture, and situation to situation.

(It's all relative!)|`|45680adb63e7fda355291c38d3b4ac04aa	Everything isn't the same to everyone. Different experiences cause us to view the same thing in different ways.

qJKixTzbaa	you mean the book i hope so lol<br>  The Broken Commandment is a Japanese novel written by Tōson Shimazaki (島崎藤村)　published in 1906 (late Meiji period) under the title Hakai (破戒, Hakai) The Broken Commandment. The novel deals with the burakumin, formerly known as eta. This book enjoyed great popularity and influence in Japan.The basic plot concerns a school teacher named Ushimatsu Segawa (family name written last) who struggles with a commandment given to him by his father. He is never to reveal his eta background, which his father had tried so hard to conceal as well. Ushimatsu idolizes Rentarou Inoko, a burakumin rights' activist and successful writer (particularly considering the social position given to those considered burakumin). Ushimatsu wishes to reveal his background to Rentarou, as his need to hide away part of himself in order to be accepted by society in general leads to his feeling constricted by this superficial identity, and to his desiring to form a more meaningful connection with Rentarou through their common experience.
xJoMSkI5aa	No. Romeo doesn’t seem to grow up that much in the course of the play. He does show restraint when Tybalt challenges him, which is a big deal, since Romeo damages his reputation when he refuses to fight. But Romeo is just as emotional at the end as at the beginning.

Both the Friar and the Nurse have to yell at him to stop crying and start acting like an adult.<br>  <br>  From Shmoop/Romeo and Juliet|`|Cm7MQrhiaa	Yes Romeo is a tragic hero. The reason is because he tried to save his dearest Juliet and he took his own life for the sake of her .|`|iP863XM6aa	Well, it pretty much just asks if Romeo is a hero or not. Its probably more of an opinion question cause some people could say yes, while others would say no.

AA10176626	ruffcoin:<br>  <br>  The scholarships are out there, and to a certain extent, the internet is a great medium for communicating their availability to potential applicants. If I've put together a scholarship fund, my goal, theoretically, is to get the word out - and attract a solid pool of applicants. In this day and age, the internet is an effective tool for publicizing scholarship programs.<br>  <br>  However - as a scholarship applicant, widely publicized scholarship programs might not be the most attractive competitions for me to apply for. The more widely known the program, the greater the competition, and the less the chance that I might be selected.<br>  <br>  If my grades are phenomenal, and I've got a "lot going on", I probably don't care. I know my academics and my test scores and my community service and my letters of recommendation and my essay writing skills are going to win me just about any scholarship I apply for. <br>  <br>  On the other hand, if I'm a little more average than all of that, I'm probably not going to be one of the 10 winners chosen from a mega application pool of 28,000 applicants.<br>  <br>  In that case - I'm looking for smaller scholarship programs - maybe programs that have application limitations. If my dad works for IBM, I'd try to find out if IBM has any special scholarship programs for the dependents of employees. If my mom is active at the local church or synagogue, I might want to check with the minister or rabbi, to see if there are any scholarships from that angle. If I'm interested in studying architecture in college, I'd spend time at the website of the big membership organizations, looking for programs that help promising young architects-to-be.<br>  <br>  I'd also make an appointment with my guidance counselor at school. These people are great college resources, and very few students take advantage of it, because counselors aren't always the most popular staff members at the school. "Man! You have to go see the counselor? Bummer."<br>  <br>  Guidance counselors know the local scholarships, and they know of scholarships that other students from your school have had success with in the past. They also have big, thick books of scholarship programs - many of which don't get the big online publicity campaign.<br>  <br>  You can certainly look through the fastwebs, and all of the similar mass compendiums, but just remember two things - you're not just signing up for scholarships - you're signing up for "informative offers" from fastweb's advertising partners. Plus - as I suggested earlier, it's the rare fastweb scholarship that doesn't receive a gazillion applications.<br>  <br>  Good luck - I hope this helped.|`|7ae938d47fa5ab107ff81fe42738c6a4aa	Try these web searches:<br>      * www.aauw.org<br>      * www.bibl.u-szeged.hu/oseas/europe.html<br>      * www.cashe.com<br>      * www.collegeboard.com/highered<br>      * www.CollegeIsPossible.org<br>      * www.collegenet.com<br>      * www.collegeview.com<br>      * www.ecollegebid.com<br>      * www.edupass.org<br>      * www.embark.com<br>      * www.fastweb.com<br>      * www.feea.org<br>      * www.finaid.org<br>      * www.gmsp.org<br>      * www.gocollege.com<br>      * www.hispanicfund.org<br>      * www.IEFA.org<br>      * www.iefc.com<br>      * www.iie.org/fulbright<br>      * www.jackkentcookefoundation.org<br>      * www.macfdn.org<br>      * www.mapping-your-future.org<br>      * www.nafsa.org<br>      * www.nextstudent.com<br>      * www.petersons.com<br>      * www.scholarshiphunter.com<br>      * www.thesalliemaefund.org<br>      * www.usjournal.com<br>      * www.yahoo.com/Education/Financial_Aid<br>      * www.ymf.org/programs/scholarship.php|`|t5rol0y6aa	You can find good information, but be sure to NEVER pay anyone for on-line scholarship info.

xGmbEzOZaa	Generally speaking, most of the more common engineering majors make around the same salary. The difference in salary is usually within a few thousands dollars, which is not that much different when considered on a whole. However, where I live, electrical and computer engineers make the most. <br>  <br>  You can expect to make 45,000 USD with only a bachelor's degree, however, your salary can raise if you obtain a higher degree and earn experience in your field. A bachelor's degree in engineering usually takes four or five years to complete. A master's usually can be completed in two years. A doctorate degree can take up to seven years to complete (depending on how fast you can complete a thesis paper).|`|Moz2d806aa	Chemical engineers make the most (greatest shortage). The average starting salary this year was around 63k/year. Most other engineers make around the same (around 57k/year). It is typically around 4 years, but often takes 5. After getting some experience, you will make a lot more, especially if you go back for grad school.

f5f2cbaa7f2dc242e7b6f95e3a1514daaa	Depending on when you are taking the SAT you should start preparing for them. For example if you take PSAT you'll have an understanding in which areas you most need work on, it is recommended. How ? Well if you score well on the PSAT's you need not study much, however if you aren't satisfied with your score on it, keep studying the problems you had most problems with, for example me it was probability problems, so I studied those until I had dreams of them [just kidding, :D]. Now the SAT's don't change much year to year so this is a good way to prepare. In the books from the companies below, there are practice tests that have been actual SAT test in the past, great way to prepare. <br>  <br>  These are good websites you should consider looking into, referred to me by a friend : <br>  www.collegeboard.com<br>  <a href="http://satests.brinkster.net/" rel="nofollow">http://satests.brinkster.net/</a><br>  <br>  Best said books are from these companies : <br>  Kaplan <br>  Princeton Review <br>  College Board <br>  <br>  Good luck! =]|`|AA11480264	well if you have taking the psat a class would really help a kid in my school got a 240 which is 2400 in sat form.

Because they sounded cool, fun, interesting, and I wanted to learn more.<br>  <br>  As for Japanese, if you want to learn it, go ahead and take classes in it. I have to point out that it is a phenomenally difficult language to learn, and even if you study it for years you might never get to be fluent. From what I know of the way it's taught, it's going to be a lot of work, a lot of memorization and practice. Your major sounds difficult enough and work-intensive enough that you might now want to commit yourself to something that takes as much effort as Japanese.

12VQ4ETcaa	Off campus is cheaper.  On campus is probably better to meet people, though most colleges have nearby apartment complexes that are completely full of students.  (Nobody who isn't a student would want to rent there!)<br>  <br>  The best part about living on campus was that everything was so close.  I lived in the dorms for one year, and I was always in the rec center or the library.  It was great never having to cook or do housework.  The negatives were living between the stairwell and the bathrooms, so I was always getting woken up, and on the last night I was there I saw a really huge cockroach.<br>  <br>  The best parts about living off campus were having more space and saving money.  The bad parts were having to take the bus 45 minutes to get to class and having to do regular housework, cooking, and grocery shopping along with all the homework.  When I left campus I gained a bunch of weight, too.|`|Jteqao3zaa	i don't know about cheaper cuz it depends on the area, and the school.  as far as meeting people the dorms are a better bet.  but..... living in a dorm SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!  it is sooooo much niocer to have your own apartmant, no RA, no rules, no annoying people driving you crazy, plus you don't have to move all your crap every summer.  you can have the best parties, you have more privacy, you are in charge,   get your own apartment.  if you want to meet people join a club or something.|`|Q56v2Kt9aa	With the economy the way it is now, it is of course cheaper to live at home, but living on campus certainly has its benefits.  I mean if you have friends and they wanna go out to a restaurant late at night who wants to drive all the way out to where you go to school.  Also if you want a traditional college feel then by all means live on campus.  Living on campus will allow you to be wayyy more independent and live your own life and escape your town, family, etc.  For me I love it!  But you have to also evaluate what type of person you are.  If you get home sick easy then don't live on campus.  But for the most part the independence is the greatest thing.  You'll have to learn how to shop for yourself, figure out what you need to buy, budget, etc.  So really it all depends on how you want to live while attending college.  I really didn't let money play a factor in my decision. good luck!!|`|fSkt7SgDaa	Living on campus is usually a decent price but there is cheaper places off campus.

AA12095483	Out sourcing means going outside of the company to obtain goods or services that might normally be obtained inside the company. For example, if you worked in a print shop where labels were designed, and an order came in for a paticular kind of label that used letters from another language (just for the sake of argument we'll make it a very obscure and little known language), instead of having it done in house by the staff artists who would usually do this kind of job, it might be outsourced to the country where that language was commonly spoken - both to ensure accuracy and to tap into local market appeal. <br>  Outsourcing is something that Chinese manufacturers rarely do, which is why you get instructions written in highly entertaining English....

zgTsCicNaa	The Richmond-Petersburg Campaign was a series of battles around Petersburg, Virginia, fought from June 9, 1864, to March 25, 1865, during the American Civil War. Although it is more popularly known as the Siege of Petersburg, it was not a classic military siege, in which a city is usually surrounded and all supply lines are cut off. It was nine months of trench warfare in which Union forces commanded by Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant assaulted Petersburg unsuccessfully and then constructed trench lines that eventually extended over 30 miles around the eastern and southern outskirts of the city. Petersburg was crucial to the supply of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee's army and the Confederate capital of Richmond.<br>  <br>  Lee finally yielded to the overwhelming pressure—the point at which supply lines were finally cut and a true siege would have begun—and abandoned both cities in April 1865, leading to his retreat and surrender in the Appomattox Campaign. The Siege of Petersburg foreshadowed the trench warfare that would be common in World War I, earning it a prominent position in military history. It also featured the largest concentration of African American troops employed in the war, who suffered heavy casualties at such engagements as the Battle of the Crater and Chaffin's Farm.<br>  <br>  Marching from Cold Harbor, Meade’s Army of the Potomac crossed the James River on transports and a 2,200-foot long pontoon bridge at Windmill Point. Butler’s leading elements (XVIII Corps and Kautz’s cavalry) crossed the Appomattox River at Broadway Landing and attacked the Petersburg defenses on June 15. The 5,400 defenders of Petersburg under command of Gen. P.G.T. Beauregard were driven from their first line of entrenchments back to Harrison Creek. After dark the XVIII Corps was relieved by the II Corps. On June 16, the II Corps captured another section of the Confederate line; on the 17th, the IX Corps gained more ground. Beauregard stripped the Howlett Line (Bermuda Hundred) to defend the city, and Lee rushed reinforcements to Petersburg from the Army of Northern Virginia. The II, XI, and V Corps from right to left attacked on June 18 but was repulsed with heavy casualties. By now the Confederate works were heavily manned and the greatest opportunity to capture Petersburg without a siege was lost. The siege of Petersburg began. Union Gen. James St. Clair Morton, chief engineer of the IX Corps, was killed on June 17. <br>  <br>  ?

SlPncQjcaa	Wow.  I'm sorry to hear that.  That has happened to me before as well.  Are you a high school student?  Many high school teachers, rather than just admit to having made a mistake, will sometimes make you seem like the one at fault.  Do you have another copy of the assignment somewhere like a computer or disk, or another copy of the handwritten one?  I ALWAYS made sure I did for each assignment.  It sounds crazy, but I had too many teachers like this one try to play games with my grades. I had a physics teacher like that who insisted on accusing me, and others, of lying about turning in assignments to take attention away from the fact that the homework wasn't really completed in the first place (even though it was).  If this teacher really insists on not giving you a grade for an assignment worth that much after you claim you did it (try talking to him once more before seeking other options) talk with your parents or guardians to schedule some sort of meeting or conference or a counselor or another administrator.  It sounds like a lot, but you cannot let some teacher screw with your grades and future.  Trust me, I've had some before.  You need to bring light to the fact that he is trying to give you a failing grade for an assignment he very well may have lost, and you deserve another opportunity.  If you bring the issue up and discuss it with him, a parent, and another administrator, it shows you're serious because the fact of the matter is you wouldn't cook-up this scheme over an assignment you were too lazy to do.  Try to negotiate with him and see if he will give you another assignment of equal difficutly or maybe even a more difficult one (work with him...anything to get you the grade!)  He cannot just fail you for something you allegedly did and he allegedly lost.  I believe that he lost it 100% because I've had teachers like this, and you have to let someone in a higher position know about it if it threatens your grade. You have to work something out.  Don't let him get away with it because of his mistake! Especially not if you're in high school! Don't let him screw up your GPA because he refuses to admit he was wrong! GOOD LUCK!|`|SSJid9dUaa	If u actually did it. simply explain ur situation thoroughly..<br>  dont u have it saved on ur computer? try sending it again.<br>  If not talk to people in higher posotions than ur teacher. ur grades shudnt suffer bcz of his mistake.|`|ENYkIOPDaa	If you have to do it again make sure you type it out, save it on your computer or keep a copy just incase that happens again|`|LmFGYK7laa	sorry but HAHAHA thats really funny lol how could a teacher lose an assignment ??|`|QGrnEIETaa	Why don't you get proof from your parents to say that you truly did this homework so your teacher could give you another chance to do it?

It was excessive.  <br>  <br>  Here are some reasons for why parents should be responsible:<br>  1.  This is a very personal area.  Some parents may want to approach topics in different ways.  For example schools do not teach abstinence, at least mine didn't.  Parents may want to focus more on that.<br>  2.  Teaching about sex can be a bonding time for parents and children.  It lets parents show their kids that they know they are growing up.<br>  3.  When schools teach sex ed, parents think, "oh now I don't have to."  I would almost guarantee that less parents talk to their kids about sex when the school does it already.<br>  4.  Sex education is more than just teaching a kid how to do it.  It is something that should be talked about repeatedly and applied to situations as they occur in a child's life.  Only a parent is in the position to do that.<br>  <br>  Maybe I should come give your speech for you.  j/k<br>  Good luck

gsxdwkGVaa	you need to find a common denominator (bottom number).  first, get rid of the whole numbers.  To do this, you need to multiply the whole number by the denominator and add it to the numerator (top number).  This will get you:<br>  <br>  8 x 2 = 16 + 5 = 21 ---> 21/8<br>  6 x 4 = 24 + 3 = 27 ---> 27/4<br>  <br>  You then need to find the common denominator.  To do this, find the lowest multiple both four and eight go into.  That would be eight.  So the only one that needs to be changed is the four.  You need to multiply it by 2:<br>  <br>  (27/4) x 2 = (27 x 2) / (4 x 2) = 54 / 8.<br>  <br>  Now just add:<br>  <br>  (54/8) + (21/8) = 75/8<br>  <br>  to change this back to a fraction with a whole number:<br>  <br>  8 x 9 = 72<br>  75-72 = 3<br>  <br>  = 9 3/8<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|O49jBZsxaa	the answer would be 9 3/8<br>  you would change the 4 to an 8 then multiply the 3 by 2 to get 6 it would now be 2 5/8 + 6 6/8 then you would add them and get 9 3/8|`|up6I8etaaa	9 3/8<br>  <br>  You make it so that it's 2 5/8 + 6 6/8 (Common denomenators)<br>  <br>  You just multiply both sides of the 3/4 by 2.<br>  <br>  Then, you add the 2 and 6 = 8, and the 5/8 + 6/8 = 11/8<br>  <br>  8 + 11/8 = 9 3/8<br>  <br>  Hope this helped!|`|WydUeuDkaa	first you need to find the lowest common denominator for 8 and 4 any lowest number that both of the numbers have in common you can see the time tables like 4 times 1=4 and 4 times 2=8 and so on until you find one in common and it should be 16 because 4 times 4 = 16 and 8times 2 is 16 so then you multiply the fraction 5/8 both by 2 and you get 10/16 don't forget to put the 2 10/16 and so on for the other fraction let me know if you have a question|`|lI0UsOpyaa	3/4 = 6/8 (you mutiply both top and bottom by 2) <br>  so now its 2 5/8 + 6 6/8. <br>  so add 2 and 6 is 8<br>  and 5/8 + 6/8 = 11/8. <br>  since 8/8 is one, 11/8 is 1 3/8.

Murder is a deliberate and generally malicious act - killing has a much wider definition that can _include_ murder, but also includes manslaughter, self-defense, accidental death, death by inanimate object (the fall killed him - he wasn't murdered, falling off a cliff in no way allows for the use of the word murder unless someone pushed you), etc.<br>  <br>  People also rarely use the word murder to describe animals hunting.

kHRK66Mwaa	To be honest, I feel getting a degree in a certain "Major" is over rated. As long as you get a diploma (BS or BA), work hard and do some networking before you graduate, you will have an excellent chance at being successful. <br>  <br>  I graduated from UC Irvine in Social Sciences and have a pretty high paying position working with Berkshire Hathaway. While being an undergrad, I did alot of internships while also taking classes and studying. I met alot of people and was able to build a social network of business associates. They were able to refer me to their friends, so I could show off my skills and knowledge. This helps open up alot of doors and options, by knowing the right people. Working as an intern helps demonstrate to potential employers how well you can do the job. Key is to start early. Don't wait till you graduate or your senior year.<br>  <br>  So as for what Major you should select? I say, pick the one that interest you the most. If you want to stand out, be dynamic and not worry (as much) on the type of study you plan for college. <br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  <br>  -
hjDZmXAQaa	I write the word in very large bold letters, and take a sliding piece of paper or cue card to cover up all but the first syllable; once the student has sounded out the first syllable, I slide the card over to reveal the next syllable.<br>  <br>  With some kids, I think they see the whole word at once and have trouble breaking it into parts, so they either make a stab at it based on a few letters, or they give up.<br>  <br>  Another technique is to take flash cards of the different letter combinations and say the sound while the student looks for the matching card.
EkhEvfXFaa	Well the normal formula for speed is speed = distance traveled / Time taken<br>  <br>  For your formula:<br>  <br>  distance traveled = stride length (measured in say ft or m)<br>  <br>  But for your formula Time Taken = 1/stride frequency<br>  <br>  So the formula you want is speed = stride length x stride frequency  where the stride frequency is measured in, for example, strides/min.<br>  <br>  This will give you the speed in ft/min or m/min depending on the units in which you measured the stride length.<br>  <br>  Bonus rave only if you want to read it:<br>  <br>  The time can be changed to suit what ever you want seconds, minutes or hours but it's easier to count the number of strides per minute than it is to count the number of strides per second or per hour.  <br>  <br>  But you can scale it anyway you like for example 60 strides per minute is the same as 60 x 60 = 3600 strides per hour or 60/60 = 1 stride per second so it doesn't really matter.

Ic6Fyszgaa	Yes, you could possibly save money by going to a community college (CC) before transferring to a 4-year university.  The tuition at a CC is generally more affordable than at a 4-year university.  Also, while at the CC, talk to your adviser and let them know what your intentions are. They can help you select the right classes that will fulfill your General Education requirements for your bachelor's degree.  Be sure to tell your adviser which school you intend to transfer to, to ensure you are selecting the right classes that will transfer back to the 4-year university.  <br>  <br>  No, it's not very difficult to transfer from a CC to a 4-year university.  Again, just make sure you are taking courses that will transfer back to the 4-year university towards your bachelor's degree.  Also, make sure the CC is an accredited institution your 4-year university will accept transfer credit from.   <br>  <br>  Best wishes!|`|gtINkA19aa	No I don't think so, but it is easier to get into a university that way.

mNIUhIQnaa	Honors Biology is pretty difficult class, so you should be somewhat pleased you're making B's thus far. Mitosis and Meiosis have plenty of vocabulary and concepts to understand. Memorizing these will give you a good foundation to make a B. To get an A, try to infer ideas about meiosis and mitosis that may not be presented in the text (implications of crossing over, length of phases, number of chromosomes at each step). In college level biology courses, which are somewhat like honors biology, you'll find studying in groups is very helpful. Talking out biology allows you to understand it better. Also, ask each other questions--try to stump one another. <br>  <br>  Other than that, specific details for a meiosis/mitosis test WILL include where the differences lie, what kind of organisms do what, where crossing over occurs, length of phases, advantages and disadvantages of each. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|P9TZh27xaa	that's probably due to <br>  a) lack of sleep, you may have take too much time studying<br>  b)horsing around, observe your actions, do you go on the computer and answer yahoo answers questions every day(lol) and wastte time?<br>  c) don't understand material, get a tutor, go to tutorials or read your material more carefully<br>  <br>  <br>  hoped i helped!!!

Both light and heat are types of radiation  energy (rays... get it?) The sun is round, meaning the far side isn't facing us but rays shoot out in all dirrectsions.<br>  <br>  3. Sugar and Starch are made of carbons. Again, all these nutrients have to come from the air, water or dirt...<br>  <br>  4. and 5. are related. The plant stores energy in a seed to get it started, since they are small it has to be compact...<br>  <br>  6. I haven't seen any huge holes growing under trees... and water only has hydrogen and oxygen. Air has CO2 though....

Reality basically means "the existent universe."  In a simple sense, they seem to have nothing in common.  But I would say that, on a deeper level, they have a connection, in that to be reckless means to act without judgement, or at least without concern for the results of ones actions.  In much the same way, we could say that reality also "acts without judgement," in the sense that reality simply _is_--it does not plan or think about consequences, and instead goes continuously and inevitably rolling forward through time.

So if you are upset, you may probably cry and if you are angry you may probably shout or frown. <br>  <br>  <br>  Other people can see what emotions you are having that day, simply by looking at you. You tend not to keep your emotions to yourself.<br>  <br>  <br>  It doesn't necessarily mean love ( even though younger people tend to believe it does).  But if you wear your heart on your sleeve- you are likely to be open in the fact  that you love someone and if they leave you-  you may be openly devasted or distraught. Needing a lot of consolation and support, from others ( teachers, friends, family , counsellors).<br>  <br>  <br>  Someone who wears their heart on their sleeve may be described as emotional, sensitive, responsive, melodramatic or histrionic. <br>  <br>  It is not necessarily a bad thing, but as you get older, people will expect you to be able to control some of your emotions and keep certain feelings or moods, more private. <br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps you.|`|AA12361379	The person shows their emotions very openly and is easily hurt.|`|ceebbd5b347bf3b3c44701e742d76f97aa	That a person is very showy with their emotions<br>  Without guile<br>  What you see is what you get<br>   It is the oppocite of playing your cards close to the vest|`|YMI6Yl18aa	It's a metaphor used to describe a person who displays their emotions to the world.

Then you also, once you've declared your major, have to fulfill your major requirements (take a certain number of courses in that subject).<br>  <br>  Brown University (another school you won't get into unless you improve your writing) is famous for not having a core curriculum, so you can take whatever courses you want as long as you fulfill your major requirements.<br>  <br>  At any school (except trade schools), you can do "everything," but you end up taking more courses in your major.
EkhEvfXFaa	Let number of adult tickets = x<br>  <br>  Let number of student tickets = y<br>  <br>  5x + 3.5y = 1615 [eqn 1]  [This is the price equation]<br>  <br>  x + y = 410  [This is the number of tickets purchased equation]<br>  <br>  y = 410 - x [eqn 2]<br>  <br>  Subs [eqn 2] into [eqn 1] → 5x + 3.5(410 - x) = 1615<br>  <br>  5x + 1435 - 3.5x = 1615<br>  <br>  1.5x = 180<br>  <br>  x = 120<br>  <br>  So 120 adult tickets were sold<br>  <br>  <br>  Note: we had to find the number of adult tickets, so I eliminated the y variable so that I just had to solve for x.
2gstVBcMaa	I mean really??  if you can't go a school day without a cell phone that is not a good thing.  That is called addiction!  And yes, because i said so is a good reason.  Obviously from you question you were supposed to be in class or at least on your way to class.  And just FYI...in college most professors don't want phones in class either, and i have actually seen them tell students not to bother to come back to class after they forgot to turn off their phone...and yes, they can do that.  And there are quite a few jobs out there that do not allow the used of cell phones while in the building or during work hours.  So...i guess i would have said to you....Its life..deal with it!|`|4MYWPD9Yaa	It's legitimate in the sense that you still have to obey the rule, but there is probably another actual reason that he isn't telling you, either because he doesn't know or because it takes too long to explain at that moment.<br>  <br>  I could probably think of a dozen reasons why cell phones aren't allowed at school, but if you really want to know, then ask.<br>  <br>  BAD WAY TO ASK:<br>  Pull out your cell phone when you aren't supposed to and start gabbing on it loudly. When the vice principal or teacher tells you to put it away, put your hand over the phone and say "Why? Why should I?"<br>  <br>  GOOD WAY TO ASK:<br>  After school is over, ask the vice principal nicely if he has time to talk over the cell phone policy at school with you. When you have time to chat, ask when the cell phone policy was put in place and what all the considerations were that went into making that policy. Then propose some reasonable changes you might make to that policy that still takes those considerations into account.|`|U2KdP1y7aa	It's not a nice way to answer somebody. It actually sounds very childish. I couldn't respect somebody that talked to me like that, especially when that behavior comes from an adult.|`|7935ef9a4a36c41bdd69d652ae386308aa	Only if you learn the spelling of legitimate.|`|lweUU95waa	Grow up and learn to spell.|`|fFqzD3aMaa	It's a cop out, get used to it.
