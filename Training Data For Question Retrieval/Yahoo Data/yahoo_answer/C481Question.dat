20090202165849AAVP5nU	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Infectious Diseases	Are these the symptoms of a UTI?	I have this feeling like I have to urinate constantly. When I'm almost done peeing, my bladder has the discomfort feeling like its being pressured, almost like I have to go again. It doesn't burn that bad when I urinate. My urine isn't an odd color. There is a strong smell though. I'm not in terrible pain. I can't hold it for long at all, nor do I try to though because I know it's really bad for your bladder to keep it in for awhile. After I drink just a little bit, I have to go almost immediately. Please help. Any answers are greatly appreciated:)

In school I always would blow tons of money on stuff not because I truly wanted it but because the cool kids had it and I wanted to be like them (from hairstyle to abercrombie clothes to doc martens, etc.) then whenever I got past that in college I wanted to be like this person or  that person so I would not only try to emulate them but to almost clone them within myself. For example,. I might try and act just like that person and look like that person and everything like that. I jsut have kept doing it, hoping one would work. If it wasn't the perfect preppy it was the rebel if it wasn't that then it was ____ if it wasn't that then it was ______. I have finally realized it. The question I have and need advice for is how do I stop? How do I really become my own self?

20090202181246AAd0Fb4	Health;General Health Care;Pain & Pain Management	Should I file a complaint against this Nurse Practitioner or Dr's office?	Here's a little background:   I have a pinched nerve that comes and goes- about 2xs a year. The first time it happened, I had an MRI, and went to a new local Dr. (recommended by my orthopaedist ) because I was in so much pain and my orthopeadist appt wan't for a few more days.       The local Dr. gave me some painkillers to hold me over, and when I finally got to see the orthopaedist, he me that all I needed was a good chiropractor. He was right, and with the prescribed painkillers and a few chiropractor visits, I was almost back to normal in 2 weeks.       The same pain has come back since then, but I've been able to suffer  through it without painkillers, and just a few chiro visits and lots of yoga and advil.      This time, I tried to do the yoga/chiro/advil treatment for 2 weeks and it just got worse. I went back to the local Dr., who gave me some kind of shot that did nothing. The next day he gave me an Rx for 4 days worth of Percocet, which I used up in 4 days, and went back to the Dr. on the 4th day thinking that there was something else that he could give- another kind of shot, or maybe I needed to see a specialist, I wasn't sure what to do.       The original Dr. wasn't in, so I saw his nurse practicioner. The pain was so intense, that by the time I got to the office I was in tears. The nurse practicioner (whom I've never met) was extremely rude, degrading, and clearly thought I was some kind of junkie making the whole thing up.       He made me do stupid little 'simon says' games for way too long. When I asked if I could lay down for a minute to take the pressure of the nerve, he said no.    When I told him I was scared that the Rx and chiro visits didn't help help me as much as they did last time, he ignored me.   Then he asked for the name of the pharmacy where I get my meds filled, and any other doctor I see for pain.    I explained that this was the only office that I had been to for my pain, and the pharmacy was either CVS or Walgreens, I wasn't sure.       He left, and came back into the room about 15 minutes later, and repeated the same questions, and I gave him the same answers.       I told him that it was obvious that he didn't believe me, and that I am not some one just looking for pills, but someone that was suffering, and why would someone go back to the same Dr, 3 times in a week for a few days worth of pain pills?      He reccommended a pain management Dr that he said was 2 mins. down the road. He also said that he checked, and they take my insurance, so I could go there right away.       I did immediately... and they were closed. Weird, huh? Then, how did he know that they took my insurance?      Did this guy call every pharmacy to see if I had other prescriptions for painkillers? If so, I think the only other Rx for painkillers was from a root canal, almost a year ago... And I didn't remember that when I was being interrogated. Does that make me a liar and someone just looking for pills? Or does that just make him a bad nurse practicioner?      PS: I do not like to take pills, and take very good care of my body. Before this round of pain I had been training for a marathon in the spring. This is not only painful, but now is also compromising my quality of life, not to mention my dignity.

20090202181704AAiwsWx	Health;Men's Health	Do you grow out of being extremely horny from adolescence?	I am seriously not looking forward to becoming an adult if im still going to be this horny. Its such a burden, i can barely pay attention in class because i constantly have to stare at someones ***, or fantasize about who knows what sexual BS. Like once i get "in the mood" everything looks attractive, even the most frowned upon and disgustingly questionable things can end up attractive to me, i realize its weird, morally disturbing, or gross as hell when im "sober", but as soon as my switch goes off and i completely forget about morals and what people will think, its getting to the point where i have to either sleep constantly to make sure i dont have to worry about anything i shouldn't do(think about doing) or i play wow or something to get my mind off it.... but that only works if there's no Belfs XP.

After looking in the mirror (we make sure no one is cheating by using the large mirror) we noticed something. When I move my eyes, they change color. My eyes, which are normally a green-brown hazel color, turned brown as I looked around in different directions. Also, when looking in my own mirror at home about three-feet away, my eyes appear gray-blue. Does anyone knows what this is called, or what triggers it. Or, are our eyes playing tricks on us?

20090202184332AAUP7nJ	Health;Mental Health	Uncontrollable rage. is this a condition? should i seek help? ?	hello all im looking for the opinion of someone(preferably a psyc major or like major) who can help me before i go to seek help,if needed.       I have since puberty experienced uncontrollable rage when certain buttons are pushed. there are few factors that can get me to that stage but when they are initiated it gets scary. When put into a rage I become violent and incoherent and I am hardly able to control my actions. As a teenager I would simply "blackout" when put into a rage and by the time i was finished raging I would no know why or exactly what I had done.       However as I have reached my early 20's it now seems that I am in a jeckle and hyde(spelling?)phase. To be more clear, as I am fighting with the person i am arguing with I am also having an internal fight with myself. for example my emotions set me up to be so violent that i think i may seriously hurt someone but my mind is arguing telling me not to do it. last night for example while fighting I nearly grabbed something heavy to throw at my spouses head(something that could have caused A LOT of damage) as i reached for it it was like my conscious fought my body, my hand was caught in the air while i had an inner struggle. this inner struggle, as i call it, gets so bad and confusing(since its like my primal self is fighting my normal self) that i completely break down crying and usually lose all control of normal functions. it literally feels like at that moment i have lost my mind as i am no longer able to form coherent thoughts. its like after that inner battle my mind breaks.          at that point i have to medicate myself with something that will calm me before the anger comes back again(usually sleeping pills)       I know i need help but is there any condition out there that sounds similar? I dont want to be like that i dont want to hurt anyone when im at that point but it seems like i really have no control.       thank you all in advance

20090202185338AA3nwc6	Health;Dental	Retainer after Braces. Do you pay for them?	Hi    I'm very upset about this problem. My orthodontic treatment was done and my braces was taken out last May. They gave me plastic retainer which looks like invisalign, so I asked why not the metal one, the assistant told me that they will re-evaluate if I need a metal one after one year. She said some people will just get the plastic one. Now one year is coming up in several month, so I asked them if I can get the metal one instead, because I feel that is more sturdy. So then the doctor told me that oh yes! of course. and he said you know they cost 600 dollars right? I said no! You never told me that. I asked him why not included in the treatment. He told me that if he included in the treatment, that will higher up the cost up front. People don't want that, so he only include the plastic one which cost less. Oh also the plastic one only last about one year, so he said if you want to keep using the plastic one , that will be 150 a pair. so I gotta pay that every year?   I was really confused at his office,but I thought maybe this is in the contract that I didn't see? So I went home and looked into my contract, there's nothing says about retainer.    I already paid 4000 dollars for this treatment and my teeth wasn't that bad just some gaps because I didn't wear my retainer after my first braces. I felt that I got ripped off!!   Anybody has similar experience? What should I do?

About five years ago I began feeling a sharp pain in my left eye, it wasn't terrible pain, but enough to affect my vision and make simple tasks difficult. So I saw a Optometrist, and he said nothing was wrong and convinced my parents to buy me glasses.      Obviously I continued having pain and concluded that asking an Optometrist for any more help, would be a waste of time and money. Eventually the pain went away, and almost permanately.      Unfortunately the pain has come back ( the sharp jabbing pain in my left eye) and I'm considering seeking help. What is the best way to approach an eye problem, through a doctor or a specialist, or wearing old glasses the were unnessicarily perscribed?

20090202135949AAkjqbU	Health;Diseases & Conditions;STDs	Chlamydia Panic help!!!!!!!?	Hi      Bit of a long one this.......but here goes      I unexpectedly fell pregnant last year. The time was not right for me to have a child and I decided to have a termination. I have lived to regret this so so much btw. At the time I was tested for chlamydia and the results came back inconclusive. On the day of my medical termination they gave me the necessary antibiotics just to be on the safe side. This was fine but about 30 minutes after I took the antibiotics I was sick.       Shortly after my termination I got back together with my first love (not the person who got me pregnant) and everything has been totally perfect. So much so we have decided to start ttc. I have asked him to get tested for chlamydia which he has done and his result has come back negative. I got tested again at the same time and I have got a text asking me to contact the clinic. I am so worried now that I may have chlamydia.  Only thing I have been thinking is that we have been ttc for 5 months now. If I had chlamydia surely I would have given it to my partner and he would have tested positive seeing that we have been having unprotected sex for a while. Could it be that I have not done the test properly (again!) It was a test provided by the Family Planning Clinic......

Just wondering because I am 25 and am a clean, middle-upper class girl who has had a round of bad luck.  I am NOT a ****, I have just made some wrong decisions.  I was exposed to chlamydia after losing my virginity (sex was protected at first), big mistake I know.  I have been with 7 guys total in my life and the 7th one whom I was talking to at the time gave it to me too.  This time I didn't want to have sex yet and told him no yet he just went ahead and did it anyway.  After this second time it has turned me off to sex with guys because of the way they treat us girls and use us.  I have decided not to have sex again until I am in a committed relationship and even months after that.  Both times devestated me.  The first time I was partially at blame because I allowed unprotected sex.  However, the second time I blame him because to an extent it was forceful sex, not necessarily rape even though I did say no 2 or 3 times.  Do guys think badly of girls if they find out their girlfriend has been exposed to STD's in the past?  PLEASE NO RUDE COMMENTS, BE MATURE ABOUT THIS!

20090202143349AA1055k	Health;Other - Health	Should I Get Anti-Depressants?	ok, i'm really paranoid.   I have PPD (paranoid personality disorder) and can't speak to anyone properly.      I even feel as if the doctor will laugh at me if I tell him, I can't sit there telling him my problems if I feel stupid and embarrased and go home hating myself.      I'm always paranoid about how I look and a girl fell over in the snow when I was coming out of uni. and I couldn't even go and ask her how she was because i felt stupid and embarrased.      I hate my life, the only way I can tell you on here is because its annynomas and nobody knows me on here.      Its just very stressful, thats all I can think about.   But if I do get anti-depressants off the doctor.      What would they make me feel like?   Would I start not caring how I look, or how I smell? or what I do?         What would happen?   and do you think I should get them?      Thanks

My friend of 25 yrs. started getting depression and was really stressed out with work and her bad romantic relationships.  She was physical fit and exercised alot.      Over a two yr period she exhausted her health insurance with batteries of test that all were negative, got on medicare(fibromyalgia?), and was trying to talk her doctor into recommending a wheel chair.       She goes to a therapist for counseling but doesn't work the programs he sets up for her.....she only wants to focus on finding something physically wrong.  Im really patient with her but she seems to thrive on the negative attention and pity? people express of "her problems".      When I try to talk to her about her counseling sessions she gets bothered and a bit angry but if I mention her other doctor appts she gets eager and is more than happy to talk about them.      I'm starting to think she has an emotional/mental problem that is just taking its toll on her body.      Her family does have a history of emotional/mental problems although she won't acknowledge it.  One is anorexic and neurotic, another an alcoholic, another is morbidly obese.
20090202153253AAWgL1j	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Respiratory Diseases	Please can anyone read this summary about smoking and please check if there is a something wrong anf fix it...?	Smoking causes several physical problems increase your risk for heart attack, stroke, osteoporosis thinning or weakening of your bones, and cancers other than lung cancer. Also, when you smoke the people around you will also inhale the smoke from our cigarette. I believe smoking should be banned for everyone. First of all is dangerous for people and also for environment. I k now that smoking is addictive and is not easy to quit, but there are many ways to quit. Moreover, people spend so much money on stuff that will get them many diseases. Usually when you ask a person who smoke why you smoke they say to get rid of the stress but on other hand they are actually self-poisoning their health.

My legs were in excruciating pain and woke me. It was a bit difficult to stand and I felt as if my legs would give out from under me. I looked down and saw two black bruises: one on my right shin and one near my left ankle. My boyfriend also saw them clearly, so I am fairly certain it wasn't a dream/hallucination. I don't do any drugs other than casual, infrequent drinking. I am a 20 year old female, if that helps. The bruises were completely gone when I woke up at 7:30am and there was and still in no pain nor any mark what-so-ever. I'm hoping to find an answer here in case it isn't serious enough to spend the money to visit a doctor.

20090202173641AAkErKx	Health;Mental Health	My single Mom suffers from depression, and for years, has been so horrible to me?	My Mom suffers from depression, but is on medication. She has always put me down and said very hurtful things to me to make me feel horrible as a person. Many think it is a lot of jealousy, because when I am with her, people always comment on how pretty I am and dont say anything about her. She even told me that it's not fair that I get compliments and she doesn't. I just turned 16, and it's only gotten worse. I know my mom and I are complete opposites, not only in how we look, but personality and our tastes. When I am being respectful to her, she is still very rude to me. She makes so many comments that are very personal that definitely hurt me. I try to talk to her about it, and she just will have nothing to do with it. She just yells at me, and comes up with excuses on why everything is ALWAYS my fault. I will admit, I'm not the PERFECT teen, but who is? Many of my friends who have been around her have noticed how rude she is to me, and how she just puts me down. My dad knows all about it, he had to live with it until they divorced. My dad talks to me about it, telling me to try not to take it personal because its just her depression talking. All she does when I'm around is want to be rude and fight with me, and that makes me very upset and it makes me be rude also because of what she says to me.      It is so hard because many have asked, "Is your Mom always like that?" and saying that their moms are only that harsh once in an occasion.      It hurts so much to have a Mom that is so full of jealousy, and resentment. I can't talk to her about it because she just bashes me and NEVER admits she is wrong or says she is sorry. This has been going on ever since I was very young. She has ranged from comments about me being "ugly" to "fat" to "disgusting" and "stupid"      I am in shape, and am skinny in a healthy way, and doing decent in school. It's just so hard for me because she is unbelievable and not logical with many things.       Ever since I was little, she has "joked" about wanting to trade daughters. and she always says things to her whole side of the family to go against me to make me look like the bad guy. She also always talks about how I am the worst teen and how no other daughter is so horrible.       I feel very hurt, and my Dad and step mom know that I am just a regular teen. They teach teens and know that I am no where close to being the "worst daughter" I don't remember the last time my mom said she loved me. She told the story about my birth, and made it sound like the worst possible day of her life. My aunt even noticed how she just had not one positive thing to say.       I asked her to give me ONE positive thing about having me. ONE.       She could not come up with one..      Any advice?

I know I probably would have been fine... but today, I decided to take Plan B just to be safe. Because Plan B will make me have my period... when should I start taking my regular birth control again? Should I start a new packet? Should I start in a few days at the end of my period?            And this is just a little side question..

There is something up there and I can't blow it out, I feel it on the tip of my finger. If I stick my finger up a half inch further, I can probably get it out but that might be too far, It gets more narrow the farther I stick my finger up. I was wondering if it would be okay to stick half my finger up there. But, what will happen if I stick my whole finger up there? There is a thin sewing needle that I can use to reach up there, but I don't want to cut anything. Should I stick my whole finger up there to see what happens? And I won't do this, but what would happen if I were to stick a whole pencil up my nostril? Just curious. What is up there?

20090202181810AAlWOsW	Health;Other - Health	Optimism and health? Fact or fiction?	Ideas about the associations of personality and health are not new, but have their roots in the bodily humors of ancient Greece.      While the exact mechanism of how personality acts as a risk factor for early death or poorer health is unclear, Maruto says it likely has to do with the fact that pessimists have an increased chance for future problems with their physical health, career achievements, and emotional stress particularly depression.      "Yet another possibility could be more directly biological, like changes in the immune system," he adds.      Researchers found that pessimists scored below the national average on physical functioning, bodily pain, perception of general health, vitality, mental health, and social functioning.      Besides looking at the world through rosier-colored glasses, living a long and healthy life may also mean paying attention to friends and family.      The rest is here.    http://ca.lifestyle.yahoo.com/health-fit...       The question is: Is this true or false?

20090202175913AAmkO53	Health;Women's Health	Why are people so obsessed with birth control?	Every doctor/nurse practitioner/physicians assistant that I've ever seen is determined to get me on the pill. One even told me I was going to get cancer because my periods were irregular (that's not even remotely true). I don't want to take it because       A. I've had side effects with all of them. Either nausea, acne, or weight gain. Sometimes a combination of all 3.    B. I don't trust it all that much. I know like 8 girls who have gotten prego on the pill. I'm too paranoid for that. If my birth control is failing, I want to know right away(ie, the condom breaks), not two weeks later when I miss my period.    C. I'm married and we want more kids in the future so it's not the end of the world if I get pregnant.       It's not just the doctors, the girls at work were shocked when I told them I'm not on anything. Am I really that weird for not wanting to be on the pill? Do they make commissions on prescribing the pill? They sure act like it.

She looked at my cervix and she says that it's not likely to be HPV and that I might have Herpes. But the thing is that I've been having sex with my partner for almost 6 months now and I read that you have an outbreak 4-7 days after contact with the virus. If he had herpes, then wouldn't I have had an outbreak sooner? He says he's been tested for everything (but he's obviously making assumptions because he gave me chlamydia recently).  I guess I just need to ask him, but I'm not sure how to bring it up.    And there's no possible way that I could have gotten it from my two previous partners. I do get cold sores, but I haven't had an outbreak in over a year so I don't see how I could have transmitted it to myself.    :( I'm just very sad about this and I'm just trying to make sense of it.

Somtetimes to the point where I believe my own lies and have to remind myself they are not true. Like I told a friend I had to drop out of a music contest because there were auditions and I wasn't good enough then I started to cry not because I wanted her to believe me/feel sorry for me but because I felt like it actually happened. I have pretty much made up a total peersonality life styles one of the top contributors in the parenting section is me a 16 year old girl. I mean I will take an event that never happened and add so much detail that everyone believes it. I also lie to get out of trouble even going so far to plant items to make it seem like im telling the truth. But im starting to scare  myself- today I made up this story about me moving to new york and even made up a school name and talked about how my dad was moving for a better job- were not going anywhere. But I also make up lies that I got in trouble and punish myself for them- and I mean really weird sh*t that I would never do. I have a journal with about 200 lines saying I won't disrupt the class- never got in trouble EVER!  Then Like I was telling my friends how I accdently sent my karate teacher an email with lots of bad language and insulting her- never did. I did 500 pushups on my own acord and wrote an "apology letter". Then I always change detail around for different groups to make me sound better like one tournament i ranked 3rd out 4 same tournament I ranked 1 out of 25. Should I see a doctor because im scaring myself.

It started about 3 days ago at school, I had to go to the nurse cause I had a huge headache, my hands were shaking, and I felt like I was gonna throw up and pass out. They sent me home and on the car ride I felt like throwing up (pretty normal though for most nausea). When we got home I slept for nearly 28 hours (on and off again) when I woke up I had to go get water, but whenever I got up, I would vomit... The next day(Sunday now, I slept through all of Saturday, haven't eaten for nearly 48 hours) I didn't vomit but my sense of balance was extremely off, I would have to hold on to things to go from place to place. Now it's Monday, and my balance is back but my throat REALLY hurts, like I swallowing sand paper, my nose is always running, my tongue has this weird yellow coating on it (its darker in the back.) Because of my throat I can't eat cause it hurts a lot, and I've already lost nearly 6 pounds and I was already underweight! This has been going around in my school, and I would like to know how long it will last and how to help end it faster (already had it for 3-4 days)

20090202184309AAApWjA	Health;Mental Health	When you feel like no one knows you what do you do next?	I do not have many friends. None that I see outside of school in fact.  Maybe I am just easily annoyed? So my best friend and family are important to me. My sister and I are really close and she called me a misanthrope.(A hater of human kind) I was upset by this because I try to be a nice person. When I told my best friend that my sister said that I was a misanthrope my friend just said "well you kind of are aren't you?" My dad stated a few days ago that I had enough self confidence to not let a problem bother me.  I dislike myself so much that I have decided on the best way to say it; I abhor myself. Yeah but my best friend doesn't seem to care. It is my fault we always joke about how people are always overreacting about stupid things and how they need to keep those emotions inside. These things make me feel bad because I think the people closest to me don't even know me.    Advice?    Also is it just me or do you always think "Man just shut up I should just get over it" after you complain about something like this. If you do think I should just suck it up try to be more creative in the way you say it and you might get chosen as best answer.

20090202185714AAvIzBr	Health;Other - Health	I THINK I may have falsely accused my uncle of molesting me?	I'll try to keep this brief. I have an uncle. He is a jerk, was horrible to my younger brothers, then in toddler years).   In 1995 (I was 15) I accused my uncle of molesting me. I believe(D)  and maybe still do. Darn, Im confused!   With that said, the other day, here on yahoo, someone mentioned sleep paralysis with lucid dreaming. I experience both on a fairly regular basis. I decided to look into sleep paralysis and think I realized all the times I saw demons and wasnt actually sleeping was this. Actually, without getting into that story, I realized I experience this now and then. I realized that these things I see admist otherwise darkness and with the inability to move may be me just panicing from the paralysis. Sleep paralysis occurs mainly when people are under alot of stress or have slept too much or suffer from other sleep disorders.   Back to when I accused my uncle. Earlier that day I was at school, I was sent to the er and was told it was just a panic attack. I go home, sleep and I didnt see my uncle but I could feel his finge with my hand inside of me. I awoke to my boxers pushed to the side, fan off(I always had it on) and blankets on the ground, NOT right next to my bed. I awoke and knew something happened. In those days my uncle lived with us and at that time of day that day, he was the only man home. I remembered what the finger felt like and looked at my brother's, my dad's and his fingers and believed it was my uncle plus my mom said only my uncle was home. Now, Im worried, even though he was an ****** regardless that I was just experiencing sleep paralysis, which in hindsight is much like the demonic things I experience occasionally.  I saw a video of a woman saying during her sleep paralysis she was raped. Umm, what do you think?

If my sister says something mean to me or about, I SOMETIMES cry. Everytime my family gangs up on me (just say I'm wrong about something), I feel helpless and I cry. I think its pointless but it feels uncontrollable sometimes. I want the will power to be able to not cry because crying is weakness. I cry over the most petty things and I just can't understand why.

I'll try not to go into too much detail about everything. Basically, I've grown up in a dysfunctional family. My dad was a drinker and abusive and my mom did nothing to help herself.

I really want to go to university when I graduate, but I can't because I can't pay for it and because of my depression, I'm doing horrible in school. Life is really hard sometimes. I used to think I was happy isolated from people, but now I realize that I'm just lonely. It's extremely hard when you have no friends.

I'm starting to cry now because I'm so upset with myself.  What do I do?

My entire family is still on the concept that colds are caused by cold weather, drinking cold water, etc. My sick nephew came over he is one and a half and the same day he came I got sick in the evening. My mom taking of the blame of my nephew started saying you can't get it so fast. She was saying is that you don't dress warm, you eat cereal with cold milk (I don't like warm milk) and you go outside in the winter with wet hair. It is getting quite annoying because I have tried numerously and showed to my parents that you can't get a cold from "COLD" Is their anyway that I can prove that you can't get a cold from "COLD"? It's the same as saying you can get crabs from "CRABS". How fast do cold symptoms appear I got the cold after 3 hrs he came. What caused I don't remember him sneezing on me.

20090202185126AAt6VxP	Health;Mental Health	What is the point of life if we are just going to die?	Right now I'm a 21 year old college student. My major is International Economics/Business, and I'm not really that happy with it. Yeah, I am semi-interested in it, but it's not what I want I want to do with my life. The problem is, I don't really know what I do want to do. I just don't know that I'm not doing what I want to be doing. Honestly, I don't get enjoyment out of many activities. Part of me actually wants to drop out of college, but I only have a year left, so it's not an option. I just don't know what I want to do. I feel that even if I do get a great job...so what? I'm going to be a wage-slave my whole life and then die. We're all going to die, so what's the point. But it's sort of reassuring that we're all going to die, because it leaves us more freedom to do whatever the hell we want.   Another issue is that I've never been in a relationship, which doesn't bother me so much. I also have no desire for sex. So perhaps I'm asexual. I think society puts way too much emphasis on relationships. People think that if they don't have someone they are incomplete or a loser. Why can't people just be happy alone? Why can't people be happy with themselves? I think there's more to life than relationships and love. What's with society's obsession over love. Because when it comes down to it, if you're not happy with yourself, and don't love yourself, you're not gong to be happy in a relationship. Relationships are not a cure to make yourself happy.   Between school and relationships, I'm just at a very confused point in my life. Society's typical path of good career, marriage, white picket fence, kids is not for me..   On top of everything, I have an extremely overbearing mother who won't stop telling me what jobs to apply for and what to do with my life.

20090202185252AAzPL7f	Health;Diet & Fitness	Gym has no squat rack.. alternative?	I have been getting into more compound exercises lately since I am an ectomorph trying to gain mass. Anyways, planet fitness unfortunately has no squat or power rack! They have the smith machines but I hate doing squats on these, I like total control w/o the smith machine interfering.      Anyways, what I have been doing, is using what I guess would be called the barbell/weight rack thing for squats. It's really just a place to rack barbells and weights. There is always only one barbell on this thing (lol). So what I do is, have the barbell on the holder that allows me to get under the bar, bring it out, do my squats freely out in the open, then walk it back in on the hooks when finished.      As said, I think this thing is just intended for racking weights/barbells but it's all I see possible to use in this gym that has no squat rack or power rack!      Any suggestions?

20090202122722AA9IGfQ	Health;Women's Health	Vaginal pain one year after childbirth?	I gave birth to my son vaginally 14 months ago. The first few times my husband and I had sex after wards it hurt really badly, so we went to my ob and he decided to cut some skin out because he thought that maybe he had sewn over a nerve. So he cut the skin out and that didn't take care of the pain. Then we tried some numbing gel before my husband and I had sex to see if the area just needed to be toughened up again by bearing through the pain. That didn't work, there was no bearing through the pain. So then my doctor decided to try some cortizone shots in the area to try to toughen the skin that way. That seemed to make it worse. Ever since then it has hurt to stand for long periods of time. I get this uncomfortable pain inside my vagina. So then the doctor put me on nuriten (which is a pill for severe nerve damage) and that is supposed to numb that area so that the nerves can heal. In the mean time we had an mri done which came back completely normal. Well I have been on the pill for about 1 month now and it isn't doing anything. My doctor has said that he doesnt understand why it is hurting and that he isn't sure what else to do.       My husband and I have not had sex for almost a year now and we would really like to get something figured out. We have talked about getting a second opinion but i don't think that another ob is going to be able to figure out what is wrong. I just dont know where to go next. My sister recommended a chiropractor and I have always been skeptical of them so I am not sure about that option yet. I am just looking for someone who has been through what I am going through. It is so frustrating and I'm looking for some advice.

She can never orgasm during intercourse but usually only while I'm using my hands.  I can always tell right when she's getting ready to because her whole body gets really tense and then she makes me stop.  On the few occasions where she's let me keep going she will squirt (not a lot like in the movies but a fair amount.  I assume that when she does this, this is her orgasm.) This is partially my confusion.  Why is she making me stop?  Would that not be what she is going for and enjoying like a guy does?  Please, only female answers to this question.

20090202123204AAdZ5ef	Health;Men's Health	Can i have kids - 14 year old male - testicle injury?	I am a 14 year old male.      Basically 7 weeks ago i was kicked in the balls by a stupid tw*t at school, his kick somehow only hit the left testicle - for days it was swollen to twice the normal size and then it went back to its normal size - the pain stopped too. The testicle had bgone hard from the injury but all the hardness went - except for a "ridge/lump" at the bottom of the testicle - where the testicle joins the epididermis.      About three weeks ago i went to the doc about the ridge - he says he thinks it is just the blood from the injury which has dried up - he mentioned something about gravity and that is why it is near the bottom etc. Anyway he says he doesn't think it is anything serious and is nothing to worry about but to check thetre is no other damage he is sending me for a scrotal scan in two months (this shows there is no urgency in the docs opinion)      But the doc mentioned something that scared me - he said that there is a very slight chance that the left testicle no longer works (from the injury) although he said mine is giving good signs as there is pain when he squeezed it and also has not shrivveled up. The doc says there is no way of knowing if it works or not and to just forget about it.      This leads me on to my question - IF the left one no longer works will i be infertile/not be able to get a woman pregnant?      Also if it doesn't work but i am still fertile - if the left one was damaged or removed would i be infertile.      Please answer honestly and sensibly as i am sh*t scared and i want to have kids etc      Thanks - 14 year old male

I don't think it's diabetes because one of my friends uses an insulin pump and it looks nothing like this, mainly because of the number of chords.

The last couple days I've been taking naps and still getting 8+ hours of sleep each night. I've never been like this before and I'm on a regular sleeping schedule. When walking to class I realized I was short of breath and really tired. That's when I finally realized something was off.      I started the pill about 4 months ago and switched over to another pill recently when my period became irregular. I'm taking it every morning at the same time but I'm still irregular.      Before I was on the pill I had my period once every other month(it was awesome). But after becoming sexually active I figured it was best not to freak out ever other month thinking I'm pregnant.      So I guess this is sort of 2 questions      Is the pill the reason my period is coming so frequently? I thought it was supposed to regulate my period.   and   Do you think that this much bleeding is causing my to become anemic?

20090202124139AAICuaI	Health;Mental Health	Do I have an anxiety disorder?	here are my symptoms   Well to start off, Im 17 years old. So far, all my life iv been dealing with being painfully shy. You know, never wanting to get up and talk in class and not being able to talk to guys. I was horrible at making friends, I can only make friends if I already had a friend there with me to start out with. Stuff youd think you can out grow. As highschool came, I tried talking more and stuff, but I was still very quiet and shy. I love to party (only because the alcohol will make me talk), So I partied a lot, but when I was sober I'd avoid being near people, Or be there but not talk at all. Even thoguh with good firends and family I'm very loud and talk a lot. So, in the 10th grade, I started taking Adderall XR, I became VERY quite, I didn't talk to anyone in class and people started to notice. Asking me Why i dont talk in class? or Why am I so quite? Anyways, So now everytime I'm with people I become even more shy and I dont know what to say, Or where to look. I feel like every move I make is awkward and people notice, Or that people just think Im realllllyyy weird.. I've become so monotone when I talk, I avoid turing projects in on time so I wouldn't have to present them. I get really shaky and red and really bad cotton mouth when I talk to people. And after I talk to them, Even If its just a "yes" or "hi" I always think to myself for like 10 minutes like "was that weird? should I have said something else? i wonder what they think of me now." At my volleyball practices, I didn't make firends, I didnt talk to anyone, I didn't try my hardest, and I eventuall quit because I became so embaressed.   I NEED HELP! what do I have? What medication helps it !!

20090202191141AAZF0K5	Health;Diet & Fitness	Atkins diet and low carb food?	I've been on the atkins diet for about 4 days now and i'm getting a little confused with the whole counting carbs part of it. Let me explain what i've eaten so far today and see if someone is able to tell me if my carb consumption sounds okay or not. I had one piece of chicken for lunch (just a thigh). Then later I had some chicken (about 5 small strips) with a cup of cooked bell peppers and I had mustard for my sauce. I've had one of the atkins bars (the cinnamon bun) or whatever it's called, it has 3 net carbs in it. I've also had 1 string cheese that contains pastuerized milk. I've drank 1 lemonade crystal light to go packet and 1 diet rite soda which is made with splenda. Now, i'm going to make a lettuce wrap with a piece of lettuce, hamburger meat, a few small chopped onions, a little shredded cheddar cheese and a small bit of sour cream.  Does that go over the carbs i'm suppose to be consuming or not? I don't believe it really does but just want to make sure since i've just started, I don't want to mess the diet up at all. Also, is any sugar what so ever allowed on this diet because i noticed all the sour creams have at least 1 g of sugar and it says you're allowed to have sour cream so i'm a lil confused. And as far as salad dressings go the hidden valley ranch packets you can buy, you either mix it with buttermilk or mayo, I bought the kind to mix with mayo but it says to add milk to it also so i don't believe that will work.. i was thinking to use water instead, there's only 1 carb in the packet and less than 1 carb in this blue cheese dressing i bought and it contains no sugar so will these dressings work? One more thing, paprika, is it okay or no? Anyone who can answer my questions i would appreciate it!

I'm trying to decide on a good brand of contact lenses, so far I'm more drawn towards Acuvue Oasys or PureVision, but before I commit, I don't know if I should aim towards a reusable pair or disposable. I have glasses that I wear every day, and I would probably wear them about half the time even with contacts. At the same time, I wouldn't want to start wearing contacts every day and regret not going for a reusable. Money isn't really an issue, because if I find something good, It'll be worth it. Any thoughts are appreciated!

20090202192402AACLJiT	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	I need help from people knowledgeable about nerve disorders.....?	I have a Neurological Condition that as of now my doctor's are thinking is MS. I also have Trigeminal Neuralgia which is some sort of damage to the Trigeminal nerve in my face. It causes severe stabbing pains under my eyes, jaws, temples and right in front of my ears. Sometimes it is accompanied by burning as well. My current issue (as if I don't have enough :) is that I have two cold sores (thanks to my mom who passed the virus on to me as a child) on my right upper lip. I have only had two other cold sores in my life (I am now 36). I have been having pain from the cold sores up to my eye. Its the whole side of my face.....my nose feels numb on the inside, my cheek burns, under my eye hurts and burns and the outer corner of my eye feels like someone put salt in it. The whole side feels like there is a giant bruise there and I can't touch it or lay on it because it's too painful. My question.... Is this all being triggered by the cold sores or are the cold sores just coinciding with a really bad flare up of the Trigeminal Neuralgia? I already take medication for all of the pain I am in from head to toe and it usually takes care of the pain in my face but this week it isn't even touching it. I feel as if I am constantly going to the doctor with new symptoms and I just don't want to go if I can figure out how to find just a little bit of relief on my own. Although I do have na awesome doctor who says if I need to see him everyday he would make room in his schedule for me. He knows I am not someone who runs to him for every little thing and that I am just having a lot of big things happen all at once. But, again I don't want to go........I feel as if I have been doing nothing but taking medication (only two for over 2 years but it's still 4 times a day and that's a lot to me) and going to this doctor or that hospital or just one more test........So if you know anything about nerves and how to find relief when your normal solution isn't working please share your knowledge...thanks....especially if you took the time to read all of this :)

Am I actually gaining muscle and endurance when I'm filled with adrenaline?
