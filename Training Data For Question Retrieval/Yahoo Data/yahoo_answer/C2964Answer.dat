kfWi9ZkEaa	I believe that if we each made sure we balanced our inwards with our outwards, we wouldn't have a problem - or be a part of the problem, anyway.  So that's what I do.  I'm so little (only one of me) that it's all I can do.  I grow my own firewood, and also about 1000 trees on my block just for air and animal habitat.  I grow my own veges, not just greens but potatoes, corn, and I'm going to do wheat next year (learning on the job.)  Not yet at the stage of growing my own toilet paper but hopefully some of the trees I grow offset that.  Work locally. Take the chillibin to town to shop (1/2 hr away) once a fortnight instead of once a week, fill the car right up.  <br>  <br>  Don't buy plastic covered things if I can avoid it.  <br>  <br>  The scary part is, that when one tries to be carbon neutral, one discovers one cannot.  Everything's plastic wrapped.  Everything's hermetically sealed.  Every glass jar still has plastic foil to 'prove freshness' and protect against tampering.  There is nothing you can buy except jam that isn't encased in plastic, or using up tin, or aluminium.  <br>  <br>  When you think of that, and think of your own waste, the stuff you chuck, and then look at the size of your section, the carbon you sequester, the fumes from your car, you will see that you use more than you create.  Now times that by four billion.<br>  <br>  Volcanoes, as has already been mentioned, don't even come close.  <br>  <br>  And to avoid becoming suicidal, one just has to try to rebalance the inwards/outwards equation for him/herself, and have some hope.  There is nothing else I can think of to do for us little guys.|`|xUwWxKjhaa	i don't think about it until someone says global warming and then i think about it, but i am very eco-friendly!|`|8PAfsI7Iaa	i know some peolpe dont belive in globle worming but i do!|`|vxUoVi6saa	people are too worried about it.

v3Motq8Iaa	Because although the smokers would have the *choice* to smoke, the non-smokers are denied the *choice* to avoid their 2nd-hand smoke.|`|Jm6mkvlWaa	Lots of good answers here.<br>  <br>  I agree that smoking is a personal choice, however so is the choice to not smoke. So like many people above, I do not want to be exposed to something I am choosing to abstain from. For instance, if I don't want to do drugs or drink because of the physical and sometimes legal repercussions, the last place I am going to be is in a room with a bong or a bunch of drunk people. If I don't want to smoke because it will damage my health, then I shouldn't have to be in a room or even in close proximity of a lit cigarette or cigar unless I choose to be.  Smoking sections would be a great solution to this, IF they were properly separated so the smoke didn't leak into the non-smoking section.<br>  <br>  But some good reasons of mine are:<br>  <br>  -Allergies. Some people are allergic to smoke. These allergies have different levels. Some people may just have headaches or sneeze. Others may literally be unable to breathe.<br>  <br>  -Pregnant People. Sometimes it isn't obvious if there is a pregnant person beside you. They might not be showing yet, or you just might not be able to see their stomach. But second hand smoke is just as toxic to an unborn child as it is to anyone else. This could cause them lots of health problems.<br>  <br>  -Simply the smell.  I HATE  the smell of cigarettes, as do many people I know. There is nothing worse than leaving a smoke filled restaurant and being able to smell the cigarettes in your hair and on your clothes. Ew.<br>  <br>  -Health Risks.  Cancer is just one of the many health risks for the smokers and those around them exposed to second hand smoke.

15mbP1hqaa	There is not depletion of oxygen - in the present equilibrium, production and consumption occur at the same rate of roughly 1/2000th of the entire atmospheric oxygen per year.<br>  <br>  The unusually high concentration of oxygen gas on Earth is the result of the oxygen cycle. This biogeochemical cycle describes the movement of oxygen within and between its three main reservoirs on Earth: the atmosphere, the biosphere, and the lithosphere. The main driving factor of the oxygen cycle is photosynthesis, which is responsible for modern Earth's atmosphere. Photosynthesis releases oxygen into the atmosphere, while respiration and decay remove it from the atmosphere.|`|kfWi9ZkEaa	People tend to freak about the next emergency in front of them, and don't look twelve car-lengths ahead to the emergency behind that.<br>  <br>  I think we have a few million years of oxygen around 'at present usage levels' and so people dont' think it's an issue.  As that graph goes interstellar however, you know the one - human population - then people are perhaps going to have to have a rethink.  Right now, everyone thinks the plankton and the green belt are working for us, it will be interesting to see what happens when they realise the balance is being tipped, things are going downhill.<br>  <br>  having said this: there is no such thing as 'permanent' oxygen depletion, which may be frying the brains of the answerers.  this is because the oxygen isn't being depleted, it's just being locked in a two-for-one relationship with carbon.  It can be released from this relationship.  <br>  <br>  The decrease in free oxygen is not yet any kind of emergency, and doesn't rate against the global warming issue in terms of urgency.  Also, one last avenue for a little bit of hope for you:  when countries become first world countries, their population growth slows and in some places comes to a dead stop.  This is because some become more selfish and don't have children (due to ability to look after selves in old age), children do not die so parents don't have to have 'spares' and the agrarian culture of having lots of sons to work the farm changes.  As such, it is possible the earth's population will level off when all the third world countries get settled and start to feel secure.  I'm not promising anything, but it is a hope for the future.|`|NC5GCk5Yaa	we do...most oxygen comes from the rain forest or plankton....

However,our acquaintance with these feelings is not limited solely to the press; in daily life,we,too,frequently come across such problems and, more importantly, personally experience them. <br>  People and societies endeavour to liberate themselves from the distressing experiences,disorder and repressive social structures that have prevailed over the world for long periods. <br>  We only need to glance at ancient Greece; the Great Roman Empire; Tsarist Russia, or the so-called Age of Enlightenment, and even the 20th century-a century of misery which saw two world wars and world-wide social disasters. No matter upon which century or location you concentrate your research, the picture will not be appreciably different. <br>  If this is the case, why haven't people succeeded in solving these problems, or at least some efforts been made to remove such social diseases from society?<br>  People have encountered these problems in all ages, yet each time they have failed to find any solutions because the methods they employed were inappropriate. They sought various solutions, tried different political systems, laid down impracticable and totalitarian rules, stirred up revolutions or subscribed to perverted ideologies, while many others preferred to adopt an indifferent attitude and merely accepted the status quo. <br>  In our day, people are almost numbed by this way of living. They readily believe these problems to be "facts of life." They picture a society immune to these problems as being nothing short of impossible-a dream utopia. They persistently and openly express their distaste for such a way of living, yet easily embrace it, since they think they have no other alternative. <br>  The resolution of all these problematic issues is possible only by living by the principles of the "true religion." Only when the values of true religion prevail can a pleasant and tranquil scene replace this gloomy and unfavourable picture, which is doomed to continue so long as God's limits are ignored. To put it another way, people are enslaved by these complications as long as they avoid the values of the Qur'an. Put simply, this is the "nightmare of disbelief" and the link below for this wonderful book:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://fs.harunyahya.net/popup/Download.php?WorkNumber=256&Format=pdf" rel="nofollow">http://fs.harunyahya.net/popup/Download....</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  you will find how the regulation of life by the "norms of morality" introduced by the Qur'an revealed to mankind by God will banish the "nightmare of disbelief," how pessimism, corruption and social restlessness can be eliminated from society, how the individual can surround himself with an ideal environment, what spiritual and material benefits he is likely to attain by adherence to these norms of morality are gone into in detail, and finally, that the unique alternative to all these problems is the morality of the Qur'an. <br>  So far, many books have attempted to deal with the social and psychological problems societies face. Yet, what distinguishes this book from others is its stress on the most realistic solution. It also sincerely warns people against the troublesome future they are likely to face if they fail to resort to this solution. <br>  We expect that every reader of conscience will grasp that peace, mutual trust and an ideal social life is attainable only by embracing the values of the Qur'an and will turn to the true religion, which is Islam. <br>  They will then happily join the ranks of those who never suffer, mentally or physically, from any of the above-mentioned complications. Around them, there will always be an abundance of favours, comfort, love, respect, peace and confidence, and moral virtues will prevail. They will know how to earn God's approval, by observing His limits and the commandments of the Qur'an. They will thus, by having faith in God, attain His mercy and at last enter Paradise. <br>  <br>  Useful link:<br>  (A BRIEF ILLUSTRATED GUIDE TO UNDERSTANDING ISLAM)<br>  <a href="http://www.islam-guide.com/islam-guide.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.islam-guide.com/islam-guide.p...</a><br>  <br>  DEEP THINKING (VIDEO):<br>  <a href="http://api.fmanager.net/api_v1/productDetail.php?dev-t=EDCRFV&objectId=1124" rel="nofollow">http://api.fmanager.net/api_v1/productDe...</a><br>   <br>  <br>  =* FOR ANY HELP FEEL FREE TO E-MAIL ME ON *=<br>  smiling4ever222@hotmail.com|`|jlrb0ZXoaa	thats for me to know and you to find out.|`|ec45bd3c57c889d4473f8190a75e9551aa	breeding to sustain the species

s1xoaIBAaa	Yes and no.<br>  <br>  If you divide the country into four quarters, then Oklahoma is in the southwest quarter. But then so is Texas, which most people do not consider southwestern. (Texas is Texas, a case unto itself)<br>  <br>  In terms of physical geography, the extreme western part of the state especially the panhandle is similar to parts of the southwest. Culturally, Oklahoma shares little with southwest. It lacks the Hispanic heritage that is so dominant in states like New Mexico and Arizona. Add in the the eastern part of the state, especially the northeast gets a good amount of rainfall then there is even less similarity.<br>  <br>  Oklahoma is really a case unto itself.  No other state shares a similar history. Unlike the other plains states Oklahoma was not settled by whites in the middle of the 19th century, as it was set apart as Indian Territory. It wasn't a state during the Civil War and didn't join the Confederacy, although several of the tribes did fight with the South. Southeastern Oklahoma shares a great deal culturally with the South, so much that used to be called Little Dixie in the rest of state. The oil boom in brought a lot of people from the mid-west to the state, so some parts of the state, especially Tulsa, have a more mid-western feel.<br>  <br>  So there you have it, Oklahoma is not really Southern, not really Southwestern, only sort of a plains state, and sort of Midwestern.|`|c8b96c428b5adcbe941b94e428a6e7afaa	If Illinois, Ohio, and Indiana are the Mid-West<br>  <br>  OK is South of them<br>  and West of the Mississippi<br>  <br>  yeppers - - southwestern state<br>  <br>  all the best!

It takes more energy to separate the things that burn in H2O than is contained in the H2O.|`|uFQFRdczaa	The idea is complete bunk.  Electrolysis has never been demonstrated at more than 70% efficiency (Wiki electrolysis), and car engines work at about 20% efficiency.  Combine that with 30% efficiency from our existing coal-fired power stations and 90% efficiency from the grid (DOE) and you can see why this is not a good idea.  It works out to less than 5% thermal efficiency, compared to 20% for a gasoline engine.  <br>  <br>  But it will probably happen anyway, because people are stupid.  Hydrogen will run in a car, the car doesn't emit much pollution--so people will ignore the fact it takes 4 times as much energy to make the hydrogen car roll as it does to make the gasoline car roll.  People will ignore the environmental impact as well.  Lots of folks are already working on it, there are probably dozens of these cars on the road already.|`|L8zmQS8Jaa	I am not familiar with any engine designed to run on water now or planned any time in the future.  There are however processes used to split the water molecule into its parts and then recombine them to produce energy to run an engine.  There are several problems with this.<br>  <br>  The water molecule is very stable.  It takes a lot of energy to break it apart.  Recombining it you would not get the same energy back.  This is not impossible.  Theoretically you might put solar panels on a car and makes Brown's Gas (HOH) from water (H2O) using electrolysis.  It would not be efficient but it might be done on some limited basis if you parked the car long enough in the sun and traveled a very short distance (less than 1 mile for every hour that the car stood in the sun.)  You would be using the HOH as a storage medium for the solar power but you could do better with a modern battery and run the car with a 90% efficient electric motor. (about 2 miles for every hour in the sun.)<br>  <br>  Additionally, the brown's gas would be far more unstable than the battery.  A spark could literally set it off<br>  <br>  Advocates of using this process suggest that either using an existing car alternator or a solar cell to produce brown's gas while it is being used to eliminate the storage issue.  The problem with the alternator is that there is no free lunch.  The power used by the alternator will decrease your milage by more than the brown's gas adds.  <br>  <br>  Solar panels on the roof of a vehicle are not particularly efficient as the sun moves through the sky the angle of the solar panels to the sun means that the max power will be around noon and in the morning and evening far less light energy will be hitting the panels. <br>  <br>  There is a chemical way to produce hydrogen using lye and aluminum.  But lye is dangerous to human life.  There are sure to be many accidents.  I am still researching the by-products.  It could be that electricity or even gasoline is cheaper.  <br>  <br>  If you have any reference I would love to see one.|`|d1ee48df00eb4b8567acf7a43aeb1c1aaa	There are a great many scams that involve "water as fuel".  Most of them are absolute bunk.  <br>  <br>  There is a semi-legitimate scheme to use water as an energy storage device.  In that system, electricity is used to convert water into its parts, hydrogen and oxygen.  The hydrogen is compressed, bottled and stored on the vehicle.  Then a fuel cell turns the hydrogen and oxygen back into water, making electricity.  This does work, but it's so inefficient as to not be worthwhile.|`|73d140d83d29234efdfa2c38e0168b47aa	It will never happen. Study your physics and then U would know.|`|fp9bOiVFaa	There's a reason water is one of the most abundant materials on Earth: it's VERY stable. As other people have said, you CAN get hydrogen from water and burn that hydrogen to release energy and get water back, BUT in order to get high-energy hydrogen from low-energy water, you need to add energy to that water. At best, you're going to get out exactly as much energy from burning the hydrogen as you put in to make it. More likely, you'll get less out due to friction, noise, inefficiencies in the conversion process, ect. and you've just wasted energy. Water will NEVER be an fuel source. At best water will be used as an energy storage medium (i.e. battery) for renewable energy (solar, wind).|`|1C79Txcyaa	Yes, this is a very real development that has been done many times before.<br>  <br>  Water is H2O, as you know, two parts hydrogen and one part oxygen. Hydrogen is a extremely flammable/explosive gas, and oxygen is a combustible gas. If there was a way to separate the water into the two gases, the combination would be an amazing source of fuel.<br>  <br>  It can be done through electrolysis. By passing an electric charge through H2O, the molecules can be separated and the resulting gas used as fuel.<br>  <br>  Is it true? Search on Youtube for "Water torch". You can make one in your own garage. Using it to power a vehicle is simply another application of the same principle.<br>  <br>  So, since this is true, why haven't we been implementing it into our country powerhouses on a large scale? Think it might have something to do with all the oil tycoons worried about losing their business? You think?<br>  <br>  If there was no need for oil (petrol and gasoline), hundreds of thousands of people would lose jobs, and a select few leaders/owners/tycoons would lose a tremendous amount of money. <br>  <br>  Water as a fuel source will not happen on a large scale in the future for these and possibly other reasons. It WILL be used on a smaller scale, however, by those ingenious people who are really trying to make the world a better place.

During the next decade with rising world temperatures  we could experience :-  increased frequency and intensity of storms, hurricanes, floods and droughts, increased frequency of forest fires, melting glaciers and polar ice , rising sea levels,  hundreds of millions of environmental refugees, the climate change will threaten our health , malaria , asthma, encephalitis, tuberculosis, leprosy and measles are all expected to become more common  <br>   For years scientists and researchers have been warning us of  world wide disasters due to global warming , it may not effect this generation but you have been warned  these  things could happen , and may have already started. Climate models show that atmospheric temperatures will increase by between 1.5C and 4.5C by the year 2100 if a "wait and see and do nothing" approach is adopted .<br>    Because of thermal expansion of the water and melting of continental glaciers sea levels would rise, possibly as much as 0.6 meters (two feet), by the end of the next century , resulting in the permanent flooding of vast areas of heavily populated lands , the additional fresh water dumped into the Atlantic could switch off the Gulf stream making Ireland as cold as Spitsbergen a city well within the arctic circle.<br>    At the 160-nation climate summit held in Kyoto, Japan, in December 1997, industrialised countries agreed to cut emissions of Carbon Dioxide (CO2), Methane( CH4), and Nitrous oxide , the main problem gasses  to  below 1990 levels within 10 to 14 years. They are still arguing over how to make the cuts , governments and indeed their voters have not really bothered to do much about global warming and to a large extent its  a “ wait and see and do nothing “ policy. <br>     <br>  Who are the big polluters ?<br>   We all contribute to the vast amounts of CO2 gas mainly from burning fossil fuels our unhindered use energy contributes to the ever increasing emissions .<br>   Huge amounts of Methane are produced from Coal mining , China, the former Soviet Union and the United States combined produces two-thirds of the world's methane emissions from coal, this not from burning coal, but mining it . Domestic animals kept for food , currently account for about 15 percent of the annual methane emissions.<br>    <br>  Methane versus Carbon Dioxide<br>   Global Carbon dioxide emissions from industrial and domestic uses are estimated at  7 billion tons this is added to the 750 billion tons already in the atmosphere  , 4 billion tons of this will be absorbed by plants , marine life , and the oceans , each year the CO2 in the atmosphere increases by 3 billion tons . Thankfully the oceans seem to have a limitless capability to absorb and hold CO2 . Carbon Dioxide held in the oceans is estimated at 35 Trillion tons . <br>  <br>  Methane :- It has been estimated the total annual global production is somewhere between 400 to 600 million tons , this is equivalent to 36 Billion tons of CO2 , domestic animals mainly cattle , sheep , camels and goats , contribute approximately 65 to 85 million tons . Methane is also produced from land-fill sites , but these take some years to produce large quantities of the gas. As a  greenhouse gas methane is 20 to 60 times more potent than carbon dioxide, it remains in the atmosphere for about 15 years then breaks down into Carbon dioxide ! Methane is not absorbed by the oceans .<br>   <br>   Since the early to mid-1800's, the amount of Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased by about 25 per cent whereas Methane concentrations have risen by about 150 per cent. Methane is currently the second largest contributor to global warming , ( Carbon Dioxide being number one ) but levels of Methane are rising at a rate of 1% per year , which is faster than the rate CO2 increases.<br>  <br>  Governments concentrate on CO2 reductions mainly by bigger and bigger fuel taxes , but many believe that Methane emissions would  be the better target all be it harder for the public to swallow .<br>   So the question really is, could we globally, stop using ruminant domestic animals for food , shut down all the coal mining and land-fill operations , thus saving the equivalent of 12 years Carbon dioxide pollution , it  would go a long way to controlling  the greenhouse effect or shall we wait and see and do nothing .|`|A8YUlTimaa	Global Warming is caused by many things.

Further, many of the causes and effects are such that to define either into a category would be moot.<br>  <br>  An example of both cause and effect would be the melting of glacial icepack.  Much of the water of our lakes, rivers and streams are a direct result of glacial runoff.  As the glacial icepack diminishes, so does the availability of fresh water in those lakes, rivers, and streams.  The initial effect may be less water for agriculture,drinking, and hydropower.  Multiplying the intitial warming by melt-off,  it exposes more of the earth which is less reflective than the icepack and gathers more heat, thereby  melting the icepack further.<br>  <br>  Another example of intermingled cause and effect is the warming of the climate in Canada, Alaska, and Siberia promoting the thawing of the permafrost tundra, which in turn promotes the chemical release of Methane into the atmosphere creating a magnification factor that would be unpredictable.<br>  <br>  The warming of the ocean is another fine example.  In the ocean depths there are many frozen fields of methane gasses.  As the ocean temperature rises at depth these field begin to bubble up and ocaisionally will have expansive releases.  Some of these releases are theorized to be a likely cause for disappearances of ships and planes in the Bermuda Triangle.  Again the magnification factor is undeterminable, yet it is certain to be multiple.  And still bearing both cause and effect.<br>  <br>  We also have to consider deforestation as another cause and effect.  Trees and plants in general are greatly responsible for stabilizing weather, and the absorbtion of greenhouse gas, mainly CO2.  Our forests are in decline which can also effect the absorbtion and multiplication factor of greenhouse gas and therefore global warming.<br>  <br>  The trend of increasing global warming is irefutable in my investigative studies attempting to utilize only unbiased reference.  NASA has provided a great deal of documentation and research on the subject and I do believe that to be fairly unbiased.  Regardless, there will always be those that even with evidence of worldwide, overall temperature increases, with few anomolies, and glacial recession worldwide progressing at an ever increasing rate; that  will deny that we have any impact, or that  global warming is even occurring at all.<br>  <br>  Only one point can be made without question.  There is no question that all things have a multiplicative factor.  And that our earth is a highly evolved ecosystem. Population will continue to grow and the planets resources will continue to diminish in forests, wetlands, water, and carbon based fuels.  We have many sustainable resources and technologies available to explore and refine.  It would benefit everyone to conserve and develop these technologies so that these resources may still have use and availability in the future.  We would also diminish our part in any magnifaication factor involving what could be catasrophic in an oxegen based environment.  It is true that in the billions of years that the planet has evolved that greenhouse gassses were more prevalent.  But it is in the Oxygen based environment that mammals and ourselves thrived, and I don't believe most of us wish for that to diminish.
y5xzUEu8aa	Sustainability means living within our resource base. We don't come anywhere near this currently, however if we did it would essentially mean an increase in the resources that we depend upon.  An increase in the availability of resources would affect the supply and demand cycle, which would mean lower costs of living, leading to a more affluent society.  This has nothing but positive flow on effects for social sustainability such as increased health, lower unemployment, higher education, less depression etc.  <br>  <br>  Of course this will all occur anyway when the human race reaches its carrying capacity (K) and 80% of the world's population dies from some horrific disease or environmental disaster, thus providing those remaining with more available resources.  So in an way population dynamics will determine the sustainability of the human race whether we like it or not - yay for mother nature :-)|`|NC5GCk5Yaa	countries benefit from trade.

But having a dairy farm here is illegal because the ZONING BOARD has deemed my area non-agricultural.  There is not enough room in the property lots to put that many cows, and even if there were, there is not enough room on the roads to handle all the tanker trucks coming in and out twice a day for milk collection.  Where there are cows, there are usually fences, and both the city AND the county have CODE ENFORCEMENT RULES dictating the type of fence, the colours it gets painted, the location it must be from the plot lines, the public utility access easement distance around it, and how high it can be on any given side of the property.  Barbed wire is not allowed, and neither is no-climb or electric.  Which is good, because if I had a dairy butted up against my property with a fence like that, it could harm my children or my domestic pets.<br>  <br>  On a positive note, having dairy cows that close would give the kids a great place to learn the value of hard work, and mother nature (giving birth), as well as having a terrific place to get some topnotch garden fertilizer and fresh milk.  It might even spark up an interest in home cheesemaking, butterchurning and homemade ice cream.

AA11130104	these sunken logs are valuable because they come from virgin forests.  These forests where hundreds if not thousands of years old.  This leads to a very tight and dense grain, which from a wood working point of view gives you a very dense, and stable product.<br>  <br>  For example, old growth pine behaves in the same manner (in woodworking) as new growth oak.<br>  <br>  That's why it's more expensive.|`|ev33OxJbaa	In logging, as in all natural resource industries, the cost of raw materials is critical, and the success of underwater wood will probably depend on economics, says Eugene Wengert, a forest products industry consultant and retired professor of forest ecology and management from the University of Wisconsin–Madison. The question, he says, is whether those trees are cheaper to cut than fresh ones. “Logging and sawmilling are not done because we really love it,” he says. “They are done to make a profit.”<br>  Companies such as Timeless Timber of Ashland, Wisconsin, recover logs that sank during log drives on rivers as much as a century ago. The process of raising these river logs is expensive, so the company charges a premium for its wood, limiting its market to customers who appreciate the wood’s historic and environmental value.<br>  But Godsall maintains that the Sawfish is not necessarily more expensive than normal cutting. “There should not be a premium on owning a thing you believe in,” he says. “Ninety-nine percent of everything that comes out of [a submerged] forest goes into established markets [at normal market prices].” At the same time, flooded forests can also contain some premium wood, he adds.<br>  Triton is entering the regular market for so-called saw logs (logs large enough to mill into lumber), Godsall says. The company’s present output, mainly strong, desirable Douglas fir, is sold to mills making lumber for flooring, furniture, and construction. In August 2003 the first Sawfish began cutting trees in Lois Lake, British Columbia, a dam impoundment built in the 1930s to power a sawmill. A second Sawfish is under construction.<br>  Given the enormous amount of flooded forestland, Triton plans to both use the Sawfish itself and sell the remote-controlled loggers to other companies at a cost of US$1 million and up. “There are millions and millions of trees underwater in our own backyard, and we’re addressing those with our logging operations,” says Godsall. “But there are underwater forests all around the world that are out of our reach.” <br>  Top<br>  Underwater Logging: Tough, but not Impossible<br>  One Sharp Fish<br>  Cost versus Benefits<br>  The Environmental Payoff<br>  Suggested Reading The Environmental PayoffDrowned logs, sunken trees, and wood from building demolition are all considered rediscovered wood. The environmental promise of using rediscovered wood is to reduce the impact of logging and the attendant road building on forests.<br>  Roads allow an influx of invasive species, and they increase erosion and runoff to surface waters. And roads are very common in forests. According to a 2000 report from the National Center for Policy Analysis titled Banning Roads, Burning Forests, the National Forest System has over 383,000 miles of roads—eight times the mileage of the interstate highway system—on its 192 million acres. Most of these roads were built for timber harvesting, but have since been adopted by recreational forest visitors.<br>  But the environmental benefits of recovering drowned trees are difficult to compare to the standard of being “sustainable” because the trees are not replaced, even though other trees are being drowned by newer dams. Underwater logging can pose an environmental hazard if silt on the drowned logs is distributed into the water. Unlike sawing, the past practice of yanking standing trees from lake beds can pollute the water with sediment, blocking the light needed by aquatic plants.<br>  Some in the forest products industry question the need for underwater logging, noting that forests have been expanding for about a century in the United States. Wengert argues that conventional logging itself may actually be sustainable. “No way are we running out of wood,” he says. “We may be running out of some species, but since 1909, the supply of wood has been increasing [in the United States]. Most forests are sustainable, if you look widely enough. If you look at one county, maybe they will cut half the county. But if you look at a big enough area, [those trees are replaced elsewhere].” Unless it’s developed, he says, forestland continues as forestland.<br>  Perhaps, but Godsall argues that sustainable forestry is still a goal, not a reality, in the industry. “The industry has changed tremendously in the last ten years,” he says. “We have seen a huge capacity building in forestry companies regarding environmental sustainability and responsible engagement [in social issues related to forestry]. But that capacity to understand the issues is not always converted into a collective approach to sustainable forestry.”<br>  SmartWood’s William Timpano, who monitors the movement of certified wood through the production process so manufacturers can place SmartWood’s Rediscovered Wood logo on their products, points out another benefit. “Since this volume of timber is not natural,” he says, “taking the timber out may make for better fish habitat or increase the presence of naturally occurring aquatic fauna.”<br>  With underwater logging,|`|f919cd6df05b49311d93ca1a25b7e533aa	Freshly cut common wood is just that...But what would you find from<br>  the spoils of the BIG WOODS that were clear-cut for the BARRONS<br>  OF YESTERYEAR...in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and elsewhere...?<br>     Perhaps extinct stands of white pine that grew to a hundred feet,<br>  or massive logs of rare walnuts-preserved in the cold depths of rivers and lakes, like Lake Vermillion in Northern Minnesota....|`|fp9bOiVFaa	geoweeg nailed it.

The oil crisis is a crisis of consumption. As oil prices increase, as tar sands become more difficult to process, the price of oil will increase, but so will the incentive for people to work and live in different ways. It will not happen overnight, but if it does then there is still a lot of hope (browse How Cuba Survived Peak Oil) as Cuba showed us in the Special Period.<br>  <br>  We will not lose the technology nor skills we already have, products will be redesigned and advances will be made quickly so that less materials and energy are used.

When there are shortages, the price mechanism ensures that people train to fit those gaps and take advantages of higher wages. The rise in green jobs and technologies is rapid. The gap between the richest and poorest societies is shocking. I agree that there will be some adjustments, lets hope our shift in thinking helps to close that rich/poor gap in the process.|`|5cb5feb035bd6f8ad961e6c52149cc41aa	Doesn't matter if we want to or not like you said, most of us won't be able to afford petroleum products for wasteful uses like pushing a three ton vehicle around to carry one person.    Solar energy from troughs or heat towers can store its energy in molten salt for at least three days, depending on how much storage capacity you want to build into the system.   There is no need for most of the power we use at night.   The high rise buildings in cities don't have to have every light on at all hours of the day- they kill birds because the birds are to stupid to leave the light and go on their way in the darkness- they just fly around until they run out of energy and drop dead.   Street lights are needed because people have such poor night vision (lack of vitamin A in their systems) that they are needed so people aren't running into each other all the time because they can't see well enough.

Highly adapted for life in the water, penguins have countershaded dark and white plumage, and their wings have become flippers. Most penguins feed on krill, fish, squid, and other forms of sealife caught while swimming underwater. They spend about half of their life on land and half in the oceans.<br>  <br>  Although all penguin species are native to the southern hemisphere, they are not found only in cold climates, such as Antarctica. In fact, only a few species of penguin live so far south. Several species are found in the temperate zone, and one species, the Galápagos Penguin, lives near the equator.<br>  <br>  The largest living species is the Emperor Penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri): adults average about 1.1 m (3 ft 7 in) tall and weigh 35 kg (75 lb) or more. The smallest penguin species is the Little Blue Penguin (also known as the Fairy Penguin), which stands around 40 cm tall (16 in) and weighs 1 kg (2.2 lb). Among extant penguins larger penguins inhabit colder regions, while smaller penguins are generally found in temperate or even tropical climates (see also Bergmann's Rule). Some prehistoric species attained enormous sizes, becoming as tall or as heavy as an adult human (see below for more). These were not restricted to Antarctic regions; on the contrary, subantarctic regions harboured high diversity, and at least one giant penguin occurred in a region not quite 2,000 km south of the Equator 35 mya, in a climate decidedly warmer than today.<br>  <br>  Penguins seem to have no special fear of humans and have approached groups of explorers without hesitation. This is probably because penguins have no land predators in Antarctica or the nearby offshore islands. Instead, penguins are at risk at sea from predators such as the leopard seal. Typically, penguins do not approach closer than about 3 meters (10 ft) at which point they become nervous. This is also the distance that Antarctic tourists are told to keep from penguins (tourists are not supposed to approach closer than 3 meters, but are not expected to withdraw if the penguins come closer).<br>  Contents<br>  [hide]<br>  <br>      * 1 Penguin biology<br>            o 1.1 Anatomy<br>            o 1.2 Breeding<br>            o 1.3 Range<br>            o 1.4 Isabelline penguins<br>      * 2 Systematics and evolution<br>            o 2.1 Living species and recent extinctions<br>            o 2.2 Fossil genera<br>            o 2.3 Taxonomy<br>            o 2.4 Evolution<br>                  + 2.4.1 The basal fossils<br>                  + 2.4.2 Palae?udyptines<br>                  + 2.4.3 Origin and systematics of modern penguins<br>                  + 2.4.4 Relationship to other bird orders<br>      * 3 Penguins and humans<br>            o 3.1 Etymology<br>            o 3.2 Penguins in popular culture<br>      * 4 References<br>            o 4.1 Footnotes<br>            o 4.2 Bibliography<br>      * 5 External links<br>  <br>  Penguin biology<br>  <br>  Anatomy<br>  Orcas swim by an iceberg with Adélie penguins in the Ross Sea, Antarctica. The Drygalski ice tongue is visible in the background.<br>  <br>  Penguins are superbly adapted to an aquatic life. Their vestigial wings have become flippers, useless for flight in the air. In the water, however, penguins are astonishingly agile. Within the smooth plumage a layer of air is preserved, ensuring buoyancy. The air layer also helps insulate the birds in cold waters. On land, penguins use their tails and wings to maintain balance for their upright stance.<br>  <br>  All penguins are countershaded for camouflage – that is, they have a white underside and a dark (mostly black) upperside. A predator looking up from below (such as an orca or a leopard seal) has difficulty distinguishing between a white penguin belly and the reflective water surface. The dark plumage on their backs camouflages them from above.<br>  <br>  Diving penguins reach 6 to 12 km/h (3.7 to 7.5 mph), though there are reports of velocities of 27 km/h (17 mph) (which are more realistic in the case of startled flight). The small penguins do not usually dive deep; they catch their prey near the surface in dives that normally last only one or two minutes. Larger penguins can dive deep in case of need. Dives of the large Emperor Penguin have been recorded which reach a depth of 565 m (1,870 ft) and last up to 22 minutes.<br>  <br>  Penguins either waddle on their feet or slide on their bellies across the snow, a movement called "tobogganing", which conserves energy while moving quickly. They also jump with both feet together if they want to move more quickly or cross steep or rocky terrain.<br>  <br>  Penguins have an average sense of hearing for birds;[1] this is used by parents and chicks to locate one another in crowded colonies.[2] Their eyes are adapted for underwater vision, and are their primary means of locating prey and avoiding predators; in air it has been suggested that they are nearsighted, although research has not supported this hypothesis.[3]<br>  <br>  Global warming is the increase in the average temperature of the Earth's near-surface air and the oceans since the mid-twentieth century and its projected continuation. Global surface temperature increased 0.74 ± 0.18 °C (1.33 ± 0.32 °F) during the 100 years ending in 2005.[1] The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concludes that anthropogenic greenhouse gases are responsible for most of the observed temperature increase since the middle of the twentieth century,[1] and natural phenomena such as solar variation and volcanoes probably had a small warming effect from pre-industrial times to 1950 and a small cooling effect from 1950 onward.[2][3] These basic conclusions have been endorsed by 30 scientific societies and academies of science, including all of the national academies of science of the major industrialized countries.[4][5]<br>  <br>  Climate model projections summarized in the latest IPCC report indicate that global surface temperature will likely rise a further 1.1 to 6.4 °C (2.0 to 11.5 °F) during the twenty-first century.[1] The uncertainty in this estimate arises from the use of models with differing climate sensitivity, and the use of differing estimates of future greenhouse gas emissions. Some other uncertainties include how warming and related changes will vary from region to region around the globe. Although most studies focus on the period up to 2100, warming is expected to continue after 2100, even in the absence of new emissions, because of the large heat capacity of the oceans and the lifespan of CO2 in the atmosphere.[6][7][8]<br>  <br>  Increasing global temperature will cause sea levels to rise and will change the amount and pattern of precipitation, likely including an expanse of the subtropical desert regions.[9] Other likely effects include Arctic shrinkage and resulting Arctic methane release, shrinkage of the Amazon rainforest, increases in the intensity of extreme weather events, changes in agricultural yields, modifications of trade routes, glacier retreat, species extinctions and changes in the ranges of disease vectors.<br>  <br>  Political and public debate continues regarding the appropriate response to global warming. The available options are mitigation to reduce further emissions; adaptation to reduce the damage caused by warming; and, more speculatively, geoengineering to reverse global warming. Most national governments have signed and ratified the Kyoto Protocol aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions.<br>  Contents<br>  [hide]<br>  <br>      * 1 Greenhouse effect<br>      * 2 Forcing and feedback<br>            o 2.1 Solar variation<br>            o 2.2 Feedback<br>      * 3 Temperature changes<br>            o 3.1 Recent<br>            o 3.2 Pre-human climate variations<br>      * 4 Climate models<br>      * 5 Attributed and expected effects<br>            o 5.1 Environmental<br>            o 5.2 Economic<br>      * 6 Adaptation and mitigation<br>            o 6.1 Mitigation<br>      * 7 Economic and political debate<br>      * 8 Related climatic issues<br>      * 9 See also<br>      * 10 References<br>      * 11 Further reading<br>      * 12 External links<br>  <br>  Greenhouse effect<br>  <br>      Main articles: Greenhouse gas and Greenhouse effect<br>  <br>  The causes of the recent warming are an active field of research. The scientific consensus[10][11] is that the increase in atmospheric greenhouse gases due to human activity has caused most of the warming observed since the start of the industrial era, and the observed warming cannot be satisfactorily explained by natural causes alone.[12] This attribution is clearest for the most recent 50 years, which is the period when most of the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations took place and for which the most complete measurements exist.<br>  <br>  The greenhouse effect was discovered by Joseph Fourier in 1824[13] and first investigated quantitatively by Svante Arrhenius in 1896. It is the process by which absorption and emission of infrared radiation by atmospheric gases warm a planet's lower atmosphere and surface. Existence of the greenhouse effect as such is not disputed. The question is instead how the strength of the greenhouse effect changes when human activity increases the atmospheric concentrations of particular greenhouse gases.<br>  Recent increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). The monthly CO2 measurements display small seasonal oscillations in an overall yearly uptrend; each year's maximum is reached during the Northern Hemisphere's late spring, and declines during the Northern Hemisphere growing season as plants remove some CO2 from the atmosphere.<br>  <br>  Naturally occurring greenhouse gases have a mean warming effect of about 33 °C (59 °F), without which Earth would be uninhabitable.[14][15] On Earth the major greenhouse gases are water vapor, which causes about 36–70 percent of the greenhouse effect (not including clouds); carbon dioxide (CO2), which causes 9–26 percent; methane (CH4), which causes 4–9 percent; and ozone, which causes 3–7 percent.[16][17]<br>  <br>  Human a|`|P6I7cflnaa	Habitat: the Antarctic Ice Belt.<br>  <br>  why does global warming affect it?: <br>  Global warming makes the ice to melt and this destroys their habitat.
