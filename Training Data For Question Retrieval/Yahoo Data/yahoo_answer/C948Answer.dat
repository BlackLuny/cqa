However, if your state offers a state tax deduction for investing in your home state plan you could open a 529 plan, get the state tax deduction and then be able to use the money for qualified higher education expenses.  Most plans don't have a waiting period between when you contribute money and when you withdrawal it.
CJvHQl5vaa	If you fire him for cause, he doesn't get unemployment benefits.  If you lay him off (reduce staff) then he is eligible for unemployment benefits.    If you lay him off in order for him to collect unemployment benefits instead of work a job which you aren't reducing, that can constitute fraud.  You would be defrauding your unemployment insurance because you are claiming that he is being laid off when in fact he's been fired because he is not a competent employee.  This kind of fraud is rarely questioned, but it can be questioned.    Furthermore, I hope you realize that if a former employee files an unemployment claim that is accepted by the unemployment office, your unemployment insurance goes WAY up.  What your employee is requesting will cost you and your business money.    I should add that you should document more than one violation of policy or document a few acts of negligence on his part before you fire him so that you can prove to unemployment that he was not doing his job correctly.|`|Grmsgziaaa	You could lessen his hours, make his job more stressful so he will want to quit.

I think if he is damaging your ability to serve your customers or efficiently run your business you have little choice in the matter.  I dont think this should be a test of wills.  If you fire him he will receive benefits he has paid into the system for 30 years and the guy obviousl;y needs help so what can you really do.    If you want to keep playing this game keep him  otherwise fire him.  Whether or not he wants it he is incompetent.|`|Zbn8A7Geaa	I don't think you can collect unemployment if you're fired for cause.  You might want to check into the unemployment laws for your state a little bit further.  He might can file for wrongful termination, but if you've kept records of his employment history and job performance (and he's as bad as you say), you should win the argument.    Sounds like your employee is guilty of Gross Misconduct so probably wouldn't be allowed benefits in most states.   But it depends on your individual State's laws.    This is Maryland's law on collecting unemployment when fired:    DISCHARGED FROM EMPLOYMENT - There are three levels of misconduct in the Maryland Unemployment Insurance Law.    Simple Misconduct - If you were discharged or suspended for simple misconduct in connection with the work.  Benefits are denied from 5 to 10 weeks from the week that includes your last day of work.    Gross Misconduct - If you were discharged or suspended for gross misconduct in connection with the work (serious or repeated violations of employment rules or expected standards of behavior could be considered gross misconduct).   Benefits are denied until you become re-employed and earn 20 times your Weekly Benefit Amount in insured  work.    Aggravated Misconduct - If you were discharged or suspended for aggravated misconduct in connection with the work (malicious, deliberate acts meant to cause physical harm, property loss or damage could be considered aggravated misconduct).  Benefits are denied until you become re-employed and earn 30 times your Weekly Benefit Amount in insured work.|`|5f6XnInEaa	If I were the boss, I'd severely demote him into a job so miserable, so he'd want to quit.

zmwOjHiLaa	hi  sorry to hear that your husband is losing his job. your husband  having been employed with this firm for over 20 years will get the maximum notice period of 12 weeks and if made to work this notice is allowed to go for job interviews within reason during this period by law.  any days holiday that he has accrued must also be paid to him but is taxable as is notice pay.  for every year that he has been employed over 2 years up to 20 years which is the maximum  amount of years that will be paid out for redundancy, he will get 1 weeks pay for each year employed and depending on when he started with them over the age of 42 will get   11/2 weeks for every year and this money is not taxable.  as the company is only paying out the minimum which is around 330-350  for each year .  notice pay = 12 x normal pay  holiday =  days ? x normal pay  redundancy = 20 x minimum allowance  if he works for a good company they might also pay a good service payment = ? as to how much that would be as that depends on the company and if they do it.  hope this helps give you an idea of how much he will get and wish you all the best.|`|69660f8cb6408b3f65f3fbe18f701800aa	Hi there, I've just been made redundant today :(    So I've been looking on the net and here's a redundancy calculator http://www.berr.gov.uk/whatwedo/employme...    Or a good site with information is: http://www.armchairadvice.co.uk/leavingw...

sI3krJULaa	If you want to do them yourself you'll need these forms:    1040  Schedule C (for your freelance work)  Schedule SE (for the self-employment tax you'll owe on that freelance income)  Form 8863    The same forms as above in your state forms for the state you earned all of this income in.  You'll also need just the basic state version of the 1040 for whatever that rogue W-2  is for (if you actually worked in that other state- otherwise, it doesn't matter where they're paying you from, it only matters what state you actually worked in- that's where you report your income.  So if you only worked in one state during the whole year, then you only report to that one state.)    However, your taxes are more complicated than most, so you may want to seriously consider seeing a CPA or at least a little shop like H&R Block.  If you want to purchase software, that would make it a little easier, but that's still going to run you around $100 at least.  And you have to pay extra to have them submit your return for you.    Hope that helps. :0)|`|AA10469473	If your total joint income is mid-40s or less, look for a VITA or TCE site in your area - they'll do your taxes for free.  See http://www.irs.gov/individuals/article/0...    If that doesn't work for you, Turbo Tax probably would.  It's possible to do them just on the forms, but TT will make it easier|`|DSLlioPcaa	According to the descriptions above, you probably have to prepare Forms 1040, Schedule A, Schedule C and other forms bassed on your circumstances. In addition, you not only have to prepare a state tax return in your state but another state tax return on income from that state.    If you have no experience in preparing tax returns, it is best advised that you hire someone to prepare your tax returns and pay for them. The amount you paid to the tax preparer will be deductible in your next years tax. Or you could purchase a tax software and do it yourself. But unless you know "what's deductible" you could miss the inclusion of items you would be allowed. Turbo Tax, for an additional charge, offers a software "It's deductible." So, you pay for the tax preparation software, plus the additional software download.    Inquire from your friends and co-workers and find a reputable tax preparer. Be sure to ask for their fees and years of experience (qualifications) in order to make a sound decision.|`|QT8vmBfsaa	get a professional|`|snh9wzpnaa	Nobody has been taught this stuff.  That is why about half of returns are done by professionals.  Check out this video:http://youtube.com/?v=fympcTM_btY|`|LWvh2g2maa	Easy.  Go to http://www.irs.gov/efile/article/0,,id=1... and they will guide you to a website that'll help you file your taxes.  It'll most likely be free to file your federal taxes and there might be a small fee to file your state taxes.  Whichever website you choose will ask you questions, choose the forms you will need and fill in the information for you.  All you have to do is answer their questions.  It'll even check to make sure you didn't miss anything.  It's really much easier that you think.  I've done my taxes just like that for years and by myself too.  Your taxes only start getting difficult when you own houses and investments and such.  I was never taught either and you really don't need to waste your money on a professional.|`|SV7jJJbVaa	ask your parents|`|Xf3ixVWTaa	Get people.

DdAjuZp8aa	A short sale is pretty much when a seller is facing a foreclosure. And the seller may have a deal with the lender to accept less than they owe on the property. In an effort to avoid foreclosure and any more damage to the homeowners credit, they try to sell the home to pay off the loan. I wouldn't recommend buying a short sale though.|`|EXJfoGtAaa	As the previous posts say it's a sale where the property is being sold for less than the mortgage balance, with the mortgagees (lender) approval.  However, I disagree with their recommendation to stay away from them.  Why?  As a buyer this is an opportunity for you to buy a home that is usually priced under market value.  Closing can take a little longer, but it's worth the wait.  This is not something you and the seller should attempt without professional help.  Most short sales are listed with realtors, but you do want a realtor that represents buyers.  It won't cost you anything because the commission is still paid by the seller through the listing agent.    realtor.sailor|`|No4heFd0aa	A short sale is a home that the owners are trying to sell before they actually go into foreclosure. I would not reccommend trying to buy a home that is short sale because the banks are very particular and it takes longer then a conventional sale, because the bank in a Short sale is the bank that previously carried the loan for the previous owners and are trying not to lose money on the deal while trying to help the owners not foreclose.

AA11284831	No, that income is not subject to US taxation under your visa status.  Should you become a lawful permanent resident though it WILL become taxable at that point.|`|DSLlioPcaa	It is in the IRS Code that "worldwide income is inclusive" on the US tax returns. You declare all foreign income in your US tax returns but at the same time you could take deductions on the foreign taxes you paid on those income.

It is the "seller's market", i.e. there are more applicants than there are jobs, so potential employers may not be very responsive. I would keep looking for other opportunities. Maybe you want to contact this employer again after several days by phone or email. But keep looking around. Wish you best of luck. You sound liek an energetic and motivated person, so you will find something soon so long as you keep your options open.|`|IB2V5t1Oaa	Do you know the name of the person who interviewed you?

If not, the only other thing you can do is wait.|`|peherxTzaa	If they are ignoring your phone calls they most likely will not hire you. I would suggest looking for a new job there lose really. You never want to be to pushy with people. If they said they'd call you and then didn't then they are looking for someone else.

7igxiGrAaa	There are all sorts of ways for your identity to be stolen. Whoever has stolen pieces of your identity is perfectly capable of accessing your credit information. If they have your name and social security number the rest is easy. Google opens the world to all sorts of information including phone numbers and addresses. You can even get complete background checks on people using the internet if you wanted to pay a few bucks.    People can watch you every step you take, so yes it is possible they could steal your information if you went to the ATM. They wouldn't get the juicy stuff but they could get your card number and your pin number. Always check who's around when you go to use your ATM card so that you are out of eyesight when you enter your pin. And try not to let the person take your card to swipe it. It is much safer to swipe it yourself. When people take your card they could be doing any number of things with it.    For instance you pay with your credit card at a restuarant and they take the card to ring you up. Right then and there when they walk away they have your full name, the card number, and the security code on the back of the card. All they need to do when they go home is google your address and then they can use your card online to buy things.    When they take a card from you even at a counter and slide it through, it could be slid through a black market slider that stores all your credit information. I had this happen to me at a gas station, Wachovia told me this is one of the ways they may have gotten my credit information.    It is unfortunate that there are people out there like this. You need to just be extra careful. Try doing some research into LifeLock. They claim to protect you  from identity theft - I cannot vouch for them so please do your own investigating.    Also many credit card companies and banks over identity theft coverage, even insurance compies like Allstate may have policies to help protect you in the case of identity theft.|`|9alN3sCTaa	good question. dont know.|`|AA10405438	Yes, if they have all the information.|`|f9f27Cmhaa	Somebody who works in a job that pulls credit reports can do it pretty easily.  Go try to buy a car, and see how easy it is for them to pull your credit.    Otherwise, they would need your name, SSN, and some other information, including possibly employers and information about open accounts, etc.  Not exactly easy, but somebody could acquire this information about somebody if they really tried.    Refusing to use an ATM card is kind of in the realm of paranoia, though..|`|RXSu3VNdaa	not legal but possible|`|56cc394478fb2da248d18f7362c43195aa	I'll need your social security number to answer this question.|`|LaUouVtfaa	I think they need your social to check your credit. If someone besides you knows your social, there's your problem.|`|Tyqj8jyVaa	Well with the correct information they most certainly can but it is highly illegal.|`|REC4YgOuaa	If that person knows all your information than yeah they can. What you need to get is something called LifeLock, and they protect all your information from being obtained.
LhEoVly0aa	not that i know of, but most will accept a postal order, that way you dont have to use your bank...in case you dont know what a postal order is...you tell them in post office how much you want postal order for, theres a small charge on top, it looks like a cheque. If ever you receive one (ie off ebay etc) you take to post office and they exchange for cash straight over counter, you can even bank same as a cheque, hope this helps.|`|AA10072911	If the account is already in collections then the damage is already done to your credit.  I would say you should withdraw the money to your checking account and get the account out of overdraft before the bank sends your account to collections as well.  But to answer your question, your best bet is to request that PayPal mail you a check and then take that check to Wal-Mart have it cashed.  Just keep in mind that you are going to be paying a fee to have the check cashed, and you will have to bring your checking account out of overdraft eventually.

SIhxrxD3aa	veterinary schools (note spelling) don't care or even see what you took in high school.  You don't go straight into vet school from high school.  You first have to take pre-vet courses and usually you'll need a bachelor's degree.  You might be a little behind some other pre-vet students since you don't have as much science background, but if you can do well in your college science courses then that's good.    Business courses will teach you everything you need to know.  They will teach you about the stock market and equity and all that stuff.  So, don't worry that you don't know enough now.      You don't need to decide now which one you want to do.  You can always get a business degree and take the pre-vet courses at the same time and then go to vet school (if you want to).  If you decide not to go to vet school, then you'll still have your business degree.  Your degree doesn't have to be a science degree to get into vet school.  You just have to take the science courses that the school requires.  Vet schools actually like people with business degrees because most vets are business owners.      You also need to go and shadow in a vet clinic for a while.  This will help you decide if veterinary medicine is right for you.  It's a very competitive process getting accepted into vet school and if you're not a science person then it might not be for you.    Interesting fact though, you can still run a vet clinic even if you're not a veterinarian.  Many clinics out there are owned and/or managed by someone who is not a DVM.  The veterinarians would work for you.  So, if you're interested in veterinary medicine and business, but don't think you're that great at science or you don't get in then consider this option.|`|Ln0GzbAnaa	mabey do some extra credit for  your grades and mabey going to animal shelter to help out animals to put on your application for college like voulantary and for bussiness you could problly buy stock market and bussiness for dummies hope that helps you g luck

oFiGyMWraa	A cash buyer is one who can fund the purchase themselves, without the need for a mortgage. Sometimes its an owner who has paid their mortgage off and is not taking another one on, or it could be a business such as a property developer.     The advantage for you is that it is one less reason why the sale will fall through, and it will usually be quicker, possibly without a chain. However, because a cash buyer does not need to go through the hassle of applying for a mortgage they can pull out more easily. They also know its an advantage for you and may try to negotiate a lower price.    The adverts in the paper are usually aimed at people on the verge of repossession. They are "cash" buyers because they are businesses with funds available. This means you can sell very quickly to pay off your mortgage before you are repossessed. The negative is they expect to get a discount of about 20% below the normal market value.    Generally they offer to rent the house back to you so that you don't even have to move out. That is OK, but there have been cases recently where these companies have gone bust taking your home with them. Also, I have heard stories of unscrupulous companies that evict you after a few months and sell the house for a tidy profit.|`|FHOu4cphaa	ask u accountant|`|AA11964031	What else would you selling it for?

It depends if you really need to sell your house.|`|ZEwAalKPaa	I am not sure really just what you are getting at here.  When they talk about selling a house for cash, all it means is that the prospective buyer actually has the money to pay for it without waiting to sell their present home or applying for a mortgage. In the present house sale doldrums a genuine 'cash' buyer is a godsend - no chain and quick sale!   But cash buyers are also aware of this and any cash buyer will be looking for a good discount off the asking price.    If you think buying 'for cash' means the buyer hands you a suitcase full of 50 notes it does not work like that.  If you have a mortgage your solicitor receives the funds as usual from the buyers solicitor, pays off the outstanding amount of your mortgage, the bank/building society then release the deeds to the sellers solicitor with your mortgage charge cancelled out.  If there is anything left over, you get it.

pNy8lakjaa	When renting you need first months rent, last month's rent and a security deposit equal to one month's rent when signing the lease.    I would recommend getting a wireless connection if you are going to have all those computers set up. You can easily get one that allows for wired connections too for the desktop computers.     Also you might want to think about getting uber basic cable, that normally is around 15 bucks a month (Time Warner Cable is that cheap) for your TV too, and its just the basic local channels. I pay 65 for uber basic cable and the high speed internet, and that is the normal price, no deals or gimmicks.     I would also recommend getting on the budget plan with your utilities so it won't be a scary unknown bill every month, if you have to pay for heat, but if you just have to pay electric, its normally only 15 to 30 bucks a month depending on your company.    For furniture, I would highly recommend scouring www.craigslist.org for deals in your area, and don't forget you will need kitchen stuff too, if your dorm doesn't include one.     I remember moving out of the dorms, it can be scary, but it can be amazingly fun too!

AA10469473	No it isn't income, and no it doesn't come out of your refund, which is whatever it would have been if there had been no stimulus package or checks.  The exception is if you didn't qualify last year, but qualify based on your 2008 return, you'd receive the stimulus payment added to your refund.    Unfortunately, many of the tax software designers took a short cut and calculated the stimulus into your refund for 2008 automatically, then have you subtract it back out if you got it last year.  This is causing massive confusion among people who think it's being subtracted from their refunds - it's only being subtracted if it shouldn't have been there in the first place this year since you already got it last year.|`|SAgCy83Oaa	No and No|`|c574927bbdbb7966d29ab45874fd33dbaa	The rebate is a rebate. It is not taxable income. You will not have to pay taxes on this money.    The last time the federal government issued checks, back in 2001,the stimulus was indeed an advance, of sorts, on the Bush administration's tax cuts. The bottom line went from 15 percent 10 percent. So, maybe folks are assuming that it is the same this time. It is not. This was not an advance on this year's refund.|`|BoAEgaAGaa	It is not deducted from this years refund.  The amount you received last year is used to determine if you received all you were eligible for last year.  There are cases where taxpayers did not receive it all due to too much income, too little tax liability, or they have an additional child on the 2008 tax return.      If asked in a tax program enter the exact amount you received so the program can figure if you received all you were eligible for.  The IRS will back this up with their own records.

Go to http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040x.pd... to print out the form and mail the completed form w/ any documentation (you cannot e-file a 1040X).    I would suggest waiting @ least a couple weeks until you're certain the IRS has completed processing of your 2008 return, as sending in the amended return too soon may cause confusion for the IRS.|`|wQJBFcluaa	Yes but you will have to file a 1040x.1040x is an amended tax return.|`|ajcSwpVJaa	does this mean you will be sending me a cup of coffee? :)|`|57nT5ubbaa	I think you will have to file a 1040x which is an amended 1040 and I doubt that you will be able to claim the EIC funds.
4ZNl4V3Oaa	Nope!  Anything that passes now will apply to 2009.  The $500/$1,000 cut will reduce withholding rates so you'd see an additional $10/$20 per week in your take home pay if you work full time.    Retroactive tax cuts are a nightmare.  It's not going to happen!|`|fSlZQzS4aa	No.  If anything is retroactive, your account will be adjusted.|`|snh9wzpnaa	It is too late for them to tack them on to 2008 taxes.  It will have to be a summer thing.  This is almost a carbon copy of what happened last year - Congress debated it, passed it about Feb 1 and gave it to us in the summer.  If we learned anything from last year, you will get it quicker if you direct deposit this year's refund than if you get a paper check or one of the rapid refunds from Block or JH.|`|AA10469473	It's not for last year, so go ahead and file.  What they are looking at is a cut for 2009 - withholding tables would be adjusted to take out $10 a week less during 2009, then the rates would reflect that when you file next year for 2009.    It's not a rebate check like last year, by the way.

AA11639059	I'm glad it is B of A and not US Bank.     I opened an account at US Bank several years ago when I got suckered into a scam business offer. I called the bank and asked them to close the account and was told they would take care of it, which by this time had only about $8. A year later, the still unclosed account (US Bank has fees for everything, so I figured they didn't send me my money because some fee ate it all) got charged $19.95 for some supposed purchase to a Bombay, India industrial supplier of plastics and related materials (I obviously did not buy a few barrels of plastic molding resin with $20). US Bank did not check my file and since my shop was closed down they had no business address and since they didn't consult their file they neglected to see my home address, and since they didn't consult the phone directory where I was the only one listed with that name, they started charging me for bounced check charges daily, and a special weekly charge weekly, plus a returned notice fee two or three months of, and closed my account when they had racked up a bill of some thing close to $300. Then they sold it to a collection agency (and forgot to record which one). Then almost three years later a collection agency which had the same name as a Russian investment house that caters to insurance companies, mutual funds, and "persons of means" began to call me and order that I cough up $500 that I "owe them." Well they really weren't Russians, they had some little shop in Colorado and added the word "solutions" to the name of the Russian investment advisors name but didn't add that word when they identified themselves by phone.    So US Bank insists that since I didn't call to straighten this out in 60 days of the erroneous bill and since they didn't have any receipt of the transaction, they can't help me (and they still don't know who they sold the debt to) and since the collection company isn't forthcoming with the source of their alleged debt, I'm going to have to pay an attorney to get them to cough up details and pursue the matter, which will probably cost me more than the supposed $500 the vultures want.    While your bank is not US Bank, Bank of America is having problems too (in case you've followed a little bit of the news in recent months). In short, Either personally go to a branch and close the account or add some more substantial amount of funds. Just a suggestion.|`|jw8Pwe1Naa	There are many different types of chequing accounts, even at Bank of America. I would advise you to do some online research at the bank's website. If you have no luck with that, you should phone your local branch and they should be able to help you! Good luck, and don't spend the eleven bucks all at once! :)|`|Vliaa3QUaa	Talk to the account representatives at your bank; they can answer the questions in regards to your specific checking account. There are many different types of accounts at different banks, some have minimum balances to avoid fees, some of them have no minimum, etc.     Outside of that, if you have $11 in your account for a prolonged period of time and have NO activity in the account, chances are that eventually it would get closed out for non-use.     Most banks won't close out your accounts if they have a balance unless they have been unused for a long period of time.

AA12178731	MONEY LAUNDERING: Money laundering is the process by which criminals attempt to hide and disguise the true origin and ownership of the proceeds of their criminal activities.    In other way money laundering is the criminal practice of filtering ill-gotten gains of dirty money through a series of transactions, so that the funds are cleaned to look like proceeds from legal activities     CONSEQUENCES OF MONEY LAUNDERING:    ? Makes crime a profitable enterprise  ? Damages market integrity  ? Deters foreign investment  ? Corruption undermines good governance  ? Contaminates the industry  ? Uneven playing field for honest business  ? Laundered funds often untaxed income  ? Risks for financial institutions.|`|w9J25hq9aa	Money laundering is when some one takes money that is traced or made illegally and then gives then clean money. It can be a felony.
obK0EM5gaa	Cut her some slack "Oh Boy"..    That was pretty harsh. Did you consider the fact that nowadays the country is in a recession so not everyone can AFFORD to buy their own insurance?? Or that some employers may cut it out or give a crappy plan & she can't be choosy about where she works?? Or it's a possibility that she's got good health insurance and this was a deductible or copay...Even WITH health insurance, you can drown in medical bills. And from what I gather she isn't saying that OTHER taxpayers are paying her medical bills, she's saying she'll loose her refund to offset past due medical bills that she wouldn't have had if she hadn't been a victim of crime.     I don't know what to tell you. I think I understand what you are saying, and you probably feel like the hospital does..."Not my fault, shouldn't get stuck with the bill" ...You could possibly try to call your state tax office and ask them what can be done about it.     Best of luck :)    IEDIT: It's a possibility. All I know to tell you is call the hospital and ask...Call the collection agency if you got a notice from one..Ask them if they'll set up a payment plan. If not ask the state tax office. If all that falls through, try to appeal it with the state.|`|AA11897249	So instead of you paying your bills the taxpayers should have their hard earned money taxed to pay for your health care because you were too cheap to buy health insurance or you were too stupid to have a job that provides health insurance.

f9a39482114c5f9844fc5040ac337bd4aa	If preferred shares are cumulative, it means you have to make good any arrears in the next year(s) before you can pay dividends to common stockholders.    There are 5,000 shares of 5% $100 par value cumulative preferred stock which means that preferred dividends each year should be $100 x 5% x 5,000 = $25,000. In 2006 Amy declared only $20,000 of cash dividends, i.e. there's arrears of $5,000 to be made good next year.    In 2007 Amy declared $52,000 of cash dividends. Out of this, $5,000 would go to the preferred stockholders for 2006, then $25,000 should go to the preferred stockholders for 2007 itself, leaving $22,000 for the common stockholders. So the answer is  D. preferred $30,000, common $22,000.
f9a39482114c5f9844fc5040ac337bd4aa	The company issued 5,000 shares of 5% $100 par value cumulative preferred stock.

On December 31, 2006 Amy declared $30,000 of cash dividends. $25,000 would go to the preferred stockholders, leaving $5,000 for the common stockholders. So the answer is    A. preferred $25,000, common $5,000    You got it right.

I was pretty surprised at that since I always thought of UoP as a joke. But I guess having any MBA is better than having none.  Also, everyone has more or less heard of UoP even if they don't know anything about how good they are, so I supposed it might be better than getting a degree from some local school that no one has heard about.
qBCGH52haa	When someone says they lost it all, they mean they lost everything they had invested (although technically you can lose more than you invested in cash if you use a margin account which is like borrowing money to invest),    In order to invest, you must use a stock broker - you can't buy stocks without one (with the exception of using a DRIP although you still need the broker for the initial investment).  There are two types of brokers - full service and discount.  Full service brokers provide research, opinions, etc.  Discount brokers like eTrade provide trading facilities only.    So, if you were to want  to buy stock in IBM, you would open an account (send them money) and then place the order to buy, say 20 shares of IBM at $50.  You would need to have a little over $1,000 in the account to do this trade, since since there will be a commission (say $7 to $10 at the discount broker and more at a full-service broker).    All this can be done online at places like eTrade (each system is a little different so specifics of a trade can't be provided here).    In this case, if IBM went bankrupt, you would lose the cost of the stock plus the commission.|`|bfa5e0b2aa86c9ae1c884c351880a0bdaa	your losses are limited to amount invested|`|jw8Pwe1Naa	You have it exactly right.

Pjm9pg7iaa	Yield to maturity is what you get as your return if you wait the entire period. 30 years on a Treasury bond. Since there is a long time involved, the market rates are higher. Because the future in 30 years is much more unknown than the future in 4 weeks (the shortest T-bill investment for the general public).  The present value of the 30 year bond is face value on the day it is issued. If you paid $1,000, it is worth that much. But if interest rates drop tomorrow, the value (price) of the bond has increased because you made such a smart decision to lock in a high rate. People will pay more to buy your smart investment..

I can not find a company that has good products where I can make a good profit.  Most of the items are not at wholesale price.  I could buy the stuff cheaper at Sears or Walmart.    Some companies charge $300 to join.  That is just too much, especially when they are the ones making the big profit off of the products you sale.  The thing about SMC is that most of it is junk.    Another bad thing that I found was there are hundreds of people using the same drop shippers.  I found 10 of the same item listed on ebay with the same picture from the same drop shipper and nobody was bidding on any of them.  Also, you can't just set up a bunch of auctions on ebay and hope they sell.  Ebay will charge you even if it doesn't sell.  Then you are stuck losing money.    Research is the key to making money on ebay.  You have to know what people are looking for and what they are paying.  90% of the folks on ebay are looking for a deal, so you have to get a good price on the item.  I used http://www.nextag.com/ to research actual retail prices on items.  Ebay has a lot of good research tools.  This page tells the most popular products in each category.  http://product-index.ebay.com/best_selli...  If you click on items it will take you to a page that tells you what people are paying for them on ebay.    I recommend going to local actions to find deals on items to sale.  The thing is "if it sounds to good to be true, it is."  That is how I feel about drop shippers.  There is never a really easy way to make money.  If there were, then everybody would be doing it.|`|d05b366085d8773ec7654e3ad2b991cdaa	Forget SMC.  eBay has lists of drop shippers to which they allow registered business users access.

Not every case can be expunged. Every state has its own requirements that have to be met before a criminal record can be expunged. Contrary to popular belief, records are not "sealed" automatically with the passage of time, but require the filing of a petition with the court requesting the expungement and stating the reasons you are requesting it and how you meet the criteria set by law. The procedure can take between three months to almost a year depending upon the Court and the severity of the case. The fees are usually very reasonable, in the neighborhood of $2,000 to $2,500.00, and include research, filing fees, the drafting of the Petition, and any Court appearances. If you are not versed in this area of law, or feel you cannot handle this even with doing your own legal research, a criminal defense attorney would be able to do this for you.

3OeE8kMQaa	Tricky tricky.... There are a couple of questions you need to ask yourself:  1. How do you think your boss/company will deal with it? Do you have a good relationship with your boss? If they do give the other company permission to interview you, and you don't get the job, do you think your current employer will retaliate?  2. Do you want, and more importantly think you will be hired at the new company enough to risk upsetting your boss?    If you feel comfortable, bring it to your boss as a new opportunity that you would like to explore, but you have not made up your mind to leave. Make sure they know it was something that you were presented with and not something you were actively looking for.     If there is someone you trust at your current position ask their opinion. Make sure that you have their absolute confidence, as it would be really bad if your boss heard a rumor before you are able to talk to he/she yourself.

wM0Jce76aa	With credit being equal in that most foreclosures aren't going to consider a pre-approved buyer anyway, they start with the highest bidder. If you don't happen to be the highest bidder they will keep you "on file" as a back up if you choose. Most lenders list the asking price well below comparable, that doesn't mean you can't make an offer lower (and get accepted!) but when other offers are in play it always come back to them cutting their losses.    There is no formula for an offering price on a foreclosure home. You have done your homework--finding out the previous sale price and the balance left on the loan. That info, and the knowledge that it will take at least $30,000 to get it in shape, is the best basis for an offer. Just working the numbers, it looks like the asking price is in line with what the property will be worth when the work is completed. Here is the wild card--not everyone can get the money, in today's restricted lending scene, to buy the home and do the required work. That should limit the number of people interested, but just in the last 10 days, the real estate market seems to be waking from a nap, largely because of the low interest rates. Good luck on your planned purchase.|`|YkseyT7zaa	If they don't accept - too low|`|VELnLnIKaa	foreclosed homes are already being let go under market value no more than maybe 3 percent of the asking price if your lucky|`|dcd11iUwaa	id ask for $30,00 below asking price.  that seems fair for a property on the market for that night.|`|xQ7O0QZyaa	The questoin to you should be what is the Maximum you are willing to pay for the house.

ghelbcVFaa	At your age you may be doing all you can. You have two credit cards, which is fine. Use them, if only for one tank of gas per month, then pay them off IN FULL each month. You are correct in not closing any accounts. It's ok to open them if you'd like, one or two more may help a little, just don't close any. Closing accounts does hurt your credit.    If you haven't done so order your three credit reports www.annualcreditreport.com and go through them with a fine tooth comb. If there is negative information either work with the company to pay it off, or if it's not yours dispute it through the credit bureaus as well as sending a demand of verification letter to the creditor.     691 is not at all bad. Your first loan, assuming on-time payments will help quite a bit as well. Make sure it's a smaller loan, say a car loan over a mortgage. Then when you get your mortgage you will be getting the best rate possible. For a car loan you are probably at or near the prime zone. For a mortgage 720 and above should be your goal. If you are looking at a mortgage expect to pay 0.25%-0.50% above the best rates. Also, when you are getting a loan, point out your age and your score. A significant part of your score may be simply that you are too young to have significant loans.

You can't changed the locks or take possession without court action.  A possible exception is if the tenant has abandoned the unit.    realtor.sailor|`|fa49fc3460e0c0dfb37b6cda6aa1dd56aa	1.  Yes Texas law allows the landlord to seize property for unpaid rent...no court order is required.  There are many exception of what can be seized...so read up on Texas landlord/tenant law. They have a list of what can and can not be taken.    2.  No you can not change the lock without a court order.|`|DOgW8MHCaa	my dad had to do this but we live in michigan.

You need to go to your county courthouse and get the proper paperwork to proceed withan eviction an if you are confused retain an Attorney to handle It for you,If you lock them out absent a court ordered eviction and they call the Police you will be in big trouble and they will end up in their for many months without paying rent|`|i65oHtFsaa	You can't change locks but you can do a lockout for nonpayment of rent. I use to work in Texas from 04-06 and I remember we had silver locks that fit over the doorknob. That forced the resident to come in and talk to us. Legally you can't keep the lock on and you have to let them back in but it at least gets them to come in and talk to you. You can also take property as collateral but we never used that option because it just seemed like too much trouble. I remember we were part of the apartment association and they had forms that you had to use when taking property. When I first moved to Texas my coworkers told me about these procedures and I talked to the apartment association to verify that they were legal. Every state varies on its laws so just do your research and make sure you follow the law precisely to avoid and trouble down the road.
YQ1Q7XeEaa	I wouldn't call.  I would go see the boss in person.      According to your question you screwed up pretty badly and the chances are slim that she will even listen to you so you must make a good impression from the start.    Show up when it is not busy and be wearing a decent outfit (Slacks and a nice shirt).    Apologize for your behavior when you worked there before as well as how much harder it made her life dealing with your absences.  Do not make excuses (But I really was sick!) unless she asks for them.    Follow your own suggestion and tell her you realize what an idiot you were before and you have turned over a new leaf and would like the opportunity to prove it to her.  Let her know why you want to work there again - and don't say "because I need a job."  Give her some good reasons why you like the place.  Humbly ask for her to consider re-hiring you.    By the way, if she says "no" then take it with dignity.  Thank her for her time and wish her and the restaurant well. - That could leave the door open in the future maybe.

AA11897249	We already have a market.  Maybe your question is should CDS trade on a central exchange with unified clearing and a single counter party.<br>  <br>  I say yes.  Despite the recent problems with CDS, CDS are very useful for those who need to hedge against someone defaulting.  For example, say an axle manufacturer has reached a deal with GM to sell axles to GM and get paid over the next 5 years.  In this case CDS are not only useful, they're essentially necessary for the axel manufacturer.  <br>  <br>  The biggest existing problem with CDS is the counter party risk that comes from an OTC market.  By trading CDS on a central exchange with a single counter party you've opened the CDS market for those who need to use it.|`|iKxm8aL7aa	not necessarily

NrwJyffxaa	Unless somebody has a really good crystal ball they aren't going to be able to give you an accurate appraisal of your home.   The best way if your not willing to pay for an appraisal, to get a fair price value for you home is to to contact 3-4 Realtors in your area.  Tell them you are thinking about selling your home and you would like them to give you a price at which they think you should list your home at.  DO NOT sign any documents unless you really want to list your home.  Look at what the Realtors give you as suggested listing prices. Have them supply  at least 3 comparables  to support their number. Politely tell each after words that you are getting opinions from other Realtors and you will contact them if you need more info. They will be closer to your home value then any guess somebody not from your market will be able to give.    I build in many different markets and your home as described would be worth 50k more in one then another.

49d798aae69c40cbf0926ebc21291224aa	I'm wondering if you shouldn't ask any questions at all.  I was made redundant last year and attended four interviews before I found a job.  In the three where I didn't get the job, I asked prepared questions, but got the impression that the interviewer felt that I was wasting their time and didn't want to answer.  Then in the fourth, they said "do you have any questions?"  And I simply said "no, not at the moment thank you" and got the job.    Then yesterday, someone on here posted a question saying exactly this ... why are you told to ask questions to appear interested when actually, no-one wants to hear them?    I think it's because people are taught that as part of good interview preparation you should prepare questions that will make you seem really interested in the job.  But how are you seeming interested if you've simply memorised questions to ask?  Anyone who is interviewing for multiple positions probably just asks exactly the same questions each time.  So, I think interviewers are right to see it as a waste of their time.  I don't think you should prepare questions, and I think you should only ask anything that needs to be asked - e.g. if there is something in the job description, or mentioned in the interview, that you don't understand.    As a recruiter myself, I really do hate when candidates ask things that are completely irrelevant and unnecessary just so that they can ask a question.    If you wanted to ask that question then you could, but you would rephrase it as "how has the current macroeconomic situation affected the company?"  You obviously don't add in the part about redundancy.  No company would be hiring if they believed they'd be making people redundant shortly, so not only does it sound bad to ask, but their honest answer would be "no" anyway.|`|jI85GYGoaa	Tactfully / Diplomatically you could sound them out by asking them in which areas they see expansion taking place over the next year mentioning that you would be particularly keen to get involved at an early stage of the process....    Or -- You could stress that you realise how important on-going training and development is to enhance your role in any organisation during the current economic climate especially. What opportunities could the Co offer you?    They will probably lie through their teeth - Just be seen to be keen and give them the impression they are the best thing since sliced bread.     Best Wishes|`|811921e95b3795dad10075b3f9e12029aa	Keep the focus of the questions on the work that they want you to do - it will impress on them that you want the job because you like the work.  Have a short list of things (about the work) you want to be sure to find out, and when they ask if you have questions see if there is anything on your list that hasn't already been covered.  Does it look more professional to whip out a list and scan quickly down it ?  I don't know- but at least they know you came prepared and are not making it up as you go along.    The other thing is to stick to questions with concrete answers - especially if it is men.  Ask them questions to which the answer is going to be short and easy.   For example: in terms of a football match, you would ask them how many goals, but not whether it was a good game. Your question about how they are coping:  you should have found this out anyway by checking their share price, their website or looking for stories in the news about them.|`|XGaTLGxLaa	Here's a good list of what not to ask:    http://thecareernetwork.blogspot.com/200...    If that helps.|`|rTTwH9Unaa	Thats probably a good question, dont ask the last bit about the redundancy though, unless your applying for zavvi or the offices club.|`|5418463416e8caa309a081dd29995b76aa	Ask what element of the business they are particularly proud of and enquire about the achievements/successes they have made.|`|xskA3wwdaa	After you have asked 3 to 4 questions regarding job specifics, company culture, and so on pop this question to the interviewer..."Is there anything that I have said so far, that would have cast doubt in you hiring me?". That always is a pleasant shocker and would earn you points.    I dont think there's anything wrong asking about how the current economic situation is affecting the company...I believe all employers should be transparent to potential candidates. If they are honest & straight with their answer, you should not have the need to ask the other question on redundancy :-)     Hope this helps.    Regards,  J
snh9wzpnaa	Get out last year's return and lay them side to side and see the differences.  Nothing substantial changed in the tax tables that would explain it.  My guess is that you had less withheld in 2008, or (less likely) you had a credit in 2007 that you don't get in 2008.|`|AA11284831	Comparing tax refunds from one year to the next is an exercise in futility.  Each tax year is unique.<br>  <br>  I paid several hundred last year but am getting back nearly $2,000 this year.  I lost my job last year and my unemployment was only about 20% of my previous wages so I was grossly over-withheld even with the UI tacked on.  I also got only $15 from the stimulus rebate last year because of my income but am getting all of the remaining $585 since my income dropped substantially in 2008 from what it was in 2007.<br>  <br>  Don't compare refunds!  Compare tax liabilities.  That's a meaningful number; refunds are not.
3mAgM405aa	Here's a short list of jobs in the U.S., Canada and Europe which you can create to generate income:<br>  <br>  1. Learn calligraphy so that you can provide handwritten invitations and thank you notes to prospective wedding parties, birthday celebrations, etc. Seek out clients through wedding planners at nearby churches and temples. A starter calligraphy kit usually runs around $20 and anyone can easily pick up this skill. The going rate is usually $1 per hand addressed item.<br>  <br>  2. Seek from your neighbors a gardner position which involves planting, weed removal, plant/tree trimming, light brush clearance. You will be using the neighbor's equipment and tools. Again, do not represent yourself as a lawn mower since there are any number of safety issues involved. A door-to-door solicitation of surrounding neighbors is required and you can charge between $6 to $9 per hour.<br>  <br>  3. Offer policing/removal or clearance of trash services to surrounding neighbors which involve trash pickup within nearby residential area. Limit the extent of pickup to small areas and be aware that there are no hazardous terrain or elements involved in this process. Again, a door-to-door solicitation of neighbors is in order. You can charge between $6.75 to $7.50 per hour.<br>  <br>  4. Acquire a set of window cleaning tools [a bucket, liquid window cleaner, sponge, squeegee, handle with an extension and a small step ladder] and solicit local businesses for your window cleaning services. However, be careful to limit the height of the window cleaning to no higher than one story. Charge $1 per window panel.<br>  <br>  5. Visit your nearest beauty salon and ask to be trained as a shampoo person who is also willing to sweep up fallen hair on the ground and do set ups [arranging dye kits, curler holders, etc.] for a set hourly fee.<br>  <br>  6. Become a sign flipper by contacting your nearest realtor. A flipper is someone who stands at a major intersection and flips a "For Lease/Rental" sign in order to attract visitors to an open house or to a particular real estate listing. The hourly pay is at least the minimum wage.<br>  <br>  7. Why not become a paid feeder servicing the disabled at nearby nursing, convalescent, assisted living/care centers and hospitals. It involves feeding food to patients who are unable to feed themselves. The starting rate is $8.00 per hour. The only downside is that one has to take precautions to wash one's hands after each feeding. A posting of your services [by a business card or flyer] on a reviewable bulletin board would be enough to generate customers. The paid feeder position is one of the fastest growing occupation at this time.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|eth48m7Iaa	most places won't hire that young. why don't u put an ad for babysitting on craigs list or at the local supermarket. if u live in a nice neighborhood dog walking can make some money.|`|o2BcHlSHaa	you can't work a long you have 16 year and try to work on restorante

It really depends on your company and your short-term disability.  You should contact your human resources department for specific answers. <br>  I hope it works out for you.  This is a really rough time in the economy.  Although this might not be optimal, you could even consider cutting your maternity leave short if your partner is home and could take care of the baby.

5BTKscZraa	When a debt collector first contacts you, your first step should always be to request written validation of the debt per your rights under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. Even if the debt is valid, request validation anyway.    Send them a letter via Certified Mail + Return Receipt stating:    Per the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, I am requesting written validation of this alleged debt    When they call back, tell them: I have sent a certified letter to your office officially requesting written validation of this alleged debt per my rights under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.    Per this federal law they must provide written validation within 30 days and they must cease collection activity until they send you written validation. This is not optional. They have to provide written validation if you ask for it. Do not let them scare you with bogus threats during this period.  =====================  If this comes back validated as a legitimate debt, make a settlement offer of $100 (or so).     * Get all terms of any settlement deal you reach with debt collectors IN WRITING BEFORE you give them your money. Make multiple copies of your settlement letter and keep in a safe place. Never accept settlement deals over the phone without following up with a written agreement...The debt collectors will deny that any settlement was ever made once they get your settlement money and will come back demanding more money.   * NEVER, EVER give out your checking account numbers  to debt collectors for making electronic debit payments. Pay only via USPS money orders. Photocopy for your records.|`|meK0ziCJaa	First call the "creditor" to find out exactly what this is for. The collection agency will not have any further information, other than the amount is claimed to be owed. You will have a better understanding of what the "debt" is for, first of all.     Second, write a dispute letter, pursuant to the first post to this question. However, my advice is to write the letter on your own. State that you did not receive a first notice, if this is in fact true. Only state true facts as to the reasons you are disputing the debt. The shorter the letter the better. Try not to ramble b/c the collectors only care about the reason you are disputing. A lot of websites have consumers asking for everything and anything under the sun. The only thing a collector is mandated to send it validation. This could come in the form of an itemized statement.     I know you may not want to work with the collection agency, but you will most likely fair better being nice than getting angry. The creditor transferred your account to the agency. Most importantly, the person on the other end of the phone is only doing their job; they aren't trying to give you a hard time b/c it's you.     This is just my experience from collectors.|`|ad3ORARNaa	The collection company must send you an invoice within 30 days stating what you owe and why you owe it.

If the debt is beyond the SOL, you can send the collector a certified, return receipt letter telling them to cease and desist all contact as the debt is beyond the SOL.    If you do opt to settle, be sure to ask for a pay for delete -- you pay $x and they remove it from your credit report.  You can probably settle for $50.  Be sure to get any settlement agreement in writing and do not give the collector direct access to your bank account.|`|OacSIfSiaa	If they call again inform that that as per the FDCPA 15 USC 1692g;  809. Validation of debts, they (the collections agency) must within 5 days of the first communication send you in writing the following:    the amount of the debt;  name of the creditor to whom the debt is owed;  a statement that unless the consumer, within thirty days after receipt of the notice, disputes the validity of the debt, or any portion thereof, the debt will be assumed to be valid by the debt collector;    a statement that if the consumer notifies the debt collector in writing within the thirty-day period that the debt, or any portion thereof, is disputed, the debt collector will obtain verification of the debt or a copy of a judgment against the consumer and a copy of such verification or judgment will be mailed to the consumer by the debt collector; and    a statement that, upon the consumers written request within the thirty-day period, the debt collector will provide the consumer with the name and address of the original creditor, if different from the current creditor.    It also goes on to state (and I will condense it)  that if you dispute it and request validation, all legal proceedings must cease until such debt has been validated (notice validation concerns more then verification)  Validation requires the following:  Proof that they own the debt legally or have been legally authorized to collect it from you.   A complete payment history documented from your original creditor. This requirement was established by the case Fields v. Wilber Law Firm, Donald L. Wilber and Kenneth Wilber, USCA-02-C-0072, 7th Circuit Court, Sept 2004.   A copy of the original loan contract that you signed with your creditor.     No proof, no case.  Also as mentioned by bdancer, this debt is most likely time barred anyways.    Hope this helps answer your question.

aHN5fDwQaa	The realtor is the seller's agent unless you specifically contract with them to be an agent for you, the buyer. There's a simple test to determine whether or not the agent is working for you (the buyer) or working for the other guy (the seller): Who is paying the realtor? If you pay, then the realtor is working for you. If the seller pays, the realtor is working for the seller.<br>  <br>  In most transactions who the realtor works for usually doesn't make a lot of difference. What the realtor said is basically true - the whole transaction can be handled through them (and typically at no cost to you). But don't expect a realtor who is working for the seller to provide you with a house inspection from an independent appraiser. And don't expect a realtor who is working for the seller to point out _anything_ negative about a location. Some might, but don't count on it. The realtor's job is to get the house sold for the seller.

I don't believe that they are worth renting from or they would have already fixed everything before they even showed it to you.

I live in NY and it's taking upwards of 5 weeks. I did DD and E-file and needless to say I am a bit irritated. You should get yours soon.|`|MXw4v2sFaa	I am starting to see varying degrees of answers and am beginning to think it may have something to do with the company you chose to do your e-filing.  I hope others will post what company they chose and date their refund was received so that we can see if there is a pattern.  I used FreeTaxUSA and e-filed on 1/27.  On 1/28 I received an email stating that my NC state tax return had been accepted.  Shortly thereafter the NCDOR website, <a href="https://eservices.dor.nc.gov/wheresmyrefund/," rel="nofollow">https://eservices.dor.nc.gov/wheresmyref...</a> stated that my refund would be received within 20 days.  So with fingers crossed on both hands, I calculated 21 BUSINESS days (adding one more day for a government holiday in February) and came up with the magic date of 2/26.  Well, here we are on 2/26 and NO REFUND YET!  Beginning a couple of days ago the NCDOR website stated "Your tax return has been received and is in process".  And as of today it still states the same.  I will come back and post here once it has been received through direct deposit.<br>  <br>  FYI...my federal return which was e-filed with FreeTaxUSA on the same day (1/27) was accepted on that same date (with a statement that my refund would be deposited within 8 to 15 days) and my refund was received through direct deposit 8 days later on 2/6.<br>  <br>  ****************1/27 - STILL NO REFUND!<br>  **************** 1/28 - STILL NO REFUND AND NOW THE DOR WEBSITE READS "Thank you for filing electronically.

3a123fcd29814bec4e72629e7a4e11f4aa	It's pretty simple the way CDs work. You choose an amount (it seems the minimums above are $500, and that's what you seem to have), then choose a duration. It appears from your list that the best interest rate is for a 7 month CD (2.03)so go with that. These CDs pay simple interest, which means that they will pay you a straight 2.03 interest per year, pro-rated for the duration of your CD (7 months). That will come to about $7.17 at the end of the 7 months. I know that's not much, but that's about what you get in a CD these days. And yes, you can just let the money sit there for 7 months. No need to add any more. At the end of that time, you can get your money back with interest, or if you do nothing, the bank will probably put it in another 7 month CD at the whatever rate they are offering then.|`|uRqm4Bxcaa	Whoa, that's a lot of info. I skimmed it only because I am going to tell you this:  Gold is probably a better bet than a CD.  In fact, there are gold-backed Roth IRAs available.  I found out through recent investing and research that most investments you can make usually have counterparts that are backed by gold. Nowadays I recommend that to people, and I myself have precious metals assets.<br>  <br>  Think smarter, not harder.  As more governments and other entities move into gold, its value will rise more than it already has.|`|H2atnQuAaa	I would consider investing in Goats. Yes goats. Goats are the wave of the future. I mean think about it, goat meat, goats milk, goat yogurt and cheese are all the rage now. And with this economy more and more people are turning to goat commodities. I say again my friend, goats are the wave of the future.|`|STs2ouqRaa	With CDs you don't have to keep depositing money. You put in an initial deposit, and through the term of the CD keep earning interest on that money. Most banks you actually cannot make additional deposits unless the CD is in a "grace" period, which is usually a week or so depedning on your bank after the CD reaches the end of its term, or maturity. <br>  <br>  Compounding is referring to how often the interest is calculated and added to your original deposit. <br>  <br>  Looking at what your bank offers, I would go for the 7 month special. The interest rate is higher but you won't be locked in to that rate a year later if rates go up. With only a $500 opening deposit, the interest you earn won't be outstanding, but better than your typical checking or savings. Just know that once you put it in a CD, you won't be able to touch it again for the term of that CD unless you pay a penalty. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!
y7Mwptsraa	There used to be a RPP limit, and it was $3,500. This provision was eliminated from the income tax act in 1985.    When you belong to an RPP, it's not the amount of your contributions that comes off the RRSP limit. Your T4 slips will show an amount in box 52 for a Pension Adjustment. This is the amount that comes off your RRSP limit.     The pension adjustment is calculated by the pension administrator. The amount includes your contributions, any amount contributed by your employer on your behalf, and any credits that would have accrued during the year. As a result, the pension adjustment is usually at least double the amount of your own contributions, and sometimes more than that.|`|5dXsErAaaa	Your RPP contributions is used in calculating your pension adjustment which will lower your RRSP deduction limit the following year. there is a limit to your RRSP deduction limit calculated as your unused room carried forward + 18% of earned income for the year or 19,000 which ever is less.
dqzoEw67aa	You should go to their human relations dept or personnel dept, or if they don't have one, go to your boss and tell him/her you'd like to apply for the permanent position and ask how to go about it.  Full time jobs offer benefits and some more security than contract work, so if you like the place apply.  If you only want to work there for a little while as a contractor and then move to other companies, don't apply.
NrUzk1djaa	A) Small business is DEFINITELY not the backbone of America... that's just a trendy thing to say.    B) There's a term in economics called economies of scale. Larger companies can use their own knowledge and expertise to drive down business costs and therefore product costs. If the entire country was run by small business, everything would be slower and more expensive. Your argument only stands if you're willing to pay more for everything.    C) Big corporations do the big research. Small business with small revenue streams can't afford to take big gambles on R&D where they may see no returns. If they do this once and fail, they'd... UH OH... need a bailout. Again, your argument only stands if you want healthcare (including immunizations and drugs) and technology to stop right where it is.     D) American people do have a 'say so' in corporate business policy. It's called ownership rights when you purchase stock. No, the general public does not have a say so in corporate policy... but why should they? They aren't attached to any profit or loss for the company.    E) Companies don't purchase new jets every year... and they certainly aren't going to be doing it with bailout money. Large corporations typically span huge geographic areas that executives and other decision-makers need to travel to frequently. Truthfully, it's probably cheaper for most corporations to own jets rather than spend millions annually on commercial flights that are riddled with delays and cancellations. From a balance sheet perspective (and tax perspective, if you want to get into depreciation) owning and using an asset is much better than just seeing dollars go out the door as an expense.    F) You know how every once in ahwile, you get a craving for pizza from that place you ate at when you were growing up? You'd have to get used to that feeling, because there would be no standardization anywhere. There would be no grocery stores, no fast food, no clothing makers, no cars in essence, we would be back in colonial times. Sure, you could get a car made but think how much custom cars cost today and if that was the ONLY way to get a car supply and demand... owning a car would be like owning a jet. Speaking of that... no more flying!    G) People need to get it through their heads that these bailouts are LOANS... not just free money... and it's NOT coming out of your taxes.    I could go on and on, but it doesn't seem like you have much of a grasp on modern business, finance, economics, or global trade... so it will be tough to convey a lot of the ideas. It's easy for me to stand in the dairy aisle of the groery store and wonder how they can charge $4 for a gallon of milk... when I have no idea what goes into raising those dairy cows.|`|m5J36D28aa	This is America, companies can be any size they want to be or their sales will handle.  Actually, they can operate much more efficiently when they are large.    The American people have to pay for the failure because the cost of handling the impact of all of those people out on the curb would be much more expensive.

The way it works is you go to purchase online and select pay pal, it leads you to sign in at paypal and all the info is filled in about the purchase, it shows you where it will be mailed add other addresses if its a gift then it will say, use bank account or card, select which you wnat to use and it pulls funds from the bank into pay pal, then pay pal pays them to keep your info safe and secure.  Anytime you get a refund, the money sits in pay pal until you tell it to go to your bank, its safe and just stays there. You must follow all tlhe steps and the verifying step also before pay pal is active.|`|DR4LYQBtaa	yes, you can. on the internet, a debit card is treated exactly like a credit card although, with paypal, you shouldn't have a problem giving out your credit card number they are pretty damn secure!|`|drEfr9waaa	Yes, I only use my savings account with paypal  However you can always add a credit card to paypal if you want to.

What kind of cutbacks can you make? For example: I drink bottled water. Now at $1 a bottle on something that covers over 65% of our planet is not smart. So I bought one of those water filters that screw into your faucet. I have bottles that I refil over and over again. I take them to work. Do you have a lot of small appliances around that house that are always on? I cut my electronic bill almost in half by unplugging all the clock radios and night lights. I also bought some of those florescent bulbs that look a lot like a regular bulb. These things use 80% less electricity than regular bulbs. Ave 60Watt incalescent bulb runs you 2 cents per hour. Ave 60Watt energy bulb averages 0.5 cents per hour. You would be surprised, but these small things add up. I know I was spending money on the water filter and energy efficient bulbs but these things will pay for themselves in a month providing they pertain to you. If you really need the money right away start cutting back on your food costs. Romain noodles cost a dime and they taste just as good as campbells chicken noodle that costs $130 a can. Ok no chicken in romain noodles, but you are probably just missing about 4 tiny pieces of chicken. Adjust your toilet to use lesser water. If you don't know how to do this then put a brick inside your toilet 'chamber'. You will use a little lesser water each time you flush..Before you know it you will be ahead. Wanna be creative? Find yourself leaving lights on? Buy a motion sensor switch, the lights will turn on when you enter the room and will turn off (by a set amount of time) when you leave the room. I have one, they cost $15 at HomeDepot. Need new windshield wipers for your car? Who says you have to buy 2? You only need the new one on the drivers side, leave the old wiper on the passenger side.  So remember you have to start thinking S-M-A-R-T!

Ikd9cppcaa	No to passing out flyers to strangers. Make a list of the things you can do like walking a dog, painting, cleaning out a garage or basement, yard work, babysitting, dogsitting, etc. Put on the list that you are saving to go to summer camp (or whatever so they know you just aren't bored and are earning extra money). Then only take these to people you and your parents know in the neighborhood, friends, and relatives. No strangers because you could hand one to some guy that just got out of prison and is a pedophile.|`|ylg9ejceaa	I would ask your age. That can be dangerous. Maybe start out by asking only people you know. Maybe some of your parents friends, or memebers of your church. You could check local senior assistant living complexes. Check with the offices to see if any residents have pets. Older people like to see a kid trying to make an honest buck. Word of mouth is going to be your best tool. Once you get a few customers ask them if they have any one they can possibly refer you to? Also, during the summer time part of your marketing stradegoy could be to help get peoples pets outside while they are at work. Kind of like dog sitting for the day while you're off for summer break.<br>   Good Luck, I think its great to earn your own money, just remember one thing, you cant trust anyone!|`|7fBJydCtaa	sometimes
BoAEgaAGaa	If you are the person who has the higher right to claim the child then you have 2 options.  You can e-file your return without the child to receive any refund you have coming.  Then you would file an amended tax return adding the child on.  This will be mailed in.  The IRS will, in a few months, sent you and the other taxpayer who claimed the child each a letter for your chance to prove who had the right to claim the child.  If you prove you are the correct person you will receive the rest of your refund and the other will have to repay.    Another option is for you to mail in your return with the child being claimed.  Then in a few months the process with the IRS as I mentioned above will happen.    Be sure you understand all the rules for claiming a child on your tax return.    Your child lived with you over half the year.  They did not provide over 1/2 their own support.  They are under 19 or under 24 and a full time student or disabled.  If they are a qualifying child to more than one taxpayer their are tie breaker rules.

It will delay your refund because it will require investigation, but it will get it straightened out.|`|1H7aNVT3aa	File 1040 on paper by mail.

The IRS will Red Flag it then you can explain what happen and show proof that this child has lived with you for more than 6 months out of the year.  You can also file by paper and send it in along with your taxes. Either way it will be a long delay.|`|J5aw0ubpaa	File the IMMEDIATLEY on a paper return!  You would have still get every penny due to you for the EIC and yes they will have gotten the credit as well.......for now.All you need to do was call the IRS and explain to them that whomever filed them illegally and they resided with you.  Now with that paper return ,they will ask for some supporting documents to verify the kids do reside with you.Which can be something as little as a school registration form ,medical documents,etc.With the paper you can still do Direct Deposit and recieve you refund almost as quickly. you'll just have to drop your return at the Post Office.    Heres the fun.....Now when speaking to the IRS rep. let them know that the children NEVER resided with anyone else and that this is fraud, whoever the lucky person was who claimed them, will then be"Disqualified for Recieving EIC" for a period of 5 years because they wont able to to produce corresponding documents and you'll have already turned them in.    Generally, they dont take the money back the same filing year someone claims children fraudulently(unless it is reported promptly and the investigation is started) but if they are reported by the REAL guardian to the IRS you can rest assured the next filing period they will be barred from the EIC and have to pay the money back.....trust me its a big headache for them.      If nothing is never said to the IRS about this fradulent return then it will just get swept under the rug with all the other fraud.  P.S.....The HR BLOCK lady up there is right ...you both will get letters to prove residency however,except in the meantime BOTH will get paid.  When the investigation is complete someone will owe money to the IRS.....    IT WILL NOT BE THAT LONG OF A DELAY...you are just mailing a paper return,you can still get direct depsit.Just call them and they will start the investigation and tell you to mail your return and those documents.

9FxR4khCaa	I believe you mean that she was hired as temp with the promise of being made permanent. If she did not get that agreement in writing, she doesn't have a legal leg to stand on. If the company only offers insurance to all full-time permanent employees, they have not broken any laws, since she is still classified as a temporary employee. But she should check the employee handbook or info she was given at her hire.|`|2N6oTOLQaa	Does she have a written contract that promises her full time status with medical benefits by a certain date? If not, then no laws have been broken.|`|y2ZukikXaa	It doesn't matter what her 'status' is.  If she's working more than (usually) 30 hours a week then she IS full-time and would be entitled to everything that any full time employee would be entitiled to.  So, if they had a 90 day waiting period for coverage her clock would start after she started working full time.<br>  <br>  Again, it doesn't matter what they call it or what they promised her.  They can't treat her differently.|`|nx7QtF0paa	Typically your company with have a Summary Plan Description that will outline who is eligible for coverage.  This is required by law to be given to ALL employees who ask, not just those the plan covers.  In the SPD it stipulates what an employee is, usually by the number of hours they work, and what benefits they offer etc.  If your companies health carrier was made aware of what was going on, they could demand your coworker be put on the plan under the Uniform Coverage Rule. <br>  <br>  In short in most cases its the number of hours that dictate who is eligible for coverage unless you are under a collective bargaining agreement, like a union.  Ask for the SPD.|`|457db30f68586ffe5e0ebc94a4dba769aa	Did she receive a 1099 or a W-2 from your company for tax filing purposes?<br>  <br>  If they gave her a 1099, they're probably trying to insinuate that she's a "independent" employee, not a regular, full-time employee.  (She'd need to consult with a labor law expert to determine if they can rightfully do that in her situation or not.)<br>  <br>  If she got a W-2 and has full time employment status, then she should receive the same benefits as any other employee in her classification, after any necessary waiting periods are met.|`|U7nj9Kg4aa	An employ benefits package is 'owned' by the employer.  They can do whatever they want with it.  It depends what is on paper and what the company defines as fulltime to qualify for benefits...typically it involves working fulltime hours for a specified period of time (XX number of consecutive weeks/months of XX number of hours per week).  If she doesn't have a contract there's nothing she can do.  He said, she said cases never make it far in court.<br>  <br>  This is why I'm a big supporter of getting your own insurance and forget about the crap that employers and creditors offer.

AA11173563	in order to refi the home you would have to bring cash to close in excess of the $20,000 up side down as FHA is the best bet. Now if the note is FHA or VA you can streamline it with out an appraisal. If that is not the case offer it for sale and get the lender to approve the short sale and you will be taxed on the shortage. Seek out a loan modification with the current lender and the last 2 things is a deed in lieu of foreclosure and the last being a full blown foreclosure<br>  Good luck|`|MvC6n3DWaa	I would call the lender and see if they are willing to refinance. The rates are significantly lower. The problem is that you are upside down in the mortgage. If you cannot come up with the 20k, you probably will not get the loan. Sorry, I am thinking as I type.<br>  <br>  What if you ask the lender to redo the terms of the loan? It is worth a try. They may lower the rate to protect their investment. <br>  <br>  Why are you not charging more rent? $900/ month is a huge difference. Can they pay more? If you work it from both angles maybe you will get the relief you need.|`|eus7WqzUaa	You can't refi a house upside-down. Hold on to it and get in the hole. I am sorry but that's the bottom line. A lot of people are dealing with this. It is going to take along time for the market to go up-years-  I know I am not telling you what you want to hear.  Rates will stay high when the 10 years bond is what it is-its not really the stock market.  That's one big thing that predicts rates on mortgages.

f1lpdiNEaa	I think while other supermarkets raised their prices as their suppliers did, Tesco's rose the least, meaning shoppers feeling the pinch were more likely to find a bargain at Tesco, so they found new customers and profited.<br>  <br>  Their internet shopping site is the most successful as well as the addition of Tesco Direct homeware and electricals etc. Tesco also apparently has the best range of 'basics' out of the supermarkets meaning people can pay less and still get decent quality.<br>  <br>  It has also expanded overseas and has 50% of its profit coming from these stores.

AA11296044	You signed the lease, you are not getting your deposit back.<br>  <br>  THe lease also states that you agree to live there for a period of time and will probably offer a penalty for failing to fulfill your portion of the contract.<br>  <br>  You are in breach of contract, you forfeit the deposit.<br>  <br>  You are fortunate they are offering to give you a portion of the deposit back.<br>  <br>  There is no prior to - when you sign the lease you become the legal resident for that duration of time.|`|EXJfoGtAaa	"Prior to" doesn't mean anything.  You have breached the terms of the lease and the landlord can hold you liable for monthly rent until they are able to lease the unit.  Go back and research the law regarding "abandoning."  That's vacating before your lease term expires.<br>  <br>  realtor.sailor|`|AA10045620	Your legal right is to pay the monthly rent on a contract you signed.  Sounds like they are being very nice to you if all they are requiring is a clean up fee.  I would think they would require at least three months rent to let you out of your legal contract.<br>  <br>  It is not the landlord's fault that you simply changed your mind.|`|68MkdEgiaa	I would seem that you have breached the lease because you have turned over a deposit and signed it. You may have to take it to small claims court. I think you should consult with your local governments' landlord/tenant department. They are very familiar with the state laws and can inform you of your rights. They are an unbiased party so that will help a lot.|`|KN3I89Ycaa	You signed a lease, you are lucky they aren't demanding that you pay them at least one month's rent!  They will now have to find someone else to rent it, and realistically, it will probably be a month before someone can move in.  You can stand your ground, but they can take you to court and will win without a doubt.  I had one lease that couldn't be broken, only bought out, so if I walked away, I owed them the rent of the year's rent.  If they are charging you less than one month's rent, I would consider it a GIFT and end it.  If you pursue this, know you are in the wrong and they will win.

Vq8Szjs9aa	Essentially, you're talking about drop shipping.  The best way for an independent (lacking a brick n mortar location) is to set up an online storefront or website.  You can then contact individual manufacturers of the product(s) you are interested in marketing.  Based on your terms, you should expect a wholesale price that is slightly higher than a typical retailer, since the manufacturer will be doing more work on your behalf (shipping, billing, credit card processing, warranty, returns, etc).  A general rule of thumb for standard wholesaling is 50% of MSRP.  That is, if the MSRP of a given product is $100, you should be able to acquire it at $50 per unit.  Again, this is a general rule of thumb.  However, since (in your case) the manufacturers will retain more responsibility, you should expect that your take per unit will likely run closer to 15-25%.<br>  <br>  First, you must decide which products you are interested in marketing through your storefront.|`|sSzWHx0raa	In my business I am in partnership with a company that allows me to market their products and services, I actually don't have to sell anything.

ePkiOzPSaa	It's a mutually parasitic relationship.  They aren't necessarily "scammers", but close to it.  They buy the houses at steep discounts (which means the seller is getting a lot less than they should).  On the other hand, the seller has generally gotten him/herself into a sticky situation, and needs to get out quick, so they can only expect that they will have to take a loss in order to get rid of their house asap (in an economy where buyers can afford to be so selective).<br>  <br>  So yeah... they're not necessarily helpful people.  They ARE taking advantage of a situation, but if they weren't there to take advantage, the sellers would be even worse off.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, if a normal seller sells to one of these investors without knowing the true value of their house, they are probably being "scammed"|`|Pjm9pg7iaa	They will pay 60% of the value of the house. Not 60% of the asking price or 60% of what the owner wants. They have to have a cushion so they can sell it quickly for a profit. <br>  That does allow someone to sell their home in one day. The buyers pay cash. When they resell the house, they allow the subsequent buyer to take 30 days to get a loan.<br>  Buying the house does not usually save people from going bankrupt. It just gets them cash quickly..|`|KN3I89Ycaa	They are legitimate, but they don't work for everyone.  They buy at a heavy discount fo they can sell and make a profit.  Most are not flippers, though some are.  This only works if you have equity to walk away at a discount.  If you owe $200k on a home worth $210k, they won't talk to you bc they would only offer you about $150k.  But if you have equity, don't mind losing it all, and need to sell fast for whatever reason, they can do it.|`|3tuwWidiaa	In general, these are people (or companies) that buy properties at sub-market prices.  This can be a good thing for a seller because it can save commissions (although I'd still recommend having a lawyer or even an agent that will work for a fixed consultation fee), can get rid of a house that's not appealing in the market, or can avoid foreclosure.<br>  <br>  On this last point, which seems to be the subject of your question, the key lies in whether the seller can still make enough to pay off a mortgage.  In a market where home prices have dramatically fallen and where buyers are taking out 90, 95, 100, or even 100+ percentage mortgages, it's likely that what a "I Buy Houses" person is offering will not be enough to pay off a mortgage.<br>  <br>  But it could be.<br>  <br>  There are scammers out there, but most of these are legit businesses.  But businesses that want to have the upper hand by offering the lowest possible price.  As such, they don't have that same "ooooh, honey!  I love this house!" feeling that "real" home-buyers have.<br>  <br>  If you're desperate to sell your house, quickly, and are willing to take significantly less than what you COULD get if you let the house sit on the market for months, this could be an option to prevent foreclosure.<br>  <br>  Be aware that these buyers are not only looking for great prices, but they are looking for houses they can sell at a profit.  They may be more willing to wait a few months for a sale (or have capital to improve the property), but ultimately they won't buy something they fear they can't unload.  Therefore, if the housing market is really bad in your area and not expected to improve in the next few months, chances are that there will be few "I Buy Houses" people out there willing to buy.

He can't make you do something new in the middle of an existing lease, but he can require it on a new one, which he is doing.  Renter's insurance is not expensive and is required of most renters.

As hard as that is to hear.. a lot of folks that are postponing for a possible workout end up getting foreclosed on anyway, workout or no.

When two people try and claim the same dependent, then the IRS will often deny the second claim, until you appeal.  If your husband is not claiming the children, he doesn't need the ssn.  However, you can offer him a trade, if you want to.  The IRS has a tax form, 8332, that he can sign to give up all right for one year, or for as many years as you designate, to claim the children as dependents.  You can trade him a signed form for the number, and know that legally, the right to claim them will be exclusively yours.|`|tw44fqCpaa	He does not need their social security for 2 reasons.  1st, you are claiming them and 2nd child support is neither a write off for him or income to you and is not reportable.

meK0ziCJaa	I feel your pain. While the other posters have good suggestions, I would recommend to keep plugging away at it. I have had high credit card bills, and some times it does seem like the balance will never go down.     First, you should stop using the card. I only use mine for car repairs that I do not have enough cash on hand to pay for. I put all the cash I have down and put the rest on the card. Recently I had a repair bill for over $1k. I paid it off in less than a month. I've found the key to stick with it and you will see the results.     The problem with credit card hopping, for lower rates, is that it could mess up your credit rating. Msn.com has some great informative articles on this topic.

NsbGM74iaa	I think its not completely the Unions fault but I think that without the Unions in the way, cars would be priced a lot more competitively than their Japanese counterparts.    Also, I disagree with those who say that Unions have become weaker.  In my opinion, they become stronger every year and with every member they sign up, not to mention the 100's of political lobbyists they have on their payrolls.    Unions were initially created to serve the worker, with little to no benefit to the actual union administrators.  Now the tables have turned, and in order to keep their cozy administrative jobs, union heads figure out how to bilk companies for more benefits year after year until we reach the mess we have today (i.e. paying workers to not work)|`|XI2iylR4aa	I don't think the unions are totally at fault.

6iId5rPUaa	It's hard to predict what the economy will be like in a year.  However, accounting jobs are usually safe regardless of whether the economy is doing well or not.    I am a CPA and have been for several years.  I currently work in tax, and I think that the range of opportunities for careers in accounting is broader than with most other degrees.  No matter what, you can always get a job in accounting.  I was at a CPA society meeting this week, and they were saying that despite the current economy, most Big 4 accounting firms are still hiring in decent numbers.  In addition, many smaller firms continue to grow.    I would recommend that if you choose to get out of the military, accounting is one of the best fields you can go into.  It's not like the construction industry, which has had significant setbacks lately because of reduced spending by the government and commercial enterprises.  Construction is a field that is heavily tied to the economy.    Plus, with enough experience, you can open up your own CPA firm or become a partner in a firm where you would own part of the business.  But, know that an accounting job usually means a lot of work.  If you're looking for a book-keeping-type accounting job, it's probably not worth your time to get a CPA and masters in accounting.  If you want a job that gives you a lot of different opportunities--consulting, finance, tax, advisory services, auditing--then accounting is the way to go.

If you are in a state where the economic downfall is really terrible, and are moving to a financially better place, then it's not such a bad idea. Predictions say that this recession will recover quickly, so moving to an area where you have some family is good, as they might be able to support you a little bit. Hope this helps, and good luck finding jobs and getting a good new home! :)

If you are 16, even if you are working, it is   unlikely that one of your parents won't be claiming you as a  dependent (parents generally claim children at least until the  kids turn 18 or later if they go to college).

N6vLHO3kaa	I agree with physicist    Pay off Sears and Dell, pay the remaining $435.32 on Best Buy  then concentrate on paying off the $373.84 on the Best Buy  after that work on the Newegg    The difference in APR between the Best Buy and Newegg isn't significant for the time you would carry a balance on both.  It is better to have the 2 highest APR's totally paid and a 3rd card almost paid, especially from a psychological POV when trying to pay off debt.|`|AA11185479	If possible, transfer all the balances to the card with the lowest APR (the BB card).    Otherwise, do the math:    809.16 x .198 = $160 in interest  1,543.57 x .2849 = $439 in interest  1,021.11 x .2724 = $278 in interest  2,067.17 x .2199 = $454 in interest    So even though the Dell account has the highest interest, the Newegg account ends up costing you more because you have a higher balance.  I suggest focusing on the two highest account - Dell and Newegg.  They are costing you far more in interest, and that's just wasted money.  Pay those off immediately.|`|vHB9zUcCaa	what i do, is focus on the AMTS in the bill. i pay down the sm debts 1'st then work my way up2 the lg.    1. BB 809.16  2. sears 1,021.11  3. Dell 1,543.57  4. Newegg 2,067.17|`|AVzQs5Uhaa	I would pay off your highest interest rates so that they balances don't keep rising and then the highest balances. so dell,sears(they keep jacking up their apr's),then news egg and bb. Though I would not close the accounts as this doesnt reflect well on your credit believe it or not(most people think  its better but its actually not) Just make sure you dont use the cards or cut them up but still leave the accounts open.|`|PA7kYyAxaa	smallest balance to largest balance.|`|ad3ORARNaa	Look on the internet for low interest credit cards.  Only transfer the balance of the highest because they will pay the lowest interest rate first if you put more than one.  Also pay the highest  interest rate first yourself if you can't get another card.|`|AA10072911	If any of your accounts are past due you should get those accounts current before you do anything else.  Assuming all your accounts are current you should pay off the accounts with the highest interest rate first (Dell, then Sears, then Newegg)|`|CW7Sej2uaa	Pay off sears, dell, and most of best buy.  Then in the next couple of months put all the money that would have used on those payments toward the newegg and get it paid off in a couple of months.|`|zZgsaHLBaa	Hey.. payoff the Dell and Sears completly and close those out.  Make sure they are closed.  Then take the rest of the money and split it between the other two as an extra payment.  Wait about 5 weeks and your credit score will get a big boost.  Then you can apply for a 0% card to consolidate the rest of your debt.  The higher score will help a ton.  I did this recently at: http://instantcardapproval.com/    Still have 0% on all my debt.  Hope this helps out!
pPkFPP8Gaa	Call them and they will work out a payment plan.    next time, if you know you are going to owe, don't file until the last minute.  You can get an extention on filing.  that will give you the time to get the money together and not owe any penalities or fines.    bottom line, get a a professional to file your taxes.|`|d1ee48df00eb4b8567acf7a43aeb1c1aaa	Generally, I regard "owing money to the IRS" as foolish due to the strong power they have over your life... however, if you have thoroughly investigated the tax impacts, and you are paying a lower interest there then elsewhere, then OK.     Now, we need to talk about withholding.  If you're getting a $4700 refund, you may need to sharpen your W-4 skillz.  Ideally, you should work it out so you get refund of at most a few hundred dollars every year (or owe them just a few hundred dollars).  Otherwise, your money is working for them when it could be working for you. You could have gotten that $4700 throughout the year and used it to pay down credit card debt, etc.|`|de2a2663fe4b3d02deeeda407aee1db1aa	I owe them as well about the same amount for an under reporting issue I forgot about last year.

sI3krJULaa	When you get your 1098 that shows how much mortgage interest you paid, check to see who's social security number is on it.  That's the person who will have the least amount of trouble claiming the interest.  As for any property taxes, she's probably fine claiming those.    But here's the bottom line:  She'll be allowed to claim the property taxes no matter what, but if you purchased late in 2008, you probably haven't paid enough interest to be able to itemize, so it doesn't matter who claims the interest- it won't show up on the return in the end, so I wouldn't worry about it.  If you get your 1098 and you've paid more than $5,500, then you'll be able to get more with itemized deductions.    Hope that helps. :0)|`|x9TgRvkbaa	I would say she needs to claim head of household. If she's employed or was that year, make her do that and yes, she can claim the house, also make sure her name is on the deed. She is the owner, when you'll file taxes go together, and let them see that, that way they don't think both of you'll are trying to claim it. If you have a cool tax person, let them know what's up and trust me, they will understand.

x9TgRvkbaa	Well an appraisal is going to take EVERYTHING into consideration when considering the value of the home. it's not that it goes down bc it's vacant, the longer a home as well as a car sits, the more problems they have. It's not being taken care, small problems go unnoticed, and they get bigger. So, for her to still try and sell you something that appraised for half of what she wants is ridiculous and you should walk away, if she's not willing to negotiate.|`|RfbpvqSWaa	The seller is ignoring reality.  Offer what you think the property is worth and be willing to walk away.|`|1e276cf277894bd2387532152b4db7a6aa	Remember, this is a market.  Because, someone paid something for it, does not mean it is worth that today.  In a market, the value is dictated by what someone is willing to pay, and that usually correlates to past sales of similar properties.  You can always make an offer.  If they don't except, you don't have to buy it.
X5eH20qzaa	The basic TurboTax online service is free, but it has limitations.  Depending on your tax situation, they will attempt to sell you additional services.  It's still incredibly cheap and easy, provided you don't have a highly sophisticated return, in which case you probably need an accountant.  The e-file is also free.    Also, given that your return is prepared correctly, no one can get you any more of a refund than anyone else.  Your taxes are what they are.  .|`|7S5EgDFVaa	Nothing in life is free.

The date of declaration is different and is only the day the company announces that they will pay a dividend.|`|AA11639059	First, a company is usually not required to pay dividends (assuming we are talking about common stock, preferred, for instance, is different). When a company announces a dividend decision they also will announce a date. If you bought shares any time before that date, you will get the dividend.
TFSCAnq1aa	You will hear from them right away for you to do the drug test. You can't start without it.  You will NOT hear about the results of that test unless you did NOT pass it.  Some companies do take their time when it comes to the background check.  Normally you can expect the check to take 2-3 weeks. You didn't say when your start date is. If you do not hear anything from them the week before your start date, you can call to get the results.

I do feel for the unemployed and do hope they find work.|`|dC6A5R5Saa	For starters the UK central bank should further lower interest rates to:  - help stimulate the economy and prevent mortgage defaults by lower interest rate payments  - Stimulate the stock market.  The FTSE 100 responds favourably to interest rate cuts.    Given that the UK rate is 1.50 and, the US and Japanese rates are 0.25 and 0.10 respectively, I don't see why not.    Find high dividend paying stocks to promote the FTSE 100.  http://uk.finance.yahoo.com/q/cp?s=^FTSE    Traineeships   - Create a web site that helps unskilled workers get jobs and use a television campaign to promote it.  - Government incentives for businesses to take on trainees rather than skilled workers who can easily find word such as initially paying trainee workers less and tax effective incentives so they companies people rather than putting things like "MUST have EXPERIENCE" to degrade and discourage unskilled workers on their job ads to minimise the number of applicants.      Promote Voluntary work so people can still gain skills and references until they find paid work.    I don't agree that all 60 year olds retire.

I'd cancel the Olympic Stadium, get rid of the illegal immigrants and all benefit cheats. I'd make companies who produce junk mail pay huge distribution costs. Wouldn't have to be recycled then either. All staff in Hospitals which have a high death rate would be given rigorous medical tests to see if they're qualified. This would stop botched operations, etc. There would be strict hygiene rules in place to prevent patients catching the 'bugs' which keep them in hospital longer. I'd make car drivers who park on and block paths pay a 'path' tax. I'd cut the wages of the big bank bosses who have been greedy and sieze their goods. Police costs could be cut by making corporal punishment law.|`|28Pz8nt7aa	There is not much we can do individually. It always seems to be the plan to start at the top by throwing in a load of money and trsusting this will trickle down o the bottom. Before it gets anywhere near the bottom, someone has nicked it! Maybe we should start at the bottom, or near the bottom and start improving things, not by money but by hard work and attitude. Just start to improve and get right the small things that actually make a difference. Get people to love their environment. I know it sounds crazy but if local people started improving their own surroundings and make them better to live in it would gradually work upwards. For example if you lived in an area which was clean and safe and you could get to work comfortably you would be happier and thus more productive. I know it sounds crazy and maybe you think your area is already like this. In particular in the UK our Government has really done nothing, just papered over the cracks to fool us that they are doing something just so they can keep in power and line their own pockets.

Just take the damaged one to the customer service section of the store, explain what the problem is, and ask for either an exchange or a refund. They shouldn't ask too many weird questions, things like that happen all the time. It's their job to make sure you're getting what you paid for.|`|jH8hIB0kaa	If you have recently purchased the ps2 and have a receipt, they will refund the money. If it was charged on a credit card, you will need the card for them to put the refund back as a credit on the card.  They will check to make sure that the unit returned is the one that was purchased. This is because some people buy a unit and try to return a similar unit that is defective. I hope that this helps.

bankzwwYaa	The part you accumulate AFTER bankruptcy.. you pay...    Before... is debatable......|`|Bqi7jmsPaa	There are bankruptcy rules which decide which type of bankruptcy you are allowed to file; chapter 7 or chapter 13.    An attorney can look at your situation and advise which one you qualify for.  This can vary from locale to locale because the means test takes into consideration cost of living in different areas.    Chapter 7 means you give up any property in which a debtor has a secured interest unless you work out a financing agreement with the debtor (car, home, boat, etc.)    Chapter 13 means you have enough disposable income (per the means test) to repay some part of your debts.  In that case the credit card holders get a percent of what you owe them back.|`|a9ef65eaf779962d4dab5e79cff5e703aa	Talk to a lawer. Chapter 7 is different from Chap 11 or 13.      One is a restructure where you pay back some of your debt, the others are a complete wash of debt, but with penalties like no credit for 7-10 years, and you will always have to say "yes" to the question "have you ever filled bankruptcy?"|`|rOj4B5QNaa	If you file a 13 then yes, you will pay it back, but with less penalties and interest.  If you are able to file a 7 then no.  If you only have credit card debt though I would look at Consumer Credit Counseling first (unless it's an outrageous amount).  Usually it's not as long of a process and it can help you maintain a good credit standing.  Most people file BK over stupid things.  I'm about to file because my income went to about 1/3 of what it once was, so I cannot afford my home, car, utilities and everything else right now.  Yes your credit is negatively affected, but not nearly as bad as if you just stop paying everything all together typically.  I'm filing having close to a quarter million dollars in bureau debt alone.  If you have further questions contact a bankruptcy attorney and they will usually do a free consult as I just found out.  Then see if it makes sense to go forward with it.  Good luck, most of us have fallen on hard times!

That said, there might be a bank on a particular ATM network.. but that isnt your question, is it??|`|0yqQg9CXaa	There are online banks that will refund your ATM fees.  With my online bank you can make 4 free ATM withdrawls / month - no matter where you go.    Online banks HAVE to offer this free service or else no one would ever be able to take money out of their checking account.    Seriously consider Bank of America.  They really seem to be everywhere.  /|`|a9ef65eaf779962d4dab5e79cff5e703aa	As much as I detest BOA.. Bank of America or Citibank have the largest population of branches in the US.  Being large, BOA sees you as banking fodder, ...       For a small fee you can do your banking through "foreign" banks anywhere.  A foreign bank is any bank other than where your accounts   are domiciled.|`|rOj4B5QNaa	Well now that Wachovia and Wells Fargo have merged they are in every state.  Also look into Chase.  They have nationwide branches.  A lot of the banks are merging right now due to the lovely economy, so as the large ones are getting larger you shouldn't have any issues finding locations for any of them state to state.

JR3UxWYEaa	Because a downturn in two consecutive quarters of the year equal a recession. This is a downturn in the entire year ie MAJOR recession!|`|ToztjpAsaa	I'm glad I'm not the only one who thinks this.  I don't believe that the world economies can continue growing indefinitely - after all, eventually non-renewable resources must disappear.  But then I never really understood economics (I'm not sure economists do, either).|`|RxkGpV7xaa	I'm not really good at Maths, but here's how my logic would pay out:    Year 1 is at 100, and 2% increase = 102 (2.00 increase)  Year 2 is at 102, and 2% increase = 104.04 (2.04 increase)  Year 3 is at 104.04 and 2% increase = 106.12 (2.08 increase)  Year 4 is at 106.12 and 2% increase = 108.24 (2.12 increase)    Recession hits, and we lose 2.9%.  Year 5 is at 108.24 and 2.9% decrease = 105.10 (3.14 decrease).      The decrease would set you back to the third year. The point I'm trying to make is that you don't degrade percentages, as you do with normal take away sums. You've basically lost more amount, than you gained in a year. Hope this helps!

sv7tUUTbaa	You can work at Publix.  Honkey's are always trying to put us down.|`|Ftq92s10aa	Legally, you can work anywhere except in mining, manufacturing, or hazardous jobs.  The problem is finding someone who will actually give you a job.  The most common discrimination in age against young people.  As to the asian part, I'm not sure.  It's possible I guess.  Good luck.  I finally found one at a small family owned restaurant.  I'm 17 now and about to be a manager at pizza hut.  By the way, don't try any of those internet things.  They are all scams

AA10072911	Yes, you can use an American Express gift card to make a purchase on walmart.com  You would just select American Express credit card as your payment method when you go to checkout and it will take it just like a normal credit card.
0yqQg9CXaa	Places in my state that closed down because of a new state law banning interest rates over 430%.  /|`|uFXR9TsLaa	They lend you money until your next payday, but they charge such high fees you end up usually oweing them more than your paycheck is for.  I know of 7 states that have banned these business because they are charging such high fees.
Pjm9pg7iaa	Get a work permit and work at a golf course. Boring work but you will get paid..|`|9qiLZp50aa	Work at your public park district. You could be around children, work at a swimming pool, and a lot of other fun things like that.
moqrM9IRaa	The most obvious answer is to put what you expect to earn.  If you expect to earn minimum wage, put down minimum wage (which is $8.00 per hour in California as of January 1st, 2008).  More than likely, if you put down a reasonable answer it won't hinder your ability to get an interview.  If you shoot too high they'll probably just ask you during an interview if you're going to require that amount or if it was just an estimate.
