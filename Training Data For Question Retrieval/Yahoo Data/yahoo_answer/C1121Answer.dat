H6rPxpHWaa	1.Stay out of the sun. Skin pales in the dark and tans in the sun. Stay out of the sun or wear the highest SPF you can find. Always head for the shade. <br>  2.Wear more clothes. The less skin exposed to the light, the less chance you will have to tan. <br>  3.Alter your appearance. Dark clothing and hair will contrast with your skin and make you seem paler. This is entirely optional. <br>  4.Take Care of Your Skin. Wash, moisturize, exfoliate and ensure your skin is healthy. Healthy skin will help. <br>  5.Use a whitening cream. Whitening creams are amazing, and can really lighten skin. Choose a safe product and read all warnings! Alternatively, you can look up natural methods for whitening. Milk, for example, is a natural skin whitener. <br>  6.Apply lemon and amounts of water to even out with the lemon on the parts of the body that you want the pale complexion to be. It will only take a few days for your skin to be pale be sure to do it about 3 times a day. <br>  7.Sprinkle an ounce of baking soda in your bathtub so you can soak for 10 minutes ONCE a week. <br>  8.Nail polish for girls is a great way to make your hands and feet look a little paler.

2H55Z0TQaa	The easiest way for me is to prep hair with a volumizing mouse or heat protector. Separate your hair into sections (I usually have 4 sections) so you don't miss any parts, and start curling the bottom sections first. Take small pieces from each section if you want really defined curls, but if you want them looser, take larger pieces. When you put the hair in the iron, start by putting it closer to the roots, and pull the iron out until there is only a little tuft of hair sticking out. Hold the iron straight up and start twirling it until you get close to your skin. Hold for a few seconds. You can tell it's done when you pat the hair and it's hot. Once you finish all the sections, spray a light mist of hairspray to keep the style in place.<br>  <br>  It is true that the curls/waves hold best when your hair hasn't been washed for about a day, but if you use hairspray, you will be fine!<br>  <br>  Goodluck, hope it looks awesome when you're done!!!|`|xbISxnmfaa	With a CERAMIC curling iron, with some HEAT PROTECTANT spray, and your hair wont be really dirty, but if you wash your hair every day or other day you should be fine.|`|NuvKPl3naa	you can have clean hair. wash and dry hair. use some gel before you dry your hair. then spray some hairspray in your dry hair. and curl with a curling iron. or skip the hairspray and use hot rollers.|`|ssrLnvvWaa	well if you want curls a curling iron or curlers will do. What i do for wavyish/curly hair is after a shower put my hair in a messy bun and let it dry i then get a curl.  i don't know if it should be really dirty but if its too smooth and shiny the curls might not hold so well|`|ejelObdJaa	curly iron...<br>  or maybe if u wanna leave it wet then use gel & try to make ur hair curly with ur hands lol...<br>  <br>  <br>  & no its not true that ur hair needs to be dirtyy..|`|9OqSl1Jlaa	Heated curling iron and hair spray.|`|BDtTWVIUaa	I'm too lazy to curl my hair so I'm getting a perm on tuesday. :) perms are nice..|`|tqmXnkvnaa	I use a straightener. I don't curl it all the way to my roots, but my ends. I start from mid point and just spiral it as I am moving it down to my tips. I wonder if this makes sense? you can probably youtube all of this.<br>  <br>  it's a little harder to handle it after you get out of the shower, dry it, and everything. it doesn't have to be really dirty, but it's easier to curl it if you go a day without washing your hair.|`|3Fma3URSaa	Use a heated curling iron.<br>  <br>  Always use something to protect your hair from the heat of the curling iron.<br>  Your hair shouldn't be very dirty. Just don't wash your hair for one day and that should be good enough.|`|bf3ikOv8aa	curl with curlers or a curling iron<br>  best way is hot curlers and lots of hairspray<br>  and its false, to keep curls the longest your hair should be right after wash.<br>  your hair should only be dirty if you're going to dye it|`|hep8pA7Gaa	1) get a curling iron, or use a straightener to curl it (watch youtube videos)<br>  2) using a curling iron<br>  3) NO! that's not true. your hair should be clean & dry (:|`|XU3rWffUaa	go on youtube and watch some of the flat iron curling tutorials.<br>  <br>  i had been using a curling iron, but using my straightener is more simple, and the curls last longer.|`|pjrPYAasaa	1) get a curling Iron...<br>  2) outwards<br>  3) NO! it should be very clean !!!!!|`|O5HDwfbaaa	a curling ironlike most peole|`|DXotNZ9eaa	What Stephen said, But make sure ur hair was wet then heated|`|ymSq5sTNaa	i use a flat iron (straightner) its a 1" <br>  and its best to put the hairspray in first to keep your curl and run the flat iron through your hair first <br>  it will probably actually explain it better if you go to <br>  www.youtube.com<br>  and type it into a search it'll show all different ways and different lenghts in video explanations<br>  hope that helped|`|KvpNij1raa	1) wash your hair <br>  2) while its wet put some hair mousse into it, but not to much.<br>  3) dry it (personally i think blow drying is bad for your hair so i never do it)<br>  4) use any kind of curler you are comfortable with (this is the one i use <a href="http://img.alibaba.com/photo/11577591/Enzo_Milano_13mm_Curling_Iron.jpg)" rel="nofollow">http://img.alibaba.com/photo/11577591/En...</a> <br>  5) finally, after you are done curling all of your hair use hair spray and spray it all over your hair for all day strong hold.|`|WQa07CZPaa	1.) Use a curling iron. My favorite curling iron is the pink bedhead one.<br>  2.) The best way is to leave the hair in the curling iron for...5 seconds if you have thin hair, 10-15 if you have thick hair. Also, use hairspray so the curls will hold.<br>  3.) I've heard that. Your hair is hard to deal with (ie, the curls staying) when it is really clean. So, I would wait until it is a little less clean, yes. :)|`|KN5imtScaa	my hair is very thin and i curl my hair with rollers and sleep over night with them on and in the morning i take them out and my hair is very curly<br>  i usually take a shower then blow dry my hair before i roll it|`|6eJm757Laa	When I cur my hair, I usually sleep in soft hair curlers. Or, if you are in a hurry, use a curling iron. But make sure that they are good and actually make your hair curly. It's very simple!|`|jZb5zMCvaa	i think that curling your hair with a thin straight iron looks really cute and it stays much longer than with a curling iron. you can look up how to do it on youtube.|`|HwDcy063aa	no not dirty wash ur hair and the blow dry completly and use a flat iron geton youtube for the tutorials on how to curl ur hair with a flat iron if u dont already know how :)|`|qAGeCYVlaa	If you're looking for something simple just get it wet and scrunch it with hair spray. A quick alternative to curls!|`|gtKkCAAkaa	with a curling iron
ZGcNgRX0aa	i dont know what year you are in but you could have fun with it.<br>  start off with something like <br>  "as soon as i saw him accross the room i knew it was fate. we had to be together" (you see shoes in the shop)<br>  "i slipped into something nice to compliment him" (can be taken two ways, you dressed nice to get a guys attention, or you dressed in a way that the shoe would match your outfit.<br>  "we could not resist the perfect match between us"<br>  <br>  then you can go on about him being the perfect size and an great fit. trust me you will get a hell of a lot of laughs and at the end you can accuse everyone of having a dirty mind after you reveal its a shoe lol.<br>  <br>  email me if you want ideas lol|`|TX5uV9bIaa	Yeah.  Be the shoe that was thrown at President Bush.  You can talk about all of the emotion of the guy that threw it...and how you feel about the big bronze bust of the shoe erected in Iraq.<br>  <br>  Personally, I'd be embarrassed, but since its' fiction you can take it any way you want.
HqumTrsraa	Well depends what the dress is for the first one for a fun and semi-formal event like a dance or just a night with some friends. The second dress for a more formal event, like an interview, church or an adult party. <br>  <br>  Accessories (jewelry and hair)<br>  1st Dress- I agree on the bright colors. But if you not into a bunch of colors just pick one, maybe red or black. A flat shoe or a boot would look good with this dress. <br>  2nd Dress- You could either wear silver or black. Even red would work. A heel or boot would look good with this one. <br>  <br>  It all depends on what the dress is for. Personally, I would pick the first dress with red or black accessories. <br>  <br>  Hope you have fun with whatever you are doing.|`|MhnwosUvaa	im sorry, but neither of them the dresses are my taste there are better resses for the same price range at kohls.com and accessories there as well. id just put a white chunk necklace with weither dress and some nice black or white heels, sinple earings and nail polish. good luck|`|coo2x3kXaa	Fist one definetly the second one looks like a maids dress<br>  the first dress is pretty bland so i would spice it up with red pumps and chunky braclets or a chunky necklace and big sparkly silver earings<br>  you will look so great<br>  hope that helped|`|GQjIkO3iaa	bright jewelry would look good,<br>  esp. with the first dress|`|5j1Uhg2Gaa	I would buy the second one and do black or white or a mix or both plastic jewelry <a href="http://lovelasmuertas.com/images/big_mod_circle_blk_wht.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://lovelasmuertas.com/images/big_mod...</a> or the black one here <a href="http://www.plasticfantastic.com/photos/opb273.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.plasticfantastic.com/photos/o...</a>|`|qzkWahFeaa	Pick the first one, and wear bright shoes, a couple of pieces of bright jewelry, and either dramatic eyes or dramatic lipis.|`|2vidb5ZAaa	the first one is cute<br>  and def. need to accessorize it with some hot braclets<br>  and rings<br>  <br>  maybe a shiny silver or pearly bracelet<br>  <br>  well basically a bunch of bracelets<br>  <br>  necklace??? it may be too much of a high neckline to look good with a necklace<br>  <br>  <br>  <3<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.forever21.com/product.asp?catalog%5Fname=FOREVER21&category%5Fname=acc%5Fjewelry&product%5Fid=1059501905&Page=1#" rel="nofollow">http://www.forever21.com/product.asp?cat...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.forever21.com/product.asp?catalog%5Fname=FOREVER21&category%5Fname=acc%5Fjewelry&product%5Fid=1059900515&Page=1#" rel="nofollow">http://www.forever21.com/product.asp?cat...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.forever21.com/product.asp?catalog%5Fname=FOREVER21&category%5Fname=acc%5Fjewelry&product%5Fid=1059904385&Page=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.forever21.com/product.asp?cat...</a>|`|MOMme2k6aa	okay well i dont like the 1st one thats all white idk just seems a bit frumpy..the other one tho is realllly nice i have a similar one...<br>  <br>  pair it off with black close toed high heels<br>  no necklace because it has enough goin on with the front of the dress<br>  accesorize with a chunky black bracelet and black stud earrings|`|stSyB4Mjaa	The first one<br>  Black or bright fun colored shoes or Accessories<br>  maybe try stockings...those are cool! =]|`|ZrJX66jEaa	first dress;but jewlery depends on your shoes.<br>  what shoes are you going to wear?

I just stick with face wash. They last longer.|`|XmXY1IrCaa	it works wonders :)|`|WHx3YDfTaa	of course
IinHx47Iaa	One reason is that the dollar was worth a lot more back then.<br>  <br>  Another is that in 2004, Converse went Bankrupt and Nike bought them, effectively raising the prices and mass-producing them in sweatshops.|`|4QfyirQjaa	Well ya they r more pricy now but to compare it to other shoes its not that expensive!|`|xUndUb95aa	Converse are getting very expensicve because they are highg in demand.

73ee354f7bf2027a3e2d3c971ceb8834aa	A diffuser is this thing you put on the end of a blowdrier so you get the heat put not all the blowing. It makes your hair less frizzy when you blowdry. Most diffusers are these weird little plastic things that would come with the blowdrier, but there are also cloth ones that just slip on the end of any blowdrier. Those are the kind I use- they're better than the plastic ones if you ask me.|`|j6PrOaZgaa	something that curls your hair its an attachment on your hair dryer it has little spikes on it and when you use mouse and a diffuser  ur hair will get wavy/curly <br>  <br>  girls use it to "scrunch" their hair.

8929fa2803b58abe640d9bd8cb8c209eaa	Try buying shampoo and conditioner that is volumizing. Tresseme just  came out with their 24 hour body line and it works well for my hair.<br>  <br>  Also, continue to blow dry your hair. Try flipping your head upside down when blow drying it and even through out the day.<br>  <br>  Rather than hair spray or gel use volumizing mousse. This doesn't make your hair all piecey and stiff, but it helps to add volume.|`|oEU9mCe1aa	flip it upside down, and use BIG SEXY HAIR brand's volumizing spray. it really does work wonders. i use it, thanks to my aunt letting me try hers. its lovely, really.|`|cuwHI29waa	i used to have long straight boring hair but i got it cut shorter and with lots of layers and it has TONS of volume

I could take him out to pee by a bush.<br>  I would buy him Bratbarbie hot boy clothes.<br>  He could sit on my shoulder while I wash the dishes and do my stuff and whisper to me like that angel / devil thing you see in cartons. He could use my necklace to secure him to my shoulder. He could perch on my flower broach.<br>  I could even call him Angel.<br>  He was Damian with that cruel girl that enslaved him, but I have been wrung out emotionally, my very bones are dry from astringent men, so when I found Angel, he was salve to my soul.<br>  He s a straight man with the taste and style of a gay man.<br>  He gives me little tidbits of wonderfulness when we shop together, "that color is wonderful on you my lovely, it warms up your face so; your warm soul shows through in that yellow love"...<br>  He says things to me that warm my cheeks and put color back into my face.<br>  I put him in a box of Chhez Its and let him have the whole box.<br>  I never tell him " get your own box" <br>  I give one to him.<br>  He likes Cheddar Jack.<br>  He told me where to get a voice command activation system for the computer, so now he can do his work and we live quite well in the country very quietly.<br>  Don t try to find us.<br>  After he hid behind the donut box at Merryl Lynch we had quite the information to aquir a sufficient bankroll fron the info he collected and we have ourselves tucked away very tidily.|`|q7ZMQeCMaa	EVERYTHING!!

6ddbc258bcea66dd0bcbcd47cecf412daa	The bristles could be because your cleaning isn't thorough enough. You should clean it after a couple of uses, sometimes even a week or two wouldn't harm the brush.<br>  The cleansers wouldn't do anything different; most people prefer baby shampoo like Johnson's and it works completely fine. <br>  The sources below are just a few ways to clean brushes and dry them.<br>  Good luck!|`|zhzJoZ26aa	Face brushes should be washed EVERYDAY. It will carry bacteria that will be transmitted to your face. So you'll be more at a chance of getting acne, and all those things we hate. <br>  <br>  <br>  To wash you will need<br>  a silk with running luke warm water<br>  and Baby shampoo<br>  <br>  Wash the brush like you'd wash your hair. :D Wet it a bit, add shampoo, rub it in wash it out.<br>  Repeat if needed.<br>  <br>  The cleanser from MAC will just clean it quickly, but not remove all it's bacteria. I use this cleanser just, not for my face brushes.|`|Yue2YKTnaa	MAC has a brush cleanser <br>  its a pink bottle|`|1Hx7MFUvaa	I recommend cleaning it once a week depending if you use it everyday. What I find works best to clean it with is a foaming facial cleanser, baby wash OR hair shampoo. To clean:<br>  Moisten bristles of brush with warm water<br>  Squeeze quarter size amount of whatever product of the three I mentioned before into the palm of your hand<br>  Swish the brush around in it and lather it up well<br>  Then rinse it out till the water runs clear from it and leave it flat to dry overnight!<br>  This method will work on all brushes, synthetic or natural

The glasses would be good for studying or hanging out at starbucks during the day. At night however I wouldn't wear them as you have a great eye shape. If you made me choose I would say without. Now as for your makeup, again do you want to look "cute" or sassy is all you should be concerned with. Rotate the two looks but your "with makeup" look is simply more glamorous. Lastly I own a salon so if I were advising on makeup I would say making your liner thinner would be more age appropriate and a good balance between the natural and made up look. gloss is a must for either look. and no you don't look mexican but rather persian i would say or maybe a little native american like myself.|`|uYJdvnqxaa	You look cute with or withou glassest.<br>  <br>  You look nice either way with makeup,just when you wear makeup wear less eyeliner.Just curl your lashes,use covergirl eyelites mascara,then curl them a again and seperate your lashes with a fingernail some if you need to.It always makes my eyes big and pop!<br>  <br>  And you don't necessarily look Mexican,but you look like you have some kind of hispanic/latin in you.|`|g6lvm8eUaa	if you need our glasses to see, wear them. If not, don't wear them for fashion, show off your eyes. Next, definitely like you better with out all the makeup.

AA10261985	Of course its okay to wear jeans with a tank top and flip flops in the summer :] I'm all about getting my money's worth, especially with the horrible economy these days. <br>  <br>  I would suggest that you buy (at either store):<br>  <br>  1. 1 white and 2 bright colored fitted tees <br>  2. 2 polos<br>  3. A pair of skinny jeans (they always look great)<br>  4. A pair of comfy flip flops<br>  5. 1 solid colored bikini<br>  6. 1 pair shorts<br>  <br>  <br>  Tips: <br>  <br>  1.You only need 1 - 3 of each of those items! <br>  <br>  2. Solid clothing with no designs are more versitle, which means you can wear them over and over and dress them up and down.<br>  <br>  3. Invest in accesories that'll really play up an outfit like sunglasses or cute summer scarf.<br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|k5wqvI42aa	well thats all very relative...how much u can afford etc.<br>  also its totally fine to wear jeans in the summer.<br>  ok i would by some leather abercrombie flip flops, they are 50 dollars but they will last you all summer long.<br>  2 bikinis are usually enough...or 3 :)<br>  you should probably get quite a few ts, polos, and tanks, cause those are a staple. <br>  couple jeans.<br>  and then if you find some shorts like the "favorite short" ones or whatever at american eagle, you could get a few of those in different colors because they have a million.<br>  just remember that summer is about relaxing and not worrying too much about how you look, school work, or anything like that. just remember to take good care of your skin so you can pull off that fresh faced summer look. and i also reccomend letting your hair grow out and wearing it naturally because that looks awesome and laid back with a hollister t, shorts, flip flops, and some giant sunglasses :) one more thing, i would pick up a couple classic, simple summer dresses that you can wear to various soirees. and look for a cardigan on sale now that you can throw over those dresses.

But how it is that boys can look at our boobs and know our cup size LOL.<br>  <br>  Well personally if a guy ever did guess my cup size and got it right I'd asume he's a player. Cause if he knows that then he must be pretty experienced in that area if you know what I mean.<br>  <br>  So yeah I'd be pretty freaked out lol|`|N2akaPXlaa	You will need a tape measure for this!<br>  1. Measure all the way around your breasts, including the back, this is your band size.<br>  2. Using the same method, measure around above your breasts (armpits)<br>  <br>  Subtract your first measurement from the second, the difference in inches decides your bra size!<br>  <br>  Difference in inches:<br>  0 - AA<br>  1 - A<br>  2 - B<br>  3 - C<br>  4 - D<br>  5 - DD<br>  <br>  Good luck and God bless=) hope this helped you|`|2b6e38008a5ce6be1cb862d0466e9028aa	Bra sizing is standard - it has to do with how many more inches you measure around the fullest point than you do around the rib cage. Say you measure 32 around the rib cage. If they stick out 2 inches it's a b cup, 3 inches it's a c cup, 4 inches it's a d cup.|`|oEU9mCe1aa	theyre nasty little pervs that enjoy victorias secret.com and such.<br>  they know their bras!|`|hcQFbxIYaa	ha! i've been wondering the same thing..well they either just know about the different sizes or are perverts...still its weird|`|Dg0D8SCZaa	they guessed lucky then.<br>  <br>  the only way they'd know for sure is if you told them.|`|f9No4eRBaa	We're just born with that natural talent<br>  Just like a true guy, can reach behind your back and with a nanosecond one handed snap, have your bra unhooked ! . . lol !! it's true!

VWXXmL74aa	EAT. 1,000 calories is disgusting|`|7add460ae24c9452ae87b5a99c5aa756aa	Dude, you sound like you do need help.  1000 calories is not enough to keep you going.  I would seek out help now before it gets worse.|`|zvuDmY6Zaa	well anorexic people dont really think they are anorexic so i dont think you are. but keep eating please!<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AotchRFu9VbJTEpwJmWXgrHsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090222193816AAJAd4k">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|mPqgfEhNaa	well that's pretty skinny. <br>  <br>  my friend wouldn't eat anything through out the week but on sunday she would stuff herself then make herself throw up. <br>  she almost died and they had to but her on a feeding tube. she is recovering slowly. that's basically all there is to it. but you cannot become anorexic! Anorexia is a mental condition, it is a disease. You cannot make yourself be anorexic.  It takes over your mind, destroys your body, and ruins your life. If you want to lose weight, do it the right way by eating right and exercising. but i say you should just love your body the way it is lol trust me i had to learn this the hard way.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  well best of luck to you<br>  ?, lily|`|874e9ed8d38f4753f6cca93e708cd95baa	1000 calories is not enough calories.  However, my feeling is this, if you feel that your friends are bigger than you are, then chances are you're not anorexic, since if you were, in your mind you'd magnify how big your stomach is, and feel that it was at least the same size as theirs.|`|5XfwXFbjaa	Whether or not you have diagnosable anorexia, if you are able to see a problem with your lifestyle and eating than you can fix it. Eat healthy and exercise, don't count calories. Everyone's body has a natural healthy weight, don't fight it.|`|9LMckHolaa	Okay, there's a fine line between obsessive dieting and an eating disorder. If you're that small and only eating 1000 calories a day then I'd say you're on the road to becoming anorexic. Eat, please, and don't beat yourself up. We all feel the same way after being bombarded by the media with all the pictures of skinny people. The way you're going, you could get progressively worse if you don't snap out of it. One of my relatives actually died from anorexia. It's not something to be taken lightly. Anorexia or not, you're unhealthy.

qqUvoC5uaa	Try Secret Clinical Strength or Degree Clinical Proof I think it's called. <br>  They aren't 100% effective, but they help a lot.|`|Dg0D8SCZaa	try secret. dove didn't work for me either.|`|idhcqr5Daa	Bathe regularly : <br>  Step out of the shower, gently dry your body and your hair. <br>  Use a soft towel to pat-dry your armpits and other problem areas. Make sure not to vigorously scrub with the towel. This leads to sweating due to the fact that scrubbing stresses the skin. <br>  Spread a towel out on your bed and cool off by laying down with your legs and arms spread. This will allow cool air to slowly dry the armpits and other areas that normally experience perspiration Once you are dry, use antiperspirant deodorant. <br>  Dress as you normally would and you should be sweat stain free. <br>  Wear an antiperspirant (prevents perspiring or sweating) deodorant (prevents body odor). If typical drug store products do not help decrease sweating there are over-the-counter products such as Certain Dri or you can have an antiperspirant prescribed by your doctor. <br>  Wear a T-shirt or some other garment of a light weight material under your shirt to avoid sweating through clothes. <br>  When cooling off, it really helps if you lay near a fan as this will help evaporate the water off of your skin, thus cooling you off. <br>  Try ending your shower with a minute or two of cool-to-cold water. This will lower your surface temperature, making you less likely to sweat right away. As an added bonus, it will also close your pores and seal your hair shafts, leading to smooth skin and shiny hair! <br>  The type of antiperspirant deodorant matters the most. Choose a deodorant that is appropriate for your skin. You can try deodorants for either gender--if it works, who cares? <br>  Try not to wear tight-fitting clothing as this will cause more friction and the result will be more sweating! Make sure you have enough time to cool off properly, rushing will only increase stress and stress equals sweating. <br>  If you shave/wax or have sensitive armpits then use a deodorant that is soft on sensitive skin. The last thing you want to be doing is scratching your armpits because friction causes skin stress. <br>  Do not spray perfume while your underarms smell. The smell mixes and makes a terrible smell, worse than before! <br>  <br>  x0x0_LEi|`|bNlL6PrZaa	try certaindri ..you can get it at target, meijer or whatever. it's amazing! it works like the prescription medications do.|`|awUVtrljaa	axe makes u smell lika man <br>  get some

They have cute graphic tees like you see at Wet Seal and Forever 21, gorgeous sun dresses and springy bermuda shorts! Its all really inexpensive which I love. Another good place is Tjmaxx, I swear by it. I bought two pairs of American Eagle shorts there the other day for 9.99 a piece!<br>  <br>  Good Luck and congratulations on getting your braces off!

Any gradual tanning products are great! Make sure you wash your hands and wrist really well after you use it, or apply it with a rubber glove. <br>  <br>  I don't know if you have this store where you live, but Forever 21 has cute affordable clothes for the most part. And I love Target! They have so many cute clothes, for way less than most stores. The quality isn't too terrible either! <br>  <br>  Also, a great hair cut can make or break your look! So its worth investing in to one good hair cut and color, and then you can go to cheaper hair salons to maintain and trim up your look as needed.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!

You're also going to want to apply a good base coat before the actual eyeshadows, when I want a more dramatic look, I cover my lids in a cream eyeshadow first, Wet N Wild actually has some good, cheap ones for this. Then use use an eyeshadow brush, putting the darkest shade on your crease only, the put the lighter, "highlighting" shade on the higher, brow part of your eye, applying the liner last. Make sure to blend lightly using your finger. Hope that helps!

jr5Z03qaaa	the worst that can happen is that you can break out.  all that make-up sitting on your face will be absorbed by your pores.  i mean, i'm sure we've all fell asleep with make-up on our face and haven't had a break out the next morning.  but if you keep doing it on a daily basis, you'll eventually break out.<br>  <br>  as long as you wash your face with a make-up remover and a facial cleanser, you'll be fine.<br>  <br>  if you don't have a make-up remover, wash your face twice.  that way, your first wash will remove your make-up and the second wash will actually wash your face.|`|i7xEbqEfaa	One dermatologist said that for every night you sleep with your makeup on you age 7 days!! Since hearing that I have been religious in washing my makeup off every night, no matter how tired I am.<br>  <br>  At night your skin needs to breathe and flush out toxins which is difficult to do with a layer of makeup on your face. In addition, the makeup will clog your pores and lead to breakouts.<br>  <br>  To make the task easier, buy those pre-moistened makeup towlettes and start wiping your makeup off when you are watching tv or something.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps!  : )|`|GLeZdgcLaa	the oils in the make up can rub off onto your skin and create these little bumps around your eye area that are very hard to pop and may hurt because your eye area is very sensitve. it can also clog your pores. i've slept with make up before and the bumps are very hard to get rid of.|`|YAvlrd9Paa	You'll break out, at worst.

Look up a picture of Christine Comaford-Lynch.  She decided she would think of herself as a goddess, and voila, she's beautiful.  (Doesn't hurt that she's a self-made multi-millionaire, either.)<br>  <br>  After that, a good haircut, clear skin, a sense of style in her clothing (not expensive, but well tailored), not too much makeup, keep fit with exercise.  Also, frankly, have something to say -- read the newspapers, keep up with news, not just what celebrities are doing.  And be a good listener.<br>  <br>  Look at pictures of Kate Hepburn.

Try this, go to ur local mall or beauty counters and ask for samples of their moisturizers. These are normally a little pricey but the quality is worth it (for some). Some suggestions: Benefit You Rebel moisturizer (also comes in a tinted shade for subtle  glow), Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturizer, and Arbonne Intelligence Night & Day Moisturizer (this one could only be found on ebay but it's totally worth the $ i use it everyday) <br>  <br>  Hope this helps :) <br>  <br>  Oh and for ur lips u could always just use Carmex ($1) from drugstores and even liquor stores.

As long as you have a great eyeshadow primer, your eyeshadow will last long, look great, and will look like you bought expensive eyeshadow when you actually spent $5 on it. =]|`|XYT7jvBdaa	I love the following brands for my eyeshadow (in order of most favorite to least):<br>  1. MAC<br>  2. Milani<br>  3. NYX<br>  4. Coastal Scents<br>  5. Loreal HiP<br>  <br>  Coastal Scents is amazingly priced and produce the infamous 88 shimmer and matte palettes. They each contain 88 colors and run about $25 each, so less than $1 an eyeshadow! They're very pigmented as well, so you really get a lot more than what you pay for. You can go to coastalscents.com to check out their stuff!<br>  <br>  MAC is obviously a good pick if you can afford the $14 per eyeshadow and $20 per pigment. I have a few eyeshadows by them (Carbon, Expensive Pink, Newly Minted, Chrome Yellow, Sketch, Clarity, Post Haste, Satin Taupe) and two of their pigments (Pinked Mauve and Golden Olive). The pigments are very versatile-I've even added them into some clear lipglosses! "Carbon" is the best matte black I have ever used, so I highly recommend it.|`|6jN3g0x8aa	In my opinion, MAC is the best because their highly pigmented and long-lasting.<br>  <br>  Second is Urban Decay.|`|QlUNyK4Paa	covergirl? in my opion.<br>  <br>  answer mine P&TY.(:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ao3YArdSURQFS3G_iBr3R68Oxgt.;_ylv=3?qid=20090222222828AAahqOT">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|fqIE566Caa	Barry M do nice colours which are shimmery (UK only I think?)<br>  I recommend Urban Decay as well.

itiJVgRsaa	well you can try this stuff called Bio-Oil. that's what i always used on my stretch marks and c-section scar. they are really quite faded to where you can't even see them anymore. it worked for me. get it at a Walgreens near you. It comes from the UK.|`|uYJdvnqxaa	There are lotions that help fade them.Like coco butter has a lotion for it,I think.And also time.<br>  <br>  Just wear board shorts from like Pac Sun over your bikini to cover your hips.<br>  <br>  And you could possibly see a dermatologist?<br>  I don't know if you can see them about stretch marks or not though..|`|XD8r5KPRaa	I'm not sure that their is a way to get rid of them.

Just more critical. The media and everyone else put a heavy concentration when a celebrity [who's ALREADY in the spotlight] gains weight/makes some type of mistake/does anything that may be considered negative. It's a given that it'll happen, when a celebrity does anything different from what they're expected to do, it's gonna get a lot of attention.|`|V8fLpQpQaa	No I don't. When you see overweight people on the street, people have the same thoughts and overweight people get treated differently. The only reason it seems more harsh when it's a celeb is because people talk about it openly.|`|0qcwz5jDaa	yes|`|ilxnhfQ3aa	Yes, celebrities are role models for the masses, thus they have this responsibility on them. Whatever they do, gets wide publicity, so they have to be careful in their behaviour.

First go to the beach then use spf 10-15 tanning oil at least for 30 minutes then use 30 spf while your in the water or in the shade to cool your skin down. If you sunburn easily, use a moisturizing sunscreen lotion then wait 15 minutes, and apply a no sunscreen oil or lotion.

tsn34pS4aa	no, you should not, because if the access pressure the dangle will put on the piercing, and the more it dangles, the more it moves, the more it moves the more irritation and so on and so on.<br>  <br>  i am assuming from your words that you are going to do this yourself, shame shame, but if you do, and even if you dont, you should not be pierced with "a boring ball and hoop" because there are not many reputable professional piercers out there that would pierce with a CBR because of the unnecessary pressure it puts on the piercing.<br>  <br>  at most places, you will be pierced with a curved barbell, which CAN be boring, but you should have a choice of style, like one with gems on the balls, colored titanium and such as well. these are not boring at all and because they are so subtle is what makes them add just the little touch of glam to your belly.<br>  <br>  what is sad in this age is that navel piercings are becoming more and more popular but they are actually one of the hardest piercings to heal and the people who are getting them are not taking this into account and they think that they can just get it done and treat it like the ear piercings they got as kids.<br>  <br>  it takes a lot of time to heal this piercing well, you have to take care of it with the instructions and products that your piercer gives you, and if not you will be sorry.<br>  <br>  go to a professional, get a cute barbell, keep it in and take care of it. you will be much happier with the results.|`|c5anDswjaa	Its definitely not good to change it before its healed up.. And its not good to start off with a dangly one either, it can get caught on things and pull, and when it does it will cause you to wait even longer for it to heal.. Plus it will hurt like a mofo lol.. <br>  <br>  See if you can start off with a regular jeweled barbell, what you see in most navels..When I got mine pierced, I got a black barbell with pink gems..  It wont be as pretty as one with danglies, but it would be a lot better looking than a CBR!|`|eN5xA6RKaa	no. you can get it pierced with one with a jewel in it, but not dangle. because the dangle can get caught on things and its not good for a new piercing. wait 3 months then you can get a dangle put in|`|9xpFsVJSaa	No lol.<br>  I feel the same.<br>  I pierced my belly button 2 weeks ago and wanna change this ****, but it needs to almost fully heal to be able to take it out & be able to put something back in.|`|4P0Gmsa8aa	no. dont. i had to get mine repierced cuz i tried to change it. the hole will close right back up. dude, ive had mine pierced for 2 years, and sometimes its still hard to change|`|NPnCuwhFaa	you have to wait 6 weeks after changing it, thats what ive been told by the man.
RzJBlBjWaa	If you use some sort of exfoliater on your skin before you shave, then you shouldn't get any ingrown hairs. Also I suggest changing your blade often. Don't shave with a dull blade because that will increase the chances of ingrown hair.<br>  <br>  I suggest getting St. Ives Apricot Scrub. It's best to shave in the shower when you're under warm-hot water. The heat will soften the hairs as well as your skin. Also make sure to moisturize after you shave.<br>  <br>  I suggest buying an epilator. It's painful at first (kinda like waxing) but after a while you get used it. It pulls the hair from the root, but it doesn't damage your skin like waxing does.|`|iXPx5xJXaa	<a href="http://inthis.oyuncumekani" rel="nofollow">http://inthis.oyuncumekani</a><br>  A very informative website you can also get much information in website|`|EoAoMlXhaa	idk but go shave u hairy monkey|`|Dfx7S0tmaa	Use an electric buzzer - they are cheap to buy and work great!

Do some research before just jumping into it, you don't sound like you know a whole lot about it, and if you damage your earlobes, there's a chance they won't heal back.|`|2inq4zHZaa	As one of the other people said, everyone is different.  Most people consider 2g the point of no return, while others consider 0g or 00g to be the mark.  I also recommend staying at a 2g or smaller.  Just to be on the safe side.  If you stretch to that size, and do it properly, then they will shrink at least small enough to look like a 12g.  That is not drastic.  Definitely do your research on stretching.  Don't just dive in!  It is very important to know what you are doing in order to avoid damaging your ears for life.  Good luck :)<br>  <br>  Read this: <a href="http://forums.bodyartforms.com/forums/t/5641.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://forums.bodyartforms.com/forums/t/...</a>|`|CIlwfiU3aa	I think up to a certain size this is true..and even than I don't think it will ever look normal..<br>  <br>  I have had my ears at 1/2 inch for 7 yrs now which is about what you have.

They see a very pasty pale person when they stare into the mirror. A person who has an obsession with tanning. Not limited to any sex or race, they are predominantly white females. Tanorexics missed the memo that said that too much sunlight, specifically UV rays, is a leading cause of skin cancer, almost as bad as smoking cigarettes like a chimney which many tanorexics indulge in also. Tanorexics can easily be identified as having skin a sickly brown color, taking on a certain shade of poop the darker they get. This skin is many times darker than their sun bleached hair. A tanorexic thinks that dark skin makes them desirable and sexy. If a tanorexic tans many years, their skin takes on a leathery appearance and will form creases and folds, especially on the face, making one look older than their actual age, and possibly uglier than they would have been otherwise. They also keep the cost of insurance rising due to their frequency of skin cancer breakout. The common personality traits of a tanorexic are: sel-absorbtion, dimb-wittedness, and in defiance of common logic about the harmful affects of radiation. They tend to have a large majority of population incidence of skin cancer. The common types of tanorexics include: vain teenage girls, the party girls, the trophy wives (otherwise known as the rich bitches who don't have to work because their husband is a doctor/lawyer/corporate executive), the wrinkled old dark bitches who still think they look good (they fit in the previous category as well). <br>  <br>  <br>  Haha. :o)|`|vkPgHVLdaa	Its just disgustingly tanned.

HE1cJJQYaa	you can create a make shift earring from a regular 18 ga wrapped in electrical tape. Just wrap it around the stud until it's as thick as a 14 ga and this should hold you for a day or two. Make sure to oil it up before you put it in your ear for the least resistance. But while you are doing this order another set of any type of jewelry in 14 ga.

It's healthier if you actually go out into the sun, but some people may have differing excuses, like where they live they can't get much of a tan, or they are too busy or whatever. For the amount of girls that I have seen that have a fake tan, it must be popular, but you really don't need to go out and buy fake tanning products... that's a little too much in my opinion.|`|VOxZ2dt2aa	gawd fake tannign is such a turn off imo

Always. Always always always. The black shirt with tuxedo ensemble is what well-dressed gents call the "gothic" or "fascist" look.<br>  <br>  Accessories should be black. Five or six-button vests are no good. The black cummerbund and self-tied bow tie is still the most practical option for the well-dressed man.
7Wb0bazTaa	As a piercer trainy,i know alot of people ask this question, however its hard to know until you see it pierced, some pepole have a chubby tummy and think they willlook horrible but it ends up look great.However if you have alot of weight (not like you) it would not be a good idea since it tends to draw attention to your tummy, but alot of people do not see your belly ring anyways so its not that bigger deal.<br>  <br>  I think you would look fine.

kCdISEGqaa	Whatever you do stay away from Vaseline on your new tattoo.  It's been four days, go ahead and switch over to lotion.  I recommend Aveeno Baby to my clients.  It's very mild and keeps the tattoo moist, not wet.  Vaseline keeps it wet and doesn't allow it to breathe, lotion, anything without dyes, aloe-vera, and fragrances would be fine.|`|UYnZtJ2daa	Don't use Vaseline...ever. The tattoo really needs to breathe and vaseline is going to prevent that. I've never used aquaphor and just washed my tattoo with mild antibacterial soap (Provon) for the first three days and then used Lubriderm Unscented after the first three days. All of my tattoos turned out fine, yours should too...as long as you don't use Vaseline.|`|FJlCys0Gaa	I used a balm that i got from the tattoo shop.<br>  I think it's called TATTOO GU or something like that.<br>  I used it on all exept 1 the first one.<br>  It's great it stops a big scabb forming if you use it twice a day.<br>  It's like vasaline but with some essential oils.<br>  <br>  If you can't get hold of this I'd recomend vasaline.  lots of it <br>  Vasaline doen't dry into the skin the same as lotion and leaves a protective layer on the skin.<br>  <br>  I don't know where your tat is but it can also help to cover it with clingfilm why you are in work this stops the vasaline from rubbing off on yous clothes.<br>  I did this with the one on my foot because I founf my sock was sticking to it.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps<br>  <br>  xx|`|DEQHgdVqaa	with all my tattoos i usually recieved a "special" healing ointment from the shop i get my work done at, but usually they tell you any fragrance free lotion works, but basically YEAH you can start puttin some lotion on it especially if its starting to feel dry and itch.

bx0ZZEyeaa	My husband, and both of my brothers, 23, 27, 28, respectively still can't really grow  facial hair evenly. Most men (not all) do not grow a full beard, well, until they're at least 30. It's just the way it is. It's okay, though. It's not the end of the world. Think, most women, hate that extra gruffyness you've got when you haven't shaved for awhile, anyway. So, it's not that big a deal. Be happy you can grow the side burns.

I can use bare minerals, though, if I use foundation primer (e.g. Smashbox Photofinish) and concealer underneath (the only concealers I've liked have been Makeup Forever and Lancome Photogenic). If you don't want to use bare minerals, try a good concealer underneath a Laura Mercier or Lancome foundation. When looking for new products, finding those labeled "non-comedogenic" is much more important than finding those labeled "oil free"...some oil free products contain other things that can make you break out.<br>  <br>  Note that different things are irritating for different people though...you may have no trouble with a brand that makes others break out, and you may have trouble with something that works for others. Unfortunately, you might have to try a few brands before finding what's best for your skin. Just remember to save your receipts. Reputable places like the Lancome counter or Sephora stores *will* accept returns on opened products; just explain that the product irritated your skin. When trying something new, I introduce it for 2 weeks or so, making sure not to change anything else in my skincare regimen, and watch my skin carefully. If I start to have a reaction, I return the product right away.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|uYJdvnqxaa	Wash your face with clean and clear purifying face scrub,and then use the day and night face lotion that goes with it.And also buy the steam in shower facial scrub that also goes with it,and use it 2-3 times a week.<br>  <br>  Use the Covergirl aquasmooth.It is really light,and covers very well and looks natural.It doesn't feel heavy.But once when mine was almost gone and getting old it starting going on weird and unsmooth..<br>  But it looks airbrushed,and doesn't clog my pores or make my face oily... :]|`|s1ncvVLDaa	You can watch commercials and save money to buy amazing  foundations like Olay.|`|GIctGNtJaa	use paint shop pro!<br>  <br>  mine plz<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Agx7xghbFavZMObs82tAu_Psy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090222231011AA0A6Wu">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|UichaGBCaa	Revlon Colourstay does wonders!|`|xVEcaOveaa	clinique

qQqC2cHIaa	I see you are from India.  There seems to be many indian women asking about "fairness" and becoming "fair" at least ten to twenty questions a week in YA english.<br>  <br>  A little research shows me that there aggressive advertising campaigns selling some cremes and cosmetics that show a girl using a creme and then getting a man, a good job, happiness self confidence, etc because she is now "fair" The message is that dark skin is bad.  According to what I've read, these ads are airbrushed, they models use reflective powders,  and use strong lighting and over-exposure of the film to make everyone's skin look lighter. <br>  <br>  They are selling a dream and they lie, the cremes don't work. The few that do have caustic chemicals that literally burn the skin, you don't become "fair" you become burned. Most of these creames are not available in Amerca because they are deemed health hazards and too dangerous by the Health and drug regulators.  You are born with the skin you have, there's little you can do other than using a lighter coloured make-up that your natural skin and using shiny powder to reflect light.  Happiness comes from within, not from bleaching the skin.  <br>  <br>  I bet you didn't know that here in North America we are shown the same type of commercials and ads, only we are told we  are far too light and pale and we need to be darker and "tanned"  We are told that no man likes pale white skin. Only when we are tanned then we will get the man, the job and happiness.  We are told that fair skin is a sign of poor health and that no-one should be cursed with fair pale skin. Americans spend millions on tanning cremes, tanning salons, and make-ups that make them look dark skinned. <br>  <br>  I think we all need to stop worrying about things, stop falling for silly ads, and accept that there are some things we can't change and be happier as we are.|`|EsVjwKPAaa	use glutathione soap or kojic soap. rub your skin w/ lemon juice w/ milk.<br>  <br>  apply sunblock & foundation when you go out.<br>  <br>  you can also take glutathione capsules or you can have an injectables.|`|VB382Fkraa	always wear sunblock. you could try a glutathione soap. it didnt work very well on me when i tried it but they dont work for 5% of the people and have to be used for at least 2 months so yeah. lemon juice almond oil and milk are all good skin lighteners too, try using these on your skin twice a day but beware, the lemon can make u burn instead of lighten uir skin. there are also alot of  skin lightening products out there. id reccomend glutathione or licorice, but stay away from hydroquinone its bad for your skin and carconegenic. im trying these things too at the moment im on a real rampage to get lighter lol. as someone else said baby powder is also good but dont use too much or itl look like youv fallen over into flour haha. keep at it and be persistent. happy lightening :)<br>  <br>  P.S. ignore the crap you will get from the tanning freaks out there. in asian culture and british culture the paler you were used to mean the more beautiful u are|`|Bt1D1wWuaa	Whatever you decide, do NOT use baby powder as first suggested!

2Dy6jZBtaa	i think that u hit the bulls eye...i notice a lot of women don't see that a man has a very different view of what sexual advancements are and what is concidered romance and sexual behavior...and the amount of skin showing is one of em sorry to say for a great many a guys...even though a girl may have her own clothing style that she wants to express and its for her and not for the man...that may be true but in a lot of girls minds (that its their choice and their clothing and not for a man's satisfaction), but that same clothing expression of very sexy and showy has a very different signal being presented to a lot of guys...i think a lot of men and women forget that there are still huge differences in how each sex tends to perceive things and that even though you don't approve of their idea on what ur doing, that ur still in a world that has both men and women and u just cant change that fact with out some really extreme measures. so u have to accept how each gender thinks in general in the area u choose to live in. <br>  I dress sexy and even seductive sometimes when going out, i know what they are thinking, i dont care if they make rude comments. its for me and my own style and expression. i accept that a lot of guys will make those hoots and hollars and i accept that a guy will violate my personal space and possibly body because of my dress choice at some point in time...i mean they can hoot and grab all they want they aren't getting sold the cow if i can help it...just like if a random woman patted ur bum if u had a speedo on or u were shirtless a a guy...ud understand why and u accept why possibly, but u at some point draw the line on how much they can do till u get ticked off...

You can fade them in color,but you will not be able to rid of them with out laser surgery. I too have some stretch marks from having twins and i will tell you a great mixture that helps your skin to firm up a bit and will fade the them. half cup olive oil,half cup aloe vera gel,6vit.a caps., 6 vit.e caps.

78a143bb30610658d51f4382ac2cfe90aa	1.  The "C" pattern will be off - except for some patterns, like the "optic" or  "scarf print," the tip of the "C" facing the other "C" should touch.  For example, the notch at the top of the capital letter "C" should touch the notch of the backwards-facing "C".  Also, the C pattern should start in the center and go out.  The seams should go straight through the middle of the C, and the pattern should be aligned horizontally and vertically.<br>  <br>  <br>  2. The stitching is sloppy or the pattern is crooked - this is a sure sign because COACH does not make sloppy products!<br>  <br>  3. Most COACH purses have a serial number stamped on the inside, on a square patch of leather sewn into the lining, usually on the front of an inside pocket.  Some of the smaller purses (the "clutch" or the "mini") do not have this serial number.  However, handbags and totes should all have the serial number patch.  The serial number typically consists of a series of numbers or a number-and-letter combination.  Beware, some fake COACH bags also have a serial number - so you'll have to look at other aspects of the bag and the seller to determine if it's fake.<br>  <br>  4. Real COACH purses have the "COACH" logo stamped on most of the metal fixtures - some of the older "classic" styles do not have the stamp, but most of the newer styles do.  Just something to watch for... again, compare the one you see at a department store or on the COACH website.<br>  <br>  5. Look for the YKK stamp on the zipper. YKK is the highest quality zipper and if it doesn't have that, it is most likely a fake. <br>  <br>  6. Look at the lining - if the bag has a satin lining then it should have COACH or CC in the pattern of the fabric of that lining.  I do own some bags with no lining at all (the old-style bags) and I also own bags with a canvas lining that does not have any pattern on it.<br>  <br>  I got this information off an article on Ebay.|`|b1ac04bc86b240a0aa729c6edd30c1ecaa	I think there should be a certificate.

As for the few who wear them, more than likely, they are athletes (body-builders, swimmers, divers), immigrants, or tourists, any of which might be gay.|`|1edb4188f0da76484cde5458437d1cd5aa	Melanie, where are you from? my dad wears speedos|`|b2d339cc3a96ffbfc8831662ad71b243aa	It's not gay guys it really confident guys who where Speedos.|`|c178981b5b65aa5c946dfca53b95a9b7aa	suree is.|`|12afd8a5e2a219a6fa513e054aae6e0aaa	NOT only gay guys wearing speedos...I've seen some straight guys wearing them too...I guess wearing speedos makes them look gay and makes you think they are gay, but the real person inside of them they're not (well..some of them)...it just how you think of them...And I think some people more comfortable in speedos...

Besides that the ones that do wear them are all old farts and guys that think they are God's gift to women. Meanwhile they do not realize they are being looked at from all on the beach as a perv or a dweeb rather than a sexy guy. Grow up guys and wear something a bit more manly and not like a fa* at the parade. By the way are Joo tinking we are looking at Joo because we tink joo are cool..wrong ting man joo is lookin so stoopid man wit yo as* and yo pecker danglin der like a noodle. PS: yo bro wants his socks back after yo parade along de beach wit dem stuck in yo speedos.
b9e2bb5a25c57cc333a03588822952e8aa	There are HUGE differences between cheap and expensive shampoos:<br>  <br>  1.  cheap shampoos are mostly water, so you need to use more, which makes you run out faster.  expensive shampoo is comprised of more ingredients and is more concentrated, so it actually lasts longer.  you end up paying about the same money on expensive and cheap shampoo over a three month period!<br>  <br>  2.  cheap shampoos SEEM to do a good job because they make your hair "silky" and "shiny".  the ingredient in cheap shampoos that does this is silicone.  it coats the hair follicle to make it shiny and silky at first, but in the longrun, silicone is actually quite damaging to your hair.  expensive shampoos give your hair shine without using such chemically damaging ingredients!<br>  <br>  I have tried many expensive and cheap shampoos.  The WORST of the cheap shampoos is Pantene.  It strips your hair of color and uses more silicone than any other cheap shampoo.  The BEST cheap shampoo is Dove, as it uses less silicone (but still a damaging amount).<br>  <br>  The BEST shampoos are going to be more expensive, naturally.  I highly suggest Redken All Soft Heavy Cream as a repairing conditioner.  My ALL TIME FAVE, however, is Frederick Fekkai.  I've been using his shampoos and conditioners for a long time now and absolutely NOTHING compares.  You can buy them at Sephora and Target!<br>  <br>  For some good reviews, check out makeupalley.com.  It's a place for real people to rate products and write reviews, and there's also a section where you can swap your products for someone else's to try out a new brand.  Very worth it!|`|9dc43d915293456d0cd21384b8cde6f0aa	I've tried expensive shampoo and conditioner... I think its a waste of money. You just need to try different cheap ones till you find the one that is right for you. I use Garnier it works great with my hair. And i get a lot of complements on how smooth my hair is.|`|c98178d9efa19f35dc0877676eee4639aa	My sister is a hairstylist and since she opened her salon I have bought professional hair products.

Salon products are generally more concentrated and have less water added to them. Take a look at a bottle the next time you buy one, and see if one of the main ingredient's is water. If so, chances are it won't be as good or last as long. You should only need a quarter sized amount for medium length hair.|`|17dcc775ff4d0d3b1c739c04ecad1d20aa	I use Big Sexy Hair products (shampoo, conditoner and styling spray) and I love it! It is expensive but I have thicker wavy hair and if I use cheap my hair gets all fuzzy. Of the cheaper ones I don't mind Loreal though..|`|AA10314304	I like Redken... is that how you spell it? idk. It was like $20 for the shampoo and conditioner. I can't really afford anything more expensive. but it works for me. You can tell a difference like the first time i've used it. now it's just normal i guess.
AA12319961	The first poster is partly right. But not. If you know how to sew and know how to trace patterns from existing clothing, you need to take seam for seam. You can't just lay something flat and expect to get a correct pattern from it. Flip a pair of pants inside out and trace around the seams, with the paper underneath the pants, making sure you include the seam allowance already on the pants themselves...or you can draw it in later, it's usually about 1/4"-3/8" wide.<br>  <br>  Once you've done this and if you already have a picture sketched out of how you want them to look, make any markings, seams, darts, etc that you need to on the pattern. Be sure to measure both yourself and the pattern so you know they'll fit you. And if you don't trust the pattern at first, take an old thin sheet and make a practice pair to test out the pattern, this way if you need to make any changes you can make them on the sheet, then do the same to the pattern if you think you'll be using it again.|`|1f98483c8379cefb4835d42011d464c5aa	Take some pants you already have and lay them flat. Cover them with paper and rub a pencil or crayon over the seams to get an outline. Use the outline as a basic pattern for your new pants.

MolWl6zuaa	They will both give your hair the same amount of volume.<br>  I personally think that the T3 is MUCH better. The tourmaline technology is excellent and dries your hair super fast without damaging your hair as much. The blower is also super lightweight so its VERY easy to use. I've sold hundreds of T3's and every client who has purchased one has come back over the years saying that their hair has never had so much shine and movement.<br>  The Chi Turbo is good but I think Chi's strong point is their flat irons, not their blowdryers. They dont have the tourmaline technology so they dont protect your hair from the heat as much.<br>  Get the T3!!!!|`|CAYpusldaa	our salon uses both and they are both great and have the same attatchments use the vent on your roots|`|806108c8ebc9df31edb5ebbc28fbf2f1aa	Both!

b4f8854fa1ff3f75a0bfda7bf38400ccaa	Close one eye and open the other so you can see what you are doing. Start with the thin part on the inner part of the lid and then sweep it toward the outside of the lid. Keep it as close to the eyelash as you can. It creates as subtle dramatic effect.

If you want it to be a little thicker, then press a little harder on the tip and it will make the line bigger since it pushes the brush down onto the thick part. It takes time to perfect using liquid eyeliner. Just keep practicing. You'll find it gets easier and faster each day.|`|7b26ddcb29b61930d77475b9a7b4b230aa	around your eye you pull your eyelid to the side keep a steddy hand and make a line  did you cheak for directions before you bought you can also have a freiend show you.|`|a0e5d6d46c4f00d3ca733a2370f52e74aa	Use the tip. With eyes open start from the inside of the eye first (closest to nose) and glide lightly to the outside. You can work in halves if you can't help blinking. I use a wet Q-tip to correct and mistakes-just pinch the tip to make it more fine. Then apply eye shadow and it will look fine.

If that were the case, the police would have an easier time cleaning them from the streets. For all you know, the raggedy dress guy on the bus bench could be perfeclty clean and would be disgusted at the mere thought of trying that junk, However, the man in the three piece suit next to him, briefcase in lap, and playing with his PDA could have the stuff hiding in his briefcase, or even in his inside suit jacket. <br>  <br>  I looked at the Destroyed Brand jeans and think that not only $110 is rather ostenatious for jeans, but for a pair of jeans that look as though they were thisclose to Hell. I guess if one slaps a designer logo on something and an outrageous price, it will sell. I could create something similar (and much  more unique) for under $5 using a pair of worn-looking jeans from the thrift store, cheap bleach (except that I hate the smell of bleach and definately try to avoid the chemicals in it), and a pair of scissors. However, since I prefer to dress respectfully and already have a pair of worn almost to death jeans, I don't "need" to. <br>  <br>  To each their own, I guess.|`|AA12300762	...just dress like yourself. Sorry..im just kidding. Go to a "stinky" area in town and look at the people there. Also, wear a LITTLE dress, like, a longish shirt, mid-thigh and no sleeves, and really high heals.

I'm not sure how they dress these days, but this is how they used to dress when I was in HS....(and I went to HS w/ A LOT of stoners!)<br>  Tie dye, bed head, Birkenstocks, flannel, patchwork dresses w/ empire waists, a nose or eye brow ring, little to no makeup, flat cloth purse, vintage clothes (like a cool Army jacket with a Grateful Dead patch on it), long sleeved T-shirts with T-shirts over the top, ripped jeans....<br>  That's about all I can come up with. It's totally stereotypical as the stoners I  currently know don't look anything like this.

Pero sin duda la depilación láser es la mas apropiada y un poco mas costosa, con esta depilación  ya no te crecerá el bello y es un proceso que se hace poco a poco.

Lo más importante es prevenir. Utiliza Anti-Blemish Solutions Anti-Bacterial Facial Soap ma?ana y noche para una limpieza suave pero eficaz que no reseca la piel y previene los granitos. Cuando tenga un brote de granitos utiliza por la noche Anti-Blemish Solutions Night Treatment Gel en las zonas afectadas, te ayudará a eliminar esos granitos rápidamente. Por la ma?ana aplica en las zonas afectadas Anti-Blemish Solutions Spot Treatment Gel: acelerará la curación de los granitos y le permitirá maquillarse si lo desea. Para desmaquillarse utilice Anti-Blemish Solutions Cleansing Foam, que además es preventiva. <br>   <br>      Y después del grano, ?qué?    Se?ales antiguas de granitos y piel sensible o irritada pueden ser algunas de las consecuencias de haber padecido acné. Aplica Post Blemish Formula sobre la mancha o marca del granito. Si tu preocupación son las marcas del acné y las imperfecciones de tu piel, utilice Turnaround Concentrate Visible Skin Renewer ma?ana y noche después del Sistema de 3 Pasos y antes de tu tratamiento habitual. Tu piel estará más uniforme y luminosa. <br>   <br>  A mí me ha ido muy bien con estos productos, ahora lo que más uso es el Anti-Blemish Solutions Night Treatment Gel cuando me sale algún granito o algún brote y en pocos días desaparece.

It keeps your feet from sweating so blisters can't form.  If you know you are wearing specific shoes that you are worried about getting blisters from, spray your feet everyday that you can before you wear them.

The fitting of this jeans is stretch with your body type. Quality is much higher.  Seven7 jeans is replica of the orginial all man kind. The fitting of it is not the same at all.

Also, if your outfit is dark or plain, add a splash of color with a teal or blue-green headband. If your wearing an outfit which is one dark color, such as a classic LBD, small tints of color, such as hidden colors in eyes, tend to pop out more than say, with a colorful or light-colored outift. Black or dark dresses are also great if you want to show off special accessories or great shoes, or highlights in your hair, since small accents show more obviously with nothing to detract from them.|`|8ce26ab177e31095808dde4f087d556baa	Same!<br>  <br>  Wear dark green to bring out your eyes.|`|49e881516a94626804c6ed802ec85effaa	Thank God you have eyes that are beautiful and have sight...|`|aa03844510f694932e4a8a25ae266d57aa	umm wear colours like purple and yellow and brown n green. they'll bring out your eyes. no dull colours.

Direct the blowdryer just a couple inches away and move the brush in a curling fashion. Also try rollers if you dont have time to blowdry. Just snap them in and leave it there until your hair dries (but you can use this technique on dry hair too) and pull out the curlers. <br>  <br>  Ask the hairdresser to get the flip on the ends of your hair. He/She should know what youre talking about since theyre the hairdresser!

5oHzlw5daa	I don't know a thing about silk wraps but I do my own fake nails and they look as good - sometimes better than the salon.  Here's what I do.  I clean off the nail and push my cuticles back.  I make sure the nail is dry.  I take a very soft nail file and very gently rough up the nail - barely at all.  Then I glue on the fake nail.  I have best results from a brand called Broadway.  My nails are not as damaged as they were when I would have my nails done by a salon regularily.  Remember though - anytime you put fake nails on, your hurting your nail somewhat but since I've done the fake nail route myself (they last for about 2 weeks), my regular nails are presentable without fakes.|`|txL1ZmSnaa	Silk wraps,sometimes called French wraps,are great. They allow your natural nail to grow and help brittle nails to stop flaking or breaking off. A lot of people don't seem to understand that "fake" nails can be really bad for your real nail. They cut off air to your nail beds and can some times allow mold..ewww.. to grow between the fake nail and your natural ones. This can lead to your whole nail pealing off,and in some cases they will grow back even worse then they were to begin with. Silk wraps are just what they sound like. A very thin piece of silk that you stick to your nail so that it won't break or flake off on its own. You can have silk wraps done just about anyplace they do nails and you can even do them yourself at home,which is a lot cheaper then having someone else so them. The only thing I would say about doing silk wraps at home is to carefully make sure you have each nail trimmed and buffed after you put on the silk(to make sure they don't catch on anything) If you just have problems getting your nails to grow out on their own you might want to see if you can find a nail enhancer that contains horse grass. It comes in a polish from,normally clear,looks like a top coat and you can't tell they have even added anything to it. I have had lots of problems getting my nails to grow out and it has helps my nails a lot.|`|378b10c462c96bf6e4665fda708701edaa	My aunt has silk wraps and she LOVES them, they look totaly real. But you have to keep them clean underneath the nail so you don't get an infection. My aunt uses a bleach pen.|`|z2cx4ACTaa	Yes,  hi I am a manicurist.  They should not be using a drill at all on your natural nails!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  Maybe the silk would be a good alternative for you.  Is it possible to find a salon that does not use the electric file.  <br>  <br>  Silk nails are much easier on the natural nails.  They are actually little pieces of material that become completely clear when you add resin and a drying accelerator.  The can be very durable as long as you don't wear them too long.  They aslo do not require any primer which can be damaging as well.<br>  <br>   Please look for a place that does the filing by hand.

e1434520b7d6b7db2b483084c9ad434aaa	-Read the book and visit the sites below about curly hair. I did and my once horrible curly hair is now virtually frizz-free ringlets. Now I get compliments on my hair all the time! Straighten your hair- be happy for a day, learn to manage your curly hair- be happy for life!  <br>   - To style your hair using the curly-girl method you will need gel and conditioner at the minimum. Some less useful, but still nice stuff would be a blowdryer, a diffuser, butterfly clips, and a microfiber hair turban.<br>  -The main philosophy of the curly-girl method is to not use shampoo. This may sound unhygenic but it has actually made my hair less oily and dandruffy. Shampoos contain some of the same chemicals found in laundry detergent. They dry out curly hair.<br>  - Massaging of the scalp with conditioner to remove dirt is all that is needed. Then rinse and spread conditioner on the outside layer of hair and the hair at the nape of your neck. Gently comb tangles out with your fingers or a wide toothed comb and rinse.  It is also important to use gel on sopping wet hair and scrunch the hair. Then let your hair air dry or use a blowdryer with a diffuser.<br>  - I really like the garnier fructis sleek and shine leave in cream and Tressemme clean hold gel, but there are more conditioners, gels, etc. on the websites. Frizz-ease hair serum is pretty good for fighting frizz.<br>  - Your hair may seem  worse at first, but it is just adjusting. This takes 2 to 4 weeks begin working.This is hard to do if you don't read the book, or at least the websites. Naturally curly hair can be beautiful!

0945a4aedf70f2c1b0e97f72a74771eaaa	I just read in a magazine that to make your eyebrows grow back you can try men's Rogaine. Use a Q tip and rub it on your eyebrows where you want them to grow back and be patient, it takes a while but they are supposed to grow back. Just be VERY carefull not to get any into your eyes. Until then though, you can use eyebrow powder. It isn't waterproof but looks the most natural.<br>  DON'T tattoo them!

78a143bb30610658d51f4382ac2cfe90aa	You should go to a professional colorist, they'd be able to pick out the exact color by looking at your roots.|`|AA12220026	You will not be able to just put a lighter color over your darker color and end up with the right color. You will have to remove the old color (there are things called color removers, don't try to use bleach) first before applying the desired color. ~OR~ do a heavy highlight (since Jen's hair is highlighted) and shoot for the color that way. You will have to use bleach for that method though. Both of these methods would be best done by professionals not by yourself.
AA10409833	ok, so heres how to get the smoky affect, take 3 colors, in your case i'd use white, black and a pale red, apply the white eyeshadow just above your eyelid line and make it to where it follows your eyebrow line, then take the black and apply it up to your eyelid line, then take the pale red and apply it ON TO your eyelid line and blend it evenly, then take a small makeup brush and apply the white shadow just under your eye about half way, then take the black and lightly brush it on to the remainder of your under eye, as for the hair, wash it well and blowdry it, but before u blowdry take some hairspray and apply it to your hair evenly while still damp, then i would suggest using a heat protection mist such as VO5 miracle mist just before blowdrying, take a curling iron and from the top of your head take about a 1 to 2 inch strand and run the curling iron to the end of your hair, then curl under, let it set for about 10 seconds, do it as much as you like until you are satisfied with your look, it will give your hair bounce and volume which will make it look more sultry, if you dont want to do all of that the put it back in a stylish ponytail with some bang over one eye, hope that helps!!|`|343affd289b5c1a41845f59ee2933df3aa	If you really want to be sultry and sexy, go curly and long!

Sand and chestnut are really similar so just pick one that you like and get another color like black. I personally would pick Sand I think it matches with more things than Chestnut. And with the tall or short, I've seen them paired with both skirts and jeans and I think it looks cute both ways. And if you have short than yesy ou can wear your jeans over them. But honestly, no one's going to notice that you have two different colored Uggs if you have both Chestnut and Sand. and No ones going to pay attentnion to whether your skirt looks better with the tall ones or the short ones. I think both wil look cute.|`|2aae9362a4146600451ba9cc88758683aa	i love my uggs i bought mine this week!! <br>  <br>  but i have a suggestion...buy some more clothes to match, or ask for more clothes for x-mas! <br>  <br>  What do you think?

Also don't forget to get a moisturizer (most ppl with oily skin skip this step because they think that they have enough moisture already) an oil free moisturizer really helps. Make sure to go through the rotine of cleaning/moisturizing every morning and night but no more otherwise it will dry your skin out too much.

If it is human you can wet it and put any kind of product in it. If you want that wet and wavy look Sebastian's wet works really well and there is another product by elastia called silk. I use to put those on my wavy weaves all the time. If you just want that natural dry wave i would still put some kind of oil on in and either comb it with a wide tooth comb or just go through it with your fingers and get rid of the stray hairs.

b9e2bb5a25c57cc333a03588822952e8aa	Highlights or lowlights would add great dimension to your hair.  Ask your hairstylist to cut your hair with feathering shears... they cut your hair a little jagged-y, almost like a razor would.  As for makeup, try playing up those great eyes!  Green eyes really stand out when you use a golden yellow eyeshadow edged with tan shadow, then brown shadow to accent.  Or, use an aqua-colored shadow if you want something a little more daring.  Both yellow and aqua really bring out green eyes.  Use a dark brown liquid liner and a volumizing mascara (MAC fluidline eyeliner and Diorshow mascara in brown are my faves) and a natural-looking blush, either pinky or peachy in hue (I love NARS blush, myself).  Try playing down your lips by dabbing on a nude-ish matte lipcolor such as MAC lipstick in Myth (the key word when using this color is *dabbing*, as it's really light).  If you prefer lipgloss over lipstick, try MAC lipglass in Underage.  They'll all look great with your tan and really play up your eyes!|`|583f7edfef50ed17dd6ef79485c94eb5aa	Virtual Makeover is great. You can play with colors and find a look you will love. Then it shows you how to apply your new look. Just click the link below.|`|AA10497935	well, here is my advice.<br>  Makeup: try something modest and keep with the browns and neutrals. For the evening, try some liquid brown eyeline with a great smokey eye, layering with deep shadows. <br>  hairstyle: I would say hair slightly past the shoulder and layered with side swept bangs on the side. To keep the volume in your hair, blowdry real quick in the morning and use a Chi straightener to straighen bangs back to look wavy and to really define the layers. Also, get square layers in front, round in back. (experience)<br>  Color: Anything that matches your natural skin tone and eyes, which I would suggest a sexy deep brunette color that will really stand out in a nice elegant way. Also deep chestnuts will work.

22abf289c078e7ca4048561a20bf2341aa	Si, es muy sencillo. Primero te aplicas una base de tu tono y si puedes un poco bronceada pero poco no exagerada. Despues un rubor en la smejillas con brocha grande, en tono rosado quemado, es como mezcla de rojo oscuro y rosa claro. En los ojos es basico un tono dorado en los parpados.Aplica sombra cafe obscuro en las esquinas de los ojos arriba y abajo con un pincel fino. Despues aplica un poco de sombra negra cerca de las pestanas y delinea con lapiz negro lo mas cerca que puedas de la linea de las pestanas. Despues aplica una capa de rimel y aplica polvo traslucido o base y otra capa de rimel, arriba y abajo.<br>  Para finalizar utiliza un brillo labial con ligero tono rosado y ya esta.

WFIkRvNHaa	Maybelline..es mi favorita..siempre tiene lo ultimo que se lleva en maquillaje.y es anti alérgica.|`|7340bfc18e6ad8c2b9b4fc28f708efa8aa	??Hola amiga!!<br>  <br>  Veamos... no es cuestión de marcas: actualmente, casi todas las marcas tienen gamas de productos para casi todas las edades y tipos de pieles. <br>  <br>  Yo he visto en stands de Christian Dior , o de Yves St Laurent(que son marcas caras,  "para mayores") gloss de labios y polvos sueltos ideales para chicas jóvenes<br>  <br>  Actualmente, casi todas las marcas tienen productos muy adecuados para las pieles desde las más jóvenes, a las más mayores.  <br>  <br>  La cuestión no es tanto la marca, sino el tipo de maquillaje que elijas, sea la marca que sea. <br>  <br>  Maybelline y Bourjois tienen productos para las muy jóvenes, como tú. <br>  En tu caso, debes preguntar a la dependienta para que te ayude a elegir una base adecuada para tu edad y tipo de piel. Debe tener una textura muy fluida, muy líquida, libre de aceites, que deje respirar a tu piel y que no te de aspecto de "máscara" sino muy natural y muy poco coloreado. <br>  <br>  Es más: con 14 a?os, eres muy joven para ponerte base de maquillaje, y yo no te recomendaría que te pusieses ninguna.<br>  <br>  Te daría un aspecto algo artificial, y por muy buen producto que sea, el maquillaje siempre obstruye los poros de la piel. Si comienzas con 14 a?os, ya no podrás prescindir de él. <br>  <br>  Si quieres empezar a experimentar con cosméticos, te recomiendo solo un poquito de brillo en los labios (gloss), y como mucho un poco de rímel transparente en las pesta?as.... o un poquito de colorete suave en las mejillas (pero esto...?como mucho!) Nada más. <br>  <br>  Tienes una piel muy fresca y joven como para tratar de camuflar nada con base de maquillaje. <br>  <br>  Pero si no cambias de opinión, elige una base  muy fluida, libre de aceites, y del tono lo más parecido posible a tu piel y aplica poca cantidad extendiendo el producto muy bien. <br>  <br>  Y sobretodo, siempre limpia muy bien tu rostro por la ma?ana y por la noche (eso siempre, pero si te maquillas, aun más)<br>  <br>  ?Saludos amiga, espero haberte ayudado!|`|d7219b1153d0dd0e312878edf9a8b1abaa	Te recomiendo Maybelline. Lo único que me gusta de Boujois es su máscara de pesta?as, el resto me parece bastante... no se, no me gusta...<br>  <br>  Maybelline tampoco me parece una gran marca, pero si estás entre esas dos yo me quedaría con esta. Y no es una marca para mayores, yo a veces compro algo, laca de u?as por ejemplo, que es la única marca que he encontrado que tiene laca de color *****; o máscara de pesta?as, y no soy mayor... mujer, que tengo 25 a?os... aunque teniendo 14 te debo parecer una abuela.<br>  <br>  Saludos.|`|6abe63553fc03bd07f84839efb561076aa	ES MEJOR Q NO USES BASE <br>  PUEDES USAR UN POLVO COMPACTO PERO BASE NO CREO<br>   Y PARA CONTESTAR TU PREGUNTA  MAYBELLINE SIN DUDA|`|8fb09833f4e0e9d3a14f0205fb0dcb4baa	Yo uso el eyer liner de bourjouis y la pinta labios de pincel liquido, super bonito, y juvenil  y me queda fenomenal.|`|HMIRUbVYaa	maybelline sin dudas, aunque a tu edad la piel esta muy losana como para usar bases son para gente mayor y normamente cubrir sus imperfecciones, te recomiendo los polvos conpactos, es mejor que la base y mas sencillo de usar|`|o1LvSs77aa	Definitivamente Maybelline es mejor marca, pero si tienes sólo 14 a?os no creo que sea tiempo de usar una base. Quizá un estuche de polvos compactos por si de repente te  brilla un poco la cara, brillo para los labios y cosas así....aprovecha ahora que tú no tienes necesidad de utilizar la base!|`|13HyiT9jaa	Las dos marcas son bastante buenas, Maybelline da muy buenos resultados calidad-precio, pero tampoco hay que desprestigiar a Bourjois ya que es la marca para pieles jovenes de Chanel y por lo tanto tambien hablamos de una buena calidad. Para decidirte por una de las dos te aconsejo que primero busques el tono mas parecido a tu piel, que es aquel que se funde con tu color natural cuando llevas la cara lavada, ni un tono mas ni un tono menos, no olvides que el maquillaje es para hacer que tu piel sea uniforme no para lucir otro color que no sea el tuyo o quedará antinatural a plena luz del dia.  Las reglas basicas son:<br>  1- encontrar la textura que mas te convenga (polvo, compacto, crema, mus,...)<br>  2- tono adecuado a tu color de piel.<br>  <br>  Personalmente yo siempre lo hago asi y me funciona a la hora de elegir mi maquillaje. Suerte!|`|2252ejWxaa	Lo mejor es de Maybelline.<br>  <br>  Suerte|`|33fe24be5af32c7ab9356e4156335c56aa	Maybelline<br>  Acertaras seguro|`|9ksMdoqMaa	hola!!! Te aconsejaria q no empezaras a maquillarte con bases y fondos de maquillaje aun...ers joven para taparte la piel...<br>  <br>  Siempre puedes pintarte la linia y darte un suave colorete q te realce los pomulos y la cara... claro pero si tu tiesn ganas de maquillarte nadie te lo va a quitar de la cabeza!!<br>  <br>  Esas son mis dos marcas preferidas y ninguna es de mas o menso major, las dos tienen productos para gente mas joven y para gente mayor...<br>  <br>  Intenta que tu base de maquillaje no sea agresiva par tu piel escojela siempre acorde con tu tono y textura de piel...te consejaria la PURE MAKEUP de Maybellin NY.<br>  Es un fondo de maquillaje de gel y crema compuesta de  50% de agua pura, es super suave y ligera para la piel y te cubre los granitos...es super buena...<br>  Pero te repito que no abuses vale? solo para tardes y ocasiones especiales que con un pco de blush en tu rostro y una linia y sombra q ilumine tu mirada estaras perfecta...ya tendras tiempo de maquillarteee :)<br>  <br>  Un saludooo|`|9zVrCGRGaa	Hola, pues la verdad te cuento q yo utilizo maybelline New York en tono Honey, y me a parecido muy buena, te la recomiendo.|`|c78f8e0113c6c6a77c54511c5c3552ebaa	Te recomiendo Maybelline New York|`|hzuG1Twtaa	yo te recomiendo que tan joven empieces a usar la de bourjois<br>  a mi por lo menos esa mi gusta mas no estan fuerte para la piel<br>  <br>  saluditos|`|d3f0eada86e6bdd2c92d3a8d724604c4aa	Quien te dijo que maybelline es para adultos al contrario es muy suave por lo menos en venezuela es para adolescente no se donde vivas pero es buena marca.|`|m2v4m4sbaa	Yo no empezaría todavía a pintarme porque la piel después de los a?os se resiste y si ahora que eres peque?a te empiezas a pintar cuando tengas treinta vas a tener unas arrugas que para que.Pero bueno haz lo que quieras y por supuesto te recomiendo bourjois porque la gama de colores es mas amplia y son todos preciosos.Saluditos ; )

Tell the person to go and buy the blazer in the store and take it to a tailor to be altered.  She's in for a shock.

aAPMG8Dwaa	First of all get foundation or creme that matches your skin with a yellow undertone. Here's how: 1. After cleansing your skin with a gentle cleanser, apply an oil-free moisturizer over your entire face to create a smooth surface. 2. Using a small, pointed concealer brush or a clean finger, gently tap foundation directly onto the center of the zit until it fades away. Don't blend the foundation in too much or you will just wipe away the product. 3. Set the foundation so it stays put all day with a touch of either loose or pressed translucent powder.|`|0c96cbc60b4d44c563aaa4a99f13af65aa	if the foundation makes it more noticeable then don't use it.  try using a concealer to cover the redness.  amazing cosmetics works very well it covers every blemish you have, but it is very expensive, $40 a tube, it was the makeup used for the Oscars.  <br>  <br>  try using a different kind of makeup that can cover it better....liquid makeup works better than powder unless you are using a mineral based makeup...mineral based makeups work great like bare minerals or pur minerals those both work great but are also very expensive. <br>  <br>  find time to wash your face it is very important because some kinds of acne can leave scars and you don't want that.  wash your face with plain dove face wash...it really does work.  make time to wash your face it only takes like two mins.|`|AA12147808	Use cover up if you've got to go out... but at night before going to bed.. first wash face, and place a small dab of toothpaste on the pimple... it'll help dry it out so it's not so noticeable... also try to drink at least 8 glasses of water a day. Water helps cleanse your body of impurities.. not to mention giving you softer, smoother skin all over|`|LA2GWBPHaa	Do this super carefully!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  1. heat up an iron<br>  2. get a soft cloth<br>  3. heat the cloth up with the iron<br>  4. make sure the cloth is hot, but not toooo hot<br>  5. press the hot cloth gently against your pimple and hold it there for 30 seconds<br>  6. do this 3 times<br>  6 1/2. the pimple might start becoming bigger, but that's a GOOD thing. remember: it will only go away when it's done with the whole cycle. small to big and then back to small<br>  7. wash your face with cold water<br>  8. put a little toothpaste on the pimple and let it dry overnight, or for atleast 2 hours<br>  9. wash your face in the morning, and voila!!!!!!|`|3a1e0329000e5c31fa5943c23c58240aaa	cut it out w/ a knife|`|7L5T8BDZaa	I dont know how to cover a pimple but i do know that TOOTHPASTE DOES NOT do your pimple any better<br>  the fluoride in the toothpaste can actually worsten your pimple!!!|`|Tg38KRbMaa	hang a picture over it|`|Yry76PgHaa	Right when you wake up and right before you go to sleep wash your face....Put cover up on it before you go out...|`|Z0dXXQKhaa	If the foundation is oil-free...it won't clog your pores.

7aac02d5c9b0f0b8ec90e1adb11eebd5aa	That happens to me alot too. Its avoidable though without turning down the heat. Use smaller strips of hairs and make sure you get as close as you can to the root and most importantly press quickly near the roots and longer as you go down. I also somethings press quickly 2-4 near the roots which will still straighten without leaving any individual crease.|`|1O1ZyEhpaa	What i have noticed when i get a dent its because the heat setting is too high|`|eBT0KY4Faa	flip your hair around the chi and turn 180 degrees. then slowly pull down. go on youtube they show you how to do it|`|MQbunBNKaa	you arent starting @ the top of your head its a crease from the hot iron. i suggest getting a chi curling iron a flat iron isnt made to curl hair. thats why its leaving a crease:)|`|Ws1qOP1Haa	heat is too high and your leaving it in that place too long with curls and straighteners I've found you got to keep moving.|`|BxW2Lj7waa	If you can, lower the heat setting. Or when you first apply the iron to your hair, don't clamp it too long at the top.
GKJEgidzaa	1. Fair skin tone  2. I think you need to have your hair stripped and go for a lighter brown, a warmer tone.  3. You could probably wear most colors of clothes, try lighten things up a little, (I can see your going for the whole 'emo' look, but its not working). Im not saying deck yourself in abercrombie, I hate preppy styles too, I dress very alternative, I just do it in a more sophisticated way. Try skinny jeans and smock tops with vintage boots etc.    Jewelry, go for statement jewlery, long gold necklaces (boho style), hoop earrings fun rings etc.    For makeup i say, get a nice liquid foundation to give yourself a bit of a glow, but do not over do it. Keep it simple, as you do not want to look like a drag queen, maybe less eye liner? its making your eyes look a lot smaller than they actually are.  Eye shadow colors that you would suit are: Warm brown and bronze tones, purples and earth colors, grey...

You are obviously very young and that will give you a fresher look.  For your clothes, I think you should wear some more versatile colours not so much black or dark colours. Have a look at this website and get some tips: www.topshop.com|`|0zxiLWdcaa	I think you have very pale skin? At least it looks like it from the picture, what color are your eyes? Are they fairly dark or medium? If your eyes are really dark, keep your hair dark! You would be considered high contrast if you have dark hair and eyes with pale skin, a lot of models are high contrast. If your eyes are medium, I think if you put in some low lights in your hair it would be really pretty. I think you should do a hair mask or gloss, your hair would look even better if it was super shiny! Or use a deep conditioner. Again I cant tell what color your eyes are, but if they are brown, grey eyeshadow looks really pretty and will make them pop, with black eyeliner, consider using liquid on the top. If they have some green in them, green shadow is really pretty too. I think a teal dress or top would be really pretty, cool colors.|`|BNcNAMNPaa	1.fair skintone  2.i think you would look good if you had your hair a lighter brown. It is all round your face, so i suggest having your long fringe cut and shaped. Maybe straighten your hair, but back-comb it a bit at the top so it isn't flat. And let it grow a little bit longer.  3.wear mascara, brown eyeshaddow to bring out your brown eyes. Or try the 'smoky eye look '( google it) . And wear some lipgloss or lipstick a subtle red colour.    And lastly, wear some bright clothes! i think you would look really good in blue or red.    Good Luck!!!

BLsZitfCaa	My parents had a homemade remedy for this, my little brother had the same problem. Mix Warstecher sauce, pepper, guacamole, salsa, and melted cheese together. Then, you need to soak your nails in it for about fifteen minutes to a half an hour. They taste terrible, but that's the point. But if you wash your hands, you need to reapply. You let it dry, then you can rub off the little bits that may be on your finger. But then again, duct tape or scotch tape or band-aids over your fingers always work.|`|a8beb0d654de7b0d4a12f03c9588ff54aa	put hairspray on them- itll make your finger nails taste gross|`|45fd30140d3a3bfc5302e8054b402fa6aa	Putting nail polish remover on your fingers daily, so when you go to put them in your mouth, they taste awful!!

kC4SGxaQaa	Brushing your hair repeatedly doesn't help, it actually makes it worse. You should only brush your hair when you absolutely need to, otherwise it WILL get poofier. Don't put water in your hair either, because that will counteract the straightener. =] I recommend using the Garnier Brilliantine Shine products, it'll make it sleek and shinier! =] Good luck!|`|aOEw9mMJaa	Redken Outshine Anti-frizz Polishing Milk, Styling No. 1 Redken<br>  Outshine Anti-frizz Polishing Milk, Styling No. 1<br>  <br>  try this it works....

SpEabKXyaa	Honestly, I have the same problem. My hair just seems to ALWAYS be greasy. But it's part of being a teenager (which is what I assume you are. Sorry if I'm wrong.)  I realized that part of the problem was because I wasn't rinsing my shampoo/conditioner enough. Also, using products like gel, spray, mousse, etc. can make it super greasy as well.   Too much conditioner could also do it.  Or a mixture of everything I listed.     And, if you do this, try not to run your fingers through your hair.    Hope I helped. =)|`|X2lesqhRaa	herbal essence "degunkifier"|`|aBhW9YVXaa	pantene is great!!|`|9189a5150c78e5bb8152c39d8f0d1579aa	yes you should use shampoo for greasy hair|`|CxzD782Paa	yes...they make a neutrogena shampoo that you use about once a week that cleans all the gunk out of your hair.
92aa212ddbc7e554157c9077c91626d1aa	I don't know if you have Sally's Beauty Supply store where you're from but a couple years ago I bought a ceramic straightner from there and it works GREAT. I don't know the exazct name of it but I think they only sell it at Sally's it's called the Gold Series, if you can't get to a SBS I'd check on Ebay for it, it's great!! Good Luck!!|`|VCBkKDGtaa	i have to say the best is the wigo jade hair straightener, it heats up REALLY hot, but it keeps the heat in the jade plates, it doesnt burn your hair! i was once at the mall and they had a stand selling them, and ihave really curly and poofy hair and it worked GREAT!!! however, im not exactly too sure where to get it, but somewhere off the internet probably, and its a kinda pricy, around 100$ but yeah you should get it if its in your price range it is the best ever!|`|beSQeL9haa	mines good, but if u do get one, don't straighten it everyday, it's BORING|`|crUaV2Dcaa	Definitely the Chi Turbo 2" Hair Straightener:<br>  <a href="http://www.hairstraightening.net/CHI-straightening-iron.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.hairstraightening.net/CHI-str...</a><br>  <br>  It used to take me about 40-50 minutes to straighten my naturally wavy and semi-thick hair...now it takes me less than 10 minutes to straighten all my hair. It works great because it has settings of which heat you want to use, and 10 seconds after you hit the on button it is ready to use. When using this straightener, it works best on high heat, but it is also important to use some kind of hair protector. Any store that carries hair products will carry heat protecter for flat irons and blow driers, so just ask them for one. My favorite is the vo5 one: <a href="http://www.walgreens.com/dbimagecache/234609.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.walgreens.com/dbimagecache/23...</a><br>  It costs around $200 in most stores but if you look around online or on ebay you can get it for as cheap as $80 - $90. I bought mine on eBay for $90 and it works great. [Remember, thats over a $110 discount] You can buy it here for only $128 <a href="http://www.hairstraightening.net/cgi-bin/getthis.cgi." rel="nofollow">http://www.hairstraightening.net/cgi-bin...</a><br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|jCPvzrDuaa	i would probably say the Chi because it is so quick and easy. Also there are many kinds of Chis so you can get the one that best fits your hair type
37112ce449bee374721e274dfc0d1643aa	Helen.|`|bcY7cWXVaa	I indeed have it. <br>  It is indeed good stuff.<br>  Look it up on Amazon ...they usually have a lot of feedback from people. <br>  If it is for a gift then it really is a good one ...if it is for you then I would suggest a razor for that bikini line .|`|mf86LcOlaa	yer its ok (my brother has it)
es4XOyR3aa	u cna get a good result but the heat from the air and when u sleep you sweat slighty especially in this weather causes the humidiity and makes ur hair curly and frizzuy i have the same problem! try using a dehumidity heat protector avaiable in boots and frizz protection instead|`|zCWcoFhZaa	Hi it could be for loads of reasons, I find if I blow dry my hair then use heat protections spray straighten and then when I get up in the morning its wavy. I blame the heat protection spray as it wets the hair, Plus when you sleep you might obviously sweat which causes you hair to curl.<br>  <br>  I that is the case I would just let the hair dry on its own, then straighten in the morning, or dry it and then leave it till the morning to straighten all the time. As it point less straightening it before bed if you have to straighten it again in the morning, Its only going to damage your hair using the hair straighteners all the time.<br>  <br>  If I wear my hair down which I dont because I have to straighten it everyday if I do which damages my hair and its bad enough as it is.<br>  <br>  Just make sure you hair is fully dry.|`|IeW9wMsCaa	go over your hair with hair dryer on a cool setting after you have finished staightning,it should stay straight for at least 3 days
1A3w9ENnaa	maybe its bcoz just bcoz|`|000jzVpQaa	I've found the same thing with Dorothy Perkins before, and when I asked why it was, the person in the shop told me it's so that they can attract people to use the website for web exclusives, and the store for store exclusives, so both get used. I'd imagine it's the same reason for River Island.
BNcNAMNPaa	yes tight(ish) bootcuts.  it is too hard from that pic too tell the name/brand|`|hIMmtrYgaa	their bootcut  :)  cause they arent QUITE skinny jeans      theyre kindof like this    http://www.abercrombie.com/webapp/wcs/st...    http://www.abercrombie.com/webapp/wcs/st...    http://www.hollisterco.com/webapp/wcs/st...|`|1bwLBV2aaa	Hi! Its hard to say what name/brand label they are without seeing a company design or logo. Otherwise they look like bootcut jeans to me. They aren't quiet skinny jeans, and they aren't enough flare, so in between those is bootcut. They look cute!
EK3nwsAcaa	i dont think so   not as far as i know or remember
jYy6dDAZaa	Most PPL are right-handed so   Men buttoned their jackets on the right so they can unbutton one handed for a sword fight  Women buttoned on the left so the could unbutton and suckle their babies while doing housework like cooking.|`|XuExU7KMaa	I thought this was to make it easier to distinguish between them.
a69b8dd90d35b9553cfe95247afce8aeaa	One video has smokey eyes and the other has light blue pearly shade.<br>  <br>  I do the smokey eyes all the time. Its just the only thing that looks good on me.  Its black eyeliner and dark gray shadow, u can even use black shadow, just smudge it with your finger.  Sometimes i dont even use mascara. Put the shawdow on the lid and extend slightly past the crease and out, so your eye looks bigger.<br>  <br>  For the light blue shadow, looks like shes still has the black eye liner and black mascara. I think just on the rim of the lid, by the lashes, there's a dark streak of gray, then theres the light blue pearl color extend over the the eye crease...Usually this looks good on olive or tan skin.|`|SHAof2O2aa	If u do not have long lashes.. try fakes. Especially the type that have more lashes towards the outer end. Go easy on brow liners.. so that eyes grab attention|`|WppnnvtMaa	Try dark ( black or brown ) eyeliner, and a charcoal black/gray<br>  eyeshadow for your lids, and black mascara. Like an intense smokey eye? Ya that's what it looks like to me so good luck!!
s3aVfaZPaa	Wear some cute flats, wear a cute perhaps matching scarf. if you want you can wear one of those boho beanie type hats (the ones that droop slightly off your head) then wear some bangles :]|`|BUApA0R7aa	really bright tights or leggings,maybe with a pattern, and a matching belt to replace the black one then either a neutral boot or converse----hope this helps:)|`|HVNGuRwyaa	put some cute necklaces on, and instead of wearing the black belt wear a cute white one, and a silver purse to go with it with some cute braclets.    or get a yellow purse with that, and some cute white necklaces.|`|aH4mU2Xcaa	add a sparkly pin and colorful flats =)|`|EevMUAqJaa	What a gorgeous dress! Bright accessories will add a pop of color. Try red, yellow, or pink.|`|iXMHf5zwaa	Not neon stuff!  Mabe try getting some cute shoes, either heels or not, and adding some cute jewelry  I don't think a belt would look very good, it looks like you are trying too hard.  Try to do your hair so it looks really cute, and wear natural makeup, maybe with some sparkles by your eyes.    JUST DON"T TRY TOO HARD!!!!!!!!|`|76usxNkvaa	your 15? i think thats a ugly dress sorry.. well at least for a 15 year old going to da mall its more of a old lady dress|`|6ZxZoT7Raa	It is already cute but you can wear a multi colored neon and black shirt found at hottoppic i think   and you can wear some nice skinny jeans with it  sorry if it doesnt open up lol|`|oOZyl5BNaa	that is already a cute outfit by itself. if you over due it.. it might turn out tacky! i would wear that with some big stud earrings maybe a bracelet and some cute shoes matching the button color or bright red shoes... with red lips =D|`|8RV2Z4lzaa	looks a lil mature for sumone 15 tomake it look a lil bit more for a teen try red pumps or flats that ad a dash of color wear lots of silver n red braclets to n maybe a small neclace NOT A BIG NECLACE cuz that would be way tooo much  GOOD LUCK|`|IBVWEzYzaa	Cute dress but its very mature looking so in order to have fun with it, try using bright colored accessories! Like a hot pink bag or shoes and colorful necklace.|`|2MO244XRaa	I would use a more vibrant belt. Or, wear black stockings/leggings with a really bright colored shoe. Hope it helps! Good luck!

It's a district in Tokyo, that if I remember correctly, has a lot of those styles.    The reason you can't find any is because the clothing isn't called harajuku.

02JtHRfGaa	It has nothing to do with the name Feria. It has to do with the black. black always has a super staying power. See color is actually molecules that get into the hair shaft. They come in  many different sizes. Unfortunatly, black has tiny tiny molecules so they pack into the hair, making it very hard if not impossible to lift without frying your hair or turning it orange. Im sorry, there isnt a great fix for black. You could try to bleach it, but I would go to a professional, or you may end up breaking all of your hair off. And just as I tell all of my clients, STAY AWAY FROM BLACK!!|`|GQ6nCU43aa	yea once you go black it's hard to go back. you will f*ck up your hair trying to fix it... sorry. my hair was naturally really dark brown and when i went to get it dyed for the first time, the lady at the salon asked me if i dyed my hair black and i said no and then she said asked me if i was sure. i said yup. i was wondering why at first (this was abt a year ago) but overtime i figured out why. hope this was helpful!|`|AOrQ5bAHaa	Yea your pretty much screwed unless you bleach it<br>  Wich I wouldnt recommend, b/c you'll mess your hair up BADLY.

8qr0fncNaa	what kind of "something" do you have in mind?  Do you want to cut it short? color it? curl?<br>  anyway, whatever you decide, you have to consider the following:<br>  1.  the type of hair you have? is it straight, wavy, curly, frizzy, etc.<br>  2.  the shape of your face - certain hairstyles depend on the shape of your face.<br>  3. manageability - can you fix and style your hair after you've been to the salon? or will you be forever dependent on a hairstylist?<br>  4.  yourself - what is your personality? What do you want to achieve with doing something to your hair? <br>  Lastly, choose the hairstyle you want. You could try out wigs first (If that is allowed) so you could see how the style affects you? Are you comfortable with having that particular style or cut?<br>  When you've determined all these and still want to go for it, then do so. Reminder:  if the first couple days, your hair does not seem to look right, just give it time.  It just needs to settle.  Don't forget to take good care of your hair.|`|cc5931a029870bd0f7ccdcb3cf45c75baa	if your mom wont let you cut it or get it dyed try to pin it op in dieerent ways. try ponytails with flowers to match your clothes, braids, buns, pigtails, part the side and sweep the front in your face put in a ponytails and let ir hang, make it curly, wet it-put setting lotion on it-twist or braid it  before you go to bed then take it down before you go to school looks so cute!!!!!|`|acaecb94fab0241d9f60bc5196c2c075aa	You could have your hair layered. You can have it long or short layers. You didn't say what color you hair is but you could put high lights in it. It just depends on what you like. When you go to the salon they will have lots of books you can look at. There will be a ton of different styles to look at. I hope this helped.

WgbMJSWKaa	There are a few ways to straighten your hair.<br>  <br>  1. Chemically. This is very permanent, though and I'm sure your parent's wouldn't like it.<br>  2. Mechanically. Hair straighteners never do the trick for me, so I use a flat iron (which works much better)<br>  3. Shampooily. I have fallen in LOVE with Sunsilk brand. The shampoos really help, especially if you get both the shampoo and conditioner. Now, this won't work AS WELL AS the other ways, but it's a lot less permanent and won't damage your hair. It's also a lot cheaper and your parents would probably be more open to it.|`|58kkmNWHaa	I did the same thing what the person said.I took a regular iron and used it.It does work.Trust me!!!!I hope this helps your question.Have a nice night.|`|JTkEOw3Caa	a good straightening balm, de frizzer and well conditioned hair<br>  get a flat brush with holes and use a blow dryer to slide down your hair along with the brush<br>  this may or may not work depending on your hair type but this is what i do when i blow dry my hair which is fairly thick and only has a slight natural wave|`|b7eb7537619ab144708930553834b8e6aa	the next best thing to a straightener is a flat iron...it may take some time depending on your hairs volume, texture,and thickness but its a best bet.|`|j7PPQRVraa	Dry your hair with a blowdryer until it is about 80% dry, then use a large barrel round brush to finish drying.

You also let her know that you're the one dealing with your hair not her, and she needs to understand that this is what you want. We all learn from our mistakes; if it doesn't work then say "mom you were right, i didn't need my hair straightened, and it's fine just the way it is." If it works then you say" see mom, i knew what i was talking about. I love my hair like this."

X8QBvaxuaa	Using a chopstick, pencil, pen, any stick - hold your hair in a pony tail.  Place the chopstick underneath the pony tail, hold onto the left end of it (closest to your left ear) and start twisting clockwise.

Then, when the chopstick is sticking straight up in the air, bring it towards your head and tuck it behind the twisted hair.

It gives a nice athletic or pulled together look, depending on the headband. If you prefer, you can also tie it back in a ribbon, that often looks presentable and sereous. Sometimes, I  just braid it, and if I want to leave it down, I use Joico ICE whip mousse and let it air dry. Hope that helps, and good luck!|`|2808e6423a91f3941bed9b66ff388c11aa	There are hairpins that you can get that are similar to bobby pines except they are wider at the end and have no tension.

wnnudNp5aa	The professional make-up artists all swear by plain ol' Great Lash (pink tube with green lid). Personally, my current favorite is Volume Exact by Cover Girl. The special brush really helps cut down on spider lashes. I've tried 'em all. Had some good results with Voluminous by Loreal, too. Cover Girl Triple Aquastay was great, but it's been disconituned, I think. Like all good things!<br>  You might have better luck with mascaras formulated for lash definition than volumizing, I don't know. Seems like that would be what they're made for, defining the lashes and keeping them separated.<br>  The trick, in my opinion, is not so much what you use, but how you apply it! As you've noticed, when you open a new tube, way too much comes out on the brush, and glops on your lashes. First shake your tube before opening, do not "pump" the wand in and out, that forces air (and possibly bacteria) into the tube, shortening it's life span. Wipe the wand lightly on a clean tissue to remove clumps and excess macara, then brush through your lashes, slightly wiggling the wand from side to side as you go. I only use the eyelash comb if I still get the occasional stray clump, after the mascara has dried. Use it while it's still wet, I guarantee they'll all stick together! You can apply a second coat if you need to, just wait for the first coat to dry thoroughly, or they can get stuck together when you apply the second coat.<br>  I've heard of heating your mascara tube in hot water to get a few more applications when it's nearly used up, but I've never tried it. Might help, probably can't hurt. Just try my method and see if it works for you. Patience and a steady hand go a long way, too! Good luck!|`|cWBsLpjwaa	Apply one coat by placing the brush close to the lash line then wiggle it back and forth to seperate the lashes and lift through.

In-between coats use an eyelash comb to  separate your lashes. Good luck, I hope this helps.|`|bNdMR66Paa	If you have one of those eyelash combs that works, use it after you apply your mascara to comb out your lashes or when you take out the brush from the mascara when you get almost to the top use the handle to go around in circles while pulling the brush out to get off all the excess mascara.  Hope this helps!|`|9ND7Zd7vaa	Well unless you have short blonde lashes, and want them just darker, not lengthened, do NOT use the comb. What works really well for me, is those double sided mascaras. With the white then the black, because you can apply as much or as little white as you want black, and it acts as a perfect guide for the black. Another tip you might try is to just apply the mascara to the middle/tip of the lash, because that way you are lengthening without globbing it onto the roots. <br>  <br>  :) goodluck, i know the crisis!|`|9d00d58ca963fd44a9ff11ba3dfb62e8aa	take a piece of tissue and blot blot blot the excess off the mascara wand (from the tip and then all sides of the mascara brush). You'll see that there's a lot of excess mascara that goes onto the wand when you take it out of the bottle. After blotting, use a light hand to apply mascara (emphasis on LIGHT HAND) and start from the root to the tip. use the tip of the mascara wand for those hard to reach areas like the lashes at the inner and outer corners. be patient with this, but you'll come out with lashes that aren't clumped together. and don't put mascara on your lower lashes. they'll just smear.|`|ZvVt6DGsaa	i hate that too! and to be honest i think its all about the kind of masacara not really the brush or anything! first make sure you dont have to much actually on the brush and dont open it and move it up and down a hundred times before taking it out! just kind of brush some of it off on the top to the access off! i mean i am not expert or anything but this is what i do and it seem so work! i have been using physicians formula mascara! its great! i find that the thicker mascaras tend to clump more when i put them on...this is a bit thinner of a mascara but it def. adds length and volume.....and it really doesnt clump! also make sure to close your mascara tight and to not use to for to long! make-up doesnt last forever!!!!!! so those are my personal little tips.....like i siad im no expert but those things tend to work well for me!|`|e16f6cdf6b2703fd3fe4977c4e69d495aa	when you take the brush out of the tube, slightly shake it. for a couple seconds or so. that way, the mascara will dry just a slight bit to minimize clumps. : )<br>  <br>  also, i saw this on celebrity make-up, that if you take a CLEAN flea comb, and use that to brush it through, it gets rid of clumps. it sounds really gross but because the bristles are so fine and so close together, they push out clumps and seperate lashes.|`|iesXMGFxaa	You are using the wrong brand of mascara.

AA11251333	Well I am a Makeup artist and just to let you know the Smoky Eye look is IN right now. I love doing the smoky eye look and the best way instead of wearing all black is to do the same preperation just use color from pink to blue, just make sure you cordinate with the outfit. Try that and I will bet you will try it again and again. I just dont like using black alot. <br>  <br>  DO NOT PUT ON THE INNER RIM IF U DO IT WILL BE SOME CONSEQUENCES.<br>  <br>  USE A SMUDGER PENCIL.<br>  <br>  If you do this look make sure, you with use eye liner in pencil or liquid you can get that in color also.<br>  <br>  If you eyes are: Blue <br>  <br>  Try: Brown and rose. Warm shades contrast the coolness of blue eyes, making them stand out. Apply from lashlines to creases and top with black mascara.<br>  <br>  If you eyes are: Brown <br>  <br>  Try: Green and gold. Both shades will pick up the colored flecks found in brown eyes. Choose a slightly shimmer texture, and apply from lashlines to browbones, blending well.<br>  <br>  If you eyes are: Green <br>  <br>  Try: Lavender and mocha. Purple shades contrast your color, making eyes look dramatic; warmer shades of mocha complement green, giving a natural effect. Wear mocha for day, lavender for night, and top both with brown mascara. <br>  <br>  If you eyes are: Hazel <br>  <br>  Try: Deep green and pale yellow. Depending on your mood, choose a shadow shade that matches different flecks in your eyes. For a twist, apply shadow, then line eyes with the same color, using a liner brush dipped in water.<br>  <br>  Anyone-Can-Wear-'Em-Shades: Charcoal, chocolate, black. (Tip: Since they can look heavy on the lid, use these colors as liners to complement any shadow hue.)<br>  <br>  To apply pencil liner precisely, gently pull the outer corner of your eyes so your lashes make a straight line. Angle the tip of the pencil toward your lashes and lightly draw from inner to outer corner.<br>  <br>  I hope that works.|`|nnPQLaCoaa	check the links below for beauty tips to:-- * How to get Smoky Eyes<br>  <a href="http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-42eT_e8_b7RZOQkWnNJEAw--?cq=1&p=3">http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-42eT_e8_b...</a>|`|NDCssSsTaa	I would suggest this: <br>  <a href="http://www.seventeen.com/hair-skin-makeup/best-tips/smokey-eyes-bbt-0306" rel="nofollow">http://www.seventeen.com/hair-skin-makeu...</a>|`|o0R3qgkpaa	i love that look :)<br>  try this web site:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://beauty.about.com/od/allaboutyoureyes/ht/smokeyes.htm" rel="nofollow">http://beauty.about.com/od/allaboutyoure...</a>|`|tNh0SHr3aa	hello <br>  <a href="http://www.videojug.com/film/how-to-create-a-smoky-eye-effect" rel="nofollow">http://www.videojug.com/film/how-to-crea...</a> <br>  this  is a great video that will show you how to do that step byt step.

vFF2cEHfaa	I'm a makeup freak. And all my friends and family know that I always welcome new products. So I have everything you can think of. I've tried doing Mary Kay and Avon, but the fact of the matter is, is that it just gets boring, and it's not worth it if they dont come out with new stuff. And people get sick of you asking them all the time, if they want to buy anything. As for Bare Minerals, if I were you, I would run out and buy some right now!!! It's the best stuff you could use. It's all natural so it won't clog your pores like MAC does, and it coat very well!!!|`|T6VmhdAeaa	I have never used bare minerals so I can't compare however I can tell you anything you want to know about the Mary Kay business.  I have been a Mary Kay customer for 10 years and a consultant for the last 3.  I love it and never found it hard.  I am not say you don't have to work however I much rather work hard for myself then someone else plus I work less hours and choice when and how much I want to work.|`|38824a69f42c37f0e048158c3d0e0a30aa	I'm not sure what bare minerals is, but I know that Mary Kay is definitely not all-natural.  I think their products are okay to pretty good, but I don't like all the chemicals used in everything.|`|AA12212264	I use Mary Kay cosmetics, I don't know if they're any better...but I can tell you that it works on normal to oily skin, but also for ppl with sensitive skin. It lasts for quite a while and the cleansers and masks leaves your skin feeling so soft. As for the business, I have no idea, why not give them a call and find out, the women I've had dealings with are both friendly and ready to answer your questions|`|C7ztgjRkaa	I would have to say the only way to find out which is better is by trying it. My aunt loves Estee Lauder, I think its aweful. The lipstick is too slimy and doesn't last, the perfume stinks, but she uses it and it works on her. It just doesn't mix with me. At all. <br>  As for starting the business, it's $100 for the starter pack, I think that is a great deal. But your success depends on how many people you know. Like avon or home interior you have to have parties and put the stuff on people and let them see how it feels and smells and that's what gets them to buy. Free samples are a good fishline. They draw people in. Sales depend more on you than the product sometimes, you have to be a real talker on how wonderful the stuff is.|`|UMQgpnvzaa	my daughter jumped in and never stuck with it.  i went to her debut.  i liked the products.  it looks difficult.  i see vendors at fairs and festivals.  lots of soliciting.|`|QW27ZMMUaa	Mary Kay is easy to start.

44bVH1tOaa	When you start off wearing mascara, I'd try using a waterproof mascara. Because you are not used to make up you may rub your eyes. With waterproof mascara if you rub your eyes you won't have streaks.|`|FklngtvCaa	eyes:  1. don't wear black eyeliner. it's really harsh! instead,  skip eyeliner entirely and wear just mascara.  2. if you decide you really want to wear black eyeliner,  use it lightly. smeared all around doesn't look good.  3. figure out which colors will enhance your eyes:  blue = purple, charcoal, brown  green = purple, bright blue  brown = blue, brown  gray = black, darker or lighter gray than your eyes  hazel = jewel tones  ^ no one should wear pink eyeliner.  at least imo (in my opinion) it makes them look like they  have pinkeye.    face:  1. use colors that actually match your skin. ask your  mom, a friend, or someone at a makeup counter to help you.  2. blend! invest in sponges or brushes, they're much better than your fingers. sponges are really cheap, too.  3. moisturize your face before you use makeup  4. don't use too much liquid foundation    lips and cheeks:  1. stand in the light and pinch your cheeks.  did you turn pink or peach?   2. if you're pink, stick with rosy and magenta colors.  if you're peach, stick to neutural brown and apricot-y colors.|`|JqDkLWeTaa	moisterize before u use any foundation make sure foundation is exactly ur tone   and also dont over so ur eyes enhance ur features dont over power them|`|iYL37RfPaa	don't pile blusher on, and cover you whole cheeks with it, that looks stupid,  with blusher, just apply it on your cheek bones, do fish face, and just apply along that bone,    Dont do loads of coats of mascara, it goes clumpy,  apply 2 coats, don't wait for it to dry inbetween    don't use liquid eyeliner on the bottom lid,  only top, always use pencil on the bottom,    If you have pale skin, go for browns around the eye,  black looks too harsh against pale skin,    Less is defiantly more,  and the natural look is much nicer,  so don't go for shocking bright colours around the eyes, and on the cheeks  go for browns or black on the eyes,  brown blush,  and a foundation that matches your skin tone,  nude/cleat lipgloss!!    xo|`|WLZFuBVBaa	neutral look  check it out on youtube... but dont put too much... light makeup is better than looking like a clown|`|GcWb7IRdaa	ok, first do you have any make-up yet?

OpduZC3Eaa	Why did you color the strips blond in the first place if you're just having to get rid of them anyway? Well who knows.. anyway.. all you have to do to get rid of the blond is get another box of the chocolate brown color and color the strips just like you would your whole head of hair. Only don't color your whole head of hair, just the strips!|`|c1d312af4250951e942d357ba46d734caa	No.  The hair will be dryer than the rest because of the bleach damage but it should be fine.  I will warn you though that the dye will fade faster from the bleached portion so you're going to have lighter strips there no matter what.  They'll just be much less noticeable if you dye them brown again.|`|LydL7EN6aa	no dye doesnt fry ur hair as bad as bleach, you should be fine|`|bfc067ab537555ada57edd464a8dfb97aa	wait 4-6 weeks before messing with your hair or you will fry it and then it will either come out in clumps or frizz beyond belief.|`|wq6lfHIBaa	Ya, thats what i had to do with my hair, its not good for your hair but better than just leaving it the way it is, i promise and it will grow out dont worry, I Did pretty much the same thing last summer and i felt like sh*t. But its just hair and you will get over it just like i did!  only thing you have to remember is that the parts with bleach will not absorb the color dye as well as you would think.  Good luck!!!|`|3ivRqDQ9aa	just wait a little while then dye the blonde back to chocolate brown. it'll damage your hair a bit more but then i'll get rid of the blonde/|`|jwftwLBTaa	you need to wiat at least 2 weeks or your hair will become totally ruined, break off, frizz.|`|b230efc62db3248986cd29d6f4fccc0aaa	Firstly do I need to dye them because they are copper?|`|a9qUuLhmaa	if u are going to redye the blonde strips yes, if you bleaching them. but any darker color is normally good for your hair, blonde is never good for you hair it drys ur hair out terribly,  sometimes i dye my hair dark brown for the moisture in the good conditioner that comes in the box. =]|`|BR2xeYGvaa	Depending on what colour your hair was before the initial brown dying, if you use the same dye on the blonde strips it may take a while to get them exactly the same colour, but I can't think of any reason why it would hurt.    The only thing I would recommend is that you wait 3-4 days before attempting it, unless you aren't worried about potentially damaging your hair.|`|FyrRDGqiaa	i'm sure it wouldn't be bad for your hair, just be aware that they may not be exactly the same color as the rest of your hair even after you dye it-- even if you use the same bottle, you've not done it in 2 weeks so the color has faded somewhat.  I think you'd be fine though, they may be a slight different but it would just look multi-faceted.  Go for it, you can always go to a professional if it doesn't turn out the way you want it.  Good luck!|`|4971857875f57116cbbe1c9b012b72c2aa	If you are going to re do just hat part of your hair, make sure you condition it very well before you dye. Because you are dying so much in a short time, the coloring agents can take a toll on your hair. You could possibly have two strips of fried and rough hair. I had a slight mishap while dying my hair once and had to dye my hair three times in less than a week to fix it. My friend's mother, who is a hair stylist, told me to get conditioner, get a good thick layer of it in your hair and leave it in my hair for about an hour or so. Be sure to cover it in a shower cap. Rinse. Wait a day, then re-dye.
BF4C5sbtaa	Curl your hair with a BIG curling iron. This way, the curls will be nice and big like that.|`|G2VS9o2raa	it will be hard to do it if u hav shoulder length hair  but if u still wana try it, u shud use a curling iron n try it out  good luck!|`|oOZyl5BNaa	it takes forever but you should start with unwashed hair (gross but it will stay in easier) then use a big curling iron.. curl. and then with the hairspray.. spray underneath your curls in the crown section of your head!|`|vLAGnmGEaa	Pantene control gel and hot rollers|`|58THMcy5aa	You just curl it with a curler. Dont start from the top start from half way.   You have short hair its gonna be quite easy.|`|4oWcXL5vaa	Sorry hun, if your hair isnt the right texture, no matter what you do it wont go certain ways....my hair is too thin, I could NEVER get it to look like that no matter what products I used.|`|4RMoYEmCaa	use a large curling iron|`|wgt9FSnXaa	use any gel and hair shiner then blow dry thats what i do   then i tease it with a comb which adds volume.|`|YHyoef76aa	Curl your hair then put hairspray on it so it doesn't fall out.|`|lUYeHIWpaa	I wear my hair like that from time to time mostly when I'm going to a party or so. The best way to make it so wavy is to use a GHD flatiron, Their latest model is really both a flatiron AND a curler. It is amazing how good it is and how fast it works, Yes GHD is quite expensive but well worth the money. I think they cost around 150 dollar.
44bVH1tOaa	I use Herbal Essences Dangerously Straight Shampoo and Conditioner. (about $3 each) It's a great shampoo because it takes away some of the frizzy, curly hair and starts making it straight. After I shower, I spray my hair with Got2Be Crazy Sleek. ($5) After you use this, blow dry your hair. Then after it's dry, flat iron it. I use a Conair straightener which I got for $25. Not sure if they make it anymore...    This takes about 40 minutes. And it will stay straight all day. And shiny :)    You also may consider layering your hair. It will help get rid of thickness.|`|rNjTHr36aa	invest in one of those "sleek and straight" shampoos. personally, i prefer paul mitchell. not too expensive, but its not cheap either. stay away from really cheap brands, they have a lot of alcohol or cover your hair in wax. these things are absolutely horrible for your hair.    also, invest in biosilk hair serum. this stuff IS THE BEST! its a little pricey (okay, so maybe its expensive) however, a tiny bit will go a long way. i've been using the same bottle for about 2 years now.    now, here's a real solution. many girls with frizzy/curly hair that i know of do this, but its really pricey. have you ever heard of a japanese straightening treatment? its much healthier than a perm. you can wash your hair and it will dry perfectly straight and smooth (it might need SOME touch ups, but not a big deal). the problem is that it costs about $300 to do and you're stuck in a salon for about 8 hours. on the plus side, you can go MONTHS with the perm and just touch up your roots as your hair grows.|`|BR2xeYGvaa	After you get out of the shower, apply a heat protectant spray to your hair and blow-dry it as straight as possible with a vent brush and blowdryer. If you have very kinky or frizzy hair, it might be worth it to invest in an ionic blowdryer and a flat iron infused with tourmaline - it helps tame the frizz a LOT.    After blowdrying it, hit it with the flat iron in small sections. Apply a moderate amount of pressure when you close it, not so much as to rip hair from your scalp, but enough to secure every last strand inside the iron. Pull down slowly and at the end of the strand, curl your wrist under a bit so that the ends of the hair flip under. Pencil-straight locks are never attractive.    Never underestimate the power of a light-hold hair spray to keep your hair straight after you leave the house. I use Aussie Mega.    As far as making it thinner, don't worry, mother nature will take care of that when you get older. :P For now, you could try a fun layered cut that will take away some of the bulk without also subtracting length.|`|Xk8mJPIvaa	i have the same problem. im 18 and have been straightening my hair for 3 years. my hair is very thick, bushy and wavy. i use the porcelain  series straightener. it was about $27 from sally's. i wash my hair and let in naturally dry overnight. when i wake up, it takes me about 20 minutes to do it. my hair is also very long, so it works wonders . hope this helped

Use a tinted moisturizer (will give you a dewy look), then apply a peach undertoned blush with light pink lip gloss. As to shadow, I would stay with browns, taupes, and golds. With olive skin tone I like to highlight the skin tone, not detract from it with heavy eye shadow

btMmriQvaa	Loreal hair color remover.|`|jJwuMTSqaa	Good luck. Black hair dye is the hardest. It doesn't remove easy at all. You would have to cut it, or go to a professional for them to "blend in the black." I doubt they would remove it either. I had this same issue once before.|`|LydL7EN6aa	go to sallys and get developer, mix 75% developer to 25% your shampoo, leave on for about 5 min, if your happy wiht the amount of dye it took out do it for longer!  good luck!|`|4971857875f57116cbbe1c9b012b72c2aa	Having a similar mishap while dying my hair (it turned 4 different colors) the only way you are going to be able to remove that is to get it  professionally done.|`|BxW2Lj7waa	Be thankful it's only streaks! I've done that and regretted it too. Getting rid of black is always going to be damaging. Bleaching it or getting it "stripped" at a salon are your best options... or you can wait for it to fade a bit gradually. It should since your hair is light underneath.|`|5kwKeWsbaa	I had this happen,  I tried an at home remedy and it just made it worse.  I ended up going to the salon and having the color stripped out of my hair and having it re-colored my natural color.  Good Luck.|`|EagOe74laa	Why remove it? I mean it's not like it is really permanent anyway.  Have fun with it instead. Maybe weave in beads and ribbons to the black streaks.   You can also clip cute little barrettes to the braided ends of the streaks for a cute look.  Twist shiny threads around the black streaks for a unique look.  Bad hair is all in your attitude. Even a shaved head looks good if the one wearing it feels good about it.

ZQhWSdLxaa	Wait until you lose weight, it could be your treat and motivation to lose the weight!|`|9e0b3eb053495521ed772cef2058be0faa	When you sit down, does your stomach fold in the middle? If it does, then you may not be able to heal a navel piercing. If it stays pretty stable, you should be fine. Go visit a piercer to find out for sure.     For the record: Weight really doesn't have much to do with it, it's your individual body. I've seen super skinny girls that would never have been able to heal a navel piercing.    If you want the piercing, and you're suited for it, go for it. Losing weight shouldn't affect it too much. Depending on what your exercise regimen is, you will want to avoid sit ups for a week or so, to allow the piercing to settle in a bit. Also avoid any contact sports for a few weeks, then be sure to protect your piercing if you do play.|`|igrdohopaa	Lose the weight first pierce later (=|`|rHKW1CJJaa	hooooooly crap. wait till you loose weight. im not trying to be mean but imagine what one would look like after loosing all that weight.... use it as motivation and you can treat yourself with it when you reach your goal|`|IMOKF6alaa	Loose weight first by loosing a significant amount of weight might cause it to migrate.

Sem qualquer rivalidade, ao contrário de suas persnagens. Confira a entrevista abaixo.<br>  <br>  Vocês duas s?o muito amigas. O que faz essa amizade ser t?o forte?<br>  Ashley: Eu digo que ela [Vanessa] é minha irm? gêmea. Ela sempre me ajuda. Algumas pessoas s?o realmente competitivas, mas a gente se apóia o tempo todo. Isso n?o é muito comum na noss área.<br>  <br>  Vanessa: Nós n?o somos competitivas, de jeito algum. Nós nos entendemos completamente. Ela é muito divertida e pé no ch?o.<br>  <br>  Vocês emprestam roupas uma para a outra?<br>  Vanessa: Claro! é ótimo. Ainda tem roupas minhas na casa dela. Tipo, eu digo que "preciso delas agora" e ela fica, tipo "eu n?o sei onde est?o."<br>  <br>  Ashley, de 22 anos, já disse que n?o gosta de beber e nem de ir à festas. Agora a gente descobriu como ela passa o tempo: com sua amiga Vanessa, de 19 anos.

t0KAgdqpaa	I think models are sickly and disgusting. But I've only realized this as I have recently outgrown the teenage years.<br>  When I was a teenager I had posters plastered in my journal, sometimes even cutting them thinner for "thinspiration". I'm still jealous.|`|G5FXpIKlaa	I'd love to be a model,  but i think they sometimes go a bit too far by becoming anerexic and taking drugs.<br>  I think that they also sometimes make teenagers like me feel bad about our selves because they thin tall and beautiful.<br>  I'd love to be tall but then some people would prefure to be short, but to me there are no short famous models so im not model material so it makes me feel ugly.<br>  I envy those sort of girls a lot.<br>  But i think there setting a bad example and thats why so many young girls are starving them selfes to look like them.|`|WA3zr3Yuaa	i think anorexia is a disease that often gets over looked because thats what society is used to seeing on the run way. its sad. <br>  i wouldn't see models as role models at all. there just people.. who walk up and down. with clothes on. i dont see why that makes them a role model. btw im 17 and a female. :D hope i was helpful|`|f8xth0Mgaa	90% of working models are not anorexic in any way. They are naturaly thin, they are on a healthy diet and work phisically a lot. No wonder they don't gain weight. On the other hand there are those people who would want to mimic model look. These are people unsatisfied with what they have. They are trying to be somebody else and start with their bodies. But, any changes should start from your heart, mind, emotions, your actions. They don't realise they will not become gorgeous just because they starv themselves. <br>  The models' body image is good for designers. The clothes look best on the tall and thin figure. <br>  I am not a guy, but I think no one will disagree with me on this one. A girl should look healthy. If she is born with light bone structure, skinny-tiny and quite tall, then great! As long as she looks healthy and feels great! <br>  <br>  I think the problem with anorexic teengers is not a problem of catwalk, it is a problem of shallow teenagers.

Getting both would not be too much if you want them both that would look good.|`|9496a414ef90ca23249dd9e31a9c8c34aa	a helix would look better on a guy=] especially in his 20's (and it would hurt less)!
