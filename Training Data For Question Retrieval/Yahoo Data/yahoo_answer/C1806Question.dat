20090202095251AArKyBM	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	What do i need to study to work as a game developer/designer?	I want to work for a demanding Game industry as a Game developer. As I'm still in my last year of high school I don't really know what do I need to study to achieve this.      I am looking through different colleges and there are so many different things that got me confused.       For instance,      There is:   1) Computer Games Technology   2) Bachelors in Computer Science   3) Bachelors in Game & Simulation Production    and whole other bunch of stuff with different names.      Now, my main problem is that my girlfriend lives in Fargo ND and I want to be by her but the universities there only have Bachelor in Computer Science.   I know Computer Science differs from the other 2 examples I gave but i would like to know if Its possible to do a Master Degree in Game Design or something after getting the Bachelor in Computer Science and finally be able to work as Game Designer/Developer for a demanding company?       Or do I have to follow a Bachelor which connects right away with the game design??      >< Please help me

20090202101233AAY2zga	Computers & Internet;Software	Excel Database Issue: How to use replace function based on a date?	I am having a problem with a large database in Excel (more than 16,000 rows).  This database contains information from a tagging project; fish are captured, tagged with a tag that has a unique code, and released.  If we capture that animal again, we can get data on growth, survival and movement.  The fish can also be captured dead by a commercial fisherman.  In that case, we get the info that we can and then dissect and re-use the tag in another fish.  (The tag code is the same.)        Here's an example:        Tag ABC       Tagged  6/12/07   Tag ABC       Recaptured 7/13/07   Tag ABC       Recovered Dead 8/21/07   Tag ABC       Tagged 9/21/07   Tag ABC       Recaptured 10/12/07      The tagging on 9/21/07 represents a new fish, and the recapture on 10/12/07 is clearly also the new fish.  What I'm trying to do is figure out how to write a function that will add a suffix to the end of the Tag Code past a certain date.  So for the example above, I'd want a function that would put a "tr" onto the end of the code for each code past 8/21/07 (the date that the first fish was found dead).      I'm not sure how to do this--I've played around with both the replace and substitute function in Excel, but can't quite get it to do what I want.  I should also note that the dates are not constant; there were many different dates that fish were recovered dead, so the capture and tag dates are unique to each fish.        I would be very grateful for any advice--thanks very much.

I have been using SMAC (a mac address spoofer) for a while now with no problems. But last night I changed my LAN mac and my wireless mac. I then changed them back, but my LAN mac wouldn't change back to my original LAN.      Now I can get an internet connection through LAN, but not wirelessly. When I turn on my wireless card, my internet goes dead.      I know next to nothing about all of this.. The only thing i've noticed is that my ipconfig used to say "hybrid" somewhere at the top, and now it says "unknown".      I've even tried formatting and reinstalling my HD with no success.      Is there some way i can "reboot" my network cards back to factory settings? bc this pc is only a few months old and it used to work flawlessly.

Questo, purtroppo, non ha il masterizzatore ma solo il lettore DVD. Chiedo un suggerimento. Mi conviene comprare un masterizzatore esterno o cambiare il lettore direttamente?       Mi potreste dare qualche consiglio, eventualmente, anche su quale masterizzatore - economico e di piccolo ingombro - da poter prendere? costo?       Se invece prendo un lettore che faccia da masterizzatore DVD/CD devo necessariamente prenderne uno della ACER o ce ne sono anche di compatibili buoni?       Grazie anticipatamente,         Ciao

I have checked the Ruler but ruler is showing for the top portion.  I can't see the Rules for right and left.    2.

This has vanished from the bottom.    3.

Ho provato a collegare tutte le varie parti (cavo d'alimentazione, cavo USB, cavo dati e alimentazione al masterizzatore) ma vedo che non arriva l'alimentazione all'unità. Non s'accende niente (il box funziona perché s'accende la ventola) e non capisco da cosa possa dipendere.      Sto pensando di farmelo cambiare perché mi pare troppo strano. Per quanto il PC possa non riconoscerlo, la corrente dovrebbe arrivargli  e... invece niente.      E' la prima volta che provo a collegare un box esterno al computer (via usb). Forse sbaglio qualcosa?       Grazie e ciao
20060930093832AA7KgdS	Computers & Internet;Other - Computers	Problemi avvio PC - help?	Ciao a tutti,       qualcuno di voi forse ricorderà che ho avuto un po' di problemi con l'hard disk del PC e, dopo vari tentativi, avevo trovato il problema nei collegamenti IDE 1, IDE 2 etc. Il computer dunque è ripartito regolarmente. Ho reinstallato tutto (S.o. etc.), ci ho navigato per un po', fatto copie, insomma l'ho usato in ogni sua parte e, oggi, mentre s'aggiornava con windows update mi sono scaricato zone alarm. M'ha chiesto di riavviare  e ... l'ho fatto. Da allora il computer non mi rileva nuovamente l'hard-disk. Strano perché dalla Bios lo vede (un maxtor). Strano poi che tra le opzioni di boot, l'HD neanche compare...    Misteri dei misteri, poi, all'avvio m'appare un messaggio d'errore che blocca tutto dicendo che il primary slave non è compatibile ... insomma qualcosa di strano perché l'HD, su ide 1 è impostato su master (slave è il DVD) mentre su ide2 c'è il masterizzatore come master. Grazie dei vs. suggerimenti.

Ho il mio PC di casa che lo do' via. Vorrei tenermi però il masterizzatore da utilizzare come unità esterna da collegare al portatile. Ho sia il masterizzatore CD sia il masterizzatore DVD. Uno vorrei lasciarlo nel PC ed uno lo tengo, per l'appunto, per me. Quale secondo voi? se mi tengo il masterizzatore DVD, se voglio fare copie cd audio come faccio? posso poi sentire il DVD copiato in un normale lettore CD (HIFI)?      Ho seri dubbi in proposito.         Grazie e ciao
20061003052941AANo0mA	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Other - Hardware	Il PC non trova l'hard disk. Qualche suggerimento?	Ciao,       spero tanto potrete darmi qualche suggerimento. Ho un computer con Windows XP che non mi trova più l'hard disk. La cosa strana, se vado al menu della bios, è che lo vede tra le "ide devices" e lo riconosce come Maxtor - primary slave.       Lo strano è però che non lo ripropone come unità di boot ... Morale? il sistema non parte e mi chiede un disco di boot.       Considerate che fino a qualche giorno fa ho utilizzato il computer e l'hard - disk lo riconosceva eccome. Non ho fatto alcuna modifica da allora. Ho provato anche a staccare tutte le varie unità in più (lettore CD, masterizzatore DVD, su IDE 2) per vedere bene se così parte .. ma niente.       Da che potrebbe dipendere secondo voi? forse l'hard-disk che è da cambiare?       Grazie e ciao,       Daniele

Ciao a tutti,      a voi è mai capitato? avevo la mia pennetta USB da 1 GB bella zeppa di programmi ... e tra il cambiarla dal PC al portatile(per trasferirvi i dati) mi trovo che non c'è più niente di niente. Nessun file musicale, nessun programma. Pensavo forse un virus? ma com'è possibile... poi ripensandoci devo aver staccato la pennetta senza fare la procedura a livello software. Ora il danno è fatto. Provo ad entrarci e il PC mi comunica che non è un'unità formattata. Provo a formattare ma ... niente... non lo fa.

Per provarlo appieno ho avuto la (malsana) idea di installare come secondo sistema operativo dando OK alla partizione. Dunque ora ho Windows XP da un lato e dall'altro Kubunto. Come levo Kubuntu, ora, senza dover formattare tutto? volevo provarlo un po' ... e già vedo le prime difficoltà. Ad esempio per la configurazione ALICE ADSL. Non ho trovato da nessuna parte un menu di configurazione (PPOE mi pare si chiami) e ... voi sapete come si fa? Ho provato la versione light (DSL) e questo ce l'aveva e pure facilissimo. Qui invece niente? Chi di voi può darmi qualche dritta? anche per, come scrivevo qui sopra, toglierlo di mezzo? Windows, ora infatti, è molto rallentato. Sob.       Grazie ciao.
20061010045151AAPPuyo	Computers & Internet;Software	Ubuntu vs. kubunto ---- quale è migliore secondo voi?	Ciao,      ieri ho installato Ubuntu (ho ricevuto i due cd, uno Kubuntu e l'altro Ubunto). L'ho messo come unico sistema operativo (ho tolto windows) e spero di non pentirmene.      Gettando un occhio anche a Kubunto ho visto che a livello grafico sembra per certi versi migliore e più intuitivo. Mi sono piaciuti gli screensavers, i temi, le varie icone ... però ho visto che Ubuntu sembra essere più completo... insomma una bella lotta tra i due s.o. Voi quale usate? li conoscete? con quale vi trovate meglio e perché?      Una domanda rapida rapida: c'è un emulatore windows (Microsoft) che permetta di installare i programmi che Linux non può fare (ad esempio i file .exe...non sa cosa siano credo).      Grazie e ciao

20061005100832AAQNbII	Computers & Internet;Other - Computers	Was ist bzw. bringt ein Quantencomputer?	Ich habe dazu folgendes gelesen:   normale Computer arbeiten mit Bits, die entweder den Zustand 0 oder 1 einnehmen k?nnen.   Quantencomputer arbeiten mit "Qubits", die zugleich den Zustand 0 und 1 einnehmen k?nnen.      Eine hundertstellige Zahl in ihre Primfaktoren (Primzahlen, die man miteiander multiplizieren muss, um diese Zahl zu erhalten) zu zerlegen, dauert bei einem gew?hnlichen Computer l?nger als das Universum existiert, also Milliarden Jahre. Für den Quantencomputer dagegen keine gro?e Sache.      Theoretisch ok aber die Frage ist: wie mu? man sich sowas in der Praxis vorstellen? Was werden Quantencomputer mit einer Million, einer Milliarde, 1000 Milliarden oder einer Million Milliarden Qubits k?nnen?      Kann mir das jemand anhand von konkreten Beispielen erkl?ren?

20061011045744AAWIZdh	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Other - Hardware	DVD Rewriter Problem?	I was using DVD Decrypter to burn an ISO and realised that I had picked the wrong one. I used the abort function and Decrypter continued to run for a while after acknowldging the abort. I then had a quick powercut causing the computer to reboot.      Now the DVD drive won't read any DVDs and is scratching any I put in while making a clicking noise (technical I know!). It appears it is trying to finish off whatever Decrypter was doing when I'd asked it to abort.      I can get CDs to work but only after the drive has clicked a few times and scratched the disks. If I close the disk tray without a disk in it it still makes the clicking noise for a minute as if it is looking for a disk to maul.      How do I stop the drive thinking it has something to finish off (I have rebooted a couple of times)??

20061221215409AAuYku7	Computers & Internet;Internet	Firefox and Thunderbird can no longer connect?	I have been using Firefox and Thunderbird for probably over a year now, and I've installed them on various machines and so on. I am a Web Developer and Computer Administrator so I know my stuff pretty well, but I'm completely stumped.      Today I was surfing on the web and suddenly my Firefox told me I couldn't connect anymore. I found that weird, tried restarting it, checking it on another account on the same system, tried Thunderbird, none could connect. I tried getting to my local IP address (I'm behind a router), it couldn't even find that, and it couldn't find my router either.       I removed my router, couldn't do anything either. I've turned off my computer and started it again, didn't work. I took an old copy of Firefox and installed it again (I didn't uninstall the other one, hoping it was ask me to repair), didn't work.      here's my specs:   Win XP SP2   Firefox 1.5   Thunderbird 1.5      I would prefer not to upgrade, as a web developer I need to have the most common browsers.

I love my notebook so much but the only thing I don't like it is the screen is too small. So I really want to hook it up with my 19' monitor.       I've checked my monitor and it has two cores (one is for power and another is for data transfer). So can I just go ahead to plug in the power wire and also plug in the other one to the notebook. Will that work? Thank you~

I'm just buying a PC for regular usage, and it seems all the people around me said that Dell is the best. What do you think? What are some of the reasons for choosing Dell?
