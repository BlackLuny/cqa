RVpl9ZeIaa	1. No, they cannot be used in a duel.      2. These are their TRUE effects.    Obelisk the Tormentor  Divine  Level 10  Divine-Beast / Effect  ATK/4000 DEF/4000  Effect: You must tribute 3 monsters to tribute summon this card. If this card is special summoned, it is sent to the graveyard during the end phase. While this card is face-up on the field, it cannot be targeted by spell, trap and effect monster effects that designate a target. You can tribute 2 monsters on your field to destroy all monsters your opponent controls.      Slifer the Sky Dragon  Divine  Level 10  Divine-Beast / Effect  ATK/X000 DEF/X000  Effect: You must tribute 3 monsters to tribute summon this card. If this card is special summoned, it is sent to the graveyard during the end phase. While this card is face-up on the field, it cannot be targeted by spell, trap and effect monster effects that designate a target. When your opponent summons a monster(s) with 2000 or less DEF, destroy the monster(s).      The Winged Dragon of Ra  Divine  Level 10  Divine-Beast / Effect  ATK/???? DEF/????  Effect: You must tribute 3 monsters to tribute summon this card. If this card is special summoned, it is sent to the graveyard during the end phase. While this card is face-up on the field, it cannot be targeted by spell, trap and effect monster effects that designate a target. The ATK and DEF of this card becomes the total of the respective ATK and DEF values of the tributed monsters. When this card is successfully special summoned, you can activate 1 of the following effects:  - Pay 1000 life points to destroy 1 monster on the field and remove it from play  - Pay any number of life points, this card gains ATK and DEF equal to the amount of life points paid.        3. If you can find them anywhere for $20 or less, go ahead and buy them. Otherwise, they aren't worth the expense.      Email me if you have any questions.|`|ol2h2izuaa	You can't use them is tournaments and the reason why is because they don't show their effects but if you ask the person you are dueling for fun before hand then it is up to that person if you can use then or not. Second question their effects,     The Winged Dragon of Ra  Stars: 10  Attack/Defense: ????/????  Effect: The attack and defense power for this card is equal to the total of the three monster cards you use to summon it. For example, if you tribute three of the powerful Summoned Skull monsters, The Winged Dragon of Ra will have a humongous 7500 attack power and 3600 defense power! You can also give up your live points to add to his attack, so if you have 8000 life and you give all but one of your life points it will get an extra 7999 attack points.    Obelisk The Tormentor  Stars: 10  Attack/Defense: 4000/4000  Effect: You can only summon Obelisk the Tormenter by tributing three monsters on the field. When you summon this monster card you may sacrifice two additional monsters to destroy all of your opponent's monster cards on the field and automatically deal him or her 4000 points of direct damage. Note: this effect is activated when you summon this monster and does not count as part of your battle phase. Battle phase may still be entered.    Slifer the Sky Dragon  Stars: 10  Attack/Defense: X000/X000  Effect: This monster card has 1000 attack and 1000 defense for every card in your hand. So, if you have five cards in your hand, Slifer has 5000 attack and 5000 defense!     Also they are said to be uneffect by spells, traps, and monster effects that would harm then but power cards do work on them like axe of despare but on the tv show there are so card that do work against them. Also if you bring them back from the grave to the field like moster reborn and permercure bureal they only stay on the field for one turn. Also card destion will send them to the graveyard.    I would buy them  personally just so I can say I have them but maybe in a couple years or so, they maybe worth more money. Also I went on ebay and found all 3 selling for $600. So if you want them just to collect them then you sould buy them but you can't use them for dueling so it is up to you if you waant to buy them. Also I have two of the egyption gods. Ra and Slifer.

AA10726404	I just took a withdrawal from Full Tilt for the first time in a long time.  Previously I had been using Neteller and some online debit card thing.    Those methods are now defunct, so I took a check the last time.    You have to scan a copy of a utility bill and your driver's license.  I blacked out some of the information I didn't want them to have, despite the fact that I trust their company.    It takes a couple of days for them to review your proof of ID.  But once they do that, you won't have to do that again.    Although they claim that the check can take up to 15 business days, they appear to have some office in California, and I got my check within 2 days.    So the check system sounds like hassle, but really it is pretty quick.    All that said, you have built a small bank roll.  I don't see the point in just cashing all your money out.  You would be losing your deposit bonus, and you'd have to go through the hassle of starting all over again if you want to play again.  But to each their own.|`|pDUV3xDpaa	Congrats on the 4:1 rate of return!!     To be completely honest with you, unfortunately its NOT really as easy as they make it out to be....    The answer to your question is virtually none-besides a check.    Here is what you have to do:    1.) Send a copy of your drivers licenses AND a tax document with your address to Cashier@fulltilt.com    (i luckily have an all-in one printer and was lucky enough to be able to scan these documents into my computer and attach in an email)    2.) they will send you an email back confirming your information.    3.) you request an amount anywhere from $100 to $1000(or something)    4.) then you wait like 15 days for your check.      ...i think they make it really difficult for a few reasons.    Anyway, hopes this helps and congrats again-TAKE YOUR MONEY AND RUN!!! before you get really unlucky and lose it all-its happen to me quite a few times, so be careful!|`|LItIiiHKaa	If you're from the U.S. then checks are the way to go.  There's no real fast way to get your money in this case but you will get it.      If you can get a quality digital photo of the stuff this might work.  One way to find out I guess.  If this doesn't work then go to a shop and get the stuff scanned.    King Cobra Poker  http://kingcobrapoker.com|`|mJI99Nyjaa	There is none at full tilt.

mFccGhUHaa	Just like the other drum sets before it, the Ion Drum Rocker does not (from factory settings) support double bass pedals.  When you plug two pedals into a splitter, it doesn't work as fully as you would expect.  Basically, when one pedal is depressed, the other one cannot be used - so there's no point.  However, third parties (i.e. Roadie) have made an adapter that overrides that flaw.  It goes for about $20.
AA11545988	OH, i know what you're talking about now.  when you first get to saffron city, there are Rockets all over, blocking certain doors.  one of these doors is the gym door.  the fighting dojo is open though.    in order to cleanse the town of all the team rocket members, you need to defeat giovanni, who is in the huge building in the center of town.    this is one of the biggest dungeons in the game, but there are many great things to be had from it.  for example, a lapras, and a masterball    after you clear the big building of team rocket, the rocket grunt outside the city's psychic gym will have ran away, and you can now get your next gym badge|`|55e8cf5a1820e1b00e3657eb772f79e3aa	try www.onsaletag.com for the strategy guide|`|3ddc44f33666596f425bb63d790fb7adaa	is that the guard who says i'm thirsty? if he is that go to the top of the mall ,there will be a soda machine take a bottle of water go and give it to the guard he will let you go.|`|86a1e9a55e98a4b5d6ac808b5c22e809aa	you have to beat giovanni in the silph building.     ===how to do so(without fighting too many guys)===  take elevator to flor 5.  walk down. you see a guy next to a pad. wlak on teh pad.   take 1 step left of pad. go back on pad  walk down.  fight guy.  walk right  get key card.  take elevator to floor 3  walk down between 2 rooms.   fight guy  walk in room to left.  avoid him  take telepad  walk left  right rival  talk to other guy (gives you lapras)  take bottom pad.  walk down  fight guard  open final door  walk in  fight gio  escape rope out.  ===end===    however in order to remove guard forem silph building i beleive you have to beat koga (in fushia city) i could be mistaken on that though.|`|02d58e04c93deec4221e3fd92c406a82aa	Defeat Giovanni at Silph Co.

AA12118796	I checked many of the most common and best cheat sites. And I found nothing. Some sites had the game on them but no cheats for it. I even looked at gameshark codes still none found.      I would imagine that codes may appear in the future if the game is very new. Good luck keep an eye open.     Cheatcc  Gamefaqs  Gamewinners  Gameshark.com     are the sites I checked nothing yet but if and or when this game gets codes at least one of these 4 sites will post them.      To "Boba Fett" I have never found a virus on any game site yet including ones that let you download files like bots and trainers.    I have been to over 30 game sites and downloads tons of files. Fully updated Norton is my anti virus.    ---edited---  I hate gamespot so hard to navigate does not seem like there is a Ps2 cheat section for this game. Anyhow the cheats are only goal cheats nothing great. Good luck.  After checking gamespot I found this for Justcause. The info is for the xbox360 but they were only achievement goals and should be the same across systems.

You need not go online to find a cheat afterwards..|`|55e8cf5a1820e1b00e3657eb772f79e3aa	try www.onsaletag.com for the game strategy guide book.|`|AA12025606	Well, for the time being, there are not yet any cheats posted on the major game sites like gamespot.com and stuff. I think it's just 'coz this game is kinda new. Though it's not a complete GTA game clone, but it's pretty similar. So there is no reason that the game doesn't have any cheat codes. I'm still waiting for some shortcuts of obtaining certain vehicles easily, and I found one. Here it is. If you want a chopper and you have already got the PROTEL GRAPPLER G3 in your weapon selector, you need to press BACK in the game and select EXTRACTION to call a helicopter to pick you up (by selecting a location). Then the helicopter puts you down and right before it leaves, use the PROTEL GRAPPLER G3 to grab it. It will take some skill, coz you might be killed by (I'm not really sure) the blades of the chopper. However, it's worth a try. Coz the chopper has weapon and it's good for sightseeing. Good luck and have fun!

fdOsfi9Raa	Yes indeed it does. My advice is to play them regulary and try to make the score if they are an attacking player and a clean sheet if they are a defender. Hope this help :)|`|ILYEAa9laa	yes it does, try and keep the player in your starting line up to gain the experince points. also when a player reaches late 20's their value also rises. shame the transfer prices on 09 are not anywhere near the real valuations ! hope this helps.|`|v2ut95Wzaa	yes, every overall that a player goes up by his value goes up too...|`|I2ki4Udeaa	It does raise the Transfer Value, as I have tried it before whilst playing Manager  Mode. :D|`|gnUX1aB1aa	Yes. The higher your player's overall rating goes up the more his transfer rises. So not only does your player become better at the game he is also worth a lot more too.
AA10726404	It's pretty simple.  People can misread a scratch off ticket, or forget to check their numbers.  Maybe they check the wrong numbers.  Maybe the ticket gets left in a pocket and goes through the washing machine.    People are generally not really expecting to win.  It is after all pretty unlikely.  So they've only paid a few bucks for the ticket, and so it seems to only have that value.  If they realized their ticket was worth $1,000,000 or more, I'm guessing they would be more careful with it.|`|wMunBQ9Oaa	Probably cause they have lost the damn ticket!

When you win a lot of money, people start popping up in your family who you never knew.     But I don't think that's the reason. I think they either lost the ticket or never heard the winning announcement.   Where not doing so hot in the economy right now, so where trying to get all the money we can with out losing jobs. All my friends where the first got laid off because they where teens. Then fired older people so I don't know why they wouldn't collect it. Unless! Sometimes 15-18 year olds buy them.

No caso da mulher n?o  a sua primeira necessidade, mas  uma das mais importantes para que ela sinta que  a prioridade na vida de seu amado.  Tempo de qualidade n?o  apenas assistir um filme juntos, por exemplo, mas fazer algo em que a aten??o do homem seja exclusivamente voltada para sua amada.  Para resolver o problema (visto que para muitos homens  simplesmente impossvel largar o futebol de domingo)  necessrio separar algum outro momento para dedica??o exclusiva  mulher amada.

d8a2194742f0e8f806fc4bc41e7bf9f1aa	Depends on your talents spreading...  for example- a troll shaman is good for restoration and possibly elemental, but not so much enhancement, Night Elf rgoues are good even though i hate them, and Troll hunters are awesome. Tauren warriors are amazing too.

You can have multiple charecters on the same accont.|`|AA10423931	hahah yeah XD    i know that the Troll Shaman are hated the most cuz they are so easy to control. The shaman can attack alot of palyers with their lighting thing attack, and all their totems, and their healing and polymorphing ability.    I know that Paladins and Warlocks dont have to pay for their first mounts since they are epics and get 75/75 riding skill automatically. All other classes have to pay 100g i think to get their first mount, and riding skills at lvl 40.    But also now locks are getting much better due to the new patches and armors from Tier 4 and so on.    but you might also want to see whose side you want to be on, Alliance or horde, and when the new expansion comes out in 5 days, there will be 2 new classes to choose from.from what i hear, people of ages 19 to 35 usually go with the horde, and ages 14..or whatever age they start to 19 are on the allinace, the horde are more mature and do better in AB and WSG battlegrounds.    but it all really depends on what you want to do.|`|44c348a5399258098f252dd9fc81f45baa	I think it's wrong to assume that the immature players are all on alliance, in my experience there are equal amounts on both sides. I prefer the alliance and have been playing mostly on that side since the game came out. My favorite character is simply a human paladin, but really it is all in your preference. Have fun!

Zombie killing, while fun, does get a little old after a while. Plus there's more people to find on CoD4; better maps, and more people actually talk.     Overall, World at War was a good game. And if World War II settings hadn't already been beaten to death, more people would be enjoying it a lot more. But sadly, World War II has been used in too many video games and I think it's starting to lose its value in video games.     Call of Duty 4, on the other hand, was set in the present day, on a fictional war, where they were free to make up their own story without being limited by historical facts. To me, that made the game much more enjoyable.|`|voJ9vF3Paa	COD4|`|qJu4boDmaa	I have both for my DS. It is hard to decide. They are both fun.

vtJDHJDYaa	On the way to The World That Never Was, Sora, Donald, Goofy, and King Mickey are trapped in Betwixt and Between by Nobodies, but Axel arrives to help. Sora and Axel battle the Nobodies, but seeing no other choice, Axel decides to put every bit of his energy into one massive attack to destroy the Nobodies and save Sora, who stays with him until the moment he dies. His body smoldering and beginning to fade, Axel opens the passageway to The World That Never Was. As he dies, he sincerely apologizes to Sora for getting Kairi involved. Sora asks him what he was trying to do, and Axel expresses that he wanted to see Roxas, who made him feel like he had a heart, and that Sora makes him feel the same way, and uses his final words to urge Sora on to rescue Kairi, fading into darkness afterwards. After that, Xigbar and Luxord were curious about Axel doing something as foolish as that, but Xemnas revealed that Axel's death served to stir Roxas from his rest. Xemnas also stated that due to contact with Sora, Axel could be reborn full with a heart. Whether or not this is true remains unclear.|`|CzuxUNqzaa	i forgot 2 srry c=(^^Q)

WYCaSnslaa	Sounds like you may be missing a step....  here's the details on how to do it:    First off, to pair up the headset to your PS3 --     *Plug the headset directly into the USB cable to the PS3. DO NOT connect into the cradle because that won't work.   *Connect the other end of the USB cable into the PS3.  *Press the power button.  *If the pairing was successful, the headset will display a green light for 2 seconds. If it was not successful, the headset will display a red light.      Once that's done, then go into your Accessory settings an change the Audio input & output to the BT headset.

AA11681100	Depends. What system you playing on? PC, 360, or PS3?   If it's the 360 or the PS3, and you're using a wireless connection, that's probably at fault. Wireless connections lose quite a bit of speed, and GTA IV, being the high-res, high-speed game that it is, requires a very fast connection. I have it on all 3 platforms, and regardless of which one I play it on, it always lags. That's the only thing I don't like about playing it online. You can head straight for someone in your car, and it will look like you hit them. (They'll fly over your roof) But then you find out that you missed them, cuz they appear right next to your car and end up killing you.    Anyway, my point is that GTA IV is laggy online and requires a very good connection speed. Your connection is probably at fault. And if you're using wireless internet, you might want to check your settings and make sure you have it set up right. Otherwise your connection will be even slower, and you will have trouble playing some games online.

kW0E2vBSaa	Ha ha I remember when i was 11... of course that was 3 years ago.'    'ahem' I really dunno much about money, other than spending it.  Lemonade stands are pimpin' awesome but are so old school.  1) BEG your parents for money...doesn't work? Next...  2) Ask money loaned (cuz SOMEDAY you'll pay it...)  3) WORK for it in places where you can... like doin' chores or stuff    Well that's all..

QT6iRQNaaa	One of the most unique standard Pokemon is Eevee, one little pokemon that evolves into 7 completely different forms. The different forms see different degrees of usage throughout the meta-game, some listed in one tier while the others rest in a different one. While Eevee is my favorite for its form, elegance and versatility, it comes at the cost of some of the more intricate evolutions in the game. Eevee evolves through three different means: Stone based, Happiness in relation to time of day and Location. Not everyone understands how to evolve Eevee into its various forms because of this.|`|m8ikUOHFaa	Yes you can, but the rate of getting the female charmander is 12.5% so you will have to restart, and get the charmander from oak until he gives you a female one.

cLW7vFUGaa	Nope, it's only one season more!    The timeline is:  Marriage  Pregnancy after two seasons  Baby born after one season  Child fully-grown after one year (going through stages each month in between when it learns to walk, talk, etc.)    A week after the pregnancy announcement, you'll get to pray to the Goddess for either a boy or a girl, so start deciding what you want now!    Congratulations!
cLW7vFUGaa	Yep, they will! I actually started getting the rival couples married almost directly after I was wedded myself. It was cool, like I started a trend. xD    All you have to do is see both of the couple's "rival heart events." You get these by being in the right place at the right time after you've gotten their heart levels up to the right amount. You have to befriend the member of the rival couple with the same gender as you up to two and then three hearts, to see the first and second scenes, respectively.    For example, if you're a girl and want to see Julius and Candace's wedding, befriend Candace to two hearts and be in Waffle Town on a clear morning to see the scene. Then continue befriending Candace up to three hearts, and go to Waffle Town again to see the second scene. You'll receive an invitation in the mail a few days later that will tell you the date of the wedding. I believe you'll be automatically transported to the ceremony in the morning that day, just like how your own wedding happened.    The extensive FAQ/walkthrough in the sources has a good list of heart event requirements and locations. The only thing is, the guide seems to say that if you're playing as a girl you need the GUY'S hearts up. That doesn't really make sense, since if you're raising a guy's hearts it probably means you like him and DON'T want to marry him off to a rival... So far I've gotten Jin/Anissa and Chase/Maya, and I'm pretty sure I got them both by befriending the GIRL. So yeah, good luck!|`|kDdjf4qRaa	yes but only some guys get married
iT0xlDOaaa	That doesn't make sense. If you have 81 mobsters and you are a level 20, you will use 20 (level) x 10 = 200 or 81 whichever number is lower.    So since your level isn't limiting you,  you could use 81 Weapons, 81 Armor and 81 Vehicles in a single fight. Inside of each of those groups you could mix and match (20 .50 Cal + 20 Sawed Off Shotgun + 41 Sub Machine Guns) for the total number in that group.    Try increasing your mob - there are a bunch of friend codes posted on http://www.mobcodes.com and you can also add your own code to be picked up by a bunch of other mobs.
9h95rnHPaa	To make huge mansions, you use different tools in the game which let you create walls, flooring, and more. When you are done creating a room, you click on the house icon that has an arrow on it. Then you put rug on the white squares that appears to be on top of the bottom floor. Then keep repeating. You can design a house and lot in many unique ways!
FPsMtmThaa	First off, I wouldn't hit the top of the 360, ESPECIALLY when it is spinning. (even if it does work)  If it gets loose, it could shatter inside your 360 and destroy important parts inside. Then you might need to spend another $300+ for a new 360 instead of paying $100 to repair it.    I don't know if this will work but change your settings to go straight to the dashboard when you turn on the 360, instead of immediately starting the game. Then try to play the game from the dashboard.    From the error you are mentioning, I think it might be the same issue I first had on my 360.  The optical drive (the infrared thing that reads your disc) may be faulty.  If that's the case, you'll have no choice but to send it in.  Call 8004MYXBOX, get a reference number, and ship that bad boy in and get it over with.  You'll be happy you got it fixed and done with.  You'll be out a 360 for 2 weeks tops.    Other than that, look to see if there is a "PlayNTrade" around your area.  It's kind of like Gamestop but WAY better. They also offer repair service and if you're going to pay $100 anyway to MS to get it fixed, might as well see if they can repair it for you for less money.  You may get it back faster too.    Hope I Helped!    Cheers.|`|CosVAp0Jaa	sorry dude, but youll have to send it to microsoft, if you have warranty, its free. but if u want to try to do it your self (which i highly dont reccoment) you can buy a disc player from ebay for about $30.  i had the same problem because my mom chuck my 360 on the marble floor... i sent it back and since i had warranty i didnt even pay a cent!!!  good luck dude...     if you have live add me...

SzepLJubaa	Paladins don't get pets.  If you want a pet that will permanently stay with you and help you fight, make a Hunter or a Warlock.    Death Knights can also have a ghoul minion that helps attack, but from your question I am asuming that you just started WoW. You need a level 55+ character to create a Death Knight and WotLK (Wrath of the Lich King Expansion).|`|AA10732635	Sorry, you have to be a Hunter, Warlock, or Deathknight.

Vu3J4e0saa	Hi I live in Spain and would suggest you spray paint it.  Rub the trash can over lightly with sandpaper first to give the paint something to cling to.  Spray paint in a well ventilated area and wear a mask.  If you have a Chinese bazaar type shop near you the paint can be bought very cheaply.  I have recently spray painted a plastic stool which has got quite a bit of use since I did it and it is still ok.|`|dEDio8aPaa	Trashcans are usually made of vinyl and paint does not stick well to vinyl. You'll need to prime it first with a good primer like Zinsser or Kilz. Then you can use whatever paint you want. Just be careful not to bend the can or anything that may make the paint peel off. Have fun!|`|vUxwzQWOaa	There is a product on the market that is formulated just for plastic. It is called Fusion paint. I havn't tryed it yet, but people have recommended it to me. I will soon be trying it myself.
w4qS66aqaa	Against Cynthia, it's good to have a few pokemon (such as Staraptor and Empoleon) that are offensively-skilled and can deal large amounts of damage, but you should also have two or more pokemon that can take lots of damage, acting as a wall while you heal your damage-dealers mid-battle with items like Full Restores, Max Potions, etc (stock up on these).    Most of Cynthia's pokemon attack with either special or physical attacks only (with the only notable exception being Lucario), so get a pokemon with high physical defence (such as Steelix) to wall physical blows and a pokemon with high Special defense (such as Blissey) to wall those special attacks.    Put crippling moves such as thunder-wave and Toxic on your walls to hinder the opponents further, making sure that they are at a disadvantage when your damage-dealers come back from the dead.    Using this technique, I defeated Cynthia and the entire Elite Four with pokemon in the low 50s. I used Blissey, Steelix and Torterra to Wall, Palkia and Roserade for special attack and Steelix, Torterra and Weavile for physical attack.(so some pokemon can fill a dual-role).    For your pokemon use Dialga as a physical wall and special attacker, Staraptor as a physical attacker and Emploeon as a special attacker. As for your others, if you think the ones that you have are bad try Weavile for physical attack, Steelix for walling and attack and Blissey for special walling, instead of your other three. (I think that those three would fit best into your team, and I highly reccommend that you use them.)    Weavile evolves from Sneasel when it levels up with a Razor Claw attached. Sneasel can be found in any snowy area (outside Snowpoint City, for example), Roserade evolves from Roselia (which can be caught in the great marsh) using a Shiny Stone, and Blissey evolves from Chansey through "happiness evolution". (You walk around with the pokemon and level it up a lot, it likes you, then it evolves). Chansey can be caught on the route between Hearthome and Solaceon.    Weavile is what's known as a "glass cannon". It can deal ridiculous amounts of damage very quickly, but may find itself struggling to take any hits which are thrown at it. The idea is to use Weavile first in the party in order to quickly wipe out as much of the enemy's health as possible, reviving it whilst walling if it faints.    Steelix can take a lot of physical hits, but its speical defence is...not exactly bad, but lacking. Its many resistances due to its typing can make up for this, however.    Be aware that while Blissey is a brilliant special wall (vs. special attackers like Milotic) its physical defence is virtually non-existant. Don't use it against, say, Cynthia's Garchomp or Lucario.    Remember to heal your pokemon fully between battles, and above all, don't be afraid to keep hammering away at the 4. Spend all of your money on healing stuff before going in so that you don't suffer from lost cash if you lose. You only lose a small portion of your money, and the 4 give out tons of cash, so on balance you'll actually be making money by hitting them over and over. Eventually, you'll get lucky (as I did) and destroy them.|`|fr180hSmaa	I am going to keep it simple because well it is simple  Spiritomb: no weaknesses but hit with one of your starter Pokemon's strongest attacks (hydro pump leaf storm) to kill this thing  Garchomp- all you need is a ice attack one ice beam and this thing is dead but he is fast and power full so get a pokemon with a lot of hp  Gastrodon: get a grass attack one or two hits and it kills him  Milotic: do not think milotic gastrondon two water types easy they are vastly ddifferent pokemon although you can use grass attacks to kill I suggest electric pokemon because of its ice beam and electric tends to be faster than it  Lucario:  I am sure you have a fire or ground attack hit with that and he is dead  Roserade: so many weaknesses fire ice physic flying chose one and kill it|`|95009345a8832135fef8002fec62e6c1aa	Champion Cynthia's team:  Spiritomb (LV. 61)  Garchomp (LV. 66)  Gastrodon (LV. 60)  Milotic (LV. 63)  Lucario (LV. 63)  Roserade (LV. 60)    My Team: (Level 58 all the first time I beat them) - carry lots of max potions and max revives  Staraptor (Ariel Ace, Fly) to beat Spiritomb & Roserade  Empoleon (Hydro Cannon, Surf & Waterfall) to beat Garchomp  Roserade (Giga Drain) to beat Milotic and Gastrodon but if Milotic gets you with Mirror Coat and it hits your Roserade is done - then use Staraptor  Golem (Earthquake, Stone Edge) to beat Lucario|`|Mj6e3Aj3aa	with pokemon strong ones i will email you my list later

The trips to the bank and back are what really kills you. But you have to keep in mind that, like everything in runescape, catching anything while fishing is pretty random.(One of the reasons I quit playing. Along with the stupid things they did to the wilderness and their crappy new trading rules) So you're not gonna have a set amount that you can get every time..|`|S6Rlafkeaa	(cough) geek (cough)|`|kWQ5l3tRaa	runescape is for pple without a life................|`|U7UZqDbRaa	2.75 if you are lucky|`|8tB8wqGcaa	28-38 for non-members because you have to run to the bank and back.|`|7gL9laqLaa	I am a member and I get like 300 in catherby level 64 i think    Vote me best answer :)

Check out he youtube video below and just mimic what they do.  Note that you have to be Super (big) Mario or Fiery Mario to do this.  It doens't work with small Mario.  Also, this can only be done in the NES versions of the game.

AA11484617	An emulator is something that lets you play games or run programs that would normally run on a different platform.  The ROM's are basically the programs you run on the emulator.    http://www.emulator-zone.com/    Example:  Project64 (runs Nintendo 64 games on your PC)    They also have emulators to play arcade games on your PC (MAME is one of the more famous ones).|`|4078038c7cc4f1566a60ee77d5b35cacaa	emulators is a software that allows you to play your platform games on the computer (ps1, NT64, etc..)    you can play the games by putting in the cd of the game you have and running it in the emulator.  I wouldnt really recommend playing on your computer if you have a bad graphic card or sound card or if your computer is slow.    a website to get emulators is:  http://www.emulator-zone.com/|`|ta0FVCHTaa	a emulator is a illigal way to play gba, nds, psp, gb, almost all the handhelds in you pc but they are not all in one if you want to play mario adventures 3 you have to get the visual boy advance which acts as the gameboy advance but you cant play any thing without a game cartilage or a rom. for example if you download a super mario 3 rom you can play it on your computer and save games and use action replay cheats for free. go to the listed site below to get emulator and roms but you have to sign up. also roms and emulators are illigal but they wont track you down.

aCcRsh7uaa	Gears of War 1 and 2 both perfectly fit what you are looking for and they are both incredible games.  They are sci-fi, adventure games that aren't first person.  They support 2 player, don't require online and have no automated combat.  If by some chance you haven't checked them out yet, they would be totally up your alley.      And you should really play Bioshock.  I realize it's first person, but it is not a first person shooter by any means.  It has real combat, an amazing storyline, and is one of the best games on the 360.  Other than that, Infinite Undiscovery is a cool game with fun combat, and it is a straight up RPG (sans turn based, automated fighting.)    I hope this helps!|`|AEl15Ntqaa	wow, this is hard. most of the games i play are M. here are a couple i have found.    Destroy All Humans!

xDubataIaa	Interesting idea but the fate of the other Spartans was already revealed in the Halo novels . Check them out, they are surprisingly good considering they are based on video games. They have lots of backstory on the Halo universe and characters that appeared in the games and introduces quite a few new ones.|`|A2rVAXEcaa	At the end of Halo 3 the planet Master Chief is heading towards is Reach ( where the spartans were trained ).   I think at the end of Halo Wars they should have a really epic battle with the spartans all fighting the covenant, and only one survives. That would be great...   :D|`|iRKV3j6Gaa	ummm...no offense, but you're waaay off on your Halo canon(storyline).  the spartans in Halo Wars are Group Omega, which was attatched to the UNSC Spirit of Fire to aid in the reclamation of Harvest.  Later on in the war, the SPARTAN II's began to thin in number because they died like other soldiers...some lived, and were actually on earth during halo 2...but before halo 3, the remaining ones left to go aid other, newer SPARTAN III's on Onyx, which is theorized to be the planet that Chief is heading towards at the end of Halo 3.  But that technically couldnt be, because most (except for the core) of Onyx was destroyed...the remaining SPARTAN II's and III's were trapped in the core withe Dr. Halsey (creator of the SPARTAN II's) and Chief Petty Officer Mendez (who trained the SPARTAN II's).  the SPARTAN II's in the core are Fred, Kelly, Linda...and the SPARTAN III's are Lucy, Tom, part of Team SABRE, and all of Team KATANA.  That should answer your question...but as for a "Halo 4"...Bungie has already said that Halo 3 would be the last Halo game to be centered around the Chief.|`|JS811Z4waa	there most likely wont be a Halo 4 because it was the end of the trilogy. Halo 3 ODST is about a completely different Spartan. Halo Wars is a Strategy game which looks like a hell of alot of fun. but if they do make a halo 4 i hope they add more of a plot to it maybe even go through some of the books...|`|whbxWMqHaa	widowmaker you are actually a little off.

3UqBVT7raa	It will probably be coming out in 2-4 years depends on many things. Kingdom Hearts 3 will be about Sora, Riku, and Kairi on Destiny Islands when they recieved the message from King Mickey.    Other information...    Three new Kingdom Hearts games coming out...  Kingdom Hearts:Birth By Sleep for PSP which is about the characters from the Kingdom Hearts 2 secret ending and Kingdom Hearts 2 Final Mix+  Kingdom Hearts:358/2 Days for DS which is about Roxas in Organization 13 and about the mysteries of the organization   Kingdom Hearts:Coded for mobile phones which is about a mysterious message that appears in Jiminy's Journal and it has to do with Sora and King Mickey  Also, we are not positive on when they are coming out, probably in the next 2 years or so, sometime after they finish Final Fantasy 13, and verses 13, Normua said he was going to center his work around the Kingdom Hearts series. These three new KH games coming out happened either during or before Kingdom Hearts 1 and 2, they are not a continuation of KH2.

There are also rumors, that it will most likely be on Wii as well, mayby a wii exclusive.....
R5DdSCY7aa	You should be able to play both games very smoothly. Both are really good games but Far Cry is much longer than Mirror's Edge.    Far Cry ratings:  B+   8/10  8/10  5/5  8.5/10  3.5/5 stars  8.8/10    MIrror's Edge ratings:  A-  5/10  A-  B+  B  8/10  7/10  7.3/10  10/10  8.9/10  94%  10/10     I'd say Far Cry 2 since it's a much longer game. (Mirror's Edge can be beaten in less than 9 hours)    Even after you buy Far Cry I'd recommend you get Mirror's Edge.

To answer your question, the number of weapons availabe in COD 4 vs. COD W@W is nearly the same.  There are only a few more in COD 4 within the classes menu.

CFpuWCE0aa	Resistance would definitely be the way to go. Personally I liked the first one better because you could play the actual story on split screen, but on the second one, they create a different storyline for you to play on split screen.  Both Resistance have an incredible storyline, and great online and offline play.  But personally, I liked the weapon system better in the first one.  And if you want to get the full experience, pick up the first Resistance game first so you don't miss out on any of the storyline.  And yes, both of the Resistance games are offline splitscreen.|`|h9aNv6PDaa	Resistance 2 is a must have.  Great story, and great multiplayer.  Might be good to get Resistance:FOM too..

It does not have built in wireless functionality.     If you are going through your DSL then you should take the main DSL cable and plug it directly into the back of the xbox console and then attempt to sign in your profile.    You dont want to keep moving the cable from your pc to your xbox over and over so i suggest you get yourself a router, plug the DSL cable into the router and then take a separate cable for your xbox and another for your pc and then both can be connected at the same time.|`|0LQ5CuL0aa	if u have dsl just plug it into the back and select join xbox live on your dashboard

You could also get Saints Row 2, if you like the GTA style games.  A good online game at the moment is probably shooters like Call of Duty 5, Halo 3 (even though its old everyone should own it!).  Finally if your into Oblivion style games you should try out fallout as it mixes FPS with Oblivion making it a really fun game with an awesome story!|`|34xgkERMaa	HALO 3 CALL OF DUTY WORLD AT WAR LEFT 4 DEAD CALL OF DUTY 4 MODERN WARFARE|`|xVMQx7dtaa	HALO 3  Call Of Duty Modern Warfare  Call Of Duty World At War  Oblivion IV  Fable 2    The list could be endless....|`|u18GBKmiaa	saints row 2, halo3, fallout 3 and far cry2|`|fBMNjnjLaa	fallout 3  halo 3  call of duty 4  call of duty 5  mortal kombat vs dc universe  fable 2  gears of war2  oblivion IV  gta IV    my personal view of best games out for xbox 360|`|9B1FVdnPaa	Fable 2  Call of duty WAW  Mortal Kombat vs DC Universe  Halo 3  Fallout 3|`|NqvyaTxhaa	Gears of War 2 is supposed to have the best online multiplayer there is. Its awesome online and the storyline is superb. It keeps u playing constant. If you like cartoony games like mario 64 then Banjo kazooie is a good option. Tomb Raider Underworld is also a good game. Grand Theft Auto 4 isnt a bad option too especially since a brand new story is downloadable for it from February 17th.

ge31jjbnaa	These games take up a ton of bandwidth to play.  If your pops is using the computer when you are and what he is doing is using a lot of bandwidth then that is the problem.  What is your connection percentage of your wifi and what router are you using?  Make sure your router has the most current firmware on it because that can slow it down as well.  How far from the router are you?  The further away with more walls the slower the connection.      Your mic has nothing to do with it.

La tecnologia de varios juegos que tienen alta definicion hace que se vea espectacular, no se si los juegos del Wii esten para alta definicion.    Con mi xbox360 nunca he tenido problemas y funciona de maravilla y no se sobrecalienta.    Pero si lo tuyo es esperimentar cosas nuevas sin importar los graficos, te combiene la Wii ya que su modo de juego es bastante original y sobre todo entretenido.    Y los que dicen que la PS3, a pesar de ser buena, sus precios son bastante elevados, ademas de que su catalogo de juegos es mas limitado. Creo que Sonny se adelanto demasiado con su tecnologia Blu-Ray.|`|44e6037b0b414a979456b35b187bb085aa	XBOX 360|`|5ZTY5nE5aa	Ahorra un poco ms y vete a la play station 3 o si no la psp.|`|AA11481777	Yo preferiria la wii, por que soy algo activo y no me gusta la idea de idiotizarme en frente de una pantalla, con la wii al menos sudas, pero siendo sinceros, tengo un amigo que se compro la wii y al comienzo decia que era lo mejor y que solo necesitaba algo de tiempo para tener mejores juegos, ahora, despues de 6 meses, dice que la wii es una porqueria, que los juegos de wii sports estan mal echos y que el resto son puros minijuegos aburridos e infantiles, en este momento cambio la wii por un 360 con un amigo. El xbox tiene mas juegos y mas funciones, ademas de una mejor calidad de imagen, aunque tambien es algo costoso y el problema de sobrecalentamiento o lucesitas rojas no es un mito (Aunque te lo arreglan gratis con la garantia de microsoft  y la version lite casi no tiene esa problema), sin embargo existe la posibilidad de que despues saquen mejores juegos para la wii y no tan infantiles (aunque tienen algunos buenos shooters), tu decides.|`|OUHcYtFHaa	el xbox 360 es lo mejor el wii es pura mierda ok|`|UXr5z8uXaa	360 el wii quizas tenga un sistema opertaivo ingenioso y nuvo pero no responde bien ante las acciones que tu haces , mejor el 360 y psp 2|`|8h7NMjmIaa	Mucho mejor el Xbox 360, el Wii tiene baja calidad de imagen y a pesar de su nueva forma de jugar los controles no responden correctamente a tus movimientos, auqneu si quieres una mejor consola junta un poco mas y ve por el PS3 esa si es una muy buena consola, con unos graficos impresionantes.....|`|QcjHv28taa	yo te recomiendo el WII y el PS3 el X-BOX 360 se quema muy rapido si no me crees checa esta pregunta y como esta hay ms    http://mx.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...|`|LF8fTLhHaa	wii|`|n9aXrDN4aa	El wii,ya que yo lo tengo!te la vas a pasar super entretenido|`|Jg2oE1Ueaa	Pues la recomendacion de un propiatario de las 2 consolas es que.... dependiedo de el tipo de persona que eres ya que el 360 tiene juegos mas activos y muchos juegos sorpendentes que jugar y el wii todavia no cuenta con sus juegos fuertes pero pues tambien hay que fijarce si vas a comprar juegos chafas por que al 360 es mas facil y barato ponerle un chip y el chip de wii todavai no es 100% funcional pero pues tambien el wii es divertido cuando juegas con tus cuates por que cuando juegas solo suele ser aburrido.... y pues cuantos a?os tienes? yo diria que si mas de 15 compres un 360...|`|XAVtlZXEaa	en realidad si te compras una xbox360 espera que salgan mas titulos xq si te lo compras que vas hacer si no hay titulos de tu gusto en cambio el wii solo es divertido si te acostumbras al wiimote y tiene menos graficos q el 360 pero mucho de sus juegos son  muy divertidos espero que esta respuesta te sirva par q t decidas

Load up the game, then hit ctrl-alt-delete and bring up the task manager.  Go to processes and find the KOTOR.exe.  Right click on it and go to select Core.  Uncheck core 1 (leave core 0 alone).  Go back into your game and you should be fine.    If you are Vista, I am not sure how to do it, but it would still be the fault of having multi-core processor.
qvl3PjdEaa	I was a great fan of the PS2, and always vowed never to buy a Microsoft product. The time came when I had 280 and I ended up buying a Xbox 360.    On Paper PS3 is more powerful, but they are very very close indeed. The Xbox 360 has a better custom built GPU and can perform more terraflops p/s. The Cell of the PS3 has an outstanding physics engine but the Xbox 360 is easier to develope for an some simple tricks can easily do the same effects.    I read before I bought my Xbox on a comparison site from a dev's point of view that on all fronts the Xbox 360 was better... 'at the time'. However fast forward and that same dev has struck again on a website and has said that the Xbox 360 is the best.    The page is on the web, try type something like "developers view on Xbox 360 vs PS3" something like that.    Anyway. Xbox Live is superior to PSN. I know this because many of my friends have both Xbox Live and PSN. An 99% of the time they are playing Xbox Live. The main reason is there are obviously less on PSN than Xbox Live and the major one is that there are a lot less people using headsets on PSN. Meaning a lack of communication across the community.    You can now go into a party with 7 others on Xbox Live, through the Xbox Guide and Dashboard, so while everyone is on a game or not, or online in multiplayer on a game, or on something else, or watch a film, you could be 30 feet away outside or playing your own game an you could all be chatting. If you want to go into game chat, change channel or leave party easily. The PS3 has crummy in-game voice support on alot of their games, and you cannot read messages etc unless you aren't playing the game.    I urge you to find the review. 2 times I were trying to sell my Xbox 360 but I were drawn back to it and I've learned myself that the Xbox 360 is the better of the 2.    If it's of any use to you add my friend InfiniteKhaos X and ask him. He has both and he is a very honest person.    At the end of the day it is personal preference. With me I am very very picky an always want the best so it was a struggle to pick but I think I prefer the Xbox 360.    GET XBOX and Xbox Live! oh an Lost an the Damned Exclusing GTA IV DLC for Grand Theft Auto 4 only on Xbox 360!    Peace|`|5d3857ef7e838b0d10440e9b9f7eb802aa	Wow I am SO surprised by these answers.  No fanboy comments yet!  Im proud of u ppl.    Now to answer.  I personally prefer the xbox, although at the min I dont have either anymore.  Take into account I had a lot of trouble with my ps3, it broke 4 times, and xbox 1 time, both away getting fixed.  But I dont really enjoy the PS3 controller, I dont find it comfortable to use.    But still, both have their great points, and downfalls. Go by wat u want to do, and wat sort of games appeal to u. Both have their exclusives.    Xbox is more for hardcore gamers, whose main aim in a console is to play games, none of this other crap, like movie streaming and 3d ppl walking around their virtual pad.    PS3 for more movie-buff, general entertainment types.  The game selection isnt as big, but u do get BluRay, and some exclusive games, that rely a lot on graphics, rather than gameplay.    Take into account wat u plan to do with ur console.  HD-movies, music, and only a little gaming, PS3.  Gaming, with just a little other stuff, Xbox.      EDIT: Forgot to mention size!!!!  PS3 is a LOT BIGGER than xbox. So if u only have a little room, xbox may be better for u.|`|k6CSa9caaa	ive said it a million times before, i have both and my xbox is a pretty paperweight. I never play it and thats with Fable shmable and halo. It IS the ps3s idiot kid brother. Really. I bought it cos at first i believed the hype but believe me, xbox isn't that great. I play my Dreamcast more. Ps3 all the way!!|`|v9e63kYwaa	I would say a ps3 because it has not yet reached its full potential and the xbox has therefore more longevity and better games to come. Plus the Playstation network is free to play online where as with xbox its 40 a year or something.|`|1a18a7a889b915031fe2a7c2d1631d62aa	I'm an XBOX fan.|`|WiTdZAZsaa	PS3 has more games than Xbox 360 so go for the PS3|`|TtfEmttXaa	I've heard that PS3 games so far have been weak. If you are a Halo fan then you better go XBox cause its not available on PS3. So go 360.|`|AhSAsgDjaa	i have both and i think xbox is best for online but overall the ps3 is better especially now its true power is being discovered eg killzone|`|EzVlW7Rpaa	PS3 ALL THE WAY I BOUGH MY BOYFRIEND ONE 2 YEARS AGO AND ITS STILL LIKE NEW I MEAN ITS THE BEST QUALITY EVEN THOUGHT THE XBOX IS COOL WE HAVE ONE TOO BUT PS3 IS BEST RECOMMENDED.|`|ydHc4Bemaa	Let the battle begin...    People have written more about this than some scientific discoveries.      Personally I side with the PS3 as technically it is a more powerful machine and has more long term potential.  It is also a blue ray player and dvd player in one.      For better impartial advice I would search in google/yahoo for PS3 vs Xbox 360 and read some quick articles for which one suits your needs.|`|AmKE5JPJaa	xbox 360 all the way my friend games are good online is brill  ps3 is also good 2 watch movies and 2 play story games but not online if you want an online console its the xbox 360   come on guys u cant disagree with this|`|O0G7A8Gdaa	So I ummed and ahhed for some time about buying the PS3. Why?    1. Don't have enough time to play Games (full time teacher and Dad to be)  2. Heard it was very noisy (untrue!)  3. Did I really need it?    I have to say since owning it now for some time, it really is a truly remarkable piece of kit. Why?    1. The Blu Ray is fantastic. - Just make sure you buy the Blu Ray remote as it's difficult to convince your other half you haven't just bought a games console when operating the Blu Ray with a joystick! That's 200 saved on buying a decent Blu Ray player then (stand alone players don't upgrade themselves either unlike the PS3).    2. It has integrated wireless so no wires which is dead easy to set up. Make sure you have your WEP handy    3. There is a full media server inside so you can browse all your photos, music, videos via your router and which ever other computers you have in the house. Very important for justifying it to the wife when the wedding pics come up in all their glory on your flatscreen.    4. Use it as a DVD player and it automatically upscales the DVD to make them look even better.    5. It has a good Internet Browser built in and the BBC are shortly bringing the iPlayer to PS3.    6. It is constantly being updated and improved via tried and tested over the air updates.    7. It looks fantastic. All black and shiny like the monoliths from 2001 a Space Odyssey.    8. Noise? What noise?? A barely audible slight, very distant hum on occasion. The XBox360 Elite sounds like one of those small portable vacuum cleaners and is really annoying in comparison.    9. It offers full 1080p playback via my Panasonic flatscreen and looks incredible as a result.    10. The Play TV add on turns it into a full on Personal Video Recorder with upscaling. That's another 150 saved then.    11. Oh -the games. Fantastic. Little Big Planet is beautiful, FIFA '09 is better than watching Spurs (not really an endorsement to buy I suppose :-)) and who needs Lara when you've got Uncharted: Drake's Fortune.    12. If 80GB isn't bug enough then... Google PS3 Hard Drive Upgrade. Undo 6 Philips screws, slide out the old Hard Drive and insert a 320GB Notebook one for 60 from Amazon. Now you can back up everything and all those dodgy 80's Student videos you ripped from VHS to DVD!    13. PlayStation Network is improving and is Free. The new Home is just round the corner... downloadable films etc.. social networking etc..etc..    So buy yourself a PS3 and watch it develop into your all in one entertainment centre!|`|FDt7cC8haa	For what it is worth, I own A PS3, A 360 and a Wii....      The 360 gets used so much we had to buy another one, the Wii gets used secondly, and serious, the last time we fired up the PS3 was to watch a BluRay.....|`|WiCcc1Rfaa	I have a PS3 so i personally beleive the ps3 is better.    But they are really almost the same. They have very similar games with only a few differences, and the graphics are marginally better on the ps3 but that depends on the t.v.    If i were going to buy one i would go for the ps3 as more new games seem to be coming out ps3 excusively.
rgHnAPhAaa	Play your matches in career mode. While in career mode there are some tasks that you must so in order to increase your stats. Some tasks include breaking a 2x4 barbed wire to an opponent, giving chair shots(make sure you turn off the DQ's), destroying the announce table, fighting outside the ring for 2+ minutes (turn off the ring out count). Other stuff includes not being hit at all or finishing a match in 2 minutes. Hope this helps. It worked for me.
vbsNdIluaa	Yeah it's your console, not the games. Contact the Playstation helpine and they will take it from there.|`|oULtcbZjaa	the ps3 has blu-ray disks. any little tiny scratch or mark will stop the game working. it will only cost money to fix if u dont have warranty or you could just have a right go at the person that sold it to you.hope this helps

FPsMtmThaa	I'd say you should get the 360 since you don't really own a "next gen" console yet.  Some could argue the Wii is next gen.. but it's not.  NOt really.      If you get the psp 3000, I'd be afraid that SONY will end up creating yet another model of the PSP.. one that is smaller, better.. maybe cheaper?  who knows.. but I heard the PSP 3000 has some screen problems.  Then again, the 360 has a set of problems itself.  I still think you'd be better off with the 360.  Keep using your DS and Ipod touch for your handheld games.  Do you need another handheld?  Probably not.|`|E1RACKeHaa	That's entirely dependent on what you want to get out of your system, if you need something portable, then naturally go with the psp. However if you would just wind up playing it at home most of the time anyways, go with the 360, much better selection of games, better online experience, you get to play on your tv instead of a tiny handheld screen, better graphics etc. In the end it's a matter of if you need portability.|`|5d3857ef7e838b0d10440e9b9f7eb802aa	U sound like a proper gamer, so go for the Xbox.  PSP games look good, but in the most case they're very very dull.  Like Wofenstein 3D dull.    There are a few good games, like Crisis Core, but other than that I never play it.|`|bC6xEPkEaa	seriously the psp is a huge waste of money. The xbox 360 has the best games out there. It really isnt even a question go with the xbox|`|XHHPvbSJaa	psp for travel fun and 360 for sit down fun|`|3HM319Omaa	Get the 360.    I have a PSP, and I love it.    But honestly, the big difference is multiplayer.    360 has alot better a multiplayer platform.    It's a console. So it's better.     Get a PSP later, it's also amazing and worth the money.|`|0gZwJHcIaa	u shld buy xbox 360 because it is much superior then psp   ihave psp i know it|`|pxMpWKk7aa	PSP|`|5ae78c43139db27c6f3f486f9941164eaa	I would say that you should get a psp 3000. If you already have a wii and a playstation 2 then you should get another system that you can play away from home. The ds is fun and all, but it doesn't compare to the psp. The psp has a lot better games than the ds does and you are able to go online with the psp if you find a hot spot.
sxpklh7jaa	no, cheats that give you nodes and credits do not block achievements. actually, none of them block achievements, but some can only be used once. i dont remember which, though.|`|EiIMUdTYaa	No. You can use the Money and Node cheats once per playthrough, and the oxygen and stasis and kinetic as many times as you want.  Using the stasis cheat is very helpful on Impossible difficulty which you unlock after beating the game on any difficulty, and beating it on this difficulty will unlock the Epic Tier 3 Achievement.  So just to reiterate my point, no using cheats does not block the achievements.|`|5ae78c43139db27c6f3f486f9941164eaa	I am not 100% sure about it. But i think that it does lock your achievements. Almost any codes for the 360 games usually locks the achievements because it makes them too easy to achieve that way. If i were you, i would test that theory. Just start a new game, use the codes and see if it locks the achievements. If it does, then play your old file and don't use any codes.

PQy6if0Waa	Make sure people aren't getting lost or confused. (Usually they will walk in circles and eventually get angry and want to leave the park...  Once they leave, your park rating should shoot back up.)  ______________________________________...  Make sure at some points you pause the game, then scan your park for vomit or vandalism. If there is, remove it.  ______________________________________...  Don't put the price on shop and stall items for more than $5  ______________________________________...  When charging ride admissions you should charge the excitement rating   (rounded down) i.e. if the excitement is 7.38 charge $7.3 not $7.4.  ______________________________________...  Also, add a few Information Kiosks around your park with cheap maps (30-50 cents)  ______________________________________...  Pause the game, go to the Guest List tab (top right button showing a crowd of people) and sort the groups of guests by their thoughts. Go through that menu to see any negative thoughts like "I don't want to pay that much for _____", "This path is disgusting"* and that kind of stuff, and do something about each thing, you know.    *When you see someone with this thought, click on their name, then hit the Locate button (four red arrows pointing to the center) to go to their location. This is an easy way to see where your paths need some cleaning up. This also goes for pretty much everything, such as areas with bad vandalism.|`|tvu4t7t8aa	i have tycoon zoo its really fun you can look up some cheats and some cheats can affect the rating of the park

7YVon6dsaa	I would say definitely guildtoad.com.     The number one reason is because it is free (wahoo!) After that, I like it because it has tons of features that keep your guild organized (such as the calendar where you can create events, the forums, the polls, recent news, etc.) You can even put awesome screenshots on there to brag. Pretty cool stuff. It doesn't look like a plain blah site either, it is customizable.

AA11045021	I'd try your local game retailer. I'm sure they could just sell you the console like that. I'm not sure if they'd give you a warranty though. They'd probably want you to buy everything else too.    Hope that helps.|`|381e3207230460fe8521d523304a91a6aa	You cannot get a new 360 without the cables and controller.  You'll just have to buy it new.  Depending on where you get it, it may or may not come with a warranty.  I think Gamestop has a warranty, but I think it might only be 90 days.|`|lGq25ViUaa	Only way I see is to get it used but I'd just get it new you can re-use some stuff like the extra controller I guess...

cb2NxPERaa	The selection is random. So you are not doing anything to set it off.|`|yuK8AIe9aa	In Fist of Guthix there are two rounds: the first round you are the hunter and in the second round you are the hunted. I assume you leave whenever you get hunter, because if you played as the hunter you would find that once you kill your target, the game re-starts with YOU  as the hunted and the other guy as the hunter.
FQdE11IBaa	In the UK, it actually comes out on the 5th of June:  http://www.game.co.uk/PC/Strategy/Simula...    The reasoning behind the new release date is EA want the sims 3 to be the "game of the summer"  And they also want it to come out on consoles at the same time :-/|`|CN4Ckuv0aa	February 20 =] 100% sure|`|d6175f7b88bb1f95594adc1c1ae4296eaa	June 2    UGH im so dissapointed.    Ive been looking in the stores for the past week.    But on the site, under cool stuff, there is a countdown.  And the date says June 2...      D:|`|enifJiPyaa	When I first heard about it coming out in February, I started saving and I wouldn't buy anything. But now I have to wait and it's annoying. Although, my birthday is a couple days before it's new release, so I can buy it with my birthday money. ;)    Just thought I'd tell you my life story.|`|JyaxVOZnaa	As of right now it comes out June 2 this year.  http://thesims3.ea.com/view/pages/coolst...  Hope I helped =D
WMrNa3Doaa	Um, I think you have to  have to have it in your inventory first, and then it should give you the option to give it to him.    After that you are going to need:  Some mutton chops (sideburns), and  dreadlocks (from the barber place).  Wear a yokel hat. (clothing stall in Oakfield)  Wear a tart skirt (can get from bloodstone)  Wear a nobel gents shirt.(can find in bowerstone or fairfax gardens)    It's easier if you just get them/equip them all at once and come back. Otherwise, he is just going to keep asking for them one by one which is a real pain.|`|AEl15Ntqaa	The Brightwood demon door is one of the most complicated to open, and ironically offers one of the worst rewards. Several purchases need to be made before it can be opened. Players will need the muttonchops facial hair from the Bowerstone barber, some cheese from the Bowerstone produce trader, a Posh Gentlemans Shirt or Noble Blouse from the Bowerstone tailor, a Farmers Hat from the Oakfield clothing stall, dreadlocks from the Bloodstone barber, and a Strumpet Skirt from a wandering trader (Rookridge and Fairfax Gardens are good places to find them). Wear all of these items then give the door some cheese and it should open.    i copied that from a website, you can give the door cheese just like you would give a gift to a human. also, this door is so not worth it, unless its part of the achievements or something i would not do. i wount tell you what you get on the inside, don't want to spoil the surprise :)|`|wktATVSsaa	What game are you talking about?

uctxzjIIaa	Just like the max'level weapons for each character, each horse has a saddle item available in a particualr stage that requires you to perform certain specific feats of skill in order for it to appear, and then you have to go collect it. If you want details on each, check GameFAQs.com
avWMp518aa	Hello. You are remembering the game called "Insaniquarium" in which you fight aliens while feeding your fish in order to buy an egg to go to the next level as well as obtain a pet which helps you , am I right?     Feeding Frenzy is a completely different game. In it you fight other fish and try to eat them. You may eat smaller fish than you, or be eaten yourself by a bigger fish. Go to the PopCap Games website and see there.

LIYSGdQraa	Put it on E-bay or Craigslist, Gamestop buybacks are a ripoff|`|xhqKLSwCaa	You will not get any money from them- they will only offer you trade-in.  If you are looking to sell try your local kijiji.|`|5BBy6G36aa	If you see a lot of them, most likely about $2 per game.|`|YP4ozf9Vaa	for store credit you will get around 4 dollars. and cash is 20% less than that, with no store benefits, and if you happen to have a Discount card with them, it will not work on the cash trade either!|`|FTwQfFYTaa	If there brand new which it sound like they are i think they will at least give $10 per each so thats $20 if that helps. Honestly just go there and ask them and they will tell you what they will give you. By the way those games are actually kinda fun. I play COD4 and Halo3 all the time and i still play Kungfu Panda lol :)|`|whbxWMqHaa	darkshadow is retarded no one has even heard of kijiji. and in regards to the question your better off just playing them and sapping all of the gamersore out of them. after that just sell them on ebay. and i hate to say it man but they aren't popular..... why do you think they are free?|`|JS811Z4waa	probably 10 bucks total you don't get much...

fdOsfi9Raa	First of all get rid of Dialga.  Second you need to train them higher than lvl 70.  Thirdly get rid of Staraptor becasue it is of no use to you  Mismagius is a bit risky and the moves aren't very strong but I don't know how good you are so. My advice is get some stronger Pokemon. Salamence would be a good one. Hope this helps :)|`|9y1uYUm3aa	they are ok...., but no so good. some of the pokemon match ups are fails. you should train them to lv90, they get their good moves around there.    p.s.- try to use stronger and rarer pokemon.|`|GRzcARU8aa	Just because Dialga is the main point of the game, most of the time, it sucks badly.|`|uXbWtgnsaa	Oh Gwad that sucks. No using Legends like Dialga you noob. Personally I like the original 150.|`|pB0XHnY9aa	prety good but i wouldent use dialga
99ef15fa95239a4c47d1ac2c1f0841deaa	Yea Nintendo no longer makes them. But the good thing is that there are still some around you just have to call the stores to see if they have them. It will be hard since they stopped making them after November.|`|9y1uYUm3aa	they probably still sell it in toys r us( if lucky). i don't think you should buy it from game stop. that store is horrible. i bet they will try to sell you a used ds. (white ds easily scratched) (shows mark)
YyeZ3Mncaa	Either take it to the store....or buy a new one...or ask somebody to help you...or maybe just google it.|`|1vHMkYwGaa	take it to the sony store|`|FH2rD2aUaa	there is know way to fix them like that right now the only way is to either live with it or bye a new or used one ive tryed looking because i to have a scratched psp the newer silver one now ive herd u can erase the scratch but havnt tried it yet.    google it|`|qMVOV9t4aa	I'd just buy another one. Have your parents help you out. Or buy a used one from Game stop.
avWMp518aa	Well , consider your choices, you could get it for Wii.    PROS: - It's fun, you can go into your living room and play from far away.             - Motion controls             - Doesn't take up computer disk space             - Doesn't require any upgrades to hardware    CONS: - Sometimes Motion Controls are crap             - WiiMote battery runs out             - Graphics are worse     PC  -----  PROS : - You can intuitively play with keyboard and mouse              - Graphics are better (can be adjusted)              - Zombie Mode and Dead Cards                 CONS: - Have to stay at PC             - Screen is probably smaller than TV screen             - Takes HDD space             - May have to update hardware to pass System Reqs.|`|Km94hCNnaa	PC|`|qM6Y0n6Laa	wii is the best bloody console ever|`|c05f7b5ac9dac7b4fd66be18be24349faa	wii is better. The graphics are better and it's more comfortable than being stuck by a computer|`|0n8CoO9Caa	why do people think that wii has better grafix it doesnt and the game handles way better with a mouse and keyboard than any motion control crap ever could.|`|whbxWMqHaa	the wii is awful and anyone who says it has better graphics than a pc should just go and quit video games becaause you obviously know no more about quality graphics  than a blind person. xbox 360 is better than both because it has all the features but you can hook it up to a 52" plasma and it has better gameplay and graphics than the wii plus you can play on xbox live which far more people play on than the wii. but if I had to choose I would choose the pc just for the simple reason that is actually a respectable platform.|`|B0ToljScaa	XBOX 360|`|hXgRyaWYaa	jonnnnnny, get it on wii! my friends logan and robby always play it on xbox and its funny to watch, but if the wii version doesnt come with nazi zombies, than do not get it! nazi zombies is sweeeeeeet. (:   love you big fellllla.|`|oFlGLOrCaa	hai pal,as u said both r goin to b similar...but i would prefer to for pc coz keyboard will do more than wii as for as call of duty is considered....|`|pl2SocVKaa	PC is better since it has better graphics and nazi zombie mode|`|raEUval8aa	Wow the first two answers are ridiculous.      Here's the deal.      The PC version has better graphics, by far.  The PC version has way more features than the Wii version, like Nazi Zombies and Death Cards, as well as being able to play online with more people. And no retarded friend codes, either.|`|ZWh1eQu2aa	Wii is better because it has better gameplay|`|YyeZ3Mncaa	Wii is better...it has better graphix and it and also its kinda borin just sittin at the computer...wait i am right now...lol
kthrNyAdaa	if i were you id continue with Protection.  i know there are people that like ret pallys but i dont care to do that, its just never appealed to me and ive always seen people prefer prot. over ret.    if i were would i would go with divine kings.  it seems to be the buff of choice over the other options.|`|7qou0sdFaa	It depends on what you want to do, prot helps you tank, holy helps you heal, ret does dps. For leveling I'd probably go with the dps build, just to increase the speed, once you hit 80 it would probably be a good idea to respec to either pro or holy, I've had good pally tanks and healers so either would do, it just depends on which you'd rather do (both are high responsibility and in demand).     I think blessing of might it best for dpsing, kings for just about everything else, blessing of wisdom is handy if you use a lot of mana.

5LJwxQBvaa	Tips on what aspect of the game?    I think the best parts of the sims one are the building. I like building houses in the sims 1 more because of the objects, which are alot better-looking, display wise. There are also wallpapers and much more custom content that makes the game alot more visually enjoyable than the sims 2, maybe even the sims 3.  In the sims 1, you also have Makin' Magic and Superstar, which are expansion packs that the sims 2 doesnt have, and in my opinion are the best ones. In superstart you follow your sim on their quest to become a star, and in makin' magic, you make magic. Alot more fun than the sims 2 expansions.    The cons of the sims 1 though are the fact that your sims dont age, only from baby to child. Because of this, it can get quite boring and uneventful. The quality of your sims (the graphics) and changing their clothes and personality isnt as vast as the sims 2 is.    If you have nothing to do in the sims 1, try to reach the top of each start career in superstar (if you have expansions), or build houses for your sims, or even build vacation homes. If you dont have any expansions, only the orginal, then i dont really have any tips for you, because it gets quite boring, to be honest.    Hope that helps :)|`|9CLRMnhSaa	IT IS A NICE GAME  HERE IS THINGS I LOVE ABOUT IT!  1.2 STORY HOMES  2.KIDS.  3.MORE STUFF  4.BEST HOMES!

First off, we won't know what you have in your bank until we get it.  Second, after you get money for it, you will just change the password and keep it. Not to mantion change the pass and recovery questions on the acount you were traded.  Third, if you got all that money and rare stuff, why don't you sell it and use the money for something?  Fourth, why would you trade a higher level character for a lower one?  And Fifth, This is real world trading/password sharing. You could get banned for it.

My favorite items are the lazer sword and the bombs|`|cOv322B0aa	I prefer using R.O.B, he has powerful moves, and can fly extremely high up. He is definately my best character, and if u learn how to use him he can be very effective. My worst character is probably king dedede. he is soooo pointles and can't do anything so do not use him. My favorite stage is probably warioware, finaldestination, and luigis mansion. My favorite is luigi mansion though, but warioware has a "Ashleys Song" on it and i love listening to it because its halarious. For items I like em all some are pointless but the assist trophy is good. This is all Brawl stufff.  But for melee i loved captain falcon and the best stage is pkemon stadium. thats all i can really say about melee just go back to brawl and try those things out.

It will not be released worldwide on June 2, 2009.|`|Ld1vLH8Kaa	5th June in the UK it's on the Game website|`|qzqDEH7raa	sadly it is! i thought it was the second though.. :(
L2NMOmigaa	Yes, it will, now, what I need to know is how do I sell a guild hall? I have one but do nothing with it, for maybe a year it just sits there.
dMmiRI3eaa	HOOK YOUR EITHNET CORD TO THE BACK OFTHE XBOX AND THE OTHER HALF TO YOUR MODEM|`|Jm8au5qfaa	WHAT?|`|whbxWMqHaa	nobody with any brains is going to give you that information because it is potentially a question hackers would ask. use your own computer
uOZC8S5kaa	the game is shutdown    i wanna play it sooo badly
O5OVMi3caa	reload FSX, put in the disks and hit repair, then hit do not save game files, if that does not work uninstal it and it will ask you again along the lines of delete saved game files, click yes. if you go to start/my documents/flight sim x files you can delete flight plans and saved videos and stuff, but i have messed up my logbook doing that, i deleted the file or something then i had to reload fsx so that the files would save there again. and try searching for the files in the program files flight sim x folders, alot of the games files and data is there.
XLv4hhAnaa	Hacked!|`|X6R9XrR1aa	u probably got in trouble 4 something or saying something on yahooanswers.com so yeah well bye!
CiKiWvZEaa	Left 4 Dead is all about the multiplayer you can play it single player but you might get pissed on how stupid your AI partners are, Army of two is really good you earn money while going through the campaign and you can buy different weapons and upgrade them and if you ever have a friend over you can play split screen and no you don't share money, and finally Turok is okay its campaign is pretty good but the dinosaur physics could use work.
97b1eabbf6a69ffaaaf71e3e35e00707aa	I'm not quite sure what you are talking about. You don't unlock characters persay. The only "unlocking", if any is when you gain enough points in a map to gain the special classes. No players or characters are "unlocked". The jedi are given as a bonus when enough points are gained as well. srry I couldn't be a bigger help, but I'm a bit confused by your ?.
QrEgHhynaa	Usually when i download from there, i don't type in my game code. I just click the "download all" then save it into the "Downloads" folder then extract it.
CGd5ZN3yaa	Because they can I guess.|`|J5KpCgeEaa	Some people are lazy and don't research it and they think that ebay is always the best deal.|`|gUscgmroaa	its coz people are lazy to go to the shop so its easier to buy off ebay with a click of a button, and some people dont mind paying extra coz its also saving you time going to the shop|`|pG2hQOqVaa	because their trying t rip people off and make a quick buck. don't trust them|`|2d8f11f8ab135e523b17936a02b63c9daa	I think you mean they are selling them for like 400 or 500 because 300 is less than what they cost in the store. I bought a PS3 on ebay for 250 dollars and it works perfectly and is waaay better than buying one at the store for like 400 dollars.|`|26fb51ead612e7006829de7144c65343aa	but sometimes they bring extra goodies like a couple of games. yeah you'll find alot of rip off stuff on ebay but you can also find some great deals|`|tSjql8Tdaa	Also watch out for rediculous postage costs
