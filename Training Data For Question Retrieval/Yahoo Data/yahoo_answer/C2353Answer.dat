The answer is A.<br>  <br>  First <br>  (4x)(5x) = 20x^2<br>  <br>  Outside (4x)(3) = 12x<br>  <br>  Inside (-3)(5x) = -15x<br>  <br>  Last (-3)(3) = -9<br>  <br>  This yields us. . .<br>  <br>  20x^2 + 12x - 15x - 9 <br>  <br>  We combine like terms and we get . . .<br>  <br>  20x^2 - 3x - 9<br>  <br>  The correct answer.|`|7rp50tUBaa	ok so 20x^2-3x-9 = A.(4x-3)(5x+3)<br>  <br>  (4x-3)(5x+3)=20x^2+12x-15x-9=20x^2-3x-...<br>  <br>  so choice A is the right one

Je5ffMJnaa	I'm a political science major at my university. Our department has concentrations in Comparative Politics, International Politics, Political Theory, Public Law & Administration, American Politics and Methodology. At most schools, you should be able to concentrate your political science courses in a specific area, like one of these.<br>  <br>  Many political science majors go on to law school or other grad school programs (MSW, MBA, MPA, MPH, etc.). Some of them do become lobbyists, work on campaigns, work in government or run for office themselves. You could also do research professionally in this field. A political science degree leaves you with lots of options for grad school or careers when you graduate. For example, my focus is in Public Law & Administration and I plan to get an MBA and work in nonprofit management when I graduate.|`|JbxrUJp2aa	If you don't know much about it, why do you want to do it?

mSVXV2gbaa	1.  If Jonas left the community, they would gain access to all the memories<br>  2.  It is this anger and grief, fueled by the Giver's growing love for Jonas and Jonas's own youthful energy, that allow the Giver to finally overturn his years of silence and endurance and change the community.<br>  3.  IDk (sorry)<br>  4.  Music from the village celebrating Christmas is my best guess.<br>  5.  The Giver and Jonas plan for Jonas to escape the community and to actually enter Elsewhere. Once he has done that, his larger supply of memories will disperse, and the Giver will help the community to come to terms with the new feelings and thoughts, changing the society forever.<br>   <br>  However, Jonas is forced to leave earlier than planned when his father tells him that Gabriel will be released the next day. Desperate to save Gabriel, Jonas steals his father's bicycle and a supply of food and sets off for Elsewhere. Gradually, he enters a landscape full of color, animals, and changing weather, but also hunger, danger, and exhaustion. Avoiding search planes, Jonas and Gabriel travel for a long time until heavy snow makes bike travel impossible. Half-frozen, but comforting Gabriel with memories of sunshine and friendship, Jonas mounts a high hill. There he finds a sled—the sled from his first transmitted memory—waiting for him at the top. Jonas and Gabriel experience a glorious downhill ride on the sled. Ahead of them, they see—or think they see—the twinkling lights of a friendly village at Christmas, and they hear music. Jonas is sure that someone is waiting for them there.<br>  <br>  So...it was bad for him to leave early because he was not prepared - for taking Gabe, for the weather, etc<br>  <br>  6.  The Giver was not satisfied with the status quo, either - he had experienced love (his daughter, and Jonas) and knew things could be better than "same".

She advised me,Wear the flag pin and stop complaining."(3) I'm so glad I listened.<br>  <br>  I attended Reverent Wright’s church for over 20 years. It is a church that believes in black liberation theology. Black liberation theology supports the idea that all white people should have to pay money to African Americans to compensate for slavery. That same church gave an award to Louis Farrakhan as their “person of the year”. I also participated in Farrakhan’s “million man march.”<br>  <br>   INCOMING!!(9) I GOTS MORE TO TELL YOU!!!<br>  <br>  I am friends with a man named William Ayers. Ayers formed the group known as “the weather underground”, which committed several terrorist attacks, including an attempt to bomb the US capitol building. Despite being aware of this information, I decided to serve on a board with Ayers and also began his political career at Ayer’s home.<br>  Ayers recently said that he does not regret the terrorist attacks and wishes that he could have done more.

I did nothing to reform it. I  had my  first political mentor Alice Palmer, thrown off the ballot in Illinois in order to take her place in the Illinois State Senate.

Looking out for the Mrs, you know.<br>  <br>  I implied I was poor and grew up on food stamps; I grew up mostly with MY  grandparents, who were upper middle-class bankers in Hawaii. Food stamps weren’t available in Hawaii until the seventies.<br>  <br>   I falsely claim to not accept oil money, but in fact I have accepted more than $213,000 from individuals who work for companies in the oil and gas industry and their spouses.

Prince Talal is most famous for offering $10 million to the City of New York following 9/11, a contribution turned down by Mayor Rudy Giuliani because the Prince said American policies were to blame for the terrorist attacks. Prince Alwaleed has made tens of millions in contributions to Muslim-American charities, some of whose leaders have been charged by our government with terrorism-related ties. Prince Alwaleed also donates millions to Harvard for Islamic studies.

She couldn't exactly carry it, and it would look kind of strange sitting on the subway with a huge deceased dog on her lap.  With no other ideas, she decided to take a large dufflebag and put her dog in it and transport it that way.  <br>  She was getting off the subway, lugging this ridiculously heavy bag, when a man who was riding next to her asked what was in the bag.  She couldn't very well say it was her dead dog without sounding crazy, so she said "umm, electronics." The guy suddenly grabs the bag from her and takes off up the stairs of the subway and into the street.  She was stunned, and horrified that her dog had just been stolen, but then couldn't help but laugh. Boy was that guy gonna be surprised when he opened up her bag.<br>  <br>  It's one of the funniest stories I can think of...I hope it wasn't insensitive to you & I'm really sorry if it was.

cUpNNn4Saa	Hello,  I live in az . so, i don't know your area. But I think you could go to a public library , child day care, nursing homes, or even day labor job recruiter locations for offering your services. Then keep track of whom you talk to and If you help someone then get there information as well. It could be a note book full and keep track of the time you spend. That might be considered time teaching. ???????  Good luck  m. m. n az

OUvQQJAsaa	you're actually really fortunate to be going to a boarding school!  it will definitely help your future as long as you "buckle down" and get good grades.  many people who have problems early on are not so fortunate as to get a second chance, so take your future seriously!  I'm not trying to say that you're not, but education is really important if you want to have a good life when you're older.  you might not like boarding school and in fact a lot of the rules truly suck but once you make friends it won't be so bad.  good luck!

Type or cut and paste what you want the computer to say, then have computer read the French back to you over and over until you have everything memorized. It also comes with a French spell checker. The program is freeware but it doesn't not come with any French voices. There are French voices that can be bought from independent vendors for around $30. Capstral has some French voices for $30 and Acapella (I think that I have the names right) has some too. There is a link on the program's website to get some more voices and more information on how to use it. It is very easy to use. You can download the software at schoolfreeware.com
trKgx3Ukaa	Hi, <br>  <br>  I've had my foreign degree evaluated by ECE a few years back, so I'm a bit familiar with the process. <br>  <br>  It sounds to me that your degree is not equivalent to a Bachelor degree in Education in the USA because your studies are missing some vital courses for full equivalency. As to how many credits you are short of that degree will have to be decided by the college/university which offers degrees in education. <br>  <br>  So, all you can do is to submit an application to the college/university of your choice that offers degrees in education and see how many credits each of them will require you to complete, based on their policies and the ECE evaluation. <br>  <br>  Some will be more generous than others in this regard, so shop around as many colleges as you can, to find the one that will give you maximum credits toward the bachelor of education. <br>  <br>  There is no quick and easy way around this, unfortunately. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.

frs6QERFaa	The fact that you're asking for help tells me, you are serious about your classes. <br>  <br>  College at first, can be overwhelming. Especially with colleges pushing students to get through their programs as fast as possible. <br>  <br>  My advise to you is:<br>  <br>  1. Don't overwhelm yourself with too many classes. Being overwhelmed can kill anyone's enthusiam for college<br>  Twelve to fifteen credit hours is a good course load for beginning students. With adjusting to college and the additional study time for your courses, the lighter load is easier to manage.<br>  <br>  2. Balance your required courses with classes that interest you, even if they are outside of your major. This is a great time for you, enjoy it and take full advantage of it.<br>  <br>  For now ...<br>  <br>  A little time management is all you need. Set out your clothes the night before and keep your books by the door. Keep breakfast quick and portable-- say a bagel or a breakfast sandwich. Set your morning up so that its A, B, C out the door.<br>  <br>  If you commute to college, leave at least 45 to 30 minutes ahead if you drive or an hour if you take public transportation. This allows for slow drivers, delays, trips by the vending machine, and a pit stop at the restroom.<br>  <br>  If you live on campus, maybe riding a bike or taking the shuttle would be faster.  When you schedule your next semester/session classes, allow for at least 30 to 60 minutes between. <br>  <br>  In the future...<br>  <br>  Try to configure your classes so that the furthest one away is first, and the later ones are either close to that one or bring you closer to your room or parking spot or transportation.<br>  <br>  Try not to schedule more than two classes in a row. It's easier to concentrate on a few at a time. <br>  <br>  At lunch time, try to give yourself at least an hour not including commute time to your next class.|`|nbcY44vNaa	Going to sleep earlier can help you wake up earlier also.<br>  Buying and loud alarm clock will get you out of bed.|`|AA10958272	Drop out for a semester.<br>  <br>  Get a job. <br>  <br>  A real 9-to-5 or 8 hour work-day.

There is nothing cheeky about looking at someone with a smile, by the way.  If he does have any other interest in you, the things he said would be pretty immature, so I would ignore it.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure you understand what a teacher's pet is, since everything you describe is a clear example of that, yet you say you are not a teacher's pet.

But you have to remember that is only the ammount sold on that day. Overall 1/8 and 7/32 of the magazines have been sold which is equal to 11/32 (1/8 = 4/32).

S6q2wrvgaa	I'm assuming you know perpendicular means at a right angle to. The line you need to find is perpendicular to the line given by 5x+7y=4. <br>  First step is to find the gradient of this line. The general format for a line is given by y=mx + c where c is the yintercept (the point at which it crosses the y axis), y and x are your y and x values and m is your gradient. Rearange your equation into this format so you get 7y=-5x+4 then divide through by 7 to get a single y on the left side. You get y=-5/7x + 4/7. Since m= -5/7 this is your gradient. <br>  To find the gradient of the perpendicular line then you inverse the fraction by flipping it and changing the sign so you get 7/5. This is the gradient of YOUR line.<br>  Now you plug this into the formula y=mx+c so that you get y=7/5x +c. Plug in your x and y values (7,-2) so that you get -2=7/5(7)+c --> -2=49/5 +c  -->  10/5=49/5+c --> c=10/5 - 49/5 = -39/5<br>  <br>  Your equation is then y=7/5x -39/5<br>  Tidy it up by multiplying through by 5 so you get 5y=7x-39<br>  <br>  Hope that helped|`|WvIDTs4Paa	again,do your own homework.|`|s8QbZ0RLaa	When a line is perpendicular, it's slope is the negative reciprocal of the other equation.<br>  <br>  So first, put your equation in the slope intercept form: y = mx + b<br>  <br>  5x + 7y = 4 (subtract 5x)<br>  7y = -5x + 4 (divide by 7)<br>  y = -(5/7)x + (4/7)<br>  <br>  M is your slope, so the slope is -(5/7).<br>  Now take the negative reciprocal of that 7/5, plug that into the equation along with your points, and solve for b.<br>  <br>  -2 = (7/5)(7) + b (simplify)<br>  -2 = 49/5 + b (subtract 49/5)<br>  -11.8 or -59/5 = b<br>  <br>  Now plug in m and b into the equation and that will be your end result.<br>  <br>  y = 7/5x - 11.8 or y = 7/5x - 59/5 or y = (7x - 59)/5<br>  <br>  Edit: When bxlcharlie moved -49/5, she failed to change the sign, thus, her answer is incorrect.|`|ghbaAWOCaa	Well you know the lines perpendicular to the equation given right?,,,what do you know about lines perpenduicular to the other?..hopefully you know that the gradient will be the negative recipricol.

yjBVmwKWaa	I did mine about a blind man because you can really use so many descriptive techniques. This is mine:<br>  <br>  I could sense that familiar warmth within my chest. That anger I knew only too well, dispersing like an irrepressible disease. It possessed me, made me into something I couldn’t control. It was like a lightening bolt, waiting to strike me down at my weakest moment. I couldn’t help it. Insensative people like him compelled me into such an irate state. There was no stopping it. He was just another one of those indolent dog walkers that couldn’t even conjure up the effort to clean up after their own mutt. Usually I would turn a blind eye to this sort of thing, but surely he could see there were ingenuous children in this park as well? The consequences of his inconsiderate actions could be fatal for those little ones. <br>  <br>  Their naive laughs rang in my head, encouraging me to sort this situation out. Initially, I hesitated but the rage inside me was strong. To strong to simply ignore. I began approaching the concealed man who I was yet to identify. But I was stopped instantaneously by my own arrogance. How had I not seen this before?<br>  <br>  I had originally stereotyped him to be another one of those lazy youths, which overpowered the obvious signs that I had so pretentiously overlooked. Those dark blue genes buried his awkward walk. His slim, flat trainers that attempted to support his loose ankles but let through the occasional stumble! The luminous blue top with the Superman logo branded across the front was no match for his violent flinching at any unfamiliar sound. Furthermore, I had failed to notice that his innocent golden retriever, of which I had wrongly accused, was his life line. He was this man’s light in the dark, not his partner in crime! That dog was merely directing him through his life.<br>  <br>  A guide dog.<br>  <br>  I can’t imagine not being able to see the flourishing colours which show off their magnificence. They fill this black and white world with tone and texture. The thick leaves belonging to the autumn trees cover the pale blue sky. Areas of this heavenly blueness that are not covered by these tall giants, fades towards a peachy pitch above the horizon. The chocolate brown tree trunks which support this image fight against the competitive wind, which howls through its failure as it disappears. The warm sun gloats its victory with a ray of light blasted through the clouds broad wall. I had neglected my surroundings of which was natures beauty. It was only at this moment in time that I had realised this.<br>  <br>  To compensate for the many years of disregard that I had shown, I closed my eyes and put myself in this mans position. The little children’s expressive amusement was far greater than before. More intense. More joyful. More fulfilling for my ears. As was the sparrows cheerful cheep that sang to the world and anyone who chose to listen. I also heard the sweet fragrance from the carpet of buttercups of which surrounded me. Beckoning me to admire their delicate scent. Accepting their invitation I inhaled everything they had to offer. Accompanying this enticing smell was the breezy taste of the summer’s air and the moisture that it contained, mixed with that unique flavour of the freshly cut grass. <br>  <br>  As I felt the heat on my own lips as a consequence of my heavy breathing, I heard lumbering footsteps echoing through out the park. The dishevelled trainers’ chaos fumbled towards me and a wave of fear darted through my body. The alcoholic odour originating from the clumsy intruder overwhelmed every pleasant aroma that had previously encircled me. In an attempt to get out the way of the unidentified inebriated individual, I shifted my weight thus moving myself back a step. Consequently causing the content of my pocket to alter its position creating a choir of resonance. This concluded the recognizable jingle of my house keys clashing with my mobile phone. It never occurred to me, to separate the two objects to avoid any more damage!<br>  <br>  The monotonous hum of distant conversations regrettably brought my mind back into the harsh world of reality. I was viciously struck by a resilient beam of luminosity as my eyes immerged from their day dream. Mercilessly stinging my naive eyes. Deserted with just the mere memory of everything that I had just experienced as company. All my senses returned to their simple self and I had time to reminisce over those last few invigorating seconds! I was forced to broaden my appreciation of the smaller things in life. Like the gentle wind that caressed my face, up lifting every fresh scent that Mother Nature had fabricated. The curious leaves which whirled around my ankles, intermittently brushing the sensitive hairs on my susceptible legs. The effortless beat of my heart, pulsated through my chest. <br>  These impressions had always existed but had continuously been subdued by my own ignorance but now with my greater understand of this envirnment I had a new lease on life and took i|`|lmhqZtE4aa	it' good if you can do like entering a nightmare world but not the type with monsters more about the imagination playing tricks on you. <br>  walking home from a friends house late at night...you think you hear someone following you...you twist around through alleys rushing to get home... get lost...black out<br>  dunno sumfing like that if you use loads of descriptive techniques can be fab.|`|b7iJHGY5aa	Write about something that is going to be the most interesting for you to write about, because you have more of a chance of writing more that way and getting a better grade.|`|h1KQvDlsaa	Haha I did this a few months back.<br>  Wrote a sad story about a boy who got bullied<br>  and got a B :D<br>  Somehow I think it touched my teacher's heart.<br>  I named him after Harry Potter.<br>  So i suppose you could do something like that..|`|VEgv5NhSaa	Write a horror story you know, the ones that are set in a haunted house with an evil lady :)<br>  <br>  <br>  x|`|vJa7abGfaa	a story about a girl or boy who has to go to boarding school because of something...and first that person doesn't want to and is not happy but later on she/he is happy...

The particular features will be dependent on the company and the brand and how they wish to convey that message and to what demographic it is aimed at.

Vmt7ylcuaa	Bongo drums or bongos are a Latin-American percussion instrument consisting of a pair of single-headed, open-ended drums attached to each other. The drums are of different size: the larger drum is called in Spanish the hembra (female) and the smaller the macho (male). It is most often played by hand and is especially associated in Cuban music with a steady patter or ostinato of eighth-notes known as the martillo or "hammer".[1]<br>  <br>  <br>  Some of the first recordings of bongos can be heard performed by the groups Sexteto Habanero and Septeto Nacional. They have become a popular instrument among soundtrack writers for movies and television.<br>  <br>  <br>  The name may have evolved from the Abakua drum trio 'Bonko' and its lead drum 'Bonko Enmiwewos'.<br>  <br>  <br>  you can have mp3 example for bongos playing:<br>  <a href="http://www.bongomania.com/eng/articles/thebasics3.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bongomania.com/eng/articles/t...</a><br>  <br>  bongos photos :<br>  <a href="http://www.bongomania.com/eng/gallery/mybongos.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bongomania.com/eng/gallery/my...</a><br>  <br>  examples of bongos composition recording, hope answering your question 1) and 2)<br>  <a href="http://www.bongomania.com/eng/recordings.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bongomania.com/eng/recordings...</a><br>  <br>  Mari ber-bongo ria.....! Let's play bongos, Amigos.........|`|uegmmnOpaa	History<br>  Many people think of the bongos as a toy or novelty item, but they have a rich cultural history. Bongos were developed in eastern Cuba in the Guantanamo province in the late 1800s, and are the principle drums of the music styles known as changüi and son (pronounced "sone"). These styles are a blend of the rich African and Spanish cultures of Cuba and contain the roots of modern salsa.<br>  <br>  In the '40s and '50s, the bongos emerged as the guiding sound for the beat generation. During this period famous bongo drummers gained commercial success, as evidenced by Jack Costanzo ("Mr. Bongo"), who accompanied the Nat King Cole Trio. I'm sure many of you recall having your parents buy a set of bongos because of their reasonable price and suitability for small hands.

Then i was very relived because i would know alot of people and wouldnt have to make new friends again...... <br>  so when i started 9th it was like any other school year... very fun!!! <br>  and hot boys to flirt with... also cute outfits for school......|`|1Nw82pQuaa	Horrible, and continues to be horrible after years there.<br>  <br>  It's not something to look forward to.|`|4712f79c3b66a688114af1fc7e707671aa	I remember, ONE first day of school out of the many I've had lol. <br>  It was probably the best, and I made quite a few great friends then.<br>  I remember it because the first day in band one of my, now best friends, walked up to me and introduced herself right away. <br>  And yeah, I talked to everyone lol, I was a little social butterfly that year, but yes, I was nervous. I think we all are on our first day. XD|`|fkqPs9QRaa	it wasnt too bad.  I found out i had one or two crapp y teachers, and it was kinda depressing that i knew that we had to go through a whole nother year of school.  I was a little nervous, but i had soem friends in my classes, so that made it a little easier.|`|iO08zbtDaa	I talked to people I knew from middle school.

(:|`|acvRjD6Raa	Horrible, all my friends got new friends and i was all alone in a new place.

OH yeah i go to and all girls school and it was weird to she lebos interact with each other and also bisexuals.it  was weird because at lunch i sat with my friends but we didn't really Talk because we were overwhelmed about how fast the day was moving|`|OyAD7LXKaa	I started high school last year, im in year eight this year. I wasn't overly scared, a bit nervous, it didn't help that my neighbour who i Absolutely hated, and was one of my best friend's friend As well was starting and turned up to be in my homeroom (no longer friends with that person), we all met in the Central part of the school (quadrangle) after each class,  our next teacher would take us to our next class (this is so we could learn where our classes were), i didn't have anyone from my primary school in my homeroom (house) so that made it hard, I actually lost my lock to my locker on the first day As well, we had just got them and I was going down to put it on my locker, and i had lost it. But otherwise, it was alright.|`|YNOySbxFaa	Well.. I Was Nervous :P I Skipped My First Day Of HighSchool :x ...<br>  I Went The Next Day And It Was. Kinda Stupid. We Just Started Forming Our Social Groups And Placing Ppl In Our Own Groups *Of The Mind* Like The Nerds, The Preps, Gangsters, Jocks, Mean Kids, Emo's, And Just Kinda Observed All Day. Ohh Ohh!

It was just another day of school.|`|ftvCLy6Raa	it was terrible, i sat by myself at lunch.|`|H5qJPekAaa	I was nervous when I was on my way going there. But then I got comfortable once I got to class. By the time the third day came I was comfortable and met new people and now I am even good friends with some of them. You meet new people and you go outside of your comfort zone. Which helped me to care less of what people think and to be more opened to people. I remember this girl said hi to me out of the blue and she was like hi im maddie. And I was like oh hi im christina. And then we started a conversation. But I haven't talked to her since then but she was really nice. I also had this girl in my class who I thought was rich and snobby. But then I got to know her and she is really nice and now we are best friends. She is rich but she is defiantly not a rich *****. lol.|`|6874b4a9b2e07ebd35f4e979f869b2d4aa	It was great, the computers had crashed and they didn't have the student schedules so we spent the  day just hanging out.
Q4Hz8uWCaa	College and dorm life are FUN! They're are days where you miss home but not that much! I'd just suggest really studying and preparing for tests and doing essays way early. Don't wait until the last minute to do those things. As far as the dorms, bring a tub mat (to use in the showers... they're nasty!), your own handsoap (the schools wont be that worthy!), cleaning supplies for the showers and room, refrigerator, microwave, things to decorate your room (pics, wallpaper... the rooms are boring and ugly), a full down mirror (gotta be fly for all the parties!), a iron and board, don't bring all of your clothes... only bring like one seasons clothes because closet space isnt that much and change out each season. And be very social! Don't be afraid to talk. I loved when new people talked ot me and didnt even know me. That's how you make lots of friends! Have FUN!|`|9e11df00019ad57ae83fd8ebfdfbc709aa	The TRUTH about college is this.............<br>  <br>  first time living on your own, time to meet new people, try new things out, possibly even get a new identity.........just don't forget that someone is paying thousands and thousands of dollars for you to be there.<br>  <br>  So STUDY!!!  Don't take early classes if you can't make it to them, don't overload yourself with classes and spread yourself too thin.  Take notes or bring a tape recorder.<br>  <br>  Bring some nice curtains and bedding to make your room feel cozy, you can buy a tiny fridge for fifty bucks at Target which will come in very handy when you're studying at midnight and starving.  Get a campus map and a credit card for the bookstore!

2646a4e9d6d4e936660d70ff922397f3aa	Normally I would need to know a lot more about you, your interests, and what kind of a school in order to be able to answer that, but given your choices, I would have to say that without a doubt, USC is the best of these by far.  That would probably be followed by UC Riverside (although if you could get into USC, you would be eligible for much better UCs), then Chapman, then Pepperdine, and finally the University of Redlands.  That would cover academics and professors.  Now, in terms of the other things you mention:<br>  <br>  In terms of campus and area, Pepperdine is one of the nicest in the country (but you should know that it is a very religious school, so that would have to appeal to you), followed by Chapman.  I've never been on the Redlands campus, so I can't judge it.  USC has a lovely campus, but is in a very bad area, and Riverside is not in the greatest of locations, in my view.<br>  <br>  In terms of cost, the least expensive would be UC Riverside, which is a public university.  Then would be the University of Redlands, followed by Chapman, then Pepperdine, and the most expensive is USC.  <br>  <br>  In terms of admissions, the hardest to get into is USC (22% of applicants), followed by Pepperdine, then Chapman, then Redlands, and finally UC Riverside (79% of applicants).|`|6AqG70Caaa	University of Southern California is very prestigious and highly ranked in the league table.

For Germany, there is the Congress-Bundestag Youth Exchange program which is entirely paid for by a scholarship and is an excellent program. This program is administered by various international exchange program organizations with AFS Intercultural being the biggest. Exchange programs can be up to 9000 dollars for a year program, but there are many scholarship and fundraising opportunities.<br>  Your friend could definitely be an exchange student at the same time to Germany, but you will definitely not be together in the same host family, much less the same town or even general area. So you probably won't be hanging out with your friend a lot, but then again, that is not the point of going on an exchange program. The point is to immerse yourself in a different culture, language, and people. It would actually be a disappointing experience if you just went to Germany and hung out with your old friend the whole time. It would take away from the experience. <br>  I say all of this from experience as a current exchange student to Belgium.

79781fb18809aa12f2e083700c0eafc5aa	It sounds to me like your son is not receiving a FAPE (Free and Appropriate Public Education).  IDEA states:  "The purposes of this title are to ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education that emphasizes special education and related services designed to meet their unique needs and prepare them for further education, employment and independent living."  (IDEA, Section 1400(d)(1)(A)).  This means the school district must teach your son how to make friends, how to tie his shoes, how to do math, how to write a sentence and how to wipe his butt.  <br>  <br>  Have you been tape recording your IEP meetings?  Depending on your state, all that is required is a 24 hour notice to do so.  Everything should be done in writing from here on out.  If someone calls you, let it go to voice mail and respond via email.  If you accidentally pick up the phone, follow up with an email like this:  "This is to document the telephone converstaion we had today where you said blah, blah, blah and I said blah, blah, blah."<br>  <br>  I hope to goodness that you have it in writing or on tape that they are not allowing your son to be fully-included in general ed because of his behaivors.  This is called DISCRIMINATION.  He has behaviors because he has AUTISM.  This is like telling a child in a wheelchair that if they can't run the mile, they are going to get detention.  I would seriously consider, or at least threaten, to file a complaint with the US Department of Education Office for Civil Rights.  Here's the link to the complaint form:  <a href="http://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/complaintintro.html." rel="nofollow">http://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr...</a>  I would not file yet, until you can get something in writing or on tape about him not being allowed to be in regular classrooms due to his behavior.<br>  <br>  Additionally, under IDEA, children with disabilities that have behaviors MUST have a Functional Analysis Assessment (FBA) performed and a Behavior Intervention Plan (BIP) developed.  If they have not done this and he has had behaviors for quite some time, this is a denial of FAPE.<br>  <br>  Your school district is not addressing his clear lack of Theory of Mind.  I would IMMEDIATELY request a Theory of Mind assessment.  He also needs a social skills assessment as well as a pragmatics speech assessment.  Your son has deficits the District is ignoring.  Instead they seem to be passing him from grade to grade.  They are REQUIRED BY IDEA to teach him social skills including Theory of Mind.<br>  <br>  Did you know that the school district cannot make any changes to your son's IEP without your informed signature consent?  This includes changing campuses is the SC classroom changes campuses.  This means that you can check the "no" box on his IEP that you do not agree to it and the District will have two options:  1) hold another IEP to discuss the disagreement and try to reach consensus on the issues or 2) file for due process.  I agree with another answerer:  start seeking an attorney or a GOOD advocate.  If you contact me and let me know your location, I can help you with this.<br>  <br>  Although I rarely agree with retention, I firmly believe parents know their children best.  But I also know that the school district probably has not assessed in all areas of suspected disability and certainly are not addressing all areas of need.<br>  <br>  As far as retention, I would suggest writing an email like this:<br>  "Dear Special Ed Director,<br>  <br>  My son is not receiving a FAPE.  He has not been assessed in all areas of suspected disabiltiy.  My son clearly lacks Theory of Mind and social skills.  My son is entitled to be educated in the Least Restrictive Environment (LRE) and this right is being violated.  We have been told his IEP is not being fully implemented in two key areas.  First, my son has a full-time aide.  Yet his aide is serving as an itinerant aide and is acting as a classroom aide rather than my son's one-to-one aide.  Second, my son is not receiving his inclusion time as set forth in his IEP due to his behaviors.  Yet the District has never offered an FBA which is required under IDEA.  Additionally, my son needs an aide who is trained in behavior intervention so that she may implement the BIP that is developed from the FBA.  The aide also needs to be trained in fostering friendships between my son and his same-age peers and working with my son to reduce his socially-stigmatizing behaviors.<br>  <br>  Please consider this my formal request for a Functional Behavioral Analysis including taking Antecedent/Behavior/Consequence date and developing a Behavior Intervention Plan, a Theory of Mind assessment and a Social Skills assessment.  I look forward to receiving an assessment plan within the next 15 days.<br>  <br>  Additionally, please be advised that I will not be signing any IEP that calls for my son to advance to the 7th grade.  Becuase his areas of need have not been addressed, my son needs the next year to be taught Theory of Mind, social skills and behavior modification so that he may receiv|`|294db1e52bf0162d7d7ff79b4102975faa	I think that I would argue in favor of a self contained class. In other words, go ahead and send him to middle school, but argue about his placement there. if he is in a self contained classroom, there will be other students there who are his same age and same abilities. I do not believe in retention after 3rd grade. I do not believe in retention for Special needs students. It is all about the placement and not what grade it is.|`|PnlgLBcwaa	Retention is an IEP issue under certaiin circumsatnces--does his IEP refelct a grade--or is he listed as ungraded.<br>  <br>  if he has met the goals of his current IEP--than he shoudl be promoted<br>  if he hasn't met the goals of his IEP tahn you shoudl consider retaining..<br>  <br>  is the next IEP being written now--or will the current one continue throguh June?<br>  <br>  If you are writing a new IEp--than you need to include goals that would be appropriately met in his current school|`|ORonhAuvaa	Retention is not an IEP issue. This is a school decision. <br>  <br>  It really depends on what kind of program he is going to go into in middle school. If they plan to give him support, then it seems as though middle school would be better for his self-esteem. Retention doesn't really work very well because of the ramifications of being way behind ones age mates. <br>  <br>  What does your son think?|`|3bahzW9Uaa	I'm with Miss Behavior on this one.  I have a daughter who has autism.  She'll be in 6th grade next year. The thought of her going to Jr High in 2 years scares me because she's very much like your son, but I want to keep her with her school peer group.  She doesn't have friends who come over or invite her places, but she is well accepted at school among her peers. Many are protective of her and appreciate her unique gifts<br>  <br>  Questions for you.  What type of placement is your son currently in? What supports does his IEP provide?    What do you think holding him back a year in 6th grade will do?  Do you think he'll make gains there that he won't make in Jr high?   Finally, as Miss B asked, What does your son think?  <br>  <br>  The way I see it, holding him back is probably a disservice.  I know my daughter will never master grade level science or social studies, and in the big picture, that won't matter. Her language comprehension is picking up, but one more year in elementary school won't  catch her up to her peers.  I know she would be devistated if she stayed at the elementary while everyone moved on. She's plenty aware that "all 6th graders go to science camp, and next year they go to Jr high."     The thought of transitioning to Jr high is something I've been putting off till next year to deal with.  I really do dread it, but at the same time, I know she's going to love being able to take home economics.  She'll absolutely shine in that class.|`|769068c691176f6c9fe4154f357e813caa	I have been there and on one occasion, it took walking in with an attorney to win the argument.  I never had to file a lawsuit but the real threat of it ended everything.  <br>  <br>  Whatever you do, quit working with those at the school level right now.  Call in the heavy weights from the district.  You want the PhD's on staff who are responsible for special education at all the schools in your district.  Start by saying you need his/her help.  Don't mention attorney, but be ready with one waiting in the wings.  Your son has until age 21 to complete high school (not 18 like 'normal' students) so there is no reason to rush him through.  One argument could be that the transition to a new school at this time would be detrimental, but you will need a MD to back that up in writing (I got my sons pediatrician to write a letter without any problems).  Make sure they know you do want him to progress to junior high, just not this year.  Spell out the changes - no more recess, changing classrooms multiple times a day, too many kids in cafeteria, too many busses, etc.  Have everything lined out with medical opinions in writing so that the staff cannot argue.  They cannot go against what medical professionals say he needs "due to his autism."  The wording is very important for legal reasons on their end and will make or break your request.  <br>  <br>  Feel free to email me if you'd like to talk.  I have done exactly what you are trying to achieve for my son and won.  You can too.|`|yPLS0FeWaa	I suggest getting an advocate or a special eduaction lawyer to help with the meeting and request your son be there as well so they understand his point of view. You have every right to fight for his educational placement. This comes from the US dept. guide to the IEP <a href="http://www.ed.gov/parents/needs/speced/iepguide/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ed.gov/parents/needs/speced/i...</a> about what to do if the parents don't agree with his IEP which would include his educational placement.<br>  "There are times when parents may not agree with the school's recommendations about their child's education. Under the law, parents have the right to challenge decisions about their child's eligibility, evaluation, placement, and the services that the school provides to the child. If parents disagree with the school's actions-or refusal to take action-in these matters, they have the right to pursue a number of options. They may do the following:<br>  Try to reach an agreement. Parents can talk with school officials about their concerns and try to reach an agreement. Sometimes the agreement can be temporary. For example, the parents and school can agree to try a plan of instruction or a placement for a certain period of time and see how the student does. <br>  Ask for mediation. During mediation, the parents and school sit down with someone who is not involved in the disagreement and try to reach an agreement. The school may offer mediation, if it is available as an option for resolving disputes prior to due process. <br>  Ask for due process. During a due process hearing, the parents and school personnel appear before an impartial hearing officer and present their sides of the story. The hearing officer decides how to solve the problem. (Note: Mediation must be available at least at the time a due process hearing is requested.) <br>  File a complaint with the state education agency. To file a complaint, generally parents write directly to the SEA and say what part of IDEA they believe the school has violated. The agency must resolve the complaint within 60 calendar days. An extension of that time limit is permitted only if exceptional circumstances exist with respect to the complaint." <br>  <br>  If you do not agree with the school's decision you can follow the steps in the procedural safegaurds which by law you should of received a copy of which covers what I copy/pasted above. If you did not, you can find them at: <a href="http://idea.ed.gov/explore/view/p/%2Croot%2Cdynamic%2CTopicalArea%2C12%2C" rel="nofollow">http://idea.ed.gov/explore/view/p/%2Croo...</a> &<br>  <a href="http://idea.ed.gov/explore/view/p/%2Croot%2Cstatute%2CI%2CB%2C615%2C" rel="nofollow">http://idea.ed.gov/explore/view/p/%2Croo...</a><br>   If they blame his behavior as to why he gets little inclusion that should be addressed in his IEP...behavior issues are supposed to be addressed and how they will be dealt with in a positive and effective way. As an example, consider a child whose behavior interferes with learning. The IEP team would need to consider positive and effective ways to address that behavior. The team would discuss positive behavioral interventions, strategies, and supports that the child needs in order to learn how to control or manage his or her behavior which must be stated in their IEP. <br>  I also suggest visiting Wright's Law <a href="http://www.wrightslaw.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.wrightslaw.com</a> they cover you and your child's rights, how to be an effective advocate for your child and more.

kvLWTTlhaa	Telling us WHICH school you're attending makes a world of difference, darling =]<br>  <br>  ____<br>  <br>  Ah - you'll have a blast at St. Paul's !  My best friend went there (I was an Exonian), but she's raved about it ever since.  Every single first-year student is petrified on the first day, so don't worry about that.  Unless that person reveals it, nobody will know that he/she is on financial aid.  Kids at St. Paul's tend not to care about clothing as much as students at Exeter do, so really, don't sweat it.  And honestly, I doubt you'll make any enemies your first day =]<br>  <br>  The campus is very pretty, and even though it's in Concord (not exactly the world's most exciting city), you'll have a wonderful time.
IWSc7xkiaa	I think it is a healthy combination of both. I have many students who work hard and excel in class, but you cannot joke around with them or even make chit-chat. It's like they have the personality of a rock. I appreciate their efforts to achieve in my class, but they are usually ones that I forget after they have moved on to another semester.<br>  <br>  I also have students who have great personalities, but refuse to apply themselves. Although they are very likable, they are also frustrating which makes them lose a little of my respect.<br>  <br>  I typically enjoy my students who are willing to work hard enough to pass the class, and are open enough to show their great personalities. That is sort of a win-win.|`|RXmWudcsaa	Both... Each student is different. It may be a personality, grades or how they help in the class, how quiet they are, how shy they are, etc...it depends.|`|Mdk7DmiAaa	All teachers have favorites,because  that is human nature. Yet a good teacher should be professional enough to never let anyone know who the 'pets' are.|`|YNOySbxFaa	Its Defenitly Their Personality.. <br>  Not To Brag, But I Have A Really Good personality, tht everyone loves being around [:<br>  and i was teachers pets a couple years =]<br>  AND I SUCK AT SKEWL! so its not success in class xD|`|OmQ4jtaIaa	Personality personality...all the way!!!!!!|`|294db1e52bf0162d7d7ff79b4102975faa	I don't favor any of my students. But, I admire students that work hard. It could be students that work hard and are doing very well grade-wise, or it could be a student who is struggling but still works very hard.
IWSc7xkiaa	Yes, I think most teachers who have a heart do. I still expect these students to make an effort and earn their grades, but I may give them an extra day to complete an assignment or allow them to re-test if it was obvious that there mind was elsewhere during an exam. Also, I may not ride them like the typical student who is sleeping in class or gazing off out of apathy. I don't, however, just give them a grade. I care for all of my students, and don't think it is fair just to pass a student (without him/her doing any real work independently) just because that student has "baggage." I am completely willing to work with them if they are willing to meet me half way.|`|FmYkUfIDaa	Hi Courtney,<br>  Yes! Over many years of teaching adults (25-62) I became aware of students who were suffering the loss of family members - a time of grief for many of them and naturally, people are not able to be fully functional when this situation is present. <br>  <br>  Any good teacher will make allowances and excuse students from various tasks.<br>  <br>  Teachers cannot be all things to all people, so I was fortunate to have a mentor who suggested that early in my career I compile a list of professional helpers. I kept an index of these and so was able to refer students to professional help when needed.<br>  <br>  Example: Grief counseling. Women's refuge contact. Suicide intervention. Relationships counseling. <br>  <br>  This index was built up over many years and was a great time-saver in emergencies.<br>  <br>  There is a lovely quotation about caring about others and from memory it goes like this: <br>  <br>  "Being present and available to another human being is the infallible sign of love and caring."|`|294db1e52bf0162d7d7ff79b4102975faa	Grade-wise I can't.

If you didn't pay for Spring term classes then you will owe them some money. You will want to look on your old school's website to see what their policy is for dropping classes or canceling enrollment. Some schools give you back a portion of your money if you drop your classes before a set date. Unfortunately, this kind of stuff is really different from school to school. If you can't find the info, you will definitely want to go to the financial aid or accounts receivable office...it can be a hassle, but they should be upfront and tell you what you owe, if anything.

uegmmnOpaa	To put all your eggs in one basket, is to take a huge chance on one thing and hoping everything goes fine.  Say you have 5 chickens and they each lay ten eggs a day.  If you go out tomorrow and but all 50 eggs in one basket, you better hope that basket doesn't break.  If it does your out fifty eggs and you don't get breakfast.  However if you have 2 baskets and put 25 eggs in each, even if one basket breaks you are still okay.  Don't put all your eggs in one basket is a warning not to take too big a risk, without a good back up plan.|`|7d3edabfdc27c4ba2c6cd571f70d965daa	I'm not going to do it for you, but putting all your eggs in one basket means putting everything you have into one opportunity or chance.

An egg is only partial of a chicken's work effort since it only has to give up a small part of itself. Now ham requires the pig to give all of its potential into making it- since the pig has to give up every bit of itself to become ham. Now, if you are talking about fried chicken, then yes, the chicken is committed rather than just being involved.|`|mTqkcTtWaa	chicken is involved by laying the eggs and the pig is committed because it gave its life<br>  <br>  even though pigs dont decide whether or not they die so we can eat them....im sure if they could decide they wouldn't but who knows lol|`|32b5862608cd641eff2b289e3a95ca58aa	Seals hit the nail right on the head.

AULA1cvtaa	i cant tell you about the others, but UCIs freshman dorms are pretty big if you can get into mesa court (middle earth has smaller rooms and they are closer together). The only problem about the hall is that there are 4 study rooms in the hall that they ended up coverting to rooms. The study rooms were almost 1/2 the size of the other rooms. 8 people, myself included, got unlucky and got a converted study room. Other than that, the rest of the rooms were really nice. There were 8 suites in my hall with 70 or so people, so the odds are in your favor of getting one of the bigger rooms.<br>  <br>  My bro goes to ucsd, and i heard that the rooms are average-small, though i cant say for sure.|`|HJbqA4hkaa	Darlin, the dorm room size should not even be a consideration, hopefully you'll never be there.

ZRG7wEf9aa	You shold take every science and human biology class that is offered. In high school you want to be in AP classes in every area you can.  Especially in areas of communication.  Getting into Medical School is all about selling yourself as a package. A well prepared package.  I'd start volunteering at a hospital, preferably in the ER so you can learn something.  Call your local Boy Scouts and ask if they have an EMT Paramedic Explorer Scout program.  If they do, join it and spend your weekends in uniform running emergency calls.  Get CPR certified from the American Heart Association.  <br>  Don't waste your brain power thinking about what type of doctor you want to be.  You'll change your mind 30 times between now and then.  My  final bit of advice.  Tell no one that you want to be a doctor. Only one person from my high school class went on to be a physician, but plenty said they were going to.

kvLWTTlhaa	This type of question is completely dependent on the individual schools =]|`|Mx07dTipaa	it depends. if i had the choice to go to private school, i would've took it within a heart-beat. but, its just that my parents would rather use the money for college. private schools actually do give a better education. many students in the ivy league schools matriculated from either private schools, or competitive suburban high schools. and since your parents have the money, i'd say give it a try. in private school, the class size is much smaller, better and easier access to guidance counselors and college counselors (which is a plus), facilities are likely to be better than public schools, and curriculum is more rigorous.  you care about education? do whats best for you, and since you want to go to private school, go ahead. now, i never said that public schools are bad, but in this situation, private school is the better option. good luck =)|`|REhOdbAFaa	okay so far i went to both private and public i got to say that u should stay at public school cause 1st private schools don't teach that good and people at colleges don't care what type of school u go to as long as u r smart.|`|nB3JH2Wjaa	Obviously Kalie or whatever her name is went to a poor private school.<br>  The average private school beats the average public school hands down.

smV6u3aeaa	Try:<br>  <br>  With a clear agenda from politicians and consumers regarding climate change, large companies are starting to try to understand not only the risks, but also the opportunities of a carbon-constrained world.<br>  <br>  Agenda works because it can mean a list of problems needing to be addressed. Firm doesn't work as well, so I changed it to "clear".  "Try and understand" is incorrect grammar. Risks and opportunities are such opposite words, so I made their relationship a bit clearer.  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I hope that helps!|`|AA11887983	I don't think that agenda is the word that you want.

OTvSnO7naa	It's fine, however "expose" might be a better option.|`|vV1hPhfWaa	yea, it works.  *create* sounds better though, in my opinion.
o3Jpfflgaa	Without being familiar with the UNGC and what they do, I'd still have to say no.  Using on as an adverb in this situation just doesn't work.<br>  <br>  You could say "for not reporting on their progress" or "for not communicating their progress".|`|k2Jbp9e6aa	I think not, because I don't know what "progress" means in this context.
smV6u3aeaa	Yes, for "children's toys", no for "have".  I would either use "have had" or "were having."  I think "have had" is best.<br>  <br>  "Have had" implies that the companies had this trouble in the general past and may still be having this trouble.  "Were having" implies that this was an ongoing problem in the past and doesn't continue to today. <br>  <br>  Also, it is one VERY long sentence! Consider breaking it up into two or more sentences. Avoid the passive voice whenever possible as well. (I know this is hard to do when attempting to write "objectively". <br>  <br>  You could try:<br>  <br>  This was evident in 2007 when Mattel recalled twenty million children’s toys contaminated with lead, and pet food makers recalled sixty million tins of tainted food. Both recalls were a result of lapses in quality control in Chinese factories, which brought to light the difficulties such companies have had in ensuring their expectations are met. <br>  <br>  I changed the numbers to words simply because it is stylistic rule to write out numbers whenever possible.|`|OTvSnO7naa	Yes, both are fine.  However are you sure you mean to use the word "expectations"?  Consider using requirements instead.|`|vV1hPhfWaa	Yes, actually that works fine.  However, I would change a small portion of it:<br>  <br>  . . . brought to light the difficulties companies [face while] ensuring their expectations are met.|`|t4zobY3Haa	Yes I think they are both Ok, though something seems odd about have for some reason.  Not sure what it is.
xTWNkwdTaa	Maybe because you've been a passive student. Meaning that you just write information from class instead of finding ways to apply your knowledge. For example, you take astronomy and have all these great notes....but you never went outside to look at the stars and see if what the teacher says is actually true. Maybe you're a hands-on learner. You need to actually do things yourself to learn, and being in a class taking notes doesn't help. You can totally be successful in anything. You just need to find the best way for you to study and learn. Try finding a quiet place to study where nobody can distract you. If this doesn't work for you then maybe you should be checked for ADD (attention deficit disorder) That is a problem that prevents a lot of good students from actually learning. Hope this helps!

vV1hPhfWaa	It’s a sailor’s expression, from the days of sailing ships.  We ignorant landlubbers might think that a sheet is a sail, but it’s actually a rope (always called a line in sailing terminology), or sometimes on really big ships a chain, which is attached to the bottom corner of a sail. The word actually comes from an Old English term for the corner of a sail. The sheets were as vital in the days of three-masted square-rigged sea-going ships as they are today, since they trim the sail to the wind. If they run loose, the sail flutters about in the wind and the ship wallows off its course out of control.<br>  <br>  Extend this idea to sailors on shore leave, staggering back to the ship after a good night on the town, well tanked up. The irregular and uncertain locomotion of these jolly tars must have reminded onlookers of the way a ship moved in which the sheets were loose. Perhaps one loose sheet might not have been enough to get the image across, so the speakers borrowed the idea of a three-masted sailing ship with three sheets loose, so the saying became three sheets in the wind.|`|WvIDTs4Paa	probably from sailing.

There are a million of diseases out there that are scary, but I'm 99% sure that the US is free from many other diseases that exist in other parts of the world. I think you should try to consider thinking about the positive side of things! Think of how you're able to do so many things that some people cannot... Breathing on your own, being able to use your hands to type this question, being able to communicate, recognizing that there might be something wrong, etc etc. <br>  <br>  Of course a lot of the ads on TV almost make it sound that everyone is susceptible to being depressed. I mean, we ALL have our down days when we shut ourselves from the world and need time alone... remember, they're ADVERTISEMENTS! Their purpose is to try to convince you to get their drug and sadly sometimes it makes you doubt and wonder about your own sanity. Don't pay attention to those! If you constantly pay attention and worrying, you WILL get yourself sick. Constantly worrying is destructive to your health! Just pay more attention with staying healthy (eating right, exercising, spending time with family/friends, finding a hobby, finding things that make you happy!)<br>  <br>  Think positive! Remain on the brighter side of things. Everyone loves a sunny day. Find something to believe in and stick with it. There are millions of things, billions of things in life you can be skeptical about, but you have to keep yourself grounded! Good luck. Sorry for the long answer!

slEO0c5Caa	I don't know the particulars for NY State, but generally, you'll need state certification to teach at a public school.  You can usually teach at private schools with an MA in Lit, but not at public schools.  <br>  <br>  In terms of the long road, teaching Lit at the college level is tough.  With an MA in Lit, you could find adjunct (part-time, pay-per-class) work as needed here and there (not much security of employment) and possibly full time employment at a community college (where teaching loads are usually 5 classes/term).  Full-time tenure-track jobs at colleges/universities almost always (not just the fancier schools, but almost all of them) require a PhD.<br>  <br>  Good luck!
AA10556677	Don't bother. You WILL be ignored, because you have nothing to say to them other than "hi, I'm ___ and get good grades and like your school." I'm not trying to be a jerk, just telling you that they don't care. You could go to their website and get on a mailing list for information, but you're not going to get to contact an admissions officer or anything. You'll probably get an automated reply telling you to schedule a visit, which isn't a bad idea, but you don't need to email them to do that.<br>  <br>  If you want to demonstrate to them that you're interested, you could look into summer classes or camps.

My current school could keep you in their system, but my last one had no way of dealing with anyone who had not yet reached junior year.  It used to drive me crazy; I would get the name of a terrific potential student, and they would just say, "Sorry, if s/he isn't a junior, we have no way of putting her/him into the system".

aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	I think that all children would benefit greatly from homeschooling, but there is not one choice that is "better" than the other.  Homeschooling is the best, and in our opinion the only, option for MY family.  That does not mean that it is the best option for others, though-they might not have the dedication it takes, they might HAVE to work.  For those families, homeschooling might not be the best option.<br>  <br>  I would not let my children homeschool themselves-it is important for parents to be involved in their children's education, no matter how they are educated.  They can do a lot of self directed learning and they can certainly do a lot of the work themselves with oversight if they are the type that is self motivated (my 11 year old daughter is, my 8 year old son is not).<br>  <br>  Yes, I think that it will benefit them as far as college goes.  Statistically, more homeschoolers go to college than their public and private schooled counterparts, and the homeschoolers are more likely to graduate college.  Many colleges actively recruit homeschoolers because they easily matriculate, as their prior education is closer to that which occurs at college (public school is not-in fact, public school is similar to no aspect of the "real world").<br>  <br>  I have not read the other answers yet, but I can tell you that there probably are, or will be, those that suggest homeschooling is awful because of the social aspect.  That kind of ignorance is one of the reasons I am glad I homeschool my children-they think outside of the box.  But, I can tell you that school is not the only, and it certainly is not the best, place to socialize.  <br>  <br>  There is no "best" program, either.  That would depend on the individual child's learning style and other aspects.  That brings me to another pro for homeschooling-a customized education rather than one from the cookie cutter mold.|`|eG7rb1Kbaa	1. Definitely home school. No contest. Home schooling provides a better education, and safer learning environment. Not to mention freedom. I would never recommend public school, even private is bad. (Been to a bad private school.)<br>  <br>  2. I actually home school myself. It really depends on if the child is mature enough to do the work by themselves.<br>  <br>  3. No, it doesn't affect college in any way. Some colleges only require a high school diploma. Some may require the SAT, which can be taken at any private/public school, or by a certified evaluator.|`|bCi8BCBBaa	Shiori_h's answer is everything I would say.  It depends on the family and student.  My advice is to figure out which is better for you and your family.  There is no "better", only better for the student and family.  There are plenty of excellent, dedicated parents who choose all types of education and it isn't anyone's place to judge anyone else in their choice for their family.  Universities accept and recruit every type of student who excels. Homeschooled students who excel have and excellent chance of getting into college.  There is no monopoly of university acceptance letters.<br>  <br>  Edit: I forgot to add that I would at minimum supervise my older children in their studies.  I want to ensure that they are getting a well rounded course of study.  I also don't think there is any one best curriculum.  It depends on the student.  Some kids need the structure of a planned curriculum, others don't.  There is no right or wrong to any of this, only individuals.<br>  <br>  Edit again, :-) Do what is right for you, not what a stranger believes is best for you.  No one is perfect, and no one receives a perfect education, even when they say they do.   Well educated people are always striving for more knowledge, not congratulating themselves on their perfection in their studies.|`|XLHrIFA4aa	I think that home schooling offers a more personalized education, formatted to their strengths and weaknesses. However, kids need to go to school at some point to experience being away from home and making friends. In high school it's important because classes are more specialized, so it's best to have teachers that have a degree in that specific subject. AP classes definitely require a lot of knowledge by the teacher, so it's recommended that they go to high school for AP classes.|`|6va6oPpCaa	1) It just depends on the child. Some children need to be away from home, others need to be alone to work.<br>  <br>  2) Children can't homeschool themself. They have to have some kind of teaching.<br>  <br>  3) It doesn't affect college that much, colleges like homeschoolers because of their maturity and self-motivation. The child may have to do more searching for scholarships, but that's pretty much it.|`|1cH3kNcMaa	Public school is the better choice if you can find a good one a lot of public schools are bad environments. But i have heard of kids who have home schooled themselves and have been successful. So it isnt a bad alternative. If you can afford it though private schools will give your child the best opportunity trust me i go to one|`|z8YZY9lOaa	definetly home schooling! i'm 13 and am home schooled it's great, idk if you're kid or if you are a kid and is dealing with bullying or whatever but home schooling is great you can work at your own pace and even get ahead a grade if you really are determined, I do an online school sooo yeah lol.|`|HcPJKTlWaa	1.) Private or Homeschool is better in my opinion.<br>  <br>  2.) No I would not let my children home school themselves. Kids need to be taught or at the very least guided and supervised.<br>  <br>  3.) No it does not affect collage options. Even Ivy league collages accept home schoolers. My aunt home schooled her 7 children most of which are out of high school and 4 of which have graduated from college. My oldest child will start high school next year and we are going to be using an accredited program and they will get a diploma from A Beka academy and be able to attend graduation.<br>  <br>  Home schoolers can use a proven curriculum as well as learn what they are interested in . This helps children to love to learn. All of the home schoolers I have known have done very well academically. My kids are also involved in soccer, piano, gymnastics, swimming, quiz team and drama team so they are very well socialized. My oldest tested post high school in 7th grade and the other two tested above grade level. Public schools just don't have the resources that private schools or home schools do. School officials often try to tell parents what they can or can not do. It would seem they forget who is responsible for the child. (Please forgive me if I ramble I have the flu but I felt this was an important question)|`|a8qFkmSzaa	1) Homeschooling!! I dont have to deal with fake people!! and im getting a better education!!=)<br>  <br>  2) Um i do homeschool myself. I do fine.<br>  <br>  3) No way. It gives you more education!!<br>  <br>  I am doing the switched on school house. (if you are a christian i strongly recomend) it has bible lessons and stuff. its pretty kool.|`|cMZEmpp0aa	1) This depends on the family (and sometimes even varies from child to child within a family). For me it was better because my local school district either could not or would not do anything to meet my needs. Teachers often yelled at me for things like reading two chapters in a book when they had only assigned one. I was bored and the pace of the class (supposedly targeted at the "average student") was too slow for me. Homeschooling allowed me to move at my own pace and follow my interests. <br>  <br>  2) It would depend on the child. I probably wouldn't let younger kids homeschool themselves. I think it's better for them to have more adult guidance. I would be more inclined to let older kids homeschool themselves, but you know...the parents really do still need to be involved, even if it's only in the capacity of handling the legal issues and checking in with the kids every so often.<br>  <br>  3) Well, on average it certainly doesn't hurt their chances of getting into college. Many colleges not only accept but actively recruit homeschoolers. Homeschoolers have access to scholarships, grants, and loans, just like their traditionally-schooled peers. This holds whether or not the homeschooler has any kind of diploma or high school credits. The homeschooler just has to prove that he or she is capable of college-level work (which is really something all college applicants have to do), and there are plenty of ways to do that.<br>  <br>  4) I never used a program. For me, set curricula really go against one of the biggest benefits of homeschooling, which is the flexibility to move at your own pace, follow your own interests, and use whatever kinds of materials work best for you. Of course, if the structure of a curriculum fits your own learning style, then it's a great thing to have. But I see no reason for any homeschooler to feel like a set curriculum is essential for success.

George Washington Carver<br>  <br>  Always be a first-rate version of yourself, instead of a second-rate version of somebody else. ~Judy Garland<br>  <br>  A man told his grandson: "A terrible fight is going on inside me -- a fight between two wolves. One is evil, and represents hate, anger, arrogance, intolerance, and superiority . The other is good, and represents joy, peace, love, tolerance, understanding, humility, kindness, empathy, generosity, and compassion. This same fight is going on inside you, inside every other person too." The grandson then asked: "Which wolf will win?" The old man replied simply:  "The one you feed."

It is an opportunity for the students to ask intelligent questions and to demonstrate that you are sincere about learning, and to have a recording as evidence. Then take the recording to the Head Teacher, but not before you have made a copy of it. You have the right to ask the Head teacher what he or she will do about the situation, but you must always remember to be polite, cooperative and sincere. I have no tolerance for teachers who let down their students. The job is too important for it to be done badly. Students have every right to demand the very highest standards from their teachers.

cWuumdy7aa	Aluminium is a soft, durable, lightweight, malleable metal with appearance ranging from silvery to dull grey, depending on the surface roughness. Aluminium is nonmagnetic and nonsparking. It is also insoluble in alcohol, though it can be soluble in water in certain forms. The yield strength of pure aluminium is 7–11 MPa, while aluminium alloys have yield strengths ranging from 200 MPa to 600 MPa.Aluminium has about one-third the density and stiffness of steel. It is ductile, and easily machined, cast, and extruded.<br>  <br>  Corrosion resistance can be excellent due to a thin surface layer of aluminium oxide that forms when the metal is exposed to air, effectively preventing further oxidation. The strongest aluminium alloys are less corrosion resistant due to galvanic reactions with alloyed copper This corrosion resistance is also often greatly reduced when many aqueous salts are present however, particularly in the presence of dissimilar metals.<br>  <br>  Aluminium atoms are arranged in a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure, which may explain its high melting point. Aluminium has a high stacking-fault energy of approximately 200 mJ/m2.<br>  <br>  Aluminium is one of the few metals that retain full silvery reflectance in finely powdered form, making it an important component of silver paints. Aluminium mirror finish has the highest reflectance of any metal in the 200–400 nm (UV) and the 3000–10000 nm (far IR) regions, while in the 400–700 nm visible range it is slightly outdone by tin and silver and in the 700–3000 (near IR) by silver, gold, and copper.<br>  <br>  Aluminium is a good thermal and electrical conductor, by weight better than copper. Aluminium is capable of being a superconductor, with a superconducting critical temperature of 1.2 kelvin and a critical magnetic field of about 100 gauss.|`|Mdk7DmiAaa	Nearly all the elements are considered metals, only a few of the naturally occurring elements are true non-metals.  <br>  <br>  Some key characteristics of metals that also describes aluminum :  luster (shines), ductile (stretchable), malleable (hammerable), and the molecular structure forms as a crystal lattice.  This lattice gives Aluminum great thermal and electrical conductivity.
5zhAdR1raa	First, FAFSA is NOT a financial aid program. It is a form you fill out that the colleges you apply to use to determine how much financial aid they will give you, or that you are eligible for. <br>  <br>  It is possible that since you missed the college deadline, it will adversely affect what they offer you. Typically colleges process financial aid requests based on when they arrive in the queue, and ones that arrive after the deadline may get a low priority assigned them.<br>  <br>  For future years, here is my suggestion, and it is what I do for my kids:<br>  <br>  Right after the first of the year, I file a FAFSA using my tax numbers for the previous year - like for instance, this year, I first filed using my 2007 tax numbers. I put on the FAFSA that I will file, so they know it is not my final numbers, but the important thing is to get into the queue!! Then, once I do my taxes, I file an amended FAFSA with my current numbers. Make sure that you pick a password (this is not the same as your PIN!) or you will not be able to get back into your FAFSA to amend it!

Tell them as much as you can about what's going on--don't hide any of it.  Go to the school guidance counselor and ask for help; maybe changing classes to get away from the creeps will help.  Even if it doesn't, it shows your dad that you are trying as much as you can to handle the problem maturely.<br>  <br>  If they ask you why you are sitting at another table, don't swear or do anything that adds to the trouble.  Say that you want to sit at a table where you'll have a more peaceful lunch.  Is your bff, really your bff?  Most best friends won't stay best friends with one person while being good friends with others who are cruel to their bff; they'd choose one side or another (and if she stays friends with the cruel people, she is making a choice).  You might want to ask her if she thinks you are contributing to the problems, and for her take on what's going on--it might help you to better understand what's going on.<br>  <br>  But you need to get some adults on your side.  Tell your teachers and the guidance counselor--they can't do a thing to help if they aren't aware of the problems.  If the abuse gets too bad, and the school officials won't do anything, try getting the police in on it--that usually gets people's attention to the seriousness of the problem.<br>  <br>  And keep telling your parents, daily, about the latest bullying.  Eventually, they'll see it as a problem and may be willing to change your schooling.  If they aren't, ask them to put you in a self-defense class (karate, Tae Kwon Do, Judo, boxing, wrestling, etc.)  Tell the instructor there why you are in the class so that he can concentrate on what you need to know to really defend yourself.  Usually, such classes will build your confidence and make you a less appealing target to bullies; and if they do give you a hard time, you'll be better prepared to deal with it.<br>  <br>  Middle school kids can be very mean and cruel to each other, especially if the grownups aren't doing their jobs.  Make sure that they are aware of the full extent of what's going on, and if one grownup refuses to help, tell others until you find one who will help....<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|eG7rb1Kbaa	Tell your parents that you don't feel safe in public school.<br>  <br>  Tell them that (from my own personal experience) that home schooling provides a safe, and secure environment, and it provides a better education, and better concentration on school work.|`|Rr7bVConaa	too much drama for a young child. a bit of advices, ignore anyone who  are mean to you and be alone is not that bad if everyone around you are jerks.

You shouldn't take the easy way out and become home schooled- it'll limit your education and your social life, and you'll never know what great things you missed by not going to school. Everyone at my school hated me in sixth grade too, and I had pretty much the exact same problem with lunch tables in ninth grade. Things change, people change, drama happens, and you end up coming out on the other side wiser and better. Everyone hated me in sixth grade, but now I have tons of people who love me, which never would have happened if my mom hadn't refused to home school me in sixth grade. Just bear it out- things will get better. My best advice is, if that girl really is your BFF, then she'll choose you over that jerk, or at least not make you feel obligated to hang around her. And if not, then find new friends. You'll feel better.|`|bKKo6UFSaa	watch drill bit Taylor and get some ideas.

AA11852692	We struggle and work hard for what we want and need. At times when things go wrong, we tend to give up since what's the point of working even harder since we are not appreciated.  The message is for us to keep on working, trying, fighting and never give up because no matter how hard life seems to be, we can do it, we can make it, we are strong and even on the bad days, we need to keep strong and show that we can do it.<br>  <br>  Just like Aaliyah's song "Try Again">"If at first you don't succeed, dust yourself off and try again".|`|VB5midTraa	i think: even though we suffer on the inside we still have to face the real world and pretend like there is nothing going wrong. we have to face the music.
4xsAQBZuaa	Kid pushed me from behind at school knocking me to the floor, got up turned around, scuffled with him until I got past and left the room,  This is where I stood up for me, principles office, he got suspended for three days and they wanted to suspend me for one, said I wasn't happy with that and didn't feel I should be suspended.  When Pr. got back from talking to witness' it was in my favor and I got no punishment.  Sooooo scary to speak up for me and to an adult and to the school principle, but for the first time I knew 100% that I was in the right and that has made all the difference.

sjOelwhhaa	These short conversational responses depend on what you are responding to.  If you agree with a negative comment, you say, "Me neither."<br>  <br>  It's also possible to say,"Nor am I,"or "I'm not either."  These are uncommon in everyday speech.  It is worthwhile to practice responding with "Me, too," and "Me neither."<br>  <br>  A:  I'm happy<br>  B:  Me, too.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  I should also tell you another way, which is "Neither am I."  Both "neither am I" and "me, neither" are used daily by English speakers.<br>  <br>  These responses are good for sentences with "be."  For sentences with other verbs, use "do."  <br>  Example:  A:  I don't like liver.  B:  Neither do I  (or I don't either.)<br>  Example: A:   I like pizza  B:  So do I (or I do too).|`|5VqxkMFuaa	The correct expression is "nor am I", or, alternatively, "neither am I". In colloquial (but incorrect) language, "me neither" would be commonly used. <br>  <br>  "me either" would be always incorrect, as the original statement is in the negative form.|`|7428c2399ac39bb8006f047995493c49aa	Neither am I.<br>  (But people do say 'me neither' - rightly or wrongly)<br>  .|`|VmSKQ40Caa	2 is correct!!

For example that time I think British took over India so to get rid of them Gandhi and his people decided that to boycott the British settlers.

jyqep8QOaa	It depends on the school you're attending. Let's say you went to a public university for both pre-pharmacy and pharmacy school. It would cost around $15,000 per year for a total of eight years. That would cost $120,000 in all after becoming a pharmacist. Now, let's say you went to a private university for both pre-pharmacy and pharmacy school. It would cost maybe $30,000 per year at least for eight years. That would cost $240,000 in total.
2646a4e9d6d4e936660d70ff922397f3aa	Definitely go to the community college.  I'm not familiar with that particular school, but there is no reason to pay $19,500 for a for-profit associate's degree when you could get at least as good a program at almost any community college, and you would have a much easier time transferring to a four-year college, should you eventually decide to go in that direction, from the community college.  <br>  <br>  And yes, it would be easier to get scholarships and grants at the community college.  Since the for-profits like UOP are in it for the money, they aren't too interested in giving you a financial break.  <br>  <br>  This is what you would be taking at Chandler-Gilbert College:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://webport.cgc.maricopa.edu/published/c/he/check2007/checksheet/66/?__s=nf-20090307230929-30516" rel="nofollow">http://webport.cgc.maricopa.edu/publishe...</a><br>  <br>  This is what you would be taking at the University of Phoenix:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://phoenix.edu/Programs/Sealsheets/Axia/012/AAACC-012.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://phoenix.edu/Programs/Sealsheets/A...</a>|`|zRH530kqaa	UNIVERSITY OF PHOENIX NO CREDITS WILL TRANSFER.

wBffQgPiaa	Actually, it is more correct to say:<br>  <br>  To my mom,  like whom I strive to become every day.  <br>  <br>  or even: ...like to whom<br>  <br>  However this is a rather complicated and awkward sentence.  You may want to try a verb that uses only a single word.

I think she likes Kyle, but likes you as a friend.  Let's give it a score of 6 on the friendship scale.

2HETgiwgaa	There are lots of different art courses you can do in New Zealand.  I'd start at the New Zealand Educated website (which also has information on scholarships that you might want to check out).  As to cost, you'll be able to find that if you follow the link to the particular course and insitution.  The New Zealand dollar is quite low at the moment (around 50c US) so you should take that into account when you are looking at fees, and remember to look at fees for international students (not domestic).  <br>  <br>  Go to the Immigration New Zealand website as well - it'll tell you what you need to do to study in New Zealand, like getting a student visa.|`|c44e3405e41369f91438487d151dfa4aaa	see scholarships blog may help <br>  <br>  <a href="http://scholarship1.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://scholarship1.blogspot.com/</a>

Chemical engineering is really a stupid degree not to be mean, but you will be competing with people from the Armed Forces who have a lot more experience than you.

4xsAQBZuaa	Great question and so much to say but you may want to ask again in the parenting teens section, you'll be surprised by the answers.  High school is what you make of it.  Go in feeling good and stay that way no matter what happens or what you see.  We can worry our selves sick thinking about this stuff and we can also over exaggerate what we see into something horrific.  Don't let this happen.  HS is fun and as the years go by and you get to being a senior you'll look back and laugh at what you were so worried about and be surprised on how grown up you feel.  The only thing you really have to worry about in HS are your grades and what your study courses will be to help lead you into college.  Don't take easy A classes and don't leave any class hours blank.  HTH!!!|`|yV8fog7Paa	high school is just like jr high except kids are not as rowdy and hyper.

At mine, they have a different meal every day in the cafeteria.  Most people bring their own lunch.  And the caf is crowded but most people eat outside in the quad.  They also sell pizza every day in the quad.  Lunch is a half hour, starts at 12:30.  And I don't think any of the food is really good, but it resembles food so that's a plus.  And they have interesting food, not just the boring things.  So some days we have Mexican or Italian, but it's all frozen and heated up there.  I don't normally buy it because everything, especially the drinks, are really expensive.|`|lBj1AEhIaa	my lunch is at 11:15.  first lucnh is at 10:40 i think. not sure how many lunches.  not really crowed, but the school as a whole is. we have only 1 main high school.  and gross greasy food.<br>  <br>  i take my luch, and the lunch ladies look gross!!|`|6119de85724e004456dd63f7c51d0568aa	my school has a pretty big selection of stuff to chose from and they have a main cafeteria and little snack bars... but that could just be my school.... anyways most people just eat wherever you'll end up fining a good spot the lunch rooms are normally pretty crowded but most people eat outside, its a lot more fun to eat out side because your so used to elementary and middle school not letting you out that its like a special privilegee... so yeah umm high schooll lunches are pretty fun. for the most part everyone just ends up finding a spot to everyday and it sticks all 4 years....|`|uDZZLH0Uaa	when i was in high school we had a great thing going with the lunch room.<br>  we called it the common room.<br>  yes we all ate lunch there mid day 12pm but if we had a study hall and our grades were C+ and above we were aloud to go to the common room with our other class mates that had study halls as well and play cards,games,read, checkers what ever we wanted to . we could also raid the vending machines for sweets and sodas... it was great. it also gave the students the incentive to keep their grades up so they could spend 45 minutes hang out with their friends...<br>  if their grade droped below a C+ then they had to stay in study hall with a teacher studying... boring huh.<br>  well as far as our lunches went they were pretty good. now adays you want to barf at the sight of the hot lunches in school. yuck,<br>  <br>  in australia i don't think they offer hot meals in school so the kids take their own lunches. if the parents pack too much junk food in their child's lunch they are called and told they have to provide a healthy meal for their kids and no junk food.. sad huh<br>  and all i mean all of the schools here in Australia ware uniforms... they have to.<br>  no questions asked.<br>  cheers mystic|`|bf4b7ffcdba307f907f3c6ea0d71039daa	tried of high school lunch|`|v3okWSQaaa	It sucks.<br>  I have Freshmen lunch(only freshmen).<br>  It's the last lunch of the day, which means nastier foos then usual, but no, it's not crowded.

Helen Keller <br>  <br>  All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing. Edmund Burke <br>  <br>  Go with your fate, but not beyond. Beyond leads to dark places.

The glass is always half empty. And cracked. And I just cut my lip on it. And chipped a tooth.”  Janeane Garofalo <br>  <br>  “Sing then the core of dark and absolute oblivion where the soul at last is lost in utter peace.”  D.H. Lawrence <br>  <br>  Slowly creeping up and down, this feeling is cold, its always around. Cellina Rodriguez <br>  <br>  Lost in the confines of my own mind, blinded by chains. It's the fading line, fragments of faith. Natalie<br>  <br>  Let those who don't understand me fear me, let those who do understand me, fear themselves. Unknown, Lost & Alone<br>  <br>  We are never the same with others as when we are alone. We are different, even when we are in the dark with them.

Shelby Lynne <br>  <br>  A good many things go around in the dark besides Santa Claus. Herbert Hoover <br>  <br>  What other dungeon is so dark as one's own heart!

Dzvo9yVWaa	It depends on if you want to go on to Graduate School later. With a political science degree, you are going to find that most people will go on to get their Masters in Political Science or Public Administration or to get their JD.

AA10774810	I am biracial: my mother is Mexican and my father is black. However, I spent my life under the sole care of my Mexican mother; this plays an important role in my heritage. I grew up in Southern Texas and I enjoyed learning too speak two different languages. I enjoyed speaking Spanish and the opportunity that I had to learn the language fluently. I have grown up entirely comfortable with my biracial background, and I am proud to be identified as black even though even if it is not how I view myself.<br>  <br>  Even though most of my features looked black, people often stereotype me because of the way I looked. My hair is curly and kinky (I don't like this word.  How about frizzy?). People look at me and see an  African American. However, that is not who I am; I am both black and Mexican and I would like to be seen as both. People outside of my family stereotype me frequently simply because my skin complexion is darker than theirs or the texture of my hair is a little thicker than theirs. Typically, when they hear me utter one word in Spanish, they automatically assume that I learned to speak Spanish in school. I respond that my ethnic background was of Spanish decent. Even then, people still assume that I am from some island or from Puerto Rica. <br>  <br>  I've learned that people need to stop stereotyping and assuming things about particular races, and instead they need to actually take the time to learn more about that person. From this experience alone, I've learned to never to stereotype anyone. I am the type of individual that is inquisitive about people's culture and backgrounds. Learning more about people can make our lives that much more enriching. We all need to open ourselves to interacting with others that are different from ourselves to learn that it can be an interesting environment of which to be a part.<br>  <br>  Diversity is more than an individual's race and ethnicity. It is about unique personalities, viewpoints, and perspectives. Throughout our lives, we are going to meet people who we interact with, either in our work environment or where we live, that are different from ourselves. We need to put aside our differences and focus on what each individual can contribute in terms of strengths and capabilites. The world would be a boring place if we all thought alike. I learned this from individuals from different cultures and backgrounds. We are all the same but also somehow different. We are the same in that we are all human beings that deserve to be respected for who we are. We are different in that Our ideas, personalities, perspectives and ways of solving problems may be different from one individual to the next. There is nothing wrong with learning to view ideas and problems with a new, different attitude.  Therefore, we need to be open to learning what individuals from different cultures are like and why they believe things as they do. We are all different and can learn to embrace those differences with respect, compassion, and integrity.<br>  <br>  I have often found myself questioning with what race do identify myself. Choosing to identify with one race more than the other is plain ludicrous for me. My physical appearance can look more black than Mexican but I have chosen to honor all those components in me by embracing them in different aspects of my life in California.|`|Vmt7ylcuaa	I can not do editing as you wish but I pray let you become another Obama in the future!|`|AA11199260	You have yourself adequately explained your experience in life which is the main cause that you yourself belong to two different races. You are Mexican from mother and black from father. This is the real point in your essay and all other aspects revolves round the aforementioned main point. This essay does not require any addition or alteration. Good Luck
kvLWTTlhaa	Darling, you are a FRESHMAN =]  You are forbidden from thinking about these things until at least the end of your sophomore year, and trust me, that will come much, much sooner than you think.<br>  <br>  Running a mile in six minutes isn't that impressive =)  Don't overload your schedule with too many activities.  I would take a ballerina who danced for fifteen years (as her one and only sole activity) over a student in nine different clubs for three years each.  In a heartbeat.  The emphasis here (not to mention in life) is quality, not quantity.<br>  <br>  AP English, Chinese, Yearbook, Euro, PreCalc, Chem, and Art would be good for junior year.<br>  <br>  Acc. English, Chinese, Yearbook, Business, Calc, Bio, and Anatomy would be good for senior year.<br>  <br>  Being on yearbook looks fine on a transcript, but as far as activities go, it's not the highest on the totem pole.<br>  <br>  Now, let me ask you a question - have you even visited Columbia, or are you only judging based on the internet, reviews, and family advice/pressure ?|`|YXwFOWmzaa	WAAAAAAAAAAAAY to many classes you wont even remember high school because you are so busy with classes slow down kiddo enjoy high school it only comes around once in your life.|`|uEgiSyBoaa	I would get out of yearbook, and do the hospital program thing. The classes listed seem hard, and challenging, but be careful they aren't too hard, it could ruin a gpa. <br>  <br>  As for clubs we have some pretty cool clubs at my school. DECA is one it is a marketing club. HOSA is another it's like deca, but health related. Speed stacking club, foreign language clubs, frisbee club swimming club, juggling club, spirit club, mountain biking club, running club, and snowboarding club. <br>  <br>  I belong to DECA, Speed stacking, french, swimming, spirit, and snowboarding and another called smart club.I am in many AP classes, and play soccer, basketball, and tennis for the school's varsity teams. I have straight A's, volunteer as a mentor for little kids, and read to the elderly when i am not busy, as well as volunteer at the concession stand for sporting events that i am not playing in. As well, I work at a weekend job, and in the summer I am a lifeguard, and teach children how to swim. I also play the piano for the school band and at the theater in our town for some plays(when they need me)<br>  <br>  <br>   All of the clubs were created by students, so if they interst you, you can try to get some of them at your school. Also, don't freak out about everything I do, Im a junior in high school, so you have plenty of time to accomplish goals you set. Just always try and never give up when something is hard. As for the thing about being asian, it is actually more likely to get accepted, because schools like to have ethnic diversity. <br>  GOOD LUCK!!!!!!!!<br>  d:^)
YyXtxeNGaa	The fact that you ask for help is an indication that you are anything but stupid and your teacher certainly knows that.<br>  The only way you teacher will think poorly of you is if you do not apply yourself and devote the necessary time to the subject.<br>  <br>  Algebra is a game of mental manipulation and dexterity.  The more you practice the better you will become.  In some ways it is like learning to ride a bicycle.  At first you simply can not do it.  Then, after a certain point, you start to see the light and you wonder why it seemed so hard.<br>  <br>  I did quite poorly in high school algebra, in fact the highest grade I ever got was a C.  <br>  After going to college I had to take college algebra and started to get the hang of it.  I recall talking with the professor one day after class about this "feared" math called calculus.  She said that I would have no trouble with it if I applied myself.  Her encouragement had a profound effect and gave me a lot of self-confidence.  Eventually I changed my major to engineering.  I took calculus, differential equations, linear algebra, advanced engineering math, and advanced calculus.  I went from being very very poor at math to very good.  So anything's possible!<br>  <br>  One suggestion:  Study groups are always good.  Having a student explain to you how to solve a problem will give you a different and often helpful perspective.|`|FjmVE5Lsaa	Hey we can't all understand math so perfectly, it just doesnt click in some peoples brains, i too have trouble with math all the time, asking questions is the best thing to do, the more u ask the better it is, And even if the teacher does think u are stupid, who caress !! its there job to teach you.|`|5ae79363542e2dbb3276198b98d8f062aa	all of us gets a hard time when it comes to math or algebra or physics etc.. and do you know what? asking for help is no big deal. <br>  <br>  maybe, it is the teacher's fault why you can't really understand algebra. <br>  maybe she is not good in teaching at all when it comes to teaching a whole class.<br>  and maybe, you could only learn algebra better when it comes to a 1-on-1 session with your teacher.<br>  <br>  teachers are always there to help you out. and teachers has no rights to tell someone that a student of them is stupid.|`|z2BnPqO1aa	Probably, but teachers are human too, and if you are stupid, they probably think you are stupid.<br>  <br>  But hey, atleast you are worried about it.<br>  <br>  And don't let that deter you from asking questions there slugger.
n03LF2Jaaa	It comes from a 70s commercial for a type of muesli bar called a Swisscuit.<br>  Basically the character in it was dared to do dangerous things in return for the bar and would say.............<br>  "I'll risk it for a Swisscuit."
4xsAQBZuaa	No, you've already said on the areas of... every area after has now been covered.  Now of may be an issue, of employees, of 'ethical issues', and of the natural environment.|`|k2Jbp9e6aa	Yes, it is fine.  I think you second guessed because you previously used "focus on." Focus needs the "on" and emphazing doesn't.|`|OTvSnO7naa	No, it's fine as is.|`|uC75y83Taa	Nope.  It's perfect. :)|`|VmSKQ40Caa	I honestly do not even know where in there you want to put the word "on" in. Leave it the way it is.
smV6u3aeaa	It would be more correct to use "incorporating", but the word itself doesn't make a lot of sense in this context. I would say "(business focused on social responsibility rather than profits)" OR "(business focused on being socially responsible rather than on making profits). The latter is a bit wordy though. <br>  <br>  Hope that helps.  :)|`|7Rd6v9tTaa	yes. Incorporated means something like 'to include' so it should be right.
AA11454606	In the context of the sentence, the best word would be provide.|`|UQdqzLgfaa	i would put:<br>  <br>  provide, supply, subsidize, convey<br>  <br>  thats me personally..<br>  <br>  because you're not trying to satisfy, or appease the information itself, you're trying to satisfy the stakeholders...So you could say, Unfortunately, the amount of information in the report didn't satisfy stakeholders, especially on the non-financial aspects.|`|BC4Gd7Ciaa	yes, to me it seems reasonable. appease would also work well.|`|PtSeJXnEaa	represent or include i think is what youre trying to say.|`|gaNm48FJaa	Try Propagate.|`|awLr3uCaaa	I would use "convey" instead. Just my preference.|`|TFz8udnQaa	present|`|AA10481903	'provide'|`|5c6671e8f478958f34681c2f7e863dc2aa	"convey" is good, also "provide"
xNcBLxMbaa	It is grammatically correct but the sentence reads better if you rewrite it like this:<br>  <br>  Since much of the regulated disclosure statements appear in Annual Reports, that is an indication that sustainability reporting is of interest to shareholders.<br>  <br>  Also, you are missing two commas in the first sentence. Insert them after "example" and "schools". Even with commas added, the first sentence is quite awkward.|`|cy8jcW6laa	It would be grammatically correct to replace 'as much of' with 'as much as'.|`|5VqxkMFuaa	The first sentence seems to have something missing. The construction with "While...." would suggest that another thought would follow in alternative or in contra-position to the first part. A couple of commas could be added as suggested by another answerer.<br>  <br>  In the second sentence, it might be better to replace "as" with "since", and put a comma after Reports. The word "Certainly" is not necessary.
7428c2399ac39bb8006f047995493c49aa	Yes - but I would use 'differ'.<br>  Also, put a semi-colon after 'reporting'.<br>  .|`|xuF8WPyvaa	yah.|`|SLPaw30iaa	Yes it is|`|OzLm0sF0aa	yes
wBffQgPiaa	"report" needs an article (like "a") preceding it, or it should be plural ("reports").<br>  <br>  I also think it is repetitive.  Don't repeat "motivation" and "motivations" in the first sentence: get rid of one of them.<br>  <br>  The second sentence needs a verb, and also has too many repetitions of "motivations".  <br>  <br>  I think "more than one" might be better as "a mixture" or "a combination" or "various".|`|4xsAQBZuaa	a sustainability.....1st sentence find new word for motivation.....comma after organizations'.....second sentence is hanging, take out such as and replace both with consist of.....3rd sentence still seems contradicting to say motives and motivations......|`|AA10345036	No!|`|5VqxkMFuaa	The second sentence should have a verb. In any case, the sentences are rather repetitive, and could be streamlined.
OTvSnO7naa	No, you are suggesting that standards review each other.  Simply say "The GRI G3 sustainability reporting guidelines are the most widely accepted standard."|`|aSTmFCiBaa	correct|`|7428c2399ac39bb8006f047995493c49aa	This is quite a report you're doing.<br>  It is used correctly. I would leave out the word 'standard' at the end.<br>  .
FU4TyghIaa	sustainability report<br>  if it's singular then it should specify : the sustainability report<br>  else it should be pluralized : sustainability reports<br>  <br>  look, i'm a bit confused what you're saying.<br>  I don't think it can : take objectives?<br>  <br>  more like : take various forms and reach/attain/accomplish differing objectives  <br>  i think you take forms and reach or accomplish objectives.<br>  I changed various then for those objectives, rather than repeat that word, i used differing instead.  To break it up.  Then again, it could emphasize by repetition::<br>  take various forms and accomplish various objectives.<br>  <br>  How does that sound?|`|wyWz6LYHaa	yes|`|4327e12a9ea91715509dd4a0cd4a0458aa	Yes, I believe so.<br>  However, the first sentence sounds slightly awkward...I think "report" should be pluralized to "reports."<br>  And too many repetitions of the word "report" (reporting) in the first sentence! :)
Mdk7DmiAaa	Projects such as papers, labs, and verbal questioning can be used as ways to objectively assess a student's academic understanding.  Although, the real world uses standardized tests in nearly every 'white' collar field.|`|EU7CUy2aaa	squish their tooshie|`|smy7GHkXaa	Hard to answer that question, since you didn't specify what the student is doing?  Is it a p.e. class?  Is it a hard-core academic class, like physics?  Your question is way too vague and generalized to elicit even a halfway-intelligent answer.  Please be more specific.
2646a4e9d6d4e936660d70ff922397f3aa	No degree brings you a salary at all.  The salary comes from the job you get after graduating, so it depends on what work the individual does.  It is fairly obvious what someone with a degree in nutrition/dietetics would do, but someone with a master's degree in psychology could go in a number of different directions, which could lead to very different salaries.

AA11091315	Not appreciating somebody.|`|jOZWekKjaa	It means you just assume they'll always be there and never really appreciate them.<br>  <br>  I made that mistake, and never realized it until I lost that person.|`|271e6581641939afd4192f67ff3b66d8aa	It means that you don't appreciate them or what they do for you. <br>  <br>  You expect something/someone without realizing it could just as easily not be there for you.   Ex:  You expect you mom to drive you to school every day because that is what she always does.  All of the sudden she  stops and you have to ride the bus which sucks and you wish your mom would drive you again.  At that point you would come to realize that you had been taking her for granted.|`|biKMQ2I1aa	it means assuming they will always be there, always do for you the things they do, etc. It can be a bad thing because you can lose appreciation for the person leaving them feeling bad|`|yYr412Vbaa	It means not seeing how much they mean to you, till they're gone.|`|ytGaDM7Haa	not appreciating all that they do for you.|`|UURuejLtaa	it means they are not acknowledged for their help/ effort/ presence, even love, and can also mean: they are been taken advantage of or being used|`|Ykb9lrPXaa	It means you take advantage of something and you get use to it and count on it.|`|Bm5TLWgdaa	you don't see them as what they are. you aren't appreciating as much as you should that that person does for you.
25mllixyaa	There was this quote that I read, it said, "Don't go looking for love; let it find you because that's why it's called falling; you don't mean to...you just do." When the time is right, the one you've been looking for will just appear before you. You may be able to speed up the process, or slow it down by looking. Because if you've looked everywhere, then you know he's not far away. It is best to just let things play out, if that's not your style, do what you feel is right. I wish you luck.|`|kvLWTTlhaa	Wait until college for a serious relationship =]  More relaxed scheduling + away from home = more fun for you.|`|uEgiSyBoaa	just kinda chill, keep your eyes open, but don't force anything.

You might also want to look at schools that allow you to create your own major, like Wesleyan or Brown University.
5zhAdR1raa	I am not sure I understand your question. Are you in high school or not? Once you finish high school, then you can attend community college for two years. But, at that point, you will need to attend a 4 year college to get your Bachelor's Degree - or medical schools will not even consider your application. Is there a college near your home that you can commute to - so you don't have to live in a dorm? I know students that do that.

kvLWTTlhaa	Are you looking for an English speaking college ?  And are you currently an EU citizen ?<br>  <br>  =]<br>  <br>  ______<br>  <br>  Being an EU student will just make your life a whole lot easier in terms of applying, paperwork, visas, etc. but shouldn't affect whether or not you are offered admission.  The problem is in the UK, as well as the rest of Europe, you need to pass many, many rigorous exams to graduate from high school.  The American equivalent of this would be approximately eight AP exams or an IB diploma.  Now, this is not explicitly required, but is almost always necessary for elite schools.<br>  <br>  Trinity is part of the University of Dublin, or UCD.  It's a nice school =)<br>  <br>  If you were looking for something in another country, I'd recommend the American University in Paris (all English speaking).  Besides the obvious (four years of university in Paris !), the application process is nearly identical to the standard American one, SAT scores and all.  <br>  <br>  John Cabot University in Rome is another English-speaking college you should look into.<br>  <br>  Hope it helps, and best of luck !|`|5GgR7xIaaa	It depends per program but there are a bunch of great schools in Europe. My good friend goes to school at UCL in London and shes having a great time. Most schools in the UK require decent marks to get into but they offer a wide selection of programs, the program she is in a science pre-med stream and she had good marks in high school but the schools in the UK and all of Europe are great. Id consult some of the university websites for more info.

UeUymAjwaa	with bachelor of science basically you would do research as a career...maybe a teacher or continue education.......perhaps become a manager after some yrs of experience....u would just be a research assistant..........do you like business?.......think about it this way if u dont get into med  would u like to be in the labs and do research, do you find science interesting out of curiosity............personally I had this same dilemma.......what I am going for is continue my bachelor of sci in health sciences, this option doesnt put me into too much information about proteins and a heavey emphasis on labs.....although it does put me in labs..i also get to learn about the health issues (like social sciences)....so basically I am getting education concenrated in sciences but also other social sciences topics so if i dont get into medicine i could try for law school or physiotherapy or even get some accounting courses to get certified as a CA in canada...if all else fails then pharmacy for me....................so basically find a program you will like and you will get good grades in that but be sure to get the medicine pre requisites....keep in mind your number one priority at ur stage i am assuming is to get into medical school then worry about dermatology, which is very competitive.......I would suggest that you do your first yr and then get into a pharmacy program if u like pharmacy....that way if u dont get into med u can be a trusted pharmacist.......but if you like business of course you can get a business degree with the medicine pre requisites as your elective choices....though I am not doing this since I really like my health sciences program.........so get any degree, do your searches, and make sure you like what you are gonna study in ur 3rd and 4th yr......good luck........i cant believe i wrote this long, but i can relate to what ur going through...I wish I was in my country where education was simple....stupid taliban and communists......here theres too much career choices lol....in my country you would go straight to medicine if you qualified but still had to do the same prerequisites as here for med...|`|jyqep8QOaa	You'll be taking courses like calculus, anatomy, biology, chemistry, physics, psychology, etc. It depends on the medical school which courses you need to take. You can major in anything you want as long as you fulfill those requirements. It would be hard to get a job and balance medical school. Both are too much work which is why people pull out loans and scholarships and are still in debt after becoming a licensed doctor. For dermatology, it takes about 14 or more years after high school, since you're specializing.|`|z2BnPqO1aa	dermatologists are doctors, so you would probably have to go to med-school.  Just my thought on the subject.<br>  <br>  Dermatology is probably one of the best fields of medicine to get into, from what my Uncles say, who are all doctors.<br>  <br>  You get to set your own hours, make tons of cash, and have a rather short residency period.

Then get a schedule of classes and enroll in the program.|`|6f5395773cce7a0187fdf217ce48b5e9aa	Web development is a vocational thing.  4 year colleges do not teach vocational programs.  They might offer noncredit courses in it though.  Else you need to look into a community college as they cater to vocational programs.  Not every CC will offer what you are looking for, but if you look around schools near you you will find one.

v4eBm6cMaa	Regret is something we all face, because nothing exists without flaw, and hindsight is 20-20. That said, you look at your brother as both a failure and a source of envy, so there was not a great enough drive for you to leave the establishment that you seem to hold in high regard. Even if you wanted the friends and network you could have gotten from the world outside your university, there was something in you that wasnt ready. I think that there are two key components to why you stayed, first, it was for your future- to have the degree from the college that you hold in high regard. Secondly, you stayed out of fear. I am guessing that you are around 23, and whether you had conquered some of your fears in the leap of faith you would have had to take to transfer, you would still be 23, and facing incredible challenges... finding yourself etc. But the bottom line is this- you sound like you had a kind of sad experience at college- and now that you are almost free, youre still dwelling on this same thorn. Now one thing that people often do when their scared about the future, is dwell on the past. If youve sacrificed your happiness over the last few years for a meaningful degree- take that degree and run with it. you want to live in a big city- your young, with a good education- now is the time to remember that you made a sacrifice for your future- and this is that future. The fear that stopped you from making your mark on the world and having the social experience in the city as a student is the same fear that is manifesting in sicking regret. I believe you think you made a mistake, but I also believe that you were smart, and mature in your choice. If youre still dying to be a student in the city, go get your masters or a phd from a big city school... Maybe your not a risk taker, not everyone is. Maybe youd like to be... if so, try to live outside of your comfort zone. good luck, and honestly, I think you made a fine choice, just try to come to terms with what you sacrificed, and youll use what you learned in the future!|`|zRH530kqaa	Easy lower your expectations of college.

If you are thinking of going to graduate school, pick one that has a more city or social atmosphere. You are still young and have years to have a good time and social life. You'll meet people at jobs, social events, clubs you belong to. Take advantage of future opportunities, get involved in activities, and you'll soon forget about the way things 'were' in college. I had a great time in college, my husband had a horrible time. I regret not getting better grades, he is happy with his grades and went on to further education, which was a good thing for him. <br>  <br>  For a lot of people college is not the best time in your life. There is opportunities for best times every day, month, year.<br>  <br>  Looking back, I see now that they come and go and you don't always realize you're having good times until after wards.

You'll see.|`|d9b9ee65958fb5852143813b606e79a9aa	Hey, you are so close to graduating and getting away from there that you need to just focus on the future - the past is in your rear view mirror and nothing can change it.<br>  Try thinking about where you'll go AFTER you graduate - the fun you'll have living where you always wanted and doing things you want to do.

Grants have objectives, and your purpose must fit the objective of the grant.<br>  <br>  For one, you have to write the grant application and the grant application is not a simple document - you have to explain how your purpose for applying for the grant fits well with the objectives set out by the grant.<br>  <br>  There is a stringent review process through a committee. You will compete with other applicants for the grant money, and this grant review committee will evaluate the merits of each proposal.

Most of the federal grants are given to specific target groups with specific requirements (e.g. minority business owners involved in transportation related contracts emanating from DOT - Grant#20.905 Disadvantaged Business Enterprises Short Term Lending Program. Individuals especially for personal purposes are not eligible for federal grants. <br>  <br>  Grants are also often given to non profit groups or organizations involved in training or other similar activities (grant 59.043 Women's Business Ownership Assistance that are given to those who will create women's business center that will train women entrepreneurs|`|gHR4vlcDaa	yes ! grants.gov is a great site, I am in my final year and we have a class called grant writing, we are using The Everything Grant Writing Book.. is only 14.95 get it and check it out, But the thing is government grants are not typically personal grants, they are for organizations- All the grants on grant.gov are real but it is harder than you think to write a grant, typical ones when you follow the grant offerers RPF end up being 35-75 pages long....

You can't take the GED online - the sites offering an online GED are scams.  The only real GED must be taken at a testing center, but states offer it several times a month all over the state, so it's not hard to find someplace to take it.  Not to mention some of those sites are charging $500 for their fake GED, and the real one often costs less than $10 to take (depending on the state).|`|VyjPWx1raa	There are plenty of online high schools listed here:<br>  <a href="http://www.onlinehighschool.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.onlinehighschool.org</a><br>  <br>  There's also a lot of free useful information.  <br>  <br>  Good luck

4maV4O1aaa	If you want to go to a 4-year school, you usually don't have to declare a degree right away, because you'll start off taking basic requirements first (liberal arts, math, etc.).  And there are so many types of computer degrees, so you might discover what you want to do after taking an introductory course.  Many college students, believe it or not, don't figure everything out beforehand.  They go, take some classes, and see what appeals to them.  And counselors can also help you plan your educational path.  But you can start looking for degree programs in Information Technology, Computer Architecture, Systems Engineering, or any number of majors.<br>  <br>  Check out the link below for ideas/inspiration.|`|bFfWFsFWaa	Computer Engineering. that's what by boyfriend is doing right now.<br>  <br>   As for particular schools in Indiana, I'm not sure.

trKgx3Ukaa	California is the one state that allows graduates from distance learning law schools to sit for their bar, assuming the examinees meet certain requirements. If you live in California, or if you’re willing to relocate, you may be able to become a practicing lawyer with an online law degree. After you work as a lawyer for a few years, it may be possible to practice law in some other states. Here’s what you need to know:<br>  Earning an Online Law Degree and Practicing Law in California<br>  <br>  In order to take the California Bar, students must meet certain requirements set by the Committee of Bar Examiners of the State Bar of California. There are seven basic steps to becoming a full-fledged lawyer.<br>  <br>  Step 1: Complete your pre-legal education. Most law students have already completed a bachelor’s degree. However, California’s minimum requirement is that students complete at least two years of college-level work (60 semester credits) with a GPA equal to or above that required for graduation. Alternatively, you may prove that you have intellectual ability equal to a college student in his second year by passing subject matter examinations with scores accepted by the Committee.<br>  <br>  Step 2: Complete your legal education. Online law students may sit for the California Bar if they receive “instruction in law from a correspondence law school requiring 864 hours of preparation and study per year and which is registered with the Committee (off-site link).” The Committee does not accredit online law schools; instead, they allow distance learning schools to register with them if the online schools meet requirements. Because the Committee won’t vouch for the quality of these programs, it is essential to thoroughly investigate any online law school before enrolling. Here are the online law schools currently registered with the Committee: <br>  <br>  Abraham Lincoln University School of Law<br>  American Heritage University School of Law<br>  California School of Law<br>  Concord School of Law<br>  Esquire College<br>  MD Kirk School of Law<br>  Newport University<br>  Northwestern California University<br>  Oak Brook College of Law and Government Policy<br>  Southern California University for Professional Studies<br>  University of Honolulu<br>  West Coast School of Law, Inc.<br>  West Haven University<br>  William Howard Taft University<br>  <br>  Read more about it here:<br>  <a href="http://distancelearn.about.com/od/onlinecourses/a/onlinelawschool.htm" rel="nofollow">http://distancelearn.about.com/od/online...</a>|`|2646a4e9d6d4e936660d70ff922397f3aa	Keep in mind that as an attorney, you aren't supposed to have an agenda but to do the best for your client, whoever that client may be.     There are one or two online law programs, but I don't believe that any are ABA-accredited, so you would have to take the Baby Bar as you would at any unaccredited law school.  There are plenty of law schools in the L.A. area, but you would have to be ready to commit a lot of time to it, no matter how you would approach it.

ispQWeQmaa	Air from the inside of the refrigerator is exposed to cold refrigerant that is circulating through the refrigerator coils. As you probably know from watching moisture condense on a window on a cold winter day, or water droplets on a bottle of refrigerated soda pop sitting out of the fridge, cold causes moisture to condense out of the air, and so the air inside a refrigerator loses humidity. Uncovered food in the refrigerator is therefore exposed to that dry air and tends to dry out faster than if it had been exposed to humid air.<br>  <br>  Incidentally leaving food uncovered in the fridge is a big energy waster, as the fridge compressor has to work harder to extract heat from moist air than it does to extract heat from dry air. So not only will your food last longer and taste fresher if you cover it, but you'll save energy too!|`|3p7552z3aa	um, evaporation? <br>  <br>  sometimes decomposition for long exposure to air.

6HhCecYgaa	Dagli atri ricoperti di muschio, dai Fori in rovina,<br>  dai boschi, dalle officine riarse stridenti,<br>  dai campi coltivati dagli schiavi,<br>  un popolo disperso si sveglia improvvisamente;<br>  tende l'orecchio, solleva la testa 5<br>  colpito da uno strano rumore crescente.<br>  Il coro si apre con una considerazione amara da parte del Manzoni sulla degradazione del popolo latino. Il Foro, simbolo della civiltà romana, è ormai in rovina, così come le officine dove un tempo si forgiavano le armi. Il popolo latino viene definito dal poeta come un "volgo disperso", perché non ha più nessuna consapevolezza della grandezza civile e militare degli antenati; esso è solamente un popolo schiavo, ben lontano dal riconoscere il rumore dell'appressarsi della guerra, mentre per i romani era così familiare.<br>  <br>  Dagli sguardi dubbiosi, dai volti impauriti,<br>  quale raggio di sole traluce da folte nuvole,<br>  che rivela la fiera virtù dei padri:<br>  negli sguardi, nei volti confusi ed incerti 10<br>  si mescolano e si contrastano l'umiliazione della schiavitù<br>  con il misero orgoglio di un tempo ormai andato.<br>  Il ritratto dei latini rivela un popolo che ha ormai perso la propria identità e le proprie radici. L'umiliazione della schiavitù contrasta con un orgoglio di una grandezza ormai passata, e per questo inutile e senza senso. Da qui emerge un accenno polemico nei confronti dei classicisti, che cercavano di far rivivere qualcosa che si allontana di molto dal presente.<br>  <br>  Il volgo si raduna voglioso di libertà, si disperde impaurito,<br>  per sentieri tortuosi, con passo incerto,<br>  fra il timore degli antichi padroni e il desiderio della loro sconfitta, avanza e si ferma di nuovo;15<br>  e sogguarda e fissa la turba dispersa scoraggiata e confusa<br>  dei crudeli signori,<br>  che fugge dalle spade dei Franchi, che non si fermano mai.<br>  L'atteggiamento del volgo è incerto: si alternano in esso attimi in cui si desidera la libertà, succeduti dal timore nei confronti degli antichi padroni. Davanti ai loro occhi la folla dei signori Longobardi che fuggono, definita una "turba", ovvero un mucchio di persone senza anima. I "torti sentieri" stanno ad indicare l'incuria e lo stato di inciviltà al quale si è ridotta la società, in contrapposizione con le grandi strade costruite dai romani.<br>  <br>  Il volgo li vede agitati, come fiere tremanti,<br>  le rossastre criniere dritte per la paura, 20<br>  che cercano i noti nascondigli;<br>  e qui, messo da parte l'usuale atteggiamento minaccioso,<br>  le donne superbe, con il viso pallido,<br>  guardano pensose i figli pensosi.<br>  I padroni Longobardi vengono paragonati a delle fiere braccate, che per la paura sembrano avere i loro caratteristici capelli rossastri dritti. L'agitazione pervade anche l'animo delle donne, che abbandonano l'atteggiamento da padrone e guardano preoccupate i propri figli, pensando al loro destino.<br>  <br>  E appresso ai fuggitivi, con la spada desiderosa di sangue, 25<br>  come cani da caccia sciolti, correndo, frugando,<br>  da destra e da sinistra, arrivano i guerrieri:<br>  il volgo li vede, e estasiato da una contentezza mai provata,<br>  con la galoppante speranza che precorre l'evento,<br>  e sogna la fine della dura schiavitù.<br>  La fuga dei padroni e l'arrivo dei guerrieri longobardi viene paragonata ad una scena di caccia, di fronte alla quale il popolo sogna la liberazione da parte dei soldati stranieri. Da qui comincia ad emergere il pensiero del poeta, finora rimasto estraneo: il sogno è appunto una fantasticheria che non ha nulla a che vedere con la realtà. Si preannuncia dunque l'esito della battaglia per il volgo, che spera in qualcosa che il Manzoni nei versi successivi dimostra come non sia realizzabile.<br>  <br>  Udite! Quei soldati Franchi sul campo di battaglia,<br>  che impediscono la fuga dei vostri tiranni,<br>  sono giunti da lontano, attraverso aspri sentieri:<br>  hanno rinunciato alle gioie dei pranzi festosi,<br>  si alzarono in fretta dai dolci riposi 35<br>  immediatamente chiamati dalle trombe della guerra.<br>  Da questo punto in poi si apre la riflessione del Manzoni sulle infondate speranze di libertà del volgo. Il popolo Franco per giungere in Italia ha rinunciato alla tranquillità del proprio ambiente familiare.<br>  <br>  Lasciarono nelle stanze della casa in cui nacquero<br>  le donne preoccupate, che ripetutamente davano loro l'addio,<br>  con preghiere e consigli interrotti dal pianto:<br>  sulla fronte hanno gli elmi delle passate battaglie, 40<br>  hanno posto le selle sugli scuri cavalli,<br>  corsero sul ponte che risuonava cupamente.<br>  Il poeta prosegue parlando della partenza dei soldati Franchi, delle loro donne preoccupate. L'ultimo verso descrive una tipica immagine medievale: il ponte levatoio che si abbassa per lasciar uscire i soldati dal castello.<br>  <br>  A schiere, passarono di terra in terra,<br>  cantando gioiose canzoni di guerra,<br>  ma con l'animo rivolto ai dolci castelli: 45<br>  per valli petrose, per dirupi,<br>  montarono la guardia durante le gelide notti,<br>  ricordando i fiduciosi colloqui d'amore.<br>  Il tragitto per l'Italia è stato faticoso per i soldati stranieri, nonostante vi sia in loro la gioia di accingersi a combattere per la vittoria. Tutto ciò serve per dimostrare che un esercito non viene da così lontano, attraverso tragitti impervi, per ridare la libertà ad un popolo straniero.<br>  <br>  Sopportarono gli oscuri pericoli di soste forzate,<br>  le corse affannose attraverso luoghi mai attraversati, 50<br>  il rigido comando militare, la fame;<br>  videro le lance scagliate contro i petti,<br>  accanto agli scudi, rasente agli elmetti,<br>  udirono il fischio delle frecce che volavano.<br>  In questi versi il poeta continua ad elencare i pericoli affrontati dai Franchi nella discesa in Italia.<br>  <br>  E il premio sperato, promesso a quei soldati, 55<br>  sarebbe, o delusi, capovolgere le sorti,<br>  porre fine al dolore di un volgo straniero?<br>  Tornate alle vostre superbe rovine,<br>  alle attività pacifiche delle officine riarse, 60<br>  ai campi bagnati dal sudore servile.<br>  Manzoni si rivolge al volgo, destinato a rimanere deluso, poiché non verrà liberato da un popolo partito con l'intento di assoggettarlo.

9EILiQU6aa	certo. ovviamente, oltre ad essere raccomandato, devi essere bravo. cmq funziona così: c'è un posto disponibile, viene indetto un concorso. naturalmente vi può partecipare chiunque, ma titoli necessari sono dottorati e pubblicazioni. di conseguenza, i partecipanti sono in genere interni all'ambiente universitario. il vincitore viene scelto da un collegio di proff universitari, i quali si mettono d'accordo per scegliere un vincitore. se ne deduce che è piuttosto facile che il prescelto vincitore sia effettivamente un pre-scelto...eheheh! <br>  <br>  ps: per raccomandato non intendo un idiota che non sa niente e va avanti solo perché è il figlio di qualcuno. per raccomandato intendo un giovane sveglio, con titoli spendibili, che si mette al seguito del professore(qualche volta addirittura come portaborse) e in alcuni settori fa ricerca  al posto del prof... forse, in questo caso, la raccomandazione (se volete, possiamo chiamarla "segnalazione") è perfino meritata!|`|6e71b535336d4f8db2ba35110e3a3e14aa	Non credo che si possa fare di tutta l'erba un fascio.

Certo, se ti fai conoscere per quanto vali da un docente è meglio, ti può guidare nelle scelte giuste, nelle eventuali pubblicazioni per poter accedere ad un primo conscorso "scuola di dottorato" che dura 3 anni. Dopodiché c'è un secondo concorso per diventare "ricercatori" (e ti conviene aver già scritto almento un libro e tantissimi articoli, e aver svolto seminari e convegni come relatore). Qui si può ancora essere sbattuti fuori e si è arrivati alla veneranda età di 30-35 anni con una paga che non basta nemmeno per campare; dopodiché un altro concorso per "ricercatori confermati" con il quale un minimo posto sicuro lo si ha. Si passa poi al concorso per diventare professori associati (soglia dei 40-50 anni, dipende dalle capacità e possibilità) e infine ordinari (il capo dei capi di una cattedra) ruolo che non tutti potranno coprire nella propria vita, c'è anche chi muore associato. <br>  <br>  Come vedi i passaggi sono tanti per diventare professore universitario per cui la tua teoria può valere fino ad un certo punto. All'inizio forse può capitare ma in corso d'opera non ci sarà sempre un "angioletto custode" che ti aiuta. La meritocrazia (e io per prima la pensavo come te ma mi sono ricreduta negli anni) esiste specialmente per posti così difficili da raggiungere: per sacrifici, anni di studio NON PAGATI (perché non si becca una lira i primi 3 anni, ma anche come ricercatore peni la fame), convegni che si devono tenere in giro per il mondo se vuoi diventare associato o ordinario (PROFESSORE, come dici tu) e se non vali almeno un po' nessuno professore "amico" si rovinerebbe la reputazione per aiutarti!<br>  <br>  Poi è ovvio che se negli anni hai lavorato bene oramai il tuo nome sarà sulla bocca di tutti all'interno dell'ambiente universitario italiano e straniero e a quel punto non diventi "professore" grazie ad un amico, ma grazie al tuo impegno.<br>  <br>  P.S. ciò non toglie che alcuni professori sono figli, di figli, di figli. Ma quelli esistono anche nel concorso alle Poste, al Comune, per i call center...

4Y89Al6yaa	In my Psychology class we learned to not study too much at once.  Read a little bit from your chapter, get up and do something for a while and then come back to study some more.  In my personal opinion what has helped me is if I study before I got to bed every night.  I feel I remember more of what I have read and the reasoning, in my opinion, is if I study during the day and then go about my business with this or that.  I essentially forget some of what I have learned.  Whereas when I read before I go to bed, I then go to sleep, wake up and seem to remember more.  Sounds crazy...but it's what works for me.|`|Ug7Om1qyaa	make flash cards.<br>  keep in pocket.<br>  when bored pull out and<br>  look over. Active STUDYING!

RaXCko4saa	The Israeli-Palestinian conflict stems from competing Jewish and Arab national aspirations for the region, conflicting promises by the British in the forms of the Hussein-McMahon Correspondence and the Balfour Declaration of 1917, and several outbreaks of violence between Jewish and Arab residents of the region of Palestine.<br>  <br>  The roots of the conflict can be traced to the late 19th century, with a rise in national movements, including Zionism and Arab nationalism. Zionism, the Jewish national movement, was established as a political movement in 1897, largely as a response to Russian and European anti-Semitism. It sought the establishment of a Jewish Nation-State in Palestine (a region known to the Jews by the name of the historical Jewish homeland, Eretz Israel) so that they might find sanctuary and self-determination there. To this end, the World Zionist Organization and the Jewish National Fund encouraged immigration and funded purchase of land, both under Ottoman rule and under British rule, in the region of PalestineFollowing World War I and the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire, Palestine came under the control of the United Kingdom through the Sykes-Picot Agreement and a League of Nations mandate, known as the British Mandate for Palestine. During the Mandatory period, the British made conflicting promises to both populations in the forms of the Hussein-McMahon Correspondence and the Balfour Declaration of 1917, and tensions between Arab and Jewish groups in the region erupted into physical violence as in the 1920 Palestine riots, the 1921 Palestine riots, the 1929 Hebron massacre and the 1936-1939 Arab revolt in Palestine.<br>  <br>  The British responded to these outbreaks of violence with the Haycraft Commission of Inquiry, the Shaw Report, the Peel Commission of 1936-1937, and the White Paper of 1939. The Peel Commission proposed a failed partition plan, while the White Paper sought a one-state solution and established a quota for Jewish immigration set by the British in the short-term and by the Arab population in the long-term. Both Arab and Jewish groups directed violence against the British, as in the 1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine, the King David Hotel bombing, and the assassinations of Lord Moyne and Count Bernadotte, in order to expel the Mandatory government, which was held in contempt by both sides.<br>  <br>  This violence and the heavy cost of World War II led Britain to turn the issue of Palestine over to the United Nations. In 1947, the U.N. approved the partition of the British Mandate of Palestine into two states: one Jewish and one Arab. The Jewish leadership accepted the plan, but Palestinian Arab leaders, supported by the Arab League, rejected the plan, and a civil war broke out. Israel quickly gained the upper hand in this intercommunal fighting and declared its independence on May 14 1948. Five Arab League countries (Egypt, Lebanon, Syria, Transjordan and Iraq) then invaded Palestine, starting the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The war resulted in an Israeli victory, with Israel capturing additional territory beyond the partition borders but leaving Jerusalem as a divided city; the territory Israel did not capture was taken over by the Arab League countries. The war also resulted in the 1948 Palestinian exodus, known to Palestinians as Al-Naqba.<br>  For decades after 1948, Arab governments had refused to recognize Israel, and in 1964 the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) was founded with the central tenet that Palestine, with its original Mandate borders, is the indivisible homeland of the Arab Palestinian people. In turn, Israel refused to recognize the PLO as a negotiating partner.<br>  <br>  In the Six-Day War in 1967, Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan, the Gaza Strip from Egypt, and East Jerusalem—including the Old City and its holy sites—which Israel annexed and reunited with the western neighborhoods of Jerusalem. The status of the city as Israel's capital and the occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip created a new set of contentious issues which became one major focus of the conflict.<br>  <br>  In 1970, the PLO was expelled from Jordan, in what was known as the Black September. Large numbers of Palestinians moved into Lebanon after the Black September, joining the thousands already there.<br>  <br>  In 1973 a coalition of Arab states led by Egypt and Syria launched the Yom Kippur War against Israel. The Egyptians and Syrians advanced during the first 24–48 hours, after which momentum began to swing in Israel's favor. Eventually a ceasefire took effect that ended the war. This war paved the way for the Camp David Accords in 1978, which set a precedent for future peace negotiations<br>  Tensions between Israel and the PLO led Israel to invade Lebanon in the 1982 Lebanon War,[15] forcing the PLO to withdraw again, this time to Tunisia. During the war, Israeli allies Phalangists committed the Sabra and Shatila massacre, in which 700-3,500 unarmed Palestinians were killed by the Phalange while the Israel

yx7030Ccaa	What is a Magnet school?<br>  <br>  A Magnet school is part of the public school system. Usually students are zoned into their schools based on location. Students mostly go to the school which they are closest to (this may not always be true since boundaries can seem arbitrary). With Magnet schools, the public school system has created schools that exist outside of zoned school boundaries. The point of them is that they usually have something special to offer over a regular school which makes attending them an attractive choice to many students, thereby increasing the diversity of the student population within them (in theory).<br>  <br>  Magnet schools are different from private or parochial schools in that they remain part of the public school system. They differ from Charter schools in that they remain part of the public school system bureaucratically. Charter Schools have a different organizational model (i.e. they have a charter that releases them from the regular school administration). Magnet schools operate under the same public school administration (they don’t operate on their own).<br>  <br>  Distinguishing them from other public schools, Magnet schools usually have alternative or otherwise compelling modes of instruction. For example, you might find a Montessori Magnet school. A school doesn’t have to be a Magnet school to be a Montessori School. There are also public schools that aren’t Magnet schools which still offer fine academic experiences. Magnet schools differ from other public schools in that they receive additional funding to enable them to spend more money on their students, supplies, teachers, programs, etc.<br>  Magnet schools have three distinguishing characteristics:<br>   <br>  <br>  Distinctive curriculum or instructional approach <br>  Attract students from outside an assigned neighborhood attendance zone <br>  Have diversity as an explicit purpose|`|eNMRIKL6aa	I attended both. The magnet schools require aptitude test scores to be at a certain level before you are accepted. Public schools go by grades and where you live.

2646a4e9d6d4e936660d70ff922397f3aa	No.  It means just what it sounds like - the school doesn't give degrees.  That may mean that they give certificates, or it may just mean that if you had a degree in something else, their classes could supplement it.  However, if you are thinking of going into this field of work and don't already have a degree, I would avoid that place.

Use complete sentences along with correct spelling, grammar, and punctuation. If the teacher wants it typed, be sure to use the right font and size. All these things affect your grade. Good luck with your book report.|`|Uagg9UsFaa	It can sound however you want, but you should include:<br>  1) title of book<br>  2) author<br>  3) what your favorite part was<br>  4) connect a part of the story to another book, movie, or real life.<br>  5) explain the book using beginning, middle, end format.<br>  6) a part you didn't like so much and why<br>  7) correct punctuation and grammer and spelling and capitals letters<br>  8) don't repeat the same words to many times, use synonyms
a026d4b14e3c0dc3fbbe97a76351c0f3aa	Unfortunatley if you are still in school uniform/arriving at school/leaving school then they have a right to complain to the headmaster.<br>  <br>  The way you are disciplined would be affected.  I think the mother must not have realised what she did and just thought you were randomly cussing her.  Speak to your headmaster, start at the beginning and let them know that you meant it in response to her actions.  Let them know that this is not normally a response you would use, but you were wet and cold after a drenching.  It's better to say your'e sorry and get it over with, teachers only get miffed if they have to ask you to apologise.  Obviously the more you mean it, the less your punishment may be [you may even get away with just an apology].|`|JMJsCU1vaa	they can only do what you allow them to do, deny the incident, demand an apology and refuse any punishment and walk out... stand up for your rights and make the first decision of the rest of your life.. <br>  Of course they'lll tell you that kids don't have rights, and I say... Bull-hockey... and you might quote some constitutional law to let them think about it...<br>  tell them; <br>  You have the right to come and go as you free please, without being detained, provided you haven't given clear evidence you've committed a crime, or are conspiring to do so.... <br>  This person claims something that cannot be proven and is her word against yours, stick to your story and then walk out...|`|5ZbFdcwdaa	they can punish you for something that happens outside of school. there are lots of incidents involving rude comments on msn at my school that you can get into  a lot of trouble for.<br>  But don't worry explain the situation and if they still want to punish you tell them it is actually illegal to splash a pedestrian (if you are from the UK) and that you could technically sue this woman and won't accept the punishment.<br>  hope i helped! good luck!!|`|akEA02Ataa	The school have to listen to the mum.<br>  Yet, you can also tell the truth that the mum were passing by you without say anything. The mum should also apologize you. <br>  <br>  This is fair, eh? Still...you shouldn't swear at her, which can be responsible for students because they represent for the school.|`|294db1e52bf0162d7d7ff79b4102975faa	It depends on the school. If it is a private school especially, they can do whatever they want. I had a student give me the finger and I informed the principal and he got in trouble.|`|KgQ6DHWiaa	Were you wearing school uniform? I f you were, you're screwed. They always have this lame thing going on about being a good 'representative of the school'.|`|B24W8w43aa	Just say the facts.|`|Mdk7DmiAaa	Depending on the laws of your state, district, etc, yes you may be punished for poor behavior if the actions can be tied to the school in any way.  This protects students the whole day.  Since you had not made it home first, the school is still your 'guardian' therefore they can punish you.  Although any administrator worth their salt would chalk this up to classic anger and angst.  The most they should do is verbally slap your wrist, and send you on your way with just a bit of chastising.  <br>  <br>  You should bring your parents into the situation.  Also, do not wash the dress so you can use it as evidence in your defense.|`|c29e52663578aeb446d60cfbde61aa2daa	You will not get a school punishment for this as the event took place outside school. Without getting worried, you should have the courage to explain to the School authorities what happened and why you reacted in such a way. Learning a few pro-active skills would help you to keep cool and handle such situations in a matured way.|`|7AUqSr4uaa	just tell them what happened.<br>  <br>  they probably understand why you swore, but if someone makes a complaint they have to do something about it, they'll more than likely just tell you not to do that sort of thing again.|`|rqASGeevaa	I think you'll be warned or something. I don't think they can punish you though as it didn't actually happen in school. They'll probably just ask for you to apologise to her or something.|`|T1lqlNrmaa	yes you can be punished as you were traveling from school and as such you are still representing the school. Calmly explain the situation and you may get away with a warning or detention.<br>  good luck|`|MzMb7CeZaa	You have no problem. This girl has. She washed your dress out and did not apologise. You did not swear. You said. " Oh how terrible" the girl is lying. Get her expelled soon .|`|hOTrfGHEaa	they may say something but it happened outside school so they cant do anything|`|ibOcr3Deaa	technically you shouldn't. But nowdays people will take this verbal 'attack' as an part of your attitude. They will probably tell you something like.. We don't want someone here who expresses anger in this way. And they would naturally assume you are likely to do this again inside school. They may also fear for your attitude towards the classmate, specially as its his/her mum. <br>  <br>  You might just get a warning, but im not sure how strict your school is. <br>  Once this girl slapped me round the face on the way home, my dad foned the school and the girl got sent into the office. They made us talk and sort out the differences. <br>  So you might be asked to apologise to the woman. fingers crossed thats all your asked to do.|`|ZzT8RKLRaa	Deny culpability Accuse driver of negligence suggest a deliberate act in soaking your dress.The driver should have slowed/down stopped in order to prevent you dress being completely destroyed lol <br>  <br>  One case in the Uk Courts has already determined it can be an assault if you can prove your soaking was due to recklessness|`|gOF1wJLFaa	It depends what type of school it is. If it's a private school, they can pretty much do what they want. If it's a public school, they probably will not care too much.<br>  <br>  Remember though, it is just going to come down to your word vs. hers. They can't prove that you did anything wrong. And you didn't. Curse words are arbitrary and ridiculous. Whoever thinks that it is wrong to say certain words is an idiot. Don't let them punish you for something as stupid as that.

Sz2p6AIFaa	Why has your daughter drop out? Maybe you should address that first. Perhaps the traditional high school route isn't for her. Although that is what you would want her to do, perhaps it would be better if she went about things a different way.<br>  <br>  She could always get a GED. I dropped out of high school at 17 and immediately earned my GED (without even having to study). My score was pretty impressive and I went right into business school and then the working world. <br>  <br>  Maybe your daughter doesn't fit in well with others at her school. Maybe the whole high school atmosphere gets on her nerves. The only way to find out would be to ask her why she's dropped out. She may succeed (and be happier) doing things differently.|`|jHmepKRMaa	Tell her if she doesn't go back and graduate she can get a job and start paying room and board,or hit the road.

5zhAdR1raa	Whether or not you can minor in them depends on the requirements of your school for a minor. For that, you need to talk to your advisor. <br>  <br>  As to the difference, I would think the literature minor would be heavy on just literature of different types, whereas English includes literature, but also encompasses composition, grammar, etc, and as such is broader. But, if you are majoring in writing, then why do you need a minor in English? What I have seen is that minors are mostly in related but different fields - like I did a minor in Math when doing my MS in Astronomy. My daughter did a minor in Women's Studies, when doing her BA in Communications. <br>  <br>  Talk to your advisor!

btridfokaa	Peace be with you young lady,<br>  Forgive me please if this is too long but I have typed it all now. It would be good for you to read whether you read a little or a lot.<br>  <br>  The devil like to frighten us.<br>  <br>  Do you obey your parents? I know a family with eight children and the one who is least obedient has the worst nightmares.<br>  <br>  If you wake up because of a nightmare, pray and ask the Lord of the universe to protect you from bad dreams and in His love to grant you a peaceful sleep. Also ask Him to guide you to all the depths of His wonderful mysteries in the true Faith which was once delivered to the saints (St Jude 3). Here are some words you may find helpful if you can not think of what to say:<br>  "As I lay me down to sleep,<br>  I pray thee Lord my soul to keep.<br>  If I die before I wake,<br>  I pray thee Lord my soul to take."<br>  Of course you can say whatever you like though.<br>  <br>  The following is a true story which might interest you:<br>  A long time ago in the city of Antioch there was a young boy whose parents were wealthy pagans. When he turned ten his parents thought he was old enough to start practising their religion so they brought him before a cow and told him to worship it. The young boy started crying. Although his parents were upset, they figured that he must simply have been too young for religion still. Later that day, the boy sat on his bed thinking about who God might be. He was pretty sure the cow his parents showed him was not the real God. He looked up at the sun and saw how wonderful its brightness was and thought of how all living things depend on the sun. So he said, "Sun, are you God?" Then an angel appeared to him and told him that the sun was not God but that he would come to know the true God and that he would shed his blood for His sake. Later on the boy became a Christian, converted his parents and was martyred by the cruel Roman Emperor Diocletian.<br>  <br>  Why did I tell you this story? God's angels are always around us whether we know they are there or not. If we need God's protection, we can ask him. Remember that there are more angels who obey God than devils. The angels of little children always behold the face of God in heaven.<br>  God might allow bad things to happen to us but we must remember that sometimes these things happen for our sake and sometimes they happen for the sake of others. Perhaps God has allowed the devil to give you bad dreams so that you might learn to pray longer before you go to bed?<br>  <br>  No matter how much or how little you pray, when you do, please remember to pray for me for I am a sinner.<br>  <br>  Thank you.<br>  <br>  ~~~<br>  On a side note, have you ever heard that Joseph Smith appointed James Strang to be his successor? For more information please see: <a href="http://www.churchofjesuschristoflatterdaysaints.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.churchofjesuschristoflatterda...</a> <br>  (Please be aware that I do not endorse the religious views of the group which originally called itself the "Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints" however their assertions regarding Smith's appointment of Strang are valid and historically accurate.)<br>  ~~~<br>  <br>  P.S. When the boy in the story above became a Christian he was given the name of Philotheus which means "lover of God".

z2BnPqO1aa	Well, by the definition of a collective good, it cannot be diminished, and it must be available to all citizens.  Since it is a public place, I believe that smoking takes away the enjoyability of that place. Such as a park.  But as far as banning a restaurant from allowing smokers, that is bull spit.  As soon as the government steps in and starts telling business owners how to run a business there is a line that is crossed.  Take large liberal cities for instance.

He’d like it to come off naturally, which means they shouldn’t be too loud, or gesticulate (make gestures) too much, as bad actors often do. Instead, they should use their discretion to build up suspense with their actions.<br>  <br>  ?  Most importantly, they shouldn’t be tempted to get a cheap laugh, as this is applauded by the most foolish members of the audience and might drown out the important parts.

If you can hold off graduating and try to bring your GPA up.  I'd talk to your academic adviser and see what they suggest because you would need a 3.5 for grad school.  If it's possible to do a "replace grade" option with a few of your bad courses then take advantage of that.  At my college you can do 3.  <br>  <br>  Hopefully, they'll have more ideas but, if you really wan to do grad school then I'd try to bring the GPA up.  Also, you can talk to admission dept at grad school and see what they say for your other options.  They deal w/ this on a daily basis so they should have ideas to help you.  Don't be worried about asking for help.  Don't give up.  If you have dreams go for them!  Try to get as much info from as many perspectives as possible.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!

bFfWFsFWaa	I grew up in a tiny tiny town (150 people) where pretty much all of us were poor. At the most...I had three sets of clothes.<br>  One for school<br>  One for playing and work<br>  And one for church. <br>   That was how it was from my childhood till high school. We only had one meal a day (dinner) at my house, and usually the school gave me lunch and breakfast depending on the day of the week.<br>  <br>  I think overall it's made me a stronger person (Cliche answer, I know). I've learned to concentrate on other things besides materials. Although my town was mostly poor, I was amongst the poorest. I got made fun of A LOT. By high school, I learned to just ignore it and laugh along with them. I think that's changed me a lot.

It is frequently read in American high school and college literature classes. A celebrated Hollywood film version, starring Henry Fonda and directed by John Ford, was made in 1940; however, the endings of the book and the movie differ greatly.<br>  <br>  Steinbeck wrote The Grapes of Wrath at his home, 16250 Greenwood Lane, in what is now Monte Sereno, California. Set during the Great Depression, the novel focuses on a poor family of sharecroppers, the Joads, driven from their home by drought, economic hardship, and changes in the agriculture industry. In a nearly hopeless situation, they set out for California's Central Valley along with thousands of other "Okies" in search of land, jobs, and dignity.<br>  <br>  The narrative begins from Tom Joad's point of view just after he is paroled from prison for homicide. On his journey home, he meets a now-former preacher, Jim Casy, whom he remembers from his childhood, and the two travel together. When they arrive at his childhood farm home, they find it deserted. Disconcerted and confused, he and Casy go to his Uncle John's home nearby where he finds his family loading a converted Hudson truck with what remains of their possessions; the crops were destroyed in the Dust Bowl and as a result, the family had to default on their loans. With their farm repossessed, the Joads seek solace in hope; hope inscribed on the handbills which are distributed everywhere in Oklahoma, describing the beautiful and fruitful country of California and high pay to be had in that state. The Joads, along with Jim Casy, are seduced by this advertising and invest everything they have into the journey. Although leaving Oklahoma would be breaking parole, Tom decides that it is a risk, albeit minimal, that he has to take.<br>  <br>  While en route, they discover that all of the roads and the highways are saturated with other families who are also making the same trek, ensnared by the same promise. As the Joads continue on their journey and hear many stories from others, some coming from California, they are forced to confront the possibility that their prospects may not be what they hoped. This realization, supported by the deaths of Grandpa and Grandma and the departure of Noah (the eldest Joad son) and Connie (the husband of the pregnant Joad daughter, Rose of Sharon), is forced from their thoughts: they must go on because they have no choice--there is nothing remaining for them in Oklahoma.<br>  <br>  Upon arrival, they find little hope of finding a decent wage, as there is an oversupply of labor and a lack of rights, and the big corporate farmers are in collusion. The tragedy lies in the simplicity and impossibility of their dream: a house, a family, and a steady job. A gleam of hope is presented at Weedpatch, in one of the clean, utility-supplied camps operated by the Resettlement Administration, a New Deal agency that tried to help the migrants, but there is not enough money and space to care for all of the needy.<br>  <br>  In response to the exploitation of laborers, the workers begin to join unions. The surviving members of the family unknowingly work as strikebreakers on an orchard involved in a strike that eventually turns violent, killing the preacher Casy and forcing Tom Joad to kill again and become a fugitive. He bids farewell to his mother, promising that no matter where he runs, he will be a tireless advocate for the oppressed. Rose of Sharon's baby is stillborn; however, Ma Joad remains steadfast and forces the family through the bereavement. In the end, Rose of Sharon commits the only act in the book that is not futile: she breast feeds a starving man, still trying to show hope in humanity after her own negative experience. This final act is said to illustrate the spontaneous mutual sharing that will lead to a new awareness of collective values.<br>  <br>  <br>  I agree with the captain-b, the story believe in hope on humanity whatever bitter somebody's poor experiences|`|uzeKqH0Taa	people lives are changed with poverty they appreciate things Alto better. my father he came from poverty and he had his hard times. he came to America a 30 years ago with nothing he had to travel from place to place in search of a job he sleep anywhere. he first lived in a van with 3 other people and two people sleep ed on the back and one of the steering wheel. then after wood they bought a piece of land and he build a shack by himself and he sleep their. he said he felt like if he was in a co fin because the place was so small. afterward he saved up his money and he bought his own van he then put a ma tress in it and bought one of those old television and stayed their that was his home. after wood he upgraded and lived with 10 people in one house. to him this was a lot because he had a roof on top of him not a car he then lived in a back house and later own bought his own house and know he owns two homes and makes about 60,000 a year.coming to America with nothing really changed him as his daughter he Always reminded to appreciate everything that i had he said that when he was back in Mexico he wished he had the pair a shoes i have. he said they would pro bally jump him for wearing really nice shoes. poverty changes people it just the way people take it some people stay in poverty and other people like my father find it as an opportunity to improve their life's.|`|PwZZJh1taa	one never really knows what one is capable of doing until faced with this situation. every situation is different, a single male may go without opposed to a single parent may find themselves needing to provide. both may turn to stealing or begging. shelters are full and unforunatly this is reality for many|`|DXZK6eMNaa	Try not eating for a few days, and see how your life changes.|`|l0RVQn0Faa	People in the so called developed world do not understand poverty. There are no doubt people in the term poverty in the developed world but nothing can compare to the absolute poverty of the under developed world. I think people who are plunged into poverty eg after economic crisis from the developed world learn the hard lesson of appreciating life and what is really important in life. A great deal of teenagers and young people could do with a lesson in this. On what really counts. However those who are born into a poor society accept their fate and often they are happy and content because they have seen no better. Once they know the materialistic things that could be theirs then discontent starts in. But there are other forms of poverty such as spiritual poverty, family poverty and these are serious issues too|`|da2d7eb7cef6b044d21ade00715906bdaa	WoW loaded question!!!  People react in different ways. We have the "why me", 'mad at the whole world", or just plain mad and never happy, because if I feel bad well I need company and only those who are yes people. Now we have those who "okay it will not be like this forever", "make the best of it", put on a brave face, while thinking what am I going to eat or feed my kids and (hubby\wife). So it depends what group you are in. Those who make the best of it become involved in how to make it easier for those who run out of food, no money for the seasons we have here. Doing this makes one feel good about helping out others in the same boat and in these groups everybody learns something. Families work together to keep food on the table and clothes for all the different weather we have, seem to fight not as much as those who blame it on everybody else. Some find taking 1 day at a time makes it easier to cope with a bit of bad luck that came their way. Now for those who can not cope at all. You will fight those who blame it on everybody or somebody and that leaves them feeling sorry for themself and look to someone who will listen and agree with all the anger their have. Some find it so much easier to just give up, leaving them the tpye of people not trying to make life smother just goes out the window, leaving them not caring about themself or families. Why should their do anything when you find out about places who help with everything one can think about, and the end result this will how you get in that deep hole and you just stay as why should their try after hearing NO when job hunting, looking for food for that day or how do I get the clothes clean. Poverty can destory dreams, hope , trust and families. As we all know about the children who are always hungry, no warm clothes or bathing suit, and the list goes on. Poverty takes you down and sometimes real fast. It is not easy as it is a real hard life and that alone can really change. The young children and teens suffer without saying to much and just keeps it to themself, as their have learned that parent(s)  who when fighting forget about who is listening and too young. So what can and sometimes does -  leaving home and then living like mom or dad

4ab2ea36c0069d71d94055356c32ea00aa	Here's what it sounds like....you're trying too hard.<br>  <br>  When a child this age is afraid of an adult, talking to them will usually make the situation worse.  I'm not saying completely ignore this girl, but if you're trying to talk her down and it's not working and she's getting more upset, it's probably best to hand her a stuffed animal and walk away to work with the rest of the children and keep a close eye on her.  What will usually happen is she will then feel more safe, watching you with the other children and knowing that she's allowed to be upset in the room.  She'll start to warm up to you much more quickly.<br>  <br>  Be sure to discuss that plan with your supervisors first so they understand what is happening in case they walk by the room and see you are working with other children with a screaming 3 year old.  It's easier to explain ahead of time than later.<br>  <br>  I work in Taiwan and it is often difficult with the 3 year olds here when they first start.  They're not used to the rules, the teacher I work with is not much help in that regard, and the children often get upset with me when they first meet me because I won't let them run through other children's work or throw the materials around.  I have to stop them and have probably less Chinese than you have Spanish, so I understand your frustration.  You just have to remain calm and know that there may be a few days that the child feels very uncomfortable around you.  Step back, let the child feel uncomfortable, but still protect them and offer them support and a smile when you can.  Once she realizes you're safe, she will really warm up to you.<br>  <br>  I've had many children this age act similar to how you're describing.  It's just a matter of you being different and it scares them a little.  I've found the best way is to give them space, give them support, and keep pouring love towards all the children in the class.  If it's a good environment, she will soon relax and be on track with you.|`|2mTC4wVkaa	It is very difficult because of the language barrier.  You could try reading some appealing children's books.

Maybe you have to learn some Spanish words, and she has to learn some English words.<br>  If there is a computer in the room with a children;s drawing program, you could try that, also.  good luck!!|`|buUIYQPCaa	I feel bad for you.  I have many years experience working with young children, and it is very frustrating when I can't seem to build a working relationship with a child.  Plus, I'm sure the language barrier isn't helping with the situation.  Have you tried talking with the parents or grandmother, with help from an interpreter if necessary?  They may be able to help.  Tell them that you are experienced with young children and you've never had such a hard time building a rapport before.  Tell them it makes you feel sad and confused and you really want to help the child feel comfortable and happy while in your care.  Ask about favorite songs, games, or books.  Also, ask someone to explain to the child that you would like to improve your Spanish and ask her to help you learn, and help you talk to her little brother.  Maybe you can enlist her as an "assistant" that way and help build a relationship that way.  I wish you the best of luck with the situation.  I hope you are able to work it out.

The use here is "render" as "give" ( e.g. render unto Caesar that which is ...). <br>  <br>  The owner of the company must fund the company sufficiently to operate. The intent is to preclude companies being set up merely as shells to be sued in the event of liability but without assets.<br>  <br>   The original case about this was a taxicab company that incorporated each of its cabs individually so as to avoid having to have liability insurance, figuring that the loss of one cab would be the most it could lose in any liability action. In this case, the concept of "piercing the corporate veil" was introduced so that the victims of an accident could sue the owners of the overall company. You can only incorporate individual units when there is enough capital behind each unit for it to function as a stand-alone entity. This would then be available for a suit for damages against the unit only.

The Han Dynasty was ruled by the family known as the Liu clan who had peasant origins. The reign of the Han Dynasty, lasting over 400 years, is commonly considered within China to be one of the greatest periods in the history of China. To this day, the ethnic majority of China still refer to themselves as the "Han people".<br>  <br>  During the Han Dynasty, China officially became a Confucian state and prospered domestically: agriculture, handicrafts and commerce flourished, and the population reached over 56 million people. Paper was invented during this period. The idea of Acupunture (the method of piercing the body with needles in certain pressure points to relieve stress), Feng Shua , and even the world's first instrument used to track earthquakes was invented during this time. Meanwhile, the empire extended its political, cultural influence, and territory over much of Korea, Mongolia, Vietnam, and Central Asia before it finally collapsed under a combination of domestic and external pressures.|`|t9ZiEJYfaa	Paper was one of the invention.

a01a4c7fa42d359ddf53eaa686c7f84faa	Any plant community naturally undergoes a process known as succession, in which species native to a given ecological area move in and make use of the area.  Typically succession for any area follows a roughly predictable pattern where opportunistic species move in first, but are later supplanted by other species which are better adapted to utilize the resources of the area for the long term.  This process ultimately results in what is called the climax community, where the predominant species which are found in any ecosystem take over and occupy the niches in the community, unless they are disturbed by catastrophic natural events or the activities of men.  Since a school field and a parking lot are not natural, but rather are human creations, and are directly affected by the activities of humans, such as the artificial planting of shrubs, trees, and flowers in or around such areas, then what you see when they are in active use by people is an artificial ecosystem, which may not continue to exist once the forces maintaining their artificiality are removed.  So, when these areas are allowed to remain fallow for an extended period of time, without the influence of human activity forcing their development in an unnatural way, they revert to their natural development patterns, and the forces of succession take over again.<br>  <br>  Look up the terms "ecological succession" and "climax community" online.  They will help you understand what is going on when you observe this sort of phenomenon.|`|j0zDQQG2aa	No one is there to care for it if there is no use of that area.|`|NwmOMtrgaa	One reason is because after a while, the plants in that area that are already there begin to overgrow and take over again, not to mention the new plants that grow from birds and other animals dropping seeds into the area. <br>  One reason animals stay out of inhabited areas is because of the scent of humans. This scent scares them, and so they keep away. After a while that scent dies away and animals begin to venture back into the abandoned area. There's also no odd activities or machines to scare them away.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps somewhat.|`|pWFiFTkJaa	Human inteference in a natural environment changes the way plants and animals live and grow. Without humans in an area for a long time, animals can get back to claiming the territory as their own without the worry of humans coming by. Plants can spread out without having borders set up from fences, cement, or constant tires passing by. Animals can use empty areas as habitats for them and their young. Basically they begin to re-populate the area, much like humans do after a natural disaster.

Only the Natives knew the way, but they had been outnumbered by soldiers and since then, the modern people only heard stories of it that had been passed down from their ancestors.<br>  <br>  The mountain stood there alone recalling the memories that he had when the Natives were around, he longed to see someone come by but all was gone in the Shari forest.<br>  <br>  It's people, the animals, the colour and life had been drained. Generations and generations had passed, the mountain still looking as strong as ever, but becoming more and more impatient as it had waited years to be accompanied.<br>  <br>  He saw a sign of promise and felt it too, that he was going to have a friend. That promise seemed as though it was going to happen in a light year, for Alcampo waited and waited long enough but impatiently. Alcampo had eventually given birth to a long stretch of sea which was the most unique one to be seen.<br>  <br>  Now the forest was filled with glee, for the stories the sea had to tell were most interesting. Visitors like the birds had come to listen and told these stories in their songs. The harmony accompanied by the melody which the birds sang made the forest and nearby places dance with joy. <br>  <br>  The once lifeless forest was now so lively that people had gotten close to tracking down the location of the mountain because they thought voices could be heard in the distance. The only voice that they heard was the wind, not mourning but cheerfully sharing the tales.<br>  <br>  The deep barren trenches that had seemed to lead to nowhere, was now a river forcing out all the water from the bowels of its source. Just standing on the bank it looked like it was rushing to meet its prey before it had time to escape. Other persons said that the water was as clear as crystal that you could see all the living and those that were underneath its glassy surface. <br>  The people had considered it to be the most dangerous river and ordered that it should not be used for recreational nor transportation purposes.<br>  <br>  The river was going about its business until it was disturbed by two mischievous boys. They had run away from their village looking for great adventure which seemed to be great danger instead. <br>  They carved a boat out of a fallen tree trunk. They used the river as transportation to lead them away from their people regardless of the dangers which lay ahead. The water became fierce halfway through their journey and the boat had now been filled with water. <br>  They were going under but their efforts to survive proved futile. They had been swallowed up like Jonah and the whale.<br>  <br>  The river had nothing to do with the lives lost. The villagers came by in search of the boys so that the river to give them hope washed upon its bank the two lifeless bodies. The whole village was filled with grief and the river reminds many of the tragedy which took place. <br>  <br>  Archaeologists followed their way to the mouth of the river and it led them to the sea; a sea with a mountain behind. <br>  Now the secret of the mountain was revealed. The sea was safe but not its rivers and they used it for tourism and as a means of getting to the Alcampo. <br>  <br>  The originality and history stored behind the mountain was all gone after its discovery but pride was what was left.<br>  <br>  Generations and generations had more tales to tell. One of these was the tragedy of the two boys. When this story is told to children it teaches them a lesson not to play with mother nature for she will fight back and give you what she thinks you deserve.<br>  <br>  <br>  You made a few errors with punctuation (mainly commas), don't forget to include paragraphs, a huge chunk of writing is not only difficult to read, but also shows the candidate doesn't know how to use paragraphs.<br>  Otherwise, it was very good, well done!

The added energy can be from light, electricity, friction, a chemical reaction, nuclear reaction, or any other kind of energy. When first added to a substance, energy might be concentrated in one atom, but this one will soon bump into others and spread the energy. Eventually, every atom or molecule in the substance will move a bit faster. When the added energy is spread throughout a substance, it is then called heat energy, thermal energy, or, simply heat. All three terms mean the same thing. Heat is a form of energy, so it has the units of energy. In the SI system, this is Joules. Many other units to measure thermal energy are in common use. Calories and BTU's are common heat units. <br>  <br>  Temperature <br>  You cannot measure heat directly, but you can detect its effect on a substance. Changes in heat can usually be detected as changes in temperature. Usually, when you add energy to a bunch of atoms they move faster and get hotter. Similarly, if you remove energy from a bunch of atoms, they usually move less and get cooler. <br>  <br>  Heat is the thermal energy transferred from one object to another due to differences in temperature. (Some texts do not make a distinction between heat and thermal energy. The distinction between heat and thermal energy need not be emphasized to the same extent as that between heat and temperature.)<br>  <br>   Another answer:<br>  <br>  Heat energy is measured in joules.<br>  There is no direct method used to measure heat. Indirect methods must be used.<br>  Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the molecules of a substance.<br>  Temperature can be measured with a thermometer.<br>  One way a thermometer can be calibrated is by the amount of thermal expansion and contraction that occurs within a given type of substance.<br>  The termometers are limited by the physical properties of the substance from which they are made. (i.e., An alcohol thermometer is of little use above the boiling point of alcohol, and a mercury thermometer will not be of any use below the freezing point of mercury.)<br>  <br>  The Celsius scale is commonly used to measure temperature. Its scale has been calibrated to the physical properties of pure water. The normal freezing point of water was arbitrarily set as 0 °C and the normal boiling point of water was arbitrarily set at 100 °C. Arithmetic gradations represent uniform temperature changes on the scale.<br>  <br>  <br>  The Kelvin scale, also called the Absolute scale, sets 0 K as absolute zero. (-273.15 °C) Temperature increases on the scale are the same as on the Celsius scale (1 K = 1 C°).<br>  To convert from Celsius to Kelvin:<br>  K = °C + 273|`|zytYgcr7aa	Temperature is normally used as a noun and heat is commonly used as a verb.<br>  You would say: What is the temperature oustide?<br>                   not: What is the heat outside?<br>  <br>  hope it helps.

I feel for you because I hear how difficult reading first can be. From a clinical standpoint, I have found that small groups of children do enjoy games. You can make adaptations to tons of board games and even have specific goals for each child. For instance, you could play a memory game. Each child could be assigned a color card (that has their reading level on the other side). They could work together to match their word/phrase/sentence to the corresponding picture. You could play any simple board game like Candy Land and incorporate reading goals before each child can progress to a new spot on the game board. I also think group reading, and Im sure you agree, is one of the best ways to target new reading goals.

NQoyw4T5aa	I possibly saw something to this effect on the History Channel a while back, but I thought it was the Japanese during WWII who were working on using microwaves as a weapon. The concept had no practical results. While you could set up laboratory conditions that might result in “kills,” when it came to using the concepts on the battlefield, nothing came of it. Probably has to do with the fact that a heck of a lot of energy would have to be used to produce microwaves with killing strength, and the fact that they don’t travel long distances well, a. A lot of research was wasted--research that might have gone into developing atomic weaponry that MIGHT have been effective.|`|44b085e2e4dc823b257a39078594b57faa	I would have guessed Tesla... but I got this from wikipedia:<br>  <br>  The existence of electromagnetic waves, of which microwaves are part of the frequency spectrum, was predicted by James Clerk Maxwell in 1864 from his equations. In 1888, Heinrich Hertz was the first to demonstrate the existence of electromagnetic waves by building an apparatus that produced and detected microwaves in the UHF region. The design necessarily used horse-and-buggy materials, including a horse trough, a wrought iron point spark, Leyden jars, and a length of zinc gutter whose parabolic cross-section worked as a reflection antenna. In 1894 J. C. Bose publicly demonstrated radio control of a bell using millimetre wavelengths, and conducted research into the propagation of microwaves.<br>  <br>  No. The Nazis never invented the Microwave.|`|EtODXZLvaa	That's definitely not true. Go here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave</a> and look under discovery. :) It says a man by the name of James Clerk Maxwell predicted it, and Heinrich Hertz was the first to demonstrate it.
LI9bsSVIaa	It is a method used by crime investigators to view the features of evidence that are not visible by general observation.  They use the high magnification provided by microscopes for the collection of evidence provided by fibers found on the victim. They use this magnification to reveal the proof that the missile of a fire arm actually came from that weapon.  Just think about the term: forensic, ( dead), the purpose of a microscope, ( provides the ability of the investigator to collect subtle proof of evidence), and then go from there.

a36a4f0aa2d7f129af1802cbaa36ec85aa	Have you ever lost your freedom? Have you ever had it restricted in any way? Have you ever had an opinion and not expressed it because of lack of approval? Have you ever felt hindered in what you believe because you were denied the ability to speak your feelings.  What would TV or the radio become if they were forced to operate this way??? <br>  Think about that and then write your paper.

"I play" To turn it into the past you have to say "jugue soccer".

o3Jpfflgaa	It's not bad!  I'd suggest a few changes as I'm doing below:<br>  <br>  Taking money from the transportation system for magnet schools won’t help students!  I’m a junior at (SCHOOL) and I see it affecting everyone there. At (SCHOOL) we lost our 4:30 p.m. activity buses for this school year and it has devastated our some of our extracurricular activities. How can we better ourselves when the school board doesn’t provide the means for us?  This mandate will only hurt us in the college admissions process.<br>  <br>  In L'Alliance Fran?aise ((SCHOOL)‘s French club) I’ve noticed that there are very few freshmen and sophomores this year. Most members drive, have their parents pick them up, or are lucky enough to know someone who drives. We once had a lot of freshmen and sophomores, but not anymore. Students who’ve been at school for over 7 hours already having to wait until after 6:00pm for activity buses to arrive turn a lot of people away afterschool clubs.<br>  <br>  Extracurriculars aren’t just things to add to a laundry list, they help keep kids interested and benefit us in the long run. They help us explore our interests and they give us an opportunity to learn more about things that may not be covered in the classroom. But wait! There’s more!  Now, they’re considering taking away teacher’s supplement pay for the extra hours that they put in. What’s next, cutting school hours and principal’s pay?  Please consider what you do!|`|rlWZtKx2aa	Here is your paragraph with the changes I would make.<br>  <br>  Taking money away from the transportation system for magnet schools won’t help any of the students anywhere. I’m a junior at (SCHOOL) and I see it affecting everyone already. We lost our 4:30 p.m. activity buses for this school year and it has devastated some of our extracurricular memberships. How are we supposed to better ourselves by becoming “well-rounded” when the school board doesn’t even give us that chance? This choice forced on us will only hurt us in the college admissions process. In L'Alliance Fran?aise, ((SCHOOL)‘s French club) I’ve noticed that there are very few freshmen and sophomores this year. Most members drive, have their parents pick them up or are lucky enough to know someone who drives. We used to have a lot of freshmen and sophomores, but not anymore. The ideal for students (who’ve been at school for over 7 hours already) of having to wait at school until after 6:00pm for this years’ activity buses to arrive turn a lot of people away from joining after school clubs. Extra curriculars aren’t just things to add to a laundry list, they help keep kids out of trouble. They benefit us in the long run, they help us explore our interests and they give us an opportunity to learn more about something that may not be covered in the classroom. But wait, there’s more; they’re considering taking away teacher’s supplement pay for the extra hours that they put in. What’s next, cutting school hours and principal’s pay?
