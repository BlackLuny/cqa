I'm not overweight or anything, I weigh 114 (in the morning before I eat anything) and I'm 5 foot 7 inches (I think). So, this pill is called Mullberry Zaccarin and it's supposed to dissolve excess fat that gets stored after meals. It also is supposed to help you not crave sugar. Is it alright for me to take something like this? Or even some sort of weight loss tea. I highly doubt that these are going to work (unless if you have any experience), but I'm just curious. Will it harm me in any way?

I'm 5f11 Male, and 19yo I weight 140-145   I train over 3 times a week at the gym I do a lot of cardio and muscle training + I take Protein shake and eat well I think.      But Her, My mom believes I'm anorexic and I don't get it at all...    Today as an example I ate as usual and when she asked me for a dessert I said no because I didn't want it and she went berserk on me : you can eat it if you want there's no need to private yourself...    -I'm fine mom I just don't want to...    -BUT YOU'RE SO SKINNY NOW   -yeah mom let's end it here before it turns to sh** again...   -LOOK AT YOURSELF YOU'RE SO SKINNY YOU'RE UGLY    -oh thanks mom you're such a good mom for me.   *walks downstairs and get yelled at and get told by my mom that I'm anorexic+ugly*      WTF?       Ok what I believe might be the reason behind all of this are    -I used to be like 170 pounds  but lots of fat not much of muscle    -started training like crazy lost a lot of fat and discovered I wasn't quite the muscular type... so I subscribed to a gym and started taking protein shakes to help but I slimmed down and now I'm damn fine but she keeps on telling me I'm anorexic   -I stopped soda, and I eat fast food a lot less often, I eat a lot less of sugary things and chips...       In fact I've never been so well... YET she believes I'm anorexic... even after telling her all of what I said here she hasn't stopped bugging me with that. It's getting so bad I want to get an apartment in town with a friend to get away from home...      so any suggestions or idea would be awesome. ANYTHING!

I consider myself lucky as i've never had a bad head ache in my life, until yesterday. About lunch time I started to get small, painful twinges in my head above my right eye. I put it down to looking at the computer too much, which I do for 7 -9 hours a day so i took a break.       I also drunk ots of water, I have 2 litres a day. Then I left work and kept feeling the twinges. They weren't particularly painful. Then at 7pm last night I got the worst head ache ever. I had to turn all the lights of and lay silent in a dark room for hours before it went.       I woke up this morning (it's 7am) and the pain has gone but the twinges are here again. I really don't want another bad headache - IT'S MY HEN DO TONIGHT!!!      I don't think it's computer use as i've been doing my job for years with no problem and i'm not dehydrated!

So I decided to get it pulled all together otherwise I'd just get that done.       So       Anyway to my question, So what should I eat/drink after having my tooth pulled?         And secondly should I bring something with me to keep my mind off that there pulling my tooth or no?

All treatd now but need a gastrscopy.   Now for 3 months iv been able to feel the lymph nodes in my neck and because i always touch them they get sore.   Ive had alot of blood work and close monitoring of the lymph nodes, the never grow and they come and go.   I had an ultrasound on my neck 2 days ago to put my mind at ease.   My doctor told me today they are all 0.5 cms, teh biggest one is 1.5cms and it wasnt one that was bothering me, itw as the one under my jaw where i had a tooth extracted an dit got infected 3 months ago.   He sais normal blood flow through them, they arent swollen just easily felt by me.    Do you think they are this way cos i have some teet h that need to be worked on? One is really bad and chipped off and rotten.   I was scared about lymphoma?? SHould i be? Ive also had normal chest xrays and abdominal ct and ultrasounds.

I work out daily (sometimes twice a day) I walk/jog one mile a day when my husband gets home and do a routine video in the morning when I can. I also am watching what I eat. My menu is usually scrambled eggs with cheese on whole wheat toast for breakfast, a fiber granola bar with either yogurt, pudding or jello and a protein shake for lunch/snack and a salad with cottage cheese and protein shake for dinner. I stop eating by 7pm so as to not have anything "sitting" on me. I have been doing this about two weeks solid and the scale isnt budging. What else can I do. I know normally I would be losing with this regimine. I am also breastfeeding so I have to be sure to be getting enough nutrients and calories for the breast milk. thanks.

I was having tooth pain with cold and sweet; it felt like the cold/sweet was shooting directly up the middle of my tooth and hit the nerve where I could literally hear a "pop/crack." I went to the dentist and had that tooth redone with a cavity. They took out the amalgam filling and put in a new, resin filling. I waited one week and the sharp pop/crack pain to the nerve was still present. So, I went back to the dentist and they told me to just wait a week, take Ibuprofen and Sensodyne   I've now been loaded up on Ibuprofen and Sensodyne for an additional 7 days and the sharp pain to the nerve is still occuring with cold/sweet.   The dentist said they could put a 2nd filling overtop the tooth and if that didn't work, it would have to be a root canal.       Before I go and spend another obscene amount of money on a 2nd filling, I want advice! Do I take the chance and spend the money to get a 2nd filling, or just go straight for the root canal? They won't even credit my account if I HAVE to have a root canal. So, if I do have to get the root canal after 2 fillings, they won't take into account the money i've already spent of the 2 fillings.      HELP!

20090219233033AApCyMX	Health;Men's Health	Is it harmful to hold my pee in often to have an orgasm?	The question probably confused many people. I've been doing this for years. When I go to pee, I'll hold down on the top of my penis to stop the pee from coming out, but I'll let it go as close to coming out as it can without coming out, and for some reason, it feels SOOOO good. Some days it doesn't really feel like anything, and others, it's just AMAZING! It sends tingles everywhere throughout my body and it surpasses many orgasms I've had from cumming. Sometimes I get hard while doing it, sometimes I don't, either way it feels good. But it often feels better when it's hard because I can move my fingers closer to the tip, and it's a bit of a different sensation when I hold it around there. It's really strange to explain. It doesn't last TOO long, after about a minute or two, the pee kind of goes back in and I have to force the pee out. I'm scared that maybe I'm somehow damaging my bladder by doing it. It's pretty much a daily thing. Just about every second time I pee. And I pee a LOT. I pee like every 15-30 minutes. Not when I'm at work or standing, but when I'm just lazing around home, I pee very often. I'm also worried about that. I have VERY high metabolism. When I worked at Burger King, I used to eat 3 whopper meals every shift, 5 days a week, and somehow, I've managed to remain skinny and 116 pounds for four years. I'm not comPLAINING about my weight, I enjoy that I can eat and eat and eat and not have to worry about gaining weight. But I'm just scared that maybe there's something going on inside of me that I'm not seeing that could be dangerous. I tend to worry a LOT. I thought maybe I had diabetes because I knew that peeing a lot was a symptom of it. And for the record, I eat healthy NOW, I try to eat 3 balanced meals a day, I cut back a LOT on the fast food, and I work out. I greatly appreciate any input and comments. Thanks a lot! =D

20090220004448AApLhiB	Health;Women's Health	I think my aunt is bulimic, help?	I think my aunt is suffering from bulimia. She over eats a TON of stuff at a meal, and then throws up on a regular basis. (Her bathroom is right next to my room, and I hear her throwing up regularly)      My mom (her sister) and I have both confronted her about it, but she keeps saying nothing is wrong and if she was bulimic she "wouldn't be as fat as she is". She says her stomach just feels upset a lot.      She's not incredibly thin, but she is petite and manages to maintain her weight without any diet (she doesn't eat very healthy at all either) or exercise.      I'm not sure if she's just denying it, or not..but even if she is suffering from bulimia, is there anything I can really do to help if she doesn't admit she has a problem?      Thanks

20070121154508AAIr9d0	Health;Diet & Fitness	How Long Will This Take To Do??????	I am 5'8 and 148. I am 18 in HS & looking to lose the rest of the fat on my body, which obviously isn't too much. I am also looking to lift weights too, because I am really not very strong (average to just a little below avg strength prob). I have just a little fat around my chest, lower stomach & inner thigh, but it is minimal.      I plan on running 5 days a week, about a mile each, and going on a diet of almost no junk food, fat, and as few carbs as possible. I also plan on curling, benching, and squatting 5 days a week.      If I do this, how long will it take to lose any fat I have? How long before I see results from lifting (noticeable results- I'm more looking to tone, not bulk up)?

Their components are really different... citrus can hurt your stomach if consumed in large amounts while dairy adds on to the protective layer of mucus in your stomach.

20070324093601AAwDump	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Skin Conditions	Iritated Butt Crack question?	A few days ago I went to the woman doctor, because I had a yeast infection and an itchy crack.  She gave me a yeast infection antibiotic and told me to put gold bond cream on my itchy crack.  So I took the pill and I put the gold bond cream on my crack for 2 days.  Then yesterday, I noticed my upper crack was iritated, it is red and kinda feels like a rash.  I think that maybe putting the gold bond oitment in my crack, broke out my skin there and it feels like it kinda burns a tiny bit (but it isnt even uncomfortable or anything).        I do not believe it could be an STD becuase I go to the doctor regularly and I was just there 3 days ago, also I have never had any STD and I have been with the same faithful guy now for 2 years and he does not have anything and never has.

20081007222557AA3iOpT	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Respiratory Diseases	Irritating something in the back of my nasal passage - ideas?	A couple of weeks ago, I had a really bad weekend. My throat felt swollen, it hurt to swallow, and I had a two-day fever. I'm pretty sure I had strep, though the throat culture I took the following Wednesday revealed nothing. The sore throat lasted for about a week and a half after that horrible weekend, which is longer than sore throats usually last for me, and now I have this irritating clump of ... something (phlegm, I'm thinking?) in the back of my nasal passages that I can't snork away, and that - when breathing just right - makes me snore.       Is this phlegm that I need to worry about, or could this be a patch of flabby skin caused by my throat swelling over that one weekend, or what?      Sorry for the horrific details, but I'm worried - the symptoms of whatever I had that weekend have been trailing on for about two, three weeks now, which is unheard of for my body. Should I be worried?

If I do go out with this guy I am talking to, should I tell him about my horrible past?       I have horrible anxiety at the moment and when he talked to me, when I met him....he made me feel good. I met him at a time where I thought I was going to go insane. My anxiety was sky high and he was a breath of fresh air. BUT once we start hanging out and all...I feel like I won't act "normal". What I mean by that is I've never been loved the proper way in the past 21 years I've been alive...I am only used to being ignored, rejected, broken promises, etc...So when, (if I do get to go out with him) What should I do? How can I handle it and should I tell him?

The surface of the abscess started peeling off for the ointment and it split on the 5th day and a lot of pus came out. i went to another doctor who split it surgically and drained a lot more of pus. she dressed the wound and gave alot of painkillers and antibiotics.   my concern is will this abscess recur? and why do they come in the first place? i am a person who takes hygiene very seriously,   i should add.. The abscess came right after i shaved the area (which i do as a habit) is it because of that?   the doctor says its because my body is too heaty and i sit for long hours... is that the reason? how can i prevent this from happening again?   Thank you

Whenever I'm giving all my attention to listening to an important lecture or meeting, I always miss the important points. Everybody understands what's happening, and I'm the only one who doesn't, despite concentrating on what is being said.      I get extremely sad and frustrated because I have full attention in what people are saying, yet I miss all the important points. What is going on with me? If this continues my mom will get extremely angry at me. Whenever she asks me questions about important things, I don't know anything, and she tells me that I don't listen in class, even if I do.      Is this some kind of mental illness?

20070922051314AA3EfmO	Health;Diet & Fitness	Proper nourishment for excercise & weight loss?	OK, let's see if I can explain my question.      I read that running makes your body function at such a high metabolism that it doesn't allow fat to burn off, instead running uses readily available carbohydrates.      Walking is great for reducing fat because you function at a low enough metabolism that allows fat to be drawn out.      I am weight training to improve my physique & fight muscle mass loss due to aging.      I am trying to reduce my overall weight for better health, etc.      So my dilemma is I'm a little confused about what I should be eating when.       I don't want to draw from my muscles to fuel my running   I want to eat enough protein, etc to support my weight training.   I want to reduce my calorie intake to reduce my weight.   I'm 48 6' 220 lbs. Last fall I was down to 206 lbs. I'm hoping to get under 200. I know I don't have to get as low as what the charts say I should be: 175 lbs (which is nuts) except I have a neighbor who is exactly that. I haven't been 175 since my 1st few years in HS

It itched all day and I kept scratching it. Today it is more faded but still pretty noticeable. The skin was really dry and flaky there. However, when I got home from school, that was the only area where the rash was. I talked on the phone outside for maybe an hour and I came back in and there was a dark purple-red spot on my chin. It's really starting to freak me out. I originally thought that the one on my cheek was from my cell phone because I keep falling asleep with my cheek on it at night and my skin is allergic to several metals. but then I got the spot on my chin today and I got really confused. I don't even know if they are related. Does anyone have any idea what's going on with my face??

But after about 3 days, I felt normal again and had all my energy as before. I'm not someone who wants to do this everyday. I just want to try this when going to amusement parks and fun places similar to that. The 2 days of laziness really got me scared though.

20080706013953AAobTq3	Health;General Health Care;Pain & Pain Management	Have you ever had a weird sinking feeling when your in bed.?	It feels like your sinking deep into the mattress without your body. Or conversely like if your slowly floating away from your body into the ceiling.

20080709012707AAxjWHQ	Health;General Health Care;Pain & Pain Management	Consipation relief?	I had my daughter 2 years ago. Ever since then I have been severely constipated!  I have been to the doctor numerous times over this. They gave me stool softeners, laxatives, and even a medication for irratible bowel. I've tried every fiber supplement out there. I've tried vegetables and Activia. I've even had to give myself enemas! They help somewhat but they don't relieve me all the way. I quit drinking soda for a month and drank tons of water and for some reason it got even worse. I will go 1-2 weeks without going at all and then have horrible diarrea for a few days. My face is broke out with acne from this.  I've had a CT scan done and nothing showed up on it. I have a colonoscophy and endoscophy set up for the end of next month. Does anyone know what this could be and something that may really work to help me go??? I'm out of ideas and am miserable from this!

20081209020358AAxoF0h	Health;Mental Health	I talked to my friend?	I asked about him yesterday, but he told me what was bugging him and he wants me to ask you guys about it.      It's about his IQ. When he was tested in preschool, he scored over 130. He performed far above his grade level in several subjects and was noted as being more patient and mature than his peers. He was basically sure of his intelligence.      He was tested again when he was 12. He was never told about it. He remembers being tested but didn't know it had anything to do with measuring his IQ. That was 5 years ago and he only just found the results.      According to this test (the WISC III, which is apparently an outdated test now), he has a two digit IQ. His verbal IQ was measured at 114 and his performance IQ was 87. He was severely depressed at the time, and a couple of years later he was found to have poor fine motor skills. I've heard that such problems could have a significant effect on WISC III scores.      He's freaking the **** out and is considering suicide. He says that he knows the test is probably off, but he doesn't know how far off it is. He seems convinced that he must not be as smart as everyone thinks he is.      What do I do? The test results seem extremely funky to me. No one who was reading college textbooks in first grade has an IQ of 98, and I don't care what anyone says. He keeps insisting that IQ is a proven indicator of intelligence and that the test means more than any unprofessional opinion.      He's one of my best friends. I hate to see him so torn up about something so fishy. Are there any professionals around here that could tell me anything? Has his IQ really dropped by 30 points or is the test wrong?      I know you can't say for sure over the internet, but do the best you can.

This should be some good inspiration and resources for everyone on this board. :-)      I'll share one of mine:      Dinner:    steamed pesto chicken breasts (serves 2)      In your steamer, assemble 2 6-oz chicken breasts, 1/2 cup low-sodium chicken broth, 4 Tablespoons fresh basil, minced fine, 4 cloves minced garlic, dash each of salt and pepper, 1/4 cup white wine, and 2 Tablespoons toasted pine nuts. Steam for 20 min., or until chicken is all the way cooked.       Serve with brown rice pilaf (serves 2)      Saute 1 cup shiitakes, sliced (or other mushrooms), one med. onion, minced, and 1 clove of garlic, minced, in 1/2 cup of low-sodium chicken broth. When onions are translucent, add 1 C. of cooked brown rice, and season with Spike. Heat rice through and serve.      Awesome green beans:      1 lb green beans   2 Tablespoons toasted sesame seeds   2 oz prosciutto, cut in tiny pieces   1 Tablespoon olive oil      Brown prosciutto pieces in pan, and toast sesame seeds. Set aside. In skillet, heat olive oil and cook green beans until tender. Toss with sesame seeds and prosciutto.       One of my 'hints' is to use chicken or beef broth when sauteeing anything, instead of olive oil or butter - serves the same function, while adding NO fat, and almost no calories (only 10 cals. for 1 cup of this stuff.)

20090220012804AABKlGd	Health;Other - Health	Should I tell my doctor?	Okay so originally I had hypothyroidism (results from a blood test) and I went to a Naturopath to get it sorted out (my mom's friend recommended the Naturopath). Well anyways she put my on some thyroid medicine (Dr Jenson's Lothy formula). After taking it for about 2 weeks I went and got a blood test done. And the test results came back and said that everything was within the normal range. The Naturopath recommended that I should take the Lothy formula for life. So I bought another bottle. After getting another test done 5 weeks later I discovered I had hyperthyroidism (twice the normal range, while I was still on the lothy formula..). My mom told me that I should get off of the medicine the Naturopath gave me and so I did. So after being told that my thyroid was overactive I decided to wait a month to see if the thyroid would stabilize (it didn't). My thyroid came back to be four times the normal range. Now my doctor has put me on Synthyroid.      Should I tell my doctor that I took medicine from a naturopath?      Also my mom's thyroid got messed up before she gave birth to me so I naturally have a messed up thyroid. For most of my life I think I had a thyroid condition but I can't remember why I wasn't put on medication (I actually never had a blood-test done related to my thyroid for most of my life).      Should I tell my doctor that I took medicine from a Naturopath? Does it really matter?      I am a 16 year old male

During the procedure, I bled heavily and lost nearly a liter of blood. I had to stay in recovery for quite a while because of my excessive bleeding.      Now that it's been a week, the bleeding has slowed to a normal period flow. However, I'm still getting slight cramps. I'm just worried since it's been an entire week. Should I still be cramping?

20090220011303AAtI3se	Health;Alternative Medicine	What should I do about a painful Chiropractic visit?	Last October, I had been rear ended really bad while waiting at a stoplight.  My vehicle: A 2004 Toyota Matrix.  His vehicle: A 2000 Toyota Tacoma (with the steel bumper). It was my first rear end collision and I immediately felt a sharp pain to my back and neck.  I sought an attorney after hearing what the other guys claims adjuster wanted to offer me for medical: $1000.  I thought, I need to get my back checked out, besides, I don't have any medical insurance and I don't know how much doctor's visits were gonna cost.  After seeing a doctor, I was referred to a Chiropractic office (it was a husband & wife team). During my treatment there, I noticed that during one visit, I would get adjusted by the husband, and the next visit I was getting adjusted by the wife.  There were times when he couldn't get a particular spot in my back, so he had to call his wife in to get something to pop. There were sometimes when I'd gone in and after being put through a particular position and being pushed down on, I wouldn't hear anything, much less feel anything pop or crack, but he o she would always follow with, "Oh yeah, there it is!"  I wondered, if they were able to feel something I didn't because I didn't.  Last week, after I'd been adjusted by the husband, he mentioned that he would only need to see me once a week and that I should schedule an appointment for next week which I did.  I went back in the next week and this is where my problem happened....you see, after going in for a couple of months, I noticed that I was starting to feel better; that was until my last adjustment this past Tuesday.  I was now getting adjusted by the wife.  She decided that instead of the usual adjustment (lying on my back with my arms crossed while she applied pressure on top of me), she had me remain on my stomach (after receiving a little stem treatment).  She positioned herself as if to do a reverse CPR chest compression on my back, told me to take a deep breath and exhale.  On the exhale, she pushed down on my back and I yelled out in agony.  I was in so much pain; my back and now my chest was hurting me.  I had the wind knocked out of me, she stepped back and apologized and   sarcastically said, "Well, I guess that won't work."  She mentioned to me to turn over and I told her that I needed a few minutes and that I was hurting really bad. After that, she left my back alone and began to adjust my neck.  I didn't know what was going on.  After the visit, she mentioned that she wanted to see me that Friday.  I thought, "Didn't your husband tell me to start coming in once a week?"  I called my attorney and mentioned to her what had happened.  She said that there could be a Malpractice claim against the Chiropractic office.  I kinda felt like I didn't wanna pursue it because they were really cool.  They would always have their kids in the office while dealing with appointments and they seem like really cool people.  However, I am in really bad pain right now and it is hurting alot worse than it had after the accident and I fear if I don't do anything about it, I could be left feeling alot worse in the future.      What should I do?

20090220014852AAenoVu	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	Temporal Lobe Epilepsy... how long do the seizure symptoms last?	My mother was diagnosed years ago with TLE, so I got to see how the seizures eventually worsened from simple partials all the way up to a rare tonic-clonic.   Starting about ten years ago I believe I began developing it as well. Odd episodes where suddenly nothing seems real and I get highly disoriented, sometimes coupled with rage or fear, but not often thankfully. And normally the feeling lasted from just a few minutes up to maybe 20.      Not the last time however, and my own research so far hasn't been particularly helpful.  Basically, I think I had two seizures a day apart. The first one was very short. For about 2 minutes everything looked oddly flat and very far away, but that resolved. Last night however, I very suddenly got extremely disoriented and had vertigo/light headedness. And it lasted for at least 4 hours, because that was around the point at which I fell asleep. All today I've still been feeling weird and rather slow and fuzzy and it has me very worried. I'm going to be calling my doctor about it soon, but I'd like some advice from people who know about it... just how long can the symptoms last?

20090220011532AAO0muM	Health;Optical	What do you think of this experience?	A friend of mine has a daughter who[she said] was born with detached retinas. Her twin had surgery but the mother said the doctors did not operate on this twin. As a result she is regarded as 'blind'. Frankly, she does need help at times. Yesterday this child was in my car while her mother went into the store.. Before I realized it she told me that she had a pen; and she gave it to me. Next, she found a textbook and told me she had my book. I asked her how she knew it was a book. She said,"It's a book!" with an air of finality. About two months ago we went to visit a friend who had a dog. Out of the blue she asked me to see the dog. The dog did not bark to give her a clue.      Some people say blind people depend on sounds and smell.How did she smell the book and pen? In the morning she and her Mom ride with me. One morning my brother drove in his truck - which he had just purchased.When I knocked on their door, she got excited and told her sister and Grammy goodbye. She knew I had arrived.Whether I am barefeet or in shoes, she demonstrates joy - excitement- when I arrive; and I do not have to speak. However, I am still puzzled by yesterday's experience.      The  mother of this child is single. The child's father died tragically when she was four months. Are there hospitals that would evaluate her and help to restore her vision?. I have heard about St. Jude's Hospital for children. Are there more such hospitals? How can I find them? I am willing to pursue this but I need some clues to help me begin.

20090220015040AAV6JF1	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Cancer	Doesn't she want my support?	My mother who's 48 was diagnosed with breast cancer almost a year ago. She was given surgery followed by chemotherapy and I've been to all her appointments with her   During her chemo,she was given scans to see if the cancer had spread and they told us there was cancer in her liver and it's inoperable.   They said they'd let her continue on the chemo she was already receiving and when it was over they'd see if the cancer in the liver had responded to the treatment.   So,when the chemo ended,she had a scan.   We we're waiting for an appointment with her doctor to find out the results and whilst we we're out walking one day we bumped into a friend of hers. Her friend mentioned that she had given my mother a ride to the hospital and asked if she made her appointment on time and how things went. My mother said very little and quickly changed the subject. I later gently mentioned that i hadn't known that she'd had an appointment and she told me that she'd been to see the doctor alone. She told me that the doctor had been unavailable after all and she'd not been told the results.   Because she'd kept the appointment a secret from me, I can't help worrying that this may not be true.   What if the doctor was there and she was given bad news.   I'm so worried and,I also admit to feeling a little hurt by her decision.   I know it's wrong because she's entitled to make her own choices (she doesn't get many choices where the cancer is concerned after all)

I've had anxiety flare up every now adn then because I am stressed out over a situation with my ex. He broke up with em and has been kind of a jerk, because he's stressed at the moment. Being around him or talking to him stressed me out more.       So what happens is I will have a tightness in my test, or some burning sensation, and it will be harder to breathe. Sometimes it is also hard to eat and have an appetite. I do not want to go to meds because I know that this is only a temporary situation. But its been about 4 months and it just flares up every now and then. Cuz I am not over him, and I am in debate or whether to forget him or wait for him... cuz he did say he wants to get back together someday.       I HATE going to sleep at night when my heart is beating harder, it makes it so hard to be comfortable. I just have this really uncomfortable feeling in my chest a lot lately. What can I do? I've noticed a bath does work but only for a few hours and then its back again.

20090203120305AAOcjy9	Health;Dental	Dental implant discomfort...?	In December, my implant (#9) was completed when my dentist attached the prosthesis to the post. Now, in February, I continue to feel discomfort "in" the tooth, though I know there is no neurological material. The oral surgeon has examined the site and pronounced it fine. So has the dentist who attached the prosthesis. But it hurts and throbs and feels tight and congested. Does anyone have insight as to what might be causing this discomfort? Could the torquing process be the culprit? Or might the prosthesis itself not be fitting properly?

20090203120319AAfwcID	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Infectious Diseases	I am sick, what is wrong and will it go away without antibiotics?	Okay, so this last saturday i started getting a sore throat, and then sunday my tonsel was swollen and hurt but not terribly,  yesterday (monday) it had white dots all over that couldnt be wiped off, i thought it might be food or something or plaque, and i was running a fever of about 101 not too terribly high, and it hurt like crazy. Of course it leads into my ear which adds onto the pain yipee. I got some mouth wash meant to cure canker sores in your mouth. Well i woke up today, like an hour ago i havent got to look into the mirror yet, but i sweated alot last night, like crazy and i am at 99.4 now,  still kinda high but not fevering. My throat hurts something crazy and i feel horrible, i didnt even want to move. My husband said the spots arent as prominent but he is in no way a doctor so im not sure. I woke up at 11 am and went to bed at like 1. I took a hot bath last night to raise the temperature so that i would "sweat it out" so to speak. But anyway i dont have medical insurance or a job so my husband pays all the bills so we cant afford the doctors, so do you know what this is or how to cure it?

20090203121026AA7Yzuc	Health;Diet & Fitness	Will this planned exercise "regime" help me to "tone up" a bit?	I'm a 21 year old guy - 5ft 8 and 8.5 - 9 stone (120 - 125lb). I haven't been particularly active lately, and I haven't been eating brilliantly either. I suppose it's just my metabolism that's keeping me from putting on weight. Anyway, in an attempt to save myself some money, I'm planning to start walking to and from university. I'm up at university four days every week this semester, and it takes me about an hour and a half to get there, and an hour and a half to get back home - that's with me walking at a pace which varies between moderate and brisk. Parts of the journey are mildly uphill, parts are mildly downhill, and parts are level. So I'll be walking for three hours a day, four days a week - maybe even five days, on weeks when I need to do a lot of work up on campus.      What's more, a few days ago I started a daily upper body workout with weights, albeit 2.5kg ones, involving bench presses, chest flies, shoulder flies, triceps extensions and biceps curls (between 20 and 30 reps, depending on how much I can manage on the day). I also started doing abdominal crunches - fifty a day - a few days ago.      How much will this "regime" impact on my body, in terms of weight loss, leanness, "toning" etc? I'm a slim, not-at-all-muscly person, and I'm hoping that I'll be able to increase my muscle mass a bit and lose a bit of body fat. Will this exercise bring about a difference in my body (I ought to note that I'm only hoping to look a bit leaner and more "toned"), and if so, how long do you think it'll take before I'll notice any change?

20090220011611AAraVBa	Health;Women's Health	Weird.. i have a sore vulva and need to know why!?	okay, it all first started with 4 little pimple things, like whiteheads around the hole. they were really itcchy but i didnt scratch them. then while i was sleeping it seems i have scratched them rather roughly. then they became sore but still itchy. but now.. it seems to have spread a little up the sides of my labia and to the part in between my vagina and anus. it has become swollen and extreamly painful to touch, so every time i go to the toilet i have to shower because i cannot whipe. i left it for a couple of days but it seemed to be getting worse so i tried, zinc and castor oil, which helped a bit.. but not completly.      i have made an appointment at the gp but the earliest they can get me in is next wednesday.       i would just like to know some possibilitys      thanks      Ps: there is no smell or abnormal discharge either

(quick description) Age 15, Sex:M, About 5'10", 215lbs... i guess thats all you really need to know on that end...      well anyway, im not the fat guy that sits on his couch eating cheetos all day... i am active, i do exercise and, i dont eat super healthy, but im not a pig... but somehow i still cant drop the pounds.      I'm mostly muscle but im flabby in the stomach and thighs, and then i guess, the boob area, for lack of a better term. lol   so i'm starting a diet, nothing major,  but way better than i used to eat: dropping down on soda intake, more exercise when possible, and then possibly a workout regimen.    My question, or whatever, is what can i do to get rid of mostly fat?   do i need to fast and make my body think that im out of food so it uses the stored up fat on my body? or should i just eat normal and work out 3 times as much.    I dont really want to make this a huge part of my life, but i guess in a way it is.      And also, i've heard that stretching can build muscle mass... I was wondering if anybody knew of any that can be done in a room without any weights or spotters... cause im poor, and i dont want people touching me while i work out lol.      So heres what i had in mind: DIET, SIT UPS, PUSH UPS, LESS FATTY FOODS, (possibly) STRETCHES      any help will be greatly appreciated         ps. i sometimes eat late at night, when i cant burn off any calories, how bad is that for me and should i stop?

Now I don't really know if this is something to be concerned about, and I'm not much of one who masturbates at all. So my hands aren't always down there.

Upon returning home healing process began,after a month he complained to doctors about feeling a large mass in his rectum,doctors told him to repeat 2 enemas a day until it passes.He did for 12 or so days( most of the liquid would come up through the colostomy bag)-still he couldn't pass it.(He was in a lot of pain this whole time) After a X-ray scheduled for an unrelated matter, it showed a grapefruit shaped and size "fecal matter" in his colon. Another call to the doctor was made at this point, the doctor still insisted on more enemas and suppositories ( patient now is suicidal from the discomfort).Nine more days pass until  the patient simply can not take this any longer. A call was made to the doctor demanding admittance to ER for surgery or removal of the mass.... he is there now, with no answers to why this happened or if its normal or a serious complication. The doctors are leaving us in the dark. Any medical advice or similar past experiences would be very helpful- I don't know what to do.

I am 5 feet 7 inches tall and weight around 87 KGs. I try to go to gym daily and follow the below routine      Mon  - Wed - Fri :       1. Run for 45 minutes ( 4 min run , 1 min walk ) , I end up burning around 500 calories here.    2. Rowing for 10 minutes / 2000 mts - around 120 calories here .       Post the cardio I move to strength training for legs which includes the leg push , leg pull up and leg push down at 72.5 KG.       Tue - Thur - Sat       1. 60 Minutes Cross Trainer - 720 Calories   2. 10 Minutes Rowing - 120 Calories       I then move to upper body strength training which includes chest , back muscles , biceps and triceps.       I have realized that I have started putting on weight which really demotivates me . I was losing 1 Kg every 10 days but now I have started gaining weight , that might be because I have started doing strength training.       Is there a way I can lose weight and still build muscles. I feel really sick when I see 87 on the scale..      Any suggestion..      Should I stop Strength Training    Should I reduce my weights and do more reps ?      or anything else...

I went to have it re-cemented a few days later and then within hours it fell off again. I don't want to keep going to the dentist to have it put back on because I know it will fall off again. I bought some over the counter temporary crown cement and put it back on. I cleaned the area as best I could (the tooth is a molar, top right side) and there was a bit of blood when I brushed that area. Before I put the crown back in myself, I'd keep it out of my mouth and only put it back in to eat and it would stay, provided I didn't chew on that side. At other times I'd keep it out of my mouth. Is there a potential for infection if I didn't get all the food particles out of that area, or if there was bacteria on the temporary crown?

My period was normally due around the 29th of the month but i had a smear test on the 16th January and the next day i started to come on and my period followed. I am normally on for a week. I had withdrawl method sex on the 8th February (i am not on the pill and haven't been for about 9/10 months) my boyfriend and i normally use condoms but had a moment of madness and this one time we didn't. I assumed because my period started around the 17th January that it was the same time this month (Feb as i am regular) So on the 17th i saw a little brown discharge and thought that i was coming on, but i have been like this now for 4 days and still no sign of any blood and i have had no cramps either which for me is a sure sign that blood will appear, all i have had is few little spurts of cramps on and off the week before my period was due but they only lasted about 5 minutes and then went away and they were not consecutive and i've not had any since. I just wondered if anyone else has had the same problem and whether or not it could be a sign of implatation bleeding, although i have had no other symptoms except feeling really tired, which i have been putting down to work. I don't want to take a HPT just yet incase my period suddenly arrives but just wanted to know if anyone else had experienced the same problem.       Thanks

Since around 2004, when I was 11, I started staying up to around 12 each night. It has gotten progressively worse since then. In 7th and 8th grade, I was sleeping in nearly every single class, every single day. My parents took my computer and T.V. away, and used the lame excuse to "Read a Book". So for a couple nights, I seriously went to the store and bought a book, and when I read it, and I still stayed up till it was time to go to school.      Now that I am in high school, I have tried hard to regulate my sleeping patterns for school, but it is helpless on my own. I managed during regular school days, but over breaks, my sleeping patterns went perfectly nocturnal. As soon as the sun went down, I woke up, and as soon as 6 a.m. I felt incredibly tired. Sometimes, my sleeping patterns are completely random in disregard to the time of day. Sometimes my sleeping patterns would get so bad, they actually fixed themselves because I would wake up so late, that is is technically early! I tried to consult my doctor, but he doesn't want me to form a dependency. I have tried melatonin, but I actually have to much serotonin, so all it dose is tell my body "Time to wake up!" because when you go to bed at night you make a little serotonin to make you tired, but then in the morning you get a lot to wake you up.      Bottom line is, I just need to sleep at night to function in a normal society. What should I do in order to get a prescription?

20090220025950AA3le7n	Health;Mental Health	I've given up on people...?	they annoy me to death. they don't understand me, cos i'm different to them. i.e., i hate minishorts and miniskirts and straightened hair and tans and EVERYTHING popular. i hate movies, i love books. i wear glasses, am pale, my hair's my natural colour and is never straightened. i don't go to social stuff on the weekend cos i see my 'friends' at school 5 days a week and pretty much hate them by friday. they never talk to me over MSN, unless i start a convo with them. when we do talk, we have nothing to talk about. i'm sick of people ignoring me, excluding me and insulting me.    the only people i can relate to are in books. they're usually the outcasts that triumph over the idiotic common people. i'm looking forward to leaving school purely cos then i can be whoever i wanna be and people have to accept it.      and i know this isn't a question really, but i just had to get it out...
20090220030157AA0IJ0w	Health;Mental Health	Can messed up sleep cycles cause depression?	I went from sleeping from 11 till 3 am with 5-6 pm naps freshman year of college (roommate from lebanon... it sucked)      to sleeping from 10 pm till 4 am (work at 5 am over the summer with off days where I'd sleep in till 12:30)      to 2 am till 7am 1st semester sophomore year (where I started developing depression) and finally transferred to the school I'm at now where      I'm sleeping from 3:30 am till 8 am. I finally went in to get help because I can't get to sleep earlier then this. I've tried everything, excercising till exhaustion, sleep aids, whatever. My mind repeatedly beats me down till about 3 o'clock, going over everything I've done, what I've done wrong, why did I do it, etc, etc etc... I finally have started seeing a psychiatrist because I was beginning to wonder if anyone would notice if I were dead.      Should I mention this sleep stuff to them? They asked about recent stuff, but I haven't been sleeping well for a looong time... like today for example.

20090220030936AAi9LXD	Health;Mental Health	Panic/anxiety disorder or just very emotional?	I read up on panic attacks and anxiety disorders and saw that I have all of the symptoms. I tend to "freak out" often when I'm stressed and experience nausea, dizziness, an urge to run away, stomach problems, trouble breathing,intense trembling, and a million other things.       I'm starting to notice that it's getting harder and harder to control. Is this a mental disorder? I'm sure regular, everyday folks who encounter a lot of stress in a short period of time may deal with panic attacks occasionally. Am I just going through a rough patch?      I'm always a skeptic when it comes to mood disorders. I can't help but think to myself that "I'm too smart to allow this to happen to me." How do I bring this up to a doctor? I brought it up to my boyfriend and he said that the emotional/mental should never affect you physically, and that I'm "crazy". What do I do?
20090220031113AASMNHX	Health;Mental Health	How do you explain about serious illnesses like cancer to young children?	i have a little cousin called nicole, who is four years old. she is a very spoiled little girl, who always gets upset when she doesn`t get her own way. she was an only child raised by her single mother. aunt rose had recently got married again. her husband is a man called harry, who was a single father. he has a six-year-old daughter called jade. jade had also been greatly spoiled by her father, who doted on her. after the wedding, the two girls did not get along. nicole often tattled on jade and got her into trouble. jade thought nicole was an annoying little sister. unfortunately, jade got cancer and was in the hospital for ages. she had to undergo many treatments, including chemotherapy, which made all her curly hair fall out. when she got home, people gave her most of the attention. they let her have her own way because of her illness, which made nicole jealous and bitter. nicole feels ignored and left out. she threw temper tantrums and became greatly attention-seeking. she had even tried to fight with jade on some occasion.. there were times when she was mean to her sister. nicole had teased jade, called her names and took her anger out on her. when they go out as a family, jade might not feel well and they have to hurry her home. nicole would cry and scream because she wants to stay and play. aunt rose and uncle harry would just comfort her, saying"we have to go home now because your sister is tired. we will play later." what can i do to help them?

20090220031127AAzuLlX	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Allergies	Peanut Allergy Cure??                          .?	My little girl had a skin test about 3 1/2 years ago and tested positive for allergy to peanuts, so we have had to avoid numerous foods and going out for meals because of the "may contain nuts" labels. I carry an epipen for my daughter just in case of anaphylaxic shock. When we go away in march i will also have to take a nebulizer as when she has an asthma attack it comes on very quick. But i think it is great that they may have found a cure for peanut allergy?  as my little girl will probably grow out of asthma but the nut allergy is life long.      I hope that they eventually will find a cure for cancer and stop all the suffering so many people have to go through.

By the way, i'm not obese,just a very slight bit overweight, after monitoring me for ages, my doctor has finally consent.          Thank you so much in advance :D

20090220032306AAlydLG	Health;Men's Health	22 Year Old Male Urinary problems - Need to get better -?	I have urinary problems - but the doctors don't really seem to have much of a clue about what's wrong. There are three main symptoms-      1 - I constantly leak a tiny tiny amount of urine - you can't even notice it coming out, but gradually over several hours, underneath my forskin becomes very wet, and my boxer shorts become damp - not like you've spilled a glass of water on them - more like if you leave the washing out and fog rolls in. You can't tell they're wet to look at them, but you'd notice if you touched them. This affects the jeans I wear in the same way. This is the main problem. I have to get better from this. If I don't, I feel my life just isn't worth it. That's honestly how I feel. It's 24 hours a day, and I often have to change my underwear twice or three times a day.      2 - My urine flow isn't too bad - but after I'm finished there are drops of urine which drip out. The doc suggested I push behind the scrotum to make sure all the liquid is emptied from the pipes. This helps, but it doesn't completely get rid of all the drops.      3 - I can't have my girlfriend or my little nephews sitting on my knee - it feels really uncomfortable when they lean on my bladder. I've never lost control of my bladder, but it feels like I might.        Possible causes - - -       Around 3 years ago I got a form of Chlamidia from my now Ex-girlfriend. We got it treated at the time and now I'm STD free.      Then in summer 2006 I went riding on my bike a lot and developed prostatitis. It doesn't seem to flair up and give me pain that often, but I notice that if I go a couple of days without ejaculating, and then I do ejaculate it hurts.       In 2007 I had a very uspet stomach. I strained really really hard - to the point where it hurt my stomach - to empty my bowels. My bowels are fine, but the urinary problems have gradually got worse.      I've tried taking Vesicare - that does nothing to help whatsoever.
