LPEWAoWCaa	Doesn't sound very tasty but it's definitely healthy, good job!|`|Z8d9ipxmaa	Sounds good, but not near enough - eating less than 1200 calories will slow your metabolism down, because your body goes into starvation mode and thinks there isn't enough food available. Eating less than 1200 cals isn't recommended on a diet, because as soon as you resume to normal eating your bod is primed for weight gain; it stores your food. <br>  <br>  You also don't eat any fish or meat, which is good a day or two a week, but not everyday. Our bodies prefer to extract many essential nutrients from animal produce; vegetarians need supplements in place. <br>           1)  Our bodies CAN'T absorb and store iron (& other minerals, like zinc) from plant material as efficiently as that in red meat, no matter how much green veg you eat. It's HOW your body deals with food substances. <br>         2) Medical studies in the UK, with athlete Colin Jackson, showed non red meat eaters had weaker muscles. It was because animal protein is needed for muscle mass. <br>         3) Vitamin B12 is only found in meat and fish; a lot more so in meat.<br>  <br>  But since Western lifestyles need very little animal fat (we don't burn it up), it's recommened we have a small amount of red meat a week; make it lean too. The darker the meat, the richer in iron it is. Pork is best for zinc. <br>  <br>  Good look hun. =D|`|6b7KFgtpaa	If you're  trying to lose weight, yes.

AA11046205	Both require a whole lot of commitment on your part, but the lap band if you have a choice is a gazillion times safer, for countless reasons, most especially the death rate.|`|z3f3pBbMaa	The gastric bypass is more effective, but also has a risk of more complications.  The lap band on average helps people lose 50-75 pounds.<br>  <br>  As said before, you still have to change your eating habits and exercise too.  There are man people who have had both operations and still don't lose the weight because they don't make the necessary changes.<br>  <br>  The gastric bypass is more effective because your stomach is made into a small pouch that you cannot adjust. So you can't hold a lot of food. They also reroute your small intestines, so your body isn't able to absorb all of the food you eat either.  <br>  <br>  With the gastric bypass you also have dumping syndrome.  This causes you to get very sick when you eat certain things like sugar or very greasy foods. This can be looked at as a plus and a minus.  But it does keep you eating right if you don't like cold sweats, stomach cramps, vomiting, etc.<br>  <br>  The lap band makes a small pouch too, but there is no rerouting of the intestines.  So you do absorb all of the food you eat.  And you can adjust exactly how small your pouch is.  The bariatric surgeon can add or remove the saline that's in the plastic ring, which controls how tight/small the stomach becomes.<br>  <br>  So, it realy depends on how well you can change and control your eating habits, and whether you are willing to take the extra risks involved with gastric bypass.  There's more info here <a href="http://www.weight-loss-surgery-or-weight-loss-program.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.weight-loss-surgery-or-weight...</a>|`|X7ZWoicLaa	Here is a website that might answer your question.

I had the procedure done on 4-16-08.  I was told that the first year, I would probably lose 70 pounds but I have exceeded that.  I am off my insulin (4 times a day) and I take oral medications and if I continue to lose the weight and stay on the diet, I will be off of all diabetic meds in June 09. (Oh, my heart wasn't healthy enough to have the gastric and I am glad I did do the lap band.  Very happy with the results.  I hope this website answers your questions.|`|bCmqScVlaa	I know there are lots of people out there that like the lap band, but my husband had one done and it just did not work well.  It was OK at first, but then it just stopped working.  He needed to get poked with a huge needle for almost 2 years every month trying to get it adjusted right.  At the end, they said it had slipped, but I really don't know whether that was true or not.<br>  <br>  Now he had the gastric bypass done, and it is so much better.  No problems and losing lots of weight.  He's so glad to be rid of that band.  When they took it out, they told him that it really had caused a lot of scarring where the cells were starting to change.  They said if he didn't get it taken out, that it was a possibility that the cells could change to cancer.  Don't ever think the band causes cancer because it doesn't.  His slipped and must have been rubbing where it shouldn't in those 2 years which caused the problem.<br>  <br>  Everyone is different, but I just wanted to tell you what happened to my husband with both the band and bypass.  I know the bypass is more effective for losing weight overall.

In reality smoking cigarettes is much worse because of all the toxic **** they contain. The effects of of cannabis last six hours max. not the rst of your life.

What would probably happen is your doctor would refere you to a counciller/therapist to help you work through you self image problems and if by the time you are 18 youre boobs still havent grown and you still feel unhappy then you might be able to get a boob job - you dont fully stop growing until you are 20/21 so you have a long way to go.

bWaJ2Xlpaa	1. of course you will lose wait. how long have you been doing this. always remember that it always takes time to lose weight. <br>  2. and yes if you continue youll be losing min of 20lbs by june.<br>  3. before june. if you keep doing what youre doing right now. <br>  4. usually the classes do a lot of work. some classes uses lightweights you could attend thos too because it really helps. <br>  5. no you wont basically what youre doing is trimming and shaping the fat into lean muscles. those are the main point of those classes. weight lifting are to gain muscles. <br>  <br>  p.s. you should lose 20lbs min. by june if you stick to you diet (your diet is ok but i suggest lessen on the snack eventually) and do exercises daily. being a lot active in everything lessens your weight.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|1tjJPHpMaa	Everything sounds healthy. You should have some fruit with breakfast. You should have turkey for lunch, not ham. Also, you should have brown rice, not white. And, only have 1-2 of those snacks throughout the day and make sure that you are having only 1 serving of them for each snack. You will definitely lose weight if you do that. And, if exercise too, the weight will fall of. The treadmill sounds good, but if you do some strength training, you will tone (not get huge). Good luck|`|HSiwgcAkaa	Hmmm, your goal seems reasonable to me! :D<br>  <br>  Don't get too stressed out by this, though! You may not see results fast either, because it takes a week for your body to adjust. You will also lose 3-5 pounds FAST. Don't expect yourself to lose this amount of weight every week though, because some of it is water weight.<br>  <br>  Don't eat sugary snacks, empty calories (nothing in it but fat and calories), or soda. If you get thirsty, drink water. You should be drinking 75 fl. oz of water a day (your weight divided by 2).<br>  <br>  Also, drink half a glass of water before each meal. Eat slowly, and don't eat EVERYTHING on your plate if you don't have too. :D<br>  <br>  You will definetely lose 20 pounds by June! Good luck~|`|8SRjELNBaa	I want you to find out how many calories, carbohydrates & grams of protein your getting a day.  I bet your cal intake is around 2000+, you want it around 1200-1500.<br>  <br>  Fix your diet.<br>  <br>  "i eat in the morning cereal, then at lunch a ham and cheese rye bread sandwich, for dinner i eat white rice with lean chicken or pork or sumthin... or fish. and i snack on quaker chewey 90 cal bars, fruits, popcorn light butter, SOMETIMES pretzels. not much, string cheese 2% milk, yoplait yogurt light....etc""<br>  <br>  Bad. <br>  <br>  For breakfast, have a 1/2 cup of dry oatmeal, 2 glasses of water & a piece of fruit. Don't forget your vitamins.<br>  <br>  Between breakfast and lunch, eat 12 baby carrots or an orange or an apple or 24 almonds.  + a bottle of water.<br>  <br>  For lunch, don't eat the cheese & only use one piece of bread (aka "Open faced").  Throw on some extra ham. Eat a piece of fruit & find a vegetable to eat. 2+ glasses of water.<br>  <br>  Between lunch & dinner.  Eat 12 baby carrots or an orange or an apple or 24 almonds.  Only eat ONE (1) Chewy 90 cal bar, or ONE (1) string cheese. + 1 bottle of water<br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  Make sure your SWEATING when you're on the treadmill. Increase the incline & speed. Carry 5 lb weights in your hand.<br>  <br>  1, 2, & 3 - i don't think so, i don't think your being strict enough. Do some research on your own on healthy diets.<br>  <br>  4 - For now, but you want to do some extra lunges and squats on your own time. Increase the speed & incline on the treadmill for a more intense workout... that'll mean your burning more calories!<br>  <br>  5 - no, they won't get 'huge'.  But you will notice them, they will gain strength.  Don't be worried about what the scale says, just worry about how you look in the mirror.

edzU8VJiaa	You want to put on weight quick?  Eat lots of cheese (pizzas, cheese sandwiches, cheese on toast) plus chips/fries, milkshakes, chocolate bars, roast potatoes, eggs.<br>  <br>  These will put weight on quickly - and will also probably kill you eventually.<br>  <br>  Depends whether you want to put on fat; are you sure you want to do this?  There is nothing wrong with being lean.<br>  <br>  Better to eat a lot of carbohydrate (bread, potatoes, rice, oats, pasta) with some lean red meat, oily fish (Tuna, Salmon, etc.and a helping of salad or vegetables with every meal). <br>  <br>  I have been put on a very low-cholesterol diet, which means I have had to cut out most meats, cheese, eggs, fats, etc., but I have not lost any weight because it is a high-carbohydrate diet (rice/bread/potatoes/pasta).  No matter how hard I try, despite eating very little meat or cheese, I cannot lose weight because I am filling up on carbohydrate!<br>  <br>  Try lifting some weights and doing exercises to build up muscle; eat a good diet and do these exercises every day and you will be amazed how quickly your size and muscles will develop, as long as you are eating the right food.<br>  <br>  Be thankful that you are lean; you don't say how old you are, but I presume you're under 30?<br>  <br>  Give it 30 years, chum, and then you'll remember being that thin - and wish you could turn back time.....|`|cAY3Z9wLaa	wow, i wish i needed 2 put on weight - its the oposite 4 me lol, just eat high carb foods and dont be afraid 2 treat urself ;)|`|n8Db77zbaa	drink protein shakes like "muscle milk" and eat plenty of carbs and red meat.|`|pYRpiSggaa	just live on mc donnals and kfc 4 a bit and cake  ur soon put weight on|`|goe3y4FPaa	TAKE MUSCLE MILK OR HARDGAINERS..

Just eat a normal healthy diet, your body is young and will find its own balance eventually.<br>  <br>  Believe when I say that when you reach 40 or 50, it is far harder to lose a few pounds. Stay young, stay healthy and don't try to force your body to do unnatural things.

Except the strawberries could be fresh.|`|c8d8706e7ff7d8496a0f94f9b618cdcdaa	yeah, but it might taste a little "blah" without some sugar. it wont hurt you, or you can put in some splenda instead|`|PztDZBW1aa	yea, a smoothie is a really good idea!
MhpccWpmaa	My advice would be to go and see your doctor.  It sounds like you could have a yeast infection, but I can't be sure.  You should tell your doctor everything that's going on and they will be able to test you for different types of infections|`|nKSmgjylaa	Totally normal! Usually happens to me near the date of ovulation, thick white discharge. The wet feeling is uncomfy, but that's the joys of womanhood! Haha. Just wear a pantyliner untill the discharge lightens.

The 'stuff' itself is called leukorrhea.  I am a medical expert, but I will also give you a wiki link so you can check it for yourself.  It rarely signifies anything other than that your body is doing what it is supposed to.  As long as it is white and doesn't stink you are fine.|`|JKM7CEpnaa	If you had an STD you would have pelvic pain sometimes. Why not just get a check up for STD's just to be safe. I think your normal. Use thin maxi pads to soak up the wetness and don't worry.|`|jChr0udLaa	It could be a number of things, many of them harmless but go see your doctor just to be sure.|`|b2a5a3043bdf63534f0643e795165672aa	as long as its odourless its normal, a sign that your a perfectly healthy woman ovulating. If however t changes colour or becomes stinky then would be the time to see a gp but otherwise its quite normal and something you should expect for many many years to come yet! it could be a slight imbalance of hormones also but nothing to get concerned over, try thrush cream for any discomfort it usually eases things|`|thkNNDHsaa	This is abnormal. White discharge is ok, but it sounds like you could be having abnormal amounts. <br>  <br>  You may have an std like gonorrhea or chlamydia...or it may simply be just a bad yeast infection.<br>  <br>  I dont think you should let this go, i think you need to see a doctor asap. Tell your partner to get tested also.|`|7imSDvmpaa	hmm...I am thinking it may bea hormonal imbalance, you dont think you may be getting a yeast infection do you...b/c thats more yellow then white. for the pain after you wipe use Johnson&Johnson diaper rash cream.

Z8d9ipxmaa	There are guidelines of normal weights, but what's healthy for you depends on your metabolism, your frame, your body shape. <br>  It's so varied, you can only judge by assessing yourself, not looking at generic guidelines. <br>  Someone who has a big frame could be slightly underweight with an 'ideal BMI', whereas someone else with a small frame may be slightly overweight with that same BMI.<br>  <br>  If you find assessing yourself difficult, see a GP, who can look at you and say where your ideal weight lies.|`|BxD6bUizaa	You are little thin maybe 115ish to be little more curvy. You are still growing so i wouldn't worry much about it anyways. High metabolism so even if you tried it wouldn't do much. You are probably taller than most boys of your age group.<br>  <br>  It's better to be thin than fat now a days, but 110 is perfect.  <br>  <br>  Avg is 110-120 for that height. Don't worry too much about gaining or loosing. Just maintain your weight and you should be fine. <br>  <br>  If you want to know your true fat. Then you must do a skin fold test. It's probably the most accurate affordable test. Scales at the doctor's just tell you averages. BMI is a bad scale becuase you can be muscular and have a high %.|`|ghi9atKVaa	Search BMI and punch in your numbers.  I would say your a little thin for your height maybe by 20 lbs.  use the bmi as a guide.  Also you don't say how active you are.  These all play a role in your body make up.|`|3w7VztEWaa	I think your normal. don't lose or gain. just make sure since your so active to eat and sleep more than the normal person who doesn't do much. you need more energy to keep you going strong.|`|vhTXHv3Eaa	According to a doctor I know, you are underweight.<br>  My doctor says that someone at just 5ft 3 should weight 130 lbs.|`|GLx35x33aa	I am also 5'8" and when I was 110 I didn't feel very good, I wasn't eating enough etc... now I am 125 and feel much better.

Rest assured you are definitely not overweight. Normal weight for a woman your height is 120-150 lbs.|`|oymv7Sk4aa	sound good to me!<br>  Definately not overweight for your height, in fact you're probably quite slim, so it wouldn't harm you to put on a few pounds if you feel you have to.<br>  <br>  (:|`|SF5Y10U2aa	well that's what i am and im 13 and im fixing to turn 14 and my name is dominique|`|HMv6jvUCaa	Your weight sounds fine to me.<br>  <br>  Your 15 right now, I doubt your going to get any taller, but in the next few years your body should start filling out.<br>  <br>  I don't think you should start loosing or try to gain weight. Just keep a healthy diet and let nature do the rest.
9pLdhuBnaa	A hormone imbalance (an example only) could possibly be causing this, but the only way to know for sure is to see your doctor for further evaluation of the situation to see what they say.
qtXsNipdaa	You should talk to the people at your gym.  From what I understand though, you are going to have to eat a lot to keep the bulk (and I mean eat healthy not burgers etc).  Sometimes you are the way you are.  Over time you'll thicken out.  There's nothing wrong with being skinny if you are healthy.  The people at your gym can tell you what to eat, supplements, and what exercises and machines to use.  They can tell you how to do it safely.  You can also talk to your doctor
eqC5EBkJaa	Safe for the most part.  just choose a type without a lot of fillers.  You want 100% whey and not a lot of sugar or chemicals.  Whey protein is one of the best sources you can take.|`|eJz2mOpEaa	No worries mate.|`|wwRbkCMraa	WHEY PROTEIN IS SAFE!!! Baby food has whey protein. Virtually all dairy products have some amount of whey protein.  The protein in milk is 20% whey, so whey in its concentrated form should be perfectly fine at any age as long as you are not lactose intolerant.  Next time you are at the store look at the label on some baby formula.  Even that has whey protein in it.  Start reading labels and you will see many foods that contain whey, and are safe at any age.|`|ujsqa8BHaa	completely safe !

However if you aren't exactly sure then check out NHS direct online which talks you through things like this.<br>  <br>  My Doctor never even asked to see it, just asked me to describe it and prescribed some antibiotics, so don't worry about stripping off, some doctors won't ask you to.

If you do get down to that weight, and people start to ask you if you're sick, then eat more.  It also depends on how you feel at that lower weight.

I was in her situation and it's not fun without being horny and feeling in the mood when needed.  I also felt like my orgasms (if I would even get one) were really weak.  Probably because of my sex drive.<br>  <br>  However, I tried exercising and dieting but nothing seemed to be working.  I thought I was screwed.  I then found something just as amazing as the vibrator that you should suggest to her.<br>  <br>  My friend at work told me about this stuff she took to raise her sex drive.  It was a natural herbal supplement and was I lucky to of found it.  Theres no side effects and the sex drive is just tremendous along with orgasms that are blasting.  The stuff is called Hersolution pills.  At the time I saved money on them at herenhancement.com<br>  <br>  What I did was tried out for 3 months and that was really it.  I found taking them every other day or so was the best to stretch it out. After the months were up, I was back to normal with a beating sex drive and my orgasm strength in increased so much.  <br>  <br>  Well good luck and I hope this helps.|`|wol6ECnQaa	IMO, every woman who's under BPC, or birth control pills are experiencing or have experienced a decrease in drive at a certain degree. Birth control can affect a woman's sex drive in several ways. i.e. decreased libido, decreased enjoyment from sexual intercourse, and decreased lubrication during intercourse or vaginal dryness. Good thing is, there are various products on the market to counter this effects. Most of them are natural sex drive enhancers.

AnHQbZQAaa	LOOSE =/= LOSE|`|UZJ7wVc8aa	Getting a nice set of abs is such a misunderstood process. It's actually a lot easier than most people think which is why most people are in a never ending quest to get that perfect six pack - it's because they're doing all the wrong things.<br>  <br>  When you eat more calories than you burn, your body takes those extra calories and stores them as fat somewhere on your body. For some people, the #1 fat storage area is around the thighs and for others it might be around the stomach - it differs from person to person. Sometimes the fat is perfectly distributed around the body so it's not as big of a concern. <br>  <br>  If an excessive amount of fat is stored around your stomach, the reason that you're not seeing your abs is because your body fat percentage is too high. What you need to do is create a calorie deficit (take in less calories than you burn) so that your body is forced to use its fat stores for energy. After a few weeks of doing this, you'll notice that your abs will start to show.<br>  <br>  You first step is to figure out how many calories you burn each day. Use this calculator <a href="http://calorieneedscalculator.com" rel="nofollow">http://calorieneedscalculator.com</a> for an estimate. Now you need to increase the amount of calories you burn by exercising more and decreasing the amount of calories you eat. Cut out junk food such as fast food, candy and sugar. Eat foods that are high in fiber: bread and pasta made from 100% whole wheat, brown rice, oats, fruits and vegetables.<br>  <br>  You shouldn't ignore targeting your abs with sit ups, leg raises and twists but doing hundreds of sit ups won't do anything about the layer of fat that is covering them. Cardio and calorie restriction should be your main focus.

I thought this was an important topic to share with you because the reality is that most people simply don't realize how dangerous their excess abdominal fat really is to their health.<br>  <br>  The Hidden Dangers of Your Excess Abdominal Fat - It's More Serious Than a Vanity Issue!<br>  <br>  by Mike Geary, Certified Nutrition Specialist, Certified Personal Trainer<br>  <br>  Did you know that the vast majority of people in this day and age have excess abdominal fat? The first thing that most people think of is that their extra abdominal fat is simply ugly, is covering up their abs from being visible, and makes them self conscious about showing off their body.<br>  <br>  However, what most people don't realize is that excess abdominal fat in particular, is not only ugly, but is also a dangerous risk factor to your health. Scientific research has clearly demonstrated that although it is unhealthy in general to have excess body fat throughout your body, it is also particularly dangerous to have excess abdominal fat.<br>  <br>  There are two types of fat that you have in your abdominal area. The first type that covers up your abs from being visible is called subcutaneous fat and lies directly beneath the skin and on top of the abdominal muscles.<br>  <br>  The second type of fat that you have in your abdominal area is called visceral fat, and that lies deeper in the abdomen beneath your muscle and surrounding your organs. Visceral fat also plays a role in giving certain men that "beer belly" appearance where their abdomen protrudes excessively but at the same time, also feels sort of hard if you push on it.<br>  <br>  Both subcutaneous fat and visceral fat in the abdominal area are serious health risk factors, but science has shown that having excessive visceral fat is even more dangerous than subcutaneous fat. Both of them greatly increase the risk your risk of developing heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, stroke, sleep apnea, various forms of cancer, and other degenerative diseases.<br>  <br>  Part of the reason visceral fat is particularly dangerous is that it apparently releases more inflammatory molecules into your body on a consistent basis.<br>  <br>  If you care about the quality of your life and your loved ones, reducing your abdominal fat should be one of your TOP priorities! There's just no way around it. Besides, a side-effect of finally getting rid of all of that excessive ugly abdominal fat is that your stomach will flatten out, and if you lose enough stomach fat, you will be able to visibly see those sexy six pack abs that everyone wants.<br>  <br>  So what gets rid of extra abdominal fat? Is there actually a REAL solution beyond all of the gimmicks and hype that you see in ads and on commercials for "miracle" fat loss products?<br>  <br>  The first thing you must understand is that there is absolutely NO quick fix solution. There are no pills or supplements of any sort that will help you lose your abdominal fat faster. Also, none of the gimmicky ab rockers, rollers, or ab belts will help get rid of abdominal fat either. You can't spot reduce your stomach fat by using any of these worthless contraptions. It simply doesn't work that way.<br>  <br>  The ONLY solution to consistently lose your abdominal fat and keep it off for good is to combine a sound nutritious diet full of unprocessed natural foods with a properly designed strategic exercise program that stimulates the necessary hormonal and metabolic response within your body. Both your food intake as well as your training program are important if you are to get this right.<br>  <br>  I've actually even seen a particular study that divided thousands of participants into a diet-only group and an exercise/diet group. While both groups in this study made good progress, the diet-only group lost significantly LESS abdominal fat than the diet & exercise combined group.<br>  <br>  Now the important thing to realize is that just any old exercise program will not necessarily do the trick. The majority of people that attempt getting into a good exercise routine are NOT working out effectively enough to really stimulate the loss of stubborn abdominal fat. I see this everyday at the gym.<br>  <br>  Most people will do your typical boring ineffective cardio routines, throw in a little outdated body-part style weight training, and pump away with some crunches and side bends, and think that they are doing something useful for reducing their abdominal fat. Then they become frustrated after weeks or months of no results and wonder where they went wrong.|`|RPXVwIlWaa	I can't tell exactly what exercises or which work outs will help you lose the fat, but I can tell you please please please don't starve yourself.  Starving yourself will only decrease your metabolism rate, but you want to increase it.  Also if you starve yourself, your body will actually store more fat and burn less which is not exactly what we're going for here.  Starving yourself may also cause you to lose control and eat too much when you do eat and that doesn't help either really.  Instead, you might want to try eating more frequently but in smaller portions.  That way, your body is burning all the fat you consume in one snack or meal and not storing the extra and it also keeps you energized through the entire day. Instead of starving yourself and eating twice or three times a day, you might want to try eating a decent sized healthy breakfast (the most important meal of the day!) and then decrease the size of your lunch and dinner but add more snacks in between.  I usually set a 100 calorie limit on my snacks so I'm not consuming more calories than I intended to through snacks. Fruits and vegetables such as bananas and carrots are great snacks usually under 100 calories.  Just try to stick to healthy snacks so you are actually gaining the nutrition that your body needs and not just fats and chemicals.  <br>  <br>  Wow, I know that's a lot but I hope that helps.
vhTXHv3Eaa	You should gain weight. I weigh  95 at 5ft 3 and my docor says I should weight 120-130. <br>  Eat healthy food.|`|dqzoEw67aa	That sounds like a lot of junk, sugar and carbs.<br>  <br>  You need to add fruit, veggies, protein (chicken, meat, fish) something useful, milk, real juices.<br>  <br>  What you are eating will eventually damage your body.  Way too much sugar for your body to use.<br>  <br>  You know the good stuff.  Add some to your diet each day till the good stuff is 3/4 of your diet, and the junk less than 1/4.|`|Z8d9ipxmaa	You've eaten roughly the right amount of calories, but getting the right nutrients is equally important, and you haven't got hardly any of them today hun. <br>  <br>  We need some vegetables and fruits everyday; include every color there is over the week, greens, oranges and yellows one day, purples and blacks the next. Fish a couple of times a week, and white meat. Lean red meat once a week. The right quantity of carbohydrate (slow release ones, wholemeal ones), some wheat. Occasionally, a high fat meal is good for us (but only occasionally, lol). <br>  <br>  There are limits with everything we eat, even fruit and vegetables. For<br>  instance, there are certain vitamins (in some veg/ fruit) which we need, but if we consume them to excess it weakens our immunity... Really. Wheat is great in the right dose, but too much is pressuring on our digestive systems & so can make our skin dull... It's complex lmao. The message is that regularity and portion size (in relation to our total intake of food) is more vital than the kind of food we're eating. No food (except artificial things, like colors ect) should be ruled out preferably, because our body needs it in the right amount. If you have the wrong amount, it doesn't do our body any good. Does that make sense lol? Hope i was helpful.... =]|`|oymv7Sk4aa	Nope, you're not having much fruit of veg in your diet though<br>  and if you're 98 pounds I doubt you need to worry about too much food (:
AA11046205	Well let's see ? The cranberries are suppose to be good for the kidneys, and are loaded with antioxidants(cancer and disease fighting agents) and vitamin c(good for a whole lot of things). The green tea is a new one being touted as the cure all. It has plenty of caffeine (a stimulant and a diuretic) a wake up, and a pee inducer. This is the ugly truth. Those 2 dietary things aren't going to significantly change a thing. However on the other hand the work out (exercise) will do a lot. Hopefully your friend did not mean for you to go on a strict diet of only cranberries and green tea? Then he could be right. you will loose weight and you could literally kill yourself having diarrhea and depleting your potassium causing a heart attack. Better stick to a healthy diet and excercise. Good Luck.|`|eJz2mOpEaa	If you eat nothing but cranberries and drink green tea and DON'T work out you'll shed a few pounds but that's really not a good way to do it. Don't look for a quick fix for weight loss. Eat healthy foods, exercise and you'll lose weight.|`|gtbFAAjmaa	duh you'll shed pounds, but NOT i a healthy way. Cranberries have a lot of sugar in them. Try the sugar busters diet, and continue both aerobic and anaerobic exercise.|`|oymv7Sk4aa	if you eat just what you've written then, yeah<br>  but you need willpower<br>  <br>  good luck|`|HtHFHfDKaa	Yes but you are depleting your body of essential nutrients if that is all you are eating. You will need foods high in iron such as Broccoli, Spinach, Green beans, to keep up your strength. Eat lots of raw vegetables fruits and yogurt. It is ok if you eat chicken too just make sure whatever you make to eat is low in fat and sodium. Sodium is bad for your cholesterol and alot of frozen foods are high in sodium.

AA10958492	I really would not be worried. I was once told by a doctor that it is common for women to miss a period once or twice a year. It could be related to stress. If you are worried, talk to your doctor. If it was me, I would wait a few more days, try to make myself relaxed and if I didn't get it in a week, then I would go to the doctors.

Everyone is different, and endless protein shakes and pills are not what are needed. Unfortunately, patience and time are key.
gERaZGZeaa	You're gaining weight because you're growing.  <br>  <br>  A human body post-puberty uses about 1200 - 2000 calories, but since you're starting puberty and starting to grow, you're going to need a lot more than that so you can actually get bigger.<br>  <br>  Just listen to your body; don't restrict food, but don't overeat and don't eat crap.

fA42bQHraa	There's no age limit and I have no idea why people are telling you that.<br>  <br>  Do a reasonable amount of weight and reps, do them no more than every other day and always make sure you have a spotter.<br>  <br>  Don't ever do a lot of weight alone, I knew a 17 year old that was very strong that tried to max out 250 lbs alone in his bedroom and the bar fell on his neck and killed him. <br>  <br>  Be safe about it and you can start now.|`|KXSwS1W0aa	it depends really, DO NOT start when your 13, id say 15 for most, i started 14, but i was actually a full grown man with facial hair lolll everyones different, start off light by the way...|`|mbu5LD02aa	i agree with pink|`|HDNKW0v1aa	i would say start in 9th grade <br>  you can bench before that but don't put a lot of weight on, do it more as a cardio work out.<br>  but when you get into high school you should start putting a lot of weight on.|`|fJJnsWOwaa	wow people usually don't stop growing until 16 which is way 2 late to start start at around 12 or so.|`|6NotwZCyaa	i started when i was 12 with 70 and now im 18 and can lift up to 245 <br>  And I've Turned out perfectly fine|`|Tg6DxG7zaa	i'm female and 14. i did the bench press for gym class... just don't do anything to heavy. find your max. weight (you can't carry it more than once) and work out with only 60% of it. <br>  <br>  that's how i did it and i'm fine.|`|uzthUP9Faa	personallly i started when i was 17, but i felt fully developed at that age and there fore had less risk of sustaining a injury caused by premature training.. but id say from 16 onwards would be sound!|`|Cf5aesvwaa	i started at late 12 early 13 and im still fine today
xI3LJ11taa	yes it does help a lot.... I used to have terrible cramps on the first day...but now that i am on the pill, i just get very very mild cramps, not even needing a painkiller anymore.  It took a few months to take effect tho....and instead of 7-8 days its now 5 days :)|`|h6NqNzHAaa	It does for most people. My sister was the same way as a teen and they helped her a lot.|`|R5Dl17Draa	It does for some people. :) Ask your doctor.|`|AA12398208	Yes it will.

lwm48UiSaa	talk to your doctor. Your period normally bounces around when you are young. The best they can do is recommend birth control, because birth control regulates your period. But I think you are too young for that. The doctor may have more insight.|`|l7GjBVvhaa	It is normal to have scattered periods. Since your diet was out of whack for some time your periods are now not so stable, from your hormonal changes. Until you stay on a stress free normal healthy eating routine your periods will get back to a more normal track for you.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Be seeing you.....|`|bF1L8tiVaa	Like mentioned above, if you're not eating healthily your periods can become more and more irregular.  Being healthy is a huge priority and if you start eating better, then things might start to become more regular than they are.  You need to talk to someone about it, though.  Talk to an aunt, cousin, or a older woman who you trust, but I think talking to your dad would also be beneficial, too.  You might not think your dad can help and you might feel embarrassed, but you are his little girl and he would probably do anything he could to help you.  I talked to my dad about these kind of things when I was younger and while it was embarrassing at times, he was always there to help.<br>  Good luck, sweetie!|`|E2Q2Mtrzaa	My period was really irregular when I first started. After battling with it like you are my doctor put me on the pill to help regulate it. I have not had a problem since. <br>  Talk to your mom and see what she thinks. I know it's imbarassing but she needs to see that your not trying to start the pill for any other reasons.|`|oE12lsg8aa	im only a year older than u but i use to be bulimic and well i had screwed up peroids for a while it took 4 years for it to be normal gaining weight and keeping it i guess helps|`|kN5xtzq7aa	Just go talk to your doctor. <br>  And it's normal for your period to be a bit out of wack for the first year or more.|`|SL1v6fpCaa	talk to your docter umm mine is messed up 2 !!!<br>  it will be normal soon <br>  sometimes it takes up to 3 years for it 2 become normal
RzilBdJdaa	Your best bet is everything in moderation. Believe it or not, too many fruits won't be good because they have sugar in them (good sugar, granted, but sugar nonetheless). Nuts have protein and some each day are good, but too many will just loada you with calories. Try having garden salads (deep greens are the best!) w/out dressing or a low-cal/fat vinegrette. Keep a tally of how many calories you're consuming - you'll be surprised just how many you used to be chowing down each day.<br>  <br>  Make simple lifestyle changes as well - switch from 2% milk to skim - instead of munching on chips, munch on Special K cereal (my personal favourite) - instead of drinking coffee each day, drink green tea. Instead of crispy chicken, have grilled. And so on...<br>  <br>  To stay in "good shape" - not necissarily loose weight, though you'll find that you likely will loose some - do cardio. That means walking, jogging, running, dancing (not professionally if you can't!). Basically, just keep moving! Ride your bike and so on. <br>  <br>  As for muscle mass, I suggest you go to Wal Mart and buy some cheap weights - they're like under $10. Then look up some good excersizes on Google to target what areas you want - upper/lower/core. Also, do crunches/sit ups, lunges, and leg lifts each day to strengthen and build muscle.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your lifestyle change! :)|`|LSxBwiFSaa	Sure! -Eat less; DO more; Get an extra hours sleep every night; Drink a glass of Ice Water with every meal (it burns calories as well as keeping you hydrated); help People (good for ones mental "health"); and AVOID asking "Why..." (& INSTEAD- ask "Why Not ?" )- and thinking you "can't Do something..."  Do ALL this, & people will Hate You- cuz you'll be SO Healthy !!!  -No kidding! Check it out.   :)|`|8SRjELNBaa	Get at least 8 hours of sleep everyday.  Wake up, go for a quick 15 min jog... gets your metabolism jump started.  Eat your fruits & veggies... thats about it...|`|T3OGT4Ntaa	It really sounds like you already know the answer but just need some motivation!  Definitely eat healthier - fresh fruit and vegetables, lean meats (like turkey, chicken, beef in small amounts), yogurt, vitamins, tons of water, etc.<br>  <br>  For at-home muscle gain, do some squats, lunges, crunches, push-ups, leg flutters, etc.<br>  <br>  And stretch a lot if you're going to exercise a lot.|`|tXmu16Niaa	My best advice is water.  Be sure to drink your 64 oz. daily.  Actually, the correct amount of ounces you should be drinking is your 1/2 your body weight.  So, if you weight 140 pounds, then drink 70 ounces of water a day. <br>  <br>  Make sure you also get your daily intake of fiber in.  There are FiberOne bars, that taste great and have a lot of fiber.  Whole grains are important.  Try to look for whole grain wheat ingredients.  Should be the first or second thing on the list of ingredients.<br>  <br>  Also, don't forget your dairy.  Anything from yogurt, milk, and cheese.  This can actually help you maintain or lose weight.<br>  <br>  And eating fish twice a week can help get your Omega 3/Fatty Acids in for the week.  <br>  <br>  All this should help you look and feel better.  <br>  <br>  Good Luck!<br>  <br>  PS: If you do get a craving for something, like sweets or pizza or whatever.  Don't torture yourself by not eating it, just eat one portion size.  It is never a problem to eat whatever you want, just as long as you don't eat too much of it....I know you said that is not what you wanted to hear, but I just wanted to let you know you can still eat the same types of food if you want.|`|dUj7rP2haa	Fruit can be a great snack, hard boiled eggs, cucumbers and/or celery dipped in salsa, a small serving of nuts, air popped popcorn, homemade low-fat muffins, etc|`|JC9F4C2Taa	eat well balanced meals, don't cut out sugar completely, if you are craving sweets-eat fruit, cardio for at least 30 minutes 3-5 times a day, don't take the elevator-use stairs, park far away from the entrance, cut out the majority of carbs, eat lean meats, no fast food, no juice-juice is high in sugars, drink at least 8 glasses of water a day, get plenty of sleep.

249f16397397fc3179827521212ddbf7aa	i. Eat more calories<br>  <br>  This involves some calculation. The approximate normal daily caloric requirement for an average male who performs light activity is 2,200; for a female, it is 1,900.You need to eat around 1,000 extra calories per day to gain less than half a kilo a week.<br>  <br>  Do the math. Eat larger portions and eat at least five meals a day.<br>  <br>  Your actual caloric requirement can differ depending on your height, weight, activity level and your body's metabolic rate.<br>  <br>  ii. Make smart choices<br>  <br>  For example, choose dairy products, Eat foods with high protein content such as beans, pulses and peas, and foods with high starch content such as potatoes, rice and tapioca.<br>  <br>  *<br>  One hour spinning = perfect body<br>  <br>  iii. Protein is important<br>  <br>  Increase your protein intake. Your body needs a lot of protein to build new muscle. But since most of the calories for weight gain comes from carbohydrates and fats, do not replace them with protein.<br>  <br>  iv. Snack a lot<br>  <br>  Consume a lot of high-calorie snacks (not junk food) such as cheese sticks, milk shakes, muffins, dried fruits, yoghurt and breakfast bars.<br>  <br>  *<br>  healthy Ayurvedic mantras<br>  <br>  v. Fluids help too<br>  <br>  Drink a lot of fluids that supply nutrients and calories; milk, fresh fruit juices and energy drinks are good examples.<br>  <br>  vi. Intensify workouts<br>  <br>  Aerobics are great, right? Not for weight gain!<br>  <br>  You need to exercise really hard and intensely to gain muscle mass.<br>  <br>  *<br>  Is walking better than running?<br>  <br>  vii. Weights are the way to go<br>  <br>  Focus on free weight exercises (which do not require machinery) that target your large muscle groups. For example, you need dumbells, not fancy gym machines.<br>  <br>  Free weights put the most stress on muscles and stimulate the maximum number of muscle fibres.<br>  <br>  The best weight training exercises for building muscle mass are free weight exercises like squats, dead lifts, bench presses, barbell rows, pull ups and bar dips.<br>  <br>  These exercises are best done under supervision, but they don't need machinery.<br>  <br>  viii. Space out your workouts<br>  <br>  If you have a high basic metabolic rate -- which means you expend a lot of energy even at rest -- you need short intense workouts instead of long periods of low-stress activity.<br>  <br>  *<br>  Are carbs bad for you?<br>  <br>  ix. Creatine?<br>  <br>  Creatine supplements can help some athletes gain weight. It is not known if it is because it gives them spurts of energy or because it adds water weight.<br>  <br>  More research is needed in this area before Creatine becomes that magic pill. Creatine supplements are available at all major health food stores, but do not take it without consulting your doctor.<br>  <br>  x. Be consistent<br>  <br>  It might take a long time, usually a few months, for the weight to actually show. Some people get frustrated and quit when they fail to see drastic results.<br>  <br>  Your body will only responds to a consistent schedule. No weight gain programme will work for you if you are not regular.<br>  <br>  Heredity does pay a major role in determining your weight. Effective weight training and a smart diet can help you exceed your genetically predetermined weight.|`|6MOs4KiKaa	Dont ever eat to gain weight. Once you get older you will gain all on its own, If you eat to gain weight you will get bad eating habits and will get fat. Trust me.<br>  <br>  I was much smaller than you when i was 13. I was like 95 pounds. now im 17 and im 110. <br>  <br>  so dont eat to gain weight.|`|kjgonYlgaa	make sure you don't over do it but start eating a little extra dairy (milk cheese and yogurt (your bones will also love you for this) and make sure like most 13 year old girls do, you do not cut out eating meat, just make sure they're lean cuts (they won't be as icky as some meats tend to be).  as for hormones they'll kick in soon and then chances are you'll be just right without doing a thing.|`|6JardQBdaa	i am thirteen and 102 pounds, so i do not think you think you look too skinny, i am sure you look perfect

wLLylvN2aa	Your pubic hair doesnt cause a yeast infection. Its when  there is an overgrowth of yeast from your vagina. When something happens to change the balance of these organisms, yeast can grow too much and cause symptoms. Taking antibiotics sometimes causes this imbalance. The high estrogen levels caused by pregnancy or hormone replacement therapy can also cause it. So can certain health problems, like diabetes or HIV infection.|`|ahjqc9Ifaa	Having pubic hair or removing it, by any means, has no effect on whether you get yeast infections.

You dont need to shave your hair and if you have a yeast infection you do not want to use a hair removal cream down their as you are already sore.

Try waxing or hair removal cream if your not comfortable with shaving. Just take antibiotics and it should get rid of the infection.<br>  <br>  Good luck. X|`|NE96fU9vaa	dont shave. this will cause itchy hair bumps, you have a yeast infection cause you need to get better at cleaning youreself and partner, never wipe from back to front, read an article, and you need to get an antifungal cream like monostat or a pill you get from doc.<br>  And its pubic hair
VbvrG9NJaa	Okay well this is what you should do. <br>  If you don't want to where a band aid then just get some tape and cloth and wrap that around your leg. <br>  And that should do it, like it will keep your leg from hurting so much from the band aid and it won't it when you wear pants. <br>  Like I had the same proublem when I was sliding, well slip into 3rd base and I was wearing short shorts and I didn't have any sliding shorts on your anything and I slipped when I was running and I got a big rasebarrie right on my thigh and It was really big and hurt so bad and was bleeding so I had to get some cloth and tape and it didn't hurt so much. <br>  Oh yeah and another thing is take it off when you sleep so it air outs and it won't hurt or stick.|`|KiGnomhZaa	why do you go to school just wearing pants anyway?<br>  <br>  just wear what you want!

drseiznoaa	L-glutamine is good, creatine will help pack on muscle as well. And the Vitamin C is also good. However I'd recommend getting BCAA's, Leucine, and a Yohimbine product as well as a good multivitamin. The BCAA's, Yohimbine and Leucine could be found here - <a href="http://fitbodyclub.net/storeOrder.php" rel="nofollow">http://fitbodyclub.net/storeOrder.php</a> and the multivitamin can be picked up in any local pharmacy. <br>  Lipo-6 would make you lose weight, but the green-tea capsules are good for not packing on fat.

qpr2R3MUaa	Alli, which you can buy at Wal-Mart. These are the only over-the-counter weight loss product approved by the FDA. They don't hype you up like other pills, they work similarly to gastric bypass surgery without the surgery. It helps your stomach absorb less fat from the food you consume.

If one of diet pill work, maybe you want to get it more, or leave it if this diet pill is not satisfied.<br>  <br>  Good luck and success for your diet !!!
i7VjKFP3aa	Gallbladder attacks depend on the person and the type of gallbladder problem you're experiencing.<br>  <br>  If you have a gallstone, the pain will be sharp, almost like someone is stabbing you. The pain will be localized in the abdomen, on either the right or left side, though usually it is the right, and will radiate out to your chest, arms, thighs and shoulder blades, depending on how bad the blockage is. The pain in your chest should feel like someone's squeezing a fist around your heart, almost like you're having a heart attack. The pain can last from anywhere between 10 minutes to 18 hours, and there isn't really anything you can do to stop the pain, aside from taking antacids. The pain can cause nausea and vomiting, so you might want to have your doctor write a prescription for an anti-nausea medication like Promethezine. <br>  <br>  If your gallbladder is failing, meaning that it's functioning at less than 35%, the pain won't be as bad. But your gallbladder will be contracting and squeezing like crazy so don't let anyone tell you that you're not in pain, because it does hurt. Again you'll feel it in your abdomen, shoulder blades and chest, (again it'll feel like you're having a heart attack), but this will be more of a constricting pain, like someone is squeezing not just your heart but your gut as well. However, nausea and gas will be the prominent symptoms, and it will range from on-and off to almost constant. You'll burp and pass gas and feel bloated almost 24/7. The nausea will get worse over time and don't be surprised if you throw up. <br>  <br>  Ignore the guy who said to get an ultrasound. Yes, it can tell you if you have a gallstone, but if the stone is small enough, the ultrasound won't pick it up. Your best bet is to get a HIDA scan. It will pick up any blockages in your biliary ducts (i.e. gallstones), even the small ones, and will tell you how well your gallbladder is functioning. Anything below 35% means that it's going to have to come out. <br>  <br>  In the meantime there are things you can do to prevent attacks. Stay away from citrus, fried, spicy, and fast foods. Beef, pork cheese, spices (this includes tomato, garlic, and onions, and cinnamon will definitely set it off), chocolate, anything overly sugary or that causes excess gas. Anything with more than 4g or 5g of total fat per serving should be avoided like the plague, and try not to eat more than 8g of fat per meal. <br>  <br>  Bread, skim milk, cheerios, oats, sweet potatoes, marshmallows and saltines will be your best friends for awhile. Try eating lean meats like turkey and chicken, and make sure you take a multi-vitamin to prevent anemia. <br>  <br>  If you think you're having problems with your gallbladder, make an appointment with your family doctor, and have him/her write up an order for a HIDA scan, or if they won't do it have them refer you to a GI specialist who will. And do it sooner rather than later. The longer you wait the worse it'll get. Oh, and don't forget about the anti-nausea medicine, believe me when I say that it'll be your best friend. <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|c1b935b0af649d78239616eb9d8c8f15aa	There is a significant amount of pain radiating from the center of your abdomen, or navel, towards your right side (if you are male).  You have this urge to go to the rr, but there is nothing there to expel.  Pepto Bismol or gas-x will not help you in this case.  What is happening is that your gall bladder is becomming distended because a gallstone is lodged in the duct, or you can not pass the gallstone out of your bile tract.  BEST ADVICE TO YOU...SEE A PHYSICIAN AND ASK FOR AN ULTRASOUND CHECKING FOR GALLSTONES.<br>  Once the ultrasound report is done, your physician can present you with options.  If you don't have a regular Dr., then you may have to suffer the agony of treatment by an ER Dr., but at least someone will have seen you.  You may also want to ask family (older ones) if there is a family history of gall bladder problems.<br>  <br>  However, my advice, get off the computer and go to the dr. now.  If there is a need for a surgical intervention then your dr. can discuss those with you.
eU0eQ9EWaa	Iron deficiency is what medical experts call "anemia".<br>  <br>  And I'm not sure that this claim is true: iron is mostly beneficial for blood cells.<br>  <br>  I just hope you're not getting any ideas. Anemia is life threatening and you should tell that girl to not brag about something like that (if she was at all, but it sure sounds like it).|`|sAL6FbY0aa	I didn't think iron deficiency had anything to do with weight loss or an inability to gain weight. She may have an underlying cause for her inability to gain weight that is related to iron deficiency.
lwm48UiSaa	Just put your finger in your vagina and feel around. You will find what makes you feel good. If you curl your finger and feel this spongy kind of thing that will help. <br>  Douching is how some people clean themselves out|`|wLLylvN2aa	fingering yourself is just touching your privates, or inserting your own finger inside;  and douching is when you buy this liquid that you squirt inside your vagina to clean it out. but you don't have to douche, your vagina cleans itself.|`|l7GjBVvhaa	Douching is vaginal irrigation, in other words to rinse clean the vagina. If you keep yourself clean as it is there is no reason to do this. It can be very unhealthy and promote bacteria and infections to occur in your vagina and cervix.<br>  <br>  <br>  As for fingering yourself. It is self explainitory. You simply insert your fingers- one or more- into your vagina - hope you know where that is - and let the feeling lead you else where. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Be seeing you....|`|QA1wdMOHaa	Just stick your fingers inside and pull them in and out.<br>  <br>  Douching is a bottle with a nozzle that is filled with a cleansing solution that you put inside your va jay jay to clean you out. I wouldn't recommend it though. They say it can cause infection's because it disrupts your natural flora.|`|27gxjVJnaa	Don't worry girl, All you do is use your finger to very gently rub you clit and when you get nice a worked up and juicy just slip your finger into your Virgina and just have fun.<br>  as for douching I believe it were you squirt water up there but i'm not sure.|`|eSAt31m3aa	Use an electric toothbrush on your clit

Just don't smoke when they do. If you like doing it with friends and it's not hurting anybody, why do you want stop though? It's not like you're all laying around taking blasts of crack and setting each other on fire. Mighty Jah put the herb on Earth for us to enjoy. Why not enjoy it?
lwm48UiSaa	i don't think you are unhealthy. my friends period became irregular when she became a life guard. the doctor told her a lot of activity can change your cycle. also my sister stopped getting her period for months at a time. you should probably get on birth control because that helps regulate your period|`|wzM5WB8Xaa	A lot of things can effect whether or not you have a period. I think it's awesome that you are still a virgin! If you have been exercising a lot lately, lost some weight, or have been stressed out, you could easily not have a period for a while. My #1 advice to you is to be honest with your obgyn. It is the only way s/he will be able to find out what's really behind your missed periods. And don't worry, no matter what you tell her, it won't be the first time she hears it and she won't be judgmental of you.|`|AIJgbvIcaa	If you've never had sex it's just a body issue. My mom didn't have her period for a year and when she went to the OBGYN they just gave her pills to start it up :)<br>  <br>  I would just relax and not worry, and stop dieting!!|`|iAdRYpLEaa	yes it could be the result of over dieting or exercise, if you BMI is under than what is recommended i would change your ways.|`|W1GHZW3Caa	your unhealthy or you could be pregnant cause your brother jacked off on your underwear or something|`|A2qhd5SRaa	Stress can cause it. Relax, go see the ObGyn youll be fine.|`|ehhqE4quaa	If you are on an extreme diet...or doing excess amounts of excercise...your also a teenager and your period has not developed a regular flow. <br>  When you go to the ob/gyn tell them that your a virgin, say you have been on a diet, and tell them the last time you have had it.<br>  They will probably give an exam and put your legs in the stirrups and take a sample. Basiclly a pap smear. Bu it doesn't hurt i PROMISE. It just feels a little chilly =)<br>  Good luck! You don't have any reason to be scared|`|MRWDXeXsaa	yes, it can be caused by dieting.  when your body feels like its starving, it stops doing the unnecessary processes first, like your menstrual cycle.|`|a21AJHhbaa	Anorexia will stop you from having your period. Until you fix the problem, that is.|`|YSAfYkPwaa	Either your pregnant or you need to stop dieting at the age of 16.

4b63df522adcbbe3effabc36048eabe4aa	It's called your local smoke-shop. First you go there, if you do not have a local smoke-shop, then you find one near-bt or within reasonable distance. If this is a question directed towards you being tested for a job, I would recommend you travel at least 100 miles if there is a shop withint hat distance. I would waste the gas because you may purchase the item for $40.00 and spend another $20.00 in gas, but you'll make $60.00+ back on your first paycheck. Even if your only being worked part-time. What you need to do is go to the smoke-shop and they will all have this box-set, which includes authentic piss for males and females, with a heating pad, a baggy and tube. All you do is take your piss test with this pad wrapped around your leg, with the heating pad on the baggy and use the tube to drain it into the cup.<br>  <br>  This box-set costs $40.00 from all websites and smoke-shops. If you have any additional questions on how to use it, or how long the heating pad should stay on the baggy, it does come with instructions and the smoke-shop owner would be glad to tell you how to use it to perfection. This is the only thing that will guarantee you pass your test, otherwise you will be conned into other peoples answers or suggestions as to drinking a gallon of water, or buying the 430 detox drink, or other suggestions that won't work. Like mentioned above, you will be flagged if you come out to clean, this happened to a buddy of mine, the safest way to go about this is buying the pee from the smoke-shop.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|W6LGsQC8aa	Sorry, there is no REAL quick fix to wipe THC out of your system. It is stored in fat cells in your body so it takes a while to work its way out.<br>  <br>  They sell assorted teas and drinks, but all they really do is make you drink a lot of fluid to dilute your urine for a urine drug test to hopefully test negative. However, most urine tests will have a red flag if the urine is TOO diluted, but at least being very hydrated isn't illegal.<br>  <br>  Your best bet is to hydrate (don't just drink straight up water, or else you will wipe out all your salt/electrolytes and you cold die from over-hydration). So start chugging some gatorade and hope for the best!|`|TyfADwoZaa	this takes time.<br>  <br>  but you can speed it up.<br>  <br>  I smoked pot for years.

They test you and give you a short survey before you donate, and that will rule you out.<br>  <br>  since your are anemic, you have  lack hemoglobin, which trasports oxygen through red blood cells, which will be hard on your system, and may not be helpful giving to someone else, because the blood has to be nutrient rich to help someone. . . have you taken anything for it? iron pills or medications to try to get this under control?<br>  <br>  if you are doing it for the charity, maybe volunteer at the blood drive and help that way.|`|ahjqc9Ifaa	It certainly won't be fatal, but in all likelihood if you tell the nurse the truth (a must when donating), you'll be rejected.<br>  <br>  Iron deficiency anemia is common in girls and women who menstruate. The Red Cross does test blood for iron levels and refuses donations if you're too low.<br>  <br>  Remember, the recipient of donated blood needs it to be healthy blood with enough red cells. Please don't withhold the fact that you're anemic. What should be a life-saving donation may not be, if the blood has too little hemoglobin.

Avoid red meats. Take a multivitamin, calcium and vitamin d every 2 days, one or two V8s a day (or every other day). <br>  <br>  Don't starve, eat small healthy meals. A lot of small meals opposed to a few bigger ones-- make sure is has at least 8-10 or more g of protein, not too much protein because the body can only digest a certain amount at a time; and avoid too many fruits, carbs and sugars. Fibrous veggies, greens (no starches or potatoes) are good, and no BBQ sauce (unless used sparingly) and not too much (if any) salad dressing. <br>  <br>  Before bed (2 hrs), eat something with protein, don't<br>  eat many carbs before bed. Eat some of that good cereal in the morning, you need quality carbs, just not too much, and the slow digesting ones.<br>  <br>  Do slow crunches until you can not do anymore, jog stairs (be safe though), warm up first and do sprints, short bursts of intense activity is very effective compared to long weak activity, just don't over do it. Also include some slow but long endurance jogging.

Weight gain happens when you create a calorie surplus (eat more than you burn). Your body takes the excess calories and converts them to fat which get stored around your stomach, arms and thighs. The longer you remain in a calorie surplus, the more weight you'll gain. To lose that weight, you need to do the opposite. You need to create a calorie deficit (start eating less than you burn). <br>  <br>  Your first step is to figure out how many calories you burn on a daily basis. This calculator will help you out <a href="http://calorieneedscalculator.com" rel="nofollow">http://calorieneedscalculator.com</a> The number you get from this tool is what your body burns on a daily basis. To lose weight, simply eat less. It sounds a lot easier than it is but making small changes helps you adjust to a new lifestyle. Don't think of this as a diet, think of it as a new life. Instead of eating foods high in sugars, white flour and saturated fat, go with fruits, vegetables, whole wheats, fish, lean meats, nuts and beans. In addition to eating less, you also need to exercise more. Start off at 1-2 times per week and work your way up to 3-5 times per week.<br>  <br>  Don't make all of these changes at once or you won't be able to properly adjust to them. Generally, eating healthier foods will decrease your calorie intake. Compare a doughnut to an apple and you'll see that healthy foods are lower in calories.

Make sure you fuel your body properly as you wont be able to excercise properly if your too tired.<br>  <br>  Try having your largest meal in the morning, something quite filling like porridge and a smaller meal for Lunch and dinner. Snack on carrots and celery as they have no calories and you will feel like you have eaten something. Soup (vegetable) is great for dinner as its quite filling. Don't eat after eight when you metabolism slows down. <br>  <br>  Probably not good for you, but diet coke really fills you up and has no calories, or just drink lots of water.<br>  <br>  Also, really try weight watchers food...you can get it at most supermarkets..Asda is really good. They are actually really nice and have little fat and calories. I think this is the best diet food as they do fill you up...avoid slimfast, you will not feel full at all.<br>  <br>  15lbs is possible but very dependant on your current weight and height. Have a look at the weight watchers website....loads of tips there.www.weightwatchers.co.uk<br>  <br>  I have tried that wu-yi tea, and the company just keep on charging me...lots of money.....its not free at all, and is very pointless.<br>  <br>  Finally, stay positive, and don't panic if you do not see results straight away, if you stick with it, you will see the results. Best of luck.

Yes, I do think that your food sounds nutritious but it also sounds to me like you are showing signs of having an eating disorder by obsessing over what you are eating and the exact details of exercise. This is okay to do when you need to lose weight, but you do not need to lose any weight and could definitely stand to gain a couple of pounds.

vEGkSHMsaa	Try lowering your reps. Do 3 sets of 5 that incorporate big muscle groups. Like squats. Dont start out doing your max 3x5. Start about 15% lower. Those are big increments go be going up in, but I guess you have to do what you have to do. Try to find a way to add less weight and gradually increase it. Your not going to get stronger doing sets of 10. Bench press, Squats, Pullups/chinups, I dont think you can do deadlifts, but those are all great for increasing overall strength.|`|WoAAdxHEaa	benching is the same as pushups, so try wearing a weight vest doing pushups to buils strength.<br>  <br>  lat pulls are pull-ups<br>  <br>  leg-press is a squat, add a med ball to a wall-sit or lunge

UZJ7wVc8aa	The key to starting an exercise routine is to make the changes slowly. You can't go from being sedentary to active overnight and hope to succeed. Start out by exercising 1-2 times per week and eventually moving up to 3-5 times per week. Only increase the amount of exercise you do per week when you feel ready.<br>  <br>  Exercise routines also have to be well rounded to be successful. You need elements of flexibility, cardiovascular and strength training. You don't need to go to the gym to get a good workout, but having access to that type of equipment is a definite plus. Flexibility isn't very intensive and can be done on most if not all days of the week. It won't directly help you with your goals but it will lead to better performance - it will make exercising a lot easier.<br>  <br>  Cardio should be done 3-5 times per week while strength training should be done 2-3 times per week. The more weight you want to lose, the more you need to exercise. If this seems confusing, you can get a free personalized workout routine at <a href="http://shtrainer.com" rel="nofollow">http://shtrainer.com</a>|`|fwWO14fIaa	try adding some interval training to your workout. interval training is where you exercise at a steady pace for say 30 secs and then you go all out for 30 secs, and you repeat this about 8 times. a good one would be to slow jog or fast walk on treadmill for 30 secs and then run as fast as you can for 30 secs and repeat this for 15 - 20 mins, this type of training is proven to burn more fat than exercise continually done at steady pace. you can also do interval on the punch bag and actually near enough all boxers do intervals on the punch bag, just jab the bag for 30 - 60 secs then do 30 - 60 secs of just continually punching the bag without rest. this will work i promise and you will see good results within 2 - 3 weeks.
fwWO14fIaa	yeah this is fine as long as you give your muscles a full days rest in between to recover. basically to gain weight you need to be consuming 500 cals extra in your diet. if you do this then you will gain weight, but the best way would be to eat alot more carbs like potatoes, pasta, rice, etc.|`|t8kykME3aa	Yes you can use them both.

I worked off 25 pounds, it definitely does work!
30iqJREVaa	I like number 1 better. If you chose number 2, you will be fatigued after the weights and wouldn't be in the mood to do cardio<br>  <br>  But trial both and see what happens. For me, I prefer doing my hard cardio first then weights. But everyone is different
gj6nHodNaa	To get six pack abs you need to do two things: Build muscle and lose fat.<br>  <br>  Basically, you MUST:<br>  Build Muscle!<br>  Lift Weights. Eat Smaller Dinners. Eat More Fiber. Drink More Water Every Day.|`|3ks8ZVTmaa	Do A LOT .... i mean A LOT of crunches,.. you might get disappointed at first but if you're consistant you will see the results.. it's worth it if you really want them. But let's be honest, getting a six pack doesn't happen over night, that's why you need to continue with your crunches. But don't just do the same crunches over and over, try combinations. Many people will tell you that crunches are old school and that they only mess up your back. Well the messing up your back part is true....IF YOU DON'T DO THEM RIGHT.. DUH. Well good luck, and remember be consistant... don't give up. and at the end you will be glad you kept with it. OOps, i almost forgot!! Be sure to give your muscles some rest. What i do is i work my abs one day and the other day i rest. it works!!|`|QFjbbkHJaa	i would recommend joining a gym, and ask one of the personal trainers for some help.|`|vhTXHv3Eaa	Do 5 minutes of crunches a day and focus on protein and building muscle. Stay hydrated, eat right, eat enough, eat nutrient-dense foods but not calorie-packed unless you wanna gain weight.
YL5ziuTRaa	Your bmi is 24.9. Its normal. But if you gain a bit more weight you will become overweight. But it also depends on how much fat and muscle you have.|`|NZ2tS11maa	Im 9st and 5ft 3, this is meant to be my ideal weight (not convinced myself), so I guess your a little bigger than me.<br>  <br>  What you need to ask yourself is do you feel healthy? Yes, so relax and dont worry. No? Start watching what you eat, dont go on a full on diet just watch what your eating a little more closely.

mNWgzQDOaa	"After putting the yummy stuff into your mouth, it (the bolus) then has to travel through the entire gastrointestinal tract before coming out the other end. The gastrointestinal tract for the purposes of this exercise includes the oral cavity, the oesophagus, stomach, small intestine, and colon.<br>  <br>  Food travels down the oesophagus at a rate of approximately 3 to 4 centimetres per second (1 to 2 inches), and the entire process takes about 5 to 6 seconds. In the stomach, food tends to hang around for a little longer and this depends on a variety of factors including the amount of food you have consumed, how much fat it contains, and also the acidity of the stomach. However, all food should have left the stomach within 2 to 4 hours.<br>  <br>  In the small intestine, digestion continues and absorption occurs. From here on, the time to defecation will vary depending on the time it takes to adequately digest and absorb in the small intestine. This will usually take 5 to 6 hours. The "food then enters the colon for further digestion and water reabsorption before defecation. The time from it’s entering the colon to defecation is about 12 to 24 hours.<br>  <br>  Thus, the time for food to travel from one end to the other probably ranges from about 20 to 30 hours. Although I haven’t had the time to look further into the rest of your question, I hazard a guess that it is unlikely that meat will hang around for a week given that the gastrointestinal tract is very effective in breaking it down with various enzymes and acidity of the stomach. Foods high in protein and fats probably would probably take a little longer to pass through than if it were carbohydrate."|`|go8QFRtXaa	On average:<br>  <br>  Stomach - 30 minutes to 2 hours<br>  Small Intestine - 2 to 6 hours<br>  Large intestine - 6 to 72 hours<br>  <br>  So it usually takes from just under 24 up to about 72 hours to pass right through, with the waste coming out the other end, depending on the food and your digestive system. As you can see, the time taken is pretty variable.
4HQxLXQCaa	You can't.  I don't care if you are going to Florida for spring break and want a six pack and biceps to show off, you can't get them in a few weeks.<br>  <br>  Second, even if you did manage to get them, you would look ridiculous with nice arms and abs, but puny shoulders, tiny legs, and an itty bitty back.<br>  <br>  You have three options:<br>  1. give up (and get no results)<br>  2. do crunches and bicep curls till your arms fall off (and get no results)<br>  3. Devote patience and determination and build up your muscles gradually.  In a year, you will have bigger biceps.<br>  <br>  If you are serious about building muscle, you have to look at it from a different angle.  If your only goal is to get big arms, you aren't going to succeed I can tell you now.<br>  <br>  Take a look at the programs below.  I've tried them and they work.  They aren't easy, but they are straightforward and effective.  If you give patience (which I can see you don't have yet) and motivation, you will receive results.<br>  <br>  Btw, seeing as this is YA, I bet someone will suggest you do something like "30 pushups and 100 crunches a day" for a workout plan.  As a head's up, this will not work, you will just be wasting your time.|`|kMlDB10Xaa	steriods...<br>  it would be cheating but hey if your that desperate, go for it

dLadxEJSaa	Before I even clicked on your question I was thinking clogged duct. But of course I think you should have it checked out, Nina. I'm sure it's nothing but it is certainly better to be sure.<br>  <br>  <<<<<<<HUGS>>>>>>>>|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	You can always get a plugged duct.  You can be nursing a 3 year old and get a clogged duct.<br>  <br>  If it doesn't get better after about a week, and you are concerned call your doctor.  At most they will do a needle biopsy and if its a clogged duct all that will come out is breast milk.  If a clogged duct develops into an abscess the treatment is usually to drain it with a needle and if it won't go away after doing that once or twice then they consider surgery.<br>  <br>  If you do need a mammogram you should know that they can be done while you are breastfeeding, though moms are almost always told they must wean.  Just before your mammogram its best to nurse the baby as much as possible and then pump to make your breasts as empty as possible.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Plugged Ducts and Mastitis<br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/bf/concerns/mom/mastitis.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/bf/concerns/mom/...</a><br>  <br>  Breastfeeding and breast abscess<br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/bf/concerns/mom/breast-abscess.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/bf/concerns/mom/...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/newman/09a-illness_mother_baby.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/newman/09a-illne...</a><br>  Mammograms are more difficult to read if the mother is breastfeeding, but can still be useful. Once again, how long must a mother wait for her breast no longer to be considered lactating? Evaluation of a lump that requires more than history and physical examination can be done by other means besides a mammogram (for example, ultrasound, needle biopsy). Discuss the options with your doctor. Let him/her know breastfeeding is important to you.<br>  <br>  ------------<br>  Use of Radioisotopes (and other imaging agents) during Lactation<br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/health/meds/radioisotopes.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/health/meds/radi...</a><br>  <br>  --------<br>  <a href="http://www.breastfeeding123.com/x-rays-and-mammograms-for-lactating-women/" rel="nofollow">http://www.breastfeeding123.com/x-rays-a...</a><br>  1. X-rays. The radiation used in an x-ray does not affect breast milk and the mother may continue nursing uninterrupted after an x-ray.<br>  <br>  2. Mammograms. Mammograms are x-rays of the breast and thus are also safe. However, mammograms are not the most effective tool for screening the breasts of lactating women. Lactating women have dense breast tissue which makes it harder to obtain clear images of the breast. As with a breast self-exam, a woman should nurse or express immediately before a mammogram to drain the breasts as much as possible. Breastfeeding women should consult a mammographer experienced in reading mammograms of lactating breasts, and/or consider other diagnostic tests such as ultrasound.<br>  <br>  3. Ultrasound. Ultrasound is safe and compatible with continued breastfeeding. Ultrasounds are more effective than mammograms in determining solid breast lumps as opposed to galactoceles (milk cysts) and abscesses, and can also identify breast implant leaks.<br>  <br>  4. CAT scans and MRIs. Even when a test requires the use of a radiocontrast dye, a mother need not interrupt nursing. While the packaging inserts for contrast agents may recommend that a mother refrain from breastfeeding for 24 hours, research shows that this simply is not necessary.<br>  <br>  5. Fine needle aspiration. While surgery may be required to determine the nature of a breast lump, sometimes fine needle aspiration can be used to identify a benign cyst or galactocele. The test is relatively painless (one woman described it as similar to a blood draw) and breastfeeding can continue as usual.<br>  <br>  6. Biopsy. When a biopsy is necessary, it’s important that a mother choose a surgeon experienced in operating on a lactating breast in order to minimize the cutting of milk ducts. As with lumpectomy and mastectomy, breastfeeding can continue after this breast surgery.|`|Kl1h5dCaaa	Ohh Baby.<br>  <br>  Don't question it, go to your Doctor.

VnLaUS3Jaa	yes, doing lower weight and higher reps will definitely decrease bulk.     you will want to aim for a semi-challenging weight (about a 6 or less on a scale of 1-10, 10 being the most difficult) and perform 12 reps or more.     i do up to 50 reps using very little or no weight for my core (abs, obliques and low back) and shoulders. why little or no weight for these two areas? bc your core, of course, is the area that most people definitely do not want bulk up, and your shoulders are a muscle group that you want to be very careful with. doing a weight that is too high will almost definitely lead to injury - long term injury at that.    i usually go up to 30 reps at a semi-challenging weight (that 6 on the that scale of 1-10) for the rest of my muscle groups.    and remember, too: a long muscle is a strong muscle. in other words, stretching (making the muscle long) and holding for a minute or two most days of the week will help to make your muscles longer rather than wider.    hope this helps you out!
ParFJxnSaa	Regularly monitor your internal monologue (self talk): write down the negative ones: "I'm really ugly" and then the converse: "I'm fairly good looking", and next time you become aware that you are thinking the former, visualise, as vividly as possible, a big "STOP!!!" sign, and/or a stern faced person wagging a finger at you, and deliberately repeat 5 times, either aloud, in a big voice, if alone, or subvocally (to yourself, in your mind), the converse affirmation. Habits take about 30 - 40 repetitions to become established, with most people.     Cease comparing yourself unfavorably with others, using the STOP sign: "I am a unique individual, with potential, and my own set of skills". Keep your head up, and look people in the eye, or on the bridge of their nose. See self esteem/confidence, in section 38, at http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris and consider volunteering, even from home, at first. It will also provide a solid basis in reality for the daily affirmations: "I am a good person, who is valued by my community, because I ..(insert activity here).." Section 47 also refers. On volunteering outside the home, you will come into contact with supportive people, and receive positive feedback for your efforts, which will be obviously appreciated: there are many options; one is sure to suit you. Practise one of the relaxation methods on pages 2, 11, 2c, or 2i, daily, and when needed. Also, give the EFT a good tryout, to see if it helps you.     Section 53, and pages 2, 2.q and 2.o at ezy-build also refer. "Even though I sometimes have low self esteem/confidence, I deeply and completely accept myself", as you use the acupressure massage/tapping. Read: "Lift your mood now." by John D Preston, Psy.D. 2001, New Harbinger Publications, Inc., 5674 Shattuck Avenue, Oakland. CA 94609 http://www.amazon.com/ may be worth trying for this, (or other books on the subject, via the searchbar) as it has a good section on building self esteem, using a different approach.     Build up your self-esteem. You must take an inventory. What do you want to improve or change about the way you interact with others? Try to make only one change at a time. Always check you progress before making another change. Celebrate your journey, not your destination. Learn to always feel good about where you are now, and to exude self-confidence about anywhere you might find yourself tomorrow. Set clear goals for yourself before every interaction. Know what you want. Think about how the people you will be meeting can help you reach those goals. Then decide how to approach each person accordingly. Apply this regularly and you will notice a difference.    Be proactive. Take the initiative. Be decisive. Let the other person know exactly how he or she can help you. Proactive people tend to be more successful in their career. Treat each person you meet as if she or he is truly important. (You'll be amazed how this works.) Give a firm handshake; look the other person straight in the eye. Practice both of these. Your handshake should be just right. Not too firm and not too loose. Train yourself to notice something you like or find attractive in the person. Listen! Listen! Listen! Teach yourself to develop good listening skills. Learn a way to remember the other person's name. If in doubt simply ask for the name again 2 or 3 sentences into the conversation.Here is an exercise that can help you. It is called "Act as If." When you are in a social situation, act as if you are confident, and outgoing. Talk more, smile at everyone, ask questions, speak in a normal or excited tone, not a meek tone. Watch some of your outgoing peers, and imitate the style of their social behavior. Research shows that when you "act as if" continually, your image of yourself begins to conform to your new behavior. In this case, you will gain self-esteem and self-confidence.|`|8Z09bgu3aa	you just have to accept your self as you are  be positive and most likley wen someone puts u down is because there insecure bout themselves be a little more social   and youll feel much better  my brother was just like yu no confidence he joined a soccer team and they ended up being great friends and gave him great confidence!  good luck;]|`|Z2m8TEFHaa	Pretending to be confident doesn't work and will only make you feel like a fraud.

nCbtZAIoaa	Here are some usefull tips of my own.    Pick a date to stop smoking. Before that day, get rid of all cigarettes, ashtrays, and lighters everywhere you smoke. Do not allow anyone to smoke in your home.   Get support from your family, friends, and coworkers. Studies have shown you will be more likely to quit if you have help. Let the people important to you know the date you will be quitting and ask them for their support. Ask them not to smoke around you or leave cigarettes out. Get more support ideas.   Find substitutes for smoking and vary your routine. When you get the urge to smoke, do something to take your mind off smoking. Talk to a friend, go for a walk, or go to the movies. Reduce stress with exercise, meditation, hot baths, or reading. Try sugar-free gum or candy to help handle your cravings. Drink lots of water and juices. You might want to try changing your daily routine as well. Try drinking tea instead of coffee, eating your breakfast in a different place, or taking a different route to work.     Hope this helped with my research.|`|XvGQq1gBaa	Hello!! There are numerous free quit smoking programs that are offered through non-profit organizations. For example, the American Cancer Society offers a variety of online programs for which you can sign up. They will send you a lot of hand-outs regarding the harmful nature of smoking, and you can peruse all of their quit smoking tips. The American Cancer Society has done plenty of research regarding the effects of smoking, so their literature can be extremely motivating, specially if you are already beginning to feel the negative effects of smoking. The American Cancer Society will also send you smoking free videos that supply support and quit smoking times when you are trying to quit, and they often sponsor quit smoking support groups and twenty-four hour quit smoking hotlines.

ce9d90af4bd252d25ce81377df2eecc6aa	I think that you need to perhaps see a good counsellor who you can express yourself clearly to.  Life is all about balance.. You need to channel all of your emotions in a balanced and healthy way. If you have excess amounts of energy, then exercise is key. Not only is it healthy but it will also help control your anxiety and stress levels, as all this is is built up tension.   We are all complicated beings, but there are always reason why we either feel negative or positive.. What is it that has caused you to have emotional and behavioural problems, was it something that came from your past that has over time started up these problems?   It is important that you put good into your life, so in return you will receive good things. So making sure that you have a job you feel comfortable in, you see your friends and family often, you do things that you enjoy ie walking your dog, going for a swim or whatever it is you enjoy. I find that if I dont respect myself in return I get really unhappy.. so if I dont eat right or dont do enough exercise, or see my friends, then end result.. im miserable.  Try to implement positivity.. so when your feeling down think about the solutions hunny.. so if your lonely.. say to yourself ok im going to go and see a friend. There was a stage in my life when I was so lonely, so I started an interior design course and there I met new friends.. so thats all you need to do.. do more and start being outgoing. Dont rely too much for someone else to bring you happiness .. ie your boyfriend, when hes not around you need to pick yourself up and do good things for yourself hunny :)  I hope you start to feel better soon, dont worry you can make positive changes if you want it.. xx|`|ccOJn7q8aa	Hi    mwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa...    smile hun you just been blessed by The Shaf|`|trrHx86Waa	stay on yahoo answers, there are some pretty entertaining questions that will keep you company..:-D dont worry youll get through it!|`|K1iUzewyaa	we all go through struggles...

No.  Bring your life back to a simple state where you enjoy the outdoors, take your dog for a walk every single day and repeat to yourself when you worry about things in the future that 'later is just more of now'   You're coping with 'now' alright aren't you? So the future is just more of 'now'.    Don't pressure your boyfriend or he will have reason to leave you, try to be fun and smile at him.  Keep sleeping to night time and get out in the day and you will feel more normal.    There is no such thing as normal by the way - everyone is screwed up somehow, sorry - but you're not that special, dependence is normal, ocd - yeah - pretty common and depression - thats just a big word, shrug it all off and get outside, start exersizing and enjoy your life you only get one go at it.|`|iDqVy21gaa	You need a comfort blanket      Seriously      Pick out one of your boyfriends sweaters or a shirt that's not been washed that smells of him    And wear it until he comes home to you    You can always call him if you need to hear his voice      Then walk the dog because he needs excercising too and get plenty of good fresh air.  Sleeping so long is unhealthy, and is just making your muscles week so you feel fatigued when you do go out, so maybe you need an excersise routine for doing at home?  Get a dvd you can work out to in your room.  Open some windows to get some air circulating        The other thing you can do is masturbate.  It will actually help you relax|`|NiRSOC3yaa	Watch a really funny film on TV  Or watch something funny on youtube.    Think about it as less then 24hours before your boyfriend gets home!

A7lghafHaa	you must go see the dentist or oral surgeon who did the work  and be evaluated  typically it will be within one month when your nerve will regain normal function (if it is in fact damaged)  best of luck|`|DzHB8z6Yaa	Step 1:Chomp down on the gauze packing placed in your mouth during your wisdom teeth extraction. In fact, this gauze should stay in your mouth for about an hour. Then, replace it with another packing of gauze. Keep the area packed for about 8 hours.     Step2:Refrain from brushing your teeth for the first 24 hours. This could prevent the blood from clotting properly. The blood clot created from wisdom teeth extraction eventually turns into bone and gum tissue, so this clot is very important.     Step3:Place a tea bag over the clot 24 hours after your wisdom teeth extraction if it still oozes a small amount of blood. This will help to restrict the blood vessels and stop the bleeding.     Step 4:Place 1/2 teaspoon salt into a cup of warm water and swish it around the surgical sight 24 hours after wisdom teeth extraction. This will help easy pain and speed up healing. Do not, however, spit out the water, simply let it drip out of your mouth over the sink.     Step 5:Use tylenol or any type of prescribed medication from your oral surgeon after your wisdom teeth extraction. You can also you hot and cold compresses on the outside of your jaw. This actually does quite a bit for the pain.|`|NmqMKHvWaa	Yes, it is a very good thing that you are getting the "tingling" as that means healing to the damaged nerve is occurring.  There's nothing that I know of which will speed up this process , which usually takes as long as 6mo to a year,but you might try taking multivitamins.|`|1CEB0NW1aa	I had the same thing happen when I got mine removed. They said it had to do with the nerves around the root of the tooth and that its very common. It took almost a year before my feeling came back compleatly, but it came and went throughout that time. Make sure you have a soft bristled toothbrush when brushing your teeth. Don't be eating really solid foods, try staying with baby-like foods. Soup, applesauce, yogurt. I wouldn't eat too many things with acids for a little while either. Just for about another week or so, until it's healed over. When you brush in the area where your teeth were, be really gentle. Its important to brush those back teeth so you don't get any plaque build-up. Plaque is nothing but bacteria and can cause infection if it gets into the open areas. Try icing the painful areas and if you notice anything that doesn't seem quite right, call your dentist because he/she may want to see what is going on.|`|TqPtbwhraa	I had my four wisdom teeth taken out on Oct 6 of 2008 and I for about 2-3 months I had no feeling in my jaw and lips.  When I started to get some feeling back I started getting shooting pains in my chin.  Most of the feeling is back now but now I feel like my lip and chin are always sore now.  I don't know what to do either, I need to see the dentist again to find out what to do.|`|W9231Egtaa	tingling and numbness is sometimes a side effect of removing wisdom teeth.  it will usually go away on its own.  when removing the teeth, the nerves in the area may be damaged temporarily (or permanently, but this is not common.) also, your face and your gums are swollen, and are pressing on all sorts of nerves inside of your mouth.  if you feel like you are experiencing a lot of tingling to the point where it's abnormal, call the surgeon and just make him aware of the situation.  but really, in a few days to a week you should start feeling better.  i had two of mine out on the 16th of january, and for the first few days after i was also wishing i hadn't bothered with it, but now i'm feeling almost back to normal, and i'm glad i did.|`|COFoMJYEaa	What a surprise !!. Even my wisdom teeth was removed on Jan 29th. but I don't have any numb feeling now.. I suggest you complete the course of medicines given for healing and I strongly believe our saliva is the best medicine which heals quickly.

It is often overlooked but - a colon cleansing routine can clear out fermenting debris, and parasites that could be making you feel fat and bloated  - and ordinary 'dieting' just won't get rid of these problems so it is highly recommended to consider doing:    (Having problems resubbing with an info link for how to colon cleanse so I sent it to you = hope this OK puma)

KolRRS6yaa	This figures refer to the Beats Per Minute (BPM) of your heart. 120 is the average rate at which peoples cardiovascular systems are in good operation and there is blood circulating right around the body well.     A low to moderate heart rate of 135 over a period greater than 30minutes can initiate the fat burning process.    A high heart rate of 170 initiates the Carbohydrate burning process.    130 is the optimal range for Fat Burning for most people.    Hope this helps,
ziVtTtObaa	The size of the 'girls' are related to a couple of things. First is genetics. Look at pics of your mom and grandmother when they were your age and your size. Also weight does play a factor. Breast tissue is largely adipose tissue which is fat. But you don't want to gain weight just to increase bra size. Buy a push up bra that is padded, Alot of the girls you see are wearing these and you don't even realize it. You are healthy and Intelligent don't worry about bra size. You are prefect the way you are.|`|87nG6aKaaa	i think so|`|Lw3OnqEtaa	Yes, you will grow more in the chest area. when i was 14 i was 36B and im now 15 and im a 38C. So you could develope more, or you could stay the same.<br>  But most likely you will grow more.<br>  <br>  and if you are worried about your diease you should ask you doctor if it will have any affect.<br>  <br>  Good Luck:)
GmYZcOs6aa	i think it's a really good idea to see a school counselor, but there is no need to be worried about it. usually they will expect you to start off the conversation, since they aren't mind-readers and won't know why you're there. i suggest you start off by saying you don't like talking about yourself and don't really know what to say, but you've been feeling down and thought you should talk to someone. once you say that, then they'll start asking questions and all you have to do is answer. they are very understanding and if you aren't comfortable with a question you don't have to answer. good luck and please talk to them! xx|`|IVjspiStaa	just make an appointment.  talking to someone not related to you or your situation can be very freeing. you don't need to have the burden of the world on your shoulders.  good luck|`|6qsocyK3aa	This is a really good idea. If you got referred to a councellor through your doctor, chances are you'd wait months so make the most of having one at your school. Most councellors will understand you'd be nervous and would ask questions to encourge you to speak. If you're worried just let her know how nervous you are. :)
BRDqfAy3aa	1. you had unprotected sex on XX day of cycle which is not very fertile day and risk is not high (read below about your fertile days)<br>  2. if you would have unusual period (light! short!) - could be pregnancy<br>  3. if you have unprotected sex on fertile days - risk for pregnancy is about 50-60%<br>  4. pregnancy test can be done after 3 weeks after sex (read below about pregnancy tests)<br>  5. take care of yourself - read about safer sex, dual contraception and STDs|`|FI916ISFaa	Of course,  You were either ovulating or had just ovulated (if you are regular) and you can get pregnant for a few days after you ovulate.  Take a pregnancy test if you don't start your next period on time (about Feb 27 or 28).|`|9DqGQpPTaa	you need to know the first day of your period. how long is normally in between each period (first day to first day). Then divide that number in half, that's how many days it should be when you ovulate. then during that week if you were to have unprotected sex, there is a high chance of getting pregnant. but this isn't fool proof.<br>  <br>  so for instance:<br>  if you got your period on say January 20 and say the one before that started on December 23, that would be 28 days. 28 day cycles normally ovulate on the 14th day, but everyone is different, it could be the 15th or 16th or 13th day. so during the week of your 14th day, you are more likely to get pregnant, assuming your cycle is 28 days. but again i wouldnt rely on this heavily.<br>  <br>  i'm not sure if that answers your question fully but i tried.
oy7mNHJNaa	You can go for either a horomone or copper based IUD.      I went with the paraguard copper IUD because I didn't want to use horomones anymore.  I still have a normal period every month and it lasts for 10 years.    The mirena generally causes shorter/lighter periods and some people have no period at all.  It lasts for 5 years.|`|BRDqfAy3aa	discover everything about IUDs - see "Contraception" and "IUDs"|`|VerfhAQcaa	Well Mirena is a good one. I am on it, but I don't get my periods due to a medicine that I take.|`|0eu05OOxaa	Mirena is very good. But the side affect can be that it can stop your period altogether! But on the other hand the mirena can also just make them very short and light. As i have this coil. The first time i had it i didn't have period's for 5 years. Then i had it removed and the same type put back in and i now have periods which last 2 days and so light i only use panty liners. But Just going for the normal coil will not stop your periods so maybe this one will be best for you. But the mirena is brill.-x Side affects vary talk to the nurse they very good at this. But after having it in can cause cramps for 2-3 days. But all in all go for it-x
oGyL9WJ1aa	Yea it is hard to remember unless you make the commitment to do it every time you brush at night. It is very important to floss so hopefully knowing that will remind you.|`|YBcB0732aa	Yep, I learn the habit when I got braces. It takes FOREVER to floss with braces. You have to thread the floss in between the braces....    Its 50x easier and faster to floss without braces.|`|2qPtGTNcaa	Yeah. Every single day, especially at night. It helps to keep your breath fresh. Otherwise the food gets trapped between your teeth, rots and smells.|`|8e373a7bc6b3c784f2bae9cc02a6cf20aa	I do!  I had a problem doing it regularly when I was a kid -- and my dentist said "If you can do it on the days you go to school, that would be an improvement."  So I worked it into my regular routine.  Now I do it every day -- and I don't even think about it!  (I have a friend that does it in the shower every morning!)|`|b49e8d9e5eae5116fe7fbd18594b5942aa	I do it most days. It's actually more important than brushing your teeth it gets to the parts your tooth brush does not reach, Once you start flossing you will get into the habit|`|vmSVtI8Zaa	floss those you like to keep!    haha. flossing can remove bacterial that is harmful and cause gum disease.    Try to floss at least once every 2 day, if not daily.  All the best!
QsrX5CY3aa	Gravity boots and inversion therapy will fix this.  It did for me.  I had surgery in 04 and even after the surgery I still had stiffness, sciatica and weak legs.  My friend let me hang upside down on his gravity rack and after only one treatment I could feel the muscles of my abs, legs, back and hips all start to loosen up, relax and un knot.  I hang upside down daily and when I need relief from pain.  This could do it for you and the whole set up is only $150.00.  Google: online health mart sciatica :to read about how it will help you.  Take care.|`|AA10240904	You need to know how you strained your back and avoid that.<br>  <br>  Try laying in bed with a pillow either under bent knees or on your side with a pillow between the knees slightly bent<br>  <br>  Use ice for 15 minutes every hour<br>  <br>  Avoid one sided activities like cleaning, vacuuming, dusting, etc.<br>  <br>  Do not life anything over 5 pounds (bag of sugar)<br>  <br>  SEE a doctor|`|AA10150940	If you are still dealing with pain you will probably need to ice your back some still.  About 20 min. at a time, 2 or 3 times a day.<br>  <br>  To start you need to rest it until the pain level backs down.<br>  <br>  Then start with basic back exercises.<br>  Such as:<br>  Lay on the floor on your back.  Legs together.  Slowly lift your legs so your feet are about 6 inches off the ground.  Count to 10.  <br>  Now keeping your fee 6 inches off the ground spread your legs as wide as you can and hold it for 10 seconds again count to 10.  Slowly bring your legs back together keeping your feet 6 inches off the ground.  Count to 10.  Set your feet down slowly.  Relax.  <br>  Try to work up to doing that 10 times but don't push too fast or too hard.<br>  <br>  Another one:<br>  While laying on the floor on your back, roll up onto your shoulders and support your hips with your arms.  With your feet in the air move your legs slowly in a motion like pedaling a bike.  Go for about 60 seconds and then rest.  Then do it again.  Again work up to about 10 times.<br>  <br>  These are a couple of basic ones but you can probably find more at a site like WebMD or something.<br>  <br>  Good luck.
6bkB89Jmaa	Look mate don't mind that crap about holding in your stomach when doing weights Theres a plenty of exercises that you can do to work your core you don't need to incorporate this into your other exercises so just focus on inhaling as you bring the weight in and exhale as you bring the weight out, it is very important that you breath correctly when lifting weighs for the flat stomach all you can do is just diet and AB crunches for the physique, no bodybuilder gets any were without diet and eating correctly, i hope im not been to hard on you LOL but look if you are going to work out work out correctly, i hope i've been of some help and good luck too you.|`|VPkuM2xWaa	Forget flyes for now and hit the bench press.

ETJfEHS0aa	ABSOLUTELY!  I always bring my mp3 player with me to the dentist.  but make sure you ask if it  is ok.

JPCZCPE1aa	Sounds like a pretty harmless fantasy to me. I have heard of lots of people with it.    It does NOT mean he needs therapy (unless of course he / she finds it distressing or it is getting in the way of normal life).    It is not an example of Oedipuss complex. Freud's theories have for the most part been discredited.|`|DMpVSHvXaa	It's a harmless fantasy.      (How do you know that He-Man's not an adult baby in his spare time?)|`|cj7CYD9haa	why do you care what your friends bf Fantasy is? That's better left in their bed room between the two of them.    Get a a life.|`|GmYZcOs6aa	sounds like he has some mommy issues.. everyone has fantasies, but that one is definitely a little bit abnormal. i think you should tell your friend to tell her boyfriend to see a therapist, he definitely needs it.  here's some psychology theories if you're interested: ever heard of the Oedipus complex? according to Freud, you experience a stage as a child where you're attracted to the parent of the opposite sex. to get over this stage, you associate with the parent of the same sex by picking up their mannerisms and so on. however, it's possible the child gets stuck in one stage and never fully moves on. if you're considering this theory, it sounds like your friend's boyfriend is still stuck in that stage of his childhood. did something traumatic happen to him at that age? was his father very distant or not around at all? those are some things to consider. but bottom line is: he needs THERAPY!  good luck hope this helped a little xx|`|cnCnSsWraa	what's normal what's not i mean we live in the age of chaos why bother to think in someone elses fantasy i mean i know that when ur gonna be around him ur gonna act kinda weird but ive seen worst things.                as someone said here its possible that he have a sexual fantasy with hes mother in other word ''mummy issues'' 55% of men have fantasy's allot alike like .

Depending on your  initial  weight,  you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If you don't  eat  wheat  then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey cakes, you  don't  eat  junk  food,  and  you don't eat biscuits. But your diet is  still  balanced.

It gives you some room to eat the fun stuff but not too much and basically shows you how to eat a balanced and nutritious diet. Even if you don't have to lose weight it's still good to stay on because it gives you a wonderful guide on how to eat properly from day to day.|`|Mf6fxWM7aa	Dont diet- you shouldnt minimise the amount of food you eat, but just minimise eating any unhealthy food and maximise exercise.    If you eat a large breakfast (fruit, cereal, toast) every morning, you wont feel hungry until lunch. For meals try and eat foods with grains (bread, rice) and protein (like fish, eggs). Use wholemeal bread and wholemeal rice and get some vegetables in. For snacks eat nuts, fruits (dried as well as fresh) and cereal bars. Make sure you dont keep junk food in the house or you'll get tempted.     Exercise 20mins a day (floor exercises, jogging) and you can build this up to 25 minutes, 30 etc, as you get more comfortable with exercising.

pMmOXlZ6aa	Ok what you just said about your chest and abs is all wrong. First off your legs are 2/3 of your overall muscle. Lets say u only trained ur abs and ur pecs and abs in isolation. You would not gain anything but strength, what you want is too look "buff". Doing squats and lunges or other lower body exercises will grow your body in proportion. Trust me, if you only did chest & abs you get less results. Workout your entire body not just the mirror muscles.|`|dJuEtGxraa	Here are a few tips;<br>  <br>  WHEN to eat for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? Eat (at least) three times a day. <br>  Because when you eat only once a day, your metabolism gets slower than it already is! That's the main reason. Sounds funny, but to lose weight... you must eat (the right things, of course) <br>  ? Eat low-fat, high-fiber foods such as salads and vegetable pastas.<br>  ? Your last meal should be before 18:00. Try. <br>  OK, one apple after 18:00 <br>  ? Don't starve <br>  Starvation is not good for losing weight, nor your health. <br>  Starvation is the worse thing you can do in a weight loss diet. <br>  ? Try oatmeal instead of cornflakes for breakfast--eating oatmeal can help reduce cholesterol levels, and its high fiber content will keep you full longer.<br>  <br>  WHAT to drink for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? Drink 6-8 glasses of water every day ! <br>  Can be tap, plain, mineral, sparkling. I just love mineral sparkling water! <br>  This improves your bowel, reduces the "hunger" sensation, and hydrates your skin. Your skin will look much better after the first weeks! <br>  Don't believe the slogan "water makes me fat". Beside being stupid... you might get into serious troubles with your kidneys. <br>  ? Drink ONLY natural juices, freshly squeezed! <br>  Don't drink Coca Cola, Pepsi, Spite etc. during the diet. Even lite or light versions. <br>  <br>  <br>  Exercise for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? If you want quicker results - exercise would be good. <br>  ? Don't just sit in front of the TV and eat peanuts... <br>  I guarantee THIS won't work for your weight loss... <br>  ? Start a regular exercise program and stick with it. Don't be afraid of those sweat suits and Lycra pants! <br>  ? Start swimming. Swimming is an excellent exercise to get involved with, since it increases blood flow and uses muscles we don't regularly use. Start a swimming program and try to do it 3 times a week. You will feel excellent and rejuvenated.<br>  ? Choose an exercise program that you enjoy, and don't shun the unconventional. For instance, did you know that regular vigorous dancing is exercise too?<br>  ? Also Cardiovascular exercises such as running, jogging, or aerobics will help you lose that unwanted belly fat. Weight training can also help you lose body fat because the more muscle mass you have, the more ability your system has to burn body fat.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  Hope this helps~|`|NehcVw5Zaa	Well, your young and still growing so don't expect overnight miracles. Allot of times when your around your age your metabolism makes it next to impossible to gain weight.<br>  <br>  <br>  Start lifting and keep a journal on your results, that way the next week you can add some more weight each time. Don't over due it, muscles need time to rest and grow.<br>  <br>  The only thing I would recommend to take is a multi vitamin, and drink some protein shakes daily. Protein is the key to muscle growth. Eat alot of Chicken, and foods high in protein.

Viruses are communicable organisms.|`|ZsCqfPaZaa	Um, viruses aren't caused by stress.  They exist on their own.  That said, stress can affect whether or not the virus can battle against your immune system enough to display itself [by means of cold sores].    How old is your daughter?  What else did you think it was?|`|JF343E2Taa	yes stress can cause a lot of things like cold sores etc etc|`|HDIlfcpKaa	yh ive heard of that many people get cold sores because of stress, trust me!|`|sgYgly7Vaa	Yes its true.  Stress lowers your immune system response and makes you more susceptible to infection and cold sores.
evB63qWvaa	It probably is a pimple in its early stage.  When they first appear, they have no pus head on them and if you do take a needle to them, only a little bit would come out followed by blood.  So, it's probably a pimple and the best thing for it was be acne medication to get rid of it faster or cordizone.|`|Tt2pFEqFaa	I get those all the time. It is probably just a cystic pimple. But some acne medicine on it and don't put lip gloss or lipstick on it because it will clog the pores.<br>  <br>  If all else fails, it might be a cold sore.|`|4WVbjbWxaa	hey<br>  <br>  you should nt have used the needle... please tell your parents about it... you should not use iron for such things|`|GhrJVbFEaa	My advice, leave it alone. I have found over the years that the worst scarring happens in the area around the lips and on the chin. I know what you mean about the bumps in those areas. These pores could be clogged with who knows what. Also, it seems that something like collagen from your lips can come out in long strips - not like a pimple but different and unique to the area right along where your lip meets your face. I am not sure what it is either, but again, I suggest avoiding agrivating it. Scarring is not nice.|`|4Uf0PNq5aa	Hmm.. Sounds like an undeveloped pimple.<br>  Pimples are like love.

It helps heal and deminish scars as well.  Perhaps you may find that it is more affordable than quite a few other products on the market.  There are a few other products as well that do the same thing but are merely copycats.  <br>  <br>  Before starting anything that has to be used over a duration of time, read all the provided information and ASK questions... lots and lots of questions.  Anyone who won't take the time to answer questions about their product... move on.  <br>  <br>  Please consider this link for Proactiv -  <a href="http://www.proactiv.com/index.php?pactvid=8b5bd1cf00f4516151cc70352438887d" rel="nofollow">http://www.proactiv.com/index.php?pactvi...</a><br>  <br>  It could change more than just your scars and is WAY more affordable and a little bit goes a VERY long way.  You'll see after just a few uses that it pretty much has paid for itself.|`|aaoWVDxMaa	SAME position as you. I don't even get it either. I don't squeeze them. Mine tend to fade after a year or so, I recommend you use a daily face/cleansing product just to make sure your skin gets clear and to keep it clean. I have this year and it's really started making a difference. Try the brand Vichy, if you are male, they have their own "male" products too, which is useful. If you're female, then you have plenty to choose from. You might want to invest in a foundation just to cover up the scars. Annoying but I'm guessing you're a teenager and our skin is constantly changing so just hoping the scars will fade!!! You might want to try Bio-oil too. It's meant to tone down the scars but I can't really see any improvement from using that

I have a lot of headaches myself, things that work great for mine are Excedrin, and or peppermint oil - rub a little bit on your forehead and it will ease the headache, you can get it at health food stores. Tylenol or ibuprofen works for some people. Best of luck!!!!|`|CINdqEhzaa	If you're under alot of pressure or stress, your body may get overwhelmed with that and the way your body deals with it is by a massive headache. The concerntration levels could mean that your body is concerntrating on other stuff that your worried about. Try and do something that will relax you, for example listening to realaxing music and calmly dealing with everything.    I leave you with a joke;    What do you call a room with no doors and no windows?

If your eyes have to work very hard to focus on what you're looking at it can give you a headache. It could also be the monitor that you are using for your PC. Or it could be that you, like me, get stress related headaches. If you're stressing about things and are worked up a lot this can apparently give you excruciating headaches. Best advice is to try to calm down, and try to find an over the counter medicine that takes the edge off til you can go and have your eyes checked or de-stress.
9cba094486c6e7ab49a59ac5ea44682faa	Which pill has he given you? Re- edit this question with the name of the pill. In terms of less side effects, the best pill on the market today is Cerazette. Yasmin is the best for acne. <br>  <br>  All medications can have potential side effects, there are no ways to know who will be effected by them and to what extent. Sometimes contraceptive pills at first it can cause spot break outs- this generally gets better over time. Weight gain on the pill is a rare side effect. Many women simply blame the pill for their over eating. <br>  <br>  Reduction in sex drive and mood swings are rare side effects- but can happen.<br>  <br>  Edit<br>  Yes Yasmin is very good for acne management. The vast majority of women will not experience adverse side effects- only a small minority will. There is no way for us to know how you will tolerate it. We all respond to medication differently. It's trial and error. There is no 'one suits all' pill. Try it and see how you get on with it. Typically spots will get worse at first. then get better.<br>  <br>  The net price of Yasmin - 3 x 21-tab pack = ￡14.70 <br>  Cilest - 3 × 21-tab pack = ￡5.97.|`|UUtTDAJraa	This is pretty normal for birth control...I was in your same situation and tried everything to restore it.  I switched pills a couple times and gave up, the libido was just not coming back.  I then found a natural herbal enhancer that is supposed to increase your sex drive and a couple other things.  It's called Hersolution gel, read up about it at herenhancement.com where I saved on it at the time.  However it's like an instant libido rush and as I kept using it my sex drive was through the roof and continues to be.  The sensation blast is great too, I can't tell you how many times I've had multiple orgasms when before I couldn't even get a single one.  Theres also capsules you can take that I've heard are better but I don't like swallowing many pills throughout the day.  I was skeptical at first but the return policy was so great that the company was offer.  From what I remember you had to try it out for a couple months but then you had time afterwards to return it for a full money back if it didn't work.  I didn't have that problem as you can see.  Well good luck and I hope this helps.|`|tKNYGM5Aaa	<a href="http://healths-school.synthasite.com/?q=Oral%20Contaceptive%20Pill" rel="nofollow">http://healths-school.synthasite.com/?q=...</a>
59GymH27aa	There isn't many ways.  They can't freeze your tongue due to the risk of you swallowing it.  I had my tongue pierced and have now taken it out as I was becoming a Mum and didn't think it would look right. I can honestly say it was one of the worst decisions.  I couldn't eat anything for a month...lived on soup, yoghurt and water.  It also leaves a nasty mark once you take it out.|`|K1oOQqqVaa	The best way is not to do it.|`|NwiJ1MBUaa	Do not get your tongue pierced.  Infection from this happens, can be really painful, and can be life threatening.  Find a safer way to express yourself.|`|aR1OiJ7Waa	The real pain comes when infection sets in and you need to have your tongue amputated.      Most pain killers will thin your blood and make the procedure very dangerous.      This piercing is also the easiest was to contract Hepatitis A and B.  Enjoy your tongue stud.|`|w4mPekKbaa	Basically keep ice on it, and don't eat foods that will bang up against it, for 2 weeks and it should be good.    Had one for 7 years and it wasn't painful and eat solid food 1 week after and still have it, now I can take it out with out any bumps or scars, and place it back when I want it back in.|`|V49nP5ZHaa	the people i know who have had their tongues pierced sed it hurts when it is done but eat liquid food and ice and ice cream etc and keep talking right down it heals quick and there is a low risk of infection when it is done professionally.  you cant really reduce pain just keep it cold and clean and look after it.  and don't look when they peirce it my dad almsot fainted and it looks horrible but my mum sed its okay and so did my mate.  hope this helps|`|jaGU3zyyaa	I know of 2 people who had pericarditis ( inflammation of the lining of the heart) after getting their tongues pierced.  Do you really want to do this?|`|0vQbPqbwaa	Put some ice on it or take some Ibprofen.|`|581c9449a696e0a66ef072cffe47dd5caa	The actual piercing doesn't hurt actually.  If you talk alot you may begin to get sore.  Sucking on ice and avoiding having to chew for the first day or so is best.      To tell you the truth I got my tongue pierced and then went to a BBQ.  I ate but I had to put the food in tiny portions to the side of my mouth and just swallow.  Rinse out every tme you put anything in your mouth.... Water, Ice, food... anything.  And you'll be fine.     If you keep talking to a minimum you'll reduce the chance of swelling and eliminate any pain that would be caused by swelling.  There are no nerves where the piercing goes so you don't really know it's done until after it's done.  I had my ears pierced when I was 13 and I still remember the pain, I never got that second hole.  My ear lobes when I  hurt wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy worse than my tongue piercing.
S6JIqzjEaa	What you have described is short-sightedness.  You can get a free eye test and the optician will give you a voucher that will enable you to get free glasses if you need them.  At specsavers the voucher completely covers the cost of the glasses, and they have a good selection of frames for you to choose from.  Hope you get on ok.|`|ZA18KoC9aa	you are shortsighted and should get glasses for distance.

This is not a wive's tale, it really works.|`|EX1GjjJCaa	Hold your breath or make yourself burp. It's caused by an abrupt rush of air to the lungs, causing the hiccup.    If they persist though, then you could get medical treatment, but this is very rare. That would only be needed if you had them for weeks.    Otherwise, just wait and do what I mentioned above. They will subside soon enough.|`|7oF2o4q5aa	As hiccups are caused by spasm of the diaphragm, try holding your breath and pushing your stomach out for 15 seconds.  This will help "stretch" the area.  Repeat as necessary.|`|1AZgNfSBaa	pinch your nose, don't breathe, gulp saliva as much as you can and as long as you hold your breath. worked for me. if it doesnt work, repeat the procedure until your hiccups go away.|`|eb603a32531b733c208d6a3685da0228aa	All of the above are perfectly valid things to try to stop a case of hiccups.   Well, maybe not standing upside down and drinking- but the others you hear.  Even the doctors will suggest using them first.  Most hiccups are caused when the diaphram gets out of sync with your breathing.  If the hiccups just persist, then there are a few remedies.  These are:  Medication. Several forms of medication may be effective for treating hiccups. The most commonly used is chlorpromazine (Thorazine). Other medications that may be helpful include metoclopramide (Reglan), anticonvulsants, benzodiazepines and baclofen (Lioresal).     Carotid sinus massage. Your carotid sinus is located in your neck, just below your jaw and just above the point where your carotid artery  a blood vessel that supplies blood to your brain  divides into its two main branches. Massage of your carotid sinus may help eliminate hiccups. This hiccups treatment should be performed only by your health care provider. Don't try carotid massage at home: It can be dangerous.     Nasogastric (NG) tube. If your stomach is distended, a thin, flexible tube inserted through your nose and into your stomach (nasogastric tube) may stop hiccups by providing relief from stomach distention. The tube usually is removed as soon as the hiccups stop.     Nerve block. Rarely, if other treatments aren't effective, your doctor may recommend an injection of an anesthetic to block your phrenic nerve to stop hiccups.     However, none of these remedies are given to you if you just happen to get hiccups and a wild desire to visit the ER.   As a rule, they don't even try them until you've had the hiccups for more than a day, or they interfere with your ability to breath or hold fluids/food down.  In most cases hiccups will go away all by themselves, whether you use grannies favorite remedy or not.  And don't discount grannies idea either- there are many times when the idea that something will work actually is the reason it works.  And if something works, don't knock it.|`|4ltupRctaa	sorry to have to tell you but drinking water upside down is not a old wife's tale if done correct.    simply bend over and drink the water opposite to how you would normally.. it does work

They put me on 2 different antibiotics for two weeks - had to take 6 in total everday and was put on a prescription acid reducer 2 times a day for 30 days also had to take pepto on top of all of that.

65ecae20f0ade905381af6cc841421f0aa	I am sad to tell you that your penis is pretty small.<br>  <br>  The truth is painful, and I am not sure you want to hear it, but penis size is the most important thing in how much pleasure a guy can give a girl in sex.<br>  <br>  Some girls say that a big penis is good, but skills as a lover is better. Well, maybe that is true, but a guy with a big penis AND skills is obviously the best of all.<br>  <br>  Consider this also. A guy with an average penis and good skills will always be only that, you can't make his penis bigger. But a guy with a big penis and not so great skills can be educated by the right woman (like me!) and will then give the best of all worlds.<br>  <br>  So to sum up, penis size is all important, because everything else can be improved and changed, except for that.|`|GrqsnWtiaa	Why do you need our opinions? as long as your partner is satisfied, you dont need people on the internet that you never met nor seen for any input about YOUR penis size.|`|NXBmcEz7aa	Penis size helps a lot to boost your ego, but not enough to fully satisfies a woman.  You need a lot of arts and techniques to really accomplish what woman wants.  Your size is average and really good enough to satisfy a woman, if you combined it with good arts and techniques of love making.  A woman depth is only 3 to 4 inches, and you have an extra two inches already.  Make the best use of it.  Read more books or ask trusted friends.  Those love making arts and techniques will endear you more to your woman and will long for you<br>  more often.|`|y9N3DsKBaa	Are you serious?

I heard rumors that girls only feel the first couple inches anyways.<br>  <br>  If you think about it, if it is too small it wouldn't work because she wouldn't feel it. If it is too big you can't fit the whole thing in so the extra couple inches are pretty much useless. 6 inches is the average size and a good size to please your girlfriend.|`|8cmcU5nAaa	You probably have a 2 inch dick if your really concerned.

eb603a32531b733c208d6a3685da0228aa	Most tonsillectomies are done as a day patient procedure, and you only stay overnight if there is a problem or potential for complications.  Where I work, patients having a tonsillectomy usually check in about 6am and get prepped.  They are usually in surgery between 8 and 11am.  They spend about an hour or so in recovery, and are back in their room by lunch, or shortly afterwards.  Most are on their feet doing fine by then, mid-afternoon at the latest, and glad to go home to their own beds.  You are going to feel miserable no matter where you are for the first few days, and there's really nothing special a hospital can provide for you that you won't have at home.  You will have the same medications for pain, and you will be on a mostly liquid diet, no matter if you are at home or in a hospital bed.  Unless you have a pre-existing medical condition that makes you a greater risk for post-op complications, like a bleeding disorder, you really are better off at home.  Years ago, folks had their tonsils removed at home, usually on the dining room table- and they did just fine.  Not that I'm suggesting that is how we should do it now by any means, but for recovery it just makes better sense.  You will be a slightly higher risk for catching infections afterwards, and the hospital is full of really sick people and some funky germs.  Aside from the operative wound, you go in a basically healthy person.  The hospital is not a good place for a basically healthy person to hang out any longer than they absolutely have to.  The longer you stay in there, the more likely you are to pick up something you don't want.  So if a day surgery is an option, you should take it.  People are always less miserable at home, in their own jammies and bed, with folks who love them, than they are in a strange bed surrounded by people they don't know.|`|9NpXU7D2aa	usually its done on an outpatient basis (meaning you get there in the morning, have the surgery, and leave in the afternoon)<br>  the only reasons you would have inpatient surgery is if you went to the ER and they couldn't do the surgery until the following day, the hospital you're going to gives you the option of staying the night to recover, or if there is a complication after surgery that they want to keep you to monitor.|`|03vbT9olaa	I work in the emergency room, we see a few people that have had out patient tonsillectomy come in for bleeding afterwards.<br>  Do not ever do this outpatient on Friday, as your Dr will not be in the office the next days.<br>  We did have an 7 year old girl die after her surgery was done the day before.  That is the only one I have seen in 14 years in the ER.

muHctmaGaa	Sex has a very fluid definition, comprising several different acts. It can be oral, anal, vaginal, or digital. You don't need to involve a penis to have sex. (Otherwise would you claim lesbians cannot have sex together? Not counting the porn-inspired idea they all use dildos or strap-ons.) <br>  <br>  But yes, fingering involves the insertion of one or several fingers into a woman's vagina, thrusting, pressing, turning, twisting - whatever goes on afterwards - to the point of orgasm. When it involves the entire hand, that's more like fisting, which is a very harsh (but entirely possible) sexual act.|`|brvOa9QYaa	fingering is different to sex.<br>  <br>  fingering - penetration of vagina by fingers.<br>  <br>  sex - penetration of vagina by penis. (mans sex organs)|`|InI33juraa	umm no fingering is when a persons finger goes into a woman..specifically her vagina or anus! sex can be anything intimate..intercourse is actual penis inside vagina, or anus..and oral sex is obviously mouth! i hope u arent thinking of experiencing any of these because if u need to ask the difference u definately arent ready for sex or anything sexual!|`|AA10975334	No, it's not the same thing. It is a part of foreplay which leads to intimacy, it is stimulating as the guy massages her insides with his fingers (putting it politely) and helps the woman be ready  for intercourse.|`|rhHgrohdaa	Being "fingered" is when the guy uses his hand to move up and down in your vagina instead of his Penis.

The vaginal tissues are very delicate, it is very easy to cause damage and have some bleeding.  It will heal up.|`|KfptxDDtaa	Its possible that sex can make the blood flow out from the inner vagina sooner than gravity would make it come out but ita unlikely.  it would have to be very close to when you start your period anyway.

n7bok7NRaa	If you have mobility in your toe, test it. That is to say, if you can normally wiggle your pinky toe, wiggle it and see if you can make it respond and most importantly, see if you can make it curl. Yes, this will hurt, a lot, but will tell you if you've just bruised the heck out of it, or if you've broken it.    Either way, to anchor it and give it support, if you have some medical tape and gauze, wrap it lightly in gauze (to protect it against another blow) and them tape it to your 'ring' toe. Make sure not to cut off the blood flow (don't wrap it too tight).    As for what a doctor can do other than wrap it like I've described, is give you some pain meds that work better than an aspirin. Other than that, they're not going to be able to do much for your toe. Hopefully it'll feel better soon.    Edit: Since you say you've got no mobility in your toe to begin with, there is really no way to tell if your toe is broken or not. Wrap it as I describe and if you can go to a clinic or hospital and get them to check it with an xray - but there's really not much they can do for poor little pinky toes, the bones are just too small to do anything for, other than to keep them from getting hurt further while they heal naturally.|`|YKbiJADQaa	It will be sore for a bit, it could be intrernal brusing or bleeding, give it a few weeks.|`|YO5PliJ9aa	Well Sir, how long ago did this happen?

If its broken the hospital will do nothing much for you...so you can just ice the toe and tape it to the toe next door...and take painkillers...taping,pankillers and ice is also the treatment for it if its been relocated after a dislocation.|`|c2YcBbXyaa	i can tell you what NOT to do...don't tape an ice cream stick to it because when you walk into the kitchen you might hang it up on the door jam and break it worse
9ko5WUFkaa	It may have been broken.  But it's not broken now, it would have healed pretty close to them time it happened.  But yeah, it could be the cause of the bump you now have.    As to if heathcare will cover costs to fix it - they will, but it's probably going to need surgery and that's an elective procedure (meaning that it is not urgent or life threatening).  You'll end up on a waiting list could be waiting for years (for something like that where I live it could be 10 years).|`|K6fasl6kaa	you have time to get it fixed when you see the dr.  it may just be growing.  if it was broke ten years ago, it has healed by now.  try not to worry.|`|jDFEo7tWaa	Your bones would have fused back together by now, so if anything, they just fused back in a way that was not like before. Sometimes your bones fuse in a way that isn't too great for you, so it's a good thing you'll be seeing a doctor. You would probably be able to get it fixed with surgery.

It just does not make sense|`|fPJTZwoUaa	circumsised looks prettier|`|be7fa0634428c392bea013827c4cd1deaa	It's there for a reason so skin is def better for you.  you should only be cut if you really need it.|`|3uGcqN2Eaa	I had my foreskin until I was 49 but had to have it removed because it was too tight and I kept getting fungal infections.

Only in severe cases of phismosis (tightening of the foreskin) should the foreskin be removed.  The human race would not have survived these thousands of years if it had not been for the foreskin.  It provides protection to the glans of the penis, allows a far greater degree of sensitivity in stimulation, is much better looking than a cut penis and, with due care, provides a greater degree of health and wellbeing.  Circumcision, on the other hand, is a mutilation of a perfectly normal part of the body.  It provides no useful purpose.|`|lJXH22nQaa	i had foreskin until i was 12 when I was circumcised, so i know the feeling both of being uncut and cut.      I'd say I like being circumcised better.

AA10887916	In the current UK courts, the tolerance for injury claims that have not resulted in any actual loss of earning is quite low at the moment - a soft tissue injury, with no permanent marking or damage is unlikely to net you very much at all - a grand maximum....|`|AA12279950	You will receive 42.|`|f89f116400d4ff9b53b246c33e1753cdaa	You might not get anything - so don't count your chickens.

WNsjy5oFaa	if you are in the uk you are unlikely to get an xray - this is because if it is a cracked rib that is suspected they will advise and treat you accordingly, an xray will not change the management or care given and they will not want to expose you to unnecessary xrays.    best treatment for ribs is good analgesia - if you haven't seen a doc yet do so and get decent analgesia, you'll need to do breathing exercises and look after yourself, pillows might help and leaning forward onto pillows might help.    google breathing exercises and hopefully you'll find something, but regular analgesia is best and nothing too strenuous    also  if you did this at work you should see occupational health|`|QfTEYT3zaa	These do sound like the symptoms of a cracked rib - pain breathing/laughing and moving etc. The only way to heal a cracked rib is to rest - you can't put a cast on it! Sleeping slightly sitting up (propped up with pillows) sometimes helps.     The only thing you can really do is to make sure you take it easy (so if it is broken you don't make it worse) and take medication for the pain. An X-ray might be a good idea because if it's not broken it could be a muscle problem, and you'll need to see a physiotherapist.|`|AA12279950	You just described the symptoms of a cracked rib.  Or it could just be bruising, or a torn muscle, only an x-ray can tell.  However, there's nothing they can do anyway, you'll just have to rest up and take it easy.|`|fd747af047fac4ce6b0786a13d942ae6aa	Sounds like you should be out of work on workmans comp.

Tu9S1WaNaa	take a benedryl to be sure.  It could be a reaction.  Most allergic reactions involve a rash, itching, (hives), and don't last over 2-3 hours.    Milk allergy is like most food allergy reactions: It usually happens within minutes to hours after eating foods that contain milk proteins. Most reactions last less than a day and may affect any of three body systems:    the skin - in the form of red, bumpy rashes (hives), eczema, or redness and swelling around the mouth   the gastrointestinal tract - in the form of belly cramps, diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting   the respiratory tract - symptoms can range from a runny nose, itchy, watery eyes, and sneezing to the triggering of asthma with coughing and wheezing     People often confuse milk allergy with lactose intolerance because people can have the same kinds of things happening to them (like stomach pains or bloating, for example) with both conditions. But the conditions are not related. Milk allergy is a problem involving the immune system, but lactose intolerance involves the digestive system. For someone who is lactose intolerant, the digestive system doesn't produce enough of the enzyme needed to break down the sugar in milk.    The common symptoms of lactose intolerance are gastrointestinal, primarily, abdominal pain, diarrhea , flatulence (passing gas), and, less commonly, abdominal bloating, abdominal distention, and nausea. Unfortunately, these symptoms can be caused by other gastrointestinal conditions or diseases, so the presence of these symptoms is not very good at predicting whether a person has lactase deficiency or lactose intolerance.    Be very careful about your swollen throat.  If it is an allergic reaction, that is dangerous.  Call your Doctor to see what they think.|`|2esGKO2Caa	Maybe lay off the milk for a while and see. If diary products are bothering you, you could be lactose intolerant. Or you could just be getting the crud only time will tell. Hope you get better.|`|8ab6993234808864c73a8260c98e510aaa	I thought allergic reactions were supposed to come on more suddenly than the next day... your symptoms seem cold/flu-ish    maybe you're lactose intolerant? or you are getting sick?|`|SbLeCOjZaa	You may be lactose intolerant.. try taking something for that (lactaid)|`|eWObKmBSaa	If those reactions happened within 24 hours after you drank milk and you have had milk reactions before, wouldn't you say, that it could be the milk?  Maybe you are lactate intollerant?  That isn't a bad thing, just watch your milk intake.  Take care of yourself, it is doing bad things inside of your body too.|`|TkCIUNxdaa	If you are getting this when you drink milk, it could be you are lactose intolerant.  I highly doubt you are having an allergic reaction, as you would get a rash and have trouble breathing.  Stay away from milk as your body has trouble processing it..... If you are not lactose intolerant, then you are simply getting sick, or the milk was bad (What was the expiration date?)  Good luck, and I hope you feel better!|`|NXwzuv3Paa	well it could be either. you may need to get checked out. just to be on th safe side. if you feel "puffed out" in your throat then your airway could close and restrict your breathing.|`|e39272e07ec1522a4e1519839947554eaa	Sounds like it! If your throat is puffing out and you are having the same reaction you do to milk, then I wouldn't drink chocolate milk. I would call some one to either come over, or let them know you think you are having one, just so you are not alone and aren't in danger if you need help. I would go to ER if it gets any worse|`|jaGU3zyyaa	You might be lactose intolerant.  You should probably avoid dairy products or take Lactaid tablets so that doesn't happen|`|5IYTMkl4aa	You might be allergic to some nutrient in the chocolate milk if your throat get burned. But just be sure! think of the last time you had a chocolate milk? Did you go allergic with that too?   I think you are just getting sick.|`|ElSx2Mu6aa	could be either one but if milk usually bothers you then it is probability allergies|`|P5M76mwzaa	it's hard to tell are you allergic to any other milk products go to a doctor you may be lactose intolurant sp
UEOldaPZaa	A temporary crown is glued in with a temporary cement (sort of glue).  The temporary crown can usually easily be removed by wiggling it off with an instrument.  The dentist has asked you not to floss the tooth because the temp crown could come off.  The permanent crown is cemented permanantly (permanant glue).  You should be able to floss the tooth normally with the permanant crown.  The dentist may have to adjust the crown to the correct bite by shaping/shaving a little on the outside.    Thornhill Dentist  http://www.bcdentalcare.ca|`|JviPuS3Haa	there is only so much adjustment a dentist can make, but he'll use a hand-piece "the drill", to do make the adjustments, he'll have you bite down on a piece of articulating paper, to make sure there are no "high-spots", he'll floss between the crown and the adjacent, to make sure the contacts between the teeth are good. He should take an x-ray before he cements the crown with permanent cement, because there is only the eye can see, hope this helped.|`|oGyL9WJ1aa	The temporary crown is not really adjusted or molded to fit your teeth perfectly. It is basically there to hold the spot for your permanent crown and keep what's under there safe. Your dentist will shave or file the tooth down if it doesn't fit you perfectly. The temporary crown isn't put on your existing tooth structure with the same cement/glue the permanent one will be put on with. He will use the bite paper to make sure your teeth (top or bottom) are hitting naturally.

Touching your body for pleasure will never do you any harm. Forcing your body to run through the entire sexual cycle too often can be devastating!     Most men do not have any idea how much is required from the body to have an orgasm with ejaculation.     For a man over 30, twice a week is generally OK. Over 50 probably once a week. 60 maybe twice a month. Over 70, maybe once a month. Some teenagers (whose hormones are raging in overdrive) do it 2 or 3 times a day and are fine.     There is no real rule. That's just a general guideline from ancient healing arts and modern scientific observation. They both give the same numbers.     If you are experiencing some or all of the symptoms listed above, you are probably overdoing it. Try not ejaculating so frequently and notice how you feel. Keep cutting back until your feel good.|`|A5W8LQzVaa	No. But, if you do it such that you no longer have time for other productive activities it will eventually affect your entire life.|`|8UHWm3j4aa	no its not|`|nJs0UBDraa	People people, the spell checker is a friend not a foe!!!|`|Eku8XD2Gaa	it is not at all harmful, it is normal and natural for males  read on the link it will help you answer your curiosities  http://www.socyberty.com/Sexuality/25-My...|`|EZKe92TTaa	Manstrubtion sounds dangerous but masturbation is perfectly normal and not harmful|`|TPXlAxe2aa	if you masturbate your hands will fall off,you'll go blind & then your brain will come out through your nose|`|A1iDPPOeaa	Yes.

Nevertheless, I'm just citing the studies.    Excessive masturbation can stimulate acetylcholine/parasympathetic nervous functions. This immoderate amount of stimulation can result in an over-production of sex hormones and neurotransmitters like acetylcholine, dopamine and serotonin, causing a considerable change in body chemistry.    The side effects of these changes in body chemistry can manifest themselves as:      Fatigue    Hair loss    Memory loss    Blurred vision    Groin/testicular pain

AA11593971	I've often heard soldiers say that being brave is doing what needs to be done even though you are scared out of your mind. I guess they ought to know... so my advice would be to say what needs to be said even though you're scared.|`|InGWARz9aa	Its as simple as having confidence in yourself lol xxx|`|ParFJxnSaa	Learn to identify, and confront your fears: a fear confronted is a fear reduced, but a fear avoided is a fear strengthened. Some people turn their fear into anger: they become angry at themselves, for being afraid, and turn that anger on whatever the cause of it was perceived to be. I don't regard this method as being psychologically healthy. A selection of methods by which you can help yourself, follow: Firstly, I suggest that you take a course in self defence, Tae Kwon do, Kung Fu, and/or Karate, to teach yourself how to deal with physical fear. Read: "Feel the fear, and do it anyway". Your library, bookstore, or amazon.com may be able to supply a copy. It is important to deal with a negative internal monologue (self talk), or mental process, such as disturbing thoughts, or images, or even an emotion, by the process of (a): recognising it, and (b): challenging it immediately. When you notice something negative, such as: "I'm never going to get over this!" or: "Why am I always so pathetic/useless/such a scaredy cat?" or even: "I can't handle this fear!", or a disturbing image, recognise that this is part of your negative mindset, from the deep, primitive, animalistic recesses of your brain, which needs to be balanced by the use of higher mental functions.      Having identified and labelled it, visualise a large red "STOP!" sign, and/or possibly a stern faced person wagging an index finger at you in a negative manner, then say to yourself as forcefully as you can, even aloud in a big voice, if alone: "I know this tactic: GO AWAY FOR A WHILE !!!" You may want to use either: "ruse", "ploy", "game", or "trick", instead of "tactic". In the case of an image, visualise a large "STOP" sign, or your preferred version. Some people go so far as to keep a wide rubber band in their pocket, then put it around their wrist, when they catch themselves backsliding, stretch and release it, as a method of reprogramming their mind sooner, but I don't regard it as being strictly necessary. Remember to remove it, afterwards, if you use this method. "Just for today, I'll not be afraid of anything. If my mind is clouded with nameless fears*, I'll track them down and expose their unreality. I'll remind myself that only I am responsible for, and in sole charge of my life.      What happened yesterday need not trouble me today. Do I accept the fact that it's in my power to make today a good one just by the way I think about it and what I do about it?" Practice one of the relaxation methods in sections 2, 11, 2c, or 2i, daily, and when needed, at http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris  A variant of Eye Movement Desensitisation & Reprocessing therapy, which has been used successfully for those people suffering from anxiety: it is easily learned, quick to use, yet can be very effective, is on page N, of section 6, and I use it before the relaxation techniques, because I have found that it makes them quicker to employ, and more effective. Visualise, as vividly as you possibly can, that your fears, your self-recriminations, all the agonizing "I'm-so-Stupids," and "I'm too fats"; every painful "I-can't-I-have-it" or "I-can't-do-it"are huge raging, hurtful bulls snorting and charging at you. You see them coming at you and you hold out your red matador's cape at arms length and simply let them charge right by. Every time they come at you, hold out your arm with the red cape and let them rage and snort and go right on past.      We hate what we fear. This makes perfect sense because this mechanism, fear, was the only thing we had in our primordial stage of development to allow us to survive a hostile environment. In a way, it has been a necessary, a primal-instinct personal army. Before the development of the upper brain systems, the operation was pretty simple: We fear, we strike or run. But once our upper brain systems developed, the operation became a lot more complicated. Now it is not always practical, legal, moral or ethical to go the simple route, such as road rage. In a complicated system, little things can go wrong. When our fear can't end up in some action for our benefit, and we do not know how to help it dissipate, it hangs in our body and makes us depressed and hostile. If we are really angry, it might help to remember this exercise which is simply an intellectual understanding: Great anger is great fear. We need to save ourselves from our fear more than we need to save ourselves from any enemy. One way we can save ourselves from our fear is simply to feel it.

It is in my opinion the best way to conquer your fears and raise your self esteem.    The more you conquer your fears the weaker they become and the higher your self esteem will be.    Very soon you will not even need anxiety reducing subscances because your subconscious will learn that there is nothing to be afraid from speaking your mind.Speaking from personal experience.      Cocoa rich chocolate.Cocoa contains natural substances that reduce stress and pain and create a feeling of pleasure in your brain and increase your brain activity.How long effects last depends on how much you consume.Only a few pieces of high cocoa chocolate reduces your pain,anxiety or stress for most if not all day.Lindt exellence is my recomendation.The best chocolate you can buy and affordable to most people.You can find it in any store with large selection of items.The applications of cocoa are very wide ranging from consuming it before a dentist appointment to reduce pain and fear from the drill.It is very effective.    http://www.washingtontimes.com/weblogs/t...

Find what makes you happy. Find what your beliefs are, what you thinks right and what's wrong. Find out what you like and dislike. You're an idividual, you're special, there's no one, never has been and never will be, like you. Don't follow the crowd.  This may take a while but take it day by day. Try new things. Do something that scares you everyday. Build up your esteem by setting attainable goals and working towards them.  When you have confidence in yourself, be bold and speak out. Other people will probably wish they had the confidence to do so too.  Find a role model, someone who speaks out for their beliefs. Look at Nelson Mandella. He's a human, like you or me, but he spoke out and look how much he's changed the world.  Good luck :)

hqlx5KDFaa	i'm not going to attack you over your eating habits just suggest that what you are doing is really not healthy. you may have stopped losing because your body wants to hang on to the fat because the body thinks there is a famine. atkins is good for losing weight and feeling good!  take care x|`|J9pIrpkBaa	The reason you are not losing weight is because you are not eating enough food so your body goes into starvation mode and stores everything as fat. Also your metabolism will have slowed right down for the same reason. You need to eat at least 1200 calories a day for effective weight loss. Believe me you will lose more weight and keep it off if you have 1200 calories a day.|`|8f8b918d1198f1e196976002004cf9eeaa	Have you seen a dr. for that, it is a true medical condition, maybe they can help.

Try a more varied exercise routine.    Try eating more watery foods. Eat salad without dressing, or a lot of cheese, or croutons. (Other than that, most things that go on a salad are healthy.)     Make sure you are getting enough fiber.    If you like mushrooms and celery, eat these a lot, because they accelerate weight loss. Uncooked mushrooms are best.     Grilled chicken, and salmon are both more healthy meats than beef. Beef can be high in caloric value on account of fat and protein. Protein can be converted to fat if you eat too much of it, and don't get enough activity.    Use a bit of olive oil in your foods, esp. salad. It controls the impulse to eat fatty foods, and is very heart healthy.     Drink tea, unsweetened teas only though. If you can take it, drink lemon water. A bit of lemon added to the water you drink is supposed to help lose weight.    Good luck!|`|rSMl6IbCaa	If you are only eating 400 calories a day, your body is most likely going into starvation mode...your metabolism is slowing down.  You need to eat more to get your metabolism back to normal.  I would like to add that at 5'5" and 134lbs, you are at a healthy weight.  I don't know what your goal is, but I am hoping it is not an unhealthy weight.  I will not judge your eating habits, we all have our own issues, but by your question, you have already admitted that you are aware there is something different about the way you eat.  I would suggest, for your health, that you talk to a doctor about your eating habits, but also about what a healthy weight would be for you and about a healthy way to lose weight.  You need to make choices that are good for your body.  Also, I saw no mention of vitamins.  At 400 calories a day, you are most certainly missing out on some key nutrients...again something to talk about with your doctor.

(it will keep for quite a while in the fridge... Im not sure how long because my kids love it and it never lasts long enough for me to test shelf life - but you've got to keep it in the fridge)    Also, try putting vicks vapo rub on your feet and then a pair of wool socks.      The antioxidants in ginger, garlic, and onions will help your immune system fight a flu faster than anything else... I usually eat 2 cloves of garlic and half an onion (dipped in ranch dressing) at the first signs of a cold coming on.  Its a little harsh - but it's only really bad for the people that have to talk to you lol    I hope you are feeling better real soon! My baby has a cold right now, and all winter it seems that the cold/flu has been passed back and forth between my kids, so I can sympathize with you totally.  Be well.|`|CCfMrf8Vaa	With the flu, you usually will need to let it run its course and you will usually sleep. Try medications that will help the symptoms (like TheraFlu). The actual flu is there for a while, but you can try to treat some of the symptoms.

AA11593971	When I was helping my Mom make that decision, we asked some of the home health agencies/visiting nurses in her area what other seniors were using and how they compared in cost and emergency responsiveness. They gave us some real good advice based on their own experience and observations of their patients. I'd suggest you try that approach because it's not just the technology that is important but how your local medical facilities respond and support it.

The key ingredient is not medication, lifestyle changes, or relaxation exercises. It is when the individual no longer fears the thought of having a panic attack. <br>  <br>  This may seem like a simplified and obvious observation but give it careful consideration. The one thing that has you searching for a solution to anxiety and panic attacks this very moment is the fear of having another one.<br>  <br>  The first time a person experiences a panic attack it can feel like their world is falling down around them. Nowhere feels safe as the anxiety becomes like a stalker lurking in the background. <br>  <br>  When this happens people begin to either avoid situations that make them anxious or they medicate themselves to the point where they are numb to the fear. I am sure you will agree neither of the above is a satisfactory solution."<br>  <br>  Extracted from: www.panic-away.tk|`|ec76af399c519dad926a10430304f541aa	panic is controlled the same way regardless of underlying disease states.<br>  One must realize that the panic is caused by a release in the brain of adrenaline.  Adrenaline can only last fifteen minutes tops in the body.  Knowing this, if one can breathe deeply and just relax for that fifteen minutes the panic attack will pass and no further attacks will follow.  If one becomes fearful, then the brain continues to release adrenaline and the attacks become cyclical.  So, the key is to relax and not be fearful.
zVWhcbI6aa	Yea, they are yucky. This sounds really disgusting, but it works for me. I hate having tonsil stones so I get a q-tip and get it wet and try to pry it out. It's hard not to gag, but having a tonsil stone can make you want to gag the entire day anyways. If you can't see it, look in the mirror so, your tonsils are well lit. Hold out your tongue and cough. This encourages the stone to appear. You could get your tonsils removed, but they aren't too hard to live with as long as you get them out as soon as you know they're there.

AA10723498	Of course it is.  If neither partner has the herpes virus, you have no worries. You can only get it if one or the other partner has it and have sex during an outbreak.  That's when it's dangerous to have unprotected sex, when the person who has it, has an outbreak because the lesions will leak and give you the virus.  Other than that, I don't think you have to worry if you are having unprotected sex for over 2 yrs with the same woman and never got herpes.  FYI, unless you want a baby, use protection anyway.  Just a thought.|`|satoCRC6aa	you can have it and no outward signs(bumps,blisters,rash)<br>  <br>  protection is best policy, <br>  <br>  no cure for herpes|`|5rJ6nf2oaa	Yes it is possible, especially if they are taking an anti-viral like Valtrex which suppresses the virus. <br>  <br>  Otherwise, there are many people who just don't have any symptoms for long periods of time (years) and don't appear to be shedding virus and so have not been in an infectious cycle. <br>  <br>  It's a bit unwise to continue with unprotected sex though unless this person is taking an anti-viral.|`|uDOVf2vvaa	It is possible, but not likely.

However it proves very useful in treating blackheads, acne and pimples. <br>  <br>  P/s:Do try these remedies if you want.However,get a facial session for more better results.Good luck and hope I helped(:|`|wWzK6eJaaa	They have this tool at the drugstore that you can use on blackheads and whiteheads.

4PvCb2oOaa	What a loving thing to ask for this man. Unfortunately,(or I guess fortunately if you ask my husband) I am a woman. I was in an automobile accident when I was 20 years old sustaining a closed head injury. I was in a coma for 13 days and then in post traumatic amnesia for 3 weeks. Relearned how to breathe, talk, get dressed, tie my shoes, etc. If you would like to e-mail me I can try to answer as many questions as I can, being of the female species. For now I will say that my husband, who I met 2 years after the accident, is incredibly patient and loving, and is my advocate in life. It is very hard for a person with a head injury to make other people understand what they need. He goes with me to doctor appointments, social security appointments, and any other place where I might not get adequate representation on my own. I feel very vulnerable to the outside world and I can only imagine that this would be extremely difficult for a man to be able to accept and would probably have a lot of resentment. Like I said, e-mail me with questions, between me and my husband we should be able to get you some kind of answer. By the way, we have now been married for just over 13 years and have raised his 2 kids fromk a previous marriage and are working on raising our 2, who are 8 and 12.|`|satoCRC6aa	Every Day Is a New Day<br>  You can never understand or heal a brain injury<br>  You have to have patience.<br>  They are frustrated and angry<br>  they are mean and mad<br>  they want to be as they were befor and cannot understand why their brain will not work like it used to.<br>  They have temper tantrums, uncontrollable feelings of depression<br>  every emotion they have is aggravated to new heights<br>  98 % get divorced due to the emotional changes and behaviors<br>  they are changed in more ways that one can believe<br>  you love them but, they don't even knoe who you are<br>  I still love my x-wife after our divorce in 2000 <br>  I stayed together through many difficult years,<br>  I knew I had to set her free so, she could find herself and be happy<br>  Today , she has lost everything and struggles to get through the day<br>  I still speak to her but, she is different , only cares of herself|`|cu8fUJbMaa	Head injury survivors may experience a range of neuro-psychological problems following a traumatic brain injury. Depending on the part of the brain affected and the severity of the injury, the result on any one individual can vary greatly. Personality changes, memory and judgement deficits, lack of impulse control, and poor concentration are all common. Behavioral changes can be stressful for families and caregivers who must learn to adapt their communication techniques, established relationships, and expectations of what the impaired person can or cannot do.<br>  <br>  In some cases extended cognitive and behavioral rehabilitation in a residential or outpatient setting will be necessary to regain certain skills. A neuropsychologist also may be helpful in assessing cognitive deficits. However, over the long term both the survivor and any involved family members will need to explore what combination of strategies work best to improve the functional and behavioral skills of the impaired individual.<br>  <br>  ven a person who makes a “good” recovery may go through some personality changes. Family members must be careful to avoid always comparing the impaired person with the way he/she “used to be.” Personality changes are often an exaggeration of the person's pre-injury personality in which personality traits become intensified. Some changes can be quite striking. It may be, for example, the head injury survivor used to be easy going, energetic, and thoughtful and now seems easily angered, self-absorbed, and unable to show enthusiasm for anything. Nonetheless, try not to criticize or make fun of the impaired person’s deficits. This is sure to make the person feel frustrated, angry, or embarrassed.<br>  <br>  Head injury survivors may experience short-term problems and/or amnesia related to certain periods of time. Generally, new learning presents the greatest challenge to memory or remembering. In contrast, pre-injury knowledge is more easily retained.<br>  <br>  The ability to focus and concentrate are keys to addressing some short-term memory problems.<br>  <br>  Keep distractions (e.g., music, noise) to a minimum and focus on one task at a time.<br>  <br>  Have the individual repeat the name of a person or object, after you, if memory impairment is severe.<br>  <br>  Whenever possible, have the person write down key information (e.g., appointments, phone messages, list of chores).<br>  <br>  Keep to routines. Keep household objects in the same place. Use the same route to walk to the mail box or bus stop.<br>  <br>  If getting lost is a problem, you can label doors or color code doors inside the house or hang arrows to indicate directions. When going out, the person should be accompanied initially to ensure the route is understood. A simple map can be sketched from the bus stop to the house. And make sure that the person always carries his/her address and emergency phone numbers.<br>  <br>  After a head injury a person may lack emotional responses such as smiling, laughing, crying, anger, or enthusiasm or their responses may be inappropriate. This may be especially present during the earlier stages of recovery.<br>  <br>  Recognize that this is part of the injury. Try not to take it personally if the person does not show an appropriate response.<br>  <br>  Encourage the person to recognize your smile at a humorous situation (or tears if you are sad) and to take note of the proper response.<br>  <br>  In some cases, neurological damage after a head injury may cause emotional volatility (intense mood swings or extreme reactions to everyday situations). Such overreactions could be sudden tears, angry outbursts, or laughter. It is important to understand that the person has lost some degree of control over emotional responses. The key to handling lability is recognizing that the behavior is unintentional. Caregivers should model calm behavior and try not to provoke further stress by being overly critical. Help the person recognize when his/her emotional responses are under control and support/reinforce techniques that work.<br>  <br>  Provided a situation does not present a physical threat, various approaches may be used to diffuse hostile behavior:<br>  <br>  Remain as calm as you can; ignore the behavior.<br>  <br>  Try to change the person’s mood by agreeing with the person (if appropriate) and thus avoiding an argument. Show extra affection and support to address underlying frustrations.<br>  <br>  Validate the emotion by identifying the feelings and letting the person know these feelings are legitimate. Frustration over the loss of functional and/or cognitive abilities can reasonably provoke anger.<br>  <br>  Do not challenge or confront the person. Rather, negotiate (e.g., if you don’t like what’s planned for dinner tonight, how about choosing Friday’s menu?).<br>  <br>  Offer alternative ways to express anger (e.g., a punching bag, a gripe list).<br>  <br>  Try to understand the source of the anger. Is there a way to address the person’s need/frustration? (e.g., make a phone call, choose an alternative activity).<br>  <br>  Help the person regain a sense of control by|`|brSfRLspaa	rubber hose? what do you mean "deal with him"?
baWh7kYoaa	What are your goals?<br>  <br>  Separating carbohydrates (starches) from protein sounds like an Atkins Diet - where the body is fueling itself on fat and protein to burn off bodyfat.  There will be plenty of people saying it is bad for you; will hurt your kidneys; will cause health problems.  They have no idea what they are talking about - they're "research" is based on studies conducted on people with pre-existing conditions that were exacerbated by the diet.<br>  <br>  Anyways back to your question - it is best to eat your foods in two combinations: protein with fat & protein with carbodydrates.  With carbohydrates post exercise and earlier in the day to fuel your body and brain.  With fat later in the day to avoid storing excess calories as bodyfat.
ba57fb92aa421eaa3a4ae7f0f80f397caa	You are definitely experiencing an elevated level of anxiety, which might be considered a panic attack.  The feelings you are  experiencing are a normal physical reaction when someone is experiencing anxiety.  There is nothing physically wrong with you - it looks like your thought process is making you react to your thoughts as if they were an actual threat.  When something worries or scares you, your body releases adrenalin, and adrenalin causes your pulse and breathing rate to increase, and it usually makes a person feel shaky, nauseous and a little light-headed from hyperventilation.|`|F8tQkDPcaa	Here's some good information for you to know (extracted from this site): www.panic-away.tk<br>  <br>  <br>  "This Is The Key To Being Panic Attack Free...<br>  <br>  You Must Learn To Break The Fear Of Having Another Panic Attack Or You Will Never Experience Complete Freedom From Anxiety <br>  <br>  <br>  -The anticipation of a panic attack starts the wave cycle of anxiety in motion. <br>  <br>  -The foundation of a future panic attack is laid hours before you actually experience one.<br>  <br>  -The slightest stress trigger will then launch the full blown panic attack into motion. <br>  <br>  -Panic manifests itself in approximately 20 minute wave like formations. <br>  <br>  <br>  This Is Where Your Problem Lies <br>  <br>  There is one key factor that makes the difference between those who fully eliminate panic attacks from their lives and those who do not. The key ingredient is not medication, lifestyle changes, or relaxation exercises. It is when the individual no longer fears the thought of having a panic attack. <br>  <br>  This may seem like a simplified and obvious observation but give it careful consideration. The one thing that has you searching for a solution to anxiety and panic attacks this very moment is the fear of having another one.<br>  <br>  The first time a person experiences a panic attack it can feel like their world is falling down around them. Nowhere feels safe as the anxiety becomes like a stalker lurking in the background. <br>  <br>  When this happens people begin to either avoid situations that make them anxious or they medicate themselves to the point where they are numb to the fear.

You have to challenge your body to lose weight. Get out out of a pattern. Use weights (squats, push-ups, crunches), something that makes you uncomfortable to do. Alternate walking at your normal speed on the treadmill with a minute or 2 of running. This will help to jar your metabolism.|`|69MJDg55aa	Hey!  I used to weigh 198 lbs and my height is only 5'8" - for my height and with that kind of weight I'm really obese!

The main thing is to stick in there.  You can't be an addict to food and never exercise if you want to live a healthy life and keep the weight off.  I've worked out, done every diet, and all types of classes.  <br>  <br>  Nothing works,  besides dedication and intelligence towards the subject of losing weight.  <br>  <br>  First,  depending on how much weight you need to lose,  your diet is the first concern.  You can't eat 10,000 calories a day and expect the weight to come off,  even if you are exercising a lot.  Which brings us to the next thing.  Duh,  Exercising...<br>  <br>  This is a must especially if you need to a lot of weight.  Get at least 30 mins of some good hardcore exercising.  Do some cardio,  in the long run,  it's good for the heart.<br>  <br>  However,  I find the most hardest part of losing weight/keeping it off,  in my diet.  It's so hard to keep your fingers out of the cookie jar or those chocolate goodies.  I've found a great addition to help any one out,  it's a natural weight loss supplement called Proactol.  Now don't get all crazy on me and say diet pills don't work.  That is true,  but not in this case.  This one isn't meant to burn pounds while you sit on the couch.  It's an appetite suppressant,  along with being a fat binder.  I saved money on the pills at <a href="http://starturl.com/efblc" rel="nofollow">http://starturl.com/efblc</a> along with getting some good info.  It basically makes those fingers not go towards the cookie jar.  For me it's the best pill I've tried and I've tried cupboards full.  Now this doesn't mean you have to follow my foot steps but I've successfully lost roughly 70 pounds and keeping it off til this day.  <br>  <br>  Well good luck and remember what I said,  Dedicate.
qnD5RfbPaa	If you have a sinus problem, then you should be aware of this, since it would affect your respiration.  Anti-biotic destroys not only bad bacteria, but also good ones along with important nutrients needed for proper body functions.  It follows then that if you are taking anti-biotic, you should also be taking a complete multivitamin supplements as well as eating yogurt.  Frequent use of ani-biotic result in ineffectiveness after a while.<br>  <br>  It is also important that you eat lots of fresh raw vegetables of a very wide variety as well as fresh raw fruits of a very wide variety.  These raw foods consist of enzymes and vitamins that are very important for healing.  Calcium is also important for the health of your gum.  Hence it is very important that you drink cows milk - that is very rich in calcium.  Including cabbage, asparagus, avocado, cantaloupe, bananas, papaya, broccoli and all green leafy vegetables in your diet is very important.<br>  <br>  I am not sure if this will work, but there is no harm in trying it.  Eat a great deal of fresh raw pineapple over a couple of days.  If you're having sensitive teeth problem when eating it, have it blended (do not strain, neither should you add sugar.) and drink.  Sensitive teeth reaction could mean that the protective tissues of your teeth has been compromised as a result of low collagen production.<br>  This will happen if you are not consuming or absorbing enough foods rich in vitamins A, C and calcium.<br>  <br>  You might find the information in the following links useful.  <a href="http://www.nutritionalwellness.com/archives/2006/jul/07_proteolytic.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.nutritionalwellness.com/archi...</a><br>  <a href="http://askdrellie.blogspot.com/2009/01/pineapple-facinating-fruit-and-good-for.html" rel="nofollow">http://askdrellie.blogspot.com/2009/01/p...</a>|`|nzY94B7waa	When my daughter was 2 she bumped her front tooth in the tub.

sMuMfuAgaa	I really don't think it's necessary for you to lose weight.  At your height 110lbs is actually underweight.  And it'd take longer for you to lose weight because you are already light enough.

dJuEtGxraa	Here are a few tips;<br>  <br>  WHEN to eat for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? Eat (at least) three times a day. <br>  Because when you eat only once a day, your metabolism gets slower than it already is! That's the main reason. Sounds funny, but to lose weight... you must eat (the right things, of course) <br>  ? Eat low-fat, high-fiber foods such as salads and vegetable pastas.<br>  ? Your last meal should be before 18:00. Try. <br>  OK, one apple after 18:00 <br>  ? Don't starve <br>  Starvation is not good for losing weight, nor your health. <br>  Starvation is the worse thing you can do in a weight loss diet. <br>  ? Try oatmeal instead of cornflakes for breakfast--eating oatmeal can help reduce cholesterol levels, and its high fiber content will keep you full longer.<br>  <br>  WHAT to drink for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? Drink 6-8 glasses of water every day ! <br>  Can be tap, plain, mineral, sparkling. I just love mineral sparkling water! <br>  This improves your bowel, reduces the "hunger" sensation, and hydrates your skin. Your skin will look much better after the first weeks! <br>  Don't believe the slogan "water makes me fat". Beside being stupid... you might get into serious troubles with your kidneys. <br>  ? Drink ONLY natural juices, freshly squeezed! <br>  Don't drink Coca Cola, Pepsi, Spite etc. during the diet. Even lite or light versions. <br>  <br>  <br>  Exercise for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? If you want quicker results - exercise would be good. <br>  ? Don't just sit in front of the TV and eat peanuts... <br>  I guarantee THIS won't work for your weight loss... <br>  ? Start a regular exercise program and stick with it. Don't be afraid of those sweat suits and Lycra pants! <br>  ? Start swimming. Swimming is an excellent exercise to get involved with, since it increases blood flow and uses muscles we don't regularly use. Start a swimming program and try to do it 3 times a week. You will feel excellent and rejuvenated.<br>  ? Choose an exercise program that you enjoy, and don't shun the unconventional. For instance, did you know that regular vigorous dancing is exercise too?<br>  ? Also Cardiovascular exercises such as running, jogging, or aerobics will help you lose that unwanted belly fat. Weight training can also help you lose body fat because the more muscle mass you have, the more ability your system has to burn body fat.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  Hope this helps~|`|o1rzGR8kaa	I tell guard his mother wears combat boots, no food 2 weeks|`|YKbiJADQaa	LOL I love these questions. O.k, you should work-out in the mornings. Cardio 45 mins, weights, 45 Min's. eat six meals a day. Try to keep them at a carbohydrate LOW. Don't exceed more than 60-80 Grams of it a day. Your body takes that in and will turn into fat, and then you have to work-out EVEN HARDER! Mix up your meals everyday, don't eat the same chicken and beans for dinner everyday. Have that on <br>  <br>  Monday:<br>  <br>  Breakfast: 1 egg white, 1 piece of whole grain toast with peanut butter.<br>  <br>  Snack: Protein shake or yogurt with granola.

Something that occurs when the blood leaves a man's brain and goes to his cock. an erect blood filled penis. brought on my sexual arousion. the average male gets 3 a night while your sleeping. also known as erection, stiffy, chubby, hard on<br>  A ***** is a slang word that means you have an erect penis.<br>  *****' is a slang word for an erection. Erections usually happen when a guy is sexually aroused or excited, though they can also happen while he is asleep, in class, or just watching TV.<br>  <br>  An erection is the stiffening and rising (see Erection Angle) of the penis, which occurs during sexual arousal, though it can also happen in non-sexual situations. The primary physiological mechanism that brings about erection is the autonomic dilation of arteries supplying blood to the penis, which allows more blood to fill the three spongy erectile tissue chambers in the penis, causing it to lengthen and stiffen. The now-engorged erectile tissue presses against and constricts the veins that carry blood away from the penis. More blood enters than leaves the penis until an equilibrium is reached where an equal volume of blood flows into the dilated arteries and out of the constricted veins; a constant erectile size is achieved at this equilibrium.<br>  <br>  Erection facilitates sexual intercourse though it is not essential for various other sexual activities.|`|Nq4FWEIcaa	An erection.

Methotrexate and Prednisolone both have side effects which may cause some weakening to your muscles.  Methotrexate can sometimes cause anemia and Prednisolone can cause water retention which can result in weight gain.  A vigorous exercise program with help alleviate some of the adverse side effects of those drugs.

Eat (at least) three times a day. <br>  Because when you eat only once a day, your metabolism gets slower than it already is! That's the main reason. Sounds funny, but to lose weight... you must eat (the right things, of course) <br>  ? Eat low-fat, high-fiber foods such as salads and vegetable pastas.<br>  ? Your last meal should be before 18:00. Try. <br>  OK, one apple after 18:00 <br>  ? Don't starve <br>  Starvation is not good for losing weight, nor your health. <br>  Starvation is the worse thing you can do in a weight loss diet. <br>  ? Try oatmeal instead of cornflakes for breakfast--eating oatmeal can help reduce cholesterol levels, and its high fiber content will keep you full longer.<br>  <br>  WHAT to drink for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? Drink 6-8 glasses of water every day ! <br>  Can be tap, plain, mineral, sparkling. I just love mineral sparkling water! <br>  This improves your bowel, reduces the "hunger" sensation, and hydrates your skin. Your skin will look much better after the first weeks! <br>  Don't believe the slogan "water makes me fat". Beside being stupid... you might get into serious troubles with your kidneys. <br>  ? Drink ONLY natural juices, freshly squeezed! <br>  Don't drink Coca Cola, Pepsi, Spite etc. during the diet. Even lite or light versions. <br>  <br>  <br>  Exercise for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? If you want quicker results - exercise would be good. <br>  ? Don't just sit in front of the TV and eat peanuts... <br>  I guarantee THIS won't work for your weight loss... <br>  ? Start a regular exercise program and stick with it. Don't be afraid of those sweat suits and Lycra pants! <br>  ? Start swimming. Swimming is an excellent exercise to get involved with, since it increases blood flow and uses muscles we don't regularly use. Start a swimming program and try to do it 3 times a week. You will feel excellent and rejuvenated.<br>  ? Choose an exercise program that you enjoy, and don't shun the unconventional. For instance, did you know that regular vigorous dancing is exercise too?<br>  ? Also Cardiovascular exercises such as running, jogging, or aerobics will help you lose that unwanted belly fat. Weight training can also help you lose body fat because the more muscle mass you have, the more ability your system has to burn body fat.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  Hope this helps~|`|wxzeKh4Iaa	Try the Fat X workout and diet program.

EvloJtMeaa	My dad always gets the flu shot and winds up with the flu...and in turn gives us ALL the flu. I hate that damn shot.|`|gSo4dR7oaa	Flu shots only cover a few strains of flu that are expected to be the most common/most serious. Since there are so many strains of flu,   it is possible that someone who has had a flu shot could get a strain of flu not covered by the shot.|`|2bf0afb576f3b1843272a3d582d8496eaa	Very often the flu virus mutates into another form and the current flu shots can be ineffective.  I never get the shots anymore and just bolster my system to try and protect myself - and usually don't get a flu but every three/four years or so.  It seems if you're going to get it you will.  Yes, every flu season there is always a strain of flu that the shots do not protect against.  <br>  <br>  Edit: <br>  The vaccine does not protect you completely - you MAY not get it, or you COULD get a milder version which is what it sounds like you got.  The people I know who got the shot, also got the flu.<br>  <br>  The flu vaccine protects against the three main flu strains that research indicates will cause the most illness during the flu season. This year’s influenza vaccine contains three new influenza virus strains.<br>  <br>  They are: <br>  A/Brisbane/59/2007(H1N1)-like virus; <br>  A/Brisbane/10/2007 (H3N2)-like virus; <br>  B/Florida/4/2006-like virus. <br>  The 2008-09 influenza vaccine can protect you from getting sick from these three viruses, or it can make your illness milder if you get a related but different influenza virus strain.
fecUjSr1aa	Porno is just one of the fears of parents. Keep in mind that parents only want to protect you. One day you'll fly the coup and you're on your own. That is kinda hard for parents to take when one of their own, flies to seek its own path. Its called LOVE.<br>  <br>  Secondly, the internet, just like a dark alley, also looms with bad people, predators and scammers. And believe me, a lot of people have been victimized, identity stolen, kidnapped or whatever "bad" things you can think of. In case you didn't know, we already have what we call "cybercrimes" and these are committed via the internet.<br>  <br>  So, the next time your parents tell you, please refrain from or don't do this ... think ... that's LOVE they're trying to tell you. Its LOVE why they're trying to protect you. It may not seem much, but different people have different ways of showing it.<br>  <br>  In the end, its still LOVE ........... hope this helps you out|`|MoQNZFqoaa	Yeah...I started watching it when i was 13...i still do..watever but i do it when they go to bed...lol.im 14 too!|`|SlxeK1p6aa	I think they are just being protective <br>  <br>  and it is illegal to watch porn under the age of 18 or even 21 in some states<br>  <br>  that's probably why parents are so overprotective of porn<br>  <br>  and yes I have watched it from time to time and did start watching it quite early<br>  but im not obsessed and wouldnt advise anyone to either

It's quite complicated, because there are different types of schizophrenia, all with varying symptoms. But, listen, there's lots of hope, because 28% of schizophrenics never get a relapse after one psychotic episode. Everyone can recover from these episodes. (I get them myself - but not permanently). Also, don't let the words spook you out. People get very scared of words like 'schizophrenic' and 'psychotic' but they are not as terrifying as they sound. The main thing is, if you can live with it for a while and not let it freak you out and you can still function in society without harming yourself or others then you should be fine.|`|8aa5f85b4dd536239b8ade249d0de719aa	Yawn.<br>  Too long to read.

It doesn't matter which exercise you do. <br>  <br>  Most people go to the elliptical when they're injured from running too hard or too much and is less likely to cause injury.<br>  <br>  Train in Zone 2...(Of 4 or 5) or 60-70% of your max heart rate. That gets you into the 80/20 or 50/50 fat burn/sugar burn ratio.

d11ac1603c7e53d874cecaa7631b2aa0aa	I have an allergy to nuts and have been admitted to the E.R. for simply being around them. How dare you think it's all an act? How dare you say it's a con? Trust me, I would love to go into a new place and eat a handful of nuts, but I can't. I can tell you that no one wants these damn allergies. <br>  <br>  When I am around them , and when others are around them, a process called Anaphalaxsis occurs. Throats swell shut. People go into comas. People DIE.<br>  <br>  It's people like YOU that make our lives miserable, and scary. You could kill somebody...can you live with that?|`|TGFc2Z6Caa	Allergies are very real.|`|688a7b812dded24c0867e947aee9d86aaa	I am outraged and offended.  <br>  <br>  You are an uneducated idiot if you think it's a con.  I suppose my son thought it would be fun to fake his projectile vomiting and choking when he ate dairy and egg.  He was just so smart as an infant that he knew the ingretients in his teething cookies and his baby food.<br>  <br>  Do some actual research and try to understand what is happening inside the body when the food allergen is introduced.<br>  <br>  It is people like you who MURDER innocent children by giving them the very food that they are allergic to because you don't think it's real.<br>  <br>  I can not even begin to express how much I hate you right now for making that comment.|`|KDHmaaQyaa	Because we eat so much processed food and ingest so many chemicals, our bodies are having more and more difficulty differentiating between serious threats and things that aren't actually bad for us. This causes an allergy to something that is seemingly harmless. Trust me. As someone who was recently diagnosed with an anaphylactic tree nut allergy...these aren't made up. Try eating something and feeling your throat close up within seconds of swallowing and then tell me the allergy is a con.|`|ewDKMeJkaa	well if come into contact with peanuts i could die, if i eat one i will die<br>  <br>  believe me its very real<br>  <br>  im the same as drumbum, i have anaphylaxis and its no way a con, its extremely annoying and limits what we can eat, even if i did want attention wouldnt put myself through that to get it|`|AA10447831	they may seem over-reactive but wouldn't you be if eating a certain food caused your windpipe to swell so you can't breathe?|`|uDOVf2vvaa	No, I know it's not a con. I know some people may use it as an excuse or for attention but there was a girl in my sorority that was allergic to nuts. She asked everyone not to use any nuts or peanut butter, but one of the girls used a knife to spread peanut butter then she washed it off and put it in the dishwasher and ran it. The next morning she used the knife while eating breakfast and within 5 min. she could not breathe. We had to call the ambulance and she almost didn't make it. I never really thought food allergies was a big deal until I saw my friend almost die of it.|`|HUQQzph2aa	Food allergies are on a rise but in no way is it a con. Do not be so naive, people with peanut allergies (for example) can have a deadly attached if they walk into a bakery that is cooking peanut-butter cookies.|`|jLLkSWyiaa	omg no! i have serve allergies to many things! (im allergic to over 30 things!) and break out in hives from them and my throat swells up from certain things! it wasnt unheard of thirty years ago! many pples had all the same allergies just no cures for them! i used to be allergic to eggs, chocolate, milk (aka dairy products) and peanuts .. but thankfully i out grew them ...|`|CZwFNUoOaa	i wouldn't call it a con but a lot of people say they have an allergy when they actually have an intolerance's many people don't understand the differences|`|KQpT68AKaa	You ought to have someone close to you that has had this problem since birth. Today's news is a revelation to parents of children with this awful condition.You would not be so stupidly ignorant then!|`|12VQ4ETcaa	No.  My friend clinically died from eating shrimp for the first time when she was 13.  Luckily she was revived.  She'd never had fish before and didn't know there was such a thing as food allergies.|`|AA11538461	The gene pool is breaking down.  There are lots of other problems besides allergies that were unheard of 30 years ago.|`|fNgv2FeRaa	Ask a doctor this when they are dealing with anofalactic shock patients...you can't fake that!<br>  <br>  Dimwhit!|`|Um75aRZFaa	People who are severely allergic to one particular food is actually a real problem. I seriously doubt its some con to boost the sales of Epi pens. People who have allergies to everything under the sun however, in my experience have an underlying psychological problem.<br>  <br>  During the middle ages, the vast majority of the European population were allergic to cows milk. I doubt there was some milk con during that time. It is just a particular genetic disposition presenting recently in our time for particular foods such as peanuts. Back then those who were able to drink cows milk had stronger bones and healther/longer lives. Which in turn meant they could pass on their genes and let the trend continue. When diseases struck the population, good old survival of the fittest kicked in. By the end of the middle ages the allergy had dropped to a very low level.|`|c9a33ded6139d91d15c7b135a9b4da6caa	No its not a con it is true - my daughter developed an egg allergy during her first pregnancy 10 years ago and it could kill her - she is slightly allergic to the white of the egg but very allergic to the yolk- we have searched it out on internet and it stems right back to the budgie she got 10 years ago that caused the allergy - she has to carry her epi pen with her at all times because when she takes an attack her lips swell and throat closes over and she starts choking and it could kill her - her first child grew out of the allergy he was born with but her second child now 2 years old cannot eat anything with eggs in it as she could also be a carrier of the allergy, so before you think its a con get your facts right first.|`|sDwN4XuIaa	Unfortunately food alergies are very real!  I am alergive to apple juice, and Banana's.  It could be the things we do to grow them these days that have altered them.  TIme has changed how we grow out fruit and take care of our foods.  Milk could be as simple as drugs that are fed to the cows or have traveled down the line of cows from mother cow to baby cow.  There are so many things that could affect why we have grown allergies to certain things.  Me I know my throat swells, I get hives, I itch, and I get nausea when I get aroudn these things.  I dont even know it is there, my fiance kissed me after having eaten banana chips only 10 minutes before.  I didnt know I could taste them but I got severaly ill that was why.|`|cgQqHJtKaa	I know what you mean. I don't believe everyone who says they are allergic actually is. It isn't a con, but a mistake. That is not to say some food allergies are not very real. <br>  <br>  No one is saying they don't exist, just that it is exaggerated.|`|7BGyTzjeaa	They are very real. It's possible that 30 years ago doctors were unable to identify allergies for what they were.|`|Lecy4pOYaa	lmao a con?? you cant be serious.. It's pretty hard to fake any side affect of an allergy attack, being rashes/hives, swelling or worse.|`|93ix6nyvaa	It's definitely not a big con when you see hives and rashes coming on their faces as soon as they touch it...

Your optometrist should have advised you at the time whether he recommended a new Rx and its benefits to you.  I would suggest that you return ask him/her and to show you the difference in the vision of your left eye before the change and after. This is not an unreasonable request and should not be refused.|`|F89MNQheaa	Yes , sorry to say it but if you are wearing the wrong perscription then you can damage your eyes. Try recylcing your frame, you dont have to get new glasses everytime you know aslong as frame in good condition. Also you dont have to buy your glasses from your opticians, ask for a copy of your perscription, legally they have to give you a copy and you can then shop around for the best deal.|`|RgwJ1PNnaa	Your prescription has decreased so if you don't think it is currently too strong then I'd leave it. But your prescription has definately got weaker which is good!|`|1lewFV8oaa	Your right eye did not change much at all, but your left had a significant change where the prescription went down.  If you are not experiencing any problems such as a headaches or eyestrain, then you probably do not need to update the prescription.|`|XkWd08Uvaa	your cylinder power  has lot of difference  it is not possible to think it is a small chang---it is better to have a change at the earliest|`|GDXk3AGTaa	It should be changed.<br>  <br>  Get a new left lens.|`|BdafX7Staa	it looks like it is the left eye that'sis getting worse , yes that can be a problem later on. remeber that all problems start out small!
9OyIL8P9aa	If you have been checked out and all the test came back that things are fine, I would not worry about it .<br>  If this was not common your doctor would have said something about it to you. <br>  Just wait and see what a few more weeks will bring, and if it the same, then make another appointment to get looked at and demand some other test, to see what could  be causing this  to happen to you. <br>  But on the other hand, this could be what you did not have the first year that you were on the implant..<br>  Hope everything works out for you!
6LwBMVODaa	Going for the Green Tea extract is a great idea! Is a natural supplement and has great health benefits. Your diet might be 99% of the problem. Unless you know your basil metabolic rate you may not have an accurate number of how many calories, grams off fat, carbohydrates, & protein you should be consuming a day- and how often. Your BMR is the number of calories you "burn" a day if you did NO activity!

NUUH0pBraa	Cervical cancer is also very treatable depending on the stage it is caught.  I guess it would be helpful to know exactly what the PAP results were.  Usually if one were having these types of symptoms and they were related to cervical cancer then your pap would come back saying more then just "abnormal cells".<br>  <br>  Did it say anything about the following:<br>  <br>  Epithelial cell abnormality<br>  Squamous intraepithelial lesion<br>  Dysplasia<br>  <br>  According to my knowledge these things would be listed on your pap if you have cervical cancer or even if you were beginning to develop cervical cancer.  However, I know very little and I would assume there are things that could occur that would possibly make a pap not pick all of that up... it is just a screening tool.  <br>  <br>  Best wishes!|`|AA10988719	sounds like it could be chlamydia, or maybe HPV.  if your doctor didn't discuss this with you it is disturbing.  you can get cervical cancer at any age 23 especially if there is a history of it in your family.  I have 3 articles you should check out and maybe one or all of the combined will help put your mind at ease.  Seriously though -- your doctor needs to follow up with you regarding this.
UTA4G5rTaa	Definitely go back to your dentist!! It sounds like dry socket! <br>  It could also be an infection! If you notice bad breath, increased swelling, pus oozing from the extraction site. try the surgeon, let him know what is going on, the least he can do is just check the site, and see, it takes all of 5Min's! <br>  Your pain should be gradually receding!

I think you may have some kind of infection going on.  You should see your surgeon, as soon as possible!  If the surgeon can not see you immediately, go to your regular dentist.  If he can not see you immediately, go to your primary care doctor.  Oral infections can cause other health issues.  It is not normal for the pain to go away and then come back again.

I will say that I suffered for 2 weeks or more after my wisdom tooth removal, but the hole left was not stitched up and infection got in. Antibiotics is probably what you need. It's not normal for the pain to come and go, though. I would go back to the surgeon who did the surgery. He should be accountable.|`|Qct074kuaa	I suppose it depends on the person...I got all my wisdom and one molar out in one day...about 7 days later I was eating normally again...but if you are still in pain in a few days call your doctor to see if you can take some medicine to take the pain away.

PSojABqMaa	i know a lot of people do NOT want to hear about this and scrutinize me for this, but i lost about 10 pounds w/i 2 week by using the atkins diet. it was pretty awful however, but it was the most effective. all i did was drink water, eat hot dogs, salads, other un breaded meats, etc...food that had little or low carbs and atkins bars. i walked on my treadmill for an hour and did a bunch of sit ups. i lost like a pound a day. i've kept it off for years. im 115 pounds. i dont follow the diet anymore however...idk what happened, but now i eat A LOT like fast food, chips, potatoes, stuff that people label as bad. but i still maintain my weight. idk if my metabolism sped up when i went on a diet. i eat the same as when i weighed more, but i still maintain my weight. w/o doing ANYTHING. its weird idk why that happened...hope i helped. however i wouldn't recommend this, but it was such a rapid loss, thats why i am telling you. you see results w/i a day. your stomach is noticeably smaller. its pretty unhealthy tho...goodluck!|`|SpcYCBndaa	Simple formula:<br>  Eat less<br>  Do more<br>  <br>  ..............@@@~.............<br>  ................(o o)................      <br>  ==== ooO=(_)=Ooo=====<br>  <br>  Can I get ten points?<br>  Please<br>  Pretty Please<br>  Pretty Pretty Please<br>  Pretty Pretty Please with a cherry on the top<br>  You know you want to <br>  Go for it<br>  You can do it!<br>  -Thanks|`|dJuEtGxraa	Here are a few tips;<br>  <br>  WHEN to eat for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? Eat (at least) three times a day. <br>  Because when you eat only once a day, your metabolism gets slower than it already is! That's the main reason. Sounds funny, but to lose weight... you must eat (the right things, of course) <br>  ? Eat low-fat, high-fiber foods such as salads and vegetable pastas.<br>  ? Your last meal should be before 18:00. Try. <br>  OK, one apple after 18:00 <br>  ? Don't starve <br>  Starvation is not good for losing weight, nor your health. <br>  Starvation is the worse thing you can do in a weight loss diet. <br>  ? Try oatmeal instead of cornflakes for breakfast--eating oatmeal can help reduce cholesterol levels, and its high fiber content will keep you full longer.<br>  <br>  WHAT to drink for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? Drink 6-8 glasses of water every day ! <br>  Can be tap, plain, mineral, sparkling. I just love mineral sparkling water! <br>  This improves your bowel, reduces the "hunger" sensation, and hydrates your skin. Your skin will look much better after the first weeks! <br>  Don't believe the slogan "water makes me fat". Beside being stupid... you might get into serious troubles with your kidneys. <br>  ? Drink ONLY natural juices, freshly squeezed! <br>  Don't drink Coca Cola, Pepsi, Spite etc. during the diet. Even lite or light versions. <br>  <br>  <br>  Exercise for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? If you want quicker results - exercise would be good. <br>  ? Don't just sit in front of the TV and eat peanuts... <br>  I guarantee THIS won't work for your weight loss... <br>  ? Start a regular exercise program and stick with it. Don't be afraid of those sweat suits and Lycra pants! <br>  ? Start swimming. Swimming is an excellent exercise to get involved with, since it increases blood flow and uses muscles we don't regularly use. Start a swimming program and try to do it 3 times a week. You will feel excellent and rejuvenated.<br>  ? Choose an exercise program that you enjoy, and don't shun the unconventional. For instance, did you know that regular vigorous dancing is exercise too?<br>  ? Also Cardiovascular exercises such as running, jogging, or aerobics will help you lose that unwanted belly fat. Weight training can also help you lose body fat because the more muscle mass you have, the more ability your system has to burn body fat.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  Hope this helps~|`|HsDEPhdLaa	The pattern for losing those excess pounds is not difficult - eat less food and workout more often - the problems arise when we in reality try to put that into practice!

So don't lose hope because the middle didn't go yet. it's last on the list.|`|HlD9dRF2aa	...Fast-- without injury--after talking to your doctor.... alternate swimming, running and cycling, 5-6 days a week. Alternating workouts forces your body to burn calories faster. LOW INTENSITY EXERCISE....Your heart rate should not go above 70% of your maximum heart rate so that you will burn mostly fats instead of sugars.<br>  <br>  Do not increase distance/intensity/duration in any combination by more than 5-10% per week. You get stronger when your body is recovering so you should rest 1-2 days a week. Injury will be minimal and swimming helps sore muscles to recover faster. Reduce your caloric intake and more fruits and vegetables--junk food is a no-no. Easy cycling will burn the fat in the legs and calves. Swimming will burn fat and tone muscle. <br>  <br>  Look up the term glycemic index and try to eat foods that are high in complex carbs and complex sugars that are low on this index... e.g. instead of white potatoes eat sweet potatoes, whole grain bread instead of white bread. <br>  <br>  MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL: Make a schedule and stick to it. e.g. Monday Swim/run, Tues. Bike, Wed. Swim/run, Thurs. Bike, Fri. Swim/Bike, Sat. Show off 6-pack abs at pool. Sunday Show off 6-pack abs at pool.  Try to do at least 20-30min for each workout.<br>  <br>  Save your money and avoid supplements except for multivitamins. Your cost effective recovery drink is chocolate milk. (Milk is where whey protein supplements come from anyway).  <br>  <br>  It also helps motivate you if you sign up for a race or some kind of sports event. See you at the finish line.<br>  <br>  P.S.

Do not do this unless you never want to see that weight again.|`|eS9nPWqBaa	Man I wish that was me...lol|`|sMuMfuAgaa	You can't lose weight from a certain area, your weight is lost all together.  Obviously what you've been doing (Excersise wise) has been reducing the size of your stomach.  What you need to do is add in a form of excersise that also works your hips, thighs, and butt.  Maybe start biking and working your muscles especially in those areas.  There are websites that give great excersises for that.|`|pMmOXlZ6aa	Work out ur lower body with less weight and more repetitions, and rest less in between.|`|Z8d9ipxmaa	Fat storage places are controlled by hormones, which you can't alter. Some peoples' bodies burn more fat from one area than another, and  find it difficult to loose fat from certain places, then are unhealthy when their naturally smaller areas become too thin. For some (generally those with a bigger bone structure) it's almost impossible to shed a certain amount of weight, especially lower body fat. Lower body fat is stubborn, the body hangs on to it. <br>  But lower body fat and a narrow waist has many benefits, including low cholesterol and easier child birth. If you eat well and exercise, you're perfectly fine like you are now. <br>  <br>  There are guidelines of normal weights, but what's healthy for you depends on your metabolism, your frame, your body shape.

Your diet is 99% of the problem. Perhaps you've hit a plateau which happens when your body gets used to something (like a diet or exercise program). This is why you should switch up your exercise program, implement more cardio so that your 70-90minute work-outs are more efficient! The amount of time you spend working out isn't as important as what you do during that time.<br>  <br>  Back to your diet- How often are you eating? What is included in each meal? How many calories are you consuming compared to your BMR (Basil metabolic rate=amount of calories expended a day with NO activity level)? Do you know how much protein your individual body needs to build lean muscle? Lean muscle doesn't replace fat but helps your body in the process of burning fat as an energy source! <br>  <br>  Keep working at it- I suspect a little tweak in your exercises program and a few more diet changes will make a difference- Don't give up....it will take your body at least 2 weeks to adjust to a new regimen!|`|lXIrobyCaa	· Your diet should not exceed the daily amount of calorific intake, beyond what your body needs.<br>  · To ensure this, have a diet rich in fiber lean protein, and good carbohydrates. Fresh vegetables and fruits, lean meat, whole grain products, nuts and light fat will ensure that your calorific intake remains limited.<br>  · This will also supply your body with the essential nutrition and energy<br>  · Also cut down on fats, and sweetened beverages.<br>  · Detoxification is also useful as it will raise the rate at which your body metabolizes calories, and you can burn butt fat faster. eventually getting the perfect physique.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  · When your body is ready for more strenuous exercise, you can do the hip abductor, leg press or squats and remove fats from your butts<br>  · Remember that the hip muscle is the largest muscle in the body, so to convert fat into muscle mass, grab any opportunity to give this muscle a workout. Leave the elevator, take the stairs. Walk down to get your paper, or groceries or dance. Whatever you do, just make sure you are burning calories with that physical activity.<br>  <br>  Quick and Sustained weight loss is a combination of external and internal factors. The external factors of exercise and diet are of course helpful to lose weight. But you need to equally focus on internal factors of boosting your metabolism and keep yourself motivated to loose weight.

Google is there for everyone to use. He He. Especially the ones about the use of tampons and menstrual cycles. They can even research questions on this forum before posting questions.<br>  <br>  I am sad though because they are such young immature women that do need to be educated in some way though. On here they are more than likely strangers to each other and can be completely open about their personal issues, as where they may not feel secure enough to talk about it with friends and/or family. <br>  <br>  So what can we really do about it?

AA12218624	green tea is not a weight loss supplement. it is simply good for you because it contains antioxidants (it actually contains the most powerful antioxidant out there). so if you want to lose weight, you're going to have to do it with diet and exercise like everybody else.|`|BG8vMyZjaa	Forget it and all the other teas and pills.

The main thing is to stick in there.  You can't be an addict to food and never exercise if you want to live a healthy life and keep the weight off.  I've worked out, done every diet, and all types of classes.  <br>  <br>  Nothing works,  besides dedication and intelligence towards the subject of losing weight.  <br>  <br>  First,  depending on how much weight you need to lose,  your diet is the first concern.  You can't eat 10,000 calories a day and expect the weight to come off,  even if you are exercising a lot.  Which brings us to the next thing.  Duh,  Exercising...<br>  <br>  This is a must especially if you need to a lot of weight.  Get at least 30 mins of some good hardcore exercising.  Do some cardio,  in the long run,  it's good for the heart.<br>  <br>  However,  I find the most hardest part of losing weight/keeping it off,  in my diet.  It's so hard to keep your fingers out of the cookie jar or those chocolate goodies.  I've found a great addition to help any one out,  it's a natural weight loss supplement called Proactol.  Now don't get all crazy on me and say diet pills don't work.  That is true,  but not in this case.  This one isn't meant to burn pounds while you sit on the couch.  It's an appetite suppressant,  along with being a fat binder.  I saved money on the pills at theweightlossplace.com along with getting some good info.  It basically makes those fingers not go towards the cookie jar.  For me it's the best pill I've tried and I've tried cupboards full.  Now this doesn't mean you have to follow my foot steps but I've successfully lost roughly 70 pounds and keeping it off til this day.  <br>  <br>  Well good luck and remember what I said,  Dedicate.|`|qQCbP6pKaa	You dont need to drink it.

VJ2lMc0Laa	Size ain't everything,it's how you use it that really counts! :-P|`|9ZWbjcTzaa	In the advanced civilizations of ancient Asia the images of kings were often adorned with a huge penis. But glorifying a large penis size was not only done in Asia: All across the ancient world, from Asia to Rome and Africa, archaeologists report a preoccupation with the size of a man's penis as being a sign of his reputation as someone important. <br>  <br>  A city in Greece still sponsors a "Phallus festival" in which people parade in penis costumes to guarantee good fortune. This ceremony has been traced back thousands of years. It may be human nature to associate masculine power and ability with a large penis size. Even in prehistoric times, when men and women occupied caves, people revered the idea of finding ways to increase penis size. <br>  <br>  In 2005, archaeologists in Germany discovered a large sculpture of a penis near the entrance to a cave. The size of this penile artwork is 8 inches and has a respectable girth. This find is scientifically dated to 28,000 years ago. You can find out more about this at a great website <br>  <a href="http://www.penissizer.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.penissizer.com</a> that researches sexual health and has articles on the modern global penis enlargement trend. This 28,000 year old sculpture may in fact be the oldest existing sex toy. The artifact shows clear evidence of prehistoric human interest in penis size and human sexuality. <br>  <br>  More recently, in Egypt 3,000 years ago, medical texts describe a type of surgery to increase penis size. These experiments were done on slaves who did not have any choice in the matter. The idea was that if the man's penis size could be increased, so could his position in life: It was a way to gain admiration and status as well as guarantee a large family and social power.|`|TUfC4xMOaa	Very well noticed.

Ancient religions (especially polytheistic ones like Hinduism & Greek mythology) have gods with gigantic penises, & there have been cults devoted to the phallus.  Likewise, monotheistic religions such as Judaism mention promiscuous women desiring men with horse-sized endowment in the Tanakh.  Men in various countries have used penis gourds, stretching methods, & bee stings to increase the size of the penis for hundreds or even thousands of years.  <br>  <br>  Cultures & civilizations have associated penis size with male attractiveness, fertility, & general masculinity for centuries before porn.<br>  The difference is that certain things like penis size & erectile dysfunction that are now discussed openly were restricted from public discussion in the past.

dJuEtGxraa	Here are a few tips;<br>  <br>  WHEN to eat for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? Eat (at least) three times a day. <br>  Because when you eat only once a day, your metabolism gets slower than it already is! That's the main reason. Sounds funny, but to lose weight... you must eat (the right things, of course) <br>  ? Eat low-fat, high-fiber foods such as salads and vegetable pastas.<br>  ? Your last meal should be before 18:00. Try. <br>  OK, one apple after 18:00 <br>  ? Don't starve <br>  Starvation is not good for losing weight, nor your health. <br>  Starvation is the worse thing you can do in a weight loss diet. <br>  ? Try oatmeal instead of cornflakes for breakfast--eating oatmeal can help reduce cholesterol levels, and its high fiber content will keep you full longer.<br>  <br>  WHAT to drink for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? Drink 6-8 glasses of water every day ! <br>  Can be tap, plain, mineral, sparkling. I just love mineral sparkling water! <br>  This improves your bowel, reduces the "hunger" sensation, and hydrates your skin. Your skin will look much better after the first weeks! <br>  Don't believe the slogan "water makes me fat". Beside being stupid... you might get into serious troubles with your kidneys. <br>  ? Drink ONLY natural juices, freshly squeezed! <br>  Don't drink Coca Cola, Pepsi, Spite etc. during the diet. Even lite or light versions. <br>  <br>  <br>  Exercise for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? If you want quicker results - exercise would be good. <br>  ? Don't just sit in front of the TV and eat peanuts... <br>  I guarantee THIS won't work for your weight loss... <br>  ? Start a regular exercise program and stick with it. Don't be afraid of those sweat suits and Lycra pants! <br>  ? Start swimming. Swimming is an excellent exercise to get involved with, since it increases blood flow and uses muscles we don't regularly use. Start a swimming program and try to do it 3 times a week. You will feel excellent and rejuvenated.<br>  ? Choose an exercise program that you enjoy, and don't shun the unconventional. For instance, did you know that regular vigorous dancing is exercise too?<br>  ? Also Cardiovascular exercises such as running, jogging, or aerobics will help you lose that unwanted belly fat. Weight training can also help you lose body fat because the more muscle mass you have, the more ability your system has to burn body fat.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  <br>  Just lift a few weights daily and you will get muscles.<br>  Hope this helps~|`|dhDuhtxAaa	As a lifestyle coach I have had some experience with clients in this area. So I have given you a few tips below!<br>  <br>  Tip #1:<br>  <br>  Workout Monday through Friday, leaving you 2 days rest. It is absolutely crucial to give your muscles time to rest. Working out every day will not only slow down your muscle gain, but leave you with stretch marks and injuries.<br>  <br>  Tip #2:<br>  <br>  Take in your body weight in grams of protein every day. So if you weight 250 pounds, the you should be taking 250 grams of protein every day. Best sources if protein are lean meats. Try to avoid protein  drinks or maximising muscle supplements as they are usually formulated with loads of additives and harmful chemicals. <br>  <br>  Tip #3:<br>  <br>  Try training two muscle groups a day. This lets you focus on those two muscles and makes sure you work those muscles good enough to give them a weeks break. So may guys at the gym work almost every muscle every time their in the gym. This not only means their muscles are getting worked too often, but they aren't really getting worked on very hard. If your in the gym focused on your chest, biceps and triceps, when it's your legs day, how can you possibly hope your going to work any muscle group very well?<br>  <br>  Working out excessively while not caring for the skin can lead to tears which can lead to their appearance. First off, there are a number of creams which can be used to both avoid and treat them. These creams have ingredients which will penetrate the sites at which the skin has been damaged, and once they have reached the second layer of the skin they will begin to repair it<br>  <br>  Before making a purchase I would advise that you research them carefully to make sure they are truly effective.|`|wTFNhW1Laa	my fitness coach to do 1 hours of running cycling etc and to play five a side football just get and a team or go swimming i do both

ezI5HwRWaa	Sometimes when a child grows up in an abusive household, it can pass on to the child once they leave. So yeah, that could be a reason for his short temper, because that's what he was used to when he was younger.     It sounds like the both of you need to work on your communication. You should decide to sit and talk it out instead of leaving or getting furious. Talk with him about trying that. Say that you want to talk things out to fix them, and if he gets abusive or very tempered, that you will leave because you shouldn't be around that. You can't have a healthy relationship without good communication.

rdWeWvoYaa	Well I'm 19 and I'm on the same boat.  Al though I'm homosexual as opposed to asexual - I think relationships are anything but necessary.  Your sexual energy is better focused on a career and your desires/passions in this world.<br>  <br>  Low self-esteem alright - if its low its got to start somewhere before it can grow to great heights.  You'll find a lot of self-esteem in yourself once you know what you want in life.<br>  <br>  Your missing out on a life experience - that's as far as it goes.  You just opened up emotionally anonymously on the internet so congratulations your on your first step to being human.

It is not necessary that you be in a relationship all the time, just to stop from being lonely, or for the sake of "society", but at the moment you shouldn't cut yourself off from possible relationships, just cause you feel nobody would want you.  Yeah your self-esteem is low, and therefore you feel depressed and consider it not worth getting into a relationship cause you might loose out in the end.  That fear of being rejected or dumped is so prominent in you that you are looking for excuses not to have a relationship.  Part of life is getting hurt, and you can bury you head in the sand, and remain lonely, or you can take the chance and search for someone to care for.  Chances are you will find love or something close to it and have a relatively happy life, or go through life single and lonely at the end.  LIfe is not about getting into one relationship after another, but about living each moment without looking weeks, months or years ahead to what might to might not happen.|`|6sEjqtViaa	lol ewww wtf so you just play with urself all the time? jeez 21 years dont you feel lonely dude?<br>  <br>  Its very Important!!|`|JIjuNh9Maa	youre not missing out. <br>  love just hurts|`|9edc5077057569352822a821adc48204aa	I don't think people need to be in a one-on-one love relationship to be happy, BUT, I do think that if you do not have a sense of emotional connectedness with someone(s), either human or animal, you are missing out on one of the joys of being alive.<br>  <br>  So if you are not in a love relationship, I think you can benefit from a sense of connectedness to others by either service to others, or friendships, or mentoring, or spirituality practice, or some activities where you feel connectedness.  But a life in isolation from connectedness tends to lead to a sense of alienation that doesn't feel good, that can lead one to questioning why they are here.<br>  <br>  Is that feeling what prompted your question?

Knowing that partner inside and out, makes you feel at peace. <br>  Yes, you become vulnerable and put your trust in someone else, but knowing that you can do this, gives you hope for happiness and hope for humanity.|`|ngt2B4QOaa	Yes you are missing out big time it's just not about the sex it's about having someone to share the joys and sorrows in your life.

I have been dealing with depression for 9 years and it isn't something that just goes away. Try to talk to someone and please try to eat something light maybe a yogurt or some type of fruit. You may want to try to contact an agency where you can talk to someone about your depression.

8b605189bffd91d0497498eabf8d3d17aa	Bone marrow transplants have been used to treat patients with certain forms of cancer, such as leukemia, lymphoma, and breast cancer. The goal of such a transplant in women with breast cancer was to allow them to undergo high-dose chemotherapy -- which aggressively attacks the cancer cells, but also damages normal blood cells. Bone marrow transplant then replaces the damaged cells with healthy ones.    However, according to the National Breast Cancer Coalition, there is no scientific evidence to support the use of high-dose chemotherapy with bone marrow or stem cell transplant for the treatment of breast cancer. Results from studies on women with breast cancer have not shown this treatment to be more effective than standard therapy.|`|224d1d60d1b56362532d0d7f33ab994daa	Data on the efficacy of stem cell transplant for treatment of breast cancer was falsified by a South African doctor in the 90s.

Fortunately, she is cancer free after about 9 years. Seems it worked for her.    It is not routinely used in the treatment of breast cancer currently.|`|dbVQpbScaa	Bone marrow transplantation was used almost a decade before in quite a few trials with high dose chemotherapy, on the principle that if we take out the bone marrow and then give high dose chemotherapy it would kill the cancer and then we could transplant the bone marrow back in the body.  This was thought a way of killing cancer cells much more effectively, but it has failed till date and for solid tumors it is presently not a recommended procedure.

It doesn't matter.<br>  There is NO benefit to being circumcised or uncircumcised. <br>  Don't believe the lie that circumcised men can't feel as well because nerves are gone, wrong nerves. Also some say that they can't feel as well because there isn't a protective covering (the foreskin obviously) but that's also buffalo crap because that would be like saying you won't be able to feel as well with your index finger unless you wear a glove on it most of the time.

I was cut as a child and I hate it.  I wish I had been left intact, because there was no reason for me to be cut, the same as there is no reason to cut our sons.  Your wife is growing a perfect baby in her womb.  Why would you turn him over to the doctors to cut useful parts off him?<br>  You should view some of the videos on the internet, and read up on the function and reason for the foreskin.  It turns out that we have been duped by the medical profession all these years.  The stories they gave us are all myths.  <br>  My sons have never had any problems in that area.  With all the diapers I changed over the years, there was no indication of the urinary tract infections I was told would happen.  In fact, the circumcised penis is more exposed to feces and urine in the diaper and is more likely to develop problems.  The foreskin protects against this.<br>  Go to www.norm.org and read about why we have a foreskin and the benefits of having it, and keeping it.<br>  It really should be a decision left up to your infant son, when he becomes an adult.<br>  If you want to discuss this with a father that has been there and done that, please feel free to write to me.|`|q1YDp1y3aa	I would recommend NOT circumcising your son. The benefits do not outweigh the risks. One analysis found that for every 9 boys who might be spared a UTI by circumcision, another 12 boys at the least (the upper estimate was 40 boys) will experience severe complications from the circumcision. Thats great if your boy is one of the 9, but horrible if he's one of the 12. UTIs can be treated by antibiotics quite effectively. Botched circumcisions are much more difficult to fix. Its also worth noting that 99% of intact boys will never get an infection, compared to 99.9% of cut boys. That means you would have to cut 100 boys to save just one of them from infection. Thats 99 boys cut for no reason at all. Out of every 1000 boys who are cut, one will contract a UTI anyway.<br>  <br>  Only 50% of boys nationwide are circumcised. Girls of your son's generation will likely have an entirely different view of circumcision as girls from yours. Just because you think intact is "gross" and "unsanitary" does not mean the women of your son's generation will. after all, think of all the differences between you and your parents. Did you know that when your grandparents were young, circumcision was very uncommon?<br>  <br>  Next, it is VERY painful to an infant. Most doctors still don't use any anesthesia, those that do rarely offer adequate anesthesia because the only stuff that works is not safe enough to use in infants for such a "minor" procedure. Further, some of the pain meds offered to infants aren't even recommended for use on babies! Some doctors argue that it has been done "for thousands of years" without anesthetic- what they neglect to tell you is that a medical circumcision can take over 15 minutes to complete. A Jewish ritual circumcision, by contrast, takes under 60 seconds to complete (and the baby is given wine) Here is some info on the pain.....<br>  <a href="http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.circumcision.org/response.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.circumcision.org/response.htm</a><br>  <a href="http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/taddio2..." rel="nofollow">http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/taddio2...</a> (note in this one that even infants offered pain meds for the procedure showed signs of post traumatic stress!)<br>  <br>  You should also know that studies have shown that the most sensitive parts of the male anatomy of ON the foreskin- NOT the head of the penis. By cutting off the foreskin, you remove a mans most erogenous genital tissue. Here is a study about that.... (note that other studies found no difference, but they neglected to test the sensitivity of the foreskin- they only tested the glans penis of intact and cut men and didn't pay any attention to the foreskin at all) <a href="http://www.nocirc.org/touch-test/touchte..." rel="nofollow">http://www.nocirc.org/touch-test/touchte...</a><br>  <br>  You should know that infant boys are EASIER to care for when they are intact. The foreskin does not retract until late childhood or even puberty, so you do nothing special, just wipe the outside of his penis clean and leave it alone. Furthermore, to prevent painful and bleeding erections later in life, doctors are now commonly leaving more skin behind- in a cut boy this means you may have to push the left over skin back at every diaper change and clean beneath it to prevent it from adhering or infecting. The very thing that mother's think they avoid by circumcising! In short- Intact = wipe like a finger, NEVER retract Cut= vaseline, clean thoroughly, push back remaining skin to prevent adhesions etc (the last step perhaps for several months or years)<br>  <br>  Here is an excellent tutorial on the basics of intact care and circumcision....<br>  <a href="http://www.lactivistintactivist.com/?pag..." rel="nofollow">http://www.lactivistintactivist.com/?pag...</a><br>  <br>  Another factor in your decision is that circumcised boys experience a 12% increase in their risk of MRSA infection. MRSA is commonly picked up in hospitals (where circumcision is performed in non-sterile conditions) and has been known to kill adults. I wouldn't want to deal with it in an infant. 12% is a BIG risk, the risk of a boy "needing" a circ later in life is WELL below that- under 1%. <a href="http://www.nocirc.org/publish/12-Answers..." rel="nofollow">http://www.nocirc.org/publish/12-Answers...</a><br>  <br>  The so called "benefits" of circumcision are generally trumped up. A big one now is that it "prevents" AIDS. All the studies showing "benefits" like this have been poorly designed and inconclusive. Also, for every study that finds a "benefit" there are more studies that find no benefit. <a href="http://www.icgi.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.icgi.org/</a><br>  <br>  It is rather eye-opening to see how circumcision first became popular in the US to begin with.

The sense of feel that i have in my knob is really sharp, like jumpy to a lightest touch. When in where it where things are moist and slippery, it turns into such feel good that it's tough to explain. I feel it right into my lower abs, and into my lower insides.<br>  <br>  I know that I wouldn't have that than anymore if I got circumcised and it got rubbed and dried up.

I don't think it's right that parents force that on an infant. Circumcision is not medically necessary, it's a painful procedure, and even though they won't remember it when they are grown, what's the point of cutting off parts of their body without their permission. Having a foreskin is natural. We are all born with one so it's obviously supposed to be there. Being circumcised isn't any healthier as long as the guy washes himself down there and looks is subjective so really there are no benefits to being circumcised. Having a foreskin makes it a lot easier to masturbate and most guys that are not circumcised say they are happier that way.|`|dOpKsNYcaa	I am not circumcised and do not plan on having my sons circumcised unless there is a medical necessity for it (which is highly unlikely). I'm very happy that I was left intact and really can't imagine what it would be like without that part on my penis. I actually feel sorry for guys that were circumcised at birth because they never knew what they were missing and never got to make that choice for themselves..<br>  <br>  Circumcision is completely unnecessary. Pediatricians don't recommend it anymore and it's now known to be extremely painful and traumatic for a newborn. I have never had a problem because I was left intact. In fact most boys in the world are never circumcied (certainly not in Europe) so it's basically just an American thing. But really unless you are Jewish or Muslim and it's part of your religion, you're better off just leaving it alone. Every boy (actually every male mammal) is born with a foreskin so it definetely serves a specific purpose and is not just useless skin. <br>  <br>  The reasons people choose to circumcise boys are really just ridiculous to me. A lot of people do it because they think it's easier to take care of without the foreskin, when the reality is that it's the exact opposite. If you leave a boy uncircumcised, you don't have to do anything special at all to clean it, you just wipe it like you would a finger. For circumcised babies, there is all sorts of work involved in making sure you don't irritate the area and worry about infection. Not to mention the pain and recovery period. <br>  Contrary to popular myth being uncircumcised doesn't make you more susseptible to STD's or infections (if that was the case then the US would have less HIV infection than Europe, not more). And it's stupid to have a boys skin cut off to prevent urinary tract infections when girls get UTI's way more frenquently than boys. So there are really no reasons to have that part cut off. <br>  <br>  As an adult I think it is more beneficial to have a foreskin than not to have one. Lack of foreskin makes it harder to masturbate and circumcised penis is a lot less sensitive. So sexually, I think it's much better to be uncircumcised, and for that reason I will not have my son circumcised unless there is a medical necessity for it. <br>  <br>  The only realistic reason there is to get circumcised now is asthetics. People do it because they think it looks better. To be honest I don't think they look any better with all the skin cut off, but to each his own. But in any case, it should be a decision left up to the individual, not the parents. We don't cut girls parts to make them "look better" or to make it easier for them to clean their vagina, so why do people do it on boys? It makes no since. It's the boys penis after all, let him decide. I could always get circumcised if I wanted to, but a circumcised boy can't get back what was taken from him.<br>  <br>  Not to mention, have you ever actually seen what they do during a circumcision? It's horrible!<br>  <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8212662920114237112" rel="nofollow">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=...</a>|`|VMDljEFuaa	Yes.  Yes, but then I've known nothing else.<br>  <br>  It's something I'd really have to think about.<br>  <br>  Originally, I believe circumcision was the result of religious ritual.  From that fact alone, it ought to be suspect.<br>  <br>  In my opinion, and in retrospect, it would have been nice for me to have had the choice, rather than having it forced upon me by parents who may or may not have been objectively knowledgeable about the procedure and it's ramifications.<br>  <br>  The obvious downside to me having the choice is I would have been either a teen or a young adult.  The discomfort and pain of the procedure - assuming I decided to get cut - may have been a little more than I  might have been willing to bear.<br>  <br>  I guess the best thing you can do is what you've already begun.  Open a discourse, research, and use your own best judgment.<br>  <br>  Good luck, Amigo.|`|a454ee46524abf792eec0686abd82584aa	I hate being circumcised and would never do that to a child.<br>  Circumcision is the amputation of the foreskin, not extra skin but an integral part of the penis; measuring 15 square inches in an adult, over half the penile skin, including the most sensitive parts of the penis. The foreskin is packed with nerve endings, special anatomical features like the ridged band and has a unique elastic gliding action, allowing it to slide on itself and act like lube. This action is what most males use to masturbate with. Circumcised males use what skin they have left, except those who are cut so tightly that they have to use lube or just rub it dry. The intact male can stroke the entire length of his penis using his foreskin and also has the option to use lube too, if he wants to. During intercourse the foreskin acts like lube on entry and may act as a dam, preventing lubricating secretions escaping from the vagina. In one study women reported that sex with an intact partner was gentler and more satisfying since he doesn't have to thrust as hard to feel enough stimulation. Removing the foreskin turns the surface of the glans from an inner mucosal membrane to outside skin. Newly circumcised adults usually go through some weeks of intense discomfort as the glans is constantly exposed to rubbing on clothing, until it develops a thicker keratin layer and becomes less sensitive.<br>  Not one major medical organisation in the world recommends routine infant circumcision anymore. The US is the last western nation still doing this to about 50% of its newborn males but even there rates are falling and many insurance companies no longer cover it, because it is deemed a waste of money. Sadly they often still don't use anaesthetic either and when they do it’s risky and ineffective. It's child abuse, pure and simple.<br>  The penis forms as one organ and at birth the foreskin is usually fused to the glans like a fingernail to its finger. So there is no cavity for germs and dirt to collect in until it separates naturally later, at an average age of 10. Only the boy himself should retract it and then he can be taught to skin back and rinse with plain water regularly.<br>  Misguided attempts to retract too early, often by doctors and nurses, are the main cause of damage to boys’ foreskins and the real main reason for childhood circumcisions.<br>  To perform a neo-natal circumcision the circumciser has to rip the foreskin away from the glans with forceps. Then the foreskin is either cut away or clamped until it falls off. Both methods cause the baby extreme pain and his raw glans and wound sting every time he urinates. It's quite common for the raw edges of the cut foreskin to fuse to the raw glans during the healing process, forming skin bridges or tags. These complications and other more serious ones are often not found till puberty and do not show up in complication statistics. <br>  More serious complications, though not common are immediate. Some babies lose their penis to infection, bleed profusely (often because they are haemophiliac) or even die each year.  <br>  The claimed benefits of circumcision are a beat up (based on flawed studies) and don't really exist but medical authorities have worked out that the overall complication rate is higher than all the benefits claimed by the pro-cutting advocates. One by one the claims are disproved but the pro-cutting zealots come up with more and keep quoting the old ones despite the evidence against them. For example you have more chance of dying from a circumcision or losing your penis from infection than from penile cancer. The rate of penile cancer is higher in the largely-circumcised USA than in European countries where less than 1% of males are circumcised. The US Cancer Society does NOT recommend routine circumcision.<br>  A very recent study in New Zealand followed a cohort of boys through life from birth to age 32. About 40% were circumcised. The intact males had a slightly lower rate of sexually transmitted infections than the circumcised but there was no significant difference.<br>  Using surgery to mutilate the genitals instead of washing in a modern western society makes no sense. Normal intact male genitals are even easier to wash than female ones and the same substance, smegma collects in the genital folds of both sexes. A few intact males have problems with tight foreskin but this is only a tiny proportion of intact males. The condition can now be almost always treated with simple stretching exercises, sometimes in combination with a steroid cream that speeds up the process. Many doctors don’t know about this in the US.<br>  I am circumcised and hate it. I wish I'd been given the chance to choose for myself. Intact men can choose to get cut at any time in their life, though most have no desire to do so. Many men resent being circumcised.<br>  Your son will grow up with many intact friends and there is every chance he will resent this unnecessary cosmetic surgery.<br>  Geoff|`|cFigSdt0aa	I'm not a guy and I don't have a penis, but all evidents supports the theory that uncircumcised men have more sensitivity and pleasure than circumcised men. There were two studies done on this, one of which confirms that circumcision reduces sensitivity in the penis and another one that says that it doesn't. The problem with the second study (done by a woman) is that she was a pro circumcision advocate to begin with, and her study didn't even examine the sensitivity of the foreskin (which defeats the purpose of the study). Here are the two studies back to back. You can judge for yourself which one was more thourough and accurate. <br>  <br>  Circumcision does not result in loss of sensitivity.<br>  <a href="http://www.abcnews.go.com/Health/Sex/story?id=3436936&page=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.abcnews.go.com/Health/Sex/sto...</a><br>  <br>  Circumcision results in significant loss of sesitivity and sexual pleasure.<br>  <a href="http://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.org/pdf/sorrells_2007.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.o...</a><br>  <br>  Based on my experience with men of both variety, there is no doubt in my mind that uncircumcised men are way more sensitive down there.|`|QBUypAmAaa	I would never circumcise my son(s).<br>  It was done to me without my permission and I hate it.<br>  It's his penis it will be his choice.<br>  I want him to be able to experience the best out of life and have all the options and opportunities open to him, and it can start with having a natural intact penis.<br>  I will teach him to use a condom to practice safe sex and how to clean it so hygiene will not be a problem. <br>  <br>  A baby boy is born with the foreskin it's there for a reason, it rarely has a problem as opposed to circumcision which promotes so many complications that it's not worth it. All the STD myths and the 'it's cleaner' myths, and he should look like his father myths, and the he'll be made fun of in the locker room or by other boys myths are just that, myths, there's no proof to any of them. So I'll debunk all of them for you.<br>  It's not cleaner if you plan to be a good parent and teach your son proper hygiene.<br>  STDs are prevented by condoms, not whether a man is circumcised or not.<br>  'He should look like his father' is just stupid, I never cared for or looked at my dad's penis when I was growing up, so I didn't question why it was different from mine at all, like why it had hair, or anything else, and why should I have? Most boys don't care about their old man's penis anyway, because there's just no interest for them in it and they would find it awkward to do so.<br>  Ok and finally the locker room myth, boys in a locker room to be honest, do not care about what your son's penis looks like unless it is really massively huge. Otherwise they won't look, because they're too afraid to be caught looking and be called gay or something else. So they won't make fun of it even if it is intact/uncircumcised, because that makes it known that they were looking, and they don't want anyone to know if they were looking or not. Guys in a locker room for the most part, keep their eyes straight ahead and don't let them wander, then they get in and get out as fast as they can, it's how it goes. Once again they won't be looking at his penis, more often than not they'll be minding their own business trying to get in and out as fast as possible.<br>  <br>  Remember once it's done, it's done, once it's gone, it's gone. Even if a guy can 'restore' his foreskin (like I am doing, though I'd prefer to be kept natural and intact/uncirumcised) he cannot regain all that was lost from a circumcision. Which that accumulates to about 4/5 of his penis's skin, his most pleasurable zones for sex, over 20,000 nerve endings, and a nice piece of important skin which keeps his glans protected from dirt and foreign material, as well as keeps it moist and sensitive. So please leave it to your son to make the decision when he's 18, that way his penis is fully grown, he's used to how to deal with it and would know if he likes it that way or not, and can handle it on his own, unlike having him circumcised at birth where he'll never get to experience that. So I'll say this, if you want the best for your son, you want him to have the best in life and to experience all he can, then leave him intact, because he won't ever be able to experience all he can without his foreskin.<br>  <br>  So my best advice. look at all of my links. The first one is from a circumcised father's point of view on whether he should circumcise his son when he and his wife were expecting and ultimately why they did not choose to circumcise their son. Please read it, it'll help you make an informed decision, and in my opinion hopefully the right one.|`|nhLvrVx9aa	I am, I also never had a brother or a friend who wasn't cut.

You only need common sense to know that men with foreskin intact are more sensitive and experience more sexual pleasure. Cleaning is simple and automatic. All I have to do is grab the foreskin and pull it back. That is not high maintenence. I have never had an infection or other problem. The majority of men in the world are NOT circumcised. I am normal and I am in the majority. When I have sons they would not be circumcised and I advise you to do the same. Best wishes.|`|FaDGtJF7aa	I am not cut and one of the best places to be stimulated is the nerve ending on the tip of the foreskin. The only benefit from circumcision is that it's easier to clean, but the detrimental effect is that sex is a lot harder and less stimulating. I am glad I am not cut and I would be very angry with my parents as I was, luckily my dad is a hemophiliac and they didn't because they weren't sure if I was (luckily I'm not). The extra time cleaning is nothing compared to the greater feeling during sexual activity and not risking problems due to it (higher rate of ED with circumcised, smaller girth etc.). The way I see it if he wants to get circumcised he can when he is older, but don't mutilate his body and make the decision for him.<br>  <br>  Don't let the doctor pull back your baby's foreskin because it can cause phimosis. It gave me it and I have to use steroid cream to get it back to normal.|`|9kMJJ1giaa	WOW!  That is a tough question, my son is circumcised, when he was born, I thought doctors circumcised all boy babies.  I didn't want him to look different than other boys, and maybe get picked on.  So we did it.  After watching that video, any future sons might not be!  The baby seems to settle down quickly but there are a few very intense minutes!  I certainly could not have been there and watched that be done to my child!  I guess if it really helps with health and hygiene it is something that needs to be done.  In my opinion it looks more normal to be circumcised, but that is what I am used to I guess.  I would want all my sons to feel normal, so I would have to say, we would do it again, but I do not want to think about it!  OUCH!!|`|k4nKYlW7aa	I am circumcised, but I regret that the decision was not left up to me. I would much rather have been left intact. So I will not have my boys circumcised at birth. They will get to make that decision for themselves. I've considered foreskin restoration recently but haven't decided. BTW, it's only Americans that think that circumcision is cleaner, everyone else in the world is uncircumcised unless they are Jewish or Muslim and knows how to practice good hygiene.|`|rFUqIakAaa	I am uncut, never had any problems with hygiene, like my foreskin a lot and would never dream of cutting it off. I'm just thankful that my parents left me whole and at least gave me the option myself. Cutting of the skin on the penis seems really stupid to me (especially on a baby) but since I've always had it I guess it would. Only circumcised people think that having a foreskin is unclean (because they are usually ignorant). Trust me, if you had one chances are you wouldn't want to get rid of it!|`|9b0f31327145482e20214b2d41e83492aa	I am circumcised and wish I wasn't.

My male child certainly will not be.<br>  <br>  Its much better to leave it natural.|`|TsjqzanQaa	I was circumcised, and it ruined my sex life, and I found out about foreskin restoration, which has restored much of the diminished sensitivity that the damage from the mutilation caused, and also increased the intensity of orgams, as well.<br>  <br>  Circumcision is male genital mutilation, that always damages the penis and sexual sensitivity and ability.<br>  <br>  I would never mutilate an infant in any way, let alone in the most sensitive area of the male body.<br>  <br>  While the damage done to me was more than the usual amount, this mutilation always diminishes sexual sensitivity and frequently results in adverse effects and complications that the doctors don't disclose and in fact suppress, as they don't want to discourage anyone from perpetrating this on their infant sons.<br>  <br>  Doctors make money from circumcision, and they very frequently belong to the religions that try to perpetrate circumcision on all males; that's how it became so widespread in the US in the first place.<br>  <br>  In most of the rest of the world, people have better sense than to mutilate infants.   80% of the men in the world are intact, with foreskins, an essential part of the penis for a 100% complete sexual experience.<br>  <br>  Circumcision also increases the male's susceptibility to HIV and other infections.       The foreskin has Langerhans cells, which have antiviral and antibacterial properties.<br>  <br>  The US had a circumcision rate of about 80% during the height of the HIV epidemic, and also the highest HIV transmission rate; muchy more than in any of the other countries where circumcision is very rarely perpetrated on males.      Europe, Scandinavia, Asia and South America all have much lower HIV rates.<br>  <br>  In Pakistan, where almost all males are circumcised, the rate of HIV is 400% more than in India, where the majority of males are unmutilated and whole.<br>  <br>  If circumcision is so "hygienic" then why don't women have it done to themselves?       It would remove portions of the labia, such as the clitoral hood, which is analogous with the male foreskin, and would have the same "benefits."<br>  <br>  But female circumcision of minors is illegal, as it should be, as it's "genital mutilation."      Male circumcision is also mutilation.     Genital mutilation is genital mutilation, regardless of the sex of the victim.<br>  <br>  Circumcision is the worst hoax ever perpetrated on the male sex.<br>  <br>  A foreskin is not a birth defect; it is a birthright.<br>  <br>  ERIC|`|2ydF6OTAaa	I am circumsized and It doesnt bother me.

UZJ7wVc8aa	If you want to lose weight, you need to two things: eat less and exercise more. Weight gain happens when you create a calorie surplus (eat more than you burn). Your body takes the excess calories and converts them to fat which get stored around your stomach, arms and thighs. The longer you remain in a calorie surplus, the more weight you'll gain. To lose that weight, you need to do the opposite. You need to create a calorie deficit (start eating less than you burn).     Your first step is to figure out how many calories you burn on a daily basis. This calculator will help you out http://calorieneedscalculator.com The number you get from this tool is what your body burns on a daily basis. To lose weight, simply eat less. It sounds a lot easier than it is but making small changes helps you adjust to a new lifestyle. Don't think of this as a diet, think of it as a new life. Instead of eating foods high in sugars, white flour and saturated fat, go with fruits, vegetables, whole wheats, fish, lean meats, nuts and beans. In addition to eating less, you also need to exercise more. Start off at 1-2 times per week and work your way up to 3-5 times per week.    Don't make all of these changes at once or you won't be able to properly adjust to them. Generally, eating healthier foods will decrease your calorie intake. Compare a doughnut to an apple and you'll see that healthy foods are lower in calories. You can find some more information at the Beginner's Guide to Dieting - http://straightdiet.com|`|IodpgIk7aa	go on the special k diet...it says you're supposed to lose 6 pounds in 2 weeks so by 6 weeks you could lose 36 pounds if you wanted to. or just eat healthy and work out in those 6 weeks.|`|AN9PdKmgaa	eat high protein small amt carbs drink 8 glasses h20 daily and exercise 30 min a day|`|ev353FQMaa	Healthy Diet and about an hour of cardio 4-6 times a week|`|zuZKj3xXaa	Crash diet..

No Breads or sugar. Unless it is a natural sugar, like in fruits.  First few weeks, diet Mon to Friday, eat at least one good normal meal on the weekends. By weeks 3 or 4, continue the diet throughout the entire week. If you try it all at once you will shock your body. So work yourself into it. Once your stomach shrinks, not eating so much will be normal and easier.  And of course exercise. Jogging or aerobics.|`|JaiepxZ2aa	belimia

UZJ7wVc8aa	Everyone has a problem spot. It can be around the stomach, thighs, arms or chest. No matter where your trouble spot is, the solution is exactly the same. You need to eat less and exercise more. The reason why there's only one solution for all of these problems is because it's impossible to tell your body where to burn the excess fat from.    When you eat too many calories, your body stores the excess energy as fat in different areas around the body. To lose this fat, you need to create a calorie deficit (eat less than you burn) to force your body to start burning that fat for energy. There is absolutely no way to control where your body goes to find this extra fat.     The larger your calorie deficit (a bigger calorie deficit means a bigger difference between what you eat and what you burn) the faster your body will burn excess fat and the quicker your body fat percentage will start to decrease. You can increase your calorie deficit by cutting your daily intake and exercising more. Sit ups will do nothing to target the fat around your abs just like squats will do nothing to target the fat around your thighs. You can read more about fixing your trouble spots at the Guide to Reducing Body Fat - http://straighthealth.com/pages/guides/r...|`|BFLLJc7eaa	dont take piles or any of this food bs. just do core work outs, like yoga if your a girl. do sit ups in your house. if you school or town has a gym use a incline benching bench and do sit ups with weights at 10-45 pounds.|`|ETiZd4vPaa	Yes, they will help  But make sure to do them every day.  because if you stop suddenly then you will gain weight around that area much quicker!    if you do wish to stop, gradually get out of them.

I take imitrex, and also try relapax they help me. You are at a increase risk for a stroke due to the swelling of the brain that migranes cause.

Since then i have suffered from migrane, sometimes they are so severe that i have black dots in my vision, i feel sick and dizzy and nothing i take seems to relieve it. The only thing that i do is to drink water and go lie down in a dark room and just try to relax. That i know sounds easier than said but once you can find a comfortable position you eventually fall asleep. When you wake up, just slowly focus yours eyes before you try moving, then slowly sit yourself up and just rest for a while. This works for me most of the time.

I've had a few and thought I was having a stroke.|`|BUOodnNRaa	Feverfew capsules have been proven to reduce the incidence and severity of migraines.     Feverfew (Tanacetum parthenium) is a traditional medicinal herb which is found in many old gardens. Feverfew has been used effectively for reducing fever, for treating headaches, arthritis and digestive problems. By inhibiting the release of serotonin and prostaglandins, both of which are believed to aid the onset of migraines, feverfew limits the inflammation of blood vessels in the head.  This would, in theory, stop the blood vessel spasm which is believed to contribute to headaches. The active ingredients in feverfew include parthenolide and tanetin. Capsules or tablets of feverfew generally contain at least 205 mcg. parthenolide; however, it might take four to six weeks before they become effective, and feverfew is not a remedy for acute migraine attacks.     There are also a number of foods, such as chocolate, aged cheeses and alcohol [just to name a few] that can trigger migraines. You must find out which foods are triggering your headaches and avoid them.

2sycPf8Daa	Effects of heart disease?<br>  Any major crisis, injury, or major illness such as heart disease effects us emotionally as well as physically.The patient may experience emotional ups and downs. <br>  <br>  An old person affected by heart attack/ heart disease may experience decreased motivation and impaired ability to initiate an activity. These issues are a direct result of changes within the brain. With mild motivation problems, the person appears apathetic but carries out normal activities quite adequately, particularly familiar activities. In more severe cases, some people do little beyond simple self-care tasks, and to the observer may appear disinterested. This is not the case, but simply a side effect of heart attack/ heart disease. Gentle guidance, prompting, support, and encouragement will assist an old person affected by heart attack/ heart disease.<br>  <br>  Depression often occurs in old people who have had heart attack. They mourn the loss of their previous self. They may have many fears, uncertainties and altered feelings about themselves, as well as experience losses in social activity, ponder questions about future prospects, financial security, and returning to work. The person may see little purpose in living and express thoughts of death. <br>  <br>  In situations such as this, depression may become an obstacle to rehabilitation. They need reassurance, time, and understanding. People who talk of dying may be signaling for assistance, for someone to listen and share their problems. Depression is a highly unrecognized side effect of heart attack/ heart disease and it is necessary to persist until the condition is correctly diagnosed and treated. <br>  <br>  Each patient plays a crucial role in his own recovery! His successful return to a happy, normal lifestyle depends on his participation, emotionally and physically, in his treatment, as well as having the support and cooperation of his family. Heart disease is a family disease and it requires a commitment from all who are involved.<br>  <br>  Take care as always!|`|angW1Lkfaa	I have congestive heart failure.

56cd234c4ee3450e941577587239d038aa	You sound like you are on the right track but I would eat more for breakfast to make sure that your metabolism gets a good kick start in the morning. Stay away from breads as much as possible. I just went on this diet where I eat instant oatmeal for breakfast with raisins. My appitite is gone way down and I think my stomach is less full and shrinking because I don't feel like I have to fill it up as much anymore and I don't feel at all uncomfortable or hungry. Sometimes I mix it with fruit (frozen strawberrys, blueberrys etc and put it in the microwave for 3-4 minutes. This new diet has been amazing for me. As horrible as this sounds. I think the key is to clean out your system (raisins prunes etc). The average body has so much junk trapped inside and getting rid of it (I swear) has totally reduced my appitite (or it might be the oatmeal) but either way I have to actually remind myself to eat now, it's soooo super easy like never before.|`|S9LkZDQDaa	I would say eat more for breakfast, as it is the most important meal of the day! It'll boost your metabolism, therefore you'll burn more calories.  Also! Top tip from me ;) Take an "Omega 3" supplement with your breakfast! It'll help your body burn more fat when you workout :)  Hope I helped! xox|`|5b478a242969ee67691fa226064cfcd6aa	I'm not a nutritionist so I'm not going to make any suggestions, however, reading that, I would only warn that although you will probably lose weight, you will put it back on again as soon as you go back up to your normal food intake. Eating the above, your body will probably go into starvation mode.    Exercise and healthy eating is always better for you than crash dieting.|`|Qh2rc1DNaa	You should never eat less than 1200 calories.  Otherwise your body will go into a starvation mode and you will actually gain weight.  First, I would calculate your basal metabolic weight http://www.bmi-calculator.net/bmr-calcul...  That will tell you how many calories your body uses...just being alive.  Then you can calculate how many calories you need based on your activity level.  Those links are there too.  Then you should look to cut about 500 calories a day thru exercise or food.  That will lead to a weight loss of 1 lb a week (500 cal * 7 = 3500 cal)  Good luck...and be healthy|`|8ab6993234808864c73a8260c98e510aaa	this is NOT ENOUGH CALORIES... your body will go into starvation mode and as soon as you eat anything normal your body will store it as fat...|`|MoLQsZeXaa	you could cut some of the lunch down like the nut bar     then it would be possible|`|bed3c9511d819eabe6d4a233bf96d01caa	You need more calories than 905 per day for your brain to function properly.|`|FOsd9DP6aa	You need a bigger breakfast.

JN6LWA6Oaa	First of all dont think all negative alright man. So you are not allowed to lift anything over 15lbs on any muscle group or just your back? Whoever told you you wont get anywhere is retarded, I bet you will end up bigger than that person. You can work biceps, forearms, triceps, for sure deltoids too, can you bench?<br>  <br>  So you can lift more than 15 pounds on everything that isnt back right?<br>  <br>  Well, cant you gradually add like 2lbs to your 15lbs, eventually the 15s are going to feel like nothing dude and you are going to have to up the weight, how can 15lbs be a restriction once it feels like paperweight?<br>  <br>  So your restricted to 15lbs for life? All I can say is get the most out of the 10s, 12, then 15s. People say to get mass cheat, I disagree though. I say proper form is the key to mass, especially in your case cheating can be bad, like on the bi curls make sure you have good form cuz when you cheat on the bi curls you bend your back and that s not good. Lift smart so you get the most out of every weight and workout.  I still think that when 15 becomes too light you should add two pounds, just so the difference isnt felt as much and you don't strain but at the same time you are progressing in weight you know? Just add little by little. When I had braces I wasnt allowed to chew gum, but I still did lol<br>  <br>  Oh ok that's great then, all I'm saying is when 15 is way too light, add weight! Good luck dude and join this forum IT IS SICK! <a href="http://www.gymmonsters.com/forum/" rel="nofollow">http://www.gymmonsters.com/forum/</a>|`|FIqCOwt1aa	well obviously youll be able to build up some muscle, but yeah, you wont get anywhere near bodybuilding standards.|`|PZ9OSv9naa	In my opinion you can't go very far with a restriction.

REb6GeFCaa	First, I would not discuss your skin with anyone.  If anyone comments without being invited to, politely state that you don't enjoy discussing this issue.  If pressed, you could say that you are taking a variety of measures to heal your skin, and simply refuse to discuss it further.  Be firm on this point.  Do NOT answer any of their specific questions, ie..."Have you tried X?"  You can reply, "Thank you for your concern/efforts to help, and I appreciate your sympathy, however I'm not going to talk about this any further."    If you DO want to talk to a specific person about it, feel free to unleash and say what's really on your mind.  How many years you've struggled, what it feels like to have dozens of people offer you unsolicited advice about your skin...reminding you of the painful fact that your skin isn't what you want it to be...and how it can make you feel.  Ask the person how it would make them feel, and ask them to consider holding back on advice in the future.  Reminding people to be compassionate can often be the best defense.    While I haven't struggled with acne in the way you have, I have had other serious medical issues, some visible and some not, which also seem to bring out the worst butt-in-ski tendancies in members of the general public, as well as friends and family.  What I've shared with you here are some of my tactics which frequently work.  What absolutely doesn't work is engaging someone by actually answering their SPECIFIC questions.  I've had to retrain myself, by literally practicing in my head, to respond to uncomfortable questions/situations in different ways.  It's not easy, but it feels a whole lot better than leaving myself open to comments and advice from even the most well-meaning people.|`|cRPR4fR3aa	You just have to tell the that you have tried and been to several doctors and have tried everything n the market and still no results, so my dermatologist prescribed Retin-A and its the only ting that has Helped, and that you know how powerful and harmful it is but your condition needs. make yourself sound as smart as possible and use words hey wont understand and thy should leave u alone if not just ask/tell them to stop its your skin and you can do with it as you please. try the first one first but sometimes you just have 2 be rude. hope it helps.|`|OTxCCXa5aa	Actually, stress can add to acne problems and the jury is somewhat disagreed on the effects of diet but that doesn't mean its not a contributing factor. There are many different causes and so maybe you should try opening your mind a little and maybe taking the advice from these people even if you think they're wrong. I know it's frustrating and it's probably pissed you off that I've said this. I don't know what you've tried to help with your acne and I don't know how bad it is so I can't judge. I just think if you've suffered with it for so long that you should maybe know that it has different causes and triggers. Try telling these people that you understand they have a basic understanding of your problem, and thank them for the advice, but politely add that they should realise that everyone is different and what might be the cause of one persons acne problem is not the same for another and what might help one person might even make another person worse.  Failing that you could just ignore them and not allow them to get you worked up, lifes too short to worry about what stupid people have to say!|`|N7PHK12raa	Tell them that their remedies don't seem to be working on their severly disfigured face so why would they work on acne ;) (btw good luck with the roaccutane, my friend just went on it and had absolutely amazing results)|`|xAjTXYLUaa	you tell them the truth|`|ztke9DOPaa	You tell them straight up its a medical problem.|`|AYg6ksLuaa	I was lucky and had a dermatologist that prescribed it to me when I was in high school. I have not had any major problems with my skin since then. Stress and diet are not the only contributors to acne, it can hereditary. It has been over 10 years since I have taken the accutan and the only I ever have to deal with is minor blacks heads and the occassional (like twice a year) zit. When people try to tell you about acne just let them know that you are under the care of a dermatologist and you will are going to follow the orders of your doctor.

GXiCrhVYaa	There are actually 5 types of bipolar disorder, and I can  describe each one only briefly. You can google "bipolar disorder types" for fuller explanations.    In bipolar I, a person experiences depression or major depression as well as manic episodes, which includes feelings of euphoria, inflated self-esteem, little need for sleep, restlessness, fidgeting, etc. This is followed by normal periods or depression. Only one episode of mania can lead to a diagnosis of bipolar one.    In bipolar II, a person has most of the same symptoms of mania but at a much smaller intensity (hypomania). While hypomanic, people can generally function fairly well. However, they eventually tend to fall into very deep states of depression.    In cyclothymia, there are frequent alterations between mild depression and hypomania for at least a two year period.    Most bipolar people swing up and down slowly. When people have more than four episodes a year, it is called rapid cycling.    Finally, people can have symptoms of mania and depression simultaneously. For example, a person can be very energetic with no need for sleep yet has very bleak, even suicidal, thoughts. This is called mixed episode bipolar.    Please remember that despite all these ups and downs, people who are bipolar can have long periods of feeling content and "normal."|`|hWc65sEtaa	Extreme highs, extreme lows.

I was in your situation and it's not fun without being horny and feeling in the mood when needed.  I also felt like my orgasms (if I would even get one) were really weak.  Probably because of my sex drive.    However, I tried exercising and dieting but nothing seemed to be working.  I thought I was screwed.  I then found something just as amazing as the vibrator.    My friend at work told me about this stuff she took to raise her sex drive.  It was a natural herbal supplement and was I lucky to of found it.  Theres no side effects and the sex drive is just tremendous along with orgasms that are blasting.  The stuff is called Hersolution pills.  At the time I saved money on them at herenhancement.com    What I did was tried out for 3 months and that was really it.  I found taking them every other day or so was the best to stretch it out.

The muscles relax after a while, but the soreness can persist for several days.   Try stretching your arms above you head very gently, and then lower them slowly, this can help get fresh oxygenated blood to the tissues a lot quicker, allowing you more comfort.

Rs2C52tAaa	If you do exercises that use leg muscles you can increase the definition of those muscles by working them out. But your body takes fat from various areas around your body where it decides, and you have no say in where. If you drive a stick shift, your left leg may have more muscular development than someone who drives an automatic car. But your leg will not have less fat because of the extra work out you do with your leg.    How do you lose fat from anywhere on your body? You have to exercise in order to burn more calories, which are merely a measure of energy. Fat is stored energy. When you burn more than you eat, some of it will come off your body. People have their own individual "trouble spots". Some people gain weight first on their hips and that's the last place they lose it. Others complain they have fat thighs and can't trim them down. Leg exercises will make your legs more toned; but they won't burn off the fat on your legs.    So do the exercises to keep your muscles toned for the best appearance. Keeping your legs in shape and toned will do wonders for the way you feel about your legs and yourself. But know there is not a way to reduce fat off of any particular spot on your body. Love your body for the way it is. Keep up the toning for your health. Do the cardio exercises to keep your energy-burning rate high, and let the fat come off where it may!    I think the best way make your legs look better is to build your quads and hamstrings. Great exercises for that are squats, deadlifts, leg presses. You can add curls and extensions. -(upper part)...    Hope that helps.x.

dkoGI9nfaa	A pinched nerve can cause you to decrease the intensity of your workout without you being aware of it and that can affect muscle growth.  Diet and lifestyle cn affect your energy and well being levels which can impact on your workout but there is absolutely no way that a pinched nerve can affect muscle growth.  I think it is your exercise regime that is the main culprit.  Do you have an instructor at the gym?  You should consult him/her.

Just get some whey and rehydrate with water or even gatorade to get the same electrolytes and results for far less of a price.

AA11599407	Just type in diverticulitis/diverticulitis, losis is little out pouches on the colon wall where material can become trapped causing infection which results in the itis stage. A high fiber diet is recommended, doesn't take any special foods or cooking, just read labels. A good place to start is cutting back on meat and processed foods and adding a high fiber cereal in the morning.

GvBtoKsqaa	Lots of benefits. Your kidneys love it when you drink lots of water, and in turn so does your liver. Your kidneys are like a filter soaking up bad things in our blood and converting it to urine to be expelled. They need lot's of water to do their job. Dehydrated kidneys are about as effective as coffee grounds are at brewing coffee with no water.<br>  <br>  If your kidneys are short of water they have a hard time doing their own job, which means your liver has to pitch in to help. And if your liver is busy doing your kidneys' job it won't have enough energy for it's own and one of it's primary jobs is to convert fat into energy. This is why it's essential that you drink lots of water if you're trying to lose body fat, because doing so will allow your kidney's to handle their job on their own and your liver will be able to focus on burning fat.<br>  <br>  Also it helps your body deliver nutrients throughout your body and a bunch of other stuff.|`|ODvnyAdlaa	to fluch out toxins and hydrate your body xx|`|oGFNIQdIaa	our body has about 70% water... a normal not fat body... a fat body has less then 40-50 % water... by drinking lots of water u can restore the percentage of water in body... also it prevents water retention... also by not drinking enough water u get dehydrated and dehydration is a source for many diseases ( recent studies prove this) also water help the chemical reactions in our bodies ... reactions necesaries 4 our metabolism... so if our body must be 70% water... it needs to work to functione propely lots of water|`|d861778018432f5f26321e9fa06ec7faaa	increased blood flow|`|uJLmbINyaa	helps the digestion of food|`|cvIcBH7Waa	clear pee|`|NPMKqJlMaa	Drinking water enhances fat loss<br>  Combat ailments<br>  reduce hunger<br>  hydrates your skin-Look younger|`|vbeV4euvaa	it can improve your skin and hair and  drinking lots of water will make u feel better and more healthier.

If you are a petite person, then your breasts may be too big for your frame which can lead to back pain, shoulder pain and more.

XwgoLxnhaa	I have been through it all and know what's it about.  The main thing is to stick in there.  You can't be an addict to food and never exercise if you want to live a healthy life and keep the weight off.  I've worked out, done every diet, and all types of classes.  <br>  <br>  Nothing works,  besides dedication and intelligence towards the subject of losing weight.  <br>  <br>  First,  depending on how much weight you need to lose,  your diet is the first concern.  You can't eat 10,000 calories a day and expect the weight to come off,  even if you are exercising a lot.  Which brings us to the next thing.  Duh,  Exercising...<br>  <br>  This is a must especially if you need to a lot of weight.  Get at least 30 mins of some good hardcore exercising.  Do some cardio,  in the long run,  it's good for the heart.<br>  <br>  However,  I find the most hardest part of losing weight/keeping it off,  in my diet.  It's so hard to keep your fingers out of the cookie jar or those chocolate goodies.  I've found a great addition to help any one out,  it's a natural weight loss supplement called Proactol.  Now don't get all crazy on me and say diet pills don't work.  That is true,  but not in this case.  This one isn't meant to burn pounds while you sit on the couch.  It's an appetite suppressant,  along with being a fat binder.  I saved money on the pills at theweightlossplace.com along with getting some good info.  It basically makes those fingers not go towards the cookie jar.  For me it's the best pill I've tried and I've tried cupboards full.  Now this doesn't mean you have to follow my foot steps but I've successfully lost roughly 70 pounds and keeping it off til this day.  <br>  <br>  Well good luck and remember what I said,  Dedicate.|`|AA12144552	Please do not flame me for this but...because you are a woman, your body ( by design) will store fat, its just one of those things.<br>  <br>  Honestly, regrettably i dont belive there is a "good"  diet pill anyplace, most either do not work or make your heart explode (phen-phen). <br>  Alli does work but the side effects can be disasterous (anal leakage and explosive diarreah)<br>  <br>  It just may be your genetics to be a "larger woman" look at your famly, your mom, your grand parents, your dad....you are the sum of your genetic parts it simply may not be possible for you to be waif-like thin. <br>  <br>  Having said that, truth be known, there is no Magic bullit diet, you must find the diet and excercise plan that works for you. you would be best served to spend you money on quality multi-vitamen.

I used to weigh 198 lbs and my height is only 5'8" - for my height and with that kind of weight I'm really obese!

It brought me back to where I started again.  I am sure you happen to experience it like me.<br>  <br>  The strange thing is.. I tried having low fat diet, eating low carbs, starve at times, follow diet programs and so on but it just didn't help!<br>  <br>  Then one day, an old friend of mine who used to be obese saw me.

The best way to lose weight is to put down all the sugar, pasta, and butter. Eat 3 sensible meals a day with about 3 oz of lean protein per meal with fruit and veggies, that means no pasta sides or chips on the side, and two small snacks (some kind of veggies). Stay away from the processed foods.|`|U9R005b1aa	My first suggestion would be to just go in for a physical with a doctor.

You eat less and lose weight.<br>  <br>  The problem is that people take the diet pills thinking that the pill itself will do the work. You still have to cut down on your food intake in order to lose - so don't waste your money if the pills aren't suppressing your appetite.<br>  <br>  The only way to lose weight is to burn more calories than you consume.

Tu9S1WaNaa	I'm sorry, the only way is to go to take antibiotics.  UTI's can go to your kidneys and finally your blood stream.  They are caused by a bacteria.  You have to take antibiotics to be sure to get rid of it.  If it spreads, you can get very sick.<br>  <br>  Do you have a Health Right free clinic in your area?  Maybe you can find a Doctor to take payments or a cash flat fee.  Be sure to tell them that you need a cheaper antibiotic or generic if possible.<br>  <br>  Call urgent care clinics and Dr's offices and ask how much for a cash visit and a urinalysis.  ER's are the most expensive.<br>  <br>  Do not drink anything with caffeine, drink plenty of water, and you can get something over-the-counter called AZO for the discomfort.  These are only temporary fixes and like a band-aid on an artery. Please get the proper antibiotics and a urinalysis.|`|OMxNblImaa	you shout drink plenty of water to flush your system out , and also plenty of cranberry juice :)|`|VtZzinTSaa	Ural sachets dissolved in water, it makes the urine more alkaline therefore decreasing the acidity of ur urine, which is whats causing the burning sensation. <br>  <br>  Cranberry juice also helps stop the bacteria from sticking to the walls.<br>  <br>  but yeh, find 50 bucks and go see a GP at a 24 hr medical centre, or go to a public hospital emergency room. u may have to wait but too bad, u need antibiotics, i once had a uti and didnt finish my antibiotics because the pain went away.

In general, hormones don't dictate sexual orientation- neither a lack of testosterone or an abundance of it makes someone gay or straight (likewise, estrogen doesn't cause someone to like men).  However, hormones can play a role in what one notices (smells, sights, & general perception of beauty) & by extension, one may sexualize what one finds beautiful.<br>  <br>  For those who engaged in sex play with boys but later became & remained heterosexual, that happened when they were 15-16.<br>  <br>  Give yourself time to grow into your sexuality & give yourself freedom to accept what you find.

Doctors are very frequently members of the religions that try to impose circumcision on all males, and are biased.<br>  <br>  Disadvantages?     Circumcision is abnormal and unnatural, it damages the penis and diminishes sexual sensitivity, the pleasure in sex, and the intensity of orgasms, as well as the size of the penis.<br>  <br>  Circumcision also increases the susceptibility of HIV and other diseases.     They've recently discovered that the foreskin has Langerhans cells, which have antiviral and antibacterial properties.     That' why the US has had a much higher rate of HIV than the countries in Europe, South America, Scandinavia and Asia that don't habitually mutilate males.<br>  <br>  For other complications and adverse effects (the doctors never disclose them and actually suppress them) you can type in CIRCUMSTITIONS on your browser for more information.<br>  <br>  Of course anyone with intelligence can understand that a whole, natural and normal penis with a foreskin feels and functions better than one that's been scarred, mutilated and made partial by circumcision.<br>  <br>  I know firsthand, as I experienced more damage than usual from circumcision, which destroyed most of my sexual sensitivity, much more than most victims.<br>  <br>  I finally found out about foreskin restoration and have vasty improved my sensitivity and function.  The intensity of orgasms has also dramatically increased.<br>  <br>  Circumcision is the worst hoax ever perpetrated on the male sex. <br>  <br>  A foreskin is not a birth defect; it is a birthright.<br>  <br>  ERIC|`|VSWl45cKaa	You need to know more than how it looks.

dJuEtGxraa	Here are a few tips;<br>  <br>  WHEN to eat for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? Eat (at least) three times a day. <br>  Because when you eat only once a day, your metabolism gets slower than it already is! That's the main reason. Sounds funny, but to lose weight... you must eat (the right things, of course) <br>  ? Eat low-fat, high-fiber foods such as salads and vegetable pastas.<br>  ? Your last meal should be before 18:00. Try. <br>  OK, one apple after 18:00 <br>  ? Don't starve <br>  Starvation is not good for losing weight, nor your health. <br>  Starvation is the worse thing you can do in a weight loss diet. <br>  ? Try oatmeal instead of cornflakes for breakfast--eating oatmeal can help reduce cholesterol levels, and its high fiber content will keep you full longer.<br>  <br>  WHAT to drink for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? Drink 6-8 glasses of water every day ! <br>  Can be tap, plain, mineral, sparkling. I just love mineral sparkling water! <br>  This improves your bowel, reduces the "hunger" sensation, and hydrates your skin. Your skin will look much better after the first weeks! <br>  Don't believe the slogan "water makes me fat". Beside being stupid... you might get into serious troubles with your kidneys. <br>  ? Drink ONLY natural juices, freshly squeezed! <br>  Don't drink Coca Cola, Pepsi, Spite etc. during the diet. Even lite or light versions. <br>  <br>  <br>  Exercise for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? If you want quicker results - exercise would be good. <br>  ? Don't just sit in front of the TV and eat peanuts... <br>  I guarantee THIS won't work for your weight loss... <br>  ? Start a regular exercise program and stick with it. Don't be afraid of those sweat suits and Lycra pants! <br>  ? Start swimming. Swimming is an excellent exercise to get involved with, since it increases blood flow and uses muscles we don't regularly use. Start a swimming program and try to do it 3 times a week. You will feel excellent and rejuvenated.<br>  ? Choose an exercise program that you enjoy, and don't shun the unconventional. For instance, did you know that regular vigorous dancing is exercise too?<br>  ? Also Cardiovascular exercises such as running, jogging, or aerobics will help you lose that unwanted belly fat. Weight training can also help you lose body fat because the more muscle mass you have, the more ability your system has to burn body fat.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  Hope this helps~|`|n8Db77zbaa	Im a former bulimic and I had the same problem, on top of exercising an hour everyday (make sure the resistance is higher on your cardio machine) make a trip to the sauna for about 15 minutes after your workout to sweat off more calories.|`|dUj7rP2haa	Given that you're recovering from an eating disorder...

I used to weigh 198 lbs and my height is only 5'8" - for my height and with that kind of weight I'm really obese!  I tried the "Master cleanse" and other diet recipes, and I even watched Richard Simmons videos but they didn't helped me at all!<br>  <br>  I tried going to a gym with a strict diet once and within a week later, I stopped going to gym and started eating more than before.  It brought me back to where I started again.  I am sure you happen to experience it like me.<br>  <br>  The strange thing is.. I tried having low fat diet, eating low carbs, starve at times, follow diet programs and so on but it just didn't help!<br>  <br>  Then one day, an old friend of mine who used to be obese saw me.  She teased at me at first and I felt embarassed about it and she told me her secret on how she lost her weight.  She gave me a book entitled "Strip That Fat" - within a month I lost 18.3 lbs!<br>  <br>  I seriously recommend and urge you to learn more about this since it has helped me a lot - it demystifies false beliefs like low fat diet, eating low carbs and such help you!  <br>  <br>  Learn the real truth:<br>  www.Strip-That-Fat.tk|`|SpcYCBndaa	Simple formula:<br>  Eat less<br>  Do more<br>  <br>  ..............@@@~.............<br>  ................(o o)................      <br>  ==== ooO=(_)=Ooo=====<br>  <br>  Can I get ten points?<br>  Please<br>  Pretty Please<br>  Pretty Pretty Please<br>  Pretty Pretty Please with a cherry on the top<br>  You know you want to <br>  Go for it<br>  You can do it!<br>  -Thanks|`|2RzEaod9aa	Don't lower it.

In order to try and put your conscience at ease, you have found a good "motive", but if your real motive was to help couples in need to try to conceive, then you could simply "donate" your sperm, much like being an organ donor.  In other words, if it's immoral to sell a baby, then it's immoral to sell the makings of a baby. Personally, I believe that there are plenty of children in need of homes in this world already, so couples who can't conceive have that option.|`|QBUypAmAaa	I'm considering this myself actually, no I don't think it is a bad thing to do. I would be helping those who can't conceive and I'd like to have the comfort of knowing that I did procreate once in my lifetime lol. Even if I'd never see the child or come in contact with him/her. You may have some moments of realisation where you go "whoa, I can't believe I did that" or that you're in some awe that someone, somewhere out there is really your child. It may make you feel sad or at ease or a fluster of emotions, that's what I expect at least.<br>  <br>  -KH|`|pRF5LLloaa	You would ALSO be jerking off in a cup for money.  that makes you a bit of a male prostitute, but without the "benefits".<br>  <br>  if you wanna do that, I suggest the porno industry instead.|`|otZA4H78aa	No i don't think its wrong..

ZDC81VjZaa	Okay... when you are first starting out, start small and work your way up.  You're putting demanding strain and sprain on your back which had not been prepared for what you have decided to put it through.  <br>  <br>  Some pain is good as you're building up tolerance and endurance but to hear bones and cartilage snapping and crunching and cracking... that is a warning from your body that worse things could happen if you don't lighten up.  Talk to your parents about it and make sure you aren't doing permanent damage to yourself and while you're at it... ask if you can get a membership to a local gym who has professional spotters and trainers on their staff.  That way, you can get the most out of your workouts without further injury to yourself.<br>  <br>  It sounds like you have heart... just lacking discipline and guidance.  I admire your stamina... but really, you should inform your parents and your doctor as to what you are up to so that you don't further damage yourself... God forbid beyond repair.<br>  <br>  PS... Sorry, I didn't read anywhere that you'd been doing them for 4 months... just that you'd started recently.  Was concerned you might've been over doing it is all.  <br>  <br>  Maybe give those arms and shoulders of yours a rest while you construct other muscle groups... like abs or quads or something different for a bit of a change up in your routine.<br>  <br>  Do you have an exercise ball... not just for girls.  There are SO many ways to shape yourself up and believe it or not... you can even do various types of push ups to help sculpt your arms and your obliques and the rest of your whole self.  Fairly easy with tremendous and fairly fast results and they've different body balls for different things... depends on what you want out of it all.  I'd personally recommend one with resistance chords so you can still work on those arms and shoulders.<br>  <br>  Here are some images for you to flip through to get an idea of what I'm saying.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://images.search.yahoo.com/search/images?_adv_prop=image&fr=freeze&va=body+ball+exercises&sz=all">http://images.search.yahoo.com/search/im...</a>|`|nAp688tZaa	There are shoulder injuries that can occur or be aggravated by exercises that focus specifically on the shoulder joint and muscles surrounding them.  Try taking a couple of days off from your regimen and if the pain does not either decrease or disappear, it would be wise to see an orthopedic surgeon and have the joint checked out.  Chances are that the pain is simply from overuse, but there is always a possibility that there is damage to either to Rotator Cuff or to the Biceps tendon that could have caused a SLAP tear.  Shoulder injuries are notoriously difficult to recover from, especially if surgical intervention is required.  Use ice for 20 minutes each hour to combat any swelling and pain and also use some OTC pain relievers like Naproxen (Aleve) or Ibuprofen (Advil or Motrin).  If this is not sufficient to alleviate the pain, you can also safely take Tylenol with the other NSAID's.  Just may sure that you follow the directions on the box and do not exceed the max daily dosage of any of them, which is 2400 mg of ibuprofen, 4,000 mg of Tylenol and 1,500 mg of Naproxen (Aleve).  If you do not notice much of an improvement, then it is time to see an orthopedic doctor that specializes in shoulder treatments and surgical repair.  I hope, for your sake that this is just a case of overuse because surgery on the shoulder takes a very long time to heal, no matter your current physical strength or age.  Good luck and I hope that you can find some relief soon.|`|c4XBHw6laa	well ya pain can be a good and a bad sign cuz i do it ta i love push ups but listen the good part iz that u can be gettin stronger and better bbut da bad iz that u could hav tore something so go to the hospital and check it out and also if the pain getts worse just stop doin it for a while felz me|`|v4HbYrgYaa	use heat pads

UZJ7wVc8aa	The key to starting an exercise routine is to make the changes slowly. You can't go from being sedentary to active overnight and hope to succeed. Start out by exercising 1-2 times per week and eventually moving up to 3-5 times per week. Only increase the amount of exercise you do per week when you feel ready.<br>  <br>  Exercise routines also have to be well rounded to be successful. You need elements of flexibility, cardiovascular and strength training. You don't need to go to the gym to get a good workout, but having access to that type of equipment is a definite plus. Flexibility isn't very intensive and can be done on most if not all days of the week. It won't directly help you with your goals but it will lead to better performance - it will make exercising a lot easier.<br>  <br>  Cardio should be done 3-5 times per week while strength training should be done 2-3 times per week.

Don't starve <br>  Starvation is not good for losing weight, nor your health. <br>  Starvation is the worse thing you can do in a weight loss diet. <br>  ? Try oatmeal instead of cornflakes for breakfast--eating oatmeal can help reduce cholesterol levels, and its high fiber content will keep you full longer.<br>  <br>  WHAT to drink for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? Drink 6-8 glasses of water every day ! <br>  Can be tap, plain, mineral, sparkling.

You can form muscle in the ab, but if it's covered in belly fat, you're not going to see the results.  Cardio also does good work on the abs.  Try doing some brisk walking with some jogging.  Start by walking five minutes, run one, then walk five, run one, keeping this routing til you reach 30 minutes.  Once you're comfortable with this, up the running to two minutes.  Keep the routine increasing the running until you are running the entire 30 minutes.  In the mean time, do your ab workouts (most trainers say warm-up 5 min, work-out then do cardio last).  Get some free weights and do some lunges and arm lifting.  Rotate the arms and legs (legs Mon, arms Tues, etc.)  If you put the time into it, you'll get to where you feel weird if you don't get your work out.

Try oatmeal instead of cornflakes for breakfast--eating oatmeal can help reduce cholesterol levels, and its high fiber content will keep you full longer.<br>  <br>  WHAT to drink for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? Drink 6-8 glasses of water every day ! <br>  Can be tap, plain, mineral, sparkling. I just love mineral sparkling water! <br>  This improves your bowel, reduces the "hunger" sensation, and hydrates your skin. Your skin will look much better after the first weeks! <br>  Don't believe the slogan "water makes me fat". Beside being stupid... you might get into serious troubles with your kidneys. <br>  ? Drink ONLY natural juices, freshly squeezed! <br>  Don't drink Coca Cola, Pepsi, Spite etc. during the diet. Even lite or light versions. <br>  <br>  <br>  Exercise for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? If you want quicker results - exercise would be good. <br>  ? Don't just sit in front of the TV and eat peanuts... <br>  I guarantee THIS won't work for your weight loss... <br>  ? Start a regular exercise program and stick with it. Don't be afraid of those sweat suits and Lycra pants! <br>  ? Start swimming. Swimming is an excellent exercise to get involved with, since it increases blood flow and uses muscles we don't regularly use. Start a swimming program and try to do it 3 times a week. You will feel excellent and rejuvenated.<br>  ? Choose an exercise program that you enjoy, and don't shun the unconventional. For instance, did you know that regular vigorous dancing is exercise too?<br>  ? Also Cardiovascular exercises such as running, jogging, or aerobics will help you lose that unwanted belly fat. Weight training can also help you lose body fat because the more muscle mass you have, the more ability your system has to burn body fat.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  Hope this helps~|`|69MJDg55aa	Hey!

Try mixing up your routine a little.  If you always do the same exercise try something different at least a couple of times during the week.

XluG9FEWaa	Yes, epidurals can have many side effects and risks. An epidural involves sticking a needle next to your spinal cord, so you can imagine that even the most expert anesthesiologists can still slip up with dire consequences. Even if the epidural is administered correctly, the correct dosage of pain blocker is not always given. Even if everything goes smoothly, not all women react the same way to the anesthesia. You can suffer a multitude of side effects from short-term lower paralysis to nausea to cardiac arrest.<br>  <br>  The pain in childbirth can be managed through many different, natural methods. If you are a first-time mom, I would suggest taking Bradley classes, if you can afford it. Hypnobirthing and other methods can also help you relax and manage your pain. Remember, too, that in natural childbirth, your body releases a large quantity of endorphins that act as natural uppers.<br>  <br>  While childbirth hurts, there's no doubt of that, the worst part of the pain of childbirth is the fear of pain, not the pain itself. Make sure you research all your options before choosing to go with medicated birth. I've included a few resources below.<br>  <br>  I had a baby using the Bradley method, and the worst part of it was the annoying hospital nurse who kept trying to talk me through contractions. The pain was bad, but it faded quickly and it was not more than I could bear.

Um75aRZFaa	The allergic reaction you are experiencing is due to the dander that goes into the air when you groom your cat. Dander is basically dried crystallized saliva and skin cells. Your best bet is to take a Benadryl (diphenhydramine) before you groom your cat if that is the only time you have an allergic reaction. If you have more persistant daily allergies I would recommend taking over the counter Zyrtec (Cetirizine) which is a very affective antihistamine that will stop your body from producing histamines which cause your eyes to swell, itch and water.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	prophalax with an antihistamine & follow up with your allergist.|`|goY0JHzlaa	You are probably allergic to your cat's dandur.|`|sR8AsyyWaa	Don't shave the poor kitty!

f1nX6thdaa	yorkshire is right! I'm a lifelong runner and a common excersise is to walk on your toes till you can't anymore then walk on your heals till you can't and so on and so forth.

They do more harm than good and in most cases they don't work and at best have a placebo effect.  That's the 6th time today I've seen someone promoting Acai berry.<br>  <br>  You need carbs.  The question is which kind.  You want foods low on the GLYCEMIC INDEX.  Instead of an idaho potato go with a sweet potato.  Instead of white bread, try a 9 grain kind.  Simple sugars should be avoided but complex sugars such as fructose are fine.  Eat more fruits and vegetables and reduce intake of fried or fatty meats.  NO JUNK FOOD and the only supplements you need are multi-vitamins like one-a day or in your case maybe Flintstones Chewables. <br>  <br>  To lose 1 pound you need to burn 3700 calories of fat (Low intensity workout).  20 miles of walking permanently takes off 1 pound of fat. (2 miles walking is 370 fat calories -- rough approximation) If your body has fewer simple sugars to burn, the more it will burn fat instead.|`|MpVQE8tnaa	Get some advice from a doctor--going without any sugar is not good for your body<br>  <br>  In my ipinion you don't need to lose weight|`|2RzEaod9aa	You need natural carbs.

Even physicians don't try diagnosing themselves.  When that happens, we say "The doctor who diagnoses himself, diagnoses a fool!"

AA10606659	"candy flipping" is actually acid and ecstasy. "hippy flipping" is what your friend is looking at. <br>  <br>  I dont recommend it. Some people think that taking ex while tripping will help prevent a bad trip. Unless of course, you get really speedy tabs (speed based). Sometimes you get caffine mixed with ex, other times (usually) you get meth. People dont like hearing that, but its the truth mate. If you or your friends have done speed based tabs (which in my experience is the most popular) chances are youve done meth. Too much meth in the tabs make them really speedy i.e you dont really roll you just tweak. Tweaking can and usually does make people a little paranoid, maybe not right off the bat, but over time and continued use. Everything effects everyone a little differently though.

Mixing hallucinogens increases their already high unpredictability and may contribute to a "bad trip".<br>  <br>  Mixing LSD or mushrooms with Ecstasy is known as "candyflipping" and though some users say to take Ecstasy as a way to lessen the chances of a bad LSD trip, all three drugs are very unpredictable and can lead to a number of different results.<br>  <br>  As a general rule Ecstasy should not be mixed with any other drug, especially not alcohol. Alcohol is involved in the majority of Ecstasy related deaths through its strain on the kidneys and worsening of dehydration levels. Alcohol also makes the come down from Ecstasy harder to handle. When mixed with amphetamines, the Ecstasy high state is lengthened, but this can strain the kidneys and heart and also lead to anxiety and paranoia. Anti-depressants reduce the neurotoxicity of Ecstasy and can end an "E-trip" more quickly than many users would want. Marijuana helps the high come more quickly and lessens the intense rushes of Ecstasy. Users say that it aids in the come down and makes use more "psychedelic". If users want to come down from an Ecstasy high more easily they normally smoke heroin or use Ketamine. Ketamine has a tendency to overpower Ecstasy and users may end up staring at one spot on a wall or ceiling alone for an hour. It can also create either a calming feeling for the last few hours of Ecstasy use, or else heighten the effect.<br>  <br>  It's doubtful that you'll die from it, but ecstasy in general can have an incredible effect on your kidneys and liver and should always be done in moderation (if ever).|`|1WBHQpQmaa	in all honesty, go to erowid.com they have alot of information on recreational drugs. they even have maxi/min dos per gender & body type to get the best high you possibly can.<br>  <br>  not that i am condoning anything but marijuana but thats what i would do|`|AA10609634	Sounds like a coma or a heart attack or stroke or permanent brain damage or death waiting to happen.|`|IP4ym3Ynaa	you get horny and hullicinate?|`|U56SKlloaa	you get shroomex  :)|`|rzLGCrlfaa	you dance and get those glow sticks and check them out while dancing|`|fwcuyh37aa	u see pink elephants nd u prob wont be round to tell the grandchildren the story
nqK90MGcaa	I would specify which ones you are worried about and make sure they test you for the HPV virus. But basically if you've ever had a pap test, that's what it's like. They just make you lay down on the table, insert a swab and take a sample of your inner vaginal tissue.

Also if a STI is left untreated it can cause infertility, chronic pain and even death so the earlier they are identified and dealt with, the better.[1]<br>  There is often delay between becoming infected and the infection being detectable by testing.

Raw eggs, garlic and fresh unprocessed meats contain high levels of sulphur-containing amino acids and help to maintain optimal glutathione levels.
tv5KOihBaa	Yes. Vitamin B6 is better because it converts Homocysteine into Cysteine. Because Homocysteine is from Methionine, Vitamin B12 is not the solution because Vitamin B12 converts Homocystein into Methionine again. But Vitamin B12 is Essential for our nervous system.

VriZPTHbaa	I had Lasik eye surgery done after wearing glasses for 16 years. It has been perfect for me. I have had no changes. Of course, as I age, I expect changes. I also co-manage refractive surgery and have seen hundreds of successful patients. It doesn't hurt, generally. There is a bit of pressure, but no real pain if you have LASIK. The PRK version (where no flap is cut) is a little more uncomfortable for the first few days following the procedure. I've seen several people who said they were in some pain, but healed just fine. I used to wear both glasses and contact lenses. I had LASIK done and it's the best decision I've ever made. I can see clearly, no squinting, no driving with glasses anymore. I can read road signs, see the individual leaves in the trees (they're not just a blurry mess anymore). It's also nice to be able to see what time it is when I wake up. The procedure is painless (although a bit uncomfortable) but takes less than 15 minutes. Highly recommended. <br>  <br>  If you need help finding a reputed surgeon in India u can check out the ink below:<br>  <a href="http://www.indianhealthguru.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.indianhealthguru.com</a><br>  You can schedule a free appointment there and they'll answer all your questions and see if you qualify as a good candidate or not
dJuEtGxraa	Here are a few tips;<br>  <br>  WHEN to eat for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? Eat (at least) three times a day. <br>  Because when you eat only once a day, your metabolism gets slower than it already is! That's the main reason. Sounds funny, but to lose weight... you must eat (the right things, of course) <br>  ? Eat low-fat, high-fiber foods such as salads and vegetable pastas.<br>  ? Your last meal should be before 18:00. Try. <br>  OK, one apple after 18:00 <br>  ? Don't starve <br>  Starvation is not good for losing weight, nor your health. <br>  Starvation is the worse thing you can do in a weight loss diet. <br>  ? Try oatmeal instead of cornflakes for breakfast--eating oatmeal can help reduce cholesterol levels, and its high fiber content will keep you full longer.<br>  <br>  WHAT to drink for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? Drink 6-8 glasses of water every day ! <br>  Can be tap, plain, mineral, sparkling. I just love mineral sparkling water! <br>  This improves your bowel, reduces the "hunger" sensation, and hydrates your skin. Your skin will look much better after the first weeks! <br>  Don't believe the slogan "water makes me fat". Beside being stupid... you might get into serious troubles with your kidneys. <br>  ? Drink ONLY natural juices, freshly squeezed! <br>  Don't drink Coca Cola, Pepsi, Spite etc. during the diet. Even lite or light versions. <br>  <br>  <br>  Exercise for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? If you want quicker results - exercise would be good. <br>  ? Don't just sit in front of the TV and eat peanuts... <br>  I guarantee THIS won't work for your weight loss... <br>  ? Start a regular exercise program and stick with it. Don't be afraid of those sweat suits and Lycra pants! <br>  ? Start swimming. Swimming is an excellent exercise to get involved with, since it increases blood flow and uses muscles we don't regularly use. Start a swimming program and try to do it 3 times a week. You will feel excellent and rejuvenated.<br>  ? Choose an exercise program that you enjoy, and don't shun the unconventional. For instance, did you know that regular vigorous dancing is exercise too?<br>  ? Also Cardiovascular exercises such as running, jogging, or aerobics will help you lose that unwanted belly fat. Weight training can also help you lose body fat because the more muscle mass you have, the more ability your system has to burn body fat.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  Hope this helps~|`|xuV1xsImaa	Im a little lazy but one thing that helps me keep motivated during a workout is my iPod Touch.

cb2NxPERaa	Men don't stop growing muscle. I think what you're really asking is, when do men's muscles stop developing naturally. I would say that's around the puberty age, 18-21.

3fd2288554aaf55a30c81ff30a54bba2aa	I have been in mental hospitals many times, because I have bipolar disorder that has not responded to medication.  I wrote up an essay on what I have experienced/seen at mental hospitals, because this question does come up on yahoo answers once in awhile, so I'll give you that.<br>  ***<br>  Here is what happens in a mental hospital - First, usually it is not a separate hospital, but a wing of a regular, community hospital. You go to the ER where you are seen by a psychiatrist after waiting a few hours, depending how busy they are. In some states, there is a terrible shortage of inpatient mental beds & they may send you very far away to a hospital that has space. They give you a brief physical. They often have you give a urine sample to test for drugs (drug use can mimic mental illness, plus many people are dual-diagnosis) They assign you to a room. They go thru your stuff to make sure you don't have anything sharp or anything you can hang yourself with (belt) or drugs or whatever. Then you take your stuff and put it away in your room, into a dresser, and you may or may not have a roommate. They do a personal search -most places what they do is have you change into scrubs then they go thru your clothes. If they have reason to believe you are concealing something, they may do a more thorough search. This is a problem because many people with severe mental illness have a serious sexual abuse history, and can be seriously re-traumatized. For this reason, I have filled out a Psychiatric Advance Directive specifying that a search is a problem for me, and they are pretty good about respecting that legal document.  My drug tests are always negative, and I don't cut, and I'm sure that is partly why they are pretty good about it. The threat of a search is terrifying to me, though.<br>  Then you go see a psychiatrist and talk to some nurses. See a counselor. This is over a few days, on and off. You go to groups where you learn stuff. You hang out in the break room and play cards or watch TV. Every morning they take people's blood pressure & occasionally weigh patients. This is because mental health medications can cause serious weight gain, due to appetite increase or cause insulin resistance.  Sometimes they give you a personality test, to determine if you have any personality disorders, or other problems. The psychiatrist will talk to you for about an hour, and then give you meds based on what he/she thinks will be most likely to help you. The staff at the hospital will find you a psychiatrist and a counselor in the community and set up appointments for you. You can take phone calls if you are not in group or meeting with a doctor or counselor or something. If you are a kid, you can only talk on the phone & visit with immediate family. Visiting hours are really limited; you get about 2 hours a day and if your family is coming from far away, that isn't very long. After a few days, if you are reasonably stable, you can usually go outside for a walking break with staff.  In my state, you can't go outside the hospital for a smoking break anymore (no smoking on hospital grounds in MN). That is a crisis for many patients but staff give out fake cigarettes & nicotine patches. Some hospitals have an enclosed area where patients can go outside. All the hospitals in California were that way, none have been that way in Minnesota, except for the new 16 bed public facilities the state just built to replace the old, abusive state hospitals.<br>  <br>  Most people behave pretty normally. There are not many "take downs' anymore because the law prohibits them unless a person is endangering themselves or others -it can't be used as just discipline anymore. I did see this abused at one hospital, though, & it was very upsetting. Straightjackets are not used anymore. If a person does need to be put in restraints, a staff person must sit there and watch them continuously, I believe is the law now. Too many people have died in restraints. Some state hospital facilities are still very abusive or neglectful - in Georgia, for example, many people have died of conditions that were totally treatable, the patient complained or had obvious symptoms, and were ignored. One girl was in agony and lay there until her intestines ruptured from severe constipation (due to her meds), for example, and she died. It took several hours before staff noticed she was dead,even though they are supposed to check on you every 1/2 hour or so. In general, some people under suicide watch are watched continuously, but most people are checked about every 1/2 hour. <br>  Your room is pretty normal looking - rather than bars on the windows, they have glass that I'm sure is unbreakable. There won't be any hooks or anything that you can hang yourself on. You get a narrow plain hospital bed & a pillow, there is a dresser for you to put your stuff away, and often a desk. Most places you do get your own bathroom that you share with a roommate (but not an adjacent room like in some regular hospital rooms). You don't get your own phone, usually you have to use one in an area near the front desk so they can watch you and be sure you don't hang yourself with the phone cord or something. <br>  Psychiatrists rarely seem to be interested in talking to the patient's family, stupid in my opinion, but that does seem to be the case. If you are suicidal or really out of control, they may put a 72 hour hold on you (called different names in different places) and that doesn't include weekends or holidays, at least in California or Minnesota, the 2 states I have been in. After that, if they still want to hold you, they have to get a court order & you can defend yourself.|`|1Hqwwphoaa	I am 15 and I spent the last 2 weeks in the mental hospital.<br>  <br>  What are they like?

For the first twenty four  hours they check on you every fifteen minutes.  During the week the patients are kept on a busy schedule with morning check-in group, other groups throughout the day, and the nightly wrap up group.    People meet with their team which consists of a psychiatrist and a social worker to discuss medication, how they are feeling, and discharge plans.  It is a locked unit.  Patients have to receive permission from their team to get a pass to go out.  If a patient is not cooperating, he/she may not be allowed to go to the cafeteria to pick out his/her own meals or out on a pass.  I was in the hospital quite a few times for Major Depression.  My medication(s) are helping me feel better.  I still am depressed.   Hopefully things will improve.  I hope you will never have to go into the hospital.  Please stay well.  Best Wishes.

AA11366721	This is very common in babies but frustrating, I have 6 children 3 had this problem - try giving your baby about a 1/2 teaspoon of Karo syrup in her milk or juice about 3 times a day - Our doctors have told us this remedy with all our children and it works every time - If they are really hard stool-ed - it will take about 3 days to get everything moving. If they are really struggling they make an infant glycerin suppository you can buy over the counter  in the drug store that is nothing more than oil/glycerin in solid form that the heat from their rectum dissolves and softens the stools for them - you only insert it far enough to where you can't see it any more and hold their legs for a few minutes until they feel the need to push.  Also you should offer a little juice between feedings. All of this helps|`|2724e8c32a9de71dca3f16697d9d6ebbaa	You can pump your milk, put it into a bottle, and put the karo syrup into that.|`|2e853def177f0dc358c1df8eb4484cc5aa	might give 1/2 spoon of  white karo syrup in cereal 1 time daily<br>  they have supositories for babies<br>  carrots should not cause it|`|688c403afa0715767110cfa7a696a616aa	She doesn't like "sour fruit" - that's a problem because those fruits are important to one's defenses against constipation.  Is it that she can't eat it or just doesn't like the taste, as of now?<br>  Karo syrup is something a lot of mothers swear by, but if you don't want to give her that, it just leaves the old standby - baby-size glycerine suppositories.  If she's in pain, I'd definitely give her a suppository - even if she puts up a fuss during the insertion, remember it will help her do a smelly in under 20 minutes!

PTSD can be set off by other things than threats to life, I am no specialist, and this is only my opinion, I don't claim to be a medical person, but based on what I read and what my shrink told me ... along with PTSD I have depression and I get random Panic Attacks ... it's possible but ask your Doctor first, you may be having Panic Attacks when you think about what the bully did out of fear he may do it again, or the affects previous choking caused. I can tell you what my doctor gives me for panic attacks, but I am not a medical professional so I can't nor would I advise you what to do ... there is a fast acting form of Xanax that you place place on your tongue and it dissolves real fast, and to me it seems almost immediately the panic attack and heart rate has come back to normal ... it's called Niravam ... ask your doctor about it, please note I am NOT diagnosing or suggesting what is wrong, only a health care professional can do that ... Good Luck.
rKglGTMIaa	It doesn't sound to me like you'll be getting enough calories if you follow this plan, especially considering the exercise regimen you mentioned. When I wanted to lose weight I ate:<br>  <br>   4 servings of vegetables a day (a serving is usually 1 cup of the raw vegetable or 1/2 a cup of the cooked vegetable), <br>  <br>  3 servings of fruit (usually equal to 1 whole fruit or 6 oz. juice), <br>  <br>  2 starches (1 piece of bread, 1/3 a cup of pasta or rice, 5 crackers etc.),<br>  <br>  2 1/2 servings of protein (6oz. chicken, 4 oz, of beef, 2 eggs, 2 tbsp peanut butter, 6 oz of fish)<br>  <br>  1 serving of dairy (6oz of milk, 2 slices of cheese, 4 oz. of yogurt)<br>  <br>  It sounds like a lot of food, but I broke it up into five small meals a day (breakfast, mid-morning snack, lunch, afternoon snack, and dinner). Doing this prevented me from feeling hungry or deprived. <br>  <br>  I lost SIXTY pounds in about 5 1/2 mos.

With that diet, you won't be losing weight efficiently because you'll be malnourishing your body.

Evidence shows people who eat eggs in the morning eat less throughout the day, because they are very satisfying.  It's important you eat the yolks - all the nutrition is in there and if you don't eat enough fats your body will stop making fat burning enzymes and you will drop muscle instead of fat.<br>  <br>  Also, you should switch to green tea - studies show people dieting lose several pounds more fat drinking green tea (4-5 cups per day).  and drop the splenda - like all artificial sweeteners, it promotes belly fat.<br>  <br>  Finally, you should eat more than three times per day.  Add in 2 more small meals of veggies and protein like salmon or turkey.  Eating often keeps the metabolism high.  You should be able to lose 10 pounds per month which would have you down about 50 lbs in July - good luck!|`|U6C4Bywwaa	Muscle burns fat. Your workouts and beverages and dinner are great! Your breakfast and lunch though, are more like snacks. Protein builds muscle so adding protein to you breakfast and lunch wouldnt do any harm to you in fact it would help you so much more! Keep the apple and/or banana for bfast but add 2 eggs. You can do egg whites if you feel you need to be really strict. Also add a piece of toast. I can see that you have virtually no carbs and its true that eating low carb helps weight loss but the piece of toast at breakfast would give you energy and you will have time throughout te day to burn it off. Add some kind of meat to you lunch or maybe even a salad with fat free dressing. If you dont eat enough your body will store the fod, that is a proven fact. So add to your breakfast and lunch and Im sure you will be looking great by July. Although I dont think you will lose any more than 50 lbs by July, no matter what you do. Good luck!?

These groups are responsible for draining lymphatic fluid from different areas (Regions) in the head and neck.<br>  <br>  The glands on either side of the neck, under the jaw, or behind the ears commonly swell when you have a cold or sore throat.

Treat any minor abrasion you have with some antibiotic ointment. Drink plenty of quality fluids (spring water, green iced tea, aloe juice) and let it drain. I had the same thing, read the above lists of causes and had to add "chest pain" to my symptoms because I practically gave myself a heart attack. If it continues after a few more days or worsens and you cannot attribute it directly to some minor infection you have then make an appointment for blood tests with a good diagnostician (MD). The lumps (3!!!) turned out to be a tiny spider bite on the right side of my head in my scalp. The bite was swollen AND the lymph nodes carrying away the poison were swollen. As you will read, multiple swollen glands can mean cancer, so I freaked out totally, gave up all of my vices, pushed fluids and prayed. Turned out to be that bite, that I didn't even know about with all of my hair, so it was nothing. I promptly reinstated all of my vices. ; )|`|HhECyibGaa	Most likely a cyst.

hxrBaV0Vaa	It is common for the eyes to dry out with any activity that involves extended concentration such as computer use.  Treatment options include the following:<br>  <br>  1) Tear Replacement Therapy (artificial tears).  There are so many brands out there it is difficult to recommend just one.  Some of the better brands include:<br>  <br>     - Blink<br>     - Endura<br>     - Optive<br>     - Refresh<br>     - Soothe (my personal favorite)<br>     - Systane<br>     - Theratears<br>  <br>  Each one is formulated differently so which one works best is hard to determine without first trying it.  <br>  <br>  2) Nutritional Supplements.  There is some evidence that taking Omega-3 fatty acids (such as fish oil or flax seed oil) by mouth can benefit the symptoms of dry eye.  These come in gelcaps and are generally recommended once or twice a day with food.<br>  <br>  3) Prescription medication.  Currently only one medication, Restasis, is approved by the FDA for treatment of dry eye.  This must be used twice a day for at least a month.  It stings, is expensive, and only works in 50% of people who take it.<br>  <br>  3) Punctal plugs.  When someone's eyes are not producing enough tears to keep the eyes lubricated it does not help that tears drain through "puncta" into the nose (this is why you get the sniffles when you cry).  The solution: plug these drainage duct with small silicon plugs.  This can be done by an eye doctor in the office.

Then ther's Job Club, then more interviews - you just have to face the fact that life goes on whether you have good breath or not.<br>  <br>  Think about it, killing yourself over bad breath?  How silly does thast sound?  What do you think you would do if you heard someone else say that?  It's crazy and I think you have more social anxieties than this, perhaps a counsellor would help get to the bottom of it?|`|LGkb4xibaa	have you been tested for all the main problems that cause this? Peridontitis? (probably spelt wrong-sorry) diabetes? Liver conditions? <br>  <br>  Do you floss regularly, clean your teeth twice a day with a new tooth brush(replaced every 3 months)? Use a mouth wash and make sure its made of as many natural ingredients as you can get. Avoid products with alcohol or anything that you find dries your mouth out.<br>  <br>  These can include teas, coffees or caffeine based drinks. Alcohol etc. Also, certain diet will effect it. Avoid things like spicy foods or high in proteins if you can as it effects your blood chemicals etc. See if you can ask your dr or a dietician about what foods you should and shouldnt have.<br>  <br>  Dont smoke- dries your mouth. <br>  <br>  Remember to clean your tongue on a daily basis.<br>  <br>  As for uni- i'd personally go for it. You cant hide from life forever. I know its a self esteem killer, but its your future, so i'd go for it. If however you really cant face it, explain to your parents how much this really is effecting you. If they wont listen ask your doctor or someone else to explain the facts to them. You can study at any time in your life. So if your not secure enough in yourself now, you can do it any time. Or if need really be, study from home or do a sort of open university course.<br>  <br>  Alternatively, see a counsellor to help you come to terms with your problem and to help you get some confidence back.<br>  <br>  Killing yourself over a condition would not be the right thing to do. It would be selfish to those around you who love you. Also, your quality of life is pretty good, even if your feeling like it isnt.<br>  <br>  People have epilepsy, tourettes syndrome, etc and have to have people react REALLY negatively to them on a much larger scale. Yours is bad. But you should still be strong through it and remember there's stacks worse you could have.|`|EQdDkSw0aa	wow 1st of all do not commit suicide...going uni is not the end of the world.

I mean seriously send me some messages soo that we can talk more or leave me your msn!|`|OXxKTM6vaa	Try and explain to them how you feel - if this isn't an option because they do not listen etc then go and see you're GP. I know this may not sound good to you BUT if you're doctor explained to you're parents perhaps they would understand more and actually begin to believe you.|`|QzWHMGHJaa	Most everybody has something wrong with them in one way or another!  Don't kill yourself over bad breath!  Go, and let go and try and enjoy yourself.  Keep a pocket full of mints and do the best you can!  Even if you get known as the guy with bad breath, at least you'll be know!  Don't worry there are people who won't think a thing of it and will like you anyway and who knows, maybe you'll meet someone who can help with the problem!  Don't let this one little thing ruin your life!  I went to school with a girl that had to wear a diaper and always smelled like pee.  We were friends with her anyway because she was a nice person.  Just be honest with people and be yourself and everything will work out for you!  You just have to give it a chance!  Go, go have fun, start your life!

Even if it is late.|`|ZbMLigR3aa	First off, yes you can obviously get pregnant from precum without question.  The fact that you were close to your period may have saved you this time but you are playing russian roulette by not using protection.  The only way to be 100% certain is to wait to see if you miss your period, if you do then take a home pregnancy test.   However, if you choose not to wait, you can opt to get the morning after or plan B (for emergencies only).   If you aren't planning on being a parent anytime soon, get on birth control and have him use a condom.  Make smart choices before that option gets taken away from you.|`|jyOUUqkFaa	its probably fine. give it a couple of days or try plan b if your really worried.|`|272YIuvHaa	if he didn't ejaculate inside you or even around you, you're probably not pregnant. and contrary to popular belief, there is no sperm in precum. Precum can only contain sperm if it picks up sperm from a previous ejaculation on its way out of the penis and that is how people get pregnant from precum. Don't stress about it and if you're really worried, take a pregnancy test if you miss your period, or take Plan B within 72 hours of sexual activity.|`|VV2BZvlLaa	there's a pill its called Plan B its an emergency contraceptive.<br>  <br>  it prevents pregnancy the day after you have unprotected sex or in your case anything etc.<br>  <br>  there's a catch, you have to be 18 yrs old to get it without a prescription if your under 18 you need a doctors prescription<br>  <br>  if you can have someone 18 or over go to Walgreen's rite-aid CVS etc. they just pay & no questions asked they can come home and you can take it<br>  <br>  best of luck! xoxo|`|7Os9oipBaa	The chances of that getting you pregnant are slim to none.

Z8d9ipxmaa	Fat storage places are controlled by hormones, which you can't alter. Some peoples' bodies burn more fat from one area than another, and find it difficult to loose fat from certain places, then are unhealthy when their naturally smaller areas become too thin. You can't do targeted weight loss. <br>  <br>  They only way to loose inches (ie loose body fat) is by cardio exercise, which burns fat. This includes running/jogging, speed walking, swimming or cycling. There's nothing to make cellulite disappear, but looking after your circulation with exercise and dietary iron can improve it over time; once a week we should eat red meat, the darker the more iron rich, because our bodies absorb iron from animal protein more efficiently than iron in plant material - nomatter how much veg you eat. Make your diet rich in unsaturated (omega) fats, which is best from oily fish, 3 servings a week. Also, have enough antioxidants (white tea, dark green veg, red/blue/purple/black fruits). Avoid salt, processed and refined foods, including reformed meat, fast food and white bread/pasta.

I get sore throats 3-5 times a year, and I usually follow the same routine-- I take DayQuil/NyQuil, depending on if I want to fall asleep or not. I drink lots of hot liquids like tea, cocoa, cider, broth, soup. Another thing you might want to try is having honey, whether alone or with a liquid like tea or even water. The honey will act as a lubricant on your throat and make it less painful to swallow or cough. Soft foods only, especially good if they're warm. Mostly you need to rest and give your body time to heal itself.

UZJ7wVc8aa	Getting a nice set of abs is such a misunderstood process. It's actually a lot easier than most people think which is why most people are in a never ending quest to get that perfect six pack - it's because they're doing all the wrong things.<br>  <br>  When you eat more calories than you burn, your body takes those extra calories and stores them as fat somewhere on your body. For some people, the #1 fat storage area is around the thighs and for others it might be around the stomach - it differs from person to person. Sometimes the fat is perfectly distributed around the body so it's not as big of a concern. <br>  <br>  If an excessive amount of fat is stored around your stomach, the reason that you're not seeing your abs is because your body fat percentage is too high. What you need to do is create a calorie deficit (take in less calories than you burn) so that your body is forced to use its fat stores for energy. After a few weeks of doing this, you'll notice that your abs will start to show.<br>  <br>  You first step is to figure out how many calories you burn each day. Use this calculator <a href="http://calorieneedscalculator.com" rel="nofollow">http://calorieneedscalculator.com</a> for an estimate. Now you need to increase the amount of calories you burn by exercising more and decreasing the amount of calories you eat. Cut out junk food such as fast food, candy and sugar. Eat foods that are high in fiber: bread and pasta made from 100% whole wheat, brown rice, oats, fruits and vegetables.<br>  <br>  You shouldn't ignore targeting your abs with sit ups, leg raises and twists but doing hundreds of sit ups won't do anything about the layer of fat that is covering them. Cardio and calorie restriction should be your main focus.

VtDnvmg4aa	Hey!  I used to weigh 198 lbs and my height is only 5'8" - for my height and with that kind of weight I'm really obese!  I tried the "Master cleanse" and other diet recipes, and I even watched Richard Simmons videos but they didn't helped me at all!<br>  <br>  I tried going to a gym with a strict diet once and within a week later, I stopped going to gym and started eating more than before.  It brought me back to where I started again.  I am sure you happen to experience it like me.<br>  <br>  The strange thing is.. I tried having low fat diet, eating low carbs, starve at times, follow diet programs and so on but it just didn't help!<br>  <br>  Then one day, an old friend of mine who used to be obese saw me.  She teased at me at first and I felt embarassed about it and she told me her secret on how she lost her weight.  She gave me a book entitled "Strip That Fat" - within a month I lost 18.3 lbs!<br>  <br>  I seriously recommend and urge you to learn more about this since it has helped me a lot - it demystifies false beliefs like low fat diet, eating low carbs and such help you!  <br>  <br>  Learn the real truth:<br>  www.Strip-That-Fat.tk|`|46StihsPaa	Try this diet:<br>  day 1: Fruits only<br>  day 2: Veggies only<br>  day 3: Fruits and veggies<br>  day 4: bananas and milk only<br>  day 5: brown rice and chick peas<br>  day 6: red salted meat<br>  day 7: ANYTHING<br>  <br>  Drink lots of water 10 glasses min. exercise will also help.

Also, don't try anything stupid like starving yourself and laxatives.|`|RJdWIHR7aa	You can water fast for a week which means eating and drinking nothing but water. you will definitely lose 10lbs in a week but you have to look up on google how to come off it so you don't put it all back on again. :)|`|SHXvlBENaa	NO don't listen to them it totally IS possible! I should know i've done it myself. Ok so, you need to do a water fast but you need to know how to do it properly, i wont type everything out because there is to much to tell you you need to search it on google of how to do it THE RIGHT WAY and how to come off of the diet otherwise you will put all the weight back on, seriously it makes you feel great afterward and your body feels cleansed and rid of toxins, even if it is for one week.<br>  I tried it for a week and felt so great that i decided to carry on with it for a month :D It amazing how little the body really needs! i lost so much weight, you tend to lose about 1 pound a day (in a week that's half a stone!) on the water fast and i highly recommend to anyone :)<br>  <br>  Good luck! :)|`|WxoZrTPlaa	Sorry, sweetheart.  It's just not possible.  If you really work hard, you might be able to lose 10 pounds in a month, but if you're not overweight, you shouldn't lose anything.

In 04 I had to get back surgery for a herniated disc.  Nearly 2 years after surgery I STILL had painful and crippling sciatica, weak legs and pain.  A friend of mine turned me on to inversion therapy and I have been hanging upside down ever since.  what I've learned through treating with inversion therapy is that although we feel pain in  our backs, the pain really originates in the core, stomach or ab muscles.  As I inverted I felt my abs start to loosen as the spasms were stretched away.  As my abs relaxed they loosened their grip on my hip muscles, thighs and of course my back muscles.  Once these muscles were also relaxed my lower back and pelvis were free to go back into alignment and as they did my sciatica disappeared.  I have been virtually pain free for 3 years now because of inversion therapy and I want the world to know!  Inversion therapy has literally saved my life.  Do some research yourself and see if you think inversion therapy can help you as it did me.  All my best, feel better!!!

Track these events on a calendar and see what you find.<br>  <br>  There isn't anything wrong with you, in my opinion.|`|O4KBKZEkaa	There is a theory that sometimes as our brain is slowing down it gets confused and thinks it is dying so it pops in to wake us up. I don't know if it is true or not but whatever. It is so common it happens to everyone at some point in their lives. Doesn't mean the sky is falling. You're fine. Just ask your doctor the next time you see him/her. Now if there are any other troublesome symptoms involved make an appointment to see someone but just jumping yourself awake? Relax, it's normal.|`|Txg9UpBOaa	i dont noe why but i thinkits normall it happends to me all the time hahahaha its pretty helarious|`|c1i7Mn1Baa	Don't worry its very normal.

Q7WQ5YEeaa	keep putting warm, damp towels on it. if you think you can, then get some salt water (not too much salt) and put it on the sty. if the salt water gets into your eye it will be painful for a short period of time, but the salt water makes the sty smaller in size and less painful (and also less ugly). i had a sty yesterday, and i put some salt water on it, and now today i cant even see it and it feels like there is nothing there.|`|aWcD7Ou5aa	They have a cream at the drugstore called Stye, it helps clear them up and you don't need a prescription.|`|AldxcKwnaa	Keep using the washcloth. warm with pressure. If it doesn't go away there are prescription meds that you can take.
MJR4Om7taa	Pin it back against the elastic of your boxer shorts, no one'll notice then<br>  <br>  (As in, it’d be pointing straight up and your elastic will be holding it back keeping it flat to your body)|`|2SSD6BP9aa	All you can do is ignore it and wait for it to go away.<br>  <br>  There is only one way to cut down on erections at school.  If you masturbate in the morning before school, you will be less likely to get erections for the rest of the day.  It doesn't mean it will never happen, but it will happen a lot less.<br>  <br>  Other than that ... they say when you get older they happen less.  But at 16 I haven't reached that point yet!|`|yQdA5rHnaa	don't stand up|`|nhLvrVx9aa	Just stick your hand in your pocket and move it so its completely up and down.<br>  Maybe tuck it in the waist band of your underwear.<br>  That way if you stand up, its not poking someones eye out.<br>  Nothing you can really do about it, it's going to happen.<br>  Were guys lol!|`|tjTbkxkzaa	everone gets them at inopportune times.

AA11207703	Take Pepto-Bismol, it should help with stomach cramps. Kaopectake is great for diahrea. Drink Gatorade to bring your electrolytes to where they should be.

pwUy6ACCaa	No, your body is used to the hormones that yaz gives you daily and if you skip the white pills your body will get confused and start by itself.

ft8t98Pnaa	hahahahaha weed is def waaaay healthier than cigs... never in history has anyone died from smoking weed or gotten cancer... or gotten addicted... ... millions of people die a year from cigs. <br>  <br>  <br>  the first time I smoked I was 13 and I still do....Yes you do get high the first time you smoke.... I dont know who told you you get sick..|`|c815f0954f0cc607a22f3e49bfd31b48aa	Inhaling smoke is never healthy but cigarettes have a lot of toxic chemicals that marijuana does not have. If marijuana becomes legal, they will probably poison it and sell it just like cigarettes. I'd say if you really cared about being healthy, you'd be exercising rather than smoking. 13? How sad. That's way too young to be a burn out.|`|xq2J2LMSaa	On a per-cigarette basis, cigarettes are "healthier" than weed due to the filter. BUT, you don't tend to smoke a "pack of joints" a day. Not to mention, in weed, there aren't all the additives and preservatives found in cigarettes. And then there are the addictive properties of nicotine--more addictive than crack!<br>  So really, for the amount of weed that a casual smoker would inhale versus that of the casual cigarette smoker, weed is healthier.|`|7Os9oipBaa	With that last part on there, that's not true. It depends on the person.<br>  <br>  Marijuana and Tobacco effect different parts of the body. Both are absorbed through the lungs, and no matter what you're inhaling, smoke will never be an okay thing when it comes to the insides of your lungs.<br>             I've studied this a lot, and apparently when you smoke weed from a young age for a long period of time it can actually start to eat away at your brain. I would google it.|`|6GqTCmYLaa	No it is not smoking cigarettes are worse than smoking anything else|`|8SKpsVG7aa	Theres way more chemicals in a cheeseburger than there are in marijuana.|`|bZZEIjmFaa	It depends, Most people who smoke weed usually hold in a hit as long as they can so they can achieve maximum amount of THC in one hit. This is allows more smoke into the lungs and causes more health problems, however if you smoke pot out of a vaporizer then it is far more healthily than smoking a joint or a cigarette.|`|3iUE9lGVaa	smoking weed is better than cigs.

AA10561400	your average|`|C8Djjxqkaa	A little finger is big enough to make your girlfriend orgasm. You just need to know what do with it. You are plenty big enough.|`|7PbJWEo1aa	Its what you do with it that counts!|`|vl0HWTDJaa	The average depth of a vagina is only 5 and a half inches anyway so anything more than that doesn't make a difference. But orgasms are very rarely caused by anything that would be affected by length of the penis. Usually it's either through the g-spot (which isn't that high up) or by the clitoris getting stimulated when you thrust so yu won't have any problems to do with size (which is abut average anyway). Don't expect you're girlfriend to orgasm though, it's different for all women but it's hard to find any that will orgasm easily every time so don't think there's something wrong with you if she doesn't.|`|g8qHXXxtaa	Ignore all the "6 is average" because its not. <br>  <br>  Its fact for age 15 your around average.<br>  <br>  Do not worry, to be honest, i doubt she would care. She'd care that her boyfriend is having sex which is a big thing to most people.<br>  <br>  My penis was 5.9inches at your age exactly! And when i had sex with my girlfriend i would push hard and it hurt her because i was big to her because her cervix wasn't as big.<br>  <br>  Some girls cervix's are bigger, some smaller, ur fine!|`|tjTbkxkzaa	That's normal.  See the link below.  The average size for white college male is 6.16".  You'll do fine and please all the women you need to.|`|MJR4Om7taa	Yes, great. The average woman is about 4 to 5 inches deep, the 3 main stimuli are her clit, her G-spot and the very back of her vagina, if you are smaller then 4 inches you will never reach the back, if you are a lot bigger your body will be pushed too far away from her to stimulate her clit because of the angle you end up in. 4 to 5 inches itself will leave your body at such a high angle when you are hitting the back spot that you will miss the clit. About 5 to 6 inches is optimum for hitting both those stimulus. Then if you do it reverse cowgirl with her leaning back you can hit all 3. Sorted!<br>  <br>  The idea that bigger cocks are better is a load of crap by people who don't understand the anatomy of sex; leaving a lot of dis-satisfied women LOL! You have a good cock size. I unfortunately am a lot larger but then... I've found other ways round that problem ;-)<br>  <br>  That alone wont deffinatly make her orgasm though, learn good foreplay and oral, and most all, have fun :-)<br>  <br>  As for growth, you usually stop around 18ish but everyone’s different, Like I said, you're just right so don't think about it, you'll stress yourself out and that hampers performance and you wont like it. <br>  <br>  Relax man, chill out and let the good times roll :-)|`|QkGLEMklaa	this is actually above average, so don't worry. Puberty starts at different times for everyone, so there's plenty of time.  And 6 inches is NOT the average for a 15 year old.

A yeast infection generally doesn't have an odor.  Odor is usually caused by bacterial infections, for which you would need a prescription for antibiotics.  <br>  <br>  Bacterial vaginosis is the most common non-yeast vaginal infection, with the more severe cases causing dark discharge, odor, itching, burning urination, and havey discharge.|`|AA11103254	If you've had your period within the last week, the brown discharge could be old blood coming out.

It's impossible to accurately diagnose without physically being there.|`|q8Q1CkAaaa	I don't have these symptoms, but I have had relatives that have had spasms of the esophegas....You may be feeling discomfort in your chest due to the anxiety of not knowing what is with your throat. If I were you I would go to a Throat,Nose and Ear doctor.  Seriuously, this condition is called esophageal spasm . <br>   The esophagus is a muscular tube that actively transports food from the throat to the stomach by rhythmic contractions known as peristalsis. The actual mechanism and anatomy are quite complex, involving three distinct segments and allowing a person to swallow even when upside-down. Diffuse esophageal spasm describes a condition where the entire esophagus is spastic—along its entire length, the muscular activity is increased and uncoordinated. The name corkscrew esophagus describes perfectly the appearance of this disorder on x rays.<br>  X rays may reveal a slightly different appearance and result in the designation rosary bead esophagus, but the cause is still diffuse spasm, and the two entities behave in the same way<br>  <br>  The cause appears to be disruption of the complex system of nerves that coordinates the muscular activity. The result is difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) and pain that feels like a heart attack and can involve the entire chest, jaw, and arms.
zEy0uuAFaa	Tensing up your muscles can be one of the enjoyable sensations of masturbating, but you can get enjoyment when these muscles are more relaxed too.  Give yourself a rest part of the time, if you're masturbating for a while.  Also know that your climax is a relaxation response.  If you're too tensed up, you can block your climax when you don't want to.<br>  <br>  Beyond, that there is no "right" way to masturbate as long as you enjoy it and are not injuring yourself.

zEy0uuAFaa	What do you mean by "let go" - do you mean you stop touching yourself because the feeling is too intense?  Yes, many guys do that sometimes - either because the feeling is too strong, or they want to make it last longer.  Sometimes you can switch off, touching other parts of your body and then returning to your penis.  This gets your whole body involved for a more pleasurable experience, and will help you learn what kind of touching you enjoy.<br>  <br>  If by "let go" you mean some kind of release or getting carried away with your reactions, that means you're nearing or having an orgasm.  If you're young, you might have an orgasm without ejaculating.  (Ejaculating is when semen comes out of your penis.)  This is normal for young boys, and your ejaculations will start when your body starts making the fluids that make up your semen.|`|NpKGQFvTaa	Before you "***" you will get a reit nice feeling at the bottom of your penis.

nAp688tZaa	Hydrocodone has not been associated with the absence or delay of the menstrual cycle.  Your body just may not be ready to start the cycle and you should not be concerned.  If you go more than two cycles without having one, you should see your OB/GYN and make sure there is not another issue that is causing the absence of your cycle.  If there are no problems found, there is a drug call medroxy Progesterone that is taken for 10 days and this will cause you to have a cycle.  Be prepared for a cycle that is longer than normal.  The medication can also make you VERY sick to your stomach, so make sure that you always take it with food.  If that is still not enough to keep you from vomiting, then you can call your doc and ask for some Compazine to keep the medication down.  You may also experience some mood swings and hot flashes while taking the medication and these are very common and normal side effects.  Good luck.

This is not a stupid question.  It can happen to anyone.  There is a possibility your girlfriend is pregnant, so it would be good to check.  Luck will probably be on your side, but you should always make sure.  I had a scare like this at a young age and I fessed up to my mother and we went to the doctor.  My doctor provided me with a morning after pill and I went in later for a blood test and was not pregnant.  The sperm probably did not make it inside of her, but if you are worried, have her go to the doctor or Planned Parenthood.  And from then on, just make sure to be careful and use protection :)|`|cervQlVzaa	I hope not.

TKNPveHDaa	First, calm down.  Your body fluctuates in weight every day 4-5 pounds.  Even if you weigh yourself at the same time every day, you can see differences that are not long term, but small changes.    I suggest this:  Don't weigh yourself every day.  Do it once a week.    Here's another tip:  More weight doesn't mean you got fatter or more out of shape.  Gaining weight may mean that you are drinking more water because you're more thirsty.  Water weighs a ton, so you could be well-hydrated.  As long as your dress sizes slowly come down and you feel better about yourself, IGNORE the numbers on the scale.  They don't accurately measure what's happening with your body.    Good luck!|`|YurdkgLwaa	You are gaining muscle mass.  muscle weighs more than fat you see,  when i started to work out more i gained a pound, but after a while it fell of :)    dont worry about it to much, just keep on eating healthy & exercising regular, you'll soon see the difference|`|BLmfR6Ezaa	From what i know, the extra weight is muscles, because that's happening to me too!|`|KolRRS6yaa	--Drink 2-3 litres of water a day to speed up Fat loss--    Your body stores water when it isn't getting a constant supply.    --Get RID of ALL unhealthy snacks in your home!--    --High Carbohydrate foods late at night foods turn to fat--    Foods such as Bread, rice, potatoes, cereal etc. Are all high carbohydrate foods. This concerns us because foods high in Carbs are also high in energy and if there is surplus energy provided from eating Carbs it settles as Fat in our bodies. This holds true particularly late night before sleep and during sleep as we are usually inactive at this time.    --Never miss meals, its doesnt help fat loss!--    This has to be one of the biggest misconceptions amongst those who are new to losing weight. Missing meals or Crash Dieting as it is called is in the long-run a totally ineffective and unsafe means of losing weight.    --4-5 meals per day--    3-4-5 meals per day as oppose to 1-2 large meals to add to the thermic effect that our body encounter when digesting food.    --30mins to an hour of Low to Moderate Exercise--    This hits the fat burning zone    --Protein in all meals for thermic effect--    Hope this Helps!

YdpcvT4saa	Hey i've got the perfect thing for you... It's called FOOD!|`|oojO4WAraa	Food.  You could try Ensure or some other protein drink.  Mostly, you just need more calories.  Kashi makes good protein bar snacks.  You should eat 3 meals a day, and 3 snacks a day and a bed time snack.  An Ensure or Kashi Protein bar would be a good snack with a glass of milk and a piece of fruit.  Also, eat at least one high calories snack a day - like ice cream, a candy bar, etc.  Drink a soda during the day, and eat stuff like pizza occasionally.    Gaining weight takes time.  Count calories and eat at least 2,000 a day, more if you can.   Good luck.|`|It8fhHLuaa	How old are you 1st?

BG8vMyZjaa	From the site listed below:-    "When Alli, an over-the-counter anti-obesity, weight-loss pill, was launched last year in the US, it sold out in days. Not yet available in the UK, more and more Brits are getting supplies of the fat blocker, said to boost a dieter's efforts by 50 per cent, via the internet or by buying the pills in America.    Alli works by using a drug called Xenical. Its primary ingredient is orlistat, and it diminishes your body's capacity to process fat. It inhibits an enzyme in the pancreas - take that, enzyme! - so about 25 per cent of the fat that would go on your thighs, chin, stomach, eyeballs and teeth comes out of your **** instead. There is a lot of whingeing about this on the internet. The pill-chomping fatties complain about 'side effects'. They apparently get 'loose stools', gas, and even incontinence".

FsFi6PQhaa	I tore my ACL (actually it blew up instead of tearing completely), MCL and both cartilage plates. Swelling and pain will go down but will not go away till she has surgery. She will not be able to walk the same until the ACL is repaired.    Here is a list of my recommendations:    1: Have her stay off her feet unless directed otherwise her doctor.    2: Get a orthopedic doctor/surgeon who specializes in knee/joint injuries.    3: Get her to have surgery. They will take the two ends of her torn acl and reconnect them with either a donor tissue or her own hamstring tissue.    4: If on feet, do not bend over to pick something up, her knee WILL give out on her. (when i was injured, i bent over to pick something up and my knee gave out on me).    5: Have her use the crutches.    6: have her avoid any physical activities.    After she has surgery. make sure she rehabs correctly. If she follows the physical therapists instructions, she will heal. Her knee could be the same before her injury if she has surgery and rehabs.|`|EMNwWAuvaa	Towson, here is what I think.  The ACL has an important function that is often overlooked by many.  The ligament has two main functions and they are: to stop the tibia from moving forward on the femur, that is what happened in your daughter's case, and the other is to keep the femoral condyles firmly against the knee meniscus.  Now if you don't get the repair done then there is going to be a good chance that the meniscus of the knee will start to break down.  That will lead to cracking and fraying of the meniscus.  Why is that important?  Well underneath that is the cartilage of the knee.  So when the meniscus is injured this becomes exposed to stresses it was not designed to withstand and that will lead to an early arthritis.  That in turn will lead to the possibility of an early need for a total knee replacement.  So while your daughter is only twenty-five this could have a major impact on her down the road.  The swelling and a lot of the pain will eventually subside.  She will be able to walk without any assistive devices but the knee will not be fully straight.  They are going to offer her two choices if she decides to go forward with the procedure.  One is to autograft, that is self donate a tendon to form the new ligament.  This usually comes from the hamstrings.  I for one don't like this for one of the problems particularly in women is that the hamstrings are too weak to start with and this is one of the reasons for the tear in the ACL in the first place.  So you are now going to make the hamstrings weaker by taking a piece of them to make a new ligament.  The other option is to use a cadaver graft.  They have been sterilized many times and they are safe.  There is no rejection problem and they will hold up just as well as any other graft.  There is no weakness created in the hamstrings that is not there presently.  So she should get a referral to a physical therapist now to help reduce the swelling and improve the mobility and strength of the knee with a special emphysis on the hamstrings.  Talk over these things with the orthopedist and let them tell you what they think and then make up your own mind.|`|B9HAwykOaa	dear  if you are an athlete or your occupation requires good knees to work  like construction.. you will need a surgery to correct the problem  on the other hand, it should be ok after 8-12 weeks without surgery  but u should avoid strenuous activity, and had the brace on  good luck
OF17tgNHaa	I don't think you should continue with this procedure. It dangerous. Your body works best when its temperature is about 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit (37 degrees Celsius).When your body gets hotter than that, your brain doesn't like it - it wants your body to stay cool and comfortable. So you sweat. Most people sweat most from their armpits most. I don't think you should do this at all but, who am i to say. Hope all goes well. Best of luck.|`|ChSrd2ftaa	It is not advised to get such operations done. Sweating releases the toxins and heat from our body. This is very important for normal functioning of the body.  This is the first time I came across such case wherein the sweat glands are to be removed. I believe, onw sweats the most on the underarm area and it is a major part of one's well being.  If sweating bothers you so much, you can opt for other methods to curb this.|`|Vhq3GURQaa	Hon, I hope you are having this surgery because you really have no other option. Good luck.
c23b658ab35a3e3b168534baf3d6f942aa	If they have not helped any then you need to go back to your dr. they might not be strong enough to kill the infection. Stopping them half way is not going to benefit you, also it will make the bacteria stronger that is why there are so many super infections out there and why so many people are on any different antibiotics these bacteria build of a resistance to these drugs. I would go back to your DR. and let him know they are not helping so you can get something else that can take care of this bacteria since it might have the resistance to the drug the dr. gave you. Ask for a z-pack it is a 5 day course of antibiotics that last 6-10 days in your system works great.|`|PaOMUfC9aa	Dont stop the antibiotics! continue taking them!

So yeh id say finish them out.|`|AA10352420	Some times the anti biotic takes a bit longer time to start working to improve your condition Now that you have taken for 4 days there is no harm in stopping them and see how you feel.If you are getting worse then you should change the antibiotics/see the doctor|`|ezMoS0mqaa	Don't stop the course- it's people doing that that has lead to superbugs- the bacteria are not all killed and so some live on and develop resistance.  If you think they aren't working, go and see your doctor but keep taking them, It won't do you any harm to carry on.|`|MOCBWQHhaa	An antibiotic prescription usually runs for ten days so if you've taken it for four days there hasn't been enough time to cure any of your symptoms.

It will probably help with your bad cough as that is probably a secondary infection caused by bacteria.|`|f89f116400d4ff9b53b246c33e1753cdaa	Not uncommon for the antibiotics to have no apparent effect until near the end of the course - keep taking to the end!!!|`|3dbfb1686ea2a2772f3e03d47af16d08aa	yes finish the course, could have both viral and bacteria|`|z8O3HxZaaa	it would be safer just to finish the course and see your doctor after|`|L4rlu2BDaa	usually you need to take the whole course of antibiotics to see the affects, there not like a painkiller where the effects are ongoing and pretty quick. Antibiotics clear the problem rather then just masking the symptoms. You need to Take the whole course for them to work properly.

Okay, so if you want to lose some weight in 3 weeks for your own personal reasons here are some steps I would take;    Drink Water!: Drink 2 litres per day. This will help you to shed water weight that your body stores for vital bodily functions. As a result, you will see inches coming of your legs, hip, mid-riff etc.     Eat protein: Protein such as chicken breasts, fish, eggs, meat etc. can increase the bodies thermic effect as your body works harder to digest these foods. Result increased fat loss.    4-5 meals per day: This is better than 1-2 big meals as It increases the work your body has to do to digest the food. Result increased fat loss.    Exercise 3-4 times per week: A light to moderate power walk for a half a hour consistently.    DO NOT MISS MEALS!: This is SOO important as young peoples biggest misconception is that eatting less or nothing at all will help me lose weight. I won't go into detail but trust me stick to your 4-5 meals per day with protein with every meal.

What you have to do is know the serving and calories you eat then record it in a book and when the day is over count the total which should be around 1600. Breakfast, lunch and dinner should be 400. Snacks are 200. You should be losing about 1-2 pounds a week. My mom did the same thing and she looks great. It works for everyone. Plus it's healthy.

4kM6ei3haa	Depends on how much time you have.  I'm doing a 40 minute weight lifting routine right now and then finishing with 20 mins for running and/or hitting the heavy bag. Hitting the bag is a great finish, if you have access to one. It does cardio and builds muscle.   Just pick two body parts a day. i.e.  chest/triceps, back/biceps, legs/shoulders.  That's Fri., Sat., Sun.  Finish with 20 mins cardio. Superset all your lifting. Take shorter breaks. i.e. do a chest exercise, then right to tricep excercise. This will help you get more done and it's really affective. I love it. You have all week to rest.
oojO4WAraa	Yes, you would have noticed it by now.  If, by chance, it is in there and you haven't noticed it, it will begin to smell really bad.    I worked in a doctors office with a girl who left one in for about 3 weeks (how could she NOT notice).  Anyway, she complained of a smelly discharge, went to the doctor, and the doctor pulled out the tampon.  Leaving it in for 3 weeks didn't make her sick or anything.  I can't think that is good for you.|`|Nu6vDwLtaa	u should know.  im not sure how far it could go, but it wouldnt harm to have a probe around in private to put ur fears to rest.  i know im a guy answering this, sorry if it isnt acceptable and im not supposed to answer.|`|lLC7Cf2zaa	Well, you apparently haven't had any kids yet because if you had you'd be able to put your hand up there and feel about.

But after having kids I can't use them anymore anyway because they don't stay in.|`|JBLcMQ9haa	That is right.

Once when I was drunk, I had sex with a tampon in.. The guy didn't seem to notice but I'm sure he was further anhebriated than I was.. Anyway, if it's pushed that far up you're going to feel it. When it gets "full" you'll start to cramp and feel awkward in certain positions. And when you had sex, you would have felt uncomfortable, and he would have as well.    The best I can tell you, if you want to be reassured, is to go up there and look for it. Sorry to be blunt, lol.. Hope it's one with a cord.. If you can't find it and are still worried, call your gyno. You could also try squeezing your muscles and see if you feel anything.
db4f3af56110c43657d0e21df27b793daa	I had a tooth pulled 5 weeks ago, and it took several days for the bad pain to go away, and the hole is still tender and healing.  I found that taking 600-800 mg of Ibuprofen every 6 hours really helped reduce the imflammation, in turn making the pain less severe, so try that in addition to your prescription painkillers. I would think that if by the 3rd or 4th day, you should notice some improvement--if the pain is worsening instead, you possibly could have loosened your blood clot and caused dry socket.|`|AA10811674	It should be getting better, are you rinsing with warm salt water?

856f9f629e121d326752210489850fd9aa	Depression - caused by chemical imbalances of serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine and other important neurotranmitters in the brain which balance emotions is a serious issue. Psychologists state that depression is a unhealthy state which we 'can' work through in order to experience greater levels of happiness. Some who daily experience deep chronic depression may require both prescribed medication along with 'Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy {M.B.C.T.') provided by Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapists and there are some who experience chronic-but not deeply chronic depression who work well with M.B.C.T. alone. Dr Jon Kabat-Zinn PhD, along with Psychologists Mark Williams, John Teasdale, and Zindel Segal have authored an Excellent self-help book called: "The Mindful Way through Depression: Freeing Yourself from Chronic Unhappiness". Mindfulness, a simple yet powerful way of paying attention to your most difficult emotions and life experiences, can help you break the cycle of chronic unhappiness once and for all, that you may experience greater levels of happiness. In 'The Mindful Way through Depression', it is explained why our usual attempts to "think" our way out of a bad mood or "just snap out of it" leads us deeper into the downward spiral of depression. Through very insightful lessons-drawn from both Mindfulness and Cognitive Therapy - Dr Jon Kabat-Zinn PhD and Psychologists- Mark Williams, John Teasdale, and Zindel Segal demonstrate how to sidestep the negative habits that lead to unhappiness and despair, including self-blame and rumination so you can effectively face life's challenges with much resilience.|`|67NqWxuGaa	because the chemistry of the brain actually changes making it harder to cure.... that is supposedly why they give antidepressants which go to the brain chemistry to help rebuild the seratonin...     they work on some people, and on others they have the oopposite effect, increasing the depression  by increasing the chemicals in the brain that cause more depression.....<br>  you can check out a free alternative at www.emofree.com, change ones diet, and get exercise can help with depression also|`|a6rvseCxaa	Because it can be.|`|WuskPQ6Qaa	Because it hits at all core roots of you mentally, emotionally & spiritually it hits the core root of these elements which makes you whole & if your being drained of the essence then you'll be lazy & feel as though life is pointless|`|1oBilGHuaa	While we are depressed our perception about the world and our lives are<br>  affected.

They're things like the clean and jerk, the power clean, clean and snatch, stuff like that. NOT deadlift, military press, bench press, and squat. Those are power lifts. <br>  <br>  You need to eat well to build the muscle as well. People keep talking about high protein, but neglect to tell you how many carbs...about double the amount as the protein is what you'll need to take in. Eat 5-6 times a day, and consume lean protein and natural carbs at each meal. <br>  <br>  Figure out an Olympic lift routine that works for you, but don't take two days off in a row, no matter what you choose.|`|0AYPgUQIaa	If you have hundreds of thousands of dollars, then you will have faster results with quality steroids(and major side effects), but it doesn't mean that you just sit back and do nothing, you still have to hit the gym 3-4 times a week or more.<br>  For some reason people think that if they take steroids, the muscles will build themselves.<br>  I suggest against taking steroids, so you have to be patient.<br>  Consult with a professional bodybuilder who will tell you what training you will need for best results.<br>  Get your wallet ready though!|`|Lkj7HxAwaa	The muscle protein drinks, and hit the gym like 5 days a week, watch your diet, get a personal fitness trainer and whenever you are in the gym,work out like their is no tomorrow.|`|OleVPkJgaa	umm...well there's steroids? <br>  or else you just have to be patient. go to the gym. get a personal trainer. work out multiple times a week. or maybe join a sports' team.
YZez6mheaa	Ok so the working out is a bad way to lose weight, you wanna know why? Becuase you do lose body fat as you work out, but that body fat turns into muscle. And muscle weighs more than fat, so as you work out it is true you arent losing wieght, but you are actually building up muscle.   Example: you have a lot of belly fat, you go work out at the gym, so the belly fat turns into a six pack|`|lymCWLcaaa	muscle weighs more than fat..ur toning up and therefore ur turning ur fat into muscle so u may gain a pound or two before u loose weight!!  it sometimes happens to me..or if i havent been excercising i dont gain weight but my clothes get tighter.. u may have noticed it too sometimes.    increase water intake and jog once or twice a week too, those dvds can be quite boeing after awhile!!  hope i helped....oh and by the way u wen u gain muscle by these workouts despite what somepeople u get smaller...start measuring urself to track ur progress!!|`|BgTfNS5Eaa	The reason your not losing weight can be because you are not burning more calories than you eat... A regular diet is about 2000 calories per day, so if your eating 2000 calories per day and then do your work out dvd  and only burn 1500 calories from your exercise then you can possibly gain weight because u still have that extra 500 calories that you didnt burn. SO if you do your exercise dvd and burn 2000 calories then its likely your weight would remain the same. But if your burn 2500 calories and your eating 2000 per day then you will lose wight for sure...  My advice to you is to only eat 1500 calories per day and burn off 2500! You will lose rapid weight per week..     I only have 350 calories per day and burned 1500 and i lost 9 pounds in 5 days but i do not recommend that because its not healthy.. I only did that because i had a TV commercial to do.      Just watch what you eat. and know how many calories you need to burn    Burn up to 450 calories walking or 550 calories running on a treadmill|`|h7iZEhTGaa	Diet is just as important as the exercises.  If your diet is poor you will not lose weight.  If you are still gaining or just maintaining weight then you are consuming more calories than you are burning.  It's simple math.  One way to get a handle on your consumption is to keep a journal of your daily food intake.  It's a bit tedious but it does work.  You'll be surprised to find out which foods are undermining your efforts.  For most people the culprit is sugar.  Once you get a handle on your daily caloric intake you can adjust it up or down to suit your goals.  If you are consuming 2700 calories per day and still gaining weight then adjust down to 2500 or so until you strike a balance, etc, etc.  Avoid pre-packaged diet foods and stick with lean meats, whole fruits and vegetables.  Drink water regularly.  Stop drinking sodas altogether.  Do not allow yourself to be hungry as this will slow your metabolism and undermine your workouts.  The key to weight loss is a good food supply of nutrient dense whole foods with regular exercise.  You might want to incorporate some light weight training into your workouts.  Weight training will burn calories like wild.  A good calorie counting website is: http://www.calorieking.com/foods/  Good luck!|`|CHCPnvksaa	It's pretty normal to notice yourself getting small but not losing any weight. You should take your body measurements in addition to weighing yourself. What's happening is that you're losing fat but gaining muscle that has the same weight, but less mass. If you want to jump start your weight loss, try cutting out carbs. Proteins and veggies only, no sugars, fruits, breads, pasta, etc. I did that, I ate till I was full and  with minimal exercise and dropped 12 pounds in 2 weeks.|`|zhk8o514aa	Its quite possible that you are building muscles.  After all the scale can not tell the difference between muscles and fat.     One way is to keep track how big your waste, thighs, arms  buy using a tape measure.   Keep a track of it every week.  With hope you will see your self slimming down!|`|AN9PdKmgaa	actually your building muscle you need to cut down a little on carbs and eat more protein also muscle weighs more than fat|`|GLEGh4N0aa	you want to leave a day between each workout to give your body a chance to adjust. and it depends what type of excersise your doing. most excersise builds muscle and doesnt neccisarily burn fat. just simply walking burns fat. and muscle weighs more than fat so weight can't really tell you anything! measure yourself inches are more accurate :)|`|ebuxHnScaa	It's this simple: You exercise, you eat right, you lose a little weight because your fat cells shrink. But then you reach a point where to lose more weight, your fat cells need to die.    Your dying fat cells secrete all kinds of hormones, screaming "save us". Suddenly, you feel hungry. You're losing weight, so you feel like you deserve to cheat a little bit, but instead you cheat a *lot*. You eat and eat and eat because you keep feeling hungry. What the heck, you think, it's only one day.    Now, your fat cells are all plumped up. You go back to being good, you exercise, eat right, lose weight, until your fat cells shrink, and you start the cycle over.    The "some days not as healthy as it could be" is the giveaway. You are yo-yo dieting, eating right and losing weight, then cheating and gaining it back, then starting over. That's the worst thing you can do to yourself.    Keep eating healthy and watching what you eat until you lose *all* the weight you need to eat. If you feel like cheating every once in a while, fine. But you *cannot* have a binge day -- ever. If you plump up your fat cells every time they shrink, you will *never* lose any more than a small amount of weight,|`|0YyHulMQaa	Several possible reasons.  Firstly, some resistance exercise develops muscle which weighs more than fat. You can stay the same weight but appear leaner in this instance. Plus if you are not really over weight anyway, there is probably limited fat to loose, so whilst you will loose some, the muscle will weigh more keeping you a similar weight. Second possibility is you are eating more and so cancelling out the calories you burn during exercise. Remember it's a simple equation, eat more than you burn and you put on weight, eat less and you loose it.    Going 1-2 stone under equilibrium weight is possible, but not really healthy - expect to feel hungry quite often if you want to achieve this. The best exercise for weight loss is repetitive and low resistance so probably running where muscles generally don't get bigger, they just get fitter.|`|O2SIJqHXaa	start running and cut out the junk food|`|8ab6993234808864c73a8260c98e510aaa	are you going strictly by the numbers on the scale?    if you're gaining muscle and losing fat, then your weight might very well go up a little.... muscle is much more dense, and therefore heavier than fat...    so don't go by numbers on a scale, go by how your clothes fit to judge your progress|`|KolRRS6yaa	2 Stone is very achievable for July but you need a very sensible Diet. Fill out Body2Shape's Weight Loss Diet Menu and I will equip you with a Free & Personalized Diet so that you can lose weight Fast and Effectively.|`|Z3pQ0Teuaa	There is possibility you are gaining muscle. That can happen...be sure to take your measurements. The scale lies sometimes but measurements do not :)     Also drink plentyyyyy of water to get rid of any water retention you could be experiencing from starting the workouts and be sure you're not right around that time of the month :) I totally thought I was gaining from working out and turns out I was just bloating. LOL    Good Luck and good for you for working on you!|`|o1KWtGzLaa	Are you counting your calorie intake per day and how much you're losing? You're probably taking in an even amount of what you're losing still if not just a little under. But, I think most of all you're just gaining in muscle mass. You don't have to be huge to do that. Muscle ways way more than fat, if you gain even a tiny bit from exercising in any way, there's your explanation.    Try flexing your muscles in legs and arms afterwards, your lower part of your body can gain a lot of muscle easily so give it a go every night, to make sure if they're increasing by becoming even a little harder every day.|`|4owUg43oaa	I'd need more information to fully answer your question, but to lose weight you have to do enough exercise in a fat-burning range to actually take off calories.  That means as a rule of thumb you need to sweat for about an hour for the workout to be effective.  Also keep in mind that if you  are over forty and a woman it is unfortunately harder to lose weight.  Good luck on your efforts!|`|f00589104255977086e57a356d925224aa	Knock the exercise up a gear?|`|yQRAbHLgaa	Your probably eating the same or more amount of calories that you are losing. Try eating a calorie controlled, balanced healthy diet with lots of fruit and vegetables. Also make sure your losing weight for the right reasons and not for other people.
6de8798c6bf528620ad52ef6ce0d9893aa	Colon Cleansing is a huge scam, there is no need to do it whatsoever, the only thing it will do is "cleanse" your wallet of cash.

I cant stress enough how dangerous this practice is|`|3gX59LH4aa	I did the dual action cleanse (got it at walmart) and it worked pretty well. I don't think I lost any weight, maybe 5 llbs.

If you continue eating this way it lead to weight gain.    You have to eat a high fiber breakfast, this will keep you full. Try eating more fruits and vegetables, you can eat as much as you want.   You don't have to eat less to loose weight, you need to eat more like baked/grilled chicken or fish, beans, unsalted nuts, fruits, water, vegetables, whole wheat and high fiber foods.   Eating this way will keep you full and help you from overeating on junk food.

It will be ***** then crusty for a while till it heals. I'm assuming you had it done recently? Make sure you use the cleaning stuff (witch hazel or whatever they gave you) everyday at least once and move the ring all the way up and down so it doesn't grow into your skin. (gross I know) Clean the ring really well also. Even if it is infected, just keep cleaning it and it should get better quickly. In a couple weeks/month, it'll be totally fine and the piercing should heal. Congrats!
R0mGeGczaa	Acai Burn with Colon Cleanse is a big online scam. Don't go this route, it won't help you lose weight! These websites that are selling Acai with Colon Cleanse have been reported in a number of scam alerts.<br>  <br>  Acai definitely has some great health benefits. It is full of vitamins, minerals, omega fatty acids and other antioxidants.

And most of that goodness is lost when they are dried, juiced etc.  If you have a source of fresh acai berries, by all means try them.  I hear they are yummy.  But they are not some wonder food that will make you slim overnight.<br>  <br>  As for colon cleansing... your colon does a great job of cleaning it's self.

ILVCgXcYaa	It is generally advisable to repair hernias quickly in order to prevent complications such as organ dysfunction, gangrene, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Most abdominal hernias can be surgically repaired, and recovery rarely requires long-term changes in lifestyle. Uncomplicated hernias are principally repaired by pushing back, or "reducing", the herniated tissue, and then mending the weakness in muscle tissue (an operation called herniorrhaphy). If complications have occurred, the surgeon will check the viability of the herniated organ, and resect it if necessary. Modern muscle reinforcement techniques involve synthetic materials (a mesh prosthesis) that avoid over-stretching of already weakened tissue (as in older, but still useful methods). The mesh is either placed over the defect (anterior repair) or more preferably under the defect (posterior repair). At times staples are used to keep the mesh in place. These mesh repair methods are often called "Tension Free" repairs because, unlike older traditional methods, muscle is not pulled together under tension. Evidence suggests that these Tension Free methods have the lowest percentage of recurrences and the fastest recovery period compared to older suture repair methods. Increasingly, some repairs are performed through laparoscopes.
ojEkgJoqaa	the best bet is to see a reproductive endocrine doctor.    i have pcos and went to my gyn and ran tests but finally referred me to a reproducive endocrine doctor.    they take hormone levels ultrasounds and specialized tests. there are many.also corisol tests too.    yes you should go get the ultrasound but what they are looking for is enlarged ovaries caused by tiny small cysts.    it isn't a quick diagnosis and there are many medical tests to take and a complete medical history.    but reproductive endocrinologist is the one who specializes in these things and can give an accurate diag.|`|slHUNl58aa	You could, you don't have to be too heavy to have that, even if it is a very common symptom of PCOS.

0cexaYDeaa	It's good that you bought a new razor for it, each time you shave ''down there'' it's wise to use a new razor.  First, do NOT use soap anywhere near your vagina, it ''dries out'' your vagina and you can catch a bacterial infection due to using soap.    My advice, use shaving foam (only on the vulva area, not the labia) or simply shave in the shower, where your skin is wet. Also, shave against the hair grow, you'll have a smoother shave. The stubble will still be there, but less. The only way to get rid of the hair without any stubble is by waxing, but it's really a tough job to do down there, because waxing can be painful.    Try not to go over one patch of skin too many times, because that can cause red little bumps.    Another thing you maybe find useful, is that there are special little razors to shave down there, they're less sharp and the blades are smaller.|`|dc49d60c4d19a92e193ce2f41c92cfedaa	Try shaving in every direction it usually works but if not then you might need to go out and buy new stuff like nair or something like that.|`|96mkEwkwaa	well the only way to get the short stubby stuff is to go against the hair, shave up instead of down. but that also causes bumps and irritation. i would reccomend waxing if you want it smooth. shaving wont come off as smooth|`|9xgGd9praa	Hope you like the ingrowing itchy hairs!|`|1yqucDzaaa	It's never going to be completely smooth unless you wax. You are always going to have some stubble- just like shaving your legs. Buy shaving cream with aloe or for sensitive skin that will help some for the area.

The razor is about the best way to do it unless you want to use wax, which is not fun either.  The down side is that you won't ever get it "completely" smooth and the stubble comes back the next day in some areas.  All you can do is make a daily habit of going over the area and that way what you might miss one day will be gotten the next, and eventually the entire area is about as hairless as you can get it aside from waxing.  But not matter what, it will never be "completely smooth".|`|LByD8RKoaa	just shave like u shave  under  your arms and try not to cut your self because it really hurts|`|8d8791d2226db33e4dc581bab5da3953aa	shave upwards... against the hair growth.|`|Z7dShLRLaa	Just wax :s    Seriousily better than shaving.

uKmNYqGgaa	I take generic Wellbutrin SR (150 mg) in the morning, and Lexapro (10 mg) in the evening, for depression and anxiety.  I've been taking that for over two years, and it's working very well for me.     The Wellbutrin SR seems to help me to be more alert and active - and wanting to do things - while the Lexapro makes me more mellow, and it helps me sleep better, too.  They are relatively low doses of each medication, which keeps side effects at a minimum.  I really can't tell I'm taking any medication at all.     The last time I was in the doctor office, I had lost 8 lbs - not a lot, but in the right direction.  I give the Wellbutrin SR the credit for the weight loss, since it does help me to be more active.|`|KNnwUcpqaa	I took 10mgs and it did not cause me to gain weight. It varies from person to person.|`|uJKTR4d2aa	Could you please state the mg's it is? 5? 10? 20?     I was on lexapro 20mg, it did help some but my g/f said no nad i listened. (stupid me, but shes my ex now) i took it bad after that, meaning some days i would others i wouldnt.     I think its a good medication besides the weight gain. i gained about 5 pounds on it. wasnt too bad. Be consistant though, dont do what i did or you will get very very bad depression.     Also citalopram is the older version of it, i was put on that 40mg but it didnt work at all. go figure    Edit -    Lol. Weight loss. Yeah, in my dreams. They always say that, even about Seroquel the drug that leads to diabeties! You will expirience weight gain. I only got 5 pounds because i didnt take it consistantly, so it never built up in my system. Just watch out for it. It could make you gain  a hell of a lot

MHg9JhEKaa	Aaw I know exactly how you feel. It takes a lot to go to the docs and lay your feelings out. Then when they dismiss your problem it leaves you feeling like your not heard, and like you say, undermined. <br>  But I hear you hun.  <br>  <br>  You need a psychologist really rather than a psychiatrist.  True only psychiatrists can prescribe medication, but having read your last post I think CBT would be a far better route for you.  Do you really want to be on anti-depressants with all their side effects for the rest of your life? They can indeed reduce anxiety, and they're very helpful for some people, but in my opinion in your case they would act more like a mask. They won't cure your mental pain, just numb it.  I think CBT would be much more effective for you in helping tackle the anxiety you feel, but you would need to request to see a psychologist who is trained and well-versed in CBT, as not all are.  Your problems and emotions are real, and do warrant treatment when they cause you so much stress. <br>  <br>  Another thing to remember is that GP's in general (not all) aren't well trained in recognising and dealing with patients who have psychological issues.  I would go back to the docs, but this time when you ring for the appointment, ask the clerk if you can see a different GP, prefrably one who has a good understanding of psychological problems.  If you do get that referral, be prepared that there will likely be a waiting list, and it could be a few months before you get to see anyone, but it will be worth the wait. I say if, because it sounds like your anxiety is mild to moderate. That is not to belittle your feelings at all, but like many illnesses sometimes unless you suffer really badly, GP's don't really know what to other help to offer you. There is a serious lack of services out there for people with mental health problems, so they have to make the worst people a priority.<br>  <br>  Do go back to the docs my love. It is sad, but sometimes we have to push for the right kind of help. Good luck, get the ball rolling - the sooner you do that, the sooner you're on the road to living a happier life.|`|ruamFLoiaa	A psychiatrist (at least in the US) generally only prescribes medications.  They might be helpful but therapy is important too and in your case, especially so.  <br>  <br>  Do you have to be referred to a therapist by your primary care doctor?  Is your medical system socialized? (meaning does the government pay for your care?)  If so, that could explain why your problem isn't seen as important enough to warrant treatment.    <br>  <br>  At any rate, I hope you are able to get some help.  Good luck to you.|`|CX1tpaGZaa	Your doctor said look on the internet for help?! over 70% of the stuff on the internet is flase or incorrect,<br>  You sound just like me, but when ever i try to explain to someone how i feel it doesnt come out right and it makes me sound like im attention seeking, About a year ago i went to the doctors but she perscribed me propranolol, which helped my anxiety alot, maybe you should ask your doctor about propranolol and see if they can perscribe you some.|`|HAhm1TUoaa	It is probably because there are massive waiting lists for mental health treatment already, and in some cases people are on the verge of suicide so the doctor really needs to treat them first.

Your Doctor obviously does not listen to his patients very well and is one that wants to be in charge. Doctors and their patients are supposed to work together on issues.|`|Uh2x306Caa	I would go for a second opinion.|`|HPRFtBAsaa	Hello there<br>  <br>  try not to feel upset that your doctor didn't refer you.  Basically in order for you to qualify for input from mental health services, you need to have a severe and enduring mental health difficulty, such as...<br>  <br>  schizophrenia<br>  Bi Polar disorder<br>  <br>  or, have a difficulty such as obsessional compulsive disorder (ocd) or severe anxiety.  If you don't have a major mental health diagnosis, they would only take you on if your difficulty severely impaired your day to day functioning, so if it is anxiety, it would need to be so bad for them to see you such as you can't work, you haven't left the house for 5 months, your cupboards are bare because you can't get to the shops and it makes you feel suicidal.  <br>  <br>  The reason that the criteria is so strict, is that mental health teams aren't equipped to deal with the milder or moderate mental health difficulties, they have to work at the end where literally peoples lives are at risk on a daily basis.<br>  <br>  Have a think, and perhaps you could write things down in a different way.  Your doctor would not have seen your difficulty in doing presentations as a sign that you should be referred, as if you think about it, this is a normal anxiety for anyone.  <br>  <br>  If you are however suffering crippling anxiety at work, getting hold of a good book would be a start. <br>  <br>   Mind have a range of their own leaflets, so check their website too<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mind.org.uk/Information/Booklets/Understanding/Understanding+anxiety.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.mind.org.uk/Information/Bookl...</a>  <br>  <br>  You could also have a look at No Panic's website for information<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.nopanic.org.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nopanic.org.uk/</a><br>  <br>  Another well respected website is Mood Gym, this is a sort of self help website which asks you lots of questions about your mental health and then gives you modules to work through..<br>  <br>  <a href="http://moodgym.anu.edu.au/welcome" rel="nofollow">http://moodgym.anu.edu.au/welcome</a><br>  <br>  Your GP should know if your situation is that your anxiety...<br>  <br>  prevents you from leaving the house<br>  your mood deteriorates/suicidal thoughts etc<br>  You have to give up work because of it<br>  Your diet becomes affected<br>  You aren't sleeping<br>  You become increasingly withdrawn, avoid seeing people that you'd normally see etc<br>  <br>  In this situation, he may add in an anti depressant (ssri) which can help with anxiety.<br>  He may still refer you for a mental health assessment in the future.  <br>  <br>  A mental health team would probably send you out a support worker to go out and about with you to help you overcome your anxiety.<br>  Avoidance makes anxiety worse, so you need to keep going out, however difficult it is.<br>  <br>  How about looking up a college course on assertiveness or giving presentations in your area?  As difficult as it is for you to go to the course, it would be very confidence building for you, and everyone would be in similar situations.<br>  <br>  Alternatively, you could google counsellors or life coaches in your area (if you can afford it), and there will be some who specialise in supporting people with these issue.  Be careful though, counsellors come with varying degrees of experience, you want one with years of experience, preferably works with a CBT approach rather than freudian.  <br>  <br>  CBT would focus on practical steps for you to work on your difficulties<br>  <br>  Freudian/psychoanalytic types will spend alot of time looking at your past, when in this instance you probably need to get on with working on your future.<br>  <br>  Life coaches can bring a sort of bright and breezy approach to working with you to help you move on.  Not everyone respects this profession, but i have had a good experience with a life coach, I like the way that mine was very positive and had lots of ideas, whereas counsellors and therapists will tend not to offer ideas.<br>  <br>  Meditation is an excellent way of relaxing Ken and Elizabeth Mellor do a brilliant range of CD's, they're Australian, and really know what they are doing.

There are huge waiting lists for talking therapies.  Although your problem is severe to you, the Dr doesn't consider it to be life-threatening, so he doesn't consider it urgent.  He will therefore try to avoid offering you therapy/ a psychiatrist to avoid putting more people in the queue.  Telling you to look on the internet is not helpful, although there is a CBT programme on the internet that may help with depression and anxiety.  It is a self-help programme funded by the NHS...  let me try and find it... it's had good success rates and may be worth trying while you're in the mighty queue for the help you need.<br>  <br>  Here we go, <a href="http://www.fearfighter.com/patient_website/index_patient.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.fearfighter.com/patient_websi...</a> it's called Fear Fighter, and is for anxiety.

6t76bgS3aa	wow man, I totally agree with you.  Life has real highs and downs, we're not supposed to be robots that have no emotion.  Psychiatrists who make big piles of money tell people that they have a chemical imbalance in their brain if they do things that psychiatry doesn't like ... it's easy to make up a psychiatric illness, they just vote on them.  <br>  <br>  Why no blood test or x-ray like real doctors do?

So I understand your irritation: diagnoses are for specialists and not for amateurs. There are too much fashionable people in the psychiatric incrowd and that's a bad thing. On the other hand, people, and especially young people, have the tendency of seeking for a suitable diagnose when everything is not as it should be. That's too bad but is is a bit of a sickness of this century. <br>  I do not agree with you as far as serious issues are involved. It is very important that good diagnoses can be made for people suffering from terrible psychological pain, hallucinations, psychoses, schizophrenia, so that a medical and therapeutic treatment can be prescribed.|`|F7jOVyeqaa	Well, I think you are very much right in saying that it has become a profitable enterprise. <br>  <br>  The more mental disorders are "discovered", the more pills can be poured out on the market and unfortunately many people today believe in the easy solution of popping a pill to find happiness. <br>  <br>  Truth is that psychiatry has zero scientific evidence that mental illnesses even exist. Their diagnosis is unfortunately a sham. "Illnesses" which are invented these days are characteristics that most of us have now and then. Is there a man who walks on Earth today who has not had a time in his life when he felt down when he was disheartened, lost hope for a few hours or even for a few days? Surely not too many. By current psychiatric classification any of us can be examined and found mentally ill and prescribed a drug with shocking side effects which are cured with more drugs with more side effects. By the end you really do end up mentally ill.<br>  <br>  It is a fact that psychiatry can't cure anything.<br>  <br>  Verily, as you said, my friend, communication with each other of the things that are on our minds does in fact bring much more ease from the burdens of living and lead to more happiness.|`|g7fRRwtaaa	There are hacks, as there are in any field, but I think in general psychiatry is legitimate and can be very helpful.<br>  <br>  I disagree with your conjecture that there would be no mental illness if we were all more open.

However it doesn't mean that by being open there will be no mental illness in the world. Having a mental illness might mean you have a chemical imbalance in your brain which causes you to feel or behave in a certain way. In order to have a "life" some people NEED to see a psychiatrist, to get a diagnosis firstly. After getting a diagnosis they might need certain medications that can only be prescribed by a psychiatrist. I believe you should talk to a mentally ill person about this. They will tell you what their life would be like without psychiatric help. You have to remember a psychiatrist is no healer. Yes a psychiatrist can help you pinpoint the source of your problems, but it's not always going to help you feel better.<br>  Another thing to remember is that, yes there are many psychiatrists out there that don't know anything and they just claim to know what they are talking about because they have the title. On the other hand, there are many GOOD psychiatrists out there that have helped millions of people. You shouldn't generalize.  (I have experience with four different psychiatrists who all turned out to be idiots, but I don’t think I will insult the profession because of my unfortunate experience. I will just make a personal choice whether I want to go through it again in the hope of finding someone who knows what they’re talking about)<br>  Think about someone with bipolar or schizophrenia. Do you think they can live a relatively normal life without psychiatric help?? NO, they can't. Just like there are doctors or engineers that don’t know s**t , it doesn’t mean that ALL doctors or engineers are crap. Just try to look at the positive things that some people have done in this profession.<br>  This my own opinion anyway…|`|xqYrGjGVaa	Psychiatric Nonsense<br>  Macsmind links to this story today on MSNBC, Should bias be treated as a mental illness?  The title is a little misleading but the story features some truly nonsensical Psychiatric intellectualizations and shows what can be achieved when professionals allow their language abilities to trump their reality testing.<br>  <br>  Most Psychiatrists have high level proficiency in their language skills.  They have succeeded in college and medical school, and entered a part of medicine which offers a premium to those who can use the language in an elegant manner.  There is really nothing wrong with that, as far as it goes.  However, while Psychoanalysts spend years trying to understand their own unconscious biases and learn ways to keep their biases out of the treatment setting, it is not a requirement for Psychiatrists to undergo Psychoanalysis, or any other kind of therapy (though many do, for their own personal reasons or to help make them better at their work.)  It is clear that even with the most careful attention to one's own biases, they still can pervade our thinking and influence how we experience the world.  Many people have a powerful tendency to see the world through a particular prism that distorts everything they see.  The classic reduction of such thinking is the aphorism that says that "to a hammer, everything is a nail."<br>  <br>  For some Psychiatrists, all misbehavior is pathology.  When you add in an unconscious need to tell other people what to think and how to behave (the kinds of "control" issues that are frequently unconscious and conflicted in the helping professions), you have a dangerous mix.<br>  <br>  The MSNBC article poses this dilemma:<br>  <br>  Mental health practitioners say they regularly confront extreme forms of racism, homophobia and other prejudice in the course of therapy, and that some patients are disabled by these beliefs. As doctors increasingly weigh the effects of race and culture on mental illness, some are asking whether pathological bias ought to be an official psychiatric diagnosis.<br>  <br>  ....<br>  <br>  The proposed guidelines that California psychologist Edward Dunbar created describe people whose daily functioning is paralyzed by persistent fears and worries about other groups. The guidelines have not been endorsed by the American Psychiatric Association, which publishes the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM); advocates are mostly seeking support for systematic study.<br>  <br>  In a society which values tolerance above almost anything else, there is a superficial plausibility to this proposal.   However, if I may use a sophisticated Psychiatric term to encapsulate this idea: putting this into the DSM would not only be ridiculous but it would be crazy!<br>  <br>  The DSM (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, which is the "official" listing of accepted Psychiatric diagnoses) already contains diagnostic entities which cover delusions (fixed, false ideas that do not conform with reality) and obsessions (preoccupations with ideas that limit a person's daily functioning).  All of the examples of pathology mentioned in the article could be covered by diagnoses that contain such symptom complexes.  On the other hand, once the DSM includes pathological bias, just imagine the fun the legal professional and the professional victims associations could have with such a diagnosis.<br>  <br>  Consider the racist who insults his Asian or Black co-worker.  Charges of racism fill the air.  Charges are brought.  Lawyers are engaged.  Levels of victimhood are assessed.  The racist is threatened with job loss but responds with the Americans with Disabilities Act that makes it illegal to fire him because he has a Psychiatric illness.  The aggrieved victim of the racist sues the company for allowing an atmosphere of intimidation.  The company is then forced to pay millions to both the racist (for putting him in a situation which encourages his outbursts and makes him uncomfortable) and the victim is paid millions because he was forced by his company to tolerate such abuse.  Teams of lawyers become wealthy destroying companies across America.  The worst thing is that this is not even a far fetched fantasy.  Once bias is entered as an illness, almost anyone can be charged with it and/or use the illness as a defense.  At what point does bias become pathological?  It seems to me that for Psychiatrists to offer the legal/grievance professions such ammunition is foolhardy and idiotic.<br>  <br>  In one of those coincidences that confirm such fears, this morning on the radio I heard an ad for a lawyer asking people who have taken Zyprexa to call him.  To paraphrase, if you have developed Diabetes, had Pancreatitis, Ketoacidosis, (or any of several other problems), call the law firm of AAA; you may be in line for a cash award!  I am  not making this up.  <br>  <br>  In June, I wrote several posts, starting with The Doctor's Dilemma: Risks, benefits, and liabilities detailing the difficult balance one must find when prescribing m

BRAT diet (google it) soup and crackers are also idea.No dairy, juices or sodas (except for electrolyte drinks)    prevention:    Norwalk virus  (Just remember that hand sanitizers will not kill this virus.House hold cleaners such as Lysol will also not kill you.You must use bleach.)    The Norwalk virus causes viral Gastroenteritis which is known as the nasty 24 hour bug that causes explosive and sudden diarrhea and projectile vomiting.Usually non life threating but can cause complications in the very young,elderly and those with compromised immune systems.    PREVENTION-Wash your hands before preparing food/eating food and most importantly, TOUCHING YOUR MOUTH/NOSE/EYES.    The ONLY way to become infected with this virus is if you ingest the contaminated fecal/vomit particles through your eyes,nose and mouth.    It is impossible to "breathe" in the virus BUT possible to become infected by breathing in aerosol "spray" droplets from someone vomiting right next to you.(the droplets settle within minuted but can still infect someone until cleaned with bleach)    Even if your whole family breaks out with this virus, you can prevent it by washing your hands for at least 15-20 seconds with warm water and soap.Remember that you are not killing the virus, you are washing it down the drain even if you use an antibacterial soap (which only kills bacteria, not viruses) hand sanitizers are also not successful in killing the virus.    If a member of your family comes down with the virus, let them know to wash their hands AFTER a bowel movement and vomiting.    To clean infected areas, clean with BLEACH.Clean bathrooms (all infected areas) with a bleach solution as soon as possible and be sure to prevent cross contamination and wash your hands afterwards.Especially children! wipe down all commonly touched objects like door knobs, faucet handles, light switches, toilet flushers etc.    People are STILL contagious even after 24 hours after their symptoms settle down so it is always important to wash your hands after the rest room (which you should do anyways!)    The key to staying Norwalk virus free is to keep sanitary.Wash your hands after using the bathroom...you could prevent other peoples misery as well as yours!!    TIPS:Do not share any cups/plates/utensils with an infected person and be sure to wash in a bleach solution to prevent cross contamination with the rest of your family.

qKrYAAywaa	as a personal trainer, I suggest a personal trainer and a nutrirional coach. They will tell you everything that you need.    Also consistency is key little grasshopper. If you aren't consistent, then there is no use. Its going to be the hardest thing to do, but once you are in a habbit, then its going to be so much easier.    Remember, good habits are hard to make, but easy to live with, bad habits are easy to make but hard to live with.    Good luck!|`|DzyCjYToaa	speak to a personal trainer, or a doctor.
xlFwLTCFaa	No offense meant, but I think 135 lbs might be a little light for your height...like 30 lbs light.  I can tell you that a lot of coke and little fruits is very bad for you.  Switch to diet coke, or better, stop drinking soda.  The type 2 diabetic diet really focuses on eating right and being consistent with your meals.  There is a website called diets4life.org that has meal plans for $4.99 / month created by registered dieticians.  Even with that, I would print up the meal plan, and go see you doctor.  You need to speak to a nutritionist if nothing else.  Type 2 diabetes is very serious.  People have lost limbs, gone blind, etc., but you CAN CONTROL IT.  Look at it as an opportunity to treat you body as best as you possibly can.  Good Luck.|`|baaf30673b204103b269ddf718be2c5caa	If you're diabetic, then you need to start eating properly, at regular times.

2WwfS4x4aa	u can talk to your doctor about it and ask..i had to have an xray(it was done carefully) and a tooth pulled while i was pregnant..and my kid turned out just fine|`|UEOldaPZaa	It is best not to have any major dental work other than cleanings.  X-rays best not to be taken unless its an emergency.  In the 3rd trimester, try to avoid any dental work as it will be difficult to lie on a reclined chair.    During pregancy, it is important to keep your gums and teeth cleaning.  Due to hormonal changes, you will be prone to gingivitis (swelling and bleeding of the gums).    Thornhill Dentist http://www.bcdentalcare.ca|`|1nINGDC7aa	one can get the normal dental procedures done like cleaning of the teeth or the filling done. for more information on dental care during pregnancy you can visit the following link  http://www.identalhub.com/ArticleSubCate...|`|K2bpyDVsaa	You can get really basic things like cleanings but no X-rays and no major dental work.

cHkH7ESuaa	Hi!  I have a LOT of experience with exercise.  I workout 6 days out of the week, including training for triathlons during the spring/summer.<br>  <br>  In my own, informed opinion, the treadmill is a terrible peice of exercise equipment.  You would be SO MUCH BETTER OFF to get outside and do your workout routine than just go inside and use a treadmill.<br>  <br>  That being said, the elliptical will give you a far better workout than just jogging or walking on the treadmill, assuming you are doing a fairly high-intensity elliptical routine with hills included.<br>  <br>  I like the elliptical machine for days when it's soggy outside and I don't feel like getting wet running, but I think it's great to mix-it-up between high-intensity elliptical work, runs that include sprinting intervals, and uphill runs.|`|4f46a3ab367e69b76b30e6290112ed68aa	The elliptical is a newer machine and they haven't been able to refine the calorie counters on it as well as the treadmill. They can be off as much as 70%. Try varying the incline on the treadmill to a pretty steep grade. You would be amazed the calories you burn. I do a 10K (6.2 miles) once a week at a 22% incline and burn 1700 calories.

I didn't used to think I dreamed either until I had a period of time when my sleep would get interrupted sometimes, then you wake up in the middle of one.|`|AA11989999	Everyone dreams. (REM sleep).

Dont just go up to them and spill your life story, but whenever you get the urge to talk to a girl do it, butt in if you have to. i know sometimes that you want to say something but you dont, i am telling you to speak up, or everything is going to pass you by.|`|SltEwVX7aa	You're a handsome guy!<br>  <br>  Yeah, you've got a little acne going on.

I had slight nausea when I first started taking it but nothing that I couldn't deal with.  However, I did start getting chronic nosebleeds (as in every single day) after taking it for about 2 months.  Once I went off it, the nosebleeds stopped.  I also had really vivid dreams with it.<br>  <br>  Edit:  Lexapro didn't really do anything for me despite taking it for over a year and going up to really high doses.  I found Prozac to be more effective.  However, the way people react to different medications varies widely.  And another thing, when I started on 20 mg I got really sick (bad nausea and diarrhea).  I ended up having to start out small, like 5 mg for a week, then 10 for 2 weeks, etc.  That's when I only had the mild nausea.  With any medication, they should start you off on a low dose so the side effects aren't so bad.  You could simply cut your pills in half and then go up when you feel comfortable.  I would ask your doctor about starting on 10 mg.|`|F7jOVyeqaa	Antidepressants are not the way to get rid of depression. I have dealt with mental phenomena for 18 years.

Although these side effects can occur at anytime during treatment, those patients who are sensitive to Lexapro or escitalopram usually experience these side effects during their first week of treatment with this antidepressant drug. <br>  <br>  I know a doctor who, when prescribing a new medication, always says, “Remember, any drug can do anything, anytime.” That’s important advice to remember, since you can never be certain how your body will react to any new medication or how a new drug will interact with any other drugs, you’re taking. <br>  <br>  Remember to consult your health care provider anytime you’re unsure about any symptom, or symptoms, that you experience while taking any medication. Most of the time, particularly in the case of antidepressants, other medications are available when serious or bothersome side effects occur. <br>  <br>  Tip: If you experience dry mouth or mouth irritations due to medications or for any reason, try the line of products that include mouthwash and toothpaste, as well as several other oral health products for adults and babies called Biotene. I've used these products and can't say enough about how well they work.

AA10554882	You know what, pregnancy tests can be pretty pricey, so my suggestion is to wait a bit longer. Also, some dollar stores have them too, so that's another possibility.<br>  <br>  You can take a pregnancy test about 2 weeks after the sex, and it should be accurate.  I suggest you wait until the 5th day it's late. (Normally, a period isn't really considered late until about 5 days later). <br>  <br>  I'm sure she's freaking out. It isn't an exageration when I say that emotional stress like that will delay her period longer. She's got to do everything possible to find peace. If her period is on it's way, it won't come until she can do that. Regardless of the results, this is not a death sentence. She's got options, and she's got support. Remind her of these things.<br>  <br>  All the best to you both.|`|Y8t4MeUlaa	I think two days is a bit too early. It's not abnormal to not get your period to-the-day each month. The stress might also add to the delay. <br>  Besides, even if it turns out negative and your gf still doesn't get her period for a couple of more days, you're going to think the test was wrong and are going to take it again. :) <br>  I say wait for another week or so. If it's there, i'll still be there in a week. If not, you'll have worried for nothing.

AA11928403	Well, do you know anyone who has high self esteem and confident in himself in depression?  He/she can't, because high esteem and depression won't get along at all.  I am not talking about people who are PRETENDING to be high esteem or confident though.  Excessively sensitive, critical, and perfectionists will also easily go to depression.  Because they expect of themselves to set very high standard and they expect to achieve it every time.  Every time they failed the expectation, they lose their confidence.  And since most of them who have depression are perfectionists more or less, one little failure seems to be a disaster and go into a depression.  And when it happens more often than once, it's very hard to tolerate for them and go to deeper depression.      With family history of mental disorder,  you have to work harder to overcome depression, or sometimes need of medication help.|`|ezI5HwRWaa	This is how they can be linked to depression: when a person is sad, they start to lose confidence in themselves. People who are depressed usually don't have a positive attitude about life and they usually think of themselves as worthless. How can someone who thinks of themself as useless, have confidence?     I think that that kind of person could be more susceptable to depression, because they wan't perfection in their life and it doesn't happen. But if that person has a drive and a positive additude about life, it will help to keep them out of depression. If they are that kind of person but they get discouraged easily then it is more likely they will suffer from depression. It all comes down to the person's individual personality and life experiences.|`|RR7UX4jkaa	Depression is linked to them. They are some of the attributes that can cause depression.

0cexaYDeaa	First of all I want to say, your teacher is COMPLETELY out of line here with what she's doing and saying. I recommend you talk to her, and explain what is going on. I'm sure she is pissed off with people faking periods to get away from swimming lessons, but this has nothing to do with you.    Second of all, a normal period could last about 3 to 10 days but there are several things that could change that. For example, sickness, emotional health, physical heath, eating pattern, height/weight/age etc.    That your period last longer than other people, is not as strange, but that it returns after 2 weeks again, really is strange. Do you have someone who you can talk to this about, like your mom, a mentor, or someone else who is a grown up and give you proper advice?    How long have you had your periods now? If it has just been like half a year since you got your first period, it's normal that it's different and not regular yet.    I think it'd be good to see a doctor, even if it's just to make sure everything is okay. You really shouldn't worry, every woman's body is different, and so are their periods, I'm sure that it's nothing :)|`|5PatAvshaa	Don't worry some people just have irregular periods.

And typical period is 4 or 5 days....though some can be shorter or longer.  That does sound aweful long for a period, and maybe a birth control pill would regulate it for you.  Seeing a gyn would not be a bad idea.  But if you thinkd about it, if you have 10 day period, + about 2 weeks thats 24 days, thats not too far off a normal cycle length.|`|xcJn4pfGaa	Some girls have it for as little as 2 days, and some for up to 2 weeks, it depends on your lifestyle, the swimming will do good and make your periods lighter and shorter.  The whole cycle lasts between 21 and 35 days depending on the lifestyle again. 28 days is average.    x
JBLcMQ9haa	Hey there! You definitely need to get in to an Optometrist!! If you cannot see the board far away, that means that you are near-sited. If you can see things up close, but not far away...you are near-sited....or Myopic...for medical terms. This can easily be corrected with a pair or glasses or contacts. If you don't get it corrected, then you will start getting headaches and your vision will continue to get worse.|`|AA10723498	You are nearsighted.  I am near sighted as well.

If your were farsighted, you could see things from a distance.  So you need glasses to see distance.

If you play sports (like i do), get contacts. They are very easy to put in after you get used to it. and are pretty cool.

How about running or bicycling on the "off days."|`|4SjFQHClaa	i would say you are doing enough  if anything you dont need to be doing that much  i would leave your free days free, and relax    =]|`|rnNn9Ervaa	I can honestly say, you exersize plenty. haha.|`|DMhAPurkaa	How about doing yoga for your other 2 days?   it would align in nicely with your ballet..the stretching and lengthening it has in it... see namaste yoga on Direct TV 7 30 am , 11 30 am, and 9 pm, and 9 30 pm , on channel 261. Also how about belly dancing? Shimmy on Direct TV 3 pm on tuesday,and 8 pm .I know that s tuesday, but you could copy down the moves and do them on wednesday or get a DVD from the library on it.

Let your body rest and heal itself on those days that you don't exercise.|`|DzyCjYToaa	yes it is fine, and in reply to one of the other answer, ballet does count as an exercise (especially devloppes..)  i think that maybe, if you want to do something you should try something quite calm and not as rigorous, such as yoga, because it really helps develop your core muscles and other rarely used muscle groups, but as it is quite calm it is also quite recuperative.|`|LrjA2agHaa	maybe you should chill out lol|`|si91sAf0aa	it sounds like you're already doing quite a lot...if you want to do something on wednesday and sunday you should make it something more relaxed and fun, like going for a walk with friends or a bike ride, but not somthing really strenuous, cos you need to rest.    :)|`|BgmIdx4Yaa	whoa! slow down!

I would suggest going for a bike ride or maybe a run...|`|EiPdBAaeaa	You need to slow down bcuz your body needs rest!! But your doing fine!|`|C0HJCYjBaa	Thats more than enough.

KPtrfsEYaa	Cardio is the only way to lose body fat.  Any kind of brisk cardio.  Keep your heart rate elevated for at least 30 minutes, go an hour if you can.  The more cardio you do the fast it will come off.  This is not the answer most people want, but the truth is it takes hard work to have the body you want.  Drink lots of water (80oz a day).  Eat healthy foods ( veggies, fruits, lots of protein, whole grains).  Try and eat every 3 to 4 hours (small meals and healthy snacks).  When you eat often it boosts your metabolism and you will burn more calories.|`|UGnyqnjWaa	The term overweight spells out varying things to varying individuals. It's a good idea to set off at the beginning, and establish if you are actually overweight for your size or not, by working out your BMI (Body Mass Index). To be honest, the one method that definitely worked for me was wu-yi tea, it can be seen in the resource box underneath, they have a few free trials remaining, it has been highlighted in Reader's Digest and USA Today. I lost 30 pounds, it definitely does produce results!|`|ItJzrvQ4aa	jogging is an excellent exercise because it let you lose weight  evenly throughout your whole body. If you want to lose weight in  specific areas, you should target them with exercises. If they are  your problem areas, they will be very difficult to tone. You will have  to work double on them. The best approach is this:  1. Lower/control your daily calorie intake (control for normal  weight, lower for overweight).  2. Run/jog to lower your overall body fat percentage.  3. Target your problem areas with exercises.  an  excellent  exercise,  you  can do it in front of your TV: sit on a  stool,  and  put  your toes under something (piece of heavy furniture,  for  example). In your hands hold a little dumbbell. Please, make sure  that  it  is  not very heavy, start with one kilo, for example, or you  will  damage  your  back and spine! Slowly move the upper part of your  body  back, until it's parallel with the ground. Stop for a second and  move it back to the sitting position. Repeat ten times. Every week add  to  the  number  of  repetitions.  You will see the results in a week,  guaranteed! You will see or feel under the fat - if you have any - six  pack  and  muscles.  Dumbbells  do  wonders.  Much  better  than these  crunches  -  I  came  up to three hundreds and there was no results AT  ALL. With the dumbbells you will see it in a week.|`|rLPtrQzYaa	I did 15 mins excersise (on wii fit) a day and i gradually lost weight. Insted of skipping breakfast eat it that way your body doesnt have to produce anymore fat from the food you eat (otherwise it could make fat out of all the healthy things you eat if you dont eat often) just eat a low fat breakfast.  It isnt really a case of how much you eat though just more of what you eat. Try not to eat over 50 grams of fat a day.|`|Gn3kqG8paa	Lots & lots of cardio, such as running and jumping rope. I do jump rope over the course of the day because it helps burn calories quickly. I also try to incorporate jumping jacks throughout the day so that I'm burning more calories as well. You may also have to cut out some junk food. I'm not saying you have to completely change the way you eat (I didn't) but cut down on some of it.|`|A7ZaduSWaa	To lose body fat you MUST do low intensity aerobic exercise. Meaning about 60% Maximum heart rate. The higher aerobic intensity you go the more the body relies on carbs for energy. Eat a balanced meals, think 3 parts carbs, 2 parts proteins, and 1 part fats (yes your body does need them!). Do some toning through resistance training. Try do do the aerobics (low intensity) around 3-4 times a week. Start slow, or you may set yourself up for failure. Target fat loss is a myth. Depending on genetics your body will be prone to lose fat from one area before another. You can't control it. Best thing to do is tone the abs, but, keep with a good low intensity aerobic regimen. If you have any other questions let me know. I could help come up with a few plans with some more information from you.|`|KxosRrgFaa	Me and my girlfriend swear by the rebounder (mini trampoline) and have both lost weight in the "right places" since we started jumping.    Most exercise work by applying weight to specific muscles  or groups of muscles so with running for example, which mainly focuses on the legs, that became out of the question for both of us because it was damaging our knees. With rebounding when you're in zero gravity you increases weight on every cell of the body but without harming it.    A 10 minute a day workout applies an increase of weight on every  cell of your body nearly 100 times each minute. Every muscle, bone,  connective tissue, ligament, tendon, even the collagen and the skin...  Because of this the entire body starts to tone and firm up and you will lose weight naturally where its needed.    The only thing that is vital if you start rebounding is that you must get a good quality one... i've heard the cheap ones that you get from your typical sport store can cause back issues.    Hope this help and good luck, :)

lTSRgfNSaa	Creatine Monohydrate is generally seen as a pretty safe and effective means of generating muscle mass. It is though to work by increasing the flow of water (and the nutrients absorbed in it) to the muscles. If you do decide to use creatine, I would just make sure you drink lots of water, otherwise it could put strain on your kidneys.     However, creatine is a pretty serious bodybuilding supplement, and seeing as you're still growing I would wait a few years before starting creatine use. It's probably best to wait unitl you're 15 or 16 and your growth plates have fully closed to make sure you don't damage anything. In the meantime, I would recommend lots and lots of protein shakes. If you're not already drinking them, you should drink one after each workout and it'll give you huge muscle gains! Good Luck!!|`|zu0W6hCTaa	dont lift weights! ur too young. Just do workouts that utilize ur body weight.|`|tqu2SALHaa	I am a GP, Creatine Mono-hydrate CANNOT be snorted, the person below must like killing people. I would Recommend that you do not take it until about the age of 18.  This is used by athletes, not 13 year old, There are some side effects that you at that age might expect.  It may make your living cells in your body confused, they will not work right, and this can cause to a cancerous Tumor. so i do say that you should NOT|`|uXP1Xij4aa	no bad sidaffects r kno  especially when snorted, snorted works much better then drinking it.  u should snort it with your dad|`|88a3bbbf6dab801eaa5ad76bd8ed789daa	It has side effects. meet doctor before starting.|`|ljVwo5qZaa	I can't believe all the negative feedback that you people are giving this kid. People, stop believing rumors and read an exercise phsyiology journal once in awhile before you comment on sports supplements!    Creatine is the origin of energy for the contraction of the muscles that is why it is highly recommended as bodybuilding supplements. Our own body can also produce creatine in our pancreas, liver and kidneys. You can also obtain higher creatine substance if you're eating more fish and meat than taking vegetarian diets. Creatine is stored on our body most especially on the skeletal muscles to be able to utilize it during the body movements or exercise. The remaining substances are distributed all throughout to your brain, heart and the rest of the tissues.    It is SAFE to take and is the most studied sport supplement and has been around for years. Many many people that workout/bodybuild take creatine on a daily basis. It does not need to be cycled or anything like that b/c it is a non hormonal product. The typical dosing is 5g per day which is equal to 1 rounded teaspoon.    If you have started puberty already then it is fine to start working out. However, I can't stress enough that you find an older more experianced lifter to help you out at first until you get a routine down and understand the basics of weight training.     Also, don't forget that eating big is the fastest way to get big. You should have no problem with this since you're a teenager and you appetite is amazing.
PzSI7EPEaa	All the things you mentioned are carbohydrates the biggest contributor to weight gain.

Bread/Rice/Pasta should not be the only food you are eating from the Bread and Cereal section though. Potatoes is a good option! Try eating lots of Whole-grain bread, this will get you lots of fiber and your digestive system will benefit from this!|`|6sPsYqSYaa	look at the recommended carbohydrates allowance for girls on the internet.<br>  <br>  Because bread and pasta have many carbs<br>  <br>  hope this helps x|`|H7rfCOk9aa	You should eat 4 grams of carbohydrates per pound of bodyweight each day.

You will burn over 800 calories an hour on the elliptical, but using your arms too, dont rest your arms on the hand rest, pump them like you're supposed to.<br>  <br>  the treadmill at 5km wont do anything. It has to be at least 5.5 to 6km. I do 5.8 - 6km at an incline of 10 for 30 minutes and burn 330 calories, but I sweat more and my heart rate stays in fat burning range.

I keep doing that routine for about 15-20 minutes, that equals about seven sprints. After sprinting, it's good to have that normal speed to cool down.<br>  <br>  I'm tired of hearing about acai berry as well. I feel you haha. Good luck! :)

I was in the same position you are now. One thing that helped me get up on my feet again is meditation. It relaxes you, enabling you to think more positively. Drinking put me in a bad place, I would feel like my soul was shriveling up. I felt dead. I read 'A New Earth' and it made me realize how you can look at the same thing from so many prospectives, it's up to you to decide whether you're going to make something positive out of that thing, or something negative. From there, I started looking back at experiences, and I was actually glad for all my bad experiences, they taught me so many lessons and made me who I am now. So you can make a positive thing out of anything, IF you do in fact put your mind to it. You have to want change for it to happen. Now, to get started write a couple of positive things you learned from all the 'bad experiences' you experiences. Try that, and try meditating, and writing things you are grateful for everyday. You will feel much better even if it's just a little bit. <br>  Good luck!!!!!<br>  <br>  JASMINE|`|UNKRsSrlaa	friend  anyone has undergone the stage in life where life has no meaning.i believe it is event in life that may last for few hours or days or so on.what you need is to pray and ask GOD what are best things to do and ask HIM to give you another form of importance here on earth.we are not just a physical being, we are also a high form of spiritual being.let your spiritual side arise this time through prayer and it will direct your path today and the coming future.we will not be able to attain materials in short period of time but we may have genuine peace because of GOD who will provide it for us. yes in the name of yeshuwa or jesus pray to GOD and everytime you need to pray in his name. e.g. lord GOD i need new directions in life,provide me with understanding and wisdom to face this life with your guidance and strenght today and in the coming future.in the name of yeshuwa.amen.

I had a very similar feeling and ended up bumming out of my Alevels.  You need to go back to your docs.  they are very wary of prescribing meds to someone young, they don't want to get you on them too young.  You do need to go back though..  Depression is a very real condition and there are ways to help.  You could try St johns wort, which is a natural remedy for depression, you can't take with pharamaceutical antidepressants though.  The Docs will wnat to get you through to counselling first.  medication isn't necessarily the answer - it can have side effects and so they will want to do anything they can to not start you on them too early.  i do so relate to you though - I'm ten years on from that now and diagnosed bipolar; I am a big promoter of mental health issues and do some advocacy work.  would love to talk to you if you ever need an understanding ear - I'm on bristolbridgetjones@yahoo.com<br>  In the meantime, big hugs xxx

The main thing is to stick in there.  You can't be an addict to food and never exercise if you want to live a healthy life and keep the weight off.  I've worked out, done every diet, and all types of classes.  <br>  <br>  Nothing works,  besides dedication and intelligence towards the subject of losing weight.  <br>  <br>  First,  depending on how much weight you need to lose,  your diet is the first concern.  You can't eat 10,000 calories a day and expect the weight to come off,  even if you are exercising a lot.  Which brings us to the next thing.  Duh,  Exercising...<br>  <br>  This is a must especially if you need to a lot of weight.  Get at least 30 mins of some good hardcore exercising.  Do some cardio,  in the long run,  it's good for the heart.<br>  <br>  However,  I find the most hardest part of losing weight/keeping it off,  in my diet.  It's so hard to keep your fingers out of the cookie jar or those chocolate goodies.  I've found a great addition to help any one out,  it's a natural weight loss supplement called Proactol.  Now don't get all crazy on me and say diet pills don't work.  That is true,  but not in this case.  This one isn't meant to burn pounds while you sit on the couch.  It's an appetite suppressant,  along with being a fat binder.  I saved money on the pills at <a href="http://starturl.com/efblc" rel="nofollow">http://starturl.com/efblc</a> along with getting some good info.  It basically makes those fingers not go towards the cookie jar.  For me it's the best pill I've tried and I've tried cupboards full.  Now this doesn't mean you have to follow my foot steps but I've successfully lost roughly 70 pounds and keeping it off til this day.  <br>  <br>  Well good luck and remember what I said,  Dedicate.|`|g8DqsThiaa	Well it's not exactly a diet pill but you get results from nutrisystem.

5rJ6nf2oaa	There are some things she can do that really work. <br>  <br>  I also have arthritis in my knees and the only thing that allows me to continue to jog in the mornings is a combination of fish oil capsules (4000mg per day) and glucosamine (1500mg per day). My father also has great results with his more advanced arthritis.<br>  <br>  Many of those problems you describe can be a result of a sluggish liver.<br>  <br>  For the weight I recommend doing a diet based liver cleanse to detox the system. This costs nothing. This diet lasts for 8 weeks and requires elimination of red meat, animal fats, dairy and all processed food (and anything with a number for an ingredient). Replace this with mainly seafood (not fried), some chicken (no skin) and lots of fresh vegetables, salad and fruit (although avoid nightshade family for arthritis), and wholemeal bread, pasta and rice. Drink lots of water, and try for a fresh raw veggie juice every morning. <br>  <br>  If this diet is followed correctly it always works, no exceptions. It was written originally by a doctor (Sandra Cabot). She has a few books out which are excellent but there is no need to buy them yet. Read my articles linked below for an overview and explanation and an example diet plan that I worked up for myself.

RtObxWOsaa	I have had the same problem. I know it's probably the last thing you want to do, but exercize is the best way to lose weight quickly and safely, and keep it off. Eat smaller portions, but more frequently throughout the day, such as 5 or 6 small meals as apposed to 3 large ones. It helps boost your metabolism and also it keeps you from getting hungry. Make sure you're making healthier choices as well. It gives you more energy to work out and you'll feel better all around throughout the day.|`|3m4SFFZxaa	You can do this pretty discreatly by just eating your three meals as you usually do and just trying to cut back on snacks and watch what you are eating.

PyNtY2Ataa	on stomach and hips no it wont pay off. You can't lose weight from one part of your body only so any weight loss which sounds normal in your case by the way will occur on your whole body. And if you have fat on your stomach it is incredibly difficult to lose it. I know many guys who are slim and yet having fat on their tummy. As part of general health you are doing the right thing in just eating healthily, - not too much food - and exercise. However the fact is that you can lose a lot of weight and you may very well still retain the tummy after getting to what may be your ideal weight which is around 147 lbs.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.weightlossresources.co.uk/logout/news_features/idealweight_w.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.weightlossresources.co.uk/log...</a><br>  <br>  structural changes in ur body will take time and they are best coming gradually. Like I said eat normally and exercise but if you really want to lose tummy fat then the formula is:<br>  <br>  1) watching what you eat<br>  2) cardio<br>  3) weight lifting and working the muscle directly<br>  <br>  seeing where you are now I suggest you weight lift and lift hard. Do some overall lifting. Squats, bicep curls yes sit ups sure but it is the overall lifting that will have the biggest impact on you at this stage. By building muscle mass your body will burn more caloreis as maintaining muscles requires more energy than mainitaning the equivalent amount of fat. you will of course ned to eat enough to give you energy to lift the weights. as you gradually increase the weight you can lift your muscle mass will increase and ' soak up' the fat in your stomach. Dont worry about getting big - women dont really have the genes to get big.<br>  <br>  if you dont like that approach then you may go on a restrictive calorie diet. Your body weight in pounds times 11 will give you your daily calorie in take just to sit still adding around 35% of this amount will give you the amount you need to get through your daily actvities. You can then reduce the amount you eat to below this amount starting by say 500 calories less.|`|oGFNIQdIaa	our bodies are made to lose like 2-3 lbs max per month ... any more its not healthy...|`|XwgoLxnhaa	I have been through it all and know what's it about.  The main thing is to stick in there.  You can't be an addict to food and never exercise if you want to live a healthy life and keep the weight off.  I've worked out, done every diet, and all types of classes.  <br>  <br>  Nothing works,  besides dedication and intelligence towards the subject of losing weight.  <br>  <br>  First,  depending on how much weight you need to lose,  your diet is the first concern.  You can't eat 10,000 calories a day and expect the weight to come off,  even if you are exercising a lot.  Which brings us to the next thing.  Duh,  Exercising...<br>  <br>  This is a must especially if you need to a lot of weight.  Get at least 30 mins of some good hardcore exercising.  Do some cardio,  in the long run,  it's good for the heart.<br>  <br>  However,  I find the most hardest part of losing weight/keeping it off,  in my diet.  It's so hard to keep your fingers out of the cookie jar or those chocolate goodies.  I've found a great addition to help any one out,  it's a natural weight loss supplement called Proactol.  Now don't get all crazy on me and say diet pills don't work.  That is true,  but not in this case.  This one isn't meant to burn pounds while you sit on the couch.  It's an appetite suppressant,  along with being a fat binder.  I saved money on the pills at <a href="http://starturl.com/efblc" rel="nofollow">http://starturl.com/efblc</a> along with getting some good info.  It basically makes those fingers not go towards the cookie jar.  For me it's the best pill I've tried and I've tried cupboards full.  Now this doesn't mean you have to follow my foot steps but I've successfully lost roughly 70 pounds and keeping it off til this day.  <br>  <br>  Well good luck and remember what I said,  Dedicate.|`|rFG1hSQbaa	If you exercise while on the diet it will speed up the process.

You never feel like you empty your bladder.  They are caused from bacteria growth.  The only way to get rid of are antibodics usually prescribed by your doctor.  Taking or drinking cranberry juice can prevent them by changing your pH of your urine so bacteria can't grow.  Drinking lots of water may help as well.  To avoid getting always pee after sex, wear cotton underware and take the cranberry supplements.      good luck, they suck I know!|`|gwindStOaa	ummm... maybe you have a bladder infection...... or a UTI? idk..... that has happened to me before too...|`|1yqucDzaaa	Definitely a urinary tract infection- they don't always contain all the normal symptoms.. sometimes just the feeling of having to go when you don't is enough for it to be a UTI. You need to go to the doctor. They will do a urine test and see if there are any white blood cells- if so then it's a uti and they will prescribe you a course of antibiotics. They can also give you a medicine that will take away the symptoms until the antiotics kick in. good luck!

ohx1RwEkaa	Hypertension diseases come in 2 forms, primary arterial and pulmonary. I assume you were diagnosed with pulmonary which is the known kind of this illness. This particular lung disorder disables the process of blood in arteries and blood pressure is heightened. The pulmonary artery (what you mentioned in your case) is responsible for blood vessels carrying oxygen-poor blood to one of you heart chambers, which I assume is where the diagnosis went wrong.   What im suggesting is that you check with cardiologist for SPH which is another UNKNOWN form of this disorder especially if you experiencing breathing disorders, emphysema and bronchitis, because treatment is to be different.   Now assuming you taking wrong meds, I can say that cause for this inporper ventilation and hydropsy that you are experiencing are obviously due to hydrostatic pressure in your blood vessels.   Pulmonary edema, besides Lasex, can be treated with anticoagulants, which prevent your blood from clotting and Endothelin receptor antagonists which does the rebound effect in your vessels, but see if your doctor is wrong because it is a common case, Id suggest to check with another cardiologist for different feedback.

QLtPqPZ4aa	I have always had issues swallowing pills.  Make sure you have a full glass.  Put the pill as far back as you can on your tongue - breathe from your nose.  Put the cup to your lips and tilt your head back as soon as the liquid hits your mouth.  When I refused to swallow pills, my dad would crush them up and put them in a spoon full of honey.  I was not able to swallow pills until about 16.  If you cannot swallow them and crushing them is not an option, I would consult your dr. and see if he can prescribe you a liquid or chewable from of antibiotic.  You may have to take more of the liquid or chewable - it's usually not as strong as the pill.|`|jYjiBAQdaa	Yes, there is, I get strep a lot, and when i do, it comes with vomiting.

Castor oil will coat the lining of the throat and allow the pills down easier ,and push the infection closer to the surface ,allowing faster recovery.

3fd2288554aaf55a30c81ff30a54bba2aa	My psychiatrist says the anxiety is often just a part of the bipolar disorder. Good to get off the benzos - they can make you do stuff you wouldn't normally do, like smash things, get into arguments, etc. and can cause memory problems, which bipolar mania interferes with memory enough as it is!  Below is an essay I wrote up on reducing anxiety.    Here are my anxiety tips:    Try turning the heat up in the house or dressing much more warmly. It is hard to feel anxiety when you are too warm. I was able to cut out ativan use altogether by using this trick. Saved me big $$ too, because pills cost way more than heat. Hot baths work too, and in a pinch, like at work/school, you can try running hot water over your hands.     Avoid caffeine like the plague. Also, some cold remedies can cause anxiety. Look for the "agitation in children" warning on the box. Adults can get problems too.     Try meditation tapes like progressive muscle relaxation or guided imagery. They may seem silly at first, but they work!! They help reduce stress, which makes depression worse. You can get The Anxiety and Phobia Workbook, a really good book, maybe the library has it. There are some guided imageries in there, you could read them aloud and make a tape/cd, or get a friend to do it if you can't stand your own voice. I read mine into the computer using a program called Audacity (free) and digitally altered my voice so it doesn't bug me. Also, there is a free guided imagery you can download at healthjourneys.com. I have slow dialup & haven't downloaded it, so I don't know how good it is.    Go out with friends, and if you don't have any, find a club to join and MAKE yourself go until you actually look forward to it. A little laughing helps reduce anxiety.    Exercise at least 1/2 hour a day, and anytime you feel really hyper or depressed. Exercise is a great mood stabilizer and cuts down on anxiety a lot.  Don't do it a couple hours before bed, though, or you will be too hyped up.    If your anxiety makes it hard for you to sleep, here are some good "sleep hygiene" tips so you can sleep better. Like go to bed and get up about the same time each day, even weekends. Don't use your bedroom to watch TV and read and use the computer and all that-just use the room as a bedroom normally would be used. Don't do stuff that pumps you up right before bed, like exercising and using the computer. You want to use that last hour to wind down-Take a bath ? Make the bedroom really dark, cover up the clock radio, even so the light doesn't shine at you. If you live in the rackety city, use a noise generator (makes wave sounds and the like) to cover up the city sounds. Avoid caffeine in the afternoon and evening.    Put a lot of colorful things around the house, happy type things, and keep the blinds open and let the sun in.  Make a list of things that make you happy. Here's some things on my list: A basket full of fluffy kittens, bread fresh from the oven, Fireworks popping on a warm summer evening, The first fireflies of the season, the scent of Jergen's cherry almond lotion, The crisp sound of a saltine cracker breaking, fresh sheets on the bed, flicking a plug out onto the still surface of a summer lake, with a big sploosh! waiting for a bass to hit it, etc. Use all your senses and read that list when you are breaking down. It's kind of like comfort food, but without the calories!! I also break things up by using familiar scents, like the aforementioned jergens lotion, or vanilla or cloves. Scent can be very comforting.    Work on time management if being overwhelmed and late for things and too much to do is getting to you. Cut back on other responsibilities temporarily so you can spend more restorative time with friends and family. If there are people who stress you out, or situations, identify them and reduce them as much as possible.    You got a significant other? Extra physical touch is very helpful. Most people in the US or UK are touch deprived, so hold hands more, hug more, give shoulder rubs, etc. A pet is good to cuddle with, too, if your home situation allows you to get one. (I'm an animal lover, don't get one if you can't commit to it for 15 years)    I've taken stress management classes, and these suggestions are mostly in there. Print this out as a good summary of several anxiety management tips.    All the best!!|`|uJKTR4d2aa	Im sorry. i know how that can be.

e8Z2FVofaa	Sounds like you have some sort of issue that needs some attention, but don't get upset about it.  It is normal for most people to feel anxiety, stress or depression at some point in their life and those things can make you have suicidal thoughts.  <br>  <br>  Two things I recommend to you:<br>  1.    Don't act on your thoughts, I'm sure the world would be at a great loss without you, as would your family and friends.<br>  2.    Go see a doctor tomorrow.  Your regular doc can help you out fairly easily as this is a common thing.  The Dr. can refer you to the right person to talk to or get you on some medication to help out.  I've taken some meds in my life and they work very well.  Also it is nothing to be ashamed of or embarrassed about in case that worries you.  The Dr. sees this all the time, and like I said most people experience this same thing at some point in their lives.<br>  <br>  Best wishes to you.|`|JAMVNd5Iaa	Year 11 and 12 does that to you!

ruamFLoiaa	Insomnia is not a disease it is a symptom.  It just means that you aren't sleeping so the answer to your question is yes.  It sounds like you have both initial and terminal insomnia, meaning you take a long time to get to sleep and then wake early.<br>  <br>  Lorazepam is from a class of drugs that is most often prescribed for anxiety symptoms.  I don't think anti-anxiety medications are often a good idea.  They can be addictive and can ultimately hurt more than they help.  It's just my opinion, your mileage may vary.<br>  <br>  There are many things that help you to sleep.  Medications can help but are usually not the best solution long term.  Good sleep hygiene is helpful (your bedroom should be cool, not warm, for example, you shouldn't have a lot of light in your room, etc)  Having a bedtime routine is helpful.  Doing the same thing every night tells your body it is time to rest.  If you find that your mind is preoccupied, you might add writing in a journal to your bedtime routine and write down things to worry about at a later time.<br>  <br>  Anyway, I hope some of this helps.  I wish you well.|`|Az87btqBaa	lorazepam is for anxiety, not sleep. Anxiety wouldnt cause you to wake up in your sleep, depression causes it, try tylenol pm's if its just a few nights a week and marijuana if its every night (get a prescription if you can). you cant take tylenol pms every night, but every other night or skip a few nights is probably ok. Take 1 and dont wait until you get tired before laying down, lay down right when you take it. If you wait until you get tired you will be real groggy in the morning for some reason. Those are the 2 things Ive used for 8 years now. Tylenol Pm's only when I dont have the other. Im prescribed lorazepam, but thats for daytime anxiety.|`|1NuKii8qaa	I'm sorry for you. I take the same medication and it is helpful to me. Do you take it when you are going to sleep at 4? Or do you take it at a reasonable hour at night, to go to bed shortly afterwords. The sleeping habit you developed might play a part in the lack of efficiency of the medication. Good luck!|`|GoJLdATfaa	I suffer from the same exact thing too. It really does suck, I know. I would contact your doctor and tell him your medicine is not working. There are alot of different types of medications out there for insomnia. Eventually (hopefully) you will find the right one that will help you get some good sleep.|`|3BMBZtDxaa	Really, there is no such things as insomnia. It's just a term to describe not being able to sleep. So there's something underlining here.<br>  <br>  Maybe you should see a sleep doctor or a neurologist? Get a sleep study done or something. It's actually really helpful! Then they can accurately diagnose you and you can get back to sleeping!<br>  <br>  Restless leg syndrome and stress are just a few things that cause insomnia. Literally! There are TONS. <br>  <br>  Good luck!
2NvRZv7Uaa	hello, ok lets see if i can help you ...my dad drinks this one thing  called LINAZA every morning. It cleans your stomach , its great he has lost weight by drinking this and plus is great for your body.|`|xeRkqINEaa	about it you can find information from the following website<br>  <a href="http://healthy-lifes.synthasite.com/?q=fad%20diets" rel="nofollow">http://healthy-lifes.synthasite.com/?q=f...</a>|`|zbYBsFc3aa	this may sound kind of odd but what i did last summer is i went out for a walk for a long time during the day in the hot weather, to burn calories and stay away from the kitchen. i wear lots of clothes so i sweat more, i might even start wearing a trash bag underneath a t-shirt underneath a sweat shirt with jeans and sneakers this spring. DON'T FORGET a bottle of water!! you could dehydrate very very easily this way. i also don't eat much at all during the day, maybe a small bowl of really healthy cereal, or 2, and that's it for the whole day. the point is to burn MORE calories than you take in, because that means it's burning the fat off. i'm very confident about this, i lost 25 pounds doing it. if it's not for you, than don't use it.

AA11690259	neither. if you skip meals, and your hungry, your body will go into starvation mode and your metabolism will slow down and hence store any food energy in the form of fat. never skip meals. rather, eat smaller meals through out the day, and the best way is to make sure it's low in fat, high in protein and fiber. drink your water, and get some more exercise.|`|sMuMfuAgaa	Neither, that just makes things worse and its harder to lose weight.  I have a friend who does that and she absolutely hates eating and think about all the nutrition you lose when you skip a meal.  She's literally loosing hair and everything because she's not healthy at all.  And you also lose all of your focus and energy if you skip a meal.  It's basically a bad idea.|`|s2F6pK9Xaa	You shouldn't skip ANY meals.

AA11388527	IF her mother doesn't carry the gene but her father does, then there's a 50/50 chance that she will inherit the sickle cell hemoglobin gene from her father but the child will not have the disease.  She will carry the sickle cell trait.<br>  <br>  IF her mother also carries the gene for sickle cell hemoglobin and the child inherits this gene from both parents (a 1 in 4 chance of this happening), she will have sickle cell disease herself.  There are a few exceptions to this rule and that's if both parents have the sickle cell trait then the offspring can have sickle cell disease.  Having sickle cell trait is when a person carries one normal gene (from one parent) and one sickle cell hemoglobin gene (from the other parent).  When you carry the trait, you don't have the disease itself.  <br>  <br>  Both parents need to be tested for the trait.|`|13k2WKx8aa	Do you know for sure that your mother is not a carrier for the gene? Does your niece have both the dominant and recessive genes for it?<br>  <br>  You'd need a blood test from both parents to determine your question. It is possible for the both of them to have the gene but not have it expressed.|`|S5SvTGTZaa	As always, we do a Punnett square cross. It's a classical question for genetics students. <br>  <br>  Two alleles----normal trait (H) and sickle cell trait (S).  A normal person would have a genotype of HH, while a sickle cell person would have SS or HS. SS has a high mortality rate, so I am assuming that the father has HS, since he is still alive. But he might be really lucky, so he might still have SS. It seemed that you are talking about just having the trait and not serious anemia and things like that, so I am assuming the father has HS. <br>  <br>  So the cross is HH X HS, which gives us 50% HH and 50% HS. Your niece's odds are 50% being a sickle cell trait heterozygote. If the cross is HH X SS, however, your niece is 100% likely for being a sickle cell trait heterozygote.|`|RFeDZr8faa	My friend found out the same thing because her husband had the trait but she didn't and the baby was born healthy and didnt have it. So i wouldn't worry.

If all is well there, he could probably suggest an exercise program/diet program that may work for you.  Everyone loses weight at a different rate due to their body structure and metabolism.  Also, if you do have something physically wrong - under/overactive thyroid, that could be causing the weight gain.  Doing it right the first time will help to eliminate the weight coming back and more.
oAH71drxaa	You can but they will almost certainly not remove your tonsils. All though it used to be very common to remove tonsils unless the problem is severe and persistent they won't remove them as they help fight infection. If its felt the tonsilitus is quite bad they may give you a course of anti-biotics. Before going to the doctor its probably best to drink lots, rest and take vitmains first.

AA10101711	My husband and I just purchased a Teeter Hang Ups table for 399 and set it up yesterday...it's the coolest thing! We have obviously not had it enough to feel all of the benefits, but so far so good. When inverted, you can feel your back stretching (it feels good) and when you get up, your posture is better even after 10 min. on the table...granted, I don't know how long this good posture lasts, but if you do it every day for 10 min. then I am confident that it will improve dramatically. I like it, and I can't find anything bad about it so far.

Well, if you have a bad case of blackheads that BHA and AHA over-the-counter products would get rid of, you might want to turn to topical retinoids. Dematologists say topical retinoids are the best blackhead solution. But they involve a doctor's prescription.<br>  <br>  Retinoids are Vitamin A derivatives you can use to unblock oil gland pores. They're especially effective on black and whiteheads. Topical retinoids unclog pores, allowing other topical medications - like antibiotics - to enter the hair shaft and fight underlying infection. Topical retinoids also work to reduce outbreaks by preventing dead cells from clogging pores. Side effects of topical retinoids include sunlight sensitivity and dry, red or peeling skin.

YiY9Yd2Jaa	Yes, it would help. Also regular washing with a baby shampoo rather than using a "conditioner" style shampoo would be beneficial. Testosterone on the skin surface is what causes baldness. The baby shampoo thing help guys who don't have your problem by not saturating the hair with conditioning oils, allowing it to absorb more of the testosterone containing oiliness from the scalp.  Testosterone damages the hair follicle, not the hair itself. <br>  <br>  Regular very firm blood flow stimulating massage will also help further, several minutes a day, probably while you are shampooing.<br>  <br>  BTW, I realise that you need a testosterone supplement, but is there an option for a method that doesn't use a gel? I would look into doing it if such an option exists.

c9c6728a1851854f18d400e7f8246eecaa	Good for you, I have been a qualified D/N for more years than I  can remember and I still really enjoy my job!  The best place to start is with your local surgery, give them a call and ask if they have a trainee position available.  Once you find yourself a position you will need to get yourself on a course as you now need to be qualified/registered with the General Dental Council in order to work as a D/N and the only way you can register is to pass the National Exam for d/ns or the NVQ level 3 in oral health care.  If you take the national exam you will not be classed as fully qualified until you have done 2 years chairside experience, you will not be able to register but you can continue to work and you will not be able to use the title "Dental Nurse" you would be known as a Dental Assistant.  The only way you will get experience is to actually be working in a clinical enviroment.  Hope this has been of some help and good luck, keep us posted and let me know of your lucky enough to find something! xx|`|7mhqRhJKaa	Ask your dentist, or their dental nurse.|`|6aw3naCNaa	Look for any jobs advertised for Dental Nurse.

I'm not entirely sure on the exact percentage but it is supposed to be effective something like 90% of the time.  Also, the only side effect I got is for about 2 months after I used it my breasts would get extra sore before my period and for about 2 weeks instead of the usual 1.  Oh and my first period after I took it was a little shorter than usual.  Sorry if that's TMI but I thought it would be helpful since I was a little nervous after I read the package insert.  Hope it works for you, good luck!!|`|pzUikxR3aa	it worked well for me.  the sooner you take it the better it works but you can take it up to 72 hours after.  the only side effect i had was my period came a little sooner than expected.|`|3c0J1meGaa	I've used it a couple of times and its worked for me so far....
mTwn8p79aa	Could be deadly strep throat, could be a bad cold.    How high's the fever and how long have the symptoms been going on?  If the fever's under 102 and the symptoms have only been going on for a day or maybe two I wouldn't worry too much yet.  Over two days (with the bad symptoms, not the sore throat started on Wed. last week) or 102.5 I'd get to the doctor.    To make you feel better, strep isn't usually as bad as a lot of people are telling you.  A healthy person can get over most cases without even getting meds.  Only very rare strains of the bacteria are dangerous for an average person.    This is probably just a nasty cold.  Is there a runny or stuffy nose?  That'd be a good sign that it's not strep and there'd be no sense in going to a doctor over a virus as they can't do anything to help you anyway.

pvYy6iTSaa	Hi chasingcars -     What is Multiple Sclerosis?    An unpredictable disease of the central nervous system, multiple sclerosis (MS) can range from relatively benign to somewhat disabling to devastating, as communication between the brain and other parts of the body is disrupted.  Many investigators believe MS to be an autoimmune disease -- one in which the body, through its immune system, launches a defensive attack against its own tissues. In the case of MS, it is the nerve-insulating myelin that comes under assault. Such assaults may be linked to an unknown environmental trigger, perhaps a virus.     Most people experience their first symptoms of MS between the ages of 20 and 40; the initial symptom of MS is often blurred or double vision, red-green color distortion, or even blindness in one eye.  Most MS patients experience muscle weakness in their extremities and difficulty with coordination and balance.  These symptoms may be severe enough to impair walking or even standing. In the worst cases, MS can produce partial or complete paralysis.  Most people with MS also exhibit paresthesias, transitory abnormal sensory feelings such as numbness, prickling, or "pins and needles" sensations.  Some may also experience pain.  Speech impediments, tremors, and dizziness are other frequent complaints. Occasionally, people with MS have hearing loss. Approximately half of all people with MS experience cognitive impairments such as difficulties with concentration, attention, memory, and poor judgment, but such symptoms are usually mild and are frequently overlooked.  Depression is another common feature of MS.     Is there any treatment?    There is as yet no cure for MS. Many patients do well with no therapy at all, especially since many medications have serious side effects and some carry significant risks.  However, three forms of beta interferon (Avonex, Betaseron, and Rebif) have now been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of relapsing-remitting MS. Beta interferon has been shown to reduce the number of exacerbations and may slow the progression of physical disability. When attacks do occur, they tend to be shorter and less severe.  The FDA also has approved a synthetic form of myelin basic protein, called copolymer I (Copaxone), for the treatment of relapsing-remitting MS. Copolymer I has few side effects, and studies indicate that the agent can reduce the relapse rate by almost one third. An immunosuppressant treatment, Novantrone (mitoxantrone), is approved by the FDA for the treatment of advanced or chronic MS.     One monoclonal antibody, natalizumab (Tysabri), was shown in clinical trials to significantly reduce the frequency of attacks in people with relapsing forms of MS and was approved for marketing by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2004.  However, in 2005 the drugs manufacturer voluntarily suspended marketing of the drug after several reports of significant adverse events.  In 2006, the FDA again approved sale of the drug for MS but under strict treatment guidelines involving infusion centers where patients can be monitored by specially trained physicians.      While steroids do not affect the course of MS over time, they can reduce the duration and severity of attacks in some patients.  Spasticity, which can occur either as a sustained stiffness caused by increased muscle tone or as spasms that come and go, is usually treated with muscle relaxants and tranquilizers such as baclofen, tizanidine, diazepam, clonazepam, and dantrolene. Physical therapy and exercise can help preserve remaining function, and patients may find that various aids -- such as foot braces, canes, and walkers -- can help them remain independent and mobile.  Avoiding excessive activity and avoiding heat are probably the most important measures patients can take to counter physiological fatigue.  If psychological symptoms of fatigue such as depression or apathy are evident, antidepressant medications may help.  Other drugs that may reduce fatigue in some, but not all, patients include amantadine (Symmetrel), pemoline (Cylert), and the still-experimental drug aminopyridine. Although improvement of optic symptoms usually occurs even without treatment, a short course of treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone (Solu-Medrol) followed by treatment with oral steroids is sometimes used.     hat is the prognosis?    A physician may diagnose MS in some patients soon after the onset of the illness. In others, however, doctors may not be able to readily identify the cause of the symptoms, leading to years of uncertainty and multiple diagnoses punctuated by baffling symptoms that mysteriously wax and wane.  The vast majority of patients are mildly affected, but in the worst cases, MS can render a person unable to write, speak, or walk.  MS is a disease with a natural tendency to remit spontaneously, for which there is no universally effective treatment.       What research is being done?    The Nat|`|XhIYAH6Laa	Well I am not going to copy and paste info like most people for this question. Multiple Sclerosis is a diagnoses from process of elimination. There are so many different symptoms that you can't tell by symptoms alone. The most accurate testing that is done is an MRI. Usually a person with MS has lesions on the brain and/or cervical spine.     Basically your body attacks the myelin surrounding your nerves, causing your symptoms.     There are different types of MS and not everyone ends up in a wheelchair or equivalent. There are many different therapies available including daily self injections, IV meds, and transfusions.     You should also look into the MS society's website. It is very informative and can give text book definitions of the disease and personal stories. Good Luck on your report!|`|WseLyvSpaa	It's an auto-immune disorder:  Your immune system attacks your own nervous system.|`|37jwcHAjaa	Multiple sclerosis is in essence a neurological disease causing long term disability. It is an autoimmune disease affecting the myelin producing cells. Myelin is like insulator of a nerve which is a conductor of information as electrical impulses like a electric wire insulator. It is interesting to note that it follows rules of M. Multiple sclerosis is a Myelin disease with multiplicity of clinical presentation affecting multiple levels of brain, needing MRI to diagnose using McDonald's criteria treated by modulation of immunity by drugs.|`|6coPZY71aa	im doing a repot for health and social care on m.s. plus my mum has m.s. visit   www.mssociety.org.uk  its a brilliant website to find out information and my mums chairpairson of one of the branches in northern ireland.    Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is the most common disabling neurological condition affecting young adults. Around 85,000 people in the UK have MS.    MS is the result of damage to myelin - a protective sheath surrounding nerve fibres of the central nervous system.    When myelin is damaged, this interferes with messages between the brain and other parts of the body.    For some people, MS is characterised by periods of relapse and remission while for others it has a progressive pattern. For everyone, it makes life unpredictable.     i hope this helps!|`|jqYpMCXmaa	Multiple sclerosis (abbreviated MS, also known as disseminated sclerosis or encephalomyelitis disseminata) is an autoimmune condition in which the immune system attacks the central nervous system, leading to demyelination. Disease onset usually occurs in young adults, and it is more common in females. MS affects the ability of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord to communicate with each other. Nerve cells communicate by sending electrical signals called action potentials down long fibers called axons, which are wrapped in an insulating substance called myelin. In MS, the body's own immune system attacks and damages the myelin. When myelin is lost, the axons can no longer effectively conduct signals.     Some symptomseffects of MS are:   difficulty in walking   abnormal sensations such as numbness or a feeling of "pins and needles"   pain and loss of vision due to optic neuritis (inflammation of the optic nerve)   dizziness and vertigo   dysphagia (difficulty in swallowing)   headache   hearing problems   itching   seizures   loss of sexuality or sexual problems   spasticity (stiffness)   tremor   incoordination (lack or loss of coordination)   slurred speech or other speech disorders   sudden onset of paralysis, similar to a stroke   a decline in cognitive function, the inability to think, reason, and remember

C7ClEJ7Baa	What you're doing sounds good. I would suggest that you ONLY drink water. You'll need to drink 1/2 your body weight in oz, ex if you weigh 100lbs, drink 50oz of water.     I did that and lost all my unwanted weight. You should drink about a litre of water before each meal.    I hope this helps.    Chris
ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|wXKs94nDaa	eat 1200 - 1500 calories per day and workout.|`|46StihsPaa	http://www.mycelebritydietblog.net/index...

You prob don't have much muscle so you will lose weight rather quickly....  Try this:  Walk 30 min everyday increase your distance and speed as you can  start out at a comfortable pace but not lazy.  Move your arms so you can get as much of your body into it as possible.  Be sure to do some stretches both before and after so you wont be too sore and not want to do it anymore.  Simple stretches like trying to touch your toes, spread your legs and try to touch the floor between your legs. Count to 10 slowly while holding your position.  Lunge stretches are good too.  Also sit on the floor and touch your toes.    You want to stop drinking pop! Drink lots of water!  If you don't like plain water try Propel its flavored water with few calories.  NO MORE junk food!  If you need something sweet eat yogurt...You can freeze it and its like ice creame!  Fruits and Vegies are your friend!  Try and stay away from breads too!    Salads are really good just don't go overboard on cheese and dressing.  You'll think your going to starve and prob crave everything thats bad for you, Just remember what you want to look like and how good you are going to feel!    If you need a snack try an apple or peanuts.  Eat throughout the day but eat your apples, peanuts (protein), stuff like that.  Read the lables of the stuff you think you want...if it sounds bad it IS!  Once you get to where you are walking easily at an increased pased and your not dying when you do this you can increase the time you go.  Yoga and palites are really good at getting your muscles stretched and toned. Plus you can do these in your home.    I hope this helps!  Good Luck!|`|JoIyi9gsaa	lol are you for real? * Because, while 185 is still fat, I am one good looking fat person. I know, it is rare *  get a life....    Well your youth will make it relatively easy for you to lose weight.  At my biggest i was 150 pounds and am now 123. And it was all down to my treadmill!  Running for me has worked better than any diet, ( even though i did diet while doing it, which just made it doubly effective ) you can burn around 100 calories in just 10 mins so....    For you I would suggest you eat around 1500calories a day to begin with. Now its not always how much you eat, but what you eat that is the key. My rule which made me go down the fastest was to cut out wheat and ANY refined sugar! that's all. I lost 5 pound in one week doing just that.    plenty water is key and and the more you run, the better.  Don't go mad though, begin with running and walking on the road ( if you cant get to a treadmill ) for 30 minutes a day and lightly tonning your stomach area.|`|hDB84Etyaa	first off change your eating habits, um, eat three meals a day, no more no less, and second have lots of activities, and i dont mean arts and crafts, i mean sports.
JBLcMQ9haa	Do your eyes tend to get dry at night? Do they water? Symptoms of Dry eye is itchy, watery eyes. I know that sounds funny that you get watery eyes when you have dry eyes, but it is true. When your eyes are dry, they itch and your eyes freak out and produce tears. There are two good over-the-counter drops that you can buy at any local drug store or grocery store called Systane or Optive. They can be used to rewet the eyes. If you wear contacts, you might want to start taking your contacts our earlier in the day, and put your glasses on. If not, then just use these drops. Alot of people think of using Visine...but Visine only removes redness from the eyes. I would try using these drops.

hsEo77F9aa	Yes, it is possible for there to be a delay between ingesting a food-borne pathogen and the onset of symptoms.     Most cases of "food-poisoning" present symptoms within a few hours, but can take more than a day. This can depend on the amount of pathogen ingested as well as biological factors in the patient. In some rare cases it can actually take months or even years for symptoms of "food poisoning to occur", as in the case with Listeriosis or Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease.    Chances are --- if you are correct in your assertion that you got poisoned by this one particular meal---your partner would have shown symptoms already. Or his immune system might have been able to take care of the dose of pathogen he may have received.    It is also possible that the symptoms you were experiencing were not related to food poisoning at all. But yes, in a few rare cases the incubation period can be up to a week, and in the most rare of cases with specific infections it can take years.|`|iJPHtr0Jaa	4 hours|`|yuOuoCfDaa	Dont think so......if that's the case I would question your digestive system.

PeMpDAbraa	I get cysts often. The dr has never done anything about them. They grow and then dissipate. I have had a few bust and they felt like a very sharp, painful, and quick menstrual cramp. Then I leaked fluid and bled a little. Your body may not react like mine though so..I don't know. They can remove them if they are painful to you or cause other issues but they can just grow back.      Definition of Ovarian Cysts  An ovarian cyst is a sac or pouch that develops in or on the ovary. The cysts may contain liquid, or solid material or a combination of both.     Ovarian cysts are very common, particularly in women between the ages of 30 and 60. They may be single or multiple, and can occur in one or both ovaries. Most are benign (non-cancerous), but approximately 15 percent are malignant (cancerous).     Description of Ovarian Cysts  During ovulation (the process during which the egg ripens and is released from the ovary) the ovary produces a hormone to make the follicles (sacs containing immature eggs and fluid) grow and the eggs within it mature.     Once the egg is ready, the follicle ruptures and the egg is released. Once the egg is released, the follicle changes into a smaller sac called the corpus luteum. Ovarian cysts occur as a result of the follicle not rupturing, the follicle not changing into its smaller size, or doing the rupturing itself.     There are five (5) common types of ovarian cysts: functional cysts, polycystic ovaries, endometrial cysts, cystadenomas and dermoid cysts.     Functional Cysts     There are two types of functional cysts - follicle cyst and corpus luteum cyst. Both of these types of cysts develop as part of the natural function of the ovary.     Follicle Cyst. This cyst occurs during ovulation when an egg is released into the fallopian tube or when a developing follicle fails to rupture. These cysts grow from 1? inches to 2 inches in diameter, and will usually dissolve within one to three months.     Corpus Luteum Cyst. This cyst is caused by a malfunction of the corpus luteum. Unless a woman is pregnant, the corpus luteum disintegrates. But in the formation of a corpus luteum cyst, it fills with fluid and remains in the ovary.     Polycystic Ovaries     Polycystic ovaries (also known as polycystic ovarian syndrome or disease) is a condition in which the follicles never erupt from the ovaries.     Under normal circumstances, follicles grow, mature, and rise to the surface of the ovary, where they burst and release an egg to the Fallopian tube, a process controlled by pituitary hormones. The remnants of the burst follicle then begin to produce progesterone, which stimulates the lining of the uterus (endometrium) to grow thicker in case it needs to support a fertilized egg. The effect on the pituitary of an increase in progesterone production is to signal it to stop stimulating the development of eggs.     In polycystic ovaries, the follicles grow just under the ovaries' surface, and are produced again and again because the pituitary has not been signaled to shut off. Both ovaries become filled with tiny cysts and can become enlarged.     Endometrial Cysts     Endometrial cysts (also known as endometriomas or "chocolate cysts" (filled with dark blood)) form as a result of endometriosis. Endometriosis is a disease in which the endometrial tissue normally found in the uterus grows in other areas. After successive menstrual cycles, this misplaced endometrial tissue bleed, gradually forming endometrial cysts. Over time the cysts grow and can become as large as a grapefruit.     Cystadenomas     Cystadenomas are known as neoplasms (new growths). Ovarian neoplasms are new and abnormal formations that develop from the ovarian tissue. There are two (2) types of cystadenomas - serous and mucinous.     Serous cystadenoma is filled with a thin watery fluid and can grow to be between 2 inches to 6 inches in diameter.     Mucinous cystadenoma is filled with a sticky, thick gelatinous material and can grow to be between 6 inches to 12 inches in diameter. There have been rare cases where the cyst measured 40 inches in diameter and weighed over 100 pounds.     Dermoid Cysts     Dermoid cysts are also known as ovarian neoplasms and consist of skin or related tissue such as hair, teeth or bone instead of fluid like the cystadenomas. Dermoid cysts develop from the ovary's germ cells (cells that produce the egg and the beginnings of all human tissues). Dermoid cysts may be present at birth but are not noticed until adulthood. They generally measure between 2 inches to 4 inches in diameter.   Symptoms of Ovarian Cysts  Cysts may grow quietly and go unnoticed until they are found on routine examination. However, if they are ruptured (by sexual intercourse, injury or childbirth) and/or become large enough, the following symptoms may occur:     Intense abdominal pain (symptom in all types of cysts)     Menstrual changes such as late periods, bleeding between periods or irregular periods (symptom occurring in corpus luteum cysts and polycystic ovaries)     Heavy menstrual flow (symptom occurring in polycystic ovaries)     Infertility (symptom occurring in polycystic ovaries and endometrial cysts)     Internal bleeding (symptom occurring in endometrial cysts)     Severe menstrual cramps (symptom occurring in endometrial cysts)     Pain with sexual intercourse (symptom occurring in endometrial cysts)     Pain during a bowel movement (symptom occurring in endometrial cysts)     Weight gain (symptom occurring in polycystic ovaries and endometrial cysts)     If a cyst becomes twisted, the woman may experience spasmodic pain. Sudden or sharp pain may mean a cyst has ruptured. The twisting or rupture of a cyst may increase the likel|`|Qh2rc1DNaa	It's perfectly normal to have ovarian cysts. A lot of women have them.  I am not sure what the nurse meant by "cramped follicles"    Read this site : http://www.4woman.gov/faq/ovarian-cysts....  Then relax til you see your doc.  A lot of times they will put you on birth control to help manage the cysts.

pfm0wcEIaa	Yes, food intolerances.    Celiac Disease, a form of Gluten intolerance, is known to cause weight loss and a series of other uncomfortable symptoms.  If you have Celiac Disease they should be able to know from doing an endoscopy.  But don't be so sure...I have a Gluten intolerance and many symptoms associated with Celiac Disease and all my tests came out negative.  This is because if you get the endoscopy done and you have not eaten Gluten your intestines may not show the injury associated with this condition.    A gluten free diet is good for everyone.  Just make sure you stop eating Gluten after you get the endoscopy done.  That way you can have a better idea of what is going on.  Even if you don't have Celiac Disease going on a Gluten free diet may be good for you because Gluten is difficult to digest even for normal people.    Also doing an intestinal/colon cleanse may be helpful.  But you might have to wait until you feel at little better for that.|`|ojEkgJoqaa	a gastoenterologist is the best bet.    the endoscopy will see your actual stomach to see if there are problems there first. there are other tests that can be done too.    i wouldn't listen to the other doctors they are dismissing your problems    it isn't normal to lose weight even with the symptoms you are decribing    the gastroenterolist is the doctor that specializes in your g.i system    i have had similar problems and went from doctor to doctor and even gi doctors too.    i had many tests and they found out what was wrong with me.i lost over 60 pounds and was having terrible pains nauseaus all the time and sick    best bet g i doctor    can't diagnose you but the gastroenterologist will be able to.|`|6SB4ufEYaa	Could be food intolerances.

AA10815212	The best way to address this sort of a report and grasp the information is to draw a diagram...as cardiologists usually do.      This patient has had at least two bypasses both of which are working, though the one that feeds the LAD (Left Anterior Descending) runs into a 75-80% blockage as soon as it feeds that artery.  I am not certain but I think it is very hard to advance angioplasty equipment down the left internal mammary artery (LIMA) to potentially open the 80% blockage it feeds in the LAD.    The circumflex system (Circ 1, Circ 2, Marginal) has a number of hemodynamically significant lesions that all could potentially be stented via angioplasty.    The RCA bypass is working and needs no attention.    That said, it is unlikely that any intervention would be advised if symptoms were not driving it (severe angina).  It may even make sense to not do anything and send the patient to cardiac rehab (or an equivlent).  If the heart has on-going need for additional oxygenated blood, it will grow its own collateral circulation around blockages.    Obviously this needs to be discussed with your cardiologist.  If you are not getting an adequate explanation with the cardiologist you are working with, find one who can speak in terms you understand.    I hope this helps.  Good luck.

Artificial breasts are a real turn off for me.|`|dG57cG5Raa	any **** are good ****|`|ayx9WFYYaa	Small and natural.  Besides, breast enhancement surgery often damages the nerves in the breast, so that the woman loses  sensitivity in that area.|`|RtmfVevbaa	Natural looking fakes one!!!!!

So like i said small and natural
UL3XOKJxaa	Not sure what you are asking. Would you care to elaborate?
T3DqZOG7aa	since not all infections in that area are caused by std's, it may be some sort of bacterial infection.    go see the doctor.|`|ec76af399c519dad926a10430304f541aa	do you ever get cold sores on your mouth?  if you do, you could have given yourself herpes, cuz that is what a cold sore is.  You touch your mouth then touch yourself down there and presto, you have genital herpes.  Suggest you see a doctor while you still have the sore, cuz he can tell you what it is then, if you wait and the sore goes away, they can't tell.|`|v0GwTTsVaa	More than likely you have an infected hair.  Just tell your mom.  She's probably gotten something like that in her life time.  Don't worry it's not caused by masterbation.|`|oy7mNHJNaa	It could be caused by a vaginal infection such as a yeast or general bacterial infection.  You don't have to be sexually active to get these.  I would talk to your mom about it and get it taken care of.  It can't be pleasant.|`|RZI5fgy9aa	go to a doctor|`|LbGRsCTKaa	It might be a clogged pore or a gland.  Try hot compresses on it.   It's nothing serious, I'm sure.

YOu will be fine, just talk to a doctor.|`|aMHIA7XMaa	Masturbation will not cause that.... Talk to your mom/doctor.|`|krI2fziJaa	Sounds like a yeast infection.

That will hurt, too.|`|dpCsTIEIaa	could just be an ingrown hair...You shouldn't feel ashamed to talk to your mom or your doctor about this...trust me they have seen and heard worse.|`|94919056dbd2381993965ac48f8fd091aa	If it is on the actual skin part of down there it may just be an ingrown hair, this happens from wearing tight pants or underpants or rubbing down there too much. These are usually red and a little big and really hurt  to touch. Try looking to see if there is a hair in the middle of the sore, if there is  get a tweezers, pull it out, and wash the area. Since you have never had sex I would guess thats all it is.    Also try putting a washcloth with hot water on it. It might help. You can sometimes almost get like a "pimple" in that area.|`|60a3bbdca78e74fb19db426e27b9a087aa	ABSOLUTELY NO it can not be from masturbation. Please get that deranged idea out of your head.

This probably isnt anything really major, and NO you didnt give it to yourself through masturbation!!  A gland or a hair follicle might have gotten infected or something, especially since youve never had sex.  If you can get to your doc I would do it...  no one on the internet is going to be able to tell you accurately what is going on, ok?  I know it can make you feel weird about yourself, but really, women get these things...  it isnt a reflection of how clean you are or what kind of a person you are or anything like that.  It just happens, neither good nor bad.  Your doc would probably be bound by confidentiality not to tell your mom if you asked her not to as well.  Dont sweat it, but dont ignore it either.  Hang in there, its going to be ok!|`|5YYzUgf7aa	talk to your mom about it... you might need to see a doctor it might be an infected hair or even a gland problem

Q6ij5yJBaa	im guessing you play sports like me and i HAD the same problem so now i use proactiv for my face and keep acne and pimple wash in the shower for my back it is all pretty much clearing up now hope i helped|`|MGyWa0yUaa	If you want to get rid of back acne, wash regularly. Use an anti-bacterial soap, and try for washing twice a day. Be careful not to over-wash, though, because this can irritate your skin and dry it out. It is also important to shower as soon as possible after any activity that has caused excessive perspiration. When perspiration gets trapped against your skin, it can mix with oils and further clog your pores, which will exacerbate your back acne. This is not good.Exfoliate on a daily to weekly basis to help get rid of dead skin cells that can worsen back acne. Because the skin on your back is thicker than the skin on your face, this is generally safe to do. Experiment with different types of exfoliators - washcloths, loofahs, brushes - and watch your skin for any worsening of the acne or extreme irritation. If you use a scrub, try a sugar-based one rather than one with salt - this will be milder on your skin. Also, reduce the number of times you exfoliate if you notice any bad reactions.Use a medicated cream or gel like benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid if you are going to get rid of back acne. It is best to choose one or the other of these, however, because they can interact negatively with each other if mixed. If you use a benzoyl peroxide (bp) product (some experts have found this to work better than salicylic acid), try to find one with 2.5% bp - this dose has been effective for many people. Apply to your back about ten minutes after washing, twice a day. Be sure you allow time for drying, as these medicated gels can have a bleaching effect and damage clothing. Also, because both benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid tend to be drying, it is good to follow up with an alpha-hydroxy moisturizer.To help get rid of back acne, keep your fabrics clean. This includes towels, pillowcases, bedsheets, t-shirts and bras - and anything else you can think of that might touch your back. Dirty stuff attracts bacteria, and bacteria is really good at starting back acne, so...laundry day might have to happen more often. If you're anything like me, this may be a challenge. In that case, good luck. To avoid the possibility of irritation, be sure that your detergents and fabric softeners are hypoallergenic. Natural food stores are good places to find products that are environmentally friendly and chemical free.If nothing seems to get rid of your back acne, see a dermatologist. As I mentioned before, back acne is tough to deal with. You should usually give any new skin regimen at least a few weeks before quitting (unless there's irritation), but sometimes nothing you try will give you the results you want. Seek help, too, if you find that you are overly anxious, have low self-esteem or experience depression. There are several back acne treatments that a dermatologist will be able to offer that could make a huge difference for you.|`|BeqBUU41aa	go to your GP/doctor and they can prescribe cream/gel etc. that should make them go away. The prescription drugs are stronger and more effective than normal off the shelf ones.|`|Iz0RSDX5aa	everybody had always told me to just wash my face and make sure i dont eat food that's too fatty but I think we know that that doesn't always work. my mom got me this product called clear pores from this website,  http://b3po.net/clearpores , and i didn't really wanna try it out but it worked out pretty well, i gotta say. the thing i liked about it was that it actually manages to prevent the acne, not just clearing up what's already there.|`|Rgbhm8dSaa	Scratch them, and when they are picked rub rubbing alchohol on all of them. Then every day rub it on there.  It kills all bacteria but makes rlly dry.

Maybe it's just a change in your diet or exercise. You def aren't pregnant though. If you are really concerned I'd say go to the doctors. You don't even have to tell them about the fingering, cause its not considered "sexual intercourse" us that's what you were worried about. and I dont think it could effect it all. I think its just a phase. You're prob fine though. :)|`|QNWKGYNmaa	this happened to me on my fourth i think, only i wasn't fingering...  it's been forever and i was fine. relax.|`|9618f0ff34ec090e002143ca8ff861fcaa	If you didn't have intercourse, then you're not pregnant. If you're young then it will take a while for your periods to get on a normal schedule. Trust me I know.
WGFtXo6Paa	I get rashes from strawberries. I also get red cheeks that look like rosacea. I get it from eating sour-ish food, such as strawberries (which give me the worst rashes). My dermatologist says it's nothing bad. I get rashes that look like keratosis pilaris on my arms. Go on Google and search keratosis pilaris. If she has a rash like that, nothing to worry about.|`|96bVAlCxaa	just me .. our daughter is not here with us reading this.. and we havent Freaked out about it in front of her.  so thanks for the non-help retard!|`|dqnccslNaa	Well for one.. She is a kid. And a very young one. So of course she is going to have an amazing appetite and constant hunger. It is normal.    The rashes from citric acids are usually genetic. Meaning yes. if it runs in your family. Then she will inherit that problem. But it doesn't exactly mean there is a problem to begin with. Rashes from Citric Acids often come from lack of water. Id recommend her to drink more on a daily basis. Infact... most health problems come from simply being dehydrated. So stay hydrated in the heat. And remember. Some foods can dehydrate you if thats all you eat. Make sure you drink a lot of water daily. It will improve your health and make you feel better.|`|ejrxNVD1aa	ekkkk this is long|`|KOecCLjLaa	rash could have been from any number of things she could be allergic to, so I wouldn't outright blame the strawberries or the cat, lol..|`|D9I64wsaaa	Both of your speculations could be possible. I believe new allergies can develope every 7-10 years, and sometimes even 1-2. It just depends on the person. Give her a children's dose of benadryl and see what happens.... that's what I always take (in the adult dose) when I get allergic reactions like that.|`|13ZMylCzaa	Oh jeez....can you calm the hell down please? I'd be more worried about the psychological damage your hysterics and hypochondria are inflicting on your daughter than a simple rash that even your doctor seems unconcerned about.
AA12335331	Right now at 12 you need to masturbate as often as you want, feel the need and can find the privacy to do it.  It is normal, healthy for you and it is good for you physically and emotionally.  It is not harmful and it is not sinful.  You feel depressed do to the reaction to the endorphines that are secreted during orgasm.  That is a normal reaction but do not let it bother you.  After you orgasm take a few minutes to just stay still and relax and you will feel better soon.  You should lay off of the porn.

5qFmukWwaa	Don't reject this right off the bat, but you do need to find a good counselor.  We can't get past these things without objective help.  I too fight depression and if I didn't have to go to work to pay bills I would stay in the house 24/7.  If you are disillusioned with humanity try some volunteer work.  People who work at a food bank or volunteer at habitat for humanity are not doing it for fame, glory or reward of any kind. Try to be around these types of positive people. <br>  <br>  I just started counseling and while I have a long way to go I feel positive about the process.  I can tell you that it is so much easier to discuss these things with someone who is objective and nonjudgmental.  <br>  <br>  Most of all, don't give up!|`|ruamFLoiaa	Whew, I don't know many folks who would like your view of reality.

7bf43d487015d45e6264f26c5f6c6374aa	A few ideas...<br>  <br>  *First, talk to your doctor about your anxiety.  He could recommend anything from vitamins, a change in diet, medication, or counseling.  It's always good to get an evaluation by a medical professional so you know what you're dealing with, and gain some insight as to help the situation.<br>  <br>  *Read before bed.  Read comfortable "feel-good" books that you enjoy.  They put you in a happier mind frame, and the reading itself makes you tired and can put you to sleep.  (Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood, Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants, Little Women, Heidi, Where the Heart Is...all good.)<br>  <br>  *Have a radio or TV in your room that you can leave on low as you go to sleep.  The music, or conversation from the TV may put your mind at a little more ease, and keep you comforted.'<br>  <br>  *Before bed, DON'T drink caffeine (coffee or soda), don't eat greasy foods, don't watch scary movies/shows, or read scary stories, etc.<br>  <br>  *Try to relax as much as possible before actual bedtime.  A hot bath (or shower), a good book, a favorite movie, a phone call with a friend; any of these can be great at helping ease your mood.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!

MhpccWpmaa	You sound like you have bacterial vaginitis.  The symptoms are a strong fishy-like odor and whitish-grayish watery discharge (which is often described as milky).  There are no over the counter treatments for this however, so the only way to get rid of it is to go to the doctors.  I would advise making an appointment closer to now for a couple reasons.  One, I know the odor makes you feel self conscious, believe me I've been there.  And two, if left untreated for a long amount of time it can cause pelvic inflammatory disease.  But don't be embarassed.  This infection is more common in women than yeast infections are.  The doctor will prescribe you Flagyl which is a pill you take twice a day for a week and clears it up.  The smell usaully disappears after a couple days on the medicine but make sure you take the complete treatment or else the infection will not go away.  Other than that things you can do to try and avoid it in the future are don't wash with soap down there instead use only warm water or a feminine wash that is soap free formulated for intimate cleansing such as summers eve, eat yogurt with live and active cultures every day, wear looser pants, wear cotton underwear, make sure to wash as well as urinate after intercourse, and NEVER douche.  Douching is bad for you.  If you feel the need to use a product called repHresh which has similar effects but is safe to use as it balances out the pH inside of your vagina.  Hope I helped and good luck!|`|kD8iggyCaa	maybe you have ejaculated and it is your ovum!|`|jaGU3zyyaa	There are over the counter medications for vaginitis and yeast infections, if you want to try something before seeing a doctor.

0TT5q0cUaa	Pertussis, commonly known as "whooping cough," is an infection of the respiratory tract caused by the Bordetella pertussis bacteria. This infection is very contagious and can be quite serious. It affects the respiratory system and produces spasms of coughing that usually end in a high-pitched sound with deep inspiration (the whoop). People become infected with the bacteria by inhaling contaminated droplets from an infected person's cough or sneeze. Once inside the airways, pertussis bacteria produce chemical substances or toxins that interfere with the respiratory tract's normal ability to eliminate germs. Pertussis bacteria also produce chemicals that cause inflammation that damage the lining of the breathing passages. <br>  <br>  Pertussis can be prevented by the pertussis vaccine, which is part of the DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis) or DTP immunizations. These important immunizations are routinely given in five doses before a child's sixth birthday. The pertussis vaccine has dramatically decreased the number of cases of whooping cough that occur and saved countless lives. Preventive oral antibiotics should be given to anyone who lives in the same household as someone with pertussis.|`|wDCjzuPraa	Whooping cough can affect anyone of any age. The main symptom is bouts of intense coughing. In between bouts of coughing you can be perfectly well. Sometimes hours go by between bouts of coughing. Whooping cough can be a distressing illness which usually lasts several weeks. Full recovery is usual, but serious complications occur in some cases. Whooping cough is uncommon in children in the UK, mainly due to immunisation. However, some adults and older children get whooping cough because the effect of whooping cough immunisation can wane over time in some people.|`|SAfpu0DCaa	whooping cough is a viral disease caused by hemophillus pertussis. it is also known as whooping cough because of the sound it make when a doctor check the chest of the patient with a sthetoscope. in this generation no more serious case have been reported due to this disease because of the vaccine
VnLaUS3Jaa	alcohol hangs around your waist and is difficult to rid of.<br>  <br>  also, if you are weight training, you are likely to maintain your weight - - or even gain weight. (MUSCLE WEIGHS MORE THAN FAT)<br>  <br>  let me give you my personal story:<br>  <br>  when i started working out, i weighed a very flabby 170 and was a size 14.<br>  <br>  after a year, i went down to a size 4 and weighed 155. i only lost 15 pounds, but was less than half my size!!<br>  <br>  there was a time i was feeling discouraged just like you are, but really what was going on was the fat was being replaced with muscle... and it was so gradual that during the first few months i didn't see many changes because the muscle i was adding was compensating for the fat that was once there. it was just so internal that i couldn't visibly see it through the fat that was still there.<br>  <br>  ultimately, though, you will start seeing the changes you want. don't give up. <br>  <br>  there are lots of changes going on INTERNALLY that you can't see EXTERNALLY yet - - but you WILL around the six month mark if you stay dedicated.<br>  <br>  i'm glad i kept pushing and didn't allow myself to get discouraged... now i have not only achieved my goals, but i now make my living helping other people achieve their fitness goals.<br>  <br>  hope this helps! again, please don't give up!!<br>  <br>  and no disrespect to shay s, but don't give up dairy. women really need dairy for proper female organ function and to prevent brittle bones that could lead to osteoporosis.|`|5rJ6nf2oaa	That does seem odd if, as you say, your diet is otherwise good. Wine does contain a lot of calories, however with the amount of exercise you do I'd be surprised if it is due to alcohol.<br>  <br>  It may be that your liver is clogged and needs a clean out especially as your diet in the past was probably not good considering the weight you want to lose. When the liver is too burdened it can't do its usual fat burning job as efficiently and can take forever to lose excess weight.<br>  <br>  Try this diet for 8 weeks. Eliminate red meat, animal fats, dairy, and processed food or any kind. Replace it with mainly seafood, some chicken (no skin), lots of vegetables, salad and fruit, and pasta, rice and bread. Drink lots of water and try to have fresh raw veggie juice in the morning. There is more to the diet than that and I have attached some links for you to read, included is an example diet. I do this myself every year to shed the excess. It works very efficiently. Limit your total daily calorie intake to 1200-1400 and you should lose at least 1 -2 kg per week. Keep the wine if inside the calorie limit, but restrict it to one glass if you can, or even better none for the 8 weeks.<br>  <br>  Best wishes.
C7P4zoWUaa	The only way to lose weight is by cutting calories.  You can reduce the number of calories you're taking in each day by either consuming less, working out at the gym, or a combination of both.<br>  I've lost almost forty pounds in the last six months just but cutting calories.  I usually grab an apple or a To-Go Cereal Pack (90 calories) for breakfast.<br>  For lunch, I eat a 100 calorie snack pack.<br>  For dinner, I eat a 200-400 calorie TV dinner or a salad.<br>  In between, I eat two or three snacks every day.  Usually another 100 calorie snack pack, some fruit, or something low calorie and delicious like a Fudgie (40 calories.)<br>  I have limited exercise, but I've still managed to lose tons of weight and I honestly do not feel hungry.  It really hasn't been that bad and sometimes I go completely off and have a fun day.  :)  Eliminating calories is the only way.  Good luck!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  in response to "miamia":<br>  first of all:  no reason to say that so rudely!<br>  and also, with snacks, I stay around 1200 calories per day.<br>  I eat snacks instead of meals so I can control snacking throughout the entire day.<br>  and honestly, this is a perspective from someone who actually lost weight, so maybe you should get a clue.  :)|`|SpcYCBndaa	Simple formula:<br>  Eat less<br>  Do more<br>  <br>  ..............@@@~.............<br>  ................(o o)................      <br>  ==== ooO=(_)=Ooo=====<br>  <br>  Can I get ten points?<br>  Please<br>  Pretty Please<br>  Pretty Pretty Please<br>  Pretty Pretty Please with a cherry on the top<br>  You know you want to <br>  Go for it<br>  You can do it!<br>  -Thanks|`|o1rzGR8kaa	I come we work together|`|bhyVC2mtaa	um, victoria b? you don't have a clue. 100calories is not enough for a lunch!<br>  *Meals = 400-550 calories<br>  *Snacks = 150cal woman, 200cal for men<br>  <br>  Exercise for 1 hour a day or more.

Ur already have excuses to not workout. Losing weight isnt a 1 month diet thing, its a lifetime commitment. motivate ur self.|`|oymv7Sk4aa	waweewaaaaaaa|`|dJuEtGxraa	Here are a few tips;<br>  <br>  WHEN to eat for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? Eat (at least) three times a day. <br>  Because when you eat only once a day, your metabolism gets slower than it already is! That's the main reason. Sounds funny, but to lose weight... you must eat (the right things, of course) <br>  ? Eat low-fat, high-fiber foods such as salads and vegetable pastas.<br>  ? Your last meal should be before 18:00. Try. <br>  OK, one apple after 18:00 <br>  ? Don't starve <br>  Starvation is not good for losing weight, nor your health. <br>  Starvation is the worse thing you can do in a weight loss diet. <br>  ? Try oatmeal instead of cornflakes for breakfast--eating oatmeal can help reduce cholesterol levels, and its high fiber content will keep you full longer.<br>  <br>  WHAT to drink for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? Drink 6-8 glasses of water every day ! <br>  Can be tap, plain, mineral, sparkling. I just love mineral sparkling water! <br>  This improves your bowel, reduces the "hunger" sensation, and hydrates your skin. Your skin will look much better after the first weeks! <br>  Don't believe the slogan "water makes me fat". Beside being stupid... you might get into serious troubles with your kidneys. <br>  ? Drink ONLY natural juices, freshly squeezed! <br>  Don't drink Coca Cola, Pepsi, Spite etc. during the diet. Even lite or light versions. <br>  <br>  <br>  Exercise for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? If you want quicker results - exercise would be good. <br>  ? Don't just sit in front of the TV and eat peanuts... <br>  I guarantee THIS won't work for your weight loss... <br>  ? Start a regular exercise program and stick with it. Don't be afraid of those sweat suits and Lycra pants! <br>  ? Start swimming. Swimming is an excellent exercise to get involved with, since it increases blood flow and uses muscles we don't regularly use. Start a swimming program and try to do it 3 times a week. You will feel excellent and rejuvenated.<br>  ? Choose an exercise program that you enjoy, and don't shun the unconventional. For instance, did you know that regular vigorous dancing is exercise too?<br>  ? Also Cardiovascular exercises such as running, jogging, or aerobics will help you lose that unwanted belly fat. Weight training can also help you lose body fat because the more muscle mass you have, the more ability your system has to burn body fat.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  Hope this helps~|`|abXjEpDvaa	SOUP DIET.<br>  You lose 10+ pounds a week.<br>  They use it at hospitals for overweight patients and its amazing.<br>  <br>  Make the soup with 2 cans of stewed tomatoes, 3 large green onions, 1 large can of beef broth, 1 package of lipton chicken noodle soup mix, 1 bunch of celery, 2 cans of green beans, 2 lbs of carrots, 2 green peppers.<br>  It does not add calories at all<br>  <br>  All you can drink is unsweetened juice, tea, coffee, cranberry juice, and water.<br>  <br>  Day One:<br>  Eat any fruits except for bananas, eat only the fruit and soup on this day<br>  <br>  Day Two:<br>  Eat vegetables until you are stuffed, eat leafy veggies and stay away form beans, peas, and corn.

0TT5q0cUaa	oh my goodness it seems you had failed your elementry school biology test. heamoglobin cannot just simply leak out of your body.<br>  <br>  Electromagnetic radiation (waves) are produced by the motion of electrically charged particles and are so called because they radiate from the electrically charged particles. They are a stream of photons travelling at the speed of light and can travel through empty space as well as through air and other substances. Each photon contains a certain amount of energy. The only difference between the various types of electromagnetic radiation is the amount of energy found in the photons. Radio waves, microwaves, visible light, and x-rays are all examples of electromagnetic waves that differ from each other in wavelength. Radio waves have photons with low energies, microwaves have a little more energy than radio waves, infrared has still more, then visible, ultraviolet, X-rays, and the highest energy is in gamma-rays. <br>  <br>  Mobile phones use electromagnetic waves in the microwave range. The rate at which radiation is absorbed by the human body is measured by the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), and its maximum levels for modern handsets have been set by governmental regulating agencies in many countries which limit it to 1.6 W/kg for most parts of the body.<br>  <br>  Contradictory reports keep getting published regarding the health risks of electromagnetic radiation from mobile phones. Most epidemiological studies have not found any clear indication of short or medium term health hazards but there is extensive literature on non-thermal effects of weak microwave radiation on biological tissue in animal models. Animal studies have shown that it may affect the growth of certain tumours, cell death, increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier, DNA damage etc. which suggest the possibility of adverse health effects in humans.<br>  <br>  Thermal effect includes heating effect on the head surface. One study in Sweden suggested that continuous use of a mobile phone for a decade or longer can lead to a small increase in the probability of getting acoustic neuroma, a type of brain tumour but the overall effect was not statistically significant. Non-thermal effects include DNA damage, chromosomal alterations and enhanced cell division but not all studies have shown this.<br>  <br>  While research abounds and some tests have shown that cell phone radio frequency (RF) could accelerate cancer in laboratory animals, the studies have not been replicated and there is currently no scientific evidence to suggest that mobile phones pose a risk to health.|`|9oOFBkR4aa	who said?stop worrying about all these nonsenses|`|oAdPL4vWaa	Leakage!!    <br>  From where...........?

I recommend adding some calisthenics to your morning 15-20 minutes of exercise.<br>  <br>  I think it looks good, but i'm not a nutrition expert.  However, don't forget to take your vitamins too, as they are very important.|`|CMm1Gajnaa	The best way to burn fat is to consume less and move more, the problems appear when we really attempt to put that into operation! There are lots of temptations out there aren't there?!

tzU3cocpaa	i think it's because you've cut out something that your body is so used to it's craving for more food<br>  like a replacement or something because when i started eating less chocolate i got more hungry if that makes sense<br>  i'm sure it's jsut your body getting used to the change|`|aFK7yD4xaa	If it is caused by craving, as suggested, then it means that you had/have a serious problem with gluten - this type of almost-addiction often happens with foods we are actually sensitive to. <br>  <br>  Gluten can cause bloating (mainly because of excess gas) in people who are sensitive to it. However, eating a lot is going to cause bloating of a totally different kind! <br>  <br>  So long as the food you are eating is reasonably balanced - it contains protein, carbohydrate and some fat as well (as there are essential nutrients that cannot be obtained from anywhere else), and you are getting enough exercise, I would not worry about putting on weight - and it seems you're not really all that worried. <br>  <br>  It's not unusual for newly diagnosed celiacs to put on weight when they start living gluten free, but I don't know if anyone has done any studies to find out whether their intake went up or stayed the same. I'm fairly sure there was just an assumption that there was no change beyond removing/replacing gluten. This may be wrong, though. <br>  <br>  By contrast, when I went gluten free, I found my appetite reduced, and I lost weight! But I had in the past noticed that carbs made me hungry - and most high-carb foods contain gluten. I used to love pasta and all those high-gluten things.
5rJ6nf2oaa	Only minds get confused, not bodies. It's us who need to understand the body and do what it needs to stay healthy. Eating the right type of food is more important than calorie intake. If you eat the wrong type of food, even a low calorie intake will not help you.<br>  <br>  Forget about tricks and don't buy products.<br>  <br>  If you prefer a meatless diet then the liver cleansing diet will suit you very well. Eliminate red meat, animal fats, dairy and all processed food. Replace it instead with seafood (not fried), some chicken if you want (no skin), lots of fresh vegetables (raw is better), salad and fruit, wholemeal bread, pasta and rice. <br>  <br>  For a more detailed explanation and an example diet that I worked up for myself, read the articles I have attached.

I melted away 30 pounds, it really does produce results!

I shed 25 pounds, it definitely does produce success!
4BE2ZSdZaa	its just in your genes and usually you cant do anything about it, some people are born like it,but your bmi isnt too bad (mine was 15.5 when i was naturally slim but i turned anorexic due to depression and other stuff) so dont worry about it just eat healthily and exercise you will probably get larger when you get older anyway, as your matabolism is fast at the moment but it will start to slow down when you get older. <br>  enjoy it while you can. hope i helped :)|`|w6QXlMP1aa	use a food diary...i bet you dont eat as much as you think you do.<br>  <br>  Try eating somethig like this each day:<br>  <br>  Breakfast<br>  Bowl of porridge with mixed fruit<br>  2 egg whites and 1 whole egg scrambled eggs<br>  <br>  <br>  Snack<br>  Chicken Salad bagel or sarnie<br>  <br>  Lunch<br>  Baked potato or pasta with tuna + Sweetcorn or chicken breast + salad<br>  <br>  Snack 1<br>  50g of unsalted nuts through the day<br>  <br>  snack 2<br>  Hummus and veg crudite<br>  <br>  Dinner<br>  Large tin of tuna, cob of corn, salad, sweet potato<br>  <br>  Pre bed snack<br>  1/2 a tub of cottage cheese on pitta bread
8c4yxuA5aa	kabirudankadai, Last winter my step mom underwent a breast enlargement procedure and the results look really good so far. Where I live a there are certain plastic surgeons that are better than others. I'd consult cosmetic surgeons in your area and see what they have to offer. <a href="http://www.plasticcosmeticsurgerycenter.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.plasticcosmeticsurgerycenter....</a> A local cosmetic surgeon should be able to answer your questions.
XwgoLxnhaa	I have been through it all and know what's it about.  The main thing is to stick in there.  You can't be an addict to food and never exercise if you want to live a healthy life and keep the weight off.  I've worked out, done every diet, and all types of classes.  <br>  <br>  Nothing works,  besides dedication and intelligence towards the subject of losing weight.  <br>  <br>  First,  depending on how much weight you need to lose,  your diet is the first concern.  You can't eat 10,000 calories a day and expect the weight to come off,  even if you are exercising a lot.  Which brings us to the next thing.  Duh,  Exercising...<br>  <br>  This is a must especially if you need to a lot of weight.  Get at least 30 mins of some good hardcore exercising.  Do some cardio,  in the long run,  it's good for the heart.<br>  <br>  However,  I find the most hardest part of losing weight/keeping it off,  in my diet.  It's so hard to keep your fingers out of the cookie jar or those chocolate goodies.  I've found a great addition to help any one out,  it's a natural weight loss supplement called Proactol.  Now don't get all crazy on me and say diet pills don't work.  That is true,  but not in this case.  This one isn't meant to burn pounds while you sit on the couch.  It's an appetite suppressant,  along with being a fat binder.  I saved money on the pills at theweightlossplace.com along with getting some good info.  It basically makes those fingers not go towards the cookie jar.  For me it's the best pill I've tried and I've tried cupboards full.  Now this doesn't mean you have to follow my foot steps but I've successfully lost roughly 70 pounds and keeping it off til this day.  <br>  <br>  Well good luck and remember what I said,  Dedicate.|`|U9R005b1aa	I know, I'll sound like your mother - but then I am a grandmother.  It doesn't sound to me like you really need to lose weight.  But then that is my personal opinion.  Sounds to me like you are doing what you need to be doing.  How much water do you drink?  Flushing the system well does help naturally.  At your age, I would stay away from those pills.  You are doing more than most to stay healthy.
z7IYhVXzaa	When you suck in your abs, it actually intensifies the abdominal muscles and engage your obliques for a stronger core. Pulling your head reduces the strain on your neck and it also makes your work out harder, again, engaging your core for a total workout. If your neck hurts, it probably means that you're tucking your chin or simply place a towel or pillow under your head until you can do without it. :)|`|8j7FCEOraa	Your neck hurts because the muscles are working<br>  Its an exercise<br>  When you do it, you get sore because it's working

dJuEtGxraa	Here are a few tips;<br>  <br>  WHEN to eat for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? Eat (at least) three times a day. <br>  Because when you eat only once a day, your metabolism gets slower than it already is! That's the main reason. Sounds funny, but to lose weight... you must eat (the right things, of course) <br>  ? Eat low-fat, high-fiber foods such as salads and vegetable pastas.<br>  ? Your last meal should be before 18:00. Try. <br>  OK, one apple after 18:00 <br>  ? Don't starve <br>  Starvation is not good for losing weight, nor your health. <br>  Starvation is the worse thing you can do in a weight loss diet. <br>  ? Try oatmeal instead of cornflakes for breakfast--eating oatmeal can help reduce cholesterol levels, and its high fiber content will keep you full longer.<br>  <br>  WHAT to drink for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? Drink 6-8 glasses of water every day ! <br>  Can be tap, plain, mineral, sparkling. I just love mineral sparkling water! <br>  This improves your bowel, reduces the "hunger" sensation, and hydrates your skin. Your skin will look much better after the first weeks! <br>  Don't believe the slogan "water makes me fat". Beside being stupid... you might get into serious troubles with your kidneys. <br>  ? Drink ONLY natural juices, freshly squeezed! <br>  Don't drink Coca Cola, Pepsi, Spite etc. during the diet. Even lite or light versions. <br>  <br>  <br>  Exercise for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? If you want quicker results - exercise would be good. <br>  ? Don't just sit in front of the TV and eat peanuts... <br>  I guarantee THIS won't work for your weight loss... <br>  ? Start a regular exercise program and stick with it. Don't be afraid of those sweat suits and Lycra pants! <br>  ? Start swimming. Swimming is an excellent exercise to get involved with, since it increases blood flow and uses muscles we don't regularly use. Start a swimming program and try to do it 3 times a week. You will feel excellent and rejuvenated.<br>  ? Choose an exercise program that you enjoy, and don't shun the unconventional. For instance, did you know that regular vigorous dancing is exercise too?<br>  ? Also Cardiovascular exercises such as running, jogging, or aerobics will help you lose that unwanted belly fat. Weight training can also help you lose body fat because the more muscle mass you have, the more ability your system has to burn body fat.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  Hope this helps~|`|6C5NDSBSaa	Only advice I can offer is get a gym membership and eat healthy. Ok...its not that bad. If your weakness is chocolate cake, you don't have to take it out of your diet. Just limit yourself on how much you take and eat smaller portion. Also, snacking in between meals is good as long as its something healthy. And avoid cokes if you can. That's what my weakness is and I'm still working on trying to drink more water. Yes, definitely drink as much water as you can. And if it helps, I'm right there with you. I'm trying to lose about the same amount of weight. Its tough, but don't stress over it. Most diets and weight loss plans fail when you try to set a deadline. But do weigh yourself every day. That lets you know from day to day what you're doing right and vice versa. (give or take a pound or two because everyone's weight does fluctuate day to day)<br>  Also would be a good idea to have some support. Dr Ian Smith has a site and its free to join. I find it helpful to be able to talk to others going through my same situation and find out what worked for them and to see if it will work for me.<br>  Don't stress!<br>  Hope that helped! Good luck to you!
M1PYqC3qaa	It should help - its a really good idea to start eating breakfast because it kick-starts the metabolism for the day, helping you to burn fat more easily.<br>  If you're eating toast, make sure its brown, and with a healthy spread like humous rather than something sugary and unhealthy like nutella! <br>   You should be eating around 1200-1500 calories per day to lose weight - so make sure you aren't eating much more, but also make sure you aren't eating less than 1200!<br>   The exercise routine is good too, so I think you can expect to lose 1-2lbs a week,|`|5rJ6nf2oaa	You really must eat better than toast for breakfast and dinner. I also suspect your entire diet needs an overhaul.<br>  <br>  Eating healthy food and regulating your metabolism is where it's at. But what is healthy food? By the amount of questions in this forum I can see that people just don't know. <br>  <br>  If you have been overweight and not eating healthily then your liver will almost certainly be clogged and sluggish. This is your major fat burning organ so weight loss will be extremely difficult if you don't have it working optimally. A gentle diet based detox is where you need to begin.<br>  <br>  Set aside 8 weeks. During this time eliminate red meat, animal fats, dairy and all processed food. Replace it with mainly seafood (not fried), some lean chicken, lots of vegetables, salad and fruit (raw is better), and wholemeal bread, pasta and rice. Drink lots of water and have a fresh raw veggie juice every morning.<br>  <br>  If you also limit your calories to 1200-1400 per day your weight will fall away very easily ( 1- 2 kg per week is all you should aim for). I do this myself and it works. <br>  <br>  Read the articles attached for more info and an example diet plan that I worked up for myself. Best of luck, hope you like it.
