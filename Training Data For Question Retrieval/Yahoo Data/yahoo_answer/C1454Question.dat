I didn't hit either of them because I stopped immediately. ONe fell over then got back up like he was going to do it again.

20081120160805AABq4lC	Society & Culture;Mythology & Folklore	So I had a really creepy dream where something tells me it's going to kill me tomorrow, meaning?	So granted I watch and read a lot of science fiction. So my dream is weird but here goes.      I'm with a group of 5 people, heroes, and we are trying to get out of this underground city where everything is peaceful and taken care of. Problem is there isn't supposed to be an exit, but we need to go and save someone. Some locals are helping us. We figure the exit is probably where they send the criminals, so we purposely get in trouble and sent down this shoot thing. We battle and end up in this room, there a spider monster trying our block our way. Some of the heroes are fighting it and we open the door to this other room. Me and the 2 locals and another hero go in and there's a code. A globular monster comes in. The other hero tells me to go out to the other room because this is like prophecy of my death (the globular monster). I said I'm going to stay and help crack the code (math codes, don't remember exactly) to get out. The other 2 try combinations and then I try a combination ( this is where it gets SUPER CREEPY) .      I'm at the wall with punching in the code and the globular monster comes over to me and says,   "You know I'm going to kill you tomorrow morning."   I say: "Yeah I know"   He says:" No you don't"   Then I say while punching in the last part of the code:   "You're going to kill me slowly"      Then I wake up to a ringing phone.      Meaning please. I was a little freaked out. This was during a midday nap cause I didn't have to work today. So I'm dreading tomorrow morning. I know it's probably nothing but I'm still freaked out.              I should add that I haven't watched anything particularly scary recently

20081020080009AAun4li	Society & Culture;Languages	When to use "ce qui" and "ce que"?	Hello.      I've been told that it's:      ce que + subject + verb. Ce que functions as the subject.   ce qui + verb. Ce qui functions as the direct object.      Like    "Ce qui [[est]] fascinant, c'est sa description de l'époque.   And   "Ce que [je] n'[[aime]] pas, c'est la fin du livre"      Where [] denotes subject and [[]] a verb.      Is this correct?   How can I tell what counts as a subject or a direct object.

20081023212204AA2z95l	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	What gender should I be dating?	For the past 3-4 years I've been pretending to be a girl online. The people that I'm really close with know I'm a guy though. I basically just did this cause I was sick of peoples sayin I was ghey and hassling me. Cept for Johnny Depp and this one I guy I work with (as long as he doesn't talk), I like find guys pretty much gross looking. Hair, muscles, and the pokey stick, just eww.       But anyways, I started playin this one MMORG or w/e they're called. Well Maple Story is a freaking pain to get started, and I was talking to this one guy and he started giving me free stuff. Eventually he kept asking me to be his gf, and I said yes. Cause it's kind hard to make friends on that game, and I figured I could just become friends with his friends. After awhile I realized I liked getting all the compliments and gifts. I liked the role of being the girl in the relationship. It was strictly online, but I ended up falling in love with him. We lasted for over a year with no fights until it ended.      In real life, I have only dated girls. But they have all been short cept for one that lasted 2 years. But we were always fighting. It just always felt like I'm just too girly for them.      I'm really not sure what I should do. Like have I just not found the right girl yet, and try to find a girl willing to play the role of the man? Or should I try dating guys, and hope that I can love them enough to find them attractive? Or am I just screwed? xD

Ent?o, pega todo esse mato e coloca fogo, para transformar essas ervas daninhas em algo melhor, que sirva como adubo às novas flores que vir?o.

20070302205153AA4YLOP	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Pra voce o que é mais importante em um casamento?	O casamento vem desde a cria??o do mundo, quando Deus criou o homem e a mulher, os aben?oou e disse: “Por isso, deixa o homem pai e m?e e se une à sua mulher, tornando-se os dois uma só carne.” Gn. 2.24    é uma institui??o sagrada que Deus designou n?o somente à procria??o, mas principalmente para a felicidade e gozo do casal. De forma que n?o há nada melhor para o homem e a mulher do que ter um casamento aben?oado. Por outro lado, também n?o há nada pior do que um casamento destruído. Por essa raz?o é que o jovem crist?o deve ver e analisar bem a pessoa com quem pretende se casar. N?o basta os dois se gostarem e serem batizados com o Espírito santo. Deve haver também compatibilidade e afinidade entre os dois em vários aspectos, porque o o casamento do crist?o, n?o é como o do incrédulo, que na maioria das vezes já é programado para o divórcio. O crist?o verdadeiro deve se casar ciente de que aquela pessoa será sua companheira até a morte.

20090205095830AAo1Tub	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Mormons:  Do you consider Mormonism to be an ethnicity?	Classical definitions of ethnicity depend mostly on genetic stock and kinship, common sociological traits, and shared language and or religion.  (See C.E. Keyes, 1976 "Toward a New Formulation of the Concept of Ethnic Group." Ethnicity 3:202-13.)      More modern definitions do not seem to require a specific genetic component.  In fact, according to some scholars, "common cultural characteristics" may be a suitable and sufficient basis for assigning ethnicity.  In the introductory essay for the 1980 Harvard Encyclopedia, Harold Abrahamson implies that shared religion of a distinctive quality may be all that is required.  Others assert that a "self-conscious awareness" is all that is needed.  (See Roger Pearson, 1985 An Anthropological Glossary, page 77 and William Petersen, 1980 in "Concepts of Ethnicity" The Harvard Encyclopedia of American Ethnic Groups, pages 234-42.)      Do modern Mormons consider themselves an ethnic group?  Is "self-conscious awareness" akin to the Mormon notion of being a "peculiar" people?

20090205123845AAGR34j	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why do atheists ask for evidence when God wants us to have faith?	We know God wants us to have faith because the Bible tells us so. Faith is all about TRUST.      Imagine if you told your wife that you loved her but she REFUSED to believe that you weren't pretending unless you could give her scientific evidence.      Plus, some people have seen evidence and still don't believe.      The Bible historically documents people seeing Jesus raising someone from the dead and using his powers to make fish appear to feed the masses.      These events CANNOT be explained using science. You cannot just make food appear out of thin air, but Jesus is DOCUMENTED making food appear.      So, why ask for evidence when if people are given evidence all they will do is brush it off?

20090205095211AA5UiAb	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Could one be a non-Christian and want to help the homeless, hungry, etc.?	In my previous question I asked about starting a charity that would get federal funds, and that this charity would discriminate and not hire heterosexual Christians.  This was obviously trying to hold up a mirror to those organizations that do discriminate against gays and non-Christians and suggest that they're douchebags, of course that point was lost on just about everyone.      The 8th answer concerns me, cause it suggests that my charity wouldn't be able to help the homeless or the hungry since that was one of Jesus's missions, and thus I would be doing Christians work.      I think this is rather odd,  can't one be a non-Christian and help hungry people get food?       Couldn't one be an atheist or a satan worshipper or a scientologist or a hindu person and want to help hungry people get food?      Why do Christians feel they have a monopoly on doing good charitable work?
20090205113524AAPn5mU	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Those against Gay Marriage, please argue in favor of these random points?	1) Being gay is not natural. Real Americans always reject unnatural things, like eyeglasses, polyester, liposuction, and air conditioning.    2) Gay marriage will encourage people to be gay in the same way that hanging around tall people will make you tall.    3) Legalizing gay marriage will open the door to all kinds of crazy behavior. People may even wish to marry their pets because a dog has legal standing and can sign a marriage contract.    4) Straight marriage has been around a long time and hasn't changed at all; women are still property, blacks still can't marry whites, and divorce is still illegal.    5) Straight marriage will be less meaningful if gay marriage were allowed; the sanctity of Brittany Spears' 55-hour just-for-fun marriage would be destroyed.    6) Straight marriages are valid because they produce children. Gay couples, infertile couples, and old people shouldn't be allowed to marry because our orphanages aren't full yet, and the world needs more children.    7) Obviously gay parents will raise gay children, since straight parents only raise straight children.    8) Gay marriage is not supported by religion. In a theocracy like ours, the values of one religion are imposed on the entire country. That's why we have only one religion in America.    9) Children can never succeed without a male and a female role model at home. That's why we as a society expressly forbid single parents to raise children.    10) Gay marriage will change the foundation of society; we could never adapt to new social norms. Just like we haven't adapted to cars, the service-sector economy, or longer life spans.    11) The Bible says that being gay is wrong; the Bible also says that a man should have as many wives as he can support, women should not be allowed to speak in public, having sex with your maid is perfectly OK, and being divorced is the worst sin imaginable as far as marriage goes.

At work today a creationist colleague was arguing with a workmate of mine about evolution. I corrected him on his erroneous statement that Evolution contains no facts by informing him that Evolution itself is recognised by the scientific community and world at large as 'fact'. He then told me that it cant be fact as it's not observable and all this other nonsense.      I'm not certain if he really understood me or what was being discussed. I tried to tell him that evolution being fact doesn't necessarily mean it is correct in the sense that until the works of Copernicus became widely received it was 'fact' that the earth was flat. He was especially unhappy to be informed that the 'Intelligent design' that he believes in is based on an acceptance of evolution and that it's actually disputing natural selection.

And don't say we would have deformed inbred children, when we plan on murdering them in the womb via abortion. So with that said if they allow gay marriage, and it's a women's right to get an abortion why should I not be allowed to marry my sister?

20090205100725AAYiub6	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What do Christians think about,..?	,..unmarried people who once followed the Christian teachings by keeping their virginity all through their teens and even all through their 20s by waiting until the day they meet the right person and marry in order to have sex, but once they reach their 30s and still haven't found that special someone yet, then just say "the hell with it" and finally start enjoying premarital sex?      They patientally waited all those years and gave up their sexual youth with nothing to show for it and have had much built up sexual misery from the all the sexual repression that they just go out and finally start having the kind of fun that they've secretly wanted for over the past 10 years. Keep in mind that because they're older, they're wiser then teens and therefore not reckless like them, they know all the precautions, they know about protection, and are careful.      I know Christians want to sexually repress unmarried young people, but once they're not so young anymore, sexual repression becomes pointless, especially if they already know about protection and precautions.

20090205095745AA9rZFt	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Question for a LDS about dress code?	Tonight I will be meeting with 2 missionaries.  They were supposed to come to my house, unfortunately we won't be able to use my house.  We have planned to meet at someone else's house for the meeting.  This person is a member of the church and has agreed to let us use their home for our meeting.   My question;  would there be an appropriate dress code that I should fallow.  I know that when the missionaries come to my house they are usually in suits and ties.  I also know that when men and women of the church are required to dress formally.  Women in dresses/skirts and men in suite/ties.  Would this follow for me being invited to someones house?     Can I just wear jeans and a shirt?   Can I wear dress pants and a blouse?   Or should I be wearing a dress or skirt?   Let me also say that its pretty cold out today, like -20 C.   Any suggestions?  Should I be so worried about this?

20090205095230AAd9yjA	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians. Does it ever bother you that people will go to hell? According to you that is.?	I am an Atheist and in your mind I have chosen to go to hell. Whatever. But you do believe in hell. Fine, I had the choice let's say.     But it does not bother you that in your mind somebody born in a little village in India (China, Brazil... add many other countries) in a poor environment only knows Hinduism (Buddhism, paganism... add many other religions) because that is what his/her parents knew.  Then the person dies before they are ever able to leave the village because maybe they were too young or too poor. They never heard of Jesus so they never 'found' and followed him. So according to some of you (not all) this person ends up in hell.     It does not bother you a bit?

I mean, religion poisons the mind of young children with the fears of Hell before they are fully formed, they misrepresent science and the universe, the make people feel guilty, miserable, ashamed for the mere fact of being human, they destroy a person's standards of knowledge, teach us how to be irrational and keep them from setting ourselves real goals in this life, makes us understand that no matter how guilty, ashamed, sorry we feel, we'll never be good enough in God's eyes to deserve forgiveness, etc...

Uns gostam muito de Sócrates aqui como pude perceber, mas eu gosto muito mais de Aristóteles.      Aristóteles estudou na Academia de Plat?o em Atenas e foi o melhor de seus alunos.      Plat?o, que foi um discípulo de Sócrates tocou todos os campos do conhecimento com suas idéias e adimirava muito seu aluno Aristóteles e era admirado por este, daí nasceu entre ambos uma grande amizade.      Sempre todos os dias discutiam filosofia e determinados assuntos e todos percebiam a preferência do professor por este aluno      Foi quando demonstrando um espírito nobre, numa pergunta onde discordava sobre certa opini?o de Plat?o, Aristóteles disse aos colegas: "Sejamos amigos de Plat?o, mas muito mais amigos da verdade".      Sim, amigos. E a filosofia de Aristóteles foi uma das mais aceitas pela Igreja.      Você é ou pretende ser como Aristóteles no caráter?

20090205125940AACtM3V	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why do Christians believe they have fulfilled Jeremiah 31:27-40 when verse 33 proves they didn't?	Christians aren't the 'house of Israel' like verse 33 speaks about, also they aren't keeping the Laws like verse 33 speaks about this house of Israel keeping.  So how can Jesus of the Gospels be fulfilling Jeremiah 31:27-40. When Christians believe Jesus came to fulfill the law so therefore you don't have to keep them and them not being the 'House of Israel'. It seems to me that the Gospels or New Testament has nothing to do with the Old Testament based om Verse 33 of Jeremiah 31. It seems to me that The New Testament Christians have created their own belief which spun off from Jeremiah 31 but in reality it isn't prophesy being fulfilled. Jeremiah 31 is the Old Covenant of Yahweh being renewed if you read verse 33. Yahweh would never change his old covenant. Malachi 3:6 states that he never changes.

Já se sabe pela ciência, que olhos n?o vêem, ouvidos n?o ouvem, língua n?o sente sabor, pele e m?os n?o sentem toques e o nariz n?o cheira nada.   Todos esses órg?os s?o apenas sensores que codificam e transmitem frequências de ondas específicas, que s?o decodificadas pelo cérebro e liberam elementos químicos associados a cada sensa??o física ou emocional.    A mente insconsciente arquiva tudo e a consciente dá aten??o ou percebe somente uma pequena parte, a resultante do foco mental ou do interesse imediato.   Portanto o cérebro nada mais é que um tipo de receptor LIMITADO dentro de uma determinada faixa de frequência, da qual sintonizamos uma ou outra onda, segundo o foco de nossa aten??o.   Também sabemos pela ciência, que os outros animais percebem ondas tanto acima como abaixo, da faixa de frequência que nós humanos podemos perceber pelos nosso sentidos.

When I pray I only ask things for other people and pray for others. I am afraid that if I ask God to help me in any way I am going to make him angry because I know that I do not deserve his help. I hate this about myself. I know that God wants us to pray to him about everything, and I know that he knows our hearts and desires. I just feel like I dont know how to talk to God the way he wants me to talk to him. I am not sure if this is what my problem is stemming from, but growing up I had a bad relationship with my father and was very fearful of him. We had to be very careful not to make him angry. But I know God is not like my dad, he is perfect and loving and caring, still I am so afraid I will say something wrong to offend him. When I pray, I am constantly saying "I didn't mean that" and rewording what I just said so it will sound less selfish or something. Its to the point that when I start to pray I just say nevermind because I just cant think of the right words that God wants to hear. I never pray that God will give me anything, sometimes I pray for wisdom in a situation, but thats the most I will ask for myself. I dont want him to think that I am coming to him to ask all this stuff of him. ughh... I just want to know the right way to pray. Seriously, I don't even like to pray in my head, I have to pray outloud at night because I'm afraid God will think I am being lazy with my relationship with him. I feel like I dont deserve to talk to him. When I go to church I cry during every single worship song because I just cant stand the idea that he loves me as much as the songs say. Its like overwhelming to me. Please help me.

O senador dos EUA, Ernie Chamberes, do estado de Nebraska, abriu um processo contra Deus no condado de Douglas. Ele é conhecido por sempre criticar os crist?os. O democrata afirmou que abriu o processo semana passada, pois para ele, "Deus gera medo e que é responsável por milh?es de mortes e destrui??es pelo mundo". O processo tem como acusa??es o fato de Deus ter gerado "inunda??es, furac?es horríveis e terríveis tornados".      Chamberes comentou ainda que Deus fez amea?as terroristas contra ele e seus eleitores. Segundo o senador, ele abriu o processo em Douglas porque Deus está em todos as partes. Chamberes disse que a iniciativa foi uma forma de protestar contra o alto número de processos que s?o abertos pelos americanos que ele considera ridículos.        http://br.noticias.yahoo.com/s/070919/48...

Carlos: Para provar que ele é Deus. Se ele n?o tivesse feito milagres, principalmente a sua ressurei??o milagrosa, nós nunca saberíamos que ele é Deus.      Nando: Pensei que se Jesus fizesse milagres para provar que era Deus, isso tirasse nosso livre arbítrio.!       Carlos: N?o.      Nando: Mas n?o foi isso que você disse antes?      Carlos: N?o.

Est?o apenas usando esse espa?o para disseminar os seus preconceitos como a homofobia, a lesbofobia e pregando a intolerancia religiosa.

Se querem ouvir apenas as opini?es dos seus pares n?o precisavam estar aqui, bastava perguntarem para os mesmos nas suas respectivas igrejas. Por que a nossa argumenta??o assusta tanto esses grupos? Por que querem opinar em nossas perguntas e n?o aceitam nossas respostas? Do que eles têm tanto medo?

Destes afasta-te.   Porque deste número s?o os que se introduzem pelas casas, e levam cativas mulheres néscias carregadas de pecados, levadas de várias concupiscências;   Que aprendem sempre, e nunca podem chegar ao conhecimento da verdade.   E, como Janes e Jambres resistiram a Moisés, assim também estes resistem à verdade, sendo homens corruptos de entendimento e réprobos quanto à fé.   (II Timóteo 3:1,9)

Well, First off thanks to everyone who had an answer to my question about my girlfriend thinking i called her fat. It all helped and she started talking to me again the night after it happened.   Anyways, she is coming in to town from school and she'll be here with me for valentines day. Being that i lost my job a few months back and still havent been able to find a job since then. Its also really hard to find a job that will work with my school schedule so yea. So i didnt want her to spend all this money, but she told me she rented us a hotel room for valentines day.I felt bad because i didnt have money to get her anything so i have been asking arounf my family if there were anything around their house i could do for money. i eventually scraped up 15 bucks but that still wasnt enough for me. So i eventually went and donated plasma and got money from that. Being that she rented the hotel room, AND on top of that, she is taking us both out to dinner. I told her i love the fact that she wants to do that for us but i just didnt want her spending all that money because in my mind i want to do all that for her but i cant cause i dont have money right now. But she insists on it, she wants to do it. I got her a present and still havent figured it out what else i wana get or do for her. Any suggestions? i wana make this special for the both of us, and hopefully any suggestions i get will not involve any type of money that i dont have.

I'm very openly bisexual and my fiance knows and accepts that. He encourages me to do what makes me happy and if dating girls makes me happy then he says he's okay with sharing.      My intentions are not purely sexual. Sure I love women and the female body, but I actually want a deep connected relationship with a woman who understands what I'm going through.       I've tried to explain it to some of my lesbian friends and the response I've gotten is pretty much the same thing:   It's really hard to be bisexual and that's good for you but I would never date you because your with a guy.      I personally feel that I have the capacity to love and I'm not just looking for a thing on the side, so what do you think? Would date  a girl who was involved with a guy even if she loved you and was good to you?   Serious answers only please.

If you say it....you must believe in Him!   The one who protest this statement the most, is usually the one who has the biggest doubts about his own atheism beliefs. Is this not true?

Would you rather they have them in back alleys? That argument doesn't work. Drugs are illegal but people still use them, would you rather they get it in a back alley? Just because some people would continue to break the law is no reason to make it legal. The debate should only focus on the real issue, is a fetus a human individual? I can answer that. When I look at my baby girl she is a human individual, if the mother would of had an abortion,my baby girl would not be alive,she would be dead. That's my opinion.

It's (surprisingly) similar to why we go out to the movies with our friends- We simply want to see or hear about something that couldn't actually happen, while interacting with whoever we are with. Another similarity is this- If you talk in the middle of church, people get upset. In you talk in the movies, people get upset. I know that this doesn't explain the purpose of religion, but does it, by any chance, explain ANYTHING?

Its like me kicking someone in the face and claiming I sacrificed my foot and did it all for them, I mean what the   @%    Ancient Rome welcomed and tolerated all religions before Christianity came along claiming itself to be the "only true religion" in its self-rightious propaganda. Jesus did not give his life for everyone, most people at the time were firmly against him. I doubt he gave his life for anyone but himself, everything I've ever read or seen on the matter was about his self-rightiousness, and if he were the son of God and he did give up his life with full knowlege that he wouldn't actually die but would be resurrected, well... I'm sorry but that is hardly a sacrifice (its a paycheck).

Which one of these definitions are correct:      Justification is God making a sinner righteous before Him by His grace.      Sanctification is after being justified the believer is set aside from the world or sin.      or         Justification= being forgiven and put back into right standing...   Sanctification= a work in progress by the Holy Spirit

If we know that a senior or seniors on here could be in danger do we say something?    Do we take a violation and maybe the end to our Yahoo account to save someone that may not want to be saved?

He never said he liked it, but he was getting into it and pushing back into me.  Of course he acted all weird after, but why did he do it?  For that matter why do any guys like anal at all?  I can't stand having anything in my bum.  It doesn't feel right and it's not fun at all.

20090205154559AAK3TF4	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	If you don't believe in the GOD of heaven and earth...What do you think, would make you call out to him?	The Story of Noah's Flood is that every un-believer laughed, made fun of scoffed at Noah until the bitter end. After he got every animal and family member in,the ark, Noah still could hear the laughs outside the door from people saying  he was crazy a major loon.      Soon after the rain came and it kept coming and coming, Noah could hear the screams, the cries out to GOD but it was to late..GOD did not hear there screams or answer them...      My question is: How bad would earth or a situation have to get, before you would cry out to GOD?       If you were caught in the Middle of a raging fire with no escape in sight would you just scream and accept your fate in dying, or do you think you would cry out to GOD to help you?

Ok so ive decided to post this in the religious section because I hear some bad things about what some religious people have to say about gay people, but does God not say to love everybody, treat others the way you would like to be treated and so on...      Im a catholic and go to church, not as often as I would like to but I still go, Im bisexual and don't think that anyone should be discriminated against so that's why I don't discriminate against anyone else.      So my question is, If your religious does it affect the way you react to Gay people??       Oh and I don't want anyone to get offended Im only asking because of some negative things that ive heard.   Thanks :)

20090203025311AA35Tzf	Society & Culture;Holidays;Other - Holidays	Fairly lively young Couples holiday?	Hi.  Me and my girlfriend are in our early twenties and are trying to find somewhere to go on holiday this summer, probably July/August time.      We went to Sunny Beach, Bulgaria last summer.  We had a fantastic time, but found it to be a bit too much like Blackpool with sunshine.  So hoping for something a little better.      We obviously want it to be nice and hot, her more than me (she likes a tan ha).  Although saying that, we get bored just sunbathing all day every day.  So I think the main thing we want from our holiday would be somewhere that offers a nice variety of day excursions.  We aren't particulary interested in historical trips.      Then we want it to be fairly lively at night, nothing like a club 18-30 holiday.  Just some nice restaurants and enough bars to have a decent drink.      Apartments or hotels (any board basis), doesn't really matter.  We have around ￡1000 each to spend on the flight and accomodation.      Thank you for any suggestions.

20090203032051AATL2Ft	Society & Culture;Holidays;Valentine's Day	Crush on Manager. Please Help ?	This is the whole story. I started working at this restaurant as a hostess about 8 months ago. It all started then my attraction to this manager who was basically the general manager. The first time I saw him I told my friend who was working there at the time that guy is really not my type but there is something about him. Most people would never in a million years think that I would like him he is chubby not tall. However he is extremly confident smart and funny. Anyways it was just a small crush and I didnd actually think much of it. Until my friend who was working there that was hooking up with another manager at the time called me and was like brandon the manger she was seeing invited me to a party for the chef please come. I was hesitant because i didnt want to start hanging out with people from work. Anyways she convinced me and we ended up going and the general manager(the 1 that i had a crush on was there). Anyways he started flirting with me telling me he thought I was pretty etc. we got into several fun light conversations. We decided to leave the bar and go to this club close by but i diddnt think the general manager would come to and he did. He started buying me drinks etc. and then he just grabbed me and kissed me...I sort of was backing away but he kept asking me for more and told me he thought I was cute and cninously asking me for more kisses. I secretly enjoyed the kisses very much. it was time ti go home ad me and my friend were fairly drunk and he told us to come to his place that way we didnt have to drive (which was probably him trying to get laid) but i didnt go. Anyways afterwards at work he pulled me to the side and I already knew what he wanted to ask me and I didnt let him speak and said"dont worry I wont say anything" He was like thank you. Afterwards we hung out agian and he asked me and my friend to come over and hang out with a bunch of people and I said no. but he was flirting with me pulling me towards him. Then agian one night he asked me to go for a drink across the street with a bunch of people and I declined agian. I really though i would have more opportunities since im used to guys chasing me. for 7 months after that we have not kissed agian but it was flirting back and forth you can say. Him smiling flirting asking me wierd questions but sometimes it was hard to tell whether he was only acting this way towards me. Long story short I got very used to being secretly obssesed with him and looked forward to going to work because of him. I really wanted to hang out with him agian but never had the balls to ask even though it seemed that he hinted one time when he did me a favor "you owe me two drinks". Anyways he is very smart and a kind of a flirt and i was intimated to the point where i wasnt sure i was able to stimulate him enough to actually want a relationship with me. Anyways i found out from brandon my friends manager that he asked about me like where i was one night and then he mentioned that he couldnt **** where he eats blah blah.. meanwhile i found out that he had sex with one of the servers that used to work in the resturant( she is unnattractive women who really doesnt take care of herself) although he sounds like a scumbag he is only 26 pretty immature. Anyways he just got transferred to another location and i will probably never see him agian...its making me really sad for some reason. And I need to know should I friend request him on facebook and tell him how I feel? Do you think he liked me at all? Help
20090203033511AAtpWB8	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Gay, Muslim, Confused?	I am a British Asian       I have noticed I am gay for almost 9 years. I have told my parents the truth about my sexuality and they have disowned me. i live alone, isolated from society   I am not homophobic.       I believe it’s a sin to commit homosexual acts in Islam. I am not a practicing homosexual.  Nvere go to the gay scene. Its haram. The quran talks about the lust story.      The problem is I can’t stop being gay. For example I can’t stop being the way I am. I can’t stop looking at men instead of women.  This is a sin of mine.  I have never carried out the crime or act of homosexuality. I have never had sex with a man or women.  But being sexually abused at a young age is also a crime I have committed.       I never hope to marry a women or a man. I am traditional and old fashioned. I will not marry women because I do not want to deceive the relationship. I will not marry a man because it is haram in Islam. My parents want me to marry a woman as they think I will turn straight, but this not true.       So I always think that if I was to die early then all my problems would go away. I will go to Allah and if I am a sinner then I will be sinned. I am not bothered if I am in heaven or hell, but most likely for me it will be hell.  But I do not want to kill myself being by doing this I am not accepting life. Allah states that every human should have aright to a life and I decide when he is going to die.   I have read that there is a greater reward if you can control your sexuality. For example if you marry women if you are gay and Muslim then you are given a larger reward.       So I can not stop being gay but I will not marry a man or a women. Am I carrying out the rights steps in life?  And how should I continue life?   I have been to many counseling sessions, therapy and still believe that I am taking the right steps towards life. I have only some years to life but I believe that if Allah was to take me early then it would be better.
