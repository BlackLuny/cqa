20090205124712AA7jDtb	Food & Drink;Other - Food & Drink	Naturally occurring MSG?	I'm allergic to MSG, so I'm used to automatically scanning a new grocery item for it. On some bottles and cans, monosodium glutamate isn't listed as an ingredient, but there will be an asterisk or some symbol saying "No MSG except for the small amount naturally occurring in ..." Does MSG really naturally occur in things such as soy sauce, oysters, or clam chowder? The last one, clam chowder, came from a can of Campbell's Healthy Harvest Clam Chowder, which said no MSG except for the small amount naturally occurring in yeast extract. Does MSG really *naturally* occur in anything? And if so, what are the natural things I need to be wary of?

All the recipes i've seen so far seem to suggest that they should be "warmed" in the oven after frying them. I take this to mean that they should be lightly baked. I notice that when i make mine, the insides are still really wet and sort of uncooked. It looks like wet dough, instead of like cooked pancakes. I've been skipping the oven step but i think i'm gonna try that now since i've tried everything else. So do you put your pancakes in the oven and do you think doing that makes a difference in how they turn out? I'm also worried about this making the pancakes tough.. wouldn't want that.
20090205130940AA8cFCd	Food & Drink;Cooking & Recipes	Help making buttermilk pancakes....?	So i finally got them to not be all tough and chewy (mix very lightly). But i've been having this problem where the insides don't cook. The outside of the pancake looks perfectly normal,but when you cut into it, the inside is like wet like uncooked dough or something. Instead of light, fluffy dryness, it's wet and it looks uncooked. what am i doing wrong? Does anyone know why on earth this is happening?? I've tried a lot and can't think of anything else to try.

Just out of curiosity, insects are sometimes eaten in certain countries and are known for nutritional value.  However, to find eatable insects (bugs) in stores is not common.

20090205154634AAerfb2	Food & Drink;Other - Food & Drink	Rice sticking to the bottom of the rice cooker!?	I am a college student who recently acquired a friend's used rice cooker.  It didn't have a box or any directions.  I purchased some white jasmine rice, and on the back of the bottle the directions say to put in two parts water for one part rice (did that fine), and to only stir it once, then let it sit in the cooker until it's done (when the button pops up).      The rice comes out delicious!  ... But so much of it sticks to the bottom of the pan and is extremely difficult to get off.  I don't want to waste rice!  How can I make the most of my rice cooker without wasting food?

All I had to eat yesterday was rice and chinese vegetables and peanut butter M&M's after work. It's not the vegetables my boss and her family ate them too and they are fine. When I called in today and told her what I ate she said it was most likely the peanut butter. If it's not part of the recall how do I get in touch with the maker to complain. I'm pretty much convinced that's it seeing as I had a limited diet yesterday.
