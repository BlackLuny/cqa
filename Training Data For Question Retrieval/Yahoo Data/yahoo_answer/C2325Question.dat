20090223121853AArWEvl	Education & Reference;Words & Wordplay	Question about the use of the word "retarded."?	I've noticed that the word "retarded" is very often used, not to refer to someone who is mentally retarded, but in a very general, negative way, such as "Oh, that's so retarded," or, "I know this looks really retarded." I myself have been careful not to use the word in that context because I think it's insensitive to people with actual mental/developmental disabilities. However, now I'm beginning to think that the term is gaining acceptance in part because we have alternate ways of describing people with this kind of disability.      My question is: do you think it's okay to use the word "retarded" in such a general way, or do you think it's in bad taste?

20090223103408AAiR75i	Education & Reference;Preschool	How to put letter sounds together?	My 2.25 year old knows all letters and sounds. She reads few words correctly too. She has been knowing the letter sounds since long. She is not able to put the sounds together and pronounce the words. I know it is early to do that but I am still asking for advices as I feel she really needs that at this moment. I read her a lot as she is so much dependent on me at this time. I think she wants to do that on her own, but she can not so she seeks me so often. She wants me to switch off the gas-stove and come sit by her, read her stories. But then who will do cooking for her(and for us)?      I taught my elder one how to read at age 4. She had started writing a bit by 4. So I just gave her workbooks and with little practice she started reading at age 4.25. I must mention that she is a wondeful reader and is doing amazing at her school(Now Grade 1).  Elder one loves reading so much that she makes sure to do that for one hour each day. Probably that is also one source of inspiration(and a bit of problem) for younger one. I want Reading to be quick for younger one because that way they will have reading time together with their own books. My elder one does read to younger but mostly for 10 minutes and then goes to her own books. They play a lot together. Younger one is very mature and elder one is very energitic so they get along very nicely. Somehow 'Not able to Read' is coming on the way. I don't want to be pushy but I just want to make it easier. However I know some kids need parents even after they start reading on their own, but I feel that won't be too much and I can make myself available surely for sometime.

20090223122537AA5aV9q	Education & Reference;Words & Wordplay	How Does This Sound, Up To Now?	The Last Time.      I was woken, by my mother rattling around our dilapidated 1 bed roomed flat. The floor boards screamed as she scraped her heels along their shells. She knew I was awake, yet she continued to hesitate before finally coming into my room.       She barged in. “Start putting all your things in a bag”. I glanced at the misted window; the sky was still covered by its blanket.       Even though I was at a young age, I knew my mother wasn’t normal. She wasn’t like the mums I saw on TV, she didn’t read me stories or take me to the park; she was simply a device that fed me and put me to bed, with minimal conversation involved. I assumed it was because she was still young, I felt an awkward ambience when we were together.      I pulled my infamous Noddy rucksack from under my bed. It was a dirty pillar-box red with heavy woven straps that barely fitted my childish shoulders. I loved that rucksack like a brother, I took it absolutely everywhere. My mother would tell me to get rid of it as I was far too old for it but I insisted that I wasn’t, and continued to cling to it. I packed my few things before I was hushed out the door.      The winter air whipped my rosebud cheeks. I clung onto my rucksack as we wondered the bare streets, the silence was deafening.    “Where are we going?”   She didn’t answer.   After about 20 minutes, we arrived at a grotty block of flats, similar to ours. She raced ahead of me up the stairwell not even checking that I was following. We climbed endless flights of stairs. As I began to pray for the end, we came to a broken down blue door with the number, 287A stapled to the front. She boundlessly knocked on it and pushed me behind her. A tall thin man with dusky hair emerged to the door; he was well mannered and addressed my mother as Ilene.      They spoke for what felt like hours, the sun was beginning peer through the window. I wondered how long I would have to sit and stare at the Cézanne bowl of grapes adjacent to me.  Suddenly the conversation became heated and my mother soon jumped to her feet. “Go out on the balcony, now!” she said to me. I hurried out and shut the door behind me, then skimmed my view of East London as I leaned over the edge. The batch paint work crumbled off as I force my weight upon the white banister; I watched the white flickers of dried paint float down, and down towards the ground. I could hear the miffed argument going on behind me, but I ignored it, and continued the watch the speckles.       I made a game. I would count, in seconds, how long it took for one speckle to reach the ground. 24, 25, 26. I was suddenly jilted forward and then back again. Her hand grabbed my hood.   “Come on, we’ve got to go.” She said to me in a beaten tone. She took my hand and headed for the door. The tall man began to approach the door as we did, then slowly opened it and moved aside so that we could pass.   “Bye, Ilene.”    “Whatever.” My mother replied.            This is some corsework i have, it has to be finished in 1000 words, thats why it moves quickly

20090223132049AAHBArK	Education & Reference;Studying Abroad	What are some international careers for a US citizen who would like to live abroad?	Screwed up big time and now I'm 29, with a Spanish degree, and trapped in North Carolina.  Don't get me wrong!  I'm GLAD that I learned Spanish.  Learning Spanish was one of my best decisions ever!  I just regret majoring in Spanish (I also studied science).  I didn't know what I wanted to do and I thought it would help me escape North Carolina.      Now, when I tell people what my college major was, I get: "There's so much you can do with Spanish right here in this town!"  My plans backfired and I feel even more tethered to North Carolina than ever.      I realize that location isn't the only important factor in choosing a career but I studied abroad my last year of college, I speak fluent Spanish, and I just want to go abroad again.  I miss Latin culture, but I'm also bored and I want more adventures.  I don't want an ordinary life  and to stay in one place forever.  Please don't tell me I just need another town in North Carolina...  North Carolina is just not the way for me... no offense to anyone.      What are some careers that a US citizen can viably do abroad?   My big concern:  Am I too old to pursue these careers?  Will my age be a detriment?      If you can help me, thanks!!

Is the month one better off having than a two day one? Or are they the same?      Finally, is it worth doing a CELTA course, or is TEFL enough to get jobs?      If anyone can give me advice? Thanks.

I had no idea what I was doing.. I got a $1,000 check in the mail and i seriously spent it all (on bills). I knew I had to pay it back but it was left overs from the summer semester. Then I get $1700 check in the mail and buy a new computer and school supplies with it.   Then I get more financial aid for fall 2008, and It was mostly all used on school credits. I still have $1750 yet to be disbursed but I don't want to go to community college anymore.   I decided nursing wasn't for me (i am doing pre-reqs).. and I want to go to cosmotology school which costs $14k   I filled out a fafsa.   But now I am already 5k in the hole with subsidized student loans and I haven't even been in school for a year.   So this probably sounds complicated. But basically... can I get more money go to cosmetology school?    I had no idea how financial aid works and I didn't know there was a 'cap'. Now obviously I regret spending those checks on bills and my car payment. Which I had saved it for school. I am so stupid.    I wish they never sent me the stupid checks and just kept it in my account! But it's my fault for not knowing better.   I am just worried I have no more financial aid left??   Who can I talk to? I get mail from us bank but emails from sallie mae.   How can I get a 14k loan? Can it be subsidized?

It has to be at least 8 chapters long and have either a prelude or an epilogue. Does my epilogue sound ok?   The book is based off of a real story nd a real friend.   thnx         It was late summer - July 29th I think. The sky was a paisley orange and the clouds were the fluffiest i'd seen all month.   You could tell it would be nightfall soon as the sun peaked through the balls of fluff.    My hair was in a messy pony tail and my flipflops were falling apart, but that was the least of my concerns.      All that i could think about was him.   What was so appealing in Tommy Louis? His dark caramel hair? Or maybe it was his eyes. Oh yes, his eyes. The dark green eyes that light up my world   the passed two months of summer. We'd known eachother since third grade, and we had always been some-what friends.       He would be the guy i hung out with during recess. While the other girls were running off being chased by the dirty, cootie possesed boys, We hung    out by the fence; Listening to the wind, and catching the bugs. We'd talk about anything and everything, being ourselves. Tommy was my best friend.   For the first 3 months, our relationship blossomed, that is, until Brian came along. Brian - My first boyfriend. He was a more "popular" boy then Tommy.    And on top of that, Brian's family knew my mom. Well sixth grade came along and Brian moved away, thus ending my long relationship.    Then the class list for grade six were posted, Tommy and i were in   the same class. That's when we began to connect again: Thus catching you and I up; The summer before eigth grade.      I gave the brown gate in my yard a huge push as it scraped the sidewalk. My hands were sweaty and my legs were hot as i trotted down the block to Tommy's    house. I had a warm bottle of Dr. Pepper in my old backback, along with a dictionary and a few quarters in case the ice cream truck happend to ride by.   by.       The air was hot, and very salty. I could still feel part of the sun's rays heating my skin. I licked my lips rid the smell of chlorine from my Uncle Jerry's   swimming pool. I had went and took a quick dip earlier that day. That's the best part about summer time - swimming. The way the water runs down you and the    cold liquid sufficates your body gives you a rush of excitment and keeps you craving more. I just feel free and careless when I hit the water and I love the    way the smell of the cleansed water lingers with you.      As I walked, I started to hear the songs of the crickets. I closed my eyes for just a moment and tried to think of what I was going to say to Tommy.   That I was in love with him? No, that wouldn't work.       Cars passed by me, many teenagers driving their "Sweet 16" convertibles and mustangs. They were    so lucky. I couldn't wait to be able to drive. I thought to myself, "Three more years, Cassie. And then that will be you."      The walk to Tommy's  house was for the most part always relaxing during the evening. Besides the occasional immature boys who honk their horns   and shout crude thinks, it was a pretty invatational trip. He lived only 3 blocks away from my house and was always happy for me to come over.    After all, I was his best friend as he was mine.      I remember approaching my destination; the faded yellow house. It was an old house, this anyone could tell. It had large white shutters and the screen   door had a rip in it. Other than that the house was like a dream house. It was really large because of his big family. Tommy had 3 brothers and a sister.   He lived with his mom, Sylvia and his step dad, Paul. Tommy's brothers were 14, 6 and 2. Barney, Matthew and Johnothan were their names.   And his sister, Megan was 7. Since Tommy's family was large, his house was aswell. It had 9 bedrooms and 4 bathrooms. I would probably get lost if I   venture out into his home. then again - Maybe not?      I could see Tommy on the patio swing, swaying with the breeze.

He waved and I, of course,   waved back. Tommy began to rush down the side walk, straying away from his porch.   We met halfway and he ask, "What's that smell?" plugging his nose.   "Your Mom." I answered, offended. I was quite fond of the smell of fresh chlorine.   "I know, you went swimming," He lightly pushed my shoulder to inform me of his joke and invited me inside the monster home.    His mom was sitting on the couch watching Jerry Springer when I followed Tommy through the house.      We made our way upstairs. Ok now I know what you're thinking. But we only thought of each other as friends. It was like a girl-with-a-gay best friend   relationship. Or atleast thats what he thought of us.

I've gone to the high school since 9th grade, and passed and have all my credits.  But the beginning of this school year, I started getting sick, and I had to be home schooled because my doctor couldnt do anything about it.  So I already had been there for years, and even 3 months in the beginning of this school year.  But know that i want to go back to school, because i'm better now, they act like i have to be tested and give them a transcript (and by the way, THEY have my transcrpt.)  And they keep acting like i never should have been homeschooled and i'll have to repeat grades and that just because had severe headaches and couldnt even walk they were so bad, that i should have been at school.  I had continous headache for months that was so severe i couldnt do anything.  The school acts like they dont care and acts like were so dumb for taking me out of school, and i want to go back!  They keep acting like i cant get credit from the work i did during home schooling, which is even more work than I would have done at school.  Does anyone know how to handle this?

I'm not sure if I want to teach EFL forever, but to make a long story short, I studied abroad my last year of college, and returned to the US, and had a really rough time readjusting.        It's been five years, and I'm a Spanish teacher now (I speak almost perfect Spanish.  I'm not bragging though, I've been told this by native speakers quite often) and I am still going through reentry shock.  About a year ago I started getting the winter blues and decided,  "I've got to get out of this town."  People kept telling me to fall in love with North Carolina as my home, but I wanted out.  I did some research, talked to people and decided that EFL (teaching English as a foreign language) was a good idea.  I love Spanish, but it's gonna be hard to do that abroad (unless I get a job on a US military base, which I'm looking into as well).      I've researched what credentials I need and enrolled in a certification program.  Here's my problem... I'm 29 now, and by the time I'm qualified, I'll be 30.  Is this going to close the door for me?  How can I compete with someone who's 20 or 21?      Thanks, if you can help me.

She was tested and accepted in an "advanced" school that goes up to 5th grade. I know she is advanced in just about everything BUT math. I don't know thats its a good idea to put her in a school where I am almost certain she will struggle in math. I could do the "regular' school like we have been but she gets bored because she is ahead of the class and tends to get in trouble because she wants to talk to others who are still working. I am afraid there is no "good" place to put her. I'm looking for input/advice maybe some suggestions I have not thought of. Please and thanks!

Looks like you have a misspelling!"  I do use a lot of punctuation, it's just the way I write & I know how to use it.  This new "helper" is driving me up the wall!

Ok, I am currently an undergraduate student interested in pursuing a D.O. (I really agree with the philosophies behind the practice). I am wondering how my early transcripts will affect my chances of getting into a good school.       I am a first generation college student, and as such, I was not quite sure where to go or what to do. I ended up going to a community college where my GPA was absolutely lousy at 2.9, (including C's in anatomy and physiology).I transferred out after about a year there, and have managed to get my total GPA up to about a 3.5. I am a psychology major kind of specializing in neuroscience, and have received excellent marks in all the classes within my major (3.8 GPA). I have done very well in Biology and chemistry as well.       What I'm wondering is how bad the early classes will look to an admissions committee.

20090223103420AA9jwcb	Education & Reference;Standards & Testing	SAT IQ ADHD questions from a gifted student, people knowledgeable in IQ testing/gifted education/SAT/ADHD only?	*I am not trying to show off or be obsessive about my IQ, I just want to know the facts because the last couple years of school for me have been really confusing because of an undiagnosed disorder of ADHD, and I really need to know what my strengths and weaknesses are, because ADHD is a disorder that causes weaknesses in many academic areas (especially staying focused when reading and writing essays...aghh), and it's important for me to compensate for these weaknesses and also, know what my strengths are and use them to my advantage.  I've done lots of personal research into this area.      Things that I know: I am gifted, I qualified for the gifted and talent program in my elementary school starting 4th grade.  Even among that highly intelligent group, people felt as did I that I was at the top or near the top of that 30 some person class.  When focused, I am able to learn at an extremely high rate, can understand the essence of an argument, and follow lectures on subjects such as economics and physics with little to no difficulty...I'm also a curious person and learn through immersion on many topics including anthropology, finance, astronomy, psychology, etc.  In a given situation, I am able to ask important questions that will enable me to get a grasp of what the situation demands and then learn about the system (for example business).  I see connections between different fields and can make conclusions often through intuition, etc.      I received a SAT score of 1570 on the "new" SAT (only counting the CR/Math portions).  Furthermore, I didn't do any formal test prep because I couldn't afford it; I only took practice tests, and I didn't get extra time/special accommodations for the SAT because I didn't know I had ADHD when I took the test.  My 1570 score (CR: 770, Math: 800) was equivalent to an IQ of 150 according to this chart:  http://www.iqcomparisonsite.com/SATIQ.as...   However, the "old" (before 1995) SAT had a much higher ceiling, and experts in psychometrics seem to conclude that the old SAT discriminates well even in the 1500+ score range, which is essentially a 155+ IQ (1510 = 155 IQ, 1560 = 160 IQ, SD: 15).  I have concluded, through extensive personal research that the "old" SAT seems to be essentially a really high ceiling IQ test that has been given to a sample size of millions - and proven to be reliable and valid and correlates to IQ/g better than most tests that psychologists use (like the WAIS, stanford-binet).      I just recently discovered that I have ADHD (currently a college freshman at UCLA, I'm getting counseling/starting stimulant medication), which went undiagnosed and unidentified all through my childhood (really struggled the last two years, and most important two years of high school and beginning of freshman year).  Previously I had been a straight A/A+ student (also national level science competitions, math olympiad highest indiv. score, national scripss spelling bee, I was an academic superstar for much of my first 16 years).      My verbal IQ on the WISC-III was 142, and my performance IQ was 125, full scale 137.  A greater than 15 point difference between verbal and performance IQ + impaired performance in school (which certainly happened in the last 2 years of high school) is considered a learning disability (which is probably ADHD).  However, the WISC-III isn't a good test for people with IQs above the 99th percentile because of ceiling effects.  My average score on practice tests on the SAT was in the range of 2330-2370, so I strongly believe that my IQ is higher than what the WISC-III is saying.  (2330-2370 is roughly equivalent to 1570-1590 equivalent to a 150-151 IQ).  However, I struggled heavily with the writing section on the actual test...      Furthermore, I have noticed that my reading comprehension scores have always been extremely variable; for example, in standardized test scores throughout school (from elementary school ---> high school), I would receive scores that above average, but not great: for example 76th percentile, 82th percentile, 85th, 94th percentile.  I had NEVER done well in a reading comprehension test, but on the SAT after some practice I managed to score in the 99+th percentile (CR: 770).  I believe that going from the ~85th to the 99+th percentile is a score variance that cannot be explained without another cause, which I believe to be my undiagnosed ADHD.      If I improved my reading comp. scores from the 75th-95th percentile to the 99+th, I think it's possible that my verbal ability could be in any range above the 99th percentile, it could be 99.0th, 99.5th, or 99.995th...I don't know exactly how high it is...or how low for that matter.  I believe the old SAT could really tell me where my true abilities lie, is there anywhere I can get copies of old exams (official exams, not practice books by Princeton Review, Kaplan, etc)?  I'd say that there's a reasonable chance that I can score in the low 1500s (1500-1550) (IQ 155-160) and a tiny tiny chanc
