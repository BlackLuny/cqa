3gX59LH4aa	Bare minerals has bismuth oxychloride-this ingredient is in a lot of mineral foundations and it's what causes shine. It can also cause irritation too. I stopped using bare minerals and now I wear signature minerals. You can only get it online, but for me it's worth it because it looks nice all day and doesn't get shiny unless it's really humid or I'm sweating a lot or something like that. Whatever you decide, just try to find a mineral foundation with a short ingredient list and DOES NOT contain bismuth oxychloride. Good luck!|`|TAQWVcCtaa	Not really sure what I would recommend to you. There are so many products out there so what I end up doing is starting cheap and trying out a few different ones.I would check out the review site at http://www.brandsmakeup.com visit and browse the reviews.
3LWI3qfhaa	maybe something like thishttp://s197.photobucket.com/albums/aa243...|`|0EmjQjf7aa	round face. and short hair will suit you|`|GKJEgidzaa	Eh, Just get a side fringe or something. I reckon it looks fine as is. You have a round face.  don't post photos of yourself.|`|Ppz64oxQaa	I'd say you have a....pickle shaped face.  As for getting a haircut..you should.|`|ilaAcjGvaa	i would defiantly thin it out, lots of layers, don't cut the length any shorter! you have a squarish round face, cutting your hair short only makes your face look wider.|`|oRRIU2Peaa	a front fringe.. or side one.  a thin one.  and straighten your hair it will look 100 times better:)  x|`|qfUnwHyFaa	get a side fringe   also straighten it x|`|r1fb8t25aa	no.1 all over, just the weather for it|`|AfbjU9Guaa	A bob cut like this:    http://www.hairfinder.com/hair3/jenny-bo...|`|I6zUkFtfaa	Get it cut with a spoon. Its the future!    But seriously, I think your hair looks great as it is. If you really want to change it, I suppose you could go for something just a little shorter, but I really like the style you have right now.    Im afraid Im useless on face shapes, though, so I cant be much help there!|`|UW8Aoid0aa	I think you'd look cute with a bob  [[: and you should try straightening it a bit|`|0qsXGP7Laa	I'll go ahead and give you two fantastic styles that you are probably better off not considering.    The BC:  http://i73.photobucket.com/albums/i232/f...    and the  "when-hedge trimmers-attack":  http://www.girls-emo.com/wp-content/uplo...|`|eharP3rkaa	i recon u should a a choppy bob with a side fringe and blond high-lights.|`|UaHZH9ifaa	holy **** u look EXACTLY like my friend lol, oh and ur hot|`|T9dj2qX5aa	I think you have the same shape face as meeee that fits into no particular categories haha! It's kinda square in terms of width but your jaw is a bit rounder! We are part of a very special face-shape club :]    I think you should get your fringe cut a bit shorter like the end product here:   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3Q3PCgX8...     and maybe a bit of layering, but keep it below the jawline, as that's supposed to suit our face shape ;]    Hope this helps!!
P9RQ4mgiaa	I just looked at your profile and have to admit i admire your inventivness :) particularly enjoyed the 'loads of knives and forks and other cuttlefish' question|`|jeX5VZAtaa	What I have never heard such...I want to know more about it though!!|`|2242ab75cc3bad9ab4ca7fbaf5578defaa	No. Not parasites.    However if you mean parasols then the answer is yes.|`|vJRMmgd6aa	parasites?|`|czAbrzcUaa	LMFAO  I think you mean parasols...|`|CipBS79zaa	In England its quite common for women, and men, come to think of it to carry parasites in summer. My wife favours the crab louse,me i go for the more conservative common headlouse.|`|9iXGakohaa	I hope no one carries parasites to stay in the shade-- it can't be very effective.    However, people do carry parasols, though it is not as popular as it was a long time ago.|`|4ebfc96012aef4fc15dc59c42ecac5a7aa	To carry parasites?  Do you mean parasols?    :)|`|rpqHLJGGaa	you mean parasols you loon|`|S6JIqzjEaa	Ha ha - love it!  Parasoles are far less interesting, but maybe more effective!|`|4ec5baf736e5e1b4200f6e39ea8eda12aa	Did you mean parasol (umbrella) or is this a joke|`|Fd4EBV1Vaa	Parasites, no. Parasols, yes. Alot of girls in Japan and China still carry parasols (or even just decorative umberellas) to keep the sun off them.|`|Toz7gyuhaa	Ignoring the obvious parasite/parasol confusion, I've seen many women in Tokyo and Hong Kong carrying parasols, even in not particularly sunny weather.    However, here in the UK, it seems many women wish to make themselves orange with fake tan rather than retain a pale and interesting look, so no, I haven't seen much evidence of parasol use here.|`|vYAgIMLdaa	Oh yes!  Female stars and singers have parasites around them all the time.|`|24vQ8D71aa	i would imagine some ladies would carry parasites, but these days they are to small to keep the sun off.|`|b7FbWNmlaa	Parasols you muppet not parasites!!|`|PgGmH98Caa	aha parosols, yes. lmao. theyre not popular, but theyre classy. I dont see why people wouldnt use them. Besides, whats anyone gonna do, run up o you, take the parosol and smash it?
BT4KgOobaa	Rimmel is really good liner. if its wearing off too fast, try liquid liner but in pen form. (its easier) be careful around your eyes though. its very easy to hurt yourself|`|6Ss31wyBaa	What I do is put black eyeshadow over my eyeliner with a small brush|`|Ahx8th4Waa	I'd suggest liquid eyeliner. I use it daily and it doesnt smudge or anything. And believe it or not, it's not that hard to apply. Hope it helps!|`|uNpcUcPTaa	after uve done ur make up, close ur eyes and spray hairspray onto your face. I wouldnt recommend doing this everyday though as it clogs ur pores, but every once in a while wont do much harm!     Not too sure why u wudnt be allowed to wear foundation, but if u put a cream one on ur lids then let it soak in for 5 mins, then put on ur eye make up it does keep it|`|19a42269af82d3f5735bb50900745b21aa	First: Don't put the eyeliner on the inside of your eyelid.  It's bad for your eyes (hence the blur/glare).  Second: Find a good oil mattifying gel.  Put some on your forehead and that will keep the oil from traveling down to your eyes.|`|7ntSRsZLaa	Buy Almay eye brighteners eyeliner,  run it about 3/4 across the bottom of your eye, then afterwards take black eyeshadow and run it across the rest of the way, to make it thicker and darker and go all the way across the eye. When you want to touch it up through the day, just have the eyeliner on you and run it along your inner eye back and forth about five times and it will automatically darken and look fresher.|`|UW8Aoid0aa	liquid all the way  get water proof liquid its awesome  but sometimes it may looked cracked   its a lot better than pencil|`|aVNrdO5uaa	I use rimmel london pencil eyeliner. It works good and does not smudge..for a darker look, i sometimes wear Revlon liquid eyeliner along the edges of top and bottom.
hI89bxY3aa	you should try seenon.com  then go to the tab that says tv  and then click on cw    i am not sure if its what your looking for, but i tried :)
P1VoMS36aa	yes, make sure you don't regret this one!  xxxx|`|KkSW6EViaa	yepp i think so    :)|`|WYa3UY6Gaa	You can, but if you are going to put another tattoo over it you shouldn't even get laser removal. A good artist could do a wonderful cover - up.|`|AA10801124	yes, even a good idea because the removed tattoo can sometimes leave a discolored area.|`|ESWdyM6Haa	The answer is 'YES'.|`|7add460ae24c9452ae87b5a99c5aa756aa	Im sorry, but wouldnt that defeat the purpose of having the tattoo removed?  There are many very qualified, talented artists out there, who would be happy to do a cover up on a tattoo for you.  Why not research there, before wasting your money
yp8NtB0faa	A cute red dress, pair of heels, and i'll do my hair in an updo.

cMZEmpp0aa	I don't recommend eBay unless you either don't care if you get an authentic kimono (satin bathrobes and real, 100% silk furisode are often sold side-by-side on eBay, especially if you just search for "kimono") or unless you already know enough about kimono to search for specific terms and identify whether or not a kimono is going for a reasonable price. I suggest you start on non-auction sites instead. Ichiroya, Ryu Japan, Kimono Lily, and Yamatoku are all reputable kimono sellers who sell ONLY authentic kimono and kimono accessories -- not a single satin bathrobe in sight. Even if you don't buy from them right away, you can browse their sites and start getting a feel for things like price ranges for types of kimono, how different kinds of damage influence kimono prices, and what other factors (like age or material) influence kimono prices. That way you seriously decrease your chances of getting taken for a ride when you do finally venture onto eBay to shop. <br>  <br>  I also suggest you do a little research on kimono so you can better choose a kimono that fits your needs. For example, do you just want this to display? To wear as a costume? To wear to an event? There are lots of different rules involved in wearing kimono, so if you plan on actually wearing your kimono you'll need to know things like what season(s) you want it for and what kind of events each kind of kimono can be used for. Season and event determine all aspects of kimono, like material, motif, the presence or absence of lining, and what kind of accessories you wear with it. For that kind of information, I suggest looking at the kitsuke section of the Immortal Geisha forums (especially the threads in the Knowledge Bank). They're pretty thorough and it'll save you some pretty major headaches in the long run.|`|9MtKzSE8aa	Their quite expensive.<br>  Try Ebay.

ORVQiiQCaa	Acne.  It can be from wearing hats, grease, or just hormones.  All you can do is wash it pretty good.  They have some things on the market that help them go away faster, like neutrogena or acne free.  There is a possibility that they are excema.  If so you need to talk to a dermatologist.|`|XFDkr6OIaa	my mom had those but they go away , don't worry about it|`|IT7ka3Ybaa	pop these suckers|`|sSctu8GGaa	there chicken pox... duhh! you freak!!!|`|VZzdTUtEaa	They could be just pimples. Make sure you wash your hair good and face too. If they itch a lot put some anti-itch cream on them.|`|SN7YHJTbaa	I used to have that !! Its just acne and to get rid of them you just have to make sure you  clean all around the hairline area, with an anti-bacterial cleanser.
wX5xoAN8aa	Try Shuttershadesonline.com    Don't know why you would want those ugly things...|`|cmxAgXxgaa	they actually have them at the as seen on tv store. i'm not kidding.
m9UNLTH6aa	I went to cosmetology school and I have learned through experience before that that it is always better to go to a stylist!  The home products are hard to use yourself.  9 times out of 10 you will end up with orange or bright gold hair (not the pretty kind of gold).  Also you can burn your hair and make it break off!|`|lgxE5nUoaa	Go with caramel highlights.  These will give the hint of blonde but also won't come across brassy or orange.  But I agree with everyone here, it's best to go to a stylist.|`|JwnHKTabaa	It's 100% best just to go to the hairdresser.|`|5zsPHQKwaa	I always used L'Oreal and tried to copy the methods used by hair stylists for separating the hair before dying. Though I suggest you go to the hairstylist. Much more reliable than doing it yourself :)  Good luck!|`|rQE5I9lJaa	my mom is a hairdresser i think its always best to go have it done at the salon
jU0dGPzUaa	They are very good! (:<br>  They give you hand massages and clean out all the dirt and file them all perfect and they do your cuticles. <br>  I'm 14 and I got my nails done perfessionally done 2 times.<br>  It's not expensive at all. They are usually about 10 dollars.<br>  Good luck with your nails!<br>  -Mrs. McGinty<br>  11/01/08 and 3/22/09|`|264GS7s7aa	No, don't go to the ones in the mall.  A good manicure can be expensive, but you will be less likely to get an infection.  I am in college studying to be a dermatologist which takes care of hair, skin, and nails.  I have spent some time in offices and a lot of the emergencies that come in are nail emergencies and the cuticles are infected because they have been cut, or have used unclean instruments.<br>  <br>  Go to a hair salon that is good and has a good nail tech. with a license.  It may be more expensive but it will pay in the long run.  Manicures are so much fun, I hope you have a good time.|`|1FwUTtDpaa	their good. find out the name of the salon to look at its website so you can see their process and prices.
UYnZtJ2daa	Don't use websites...there is no telling how right they are. And hey, there's also no telling that the people on here are right about what they talk about. A lot of people really have no idea but will talk like they do.<br>  <br>  If you're going to get a tattoo in a language you can't read (kinda stupid, but not my body) then go to a professional that speaks the language fluently...don't trust random people or websites. You don't want a tattoo that doesn't say what it's supposed to.|`|WLuEIwp5aa	1) You don't know how kanji works at all, and kanji isn't used for foreign words anyway, katakana is.  You can't just 'translate' your name into kanji.<br>  <br>  2) Talk to a native speaker or you'll end up with something that is so wrong you'll want to cry.
dM1jwSGyaa	This sounds sort of weird, but I think you can try to sponge it off using a piece of white bread.

NreYtav9aa	Texturizing shampoo is another word for volumizing really. Is your scalp oily? if so a volumizing/texturizing shampoo would be good in your case and making sure it is color safe, just use a slightly heavier conditioner and only on your ends if you do have an oily scalp, or the shampoo will defiitly dry out your hair some more. <br>  as far as good brands, abba and pureology are my faves around 13-25 for a bottle. <br>  just go to a good beauty supply in your area and tell them your situation and hopefully they can give you a more personalized answer!!|`|rTHCinWHaa	let a ghetto girl like me tell u what it does it will change the texture of your hair and if your hair is like merss up it will improve it|`|1PGmB4JNaa	get pantene's shampoo&conditioner for volume its the purple one :]<br>  <br>  its pretty good & will also moistuirze yr hair & its perty cheap! like <br>  $8<br>  <br>  but if you don't mind cost i suggest superstar by bedhead<br>  its about $15-20<br>  <br>  <br>  & since you said your hair is like "dead" then this will liven it up a widdlebit and make it bouncy and full of volume!|`|EnYLhQajaa	Sorry, I can't help you much.

00ad97897648101cc10f52e12966697daa	If you stop biting your nails, they will grow in healthy.  A fingernail is like hair.  Once it leave the nail bed, or the scalp, it's dead.  What you do to the nail once it's dead, should not affect the nail that is still alive and growing, right?  Eat healthy.  Nails are made of protein, so eat a lot of it and use lotion and DON'T BITE.  They will grow.|`|wgm9ADfBaa	i dont think so. i bite my nails and i stopped like 2 years ago and they are still nasty looking. i mean they grew but my cuticles are still all messed up.<br>  <br>  good luck :D<br>  <br>  -fellow nail biter|`|q90ozSQ9aa	I do not have that habit, but getting your nails done will not stop you from bitting, i think. <br>  <br>  :/|`|UpJbXh7Vaa	Idk if getting your nails done will help you not bite them...maybe you should try putting some Vaseline on them so they taste bad and you won't bite them|`|mlAFvumUaa	just always have something to do with your hands, even if its bouncing a ball<br>  also chew gum

It's all about your preferences.|`|ejyiJGoRaa	You know, that is kind of wierd. I guess it's just how everyone is, like how our minds are wired or whatever. <br>  <br>  Like the difference between seeing someones arm or butt, only slightly less...severe? I guess it's just a preference/reaction kind of thing.|`|o1rzGR8kaa	You find out, please tell|`|mPsNadNUaa	Because it shows the personality of a girl or a guy
RMqyXQYpaa	if other people have used bepanthen and had no troubles with it then it should be safe.<br>  to be sure, test a small amount on your skin (not tattooed skin) to check your not allergic or have a reaction from it. then apply a small amount to part of your tattoo, start with a thin layer first. then if all clear, go for it.
AA11311516	first off try washing your hair in only cold water. That means washing it seperately in the kitchen sink if need be. Hot water is robbing your hair of necessary moisture and oils. <br>  This is going to help the hair stay moisturised and sleek.<br>  <br>  Invest in good shampoo and conditioner. Bumble and Bumble gentle shampoo and super rich conditioner is my personal favorite. I know CVS carries it now, but alot of salons do to. Suave and VO5 are killing your hair.<br>  <br>  *Do conditioning treatments<br>  *get 5 week trims. <br>  *once or twice a week sleep with olive oil in your hair, or at least leave in 30 minutes.<br>  *watch what you put in your hair (straightening creams, gels, mousse) these usually have alot of alcohol with dries out hair<br>  ****try to avoid the heat products!!! straighteners, curling irons..these kill your hair!! <br>  <br>  all these things are sure to help.|`|CMyPGqSEaa	Get a moisturizing shampoo like herbel essence moisturizing. That way you can wash it everyday and it won't dry out|`|ejyiJGoRaa	Actually, your hair sounds like mine. Is your hair damaged, like do you use heating or any other products to style it? Because that might be why your hair is like that. Also, over time your hair texture can change. Like some people are born with pin straight hair and it could end up curly.<br>  <br>  If I skip a day of washing my hair gets oilyish too. What I use is Dove Intense Therepy and it nourishes my hair so good. It should rehydrate your hair to leave it shiny and in good health. You could also find products made for frizzy hair that will help. <br>  <br>  Hope I helped!<br>  Good luck!|`|ENYkIOPDaa	try getting anti frizz shampoo, and if you don't wash it everyday then put baby powder in it, too take the greasy out. Maybe you should get a Straightener and straighten it every morning to give it the shine and silk back,|`|COTHCpGRaa	take a shower <br>  put some shampoo on it <br>  wash it off <br>  hair dry it <br>  straight in it and go to movie <br>  or go out with some one who you like|`|mPsNadNUaa	dont use shampoo everyday because it can dry your hair out|`|cSgztJSZaa	no you cant unless you use harsh chemicals, when you get older, your body changes, so thats why your hair is like that, i have the exact problem about the greasy dry hair, just wash every other day and dont put sonditioner on the top of your head! hold your hair like your going to make a pony tail, and put conditioner all over the pony tail, and when you get out of the shower, but it leave in conditioner ( not actual conditioner you leave in) try johnson and johnson leave in conditioner and that put it throught your whole head (even the top) dont use too much though then blow dry with a round brush and your hair will be straight if you do that but make sure the blow dryer is on a low settting or else your hair will get dry|`|2DbnttgXaa	right. <br>  i suggest, you change your shampoo to damage fixing shampoo maybe? definitely try 'tigi bedhead' it's amazing, puts moisture back into your hair, then leave your hair to dry a little after washing, then blow dry it, make sure you use heat protector, and maybe even try leave in conditioner?<br>  <br>  at first, your hair may look greasy, but when you get into the routine it will be okay and look lovely and sleek!|`|3LlW0uf5aa	You need to get a good moisturizing mask. I use one from Avon. The first week use it 3-4 times and slowly work your way down to about 2 times a week. I wash my hair everyday with just regular shampoo and conditioner and then after the conditioner I use the moisture mask. leave it on for about 5 min. in the shower (you can put a shower cap on or not it doesn't really matter) and then rinse it out right before i get out. try this and see if it helps you. it really makes my hair silky and smooth. best of luck to you!|`|I5ccK5Qfaa	Use vitemin pro conditioner, and wash your hair everyday but don't put the conditioner on the roots everyday but put it on the rest of your hair.<br>  I hope this helps a lot !|`|BCiQyv7xaa	shave it off!!!|`|CyY4oJJvaa	you should wash it every other day<br>  that's what i do and all my friends are jealous of my hair|`|LLQCjdoaaa	Do you use conditioner? If you don't, try it. :)|`|3lXZzK5caa	straighten it|`|jPO9v02xaa	I had the same problem. My hair was normal as a child and changed sometime in my teens. Now it is manageable again. (I'm 37)  I got my hair professionally straightened about 5 years ago and watched every single thing they did to learn the technique.  Now I can easily do it myself.  You can buy an over the counter straightener.  It takes about 30 minutes from start to finish.  But if you have crazy curly, poofy hair like mine...  you will need to straighten it with a flat iron as well. The 2 have to go together for it to be successful. After you flat iron it, the upkeep is easy - just a few tips:  Make sure to use shampoo and conditioner formulated to straighten and smooth. You can condition daily - but don't use shampoo more than every other day. (too harsh)  Never flip your head upside down to dry it.  (Always blow the hair follicles down as you dry - it helps in the smoothing process)<br>  Don't use any gel or mousse on your hair.  It makes hair like ours greasy and puffy. . Good Luck|`|hUXeAsH7aa	I use l'oreal elvive nutrium shampoo and conditioner. Make sure you give the conditioner a couple of minutes to sink into your hair before you wash it off - and never apply conditioner to the roots! Only the midlengths and ends or else it will appear greasy.<br>  <br>  Then Garnier Fructus sleek and shine smoothing milk and blow dry it.<br>  <br>  I find this makes my hair smooth and silky and usually i can last 2 days without washing it. If you are struggling with this maybe try some dry shampoo? Its great because it removes greasiness so you don't need to wash it everyday and there is no need to restyle it!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps :)
Es2QJ44Uaa	That is gross.  It is for shock value.  People need to find better things to do.|`|7oetZ4I3aa	i wouldn't consider it a trend exsactly only a small hand full of people have it, i think it's a cool idea but we don't know about the long term effects of it, i mean would if it becomes infected, you could go blind. <br>  <br>  but, it's very cool.|`|clInlnIqaa	I think it's extremely dangerous procdure due to how delicate your eyes are.

DeQsKdmSaa	No. Mood rings determine your mood by your body temperature. So if the water is hot, the mood ring will think it is your body. My cousin wore hers swimming every day during the summer, and it just said she was really sad and jealous while she was in the pool. No biggie.|`|cieM9vIzaa	If a "Mood Ring" or any other sort of "Mood Jewelry" is exposed to enough water; particularly when the water seeps into the bonding materials that hold the glass or plastic dome which encases the "Liquid Crystal" (color changing element) to the metal, then there is the possibility that it will stop changing colors or might not change colors as well as it did before.  If there is only minimal water-exposure to just the surface of the piece of "Mood Jewelry", it will probably continue to change colors, however, it is highly recommended to avoid getting your "Mood Jewelry" wet.|`|EzLP6Jahaa	No, actually my friend did it. It depends on what temperature the water is. She did it in cold water, and it turned a green color.<br>  <br>  I've never owned a mood ring or necklace, however.|`|evEJxv06aa	no it only depends on your mood the chances of your moods would chance the color of it.|`|UpJbXh7Vaa	No I don't think so. I have one and I wear it in the shower and it's fine.
ORVQiiQCaa	Could be.  Shaving cream doesn't do anything for me.  When I'm shaving, I get bumps and everything with it.  It scars really badly too.  I've noticed that shaving doesn't help me at all, it just causes more problems.  Waxing and the gel hair removers work alot better.  It doesn't damage your skin.  If you wax, you can get some of the bumps for a few hours.  But they should go away.|`|z5Hl6Bhtaa	Really? It's the complete opposite for me, whenever I don't use shaving cream I have lots of irritation. But it could be because you have sensitive skin. Make sure to always moisturize after shaving, that will help the razor burn.|`|Cil79o9Zaa	u have to put water on the bottom, then put the shaving cream on.... i didnt know how to use it once and i got a really bad cut!

Wait till it dries. It curls better anyway.|`|2DbnttgXaa	the only way it can harm your eyelashes is if you heat them up, this breaks eyelashes off.<br>  also, try not to use them when your mascara on your lashes is still wet, this will rip some eyelashes out when you take off the curlers.|`|6aEhPcDAaa	Nope, just make sure that you don't use a eyelash curler that doesn't pinch your eyelid, because that can hurt, so maybe thats what they meant, whoever said that.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!<br>  <br>  -Erica|`|oCxBeEI6aa	It's bad!

It depends on the movie your seeing. <br>  Funny- Wear the jeans with a red or something else bright (god forbid I say yellow) with another complementing color under neither and a soft colored cardigan. Boots with about a 3 inch heel. Hair down. Make up natural. <br>  Scary- A simple day dress with a nice blazer over it. Gladiator pumps. Hair down.  Smokey eyes and a red lip. <br>  Drama- Grey plaid dress pants and a vintage-equse off white button down shirt with a cardigan. Oxfords. Sloppy up do. Soft blue eyes with a pale pink lip.|`|dMI5u7icaa	Well your skinny jeans are a neutral boring color already so wear a shirt that will POP. with colors like blue, purple, but not black or white because its going to be too boring =\ .  Don't get me wrong those skinnys are awesome. i have a pair just like that. To show off your skinnys like i said before wear a bright/ bold coloured top that kind og flows. Wouldn't want everything to look too tight b/c thats not the style anymore. Also some yellows can look nice but maybe a shirt like this<br>  anddd the shirt should have designs because it would look too plain and boring w/ out.

81tlBAwIaa	LOTION:<br>  <br>  Note : after the mixture is complete you must use quickly and store properly. It is best to make mixtures in small amounts because of the limited shelf life. If the lotions are stored away from the sun and kept cool than there is a chance that they may last up to 3 weeks. However, there are products out there that can add preservation to your products. For example: A mild preservative such as Liquipar Optima may be recommended to prevent growth of harmful bacteria and to protect against a wide range of microorganisms. <br>  <br>  Coconut Milk Skin Soother<br>  <br>  1/2 cup coconut milk <br>  1 tbsp fine oatmeal <br>  <br>  Heat the coconut milk on stove or microwave until lukewarm.

Warm the mixture until the honey is melted, then remove from the heat. When it is cool enough to tolerate, apply to face and neck (or your entire body if you have time). Let it stand for 15 minutes, then rinse or shower off with warm water. The mix can be made in larger quantities, and it will keep for a week if refrigerated properly. <br>  <br>  <br>  Cocoa Butter Soothing Lotion <br>  <br>  1/4 cup grated cocoa butter <br>  1 tablespoon coconut oil <br>  3 tablespoons sunflower oil <br>  11 tablespoons grated beeswax <br>  <br>  <br>  Combine all ingredients, then melt in a glass container in the microwave.

YfdqwYCOaa	A good gift really depends on the person. But you don't need to spend much money on gifts--as long as it looks like you spent time on it any friend would appreciate it. Sorry if these are the cheesiest ideas you've ever heard, I am quite the cheeseball.<br>  <br>  I know I personally don't enjoy getting gift cards; they don't seem as personal and I tend to lose them or forget about them.<br>  <br>  If they're into fashion or cute accessories, get some supplies and unique beads or objects and make them a necklace, bracelet or earrings. <br>  Or maybe a pair of socks or pajama pants with a funky pattern or funny sayings on them (when getting clothing, don't go for shoes, pants, or shirts--if they don't fit or they aren't your friends style they will just sit in her closet. PJs and socks are safer because they're casual.)<br>  <br>  Also, try to avoid lotions, perfumes, makeups, or other beauty products. The friend could be nauseated by the smell, or even have an allergic reaction you're unaware of.<br>  <br>  A decorated picture frame with a funny picture of you two in it would be nice to receive as well.<br>  <br>  If you're just looking for a lighthearted something, get them a bag full of random little objects. Drug stores like Wal Greens, CVS, Walmart are good--you don't need anything fancy. Or in some stores like Claire's  they have a 10 items for $5 bin in the back. Things like little nail polishes, keychains, bouncy balls, or any cool looking trinket that reminds you of an inside joke or memory with the friend.<br>  <br>  Also, listen to them when they complain. If you remember that your friend's headphones just broke, they don't have anything good to read, or they're sick of the way their room is decorated, get something to meet their need.|`|RX4nj825aa	there is this hand blender with the mcdonald animals on it!!!its so cute its like $5<br>  rue 21 tshirts i like them!!1!!<br>  ..|`|yVRnOawlaa	hairproducts<br>  makeup<br>  clothes<br>  jewlery<br>  gift certificate for a spa day

For every girl it is different. Some girls may be in love with facial hair, cause they love the way it looks and it feels. You are not ugly, and I find you look more attractive without facial hair. Maybe you're not going for the right type of girls, or they're not getting to know you. Remember looks are overestimated.. More people should get to know a person, and find out what's on the inside rather than the outside. I find a guy attractive if he has a certain type of charm, and he smiles. Just flash a girl a smile, be charming and nice. Girls like that. And you'll find the right girl :] Good luck!|`|4df2db93737062f3650667e92c4077ceaa	Facial hair is really up to the guy.

HFb8N0Unaa	If you get your hair relaxed, you may want to do a relaxer stretch, or decide to go natural, which is much less damaging to your hair. If you decide to stretch or go natural, you can choose to blow or flat iron the roots straight, or wear it in protective styles. <br>  If you are an avid swimmer, consider wearing a swimming cap to protect your hair from chlorine damage. <br>  Another tip to try is to eat a square of jelly everday. The gelatine in it encourages both your hair and nails to grow. <br>  If your hair is dry to oily, do not constantly touch it and finger-comb it with your fingers. The oil on your hands may "rub off" on your hair and give it a greasy look, also making your scalp feel dirty. <br>  Those with curly/frizzy or Afro-Caribbean hair will have to be patient. The texture of your hair means that growing length will take a great deal of time. Straightening your hair will add length, but be sure that you aren't damaging your hair in the process by using heat and chemicals. Letting your hair air dry wrapped around large curlers or cans is usually an effective and safe method. (if you do have Afro-Caribbean hair, try using a 'Dark and Lovely' product. <br>  Still not fast enough for you? Consider hair extensions, but exercise caution. There are many drawbacks to the use of hair extensions. You must make sure that whoever is applying your extensions is a professional. If applied poorly, your extensions will look both fake and severely damage your hair. Take your time selecting your extensions as well. There are a variety of materials and extensions available on the market, many of which can and will look horribly fake. The other drawback is that extensions must be periodically replaced every six to eight weeks. If you are willing to invest the time and money, then they may be the right choice for you. <br>  If you have curly hair avoid over washing your hair also most Afro-Caribbean Hair products can be found to be extremely oily and may damage skin. <br>  <br>  this will make your hair grow a little faster there is more at the websight|`|lcg1u1U7aa	Your hair is just like the rest of you, it will grow to its' maximum length and then it won't get any longer.  Once your hair has grown to it's maximum (this takes 2 to 5 years depending on what the maximum length of your hair is) it will stop getting longer.|`|YwHl37Hgaa	Massaging makes a lot of difference to the rate at which hair grows, so a regular massage  with any oil of your choice is recommended to speed up the process.

I use Silk Elements products and Profectiv Hair Growth products together, and in January of this year I started taking these hair growth pills called Hairfinity this is my second month taking them and so far I think they're doing okay, alot of the other reviews I saw on it said that it took about 5 months to see like long results, but I have been getting new growth alot sooner and my hair is now at my neck so I am pretty excited I wont sit here and say its the pills but I know that Silk Elements is working, I use the relaxers the moisturizing treatment and then I use the profectiv hair growth oil and grease, and also sometimes the anti- breakage creme. Kinda just mix up the two and I am sure you will do fine. I also wash my hair like once a week, twice if I am like doing a different style ( i change my hair up alot), then everytime I do that I put on the silk elements moisturizing conditioner leave it on for about 5 minutes rinse it off, then put it on again but then I just blow dry my hair and style. When I relax it I use the silk elements relaxer thats in the jar not the box after I rinse as much relaxer out as possible, dont neutralize just yet but a deep conditioner on, leave it on for 20 min then neutralize it. It leaves my hair so soft and silky, and I am really big on getting my hair to shake and now it does. Just try those methods drink a hell alot of water and be patient, it wont grow overnight but it will grow|`|5dEaMPgvaa	there is this medicine that have to put on every night at your hair . why dont you try that ?|`|2PmJbTZGaa	try to trim it
kZyfbt3aaa	I use this foundation, and have for years. Don't use a brush or a sponge, they both just absorb the foundation. Use your fingers for this, then wash them after.|`|mlAFvumUaa	don't use a brush<br>  use a sponge and pat it on|`|hVKYVJ89aa	i would use my fingers with a mousse formulation, just because its too thick for a brush and will just mess your brush up.<br>  id say only use a foundayion brush when using liquid foundations or a sponge.|`|tESdl7gbaa	I used to use a brush and I found it just needed an awful lot of blending. So you can use a brush, just know that you will have to blend so much. You're probably better off applying it with a blusher brush as the bristles are generally made of a synthetic material and won't get so greasy like the foundation, or - and this will probably work best - using a stipling brush and stiple it on, i think that'd work really well.<br>  <br>  Your best bet though is to wet a sponge, ring the water out so that it's a little damp and then apply. It's the easiest method and because the sponge is damp it helps to prevent clogging.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps :)|`|f1608bdb212d4515049acab36a99ef38aa	i find it much easier to use a make up sponge slightly damp the sponge put the foundation on back of your hand so you can pick it up with sponge then apply from the chin a little at a time and blend it into skin then go up the face. i also find it easier to put on a moisturiser 20 mins before you use foundation it acts as a base|`|VlTGV9DUaa	i use to use this with a sponge but it soaks up soo much of the product!<br>  <br>  use a brush now n it doesnt get clogged up, just gently pat it on top of the foundation then brush your face asif u were painting it!

CHkgwiG3aa	There are pros and cons of each, so it depends on what you are looking for, the method of surgery (over or under the muscle) and the incision cite, because the silicone must go in full, so its a larger incision.  I opted for silicone because I wanted a softer and more natural look and feel, and I wanted to go over the muscle.<br>  <br>  Also, the belly button is NOT connected to the stomach muscles, I am assuming you are talking about the rectus abdominis.  The rectus abdominus has 2 heads, that run vertical along side eachother and are used when you flex your spine (sit up or bend forward).  They spit apart during pregnancy so they do not get over stretched and weakened.  This is called a diastases.  However, they do get a bit stretched and weakened during pregnancy.  They move back together after pregnancy, but often not all the way.  There are exercises you can to strengthen this area and close your diastases, giving your abdomen a flatter appearance.   Check out www.maternalfitness.com for more information.|`|mh0QRDE9aa	Don't take any advice from this forum - that is what you are paying the doctor for.

Getting implants helps many women feel better about themselves. If she had 2 children then I doubt she is concerned with guys being able to tell they are not real. Don't answer a question if you dont give sensible advice...I dont have implants but I think that saline is the better choice. Good luck and make sure you speak with a doctor and he/she will tell you your best options!|`|xuwJ6Vn3aa	um, why don't you ask your health care professional. I dont think you should be asking people on yahoo answers about this. They could tell you innacurate info, and then you'll be screwed. Anywayz, no offense but uh.. getting implants is so fake and messed up. You can easily wear a pushup or padded bra, and not to mention getting implants  increases your risk for breast cancer, and other health risks.Wow, haha i bet your a blonde.....so typical. you don't need FAKE boobs to look good. You need a natural look, and guys won;t like FAKE boobs just to let you knoww. They'll be able to tell. haha....|`|vVGCoTZOaa	dont do it!|`|kFsaMJ0Raa	i had silicone implants done about 5 months ago and i am very pleased. i went from an A to a full B 320cc. i wish i would have gone bigger lol, but still i believe i made one of the best decisions of my life, because i have never looked or felt better and shopping is so much more fun because of the way i can fill out certain tops. the whole process cost me about 16k, but you can probably get them done for alot less, as i used one of the best doctors in NYC. i originally wanted saline, but i went with silicone with the doctors suggestion. it feels and looks so natural, and silicone is safer these days i heard, because it doesnt leak. mine was sort of a gummy bear texture. with saline, you could get a rippling affect, and i did not want to take that chance. goodluck to you!|`|45c8efc40e7e7a027962a508f9a1412aaa	I would never want to advise anyone to go for surgery as it just reinforces the whole Beauty myth that women should all look a certain way to be beautiful<br>  <br>  BUT!<br>  <br>  If you HAVE to go for it, make sure you actually do your research. I agree with people on here that yahoo answers is probably the worst place to do this  BUT I would also suggest not turning to a surgeon. They have a vested interest in you getting surgery and preferably with them.<br>  <br>  Go online onto forums and read about people's experiences, good and bad! Although some women feel much more confident after surgery you have to accept that you will look fake (at least when you are naked) no matter what type of implants you go for. Sadly we live in a society which is not just accepting of this but seems to be heading in a direction where hard fake boobs are preferable to soft natural ones. <br>  <br>  If you are desperate and you have given your body enough time to recover and heal from the pregnancies and you have tried all the exercises and oils to get you back in shape and you feel you have no other choice and you are feeling miserable then go for it! you'll probably feel great. <br>  <br>  If on the other hand you're just going through a rough patch and you feel you are strong enough to realise that your beauty and your sexuality are way beyond your looks and cup size then try to avoid putting hard unnatural objects in your body which never ever look real as your body inevitably tries to reject them, as it should. I've never seen any model or actress with fake boobs who didn't look a little ridiculous.<br>  <br>  Maybe even try and think that you are also setting an example for your children and society in its ideals. We are beginning to deem beautiful those women who actively choose to mutilate their body for the sexual gratification of boys or men who have failed to remember what real women's bodies are like.<br>  <br>  Good luck in whatever you decide.

Egg whites will naturally lighten your skin. <br>  <br>  Start by washing your face and pat it dry. <br>  Separate the egg whites and yolk, place them in separate bowls. <br>  Whisk the egg whites and make them light & fluffy. <br>  Place the egg whites on your face and leave them on for 15 minutes. Wash your face throughly and moisturize. After using this process for a while, your skin will naturally whiten. <br>  <br>  Certain stores sell whitening creams that you may be interested in using. Or, you can just use a lighter foundation.

Ugly hair or ugly shoes?<br>  I mean, honestly, hair is a huge part of  first impressions. Shoes not so much.<br>  Seriously, when you look at a person, what do you notice first?

7hIwM2jzaa	Only time will get rid of your strechmarks and even then in years to come you will probly still be able to see them.<br>  None of the creams or oils or magic potions work and if anyone tells you any differnt then they are lying!<br>  I<br>  However if your strechmarks are still red then laser treatment works well, but ONLY if they are still red.<br>  <br>  There are also camoflauge kits that you can get specificly for your body that fill the creases in and cover up any disscolouration. They work perfectly well.<br>  <br>  As for getting your belly toned, stomach crunches and sit ups are the best way to go.<br>  <br>  Surgery is an extream option and there are no gaurentees that you will get the perfect stomach from it, it depends exactly where they streching is. If its just the lower part of your stomach then it could be the way forward for you if you really can live with them, but any higher and it wont really work to well.<br>  <br>  How long ago did you have your child? if its only recently then just wait a couple of years, i have a 4 and a half year old and im 22, my streach marks were horrible but now i can hardly see them, i tried all the differnt creams and oils and everything i could find but the only thing that made them any better was time.................|`|fC7IoWB0aa	if u dunt eat then u loose lots of wait soooo fast. wenever i need 2 loose wait i just stop eating 4 like 3 days n just drink water it works!!!|`|pYs4GiDlaa	go running/walking  and do crunches <br>  itlll help :)|`|QuUoDkBLaa	Reduce junk food, eat more healthily and do regular exercises focusing particularly on the tummy ie. sit ups and crunches.<br>  Also have you heard of Bio-oil? It's meant to reduce the appearance of stretchmarks. You can find it in Boots! (:|`|6NgDHZEEaa	Leg raises do a pretty good job with flattening your stomach. Stretch marks on the other hand, there aren't any exercises for that, but surgery perhaps. The creams don't really eliminate it. You can try Palmer's cocoa butter to reduce its appearance though.|`|FsXTyGH9aa	DONT have surgery for god sake girl..have you lost your mind.. and also thats SOOOOO lazy. You just need to eat healthier and excersize. Try a fitness dvd at home..i do Elle Macphearson because it concentrates on tums and buts and has small arm weight section...its bout 45 mins so you could do this every other day and some extra sit ups when you feel up to it... BUT TRUST ME YOUR STOMACH WILL LOOK DERRANGED AFTER SURGER....DONT BE LAZY...GET A PERFECTLY TONED BEAUTIFUL BELLY WITH EXERSICE AND FEEL GREAT TOO!|`|j1Js4uuTaa	First off start working out, and using LOTS or shea butter lotion to get rid of the stretch marks or at least make them better.

fMPuTA6Uaa	could be any number of reasons actually. Your body could have rejected the ink, or maybe it's just in the scabbing phase (mine on my wrist is red and during healing it was a dark grey)... which brings me to my last possibility it could be the location you got it... Either way you should go back to the person who did it and have them to look at it for you, if it's a decent shop they should be able to fix it or at least tell you if it's normal or not.|`|L3SVAJd4aa	Sometimes certain pigments won't take to certain skins or the pigment isn't inserted deeply enough. It's not necessarily the fault of the tattooist or that you've done something wrong. All you need to do is let it heal and go back to your artist for a touch up. They should do this for free.

eG6tjXp8aa	maybe your putting it on too thick. ive never tried it personally but the best mousse foundation that works absoloute wonders is the maybelline dream matte mousse.<br>  give it another shot by putting very very little on or change your foundation.|`|Eg1G2mvVaa	I agree with MissGill.  I use Maybelline mousse as well and it is brilliant.  You can try it in the shops before you buy and it only costs about ￡5 at ASDA.<br>  <br>  I have never used the Avon one, but I have found that some foundations are too greasy for certain skin.  Maybe you should try something else.

Ive had a bad experience there too (but Ive found some great jeans too).<br>  I travel sometimes for my job, and while I was in S.C. a co-worker told me I should check it out. So next time I was there I brought bags full of clothes, just random stuff I had. The girls were bitches (Im not even commenting on that THEY were wearing...), told me half my stuff was out of style (excuse me?!), but didnt even take my cheesy Abercrombie, etc. stuff but DID make sure they took things I had bought at WALMART and Target!!! I pretty much laughed my way back to the hotel!|`|WFMyoyRaaa	It depends.. they usually give about 1-3 dollars for tanktops and things, maybe up to 10 for nice jeans. However, they are very picky and will immediately say what they will or will not take.<br>  <br>  It probably won't be enough for you to go out and buy a new wardrobe but if you shop there (at Plato's), you can get secondhand stuff for cheap... anywhere from 50 cents to 5 bucks.

MdKmaR9Haa	Just make sure you go somewhere reputable & ask for pictures before you do this. <br>  <br>  I would also try using henna & dying your eyebrows.  Use a Q-Tip or makeup brush to apply it. Results will last 3wks or so.  This is what I do as I have white eyebrow hair & I am way to nervous to ever try the permanent.  Plus going foward, you can change the shape of your eyebrows to whats in fashion.|`|3d9a01d923f6d1eb0ce1d2b8103df0b9aa	Go for it! , do your research and just make sure it's a reputable technician.

It's very convenient not having to put your eyebrows on every morning. Go for it. Mine look natural, no one knows that there permanent.|`|s2QTvrRQaa	don't do it. I did lipliner, which went away and then got suckered into doing the eyebrows, which I regret. They turned a light orange and it doesn't match my brown eyebrow hair. People notice it and I have to color over it, when I don;t feel lazy.  Think  a tattoo, after time it turns colors- like purple or blue. Thankfully, they are not purple. Thankfully, the artist who did it didn't give me a weird expression too, that can happen. So it looks like your anxious or confused. I wouldn't do it all over again. <br>  I looked into laser for removal but the tech said they can turn white (the skin) and my eb hairs would or could fall out. I'm glad he didn't just do it to make money. he suggested I keep drawing them in to cover over the F-up! Good Luck, don't do it. Eyeliner can look good, lipliner can look good but the eyebrows-it's just too big and a noticeable area. Even small beauty marks look good but they need to be small, again, they turn colors.|`|soBnKijuaa	just had semi permanent eyeliner done 5 days ago and love it ! was a bit harsh at first , was strange seeing myself first thing in a morning with my eyes on .They felt a little gluey for a few days but resisted the urge to pick and now they are healing really well and i am very glad i have had it done .I am thinking of having lip blush done and maybe the gaps filled in in my eyebrows too .

Don't be put off by all the Chinese writing on it.<br>  <br>  They should last about 4 weeks, give or take a week.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps and good luck :) x<br>  <br>  (To lessen the pain, i recommend patting talc on your legs before applying the strip, as it stops the strip pulling on the skin).|`|07761845f5a63f0fa7c6c8f41cd6a6a4aa	Definitely Veet.

FEcgdjvsaa	Pour estomper le bronzage d'une fa?on efficace et naturelle il faut utiliser un gomage sur tout le corps. <br>  Si tu as utilisé un autobronzant il sera plus facile de t'en débarrasser que d'un bronzage naturel. Avec l'autobronzant en faite il te suffite d'attendre quelques jours et il n'y aura plus rien! <br>  Mais je conseille quand même d'utiliser un bon gomage pour t'éviter les restes des traces (avant bras par exemple). Ce qu'il te faut dans tous les cas c'est un gomage doux mais puissant, et je te conseille donc le gomage mersea, qui vient de la mer morte. En faite ce qui est bénéfique c'est sa composition: des sels microscopiques de la mer morte avec des huiles essentielles, parfait pour décaper en douceur!! La peau restera douce, et le bronzage ne résistera pas! (Tu peux t'en procurer sur www.chloelesrel.com) La mer morte est connue pour ses vertus régénératrices sur l'épiderme et ses bienfaits multiples pour notre corps.|`|RkiXo6LRaa	un gommage|`|ac6a3335a3826be1e80b38895213985baa	Douches répétées au savon de marseille et pas d'exposition au soleil.|`|bGbmWJoRaa	Il est beaucoup plus facile de faire enlever un bronzage d'auto-bronzant qu'un bronzage fait par le soleil. Cependant, le "remède" reste le même, l'exfoliation!!! L'exfoliation va faire enlever la peau morte peu à peu et ainsi atténura le bronzage. Les auto-bronzants ne colorent la peau qu'en superficie, c'est presque comme du maquillage tandis que le soleil teint vraiment la peau et c'est beaucoup plus long... Bonne chance!!!|`|xUVgykVIaa	A demander la recette a mikael Jackson mais il parait qu'il se fait payer très cher pour ses conseils|`|9zJiZBqtaa	Un gommage corporel !Sinon si tu veux pas bronzer : un séjour dans la Somme.

You can also try using shampoos and conditioners which are purple in color, the ingredients that make it purple tone down the orange. Also, you could redye your hair, but that might be a bit damaging. And, if you're willing to spend some money, you could always go get it fixed at a salon, but that's up to you! So washing your hair a few times (preferable w/a clarifying shampoo) and trying one of the above things should help, good luck!

2929e5287fde4036b7befb75a99f9473aa	I would recommend getting a trim to remove split ends and then giving yourself some hot oil treatments... try to avoid using all products with alcohol in them... Also, at night before you go to bed, if you shower in the morning, you can either dampen your hair or leave it dry, (this works better if your hair is warm and damp) slather on a moisturizing conditioner and comb it through and sleep with it on... you can put a towel over your pillow... do that as often as you can and you will notice a difference, if you use pert or suave I recommend you stop and switch to finesse, tresemme, herbal essences, garnier fructis, or sunsilk... <br>  Also, try to limit your use of straightening irons as much as possible, if you must use one, try to keep it on the lowest effective setting, same for a blow dryer.. blow drying is a little bit healthier for your hair...<br>  I hope that helps...|`|85dd8ab052e936f52fa992db738e6ef3aa	When your hair is damaged by heat that means your hair needs  more nutrients and the right material for that is...  The right shampoo, I would recommend Dove Volume,  The right hair spray, Dove Extra Hold,  And for extra nutrients an anti-frizz cream, From Dove Smooth & Soft.  Hope this helps you!!!|`|a524b9eff94860676304d30a5efb681daa	if your hair is damaged there is no recovering but there are ways to disguise it a bit, use serum or shine sprays, leave in condtioners and get it trimmed every 3-4 weeks if you flat iron or use heat tools often.  Use moisturizing shampoos for damaged hair, pantene restoratives makes you hair feels so soft and shiny. good luck!|`|AA10187573	your gonna have to trim it.I highly recommend infusion 23 shampoo,conditioner and leave in treatment.that's what i do when my hair gets really damage and it works for me.
23bef6c3b00712a58a7f564075c4b575aa	Part it to the side. Maybe create a zig-zag part (walgreens sells some kits to help you make a zig-zag part). Let some of your hair act like side swept bangs. You could pull it back w/ a headband, they sell some cute ones at Forever 21 sometimes. Or pull it back w/ clips. Maybe leave it down or pull it up & make a bunch of random braids & use the clear tiny hairbands. Give yourself a couple hours to expirament in the mirror & try not to get frustrated. Bring a friend over to give imput on what looks good/ bad.|`|a524b9eff94860676304d30a5efb681daa	flat iron the top of your hair use a little wax to seperate the layers for a more edgier look. <br>  For a more clean looks, flat iron your hair or maybe just let it go your natural texture and use a light spray to hold down frizz. Play with it! :)

Ive  had the same problem myself.  Im petite.In school i did alot of sports, so that helped. I can suggest riding a bicycle,jumping rope,or kick boxing for starters.Also doing squats is execellent! Eating protein is alot of help along with exercise. For temp. Victoria Secret has pads you can insert where the buttocks are to make your hiney look fuller.They work nicely. You can also ask your local Natural health food store about what you want and they can suggest certain products to use. But eating and exercise are the ones with the long term benefits.Good luck!|`|gGktc9PSaa	You probably would want to eat lots of fatty and fried foods.

uJhXAeb4aa	hair problems are caused by the products and heating devices that we use. usually straighteners will give you split ends. hair dye causes a lot of damage as well. to prevent split ends, cut off an inch of hair every month, and there is also this good product i know of by pantene pro-v (it comes in a tube and it says that it will take away the damage from 3 months in just 3 minutes) it makes your hair really soft and nice.|`|xTt2jqxeaa	i think its splits because your hair gets too long.|`|718bcc340f3c4afcdcf0581c54a824ccaa	using too many chemicals, weather, hair ties, curling irons hats and many things like that causes damage.

Hz1I22Oqaa	Jergens Natural Glow Daily Moisturizer is amazing. It comes in two formulas: one for fair skin, and one for medium/tan skin. It has never made me look orange, and I've used both of the formulas. The tan builds up over several days, so it looks real and believable. Everyone is always complimenting me on my tan because it looks so natural. A few people even asked how long I had to sit outside to get my tan!!!

The trick is, go with a light/medium and use THIN applications (a few hours between each application) until you get the desired results.

6a69d026579aae5ffd0f6c0361d25e2aaa	I absolutely agree with you!! I have 3 and am going for my 4th one.  I have a really good friend who does tattoos-he owns his own shop. Anyway, he will under no circumstances tattoo anyone under 18 (even with permission), put a name on someone (unless maybe a child), and won't tell you what to get.  You have to go there with a design in mind.  He will talk to you about it and maybe suggest a change here or there, depending on where you want it....He is also very honest about whether it will work where you want it.  You know how sometimes people want a certain design on a specific part and it may have to be expanded or shrunken?  Well, he will tell you upfront that it will or won't work. <br>  A lot of people want a tattoo not realizing exactly what it all means.

Specify, doesn't really make sense<br>  <br>  But I'd start with finding out the proportion of each. This would be<br>  <br>  with x=shoes<br>  2x=pants<br>  (2x)(3/4)=shirts<br>  <br>  and then if you're finding a different combination for each day of the year it would be<br>  <br>  365=(x)(2x)(2x)(3/4)<br>  <br>  I think this should be right, my knowledge of math like this is a little rusty.. good luck!
VThmXyB9aa	Use the beehive braid. Thats where you start braiding from the outside of you hair to the middle in a circle.

CB85sH5Uaa	Since your shopping for school you should keep in mind the seasons--fall, winter, spring.  Look up fashion magazines.  This should give you a pretty good idea what your looking for once you see it and make it easier to know  what to buy.  Also, try new stores!  Think the opposite of hollister and american eagle.  I wish I could see your haircut, but the link didn't work.  I could have maybe given you a better idea.<br>  <br>  P.S. Smokey eye is meant for night time.  Unless you're aiming for goth, you should try lighter colors during the day.|`|mF5j0bsqaa	go to aeropostal and find some new style or pacsun .
aPONZngkaa	I had them, and although they look nice, they're a ***** to maintain. Mine came to a total of $3,000.00, not really worth It. But I made payments every month. You need a special brush, have to make sure you cant see the fuse at ur scalp, It was more of a bother In the end, but I had mine for over a year and every couple of weeks you have to have them all taken out, and have new ones put in.|`|T7ZtRVTWaa	I've had them. They're expensive. <br>  You'll need two packs of good 100% human hair to match your hair color and texture. It'll cost around $60 - $80 for the hair. <br>  It'll cost another $75, minimum,  to get it either glued or sewn in (means you get thin braids across your head and the tracks/hair are sewn in thru the braids). <br>  If you want hair infusions, it'll cost you several hundred to get the hair bonded. It really isn't worth it - it's a lot of upkeep and you have to be very careful with the extensions to take care of them. If you have fine hair, they'll come out fairly easily, and unless you get hair infusions, you'll only keep the extensions in your hair for a few weeks before they come out.|`|f2d136e1758204825a63fd7f9a4b49c6aa	I've gotten tracks and had loose hair braided into mine.

AA11792924	if you go to GoodWill or Salvation Army, they only take donations, they will not give you money for your clothes.  but if you go to a consignment shop which sells higher end clothing, they will give you some money for your clothing, but it must be in great condition.|`|lBw50ySpaa	No!

m8xxJYcMaa	It's great that you care so much about your sister!<br>  <br>  For make-up, try something different.  Instead of putting it on her, why not show her how to put it on herself?  <br>  Both of you could stand in front of a mirror.  You'd put on eyeliner and she could see how you did it.  Then, you could hand her the eyeliner and she could put it on herself. <br>  <br>  For clothing, try playing "dress up."  Don't tell her she MUST wear something.  Let her choose.  Be goofy.  Have fun with it!  Then, when she wears something really nice, tell her.  Tell her why it looks great on her.  Ask her to show off how great she looks to other people.  I think some encouragement here might do the trick.  <br>  <br>  Now, if you try really hard and she doesn't see things your way, that's okay.  That's part of what makes her special and unique.  And that's why you love her so much.  :)|`|la0My6AHaa	You can't expect her to change that fast, shes probably comfortable wearing those clothes, it might take a while but little by little she'll change.|`|AA12016511	Ask her what she like and incorporate in what you like.

NOW listen to me!!!! lol buy a diffuser attachment for your hair dryer.  or buy a dryer that comes w/one and blow dry it.  use a little bit of styling product like mousse or something.

AA11628108	Hi,<br>  <br>  Try using coconut oil from tropicaltraditions.com and using egg white/yolk mask. All you do is whip up an egg in a bowl and apply to your face and leave on 30 minutes. By the way these two things are going to make your face so soft and nice you wont believe the results!!|`|0ds7uihRaa	Please do not put bicarbonate of soda on your face. If anything, it will irritate your skin and cause redness and inflammation, which is far from luster. <br>  Instead, I suggest you start up a good skincare regime. <br>   * Starting off with a gentle and oilfree cleanser (Cetaphil), wash face daily, morning and night. <br>   * Apply a toner with cotton pad on face to tighten pores. (Neutrogena Deep Clean Astrigenent)<br>  * Appy a gradual self tanning facial moisturizer to give your skin a dose of natural sun-kissed color. <br>  * About 2 to 3 times a week, apply an exfoliating treatment such as scrubs or peels (There are many out there suited for different skintypes) to remove dead surface skin cells and reveal new and fresher skin developing underneath. <br>  <br>  ****After doing this, you shoudl achieve a natural, soft, and dewy complexion. If you find that this is too much work, and want an instantaneous but temporary fresher and lighter complexion, do an exfoliation treatment peel. You can do this at home with a home remedy: mashed strawberries and honey mixed together to create a paste to massage into skin and leave as a mask for 10 minutes. or you can buy one for cheap (Freemans Juicy Face Scrubs). However, if you are willing to fork over more cash for more better results,  try Neutrogena or Olay Microdermabrasion, or go to the Spa and ask for a professional glycolic acid peel. These will all reveal smoother and radiant skin.<br>  **Plus, a sheer luminizing foundation or tint can really give a dewy complexion. Try Revlons Bare Lustrous Lotion ($17). This will really make your skin shimmer.|`|2xOfsQFbaa	How about those bronzing perles?|`|3e422bfd8640b40685152732e88cbe79aa	cleaning, exfoliating, moisturizing then putting a foundation in your skin tone works great!|`|RIsaKriOaa	I use Dermalogica Daily Micro-foliant, which gives my skin a glow, if thats what one means.

cae3920de07aa32ac6f35149da7938a4aa	red streaks in black hair? ooh, i don't know..sounds a little middle school gothic to me. the red streaks will look very fake against black hair. nothing looks cheaper than chunky, stark highlights. here's a better idea:<br>  go to a professional and get gentle, subtle bleach highlights. then dye it red! it'll look great because the highlights will look vibrant while the rest of the hair will be darker red. that way you can have the streaks you want AND the red color without making your hair look like a joke. <br>  <br>  note: i hope you don't consider black in the future, because in my opinion, it's one of the worst colors to dye your hair with. it's very artificial and there's no way to fix it if you don't like it. <br>  <br>  good luck!|`|8RXeJg5Faa	No darling. I don't think you should go black if your red headed. Usually it will totally wash out your skin. Why don't you go try on some wigs and see if they match. Or if you decide to go for it, get semi- perm or the 8 washes hair color.|`|HIrFY8hZaa	Red-strawberry blonde to dark brown-black is a HUGE transition. I'd suggest you don't do it.

I'd highly suggest you accept your natural colour.

You can do it now....Even if you have no intentions of pursuing it as a career or making it your main focus.  If you want to do this, Look into Commercial modeling.  This is not like high-fashion runway modeling or anything, but something that you can do locally.  I have friends who have done this.  Basically commercial modeling consists of modeling clothing for different department store adds in your area...People are looking for models your age everywhere.  You know the kids in the jc Penny's adds or sear that model the clothing?  That is what you would be doing.  In order to do this you need to sigh with an area agent.  Make sure you really research who you go with...Many modeling agencies are major scams.  They will take composite shots of you for your portfolio.  Then when a store needs to send out a catalog or something they will call the agency and ask for exactly what they are looking for...Then if you match the qualifications you get the job.  It can be fun...And is extra curricular. And you can quit whenever you want too. You can also make a good amount of money doing this too:)  Good luck!  I definitely think that you sound perfect for this.|`|1mAr8Yodaa	Yeah, I don't think that they mean real modeling. They do this to all people at the mall and they say you look great and then they ask you and if you say yes then you give them your phone # and stuff and they don't call you even if you look good which I'm sure is not true.|`|BH8hBJdZaa	Yes u can be an amateur model, doing some small assignments such as advertisment, like watches(silky smooth hands), shoes(long slender legs), handbags and things which dont emphasize your build...
tmJY2JDbaa	Try to use a defuser, which is just something you can pick up in the hair section or any conveniant store, and blow dry your hair on cool to lock in style better and reduce tons of frizz. As you blow dry spritz with salt water, which you can make at home for alot cheaper then the stuff you buy at the store. Just take a spray bottle and fill it with half water and half sea salt or coarse salt. The salt water will give you beachy waves like Sarah. Hope this helps!|`|b9210af84213772b7934d72a1ec4f913aa	use either the green sunsilk for frizzy curls or the blue for poofy hair or you can mix n macth em' & go to sunsilk.com and get free samples of which one fits you best|`|218facff30c5a18ed9a141934a9eabfbaa	You are using too much product.

When I get out of the shower I towel dry and brush my hair. Then put gel in it, scrunch it, and us the diffuser to dry it. You can add more gel as it dries. You will have big curls then. Then use hairspray. It shouldn't be too frizzy. I sometimes do it before bed, then when I sleep on it, it will flatten out a bit.

Applies in your case. <br>  <br>  I can never understand why so many beautiful women don't think there so beautiful. IS it because many guys don't ask you out? This is because they are so intimidated to approach you and would hate being rejected, I am afraid if you want to meet someone , you might have to do the asking. I believe one of the supermodels in HS had the same problem, guys would never ask her out because she intimidated them and figured she was dating a college guy, even though she wasn't.

arYFacJ6aa	some arent<br>  like my sisters r geneticly<br>  so u can remove it but it can come back.|`|ku5NPnkfaa	My Mom had one on her neck and had it burnt off but the doctor that did it was a friend of hers and did it at his house so it was free.|`|alRLh7yxaa	yeah they can either be frozen or burned off...its pretty painful from what i hear|`|GNXqjKngaa	I've been told it depends on what type of mole.  I had an unsightly one below my nostril (looked like a booger) that I had removed in my early teens.  My dermatologist at the time said that ones that bump above the skin are removable because they do not have deep roots.  But ones that are level to the surface of your skin may not be safe to remove because they can scar or during the healing process, if it is on your lip or something, it can alter the shape of your lip when the skin closes up on itself.  <br>  <br>  I don't remember how much it cost because my mom handled it at the time.  Can't be too much though because it was a very simple procedure.  He numbed it with topical ointment, lasered it off, and gave me ointment to put on for the next couple days until it healed.  <br>  <br>  BTW, this mole has not grown back and its been about a decade since removal.|`|AA10596745	yes they are removable but you need to check with doctor to see how much, some can be done for your co-pay|`|u1AMsbdkaa	they are umm ask a doc how much it costs|`|rOkbD98Gaa	She needs to see a dermatologist, not all moles are removable. Some can be cancerous. She needs to make an appointment with them and then they will let her know if they can or not. They will re-schedule and do it, take a couple minutes. My mom had several removed and paid like 1 thousand something. I would think one (depending on the size) would be cheap. You can try out different dermatologists. Good Luck!|`|Rw1NX5rHaa	Moles can be removed.  I have removed my own mole the same way they will do at the doctor.  Pinch the mole at the base, hold it for 3-5 seconds and it will come off without bleeding.<br>  <br>  Cancerous moles are not raised.  Raised moles can be removed.|`|qUUhcsU1aa	you would have to go to a dermatologist. and if you have health insurance then they would probably cover the medical bill. you would just have to pay the co pay.

AA10813587	everybody has a different personality <br>  some look good some look not|`|Hpv3YptAaa	Yeah, I think Hollister, Abercrombie, and those type of brands are ugly. Also, waay too expensive.|`|SuwWJXjjaa	Prep is short for preppie. I really haven't heard term used alot since High School/ College. The term comes from Preparatory, or someone attending secondary school, like college.  It used to be slang for rich kids that dressed a certain way.  Usually in shirts shown with another shirt under it, or buttoned up and tucked in.  I agree that back in the day, it was guys who wore them. Maybe they are trying to bring it back in style, however, as a woman, I personally wouldn't wear them, but that is just not my style.  As far as farmers wearing them, it's the farmer's rich kids that are attending college that are in frats, that I see wearing them, or at least around here.  They pull it off fine, and I mean FINE! Not that's there anything wrong with that, some people can look "cool" in some things.|`|2DLh9JB2aa	I think it depends what you wore them with- I bet they could look good as part of an outfit.|`|37144fbc26594c8dd02e77509cecc1a1aa	that is definitly what a prep would wear. They look like idiots when they where those shirts and the madras skirts and stuff, but it's thier "style".|`|8xVpffviaa	I agree, a person with a preppy sense of style would most likely wear those. (a prep is a stereotype of a person that is very bubbly and a bit on the ditzy side. They typically like to wear nice clothes, like a lot of collared shirts, and brand names like hollister and american eagle and stuff like that. Again, its a stereotype. Wearing a button up shirt doesn't make you a bimbo. <br>  Anyways, I think some of those shirts are wicked cute! Some people can pull them off wicked well. I like the last shirt, in the light pink, I would probably wear that with a lacy cami underneath. White if you're the more conventional type, a light blue if you're a little more adventurous. Definitely would keep the top half of the shirt unbuttoned so the cami shows. A nice pearl necklace or a chunky necklace would look great with that. Add some nice earrings. That would look cute with a skirt and boots, but you could keep it fun with a cute pair of tastefully ripped jeans if you're into that, or just regular jeans. If you're the type of person who could pull that off, it would look great. :D|`|AeJp5CVeaa	To tell the truth, i like abercrombie, but the shirts there are just plain ugly. They look like something a guy would wear rather than a girl. Some girls can pull it off and look cute wearing that though... Hollister and A&F are owned by the same company. That's why they're so alike. But Aberbrombie is just a bit more pricey.|`|hTPfOWBfaa	I think they'd be cute with some jeans and flats! I'm going with Browney on this one they're cute!|`|jK4k5ZG7aa	I think those are cute.|`|lDNa8msVaa	A preppy person would wear that:]|`|uckVbqfraa	I would wear those under a sweater or something...I would never look gay...Im girlie and not at all masculine...I guess you would look like a farmer in it if you cannot imagine who would wear it... Just because it would look bad on you does not mean that it would look bad on everyone else.

Even too much milk can do a body bad...|`|VNm1GIHLaa	I doubt you would see a differance.|`|HUDSwT3baa	You'll be very healthy.|`|4Ef8yCbfaa	B is water soluble..<br>  <br>  It would be A, D, E, and K.<br>  <br>  <br>  Yes, it's absolutely possible to overdose on vitamins, some more so than others.<br>  The fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K can cause liver damage and other problems at extremely high doses. It would be helpful to look up the ODA (Optimal Daily Allowance) of a given vitamin, as everyone's needs are different. This dosage is the ideal amount for correcting deficiencies and improving bodily functions in case of illness...the RDA won't do much for people not already in perfect health. It's also possible to overdose on minerals such as calcium, magnesium, iron, and selenium, so make sure to stay within reasonable limits of those as well.<br>  <br>  Water soluble vitamins like C, B-Complex, etc. won't cause much harm in case of an overdose, as they will just flush out in the urine once the body has reached capacity. Hope this helps!<br>  <br>  *********<br>  Hypervitaminosis! . Hypervitaminosis is the medical term for getting sick from taking too much of a vitamin -- but how sick you can get and how much you have to take to get sick varies all over the map, depending on the vitamin.<br>  <br>  The fat soluble vitamins are the ones to watch out for, especially vitamin A and vitamin D.<br>  <br>  The water soluble vitamins (such as C and B-complex) are less dangerous, as they do not build up in your system over time. For example, prominent researchers have promoted massive doses of Vitamin C as a means of preventing colds and cancer (though the last time I looked, there was no good evidence this worked). But it points out that it is pretty hard to get sick from taking vitamin C.<br>  <br>  By contrast, taking too many capsules of vitamin A daily can lead to serious and even life threatening illnesses (if you take more than 25,000 IU/day). Hypervitaminosis A makes your long bones hurt, causes your skin to defoliate, and can damage your liver, among other unpleasant effects.<br>  <br>  The other fat-soluble vitamins include D, E, and K.<br>  <br>  Too much vitamin D will make your Calcium level rise, and give you kidney stones -- but it takes 100 times the daily recommended dosage over an extended period of time.<br>  <br>  Vitamin E also is a concern, but studies have focused on whether a high daily dose over a long time will be a risk factor for other conditions, such as heart disease. In practice, few people have become sick from vitamin E.<br>  <br>  Vitamin K is required for your liver to make coagulation factors. Not enough can make you bleed too easily. Too much is not a problem, unless you are taking a medicine to thin the blood (an anti-coagulant), such as warfarin (Coumadin).<br>  <br>  <br>  Finally, the supplement that can be even more dangerous than vitamins is Iron! Supplemental Iron (ferrous sulfate or ferrous gluconate) is toxic in moderate doses. In fact, when larger dosage forms were available over the counter, there used to be tens of deaths per year, especially among children, due to accidental overdosage on iron pills that looked too much like candy. The maximum daily dose for the increased needs of a pregnant woman is 30mg, and that is the most that you can get in an over the counter iron supplement. The pills that are given on prescription for people with anemia (low blood count) who need to rebuild their iron stores have 300mg of ferrous sulfate -- but a handful of the 300 mg pills can make you acutely ill, with vomiting and diarrhea, and other nasty effects (up to and including death if you have a big handful).<br>  <br>  <br>  The bottom line is that several multivitamins per day probably won't do any harm -- but I'm not sure I see any good reason to take more than one.|`|7PbJWEo1aa	Not because the doses are so small.|`|Ki6jlwnbaa	You'd poop a lot.|`|Z1po12EXaa	Most vitamins are water soluable.  That means you could take quite a lot and the extra would just be excreted through your urine.  You might feel sick from them or have a stomach ache, but it wouldn't hurt you.  However, there are a few vitamins that can cause problems if you take too much.  That is because they are fat soluable.  That means the extra is stored in your body.  Megadoses of vitamins A, D, E or K can be toxic and lead to health problems.  For vitamin A it is sfe to take up to 3,000mcg a day.  Higher levels are ok if they are in the form of beta caratine.  Symptoms of vitamin A toxicity include dry, itchy skin, headache, nausea, and loss of appetite. Signs of severe overuse over a short period of time include dizziness, blurred vision and slowed growth. Vitamin A toxicity also can cause severe birth defects and may increase the risk for hip fractures.  The upper amount of Vitamin D you would want is about 50 mcg/day.  Too much vitamin D could lead to Mild problems of nausea, weight loss, irritability or more severe <br>  problems like: mental and physical growth retardation, kidney damage, movement of calcium from bones into soft tissues.  Vitamin E is nontoxic under normal conditions, but could cause nausea and digestive tract disorders.  The upper level of tolerance is about 1,000 mcg/day.  Although a tolerable upper intake level has not been established for vitamin K, excessive amounts can cause the breakdown of red blood cells and liver damage. Large doses are not advised.  Check the bottle to see how much of these vitamins are in your multivitamin.  Then just multiply by 5 to see if you are in the safe range.  Even if you are in the safe range, it is probably a waste of money to take 5 times the reccomended daily amount a day.|`|8quTABk6aa	It depends on if the vitamins are fat or water soluble.  Water soluble vitamins will pass in urine very easily.  Fat soluble vitamins can store in cells and become toxic.  <br>  <br>  Further, heavier metals, like iron can be dangerous in high doses.|`|dzHbx8Zxaa	I once took 12.. the next day I couldn't move when I woke up<br>  I wouldn't recommend it|`|Mj9laiM3aa	Your *** might slam shut.|`|mFfWYlbdaa	You'd be healthy.|`|OYIJyQDjaa	nothing<br>  theyre not harmful|`|TWV0DT9kaa	youd be the healthiest dead person around|`|wWE6u4peaa	nought... u  might get a stomach ache|`|DgEIeREbaa	You can't really "overdose" on vitamins. Most vitamins we already have in our system, but it always good to take extra Vitamin C when you're sick, or zinc for when you are feeling like you are getting sick (this is the main ingredient in Zycam, a great product). Truthfully, the vitamins you take that your body doesn't use are sent through your system and are passed through urine. So unless you want really expensive pee, take the recommended dose. <br>  <br>  ** There are certain supplements you shouldn't take a lot of, like iron. It is always a good idea to consult a doctor**|`|Xka2R4EJaa	I overdosed twice and it was horrible! The first time it happened i thought i was just getting sick then the second time i realized it was because i was consuming too many vitamins! I got really DIZZINESS, BLURRED VISION and VOMITTING.

AA10478980	Talk to your pharmacist about the best OTC product for dandruff.  Usually dandruff can be treated by special shampoos available without a prescription at your pharmacy. These shampoos contain different medicinal ingredients that contain salicylic acid, coal tar, or antifungal properties. Many dandruff shampoos are now more pleasant to use. Recent developments in zinc pyrithione shampoos have made them especially effective. Use them everyday until the dandruff is under control, and then one to three times a week as needed. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.medicinenet.com/seborrhea/article.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.medicinenet.com/seborrhea/art...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Prevent-and-Treat-Dandruff" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Prevent-and-Treat...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.skincareguide.ca/articles/general_skin_care/gen_skin_care_art_21.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.skincareguide.ca/articles/gen...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.howtogetridofstuff.com/health/how-to-get-rid-of-dandruff/" rel="nofollow">http://www.howtogetridofstuff.com/health...</a><br>  |`|QLq8d01baa	I have dandruff too.

SrLmtfCHaa	Puffy Eyes From Crying? Here's Some Solutions To Wipe Those Tears Away<br>  <br>  Most people have experience puffy eyes from crying. As your tear ducts produce tears, the sodium in the tears will cause your eyes to swell up. It is not actually the eye that becomes swollen, but the skin around your eyes including your eye lids. Not only is it uncomfortable, but it is also noticeable. Luckily, there are several remedies for puffy eyes that you can use.<br>  <br>  How Long Will My Puffy Eyes From Crying Last?<br>  <br>  How long do you have to endure those puffy eyes? Usually, the cure for puffy eyes is time. Your eyes need time to flush out the extra tears and to flush them. For most people, it only takes a few hours for them to get back to normal. If you go to sleep, though, just after crying, you can wake up to those puffy eyes because your eyelids were not moving to flush the eye clean.<br>  <br>  How To Get Rid Of Puffy Eyes After Crying<br>  <br>  There are many ways that you can reduce the puffy eyes that you are experiencing. You can try several of these solutions or all of them. But, remember, time is almost always a factor in lessening swollen eyes.<br>  <br>  Water<br>  <br>  Since your eyes need to flush themselves out, you need to increase the amount of water that you are drinking. This will help to remove anything that's in your system that shouldn't be, including puffy eyes.<br>  <br>  Sleep<br>  <br>  While sleeping right after crying isn't a good thing, after being up for several hours, a good night sleep is a great remedy for curing puffy eyes. That's because sleep allows the body to restore its balance and fluids. Once most of the puffiness is gone, get some sleep.<br>  <br>  Cucumbers And Potatoes<br>  <br>  Another helpful solution to your puffy eyes from crying is to place thin slices of cucumbers or potatoes over your closed eyes. Relax, lie down and allow them to sit there for several minutes, up to 15 minutes. These compresses will help to relieve the pain as well as the puffiness from your eyes.<br>  <br>  Do You Need Medications?<br>  <br>  In most cases, there is no reason to use any type of medication on puffy eyes. In fact, by the time most medications would kick in, the eyes will probably be back to normal. You can use eye creams and anti wrinkle creams to help reduce the effects of puffy eyes, but most of the time this too is not necessary.<br>  <br>  Do you have puffy eyes from crying? Usually, this condition is one that will relieve itself far sooner then whatever you happen to be crying about. Take a few minutes to drink some extra clear fluids, get some rest and maybe try a few slices of your favorite vegetables to find relief from puffy eyes.<br>  <br>  I hope I helped!<br>  |`|guazJ8Mzaa	oh i hate tht look.....make u look like a FROG....<br>  we have salt in our tears which may cause fluid retention in the eye area which leads them 2 being puffy n red.......so much liquid is wasted tht it dries out..|`|f49NiNrdaa	You look ugly!

ATn2j5IWaa	Wear white nail polish. Not the white color that you have in a French mani, just a creme-ish white color. Make sure the shade is lighter than your skin tone, that will make your skin look way darker.<br>  Wear lipgloss that is nude colored or light light light bronze. Nothing darker than your skin tone.<br>  Make sure your teeth are really white. Your skin can pop against them. <br>  Wear bronzing powder across your T-zone area. That will give you a gorgeous sun kissed glow. Get a pressed powder style from the drugstore. I like the one from N.Y.C. best. It's only about $3.<br>  Wear a white t-shirt with denim.<br>  Eyeshadow....hmm, not much you can do with that, sorry.|`|KFwXBXv7aa	Get a tan or darker makeup<br>  purple eye shadow and shiny lip gloss(any brand)<br>  wear the latest trends.  look through magazines and malls.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|c5d7f5aca7a8d45c7389eae0620e970caa	cheese noodles? lol!|`|InDS8HqWaa	umm xoxoxo took my answer lol but yeah, do that =]|`|Tt4LJg8iaa	You should pay attention to your weight, rather than your face and hair.Loose weight and spend time on your body and youll get a guy.

BxiUuuaiaa	Try a Chi Bling iron curler.  Like someone said, the ceramic flatiron, but Chi Bling.  That's what my sister uses.  Also, study how they eliminate that crease with horses and their stubborn hair.  I'm not kidding.  Just think about a horse and you'll get it.|`|04cf9baf00af7c60cb3cd58af3f6c7eaaa	To get your hair absolutely straight, use a flat-nozzle blow dryer and aim it at your roots pointing down while holding your hair taut and brushing it continuously. If this takes too much time, then an alternative would be to use a small-size flat iron. Hold your hair directly above your head, then run the flat iron over, pulling it up with the flat iron.|`|yvv5mxlvaa	don't flatiron unless you absolutely have to, it ruins your hair.|`|f7adeada74ab4a6136b4390faed129ccaa	If you have consistent frizzing in the spot where your pony tail would sit then you are breaking your hair by wearing the ponytail to tight or just too much, try the putting it up a different way like in a clip or if you can get a do with bobby pins. If not the frizzy and just the bump then you may be trying to straighten it when it is still damp. If not then you may need to get a flat iron spray (Kenra's hot spray or Paul Mitchell's heat seal). If you don't have a professional iron it could make all the world a difference. Even though the irons from Walmart say they are ceramic, or ceramic plating, it is usually a ceramic coating on the iron that wears off in time. CHI and Paul Mitchell are the best flat irons you can get for your money, I'm not positive about the Paul Mitchell but the CHI irons have a lifetime warranties on them so you don't have to worry about it quitting on you. They usually run around 70-120 dollars depending on which one you get (CHI, PM is a little more), they are worth every cent, invest even if that isn't the problem, they are so much healthier for your hair, and using a heat protector to keep the heat from being directly on your hair you will be in good shape. good luck|`|gcj48JrEaa	make sure you have a thin ceramic flat iron. use a straightening serum or mousse if you need to

oXvc84NGaa	Rastreando las causas<br>  Distintos factores pueden ocasionar alteraciones en la coloración de la piel de las axilas, entre ellos encontramos:<br>  Acumulación de células muertas. Suele ser la causa más frecuente y, afortunadamente, la más fácil de tratar. El oscurecimiento aparece paulatinamente y su principal síntoma es mal aspecto; no suelen presentarse dolor ni comezón.<br>  Predisposición genética. Queda de manifiesto cuando los padres tienen axilas oscuras. De manera hereditaria, ellos transmiten propensión a la producción extra de pigmento en estas delicadas regiones de la piel; las imperfecciones pueden incluir lunares, pecas o manchas de la edad.<br>  Alergia. Se distingue porque la piel se irrita y arde cuando entra en contacto con algún producto empleado con fines de belleza.<br>  Infección bacterial. Se parece mucho a la alergia, sólo que la persistencia de ardor o comezón no depende de la aplicación directa de un producto.<br>  Además, hay otros elementos que pueden agravar el problema del oscurecimiento de la piel, siendo más común el uso de algunos desodorantes o antitranspirantes, ya que el perfume que contienen puede generar manchas al contacto con la luz solar; asimismo, si las fragancias poseen concentración muy alta, es mayor la posibilidad de padecer alergia.<br>  Por si fuera poco, muchos de estos productos contienen alcohol, sustancia que vulnera los tejidos y fija células muertas y bacterias, ocasionando alteraciones en la pigmentación de la piel.<br>  Otro aspecto a tomar en cuenta es la forma de depilación a la que se recurre. El afeitado es una técnica que se distingue por su rapidez, pero lo cierto es que irrita mucho y vuelve a la piel extremadamente sensible a los efectos del Sol; asimismo, algunas cremas para retirar el vello contienen productos químicos muy fuertes que pueden desencadenar reacciones estéticamente desfavorables.<br>  Soluciones, ?claro que hay!<br>  En primera instancia, cuando se presentan las manchas por predisposición genética, sin irritación ni dolor, se recomienda el uso de cremas cuya sustancia principal sea hidroquinona.<br>  Empero, antes de iniciar el tratamiento hay que tener en cuenta que las axilas son una parte muy sensible de nuestro cuerpo, por lo que primero se aplicará peque?a dosis del producto en otra zona, como la parte interna del antebrazo, por ejemplo, para observar posibles reacciones; si no hay molestias, se procederá a usar, pero siempre en forma cauta. Esta medida también se recomienda si se emplean otros remedios, como los naturistas.<br>  En caso de acumulación de células muertas, una de las soluciones más sencillas y efectivas es favoreciendo la regeneración de los tejidos. ?Cómo se logra esto?, limpiando la zona con ayuda de un estropajo y jabón normal o para aclarar la piel (como el de avena); asimismo, y de manera profunda, es factible emplear una crema exfoliadora creada para eliminar las capas superiores de la dermis, hecho que promueve el surgimiento de nuevas células de mejor aspecto.<br>  Cualquiera de estas dos opciones requiere poco tiempo, aunque es más efectivo el uso de cremas, las cuales, salvo especificaciones contrarias en su instructivo, se aplicarán mediante masaje circular máximo 4 minutos, y luego se enjuagarán; pueden emplearse una vez a la semana, y en pieles sensibles o resecas una vez al mes. Nuevamente, cabe hacer la recomendación de que tanto el exfoliante como el jabón para aclarar sean probados antes de su aplicación en otra zona de la piel para comprobar que no habrán reacciones adversas.<br>  Por lo que respecta a los problemas ocasionados por el rasurado de las axilas, hay ocasiones en que el empleo de otros sistemas, como la depilación con cera, es suficiente para erradicar el problema. Además, estos procedimientos retiran el vello desde la raíz, por lo que su regeneración es más lenta y la piel se libera durante semanas de posibles irritaciones.<br>  De igual manera, el mal aspecto de la piel puede deberse al empleo de alguna crema cuyas sustancias sean muy fuertes para los tejidos, algo fácil de percibir cuando la zona luce enrojecida, reseca y con poca elasticidad; en esta situación es mejor suspender la aplicación y consultar a un especialista en productos de belleza o un dermatólogo para que aconseje un producto con ingredientes más suaves.<br>  Un remedio casero ampliamente extendido para aclarar la piel de las axilas es el jugo de limón, el cual da buenos resultados al aplicarlo directamente y dejándolo actuar durante la noche por 15 días; puede utilizarse a la vez que se aplica una crema con hidroquinona (sin mezclarlas) y, por supuesto, no se aconseja luego de que la piel fue depilada o rasurada.<br>  Una buena recomendación en general consiste en utilizar crema humectante después del ba?o o luego de la depilación, ya que como otras partes del cuerpo las axilas necesitan este tipo de cuidados para ser más resistentes al efecto de la luz solar y otros factores que la maltratan y resecan.<br>  Finalmente, si además de las manchas existe ardor e irritación en la piel es posible que se trate de una infección bacterial o reacción alérgica a algún producto, en cuyo caso será necesario suspender el uso de aquellos artículos sospechosos y, sobre todo, consultar a un dermatólogo para determinar las causas con exactitud.<br>  Considere todos estos consejos a fin de evitar molestias en esta delicada parte de la piel, que también merece atención y cuidado para lucir saludable y en plenitud; recuerde, no sirve de nada esperar a que el problema se resuelva solo ni dejar de actuar por pena.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.tnrelaciones.com/axilas/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.tnrelaciones.com/axilas/index...</a>|`|07VRV77saa	no te afeites y depilate no muy seguido xq eso hace que se te encarnen, espera que crezcan y te los sacas todos juntos y los que kedaron encarnados te los sacas con la pinsita (te va a doler) y no te pongas desodrante xq te va a hacer llorar de la picazon!|`|8f9f4fc5e37079edc479b04da487870eaa	Para aclarar la zona de las axilas, debes usar limon, porque contiene alto porcentaje de acido y eso hace que tu piel se renueve, y para mantenerlas siempre blaqueadas debes depilarte con cera...y eso tambien te sirve para los pelitos encarnados que aparecen en esa zona...Pero la solucion para aclarar tus axilas es el limon! <br>  Te deseo mucha suerte! y espero que soluciones tu problema, que en realidad no es un probleema!

I think the general rule is two shades is okay!|`|vup6ylQ0aa	It's not weird because there are so many ppl with blonde hair and brown eyebrows but if you think it looks weird then you can either go to a salon and they can dye your eyebrows a lighter shade or you can go to a drug store and get a lip hair bleach and put it on but it is very important not to have any near your eyes and you can only leave it on for a short time to prevent lightening them up too much so they look unnatural.|`|pwJLMjqmaa	no it could really bring out that new color|`|xeXw9nSEaa	Just put a mild bleach on your eyebrows.

s8NMmAZcaa	There are more womens wear designers than mens wear designers because females are typically more into fashion than guys, and tend to own more clothes than them. The majority of men fashion designers are gay, and I assume they're more drawn to more feminine clothing. I think females don't design many clothes for men because they like wearing clothes themselves, and have a better knowledge of the female body since, well, they're girls. <br>  You need to be really skilled in drawing to become a fashion designer, since you need to make clear your clothing designs. Take some sewing lessons... Try to find some shops and ask if they'd be willing to look at your designs.<br>  Hope this helps! Good luck with your career~|`|bSI6cuNaaa	1st draw all of ur designs<br>  2nd show them to someone<br>  3rd in college go to  designer classs<br>  4th there u go<br>  <br>  <br>  plz vote 4 best answer
LtmlO51baa	I've bleached and died my hair over and over again, and I use the triple moisture and it works great for me.  Sometimes if i put too much that even makes my hair greasy which is hard to do since it's so burnt out. So yeah its a great product and if you know how to use it right it can last you a long time. <br>  <br>  You're really only supposed to take a tab and rub it into your middle and ends, anyone who uses more then that and puts it all over is using too much.|`|c13fbb39554ba275f522beb04199d972aa	neutrogena has hair products????

jvUsqlsPaa	I saw this thing online that says for round faces, longer hairstyles are the best. I have a round face and I had long hair, then I cut it and regret it! Long hair and layers take away the roundness of your face. The long hair creates the illusion of a longer face, rather then a round one. Also if you have a round face and big cheekbones (many people do) wearing your hair all up and tight may look bad, because it may make your face look like a big balloon. Just experiment and talk to various people. Good luck!|`|c13fbb39554ba275f522beb04199d972aa	I have a round face too.<br>  <br>  Here's what I do.<br>  <br>  Keep the length you have, just get your spilt ends cut.<br>  Try to do more up do's.Like,high ponytail,bun,etc.<br>  It creates the illusion of a slimmer face.Just kinda avoid wearing your hair down.<br>  But don't don't get me wrong,if you appreciate the round face that god gave you then wear your hair down.<br>  <br>  Also,wear big earrings.It helps.|`|Bi51BNebaa	hair styles for round faces usually match with short hair - hair that goes about to your chin. for a more slimmer look on your face, hair cuts up to your shoulders are fine too. layers are nice, you could try bangs ? |`|EGW8JUDvaa	i wnat to kno the same thing! i hve a round face too n i dont kno what style i should do in my hair and its also just abt at shoulder length.|`|yOMjf1A4aa	well if you have a round face i strongly suggest long front lairs it makes your face look slimmer and longer.|`|weH3dtbIaa	Well in my opinion, a bob would look good, but then again it might be to much|`|784EwQHuaa	the best thing is layers.|`|ZlkZvgJgaa	layers

XD5ODM71aa	hey,<br>  you just answered my handbag question! id be glad to help you out.<br>  <br>  well, unlike me. you were blessed with hips. that typically means hourglass. but because your chest is not THAT large (just yet)-but still is a good size. =)  you are considered a pear shape. which typically means, larger on bottom (legs and boooottayyy) but. you dont have larger legs missy.<br>  <br>  so, your body shape is kind of left up to personal opinion. and i would day- hourglass. <br>  hourglass meaning.. you have a good size chest top, smaller in the middle, curvier hips. and smaller legs.<br>  <br>  its a great shape to be! congrats =) im a rectangle...<br>   im 5'2 ll5lbs 34D chest and a size 1-2 in pants. noo hipppss at all. =(|`|1NC14GS4aa	I would say Coke bottle and hourglass are the same thing. Generally speaking your waist should be 10 inches smaller than your bust and your hips two inches bigger than your bust. Apple is very round all over with no waist indent and pear is a hip line that is waaaaaaay bigger than your bust. I would say you are definitely in the hourglass category. Even though your waist is not 10 inches smaller you have a definate waist indention.

MGWDvgPIaa	You should tell them the truth and you want to follow your dreams not theirs and you will do anything to get there. You should probley make a deal with them like if i do it i will make sure i go to college or etc.  another thing is if your parents are really mean talk nicely and say please mom (or dad or both) i really want to do this and i will do it for anything ! Just please its my life long dream|`|z4vHfM3eaa	When your mom is making breakfast & your dad is sitting at the table drinking his coffee and reading the news paper<br>  <br>  Just be like "Hey, I got an letter from the school asking me to be in the Beauty Pageant,<br>  And I'd like to be in it so can i or not?"<br>  <br>  Plan and simple hope i helped =D|`|OfHoaWf7aa	Sorry, hun, but you'll have to tell them. You can't hide this forever; they'll soon find out on their own anyway. Why the embarrassment? Did they forbid you to participate in the first place? If so, you're in trouble because you should've listened. If you were allowed, then I don't see a reason why you shouldn't say something.|`|AA11398949	Aw, don't be scared! There's nothing wrong with wanting to be in a pageant. It's not like going up to your parents and asking permission to get twelve tattoos and piercings or something... I don't imagine that they would freak out or immediately scream "OMG no!!!!" Sit your parents down while they are in a good mood and calmly explain about the letter you got. Tell them why you want to be in a pageant. If you're scared to ask them because of monetary reasons, or if they have negative opinions about pageants, you will have to help them see past that. Go over the costs with them, and explain that you could get sponsors to help you pay your fees. If they have negative opinions about pageants (my parents definitely did), explain to them that you won't be doing anything inappropriate. Tell them you won't get an evening gown that is backless and nearly frontless, or a swimsuit that shows absolutely everything. If they don't like all the makeup, tell them you'll go for a more natural look. Let them go gown shopping with you, and pick out all your outfits together, so that there won't be any unwanted surprises. I'm not sure what pageant this is, but there are always more pageants... so if they don't like the sound of this one, try to look for a pageant together that they feel would be more 'appropriate' (maybe a scholarship or natural pageant, for example.) I hope this helps. There's no shame in wanting to do a pageant! Good luck!!!|`|Zwm5piaoaa	why are you so afraid? go for it girl! just show them the letter and tell them how much it means to you. and if they dont listen, with their permission, find another adult to sponser you like a family member or someone close to you. good luck!|`|LnQzkLTOaa	Just talk to them.

AA10215457	You are soo lucky. When I was 13, I was around that weight and I wore a size 6-7! |`|9dtrWO5laa	your skinny you have nothing to worry about!<br>  my best friend is a size 5 also and she looks like she has no hips at all!|`|NiiuZng3aa	actually, if i were you id calm down on the weight loss. 113 is good, but if u keep on losing more your gonna get sick (i.e. hair loss, unhealthy teeth, etc) so remember to eat your fruits and veggies, eat breakfast and excersise at least 15 minutes a day|`|USGm6Wtbaa	actually, it is not bad. ot the age of thirteen your body starts making changes. those changes help you grow up. it is not bad to be in a size 5 pants at the age of 13. it just means you are growing up. everybody is built differently and you are too so don't listen to the people who are giving you crap about your body|`|gGYLOK1vaa	that's not too bad...but i'm gonna be honest..it will catch up to you later. I'd say RIGHT now you don't have to worry too much..you look perfectly fine in your picture..<br>  <br>  just as soon as you start turning 15 or so and if your weight starts climbing then i'd start exercising more often, because if you don't it'll add up eventually.<br>  <br>  |`|xHBdTwBEaa	you are perfectly fine ,there is no need to worry.|`|q99yWpIqaa	You are a fine weight.|`|xbluKawHaa	I don't know your height, but the weight you are at right now is fine because looking at how your body is formed, your hips look quite dense and heavier than some people's hips.  Don't worry about losing more weight because it's not healthy to lose weight drastically.  Also, if you're 5'3", that's actually on the lighter side, while if you're more 5'0" or shorter that is heavier than recommanded in some doctor's lists, but that is not heavy.  That is a normal weight.  Try not to stress too much about the weight and how much you should weigh becuase it's only going to stress you out more and make you worry more.  Just worry about what you eat, but not how much you weigh.  And your stomach being flat is fine, some people tend to like a more rounded stomach because it's more how a woman should be formed because it's more natural.  Yet being flat stomached is more what the models of today look like and are told to aspire to be,  You look more like you are skinny in your arms and legs while your torso is more curvy, like you said, and that's true.  But don't worry about that, if it truly bothers you ask a doctor, but to me you look like you are fine and not overweight.|`|1pX7ulPXaa	yea for 5'3" you should be around that weight even up to 120 is fine. im 5'6" and weigh 104 and i wear size 3 jeans. i have some hips too. its just bone structure. youre growing so youll either gain more or lose more weight. i think when i was a freshmen i was 90lbs by the time i graduated i was 110 lol im 20 now and im 104 so not much of a diff it varies dont worry about it as long as you love your body and its how you want it to look dont worry about numbers.|`|pg71k8ODaa	That's not bad at all! Most girls dream of being your size. I would stay the weight you're at because it's perfect. Curvy hips aren't bad at all, I'm about the same weight and height as you and I wish I had curvy hips.|`|8MOazHQXaa	sweetie, trust me, there are millions of people that are dying to be ur height size and weight.<br>  <br>  you are only 13 and still growing so there is no need to worry about things like this.  |`|htwmvdY3aa	Nope, don't think it's bad. Are you tall?<br>  Because my friends tall and she also wears like a size...<br>  I forgot. I think somewhere between 5-10. :P|`|aHWi7iPcaa	im 5'4, 120 and wear a size 2/3.<br>  <br>  people are different, and there is not one perfect size.<br>  id say that you are totally fine.|`|ahnRerePaa	I am 13, 5'7, wiegh 125, and wear size three and pople think I am skinny, your the perfect size if your over 5'5.|`|jBggD58uaa	its normal im 13 two and i weigh 113 pounds and my pants size is 5 two lol scary.

Your cute, and the reason why guys may not be all over you right now is your not a flirt or simply a ****. Most young guys are not willing to try for the respectable, girflriend girl, they would rather get some *** from the skank, cause she's easy. And trust me, being "easy" is something you never ever want to be. Your time will come, be grateful of how much you have in life and good things will happen to you. Just be smart, and dont feel like you have to look or act different to get guys attention.|`|10f6f8ff2492af3dbff08ab618d1a879aa	Sweetie, you shouldn't be posting your picture on the internet for the freaks of the world to gape at you, especially in your pajamas. You are very pretty. You are also very, very young. Believe me, there is no need to be in such a rush. Kissing isn't going out of style, and you are not in a race. I can understand that maybe you feel like there is something wrong with you because you are moving at a slower pace than your friends, but have you considered that maybe they are moving too fast? Believe me when I tell you that someday, you'll be glad you didn't waste your very special first kisses on some loser who won't appreciate them for the gift they are. You are worth waiting for. <br>  <br>  When you post something like this, you beautiful girl, there are bad people, ESPECIALLY GROWN MEN who will try to take advantage of the fact that you aren't feeling good about yourself, tell you what they think you want to hear, and ask to meet you in person. Please, please, PLEASE, DO NOT DO THIS!!!! Terrible things happen everyday to girls who agree to meet with  strangers from the internet. Be careful, and know that soon, all the things that you are wondering about will happen to you in a beautiful,natural way.|`|USGm6Wtbaa	honestly... it is not you it is your guys in your town... you are a very pretty girl. ne guy will fall for you they are all stupid. be yourself and stick with purples blues and some reds|`|In9smecNaa	Its Not A Good Picture, As From What I can See, Your Pretty.

4V2Odsygaa	 if you change the color you have to consider your skin tone,and not go too light,nor too dark.Try a flattening iron to smooth your hair straight and see if you like that look,to start out with.try temporary dyes first,better yet go to a wig shop and try on different styles and lengths to give you and all around consensus to determine what you really like.|`|u1AMsbdkaa	ooh perfect dye your hair blonde, straighten it, also either cut it or let it grow out to one inch above shoulder length.|`|eUKVavO0aa	dont die it, red hair is becoming a inspiration to other all over the world.

AA10478980	It sounds really neat to me because I love shoes, and was often known for my shoes.  However, I am a grandma, so I may not be the best judge of what would be a good idea for you at a new school now.|`|FnmNETcPaa	LOVE IT!!!!!<br>  also go to like that vans store for  laces ro soemthing like that|`|TQrfkWmxaa	no offense but everyone does that now.. to be known for your shoes you have to go over the top i am known for mine.. i never wear sneakers accept for gym, i wear alot of bright color and crazy pattern heels and alot of metallic but that wont due.. tons of people do that... and 600$ is to much for just this i would send your $ on shoes if this is what you want to do but be creative i personally love charlotte russe for this|`|4XM9MAhMaa	People used to call me Eskimo girl, because I wore those snow-boots during the winter, lol.|`|tkYrGtQFaa	the money you're THROWING AWAY could be used to purchase food for starving children in THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES|`|eG6brYYJaa	i think liking people for what they have it stupid. but that's call with the shoes. just not being "known" for it|`|Ziw7F6T1aa	If I were you I would try to be know for something better even though  your shoe idea sounds cool. Try to think of more things and pick which one suites you best...Im know for my hair, I know its weird but its true. I even got pick for "Person with best funkyest hair" in school.. I change my look all the time and I'm not scared to try something totally wacky and new. I think that being the first person to try something is very cool. And if you want to be known for your shoes than go for it...(I have also been known for my leggings, I have a different pair on all the time and they are really weird patterns and I even wear then under pants with the bottom of my pants rolled up. Everyone things is weird/cool and I just like being different.) So good luck with your idea.|`|uDZXq0cRaa	umm... i guess it's a good idea, but why would you spend so much money for this? i WISH i had 600 dollars of extra money to go shopping with. but i dont because the economy sucks, and my mom is single and my father doesnt pay child support, and now my mom is struggling to keep up with the mortgage. <br>  but what's the point? why do you want to be known for your shoes, when you can be known for your funny personality, or your kindness, or numerous othe better things to be known for?|`|3BDyk9ciaa	well clothing describes who you are, and you're personality, and that should mainly come in use especially if you're going to a new school it tells people a little bit about yourself, and what kind of person you are.

You should at least be able to find cute stuff for at least cheaper prices.|`|IX28GK3waa	If you are in high school, and you are moving to a new school, I think you should want to be known for your sparkling personality and down to earth character.<br>  <br>  All you young kids are worried about your shoes these days.

I wish I had that sort of dough to throw around when I was a teenager.<br>  <br>  Just my two cents...|`|HLeNdkhDaa	dude, sounds sad how you wanna spend $600 just to get people to like you...be natural, nobody likes posers,and you sound cool, dont ruin it by being a phony<br>  but if you still wanna do it, go for it|`|il9Tdmchaa	If it's going to help make you more confident--go for it.

I have bigger thighs (my mother has oh so graciously nick named me Thunder Thighs lol).  I wear heels all the time. They elongate your lets and make you look taller. Especially if you wear them with jeans that are a bit longer. They also cause you to have a "mini butt lift" :) I love wearing heels :) They make me feel girly and pretty.|`|a7a9c9857b51d02851d336bf7020c2cdaa	Just make sure it's not a rounded toe. That will make your legs look short. Also nothing with a strap around the ankle, that will also make your legs look short. Heels are great, and a pointy toe is perfect.|`|FpIhu3tKaa	Only if they're wearing them to a track meet. ;)<br>  <br>  Also, as others have stated, that's not fat.|`|uNGJnEvqaa	of course not---it makes you appear taller and thins you out.<br>  <br>  oh--and fyi--that is soooo not fat!|`|0nR2Rsj7aa	No they say that wearing heels make your legs look longer and thinner so go for it|`|MmXHvBlNaa	They bring the thunder and you can hear them come`n bam bam bam look out she`s hungry!!!|`|abU3d96taa	No, I think it makes your thighs look thinner, WAY better than flats.|`|hzesz4P4aa	NO. <br>  LOOK BETTER THEN SKINNY GRLS

At age 13 you are considered for the Womens division - you are too old for child modeling. And at age 13 you need to be at least 5'7" to be considered by most agencies. So wait to see if you grow a few more inches, then send in your pictures to Ford, Elite and Wilhelmina and they will call you if they like your look|`|QGrteAumaa	way too short.|`|wWE6u4peaa	no picture<br>  <br>  plus theres way more to modeling then looks and ur very short...<br>  <br>  also u marked this as teen modeling. and ur not even a teen :S<br>  <br>  sorry but before u want to be a model. understand that u have to be tall. and that looks are only like 30% of the job.... otherwise every tall think girl would be a model

UtktKSLKaa	I used to really love friendship bracelets so I did some research during that time. I found this really great website: <a href="http://friendship-bracelet.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://friendship-bracelet.blogspot.com/</a> . It has a ton of different kinds of bracelets that you can make. They are pretty cool. You could also buy some books that have patterns or rent them from the library but you probably knew that. Well good luck and have fun!|`|X605sT7oaa	Aww thats cute, there are loads of books that you can get on it :)<br>  I'm useless at it, try trial and error haha<br>  <br>  Answer our question please:<br>  <a href="http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090220104528AAZnDN8">http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>
iLiD8MEKaa	I wouldn't recomend it. <br>  <br>  The girls are caked in makeup and hair products. By the time she's 20 she'll probably have bad skin/wrinkles from all the makeup and her hair will more than likely be fried/damaged from all the curling/straiightening/styling. <br>  <br>  She will probably end up becoming obsessed with beauty and being beautiful and have problems with insecurity or even develop eating disorders. <br>  <br>  If she only does it a few times, she probably won't have any problems related to the above statements. If you want to let her do it, let her do it...|`|i01egybJaa	No, don't do it! 4 is way too young! The nature of a beauty pageant is so competitive. It's a terrible atmosphere for such a young girl. You wouldn't want her to grow up like that.|`|63b55743beb7a12e37d89fb0e78f29a3aa	pls no. those girls look freaky all dolled up in makeup. let her be little and have fun...youll teach her to worry about her looks at an age way too young<br>  get her to take ballet or dance class instead of doing pagents.|`|5WXuGX1faa	Yeah!<br>  Shes young, let her explore whats out there[in a good way].  If you don't let her try, you'll never know what potential she might have. And plus, kids never set their minds to anything and the fact that shes so determined to go into a beauty pageant means that shes made up her mind and shes gonna do the best she can. Don't pass up an opportunity like this.

Hope I helped. :)|`|D8siJHCzaa	Get uneven layers in your hair to add volume and body. Try a wispy side bang if you're feeling adventurous. As far as clothes go look into the hot spring trends this year (neon, khaki, mocassin flats) and try some lengthening mascara (CoverGirl makes the best!) You can find some amazing clothes for a new look for cheap at Marshall's, TJ Maxx, dELIA's, charlotte russe, forever 21, urban outfitters, etc. if you're looking to spend a bit more definetely try nordstrom, betsey johnson, free people, juicy couture, and guess jeans|`|2Hmtwgpaaa	Blond for your hair,definitely,suits your skin type,pastel colors and floaty Gypsies skirts are gorgeous for spring or summer,How about trying ethnic clothes or Hippie chic,All the students dress like that here in Galway and its fab.

dd359cc64852ff6e00d407ac09db7261aa	Hi there,<br>  <br>  Firstly, have a read throug this:<br>  <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Look-Pretty" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Look-Pretty</a><br>  <br>  The idea is to look after your skin: cleanse, tone and moisturise twice daily.<br>  <br>  If you want to wear make-up, then wear it naturally so it's hardly noticable. As for your hair, find a style on the internet and get it cut so that you like it and it suits you (and preferably one that's easy to maintain!).<br>  <br>  As for your clothes, wear what YOU like. Just because Abercrombie, Hollister etc are all popular in America, it doesn't mean you have to wear it. Who wants to follow the crowd anyway? Go shopping and buy an outfit that you really love (from anywhere you like) and be proud to wear it. Only wear what you like, not something you stand there holding going "umm...... well, my friends have all got one so I think I should too!" Fine, if you absolutely love the top that all your friends have, then there's no harm but if you're just buying it to fit in, well... don't!<br>  <br>  Be individual! <br>  I hope that answered your question,<br>  ~ Mystic.|`|p8rxpA98aa	Idk what ur yackin about but I'm sure ur a big enough girl that u could figure it out on ur own.|`|ztj8nBzOaa	Ok so im kinda like you except I'm like 5'4.  So really all I can help with is probably the hair and makeup.  The wardrobe depends on your body shape.  <br>  Hair: Wear half up half down with a part. Straight or curly either one works.  You can poof your hair in the front. If you have bangs, you can take them and pull them back to one side.  <br>  <br>  Makeup: brown eyeliner, eyeshadow- dark brown base, just a normal brown crease, and a light brown above that, Black mascara|`|0YrL2zcgaa	Exude more confidence on a regular basis.  Coming from a guy, trust me when I say it will instantly make you sexier/prettier/more attractive. That's an easy first stepn but MUST be the first step.
x8RA1ENvaa	If you have a pencil and paper you can draw OR you can be creative with food. i know that sounds weird but hear me out. you can take whatever food you have a like build something. good idea?|`|VQzYYYaEaa	I have a wall collage on my closet door. Basically, I cut out things from Seventeen, Teen Vogue, and Cosmogirl and taped them to my closet door. It takes a long time and it can be for whenever you're bored.|`|Cfuy2fHSaa	im trying to learn harmonica<br>  its pretty fun and easy|`|BNmijl0kaa	Find the meaning of life, try google.|`|QBB1V0zxaa	Create scrapbooks! <br>  That's what I do. <br>  <br>  I got a notebook, about A5 size which I had hanging around. <br>  Then I cut out pictures from magazines, newspapers, make mini drawings/ sketches. <br>  <br>  It's really fun :) <br>  <br>  xxx|`|iDAeBNA4aa	How about cleaning up the house or garden for your parents and start making the supper.|`|jdeL3txxaa	Set up some stuff and draw it from different views
6IcPOeggaa	<<<john frieda >>>|`|2diobki7aa	Biolage works if you want to go expensive. It's like $20 a bottle at salons, but works absolutely amazing! It makes my hair soo silky soft.<br>  Herbal Essences and Sunsilk are good drug store brands. Again, not as good as salon ones, but still good. They smell awesome too!<br>  (:|`|z33hxpHJaa	the blue bottle herbal essence really really good! also the papaya kind works good if you get the shampoo and conditioner|`|uBBidRtwaa	Hmm.<br>  Pantene Pro-V Ice Shine Shampoo is quite good, and for conditioners, Aussies 3 Minute Miracle conditioner is quite simply amazing, its recommended in Vogue magazine, it's fairly cheap and it smells nice, you just put it on your hair and leave it in anywhere between 1-3 minutes depending on how much pampering your hair needs, i guarantee your hair will be as soft as silk in one wash.<br>  Good Luck ox|`|MbWGjwODaa	fantasic sames has the best shampoo and conditioner. It works REALLY nice and plus- you dont have to get your haircut while your there.|`|s2DzUnhFaa	herbal escences=== the blue bottle=== the best!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|SF85i9REaa	Try professionals brands more expensive but will last longer and get your monies worth. Sukesia is great and a shine enhancer works well after the hair is dried. I use Biosilk which is a silk therapy but it's heavier than the CB smoothe shine enhancer.|`|12hAf8y5aa	i use a prodect which i do not know the name of but it has papya and lime. really nice. i love it!|`|I4TcC8zkaa	herbal essences, any of them, there amazing they work miracles. :D

LDv4dqLraa	I don't wear a hat, but one method I use for some of my clothing is I get a special oil. I can't remember the name of it but you can get it from those shops that sell puppets and marionettes. they use it to lubricate the inside moving parts and its special because it is waterproof but not oily so it doesn't mark the clothing.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|qvW5ZYruaa	Hmmm. Why don't you stick the thing in fire first.|`|TT0rCi8kaa	Wear a Sou' wester  over the top of it.|`|mMmNEljxaa	Dip it in melted candle wax  or lard<br>  <br>  <br>  I hope this helps
wsxMUdYZaa	I saw a video on this topic here on yahoo, check it out, its really interesting, you can get some ideas from it, tho I think every figure has a specific type of clothing that can help to corrigate the little imperfections :D You cant go wrong with black, and generally it is said that white and red (unfortunately my favourite colours...) make you look bigger than you really are. If you love heels, its a plus - not only they make you taller but in general they make you look slimmer and make wonders with your legs :)<br>  <br>  Oh, I almost forgot the video :D<br>  <a href="http://shine.yahoo.com/event/the-thread/clothes-that-make-us-look-fat-and-tips-for-dressing-thin-380324">http://shine.yahoo.com/event/the-thread/...</a>|`|kEZMwrycaa	Buy them in the right size.

You are paying for the name really.If I had to choose I would pick the first one.<br>  <br>  If you are really looking for warmth rather than style you could always get one from somewhere like LL Bean|`|Rir0Iqrgaa	I'd say the second one-- it's thicker looking with better looking material.  Also, the cool eagle really stands out on that one.|`|tWvM6M0raa	i would choose the 2nd one<br>  it looks nicer and warmer<br>  <br>  it also looks a better quality than the first one|`|IuDWWYTDaa	The American Eagle one looks much warmer and I think it's cuter too.|`|WlSsUf7raa	It's going to be spring soon. So I think you should get one that you won't bee TOO warm in.|`|FDgarm4Zaa	i like them both alot :)<br>  but i think you should get the american eagle one, because its warmer.|`|VJFegqWmaa	2nd 1 looks warmer......... :) but they are both cute :)|`|ek1193Qiaa	the American Eagle one was much better!|`|m0FmS9lqaa	Go with the first one!

3A7xH3qVaa	I switched from briefs to boxers when i was 12 because everyone was wearing boxers, and I didn't want to be the only one wearing briefs<br>  but then last year, when i was 16, I switched back to briefs because I found that I often needed more support, and I could only get the support that I needed from briefs<br>  As of now, I don't think that I will ever go back to boxers|`|a3ZZkY08aa	I switched from briefs to boxers when I was 12...my first pair was a pair of Looney Tunes boxer shorts...LOL!<br>  <br>  I'd never go back to briefs
2qAdwf8Daa	i hav a friend who is rly pretty but rly short, but she likes to dance so it works for her. she said that she doesnt mind being short because she looks good with like any guys lol. when ppl make fun of u being short, its bcuz they think ur cute and confident-- its not like making fun of ugly ppl or anything. the guy making fun of u probably thinks ur cute and pretty and a lot of guys like short girls.|`|bR5r9DMZaa	this isn't a question just a vent. its okay some people are short and some people are tall it's just how your body is. i feel short all the time everyone towers over me in school too. just wear heels =] tall people cant wear heels because they look weird. we are the lucky ones who can =]|`|uH28xTcbaa	short girls are prettier and cuterr!!  dont care about what idiots say about you. By the way, guys like more short girls than taller girls(experience) so...who cares about height? surely that guy was a completely assholee so dont mind about he says|`|a38LoaBiaa	ya i totally understand how you feel im 4'10 damn it sucks but you know what...its ok =] some guys love short girls and the ones that dont , who cares about them?  lol|`|qqdmgz1oaa	If you were 5'10 you would be really self conscious about being tall (until you learned to love it).  If you were 5'6, people will find something else to make fun of you about.  You are in high school.  Everyone is still going to awkward stages so kids will make fun of anyone who displays any weakness to feel better about their imperfections.  If you hold your head high and don't take the harsh words to heart, you'll be fine.  <br>  <br>  Also, if on your 18th birthday you are still not 5 ft. tall, you can get scholarships to college for your height.  It's not all bad.  They didn't give scholarships to girls with big feet.  You will have one up on me when I went to school.|`|OG3MEoF5aa	im the same way..im a sophomore but im 5' even<br>  everyone jokes around about how short i am.. and i use to get embarrassed and feel very unconfident. im not going to grow anymore so i just learned to deal with it and now i laugh at all the really tall people..theres a lot of advantages of being short like by the time u and i r like 40 people will think we r still 30. but theres nothing we can do about being short we can thank genetics lol<br>  but just go along with everyone when they joke around like that...and they prob don't even know how u feel about it either so i would tell them|`|8uy5SZCfaa	them lads will come crying back to you when they get laughed at for having a girlfriend who when wears high heels is a lot taller than them|`|hzQDocWaaa	welll too bad lol

0kXlNWcMaa	girl don't rely on fashion magazines to tell you what to wear.<br>  fashin is whatever you want it to be.<br>  so make your own fashion.<br>  maybe you'll start a new trend.  :)|`|UnGfd71kaa	as long as they are wet look leggings which have the wet look what does the material matter?<br>  it's the effect which is important :)|`|wUiWwnopaa	I've bought pairs from<br>  <br>  Topshop ￡18<br>  New Look ￡14<br>  Internacionale ￡12<br>  <br>  all have a rubbery feeling exterior but internally it is more of a lycra / nylon feel. They are not as stretchy as lycra and probably important you try them on to make sure they are a good fit. One of my pairs is a bit loose so lots of wrinkles.<br>  <br>  At ￡12 it's not a lot to spend and they feel and look great.|`|mOPT7f4zaa	They're called liquid leggings and you can get them at an inexpensive price at American Apparel.  I like the latex the best because it still kinda looks like leather but at the same time it doesn't so it fulfills both trends.
04fd844d2fb4de917c15eec963f99e0caa	The pills do not work.  You might want to try doing some upper body weight training. That may enhance the size due to the growth of your muscles.  The only way I got bigger boobs, was to have three children - and I DO NOT advise you do that! LOL (I do love my kids, though)|`|Nc7clhzIaa	The healthiest & safest & cheapest way to go is to get the water/gel inserts for your bras.  Victoria Secret has them.  I have a D cup and they boost my breasts & make them look too large.  I hope this helps.  However, I take mine out cus i don't want that.  Go try on their bras & see the difference in appearance.  Another option is just looking online for undergarments that will push-up your chest area.|`|HVcga9UGaa	girl I am sorry but there might not be much you can do most of the growing was done in your early teens... other than implants you will just have to live with it .. as for the pills i dont know...<br>  but just te let you know my GF has sam size breasts as you but i dont care i still love them .. so dont let it get to you

Do this about three times a week for about a month (or longer depending on how dry your hair is)<br>  hope this helps:)|`|4tdF05oSaa	I heard the mayo treatment was really good.<br>  Its supposed to be really easy and simple.<br>  I would try it out if I were you.<br>  Here's a video on it :<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6UgXtkIaWGE" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6UgXtkIaW...</a>|`|nfSAAz7Zaa	yup mayo or eggs work|`|AILK0BTiaa	mayo protein treatment... :o)

Ok0bovSyaa	Not that I know of, but I must say, Africa's Best is an AMAZING hair product company, I'd invest in it. They're a little expensive but check into their products.|`|SMsprdMfaa	I would say not to use chemicals on your hair.Why don't you go for some home remedies. Egg whites, lemon juice, oil massages, reducing stress and diet changes can reduce hair fall and make it healthier. You can find more cheap, effective and natural home remedies for hair loss as well as for healthy hair at http://www.wellnesstalk.org/hairfall.htm...|`|b24104f4cf66187aab3d9510fdf1cae5aa	There aren't any that i thought of, but i know if you take a multivitamin everyday and take care of your hair (wrap it up, grease your scalp etc.) it should start to grow on its own, Ive also got my hair professionally done at the salon and i noticed a dramatic difference in length. try some of that, maybe and hopefully that helps
QaGu72v9aa	If it were me I'd wear some black shorts or sweats with a t-shirt and a zip hoodie. That way you can take it off if you get warm and it will be cute for what you have going on later. You could bring a pair of jeans to put on for later too - if you want to.

041d18df5f086710632e48a64ed9c129aa	Happened to me all the time when I was younger!     Best remedy.....      Al you need is Garlic! Yup!     Crush a piece of garlic slightly, (don't make it mushy!) just enough toget the natural oils and juices going.     Garlic Nail Polish sucks! Like we all know, natural anythign is always better than anything "infused with a natural something.....!     Rub it on your nails, Yes, its going to stink, yes, you're going to think I'm crazy! But I guarantee i you do this for 2-3 days, simply rub the garlic on it individually for about 5-10 seconds, then with your finger rub the garlic into the nail bed very well. Then...take a bit of olive oil and rub it over your hands, making sure, of course, to get on your nails. And Rub....do this while watching TV....    Your hands will feel soft!       In about 2-3 Days....stop the garlic and just use olive oil for another day or so.     Then.....give yourself an at home minim manicure.    Soak your nails in warm water and a bit of lemon (for clarification), push back your cuticles slightly and use a nail strengether NOT hardner! You want to strengthen the nail not make it just hard....      Very light coat of the strengether.     Whenever you have a chance rub your nail bed.     So...2-3days garlic + olive oil. (Let sit about 10 minutes!)     1-2days just olive oil    mini manicure-light filing of nails.     nail strengether.     1 week.     Do this about once a month.    You will see a NOTICIBLE difference in your nails!!!|`|efY2tqNbaa	I used to have the same problem :)    I just stopped painting them and using remover, and they are much healthier. That stuff is really hard on your nails.|`|Ae6bUiRWaa	OK i have the perfect Solution there is this nail polish called QTICA  and it is made to harden lengthen and strengthen your nails i used it and it it works great! It is like when you take it of you have totally different nails! When you visit the website it is called QTICA nail growth stimulator! ( it hardens lengthens and strenghtens) My nails haven't peeled in a whole year!! I grantee that this remedy will work, it has worked for me my friends and even my mom! Please try this method! This nail polish really works! All you have to do is read the instruction on the back of the box and you are garenteed stronger nails in just two weeks or LESS!  I love it!|`|DpMnmrK8aa	You maybe lacking in some vitamins and minerals make sure you're getting vitamin E and also gellatin. You can easily balance out your diet the natural way by eating more foods that are rich in Vitamin E, such as vegetable oil, margarine, meat, nuts and legumes. You can get more gellatin in your diet by eating jello, jams and jellies    You may also want to try a nail strengthener and file your nails into a more oval-er shape. when filing don't seesaw back and forth as will Split your nails more and don't use a metal file.
sBJtxJG9aa	you can spice up any outfit with a scarf. you could also rip some of ur shirts/ jeans. my friend once splatter painted her skinny jeans and wore a white tee and white sneakers and that looked really cute!|`|tkRx0qnmaa	lol i know what ur saying i think a belt even though it sounds simple can really spice up an outfit especially ones that are a bit loud (dont do anything tacky though), scarves and headbands can help too
B7cI6RfZaa	well I'm pretty good at makeup so i would say brown,purple and silver eyeshadow for blue eyes, green, deep bronze and chocolate brown for brown eyes, and gray and purple for hazel.|`|RGG30rbkaa	Brown would suit either.

9h5phsluaa	Lol, the people at the top who answered are, well, obviously confused. NAM is a perfectly legitimate and wonderful pageant.<br>  <br>  I have done the National American Miss pageant for 4 years, and I won the state title for Maine in 2006. You can find me in the National Results for 2006 online at  www.namiss.com My name is Hillary Riemenschneider.<br>  <br>  It's real, and as the lady above me stated, the pageant receives your name from girls who already participate in the pageant. There used to be a competition to see how many girls a contestant could recommend.<br>  <br>  If you love dressing up, showing off, meeting new people, and forming lifelong friendships & memories, then you'll love NAM. It's definitely a family event: even your dad or brother can escort you on stage for the formal wear competition!<br>  <br>  So check out the website  <><a href="http://www.namiss.com>" rel="nofollow">http://www.namiss.com></a> , check out the videos and complete your online application!<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  And if you want other tips or information, feel free to email me!<br>  <br>  ~Hillary D.

My oldest daughter had someone from school recommend her when they had competed and then National American Miss sent one the next year.  I found out when we actually competed they have a referral and recommendation program where girls can have invitations sent out to their friends from school, church, girl scouts, etc.  I don't know if they use any other means but I know not everyone gets one because my younger daughter had no friends that were invited at all and she was accepted through the sister application.  I don't know where this other girl go beat up - sounds a bit fishy to me.  Maybe she went to the wrong place but this is a pageant program.  People don't get beat up.  Anyways, hope you go and have fun!|`|4WCH9898aa	My friend told me about National American Miss and I am glad she did! I never received an invitation before she invited me, so I know that they do not send info to everyone. They have a contest fro Most Recommendations that girls can enter and win prizes and that is how they knew you. I entered that contest and put down a lot of girls names that I just knew went to my school and I thought they might like it too. I would recommend National American Miss to you and everyone, I think the other people have never been in one of their pageants before and are confusing it with something else. i hope this helps. Go for it if you are interested! Good Luck!|`|QpNCY2lxaa	Hi there!  It is for real and it is the most awesome program for girls in the country!  Please do not relate NAM to programs such as Toddlers and Tiaras, Little Miss Sunshine, or news reports related to Jonbenet!  This will be our 6th year.  My daughter is the Jr Preteen Queen for Michigan.  Win or not, you will leave that weekend feeling like a queen, counting down the days until the next year!  These portrayls of pageants you see on the media are NOT an accurate representation of what NAM is all about!  Grab your mom and sign up quick!  You will both be glad you did!  I promise!!  I am a NAM mom and proud of it!  jaylecaprara@hotmail.com  I'll answer any question for you!!!|`|aIdBOq3Jaa	National American Miss is an awesome event. <br>  <br>  Check it out - do the research.<br>  <br>  Go to YouTube and search for "National American Miss" you'll see tons of videos that girls have uploaded. <br>  <br>  I know, my daughter has been in the program for two years. We got the invitation two years ago, and I am glad she pestered me until she could do it. She loves it, has made lots of great friends from it.|`|MhWDuumiaa	i got one last year!

I cannot tell you which style you would best like, but I can give you a few fabric pointers. One-lace, big no-no. Extremely uncomfortable and you feel like everyone can hear you walking for miles.<br>  Two-Silk, a big fat yes. The most comfortable possible, but almost indelibly pricier. <br>  three-Cotton, a comfy, cozy in between. Cheap, yet incredibly comfortable.<br>  On the shaving issue, I would suggest a simple wax every so often. Nothing fancy is required, a bikini wax would serve the purpose just fine.

oxL8MEKPaa	BEST-Having layered hair does help, but keep the layers long or your hair will look to full.  The top layer should be at least 5-6 inches long.   If you layer your alot(like some are suggesting) it can look bushy and dumb.Like in the 80's. It needs to be done right. Can you go to a good hair sylist? They have techniques to thin  hair out. Have you tried thinning shears? They cut some hairs and leave some hairs. They work really good. Have someone help you with them. You can get them at the beauty supply or some drug stores have them.  When you use them be careful not to cut to much. Experiment slowly. Start with the ends, then you can cut "in" an 1/2 inch, then inch and so on. But not to much. Good luck.|`|EnYLhQajaa	Get your hair layered a lot. That's how thin hair is created. By layering your hair.|`|2diobki7aa	Get it thinned at a salon.<br>  Some of my friends do this, and it makes their hair a lot easier to manage. (: I hope this helps!|`|ZdF1hx70aa	It makes a slight difference with the weight of the hair. You should go to a professional stylist and ask for your hair to be thinned out. They will do in in the best way. And it will feel so great to have thin hair trust me!|`|pIc6TiYIaa	Go to a salon, and ask to get your hair thinned.<br>  This is a process where they razer some of your hair out. Its unnoticeable that they razored it, but it looks a whole heck of Alto thinner!

My cousin tried dying her hair because she had your same dillemma, and it worked, it did, but her hair was really damaged.<br>  <br>  And that doesn't even work for all hair-types.<br>  I would say your best bet is to go to a GOOD salon and pay the money to get your hair straightened. I've had it done, and it really works. They thin your hair out.. I don't know how, but it works!<br>  <br>  Good luck, and I hope this helps!<br>  Stay beautiful, love <3|`|5sF73gyMaa	First of all, layering your hair would give it the apperance of becoming a lot thicker!!! Try straightening your hair and if thats not good enough you can get your hair thinned at a salon. They have special tools that will do it and it literally strips layers off on your head.|`|12hAf8y5aa	well first of, when you go to the salon, you can ask to get it thinned and they have thinning scissors . also if you straighten your hair, it makes it thinner. thats what i do.|`|LntUwSucaa	I trim mine with a razor blade that you shave with.

It'd be better if you just get it done proffesionaly. . .dying your hair blonde from red is just asking for a mess up. Hope i helped =]|`|Z8d9ipxmaa	You have to be careful with bleaching and then dying over it, as you can turn your hair an undesirable shade (lol), and make it brittle and weak.   You will be able to get your hair blonde again, but you might have to wait for the red dye to fade. Ask a hair dresser what's safe to do. You can only put some many solutions on your hair at one time before it falls out!   It's best to let a professional do a tricky dying job like this.     Good luck. =D|`|tClYrQ1vaa	go somewhere and tell them that you want to strip the red from your hair and dye it blonde.

PRzmwFfgaa	Ask your hairdresser to layer your hair.  This way if you straighten it the layers will still give you plenty of volume.  Please don't glue anything to your head.  That will just rip your hair out.|`|8BG2tqTGaa	you could get longish, thick layers.. not emo style, just so its easier to brush and wash. my hairdresser told me to put conditioner on my hair and leave it, as in not wash it off... i have super curly hair... but i was NOT going to do that... it might possibly work though, so you could try it i spose. i guarantee nothing though lol|`|Zsc1jXuFaa	Well it is genetics, keep it that way, unless you think its ugly, and you may want to get a straightener with soft pads

But try places like Primark :)|`|rYX6Owfraa	try marshalls, tj maxx, etc.  you might get lucky and find some|`|EeabLB5eaa	The Gap. I got mine for $30 idk why but they were on sale. Also Macys and Jcpennys had them for $35. At the gap they had pink, white, black, navy, and red.|`|9MtKzSE8aa	Original all star converse are normally all the same price ranging from ￡30-￡50.<br>  However, if you want fake ones then try primmark. They have loads in there.|`|vpRERM9jaa	amazon
eceLQUj5aa	Studs are the best type of earings to pierce your ears with. The earring has to be turned and you can't turn it all the way with a hoop. My nana did my sisters ear, she used an ice cube and a straight pin and then they put a stud in there. It is going to hurt much worse that way then if you just wait and saved some money. Some places will do it for free if you buy a pair of piercing earings.|`|evEJxv06aa	first make small holes by you ears than slowly push them in it before that put oil so it will not hurt a lot ok.|`|4d3Md9pnaa	If you really wanted it, you'd wait until you could go to a PIERCING PARLOR (note I said piercing parlor. Not fcukin' Claires.)<br>  <br>  Because all you're doing is going to harm yourself, because the hoops aren't even sharp enough to pierce your ears, set yourself up for major infection which will probably cost more than the piercing to treat, and a bunch of other stupid, unnecessary things that could have been prevent if you just waited.|`|vtW3qPZmaa	Actually, hoops are better than studs on new piercings, which is why professional piercers use them and would never use studs.  Studs are more likely to result in infections because bacteria can get trapped in them.  Also the more you have to fiddle with your earrings during the healing process, the more you're likely to transfer bacteria from your hands to the open wound (which is what a piercing is).<br>  <br>  As for doing it at home, that's the stupidest idea I've heard today.  Save up and get them done properly in a sanitary environment by someone who actually knows what they're doing.  All you're going to end up with are infected ears, risk a serious blood infection, and more than likely get wonky holes because you have no idea what you're doing.  <br>  <br>  If you want them done that badly you ought to want to have them done properly and safely.|`|5DJcir9saa	It would be very hard to pierce your ears with hoops as would it be with studs, unless you have actual piercing studs which have a pointed end.  When I was sixteen, I pierced my ear with a sterilized safety pin and then put in some leftover starter studs from previous piercings.  I would not recommend this!!!  Its hard to do and painful.  Wait until you have the money to have them pierced.  Most places only charge for the earrings.  Plus it would be very difficult to pierce both ears because you have to make sure they line up with each other.|`|czAbrzcUaa	No, you cant do it with hoops. They'll be too heavy for your ears too.<br>  Use a needle then push a stud through afterwards.|`|7e80152bdb8d8318404698c1b63f95c1aa	dont do it yourself theres tons of places that even do it free

It happens rarely, but sometimes people unwittingly put out brand name clothing, handbags, and collector's items that are worth far more than their garage sale prices. If you find one of these treasures, snap it up before someone else does so you can have the pleasure of owning an authentic Chanel handbag or so you can sell it in an online auction for a much higher price.<br>  <br>  The problem with finding one of these "treasures" at an unlikely place is that it's risky. You may think that you are buying an authentic Chanel handbag, but the reality may be that it is a very well-designed knockoff that's worth not much more than the materials used to make the bag. Spotting a scam can be easy sometimes; if you're walking in New York City and spot "designer handbags" being sold from a card table on the sidewalk, you can be sure the bags are fake.<br>  <br>  Some scammers are much sneakier and disguise their scams so that you think you are buying a real authentic Chanel handbag. Even online auctions and previously reputable stores cannot be trusted completely. If you're not buying a fake, you may be buying a stolen authentic Chanel handbag. If you do, you're getting involved with criminal activity and may find yourself in trouble if the authorities find out where the stolen bag found a new home.<br>  <br>  Spotting fake handbags is easy when they're being sold in the middle of the sidewalk, but what about when you are buying from someone at a reputable fair or bazaar? What if the seller has a business license and other documents that give them an air of credibility? Even if a business looks reputable, you still need to make sure that you are not being sold a fake handbag. You want the look and quality of an authentic Chanel handbag, not the cheap materials and shoddy craftsmanship of a replica.<br>  <br>  Avoid Purchasing a Fake Handbag: Steps to Protect Yourself<br>  <br>  The Internet can be a great place to look for deals on an authentic Chanel handbag. Comparing prices and looking for deals on shipping and accessories can help you to save money while getting a great name-brand handbag. However, you also need to be wary of online sellers. Shop with a company that you know and trust. If you insist on using an auction site, be extra careful. If you find an authentic Chanel handbag for sale, review the feedback of the seller and find out if past customers have been scammed or if they were satisfied with their purchases. Stick with well-known auction Web sites and not new sites that don't give you buyer protection.<br>  <br>  You should also try searching high-end department store Web sites to see if they have that authentic Chanel handbag you desire. You may be able to buy the handbag online or you can look for a list of stores that carry designer handbags in your area. Buying from a high-end department store is a lot more expensive than buying from an online auction or garage sale, but it's also the easiest and most reliable way to protect yourself from spending hundreds of dollars on a clever fake. <br>  <br>  Sorry a bit long and hope this helps.|`|v2ynaGgtaa	the real cost of a chanel handbag is around 230-300 dollars and some 850  and im pretty sure that no one would sell an expensive purse on ebay

IPpOd2wmaa	Yes you can find them there.  They're usually about $20.  Another place you can find them really cheap are thrift stores...a friend told me about all the ambercrombie and hollister jeans they  have that she gets for her daughter (size 0-2) and herself (size 8-10) and they are $4-$10 there.|`|94ce959de02f790ade613a98ca75d820aa	Yes, they have sales on occasion.  They have store-wide sales at certain times.  But they also always have a few racks of marked down items (at least they do in my area).  Sometimes you can find them in Marshalls & TJMaxx.  Just keep an eye out for them.  Also check consignment shops and goodwill.  <br>  <br>  Join their mailing list and you will get discount cards in the mail.  <br>  <br>  Also try shopping the sale section on their website, or search for coupon codes to use online.

They're blunt, but cut with scissors at an angle.<br>  <br>  Also, as far as good hair stylists go, find someone who knows what they're doing.  You'll usually have to pay about $30 for a good haircut, but it's worth it.<br>  <br>  I like Paul Mitchell.

4UwtViMyaa	hollister may seem to discriminate, but they have signs that they dont pick only certain races or only pretty people. To apply you must be 17 and all you have to do is go by the side of the register and use the screen and keyboard to setup an interview. they then call you back to set it up. <br>  GOOD LUCK!!! =)|`|24Xy8qWtaa	I don't see why you would want to work there if they hire people based on looks but whatever.<br>  <br>  I guess so, you look like the average teenage girl that wears their clothes so.. yeah sure.|`|sZhTwzh4aa	you're pretty, and you have a cute cat too =] <br>  <br>  don't worry about what you look like, though. if they're a store that hires based on looks, you don't want to work there. i'd encourage you to apply anyways, though.|`|spWtg1Cmaa	You are soooo cute!

UMBhfklTaa	Urban Outfitters or JCrew. I know they're extremely different from eachother, but I think both of them bear a resemblance to Jack Wills.
SIdhw9hlaa	they will give you like 50$ for both, they rip you off<br>  your better off selling on ebay or a local ad|`|eWObKmBSaa	NOt much, they aren't in for giving away what it is worth, they are in for giving anybody as little as possible.<br>  Hey, try to sell them to a jewelry store?  YO can ask, then walk away.  Then put an add no the cyndilist, online.  Ask for cash, and they must come in meet you in person to pay.  NOt to your own hse, meet them at a mall or some place that you feel safe.<br>  Cyndilist is safe people buy and sell on it.|`|9VaWal2Daa	okay...trade secret........10k is considered like junk .  About a step up from garbage.   14 K..........eh.......ya might get a few bucks. ....diamonds????  Like actual diamonds, or are we talking chips and microscopic bits here? <br>  <br>  In Europe, Jewelry is all 18K.    Nothing less. <br>  <br>  If you took 10 K or 14 K to a jeweler here, they would laugh in your face and tell you to get out. <br>  <br>  Different  value system in America and 10k and 14 k is more common there.  But it's still not worth alot.  Don't be disappointed with low ball figures,....jewelers will never give you back anything near what you paid for it.   and Pawn shops, by nature, know you just want the cash, so they will REALLY low ball you......take it or leave it. <br>  <br>  Still, even some cash is better than some old junk ya don't want anymore............just be realistic.

9d1SvAY7aa	I'm pretty sure that going down in numbers for gauges just means the thickness of the post gets bigger. It would fit but you'd have to deal with a little bit of pain.

It's embarrassing to have the same haircut as everyone else. Those who started it have moved on already. The next new thing is sexy long layers with a center part- for spring. OR you can part a little off center in the front and layers around the face but no side swept bangs and no part all the way to the side of the head. When grandmas have that haircut (and they do- look at desperate housewives or my mom who is a grandma) it is so time to move on to the next thing.<br>  <br>  The spring is all about sexy- the bob was really in the last two years, it is a little played out but if done right can be timeless- I still recommend long with layers<br>  <br>  Check out Britney Spears in "Breathe on Me" on you tube- so super sexy. I know that isn't so recent but to modernize it you don't need to have bangs (though they look great on her), the main thing is to not layer so much all around the head but more so on the sides/front|`|AILK0BTiaa	get a bob.. :o)|`|DKuly5cBaa	dreams|`|zWMgcIoDaa	a bob|`|or8RGV6Eaa	you SHOULD get layers.They will frame your face and add volume and versatility.|`|ipIej00Kaa	Try bob and curly.|`|brWgDwQTaa	bowl cut all the way|`|2DbnttgXaa	Bob :D|`|zuyrHoc9aa	quad hawk

9y7xSEinaa	Hi there, <br>  wow, you're certainly planning ahead! When I need to get ready for an event, here's what I do:<br>  drink water, exercise, and eat really healthfully, focusing on sleep. Everything else is secondary. You can't fake a good night's sleep or a healthy body. <br>  Next, I try out products that work well for my skin tone. Exfoliate regularly. I like Clinique's 7 Day scrub or Chanel's le Gommage. Those are good for the face. For the body I would suggest scheduling waxing and threading appointments every 2 months or so-- maybe eyebrows every month. <br>  Face masks are a waste of money; they are good for deep cleansing every once in a while, but I would focus on eating right and getting sleep. <br>  I hope this helps.

You need a hollow needle (much sharper than a safety pin), an autoclave (to sterilize said needle - alcohol wipes clean them, but do not sterilize), actual body jewelry (a "small earring" will not allow for swelling), and a sterile environment (your bathroom/kitchen/bedroom/whatever is not even remotely sterile).<br>  <br>  It would be a lot better to pay a couple of bucks to have a professional (as in, someone at a tattoo shop, not Clarie's or something) do it, but if you are going to do it, at least get the right tools to do it.|`|OqD4Z6wpaa	dont use a saftey pin!! it is never ok. use a 16 gauge hollow piercing needle. and you need latex gloves.|`|j1Js4uuTaa	I did that about 5 months ago! I used a sewing needle. Make sure you point the needle in right direction so it doesn't come out the back the wrong way. It will hurt a little. I went slower when I did mine but it worked pretty well. For me, once you make the initial hole, you're going to need an earring that has a pointed end, like the ones they piece your ears with in claires or something, because you're going to have to push it through the back. Also make sure to clean it once a day after that with some warm water along with sea salt mixed in. (make sure it's not iodized!)|`|PHYJcSrpaa	just, use a safety pin!! ha ha ha lol, funny!! that is STUPID doing it yourself, why don't you just go to the hair dresses or a salon and buy an earring and get your ear done by the lady or man????<br>  <br>  hope i helped!!!! ha ha ha nat...   :)  <br>  <br>  (P.S sorry for being mean, i usually am nice and i usually answer questions propally, but sorry i didn't!!)|`|2zYIBE9zaa	get it professionally done...<br>  it doesnt cost much and its a lot safer...<br>  you could get an infection...<br>  plz just have it done at like claires or a place in the mall|`|urom2zqfaa	just so you know cartilage needs to be done with a hollow needle like at a real piercers or else it will with out a doubt get infected and you will have a mess and if the infection gets bad enough it can spread so it is worth the money cause cartilage piercings are way more likely to get infected than the lobes|`|Imx3aMouaa	It would be better to get it done professionally, but whatever. <br>  Use a hollow needle instead of a safety pin, it will cause less trauma to the area. <br>  You might as well just jam the stud through it if your gonna use a safety pin.

7fYVdSKaaa	Remember to use a blush a shade deeper than the color you turn when you're flushed. Generally, if you're cool-colored you should opt for shades of pink and mauve, and if you're warm you should choose peaches and golds.   Thus, when you pick your bronzer it should be either red or yellow-toned according to your coloring. Not only is your coloring important, but the deepness of your complexion is too.   Most bronzers are too dark for pale girls, so you might want to go with a deeper blush with gold in it or find a bronzer made for pale gals. The web has lots of resources. Darker gals face similar problems: bronzers are too light and hey, even darker girls want a sun-kissed glow too! Iman has some great bronzers, and as is the case for pale people, the web is the place to go to find what's right for you.   The placement of blush and bronzer depends on the shape of your face. If you have an oval face, do what all the experts recommend: concentrate color on the center of the apples of your cheeks and blend around and slighly up. If you have a long face, you need to add width. Bring the color a bit closer to your nose (not too much - a few centimeters will do) and blend out horizontally a slightly upward. If you have a wide face, you need to add length. Start your color at the outside center of your apples and blend upward. Make sure that no matter what your face shape is, your application is as light as needed to make an impact. Also keep in mind that blending directions should always have an overall natural look.   As for bronzer, it should be applied where the sun would naturally hit your face: tops of the cheekbones, bridge of the nose, and top of the forehead and brow. Remember to use a big, loose brush and to blow excess bronzer off your brush before application to make sure you don't look streaky. Don't apply a finishing powder to your skin before the bronzer or you run the risk of looking too matte and not allowing the bronzer to blend into your skin and look naturally sun-kissed.   Good luck!|`|LKkfbgfQaa	more than likly its the wrong bronzer for you what i suggest for yo;u to do is go to this website, its absolutely free for makeup tipsi know it will help you|`|pqmuWFWVaa	well, maybe its because you have a picture in your head of how you want it to look. maybe if you use the right colour/shade it could turn out how you want it to. Also, when your applying blusher, you should put the right amouynt on, not too much.    hope i helped x|`|BSMlEEKLaa	hmm, well the order I put make up on is foundation, bronzer, powder then blusher and it turns out good. You have to make sure you blend all of it in, so getting a magnifying mirror will help :)   I think it may also be the products that you're using, maybe try some different brands to find what is best suited to your skin.    Good luck :)|`|KCO6zVa9aa	well yah yu put foundation on bt when it comes to puttin the bronzer on make sure its not to much or you will end up looking orangge and i tell yu this bcuzz i did that once, i mean at  home i couldnt even tell bt at school oh boy!! the lights are white and i looked like a pumpkin lol bt like i said miss LC looks pretty pro wit her makeup i dont think she did it herself the best advice 4 bronzer is to use a brushh that will helpp. ( = GOOD LUCKKK
9eUvCDovaa	There is noo way to repair dead hair, there maybe some products that will make it manageble, but thats it. once hair is damaged its damaged. You may have to cut off all the dead stuff off your hair, just tell your mom that its goonna get worse if you dont cut it off. And also bleaching,highlights,dying, heat appliances, they alllllll kill your hair. Trust me its happened to me, so i had to cut of like 4 inches off my long hair, but now its improving :)      good luck|`|wbkzpYhRaa	Honey, you need more than a trim.

Beauty tips:  less is more.  getting the right colour foundation is so important. because if its dark then your skin, people WILL notice.   brushing a light amount of bronzer powder gives your face definition and glow.

FVWvN07xaa	Why do you let these people get to you?  Like others have said, people like that just want to bring you down for the hell of it, or cause theyre jealous.  People are harsh like that, and if its people on Yahoo answers, don't listen to a word they say... They dont know you, they cant judge you..   Its easy to say hurtful stuff, theyre prob bored and maybe get a kick out off bringing you down..

You have NOTHING to worry about :))    Good luckkk :)    xxxxx|`|c1f7a659ef314c657340ba178c779d82aa	Maybe they think your personality is ugly cos they haven't seen a picture of you but you have a nice personality so I would tell them to p off.|`|cdf9bde60acfd0a622e4bbdccdc9e515aa	you definitely aren't ugly...just not the most flattering picture. you look a bit angry. be happy! :D|`|IJPqueJ5aa	I can't comment because I've never seen what you look like. (Edit: you've just put a picture as your avatar, which I'm going to assume is you. I don't think you deserve to be called ugly.)    People are nasty for all sorts of reasons. Saying you're ugly is often just a way of insulting you, for the hell of it, and doesn't necessarily mean that they think that. I think it has something to do with the anonymity that the internet offers. These people would probably never be so rude in real life, but because it's the internet and there's a distance between you and them, it's easier for them to be as childish as they like and not feel particularly guilty. Don't forget, they're probably here out of boredom anyway and not because they actually want to help anyone.    So you're right in trying not to let them bother you. Because these sorts of people would probably say that kind of thing even to someone who was universally beautiful. If I were you, I'd concentrate on the people whose opinions actually meant something to me :)|`|FQLbY6mVaa	Most of people are so jealous at pretty girls and guys and this kind of people will never say the truth. They try to conceal the reality with showing and reminding some small defects that everybody has.  I know some of my friends are envious about me because of that they always tell me that I need a plastic surgery and my nose must be smaller! But I know that Im pretty and never pay attention to them I even become so happy when they tell me those things because it reveals that they feel bitter of my success and achievements and they want to revenge with telling those stupid things!|`|AA11062756	I wouldn't say ugly, id say hideous! sorry im a nice person and i just cant handle seeing you ask if your ugly. you know your ugly. get some makeup and some surgery if you think your ugly. lets put it this way. my buddy is a 400 pound 30 year old man and says he wouldn't touch you. thats pretty bad.
qX1Mf6Gsaa	It would depend upon the strength of the glycolic acid.  I use a 10% cream nightly and a 5% every morning (always after washing my face) and I follow it with a good moisturizer.  But if it is very strong, you'd be wiser not to use it every day.
WLuEIwp5aa	That's not how Chinese characters work, dude.  You can't 'translate' your name.  You pick characters that have the proper syllables assigned to them to approximate 'Cassie' and you pick the ones with the meanings you like best, since there are several symbols for each syllable.<br>  <br>  However, meaning in written Chinese is also taken from the arrangement of the characters themselves, so while it may be interpreted as 'Cassie' in one way, it's going to end up meaning 'supermarket' in another way.<br>  <br>  Seriously, there's no reason to do this and her name would be written in Latin letters if a Chinese person were writing something about her.|`|22621f93a7534ed2f1a71acf45cf11a4aa	technically, u cant translate names into chinese, just like u cant translate names in other languages (ex. chinese, indian etc.) into english...it just doesnt work...your given the name just like your english names. sorry. just saying|`|Cavz3kAPaa	Do you want Chinese Characters or Pinyin (which they created to help us lovely foreigners) Now, I honestly don't remember much about my 10 or so years of Chinese lessons, but for memory names can be a bit tricky to translate.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't go through a website, because often those free translation services just don't work, and you might end up with "dirt" on you instead.<br>  <br>  Is there a university near you, or a school that offers Chinese languages? Even if you have a China Town near you where someone can do the translation for you (I'd go for the uni first though), that way you are more than likely to get it correct.<br>  <br>  Good luck :)<br>  <br>  Just wanted to clarify something, my Chinese teacher, who was a Chinese native, translated all of our names, however they didn't exactly work out as 'Nicole' or 'Jim', but I believe was more looking at what our names meant, and using that to get something. I dunno, it was a long time ago :||`|RMqyXQYpaa	freetranslation.com

I use a cheap drug store sharpener and I have had no troubles and I have had them for over a year now|`|6VUesjxxaa	Dude, get over it and use a paring knife or razor blade like a big girl.  All sharpeners are essentially the same minus the size of the hole you stick the pencil in - the plastic or metal holds a razor blade to peel off the outer layers of wood and point the end of the make up.  You could use a 25 cent school sharpener.

If you blow dry a curly perm, do it for a special occasion, only one time so your hair can stay healty.  For black hair, use a lot of mousturizer at first, than your hair will obsorb the moisture.
0lnamekJaa	DO NOT USE THINNING SHEARS OR A RAZOR!    If you thin out your hair TODAY... Your hair will continue to grow and eventually the lower parts will be "Thinned" and the upper parts will be thick... And that looks retarded...    PLEASE... Learn by my mistakes... DO NOT THIN YOUR HAIR!    I have super, uber thick red curly hair and in my childhood... Stupid hair stylists would insist on using thinning shears to "Fix" my hair...    After a few weeks/months of growing out, the bottom would be thin and then the top would be thick and curly...    I looked ridiculous.    Please, do not do this yourself...    Please, do not let a pro do this to you...    Unless you use hair extensions and can simply remove them when your hair starts to look stupid, please don't do it...    Layer your hair, yes... But do not try to "Thin" it because no matter how good it looks right after you do it... In a few weeks time, you will see the folly of your decision...|`|nEDv5Qwaaa	no way dont ever do this|`|K7usHFX0aa	Leave it to the Professionals. Thats the best choice.|`|YEK4dIuGaa	NO!

Using a razor on your hair (in a salon, by a professional)  can create some very edgy looks. If it is done right it will not damage your hair.  Just make sure the professional doing it keeps your hair wet the whole time.  If you like the edgy choppy look you will love it.

teltYOKZaa	Yeah i'd get a septum. 1. because they are probably easiest to hide and 2. i think they look cool. Loads of people don't like the look of a septum but that doesn't matter, if you like it then you should get it done. Yes you prob. can flip it up but i'd leave it flipped up because if you keep putting it up and down it could irritate it and it will take longer to heal as well . Septums also look really cute with dimple piercings..      I hope this helped you decide =p|`|c1f7a659ef314c657340ba178c779d82aa	Nose piercings are not too hard just choose a light colour.

Other types of ear piercings.|`|wZYPFtL9aa	KITTY RINGG!|`|njbmqjCTaa	Don't do the septum. Pew. If anything, get a cute little diamond (or fake diamond) stud in the nose. I think little piercings like that are cute, and is easier to hide with a clear ring while you are at work or at other places where you need to look professional. you could also do a belly button ring, cuz obviously that is pretty easy to hide. Or be safe and just get another piercing in the lobe.|`|9e0b3eb053495521ed772cef2058be0faa	Septums are one of the easiest to hide. Have your piercer use a retainer to start (they look kind of like an open staple). Keep it flipped up during the initial healing process. Flipping it up and down will only irritate it and prolong healing. No one will see it unless they're looking directly up your nose.|`|xtgA7Ltaaa	Not to sound overly conservative, but I guess I don't understand why you would want to go to the time and expense of a piercing and then hide it like you were ashamed of it.    Maybe you should use an extension of the five minute rule, wait for about 6 months and see if you still want to do this.|`|gNCNCGwTaa	septum piercing are really easy to hide and look great to, you should get it pierced with a retainer and then its a lot easier to fill up when its healing as thats what i did.|`|Of2B85f1aa	I have my industrial, auricles, and 12g lobes and you can hide any piercing...  Go buy a piercing retainer...  In this case, a septum?  A piercing retainer is a clear piece of jewlery used in place of your piercing to keep the hole from closing while at the same time hiding the piercing. =]

R02vAa48aa	I use Bare Escentuals - Go to a Bare Ess store at your local mall (check the Bare Essentuasl website for a store near you)...They sell a starter kit that has everything you need (including brushes).     It's the best thing I've ever worn. It doesn't irritate my skin and I am prone to rashes and break outs.

As one redhead to another maybe you'll find this funny, I just checked the colour name on the one I have and I use "translucent light" haha It makes it sound like I'm paler than something transparent! haha|`|oCErBpWjaa	I have very sensitive skin as well. Don't be fooled by 'green-washing' and fda approved products. I have been using bare escentuals for over 2 yrs and had no major reactions to it besides occasional redness, burning, and itching. I thought since I have sensitive skin; my skin was just getting used to it so I though nothing of it. Until a few months ago, I started breaking out in pimples which have progressed to cystic acne now. In my efforts to regain my clear, beautiful face, I started my search for "makeup brushes." Thinking my sensitive skin was affected by the horse hair brushes of BE. I came across dozens and dozens of BE sufferers just like myself and finally admitted that it was the BE minerals makeup that had been the cause from the very beginning. I became vigilant in the past few weeks vowing never to fall for another 'big label-brand name' product that masks the cruelty of its products. Don't be fooled. Although everyone does have different reactions to different skin care products, you don't have to see it to believe it. Don't wait for a bad reaction to decide to stop using something. Some people may not have the bad reactions, but the effects are internal which is a lot scarier. Some carcinogenic (cancer causing) ingredients are also used in cosmetic makeup. Harmful ingred. include: talc, bismuth oxychloride 'bismuth', mica, aluminum oxide 'alumina', and titanium oxide. Despite other people's testimonials, everyone should do the research on their own and find out for themselves the horrors or these ingredients. I am still in search of the perfect "natural-organic-safe-makeup" out there.

Most mineral makeup companies use all natural ingredients that are non-irritating to your skin, including mica (the filler), titanium dioxide (for texture), iron oxide (for color), and zinc oxide (for tinting). Also, kaolin clay and rice powder is used for oil control and sheen. These are all natural and non-reacting to your skin.      Go to Mineral Makeup Matter's website to find more in depth descriptions of these ingredients. They also have a link to a list of toxic ingredients to avoid and tons of other helpful information on mineral makeup.     A brand called Everyday Minerals carries the most basic formulas, generally only consisting of the ingredients I listed above.     You may need to try a couple different brands before you find what you like, so don't discredit mineral makeup based on your first or second try. Once you find your brand, you'll be hooked. I promise.

I'm just thinking back to high school,  which was like...a year ago. lol  Not that long.  But, still.  I can clearly remember boys showing off their  "mustaches", aka three hairs above their lip.

Cavz3kAPaa	Hun, they have your best interest at heart. When I was 17/18 I had a bit of a rebel stage, and went out to get all these piercings that my parents didn't want me to get (including my lip), I loved them at the time, but I disappointed my parents in so many ways, because I went behind their back to get it done. Please don't do it.<br>  <br>  If you are really really convinced you want it done, approach them when they are in a good mood. Don't get annoyed, and be calm. If you act like an adult, they are more likely to treat you like one.<br>  <br>  Do some research on the piercing. Risks and how to minimize them, get some pictures of where you want it done. Research the piercing parlor, show them information about after care, and what happens when you want to take it out (I have a tiny tiny scar on my lip where I took mine out)<br>  <br>  When you go speak to them, tell them you know they don't really want you to get a piercing, but this is something you would really like. Explain why you want them. (Don't say anything about fitting in, everyone has them. That just doesn't work with parents! Lol) Tell them about the research you've done, and give them the information and tell them they are free to read it, and ask any questions.<br>  <br>  Then don't push it. If they say no, tell them you accept their decision, and ask if in a few month you guys can talk about it again. Don't get annoyed, and continue acting like a responsible person. If they don't give you a yes or no answer, wait a few days, and then ask if they have thought about it. Just remember to keep calm & not get annoyed.<br>  <br>  Please don't pierce it yourself. That's going to ruin your chances of any other piercings being ok'd, not to mention upsetting your parents.<br>  <br>  Good Luck :)|`|84a92b794a6ae292684ad41ae82b80b4aa	Dear young blood , I have 3 daughters / grown woman . <br>  Ages 18 24 25 .

zBXpB1gBaa	Diane 35 works really well for me. I've used it 8 years, and have no complaints. My skin is extremely clear, and I always receive compliments. I've stopped using it for a month or two a few times, and I developed a blemish here and there; the blemishes go away within one cycle of using the pills.    Good Luck!
kCdISEGqaa	I had a client bring in the picture from the website below and she had it tattooed on her wrist.  I didn't do it exactly like it looks in the picture, we added to it and did the coloring different.  That's the fun of doing custom work!  We did it in a gold tone and she has five children, so what we did was add jewels around it and made it more significant to her.  We put the oldest child's birthstone in the top bend of the heart, then the nest two on the left side, and the youngest two on the right.  Turned out very nice.  Take a look at the charm, and if it is something you like, you could take it in to the artist and have them customize it.

Unfortunately, there is no way to make your hair grow any faster than what it is now. The best thing that you can do for your hair is just take care of it, take good vitamins, and just be patient.

I find my hair grows faster at some times than at other times. You should try and keep it in good condition, and if you want to take some vitamins, perhaps the best would be a multivitamin, but certainly one that contains Vit B Complex and Vit E.  You also need to have good balanced meals, so that you can get as many minerals and vitamins etc out of your food, i.e. plenty of vegetables, some protein and some carbs.  They don't all have to be eaten in one meal, just balance it out.  If possible, depending on the greasiness, avoid washing your hair every day, as it can strip the hair of natural oils.  To avoid split ends and dry hair, use a good conditioner.  And have your hair trimmed, just a tiny bit, regularly every 6 weeks or so, as this will improve healthy growth.|`|2dLf3KHnaa	just tlc brush from the bottom up n always brush ur hair b4 washin it loosens the dirt|`|MEr99qKraa	ur hair grows 6'' a MONTH..r u human? hair grows  at a set rate what ever u do will not increase the speed it grows..only thing that will help u is time nothing else ......except extensions or a wig but it would'nt be ur hair|`|ZLWswKHHaa	6 inches/month is A LOT.

Although you may have not been blessed with the genes...if you take a vitamin called biotin your hair as well as your nails should see a significant improvement in speed of growth as well as the strength. Both play hand in hand...they are both dead. Make sure to keep your scalp healthy-bacteria free. The next thing to do will be to make sure your diet well balanced and full of fruits, veggies, and plenty of water...im not saying dont drink anything else. just make sure that water is always the first thing you are able to cross off as "completed" THEN YOU CAN have other beverages. :@)  ONE LAST THING:  When washing your hair, let the last of the water that you are rinsing shampoo/conditioner out with be cool water.  A cool final rinse can help close the scales of the cuticle, and can help the openings of the sebaceous glands to be smaller as well to help moderate sebum production. This helps preserve the sebaceous glands that secrete the oil that naturally strengthens your hair.
a5wIBM6waa	I have had one for bout 4 years now and i had no problems with it sinking in. <br>  <br>  My friend had one and it started to grow out, his lip was pushing it out of the skin. <br>  <br>  It all depends on your body and skin different peoples acts differently. But when it is taken out it wil close eventually but you will still be able to see a small dot of a scar nothing noticable unless you really look for it.|`|jIyvb2OOaa	yes|`|XBJAewIYaa	it will close up, if u just got it pierced less than a month, it closes up pretty fast. even if u had them for years, it would still close up but it will leave a small mark like a dot.
2CXfSHC8aa	Hair style: Try switching up your hair every once in a while(ex if you have curly hair straighten it every couple week and vice versa). If your hair is straight a fun idea is getting clip-in extensions in cool colors like pink/blue/red but probably not green since green in hair usually looks kinda like mold. And if you have bad skin go to a dermatologist to get acne medicine (it takes a few weeks to work so stick with it). To make your teeth whiter, brush them twice a day like you normally do but after the toothpaste brush with hydrogen peroxide (mix one capful hydrogen p. with one capful water don't swallow it) Get it at Walgreens and see results in maybe 2 weeks<br>  <br>  Fashion: Clothes that fit you is always a good idea. If you are heavier you shouldn't wear tight fitting clothes/ layers/skinny jeans and if you are slender don't wear baggy shirts/boy clothes because you will look lost in them. Fitted shirts are good. And several pairs of cute-fitting jeans in different washes. And if you are slender, buy a few close-fitting tank tops in different colors and layer your shirts sometimes(limit the layers to 2) to switch things up. Add a few fun accessories too. The colors don't always have to match. Ex yellow shirt with pink hoop earrings. And denim skirts with knee/ thigh socks are cute. Dont dress trashy!<br>  <br>  Stores: Kohl's, Rue21, Delia's, Wet Seal, Boston Store, Macy's, Old Navy, Aeropostale(good tank tops),www.alloy.com(on-line store, ask you parents to buy stuff for you), Dots (their clothes are kinda cheaply made so sometimes they don't last long but sometimes you can find cool things), Try places like Kmart, Walmart, Target, Sears every now and then because sometimes they have nice clothes. Claire's has LOTS of funky accessories and you can buy clip-in highlights there too. You don't always have to shop at places like Abercrombie or Hollister. Expensive doesn't always mean better, wear clothes that you like( I think Abercrombie clothes are boring!)<br>  <br>  Popularity: All I can say is be nice to everyone. Talk to the popular kids and the nerds. Don't judge people by what others say about them or be mean because you think you better than someone. You don't have to be friends with everyone but at least you won't have any enemies.  Dont associate with bad influences ( like the girls who are 13 with 20 yr old boyfriends or doing drugs)Look nice, be nice, don't tell secrets, don't swear ( lots of teens are using F**K, FA**OT, SL*T a lot,words like those are disgusting)and don't smell! Pretty lengthy but I hope I help!|`|OuTCtdLzaa	Well this is at my school so idk if its the same at ur school<br>  fashion styles - kinda cute and girlyy<br>  hair styles - side swept bangs with either curly or straight hair<br>  <a href="http://i5.photobucket.com/albums/y154/bri_times10/BRIcool085.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i5.photobucket.com/albums/y154/br...</a><br>  <a href="http://img2.timeinc.net/people/i/2007/specials/chase/kirstendunst/kirsten_dunst2.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img2.timeinc.net/people/i/2007/sp...</a><br>  clothes - jeans with boots, flats, or birkenstocks any shirt really from the following stores<br>  best cool clothe stores - Hollister, Abercrombie, and American Eagle<br>  <br>  Start talking to some of the more popular girls a little bit and then start talking 2 them a little more ask them if u can sit with you at lunch and stuff like that|`|13LutlWBaa	i'm pretty sure having fashion doesn't make you popular (though i'm a high school guy), and people become popular because they are outgoing (and sometimes with the girls good looking).  i'm pretty popular at my high school and it's really not that great.  i mean having friends is really good and i have a lot of good friends but when guys just shake your hand to fit in is just kinda weird.  the only good thing about being popular from my perspective is meeting good looking girls.  and you're in middle school, just hang out with your friends and have fun, don't worry about being popular.|`|jZguzD2Raa	cute stuff<br>  curly/straight<br>  abercrombie, hollister, aeropostale, charlotte russe, that sorta stuff<br>  <br>  do stuff to make people look up to u. why do u  have to b popular anyway? just do what u want and have an awesome group of friends who u love and who love u!|`|Dujw71Muaa	If you want to worry about popularity, just be yourself. Trying to be something else only makes you look worse. Be a leader, not a follower. Go with what you think is a good choice for your different styles. Try to start your own trend in school with what you think make good styles. Maybe people will start to follow it and you might become popular.|`|5f9hg9craa	Highlight your hair pink or a different color<br>  have hair up to your shoulders<br>  Funny T-shirt saying funny stuff (Example: Up here (Arrow up) not here)<br>  Go to a west49 or something similar<br>  <br>  Being popular actually means going up to people and start to talk whats on your mind.|`|m0JxvNetaa	Study mathematics and win the Nobel prize for physics.|`|BQwM1EEeaa	dont try so hard, please.<br>  and, just be confident.
