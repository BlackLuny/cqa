20090223134409AAcVwub	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	How fast can I get my tenant evicted?	I have a tenant that has fallen a few months behind on rent. I am trying to work with her but she is falling further behind every month. Her lease expired and the end of last month. I am obviously not going to renew it until she catches up. Now I understand that I can get her evicted very quickly on the grounds of an expired lease. But does that change if I allow her to continue living in the premise paying rent on a month to month basis? Will the courts view this differently then an expired lease, even if I am just trying to work with her to let her catch up?
20090223114738AAozstH	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	What do you think of my stimulus plan?	Here's my plan.  If you are upside down on your home, but you have the income, savings and credit score to buy a bigger, more expensive short-sale or foreclosure... here's the plan...      Say you owe 300,000 on a home, but you can only sell it for 280,000 (neglecting other closing costs, commissions etc...), you will be able to roll over that negative equity into a new home (say a 400,000) as long as the sales price of the new home, plus your negative equity, does not exceed an 80% LTV... so...      your home: 300000   Sales Price 280000   negative equity: 20000      New home sales price: 380000   Appraised value: 500000   New mortgage amount (new home sales price + negative equity): 400,000 (80% LTV).      This would enable people with solid jobs and good credit to buy more expensive homes in foreclosure, and sell their less expensive homes to new home buyers...

20090223132046AARsZa1	Business & Finance;Small Business	Should a company fire me for taking a few bags?	A couple of years ago the company I worked for noticed on video that I put a few bags in my pocket at the end of the day. This company gets prescription medication ready for customers. When I put these bags in my pocket I didn't even know what I would do with them and figured it is only worth cents under a dollar. When I tried for unemployment they held this against me and I never got any benefits. Since the cost of these bags was so little shouldn't I have been warned about it first before getting fired and should I have fought to get unemployment or would I have never won for unemployment?

20090223131400AAJhN1h	Business & Finance;Personal Finance	15 years old, how can i earn money?	I'm 15 and my schools going on a trip to Italy and Rome and I really want to go.  Its like $2500 which I know is really expensive.  I don't want to ask my parents to pay for most of it, I'd like to be responsible and fund it myself.  I also don't want to ask that as my birthday present instead of a car on my 16 birthday which is only about six months away because in the long run a car would be better.      I'd really like to experience this trip because unlike most the kids going, I've always wanted to see the ancient greek statues and buildings.  They've just always amazed me.  So heres the question.      How can I earn this money?  I'm not 16 so no store or restuarant is going to hire me and theres not really any kids around that I could baby sit.      Any answers that are actually worth my time would be greatly appriciated.

20090223113942AAxv6pz	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Law & Legal	What career path should I INVEST myself into?	Career experts, aviators, psychiatric technicians, fitness trainers, Teachers/Coaches and anyone else with first hand knowledge in these respective areas, this is for you.      I am 29. I have a 10 month old baby girl. I recently passed the GED test with my scores in the top 86%-99% rank, meaning in the top 1%-14% in each of the subjects given. I spent 10 years as a critically successful artist. However, due to the financial aspect(I refuse to go commercial and I have a family to feed), and the fact that I'm burned out, I would like to take full advantage of my recent layoff from my "day job", and find a new passion/career and excel in it, both for myself and my family.      After an entire year of 'deliberation' with myself and my wife, I have formulated a plan to obtain a vocational certificate while I am unemployed, and then to get a better job than what I had before, so that I can realistically pursue my degree.      However, I have had a great deal of stress stemming from my background, which is where you guys come in:      - Ages 15-18, I had spent some time in two private psychiatric facilities on four different occasions for depression/suicidal thoughts. Two of those were for documented 'attempts'. I was just crying for help and going about it the wrong way.      .Obviously, I dropped out of high school. I now have a GED.      .I have a misdemeanor "hit and run (property damage)" on my record(2004).   -4 years probation for this incident, 3 years for the hit and run, and 1 year for driving without insurance.   -I spent a night in the holding cell (2004).   -4 days in county jail as a result of a "failure to appear" stemming from that same case (2006).   *Apparently, if this charge isn't already, I can have it exphunged.      .The car that I had was repo'd due to the fact that it wasn't insured on the night of the accident.   -that has account has been settled and taken care of, monetarily anyway.      I ran myself into $3,000 in credit card debt with business that I started in 2006 and incorporated in 2007. One of the reasons why I am burned out.      I know that this is a train wreck, but I need another shot. Question is who'll grant me that opporitunity? The choice in certificate will also effect what degree that I major in.Here are the vocational fields that I am considering:      .Aviation certificate- civilian or military(Pursue an Aviation, Science, or Psychology degree after)   .Psychiatric Technician certificate (Psychology)   .Fitness/Athletic Trainer certificate (Kinsieology, Psych, definately a teaching credential)   .Health Care certificate- Psych(as mentioned), EKG Tech, Dental Asst, etc.   I also like LAW, and I think that I would be good at it.      I've researched ALL of these to DEATH. I can repeat the cert guidline info backwards and forwards, I do have an interest in ALL of them with the execption of Health Care other than Psychology. But, which is the more promising field? Who will hire me?      I'm going to exphunge my record, but how far will that stretch on my record?      I'm going to clean up my credit, but I need a better job, and how far will that stretch on my credit report?      What should I do?

I'm in a market for a home and i've been spending a lot of time on the internet searching for home. My wife and i interviewed two agents to assist us and we chose one. The attitude of the agent was beautiful to begin with, but she changed completely after she helped us make an offer on a house which was rejected. I expected her to keep on pressing on the sellers agent to see if we can open a offer communication, but she has given me the excuse that she can't reach agent. I asked her for an MRIS alerts that fires every morning just like i get from the Other agent that i didn't chose, but she said she can only set an alert up on their website and not through MRIS.    My wife and i are ready to move quickly on purchasing a house, but this agent is just not helping our time line. She even sometimes claim that she doesn't get our emails.    Just curious here: Can we begin to work with another agent after we've made an offer on a house through the one we have now? How do we end this relationship amicably?       FYI, and yes, there was buyer /agent agreement in the offer package that i signed to make the offer on the first house.

I had three interviews with this company; they checked my references and said a decision would be made last week. Every candidate would be informed of the company's choice in writing or by phone if they where the one hired or not.  It is Monday and nothing yet.  Should I contact the manager that is hiring?  She indicated that the person she hired would be responsible for keeping her on task and keeping her organized.  Would my following up with her seem pushy or show her that I can do the task she requires to ensure she completes her task effectively?

With the problem of the banks, am suspicious to have a bank look at for their evaluation.  Also, i had bank one, all of my accounts were class B with all of the fees, i subsequently found out and now are class A.      We don't have 1k to pay a financial adviser.  (this was the cost my mother in law paid in 2004)    I tried morningstar.com, but ended up with little or nothing, since they want you to sign up and I don't want this.     Any suggestions on other websites other than morningstar?    There is so much "crap" out there and with the financial crisis, don't know what to believe.    I know you should hold off, since a lot of this will start to come back in a few years, but in our case, my husband is 63, so we don't have 5 to 10 years to wait.

20090223145216AAANpSu	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Other - Careers & Employment	Is a bad economy a good time to freelance?	I have experience in graphic design and I am currently taking classes to become more experienced in web design. I also have a B.A. degree in English from about 10 years ago. I did some writing now and then at my jobs, but nothing that impressive. I was thinking of becoming a full-time freelancer in the design and writing field. I'd like to offer writing services in addition to design because it seems as though the freelance market is overloaded with graphic and web designers. I was just looking for some honest advice from experienced freelancers. Becoming self-employed always scared me because I would give up job security, but it seems like every well-paid designer that I meet is a freelancer and claims that they would never again work for anyone else. I would never leave my job without any strong leads. But, how can I build up my portfolio and eventually venture out on my own?

20090223144810AAHTv3y	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Renting a House, dog-I know I just asked but left a lot out?	Ok I know I just asked this question, but there's a few important things that I've left out. For people who are seeing this the first time, I'm asking what I should about the fact that my partner and I would like to get a dog. We're in a 1 year lease currently for a house. Firstly, our lease does not say anything about us not being allowed pets. The only mention it has of pets is that it says we have one cat living at this address (the one we had when we first moved in). When I asked about having a cat in this property when we first moved in, the real estate agent said she could ask if I wanted her to, but that she was sure it was fine. We said we wanted to be sure that it was ok, so she asked for us, and it was and now yeah the cat is mentioned on the lease. When I was younger living with my family, we rented a house for years with a dog then who was not on the rental agreement either, but again, it said nothing about not allowing pets. We were told we could pretty much do what we liked with this house, paying for any damage caused of course, but, we can do whatever we like in terms of redecorating, landscaping etc, her exact words were we could treat it like our own. What I'm wondering is whether I should make a fuss about trying to ask the landlord if we can have a dog on the property, just because the real estate agent previously acted like she'd prefer we just didn't ask, so they didn't have to do anything :s I guess what I'm asking is should I insist on it anyway, even though my lease doesn't say anything about prohibiting pets? I don't know what a pet bond is, I've never heard of that in Australia but for the cat they didn't ask about anything about it, and we're not paying any extra, only the usual bond.

20090223143233AA1ufI4	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Should I fib on my rental application? I really need this apartment?	Ok, here's the story. I rented for the first time from the same apartment place as my sister. I had medical issues while living there and my rent was late towards he end, and I left owing some money. I am working out a payment plan with the current complex, however I know if a prospective landlord calls my former landlord, they will give me a bad reference because I left owing money (even though I am paying it) my question is...should I leave off my previous rental history on new applications? It is not on my credit report, however the apartment I lived at is the address the credit report shows I am currently at. Should I claim I was living with my sister (who rented from the same complex) and give her number as a reference number to call? HELP!

20090223155114AAebQCc	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	How do i tell my landlord to stop entering our back yard when we're not home? My landlord is my father in law.?	My landlord is my father-in-law AND he also lives across the street from us. One time we arrived from work and notice our back door was unlocked! Another day we looked at our backyard and he planted some trees (which by the way i wouldn't mind ONLY if he would have asked us first). Another day he left the garage door open and our dog went in and tore-up my husbands styrafoam cooler. I've argued with my husband over and over about this situation - He (my husband) is not doing much about this problem. There also have been times when I'm in my nightgown washing dishes in the morning (of course not expecting visitors) and when I look out the window THERE HE IS working in the yard. It makes me so upset that he's not giving us our privacy. OH and another thing He has a Green-Thumb he LOVES gardening so he takes it upon himself to plant trees and flowers.......We also have a 7 month old boxer. The boxer tore some plants and now he's telling my husband that we are better off giving up the Boxer. When we moved-in there wasn't no lease or contract made-up due to the fact that we are family. But now that we are having problems should we make a contract? And if we don't how can I tell my Landlord/father in law to stop showing up unannounced when we're at work?
