20090222214552AADVENp	Environment;Green Living	Is this considered going green?	I’m not really sure if it is or not, I am confused      I bought a large custom built monitor so I could watch stripper videos on youtube. Instead of always going to Strip clubs and giving strippers my bills I throw dollars at the monitor and pick them up when I am done. I’m saving on money and gas.    Is this considered going green???

Spread by deer, you walk through a forest, it attatches to you, causes heart to swell up among other things.      (this is not really a great explanation, can't remember parts)      How would you cure it?      (This is part of my homework about population in science... looking for ideas)

20090203125222AA7qiUu	Environment;Global Warming	Is it just that "Global Warming" believers just don't understand science?	How many time have we heard that 57% of people believe man is causing so-called "Global Warming" so it must be true!    - or -    97% of all scientists say so-called "Global Warming" is real, what more proof do you need?    Is it that people who make these arguments just don't understand that real science isn't a contest that is voted on?    Do they have the realization that a consensus is proof of nothing, and not even a part of the scientific method?    Or is it because their political beliefs are so skewed that they confuse politics with real science?

Has anybody any idea what might be eating the fresh water mussels in my local Leeds to Liverpool canal.
