To me, healthy food and fast food restaurants are not compatible!  The best answer of those given so far seems to be Subway, although they don't stay open very late, depending on your area I suppose.  It might be better to go to a market and get the makings of your own meal (or, some frozen meals can be very filling and tasty, although a bit expensive--unless on sale).|`|7x9lvbhAaa	1.5 pc chicken nugget 99 cents<br>  2.jr bacon cheese buger 99 cents<br>  3.drink you could geta free water  or buy soda small i think is 1.49 small<br>  4.plus taxs|`|piZ4xDBqaa	99 cent menu items and water.|`|ysa5YgZcaa	Get a $5 footlong sub from  Subway assuming that you have spare change for tax =)|`|AA12393776	I have done better going to a gas station with a food court.

Research it and make reservations early!|`|yiVPNM4paa	Bennihana for Hibachi|`|fVRsIPOGaa	As for a hibachi restaurant you definitely need to make reservations, especially if you're going with a large group.  And you mentioned a hibachi place not being intimate enough, as for all the hibachi restaurants that I've been to they have had a private room for large parties.  So call ahead and ask them about that.

Relax and enjoy!|`|XuK91PwKaa	I work at a restaurant that is business casual as well. However, we do allow jeans since we're in SD and it's a little bit more casual.

Most of the things you've listed have some kind of grease or are at least greasy|`|YSbCVt3Uaa	Its probably from the oil in the steak cheese fries.

mIj958p1aa	i like the fact they have more vegetarian options than mcdonald and wendys. they also have the best fires out of the three places. they have onion rings when the other two places don't. they also have mozarella sticks which the other places don't. they also have veggie burgers which the other places don't. they have the best grilled cheese out of the three places. they have icees which are nice in the summer.|`|AA10546011	They make good hamburgers.|`|ZuQUU50Gaa	that it has good food sometimes|`|GHd84xipaa	i like their hamburgers and french fries,they are the best.|`|VXcp8hvHaa	it'll make a turd|`|3EQsrBxCaa	love that place.  totally my favorite fast food joint.|`|4917bb54185a6e0ce588c170c8db1bc9aa	The ZESTY sauce is so yummy.

The chicken sandwich is like a sub and just a little spicy. NOT round like everyone elses. You get fries or rings, same price.  They have cute crowns for kids, or whoever and their commercials are hilarious. They have ICEE's, shakes and regular drinks and... did I mention zesty sauce. It is by far the yummiest sauce from a fast food place that tastes good on just about any menu item there.|`|PjW3Yo2saa	my views on all the fast food death pits are about the same<br>  pretty much poison in a bag,<br>  enough grease to clog up drain<br>  why would anyone want that in their arteries<br>  but then again im confused about a lot of things people do<br>  no wonder howard hughes locked himself in a room|`|PuPQF8QIaa	I don't like their food too much particularly, but I like that their product labels have witty things on them.
