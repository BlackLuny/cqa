vv2uk9hHaa	Not at all. It would be racism if you were attacking her race. You're just speaking up against bad eating habits, so it's not racism it's criticism (whether constructive or not). It's not exactly discrimination either because that would involve not granting her the same rights as everyone based on her personnal beliefs. Since you are not depriving her of any rights, it is not discrimination. It's just, well, speaking your mind, making a criticism on her habits. You have the right to tell her it's stupid and she should make better choices, and she has the right to be foolish and put her health in jeopardy. If her health is bad because of that, do a compromise and get her to see a dietician who can help her achieve a more balanced diet while still being (ugh) vegetarian.|`|khXGGBiTaa	Not racist. Discriminatory, possibly. Bigoted, possibly. Prejudiced, possibly. Biased, possibly. But definitely not racist. Racist is used exclusively for discrimination on the grounds of "race" (even though it is totally illogical - as we all belong to the same race - the human race), just as sexist is used for discrimination on the grounds of gender, and ageist is used for discrimination on the grounds of age. Perhaps there is already a word existing for what you are displaying towards your friend - dietist or lifestylist or something like that, maybe?|`|angW1Lkfaa	Vegetarianism certainly has its rewards but there are risks involved if you're not careful. It all depends on the kind of diet you follow.

Good luck:):)|`|tHEBPDenaa	haha. no. that's not racist. sorry to hear that your friend is sick. I've been a vegetarian since I was 11 and have always been very healthy. Some people just aren't meant to be vegetarians I guess!|`|MmmcKU52aa	no it is not racist, what the heck?? think about it! are you discriminating against a race? no?? well then, you aren't being a racist. dumb question.|`|Fh0fOUzDaa	Racism is discriminating against someone based on race. Vegetarian is not a race.|`|6CjDTJskaa	Uhh not racist, prejudice. not all vegetarians have bad health though.|`|c66c4d286f557839ba87ab4539fdc65eaa	Well you already figured out that it's not racism, but it is prejudice. It is ignorant to look down on people for being vegetarians because you don't understand the reasoning. If you learned about it, understood the reasons people have for adopting the lifestyle, and then thought about it you would realize their are lots of religious/spiritual, ethical, and health reasons to do it. Finally and most importantly, you'd be wise to ask yourself why you should look down on other people for doing things that are none of your damned business.|`|eo0DKI0qaa	If her health is very bad than she needs to brauden her vitamin intake with more foods- but yes it is very racist|`|fykbXerkaa	Not at all RACIST... >.>|`|F3LBgfvwaa	learn to spell<br>  and mind your own business|`|484fd75888bbb282b3da584ad880893aaa	It's not racist, but it is ignorant. Why do you care so much about what your friend eats? Surely that's her own business. If her health is bad it's not because she's vegetarian. It could be she's just eating too much of the wrong kinds of foods (or not enough). For instance, she can't stay healthy eating pasta or pizza every day. If you're worried then buy her a vegetarian cook book. Try to help her rather than judge her. :-)|`|doz7RIoeaa	I find it curious  how you can call someone a "friend" for 3 years and hate her during all that time.<br>  <br>  Anyway, no, disliking people for being vegetarians is not the same as racism though some vegetarian fanatics would like to paint themselves as martyrs similar to victims of racism. Or that groups like PETA and it;s minions compared Holocaust victims to chickens. <br>  It is discrimination if you exclude her because of her diet, But you consider her a friend so you two may be confusing your concern for her health and dislike of what vegetarianism is doing to her as "discrimination".|`|XI2iylR4aa	Well, as others have mentioned, what you have described is not racism.  I hesitate to call it discrimination, too.  Do you dislike her BECAUSE she's a vegetarian, or because she's annoying?  If you just don't like the girl, then it's really not an issue.  There are always people that just don't get along.<br>  <br>  If you hate her simply because she's a vegetarian, then yeah, that's kind of discriminatory.  If that's the case...why do you care so much if she's a vegetarian?|`|1c76b6914c5a81657e108fb7a9d57143aa	Racism is hatred against a persons race, not vegetarianism. Let your friend be. She can do whatever she wants. Its her choice for her to be a vegetarian, not yours.|`|7fAHPUkkaa	yes! thats being meam to emos! so yes

I hope your friend isn't anorexic, that can make one sleepy.|`|F3LBgfvwaa	It could be from not eating lunch. It could also be any number of nutritional deficiencies, or another health issue.

Tell her to eat more for breakfast and lunch and maybe get a blood test done.|`|VdbhuUYBaa	Poor eating habits can lead to a lack of energy regardless of the diet designation. Skipping meals completely is not recommended.<br>  <br>  Your friend may be anemic, which is a lacking of iron which is usually accounted for by meat consumption, but meat is not the sole source. Green leafy vegetables are high in iron and are a more than capable substitute for meat.<br>  <br>  Again, diet designation alone would not be to blame, poor eating habits MAY be to blame.

So instead of skipping lunch, she needs to focus on getting more healthy carbohydrates and drinking plenty of water for energy. If she's getting little sleep, that could it as well. In fact when I used to eat meat, I was tired more often than I am now, it's one of those things our bodies have trouble digesting so it takes a lot of energy.|`|a5b833f1cecfc7eab7869f5ea4fe43f1aa	Why do people always immediately blame the vegetarianism?

FxWppY7Baa	There are profound differences in the way organic and conventional farms are managed and thus how the crops are grown. The basic difference is that on organic farms the farmers see the soil as a living organism and grow soil by adding compost, using cover crops and green manures (plants grown to be turned into the soil). On organic farms soils is one of the most important things. <br>  <br>  On a conventional farm soil is looked at as a substrate to hold plants upright and as a medium to deliver chemical fertilizers to the roots. While conventional farmers do not like to lose soil they do not take the pains of organic farmers to prevent erosion and they do not see soil as a living organism.<br>  <br>  there is a growing body of peer reviewed science that is strongly indicating that food grown under organic methods is far more nutritious than food grown conventionally See <a href="http://www.organicconsumers.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.organicconsumers.org</a> and <a href="http://www.soilassociation.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.soilassociation.org</a><br>  <br>  There are no GMO's or sewage sludge allowed on organic farms<br>  <br>  As far as organic meats and dairy there are big differences. organic livestock must have access to the outdoors daily, cannot be given hormones or antibiotics, are fed certified organic grains which cannot contain GMO or drugs. There is ample proof that organic/pastured meat a lot higher in collagen, has the perfect ratio of omega 3 fatty acids to omega 6 fatty acids than conventionally raised factory farmed meat and dairy. (factory farmed/conventional meat/eggs/dairy has a very unhealthy ratio). See <a href="http://www.westonaprice.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.westonaprice.org</a> for lots of information on organic and pastured meats and eggs<br>  <br>  In organic processed foods there no hydrogenated oils, no artificial coloring or flavorings, no high fructose corn syrup, no MSG. Not organic food has all of these in them<br>  <br>  The USDA regulates organic farming you read see the 1500+ page regulation at <a href="http://www.ams.usda.gov/nop" rel="nofollow">http://www.ams.usda.gov/nop</a><br>  <br>  So you can see this is not some sort of hippie driven, left wing plot, marketing ploy-there are profound differences between organic and conventional foods. though the ag chemical companies would have you think so because they have yet to figure out how to get a piece of the organic pie so because they cannot tap into the multi-billion dollar industry they vilify it and hope most people will believe their hype and whisper campaigns.|`|XPufdiyaaa	kinda the taste i guess<br>  I have tried both the organic is nice as it is all freshly grown and nothing artificial added to it but can be expensive and conventional food has all the added stuff but taste just as good|`|Z0UdL0LSaa	From the versuswiki article:<br>  In order for food to be classified as organic it must obtain special certification in many countries including the United States. The certifications require the food be produced with certain standards. Typically they are grown without or with less pesticide use and other fertilizers that are used on conventional products.|`|VN0Wb9WCaa	Personally, I find they taste better. Also, when a product is "organic" I know there's no artificial additives in it.

Pork'n'beans night. You take a can of pork and beans and add cut-up hot dogs. It actually tastes pretty good and kids love it. Serve it with macaroni and cheese, you can make it yourself or use a box mix (I used the shell kind) and serve it with some broccoli.<br>  <br>  2. Spaghetti bowls. Boil your spaghetti and drain it; add the sauce DIRECTLY to it from the jar; you don't even have to heat it up because it steam cooks and then there's no splatter, either. Mix it up very well; put some bread in the toaster; when it comes out, put some butter and garlic on it. Serve the spaghetti in bowls with the garlic bread stuck in the side for dipping; add a salad if you want.<br>  <br>  3. Chicken soup day. Take chicken stock, fresh chicken (boil it and set it aside; then rip into bite-sized pieces), sliced carrots and celery and spinach. Boil a few cups of rice in the broth; when it's almost done, add the other ingredients and simmer until the vegetables are tender. Very filling, and tastes great the next day.<br>  <br>  4.

Serve it with buttered corn on the cob for messy fun.<br>  <br>  5. Tuna sandwiches are easy; just take tuna, mayonaise, tomatoes, pickles, and any other veggies you like and mix them together (slice the tomatoes and pickles, obviously) and serve with lettuce and cheese on toasted bread.

In acute hyponatremia, sodium levels drop rapidly — resulting in potentially dangerous effects, such as rapid brain swelling, which can result in coma and death.<br>  <br>  Hyponatremia occurs when the sodium in your blood is diluted by excess water. Hyponatremia may result from medical conditions that impair excretion of water from your body, or by a significant increase in water consumption, such as by athletes competing in marathons and other high-endurance events.<br>  <br>  Treatment focuses on the underlying condition and may include intravenous fluids and medications.|`|227b14cb2ec949a2ecdd4ba7068ff421aa	If you drink a Gallon in under an hour is when it begins to get risky.

snBeIxpBaa	Blue cheeses are commonly made with the mold "Penicillium roqueforti" after being processed, this mold is DESIRED for the final product.<br>  <br>  The mold used allows the blue color and a sharp, peppery flavor and robust flavor..<br>  <br>  <br>    If you really want to get somewhat scientific as to "why" it is done.. here is why.<br>  It allows milk fat to be split, free fatty acids and ketones rise which creates the flavor.|`|UETAqR8Taa	no a sterilised rod is inserted into the cheese making holes allowing the mould to grow.|`|379b18fddd29f1b64385008f275bdd61aa	No. They use worms.|`|829070aea711a47d99d908ff132df3bbaa	No,<br>  It can be made 2 different ways.<br>  The culture( penicillium roqueforti) is mixed in the milk mixture and then the cheese is formed. Then they take metal prongs and pass it through the center of the cheese to allow air into it so the mold can form( no air no mold).<br>  The 2nd way is to make the cheese curd and then add the culture and then the prongs( so both are close).<br>  So, next time your in a real shop ask the cheese monger to please show you the prong holes in a new wheel of blue( they usually love showing people.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penicillium_roqueforti" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penicillium...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_cheese" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_cheese</a>|`|AA11464317	Blue cheese gets that way from a specific mold. Holes in swiss cheese are from gases probably carbon dioxide produced by the yeasty action.|`|EMDNVrcjaa	No, that is not true. Here is how blue cheese is made.|`|8lYZROjuaa	I do believe someone is yankin' your chain, darlin'. <br>  <br>  In modern blue cheese production, the mold comes from a highly controlled "starter" batch. For home made blue cheese, the mold is taken from the previous batch of cheese. This mold is introduced into the ripening cheese by poking long skewers through the mixture, which also allows air introduced to assist in the mold growth. However, to maintain a quality product with a consistent look and feel, some modern production methods mix the mold with the curds before they're pressed, so no skewering is involved. While cheese purists are divided somewhat on which technique produces a better cheese, I can find no evidence of a preference in the consumer market.|`|7aZUa6fMaa	no...
v4vQSzu4aa	In my opinion, low sugar Marinades are your secret weapon here.  This way you won't have to saute them in butter or oils, but the flavor will be drenched in your chicken overnight!  Grilling or baking would be your best cooking styles for low fat, combined with lots of vegetables, fresh herbs, low sodium stocks or broths, and simple seasonings. Some of your more complex seasonings (i.e., McCormick's Chicken Seasoning, for example only) is full of salt and preservatives and "other ingredients", and that does not vote well for Low Fat/Caloric intake, although I love this seasoning, I use it sparingly.  Now, they are coming out with low sodium ones, thank God but I'm fan of either store bought marinades with a smaller list of chemical inducements or my own ones. I wish you the best of luck eating healthier and losing fat but gaining muscle by exercising and being more active!|`|d1TTwwUUaa	Stir frys with chic broth and white wine oregano,garlic, lemon pepper<br>  and lots of veggies|`|9LFjvDzzaa	Prepare your chicken and coat in a mixture of flour and garlic/rosemary, or other seasonings you like; dip in egg and then coat in flour again. Lay down a tiny bit of oil in the pan, enough to coat the bottom, and being to fry.<br>  <br>  Then, put some white rice on to boil in some chicken broth (you can use a bouillon cube). Cut up red peppers, mushrooms, and carrots, and add snowpeas; add to the chicken cooking and stir, making sure to flip the chicken over. Sprinkle some fresh or dried garlic over the mixture and cook until the chicken is done. Serve atop the rice and you're done.<br>  <br>  <br>  Also, try grilled chicken sandwiches. Grill your chicken and add it to toasted bread with lettuce, tomatoes, and light mayonaise. It's delicious and so easy to make.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

That also includes giving up stuff like gelatin and marshmallows since they contain animal bone marrow.  Don't eat anything that has been cooked with animal grease or liquid.  One more thing:  It will take discipline.<br>  <br>  VIVA LA RAZA!|`|eo0DKI0qaa	You give up meat, poultry, fish, slaughter by-products like beef bases and chicken broths and stuff. It is possible and make sure to not take vitamins as they contain gelatin. good luck- and get protein from nuts, eggs, milk, and soy products|`|HsYlRcDYaa	A vegetarian is a person who doesnt eat meat.|`|hg8ExtsNaa	you are better off health wise becoming a meatatarian.|`|7fAHPUkkaa	only if your a emo|`|fykbXerkaa	It depends on how much you want it, we cannot say if you can or cannot become one.<br>  <br>  If you want it bad enough, and have the right mind-set, then sure.<br>  But also, make sure you know what you're getting into. Don't just become vegetarian thinking you'll just cut out the meat from your diet. Do a bit of research and become informed, so whatever you choose, you'd still be keeping a healthy diet.<br>  <br>  [Protein Fact 1]: Protein coming from meat, fish or eggs is by no means superior to protein from plant sources. They are the same. In fact protein from plants could be considered healthier since plants contain no fats or toxic residues.<br>  <br>  [Protein Fact 2]: A vegetarian diet with balanced portions of proteins, minerals, fats and carbohydrates will protect you and provide enough protein for your body to work effectively.<br>  <br>  [Protein Fact 3]: You need to have a balanced diet. Too much protein is as bad as too little protein. Too much protein increases the risk for serious health conditions like heart disease, diabetes or stomach problems. On the other hand, a complete vegetarian and vegan diet are proved to be remarkably successful in the treatment of heart disease, cancer, high blood pressure and more.<br>  <br>  A couple alternatives to meat can be:<br>  - Beans<br>  - Black eyed peas<br>  - Veggie burger<br>  - Soy milk<br>  - Chickpeas<br>  - Bagel<br>  - Peanut butter<br>  - Spaghetti<br>  - Spinach<br>  - Soy yogurt<br>  - Sunflower seeds<br>  - Walnuts<br>  - Almonds<br>  - Cashews<br>  - Rice<br>  - Potatoes<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.peta2.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.peta2.com</a> [a site for more info to get you started]<br>  <br>  Good luck with your decision! ^^|`|pbxtnqSNaa	Well what makes you want to be a vegetarian?

wa3AvezGaa	Most red wines should be served between about 13-18 C (55-66 F).  It is often recommended to serve red wines at room temperature, but this advice stems from early days in Europe where room temperature was usually much cooler than we keep our homes now.  As a general rule, lighter reds like Pinot Noir and Gamay should be served on the cooler side of the spectrum since it accentuates their lively acidity while more tannic, full-bodied reds like Cabernet should be served toward the warmer end since their tannins can seem harsh if served too cool.|`|JvzgVc0Iaa	Somewhere between 55 F and room temp.|`|8VlDuMFOaa	Ahhh...Pinot Nior ~the wine known as "sex in a glass"!!! <br>  While i am far from an expert in wine, when I do drink it I like it to be SLIGHTLY chilled.

aNlT1NRqaa	Fresh ground makes a huge difference in taste, but only if the beans aren't stale. If you roast your own beans, buy them fresh roasted, or buy whole beans in a vacuum sealed bag (in that order) it will taste much better than if you buy the beans out of one of those store dispensers or buy pre-ground.<br>  <br>  The vital oils in coffee oxidize at a certain rate. Once you grind it, there is so much more surface area & the oxidation accelerates. The oils are a major part of the flavor.<br>  <br>  As far as caffeine goes, how stale the coffee is has nothing to do with caffeine.<br>  <br>  Robusta beans have 2x the caffeine of Arabica beans.<br>  Darker roasting actually decreases caffeine content.<br>  <br>  Brewing also can vary caffeine as well as taste. Espresso has about 25% less caffeine than regular coffee. French press tastes different from vacuum brew, which tastes different from a Moka pot.<br>  <br>  $20 grinders are blade grinders, they're not very good for coffee (I use one for nuts & cinnamon). For coffee, you should get a burr grinder (Capresso makes a good one for $80), for espresso you need a really fine grinder (over $200).<br>  <br>  To put the grinder cost in perspective, coffee shops charge $2-5 per drink. If you roast, you can make the same cup for $0.40. If you buy fresh roasted, it's about $0.75. How many cups before you break even?|`|1aee9196e19b183947c5fd70d396dd1daa	they will more than likley taste the same|`|tmGRe2Jraa	There's no real difference in the amount of caffeine, but coffee experts will tell you there's a difference in flavor.  The oils in coffee beans break down over time with exposure to air and moisture, so freshly ground beans will have a better flavor than pre-ground packaged coffee.  How much better, though, depends on personal taste.  If you're really into coffee, a coffee grinder usually runs between $15 and $20 and can be well worth the money.  Many people, though, add plenty of cream and sugar to their coffee, and wouldn't be able to tell the difference between uber-fresh $2.50-a-cup gourmet import coffee and pre-ground Maxwell House.
rsTB7D1zaa	These drinks are fine because they are unopened and they are high proof liquor.<br>  <br>  Be aware that aging in a BOTTLE does nothing to improve the flavor.  If that bottle from 1962 says "7 year" on it, be sure that it will not taste any better than a brand new 2009 bottle that says "7 year" on it [from the same distillery].  The reason is that the aging of whiskey is done in BARRELS.  In fact, before whiskey is casked it is very clear and actually tastes like a more refined low proof moonshine.  The barrels are what contributes the color and most of the flavor to whiskey.  Once in a bottle the flavor cannot improve (wine would improve in the bottle, but usually only the "big" reds -- Cabernet, where the tannins can mellow out a bit).|`|P8dIznazaa	Lysol is right that liquor doesn't age in the bottle.  But, it's also true that some old bottles of liquor sell for lots of money as collector's items or whatever.  Basically, liquor doesn't go bad; it might taste funny if it's been stored improperly or has been open for too long, but it's safe to drink.<br>  <br>  Tell ya what...if in doubt, give it to me!

You just have to figure out how to make them from raw ingredients. <br>  <br>  You probably could make your own soy milk out of soy beans, but I've never heard of anyone doing that with much success. Try almonds or cashews instead (a note: some raw foodists don't consider certain nuts raw due to their shelling processes or because they are pasteurised. Make your own decisions on that one). <br>  <br>  I don't know any good recipes for raw rice cakes, but I bet with some experience, you could figure one out. The site I listed below has lots of great raw bread recipes. You'll need a dehydrator for most of them. <br>  <br>  Raw honey is pretty much accepted by the raw community, but raw VEGANS don't eat it. Use agave nectar in your tea instead. You might have to hunt a bit to find truly raw agave nectar. <br>  <br>  Miso is considered a living food and you can absolutely make miso soup. The consensus is still out on what temperature is the highest you can go and still be considered raw. I'd stay under 100 degrees F to be safe.|`|a9e8bc83e62624fca53023ca2634933aaa	According to the official definition coined by the vegan society, honey would not be vegan anyway. Raw means uncooked, unprocessed, etc. So that means no soy milk or rice cakes either. But yes you can have avocados. So that means beans, nuts, seeds, fruits, vegetables, grains, etc.<br>  <br>  Edit: oh, and no bread, the ingredients still have to be cooked/processed|`|AA11296044	Sushi and Miso soup entirely not raw.   You may be able to used turbindo sugar.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  For breakfast you can have fruit and soaked grains.<br>  <br>  for lunch you can have salads and nuts|`|0a5aafc0987afabdc7c6a841b3727df1aa	I'll try to answer each question for you.<br>  <br>  1. Soy milk and rice cakes are not raw and strict 100% raw foodists do not eat them, but avocados are fine.<br>  <br>  2. Most honey from the store is not raw, and strict vegans don't eat it because it's an animal product.<br>  <br>  3. Grains such as wheat, oat and buckwheat are only eaten in their whole grain form. (Oatmeal has been steamed, so it's not raw) The grains are soaked to make them softer, but never cooked.<br>  <br>  4. Raw vegans flavor their tea with agave nectar.<br>  <br>  5. Traditional sushi (veggie or not) is not considered a raw dish because the rice is cooked.<br>  <br>  6. Miso soup is ok because it is fermented rather than cooked.<br>  <br>  7. Sorry, but I don't know what summona salad is, so I can't answer that one.<br>  <br>  Personally, I eat fruit and raw nuts or raw granola with almond milk for breakfast, a big salad with fish or chicken and avocado dressing for lunch. I also have a large salad with some kind of protein for dinner. Raw fruit and nuts for snacks.<br>  <br>  My body does not do well at 100% raw. I have tried and it's just doesn't work for me, so I include some animal protein. Eating more raw food is always a good idea, but you don't have to eat 100% raw to get the benefits of eating a raw food diet.|`|Nk9jElJjaa	soy milk and rice cakes are not raw. avacodos absolutely are ! i live off them, (i am raw vegan too). honey CAN be raw but its not vegan anyway. and buying whole unprocessed grains (NOT FLOUR) and sprouting/soaking them such as quinoa is a favorite. any fruits vegetables raw nuts(recommend soaking these also) are staples

a5b833f1cecfc7eab7869f5ea4fe43f1aa	Pay no attention to kawaii_marshmallow. You needn't worry about "bacteria and whatnot" if you simply wash your food, which you should be doing anyway. Going raw preserves many of the nutrients that cooking destroys. <br>  <br>  Some books that I've found helpful are "The Raw Food Detox Diet" by Natalia Rose, which has some great transition advice, "Green for Life" by Victoria Boutenko which talks about the importance of leafy greens, and "Raw Food Made Easy" by Jennifer Cornbleet which has great, simple recipes that are perfect for a beginner. <br>  <br>  I get most of my raw recipes from goneraw.com. Giveittomeraw.com is a nice raw networking site if you need some support. <br>  <br>  If you don't have a blender, I highly recommend getting one. A juicer, spiralizer, and food processor will come in handy too. You'll see lots of recipes that call for a dehydrator but in my personal experience, they are fun to have but totally unnecessary. Definitely get a blender though!|`|fykbXerkaa	Hai there~<br>  I am also vegan, although I have never been one to go for raw foods due to all the types of bacteria and whatnot.

DT2mU1jOaa	I think there are a few reasons why draft and bottled beer taste different and some of the reasons may recolor your view of draft beer. Some breweries actually have different variations of their beers for draft and bottle. I do not have real good information on how prevalent this is, but the examples I am aware of have two commonalities: the draft beer has a lower bitterness and lower carbonation compared to the bottled beer. Sierra Nevada Pale Ale draft beer is different from its bottled cousin in that the draft form is a little darker and has a lower original gravity compared to the bottled version. Both beers are excellent. I assume that their draft Pale Ale is intended to be more of a session beer and the difference in the recipe makes it more quaffable. So this could explain your observation.<br>  <br>  Other factors that make draft beer taste different from the bottled can make a brewer an unhappy camper. Some bars put their beers on “beer gas,” also called mixed gas, to “smooth” out beer flavor. An unintended outcome of this practice is that these beers lose their carbonation and deviate from the brewery specification. This really irks me because if a brewer decides they want to serve their draft hefeweizen at three volumes of carbon dioxide, the bar owner or distributor has no business doing something that changes the character of the beer.<br>  <br>  jpiepenbrok,<br>  <br>  You need to consult the industry experts as once AGAIN you are wrong & require correction. <br>  First, you need to read more carefully before making wild accusations.<br>  Next, many industry people do use many terms interchangable as in Beer Gas and Mixed Gas. In fact few people call CO2 beer gas at all. It is just CO2 or carbon gas.<br>  <br>  Finally if you dispute Ashton Lewis, then deal with him. I certainly have respect for his knowledge and none for you.<br>  <br>  Have a nice day, "Big Guy"|`|mSQ194CMaa	the aroma and taste of bottled beer in more concentrated from being in the bottle and being bottled for a certain amount of time whereas the draft beers aroma gases and taste have dispell faster from being served fresh in an open glass|`|JvzgVc0Iaa	I cant say that i have noticed.|`|mCM363I9aa	I prefer bottled.<br>  <br>  Ever tried Michelob ultra?, it's pretty good|`|ewUQuX4Kaa	Not sure that they necessarily are, unless you are drinking straight from the bottle; a smaller surface area would obviously concentrate the bitterness, whereas a glass is a larger surface area, allowing the beer to breathe and appear more well-rounded while drinking it.<br>  <br>  "Sierra Nevada Pale Ale draft beer is different from its bottled cousin in that the draft form is a little darker and has a lower original gravity compared to the bottled version. Both beers are excellent. I assume that their draft Pale Ale is intended to be more of a session beer and the difference in the recipe makes it more quaffable."<br>  CORRECTION<br>  Sierra Nevada, like ALL breweries, have 1 recipe for each beer - there is not a seperate recipe for draft or bottled product. The color is also exactly the same, and the OG is exactly the same as well. It is one beer, one recipe.<br>  <br>  "Some bars put their beers on “beer gas,” also called mixed gas, to “smooth” out beer flavor. An unintended outcome of this practice is that these beers lose their carbonation and deviate from the brewery specification."<br>  CORRECTION:<br>  Beer Gas and Mixed Gas are 2 different things. What we call Beer Gas is straight CO2. Mixed Gas is a blend of CO2 and Nitrogen. When bars use this set up it is done one of two ways...<br>  Either the mixed gas only feeds the nitrogenated beers (Guinness, etc) while the CO2 alone feeds the others; OR each keg has its own regulator, allowing the draft tech to set the proper amount of gas for dispense necessary to retain quality in the beer - this is typically done in situations with a long length of beer line between the keg and the faucet - the added Nitrogen helps preserve and push the beer throughout its run, and nearly disappears by the time it is poured.

However, preparing things specifically for one person and having to buy extra groceries for that could become expensive.  <br>  <br>  I commend you for wanting to commit to a lifestyle like this, but try waiting until you're old enough to support your diet (at least partially) on your own.

Case closed|`|dSmoB64Yaa	For 110 pound female, 2 drinks would make you legally too drunk to drive in the United States. A drink is defined as 37 ml of 80 proof alcohol or 355 ml of beer or 148 ml of wine. Rum is usually 80 proof, so 2 x 37= 74 milliliters of rum. That would make your blood alcohol level about .085%, if you weigh 110 and are a female. The legal limit is .08, so two drinks makes you just over the US legal driving limit. Only time can sober you up. You only lose about .01% per hour. This is why drinking alcohol quickly builds up in your blood and you stay drunk for many hours later. At your body weights, if you drank 3 drinks, your blood alcohol would reach about .12%. You would only lose .01% per hour, so 3 hours later, you would still be legally drunk , with a blood alcohol level of .09%. The best way to drink is to have no more than two or three drinks when you get to a party and then just chill out for several hours before going home. You can also have one quick drink and then sip each follow up drink very slowly, having no more than 3 drinks total over a few hours. If you are driving, you basically have to drink one or two and then stop and wait for  for two to three hours before trying to drive home. Don't fool yourself by thiniking that legally too drunk too drive is not very drunk. Three drinks at .12% blood alcohol, means getting pretty drunk for several hours|`|UkFSyozpaa	well first pour a glass of coke or a bottle whatev. fill it about 3/4 of the way then fill the rest with rum. (it would be better in a bottle so you could mix it) then when you drink it about halfway or so you should be feeling it therefore you wont mind the taste so much, then fill it about up to 3/4 with the rum and drink it about almost empty, then fill it up with some more coke about halfway then fill the rest with rum, you can stop whenever your feeling happy<br>  <br>  btw once your in the happy feeling and you realize you have more your gunna want to drink more cause it will just taste so good|`|qDFeUbM0aa	Yea, I know this isn't that detailed but only like a shot and a half in each coke. <br>  Hope I helped, sorry if I didn't! :)|`|qskWsDnYaa	Its not only how much you drink its how slowly you drink it. It really depends on each person how much you drink before you get drunk. What I would recommend is getting a tall glass and put one and a half shots of rum in it then fill it up with coke. Drink this slowly while you talk and when its empty if you feel you need a little more put a little less rum in this time and drink it slowly. This is a good way to find out how much alcohol you can have while staying only tipsy. Its very important to take it slow. This first time I got drunk I was about 15 and I nearly died (literally) because I wanted to get drunk quick so I drank two thirds of a giant bottle of vodka that was 70% alcohol. I understand that's not what your trying to do which is good. Just remember to drink it slow.

9545a4ddb6073ec8eff382149371b038aa	It is believed that 3,500 years ago, an Asian traveler set out on a long journey across a hot desert. He probably carried a canteen filled with milk to satisfy his thirst. At that time, canteens were made from the linings of sheep's stomachs, since they were waterproof.<br>  <br>  When the traveler stopped to rest for the evening, he probably found his canteen filled with a solid white mass. This was cheese.<br>  <br>  What had happened was that some of the sheep's digestive juices, or rennet, had probably dried up in the animal's stomach and had remained there long after the sheep was killed.<br>  <br>  The rennet was still in the stomach during its use as a canteen. The action of the rennet upon the milk is what produced the cheese.|`|AA12156890	History<br>  The guess is that cheese probably came about through people trying to carry milk in animal skins, which would curdle. From there, the thinking is that the curdled milk in skin bags led to two kinds of dairy products: one for items such as Yoghurt and Kefir, the other being Cheese.<br>  <br>  Cheese appears in the Old Testament. In the Middle East, Cheese was being made as early as 6000 BC from cow's and goat's milk. Egyptians made it.<br>  <br>  Ancient Greeks made Cheese from sheep and goat's milk. The Greeks knew about Rennet, which improved their cheesemaking and gave them greater control over the process, so that it could start to become a commercial activity. They sold Cheese to the Romans.<br>  <br>  The Romans learned cheesemaking from others such as the Greeks, and developed it to an art. They brought their cheesemaking know-how to Britain in 55 AD. The Romans didn't like milk: however, they did like Cheese, and it is interesting to note that some of their more popular Cheeses came from the Roman provinces which are now parts of Switzerland and France.<br>  <br>  During the Dark Ages, Cheese production from cow's milk was disrupted, as the lowlands where cow herds had once been kept during the "Pax Romana" became subject to disorder and invasion. Remote mountainous areas were a bit more overlooked by all the chaos, allowing people there to develop Cheeses from goat and sheep milk. But no real new Cheese varieties appeared during the Dark Ages.<br>  <br>  As things settled in the lowlands at the end of the Middle Ages, cow's milk became available again, and people there had the stability not only to breed cows but also to plan for the future in making Cheese. Cheesemaking needs a stable environment for the animals to produce milk, and for the Cheese to be manufactured.<br>  <br>  Full-cream Cheeses were reserved for the rich (in contrast to now, when lower-fat Cheeses are flogged to us at a premium.) Skim milk turned out harder, cheaper Cheeses that would store and ship well. Using skim milk allowed the cream to be skimmed off to make butter, then Cheese could be made from the skim milk.<br>  <br>  James VI forbid the export of Cheese from Scotland in 1573. In 1661, Charles II put a tax on Cheese being exported from Scotland.|`|bf5cDEyZaa	Cheese is an ancient food whose origins predate recorded history. There is no conclusive evidence indicating where cheesemaking originated, either in Europe, Central Asia or the Middle East, but the practice had spread within Europe prior to Roman times and, according to Pliny the Elder, had become a sophisticated enterprise by the time the Roman Empire came into being.<br>  <br>  Proposed dates for the origin of cheesemaking range from around 8000 BCE (when sheep were first domesticated) to around 3000 BCE. The first cheese may have been made by people in the Middle East or by nomadic Turkic tribes in Central Asia. Since animal skins and inflated internal organs have, since ancient times, provided storage vessels for a range of foodstuffs, it is probable that the process of cheese making was discovered accidentally by storing milk in a container made from the stomach of an animal, resulting in the milk being turned to curd and whey by the rennet from the stomach. There is a widely told legend about the discovery of cheese by an Arab trader who used this method of storing milk. The legend has many individual variations.<br>  <br>  Cheesemaking may also have begun independent of this by the pressing and salting of curdled milk in order to preserve it. Observation that the effect of making milk in an animal stomach gave more solid and better-textured curds, may have led to the deliberate addition of rennet.<br>  <br>  The earliest archeological evidence of cheesemaking has been found in Egyptian tomb murals, dating to about 2000 BCE. The earliest cheeses were likely to have been quite sour and salty, similar in texture to rustic cottage cheese or feta, a crumbly, flavorful Greek cheese.<br>  <br>  Cheese produced in Europe, where climates are cooler than the Middle East, required less salt for preservation. With less salt and acidity, the cheese became a suitable environment for beneficial microbes and molds, giving aged cheeses their pronounced and interesting flavors.|`|acf9a910a2252b62949b2661159fe6a1aa	I dunno what to tell for ur question, but I have an very interesting Fact.<br>  <br>  Guess what, in France people die for Cheese, its one of their life giving food item (to be considered), what they prefer is only for High quality of cheese, but the actual cheese which they consider as high quality really stinks bad, very bad and infact it contains germs too!

If the cake is done, it will come out clean, without any batter sticking to it. <br>  <br>  Cool the cake for at least 20 minutes in the pan. Once the cake has cooled, put a plate or serving piece you will use upside down on top of the cake pan, so that the face of the plate covers the open portion of the cake pan completely. Invert the plate and pan at the same time and place on a flat surface. Using pot holders, slowly raise the pan so that the cake stands upright on the serving plate.

Your flour needs to be fresh and using a good quality of cake flour which has the least amount gluten. Gluten is the stretchy elastic part of the flour which holds the gas pockets to make your bread rise. Eggs helps give structure to your cake along with  flour.  Oil and butter helps with the moistness of the cake.  Sugar milk adds flavor and color. It takes practice to make good-quality cakes and being exact in your measurements of recipes is the formula, it's a science so make your cakes like a chemist and decorate them like an artist.<br>  Oh yes, don't forget to sift your cake flour, at least three times this will help to make your cake light and not to over makes your cakes if recipe says three minutes do three minutes the more you mixs flour the more you can bring gluten.  And scrape the bowl well between mixes so there is no dried flour pockets.  Good luck and no peeking in the oven.

Just as long as you thaw it in the fridge.|`|Al4O6fdkaa	It's not ideal, and it would taste weird.  I've tried it myself before and I was fine.  It depends on whether or not it was ever taken out of the fridge and brought to room temperature.  If so, then throw it away.

These fruits release a gas that will aid in the ripening process. Whatever you do, do not put the avocado in the fridge! The refrigerator will only slow the fruit down (ripening will take much longer).|`|8abc5b9cab61ed51f5b3b0ffd3f6ca5aaa	Make sure not to cut it, and leave it out of the fridge.

484fd75888bbb282b3da584ad880893aaa	Glyde Vegan Condoms.|`|5zNwBQZHaa	Evidently - the milk protein called casein is used in the production of some latex condoms.  So that is why they are not always vegan.<br>  <br>  Up until the mid 1980s and the AIDS epidemic - "natural skin" condoms were very popular.  I will not say what they were made of but they were NOT vegan.  I think Trojan still makes one type of these but I don't see them in the stores anymore.  <br>  <br>  If someone is interested in reading more about cruelty free condoms - check out this article: <a href="http://sexuality.about.com/od/sexualhealthqanda/f/whatarevegcond.htm" rel="nofollow">http://sexuality.about.com/od/sexualheal...</a> <br>  Of the brands they mention as vegan, Condomi and Glyde - neither are available where I live - but they might be where you are.  You could always check their websites to see if you could order online.<br>  <br>  I just noticed your update that you are allergic to latex - vegan condoms may still be made with latex - just without the use of animal proteins.  If you concern is latex - check out this article on the four types of non-latex condoms available: <a href="http://sexuality.about.com/od/contraception/tp/non_latex_condoms.htm" rel="nofollow">http://sexuality.about.com/od/contracept...</a>  However - if vegan is still a concern, you should contact each company as there is nothing online about their veganness.|`|h1omg1IPaa	any polyurethan ones. <br>  durex avanti<br>  trojan supra<br>  <br>  in regards to the answerer who said glyde....yes, they are vegan, but they are still latex|`|eo0DKI0qaa	No, but please send me an email when you get an answer|`|Ss6uUVU1aa	what does latex have to do with being vegan?

Ho Chi Minh was a apprentice of his, but went back to help his people and country Vietnam.  Escoffier said he would have been a fine chef. Ernie Gerrish a German chef who learned to cook and Germany as a young apprentice during World War II.  I learned German style and French and learn how to cook what I call country French in a oven.  So many young cooks are about fame and glory today.  I write recipes to share.|`|AA10020034	My biggest inspiration for cooking is a good sale, like when there is a nice cut of meat or a certain vegetable for an insane price. Whenever I see a good deal on tomatos, I try to make a batch of pico de gallo. The reason I wait for a sale on tomatos, is because everything else to make it is always really inexpensive. These are for versatile ordinary ingredients, where I am always building my skills for using that ingredient...I may use it as an old standby or in a new way.<br>  <br>  I am more likely to try something new if it IS on sale, so if I don't like it, it wasn't a big waste of money to find out.<br>  <br>  It also helps to see a demo on TV or in the store showing you how to prep or cook something that I don't know anything about...demystify it.<br>  <br>  I am also a lot more likely to be creative in the kitchen if I have a well stocked pantry and high quality equipment. Getting a new item will inspire me to use it. For instance getting a blender might make me want to try a bunch of smoothies. Getting a wok or a bamboo steamer would make me want to try my hand at Asian. etc.|`|9LFjvDzzaa	Oooh. I get inspired from a lot of things. Cookbooks, especially vintage cookbooks, online recipe videos, television, but most of all, just walking through the grocery store. I'll see things as I walk, pick them up, hold them, imagine how I'd cook them, and what they would be good with.<br>  <br>  This means a lot of trial & error learning, but it's definitely worth it. ^^|`|EIZq02jAaa	top chef is by far my most inspirational show, followed by iron chef america. something about that fancy, professional food really makes me want to cook and try things like "balsamic reductions" and special food.<br>  <br>  also ina garten's cook books. everything looks/sounds delicious :)|`|s2aCNJOBaa	***Various Sources Of Cooking Inspiration***<br>  <br>  1.

My husband and I have found quite a few dishes we really love, and it's worth the extra  time to make them and I don't mind the time it takes at all.|`|wLgGD63raa	Being a culinary student what inspires me is passion. I am always aspiring to try new recipes and flavor combinations even if on paper they initially look like they wont work out. It is definitely a love affair for me, and I am always looking for new recipes to try and test out. It seems to be harder to find people to taste the recipes.|`|PgPW8nfKaa	food network and other cooking shows. going on the internet and going on <br>  allrecipes.com<br>  epicurious.com<br>  cookinglight.com<br>  CDKitchen.com<br>  cooks.com<br>  and many other websites  and just looking at the daily recipes and searching just random interesting ingredients. i also like to go through all cooking magazines and cookbooks. eating different things at restaurants inspires me to look up new recipes as well.|`|I7Ee17s0aa	Sometimes I'm inspired when I look at the same old ingrediants for the same old dish and decide that a variation is in order.  Sometimes I'm inspired by an accidental addition of an herb or flavored vinegar etc.  Sometimes I'm inspired by my own cravings for something sweet, savory and salty.....all at the same time!  Or, I'll see a recipe and think "  You could try adding this....or that....and it would be terrific!"  It's all good....|`|EMDNVrcjaa	I am way more willing to cook and experiment after watching the Food Network. So, if I need motivation, I watch those shows throughout the day. My most motivational is Secrets of a Restaurant Chef, 30 Minute Meals and Ask Aida.|`|HHDq9ajTaa	Usually it is the recipes that contain ingredients I have on hand without having to go shopping first. Those are the ones I will try first. The cooking channels are definitely an inspiration, as well as magazines.Good question.

Chicken soup is always a good thing to eat when you are under the weather.  You don't want to have anything that has dairy in it (ie: milk, ice cream, etc).  That will make mucous and that is not good if you already have a cough.  You could try a frozen fruit popsicle.

c544153bf8f85408fe4965bb69419305aa	Actually the bone gives the meat a lot of flavor.  That's why they put a ham bone in stews and soups.  The bone has the most flavor.  So the meat is the tastiest.  The next time you buy a chicken cook the neck bone and eat that meat, you will see what I am talking about.  In my family we fight over the neck bone especially with turkey.  Oh you will love it.|`|AA11006007	Meat is just absolutely delicious in general!!!! Hmm! Don't ask questions, just eat up :)|`|U5N0iPfLaa	The answer is in the marrow.  It is in the bone and has the highest concentration of flavor in any animal.  This is why you pay more for a bone in ribeye or leg of lamb.
MbSSIOpSaa	This may sound harsh, but you can "break free" from your old ways any time you want to! Just make the decision to do so and stick with it. Your addiction is mostly in your mind. Whenever you're feeling tempted remember that, and also remember your reasons for going vegan in the first place. <br>  <br>  Make sure you're eating enough. If you don't, then you'll be more likely to binge on unhealthy non vegan foods because you're so hungry, and that's all that is available. You may come home to a non vegan family, but you could also come home to a cupboard full of yummy vegan treats that even they will be drooling over. If sweet cereal is what you crave, then find a vegan kind (they exist, just read the ingredients) and have it with soy, almond, or rice milk instead. Eat some dark chocolate or So Delicious Ice Cream Bars! Check out your local health food stores for a ton of delicious vegan snacks. Even the regular grocery stores have stuff....Oreo's are vegan, Lorna Doone cookies are vegan, some dark chocolate is vegan.|`|vv2uk9hHaa	I think you feel awful because of the cookie crisps, not the milk.

There is nothing meat or dairy has in it that you can't get from a plant source. In fact, most Americans consume 2x more protein than they need which actually contributes to chronic disease.<br>  <br>  I am vegan so I know lots of meat and dairy free recipes. You can make the same stuff you used to and just use dairy replacements and vegetables or tofu/tempeh/seitan instead of meat. Check out Follow Your Heart soy cheeses, and use almond, rice, soy, or hemp milk instead of cow milk. It tastes different, but is much healthier and doesn't have pus, bacteria or hormones in it :) Use olive oil or Earth Balance Buttery Spread instead of butter. <br>  <br>  Try: Eggplant Parmesan, stiry fry with marinated and baked tofu, whole wheat pasta with homemade tomato sauce, roasted vegetables and brown rice, smoothies with soy milk and fruit, black bean burgers, oatmeal with sliced banana and agave nectar, pasta with pesto sauce.<br>  <br>  Dark chocolate is usually dairy free and makes a great dessert.

c544153bf8f85408fe4965bb69419305aa	The only advice I could give is go buy some real butter and make one more batch exactly lie you did before then combine that batch with the others and add you'll have to add a little extra flour and just a tad of extra baking soda and that should work.   I have done this same thing and it sucks to make a whole other batch but it may be the only thing that saves you.  Then test just a few cookies in the oven to make sure you have added enough flour, if you need to add a little more and a pinch more baking soda.  I wish you the best of luck|`|hKlsJgVSaa	Use the amount the recipe calls for. Whiiped butter is full of air and there fore your cookies weren't getting enough fat/moisture.|`|J2N8LeVkaa	Whipped butter is a bad idea for cookies because it contains vegetable oil to give it its spreadable consistency.  This extra oil makes the cookies soggy, where as pure butter makes them crisp and brown.

wa3AvezGaa	I think it's a good idea, however there are a few problems with your plan.  Firstly, most wines are crafted for short term enjoyment and are not made to age more than a few years.  So in order to have a wine that is going to be palatable in 20 years, you're going to have to find a high quality wine that has the stuffing to age and improve over the next two decades.  Chances are, you're not going to find that for $200/case.  I would recommend buying ONE (or maybe two) bottles of something really good that will age well.  Plan on spending over $100/bottle.<br>  <br>  Second, do some research and find out what the vintage conditions were like for 2007 for the region you plan to buy from.   Poor vintages usually yield wines with less aging potential.   Also, make sure you have good cellaring conditions... a dark area with steady, cool temperatures and relatively high humidity (not a dry place!).   You need to store the wine on its side to keep the cork moist, but you don't need to turn the bottles as suggested by previous posters.  Sediment will collect in bottles of high quality red wine as it ages, and this is a normal and expected occurrence as tannins and pigments drop out of the wine.  Turning the bottle will just stir it up.  You will need to decant the wine or pour very carefully when you serve it. <br>  <br>  If you don't heed these suggestions, you will likely have $1000 of vinegar in 20 years!!!|`|NXAk99qWaa	Lady Macbeth (didn't you help to murder someone?) - that's a great idea, but before you open your wallet, it might be worthwhile talking to a professional vintner about which wine(s) to buy. Some will improve with age - assuming they're stored in the correct conditions - whereas some will end up tasting like vinegar. There's also the storage to consider; if you're keeping the wine for any length of time, the bottles will need to be kept lengthways and rotated occasionally to prevent the build-up of sediment in the wine. Unfortunately you won't be able to hide them away in their case and forget about them for the next 20 years.<br>  <br>  Here's an alternative idea for you though - whiskey! I'll give a brief example of why I think it would be a great investment: A bottle of Midleton costs around ￡100, very expensive because it's an exceptional whiskey. Today, a bottle of 1984 Midleton (the year I was born) would set me back ￡1,750!<br>  <br>  So there you are, that's my twopence worth - hopefully it has given you some food (or should I say drink) for thought. Good luck!<br>  <br>  PB.|`|ULX0NLUHaa	I think thats a great idea!|`|P8dIznazaa	It's a very sweet idea, but if you're serious about doing it you'll have to be very serious.  Storing wine for long periods requires special handling.  You have to store it in a cool, dry place, turn the bottles every so often, and not infrequently you have to have a bottle recorked.  At least that's what I've heard; I'm more of a $5-a-bottle guy myself.<br>  <br>  What you might consider doing instead is buying her a bottle of liquor and storing that till her 21st.  Liquor doesn't age in the bottle, but it doesn't go bad either--you can stick it in the back of a closet and forget about it.  Hey, you could even take a picture of the two of you with the bottle, and show her the photo when you present her the bottle.|`|FKR45WLPaa	I think that is an awesome idea!  I kept the beer that I bought on my 21st birthday, not quite as classy, but I still look back on it fondly.  She will love it.  Very cool.|`|eBvVi7y1aa	sounds cool! but i think you should just give it to her in a bottle now!! =) JK!!   but what if she becomes an alholic when shes older then you cant give it to her cuz she will be all!! "!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"|`|kGxvT3AXaa	When i first saw the question i was like, omg give your baby wine on her first birthday, but now that i read the whole thing I think it's a cute idea. <br>  I'm sure she'd greatly appreciate it. <br>  But if she turns out to not like red wine when she's 21 / 50 years old, then the present will kind of be a bust. <br>  Why not buy her various kinds of wine, so if she doesn't like one then she has another to choose from.|`|595653ff266eac16972b9e54f7f2435baa	It is a cute idea but at this age it seems a bit premature. If you would really like to get a bottle and save it I think that would be fine and then put the rest of the money in an interest bearing account so she could decide if she even will want wine on her 21st birthday. I think 5 cases that you must store for the next 20 years is a bit corny.
1wNsBNmxaa	Jerky is meat that has been cut into strips trimmed of fat, marinated in a spicy, salty or sweet liquid and then dried with low heat (usually under 70°C/160°F) or occasionally salted and sun-dried. The result is a salty, stripped, semi-sweet snack that can be stored without refrigeration. Jerky is an early application of food preservation techniques.<br>  <br>  <br>  The word "jerky" comes from the Quechua term Charqui, which means "to burn (meat)".<br>  <br>  Drying has always been a common way to preserve meat. By drying in thin slices in the sun and wind next to a smoky fire, the meat is protected from insects that would otherwise lay eggs in the raw meat. Ancient peoples—for example, the Inca—prepared jerky from the animals they hunted or husbanded.<br>  <br>  D?mon~~?|`|ILpp3ncYaa	Dehydrated cow meat.|`|oryUuc8Uaa	its marinated thinly sliced strips of beef that is dried, it ends up being leathery and chewy and will last for a long time without refridgeration, that is why it was invented for cowboys to take on the trail and not worry about it spoiling|`|5k9XizbMaa	well there's this thing called a cow.

You don't have to travel all the way to the Crescent City to enjoy this tasty treat; it's easily made at home. Here's how:<br>  <br>  Ingredients<br>  <br>       1 cup water<br>       4 ounces unsalted butter<br>       1/4 teaspoon salt<br>       1 teaspoon sugar<br>       1 cup, plus 2 tablespoons sifted all-purpose flour<br>       4 large eggs<br>       1 teaspoon vanilla<br>       Vegetable shortening, for deep frying<br>       Confectioners' sugar<br>  <br>  1  In a small saucepan combine the water, butter, granulated sugar, and salt and bring the mixture to a rapid boil.<br>  2  Remove the pan from the heat and add the flour all at once, stirring vigorously. <br>  3 Cook the paste over low heat, beating briskly, until the ingredients are thoroughly combined and the dough cleanly leaves the sides of the pan and forms a ball.  <br>  4  Remove the pan from the heat. Add the eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition.<br>  5  By hand or with an electric mixer set at medium speed beat the paste until it is smooth and glossy.<br>  6  Stir in the vanilla. <br>  <br>  Or you can buy a pre-made mix.<br>  <br>  To Fry;<br>  1  Pour oil into a deep skillet, enough to be one or two inches deep. Heat it up to 370 degrees.<br>  <br>  1  Put two cups of the Beignet Mix into a bowl.<br>  2  Pour in 7 fluid ounces of water.<br>  3  Stir until well blended.<br>  4  Liberally spread flour on a flat surface. I suggest a cutting board, but any clean flat area will do take the Beignet mix from the bowl and scoop it onto the floured surface.<br>  5  Spread some flour on top of the dough ball. This helps make the next steps a lot easier.<br>  6  Now, roll the Beignet dough flat. A thickness of 1/8" is recommended by Cafe Du Monde.<br>  7  Cut the dough into 2.5" squares with a sharp knife.<br>  8  Put the dough squares into the skillet. They should pop to the surface within ten seconds. Make sure they're puffy and golden brown on each side. It won't take long!<br>  9  Put the Beignets onto a paper plate covered with paper towels to help drain the oil. They're hot!!                                   <br>  10  Scoop on tons of powdered confectioner's sugar. <br>    A must for any Mardi-Gras!!|`|5Dr5cvkwaa	These are SUPER easy: <br>  <br>  Brie en Croute #2<br>  Ingredients<br>  <br>      * 1 sheet frozen puff pastry (package comes with 2 sheets)<br>      * 1 tablespoon butter<br>      * 1/4 cup chopped pecans or walnuts<br>      * 1 small (8-ounce) wheel Brie<br>      * 1/2 cup raspberry jam<br>      * 2 eggs, beaten<br>  <br>  Directions<br>  <br>  Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.<br>  <br>  Defrost 1 sheet of puff pastry for approximately 15 to 20 minutes and unfold (place remaining sheet in freezer for later use). Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Saute nuts in butter until golden brown, approximately 5 minutes. Place nuts on top of Brie and spread jam on top of nuts. Gently roll pastry with a rolling pin to increase the size of the sheet 1 to 2 inches in each direction. Brush both sides of the sheet with beaten egg. Center the wheel of Brie on top of the pastry sheet. Bring all four corners of the sheet together above Brie and twist slightly to form a "bundle." Tie gathered pastry with kitchen/cooking string (tie string in the form of a bow), arranging pastry until you are satisfied with the "bundle" shape. Place "bundle" on an ungreased cookie sheet and bake for 20 to 25 minutes until pastry is golden brown. Serve with top-quality crackers.<br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  Crepes<br>  Ingredients<br>  <br>      * 3 eggs, large<br>      * 1 1/3 cups milk<br>      * 3/4 cup all-purpose flour<br>      * 6 tablespoons butter, melted, plus more for pan<br>      * 2 tablespoons cocoa powder<br>      * Pinch salt<br>  <br>  Directions<br>  <br>  Various toppings: whipped cream, chocolate sauce, jams, powdered sugar, etc.<br>  <br>  In a medium mixing bowl, whisk the eggs. Add remaining ingredients and whisk vigorously until combined, small lumps are ok. Set batter aside to rest for 20 minutes.<br>  <br>  Heat an 8-inch nonstick saute pan over medium heat. Lightly brush the pan with melted butter. Pour 1/4 cup batter into the hot pan, twirling the pan so the batter spreads out evenly into a very thin layer. Cook about 30 seconds until the crepe comes away from the sides of the pan. Gently flip the crepe over with your fingers or the help of a rubber spatula and continue cooking another few seconds. Transfer to a plate and repeat cooking crepes until all the batter is used.<br>  <br>  Now the crepes can be filled and topped to your liking. Try whipped cream, chocolate sauce, hazelnut spread, butter, jam, caramel sauce, powdered sugar, peanut butter, fresh fruit etc.

b73296a75da0c37af734e3ef9c03113baa	Bulghur and Cous-Cous are definitely both wheat. Bulghur is cracked wheat and Cous-Cous is a North African Pasta made of -- wheat. The question is are you avoiding wheat only or are you avoiding gluten? If it is a matter of avoiding wheat only -- you can enjoy rice, quinoa, corn, spelt, millet, barley, amaranth, <br>  There are pastas made of rice and corn and quinoa. Quinoa has the added benefit of being a grain that contains all 7 Amino Acids so among the grains quinoa is the only one that is a complete protein.  <br>  You can also find bakery products that are made without wheat. I suggest that you check out the magazine Living Without which has terrific information for those who have food allergies, sensitivities and intolerances. There is also a web site connected to the magazine and several companies that produce foods for that population. Check our Ener-G foods and OrgraN foods. Good Luck.|`|8abc5b9cab61ed51f5b3b0ffd3f6ca5aaa	Yes they are both wheat.  Couscous is made from wheat (it's a pasta), and bulgur is called "bulgur wheat" for a reason.  Spelt is also a wheat.<br>  <br>  If you want something similar in size to couscous, try cooking millet or quinoa.  The millet has a milder flavor but will cook up very couscous-like.  The quinoa has a more specific, nutty flavor, but is very high in protein.<br>  <br>  Rice is also good.  If you want to eat oats buy "gluten free" ones because oats are prepared on the same machinery as wheat and are thus contaminated.  Corn is fine, and potatoes.|`|a7qOFIj3aa	Couscous is actually very tiny pasta.  Try the gluten-free grain quinoa (pronounced 'keen-wah') as a substitute.  It makes great pilaf and tabbouleh.  It's also easy to make.  Just put it in your rice cooker with water.  You can find it at health food stores and at Trader Joe's.  Since it's a whole grain, it's better for you than couscous anyway.|`|uAkpp9Ipaa	As people have said, couscous is made from wheat, and bulgur is also wheat, but there are a lot of tasty, affordable, grains out there you can prepare that are NOT wheat.<br>  <br>  Quinoa, millet, teff, and buckwheat (not wheat despite the name).<br>  <br>  This website has more along with cooking instructions, and where to find them:<br>  <a href="http://www.healthaliciousness.com/recipes/" rel="nofollow">http://www.healthaliciousness.com/recipe...</a>|`|ObaHP6wnaa	If you can't eat wheat, you can't eat cous cous.  It is made from wheat and has gluten in it.  If you're looking for something sort of similar without wheat, I would recommend quinoa - very tasty!  :)|`|Al4O6fdkaa	couscous is actually small bits of semolina pasta.
v4vQSzu4aa	This is so simple and delicious, you don't even need a recipe for it. A big bowl of fresh fruit drizzled with a Balsamic and Sugar reduction, I know it sounds weird but it's SO fantastic. I like to use strawberries, pineapple, orange segments, blackberries, honeydew, blueberries, green/red grapes, fresh pears, last to add bananas and apples. 1" dice on all, drizzle with cooled reduction, stir and serve promptly.  You could do a fondue chocolate dipping sauce on the side (for this, I would do Dark Chocolate) and this way, you can control the amount of sweets depending on how "healthy you want it".

Place the flour in a <br>  mixing bowl. Cut the butter into small pieces and rub <br>  into the flour with your fingertips until the biscuit <br>  mixture resembles fine bread crumbs. <br>  <br>  2. - Stir in the superfine sugar and chocolate chips.<br>  <br>  3. - Mix in enough dough to form soft dough.<br>  <br>  4. - On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough to form a <br>  rectangle 4x6 inches, about 1 inch thick. Cut the dough <br>  into 9 squares.<br>  <br>  5. - Place the biscuits on the prepared cookie sheet, spacing <br>  them well apart.<br>  <br>  6. - Brush with a little milk and bake in a preheated oven at <br>  425* F. for 10-13 minutes, until the biscuits are risen <br>  and golden. Let cool slightly and serve warm.<br>  <br>  Cook’s Tip:<br>  To be at their best, all biscuits should be <br>  freshly baked and served warm. Split the <br>  warm biscuits and spread them with a little <br>  chocolate/hazelnut spread (aka Nutella) and/or <br>  a spoon of whipped cream.<br>  <br>  Variation: Use dark, milk or white<br>  chocolate chips or a mixture of all three. Use a <br>  2-inch cookie cutter to cut out round biscuits, if <br>  preferred.<br>  <br>  (Editor’s Note: I made these biscuits as part of a Valentine’s Day Dinner, and used a heart-shaped cookie cutter. They turned out quite well. Though the biscuits tasted best warm and freshly baked, the leftovers were stored in an airtight container and tasted very good with coffee the next day.

Cornstarch<br>  2 ? cups Milk <br>  3 ounces Dark Chocolate<br>  4 TBS Chocolate & Hazelnut spread (Nutella)<br>  <br>  To Decorate:<br>  Grated Chocolate or large chocolate curls<br>  Whipped Cream<br>  <br>  1. - Beat together eggs, egg yolks, superfine sugar, and <br>  cornstarch until thoroughly combined. Heat milk until <br>  almost boiling.<br>  <br>  2. - Gradually pour the milk into the eggs, beating as you <br>  do so. Melt the chocolate and hazelnut spread in a <br>  double boiler, then beat the melted chocolate mixture <br>  into the eggs.<br>  <br>  3. - Pour into 6 small ovenproof dishes and cover the dishes <br>  with foil. Place them in a roasting pan. Fill the pan <br>  with boiling water to come halfway up the sides of the <br>  dishes.<br>  <br>  4. - Bake in a preheated oven at 325* F for 35-40 minutes, <br>  until the custard is just set. Remove from the pan and <br>  cool, then chill until required. Serve decorate with <br>  grated chocolate or chocolate curls, with or without a <br>  dollop of whipped cream.<br>  <br>  Tips:<br>  <br>  The foil lid prevents a skin from forming on the <br>  surface of the custards.<br>  <br>  This dish is traditionally made in little pots <br>  called pots de crème, which are individual <br>  ovenproof dishes with a lid. Custard pots are <br>  fine. The dessert can also be made in one large <br>  dish; cook for 1 hour or until set.<br>  <br>  This is a quick and tasty desert.

Fresh fruit trifle:  If you have a Whole Foods near by, you can purchase a premade organic (and probably vegan) pound cake, if not, make one yourself.

Or use a combination of half lard, half shortening.  <br>  Use a fork or a pastry cutter to cut in the shortening or just do it the old fashioned <br>  way and use your hands.<br>  <br>  Next add warm water a little at a time until your dough is soft and not sticky.

Let them <br>  rest for at least 10 minutes, longer if you like.<br>  <br>  This is a good time to heat up the griddle. <br>  Now you can roll out the dough with your tortilla rolling pin or palote. It is a good <br>  idea to dust each ball with a little flour just before you roll them out. Lay the palote <br>  in the center of the dough ball and roll up, center and roll down. It is good to lift the <br>  dough and turn it.  Again, rolling pin in the center and roll. Roll them out fairly thin.<br>  <br>  Lay your tortilla on the hot comal. It takes just a few seconds to cook. Flip to the other <br>  side. When they are done it should have lots of nice brown speckles. Place them in a <br>  towel.

8bh0IGwJaa	Usually when you make a tiramisu cheesecake, you lay down the lady fingers in the bottom of the pan and pour abotu 1/2 cup of pure espresso over them, THEN the cheesecake batter.     You can also use INSTANT COFFEE, to 1/2 cup of hot water add 3 heaping spoonfuls of coffee and stir well until dissolved.  Pour that over your layer of ladyfingers.    Also, most cheesecakes need 1 hour of cook time at 300 or 325, not 35 mins.    What recipe are you using?!?!?!|`|ac021f49fcd1ea8f56dc6a9389a933e9aa	When you soak the lady fingers in the espresso they will stay very moist even during the cooking process.  Just make sure you cook it per the recipe and don't overcook.|`|AA10255759	This is part of an small article I found, I hope it helps.    .......  brushing 1 3-ounce package (or 24 in a package) soft ladyfingers with a mixture of 6 Tbs. strong coffee and 2 Tbs. rum. ........|`|BhFeii5Xaa	Most recipes calling for lady fingers also have the liquid for sprinkling on them for softening. This can be liquors, fruit juices, milk, lots of things.    I like to use a flavored brandy to sprinkle the cakes before placing into the pans. Something that matches the filling to be used.    Baking will dissapate the liquors til there is about as much left as using a couple teaspoons vanilla extract would leave as far as alcoholic beverages in foods is concerned.|`|36a3ynpJaa	You dip the lady fingers in espresso before putting them in the pan.  Check your recipe. It doesn't sound right.|`|HCgNSgKBaa	I don't know the recipe you are using but you could use some espresso or liquid such as a little milk. THe other trick you could do is when you serve it, put a teaspoon of milk on the plate where you are going to put it down, and the lady fingers will soak it up an seam extremely moist. Hope this helps|`|O0AfxH9Eaa	You soak them in coffee.|`|4fded85bb017fba5407e3727176079ffaa	Either soak them in coffee or Marsala wine.|`|IDBasYahaa	soak it in coffee!

829070aea711a47d99d908ff132df3bbaa	The timing for this is great because I just had a meeting with a pickle packer( today).<br>  ( I also tasted 17 year old pickles).<br>  <br>  Most will have a use by date( usually 1 to 2 years).<br>  ( a use by date IS NOT and expiration date).<br>  But do they really expire?<br>  It depends.<br>  Very sweet pickles like sweet "bread and butter pickles" will last for 20, 30 years( or more).If they're in spear form, the centers would melt out and the consistency would change and they become more like candy then pickles( like the 17 year old ones I had today). So they don't look like a spear anymore but a rind.<br>  ( actually they were very good).<br>  But with dill, kosher dills and pickles without a high sugar content, she told us that she would never put more then 2 years on them ( for quality control issues and not safety issues).<br>  They lose their crispness and get a little slippery after  a certain time.<br>  <br>  So, high sugar content= very long shelf life.<br>  The others=good for years but will have quality issues.|`|227b14cb2ec949a2ecdd4ba7068ff421aa	It takes a Loooooooooooong time but I'm sure they do at some point.

4fded85bb017fba5407e3727176079ffaa	Mine and my husband's fave is Italian Sausage Spaghetti.    Start with:    1 lb Italian sausage  1 onion, diced  1 green pepper, diced  1 lb of mushrooms, sliced  2 garlic cloves, diced  1 lb of spaghetti  1 small can of tomato paste  2 14.5 ounce cans of diced tomatoes (with/with herbs, do not drain)  1 small can of tomato sauce  Italian seasoning  Salt to taste  Pepper to taste    Brown the onions, and mushrooms in a tablespoon of olive oil.  When soft, add garlic.  Stir for one minute.    Add Italian sausage (crumbled) to the pan.    Sautee for five minutes or until there is no pink left on the meat.    Add herbs, salt, pepper to taste.  Stir.    Add all tomato sauces, etc.  Stir in and let simmer, stirring occasionally, for about half an hour letting the sauce thicken up.    Boil spaghetti.  When pasta is done, drain.      You can ladle spaghetti first onto plate and then sauce or you can mix sauce with spaghetti.    Add parmesan cheese and garlic bread, if you like.    Yummy and easy.|`|ISKM1z8iaa	CHOCOLATE!!|`|008512e32e60fcef19c7029ae0dc4d45aa	I LOVE STEAK.. has to be medium rare|`|50UbJp14aa	chinese sweet chicken and barbeque ribs yummmm|`|tE7lqUfoaa	i absalutley adore a roast  i dont think you need a recipe  oh and i love pasta with salmon source (sorry mums secret recipe ;) )|`|efQGWAoMaa	Calimari with lemon mayo to start followed by a really moist roast chicken with soft garlic and crispy skin and crushed potatoes and spinach covered in a white-wine and chicken sauce and then a really rick chocolate fondant to finish.

Favorite regular meal is Salmon, stir fried rice and stir fried vegetables.|`|v0P0vay0aa	KFC KFC KFC.|`|LcS5oJcdaa	Traditional Welsh Cawl.    Recipe; You will need a piece of lamb - usually shoulder or breast (whichever is cheapest). Cover the lamb with water and add a whole onion, roughly chopped, some peppercorns (about six) and a little salt.    Bring the water to the boil and then allow to simmer until the meat falls easily off the bone. This will take up to a couple of hours.     Remove the lamb from the water and strain the stock that is left. When the lamb is cooled a little, remove all the meat from the bone and discard the bone and any excess fat. Cut or break the meat into bite size pieces.    Allow the stock to cool and skim off the excess fat, if you wish (you can also do this by leaving the stock overnight and this will leave a hard fat covering on the top which can be removed in one piece.     The vegetables you will need are a small swede, two or three parsnips, three or four carrots, three or four large potatoes and about two or three large leeks.     Clean and prepare the vegetables and chop into decent size chunks (not too small - you are making a stew rather than a fine soup).     Now you will need to melt some butter in large pan (O.K. - so this is not a low cholesterol dish!) and start by softening the vegetables in the butter. If you start with the firm vegetables like swede and carrot and leave them to fry for a little while before adding the parsnip, potato.     Add the leeks when the rest of the vegetables are nice and buttery and starting to soften. Then add back in your strained lamb stock and the lamb chunks.    You may need to add a little extra water - just make sure the vegetables are covered at all times. Bring to the boil again and simmer for about one hour until the vegetables are cooked.     The only other seasoning you will need is a handful of chopped parsley and you might like to adjust the salt and pepper content at the end.     Serve the stew piping hot with some freshly ground pepper and a good chunk of crusty bread and maybe a piece of good cheddar cheese."     Its delicious, give it a try!|`|75ZxAANkaa	i absolutely love paninis. Once i have had this beef roast panini that had provolone cheese and this amazing horsey sauce on sour dough bread. it was amazing. oh and i also love rachel rays recipes. i made one of her rollover meals which was jerk chicken and roasted peppers and pineapple. the next day it turned into sesame noodles with jerk chicken, and the third day it was jerk chicken quesadillas. all of it was amazing i definaltly reccomend researching her recipes|`|HCgNSgKBaa	Definitely not my all time favorite (as I am a chef) But something I taught my hubby to make at home. Is french dip sandwiches. You take a can of campbells beef consomme and one cup of water, boil, add 1lb. of roast beef (gfrom the deli) and then once warm places on rolls and add swiss cheese (melt in broiler or oven for just a few minutes) and serve the consomme mixture as the au jus!!!
LAoiL253aa	well...its better to be safe than sorry...eating from burnt plastic could potentially be dangerous.  the more you use it, the more carcinogens get in your body.  its just a plastic cup...throw it away and buy a new one|`|ILpp3ncYaa	If you used the measuring cup for anything AFTER it got burnt, no.|`|54197e6f973e4ab9412e32d6976d19dcaa	That depends. if the plastic got on the dishes you are using at the time then no it is not safe to eat from them.
fEBOzWeXaa	if any of the numbers on the bottom are legible, you can call the 800 number on the can and ask for customer service and they may be able to tell you more info on that particular can of broth.  Companies customer service people are trained to deal with all sorts of those kinds of questions and as a food service chef, I have had to do that a number of times.  If you have had the can for more than 2 years, it may be too old but if you are thinking you have had it for a year or les, no probelm.  As the other fella said, the condition of the can can tell you lots of things toot.  No rust, the label is intact, no bulging, no dents, it is more than likely okay.|`|IDBasYahaa	if the can is still in good condition, it should be ok.|`|FIvA9OVxaa	ya look at the experation date on the can|`|HCgNSgKBaa	Yes it does expire, and the longer it sits there, the saltier it will get and will effect the taste of your food. For future reference get paste to make stock with. You can keep it in the refridgerator and use it for years. It makes tons, and with better flavor!|`|Om9CFRpsaa	Yes. It expires. It's better to be safe than to get yourself sick from eating an expired animal by-product. I buy chicken broth in boxed containers and it's expiration date is usually 8-10 months from purchase. (e.g.  I bought chicken broth last night for a recipe and I double-checked the expiration date which was Nov. 19, 2009.)
IDBasYahaa	30 mins if you realy want to marinade it.  You can also just baste the steak as it's cooking, this will give you the flavour your after, but won't penitrate the meat|`|008512e32e60fcef19c7029ae0dc4d45aa	what i would do is poke them with a fork and marinate it for 30 minutes poking it will help get the flavors in the steak and then i would grill it|`|ebQ4vuUnaa	I would say 45 mins at the least.. how long do you have for lunch?    Grab a sandwich and save the steak for dinner    Never heard of that marinade, but thought I would let you know Stubbs makes some awesome ones too.    Have a happy day!!    Cinn =)|`|YJrrZo9jaa	You can marinade it for 20 min. but for full flavor, its better to go longer to allow the marinade to really penetrate the steak.  Maybe do that next time and this time just do a seasoning rub on it before you cook it if you are pinched for time.|`|kT8rhVdLaa	use a fork to punch holes in the steak, so that the marinade flavors can seep into the steak faster. also let it marinate at room temperature for 30 minutes and i believe that would be the fastest way for you to have a great steak lunch. then grill, but when grilling place a drip tray underneath steak, use brush and baste those loss juices back on the steak.|`|VXW1XeFsaa	If the steak is a really good cut, I just sprinkle with sea salt , fresh ground pepper, and Worcestershire sauce on both sides.  Use tongs to turn the steak and never pierce it with a fork while cooking because it loses its juices and will be drier than it would otherwise have been.|`|HCgNSgKBaa	If you really want the flavors in the steak I would say at least an hour, (4 for the best result). The best thing to do for future is to purchase rubs or seasonings for steaks as they will help with more flavor. Marinades are oil based so you really won't get the flavor unless you give it time to seep in to the steak. So if you want so seasoning quickly, one I like is salt, pepper and garlic salt(seasoning) or actual garlic if you have it!
hO0CyOkAaa	My schools colors are also orange and black. So, for my friend's graduation last May we did orange and black carnations with a small ornament in the middle ( which in our case was a pistol pete mascot) but you could use your mascot or the name in the middle.<br>  Another idea for the edible centerpiece might be a tall vase full of orange black m&ms. Also you could get a 3 tiered cupcake stand and do alternating rows of orange and black cupcakes! :)<br>  Hope this helps! Good luck on graduating! :)|`|eAobNmUTaa	I am assuming orange and black are your school colours...but to me that screams Halloween :)  Rather than coloured carnations, why not buy cheap fish bowls, and fill the bottom with with black and orange stones, then topped with water. A few simple tea lights (white) floating in the bowls will be very pretty (and cost effective).  This will look less heavy than the flowers you've suggested.  You can also buy a some pretty orange flowers and drop a few petals in each bowl to float alongside the candles.  Good luck!|`|KgOvoFThaa	orange|`|d1TTwwUUaa	graduation wishing tree.  look up wedding wishing trees.com|`|tt7gQ93aaa	The others had good answers.. You could do balloons, that's pretty cheap and easy.  As for edible centerpieces? If you go to the M&M website you can buy just about any color M&Ms.. you could buy some orange and black ones and put them in dishes. Or just decorate some sort of container and put candy in it (i.e. a normal candy dish with orange and black ribbon around it filled with mini Hershey's bars).This is tough. :p Try to be creative.|`|VzW0ZXScaa	maybe an arrangement with orange marigolds and black licorice.|`|sdqmO15Aaa	well umm you could do orange and black, or just orange-just black, BE CREATIVE|`|f9sL3WgQaa	What you do is get small pumpkins..carve them out and use them like vases. Then put in your fall themed or your color carnations.<br>  <br>  if you need them black you can use food coloring in the ater to absorb the color.|`|EMDNVrcjaa	You could use oranges (the fruit) in a glass bowl and and then stick your black flowers (carnations or tulips, etc.) in it or find something else that is black to stick in the bowl like the licorice idea. Another idea would be orange and black cakes. One orange with black decorations and then every other one in black with orange decorations or a cupcake tree.

Preferably Canadian. Rich & Rare is my absolute favorite. $8 for a plastic bottle fifth in my town, but don't let the price fool you. It's better than any American whiskey (like Jack Daniels, which might as well be labeled bourbon), and doesn't taste as watery as Crown Royal (which is still good, but much more expensive. I don't think you can find a better deal than $8 for 17 shots of booze. =P<br>  <br>  But honestly, it all varies person to person.

I'm a vegetarian but almost none of my friends know because I don't think it's something worth announcing and I could care less what they choose to eat.

I'm a vegetarian, i don't eat any kinds of meat or fish, but I still drink milk, eat eggs etc. I am against peta because they sensationalize everything. they take the worst possible cases you can find, and shove it down everyone's throats saying this is always how it's done always(talking about meat processing vids etc). I think the idea behind peta is good, but the way they go about it most times just makes them look ridiculous, and doesn't connect with non vegetarians. I actually think they have the opposite affect. Again I think the idea of protecting animals is great, but vegetarianism is like a religion, not everyone is going to follow it, so it's rude to try to convert other people. What people eat is up to them, so I have no right to tell people what and what not to eat. About the fur thing, I agree with you. In this day and age there are such good fake furs, that there's just no need anymore. We've moved out of the fur era. However again, I can't say that I don't have leather shoes, and other leather goods, so I won't preach to people about wearing fur etc.|`|doz7RIoeaa	1) I don't hate vegetarians or vegans per se. I may dislike people who happen to be vegetarians or vegans though. <br>  <br>  2) PETA is a very despicable organization crying about abuse and exploitation of animals while abusing and exploiting innocent and ignorant people AND animals themselves. They prey on naive and impressionable children (like the one who posted KFC abuses chickens. Dear can you point out to me where exactly is KFC Farms located?) and exploit women to solicit cash. The only purpose is to pay for Ingrid's and that of her staff salaries and jet setting lifestyles.<br>  <br>  3) Animals are not torched for fur. Fire would burn down hair to charcoal, Anyway, unfortunately,fur is legal and as long as anything is legal, morally right or wrong, some people are going to buy or do it. Heck some drugs are illegal and that has not stopped people from using them. Most people in prisons are there for drug related crimes. People just do a lot of stupid things and it's pointless to understand everything,|`|wX1xcnZOaa	I'm a vegetarian, and very against PETA.

The reason being the antics they pull do more harm than good and sometimes are down right silly (sea kittens anyone?) or offensive (such as dressing up as Ku Kluxers outside of a dog show) and they use their member dues to buy stock in companies which abuse and kill animals.<br>  <br>  As for fur, well unfortunately sometimes the reason you can't tell faux fur and real fur apart is because it is the same thing. China is notorious for using dogs, cats, raccoons, etc... and labeling the products "faux" when in fact it isn't.|`|F49y3gImaa	I'm not a vegetarian or a vegan.<br>  I don't care what people eat, really. you need food to survive, but it's your choice on whatever you want to put in your mouth.<br>  <br>  I'm against Peta, though. Now I do agree with them not supporting using animal fur. We have other things to cloth ourselves with. If you like the look of it, you should just buy the fake fur.<br>  <br>  The reason I am against peta (for the most part) is for one simple reason: they over-exaggerate. Anyone can fight me on this, but I've done my research on both parts of this subject, and I stand firm on my answer.|`|ZqXUduJMaa	I am a meat eater, and I am fine with vegans & vegetarians - some of my best friends are vegetarian! Actually, I try to go out of my way to make sure there is always a vegetarian option at parties and holidays.<br>  <br>  Even though I eat meat, I try to purchase meat that was raised humanely. I don't eat things like fois gras or veal, just because of the cruelty involved. But Peta has always seemed a bit extreme to me.<br>  <br>  As for fur, I don't own any real fur, but I am not against fur & leather as long as the animal has been used for it's meat too. Furs like Mink seems a little cruel to me, but I would never throw paint on someone for wearing one.|`|jUuYMVqiaa	i respect vegans who do it for the right reasons. i know veggs who only do it because they want to be able to tell people they are so that people will think oh they are soo cool.<br>  i tried being a vegetarian for a while, but it was to hard for me, so i respect their will power.<br>  <br>  im not a veg but i do not promote any sort of animal testing, even no mars candy. i also avoid KFC and IAMS..i feel animal testing for stupid reasons could actaully end one day..unlike the end of all meat eating. i feel like more light should be shed on animal testing than on the meat industry.<br>  <br>  peta is a bit to extreme and biased for my taste.<br>  <br>  i do not want to sound like a hypocrite and say that fur is bad while leather is not..but leather is from a cow that was already going to be killed for its meat...however a mink is killed only for its fur..nothing else. i am all for fake furs..and im not against pleather or leather.|`|khXGGBiTaa	I'm a vegetarian, but PETA is irrelevant in my life. I'm neither for them nor against them. I simply have no contact with them and no need for them.<br>  <br>  There is method in their madness, but there is also madness in their method. They're useful in that they have helped a lot of people change their dietary patterns for the better, but they are guilty of sensationalist acts which don't exactly win them any friends. No, they don't brainwash. They raise awareness of, but often exaggerate the extent of, cruel practices against animals.<br>  <br>  I think you meant tortured, not torched. I don't and won't wear fur, leather, sheepskin, suede and similar. I view the wearing of fur as worse than the wearing of leather though, because, as someone else pointed out, the fur-animal is usually killed only for its skin, whereas the leather-animal is usually killed for its flesh as well as its skin, so there is a little less pointlessness to its death compared to a fur-animal's death.|`|m5Q8hJUHaa	I'm a vegetarian and am totally for PETA, I agree with you they're just raising awareness and want to make a compromise, I think people who eat meat deserve the right to eat meat but I think they should eat it everyone once in a while, and stop being a big fat pig when it comes to meat, honestly, when I used to eat meat such as pork, ham, chicken I preferred small pieces over a big drum or a large steak plus most of the meat-substitutes taste the same and are just as Delicious and more healthier. I think killing animals for fur/make up is even stupider then people being greedy over meat, at least killing animals for food is a legitimate reason for killing them.|`|sr0sczJaaa	I like Peta, although some of their campaigns are a little out there and "sexy". I feel like people should be pushed to not eat meat because animals are tortured for it, there is no humane way to kill an innocent animal who wants to live as much as we do. I can see why people ate meat back then because there wasn't that many choices and there was no global warning but today there are soooo many choices out there for meals and global warming does exist now, I hope someday people will look back and think wow people actually ate animals. I feel fur is awful to and should be illegal, once again there are other options that are cheaper and look just as good, the people these days, it makes me sick. People who dont like vegetarians and peta are just mad because there bothered for what they eat and do when they know its wrong. its called SELFISH!<br>  <br>  anybody that can say to themselves, you know what, I'm going to be consious with what I eat and wear, etc. so I can help animals is ahead of their time and in my opinion smart people.|`|Rd4OIDHUaa	I have to agree with Happy. Being a vegetarian is no means for anyone to dislike someone. It's a preachy vegetarian that bothers a  carnivore. <br>  <br>  Choosing not to eat meat is a personal choice that can be an interesting topic of conversation but can also lead to the vegetarian forcing their views on someone and the meat eater to do the same. <br>  <br>  Another thing about being a vegan or vegetarian is that the lifestyle that the vegan/vegetarian is a part of is usually more non-meat inclined. My family raised me to put the environment before my personal desires, so becoming a vegetarian was practically expected of me, but with my friend who was raised in a family that eats steak every night and goes hunting every saturday it's a completely different issue. It's about sacrifice and how much of one you are making. <br>  <br>  Assuming you are right about these things is quite a thing to do. It's good that you're aware and you've taken personal action, but others need to come to terms with these issues on their own. Otherwise they will only regard you as a preachy vegetarian who thinks they have everything figured out. That's not to say I do. I agree with you 100% and I am so relived there are people in this world who CARE. <br>  <br>  :D thank goodness for people like you!

However, when you tell me to "go Veg!" and that I'm evil because I eat an animal that was meant to be eaten, then we have a problem.<br>  <br>   Also, I look for a group that doesn't go around in the woods during hunting season banging pots and pans like a bunch of lunatics to scare off animals that would be hunted, or kidnapping deer and painting them with camo.

C72c6xr1aa	ok, a confit means to cook in its own fat.  The duck should be cooked in its own fat slowly and it produces a very tender, juicy, moist product, although somewhat greasy.

As for keeping a bit of butter in your life -- that makes sense to me. Margarine is one molecule removed from plastic. Even Earth Balance and Willow Run. So you can avoid drinking milk etc. but if it is health reasons that are prompting your choosing to avoid dairy --  then butter isn't such a bad thing after all. If it is a vegan impetus however, well,  then you are out of luck,|`|f2d9c213ef900a74f5759771f3fb61a7aa	Yes Butter has Casein in it ..it is minimal , but it has it .<br>  <br>  I Use Earth's Balance ..

tt7gQ93aaa	I don't really believe in the whole astrological sign thing.. so I have no advice in adherence to that. :p <br>  Food-You're her best friend, think of some of her favorite snacks. Snacks are definitely a must-have at parties. Chips, mixes, cookies, candies. Then later have some sort of real food.. if you have the money, getting some chicken from KFC is probably about the easiest thing you could do. Then maybe make some macaroni and cheese to go with it. Sloppy joes or hot dogs are also super easy. <br>  Games-Parties need games. Because all too often you have those weird awkward times no one knows what to do or say. So! Games often depend on the group of people. My group of friends may like totally different things than yours; so try to keep that in mind. Twister, Scene It, charades, and card games are some suggestions. Another general rule to keep in mind when choosing games is that people will want to jump in and out of them a lot. So pick games that are easy to do that without messing everything up (like Monopoly).<br>  Favors-Get decorations that can double as favors. Just be creative.. that can be really fun. You can make a game out of it too.|`|lzTOlaqiaa	Hello Kitty?

One suggestion I have though is to freeze the cakes for a day or two before you frost them. This way they will be more moist and much easier to frost. They take less than an hour to completely defrost, so it's a great idea to take them out of the freezer and frost them right before a party. Good luck!!

Here is one that I have found to be fairly easy to do (the website from my source is where this came from): <br>  <br>  "Cidermaking is easy and fun. Here is a basic recipe for a Farmhouse Style cider (ingredients for five gallons):<br>  <br>      5 gallons of fresh pressed sweet apple juice (known today as apple cider)<br>      5 cups of sugar<br>      1 package of Wyeast liquid lager brewers yeast (available at homebrew supply stores)<br>  <br>  Transfer the juice and sugar using a sanitized funnel or food grade plastic hose into a sanitized glass or stainless-steel container at room temperature. Allow the sugar to dissolve and then pitch the lager yeast and affix a fermentation lock atop the carboy It will soon begin to bubble away releasing carbon dioxide as the yeast converts the sugars into alcohol. Allow the cider to ferment and mellow for at least two months before transferring it with your sanitized food grade hose into bottles, a keg, or any vessel you prefer. Then enjoy. Any homebrew supply shop can get you started with the proper advice and equipment."<br>  <br>  Good luck and happy drinking!!

Whisk well and let the gravy thicken a bit between each addition.<br>  <br>  Then season to taste.

It could be the same gravy, as Sysco is a food distributor for restaurants, especially since this packet doesn't give instructions on making anything less than the whole package.  I just measured it and guess-tamated.  It was instant gravy.<br>  <br>  I don't know if they sell to individuals, but maybe you can find out where to buy it by contacting them through there web site at sysco.com <br>  <br>  The food bank also gave me some frozen, precooked sausage patties.  I warmed them up and threw them in the gravy and served with mashed potatoes.  It was the only meat I had, and I was afraid my boys wouldn't like it.  They loved it.

I recently tried and really liked this one: <a href="http://vegweb.com/index.php?topic=19468.0" rel="nofollow">http://vegweb.com/index.php?topic=19468....</a>|`|737v3qtmaa	Teriyaki Risotto:<br>  (i ended up making this one day by accident) <br>  <br>  I will not give measurements because that depends on how many people you are making this dish for. the only way i can explain this one is via a method which assumes you have made risotto before.<br>  <br>  STEPS:<br>  <br>  1) start with short grain brown rice (brown rice because this is going to go through a lot of moisture and temp. changes, so it needs that inner husk to stand up to the beating). <br>  <br>  2) start with either olive oil or sesamie oil (depending on which flavor you like more) and then add the rice. <br>  <br>  3) once everything is nice and hot, add some watered down cheap japanese sake.  The portion should be a bit more than a third of of all the liquid you'd need to cool the rice all the way.<br>  <br>  4) once that's in, keep going with either some vegetable stock, water, or if you're feeling adventurous you could even use brown tea (slightly sweetened). <br>  <br>  5) the money shot: the last part of the liquids should be a mix of 3 parts. 1 soy sauce, 1 mirin (look it up, it's everywhere), and 1 part homey or simple syrup depending on how you feel about our bee friends (personally, i know for a fact that many a bee that pollinates my herb garden here in this massive city would not be alive today without commercial bee keeper financing, so I see them as economic partners).<br>  <br>  6) the money shot: thicken (if need be) with gelatin.  No, there are plenty of vegan gelatins out there and you are gonna make one right now.  Just take a bit from that sake, or some apple/grape juice and add a spoon or two of corn starch in a separate bowl. Just enough to make a thick slurry, but make sure there are no lumps.  Then as the risotto is just about to finish, add the slurry, and presto, the heat will force the starches in the corn to bind together to form vegan gelatin, making this Teriyaki as thick as you get at the local Japanese joint.<br>  <br>  7) the best part is, while this is going on, you can throw anything you want in there. peppers, onions, tofu, mushrooms, daikon, spinach, ...anything that can hold up to a bit of stirring.  <br>  <br>  Hope that helps.  Good luck.

MONmVNBZaa	Smoked Pork Flautas  ngredients          * 3 cups smoked pork, shredded      * 1 cup salsa or picante sauce      * 1/4 cup water      * 2 TBSP butter      * 1 TBSP olive oil      * 16-20 corn tortillas      * pinch salt      * 3-4 grinds fresh black pepper      * Vegetable oil for frying      * toothpicks    In a medium skillet, heat the butter and olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the pork and heat through, breaking up any large chunks with your spoon. Add the salsa and water and simmer on medium-low heat until the the mixture reduces completely. You want it to be moist, but not soupy. Remove from heat to let cool.    Pour enough vegetable oil in a high-sided skillet for about 1.5 inches high. Heat to 350 degrees.    Heat the oven to 250 degrees. Lay 4-6 tortillas out on a baking sheet and brush them with oil. Put in the oven for 2-4 minutes or until tortillas are soft and pliable. Put a tablespoon and a half of the pork mixture on a tortilla, roll up tightly, and secure with a toothpick.    Place the flautas in the hot oil and fry for 1-2 minutes until they are golden brown and crisp. Repeat the softening and rolling process until all the flautas are done. Serve with sour cream and guacamole.|`|INPrlW6Maa	Green Chili Stew....DELICIOUS!    3 tablespoons olive oil   1 onion, chopped   2 pounds pork loin, cut into 1 inch cubes   1/2 cup all-purpose flour   3 (14.5 ounce) cans chicken broth   4 cups water   4 potatoes, peeled and cubed   8 green chile peppers, chopped   1 can green enchilada sauce  1 can rotel tomates  1  can black beans, undrained   1 can kidney beans, drained   3 cloves garlic, minced   salt and pepper to taste     In a large pot over medium high heat, combine the oil and onion and saute for 5 minutes, or until onions are tender.

Yummy|`|TqRvIyyjaa	if you like spicy food you can fry up the meat and add some salsa and you have a quick easy meal|`|BhFeii5Xaa	toss it on a Chef Salad instead of the other meats    toss it into any pasta salad that calls for chicken    toss it onto any omlette with chopped peppers, onions, celery, and tomato    scramble it into eggs along with peppers, onions, celery    Use it anywhere you would use any other diced meats or browned ground meats.    toss a couple cups of it into the Mac n Cheese along with some diced tomatos and peppers    Super loads of things you can do with this lovely prepared meat.
HCgNSgKBaa	No, after four hours it goes into a stage that grows bacteria that no matter what temperature you cook at you can not get rid of completely. I can't honestly say you will get sick from it, but I can honestly tell you it is no where near 100% safe. (I am a chef)|`|Vio3CGUqaa	don see whats wrong but it needs to be thorouly cooked...|`|4dntstR9aa	No, sorry.  I would toss it out.  It's better to be safe than sorry.  Start with something fresh that wont make you sick.  After 4 hours you can almost bet it has started growing bacteria and will make you sick.  It's just not worth it.|`|HHDq9ajTaa	Yes it is probably fine. If it smells slightly gassy when you open it just rinse it off and let it set a minute or two. That will be ok. If you bought it and froze it the same day there is no worries. If you kept the chicken for 4 or 5 days in the fridge then froze it, there could be slight concern for spoilage. If it smells good after you let it air for a couple of minutes, it will be fine. Cook thoroughly.|`|kT8rhVdLaa	ive seen my roommate leave chicken thawing out over six hours, and hes still alive and kickin.  Just cook to a temp over 170 and you should be good to go.|`|IDBasYahaa	most food hygene experts will tell you that after 4 hours it's no good to eat.  That is based on defrosted food tho.  Does it smell funky? Does it feel slimy? if the answer is no on both of those I'd risk it myself. But I wonldn't serve it to a customer at my restaurant.  If you choose it eat it & end up worshiping the porcelain gods, don't blame me!|`|36a3ynpJaa	If it was thawed in a sink to begin with I'd say you'd have to chuck it, but it should actually still be cold on the inside now.  Rinse it before you cook it.  Three hours is the spec for thawed food sitting out so I think you should be fine.  I wouldn't toss it.|`|AA10343094	yes. remember, you defrost turkeys for days on the counter. it may still be frozen in the middle. so long as it's not all room temperature (or about 80deg farenheight) cook it well, and it will be fine.|`|fEBOzWeXaa	if it was froze solid when you put it into the sink and is still cold, maybe. Check the temp of the raw meat.  If it is below 40 degrees, it is okay If it is in the 50-60 degree range, it is a goner.  At 40 degrees or lower, it would not be any different than if you put it in the fridge after thawing.|`|008512e32e60fcef19c7029ae0dc4d45aa	i would deff not take any chances and throw it out|`|0vQsoYIbaa	Depends on if some of it is still partially frozen.  I've done it, but it is probably risky.  Seems like it takes at least four hours to partially defrost anyway.
bmoCpcdraa	ya he got hit by a bus ,he is not seeing vistors at this time. he should make it but, i think his nose may be broke, he has to eat all that hospital food,i hope i helped, we need to all prey for him|`|AA10899659	he apparently got food poisoning while eating one of those burgers while making a commercial.  hahahaha|`|227b14cb2ec949a2ecdd4ba7068ff421aa	well they went out of business here so I don't see the commercials.

01a15b274ab4f4b0508b31a58db88c90aa	Baking powder for the rise, let the batter rest for 10 minutes or more before using, and don't add too much liquid.  Thicker batter will rise better than thin batter.<br>  <br>  Pan or griddle should be about 325 F.  Too hot and the pancake will burn before the water is evaporated.  Too low and the pancake won't fully cook.|`|ScZPVCUpaa	The best pancake mix I've tried is Krusteaz buttermilk pancake mix.  You just add water and they are nice and fluffy.<br>  You need a griddle for the best results so you know the temp.  Also, don't overmix the batter.|`|86990ea910ba06fc1046c0e615f983d3aa	Baking powder (not soda). You are probably need to cook them on a lower temp.|`|cu8fUJbMaa	I'm with aurorah.........Krusteaz is the best mix to use.......always fluffy. In fact, it's the mix I use in my restaurant. Mix in small batches and be sure you stir the batter if it's sits very long at all between pancakes.|`|Iw0HmL51aa	if u make ur pancakes in the stove wit oil and a pan it will become like that.the oil kinda frys the pancake that makes it a little leathery.<br>  try to buy a pancake maker and follow the cooking instructions
yezbmlaKaa	I'm not religious, but I do have a religion. My religion has nothing to do with why I don't drink. I don't drink because my life has been affected by many alcoholics. I lived in a town where at least three college students would die a year due to alcohol poisoning. I currently am enrolled in a college where already three dozen students have been sent to the ER for alcohol poisoning. The main reason why I don't drink is because once I had one too many to drink. I threw up all night. The next day, I couldn't eat or drink anything without praying to the porcelain god. I couldn't hold anything down until the day after that. I had an awful headache and felt like I was dying. My stomach was upset for over a week. I still can't think or be near hard liquor without getting nauseous.|`|9LFjvDzzaa	I don't need to drink a nasty-tasting liquid to have a good time. That's what orgasms are for. Also, I don't need alcohol to be uninhibited. ;)|`|1wDkKyLCaa	cause i see how i acted through another person and i said no more! no i'm dealing with that person acting how i did and it's hard, i hate it. I wish i would've seen it long ago|`|snBeIxpBaa	I don't drink alcoholic beverages (to be politically correct) simply because I do not like the taste of alcohol.|`|8ZSDt6SMaa	i dont drink because<br>  well for many reasons<br>  1) im underage<br>  2) my mother will be very upset with me. if she found out.<br>  3) and liquior tastes gross...<br>  and<br>  4) im to busy with my school work to even drink|`|YUjVFkocaa	I know that drinking has long been established as being "tite" and cool people do it, blah blah blah...<br>  <br>  But I simply don't see why that's the case! Drinking has been shown to mess you up in every aspect of life.<br>  <br>  Intellectually, it makes you dumber- in the short run, AND in the long run.<br>  <br>  Financially, it kills your money, drains you of stuff, and being drunk can lead to you being robbed or raped.<br>  <br>  Morally, the Bible states that drunkards "will not enter into the kingdom of heaven". So not only does drinking lower moral standards and screw up your earthly life, but it screws up your afterlife as well!<br>  <br>  Physically, drinking severely damages your liver and kidneys, and it causes apparent but less significant damage to the brain, to blood vessels, and to skin cells. This is why alcoholics often have slightly bigger veins, and dry, wrinkly skin, and age much quicker.<br>  <br>  Emotionally, drinking causes you to forget what happened last night, which can lead to psychological/emotional breakdowns. It also can cause you to have a "lapse in judgment", which usually results in sex or crime, and this is usually followed by shame, guilt, remorse, hopelessness, fear, anger, and regret.<br>  <br>  ====================<br>  <br>  Good riddance to you. I've been drinking 3 times in my life- and I can remember them all. One was at a sophomore party, one was a beach party, and one was with my ex, about a month and a half ago.<br>  <br>  I'm a Junior now, and let me tell you this: I may not be mature in some ways, but certainly I am mature enough to not stick my head in a sand like an ignorant duck, when they teach us the long-term many-pronged dangers of alcohol and drinking. I may not be the sharpest tool in the shed... but at least I've learned not to intentionally kill myself.<br>  <br>  If you want to drink, then go ahead. If you want to pay money to damage, embarrass, exploit, use, and ridicule yourself.... be my GUEST!<br>  <br>  But I'm telling you..... you'll regret it. Everybody always does, in the end. Either you'll piss all your money away, get raped sometime from passing out from whiskey, or end up getting bad grades and a bad job, because the alcohol affected your brain and killed brain cells.<br>  <br>  Or you'll end up like my brother.<br>  <br>  ===================<br>  <br>  My older brother died in a car accident, coming home from a party. His car flipped on a curb, and he was thrown from the car, and killed. There wasn't another car in sight. The cause? Alcohol. And his girlfriend luckily was alive (although hurt, and drunk as well) because she wore her seatbelt. But let it be known.... alcohol KILLS.<br>  =================<br>  <br>  Guns don't kill. DRUGS kill.<br>  =================================<br>  Source(s):<br>  n my opinion, drinking alone proves the devil's existence.<br>  <br>  Why, you ask?<br>  <br>  Because only in a society where sin is promoted, SOLELY on the basis of sin...<br>  <br>  Would losing money, slurring speech, getting raped, getting robbed, having a bad job, losing friends, aging faster, dying young, getting bad breath and rotten teeth, and getting physically weaker and slower, BE CONSIDERED "COOL"!<br>  <br>  You can still go to parties without drinking! Good god! I know sooo many girls my age who love to go to parties and drink... I stopped going to most of them cuz of this! it just pisses me off, that they feel the NEED to drink.<br>  <br>  If they're horny, GREAT! LET them go to parties, hang out, laugh, talk, make out with random guys, and have sex. But why the hell do they need the alcohol to do that? Do they simply want an EXCUSE to act immorally?? I SAY, if you plan on doing sh*t like that, just throw your conscience out the window!<br>  <br>  Cuz a lack of a conscience for a night, is better than a lack of life or a lack of money, because you pissed away your life or money with alcohol!<br>  <br>  Alcohol doesn't do a single positive thing for you. The drunk feeling is equaled out by a hangover of equal value, as well as headaches that night, and a burning in the chest.... so why do ppl like them?<br>  <br>  The fact that it makes you more open to talking is good- but in my opinion, people who have to drink to become outgoing and popular are f*gs, clowns! Why the hell do you need a drug to make you cool? Shyyyyttt I was born that way. I can talk to who i want, when i want, how i want, and get a girl if i want... as long as i put my mind to it, and focus on what to say.<br>  <br>  People who drink alcohol to be cool are the same as people who take steroids or HGH to get better at sports. They are cheaters and frauds, and in the end, they are hurting themselves instead of helping themselves.<br>  <br>  The short-term gains by ppl thinking they're cooler for doing it, is more than canceled out by the long-term harms.|`|BtDGWKSNaa	i drink.<br>  how can you live without alcohol?  that's my question.<br>  <br>  TiLtwrestler-<br>  i am very sorry about your brother.  really.<br>  but you did not have to call me a b*tch because i have different views than you do.
EMDNVrcjaa	I think brown mustard with horseradish is quite nice with roast beef.|`|Ih4T0QpOaa	salsa, olive oil, balsamic vinegar for dipping, margarine<br>  <br>  sliced avocados, tomatoes, cucumbers<br>  <br>  low fat sour cream instead of mayonnaise|`|L8RVJ4soaa	Hello,I would like to suggest mushing some fresh berries into a paste and not adding anything.Probably raspberries for max flavor.|`|NxS5D5DSaa	mustard, relish, guacamole, lowfat ranch|`|JqfIJtvYaa	Low-fat sour cream, you could add many different seasonings to it to create a taste that you like.
8lYZROjuaa	My friend (God rest her sweet soul) used to make them with a wonderful potato and sharp cheddar filling, saute'd in onions and butter.  Simple and delicious.  She passed before I got the recipe.|`|d1TTwwUUaa	sauted with butter and lots of onion   potato ones my fav than saurkraut as a side or mostly my main dish  lots and lots of pototo ones soaked in butter pan fi=ried with lotssssssssssss of onions<br>  Man I'm hungry for some NOW. Bye going to go make some|`|9LFjvDzzaa	Lol, as a side dish, but sometimes I serve it as a main meal; I use cut-up strips of ham, fried, with it; I like to add fresh cut spring onions and parsley with a little sour cream.|`|tqD9xUpYaa	I enjoy the ricotta filled pierogi my friend makes the most.  Fried in butter with sauteed onions and sour cream!  Next favorite is potato and cheddar.  We always have coleslaw with them too!|`|L8RVJ4soaa	Hi ,I usually like my pirogi-es lightly boiled from frozen just enough so they float,then transferred to a hot buttery pan and fried till both sides are golden brown.Then I usually salt them.<br>  Yes they are usually stuffed with potatoes and bacon and cheddar.|`|VzW0ZXScaa	stuffed with mashed potatoes and sauteed in a lot of butter with garlic, onions and parsley and served with a dollop of sour cream.<br>  duh!|`|hKlsJgVSaa	I admit I like doing the frozen periogi's. I have made them a few times though. So I like to boil mine then fry in butter until they have a light golden brown color. Then add a bit more butter and salt. Mmmmm<br>  <br>  Of course filled with taters and cheese.<br>  <br>  I have even seen salad recipes in Womans world with peirogi's.|`|ro5vFj9Aaa	i like them with a red sauce over them
DLl2VImpaa	I'm a whiskey guy, but my favorite rum would have to be Captain Morgan. And I never mix/chase.<br>  <br>  As far as spiced rum goes, it's the spiced like apple cider, not like food.|`|nlIpKw8Paa	captain morgan with cherry coke but malibu is okay to.|`|oEfa2myTaa	Try 10 Cane Rum from Trinidad, Spain. Its made with sugar cane. The ladies love it!!
AA10927032	No, not unhealthy, just make sure that bread is whole wheat, and take a little care with the serving size of the peanut butter. You could be racking up the calories if you put a massive amount of PB on the bread. <br>  You could substitute the pudding cup for some yogurt. Or have some low fat milk Hope you are not putting margarine on that sandwich!<br>  Do a little reading in the peanut butter aisle next time you go. Some peanut butters do have more sugar and/or more oil than others. And do not buy by the name or claim on the label. I picked up one "healthy" brand, and it had more sugar and fat in it than than the cheapo store brand did. <br>  Sugar is sugar. Your body takes it and turns into glucose and either uses it right away or stores it. Honey, jelly, it does not matter, again, just watch the serving size so you aren't getting hundreds of calories.|`|ILpp3ncYaa	Yeah, just don't go crazy on the peanut butter, it is high in fat.|`|AA11402528	if your not overweight your fine|`|v1tHjJ3haa	ya, it sounds good and healthy :D|`|VN0Wb9WCaa	Peanut butter is generally high in fat. Jam/jelly and honey are generally high in sugar. However, if the rest of your diet is good (ie: lots of fresh fruit and vegetables, good amount of fibre, etc) then I wouldn't worry about it.|`|VC0hx8xvaa	Too much (excess) of one food is not great, even though your choice is pretty good. Variety is one key to good nutrition.... try trading your pb for soy, Nutella, or almond butter twice a week. You may also want to rotate your veggie choices. :-) Also be aware of what PB you are using amidst this recall we're having!! Good luck!|`|yezbmlaKaa	Do you eat a well balanced meal for dinner and breakfast? If so, than there is nothing wrong with what you are eating for lunch.|`|8lYZROjuaa	I don't see anything wrong with it, as long as you like it.  Your choice is healthy, so don't worry your sweet self about it.|`|JzVrUW6Vaa	Well not on wheat bread with carrots! Jeez, how can you stand to eat so healthy?|`|Ru4CSc1raa	I find them ok.|`|zRPcKJlSaa	Variety is the spice of life. Try it you might like it!|`|NzezdETKaa	haha,my brother does the same.|`|f9sL3WgQaa	Only if you have healthy peanut butter. Most brands have very high oil content. Try an all natural peanut butter. Or even a soy peanut butter product.|`|bmoCpcdraa	sure , but have some milk with it. hope i helped
