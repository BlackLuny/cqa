PVbJtssZaa	If you're just looking for a phone to text on and thats it, then sure, get the quickfire. The only thing about texting with the quickfire is that it's on a physical keypad and not a touchscreen. It's pretty good with texting except the fact that the sides sometimes get in the way, but it's not much of a problem. The REAL problem is that the toouchscreen on the Quickfire is CRAP. I've had it and i sold it after having it a week. The con's overwrite the Pro's of the phone, it's slow, lacking in entertainment and technology, the touchscreen is difficult, and alot of people either like it, or flat out hate it.<br>  <br>  The eternity is really good on texting mainly because if you screw up texting, the t9 corrects you and understands what your attempting to spell, so it's not like u accidently hit the "r" instead of "e" and have to backspace the whole word. The phone all together is VERY GOOD! the screen is responsive and it has alot more technological things and apps on it than the quickfire. <br>  <br>  I'd go with the Eternity because its suitable for a teenager. Im 16 and i have it and love it. The camera is awesome, the texting is incredible, and the format just looks like something teens like.|`|ZzUfrEQRaa	If you really like to text hten the quickfire is probably better.  It's one of the best texting phones around. I think the eternity is a better overall phone, but for texting quickfire is best choice.
vnDHdtSZaa	I think it's just the o2 network. I had my 02 sim for a while didn't have any problems then suddenly one day i could send text messages, so now the only way i can send a text message is through multi-media which costs me 25p per text! And sometimes, it charges me double for one text. I also, know alot of people who have had trouble like you, with calling people on 02. And with porn being sent to there numbers. O2 is just bad news i think, and im thinking of changing networks soon.|`|edCUawppaa	Huh?|`|ZzUfrEQRaa	I agree those phones don't really work right much.I don't like 02 phones anymore!

nObgLVkraa	Yepperz! Even tho I don't have it, I ? it. My bro has one and I was texting ALL night on it. Like if ur in class and you have to text really fast, it's alot easier than having to push buttons 3-4 times to get 1 letter.

You don't want a prepaid phone. they are more expensive than regular monthly plans<br>  <br>  2. Use email from a comptuer or IM from one - don't fool with "texting" texting is a fad that will pass just like any other thing and besides it costs your wireless provider NOTHING to rely a text from one phone to another while they charge you each time for it. <br>  <br>  3. Be wise, Save your money - gas prices are bound to revert back up and when they do, it will hit hard.

c1c3f15d1b507986be998c3d578230b9aa	I think for price and quality the Canon A590IS described below is the best buy.<br>  <br>  What gives a camera its picture quality?  <br>  It is mostly the skill of the photographer that produces high quality pictures. The lens and camera are very important, but the ability to set the scene, adjust the cameras settings, and hold the camera very still or use a tripod with auto or remote shutter actuation when required is what gets the great pictures.  Megapixel resolution is about potential photo size, not picture quality.<br>  <br>  In new cameras, look for a viewfinder (LCD invisible in bright sun), optical image stabilizer, and check battery prices.  High mega pixel settings take longer to process and may not be needed unless required for very large pictures.  Maximum print size for a 3 mega pixel setting is 8 x 10 inches. Click links below for more details.<br>  <a href="http://www.kodak.com/eknec/PageQuerier.jhtml?pq-path=398&pq-locale=en_US&_requestid=2039" rel="nofollow">http://www.kodak.com/eknec/PageQuerier.j...</a> ...<br>  <a href="http://www.kenrockwell.com/tech/mpmyth.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.kenrockwell.com/tech/mpmyth.h...</a> ...<br>    <br>  The Canon A590IS is a slightly older model that is available everywhere at great sale prices. Think it is a great camera and a best buy. It has auto focus, a viewfinder, optical image stabilization, and uses rechargeable NiMH batteries.  <br>  <a href="http://www.imaging-resource.com/PRODS/A590IS/A590ISA.HTM" rel="nofollow">http://www.imaging-resource.com/PRODS/A5...</a> ...<br>  <a href="http://bountii.com/deal-1523871-canon-powershot-8-0-megapixel.html" rel="nofollow">http://bountii.com/deal-1523871-canon-po...</a> ...  <br>   <br>  For expanded wide angle or telephoto capabilities, the A590 IS is compatible with Canon's accessory lens adapters: A small button next to the lens bezel is actually a latch; press it and you can remove the bezel ring, exposing a bayonet mount for accessory lenses. Canon offers the WC-DC52 0.7x wide-angle lens, the TC-DC52A telephoto lens, the 250D 52mm closeup lens separately, along with the LA-DC52G adapter to mount them on the camera. (Note that the wide, tele, and macro lenses all need the LA-DC52G adapter to mount them to the camera. The lenses won't work by themselves.)<br>   <br>  There is no one particular place to get great buys, but you may see something above that really helps you find the best buy.

KLL0Acrwaa	Yes, Pentax makes waterproof digital cameras.    Their current version is the Pentax Optio W60.    http://www.pentaximaging.com/digital-cam...    Older versions can also be found cheaply on eBay.  Try the Optio W30, for example.    Also, you might also consider a waterproof housing for regular point and shoot cameras.  For example, I have a Canon A570 IS and use a Canon waterproof housing (cost, about $125) for that camera.  The advantage is that you can take the camera deeper than an Olympus or Pentax.  However, it does make the camera considerably larger.

Most PS2 emulators require a BIOS dump from a working PS2.  Most PS2 emulators are very young in their development, so don't expect most commercial games to run well, if they run at all.  Ditto with Dreamcast emulators.    You will need both the emulator, and ROM dumps of games you want to play.  Downloading games you don't own is blatantly illegal, so don't ask for help about how to do that.  Emulation in general is a big legal gray area, so don't ask about things that might be illegal.
4fWZL4TRaa	Generally it is better to connect the LEDs in series, so only one resistor is needed for each string of LEDs. This means a higher voltage is needed, but it is more efficient because only one resistor per series string.    Charging the battery:  I think the first thing to answer is how to charge the batteries. In your other question you say that you have no electricity. I suppose this means you would use a solar panel. The common type are for a 12V battery with 36 cells, and they have a voltage from about 14V to about 22V under working conditions.    Battery Voltage:  This would mean that the maximum voltage under charge is 14V. NiCd batteries vary from 1 volt (discharged) to 1.45V when fully charged. Therefore for a solar panel charger, 9 or 10 cells in series gives the highest voltage battery that can be charged. I would chose 10 cells. This is then similar to a 12V lead acid battery.    LED specification:  You need the specification of the LED forward voltage (Vf). This is often 3.6V for white LEDs. Download the data sheet that suits your LED part number. I assume these are ordinary small LEDs, the 5mm plastic package. In that case they will be rated at perhaps 20mA maximum.    How many LEDs:  The minimum voltage for the LEDs is the sum of Vf for the LEDs and an allowance for the resistor. Unfortunately only 2 LEDs can be in series. There is 7.2V across the LEDs, and the voltage across the resistor is between (10-7.2) = 2.8V and (14.2-7.2) = 7V.    Determine the series resistor fo 2 LEDs and 10 cells:  The resistor should be such that the current is no more than 20mA with 7V, so:  R = V/I = 7V/0.02A = 350 ohms. The closest standard value is 390 ohms. The current range is therefore:  I = V/R = 7V/390 ohms = 18mA down to 2.8V/390 ohms = 7.2mA.  The power for the resistor is V x I = 7V x 0.018A = 0.126W so the resistor is a 390 ohm x 0.5W type. I prefer metal film resistors, not the carbon type.    The rest of the LEDs...  With 2 LEDs in each string, you have 6 to 8 strings for 12 to 16 LEDs.    The battery capacity (Ah)...  The average current at the average battery voltage of 12V is:   (12V-7.2V) / 390 ohms = 12.3mA  The total current for 8 strings is 100mA more or less.  To run for 5 hours the capacity is 0.5Ah. To allow 5 or 6 days for no sun, 2.5 to 3Ah. This looks like 4 parallel sets of 10 cells in series.    Size of solar panel...  We have to charge a 2.8Ah battery in a reasonable time. Lets say 4 hours. The actual charge is 1.4 times the capacity, so 2.8Ah x 1.4 = 3.92Ah. So it needs about 1A. A panel that delivers 1A (short circuit current in full sun is Isc) is usually rated at something like 18W. A larger panel is acceptable within reason. It needs a suitable charger to protect the battery from overcharge and overheating.    Charge Control...  This is a problem as the normal chargers are for lead acid type batteries. The simplest charger is an automatic switch that cuts off the charge at 14V, and cuts on at about 13V across the battery. The ideal charger for NiCd batteries stops charging when the voltage starts going down or stops going up, but this is more complex. The link below has an example circuit.    Hope that sorts out your problems.

J6hMlpncaa	To be honest I'm not a fan of these deals, mainly because:<br>  <br>  1, it is often 3 network who offers them which means the poor user gets stuck in a 18 month contract with terrible signal coverage to the point where some people go back to PAYT so that they can make calls.<br>  <br>  2, you get a real crappy phone to use for 18 months plus you have to wait (sometimes) up to 6 month before they will even send you the TV as they want to make sure you don't cancel the contract.<br>  <br>  3, do you even need that many minutes? It will cost ￡612 over 18 months and to be honest you can have a 18 month contract with a free up to date phone for ￡20 a month which leaves ￡252 within that 18 months would could have been spent on a new TV. I bought my new TV with pay nothing for 9 months and payed it off month by month... done <br>  <br>  Over all up to you but be very wary of the above before you comit to anything

AA10912074	You can take it to many camera stores and pay them to clean it, too.  <br>  <br>  Your camera cost a lot, be absolutely certain what you are doing before you put chemicals in there.

You need for that a simple flexible straight piece of  plastic and cut a spoon out of it that fits the sensor in size from one edge to the other on the small side.<br>  Then you need sensor swab cloth to do it. You can also buy the ready made spoons. The cloth is wrapped on the spoon, held in place by a rubber or tape and you put methanol on the cloth and wipe it from one end to the other with a light pressure on the spoon.<br>  You may use Eclipse liquid but I found myself Ethanol or Methanol to be best and cheaper.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cameraclean.co.uk/acatalog/Photographic_Solutions_Sensor_Cleaning_Tools.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cameraclean.co.uk/acatalog/Ph...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.luminous-landscape.com/essays/sensor-cleaning.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.luminous-landscape.com/essays...</a><br>  <br>  go to this pages to get an idea.<br>  <br>  When is your sensor dirty. Shoot in the bright blue sky and look on the screen (magnify to maximum) if you see any spots. Check the lens for those and if they remain with any lens, it's time to clean. I have aD40, never needed cleaning, had a D200, cleaned once in 3 years, have a Fuji S5, never cleaned. Sensor cleaning included in cameras is a religion like live view, artificial horizon and similar gadgets. You don't need it but it is commercial brainwashing to make you buy the product only. Note that if you turn your camera downwards to change a lens, never change in dusty places and never blow on the sensor or inside the camera with your mouth, you will never need any cleaning.

AA11056614	I don't know what you mean by "throw". The Throw distance IS the distance from the screen.<br>  <br>  In general projectors give the most light (brightness) when the lens is in the mid zoom position (rather than either extreme), so mount somewhere in the mid range to get the size image you need. The lens is often sharpest there too ... another reason for the mid distance. This often means ceiling mounting. Personally, I prefer to shelf mount at the rear of the room high on the wall ... but not all projectors allow that.<br>  <br>  See the link and choose your particular projector. Note that as you change distance, image size and brightness vary. use this calculator as a guide.
w7Ffw6MYaa	with the minute packs, all you can do is talk (no texting or web usage). If you want to text or buy anything, you must have a sufficient cash balance left in your account. So if you buy a minute pack for $20, and want to have money left, you would have to purchase a $30 or more Top-Up card. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps :-)|`|xqan4ChSaa	i dont understand your question|`|SqpPiLnNaa	no idea soz pal<br>  <a href="http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090220075011AAFBwVH&r=w">http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|7YOKSvRTaa	Just so you know, a Minute Pack is a bunch of minutes that you buy for one low price and are available only on the 20 cents/minute plan. The requirement of the 20 cents/minute plan is that you Top-Up at least $20 every 90 days to keep your service active, even if you have a balance remaining. <br>  <br>  Minute Packs expire 30 days from purchase. As long as you buy another Minute Pack within 30 days, unused minutes will roll forward for the next 30 days. If you don't purchase a Minute Pack or your Minute Pack expires you can keep talking at 20￠ per minute. <br>  <br>  If you don't use all your minutes in 30 days and you buy another Minute Pack before the end of 30 days, any unused minutes will roll forward to the next month. <br>  <br>  Just a quick tip for the future, there are a few different ways to buy a Minute Pack on the Pay As You Go Plan: <br>  <br>  1. Each time you Top-Up, we'll ask if you'd like to use the money you just added to buy a Minute Pack. <br>  <br>  2. When you check your balance from your phone, you can buy a Minute Pack from the "My Account" screen. <br>  <br>  3. You can also buy a Minute Pack here on the web or on your phone by going to: Menu-My Account. <br>  <br>  4. Or, add a Minutes pack, login to 'My Account' from<br>  www.virginmobileusa.com and then click on 'Top-Up or Buy a Minute pack' under Plan. Then select the appropriate Minute pack and click on 'Buy a New Minute Pack' to purchase a Minute Pack or 'Top-Up Now' to add cash balance on your account.<br>  <br>  You pay for Minute Packs with the money in your balance. So if you don't have enough in your balance to buy the Minute Pack you want, you'll need to Top-Up before you can buy your Minute Pack.<br>  <br>  Please keep in mind that Minute Packs expire 30 days from purchase. You will receive a Virgin Alert three days before the Minute Pack expires reminding you to purchase another Minute Pack to roll forward any unused minutes.|`|AA10110131	SAME THING.

AA10980750	Under the Sale of Goods Act a shop can offer to repair an item but the repair should be permanent.  It sounds like you now are entitled to an exchange or refund and the shop has no legal basis for saying that they don't give refunds.  Don't let them fob you off with saying that the manufacturer is responsible either because your contract is with the shop not the supplier or manufacturer.  Tell them you are taking the case to the Small Claims Court if you don't get any satisfaction from them.  It only costs you €15 to take a case but shops nearly always settle because they don't want the bad publicity.  Remember you don't have to accept a Credit Note either!<br>  This is what the National Consumer Agency has to say on the matter;<br>  "If they repair the item but it still doesn’t work properly, for whatever reason, you should be in a better position to look for a replacement or refund.<br>  Before you agree to the shop carrying out a repair, you should put it in writing to them that, if the repair is unsuccessful, or there are any other problems with the item, you reserve your right to look for a replacement or refund."|`|g8HVHqPuaa	What provider do you have?

I have it and because it is dark, no one will see if it has scratches!|`|Qbhuj5a3aa	Wow, practically everyone is going for Purple (which is my choice)  I was given  4GB IPod which is Silver. Within a few days they bought out the new colour range for a similar price but having 8GB. Immediately I saw this new colour range I chose Purple as it my favourite colour.  My suggestion is go with what you prefer.  Good Luck|`|9ydlIWUNaa	purple, it's cool. not too childish, but not too boring and dull like black.|`|TdIx5uRLaa	the purple is really nice|`|7Y4fv3g9aa	I would say purple because in different lights it looks dark blue so basically you'd get 2 colours!!!|`|cYpkxiXKaa	blue:D
53sIyhiYaa	I'm not sure of the actual question, so to paraphrase, if you are wondering how long it takes to add the Rock Band 1 songs to Rock Band 2, it took approximately 20 minutes on an Xbox to copy them to the drive and add them. It did not require any internet access for this process.
xQjToANXaa	There is no doubt iphone is the good convergence of mobile phone and ipod touch but iphone is not good regarding camera and battery stand- by. so. I would recommend you  mobile phone nad ipod touch. Now choice is yours. http://www.blueunplugged.com/c.aspx?c=39...|`|cqzZjRVwaa	Well I have the iPod Touch and I think it's excellent. I haven't got the iPhone as I already have an LG Viewty too, so there is not much point in me getting another mobile.|`|Iq4qLnobaa	Don't get any of them. Technology is overrated!|`|9ydlIWUNaa	phone and an ipod touch  actually, i find my ipod touch very annoying as it crashes and because it's all touchscreen, its a bit fiddly to use. i'd say get an ipod classic or mini, not the touch screen ones.  the iphone also has similar problems. i know it has the ipod and phon in one, but it gets frustrating when it crashes.|`|FX4obiYmaa	i had to make this decision for christmas.   i went ahead and got a cheaper phone and got the 2nd gen ipod. and im happy with it.  but it all depends on what you wanna do. and which is cheaper. if its cheaper to get a phone and ipod just do that instead of just the iphone.|`|AA12180617	if you need more than 16GB get the ipod plus another phone if not get the iphone...  I have a 32GB ipod plus a samsung Tocco and that works well but not quite as convenient in one go.    yo  will find filling 16GB very easy. I only have 500mb free on my touch with all music movies and apps I have. the iphone is limited to 16GB and 99% of phones are only 8GB the 16GB is very hard to get hold of!|`|DjSQZO7Saa	I asked myself the same question..   I have a simple small phone and just carry my 2nd generation ipod touch.. I think its much cheaper in the long run.. and its identical to iphone except the phone part.. its great|`|TdIx5uRLaa	Get a phone and iPod touch  it will work out cheaper in the end  and iphones are really bad too|`|Mz1I71gVaa	I did the same thing  I got an ipod touch and a simple cheap phone  it works out cheaper, and i think ipod touches are better|`|OqjNyUgDaa	It depends on what type of phone you want.  If you want a phone with a good camera then the iphone isnt for you.  If you want a phone that is good for internet then the iphone is a good choice for you.|`|nasm1bJWaa	definitely the i pod touch  my friend has an i pod touch and i use it regularly.  i have had some experience with the i phone and tbh i find its overrated.  its quite fiddly and annoying when you try to play music and text.  if you like the internet on a phone then by all means get the i phone.  but if you prefer texting, playing music and taking photos then dont.  just get the i pod touch!  =D x|`|EQ0NhUcOaa	Depends.    If you need a new phone, then the Iphone is what I suggest, it has everything!|`|rB86DhJiaa	The main thing to think about is whether you want to carry around two devices. Currently, I have the ipod touch and a separate phone. This works out well. However, I am always carrying both around in my purse. They have also been a few times I wished I had the iphone because I wasn't in a wifi area and wanted to check something on the internet. The GPS capability would also be nice. Plus the ipod touch doesn't have a camera or microphone, both of which come on the iphone.    Another thing to think about is the monthly plan. With the iphone you have a monthly charge that is most likely going to be more than a regular cell phone. I believe the smallest plan is $69.99/mo. It is the price for the amount of minutes you want, plus $30 for the data plan. However, you don't need a texting plan because people can text your email and you can email their phone. (Unless you still want texting).    As I said, I have the touch. I love it. It is so amazing. Yet, there have been times I wished I got the phone. I probably will get it in a year or two.    Everyone I know with the iphone loves it. Everyone I know with the touch loves it as well. Either one is a great choice. Good luck!!|`|cad0f44f1e8e9e5376619cd1f7925a9daa	I was having the same thing at Christmas. If it was me I would rather just get an iPhone (if you have the moeny and want to get everything :]) However, I am quite happy with having a phone and an iPod touch. I also prefer being able to take a phone out with me I am not going to be happily able to take out with out the high risk of it being stolen/broken/dropped and I wouldn't mind if I did drop it (have several times before) whilst my 400 (or whatever it is) iPod touch is at home safe (:

They'll have to make the Wii 2 sometime soon, probably 2010-2012 as well.<br>  Playstation 3- was made in the same year as the Wii, 2006. Sony designed it though to last for 10 years! Meaning it will still be around and popular in 2016.<br>  <br>  The PS3 amazing. It has better reliability, can be turned into a PC and download Windows XP or Vista, or for free download Linux. For everything that it has, it is much cheaper then the Xbox 360, consider the following.<br>  With the PS3, you get:<br>  -A Blue-Ray player, and one of the best ones out so far. It is also considered new technology. If you don't have Blue-Ray players to start out with when buying the PS3, it also has a DVD upconverter, meaning that you can play normal DVD's with better quality picture.<br>  -The PS3 also features PSN( the (P)lay(S)tation (N)etwork). It's free to use, and download demo's such as Warhawk, and Home. Unlike Xbox Live, it doesn't cost $80 for the first year bundle, and $50 for each following year.<br>  -The PS3 has exlusives like no other console, like Resistance 2, LittleBig Planet, Motorstorm: Pacific Rift, Metal Gear Solid 4 and in the future: inFamous, Killzone 2, God of War 3, Uncharted 2, L.A. Noire, Heavy Rain and Massive Action Game (M.A.G.—in which over 256 players will be able to play on the same map at the same time)<br>  -For the money, you get 80GB of space, and only 60GB on the Xbox 360, USB mini drives can also be used from the 2.0 USB ports in the front of the PS3. It also has an easily removable HDD.<br>  -Built in, superior Wi-Fi<br>  -Web browser, just like a PC's<br>  <br>  On the Xbox 360's you get a 1 in 3 failure rate. Even though Microsoft knows of this problem, they don't even think about the red rings of death while shipping it out to unsuspecting customers<br>  <br>  So here’s a quick run-down of what you must buy with the PS3 and 360:<br>  <br>  PS3:<br>  Console(there will be a $100 decrease in April 2009) $300<br>  Game $60<br>  Controller $55<br>  Total: $415<br>  <br>  Really, if you bought all the things the PS3 offers SEPERATELY, you would be able to buy roughly 3 PS3's with that money (gaming console+computer+SUPERB Blu Ray player)<br>  <br>  Xbox 360:<br>  Console $300<br>  Game $60<br>  Controller $60<br>  Xbox Live $80<br>  Wi-Fi $100<br>  Total: $660<br>  <br>  As you can see, the PS3 is cheaper by far and plus, The multi-platform games are using about 25% of the PS3's graphical potential. So that means much better graphics in the future when they can get a grip on the PS3's power.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, most multiplatform games are using about 98% of the 360’s potential. And they look about the same. At this rate in 1 year, the PS3 will have outshone the 360 graphic wise. It’s just that the 8-core Cell Broadband Processor is very complex, and takes developers time to get used to. And they are getting the hang of things. The PS3 has a very good reliability rate: only 0.2% failure rate (note the decimal), while Xbox 360's have a 30% failure rate. So, for every 1000 of both consoles produced, 2 PS3's are defective, whilst about 330 Xbox 360's are defective. The numbers speak for themselves. Many game developers have OPENLY stated that in the near future, and right now, they will use the PS3 as a lead-developing platform, and then they will port the games to the 360.<br>  <br>  So pretty much, the PS3 wins hands down. It's the best system people have seen yet! The PS3 will also progress in the future, like it's downgraded because it was so good that other people couldn't afford it. So anyways hope I helped!|`|JE8X99xlaa	PS3 Is Better Than An XBox 360 Here Is Why:<br>  <br>  Good Things:<br>  PS3 Has Better Graphics And Has Less Lag Online,<br>  XBox 360's Have A Wider Range Of Games,<br>  PS3's Look Better<br>  XBox's Have Three Different Types That Can All  Go Online With Each-Other,<br>  PS3's Can Go Online For Free,<br>  XBox Take Up Less Space,<br>  PS3's Have BLU-Ray.<br>  <br>  Bad Things:<br>  XBox's Can Sometimes Breakdown And Take Up To  3 Weeks To be Fixed,<br>  PS3's Are More Expensive,<br>  XBox's Eventually Make Your Fingers Tired Due To The 'Bad' Controller Design,<br>  XBox's Do Not Have Free Online Play.|`|912889ffe6d1f7e7c946f67482ee58dcaa	Holy crap!  A question that calls out fanboys!<br>  <br>  The only real difference now between the Xbox 360 and the ps3 is the games.|`|22qQjYcxaa	Hey buddy how are you doing? I see your sad about buying a PS3 because you went to a friends house and played Xbox360. Well, I bought my PS3 60GB 2 years ago, but I bought a PS3, because I had a lot of PS2 games and I trust SONY more than Microsoft. Yes, the Xbox 360 does have more games out and better graphics, but that is because developers are still make games for the their main platform, Xbox360. What does this mean? Well, wen developers make a game they need a system to be their standard. So, they make the game for that system then they "Port" it over to the other systems. So, if they make games for the Xbox360 and port it over to PS3, then the quality of the game will suffer bcause it was meant to be n xbox. The bad this is that SONY takes for ever to get the ball rolling, but once they do they do deliver. Now that Killzone 2 is coming out it is going to be one of the most have games on the PS3. Also, I forgot to mention, Developers annouced that PS3 will be the next system that they will use as a statard to develop games. Now for online, yes the XBox 360 has a everything laid out for them, but thats because they have been doing the online thing since the XBOX, so they have had some time to work on it. Sony's PS2 wasn't up to par with online capbilities as the XBOX, but PS3 is showing lots of Poteniel. Lasty, Bang for your Buck.<br>  The Xbox 360 is a good system, but you have to buy lots of add ons, unless you buy an XBox 360 Elite, and you MUST watch out for the RED RING OF DEATH! PS3 is pricey, but you get every thing in one pacage. Unfourtunely they don't make the Backward compatirble models anymore, but they designed the PS3 with a ten year life span.<br>  <br>  So should you keep you PS3?<br>  <br>  Well, Play Resistance, Resistance 2, Metal Gear Solid 4, Little Big Planet, and Killzone 2. After that what a Blu Ray movie on a HDTV and tell me what you think. if you don't like the games I just mention then go ahead and switch systems, but remeber all the things i mentioned.

You actually lose picture quality when you crop a higher MP photo down to a smaller size.  It also takes more money, memory space, processing, and transmission time with a higher setting.<br>  <br>  What gives a camera its picture quality?  <br>  It is mostly the skill of the photographer that produces high quality pictures. The lens and camera are very important, but the ability to set the scene, adjust the cameras settings, and hold the camera very still or use a tripod with auto or remote shutter actuation when required is what gets the great pictures.  Mega pixel resolution is about potential photo size, not picture quality.<br>   <br>  In new cameras, look for a viewfinder (LCD invisible in bright sun), optical image stabilizer, and check battery prices.  High mega pixel settings take longer to process and may not be needed unless required for very large pictures.  Maximum print size for a 3 mega pixel setting is 8 x 10 inches.

Essentially what going from 5 megapixels to 10 megapixels will do is double your capture resolution.  More than likely though you will also be getting at least one better lens which will increase your resolution even more.  When you are editing photos and you zoom in really close to work on fine details they will have squares showing up.  Those squares are the pixels as they were captured.  The sensor should be the same size so what you are doing is packing more pixels into the same amount of space.  Therefore your image looks smother at higher enlargements.|`|yFDUecOPaa	A pixel is a single dot on a monitor or a camera sensor. Get up really close to your TV and you'll see all the individual dots, or pixels.<br>  <br>  The mega prefix means 1 million.<br>  <br>  Megapixels is the count of how many millions of pixels of resolution the camera senor has. This is calculated by multiplying the number of horizontal pixels times the vertical pixels.<br>  <br>  Just quickly: the camera you want is an excellent camera, I have several friends with it and they love the pictures it takes (I'm more of a Nikon guy, but whadayagonnado? :) ).<br>  <br>  That said, if you want to get really geeky you can start reading about the Megapixel myth. Camera companies love the megapixel because it's easy to measure and put on marketing materials. It is, however, not the best measurement of camera performance. The quality of the lens and the size of the sensor are much more important. My 6 megapixel SLR from 4 years ago will take far better pictures than an inexpensive 10 megapixel point and shot you buy today.<br>  <br>  For some more geeky reading (if you want) do a web search for "pixel" and for "megapixel myth". There's a ton of info out there... but none of it critical for making the choice you're making. <br>  <br>  Enjoy your new camera!|`|AA11464317	Pixels are like little buckets that capture the light coming in through the lens. More is generally better up to a point because more pixels improve the photograph's resolution and ability to make big enlargements. But when most of us view our pictures on a computer display or tv monitor, it is that display which limits the apparent resolution. The downside to more pixels is larger file sizes and more memory usage. So most people convert the file to a jpeg compressed file which takes away the resolution gained by larger pixel count. Do you sense a marketing sales gimmick here?|`|f1fd9f1cf1a58e760d7ffd75daa60953aa	higher is cheaper

3CJAUyqPaa	Well... since you did not state any budget...<br>  <br>  Start with the Sony BRC300. It is not a camcorder, "just" a camera - but the video signal feeds a recording deck. If you use a camcorder - one with built-in recording media - how do you expect to put in blank media (tapes, flash memory cards, etc) when the media is full? If hard drive based, how will you transfer the data off the camcorder's hard drive when it is full?<br>  <br>  Several of the reasons it is expensive (in addition to the PTZ controls) is because it has large imaging chips, high resolution and a relatively large lens... for broadcast-quality video capture.<br>  <br>  Good quality video and good useful remote control does not come cheap. The recording decks are pricy, too.<br>  <br>  I strongly suggest you contact a professional video installation and support company to go down this path with you.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|N1CIndMOaa	You would need a motorized tripod head.

Xxviy63Paa	No. Linux isn't run on any accounts anyhow. The accounts aren't even stored on your ps3, just the login id connected to them. And those are both part of the main XMB partition. The 10gb OtherOS partition is completely separate from that, so when you run linux, you won't be running under any login ID at all, except for the username you create for linux.<br>  <br>  All your data will be deleted, yes - but that doesn't mean you have to make backups of everything. Only what you can't replace by downloading. Usually you can fit all your game data and saves onto a flash drive and put them on a pc. It doesn't take much space to back up videos, music and photos either. Demos you can just re-download. Downloadable full games is the one where you'll have to decide whether to take the trouble to back them up, or to use up one of your 5 downloads after you install linux. <br>  <br>  Reformatting to create the otheros partition wll take about an hour, and the install for most distros takes about half an hour. If I remember right, the XMB stays installed, that is it doesn't have to download again after formatting. <br>  <br>  Having to back up all your stuff is a nuisance, but it only has to be done once.<br>  <br>  Once you have installed otheros, you might want to add a usb external hard drive, particularly if you're using Yellow Dog. YDL is way too big of a distro to just have 10gb of disc space. <br>  <br>  I also strongly recommend immediately downloading the mplayer plugin for Firefox, then adding Greasemonkey to firefox and installing scripts that make Firefox use mplayer. This allows you to use mplayer for flash video, it is much better than Adobe's crap linux flash player. Also you will initially find that dvd's and other stuff won't play at all; you need to install non-free codecs and restricted packages, this is because dvd's use CSS encryption and dvd players are supposed to pay to be compatible. You can find the packages fairly easily in the repos though. If you are using a red hat-based distro like ydl, and can't find them, look for them at www.easyubuntu.com, download them without installing, then download the "alien" package to convert the debian packages to red hat, then install.<br>  <br>  Once you get it going, you'll find your ps3 under linux is better at watching Youtube than the XMB is. Particularly since with mplayer, you can download and keep anything there.|`|912889ffe6d1f7e7c946f67482ee58dcaa	Nope, it has to be formatted.  Which means you will lose all your data.

zpmXGZsCaa	Midi (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) is data, not sound.  It is specifically note data: which note, note on, note off, how hard or soft to play note, etc.  <br>  <br>  If you have a program like Cakewalk, Sonar, or Cubase, you can program your songs on the computer and then send the data via midi to your keyboard.  It will play exactly what you wrote.   <br>  <br>  You can also send (and record) note data from your keyboard to your computer via the midi cables.  However, you will send only the data and not the sounds.  Your computer will play the notes on its internal sound chip, so it will sound different from your keyboard's sounds.  <br>  <br>  You can also add a synthesizer module (a synth without keys) and use the midi interface to play it with your current keyboard.|`|7uCfW237aa	they allow you to control and synchronize the keyboard with your computer. For instance you could use software on the computer to control what your keyboard plays, or you could hook it up to some music software and control software functions using the keyboard.<br>  <br>  You can also link several midi instruments together to control and synchronize them.<br>  <br>  Think of it not as an audio transfer but instead as the same kind of transfer you get between your controller and games console...

A converter box could only monitor what you watch if it had some sort of output, such as a telephone line. While I don't have one of those boxes, my understanding is they only convert a received signal from digital to analog and send it to your TV. <br>  <br>  Even if someone was monitoring what you were watching, what in the world could they use that data for? Do you think the government is going to arrest you for watching ABC instead of NBC?

VcykWwCYaa	In my last apartment I had the same requirements although I had Virgin install it from the start and they did the following:<br>  <br>  Main incoming virgin box was in the bedroom. They ran a single cable to a splitter near the secondary virgin box in this room. One cable into the box and the other cable through the wall into the lounge.<br>  <br>  That cable then split and one went into the Virgin HD box and the other into the broadband cable modem.<br>  <br>  I would get a wireless router so you don't have to worry about moving cables for broadband and only need to run a cable to the V-box in the bedroom.<br>  <br>  I hope this is helpful. Doesn't sound like it is too complicated. You should talk to Virgin because if you order another box for multi-room, they may cable it for you.|`|d956b5a86c3910ccc374a8987ce51194aa	idk|`|8213dbb28238df28f026dac640239fb1aa	In my experience she'll relax after a few cocktails.|`|9E502jsuaa	Lol>>funny question|`|RPa1LhNqaa	love her and she will love u back|`|fZfVM1unaa	Convince her you love her...

lO06RGLcaa	Mod the Wii hardware all you like (or pretty much any other system) but don't expect stock games to run on it or expect to be able to take it online. I'm certain that there are mods for SSBB available online, but using them or adding them to your system may screw it up such that if you download a system update/use a new game in it you might break it.

3CJAUyqPaa	I don't have a DVD based camcorder because they provide such poor video quality - especially for editing or uploading. But I have done this for friends many times...<br>  <br>  Assuming your computer has a drawer loading DVD drive, download and install a DVD ripper. There are lots available - I use HandBrake<br>  <a href="http://handbrake.fr/" rel="nofollow">http://handbrake.fr/</a><br>  <br>  Finalize the disc in the camcorder, take it out, put it in the drawer loading DVD drive of your computer, launch your DVD ripper and save the file to a file type your video editor can deal with so you can edit... or just watch.<br>  <br>  If your computer does not have a drawer loader - but has a slot loader... NEVER put a small or odd-sized optical disc in a slot loader - the disc will get scratched and you can break the drive - instead, get a drawer loader. This may mean getting an external drive. I like those from LaCie.<br>  <br>  Since you did not tell us what computer you have, we have no way to know what computing capabilities you have.

tWoN22rRaa	To change the aperture, switch the camera into either Aperture Priority mode or full manual mode. In the former you then just have to turn the command dial at the top-back-right. In the latter, press the exposure compensation button (+/-) and then turn the dial.    Now if you want a shallow depth of field (eg. with the background behind your *subject* blurred), select a fast/lower-number aperture. If you want more things to be sharp, then select a slower aperture. Remember that a higher number also means less light is allowed into the camera. That is something you should obviously consider when shooting in dimmer lit situations. You can raise the ISO, but that means more noise (and 4:3 dSLRs aren't the best performers at high ISO).|`|1abaa60b0511b1e2c248dd1b30e73037aa	f8 is always safe or f5.6. make sure you have enough light. if not use a higher iso
7ciw1aCXaa	Depends on the charger; they sometimes have a clear plastic insert which the wiimote sits in - this often lights up when charging. Check the position of the wrist strap as you insert it into the charger as this can prevent contacts from touching.    I just noticed you said you plugged it into your PC, not your Wii, and that you have no instructions.    (1) Your Wii has two USB ports at the back. Use these, not a PC.  (2) A PC may shut off the +5V supply that the charger is using if it does not recognise the device or if it senses it is drawing too much current. There are two different maximum levels of power that a USB port can supply depending on if it is a powered or unpowered port.  (3) Make sure you use rechargeable batteries in the 'pack'. The 'pack' comes with the charger and replaces the cover on the back of the Wiimote. It usually has two metal contacts, and they often take AAA batteries rather than the AA that the unmodified Wiimote takes.|`|kqyANOfsaa	blue light means charging and green means charged plz put this as best answer because it is|`|ROXeXlGVaa	you can plug the charger in to the back of your wii console the lights may come on then as there are two different types of usb ports your pc may not have the right one their maybe some instructions in the wii box or one the side of the charger box    kris|`|2yUQiKlvaa	Wel first you need to plug the charger into the Wii, at the back of it there are two usb ports, use these.     when you have put your remote into the charger it should glow red, when it has finished charging it will go blue. it will also be blue when there isnt a controller in there.    =)
YiY9Yd2Jaa	Most bodies within a price range are similar in the quality of image they produce. The thing that is important is the lens. For portrait work on a crop sensor you will need a fixed lens of around 35-50mm with a speed of at least F 1:7 if it is to be used indoors.  For landscape you need a wider lens, a zoom with a wide lower end would do, as long as it has a decent image IQ. You also will need flash for portrait fill and indoor work.     Look first at the lenses, at the cost, then look to the camera body. Note that invariably all the kit lenses provided in a "deal" with a camera body are one step up from rubbish. They are not of a suitable quality for serious work.|`|tKWwZpOAaa	Go with nikon, you will have more lens options since they have kept the F-mount constant since the 60's|`|j5Apt8hWaa	Since both camera companies make excellent equipment and lenses that pros prefer, you are really only looking at the features on each camera.

ABPK7rHeaa	I wrote this to someone elses similar question.<br>  <br>  Most of the "free" websites are illegal because the Music Artists don't get Paid ANYTHING for their copyrighted work. Being a Peer-to-peer (p2p) system, Limewire (among others) have gotten a reputation for also passing viruses.<br>  <br>  With that said:<br>  With Spiralfrog, you do have to "sign-up", but it's free. It is completely safe and virus free. Best of all is that compared to many suggestions of peer-2-peer software that aren't legal and can pass viruses, this is Completely LEGAL and FREE! <br>  <br>  Here it is for you:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.spiralfrog.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.spiralfrog.com</a><br>  <br>  To start off, there are 2 different answers:<br>  1) Free downloads that are legal<br>  2) Free Illegal downloads (limewire,kaza, frostwire, torrents, imesh, youtube, etc),<br>  <br>  I'll deal with #1.<br>  Since the whole issue about downloading music, the music companies and Artists themselves need to earn "income" from their music work. To be fair, they ARE entitled to it. Nobody wants to work for free.<br>  <br>  This is why the (new) Napster, Rhapsody, Walmart, Itunes, emusic, Amazon, Yahoo music, etc exist and charge for their music. Bottom line...If you want legal downloads, you have to "pay" for it.<br>  <br>  HOWEVER, there is another option. "Pay" doesn't have to be money. Spiralfrog.com deals with the whole "Pay" idea as being "Banner Ad" income. The more ads you see the more money they make, and they DO pass the income to the artists/music companies.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, seeing the ads once don't provide a recurring source of income to the company, so they require you to come back to their website to 'renew' your licenses every 30-60 days. Not a real problem since I check them out several times a week.<br>  <br>  Their selection of NEW music is mixed. SOME new albums are released through them at the same time as other sites. MANY may not make it until some time has passed, and others never show up. You have to look around and see if their selection is good for you.<br>  <br>  Oh, 2 things to take note of:<br>  1) You need to have a player that supports .wma files with DRM (Digital Rights Management). This means iPod is NOT supported, but lots of other players (my cellphone even) do work with it.<br>  2) You can't burn to CD to bypass #1<br>  <br>  I use Spiralfrog all the time and love it|`|uUkJx3UDaa	Umm nowhere. It's illegal to have free music. Stars make that music to be paid, not to give it away for free. Limewire doesn't give viruses, you have to be smart about what you get. Try Ares.

DolkCwxIaa	It depends on how your iTunes preferences are set.    If you have been ripping your CDs into .m4a format, then you can't do that.    If you've been ripping CDs into .mp3 format, then you just need to drag the MP3s into Windows Media Player.    Look in iTunes under Edit->Preferences to see what format you've been ripping CDs to.

krAOUctaaa	Your computer might just need a full reboot -    Try manually shutting down your computer. Turn off the CPU, Monitor, and the power bar for 10 minutes. Return to your computer, turn on the power bar, CPU and monitor.   Use a fresh CD. Insert it. Bring up iTunes, and click burn.     Hopefully this will do the trick!  Good luck!|`|AA12180617	it sounds like your burner firmware or driver have become corrupt use windows to reinstall them from the website of the PC /drive maker - this is a issue with windows drivers and not itunes.        you can cover yourself by checking and reinstalling itunes (it does not destroy any content just updates files etc needed to run) from www.apple.com/itunes/download then restart after finishing your CD-R drivers    have you loaded or used a new CD buring program as sometimes these replace the standard CD-R drivers with their own versions that stop windows acessing the burner through anything other than that program.
1yov0JF9aa	they are going cell phone because of the portability and price. land line phones do not offer the same features that a cell phone offers for the price.

When we put our number on the do not call list they stopped calling and we never got phone calls anymore. My mom was the only one to call out from the land line only because she wasn't in a habit of charging her cell phone. To save money we decided to stop paying $40 a month for something we don't use. I know some people who add an extra cell line and keep it at home as the "home phone".

2ae80ff81188ccc128dfeb85edf626a8aa	Warranties only cover product defects; they don't cover theft. Extended warranties are, in the best cases, a little more flexible than manufacturers warranties because they may cover some instances of negligence, but theft or misplacement is usually not covered either. Reread the policy or contract to be sure.<br>  <br>  Some home insurance plans may extend coverage to your property stolen outside of your home. Check with your insurance company for details if you have such a plan.<br>  <br>  Some credit card companies like American Express provide theft insurance for items purchased with its card. If you purchased the camera with a credit card check your benefits or contact the credit card company for information.<br>  <br>  If none of these things apply to you then you're pretty much out of luck. Report the theft to your school and file a police report -- the chances of return are very slim unless you have a good idea of who stole your camera and enough information to prove that it is indeed your camera.|`|i5OVORXgaa	It will only cover it if it's broken, not stolen.
4cMuedpWaa	When that happens, you always need to turn off your phone, wait 5 minutes and then turn it on again.<br>  <br>  If that doesn't work, your wireless carrier is experiencing network problems or your phone is a dud and you need to get another one (they will replace it for free, of course.)
JXc0O8G9aa	If you're really interested in close up/macro photography, I'd definitely recommend looking into a DSLR.  I'm more familiar with Canon because that's what I use but I have no problem with Nikons.  Both make great cameras.    For Canon, I'd recommend checking out an XS/1000D.  This is their cheapest, most basic entry level DSLR.  While it does have less features than the XSi, it's also much cheaper.    When it comes to macro photography, it's all down to the lens.  Normal lenses do not provide the true 1:1 magnification a macro lens dos.  I'd also recommend picking up the Canon 100 mm f/2.8 Macro lens.  You can find one used for around $400.  This lens also doubles as a great portrait lens (even though the length is a bit longer than ideal).    If you're interested in the real thing, that's about as cheap as you're going to get while still having a decent system.  Canon does make a 60 mm macro lens that offers 1:1 magnification, but due to the shorter focal length, you have to be about 4 inches away from your subject to obtain it.  The 100 mm allows you to be around 6 inches away.  This is handy when you're dealing with photographing insects and stuff.|`|AA12180617	As for Image quality the LENS matters more than the MPix, for example if the camera  is 5Mpix but it has a pinhole lens (like 95% of phones)  its NOT the number of MPix that determines image quality its the optics and lens..    The bigger the lens the better the image going to the sensor... a good lens (such as samsung Pixon) with a 3Mpix sensor will always have a better picture than a 5mpix with a pinhole lens,  when you compare images on screen you are comparing screens not images...    Also for the same megapixels differing camers have differing sensors and some give much better pictures than others (currently the race is to give headline megapixels ratehr tha true image quality but that is now changnig to picture mattering more than the number of pixels).     (I suggest you read which camera to get the full info)  but from what I know    Best Buys in order best first:_      Canon EOS 100D  500  Canon EOS  350D 342  Nikon D80  690  Sony Aplpha 700 1100  Panasonic Lumix G1 599  Nikon D50 513  Canon EOS 50D 979  Canon EOS 40D 960  Panasonic Lumix L10 649      So Canon and Panasonic get the best write ups (the sony rates highly for ease of use and flash but average for pictures) the Sony 10.2Mpix camera is obsolete now replaced by the 12.2mPix one hence the reduction to clear out dead stock!|`|paAG8bH5aa	I suggest that you go for the Nikon D60. You can read all you need to know about it here:    http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/specs/Ni...    As for buying, Amazon is always a good choice:    http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0013...
josOoA32aa	I think the only way to get tunes onto your 360 is through CD. You can't copy files from a USB device, flash drive, external hard drive, MP3 player, etc. Can't you just download all the music you've purchased on your PC when you sign into the Marketplace on your 360? I know that with iTunes, when you purchase something, you can download it up to 5 times or something like that; as long as you sign in with your account, you can re-download something or download it on another device or computer.    If not, you could probably just stream the music from your PC to your 360. They have multiple forums online that show you exactly how to do this. Given you have a wireless router and a wireless USB adapter for your 360, this can be achieved no problem.    Good luck.|`|4BeSKxdIaa	I think you have to use a cd. Just buy blank ones and burn them from your computer. I don't believe you can sync music from your ipod, just listen.|`|1WgOj89kaa	Just use a USB Cable

xwSNEYICaa	My kids, who are 6 and 7 (but were 4 and 5 when we got the Wii) love Mario Party, Raving Rabbids (the first one), both of which we have had since they first came out and have been replayed many times..  Animal Crossing would be another one that gets played a lot.  Other games mentioned, like Wii Fit or My Sims have their limitations, in my opinion. We have both, and have also had them since they came out.  Wii Fit has limited game choices, my kids get frustrated at the Yoga and Strength Training.  My Sims is good, but it does have some manipulating of small parts, which can be frustrating for younger kids.      If you want a game that your kids can play together, like the other games you mention that you have, I would suggest Mario Party.  It's not educational, but it is fun.      Big Brain Academy is educational, and can be played by younger kids, but may get frustrating for smaller children who do not understand the concept of the mini-games.      Hope this helps!|`|0m7kEIDiaa	Ours LOVE paper mario!!!   My three year old plays it as well as my teenagers!

BMConIedaa	Using the composite AV cables that came with the Wii, the best picture quality available is 480i (Standard-definition TV).  The Wii is capable of 480p, but requires component cables to achieve that.    Interlaced signals display half the lines, every other frame.  Half the image gets drawn, and your brain fills in the gaps.    Prog-scan signals draw every line every frame.  This requires more bandwidth than composite AV cables can provide.    I use component cables with my Wii and HDTV, and the picture quality, I think, is very noticeable over the composite cables.    A HD receiver will either use component cables (most likely), or HDMI cables, if it outputs an HD signal.    If you are running out of component-in jacks on your TV, consider buying a video switch.  I use a matrix switch I bought off ebay that has 4 component-in jacks, and 2 component-outs, so if I were to ever, say... buy a projector, I could hook that up, and play my Wii on my TV, and watch a movie on the projector, or vice versa.  That one cost about $100, but simpler switches with just one output are considerably cheaper - just make sure that it's a powered switch, as switches that don't have their own power supply can degrade video quality.|`|MBiAm9zaaa	It probably will improve the video quality, depending on what kind of cables you have now. Since the wii doesn't support any type of digital output, the quality of the cable definitely has an impact on the picture quality.|`|VlP7ESH1aa	kind of. i have a high-def tv thingy and it makes the images a little bit clearer. i was suprised that it actually did improve the image quality.|`|qaPyaFUcaa	The wii only supports 480p through the high-def cables, so it's really not HD, but ED.  The picture will be slightly better, slightly noticable, but not HD.  I think they are only like $15 so it's probably worth it.      When you get your HD satellite receiver, it should come with cables so you don't have to worry about getting any for it.|`|LSXdwRDUaa	You mean the green red or whatever they are. yes i think it will improve. But if your talking about HDMI cable no it wont work since the wii dont have any hdmi slot.|`|cHkcZLe6aa	If you buy the cables, make sure you go into your Wii settings and change the screen resolution to 480p or you probably won't notice any difference at all.    Without the component cables, the 480p option is greyed out and 480i is the only choice. Component cables will allow you select the higher resolution option but it won't switch automatically.

09Z8HXjAaa	The glyde is not the best phone that Verizon has to offer. If you want a reliable phone that you will never have issues with, I suggest you DO NOT get the Glyde. I work for Verizon in the call center where i handle questions like these on a daily basis, and i do not recommend this phone.I understand we don't have another phone designed like this, but in this phones case looks can be decieving and another phone would be a better option. The Voyager is a great phone, I own one and have had it for about a year, I have had NO problems with it and have YET to get it replaced.<br>  <br>  If you decide to get the Glyde, you do have 30 days to try it out to see if you like it, if you don't you can always return it or exchange it, but keep in mind, if you do exchange it there is a $35 restocking fee, so make a good choice :)|`|77NzfiVkaa	I don't know but I can tell you that if the Glyde doesn't work out, the Voyager actually is very similar.

Any powdery build-up should be treated as crystallized acid and cleaned with proper hand and eye protection, although gloves and not cleaning too vigorously will get you through in most situations. <br>  If any acid gets into your eyes and mucous membranes (yes, that includes your nose), immediately get the affected body part under the faucet and turn it on to flush away the acid! <br>  Using the baking soda will create water and salt. Either of those can cause a short circuit if left in the battery compartment or if it leaks in. Be sure to dry the device thoroughly. Do not immerse it unless you can detach the battery case entirely from the rest of the device. If any of the baking soda/vinegar mixture gets into the device, you're probably best off opening the device and cleaning it off, or taking the device to a professional. <br>  As with anything involving monkeying around delicate circuitry with water, acids, and bases, this may cause damage to the device. But with careful cleaning and proper caution, the risk is fairly low.

Verizon uses the CDMA network and when you go to another country, you can easily get it unlocked, slip in another carrier's sim card, and avoid roaming charges.

I have recieved 1 too many calls about people coming from a regular phone like our KRZR and jumping into a Blackberry and it is too hard for them to get used to. Only get a BlackBerry if you can handle it (Blackberry's and PDA smart phone require a 29.99 data feature or higher, that will bill monthly). The storm is great but you want to text alot, i would look into the enV2, that is a great phone, i actually think it is cute. If you are hard on phones, of course the phone is going to break, i bought this phone for my sister about 6 months ago and she has had NO problems. The Voyager is great as well, you get a full QWERTY keyboard and a virtual keyboard, the best of both worlds. It really depends on which phone YOU like, not what we recommend.

BMConIedaa	When you start a Gamecube game in a Wii, the Wii goes into a "Gamecube mode."  All Wii-specific features are turned off.  No access to the Wii System memory, so you will need a GameCube memory card to save your progress and high scores.  No Bluetooth, so no using Wii Remotes.  No Wifi, so you can't go online, not that there were that many online Gamecube games.    To play gamecube games on the Wii, you will need a Gamecube controller.  There is no getting around it.  Used wired GC controllers can be found for US$5 to 10, wireless Wavebirds are a little harder to come by cheap.  Used GC memory cards should also be under $10.|`|AA11045021	If it's a Gamecube game then you can ONLY use a Gamecube controller since that's the only thing the disc will recognize. All Gamecube games have to be played with a Gamecube controller. And make sure you have a Gamecube memory card too.

VPnCk2Muaa	I can't answer your question, but I'll tell you have to fix any RROD once it's out of warranty.     First, look at the hole on the back of your console (between the AV cords and the power cable)(These are the fans). Find two screwdrivers or sticks that will fit those holes. Put those screwdrivers into the holes on opposite sides, at least half an inch away from any sides to jam the fans (make sure your console is off). After inserting them, turn on your console. Without the fans running, the console should make almost no noise at all. At first, the RROD will come on and the screen will show what error, and where to contact Xbox support as usual. Leave the Xbox alone and wait until two lights come on. This means that it has overheated. Immediately unplug everything, take the screwdrivers out, and then plug everything back in. Turn on your console and everything will work fine.

z4vAUR86aa	You can do this with StashSpace a tape to dvd video conversion service. They specialize in home movie conversions and did a great job with all of my VHS and VHS-C tapes.    What you do is mail them the tapes and they will convert them to digital for you. It costs $7 per tape for the video transfer but they are running a promotion right now where the conversion is free if you get a premium account ($100 for a year of video storage).     You can get DVDs back right away or you can use their online application to view your stuff, share online, and edit to create custom DVDs. Works great for combining footage from multiple tapes and creating themed movies like "Birthday Parties". DVDs are $15 and burned by them.|`|e88d2d2d98ed34d4a785a69b0406b4acaa	I think the easiest way would be to hire a service to do the transition. I have heard of services that you mail your old tapes to, and they return them along with the new dvd's. Possibly a local place would do this for you. Start with a good photo shop in your area and start asking questions.    Hope that helps!|`|3e354ee85999a7bc21252e59e538dc35aa	Are they VHS tapes you want to turn to DVD?|`|15c03bf06cee5a4061edb3180eff2867aa	Can do intial inquiry...  http://www.finalvideoproduction.com/

j1cyoB2gaa	The voyager is way too BIG!!!!!!!!! I got one in November & I hated it. It did not fit in any of my jeans pockets. All the cases with clips are huge & ugly so that wasn't an option for me ( i looked at a few stores). I just kept in in my purse or a hoodie pocket. I also really didn't like the touch screen, but thats just me. I hate having to hit unlock, then hit the phone icon, just to bring up the keypad to be able to dial. I just want to dial & talk. Also I had a problem with the voyager turning off at night while it was on the charger. That might not bother u, but I was missing texts (my boyfriend works graveyards) and I use my phone for my alarm clock, so I overslept a few times. I read a lot before I got the voyager & I really wished someone would have mentioned the size. I also read the same thing about the voyager touch screen being better than the glydes touchscreen, but personally I want buttons.( I couldn't text by feel anymore, I had to look to make sure I was touchin the right key) I had an LG ENV before & I am using it again for right now. It only looks a little smaller, but i definatly can tell the difference. Also...I have a very close friend that works at verizon & he was really recommending the dare, but I wanted to have a keypad & touchscreen so I went with the voyager. Good luck|`|AA10116320	okay, DO NOT get the the samsung glyde. I swear that phone is hunted and controls itself. i couldn't even control my phone for a day in a half@ NO joke man, i had the phone since november, and even when i restarted it, it would continue to do the same problem. So just last thursday, January 29th, 2009, i went to my verizon store and spoke to customer service, and they couldn't even control my phone, so they gave me a new one luckily! Now with my new samsung glyde, i haven't had any problems with it so far.     And i found someone who has a voyager that wants to trade it with someone who has the glyde. So, i am going to switch with them.     I like the voyager better because it is responsive and i dont care how big it is. i want my screen to respond! thats all!      BUT OVERALL, i love my samsung glyde... I would even love it more if i didn't have the touch screen problems that would stress me out especially when i am txting and the screen decides to move up in the middle of my txt. Than i cannot understand what i was trying to say cuz random words are all over the place.    This is why i would go with the voyager. You should not have any issues. I assume that half of the glyde's that are produced have this problem with the screen not responding or controlling itself. I am just glad that my new samsyg glyde is perfect and not controlling itself.  To be on the safe side, go with the voyager! thats what i am getting soon once i trade it with someone else.|`|SNllynBiaa	They are both about the same. I have the LG Dare and love it. Check that one out, it is like the other two you are looking at.|`|EpqSDAGyaa	I recently worked for Verzion. The better phone is the Voayger. People had lots of trouble with the gylde! The voayger has the touch screen and also a full keybroad on the inside so its not all touch sceen all the time. I never got any complaints about them ! But the voyager is big, I mean I don't mind it! The dare is coo if you like touch scren all the time, But when you txts it could be kinda of annoying!|`|61HzQ56Qaa	id go with the samsung  glyd i have a samsung fone and its awesome so yeah|`|rDoS2jsNaa	I just got the Voyager and so far its a cool phone. I wanted to get the Dare, but i cant have a touch screen phone without a keyboard because it takes a while to text and get used to if you're big on texing a lot. I wanted the Dare but it would have cost me more than the Voyager. I wouldnt recommend the Glyde because the representative in the store told me that a lot people are unhappy with that phone and plus it's too little. So i would definitely recommend the Voyager and yes it is a little thicker than other touch screen phones, but heck what you expect if it has a full qwerty keyboard with it.|`|p6viL2Bmaa	I had/have both the Glyde and the Voyager.  In my opinion, the Voyager is the better phone.  I originally had the Glyde.  After a couple weeks of having it the screen started to mess up.  I couldn't type or press anything on the screen because it would click other buttons or not respond to my touch at all.  I brought it to Verizon and they gave me a new one.  That one did the same thing. So I traded it in for the Voyager.  Its a bigger phone, but its very comfortable to hold when typing or talking on it.  The screen is very responsive, and they keys are bigger and easier to type on than the Glyde.  So if you text a lot, the Voyager is the one to go with.  I would pick the Voyager over the Glyde.
MIX64TfMaa	try blowing on it if it still does not work it's most likely broken!!!
TwIK4Ivlaa	Every Nikon DSLR (except D40, D40X and D60) is comparable to this model.     The features missing in the listed models (D40, D40X, D60) are autofocus capability with many lenses and lack of depth of field preview button and the top LCD. Apart from these three DSLR models, all the other models have everything that 8008 had.

F5VdwFn1aa	Seems pretty good so far but are those all the chords your practising? Why not try some other riffs like Back in Black or even Eye of the Tiger? :P Just keep practising with the chords and you'll eventually transition C to A with no effort. Good luck. ;)|`|2WcPeJljaa	great! keep up the good work!|`|PJ0aI0Dtaa	the key is PRACTISE.  seriously i had a really hard time with chords.  but without even noticing i got the hang of it.  your fingers are going to hurt, but you gotta bare the pain.    good luck   ++ never ever give up! you'll get it soon .
OR0xrlfiaa	Well For one, is the ipod plugged in? If so, then check and make sure no part of the usb cord is lose on both ends, and is fully connected to both the ipod and computer. <br>  If it still doesn't pop up, then make sure you have the latest version of itunes , if you dont, then that may be the problem. Go to their website, and get the latest version.<br>  And if it still doesn't work, theh you will have to go to the "drivers" section on your computer and look for your ipod, and if it doesnt show up  under usb, then your drivers may need to be updated.|`|ijeninncaa	Make sure your iPod is plugged in then open iTunes. <br>  <br>  On the left hand side, there will be a little arrow next to the 'devices' tab. Click the arrow and and it should show up with you iPod, music, music, TV shows etc. <br>  <br>  Good luck x

Sorry.|`|1QCMJZKzaa	take it back, or get a new tv hahah|`|MnmNl6Hiaa	give it to me and buy your self a new one|`|0wTOMifKaa	Has it ever worked?  If so did it have a red light then?  Quite a lot have a green light and it's red when it's in standby.  You aren't actually just turning it back on into standby and need to use a remote or something to turn it on to a channel?<br>  <br>  Also what have you plugged into it?  Is that in standby mode?
qWicVoU9aa	There are no truly free sites as cell phone records are NOT public records. To get the information requires that records searches be performed by a legitimate agency and they DO charge for this. You will find all kinds of sites that claim to be "free" but all you will get for free is the city and state. I have tried my personal cell phone number in many of these sites and they do not give correct info even at that. They usually come back and tell me that it is a landline number, which I know it is not|`|SBjV8GlFaa	I rang this number, and a man answered. But I hung up. This is a croatian T-Mobile number.|`|hR4Dfa4Taa	Hey i dont know
