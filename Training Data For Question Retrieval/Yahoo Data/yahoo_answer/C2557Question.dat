20090220072821AAUf83p	Cars & Transportation;Buying & Selling	Who is the best car company?	My knowledge on cars are minimal at best, so I figure instead of looking for a random car out of a million, I would first pick the maker of the car and go from there.

It sounds like a door opening that creeks because the hinges need to be oiled.  Someone told me it might be the ball joints, but when I had that inspected, I was told the ball joints were fine. If anyone has any idea of what this could be please let me know.      Thanks!

20090220075429AAmkfpV	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Why does my 2005 GMC Canyon Vibrate at 40mgh and Highway Speeds?	Hello,   I have had my 2005 GMC Canyon for about 3 years. About 6 months ago it started to vibrate through the entire vehicle, not just through the steering wheel, it does it at 40mph, and at highway speeds, getting worse at 70mph. Then its WORSE when you let off the accelerator to coast or decelerate to 60mph. Its not getting worse, its just the same as it was when it started. Also, the vibration doesn't go away when you are at 60-70mph and you put the car in Neutral, the vibration is still there. When there is a full tank of gas or weight in the back of my truck the vibration is better. Help! I LOVE my truck. More info its a 4 wheel drive Z71 with 5 cylinders. Oh and we have replaced the furthest rear u-joint too thinking that was the vibration problem and it did not fix the vibration problem, it fixed the squeaking problem, but not the vibration problem.

20090220081015AAXpGur	Cars & Transportation;Other - Cars & Transportation	Can anyone help me find my stolen camaro in D.C.!?!?!?!?!!?	Ok, listen close because it gets a little tricky. I bought an 85 camaro about a month ago from someone in Maryland. I'm originally from Jersey, so I could not actually drive the car until I transferred my license to D.C. where I now live. I've been having a little trouble getting my license mess cleared up, so I decided to park the car outside of my niece's apartment until I took care of things. Every week or so I would go to check up on the car and make little repairs in the mean time. This went on for about a month or so. In between my last two visits the car had been taken. I had not been able to put tags on it during the time it sat, but I still do have the title. Anyway, weeks go by and I get a call saying that my car popped back up briefly in the same spot it had disappeared from. Crazy, right?! What's more crazy is that when it popped back up it had Maryland tags on it. I reported the car stolen, but I'm not sure how they'll find the car with only the vin number, because my niece wasn't able to get the tag number for me. So, where do I go from here? Would the maryland dmv be able to help me? How did they register my car if I still have the title? Heeeeeeeeelllllp!!!!!

20090220081408AAzR4lS	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	99 Corolla wont start. Battery Fine, Alternator fine. Car won't start...?	Hello All,      I have a 99 corolla, and for some reason it won't start.  I live in the windy city; and due to harsh, winter cold, and severe corrosion on my (+)terminal; i would have trouble starting my car.  I would play around with the terminal a little bit, and with effort, the car would eventually start.  This wasn't a severe issue, as I could get the car running.  The issue began when I decided to change the terminal and a headlight lamp.  Both of them had burnt out, so I replaced them; while doing so, I tackled the (+) terminal.  Once all the work was complete, I hopped in the car to turn it on.  Put the key in the ignition, turned the key...nothing.  Now, the lights came on, the radio came on, and the interior "key in ignition, door open" chime came on; but as sooned as i tried to engage the ignition switch, everything cut off.     If I jump the car, the ignition will work; and everything will start. Also, I can drive around indefinitely with the car in it's present state; I do however notice that the lights flicker a little bit when I roll down a window or mess with the heater; but they don't drain (as does with a bad alternator...).  I took the battery to get tested @ a Pep Boys and an Autozone, where I was told @ both of them that the battery had no problem.  I did a test where I took off the (-) terminal while the battery was running to test the alternator, and it continued to run (until I put some stress on the battery by rolling down all the windows @ the same time and blasting the heat and radio...)   I don't want to spend unneccesary money on repairs or parts, so I am asking this forum for any advice it can provide on this matter.  Any feedback is greatly appreciated.  I figure eventually, I may need to bite it and spend (maybe unneccesary) cash to get to the bottom of the problem; but until then, I'm open to suggestions...

20090220092744AAjh43y	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Too much pressure in coolant system, even before heating up.?	I have an '89 Audi 200 Quattro that is building up too much pressure in the coolant right after startup.      So much to the point that it is blowing out the relief valve on the radiator cap pretty much right when you start to accellerate moderately. So much that I have to add coolant every 60 miles or so.      I have not noticed anything resembling water in the oil, nor oil in the coolant. No white or blue smoke at all.         I should mention:      Replaced the water pump, the pump we replaced it with had narrower teeth than the rest of the gears on the timing belt.      I replaced the radiator cap, still has same problem.      There is no thermostat installed, which I found out 5 minutes ago while attempting to see if the thermostat is seized.       It is running straight water in the cooling system now, because I am not made of money.       The turbo was modified by a previous owner.      Does not seem to have lost any power, but runs rough sometimes.         Any ideas?

I recently asked the question about the oil pressure gauge on my 96 Shilloutte van steadily dropping closer into the red.  I took the advice and took it in for an oil change, engine flush and had both filters changed, the oil and air.  The gauge has since gone into the red and the ride isn't as smooth as before,  I checked the oil and trans fluid and both were fine.  I don't understand and I'm at my wits end trying to figure this out and spending more and more money.  Like I stated before I'm a single mom of 5 chilren and I NEED HELP!!!!  PLEASE ADVISE!!!!!!

Ok, so I was making a left turn at an intersection and I was HIT by another car coming in the opposite direction on the passenger side of my car! First off, the other car was nowhere in the vicinity of the intersection when I decided to make my turn ( at glance, she was far enough away from the intersection to where i could make a clean turn). When I did make the turn, my friend screamed as we where milliseconds clear of the intersection, and thats when i noticed that the other car was speeding and didnt stop as she rammed into the middle of my car. She knocked me into the left lane of the street i was turning onto and really did a number on my car. Was I at fault? And if so, how far off does a car going in the opposite direction have to be before you can make a left turn???

The Nissan has the Supercharged V6, leather, sunroof and the works. It seems like a really sporty truck. An 01 to 03'   The other is an 01 to 03 Toyota Tacoma. This seems more of a sturdy truck and very reliable. Just plain cloth interior, more roomy inside and seems to be all around better built.      My plan with the truck is to drive it daily and starting soon, using it for my new part-time lawn care company this fall. Both have big beds and the V6 and extended/quad cabs. The Nissan has more power, nicer interior and drives pretty nice. The Toyota is bigger, both inside and outside.   I've owned both Nissan and Toyotas so I know both will get over 200k miles.
