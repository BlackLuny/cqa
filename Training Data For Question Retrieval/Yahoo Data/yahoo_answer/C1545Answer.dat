I have problems too but weed gets me through.|`|GPznIhzMaa	Speak to your landlord or building management and explain to them your situation. Same advice for your bills. Try to set up payment plans with everyone and let them know you're trying to get back on your feet. Everyone knows that times are tough right now. Continue looking for work and take temp jobs to stay afloat. I doubt that you have no friends. Talk to people- it'll help you stay sane even if they're unable to help you out financially.

p8Mc6rpBaa	LOL! Well really that's what underwear is for isn't? Seriously if they were stained beyond normal skid marks I'd throw them away and by her some new ones. This usually doesn't happen with women. Typically if a woman soils herself that badly those panties would never make it to the hamper. However there are exceptions.       The over-sized skid mark in the underwear is usually a guy thing.  Guy have no shame about passing gas. Sometimes those farts can be a little wetter than normal. Unless a guy poops his pants he may not realize he has a little something extra in his draws until he takes them off or takes a dump. Guys don't see the purpose of throwing away a perfectly good and comfortable pair of underwear when they can be washed and stains can be SHOUTed out..      I've got to give you a star for this question...It brought a smile to me face..|`|4a43ce24fc25ee210c17b8882b616386aa	LMAO this is so random Faith. Not in front of everyone in the laundromat but we would have to have a little talk later. But so far that hasn't happen lol.    But seriously Idk what I would really do because that's pretty embarassing I mean I'm sure he knows how to whip and clean himself....so what am I suppose to tell him lol.    Faith did this happened with your man?|`|ry2XcFm6aa	that'll scar me for life...but..I'd clean it for her lol and be like nothing happened lol..    edit:....that shis nasty by the way....|`|3cLA6wCWaa	Great question.    Well, "poot" implies fart so if my partner is staining her panties with a fart, she needs to kick back on the fiber and dairy product. That's no. 1.    No. 2, Knowing me, I'd front her off right then and there because I have priors for being inconsiderate.     No. 3, Faith cracks me up with her questions yet she is so innocent hahahahahaha      EDIT: hi there! My bad, I was at the laundromat :p|`|UhtSE2B6aa	I'm giving away our secrets, but now do you see why men wear dark colored boxers?    edit: LMAO @ Karameli...be careful what you wish for, lol!|`|tEsIu7FIaa	Throw them away, buy some fresh ones, then ask what their problem is. That is nasty.|`|YSr8dm5faa	Can I say *eww*? lol I'll probably end up throwing it away. If he asks where they are, I'll ask him why he still poops his pants at age 27.|`|UnG3dS7xaa	I would do the "ewwww" grimace and shudder, then take that info to the grave.    I got one for you. What do you do if you get very drunk, pass out at your partners place, then wake up in the middle of the night to find that you've crapped the bed in your drunken stupor. Do you-    A- Wake them up and confess what happened.    B. Try to clean it up and hope your equally drunk partner won't wake up.    C. Take a scoop of your own excrement, wipe it on your partners backside and roll them over. You then leave discreetly, blame it on them the next day, and dump them.|`|c9b39ba1619a86eb939cf1b78c3d4a15aa	lol yall got me crackin up, well i would sneak them to the trash the first time and if i saw this again i would get my hunny some wetones and mention he's been having skidd marks in his undies and tell him to be sure to use his wet ones and clean his booty thoroughly. & if we live together i would try to talk him into getting a bidet :-)    I dont have to worry about this happening cause my baby is a personal hygeine freak.    ok skidd marks are NOT NORMAL for adults!!!!  Wipe yo ***, Wash ya self!    Ogun, choc, you guys make me afraid, im going to buy my man some white boxers and investigate this! lol|`|daaf98fda077fbcf980e059669c29f08aa	Well we call those "skid marks",  and it can be from a person not washing themselves properly  after they're done pooping; therefore leaving the "remainder"  in their drawers.  If it's from "sharting", (poop squeaking out with a fart), a  change in diet may be called for.  I taught my sons how to properly wash themselves after  going potty and we never had any drawers around our  house with skid marks.  Depends on how close your friend is. You could ask:  "I couldn't help noticing you had an accident there, have  you been sick or something?"|`|AA11556445	Bacon strips.

Now we are comfortable and in retirement.  Poppy|`|XEbrGfZuaa	Yes, I know we are. This month, we ran out of money in a little more  than two weeks. Last month, we were able to reach the end, but just  barely. I don't know where the same amount went this month. We  didn't even go out for fast food. I think after rent, the majority of it goes  to the grocery store. And we're not even eating all that great either.  We stay home most of the time, to minimize gas. We don't rent  movies. And I don't see how we can make anymore cut backs.    So even though the stimulus checks are probably going to cost us  later, I know we sure can use that money and we'll put it to good use.  You are lucky to be in Arizona now. We saw our food dollars stretch  alot farther down there for so many things. Especially produce and  meat. But you're probably getting produce from Yuma now, so it  doesn't cost as much to bring in as it did from Mexico. In the NW  meat costs more, as well as produce since it has to be brought  further. All in all, your cost of living is cheaper. But you've got the  heat ahead to contend with, that we don't up north to consider also.|`|ozwLZwXeaa	I am so sick of the politicians being so greedy and doing illegal things all the time. I have actually thought of moving to another country except my six kids, 13 grand children and 5 great grand babies are within 40 miles of me. Don't know if I could leave them behind.        I have heard that we get no stimulus check at all this time.  Have you heard differently?  I live on SS of just $395 a month and things are bad.|`|831e735ba92bb0dfd3b16be0d4995ccfaa	We don't drink, gamble or run around, we live a very sedentary life in order to eat right and live comfortably. My wife complains but, the last time we went to a movie it cost us $34.00 and that's two or three days o groceries for us. Fortunately we have a nice boat and go Salmon and Walleye fishing all the time, it supplements or food supply we both love fish and eat it three to four times a day in different ways but now, with the gas crunch, we can't even do that.           The only ends that are meeting our on our belts, from tightening them.|`|G4vFjh0yaa	It is a challenge some days. I have learned to live in the moment and to appreciate all I do have. As I see what is happening to other hard working Americans I am ever thankful for what we do have and how we are able to make it. We definitely had many cutbacks in all of the things we spend money on. It has been a good eye opener as well.|`|8yE2sYGeaa	There are days that I want to move out of my current state to a place with lower overhead, but I have too much invested|`|8e7a94a0af2d078a41f902e73bf91f17aa	Glad for your fiscal improvement.  Best to ya.       As for me, does no constructive good to get fed-up about it.  Already have done everything possible, and determined to weather it with every monthly measure taken into best use and conservation.|`|ur3vgbXoaa	Yes, but I thank goodness that at   least we know how to cook a meal   instead of having to go to the   drive-thru and pay big bucks for   all the meals like people today   have to do.      It seems like the general idea   of a home cooked meal is   something you buy at the store   in a box and take home and   put in the oven.       If people would learn to use   a stove and a crock pot or   even a barbecue grill, they would   be able to make their ends   meet with a lot less trouble.|`|0aJlEmIxaa	I'm still working, so it isn't so bad.  But my pension fund dropped 50% this past year.  I don't think about retiring any more, even though I am past the age when I could.    What casinos offer is a form of hope.  And that is a precious commodity in desperate times.  If you do go to the casinos, do a reality check.  Keep track of what you bring in and what you take with you when you leave.       Hang in there.|`|KBxz1Wfyaa	So many great answers here.  We get fed up as well but at least I'm still working and count blessings for that.  Every time I go to the grocery store it seems like I spin that big Wheel of Fortune to see what I can buy and what I'll walk on by.  This month my youngest got Strep Throat and I had to take her to Immediate Care.  The 137.00 used up the rest of the discretionary money we had for January and it was just the 19th.    I for one am not pleased with the stimulus package put forth.  Obama wanted both aisles to come together and the Dem's are up to their old tricks.  That's not to say the Rep's are any different.  Until everyone in America holds all of these jerks responsible for their stupid decisions not much will change.  It will be the same old same old with all of us left holding the bag.|`|9YwZL1Jhaa	You all made good valid points.We live a very humble life as well. No frills just day to day living. We have no health insurance right now which scares me to death.My husband lost his job last week. My 78 yr. old dad still woks and  he drives an 18 wheeler just to have extra insurance on himself  and mom because it pays for a lot of his meds. I went to N C in August for almost 4 months and let me tell you I don't want to think of moving to another state.I missed the rest of the family terribly.I make sure I have life insurance on my husband because if I lost him I would be screwed.Isn't that pathetic.I don't see us getting another check from Uncle Sam either.I give up I just don't know anymore.We hang in there and pray for the best. I wish we seniors could unite and march on D C.|`|bd071971ac36c92a5d8fe8733f388859aa	Yes, it is scary. I have the heat on 50 in all rooms except the one I am in and that is on 62 and I bundle up. One of the biggest expenses is health insurance as I am 9 months away from 65. Maybe it will be better for me then if there is anything left over after all the bailouts. I get so angry about the Health Insurance Industry. Insurance is a gambling industry. You pay for years and years and then when you finally use it they pay pennies in proportion to what you have paid them.|`|PXWVGQyAaa	I can deal with it as we are a low maintenance family and have learned to live within our means which is a bit challenging with a 14 yr old girl that loves shopping for clothes.  What I am sick of is shovelling snow. I see it has started again here in southern Ont.   My mom used to live in Bisbee before she died and my husband and I were lucky enough to visit a few times. We loved it there, especially the cactus gardens and the mountains.

(not eskimo, i just learned yesterday that word is derogitory)  Eh: No we dont all think you all say Eh, but we do know that it is more common in Canada.  History: Come to think of it, ive never learned anything about Canadians in specific in history class. Hmm it seems like all our emphasis in that class is on making europe look bad. Just my point of view.      P.S. If you are canadian, why is your name Aussie Boi?    Edit----  Okay so i already undestood the gender part, just not the "country on the opposite side of the world" nickname lol|`|dIUvXolnaa	No, I don't believe that Canadians live in igloos. The same people who believe that are the same ones who believe that people In Hawaii live in grass shacks.  No. I have spoken to many Canadian tourists who come to Hawaii, none of them said "eh"  No we don't learn Canadian history. But we don't learn much other countries of the world either. Unless we study on our own or in college.   Do you know the history of Hawaii??? Probably not. Neither do most Americans. Yes, the education system here is lacking. However I don't believe it to be retarded. Our teachers are overworked and underpaid. Some have to worry about violence.Schools lack textbooks and other supplies.|`|AA10948829	No. No. Yes.|`|AQPmrsVSaa	Yes, some people do think silly things like that.

Many of us DO think that you say "eh?" though.... and yes, it is true that we do not learn about Canadian history... at... ALL... The United States is a very selfish country in that, many of us tend to think that the world revolves around us.. literally. So they don't take the time to educate us about other countries... so, in turn, most Americans don't care what goes on in other countries the way that they care what goes on with us.|`|2bD0qiD3aa	What?

AA10248239	n general, Muslims are supposed to avoid eye contact with members of the opposite gender who are not close relatives. It's not forbidden, but it's a matter of good manners. Most people who are aware of this make eye contact briefly and then look away.    When I was a new Muslim, this seemed strange to me, until I understood the culture better.|`|IbtQ5IKNaa	Everyone on earth does characteristics the same and different doesn't matter if they are Muslim or Arabs or whatever. That's just labels that you consume.|`|Izn1ye9Raa	I'm an American Muslim. I don't look strange men or strange women in the eyes. I generally keep my head down and stick close to my husband (unless I'm looking for something and then I go look for it).  I keep my gaze on the floor when I'm around non mahram men and women.|`|91e9083de3605be8e58e4cb70855e350aa	I am American Muslim and ..well i look people in the eye when meeting the because i believe its polite and respectful..this belief has stemmed from my American culture..although Islam does teach members of the opposite sex to lower their gaze..I usually try to follow that with my fellow muslims because lowering the gaze is obviously understood as being modest..but to the general American public( i mean specifically non muslim) it would seem rude..so I do adjust but I still remain modest and loyal to my beliefs.I only stated my American culture and Islamic principles..but I am not sure of how Arab culture generally behaves pertaining to eye contact=)    But yes..I do try to lower my gaze around members of the opposite sex who are not family..I'm am just generally modest anyways..because its Ismaically appropiate. I do not make a habit of staring at the male in the face..just a glance that shows i am listening to what they're saying|`|R9PTWrXCaa	Asalam Alaykum,     I DO if its a woman. But I do not even talk to men thats not-mahram (husband, son, brother, father in law, uncle). If it is them, I do of course that would be rude.|`|1rX7HB8Qaa	yes, but with a polite smile....I know Islam asks us to lower our gaze....at present time if i do that for someone of the opposite sex they will think i am shy and in love with them. also lowering gaze would make them feel that I am looking at their d*ck! see, it sends wrong signal now since society norm has changed.|`|CwqW45Rmaa	Yo, what happened to my answer?....      Not cool!|`|kjUqJLyKaa	let me clear some things up for ya. ok so islam does teach to lower your gaze when talking to the opposite gender. but not in a way that many people understand it. it means: do not look them in the eyes like the whole converstaion. like kinda shift your gaze from time to time. but not look at the floor the whole time. thats just wierd. islam doesnt teach to look at the floor. just not straight in the eyes like the whole tiem.

(Well, other than group sex--gotta give them credit for that whole polygamy thing!)|`|AA10789216	I'm LDS and I went on a mission to Japan.  We visited a lot of houses where people were smoking while we talked to them.  Don't worry about it.  I mean, like most people, they don't like to breathe smoke, but I'm guessing they'll also be understanding.  I think we all know that quitting tobacco can be more difficult than quitting hard drugs.      See Mark 2, verses 15-17.|`|ASSbLOk6aa	They are there to  'save' you.. so that includes saving your from the smoke of evil... so they will find it invigorating to have a challenging assignment.|`|qjquVj0daa	I really do not think they will care too much about it. They are there to talk to you about religion. Sounds like your parents are supportive, so maybe ask them not to smoke in the house one morning or confine to a certain part of the house for that morning. Air out the house and use air freshener, Clean. Will not eliminate smoke smell but will take the edge off.|`|7539ec184c5979d90293e53cc6ea20fcaa	My husband let some Mormons come into our home while he was drinking a beer. I was so embarrassed. They just happened to knock on our door. It wasn't by request. Usually my husband would not invite missionaries into our home. I was so shocked. We had prayer and everything. My husband even invited them back and gave them our phone number. When they started calling and coming by, he no longer wanted to be bothered with them.|`|0qhRIKpSaa	They would be fine with teaching you outside, but the smoking really wouldn't bother them. I was a missionary and we went into smokers homes all the time. It's part of the job. Don't be embarrassed.|`|AA11174255	They won't care, I assure you.  Yes, just tell them that is why you'd prefer to speak outside.  And please, I hope the "Morons" comment was merely a typo.    Thanks.|`|AM7CgQ4daa	If you don't feel comfortable for them to come to your house, could you meet them at their church or hall?|`|e871c3bc7828a54588e8b88635cfba63aa	As long as nobody smokes in their presence, they probably won't mind, but you can ask them if they'd rather talk inside or outside.|`|AA12317147	Mormon - without the second 'm' in your question is not intended. Is it?    For that matter, your parents could be doing drugs or smoking marijuana in front of them and they will still talk to you.    Don't worry about it. You are sensitive and I can understand.|`|d4bd8b0d4b217939ff505d70042c7c38aa	They won't mind, but trust me, unless you can give up smoking (if it is you who is the smoker) then I would suggest you try another cult... or how about a TRUE Christian religion instead?      Have a polite day.|`|87VSGYMDaa	They won't mind the smoke.    And no, they are not any more of a cult than any other of the popular religions.  They are some of the nicest people you'll ever meet.  And no, I'm not a Mormon, but I have some friends who are, and they have never pressured me to join them.|`|e1a7697c7943bcffd2fa613b82800630aa	The most pleasing smell to a missionary is tobacco.  They are not there to critize anyone.  When they have the chance to explain why we don't smoke to a smoker, it is going to be even more meaningful.|`|6DmsiLGbaa	It's extremely considerate of you to think of this, but it isn't really a problem.  No, we don't smoke, but the missionaries will not think badly of you simply because your parents do.  If the smell of smoke is that strong, though, you could always just meet elsewhere.  The missionaries will be more than happy to ask a member if you can meet in their home (with the member present or not--whatever makes you comfortable), or you can just meet in the local chapel.  You can also meet outside if it's not too cold.  As long as your meeting place is quiet and conducive to the spirit of God, any place is fine.  Just let the missionaries know that your home isn't the best place, and they'll work something out.

You thought you will get an explanation from black subscribers here or you thought only black people do this? I have news for you: A lot of people I know wash their a$$ and they are not blacks.

The tribal leader lead the war parties, approved marriages,  negotiated truces and alliances with and against other tribes, and when white fellas got down this way, did their GD best to eradicate the bastards.

No        I personally don't see why some people are afraid to state their preference in fear of offending people of their race.  Look you know what you are attracted to and there's nothing wrong with you liking white women.  People in today's generation, many people don't care for race essentially knowing they could experience a connection based on the people they date. I'm biracial myself, Love that my mom was with my dad.|`|tlUihEOvaa	1. I hope not...    2. No, I always see people talk about it.    3. No it's a matter of individual choice.     I think we all should be able to like whoever we want without getting bashed on. I also like girls outside of my race and I hope most people won't care or judge me. If they decide to then who cares anyways as long as they don't get in our way.    Well if you love her for her qualities, character, and etc race shouldn't matter.|`|GqfiRXu3aa	Generally if I do see a black man with a white woman, the woman seems to usually be blonde.  I say, So what?  If the two people like each other and respect each other, that is their own business.     Why would you be shot if you said you like white girls?   Unless you're living in one of the worst inner-city areas in the country, NO...you will not be shot.  People like who they like.      Good luck and try not to worry so much.

8gi5gfOsaa	It is not the sex for pleasure between these creatures the mythic Christian God is concerned with, but the sex between these creatures and these professors of Christianity.

And even though humans use contraceptives, he does not smite us. And he gave us free will so if we sin it our faults, and we'll be judged for it on judgment day.|`|sZ8sB2W2aa	Because in the Bible, it clearly talks about humans being formed in the image of God, thus being superior to animals.    He sets higher standards for humans; they are the ones mentioned in the Bible, and they are the ones mentioned for these restrictions.    That's all there is to it.    In addition, sex is mentioned to be for procreation, in addition to other things, but between a man and a wife.|`|tOLrUh0Caa	I agree with the above answer. If we knew what God thought we would have no unanswered questions in this world. Men have interpreted his word in several different ways and come up with their own meanings, this is evident in the many different denominations of Christianity.|`|dZMHd5PMaa	I don't know what Bible you have been reading but it doesn't say anywhere that you shouldn't use contraceptives nor does it say that it should only be for procreation. It says that sex should be between a married man and woman|`|x6CnkpQkaa	Who told you that?  Because it is not in the bible.|`|xu0R3ojaaa	The Church takes a long view on moral issues and seeks to give answers which will support the common good over centuries and Millennia, not just years or decades. The Pill was opposed because it would encourage a belief that promiscuity could be enjoyed without risk of unwanted pregnancy, and that it would lead to Women putting off pregnancy until their fertile years were gone. The prophylactic contraceptive was opposed for the same reason and for the fact that their use gives a false belief that sex with strangers can be without risk of disease.   If you look at a prophylactic under a microscope you will see that latex has microscopic holes all over the surface - these are too small to allow bacteria to pass through, but readily allow viruses to pass. HIV/AIDS is a virus, and the so-called safe sex is not safe at all.  It is safer than not using a contraceptive, but ultimately will fail to protect users.  In a similar vein the Church opposes invitro fertilisation because it is unnatural and will breed weaknesses into humanity. We have in the last 100 years used technology (Antibiotics and other medical intervention) to breed weak humans and strong diseases.   In the long, long run this is fraught with peril.  We can already see the spread of lethal diseases through risky lifestyle choices, and falling fertility levels with many people unable to breed without third party assistance. Is more of this what those who oppose the teachings of the Church really want?|`|LJ6vHfgoaa	>>thinks sex should only be used for procreation    Geez, even the Catholic Church doesn't teach that.    >>I am basing these conclusions on the teachings of the Catholic Church    Your understanding of the teachings of the Catholic Church is erroneous. Sex for reasons other than procreation is allowed:    "If therefore there are well-grounded reasons for spacing births, arising from the physical or psychological condition of husband or wife, or from external circumstances, THE CHURCH TEACHES THAT MARRIED PEOPLE MAY THEN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE NATURAL CYCLES IMMANENT IN THE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM AND ENGAGE IN MARITAL INTERCOURSE ONLY DURING THOSE TIMES THAT ARE INFERTILE, thus controlling birth in a way which does not in the least offend the moral principles which We have just explained."

We were drunk, it was late, we were in my girlfriend's jacuzzi, we were curious...(Yes we girls often sit in the jacuzzi topless together. happy birthday Ant).     Well long story short, I just think it's interesting to have breasts where the nipples are so pale you can't see them becuase the breasts are pale too.

V4JLwTVyaa	I'd like to think that the Universe, apart from all evidence to the contrary, is actually a fair place and people get what they deserve in the end, regardless of their beliefs and/or excuses and/or last second repenting on the death bed.    And since I can see nothing wrong with anyone saying that they just don't have enough evidence/information/experience to make an informed decision, I can't think of a single reason why being an Agnostic is cause enough to go to Hell.|`|Nf0FLjGhaa	depends on who answers. some say yes, some say no. and every denomination is a bit different, so that'll add even more confusion|`|0sOnf2YQaa	Since you know about the existence of hell,  you know about Jesus Christ who created hell  for Satan and his angels.  Since you are an agnostic, you are not living in   obedience to Jesus Christ as He commanded you to do.  So to answer your question - yes.|`|Io9288c7aa	No. Not "just for being agnostic." But you will end up in Hell because you rejected salvation through faith in Jesus. Unless you repent Now. It is now your choice where you end up and why!|`|wU0c3i7baa	Some of the Christians on this page are being incredibly judgmental. It's as if they're trying to scare you into believing by threatening damnation. "My way or the highway."     I'm Jewish, so I obviously don't believe you need to follow Jesus to  get into Heaven. Jews don't focus on Heaven or believe in Hell, so it's actually impossible for you to go to Hell from where I stand.     I can't imagine there's a G-d who wouldn't read past the "Belief in Jesus, check yes or no" line. There are tons of cold-blooded, unrepentant murderers and sinners who believe in Jesus---should they get into Heaven when a righteous, otherwise "Christlike" agnostic or non-Christian doesn't?    I don't think G-d is *that* self-centered or petty. If you're a good person, it should be sufficient. What goes around comes around.    How would we be doing Jesus and/or G-d any favors by deferring our sins to him? I don't get it. I think we'd be doing him a greater favor by maintaining clean criminal records, paying our child support bills and  the like.|`|9mLjDa5kaa	The only way to get into heaven is by believing in Jesus.     We're all sinners. Only Jesus is acceptable payment for sins, because Jesus died on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead.     All the good deeds in the world won't pay for even ONE of your sins. All the trying to be a "good person" won't pay for even ONE of your sins. Doing "religious activites" won't pay for even ONE of your sins.     Either Jesus pays for your sins, or you pay for them in eternal torment in hell. That is the choice before you.    So believe in Jesus as God and Savior, and you're saved, that simple (John 3:16). :)|`|a43c635a9767f924cfd929c6c43f2501aa	I do not know, but if I were you I would be afraid to take the chance.|`|dbw210qqaa	John 14:6 (King James Version)     6Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.|`|026b1934d4ff58e232cc4b419808adc4aa	I'm Agnostic as well. I love it on how the Jesus freaks believe that they have this monopoly on heaven (If there is such a place which I am willing to bet every dime I own that it doesn't). You believe in what you want to believe in. I think religion is a form of social control, and the sheeple that call themselves Christian, Muslims, or whatever, uses Heaven and Hell to scare people into conforming. You won't go to hell because there is no Hell.

Stop using stereotypes. They only are a minority of the gay population who fit stereotypes. And there are way more girly straight guys than there are girly gay guys. What you're talking about is a hormonal phenomenon, and it doesn't touch only gays.

mvgfatSNaa	Pat Buchanan|`|hf27zNgdaa	pat buchannan|`|AA11627141	Hi Herbie,  Pat Buchannan said this because he claimed Englishmen make better immigrants than Zulus, because they're "easier to assimilate".He said an open Mexican border invites the drug trade, which he did not consider a victimless crime. In Where the Right Went Wrong he claimed "the Communist Chinese government has the secret loyalty of millions of 'overseas Chinese' from Singapore to San Francisco." He also opposed Muslim immigration to the United States and Europe. Hope this helped..

We covered it with garbage bags, and put topsoil on top of that to hide it.

otiBw8WYaa	You can't save anyone. Your friend has to want to help herself.|`|DG3lYbkfaa	there're many reasons as to why a person has anger issues. I think she's unhappy about many many things that happened to her in the past. At some point, you need to tell her that one needs to be at peace with the past. If one doesn't, one'll continue to suffer miserably. It's really not worth to be angry at the mistakes other people have made. It's like one punishes oneself for the mistakes that others have done over and over. Others just make a mistake or two to us, but we punish ourself over and over, more than others did it to us, by being angry or by directing the anger one generates toward other people. One doesn't deserve to be miserable. One doesn't deserve the self-punishing behaviour. But, one deserves to be happy. One needs to know the differences between false happiness and true happiness. Directing anger at others certainly boosts the ego. And, by the time the ego is satisfied, one feels great. BUT, this is certainly not beneficial at all. The truth is one's only creating more problems. So, one needs to let go of the anger. And, deal with the past, peacefully. One needs to be at peace with oneself.  This thing happens to many people, all the time. People, in general, like to punish themselves as if they deserve it and as if if one punishes oneself, one'll become a better person, which in reality the self-punishing behaviour has never been good and beneficial at all. In fact, it's only making things worse.  So, give her understanding as to why anger doesn't solve anything, at all.

Sometimes being their advisor also makes them comfortable on being with you as a friend and they do open up.  Of course in my case, most of the girls I am/was friends with know that I was interested with them. There was a line that neither them nor me crossed. "The relationship". My policy with them was if I was taken just friends, if you're taken just friends. When they needed help for/from their bf situation, I became their big brother. We will still hang out and stuff...heck even their jealous bf's were comfortable with me hanging out w/ their girl.|`|I759qzWkaa	Um, i have the same problem as you, but i usually just tell them.

Please meet me in the kitchen.    Or something like that, or write it down and hand it to them. Finding a somewhat informal way of telling someone something can be the best way for something huge like that.|`|bDHVE5uRaa	Do you think they would be comfortable with it?

They may already know you're gay ;)|`|56EU4FTIaa	I have the same problem! Ive been trying to say it since 8th grade! I can relate 100%.    I don't know if your in the same situation as me but like talking about sex in general is taboo in my family so bringing up sexuality is a whole different situation. The only times I've ever been close to ever telling them is when we talk about homosexuality. The problem is we barely skim the subject and its over before it begins.

GET OUT OF IT NOW.. walk away and don't look back... your too good of a person to put up with that... i am serious... NO one should have to put up with that... for your own safety break it off and leave...|`|AyEkA6Flaa	I don't know why he is abusive, but you need to get out NOW.    He is on destruct mode, which means you are in grave danger if you stay with him.  This will not get better.  Leave him.    I don't know if anyone has an adequate answer to why some people are abusive.|`|G1OJNCF4aa	Please Please Please get out of that situation, it can only get worse.|`|AA12006309	Who cares why?  This is the point where you pack your bag and leave.    Abuse doesn't need a source, it doesn't need to be rational.  It's fear and control.  It's not going to get easier, it's not going to get better, and no amount of you trying to "fix" things is going to make him happy.  No partner - I don't care what race or orientation - should ever inflict violence on another partner.  Period.  End story.    Get your things and go.  If you can't get your things, just go.  Find the police, or a shelter, or someplace safe to go, and leave, before you end up in the hospital.|`|EagkCeNHaa	Don't allow it.|`|YJtJin8Zaa	ok well its not cuz u dont liet it or watever. if u were with someone else it probably wouldnt have happend. please even though i dont know u im scared for ur life. get out of it because he will eventually kill u for real. get out thats just horrible and it might be because he is biracial to but who cares get out of that abusive relationship ok becasue its not going to end|`|zY64xc6xaa	Because you allow it.

I don't think his race has anything to do a it. It sounds like he has low self esteem and he feels better by making you feel bad.

Vow to move on!!|`|oEQq6v2waa	get out of this relationship emmediately, dont think about it anymore, it seems like a dangerous situation, get guidance from any local gay organization, gay and lesbian center, bienestar, just get out, im not kidding about this, when a person threatens to hurt you physically or saying they will kill you, its not funny and should not be taken litely, so please seek some help and get out of this situation,
uUCTem2Eaa	"Gypsy" is often a catch-all pejorative term used to describe anyone who is relatively dark-skinned. It means "Egyptian", but this was a false assumption; those called gypsies were usually of Indian ancestry.|`|AM7CgQ4daa	I would interpret gypsy as meaning - moved around a lot.  If could be he has had many jobs, keeps moving on to a new one, or he has moved from town to town a lot.  However,  the problem with the word gypsy is that it means more than one thing. Traditionally nomadic, usually found in Eastern Europe but quite prevalent all over Europe, called the Roma. They possibly originate from India, and were called Gypsies a long time ago by Europeans who thought they were Egyptian.   There are also other travelling people who are not Roma but get lumped in with them.  Traditionally Roma and other travellers have sold small items door to door.|`|eYq5vYm2aa	maybe a thief or tha hes magical|`|41fc520a4a56916bd52c4b45ddaffe65aa	Could mean the guy has held many positions in many different firms.

BevylvVSaa	There is a disability community - and people with disabilities have a choice to belong to it or not. People who have joined the community do so because they want to know about their history and culture (disability humor, sport, art), be more productive advocates for themselves and others (get involved in passing laws that protect their rights), be where good access is important to all, and just be with people where being disabled is common and familiar. There are many sub-communities too- specific disabilities, disabled academics, disabled professionals, disabled advocates, disabled wheelchair athletes - I could go on and on.    Many people are under the mistaken notion that to be part of the community means you identify as more disabled than others with disabilities. When you are in a group of people  without disabilities and you are the only one with it - you stand out. But among a group of people with disabilities your disabilities become very normal.     I think in the best of worlds a person with a disability can move between many different communities - I sometimes am part of a community of women, of parents, of my local community, of people interested in the arts, of my condo association - most people are a part of multiple communities.|`|accdd753250739a255f532616b8c6cdfaa	I certainly don''t see disabled people as a community and why should they be.  Disabled just means that the person is not able to do everything that all other people can do.  It covers a range of people who may be learning disabled, sight impaired, hearing loss, or physically disabled. Do you see anything that makes these people into a community.  Personally I find this question to be rather narrow minded and not at all in sync with what disabled people really are, and who they are.|`|BBItH3eFaa	I am not sure about all disabled people, but other the past years there have been massive developments in making learning disabled people apart of there own community at large!|`|s2aCNJOBaa	People With Disabilities (PWDs) are considered to be a community for various reasons.    Example:  Various PWDs use "PWD Insider Language" to refer to other PWDs. Non-PWDs (Outsiders) can NOT use such "PWD Insider Language" to refer to other PWDs while other PWDs can do so.    Example: There is a General PWD Community but there are PWD Sub-Communities within the General PWD Community like Autism Community, Deafness Community, Blindness Community, and etc. Each PWD Sub-Community has their own Disability language and their own Disability acronyms in reference to the Disability that each PWD Sub-Community has.    NFED = National Foundation for Ectodermal Dysplasias   AB = Able Bodied Person  MAB = Momentarily Able Bodied  TAB = Temporarily Able Bodied  PWD = Person With Disabilities   DAC = Disabled Adult Child  CWD = Child With Disabilities  ADAAA = Americans With Disabilities Act Amendment Act   ADA = Americans With Disabilities Act  IDEA = Individuals With Disabilities Act  ASA = Autism Society Of America  ANI = Autism Network International  NAA = National Autism Association  NAD = National Association of the Deaf  ALDA = Association of Late-Deafened Adults  HOHA = Hard of Hearing Advocates   HOH = Hard Of Hearing  LDA = Late Deafened Adult  CI = Cochlear Implant  CDI = Certified Deaf Interpreter   ASL = American Sign Language  SEE= Signed Exact English  PSE = Pidgin Signed English  CODA = Children Of Deaf Adults  SCI/D = Spinal Cord Injuries and Disorders     SCD = Spinal Cord Disability  SCI = Spinal Cord Injury  NDSS = National Down Syndrome Society   NDSC = National Down Syndrome Congress   NFB = National Federation Of The Blind    ACB = American Council of the Blind   AFB = American Foundation for the Blind   LP = Little Person  LPA = Little People of America  LD = Late Deafened   LD = Learning Disability   DD = Developmental Disabilities   NT = Neurotypical   AC = Autistic Cousin or Autistics and Cousins   AS = Asperger's Syndrome  ASD = Autism Spectrum Disorder  PDD = Pervasive Developmental Disorder   PDD-NOS = Pervasive Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified  PECS = Picture Exchange Communication System  AAC = Augmentative and Alternative Communication   AACD = Augmentative and Alternative Communication Device    VOCA = Voice Output Communication Aid  PFL = People First Language  UCP = United Cerebral Palsy   SO = Special Olympics     ACA = Amputee Coalition of America   SPED = Special Education   IEP = Individualized Education Program   FAPE = Free Appropriate Public Education   DPW = Devotees, Pretenders and Wannabes   DSOs = Disabled Sports Organizations  MND = Motor Neurone Disease   ALS = Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis  CALS = Caregivers of ALS persons  PALS = Persons With ALS  ALSA = Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Association  PCA = Personal Care Assistant   NDRN = National Disability Rights Network  P&A/CAP = Protection and Advocacy and Client Assistance Program    VR = Vocational Rehabilitation   CCD = Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities   WID = World Institute on Disability   DREDF = Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund   DBTAC = Disability and Business Technical Assistance Center   ILC = Independent Living Center  CIL = Center for Independent Living  NCIL = National Council on Independent Living   SABE = Self Advocates Becoming Empowered   WAPD = World Association of Persons with Disabilities    AAPD = American Association Of People With Disabilities   IL/CI = Independent Living and Community Integration     Non-Autie  Non-Aspie  Autie  Aspie  Walkie-Talkie  Bowling Pin  Hearie  Deafie  Blinks    These is just a extremely small sample of the Disability language and Disability acronyms I have heard being used within the PWD Community. A person who IS involved with the Disability Community will probably know some of the Disability language and Disability acronyms. But a person who is NOT involved with the Disability Community will NOT know the Disability language and Disability acronyms. What I am trying to say is that language helps makes and bind a community together through the type of language that is being spoken within the community.    Yes, the Disability Community and the PWD Community ARE communities.

Example: They are drinking water.     "Were" is past tense.   Example: Were you drinking water?                  Were we suppose to buy her water?                  or  "Were" is plural (more than one) and in the past.   Example: They were drinking water.     I hope its clear. And good luck.

"Micheal was dancing." "She is happy."    In general, are and were are used for plural forms of the verb (2 or more persons or things). "Micheal and the group were dancing." "They are happy"    Are is also used in the 2nd person tense. When you are talking directly to the person. "Are you ok?" "Are you getting all of this?" "You are going to have a hard time with this because its all pretty confusing!"|`|ar2So81eaa	"was" is past tense. You use it to describe something that has already happened.  "is" is present tense. You use it to describe something that is currently happening.    "Are" is the plural present tense. You use it when the subject is plural (when multiple people or things are doing the action) and the action is currently happening.  "Were" is the plural past tense. You use it when the subject is plural and the action has already happened.    Example: Sheila is a doctor. (current with a single subject)  Sheila and Dan are doctors. (current with 2 subjects)    Sheila was an active child. (speaks of the past. Subject is singular)  Sheila and Dan were active children. (speaks of the past. Subject is plural)|`|lrsLI2JGaa	"Is" is present tense.  You use "is" when you talk about "he, she, or it."  It's the third person conjugation of the verb "to be."  It describes something that is going on right now.  Example:  He is happy.    "Was" is past tense.  You would use it to describe something someone did before.  Example:  I was happy.    As for "are" and "were", you would just use these conjugations with plural things.  This is different from the two examples above, because those are singular.  "Are" and "were" are plural, though.  That's the only difference.    Example (present tense):  We are happy  Example (past tense):  We were happy.
eO2rnf7yaa	Skepticism is a lazy pseudo-philosophy.  Like others, Lazy people don't always like to be alone,  but their laziness amounts to an unwillingness to contribute.  They often want to interact with others without having to contribute.    Skeptics are intellectually lazy, and their laziness often is manifested in a  willingness to trash others as the easiest way of interacting.       You don't have to take real abuse,  and you especially don't have to "cast your pearls before swine",  but sometimes maybe you can help them with a kind word or helpful example of true Christianity.    Putting up with skeptics and  loving and praying for our enemies isn't always easy.    Being crucified wasn't easy, either, but Jesus did that for us.  Sometimes the best way we can accept the mercy of Jesus is to give it away through our own patient actions toward others.   I often fail to do this, and one of my most frequent prayers is to ask for forgiveness for not being as good as I should be, and asking for help from the Holy Spirit to become a better man.

Bombay is probably too far north, since Saturn is in the 6th in  this chart.  Software won't allow me to adjust "gracefully" for location.  Will adjust for time.  Movement to 1700hrs (presumed "standard" time)  puts Saturn in the 7th house per Question.    Chart and interpretations written here are from Western Tropical   astrology.    While I cannot write that you would be unsuccessful in farming, you  might find yourself more so in animal husbandry (in the general   category of agricultureal occupations).  Most likely with small animals  (such as rabbit, chinchilla, small sheep, small dogs, etc).    You may be able to attain Recognition in singing, music, jewlery, or  clothing design.  You may also be able to obtain Recognition for   writing (scripts, plays, satire).      Yes, with Pluto involved in your 7th house between Saturn and Jupiter  you may be "much married" (and much divorced).  You would be   "challenged" a bit often by marriage...and business partners as well.    The "cluster" of planets seems to spread from the 6th of Health to the  7th of Partnerships.  Normally "clustering" does not bode well, for it  implies the person can become "swept up" in Events and/or   Circumstances that are "overwhelming" (such as the recent ice storms  which are ravaging the US yesterday and today).  Fevers, mental   strain, and infections brought about by personal neglect of oneself   during such times (and ironically, how can we help but do so when   Events become "overwhelming"?) will have a serious impact.      Hm.  Try to make contingency plans and update them regularly (such  as monthly to start...then every 3 months after you get the process   down and have some success with applying the Concept).

I know I'm gay, but I'm always up for experience, so I dated a boy for a while to see the difference. I used to laugh at my bf all the time when he tried to make a move on me-it was like watching myself in an incredibly hot body.     From my angle, you sound great already, so I wouldn't worry about the reaction from the crowd you might be looking for. But from YOUR angle, think about it, a tough guy with a 5 o'clock shadow and a muscular chest...that brings you the gift of intense lesbian sex whenever you want it. Sounds like a good deal to me.|`|Um9rR3PUaa	wow you are so in mature and juvenile grow up child i am sure someone looks at you below the waste they scream|`|7b146a60b32cbb99ede1f7f2407168d2aa	I'm bisexual and I find penes amazing!

agTCqkLDaa	Not really...    Not everyone thinks that fat constitutes the same size.  I am fat but my boyfriend can't see it (5'3 and a size 8/10).  That is fat to the majority of men.    Some men think Shakira is fat.  I think she is tiny.  I'm pretty sure if I had Shakira's body and asked you if I was fat and you told me I was that  I'd get offended because Shakira is not fat.      NOW, if I am the size of Rosie O'Donnel, I will NOT even ask you if I'm fat.  That is an obvious answer.    You know, most fat chicks won't even ask you if they're fat because they already know the answer...

We are also a smaller house which costs more than some of the bigger ones. Freshman just have to pay $100 which we send to our nationals. We also have a $400 room deposit which you get back when you move out, just like renting a place to live. Even though we are one of the more expensive houses, we are still one of the cheapest places to live that give you everything. We are cheaper than the dorms. And the price includes food, internet, utilities, washer/dryer, everything you need. Some can be expensive because they just remodeled their house or just bought it. There is one house that just remodeled so they are much more expensive to pay off all of that. The price also varies from house to house. So if you want to join one ask what their room prices are because they do vary.
z60A96sIaa	Hi, MFD:    I like the story about Jesus healing those demoniacs. They were hopelessly lost, terrorized society, and were complete outcasts.  If Jesus can heal them, then there is no excuse for anyone not receiving Christ's blessings and a new life led by the Holy Spirit.    Luke8:27   "And when he went forth to land, there met him out of the city a certain man, which had devils long time, and ware no clothes, neither abode in [any] house, but in the tombs.      8:28   When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, [thou] Son of God most high? I beseech thee, torment me not.      8:29   (For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For oftentimes it had caught him: and he was kept bound with chains and in fetters; and he brake the bands, and was driven of the devil into the wilderness.)      8:30   And Jesus asked him, saying, What is thy name? And he said, Legion: because many devils were entered into him.      8:31   And they besought him that he would not command them to go out into the deep.      8:32   And there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the mountain: and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into them. And he suffered them.      8:33   Then went the devils out of the man, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake, and were choked."

God made it easy and sent us messengers and prophets to show us the way and tell us why... so all the messengers and all the religions are from the same only God, so they've got to be complementary to each other, not opposing each other!!! then God must have said His final words in the last message, what is the last message? and how do we know it's the last one? I guess that would be the religion that believes in all messengers and all books equally... is there such religion? actually yes, Islam does :)  A True Muslim (man or woman) gets his reward for obeying Allah's orders (Allah means The God in Arabic) by going to heaven, where he/she are indulged forever in all the good thing s that were on earth and more, things no one ever dreamt of or heard about. The Holy Quran tells Muslims (men and women) there will be good food, good wine and sex in heaven for all, but not in the bestial way you may think of, but rather in a way that is satisfactory for everyone and better than what was on earth. Heaven is no heartbreak or injustice land.  True Muslims are no terrorists, and Islam never calls for that, Islam means peace, it bans violence unless you were fought so you fight back, it only doesn't require Muslims to be cowards, and true Muslims understands this very well and never attack civilians.   Islam is the only religion that accepts freedom of religion and asks men to treat women gently like queens.  Muslims don't deny Jesus, they believe in him, love him and respect him so much.  We believe Jesus is NOT dead till today; he wasnt murdered or crucified as most people think. God made the man who betrayed Jesus be killed instead by switching their looks for a moment. Jesus was left up to live in heaven until the end of days when he will come back to earth, make justice prevail instead of oppression, fight the imposter and perform his last prayer before he really dies like other Prophets. So we're waiting for you Jesus, Messenger of God, to bring the world peace and pray with us. Thats what prophet Muhammad told us and this is what I believe in, Im a Muslim  so how do we know it's true? what is said in the last message and what should we do? read the following, and you'll figure out for yourself:|`|mfzsYLG6aa	I'm an Atheist, but I like Job.

WHERE do you get THIS number?  Even modern day scientists estimate between 2 and 100 MILLION species WORLDWIDE... in CURRENT day populations.  You have to remember that Noah happened a LOOOOOOOOOONG TIME ago, when there were a LOT LESS "species" than there are today.  Furthermore, the area of the world where the flood occurred also limited the number of "species" to be put on the ark.  THEN, not ALL of these species NEEDED to go on the ark, such as the fish and such of the oceans.  So that number is cut down significantly by these three factors alone.    But, then, why such a HUGE discrepancy in how many species there are?  Because even those same scientists CANNOT AGREE upon a SINGLE DEFINITION of the word, "species." As merely ONE example, a horse and donkey can mate and create a mule... thus there are three species, but the mule is sterile and cannot reproduce on it's own.  So do you then count the mule as a species or not?  (See Wikipedia article below for more details on this controversy.)    Now... Genesis tells us only that God COMMANDED the animals to go to Noah, Noah didn't go out and gather them up.  Furthermore, if you read here:    Then the LORD said to Noah, "Enter the ark, you and all your household, for you alone I have seen to be righteous before Me in this time. "You shall take with you of every clean animal by sevens, a male and his female; and of the animals that are not clean two, a male and his female; also of the birds of the sky, by sevens, male and female, to keep offspring alive on the face of all the earth.     The passage refers to the animals as CLEAN and UNCLEAN animals only.  There is NO reference to the term SPECIES.  So, God only compelled those He defined as "clean" and "unclean."  Furthermore, since "species" is not mentioned specifically, are we then talking about "kinds" of animals rather than species?  There are over 400 breeds of dog, but "dog" is only one kind.... canine... then, we include in that coyotes, wolves, foxes and the other canine species.  So, the term "kind" (animal of every KIND) is more closely related to GENUS rather than SPECIES... again cutting DOWN the number needed to fit on the ark.    So, your question has too many "arguments" in it.  We simply do not know how many.  The question which is more important, however, is WHY did God destroy the earth with a flood?  This is the lesson from the story we should concentrate on rather than such a trivial side issue as how many species that could fit on the ark.      Have a blessed day.|`|x6CnkpQkaa	He had the help of God, with whom all things are possible.|`|Q1ow9MAwaa	Here's a completely rational explanation as to how the animals fit with a much more logical set of numbers attached.      http://creationontheweb.com/content/view...

Only clean beasts were put on the Ark for Noahs care for.  8000 species went on 16000 individuals. Enough room.    Otherwise, it was probably a local flood. The Euraphtes is the only region that shows evidence of severve flooding in that time period.|`|X9rXRNUxaa	He didn't - there are only about 8,000 KINDS on animals !    And you seem to forget that God designed the Ark, and He knew exactly    HOW BIG TO MAKE IT !      .|`|neuprBeGaa	The current gobbledygook is that he only carried two of each KIND of creature.  "Kind" is a rather ambiguous term that can be adjusted to fit whatever the Creationist needs it to mean - for instance, he didn't have to carry rats AND squirrels AND mice AND capybaras...he could just carry a couple mice and then they micro-evolved into the other rodents.  (Ignoring that the silly term micro-evolution is normally used to describe evolution that is not sufficient to speciate.)

The anti-christ is a composite, made up of individuals & groups who either oppose Christ openly, or who claim to be able to do themselves what only he is both authorized by God, &, capable of carrying out.

If you carefully read Revelation 6, the first seal to be opened reveals a false Christ (Antichrist). The second seal reveals a horrifying war (WW III). So he'll appear just before WW III, as prophesied in Ezekiel 38 and 39.    As for where he is going to be from, he will become the head of the European Union which will be the only cohesive political and military entity left to grab the reins of world power after the United States and Russia destroy each other during the war.|`|lh2H5oSOaa	Anti-Christ is very much here and busy in making a system that will result in his coming to power. He is a robust Jewish youth, presently living in the USA. He is working for a system whereby wealth is concentrated in  a few hands and it becomes easy for the central authority to subdue groups or nations by withholding their food and essential supplies. Once this system is in place, he will emerge as the biggest test of the faith of people. For he will deprive his opponents from food grains and provided abundant supplies to his followers.    He will remain in this world for 37 days and will be killed at the hands of Jesus Christ near Ludd Airport in Israel.

The anti christ is is in league with Satan and is satan. Be careful you are not decieved, Satan can appear as an angel of light to trick you. read the bible more the info is in their or look it up.

However, as with most scripture, there are various interpretations of it.  I read a great article about young Jews and tattooing and how the taboo was being lifted.  I wish I had saved that article.  Wait!  I found it!  See the "references" section.    If your Grandma is Christian and she gives you grief about your tattoo, you can always ask her when she is going to start keeping a kosher kitchen and start keeping the other 610 laws which G-d gave to the Jews.  (then she'll say something about Jesus freeing her from the laws... they never applied to her in the first place if she's not Jewish, but that's another matter).|`|71c6c3d26be7dbca2bd5e204e344e5f6aa	You cant have tattoos anywhere in the bible, that would make it hard to read|`|kxUigIkraa	Leviticus 19:28|`|x6CnkpQkaa	Leviticus 19:28, "Do not cut your bodies for the dead or put tattoo marks on yourselves.

fcb47ba6b3d558e424fe13d64318ea8caa	God has answered many of my prayers. I had been praying for sometime about my dad who was a sinner. I prayed that he would repent and get saved. That prayer was answered and my dad was baptized and now serves God.   My husband who is an atheist is now starting to think more about God and I have been praying that God turn his stony heart around.  When we pray about things, even though we sometimes want them to happen then and there, God says that it will happen in His time not ours.|`|6v1LIdcaaa	I have even gotten a text yet. what's up with that, G.o.d.?|`|10QSTGWAaa	Whether or not to give up on my best friend, who was doing crazy reckless things.

A LOT! a really cute question to answer, God has always answered my prayers, latest was healing and protecting my Mom and unborn nephew, and they became sound and safe now :) Thank God.  Ok, we know we don't create each other and we don't come to this world from nowhere because when we die we must be going somewhere as well, hence there must be God, if there were many Gods, they would have fought over what to be created and what not to be, probably over who to die and who to live at the same time... so it's gotta be one God... if that God created us then there must be a reason... could we figure it out on our own? God made it easy and sent us messengers and prophets to show us the way and tell us why... so all the messengers and all the religions are from the same only God, so they've got to be complementary to each other, not opposing each other!!! then God must have said His final words in the last message, what is the last message? and how do we know it's the last one? I guess that would be the religion that believes in all messengers and all books equally... is there such religion? actually yes, Islam does :)  A True Muslim (man or woman) gets his reward for obeying Allah's orders (Allah means The God in Arabic) by going to heaven, where he/she are indulged forever in all the good thing s that were on earth and more, things no one ever dreamt of or heard about. The Holy Quran tells Muslims (men and women) there will be good food, good wine and sex in heaven for all, but not in the bestial way you may think of, but rather in a way that is satisfactory for everyone and better than what was on earth. Heaven is no heartbreak or injustice land.  True Muslims are no terrorists, and Islam never calls for that, Islam means peace, it bans violence unless you were fought so you fight back, it only doesn't require Muslims to be cowards, and true Muslims understands this very well and never attack civilians.   Islam is the only religion that accepts freedom of religion and asks men to treat women gently like queens.  Muslims don't deny Jesus, they believe in him, love him and respect him so much.  We believe Jesus is NOT dead till today; he wasnt murdered or crucified as most people think. God made the man who betrayed Jesus be killed instead by switching their looks for a moment. Jesus was left up to live in heaven until the end of days when he will come back to earth, make justice prevail instead of oppression, fight the imposter and perform his last prayer before he really dies like other Prophets. So we're waiting for you Jesus, Messenger of God, to bring the world peace and pray with us. Thats what prophet Muhammad told us and this is what I believe in, Im a Muslim  so how do we know it's true? what is said in the last message and what should we do? read the following, and you'll figure out for yourself:|`|AA12127693	Hi Lt,    For me it was here (YA!) where I found all of my friends who better  help me understand my son and our adoption.

I asked God that when it was my moms time that she be allowed to go peacefully, as she had a hard life.You know what exactly one week after my friends mom passed my mom also passed. She went in her sleep, so went quietly and painlessly. It broke my heart. A friend of mine reminded me that I had asked that she go quietly, and that not many get to go that way.

Last December: People at work getting laid off, I asked for peace and got it.    Once I didn't have peace about a new job.  One day, (not at work but doing mission work) God told me, take care of my kingdom and I'll take care of your little bitty kingdom.  1 week later, out of the blue, I got another new job making a lot more money.    Once I was writing a tithe check and thought it was too much, but did anyway.  The next day, I got a 10% raise.    Once I told God, I don't know why, but I want to move out of the country to this other country.  In 6 months, I was out of the country and I got to keep my job in the US.    I'll stop here.    Edit: No I want.    The past December, my wife and I gave some food and Christmas presents to a really dirt poor Christian family.  The father told us that we were an answer to his prayer.  He had done some contract work, and actually organized it where he had some folks working for him.  The client stiffed him and he still had to pay his other guys.  The presents and food that we gave him covered his costs.    Edit 2: Once my wife got pregnant without insurance!  Because of that, we had the baby outside the US in a private (not socialist) hospital.  All in all, we saved $15,000+ as the delivery was a complicated C-Section.  After reviewing what happened, we realized that there was a GREAT chance that my wife and baby would have died if the delivery would have taken place in the US.  (Too much to write here to explain.....)  Point, God uses the stupidity of the people who love Him, to take care of them.  The stupidity being that I didn't have insurance for my wife when I could afford it!  God ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!|`|x6CnkpQkaa	To calm my fears for my family.

Its shocking the resembalance.  http://mormonismi.info/jamesdavid/masend...       The Marks...  1. Mark of the Square (right breast): represents "exactness and honor" in keeping the commandments and covenants of God.    2. Mark of the Compass (left breast): symbolizes "an undeviating course leading to eternal life; a constant reminder that desires, appetites, and passions are to be kept within the bounds the Lord has set; and that all truth may be circumscribed into one great whole."    3. Navel Mark: represents "the need of constant nourishment to body and spirit."    4. Knee Mark: suggests "that every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess that Jesus is the Christ".      History...  In 1842, just two months after being initiated into Freemasonry, Joseph Smith introduced the wearing of garments to a select group of men. Ceremonial markings on the garment were originally snipped into the cloth as part of the man's washing and anointing ceremony. This helped keep the markings secret from those who had not been through the ritual, including the women who sewed the garments.     The original purpose of wearing garments was to remind Smith's priesthood brethren of their sacred oaths - especially oaths of secrecy regarding the plural marriage doctrine. http://www.i4m.com/think/temples/temple_...
AA11447161	The idea of forgiving and forgetting is simply not possible.    There are times when forgiveness can lead to relationships being restored. Often this only happens when there is genuine repentance, or sorrow, for the hurtful thing that has been done.    But there are times when the acts of hurt have been so damaging or unrelenting (lack of sorrow for hurtful actions) that it is right to walk away from the source of that hurt. The idea of God'd love and the gift of forgiveness does not equal becoming anyones punching bag or doormat.     But if you do decide to shut someone out of your life make sure you forgive them first, really forgive them. Otherwise you will walk away from them with an emotional suitcase full of anger, hatred, resentment etc. And if you carry that suitcase away with you, it is going to affect every relationship you have into the future.    Forgiveness is as much for you (setting you free) as it is for the other person!|`|aU399em7aa	I do also agree with others about prayer.  You should be taking this question to the Father of Jesus by way of the Holy Spirit, however, I will answer your question with a question.      Perhaps it will help you to discern what you should do.      Let me ask you.  The sins you have committed against God.....would you be ok with it if He forgives those sins you committed against Him yet then He has nothing to do with you and avoids you from that point onwardly?    Would that be cool with you?    I do not want to appear to write as though I'm not sympathetic to your plight.  If someone has committed a grave sin against you personally I can understand that it might be wise to keep your distance.  It may depend on them too.  Are they repentant?  Did they seek your forgiveness.  These questions are relevant.    I hope YHWH fills you with the knowledge of His will through all spiritual wisdom and understanding.|`|dx5xU78raa	If being around that person causes you to be less of a person, then yes it's okay to cut them out.|`|1de1c120b993c2d297eb9718fb158aebaa	Forgiveness comes first, never to do harm to your enemies...    Mathew 5   43(BX) "You have heard that it was said,(BY) 'You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.' 44But I say to you,(BZ) Love your enemies and(CA) pray for those who persecute you, 45(CB) so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven. For he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and(CC) sends rain on the just and on the unjust. 46(CD) For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Do not even the tax collectors do the same? 47And if you greet only your brothers,[h] what more are you doing than others? Do not even(CE) the Gentiles do the same? 48(CF) You therefore must be(CG) perfect,(CH) as your heavenly Father is perfect.    but that doesn't mean you have to associate with them....    1 Corinthians 5:11 (English Standard Version)  11But now I am writing to you not to associate with anyone(A) who bears the name of brother if he is guilty of sexual immorality or greed, or is an idolater, reviler, drunkard, or swindlernot even to eat with such a one.|`|d529cebfe13576f3ddee3e55b4cd08ffaa	Wiser to know what you do or do not need in your life.

I have given a lot of people up completely, for one reason or another.  Take care of yourself.  Forgive does not equal forget.|`|zYAQrnjcaa	No, it's not ungodly.|`|vxMUiQ8gaa	you have to make sure you take care of yourself  as long as you aren't doing anything to hurt them, then it's okay    just make sure that it's a healthy understanding to end any relations with this person|`|y6ZlOQIaaa	If this person is still hurting you, then it is might be best for you to cut them out of your life, at least for awhile. You can pray for them. People do change, maybe in the future there can be a reconciliation. I would seek counsel from some people in your life that you trust, who knows the situation more fully.|`|h56ccHJGaa	If you feel hurt form a person try to forgive and forget. Disassociate yourself from people that you feel go against you, just remember to give them your warnings so they can't say you didn't.|`|202da6e16e428763788627390b166485aa	You should be asking God this question... not us.  He is the only one who truly knows the answer to this question.|`|M0IRADgWaa	If you are a religious person, Matthew 18:15-17 helps a lot. It says that if someone has hurt you, basically make every effort to bandage the wound between you two. If they continue to act in a mean and refuse to mend ways then you view them as tax collectors. So if they are still cold-hearted then you should still be civil, but you don't have to be a close friend or have much to do with them ever again.
r6fGmJK1aa	My partner and I are 25 yrs age difference.  We get along great.  We do have more in common then people our own age.      Like was said, you will need to think about this, to make sure it is what you both want.  But if you two truly love each other then the age issue is not a problem.|`|lBLBvE0Zaa	I wouldn't think anything about it, specially since I'm kind of in the same situation, though the age difference between my partner and myself isn't so big.    Anyways, it's your life and your relationship, so don't let anybody ruin it for you. You love him, he loves you, what's the problem? I bet you're a very mature person, way more than people your age, and that's why you're interested in someone older than you, which isn't wrong. You can't choose who you fall in love with, and at the end of the day what matters is your happiness. Ask yourself this question: could this person make me completely happy? If the answer is yes, then give it a shot, you have nothing to lose, right?    Love knows no age, race or gender. Don't limit yourself just because of what others may think.    Good luck!  ;-)|`|RoicHy87aa	honestly the age does make a difference. that's like a 19 year-old loving a baby. the maturity levels are way off and the only think a man that age wants with a younger girl is something too look at, touch, and use. do what you want. i think it's good you don't care what people think, but usually they think that way for a reason. just be careful and don't have sex with him or anything stupid like that. think if you got pregnant and in twenty years your baby's daddy would be old enough to be his grandpa.|`|NzvXINyGaa	I said say go for it. If you guys get along then you'll be fine. Age can be an issue if you care about external views towards you and you partner. Your legal age now at least, but just be careful.    Usually young to old relationships the older person tends to have a great deal of past. A past like, sex, X wives, etc. That's something you should consider before going head on to this.    But, my advice is think about it. He might have a lot of baggage you won't be able to handle and you'll just get hurt if your not careful.    Because again there's that huge age difference, it would be really hard because of all the criticism you might get from others. Your family, friends, Co workers, etc. can be just be some of the examples of these obstacles.    One more important major factor is the point in time in your lives, he might be ready for a child or marriage! He might have kids, or he a different point in his life where his views about life are different than yours.    Im not trying to deny you of being with the guy, but all these things you should consider before being with an older relationship.    If your willing to put up with all of these factors, than I give my hat to you young lady.|`|AA12006309	Your relationship is no one elses business but yours.  Yes, that big an age gap will be a problem - he's old enough to be your father.  You come from two completely different generations, were raised differently.  You'll each make references that the other won't understand.  If you want children, your ages are going to make a huge impact.    In the end, it's your life, and his life, what you do with it is your business, but there are a lot of things to consider, both short term and long term.  Good luck.|`|ox4tmOpJaa	I see no problem with this at all.|`|aIcNLJFDaa	Honestly, I would think nothing of it.  But it sounds like you already know yourself and shouldn't be concerned with the thoughts of others.   After all you said,"I know that society frowns upon this, but I honestly don't care."  When you get the chance to go out with him, and you two are out on the street, make him your focus. When two people show that kind of love, who could frown on it that you would honestly care?  I understand the curiosity though.. I've wondered too.. Been in that situation.  The only conclusion I came to was that someone would always look down on it. Even possibly a large amount of people. But I decided I just can't be bothered by others opinions if I want my own happiness. After all, the only person that can truly make you happy, is yourself.|`|u3Md6fsbaa	Interesting you should say, since I've been spending alot of time with someone who's 14 years older than me. I thought it was reeeally REALLY wierd. Actually, i still kinda think that. But on the other hand, some of the best marriages have 20 years between spouses. Its probably only when we're young that the numbers matter. Personally, I'm still deciding. If you want to chat, give me a shout. :)    isn't the difference in maturity amazing??|`|dXDQtrjvaa	I would be careful but you are technically an adult, you seem intelligent and I am sure you are capable of making informed decisions.  If you feel like this is a relationship that could be beneficial for both you and him I guess give it a shot.  Again though, be careful, cause you could just be some 18 year old hes looking to shag to boost his ego or you could just be in some phase where you want to date an older man for whatever reason (which there is nothing wrong with).   IDK, think about it a bit objectively, analyze the situation, do not worry about what society thinks.  Personally I would advise you to try to find a guy more your age, believe it or not there are plenty of good guys out there who would probably die to go out with you whom in the end you would probably be way better off with emotionally, physically,and philisophically .   just my 2 cent though.  good luck with everything.
N8UwWt2Kaa	Awww...I'm sorry hunny. I know how you feel, and when you really like someone as much as you like her, it takes a little while to get over them. But, you WILL! You just have to decide if you're ready to be with somebody else or not. You might need this time to get over her, as well as work out whatever "issues" you have. Trust me, you can only be down for so long, you'll find someone new.    Good luck!|`|yBZlTzWLaa	I've had major crushes on both guys and girls, during which I couldn't see myself with anybody else. I've also had periods where I've only been attracted to one gender or the other (though typically I like both;) as well as periods where I've been completely asexual. All these states were temporary.    You will get over her eventually, and you will likely develop a crush on someone else. It may be a man, or it may be a woman. If you're anything like me, It's the individual that's important, not their gender. Don't try to force it, and don't let your past experiences dictate your future.|`|wSeOxs7Jaa	Your hearts broken. You're going to feel like crap for a while. And then you're going to feel better. Happens to everyone and everyone gets over it. Give it time.

N8HgRKnfaa	If there are so-called prophecies about this, why would you believe them? Have these so called prophets that issue such information made any previous accurate predictions? What is their source: guesswork, a so-called psychic ability, or revelations from spirits or aliens or god knows what else?    And why aliens? There is no evidence that they exist, and even if they did a journey to earth would be impossible given the vast distance from one star to another. Wormholes? pure speculation.    You may be referring to the Planet X belief that a planet is approaching earth and will arrive at such and such a date and aliens living on this planet will either enslave or save humanity. You choose. This is nonsense logically and scientifically. Don't worry about what anyone says about the future; no one knows.     (Though I do believe there are some general revelations prophesied in the Bible that will, in one way or another prove true. But the Bible has the required track record and can be trusted--this is my personal belief and doesn't require aliens or mysterious planets and such)

It's shown in the reproductions of the drawings and it's talked about. But a misconception here. Kolob is a star that is close to where God lives. As for the after-life I have no clue what that consists of. Tell me about it when you get there. ;)    Edit: And you're right joshsybs there is no info that anyone lives there. As I stated earlier it's a star close to where God lives.

U24VtSlZaa	here's where "Peanuts" theology fails.  I'm talkin Charlie Brown, remember the kid who hid out in the pumpkin patch on Halloween?  If you're sincere enough, if you do the right things and say the right things, you'll be rewarded?  Get yourself baptized, you'll go to heaven?    here's where faith comes in.  you do what you believe is the right thing to do, and let God look after the rest.      You don't know what was in the surgeon's heart, but you can make a reasoned guess, based on observed behaviors.  Man lives his life after the example of Christ shouldn't have to do or say anything specific.  Who am I to say where he ends up?    And you don't know what was in your kidnapper's heart there at the end.  But God does.  Let Him sort it out, it's beyond our capability.|`|znt2s3sMaa	Yep.  We are saved by the grace of God, through faith ni Jesus alone.  Remember, the thief on the cross died and went to Heaven with Jesus, after doing not a single good "work" that is mentioned-it was his belief alone.|`|kxUigIkraa	Matthew 20    The Parable of the Workers in the Vineyard      1"For the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire men to work in his vineyard. 2He agreed to pay them a denarius for the day and sent them into his vineyard.    3"About the third hour he went out and saw others standing in the marketplace doing nothing. 4He told them, 'You also go and work in my vineyard, and I will pay you whatever is right.' 5So they went.        "He went out again about the sixth hour and the ninth hour and did the same thing. 6About the eleventh hour he went out and found still others standing around. He asked them, 'Why have you been standing here all day long doing nothing?'      7" 'Because no one has hired us,' they answered.         "He said to them, 'You also go and work in my vineyard.'      8"When evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman, 'Call the workers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last ones hired and going on to the first.'      9"The workers who were hired about the eleventh hour came and each received a denarius. 10So when those came who were hired first, they expected to receive more. But each one of them also received a denarius. 11When they received it, they began to grumble against the landowner. 12'These men who were hired last worked only one hour,' they said, 'and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the work and the heat of the day.'      13"But he answered one of them, 'Friend, I am not being unfair to you. Didn't you agree to work for a denarius? 14Take your pay and go. I want to give the man who was hired last the same as I gave you. 15Don't I have the right to do what I want with my own money? Or are you envious because I am generous?'      16"So the last will be first, and the first will be last."|`|dZMHd5PMaa	If the woman was truly saved then yes I believe that she is in heaven. Christians are not perfect people they are forgiven people. And while I agree that the man did wonderful things for people and was a better humanitarian than the women sadly I believe that if he didn't put his faith in the Lord and ask for his forgiveness them he is in hell|`|Q6qyfPkRaa	ok, although this is hard to hear. the man is not in heaven and the woman is. Why? b/c she accepted GOd as  her saviour and he didnt/ and according to GOd's word that is essential in your rite to life. Yes the guy was a model person.but he didnt beleive in GOD! Yes, the lady was a horriic person, and i am sure although saved she will surely pay for those sins she committed, but she still is saved.     what is grace: unmerited favor  Works: things that you do  Works  does not get you into heaven but beleif does. Trust me that The lady will answer for all those sins. It sounds horrible but no matter what happened to the young child, GOd is in control and he chose to take her life back for reason we cant understand, and the method was indeed horrific, but that is also why he says, that mnay who confess to be saved will not enter heaven and those whom we think will not go to heaven will.     My natural self really wants to say the lady should bust hell wide open, but my GOD given spirit knows that if she truely repented she will be saved. That is the beauty of it all.. GODd loves us DESPITE OF OURSELVES!!!!!!!!!|`|m3ZSwDFUaa	That is one of my biggest questions and I have not heard a lot of people really touching upon that and it makes you wonder. Would god send an atheist, who is a model citizen, doesn't drink, smoke, do drugs or cheat on his wife/husband and has never been to jail as opposed to the career criminal that "found" Jesus the last year of his life? And mind you, I am not asking about the person that repented last minute, I am talking about the person who has been in an out of jail for multiple crimes and lived out their last...let's say 5 years out of 80 being a model Christian.     My guess is that the atheist will burn in hell and the christian would go to heaven which is complete crap. What kind of god is that? That illustrates a key loophole in the entire argument about being "saved". If you tell me that just asking for forgiveness is enough then that would explain why only 2% of atheists make up our jails. We live in a real world and live our lives the best we can, not because we are scared of some invisible sky pixie.    Which also begs the question; Would that not mean that atheists are much more morally sound than christians? An atheist who lives a clean life does it out of his heart, not out of fear. It's difficult to gauge if a christian does it solely out of fear. It makes you wonder about a lot of things.|`|lmJlABpZaa	I think in reality we will never know the answer to this question... at least not in this life.  Many people also ask what happens to those who live in remote jungles and have never had the opportunity to even hear the name of Jesus... what happens to them?  My answer is I do not know.  Everyone lives their life full of sin, and I do not believe that any one sin is different from another in God's eyes.  His grace is for ALL people, and in the end he will judge us... so i will leave the judgment of who will be with him and who will be separated from him after death in his hands.|`|P5Iq6nufaa	It is very simple. Only God knows our salvation. And He is infinitely merciful. Do you really think that someone who is infinitely powerful, infinitely knowing, and infinitely merciful would allow (note I said allow, God does not "send" anyone to hell) that good man you spoke of to go to hell? Hell is for those who knowingly and intentionally turn their backs on God, without repentance, and right on up to their last breath.|`|Ow7I1J1gaa	You only go to heaven if you have salvation.  And not everyone can obtain it.  Sometimes people can commit sins that are so bad that Gods spirit can't enter them.  This is called "Passing the place of Repentance".  So no matter what that person does or says and no matter how sorry that person is, they can never receive salvation because they can't change what they did in the past they've already crossed the line and gone too far.      I can't judge where that lady went but I do know this much about salvation.  Jesus also said "not everyone who calls me their Lord will get into heaven"...|`|aU399em7aa	Siege should be given the best answer award.  I agree with her wholeheartedly.      Here is the scenario.    The eye surgeon did wonderful things in his lifetime.  Lots of good works.  Yet he also did bad things ( sins ).  The problem is.....no amount of "good" things ( righteous works ) can cancel the "bad things" ( sins ).    Elaborate?    Ok, if a man murders someone and never gets caught.  He feels badly and then decides from that point onwardly that he is going to live a life of righteousness and do nothing but good deeds and live a life of self denial.  Which one of those good deeds can bring the victim back to life?  The victim is dead and no amount of goodness from the killer can change the fact.      Take a thief for example.  A thief steals.  Later, he feels badly for it and returns what he stole without anyone knowing and wipes his hands clean and says to himself, "since I took it back I'm not guilty."  Wrong.  He stole it.  No matter what he does after that he cannot change the selfish evil that exuded from within his heart.    YHWH says to the murderer..."you're guilty son."  He says to the thief, "you're guilty son."  You both owe me.      They reply, "we did good things...we don't owe you anything.  We tried to right our wrongs."    He replies, "oh you owe Me and it will take you eternity to pay the debt because you can never undo what you've done."    Jesus shows up for those who have believed and they don't answer the same way.  The woman you mentioned answers and says, "I know I owe you but I have placed my faith in your Son Jesus' works and not my own.  I can never repay you for the awful thing I did."    Glory to Jesus the Christ who is the Savior of the World!    He redeems.    The woman you knew hopefully came to understand this and if so then she, indeed, was forgiven for those wretched things that she did because she knew and understood that it's all about Jesus and not her.      Jesus is the atonement and He is the ONLY path to God.  He suffered horribly for that woman and He paid every ounce of penalty for her through horrible pain and suffering and she is free indeed if her faith was in Jesus.  Muhammed wasn't sinless and didn't suffer for her.  Buddha wasn't sinless and didn't suffer for her.  President Carter, Reagan, Bush I, Clinton, Bush II, and Barrack Obama aren't sinless and didn't suffer for her.  ONLY JESUS did.  Praise the Lord in Heaven!    The surgeon.  If he did not realize these things and place His faith in the son of God then the Word of God has declared that he trusted in his own goodness and his own goodness will not be able to save him.    I do not rejoice that those who reject Jesus have to endure enternity paying back their sins but I rejoice in the justice and mercy of God.      He says He Himself is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for the whole world so all are free to call on Him for salvation for whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.    That is why it is called good news!    Last point.  The works that a Christian does "after" he has placed his faith in Christ Jesus the Messiah is "proof" of that salvation and not works to gain that salvation.      James addresses the naysayers and responds with, "18 But someone will say, You have faith, and I have works. Show me your faith without your works, and I will show you my faith by my works.     Lastly, though we are called to make judgements about Christian behavior we must be careful not to judge someone to hell or to heaven.  There are some "ifs" involved here.      YHWH wrote through Paul, "1 Corinthians 4:5  Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord comes, who will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness and reveal the counsels of the hearts."    Excellent question from you by the way.    May YHWH, the Father or our Lord who is Jesus, fill you with the knowledge of His will through all spiritual wisdom and understanding.|`|6QheioCMaa	No one except God knows this answer,      However, we do know from the Scriptures, that simply "being good" and doing "good" works, will not get us into heaven or save souls.      Only Christ can make a person righteous before God.|`|XmJZkFuMaa	God will judge.  But faith without works is dead.  James 2 says it best.  I'll quote just a bit.      "24 Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.    25 Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent them out another way?    26 For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also."    My guess from this chapter of scripture is that someone who has done many evil things, but then has faith but never does any works, has dead faith that will do nothing for them.  Whereas someone who does many good things but has no faith will be justified and judged according to what he knew.  What it all means in the final judgment is up to God to say.|`|QmRYgGnDaa	For by grace are ye saved, its a gift of God, not of works, lest any man should boast    from the Bible  we could never do enough good works no matter how long we lived to be even close to God. Good works will not get you saved or into Heaven. Gods grace is the only thing that will do that. He was gracious enough to send Jesus His only Son to die for yours, mine and everyone elses sins.   I beleive that if the woman truely confessed her sins and repented she is in Heaven.   The man however I cannot say. He could have changed his mind and believed before it was to late, but only he and God know. I do know that his works didn't get him to Heaven.|`|9mLjDa5kaa	Grace and works are opposites (Romans 11:6).     Salvation is truly a free gift.  Jesus will not grade on a curve for anyone.  Either all your sins are forgiven by your believing in Jesus alone, or you are sent to eternal torment in hell. That is the choice before you.  Jesus died on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead.  Believing this is the ONLY WAY to be saved.     You got used to grading on a curve in college.  The Lord doesn't use that system, and will not.|`|NaM4ZT64aa	If I were not an atheist, I would believe in a God who would choose to save people on the basis of the totality of their lives and not the pattern of their words.  I think he would prefer an honest and righteous atheist to a TV preacher whose every word is God, God, God, and whose every deed is foul, foul, foul.-Isaac Asimov    It really is very sad that anyone believes such a thing, that Gandhi is in hell and murdering, raping Crusaders are in heaven.|`|7KJcMpl9aa	I'm not sure, I don't know the will of God.    But, in my opinion, if she was truly sorry and God really did forgive her, then yes, she's in Heaven.    The first dude probably is too.  It's like the case of the Tibetan monk who lived 1500 years ago who's never even heard of Christ.  Does he deserve to go to Hell?      God will judge us when we see Him, and only then will we know his will.    Until then, be confident that God has it all worked out.  In the end, all we have is our faith.|`|0f6a1cdae0a3ce3617b1109a091741bdaa	No one knows the heart other than God himself, so I can not judge. But from the standpoint of good works and grace, let me put it this way.    No human being is capable of EVER being pleasing enough for God. God can not be in the presence of sin...so no matter how hard one tries, good works can not get you into heaven...because you will still be a sinner.    Grace is the result of mercy. God knows that we are sinners....yet offers us (mercy) the chance to become perfect in his eyes so we might join him in eternal life.     Grace is a gift freely given. It is never earned.....but it does need to be accepted by a person...    Good works for someone who has accepted the gift of grace are to honor what God has already done.....not to get him to do something.    Christ paid a debt he did not owe....  Because we had a debt we could not pay.    That is grace.|`|AA11648578	Only Christ can judge either of them..we are not God. What we do know is those who are in heaven are without sin they have been made New by the atonement of Jesus Christ,    Edit    No one is saved by works but works do prove faith .It is through faith we bear fruit.|`|mLYFbStGaa	Correct.  Because the man you mentioned, though he may have done some things men esteem as nice, was still a sinner, and committed the ultimate offense by calling God a liar, and rejecting His son.  Whether he thought his good works would save him or not, we don't know.      And the woman obviously committed horrendous sin, but realized her need for God's son and forgiveness and humbly asked for it.  A humble spirit is worth more to God than a thousand good deeds.    Jesus came to save sinners, which we all are.  Those who are "good" in their own esteem have a hard time humbling themselves sometimes.  Not saying this man was that way, as I don't know him or his heart.  But pride does stop a lot of people from coming to Christ.|`|DytfqrkSaa	This is how messed up it is. Because according to the bible, the woman in jail really will go to heaven. And the man will burn forever in hell.     Now this is according to the Christian faith. If you look to the Jewish faith, from what I understand. They would both go to hell, but the woman would go to hell longer. Because her soul would be more tainted.    You're just asking for trouble by setting up this situation, but I'm curious as to see what the religious right wing nut jobs will say lol.|`|QtaPF83iaa	I couldn't tell you if the woman went to heaven.  The man probably did go the other way.  One of the best solutions I have ever concluded to is.  That once you repent and born again, you are born a new person and your past is washed away or your history is deleted.  Then the debatable part is that after the saving a person is not judged by their deeds and tally marks they give themselves but by their humility and willingness to drop and give everythingn to god no matter what it may be, even if it means leaving an awesome job to go to Canada to become a burger flipper dragging your family with you.|`|VR2biZutaa	The Bible says "For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God"  However this does not mean God intends for us to use this as a get out of jail free card, but if the women truely commited her heart to Christ, then yes she was saved.|`|fOfJz9OMaa	God is no respecter of persons:  But in every nation they that fear him, and work righteousness, is accepted with him.  Acts 10:34-35     The motives and sincerity of the heart is what God looks at; we see the things outwardly that are done, but He see what goes on inwardly.  This applies both to the man and the woman.|`|KmnbjZIdaa	The truth is, we can never be sure where the two ended up, in heaven or hell.  But let us see how we can make sense out of the possibilities.  The first one, an atheists, led a good life and in our point of view should not go to hell.  But the question is, can an atheist go to heaven.  Most likely not, even if God wanted to, because not having known God, the atheist will not be happy to spend eternity in heaven.  The atheist will reject heaven even if God offered it to him.  So he will just die and never resurrected, but not tortured the way we usually picture hell.      Let us now take the case of the woman who led an evil life but was converted and repented of all her sins just before her death.  Will  she go to heaven.  Yes, because her repentance and conversion is clearly the work of grace.  That a christian preached to her in not an accident or a random event, God saw to it that she will have a chance to choose heaven and she responded positively.  But there is a catch, in catholic doctrine, she will spend an awfully long time in purgatory to cleanse her of all her evil tendencies and during these very long time, she will grow in love of God.

C7umw5Vpaa	I would try to reason with him. But knowing that what he really wants is seeing people suffer physically and mentally (playing mind games of ''who's next?''), this would just be impossible. I would tell him since I don't have chance of living, since I'm at a concentration camp and people get tortured for the enjoyment of the mentally sick and I'm just going to die anyway, I would offer myself to be killed with my child/son. We both go. And that's it. But if that weren't possible and I would be pressured to do it, I would rebel until they get tired of me, and kill me with my child, as to their eyes, it would be punishment. So first choice, my way... Anyway.
LJ6vHfgoaa	My religion doesn't teach that non-Christians necessarily go to Hell:    Those also can attain to salvation who through no fault of their own do not know the Gospel of Christ or His Church, yet sincerely seek God and moved by grace strive by their deeds to do His will as it is known to them through the dictates of conscience. Nor does Divine Providence deny the helps necessary for salvation to those who, without blame on their part, have not yet arrived at an explicit knowledge of God and with His grace strive to live a good life.

This is my idea: condense your very confusing story into the most important facts...prepare to portray yourself as a normal, smart person (which I'm sure you are, your pain is making you write in a very scattered way right now). Write to all of the big news story shows and other shows and try to get on one of them. Hopefully you will get picked up by one and receive international attention and be able to see your children.

The fact is that this is a very sad but complex situation and sadly one to which there is unlikely ever to be a resolution that will please you.

He is probably dirty enough to give you bacteria infections because of all the women he's had. Also people who been with allot of people are crazy because they been with allot of people. Do you know how much energy it takes to get a new women in bed? He's probably worn out. I would run for the hills. Trust me he's not worth it and you can find someone better!    P.S  Be careful on who you let in your sexual life and your life period. You do not want their bad energy rubbing off on you.|`|Oi3GTByKaa	I would always be a little weary if he was going to stray. I'd just have to be confident that I am the one he is absolutely head over heels for. He'd have to prove it to me by actions. Also would have to put all the other women completely out of mind or it would drive me crazy and make me feel gross about sleeping with my own husband. If he is worth it and you know you are worth it, it will work out great.
dZMHd5PMaa	The Bible talks about those who will try to fool in the name of the Lord. It also talks about there will be some who will be lukewarm in the name of the Lord and there will be some who will be on fire.

Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?     Matthew 7:17Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.     18A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.     19Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.     20Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.     Notice Jesus says you will know them by their fruits. If a person is born again then they are a new creation in Christ. They will continue to grow in Christ their Lord.     So I am very careful when judging if someone is saved or not but actions will show a lot. Words will show a lot of what is in the heart.

AA11232725	The book of Revelation from chapters 4 to 20 have some parts in them that are not in order. For instance chapter 10 ends with...    Revelation 10:10  Then I took the little book out of the angel's hand and ate it, and it was as sweet as honey in my mouth. But when I had eaten it, my stomach became bitter.  11  And he said to me, "You must prophesy again about many peoples, nations, tongues, and kings."    Chapter 12 starts out by talking about Jesus being born and going up to Heaven. Chapter 17 talks about Babylon.    But if you want to find out about when the rapture is going to occur, look at passages that talk directly about the Rapture.    Matthew 24:29  "Immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken.  30  Then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.  31  And He will send His angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they will gather together His elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.    Is Jesus talking about the rapture or is He talking about some other "elect" whom the angels will gather when He comes?    1 Corinthians 15:51  Behold, I tell you a mystery: We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed  52  in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.    1 Thessalonians 4:15  For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord will by no means precede those who are asleep.  16  For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of an archangel, and with the trumpet of God. And the dead in Christ will rise first.  17  Then we who are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And thus we shall always be with the Lord.    Notice the similarities between what Jesus told His Jewish disciples and these passages written to Christians who probably were not Jewish. The sound of a trumpet in all three. In Corinthians it says the "last trumpet". People being caught up, or gathered up by angels. People being resurrected and and the living being changed.    Now with these passages in mind consider this portion of the book of Revelation.    Revelation 10:5  The angel whom I saw standing on the sea and on the land raised up his hand to heaven  6  and swore by Him who lives forever and ever, who created heaven and the things that are in it, the earth and the things that are in it, and the sea and the things that are in it, that there should be delay no longer,  7  but in the days of the sounding of the seventh angel, when he is about to sound, the mystery of God would be finished, as He declared to His servants the prophets.    Revelation 14:12  Here is the patience of the saints; here are those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus.  13  Then I heard a voice from heaven saying to me, "Write: 'Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on.' " "Yes," says the Spirit, "that they may rest from their labors, and their works follow them."      14  Then I looked, and behold, a white cloud, and on the cloud sat One like the Son of Man, having on His head a golden crown, and in His hand a sharp sickle.  15  And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to Him who sat on the cloud, "Thrust in Your sickle and reap, for the time has come for You to reap, for the harvest of the earth is ripe."  16  So He who sat on the cloud thrust in His sickle on the earth, and the earth was reaped.  17  Then another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle.  18  And another angel came out from the altar, who had power over fire, and he cried with a loud cry to him who had the sharp sickle, saying, "Thrust in your sharp sickle and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth, for her grapes are fully ripe."  19  So the angel thrust his sickle into the earth and gathered the vine of the earth, and threw it into the great winepress of the wrath of God.    It seems to me like the rapture occurs when Jesus said it would in Matthew 24.|`|aBHY2iXraa	Religion is all about interpretation. It is deliberately vague, thus allowing the priests to reinterpret the message as changes occur.

Enjoy  :)    At the end of days, there will be a one-world government, one-world economic system, and one-world false "unity" religion, all led by antichrist.     You can see it developing now. Watch out for those that are "globalists".    All of this is detailed in the Book of Revelation.     Chapter 6 and beyond is all yet future on the earth.

No details or further explanation has been given. All that's know is nobody has to wait for it anymore.    http://i209.photobucket.com/albums/bb62/...|`|LFWQiGYkaa	The Book of Revelations (and Genesis too while we're at it. We could add the prophecies of Jeremiah to the list, as well as others) are mystical texts. They don't treat correspondence the way a scientist treats correspondence (x symbolizes such and such). It's an anachronism to read them this way.    Mystics believe symbols, whether they appear in dreams or in prophecies are valuable in their own right. They don't need to mean anything. The symbol exists in its own right.|`|NaM4ZT64aa	The inspiration of the Bible depends on the ignorance of the person who reads it.-Robert G. Ingersoll    Pretty self-explanatory.    P.S. Since the Bible and the Church are obviously mistaken in telling us where we came from, how can we trust them to tell us where we are going?-Anonyous|`|Gp160xHOaa	I think the tribulations may come but only to a certain extent and then the rapture.|`|2k8TEiRtaa	Yes, the Book of revelation was written in a form of code used during the persecution of the Church while it's author, John was a prisoner at the island of Patmos. That's why it is difficult to decipher completely. Comparing it's prophesies to Matt:24 and The OT authors such as Daniel , Isaiah, etc. Is probably the only way to come to a definitive conclusion.|`|D4LnRg2Daa	Yea sometimes its a little hard to place exact events isn't it?  Especially when looking for evidence on the rapture it gets pretty iffy,  There is no real evidence on the rapture.  The one will be taken, the other left texts are found in Mathew 24 and certainly say nothing about anyone being raptured.  The word is not even found in the Bible anyplace.  So when we turn to Revelation and try to insert the rapture we certainly have challenges.  I've been trying to piece it together for years because I once believed in it.  I still concede it is a possibility but it certainly doesn't read well.  As Martin points out so well these texts point to Christs return, not a rapture.  I don't quite get Martins last statement about the rapture occurring exactly when Mathew 24 says it will as Mathew gives no indication of time other then that signs must be fulfilled first.  Revelation does seem to skip around a bit but we can gauge it by the seven last plagues, the seven trumpets etc.  which are in succession.  Love Kent.|`|bTA5ndeMaa	I have devoted a great deal of time to its study.  One key I found may be applied from about chapter 5.  The various trumpets, woes, bowls, seals, etc. all are literary devices that give order to the writing.  However, these literary devices are only that.  To interpret the material, the order of it.  The linearity of these devices must be ignored.      To understand it, one must look at the material and try to apply it to the world around us, to events.   Then when that has been accomplished, these need to be fit back into Revelation in their proper order.     Thus e.g.:    - chapter 13 seems to include the events of chapter 12, and the events of chapter 12 seem to include chapter 11, gradually zooming in to larger scale.|`|n1eXQr5oaa	THe Revelations is a self-proclaimed dream about the downfall of the Roman Empire and the 666 Beast (Nero)...    maybe read about something important next time...|`|dZMHd5PMaa	The fascinating thing about it is it tells us in Revelation that there were parts of the dream that John was instructed not to write down so I don't really know if the order that things are listed in Revelation is necessarily how it will happen but I firmly believe that everything in Revelation is coming|`|DR7mTpnXaa	...........................................  ....................................,....  .............................,.-........  .........................,/..............  .....................,?..................  .................../.....................  ................./.......................  .............../.........................  ..............?.....__...................  ............./__.(.....~-,_.............  .........../(_....~,_........~,_.......  ..........{.._$;_......=,_.......-,_...  ...........((.....*~_.......=-._........  ...,,,___.\`~,......~.,.................  ............(....`=-,,.......`...........  ............/.`~,......`-................  .............\`~.*-,.....................  ,,_..........}.>-._\.....................  .....`=~-,_\_......`\,...................  ...................`=~-,,.\,.............  ................................`:,,.....  .....................................`...  .........................................  ...................................,      ..,-~*`lllllll`*~,  ..,-~*`lllllllllllllllllllllllllll...  ,-~*lllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll...  ,-*lllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll...  .;*`lllllllllllllllllllllllllll,-~*~-...  ..\lllllllllllllllllllllllllll/\;;...  ...\lllllllllllllllllllll,-*..`~-~...  .\llllllllllll,-~*)_-\..*`*;....  ..\,-*`,*`),-~*`~..../  ...|/...//~,...-~*,-~*`;./.\  ../...///..,-,..*~,.`*~*.*......  .|...///.*`...\...).)`~,  .|.//./.),.)`*~-,.../.|..)...  /./.../,*`-,..`-,*`.,---...\./...  ...(.)`*~-,.`*`.,-~*.,-*|/./...  .*-,.`*-,...`~,..``.,,,-*.|.,*....  .*,`-,)-,..,-*`...,-*.(`-,...|`|tBwdVpG4aa	Proof that there were opium poppies on Patmos.|`|axiA5mMoaa	I believe that you are right, the book of revelations is not in chronological order.|`|P5Iq6nufaa	The problem with "rapture" and "great tribulation" is that there is no basis in Scripture, even in John's Revelation, to split the events of Jesus' return. The downfall of these beliefs is that they, incorrectly, split the Second Coming into separate events.    "Belief in a pre-tribulational rapture . . . contradicts all three chapters in the New Testament that mention the tribulation and the rapture together (Mark 13:2427; Matt. 24:2631; 2 Thess. 2:112). . . . The theory is so biblically bankrupt that the usual defense is made using three passages that do not even mention a tribulation (John 14:3; 1 Thess. 4:17; 1 Cor. 15:52). These are important passages, but they have not had one word to say about a pre-tribulational rapture. The score is 3 to 0, three passages for a post-tribulational rapture and three that say nothing on the subject. . . Pre-tribulationism is biblically bankrupt and does not know it" - Dale Moody, Baptist Theologian.|`|db7df25ea31227e5641d5c32d43c3bcdaa	I believe they are in order as they will happen. He stops during revelation and explains things that he talked about in previous verses.    He talks about the ruling empire that rules the world the rider on the white horse. He explains about this in later chapters.    The church age is listed in the first 3 chapters.    The beginning of chapter four he goes to heaven. The church is never mentioned again after the first three chapters. we do see the redeemed people saved in chapters four and five in heaven. Notice they have also received rewards because they are wearing crowns. They cast these crowns before the lord when they worship him.    Our rewards in heaven our crowns because of our service to God. We will sit before the judgment seat of christ to be rewarded for the service we did to God on earth. See 1 corinthians 3:9-15    Look in chapter 3 of revelation verse 10  Translated from the greek the greek words in our language today means;  because you keep unmarred the doctrine, of mine, with cheerful endurance, me, also will guard you from the season of temptation which is to come over, through out the globe or earth, to entice or tempt them that reside over the globe or earth.    Most people try to say that this was for this church only but the greek implies that it will cover the entire planet and all who live on it will face this season or time of trial except christians. The old english used different words then we use today.    The greek how ever makes it clear this will happen to the whole world and the saved will be kept from this time. They are not led through but kept from. Just as things in the epistles each church paul wrote letters to the churches he went to ,contain truths we follow and use today so do the things God promises to all believers and not just the church itself that John mentions here.    Of course critics deny that and even deny there will be a rapture. jesus said there would be one and warned his people to watch the signs and we would know about the time and be ready.|`|QLDMmp6Taa	I don't even think he's talking about future events mostly (if at all).  Most of the book is telling stories of the bible in a style we are not used to (which is the same style used in the Book of Daniel).  A large portion of it deals with the fall of the Roman empire (which basically marked the end of paganism being the major religion of the world).  John predicts that Christianity would grow and spread, but that the devil will deceive a lot of people.  When the majority of people try to destroy his church, it looks to me as if God will send fire down on the earth and destroy the people that do.

p8Mc6rpBaa	******* is the deviate pronunciation of the word N.egro. During the Trans Atlantic Slave Trade the Portuguese and Spaniards called the African slaves they acquired N.egros.  N.egro in Spanish simply means black. When the word was applied to people it was the first process in stripping them of the identity. Africans have always identify themselves by ethnicity. The word N.egro doesn't describe ethnicity of people or an explanation heritage or ancestry. It completely takes the uniqueness away from the individual. ******* was the southern White American's  lazy way of saying N.egro. The word caught on and has been given life and new meaning over the years.

How you've managed to lie to yourselves for this long is beyond me, frankly. It requires the complete disregard of mountains of evidence and testimony.    "I can assure you the flying saucers, given that they exist, are not constructed by any power on earth."  -Former U.S. President Harry S. Truman - Press conference, Washington DC, April 4, 1950.    "An investigator for the Air Force stated that three so-called flying saucers had been recovered in New Mexico. They were described as being circular in shape with raised centers. Approximately 50 feet in diameter. Each one was occupied by three bodies of human shape but only 3 feet tall. Dressed in metallic cloth of a very fine texture. Each body was bandaged in a manner similar to the blackout suits used by speed flyers and test pilots." --From a March 22, 1950 memo to J. Edgar Hoover from the Washington FBI Office, released in 1976 under the freedom of information act.    "I know that neither Russia nor this country has anything even approaching such high speeds and maneuvers. Behind the scenes high ranking officers are soberly concerned about UFOs, but through official secrecy and ridicule many citizens are led to believe that the unknown flying objects are nonsense. . .To hide the facts, the Air Force has silenced its personell."  -Admiral Roscoe Hillencoter, former director of the CIA, at a 1962 NICAP press conference in Washington D.C.    "The phenomenon of UFOs does exist, and it must be treated seriously."  -Former Russian President Mikhail Gorbachev (Soviet Youth, May 4, 1990)    U.S. Senator Barry Goldwater, retired Air Force Reserve Brigadier General and pilot. "I remember the case in Georgia in the 1950's of a National Guard plane going after a UFO and never returning. And I recall the case in Franklin, Kentucky, when four military planes investigated a UFO. One of them exploded in midair and no one knows why."    "Hell no, you can't go. I can't go, and don't ask me again." --Senator Goldwater quoting General Curtis Lamey's response to the senator's request to visit the "Blue Room" at Wright Patterson Air Force Base where, Goldwater claims he was told physical evidence exists confirming the existence of alien spacecraft.    "I've been convinced for a long time that the flying saucers are real and interplanetary. In other words we are being watched by beings from outer space."  -Albert M. Chop, deputy public relations director at NASA, and former US Air Force spokesman for Project Blue Book.    "The real danger to the U.S. and perhaps this whole planet is the government has placed such a heavy blanket of secrecy upon this issue. So much secrecy, those in government who have knowledge showing UFOs are identifiable feel the subject cannot be discussed by those in the know without serious repercussions. Others are afraid their friends and co-workers will think they are crazy if they even so much as insinuate that UFOs are identifiable as manned craft from outside the earth. This particularly applies to newspaper editors and publishers, reporters and analysts. Thus the U.S. is denying itself the chance to learn more about UFOs or to encourage research despite the fact the U. S. stands to gain from such discussions. . . .Not publicized but true is that the Clinton administration, soon after coming to office, had many briefings on the subject. Laurance Rockefeller provided the information for the President and Mrs. Clinton. Others provided documents and verbal briefings to presidential advisors Jack Gibbons (science), Bruce Lindsay (personal), Anthony Lake (national security) and Vice President Albert Gore. About the same time a three hour briefing was given by Dr. Steven Greer to the sitting Director of the CIA, Admiral Woolsey. . . .After the Roswell incident, the Air Force replied to reporters' inquiries that this was all part of research using weather balloons and other equipment. [Colonel] Corso and hundreds of others who work or have worked in secret defense and scientific agencies, are willing to swear under oath that alien craft are repeatedly penetrating our airspace."  -Sarah McClendon, White House Correspondent, and Dean of the White House Press Corps--    "We can no longer think... is it true? Is it not true? Are they truths or are they lies--if we believe or if we don't believe--no! There are already numerous considerations which make the existence of these beings into a certainty we cannot doubt."  -Monsignor Corrado Balducci, a Vatican theologian "close to the pope", who has been charged with studying reports of UFOs sent in from Vatican embassies around the world. This quote comes from one of Father Balducci's many recent appearances on Italian television.    "But I've often wondered, what if all of us in the world discovered that we were threatened by an outer - a power from outer space, from another planet.""In our obsession with antagonisms of the moment, we

In your example:  - El tiempo de prctica es de cinco y treinta a ocho y treinta p.m. (It isn't necessary to say p.m. twice).  - El tiempo de prctica es de cinco y treinta de la tarde a ocho y treinta de la noche.

Also I wouldn't recommend confronting your girl friend as most girls I know would only be annoyed with this kind of behavior.

03Xx7l8Baa	There are three categories of Tawheed. Tawheed coming from the Arabic word wahhada or wahid, or one. So Tawheed is literally taken as to make as one or (Islamically?) as to testify in the uniqueness and oneness of Allah.    1)Tawheed Rububbeyah  2)Tawheed Uluhiyah  3)Tawheed Asmaa wa Sifaat    1)Tawheed Rububbeyah means to maintain the Oneness of Lordship  2) means to maintain the Oneness of Worship  3) means to maintain the Oneness of His Names and Attributes    1) The belief that there is only one God for the entire universe; the One who is the Creator, Organizer, Planner, etc. And He is Allaah.  2) The belief that no one has the right to be worshiped except Allaah alone. (worshiping in all the aspects of course as we know)  3) Accepting the Names and Attributes that Allah has told us of and not adding nor twisting any or meanings of any.    And this is such a big topic and needs so much research and time and understanding. But in brief, that's what i can say.|`|PKUtKIRfaa	Allah is One...and only he is worthy of worship|`|efb24eedcf484b875157731a08fef57aaa	Tawheed is firm belief in Allah (SWT), the oneness of Allah (SWT), and that he is God.|`|mOWyzwubaa	Tawheed=Monotheism=Submission to Allah Allmighty,Total Obedience To Allah's Words/Commands/Laws|`|IbtQ5IKNaa	Oneness with Allah, 24hr camera|`|N8QLKpCMaa	M !         toheed means oneness, MONOTHEISM / UNITERIANISM !        surrah e ikhlas is revealed for towheed.        no god but ALLAH , he has no father, nor he is of any.        he is from none ,from he there s none !        he is the only one , the creater of all what lies in b/w earth n sky n    heaven or hell.       there should be one book , one god , one home one peace one code of  conduct for all,            ALLAH bless you and strenghten your faith !|`|QHo7Cw7uaa	illusion ,explained it well .    want to add few more points     Tawheed rabubiyat : even mushrikeen makkah used to believe in it ,    they believed that there is a Rub .

It means the realizing and maintaining of Allaah's unity in all of man's actions which directly or indirectly related to Him.    1) It is the belief that Allaah is One, without a partner in His dominion and His actions (Ruboobeeyah),    2) One without similitude in His essence and attributes (Asmaa wa Sifaat), and ;    3) One without rival in His divinity and in worship (Ulooheeyah/'Ebaadah).|`|IlkDE701aa	Monotheism.

Race doesnt determine things like that, race only determines skin pigment, some physical features, and some hereditary illnesses.    Edit---  Ya but if you wanted to generalize in that way, you should have said people that live in china, not chinese people, because there are tons of chinese people that live here in the U.S., and they may have no idea what you are talking about because they never lived in china and are completely within the american culture.

Your biological needs of reproduction are all the matter... there is no such thing as a connection.|`|aIcNLJFDaa	Connections are actually pretty over rated in my opinion.  We go through life searching for a connection that we don't find.  However, in time we find special people who we do connect to. How many people, or what type of connections depends on you yourself.The level of importance we give people seems to determine the connection we make.  For example, I feel extremely connected to my boyfriend, and when I met him I held high respect for his Old-fashioned ways.   Ive come to notice that I share no deep connection with my best friends. And I've come to realize it's because I find things in them that disappoint me or that I find disrespectful, such as how they can talk back to a teacher.   You may be picky about your connections too. And that's okay, as long as you remember that connecting to someone won't come easily but that doesn't mean they can't be a friend.   And once you do find someone to connect to, like this girl, then remember how important that connection is because of how hard it is to connect to people.  You should talk with her, get to know her, and eventually, tell her how you feel if you still share that connection.  If you'd like to talk more, contact me.

RgIFaQfWaa	a lot of people do not like to put a label on sexual orientation because it is never a cut and dry thing, but as far as your question is concerned it sounds like you could be what society would concider a "lesbbian". that being said, the first answer for this question was inappropriate but on its base level completely true. nobody, anywhere, can ever tell YOU what sexual orientation YOU are. i think you should ask yourself this same question in a year and see how you feel then.|`|UldvbAIWaa	take a shot with a guy than if u dont feel anything go for the girls|`|VxW1YiBiaa	do it to both gender and the one you like the most go with it|`|mtcTRXNBaa	If you are sexually attracted to only girls you are lesbian.

The leaders of all of our countries dont seem to have the common man's interest in their hearts. Only their apparent unquenchable thirst for more money for their immediate circle of what might as well be called nobles. I live in the great country of america, where now is standard practice to promote diversity and equality of all peoples and religions.|`|LfIw9R0iaa	What do I think about cultural dilution?  I think it's horrible.  It dissolves the bonds that hold societies together and it will eventually lead to the downfall of many first world nations.  Here in America the divide just keeps getting deeper and deeper and it's only going to end in violence.  We need to wake up to the fact that multiculturalism does not work.  One remedy would be to stop all immigration.  As it stands now, immigrants are not assimilating.  They move to new areas and the natives are expected to bend over backwards in an attempt at accommodating them.  If your not willing to assimilate, then you should stay in your own country, period.
ZtEVlc0yaa	2 Timothy 1:7  For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.    When I have the spirit with me, I feel peace, joy, and a sense of calmness.   As for what others experience, I cannot say.|`|d529cebfe13576f3ddee3e55b4cd08ffaa	Well, it's leaves hurt you and it's berries are probably poisonous.    Also there is not just one holly spirit, they come in separate genders, so there there is two.|`|Gp160xHOaa	Well I have never felt the holy spirit but my mother does.May I might add that it is the most touching thing I witness every time I see her have it. She tells me that it isn't something that you can control.While you are praying it is like something touches you and you begin speaking in tongues(different language).They say it is a gift that god gives you like a blessing.|`|xqn0U0H6aa	I never knew that Holly had a spirit? Oh...you mean Holly Hobby? Wait, wasn't she just a fictional character?|`|495e344229dc3bcc5dcbf3cd52fed97eaa	The Holly Spirit (usually called the Holly King) is the manifestation of the Green Man in Winter. His brother is the Oak King, who is the manifestation of the Green Man in Summer. Each year at the solstices they "fight" for dominion of the coming six months.|`|qEy34ueZaa	Holy Spirit, being the 3rd person of our Creator, must be properly capitalized. Your question: the Holy Spirit can manifest Himself in any faithful Christian in different ways: some may have the sense of a Divine presence within their minds, heart, etc. Others may feel a sense of heat runing through their bodies. It varies, and it can not be predicted. I have been given the gift of tongues (praying in what may sound as express-less words in a bla-bla-bla fashion, simply glorifying God). Many are given the gift of interpreting the tongues language. Others have the gift of Anointing/praying over others.  If you read the Bible, when the Holy Spirit descended upon the Apostles in the form of fire, they were heard speaking in their own native language to a multitude of people of different nationalities and dialects. All understood what was being said, and were stunned.  As for me, when I truly pray "from my heart" with arms stretched out, I feel the Holy Spirit as a tingling on the tips of my fingers, which is very common among us Christians. Without a faithful clean heart and mind, one will feel nothing. God gave us free will, and will not impose on anyone, unless He is invited. May God Bless!|`|NjPjpewlaa	Yeah, it's awesome!!  Really peaceful, and joyful, true peace and true joy.  and lots of clarity.  No, it has not been visual for me, just a feeling I can't see.|`|I5av9h9naa	Holly spirit...?  LOL  or did you mean holy spirit?    Nobody knows because there's nothing to know.... The holy spirit is the same kind of hogwash-idea as god.  Its nonsense.    You can feel safe to disregard every differing explanation you may hear on this question.  People tend to talk rather freely through their hats on this subject and none of them speak the full truth about it.|`|256t9bIqaa	I sense the presents of the holly spirit when eating candy canes, singing carols and decorating the Christmas tree.    Sorry . . . I couldn't resist the misspelling.      I felt the Holy Spirit a handful of times.    The feeling is one of complete peace.     And it is obvious that the Holy Spirit is there.    You don't have to make yourself believe something is happening.    Story time.    I met a man about 20 years ago.    At that time he was 88 years old.   He was a Chaplin in WWII under General Patton.   Judson was his name.    Judson was a friend to me in a time of my life when I had great stress.    He'd come over to my house every few days just to see how I was doing.       I tell you the truth.   The Holy Spirit travelled with this man.   I could sense that Judson was at my front door 30 feet before I got to the door to open it.    As I walked to the door, my anxiety would wash away.    Franticness and anger fled and peace took its place.    I did nothing.   I didn't even know that Judson was at the door.    It was very much a supernatural event.     After a couple of times, I learned what the Holy Spirit felt like.    It's now decades later.   Judson died long ago.   I have felt the Holy Spirit several times since then, but not to that degree.   I can also see the Holy Spirit around some people from time to time.   Seeing for me is also rare.   At this time in my life, I can only physically see the Holy Spirit around one person's face.   His presence is a fuzzy white haze--and there's always that sense of peace and all-is-well that goes with it.|`|8gi5gfOsaa	The holly spirit is unlike anything you could ever imagine when it fills your senses and comes upon you. It has these little red berries and shiny green leaves with prickly edges. It is very visual and you will know it is right when after taking a dump and wiping your backside with those shiny leaves, you don't develop poison ivy or oak!!|`|202da6e16e428763788627390b166485aa	It is a presence......and it is beautiful and wonderful.  I would not live any other way, but to be led throughout my day by the Holy Spirit.  If you have more questions feel free to contact me.|`|1de1c120b993c2d297eb9718fb158aebaa	the Bible says that the Lord left the Holy Spirit as our comforter, he is with us daily, for those who receive it. He is our conscience, that is why murderers don't feel guilty, they have no conscience, thus they don't have the Holy Spirit. He is peaceful, fulfilling and joy all at once.|`|M0IRADgWaa	I don't know if you've heard of this religion but I'm one of Jehovah's Witnesses. First, we don't believe in the trinity. we believe that god, jesus, and the holy spirit are separate. God is ruler, Jesus is his son, and the holy spirit is god's active force. Now, when you hear of people in modern times all of a sudden speaking in tongues, that's not god's holy spirit but an act of Satan the Devil. In God's organization, he uses holy spirit to help his servants endure through persecution and hardship, to draw people that want to learn to him, and to fullfill his will on earth. Say you pray to him to help you through, say the loss of a loved one. He will send his holy spirit to you and this great calm comes over you. It is the most peaceful feeling.

elVryMQUaa	When I was saved I was at my Christian camp. I was taking my lifeguard qualifications and there was another guy there who was having trouble making the time standard, I think it was for a 400m swim. Anyway I prayed for him a couple hours before and guess what, he not only made the time he did so by a huge margin. At that moment I realized what god was about selflessness and love. And that he loved us no matter what and we so important to God and he loved us unconditionally. It was a very profound spiritual experience for me and I felt the touch of God. I accepted him into my heart and really started to pay attention during bible studies. And started going to church regularly.    Of course I later realized it was all bullshit, and I was being a total idiot and now I don't believe in god.|`|Cmu3WM6kaa	My first earthly experience was with God the Holy Spirit at my baptism, and I don't believe in "getting saved."

A few years ago, after getting out of prison, I was finally saved. I went into a very humble little church with my sick auntie, and I found a place.  Eventually I was babtised, and it was a huge event! Everyone was there.  When I came out of the water I seen a light everywhere for about five minutes, and I felt so light and free. I promise!  For a couple years everything was fantastic, but sadly I have slipped back into darkness a few times. And payed the price.  Yet I won't forget how great that experience made me feel.  And I know I will be there again. I just know.

If you are actually innocent and wrongly accused, you might give a false confession just so they stop torturing you.
wSeOxs7Jaa	Picking out a label for yourself right now isn't important. Don't worry about it. Just explore your feelings and see where they take you. As far as finding some guys attractive goes - there are women who identify as straight who find some women attractive and women who identify as gay who find some guys attractive. You can think someone is hot without feeling like you could have the whole love/romance/sex package with them.

34l3iOqTaa	The good thing about Hindi is that it has separate words to express the nuances of love. For example, the love between friends is different than the love between lovers.    Pyaar-General love.   Mohabbat-Companionate Love. Loving with tenderness and affection.  Ishq-Passionate, intense Love. Someone in this type of love is called an 'ashiq'.    Remember that Hindi speakers use hyperbole (exaggeration) much less than English speakers, so don't use these words to refer to inanimate objects. For example, saying you 'love' that dress in Hindi ("mujhe uss dress se pyaar hai") will just earn you bewildered looks.|`|W1JSp0blaa	there isnt any difference as far as i know   all the words are used to express a feeling of love   so all three mean the same LOVE|`|N8eVM3nqaa	pyaar - love  muhabbat - passion  ishq - er.. lust?

6YJDYOdUaa	Be careful......altho it may be tempting to take her up on some of her offers, some people lure you into indebtedness by doing that. They need people to NEED them therefore offer them help. tips, connections, discounts, whatever, to come off as a real friend then when you start taking them up they are pretty quick to turn it around & *expect* things from YOU, & put a real guilt trip on you when you don't comply...& the way THEY want you to...most likely by throwing back in your face "After everything I've done for you when you needed it?!" & "Well, it was YOUR choice to take my offer, I didn't force you, & now you won't help ME?!"      That is one scenario of course but one I've come across before, & it was my 1st thought when I read your question! I've been around for a while so I can safely say this is not paranoid or far-fetched!!!   Also, the prescription thing is what threw me in this direction I think. A strange thing to offer, really, if you're a respectable person in a 'superior' position.    Another scenario is she is just a nice person. Take her up on something so she doesn't stop offering help (& be sure to offer kindness to her, too, without having to be asked 1st)  But step CAREFULLY & SLOWLY until your sure of her motives!    OR, she could have a crush on you & really just wants to impress you & get closer to you. That's very possible, too, but still not a good idea, given she is your boss!!|`|Qz3sii2caa	I don't think it's rude. If she didn't want to help then she wouldn't offer. Be sure you don't just accept her generosity without thanking her, even if it's just a thank you card or treating her somewhere. All depends on how much she saved you, meaning don't take her out to dinner for saving you a few dollars on a book and don't give her just a thank you card if she saved you big money on some big-ticket item.     Don't be greedy and accept every offer she makes though. I mean, getting a discount for an iPod, ok since depending what kind of iPod you're getting, they can be pricey. Discount for a book, probably not since what you saved using her discount will probably be spent buying her coffee, and then you'll have to find time in your schedule, etc. you're better off buying it yourself. Prescriptions? No way. That's medicine and both you and her dad can get busted, unless you end up being seen by him of course. But if he's not your doctor he can't write an Rx for you or smuggle you free samples. I mean what if you had a reaction to something? He can deny it all and you'd be screwed. Some help.     So you don't have to act on what's polite or impolite. Just go with your gut. Maybe your boss just wants to be your friend. Most of should only be so lucky to have a boss who actually cares about our personal to-dos.|`|c68XWGltaa	some people get off on that stuff....she probably enjoys being capable of getting deals on things.....sort of an ego boost for her|`|41fc520a4a56916bd52c4b45ddaffe65aa	The only way you are going to find the answer to your question is to actually take her up on one of her offers and see how she reacts.|`|R8fVBPnmaa	Well JUST in case.. & if you've gotten plenty of info `bout atleast some of the offers made.. Then try to use the chances only when you are in need !!. Also maybe you might want to except atleast ONE simple/friendly offer !! before a day might come that said person may start to feel/think: I'll just not make mention of this,that & the other !! because you'll just turn it away or down again !?! & why should I put forth the effort or offer.. & when a certain something might come about that you may even need !?! May not even be offered or made availible to you!?!  "JUST DO NOT GET GREEDY" !!!

If you feel bad for declining accept,but if you feel bad for accepting decline!    I think that you should let your conscience be your guide!|`|dYz5Gz1Raa	well since she keeps offering that means that she really does want to help you, she isn't just trying to be nice. I would be rude to decline on her offers all the time because she really wants to help you. Take her up on her offer then thank her later and let her know how helpful she was.

That right there tells you hes either gay or bi and probably just hates the gay stereotype label that comes with this lifestyle. Having girlfriends means nothing, heck people have gotten married, had kids and then admitted they were gay so it don't mean squat that he has had girlfriends.    JUST TELL HIM! and just ask him if hes not cool with this, to just keep this "under the wraps" until your ready to tell everyone. that's all i can say to you. your situation is much easier then mine in my personal opinion. Losing a friend is better then losing your mind.  Oh please answer mine: http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|aH2XXgh8aa	I think that you should definitely tell him. I know this is easier said than done, but I really think it will help! At first, it might be difficult for him. However, judging from what you have said, surely it won't be a complete shock. I think that you should talk to him and tell him that you two can work through this challenging time together. Just tell him that you are there for him and you hope he is there for you, too. I would wait on telling him that you have feelings for him, however, if he seems like he is having a hard time taking in the news that you are, in fact, gay. You don't want to throw too much at him too quickly! You can't really be close to someone, just friends or even more, if you don't know things like this. This is who you are. While this doesn't define you as a person, it is a big piece of you, the same way as being straight is a big piece of someone else. Remind him of this. Explain that you just want to have a healthy, open, and honest relationship with him. Accepting this piece of you means accepting you as a person.  Please let me know if you would like any more help!

T5DbLLgQaa	Learning language well requires being as active as possible and making the learning fun for yourself. Taking lessons is always important, but equally important are these:    1) Listen/watch: Listen to internet radio stations like BBC, watch TV shows in English (use only subtitles, NOT voice dubbing!), etc.    2) Write/communicate: Try to find discussion forums from the web about things that you find interesting (music/various artists, hobbies, etc.) and start communicating there with other people using English. Start using instant messaging systems in case you find some new friends or start emailing them.    3) Buy yourself a proper dictionary, and each time when you see a strange word that you do not understand, look it up.    The main point in ANY language learning is to make it as fun as possible for yourself. Try to find topics that interest you, read online newspapers, listen to BBC/NBC and other radio stations online, if you find a discussion forum for e.g. your favourite hobby or your idols in music do participate there, etc.     Last but not least: NEVER EVER use ANY online translators, they are nothing but utter rubbish!!

RJS6kJttaa	Session guitarist is an unstable job. It can and probably will change dramatically as everything can be done electronically now. There is also not much room to be 'good' as a session guitarist as creativity is not part of the job and all guitarists are expected to be perfect.    So the answer to your question: I've heard Los Angeles is a good place as it's pretty warm all year around so sleeping on the streets is not too uncomfortable.

qRFTEBlGaa	WHEN Jesus Christ was on trial before Roman governor Pontius Pilate, his answer to the false charges that had been laid against him was summed up in his statement, For this I have been born, .?.?. that I should bear witness to the truth. The governor replied with a question: What is truth?    Jehovah is the Source of spiritual truth. In fact, the psalmist David called Jehovah the God of truth. (Psalm 31:5; 43:3) Jesus acknowledged that his Fathers word is truth, and he also declared: It is written in the Prophets, And they will all be taught by Jehovah. Everyone that has heard from the Father and has learned comes to me. (John 6:45; 17:17; Isaiah 54:13) Clearly, then, those searching for the truth must be taught by Jehovah, the Grand Instructor. (Isaiah 30:20,?21) Truth seekers need to acquire the very knowledge of God. (Proverbs 2:5) And Jehovah has lovingly taught or conveyed the truth in various ways.    Therefore, if we love what is right and want to live in Gods new order, it is imperative that we walk in the truth. We should have the attitude of the psalmist who prayed: Make me know your own ways, O Jehovah; teach me your own paths. Make me walk in your truth and teach me. (Ps. 25:4, 5) Similarly, we should heed the prophet Samuels counsel to ancient Israel: You must not turn aside to follow the unrealities that are of no benefit and that do not deliver, .?.?. Only fear Jehovah, and you must serve him in truth with all your heart.|`|wZEGi1EHaa	good question, for which there is no easy answer.  be your own counsel.

HVM5aXa8aa	In response, I quote you, from an email you once sent to me.  <br>  <br>  "I think part of the thing we have to consider in terms of the gods being described in humanistic terms is that it is humans doing the describing. And it's humans describing gods interacting with humans. We don't have any other accounts of gods other than what humans have to say about them so we're describing them the only way we know how based on their interactions with us. "<br>  <br>  In that sense, yes, we have created a lot of what the gods are, because when WE interact with the gods, it is the aspects of US which have been implanted within the gods (or perhaps vice versa? which essentially is a question which reiterates your own, hahaha) which we worship - this MUST be so, since all we could ever know about the gods is what the gods are in relation to us, humans. <br>  <br>  In those emails you also explained to me the idea of "as above, so below", which you said was the concept of what is above is reflected below, and vice versa.  If this is an innate quality of the gods (which I believe), than the gods cannot be static, never changing beings; they must change, since the universe constantly undergoes change.  Because of this, the existence of humanity causes the gods to exist in a manner that is relevant to human life - and we worship in a manner which is relevant to the gods existence. However, the gods do not just interact with humanity, though our interactions with them chiefly focus on the parts of the gods which are relevant to us - there is a whole universe out there which the gods relate to, which is completely alien to us.  <br>  <br>  Thanks for the great question, I remember vaguely discussing this idea with you before. Essentially, I think the answer is yes - AND no.  It is both.|`|8f79a6907c34a502a5158ce4ade3c011aa	Yes i had heard that before.<br>  <br>  I was told that the reason Vercingetorix gave for surrender to the Romans rather than fight to the death was "If we die who will worship our gods? how will they survive?"<br>  So i was aware of the concept in the Gaulish tradition. <br>  <br>  Also i came across the idea in the novel "Small Gods" by Terry Pratchett.<br>  <br>  Not sure how widespread the belief is, due to my lack of knowledge on Paganism.<br>  <br>  _()_|`|KXQVRQdjaa	Very few Pagans believe this.  Some believe that the goddess and god are simply symbols that they use to tap into their own spirituality.  There are, then, Atheist Pagans.<br>  <br>  This is rare, though.  I think what most Pagans believe is that the goddess and god are NOT supernatural forces.  They are a manifestation of nature.  <br>  <br>  This could be a way to describe my beliefs, but a rather misunderstood one.  Almost all the Pagans I've talked to (LOTS!) believe that the goddess and god are very real forces of nature, evolving with nature rather than having created it, the pantheons that have been worshiped over the centuries were created to mirror the cultures they existed in.  The goddess has shown herself to cultures over the years, and they both divided her into her various aspects, and projected their own culture onto her.  They make her look like their people look, dress like they do, and give her a name that means something in that culture.  In other words, they are all worshiping different little bits of the same natural deities.  In that way, humans did create the gods.  There is a diagram in Silver Ravenwolf's Teen Witch called the Diamond of Divinity that shows this very well.  I hope that helped, Em|`|21808938a2c954ea0389683f10267c69aa	I've run across that belief before, and I used to subscribe to it more than I do now.  It shows up in some popular literature as well (Neil Gaiman's American Gods come to mind).  Nowadays I believe that the physical and spiritual worlds develope simultaneously: there was no fire before a fire god and no fire god before fire.  So changes in the world affect the nature of the gods (and vice versa), but I no longer focus on that change being limited to human perception and projection.|`|2e8a9bfb5d022abc1ae72b43960c416caa	I've heard of that belief, but I don't follow it. I think the Gods would be here whether we were or not.|`|24H5tznkaa	:)<br>  <br>  Years ago I bounced back and forth with that idea but my experiences kept showing me that they are very real.  <br>  <br>  I do however, as a Pagan, have an unpopular view about demons though. I think that these entities exist in the lower astral realms but only because our thought forms created them. I think that realm might be what Christians view as hell *shrugs* I'm not to sure on that one. I just know that there are some very dark entities out there and not all of them are just lost souls, some of them aren't souls at all. <br>  <br>  Many Pagans say that demons don't exist...and in a way they are right because they aren't a part of the Divine, we created them...I just think that there is more than one truth in our Universe and that both things can be correct points of view at the same time...it's just being viewed from different perspectives. This is of course, only my opinion. ;) <br>  <br>  Anyways, at this point in my life, I am pretty certain that all the Gods and Goddesses are as real as any one of us, they are just somewhere else and they are able to assist us through the realms. I also think that on a soul level, we know each other but we have spiritual amnesia. We see them as Gods and Goddesses but they are our friends and family. For whatever reason, we are here and they didn't come along but chose to assist us from elsewhere. <br>  <br>  The reason why I don't accept the notion that the Gods and Goddesses were created by us and not really real is because I don't think that as humans, with our flaws and our egos...we could pull off such a thing, without those beings carrying our flaws and egos as well. <br>  <br>  A great example of this is the Triple Goddess Brigid. I absolutely love her! She is wise, she is strong, compassionate...she can assist in your darkest hour and yet...I have never feared her...I have never been afraid that if I pissed her off she would show me her bad side. You know what I mean? I could say the same for Hectate. How could humans manifest a being like her, who is so good at doling out justice rightly and fairly, when we haven't accomplished such things here on Earth?<br>  <br>  Sorry this is so long, I find this topic very interesting. :)<br>  <br>  *edit*<br>  <br>  For the record, I don't always agree with the myths that are attached to Gods and Goddess...most times I think that we created those stories, although they may have been Divinely inspired for their metaphorical qualities.|`|NsLtN7oLaa	Anderson began as a cynic, who later found quite<br>  a bit of comfort with pagan ideas... later albums like<br>  Songs from the Wood, Heavy Horses, Broadsword <br>  and the Beast show this evolution.<br>  <br>  To answer your question about deity, I'll give my<br>  opinion (very briefly)...<br>  <br>  In the beginning man recognized the Goddess. She<br>  was absolutely genuine and still is. Later there was<br>  an invasion... the Kurgans conquered Europe and<br>  the Middle East, and introduced a false war-god,<br>  designed to sanctify their acts of violence. From <br>  the forced union of the Goddess religions with the <br>  violent and false war-god sprang all of the pantheons <br>  of deities  we now think of as "pagan", most of which<br>  of course have a violent male war-god at their head.<br>  <br>  In the end, the followers of the most violent and evil <br>  war-god (Yahweh) got control and jealously destroyed <br>  all of the other religions.<br>  <br>  So, there was only one genuine deity (the Goddess)<br>  and everything that came afterwards was created<br>  by man and is false. The current crop of war-gods<br>  (Yahweh, Allah, etc) are the worst and most horrible<br>  of the lot... but since religion was (and is) profitable, <br>  it attracts thieves and murderers... and the worst of <br>  them naturally forced their way to the top.<br>  <br>  Just my opinion, of course... <br>  <br>  Jean|`|aTFJ5TM2aa	god,gods,superheroes,devils,etc ,all these characters either represent what humans aspire to be or in our worst moments the depths to which we  fall.<br>  along the way they've evolved into the perfect proto-human which begun everything or will tear everything down.humans seem to have an inherent need to have something represent that which is greater than us and in some ways be a source of knowledge beyond our own.<br>  examples of this need to worship is evident in religion,myths,legends, ghosts,UFOs,astrology and even the cult of celebrity.|`|fd5f2954d03f8ed32926400fe1b18cfcaa	I've never heard anyone say that outright, but it wouldn't surprise me.

I'm still ambivalent on that one myself.|`|6938f354823450032243cd5ddb6f0ef0aa	I've heard the theory, though I don't believe it. It's a basic idea of a tulpa, golem or similar. Interesting though.|`|gxWYcxa3aa	I've heard that idea before, and while I don't necessarily follow it, I do think it's an interesting debate topic.|`|IDcIww7Baa	I personally do not believe that, but I know some who do.|`|Kbry7CnOaa	I can only speak for myself not others, but I think many pagans would be of a similar mind. Many of us believe only in these Gods/Godesses in an archetypal sense. Many covens may identify with a specific God and/or pantheon which best relates to their specific goals and identity.<br>  <br>  I believe is that as archetypes they are products of the mind, so too is the assistance they provide. Archetypes are used when a particular type of magic/assistance/power is needed. If one needed to cast a fertility spell for example, one would invoke a particular fertility goddess which seemed most appropriate to that particular scenario.<br>  <br>  I do believe that their are intelligent entities without a physical body which can be sensed/worked with, from the material plane. I am yet to decide whether these could be the Gods of old, who, like the old pre-Celtic England have been reduced to something akin of 'faerie-folk' due to the loss of their followers/believers, or merely just spirits of varying powers such as is believed by native cultures across the world.<br>  <br>  I also believe in an all encompassing force (which can be called God) although his/her exact form and purpose is not something the human mind can comprehend, and this is where all material and immaterial things have originated, via evolution and the big bang of course (Science and spirituality can go hand in hand). <br>  <br>  It is this all encompassing force which, having given rise to all that exists within the material world, has given rise to the immaterial entities which inhabit this universe<br>  <br>  Very few people I know actually believe in Thor or Zeus as an actual intelligent, separate entity running round Mt. Olympus, although all belief systems have variations within them.<br>  <br>  In a nutshell, I'm not sure, but I my beliefs lean more toward the archetype theory rather than them being 'gods' in their own right. But whatever the situation, I believe that we have all sprung from a singular origin and therefore ultimately we are all one and the same. <br>  <br>  And if ultimately we are all one and all of one mind, I don't think it really makes much difference anyway....|`|R8yelFG7aa	I'm neo-pagan in nature and worship but can't help but believe Jesus loves me, so feel free to disregard my view.<br>  <br>  Personally, I believe that deity(ies) exist independently from human consideration.  I'm a biology-chemistry major and even though biological evolution is  the best explanation we have for the diversity on the planet, the likelihood that original life could have come into existence by some colossal accident is statistically improbable.  I believe that there is some entity that exists not only outside of physical being(s), but completely beyond our comprehension.  I not only believe it intellectually, but I feel the reality of it in my spiritual self.  The things a person can find in common with god/goddess/gods are there because all of existence was created by deity... like an artist expressing him/herself  though art, a parent passing on traits or ideas to a child.|`|AA11937917	basically, yes, any personification of divinity is a human-made convention.<br>  <br>  the analogy I like to use is that we all draw faces on an infinite beach; some people confuse the faces they draw with the beach itself.<br>  <br>  humans like to see stories - and ourselves - in almost everything. So of course we craft our impressions of any possible divinity in forms related to ourselves. It's hard to relate to something completely alien (i.e., an infinite beach) unless we find a commonality, an aspect we can feel attachment to.|`|BLnXhWoTaa	i think we create them to a certain extent.  some of the archetypes are beyond our ability to manipulate, but a lot of lesser gods are the result of our collective imagination.  caffiena comes to mind as a created goddess.  i don't think it makes her any less legitimate because i believe that the universe is a mental construct, and the collective consensus of our minds [and the minds of higher and lower entities] shapes it.  for me, the gods emerge from among the ascended beings of the deific plane in response to our needs.<br>  <br>  edit: lol @ siva.  'small gods' was a revelation for me.  tho, i've departed from the idea that belief feeds the gods.
VnT2wz2laa	It is God that has revealed His many names.|`|NaENZSJRaa	no there just dumb and dont want to feel inferior to a higher power|`|axylPYftaa	what do you mean?? people didn't give him a name.  they just called him God|`|x2eVGruAaa	By the way its not different names, its different languages, otherwise they all mean Almighty God.|`|t1NTGuIZaa	He was called "God of Abraham [or Isaac, Adam, Jacob, etc], so that people knew that they were referring to tho "One" god.  His real name [like Scott or William would be to us] is not known by man....|`|Lk4aCBACaa	I honor quite a few deities... they mostly like to be called by their own names. :)|`|UlQEgJrDaa	''God'' is a title, and the Bible mentions there are many gods, actually Satan is a god too, anything that is worshipped is a god. People didn't give God a name, that's why most christians just call him God.    Gods real name is Jehovah, which is important to Him,as in the model prayer, which says........''Our Father, who is in Heaven, Your name be kept Holy......etc (Matt 6:9-13).    However as I mentioned earlier most don't know or use Jehovah's name .  Also in Rom 10:13 states ''Everyone who calls on the name of Jehovah will be saved''  Think about it would you like everyone to call you Mr/Miss/Mrs or some other title?  If that did happen, would you not think that whoever called you only by a title, would love or even like you, if they didn't or wouldn't use your name. By not using ones name, makes a person remain anonymous, would we like that?|`|k03dYskYaa	People did not name God. They could not have comprehended such a concept of what is name means. Jehovah means "He Causes to Become" Psalm 83:18 shows that God purposed that his one name be known to mankind.   The rest of the things people commonly say are his name are titles that can apply to Him. Or they may be making something up like you imply.  Also there are false gods that people have named.|`|HWoLbR7Aaa	"God" isn't good enough. I call him Steve.|`|IbtQ5IKNaa	That is why he called himself Allah.    So any name you decide to make, there is no greater than ALLAH!|`|U24VtSlZaa	"God" is a generic term;  it's just a matter of tradition that people following the same god refer to their god as "God", but God needs a name in case you need to communicate more precisely.|`|ysVNRN6Laa	Oops!                  There's only one God!|`|54fdf2affdc8dc366315eec2cecd5920aa	Polytheists, of course, had to name their gods so they could distinguish one from another.  It's my impression that the Israelites leaving Egypt with Moses, didn't quite think there could be just one God; so they wanted his name, and God told his name to Moses.  In time they understood that God couldn't really be confined to a name, so they ceased to pronounce the name they had been told.  But they had to call him something, and they gave him a zillion creative titles and nicknames to show their awe, respect, obedience, love, allegiance, and wonder.
21e2df8fa47efbcd44eaee35a303bd20aa	I like how people are so adamant that abortion is completely wrong no matter what.... I would like to see how they respond to how people in other countries treat unwanted children (they leave them unattended in the country-side until they die) That is why it is so rare to see people in foreign countries with disabilities.    No one has the right to dictate what someone else does with their own body. Im fairly certain that 98% of these pro-lifers have never had to walk in the shoes of the people who have been faced with the decision of abortion.      **to those saying that everyone who has an abortion is selfish... I find it more selfish to bring a child into this world not knowing if another family will take them, or knowing that you cannot take the best care of a child possible, or knowing that they will never live a full life due to things like Down Syndrome, muscular dystrophy, or another dibilitating disease.   It is better for someone to never know life, than to live life suffering, completely handicapped, and reliant on others.|`|45a2d78be5d5ed4c4b9533acffae073baa	You're suffering under a delusion if you think that legal abortions don't result in suffering and death of the woman.  Just a couple of years ago an abortionist in my area was put in jail because a couple of his patients died from the abortion that he performed on them.  This is not unusual.  You don't hear about these results because of the lack of supervision, oversight, and reporting of abortion clinics.  They are so unregulated that they can do virtually anything they want and not have to report it.    Since these clinics have so little regulation they can be dirty, have incompetent staff, and be nothing but abortion mills.  Abortion clinics are run to make money for the owners.  These things are big business and are highly profitable for the owners.  They do not care about the customers and their welfare is secondary to the bottom line.    As a matter of fact, deaths from abortion have increased since abortion has been made legal--but don't expect to hear that from Planned Parenthood or the newspapers.  That kind of news isn't exactly "politically correct."|`|54fdf2affdc8dc366315eec2cecd5920aa	I confess, as an imperfect human being, that I would feel a strong inclination to murder the man or woman who murdered my daughter and grandchild.  But being a Christian, I would not do that.  I would report the crime to the police and let the criminal justice system work.  You know, when abortion was illegal, even the woman who had been victimized by the abortionist had the right to call the police and have the miscreant arrested.  We've lost a good deal since abortion was declared a "right."|`|mt68kvWwaa	To me, abortion is not a matter of right or wrong, life or death, legal or illegal, but a matter of practicality.  Our current system is set up to fail the ones who need it most.  We have abortion clinics to provide a service for those who cannot accept such service because it requires parental consent.      So leaving my feelings on the practice out of this (as much as i can) i would feel terrible, that i did not have the kind of relationship with my daughter that i should have.  When i have children, I want to be financially secure, even in excess, because even in marriage there are unplanned pregnancies.  I want my children to know that I will always be there for them.  If my teenage daughter told me she was pregnant i would make sure she knows what options she has.  I hope that in such a situation i would have the financial security that worse case scenario i could adopt my grandchild, or at least have tewporary custody, so i could try to help my child get to the point where she could take care of her child.      I'm Christian.  I understond that discipline is required to raise good children, but children make mistakes, and that is just a shame on the parent in such a circuwstance.|`|3SYnZEZ9aa	Probably most pro-Lifers in the US are Christians.  We are pro-Life because we are against murder.  People are pro-Choice because they do not have hope.  When we are in a situation over our heads, we ask God to help.  Even though things look bleak and impossible, we rely on God.  And you know what?  He sees us through.  You unfortunately cannot do that, because you do not know God.  So you believe a lie and think that your best option is to take an innocent life.   There is hope for you, the door to God through his son Jesus is still open.  Take hope, faith and life!|`|1de1c120b993c2d297eb9718fb158aebaa	well, I'm raising my daughter to not be selfish, to understand she has other option, and to value the life of others...not to mention....if you don't want to get pregnant...use protection or don't have sex.... it is selfish to think that you can just throw away a life because you don't have enough common sense and self control to not get pregnant in the first place. I think I would be more understanding if it were a medical necessity, but because that wasn't your argument, you leave us with only the option to assume you just don't give a darn about anything or anyone but yourself and your choices..what about that baby's choice?|`|XmJZkFuMaa	I would basically smack myself for not being there, watching over her beforehand to help her not have the opportunities to get pregnant, and watching over her afterwards to get her the help.  I'd smack myself for her getting the wrong message.  That while all life is precious, hers is also precious and that there is always hope so long as there is life.    However, I honestly don't think it would happen.  As I plan on talking to her about abortions when she reaches an appropriate age, talking to her about why I'm against it, talking to her about adoptions and things of that nature, and even explaining if she had an abortion I'd still love her so there would never be a need to hide it.      Except possibly hiding the fact that she had sex from her dad.  At least until I could break it to him so he wouldn't get the gun and go after the boy... if anything to give the boy a headstart.  I don't want my hubby going to jail over some stupid teenage boy.|`|Qz3sii2caa	I would cry and grieve for my daughter and grandchild.     I'm not a Pro-Lifer, but I don't think my sadness would change even if I was. Whether I agree with abortion or not doesn't change the fact that I love my child and her unborn baby.     But I'm sure you're trying to make a political argument out of this, but it really shouldn't be. Regardless of who is in power or the laws that are changed on behalf of a woman's right to choose, we all have to take personal responsibility for ourselves. You have to do your best to educate your children about sex, birth control, STDs, etc. It's all you can do; we were all young once and we didn't always do what was right, even if we knew the possible consequences. You think all pregnant teens are pregnant because they're stupid and uninformed? Not at all. They took a risk (as most "it-won't-happen-to-me" kids tend to do) and they lost. Even people who've used protection or been on birth control have gotten pregnant. Sh*t happens.     Don't blame the government, blame yourself. I would; I failed my child if she thought it was better to risk death than give birth to a child.|`|eO2rnf7yaa	I'd be crushed, and I'd feel like I did a terrible job of raising my child if she chose to kill her child rather than come to me to help her.|`|XsTJPMHqaa	I would mourn.    For my daughter. For the fact that, despite our open communication about sex, Church teaching, and my unrestrained love for her, she felt she couldn't turn to me in this time of crisis.    For my grandchild, who never had a chance to see what a beautiful place the world can be.    And for the fact that her story would be turned into nothing more than justification for the killing of more innocent children.    It is quite arrogant to assume that I haven't thought through these types of scenarios, and don't realize that myself and those I love may very well be hurt by standing up for what is right and true. Not everyone who believes differently than you is a mindless sheep.|`|0f6a1cdae0a3ce3617b1109a091741bdaa	I would of course feel terrible. And I would more her loss greatly and would no doubt blame myself in part...because if I had done my job in the first place, she wouldn't be financially and emotionally unstable. She would have known that she could come to me in all situations.    But that doesn't change the fact that abortion is wrong. This world always makes excuses for itself. We challenge God's laws to suit our needs and manipulate his words to fulfill our own agendas...but the truth is the truth...and only GOD speaks absolute truth.|`|cNniG2L0aa	I can't get past those who ask: how would you feel if you were the aborted fetus?  *gulp*  Fetuses, aborted or not, have NO operational brain; they don't feel; they don't KNOW anything.    Of course, the spin doctors and drama queens doing the bidding of their misogynist religionists, can't be educated cos it's an emotional position which can NOT be reasoned with.  ~|`|A9vvZ6eUaa	They don't care.  They want control over you and your body.  Especially your Uterus.  But make sure you don't drop that baby off on their doorstep.  It is going out with the recyclables.|`|pakIAYWoaa	maybe we should legalize bank robbery so none of the robbers get shot, how would you feal if your daughter got shot robbing a bank?  there are consequences for doing something that is wrong, i would grieve and lament her poor choice but in life we need to take responsibility for our actions..|`|VYWaL2graa	So, "because people will do things illegally if they aren't legalized" is a good argument for keeping baby killing ok?    Why is this argument valid for baby killing but not valid for gun ownership? Why is it ok to legalize killing babys, because if you don't, then people will die as a result of doing it illegally? But if you outlaw gun ownership, it is assumed that no one will have guns?|`|6jAVElX7aa	you as her mother, should have stood by her, and not advised her to get an abortion. If a girl knows her mom will stand by her, and is glad to have a granddaughter or grandson, then maybe she would not seek an abortion.|`|xqn0U0H6aa	Pro-lifers annoy me with this garbage that all people who are pro choice are baby killers.  I wish they would just shut up and leave the President alone or move to Iraq.  I will never become a republican whether I go to church or not so quit getting your hopes up.|`|QPbnFJGKaa	It would hurt me deeply.  I know that this won't happen, my daughter and I have a great relationship and she knows she can come to me about anything and I won't condemn her.  A good parent wouldn't condemn their child, they would lovingly guide them in their life.  If she were to become pregnant I would help support her decision on whether she wanted to keep the child or give them to a loving family who couldn't have children.  Communication is important, letting them know that if they were to get pregnant you would be there for them.    To Stevie:    I have been faced with abortion.  My doctor recommended it with my second child.  He feared that I might die giving birth to my son...my thought process right away was not my life but my son's life, I would have given my life for him.  Giving him the chance at life would have been the greatest gift I think a mother could give a child.  After deep prayer and reliance on God, my pregnancy and labor went fine there were no problems at all.  I could have killed my child out of selfishness but I didn't, God blessed me and my child because I was willing to give my life for him.|`|A90SRsTxaa	I think I would vomit a lot if I did that bad of a job raising my daughter.|`|e76YTRiBaa	Pro life is nuts.     We've got a limited number of resources; why should we be forcing people to have children they won't even look after properly?     Life is a continuous cycle; there is no 'start' but if we're going to be smart about it there's no way an unborn foetus is ever going to miss it's life if you abort it. And you can say that it could have been the next Einstein or something but such claims are neither here nor there.|`|xTriyfWuaa	would serve her right for going against gods will.  even though god in the old testament showed virtually no concept of value toward life.

I wish that most parents would be more open minded enough to realize that their teenagers, boys or girls, might have sexual intercourse, even though they know you don't approve ot it. We as parents need to decide do we want dead teenagers because they were afraid to talk to us about being pregnant or a teenager who is alive with a child. That child could be put up for adoption for someone who can not get pregnant or be raised by another family member?|`|db7df25ea31227e5641d5c32d43c3bcdaa	I would be grieved that they choose to disobey the law and try to have it done just because they were not willing to face the consequences of their actions.    It would not change my mine about abortion because some one chooses to kill a baby because they chose to act irresponsibly and not wait until they were able to care for one.    I would also seek to have the person who performed the illegal abortion charged with two murders. The babies and my daughter.    A child under age and is unstable can not make a clear rational decision on their own. Hence that they allow this now is another reason why abortion should be banned.    to every one who says we should just shut up.    every one has a right to a opinion in a democracy  Why do you feel that your opinion killing the baby is the only correct decision and no one else can have a different opinion.     This is america not a communist country. If you object to others being able to have a different opinion maybe you should go to a country that only allows what the government says and gives no one a choice.|`|AA10504008	*sighs* If you're teenager is emotionally unstable enough that she feels the need to have an abortion done in circumstances like that then obviously you crapped out on parenting.     The answer is not killing unborn babies. Like it or not, that's what an abortion is folks.     The answer is educating the children before it becomes an issue. If they know how to avoid becoming pregnant and their parents are open to discussion about contraceptives then abortion should not be an issue for teenagers.
YnG0Tjxjaa	I don't want to down your beliefs or anything, but I believe that we are all beautiful creations. We are not born of sin. I don't believe in the big man in the sky, instead I believe that we are one collective consciousness that is capable of undying eternal love for one another. I believe when our time in this world is done, we head back to our collective consciousness and we experience eternal love once again.|`|8q4RhpZWaa	There is no god damn it.|`|ZpNt4uPFaa	some kind of mental illness.

But think about it this way, it's Satan, and DON'T let him win!  I love this because everytime I kept with God and praise and lean on Him, I know the Devil is writhing!  Here are a few verses or phrases that help pick me up when I'm down :)    Psalm 35: 17-18    "LORD, how long will You look on?  Rescue me from their destructions, my precious life from the lions, I will give You thanks in the great assembly; I will praise You among many people."         Hebrews 11:1    "Now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen.         Ephesians 6:10-13 (Spiritual battle)    "Finally, be strong in the LORD and in His mighty power.  Put on the full armor of God, so you will be able to stand agaisnt the devils schemes.  For our struggle isn't agaisnt flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, agaisnt the powers of this dark world, and against the Spiritual forces of evil in the Heavenly relms.  Therefore then, take up the full armor of God so that when the day of evil comes you will be able to stand your ground.  And after you've done everything, to stand."         "In the end everything will be okay...If it's not okay, it's not the end."         "It's just a season."         "Now is the time, now is the hour, to be with GOD and all His power."         The last one was actually half from the movie "The Craft"  which is about witches...but I switched the last part around and made it quite lovely|`|MeEAPsSLaa	i love you. you very cute|`|4LbTpgijaa	He doesn't.|`|lJPFlcOTaa	its like that quote- that its our godforsaken right to be loved- and thats about it..|`|MVXQv33gaa	god loves everyone, including frog-faced broads like you.|`|2eCmyfH2aa	Ask some poeple in Sudan that question.    oh yeah they dont have computers... or food.. or family... or hope.. but they do have God's love    and thats all they need|`|SEVbfUyeaa	Depends on your religious belief but from what I hear god cares for you as you would care for a pet.

God does not make no junk, so therefore my girl, you are worth something and you are loved. God died for us-that is how much love he had for us. He even loves all those people who feel the need to call you down with their idiotic answers.|`|h56ccHJGaa	Since I was young I've been told a story, Noah, after the flood saw a pile of bones, he then said "blasphemes" and god said to him "Noah, make me five of the best pots you could make" so Noah began to work and finally the next day he had five of the most beautiful pots, he worked so hard on them and he felt so proud of his work. As soon as he finished, God sent a gust of wind and broke the pots, imagine how Noah felt, imagine how you would feel. In your basis of religion, Christianity, you believe God created you in his own image. However in my basis of religion, Islam, God when creating us, he blew into us a spirit, therefore in every human there is a part of God, which is why animals respect us, why angels respect us, and why the devil (who was an angel) hates us, but that's a different story.

Second, how do you define rude?  Are you special or what?  Sometimes it is the way that we project ourselves which causes others to behave a certain way towards us.      I have never had that problem when I traveled in Europe, but then again I am not ghetto either.|`|897f9782bd9356ff775df4cf6a07496faa	Most likely because you are American.

When I didnt have euro to make the long distance call, people gave me the money.  When I was carrying a big lugguage up the stair, someone ran down to help me with that. When I bought the fruit from a grocery vendor, the old lady gave me addtional fruit free. All in all, they were really nice.    Was it because I was a female foreigner or because I am a petite asian woman who didnt intimidate them at all. idk.    Edit  :  @  Dani    You are wrong.  Italian men live with their parents the way as chinese people live with our parents. It is the family value.    My boyfriend lives in an apartment 5 min from his work place. Every weekend, he moves back to live with his parents.

When I said "f*** you!" in shock (I didn't mean to swear, it just came out because that hadn't happened to me in YEARS anywhere), one of the men responded "Prego!" to me and was smiling evilly....it really made me sad that they would ruin my day that way.    All of the other Italians were very friendly except for a few salespeople who acted disgusted when we wouldn't buy anything from their store.     I think some of the Italians may have a love/hate relationship with tourists trampling all over their country -- great for the country's income but generally most of them are stylish and cultured (and know it) that they are probably sick of uncultured Americans and other uncultured people coming over and invading every corner... can't really blame them if you look at it that way?    Anyway, our closest friends are Italian! And we are definitely not uncultured and don't appear that way. It just happens sometimes.    P.S. I'm sure that we Americans are much more rude to Italian tourists, than we are to them...

Mar 1:15  And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.     the gospel is the gospel of salvation not baptism in water and repentence.    Act 2:38  Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.     this is not water baptism but baptism of the holy spirit. water baptism does not save you.    Joh 1:33  And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.     jesus baptized with the holy spirit.        Act 18:25  This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in the spirit, he spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John.   Act 18:26  And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him unto them, and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly.    here a man had only the baptism of John and repentance.  They took him and instructed unto him the way of God more perfectly. That shows that the baptism of John and repentance does not save you.|`|dX8qCoJ3aa	The Catholic version of repentance is far from its actual intention. Do you really think Jesus wants us to treat men as if they were God? Baptism is also nominal anymore    The Catholic church has successfully made itself a fallacy. They preach Christ and claim there are things you must do to get to heaven. By making these claims, they are denying the free gift of salvation.|`|C1SOqQSkaa	It occurs to me that Jesus could have cleaned up completely if he'd mentioned the Cross even once while he was alive.

All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all    John 3:16-17 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.    John 1:29 The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold   the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world    John 15:13  Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.    John 10:17-18  Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again. No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself.   I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father.    Many people do not make the connection between Isaac and Christ, or they misunderstand.    Abraham and his promised son Isaac ( Genesis 22)    6 Abraham took the wood for the burnt offering and placed it on his son Isaac, and he himself carried the fire and the knife. As the two of them went on together, 7 Isaac spoke up and said to his father Abraham, "Father?"         "Yes, my son?" Abraham replied.         "The fire and wood are here," Isaac said, "but where is the lamb for the burnt offering?"      8 Abraham answered, "God himself will provide the lamb for the burnt offering, my son." And the two of them went on together.     Isaac was the only promised child of Abraham, a fact which the Quran agrees with (cf. Genesis 17:15-21; Surah 11:69-73, 37:112-113, 51:24-30). Ishmael was never a promised child.     Isaac was conceived miraculously to a barren mother and a very aged father, with the Quran likewise agreeing (cf. Genesis 17:15-17, 18:9-15, 21:1-7; Galatians 4:28-29; Surah 11:69-73, 51:24-30). Ishmael was conceived normally without the need of any miraculous intervention.     God promised that it would be Isaac's descendants who would inherit the land given to Abraham. (Genesis 13:14-18, 15:18-21, 28:13-14). Ishmael had no part in the inheritance and promise given to Isaac through Abraham.|`|1fb7aea767ff3f9acc21f4f310b2ee94aa	The gift of eternal life is free, paid for in full by Jesus' death.  Jesus conquered death by rising up again.  The ONLY thing that we must do to receive this gift is to:  ACCEPT IT!  Believe that Jesus is the Christ, that He died and rose up from the dead and you will be safe from the coming destruction.  Tell others about this and you will be spreading the Word.

rOWMQuVVaa	Print up foreign currencies?  Are you nuts?  You don't think a trillion dollar government theft scheme would be caught by a foreign government?       Besides, I think you're a little confused on how currency works.  Yes - money represents goods, but the correlation is loose.  The only reason money is stable is because we don't do things like this.       You can already see, we put out too much of our own currency and prices are going up.    I guess this question was probably a troll - but just in case you actually thought that was a good idea . . . .|`|tQsxsuNPaa	Ummm, because it's ILLEGAL!!!

And the engraved plates are impossible to get!     And the inks are impossible to get!    And there are precautions taken against the ability to forge money...like the colors are impossible to match!     It isn't about photography, or ordinary engraving and printing technology.  It's about morality, right and wrong, world economy collapsing, and what is legal.

Simba....    animals in the wild suffer pain, when a lion bites its prey it dies a painful death. we humans also kill animals, its just that only nowadays butchers predominantly see and kill the animals. people of other culture, they are from poor countries that do not earn enough money to buy already prepared meat, they kill the animals themselves. lol i skewer a pig and people skewer ducks, a dog is no different, just only a metaphysical belief that pets should not be eaten......ummm..........cows are raised and eaten....arent they pets too in the poor countries lol|`|41fc520a4a56916bd52c4b45ddaffe65aa	Were you disgusted by the smell of them burning the hair of the dog or the fact that they were eating dog?

It also has prophecies that have come true 100% of the time. Such a feat is impossible by human efforts alone, which to me is evidence of its Divine inspiration. No other holy book on Earth can make such a claim. Even books like the Koran and the Book of Mormon claim to be written by a single man inspired by a single angel, which automatically makes them suspect, because a single man can write anything he wants and claim it is from God, and be unchallenged by peers, and Satan himself can transform himself into an angel of light, easily deceiving that one man. Add to this the fact that both books contradict the writings of the Bible, so they cannot possibly be from the same "god". Adding again to this, both Mormonism and Islam have Masonic roots, and Masonry is a Luciferian cult, which shows how much Satan wants to spread confusion and discord - by making lots of other contradicting religions to draw people away from the One True God.|`|u3KhqAVvaa	You're in error in several respects.<br>  <br>  First, you don't "believe" in the Bible.

You have to decide though whether you want to interpret that as a literal meaning or not. For, if not, you could take it as one of the many metaphoric teachings in the Bible. Or if you decided to take it literally, they did do such a thing back in the older days of Israel, if one of their household blasphemed the Lord and his word they were punished severely, and even put to death if they did not repent.<br>  <br>  We (Christians) believe out of faith, if you do not have faith, if you do not WANT to believe, truly believe, then you are not one of God's elect people and the Bible will have no interest to you no matter what me nor any other Christian says to try and make you interested. <br>  But, if you do have faith, if you do want to believe, the you should pursue it.

QgE85Qynaa	Technically it has only been claimed that the head of John the Baptist is in the Ummayed Mosque in Syria. There are plenty of countries which claim to have possession of the decapitated skull, however, Damascus is the most likely (the majority of the other sites being located in Spain).    Damascus was (and to some extent, still is) the place where every major governor (Roman and local) would've had a pleasure-palace or summer house. Herod, the king responsible for executing John the Baptist, probably would've had the head transported to one of his Damascus residences. Exactly where the head went from there is a mystery, though some believe that it was moved to be put on display in the Roman temple of Jupiter in central Damascus (parts of which still exist). Eventually, a christian church was built on part of the ruins of the temple of Jupiter, and that church later became shared by Muslims and Christians who used it as both a Mosque and a church. Eventually, the Christians moved their places of worship elsewhere but the head supposedly stayed buried in a stone casket within the mosque (part of this casket is still visible). Since the Muslims also consider John the Baptist to be a saint/prophet, they had no reason to move the skull and according to most Syrians, the skull remains in the Mosque.|`|wR1XyyrUaa	2000 years of history happened to it.

PeeIS28Oaa	And so, Brigham Young stated his words are as good as scripture. Later Prophets say no they aren't, and here is why... So, Brigham Young wanted all the people to take all his sermons as scripture even though he didn't have authority or revelation to tell him to do so. What kind of person wanted his people to believe everything he said? Obviously all this documented statements made by Brigham shed some light into his character. Obviously if someone makes up a story and tells it to you and clearly wants you to believe him or her what do you think that person is... A story teller? Or a liar? If he/she just told the story and wasn't expecting me to believe it... that makes them a storyteller. But if they want me to believe this story as truth... that makes him a liar. So wasn't Brigham Young a liar on many occasions? Not to mention all the prophets. If the prophet is telling you something but you don't consider it true. According to the LDS religion the prophet speaks for god. So when he isn't speaking for god and may suggest something that god doesn't agree. But he expects you to believe his word as if it was god's. He is a liar, and a conman... And the defense is look at what other religious leaders do and say. This makes it forgivable for some??? A liar is a liar is a liar. Stop giving your money to an organization that is trying to control, mislead. Give it to a true charity for a change.|`|0T3weRh5aa	Are prophets infallible?<br>  <a href="http://en.fairmormon.org/Fallibility_of_prophets" rel="nofollow">http://en.fairmormon.org/Fallibility_of_...</a><br>  <br>  What is official LDS doctrine?<br>  <a href="http://www.fairlds.org/apol/brochures/doctrine.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.fairlds.org/apol/brochures/do...</a><br>  <br>  The Seer is heretical declared by the First Presidency in the 19th century<br>  <br>  Books written by general authorities aren't official doctrine, but are opinions by those who wrote them.<br>  <br>  The Journal of Discourses are talks by various speakers in the 19th century but not doctrine just like general conference talks today.<br>  <br>  Official doctrine is our scriptures, plus anything made by The First Presidency.|`|OLnmXeWDaa	My great great grandparents listened to Brigham Young's speeches.

Hard to have a R&S discussion on differences if I don't know where you stand.<br>  <br>  This is as clear as a window pane to me, but only if the window isn't clouded with anger.<br>  <br>  I ran into this same issue in Biblical study when I was challenging Christians as an atheist... well, as a hell-bent anti-theist about 10 years ago.<br>  <br>  I often asked Christians about 1 Corinthians 11:5-6 and 14:34 when Paul says that women need to shut up and cover their heads:<br>  <br>  "But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth her head: for that is even all one as if she were shaven."<br>  For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered."<br>  AND<br>  "Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience as also saith the law."<br>  <br>  I would ask, "why is this not taught, but other things in Corinthians are considered scripture?"  The answer I would always get is, "Oh that was commentary for their time and doesn't apply today"<br>  <br>  Christians (LDS included) believe that prophets are not God, but the mouthpieces of God.  <br>  Like the White House press secretary in today's world: <br>  when he speaks for the President, he only speaks the will of the President.

While there is much to be gained by studying and learning from the words of earlier prophets, they are not the final authority on God's will for us today.  <br>  <br>  Prophets:<br>  <br>  teach eternal truths<br>  teach words of wisdom<br>  teach customs<br>  share their opinions <br>  teach God's will for the people.<br>  <br>  While eternal truths are unchanging and will not contradict each other, opinions may.  God's will for us today may not be the same as God's will for us in 10 years.  The 9th article of faith makes it clear that things can, do, and will change.  We see the same processes over 4000 years in the Bible.  It is a dynamic, not static book of teachings.  <br>  <br>  Lastly, most of the quotes that you're "wanting us to use" we do read, we do study, and we do gain insights from.  However, they're also very frequently taken out of context and manipulated to in an effort to make them look like they say something that they do not.  Many of these quotes were directed to a specific group of people and not the church at large.  We do have lots of things that are considered scripture and hard doctrine.  But not everything is.  Why do you care anyway?  You're not LDS anymore. <br>  <br>  Joseph Smith prophesied that members of the church would leave the church, but that they wouldn't leave it alone.

Certainly they can be used, but not for doctrine or as scripture as they are not either.|`|AA10637643	Let's separate what is counsel and what is doctrine.  Start by doing that and then you may get your answer.<br>  <br>  Doctrine comes straight from the Lord, then through the prophet to us.  We know it is doctrine when told it is a revelation or "thus saith the Lord" type things.  When a prophet is speaking, unless he says "this is a revelation"... then he's giving his counsel.  And pretty much most of the time, the counsel is great.  Sometimes he is giving his opinion... and sometimes that can be a little off.  So, it really all comes down to - if you are questioning what the prophet is saying, ask the Lord and then you'll know.<br>  <br>  Is what not clear?

I thought my brother would be happy about the di vinci code, but that is not taught anymore  so he could car eless that another book says that Jesus married mary.

But there are some hard hearted people who God turns over to a reprobate mind and because of the things they have done there is no way for the Holy Spirit can call them.  All I can say is God forgive them for they know not what they say.|`|3SYnZEZ9aa	Q. Who do you turn to in a Crisis?   A. God!|`|x6CnkpQkaa	I turn to God in all things.

Why do you seek to plant yourself your gods place?  For it is written that only he knows everything of everyone at anytime.    If you say you don't then why the words "I KNOW if you faced a life or death situation.. all of you would cry out to God. Why is that?"    No atheist believes they are immortal or invincible or all knowing.. please tell me ONE atheist on this site that has made that claim.  It is possible for a person to have inner strength, and not attribute that to YOUR god, it can be sparked by a memory, by the image of someone they care for, by the words of someone that inspires them.    And why would you bother praying for people you obviously dislike? lol "I really pray that each one of you who are diluting (I believe the word is deluding) yourself will be enlightened to what is true.. by the grace of God."

Here's how I deal with a crisis ... 1) Expect the worst possible outcome, and plan accordingly.  2)  See rule   1.    I've wanted to die for at least 25 years ... just never got around to it.  My 8-year-old daughter (the light of my life) is the only thing that keeps me alive.      If something ever happens to her (she dies, etc) ... THAT'S the END.

I turned inward and almost gave up, but I didn't want the bastards to win so I fought and I survived.    You CAN do it alone. You HAVE the strength to endure all adversity. You need not pray and beg and plead because after you realize nobody is there, it may be too late.    Freedom from dogma is blissful. My life is good. I look out for myself, I do good for no reward, I follow the law so I never get in trouble. I believe in reincarnation so I don't fear death. No god is in my life.

God made it easy and sent us messengers and prophets to show us the way and tell us why... so all the messengers and all the religions are from the same only God, so they've got to be complementary to each other, not opposing each other!!! then God must have said His final words in the last message, what is the last message? and how do we know it's the last one? I guess that would be the religion that believes in all messengers and all books equally... is there such religion? actually yes, Islam does :)  A True Muslim (man or woman) gets his reward for obeying Allah's orders (Allah means The God in Arabic) by going to heaven, where he/she are indulged forever in all the good thing s that were on earth and more, things no one ever dreamt of or heard about. The Holy Quran tells Muslims (men and women) there will be good food, good wine and sex in heaven for all, but not in the bestial way you may think of, but rather in a way that is satisfactory for everyone and better than what was on earth. Heaven is no heartbreak or injustice land.  True Muslims are no terrorists, and Islam never calls for that, Islam means peace, it bans violence unless you were fought so you fight back, it only doesn't require Muslims to be cowards, and true Muslims understands this very well and never attack civilians.   Islam is the only religion that accepts freedom of religion and asks men to treat women gently like queens.  Muslims don't deny Jesus, they believe in him, love him and respect him so much.  We believe Jesus is NOT dead till today; he wasnt murdered or crucified as most people think. God made the man who betrayed Jesus be killed instead by switching their looks for a moment. Jesus was left up to live in heaven until the end of days when he will come back to earth, make justice prevail instead of oppression, fight the imposter and perform his last prayer before he really dies like other Prophets. So we're waiting for you Jesus, Messenger of God, to bring the world peace and pray with us. Thats what prophet Muhammad told us and this is what I believe in, Im a Muslim  so how do we know it's true? what is said in the last message and what should we do? read the following, and you'll figure out for yourself:|`|ebqQAzk1aa	I think every human being is born knowing that God exists, but society drives this basic knowledge out of most people.|`|WvI5rgieaa	The trees , sky , wind stars everything|`|fcb47ba6b3d558e424fe13d64318ea8caa	God is a Spirit.

5b4debdc05e5ee3ab6d3afb1e669dc76aa	Imperfection is an arbitrary human concept.  The Buddha's awakening saw that everything in the universe was perfect as it is -- our thoughts and perceptions define the 'imperfect'.  We look at complex organisms and define life in a certain way - we take it for granted that disease, decay, cognitive differences, etc. are all signs of imperfection ... even the term 'disease' is a concept that we humans use to define a state that is somehow antagonistic to the concept of the self we hold.  If we remove our concepts of ourselves, life, and everything from reality, there is no imperfection.  Just things as they are.  <br>  <br>  That said, the fact that we are at the level where we think of ourselves with these concepts, the imperfect is the window to questioning and, therefore, gives us the means to have an experience that tells us the truth.|`|58c68357a6985dd46819f99634e68a03aa	do you own a red mustang?|`|9395ac7491daf267219c151f4dd582b5aa	remember how many times Paul asaked 2 have the thorn removed from his sid e- God did not. imperfection points us to a desire for a perfect and Holy God.|`|AA10133509	i dont know|`|AA11694226	Imperfection isn't what starts adventures, Sometimes the most perfect things have actually started many many many adventures..and curiosities...-winks-|`|c5684c1eea9174757697f60cf1f073b2aa	agreed without imperfection we wouldn't see perfection or look for it for that matter xx

Also, I forget his name, but Grace was dating a guy that turned out to be bi.   Remember - when she first started to date Ben she was also dating the guy that would never say what he wanted to do but always catered to Grace's wants? She was trying to decide between him and Ben when Will said to pick that guy while Jack said to pick Ben.

He does not need witchcraft, or magic or illusions.    (SHEEP WITH A SHOTGUN)  Moses had no power of himself to split the Red Sea.  He simply obeyed God, and God split the waters.

You begin to think you are better off than the next guy and would likely to exploit them when you have a chance.  In other words, you will know the tree from its fruits.

This is a human male trait not a god one.

Oftentimes it is dangerous to make your own point without a basis specially when you are talking about something beyond the ordinary. Non-believers for that matter have their knowledge taken from authors of references most of the time or from people they respect to have the authority to learn from and some are knowledgeable enough to discuss matters from their researches and experiences. Most often than not the experience of the believers draw more attentions to be doubted rather than being believed because his facts could only be proven by his own faith in the experience.

But I think you're kind of missing the point.  Religions are based on faith.  That means "belief without seeing."  The scripture in question is all that a believer needs.<br>  <br>  As for non-believers, I think it's precisely because they say they must see something to believe it that they need to answer that question.  It's kind of a "put up or shut up" type of thing.  You demand proof from the believers, so you'd best have some proof for your non-belief.<br>  <br>  As for belief being the norm...it's only been in the last 200 years or so that, in the Western world anyway, religion has not had some major say in the government.  Religion was the norm because it was a policymaker, and anybody who was openly non-religious wound up being burned at the stake or something equally gruesome.  And while that's not true anymore, the faith has been passed on, and many more people are religious than aren't.|`|eddf2c7c18c3c71099e60960010d2a13aa	SImple, Religion came first.

Your views are what's known as "Situational Ethics" and it totally against the Truth... and yes... there IS RIGHT and WRONG, and NO, it was NOT created by humans.

I like everyone else have a system of what is right and what is wrong but it is not something to "believe in" like a religion because in life what was wrong yesterday might turn out to be "right" tomorrow.     "are humans just being ignorant to suit their own needs?"    I don't think people consciously choose to be ignorant even when they do and most of us do tend to suit our individual needs out of our survival instincts.|`|lh2H5oSOaa	Are you asking a question or telling us your beliefs.    God Almighty has given  us a conscience which distinguishes good from the bad. He did not make us like animals. On the top of this built in faculty, He sent thousands of prophets with Covenants or Codes of Coduct which specifically tell us what is right and what is wrong.    That only harmful and unpleasant things have been made illegal, proves the truth of faith in the Merciful Lord.

So you are trying to tell me that if I broke into your house and killed your spouse, and raped your daughter, it wouldn't be WRONG!!!!!!  You are plumb crazy.  I"ll tell you this, you come into my house and do something to any one of my family members and  you will know it was wrong before I get done with you.     Common sense tells us that some things are wrong, and some things are right.  Even if you do not want to believe that God wrote the knowledge of right and wrong within each of our conscience as I do, any person with the slightest amount of gray matter between their ears must admit that there are things that are just wrong, and there are things that are just plain right.    Where do we get this knowledge from?  If left up to humans, it would simply be a matter of what each person believes.  However, it did not come from us, but from God Himself.  He gave each of us a conscience to know what is right and wrong.  He gave us the Holy Spirit to convict us of righteousness and evil.  He gave us godly law makers (or at least we had some at one time), to govern us.  And He gave us all a brain to know that these things must be allowed to govern us, or we would become a society without any boundaries....destined to self destruct.|`|QVFjO5m0aa	Well as you said right and wrong are relative terms.

The reason things are right or wrong in our minds is because within each one of us exists a conscience or Sense of justice.  We all borrow from the Golden Rule in this regard.

God created us AND the notion of right and wrong. How the hell would human beings create that concept? ALL human beings have a different opinion of their own "right" and "wrong". However, your statement "there is nothing in the world that states that something is as it is" (probably the only true thing you've written in the question). This world is the thing that is the illusion. People get sucked into believing lots of things that aren't true. Such as: going to school is mandatory, working at a job is compulsory, making money for retirement is the most important thing the average person needs to do, among others. All lies. All "man-made".     Summary: humans are behaving as humans do, they are being "natural" and do what they want because of a LACK OF discipline, not because they are being 'pissed off or feel safe'. They don't have God in their life. Period. When God is in your life, your question's issues are not even a thought.|`|MU8Z9pIPaa	there are things in this world that are just set like everyone knows if i stole from you 5 dollars is wroong coz i have no rihgt to take it from you, but if you give 5 dollars to a poor person everyone will think its a right act to do coz your helping a person or your creating a smiel on someone elese face..     if your still not convinced.. i wana ask you can i kill you for no reason???    and let me tell you there has to be some wrong actions and wriong things so that we can appreaciate the right good times..|`|KrdOKdJcaa	Yes, I believe in right and wrong. The creation of right and wrong ensures that we can live our lives and not be in a constant state of fear. Right and wrong, and morality in general, goes hand in hand with community and society. It exists for us, and not for animals and the like, because we have a higher awareness of the world around us, and a higher state of consciousness. Right and wrong have existed since early societies, and while we may constantly be tweaking it, the basics have been pretty consistent from the beginning. Treat others the way you want to be treated.|`|bb36da531f52295c9bf659cf5df21b79aa	Yeah, childish certainties such as; right or wrong, black or white, good and evil. It's all in the eye of the beholder. Opinions, bigotry, bias. Besides, people forget about the subtle gray areas. Examples: I can't afford medicine for my dying child, is stealing it really wrong to save their life? Is murder wrong if it is in self-defense, and your life is in danger? Your own bias will determine your opinion. What does opinion have to do with truth? Absolutely nothing!!! So the answer is no. Because everyones opinion is different. Opinion is not truth.

At best, such claims are fraudulent and you will only be wasting your money; at worst, you could find yourself entangled with occult spiritual powers that will deceive and harm you.<br>  <br>  This is why the Bible repeatedly warns us against any type of occult practice. The ancient world was filled with all kinds of superstitions and occult practices, but God's people were warned not to let themselves be influenced by them. The Bible says, "Let no one be found among you who sacrifices his son or daughter in the fire, who practices divination or sorcery, interprets omens, engages in witchcraft, or casts spells, or who is a medium or spiritist, or who consults the dead" (Deuteronomy 18:10-11).<br>  <br>  Instead, I urge you to turn to God and seek His will for your future. God loves you; He loves you so much that He sent His only Son into the world to give His life for your salvation. Why not trust your life into His hands? By a simple prayer of faith ask Christ to forgive your past and come into your life today.<br>  <br>  Then commit your future into His hands. I can't promise all your problems will suddenly go away—but I do know this: It's far better to face the future with God than without Him. Don't follow the wrong path in life, but follow Christ instead. You'll never regret it.|`|81ce8fc06e11149869860f71cb7ee933aa	Maybe she has true psychic powers but the fact that she charges so much for a reading, $800 for 20 minutes is what I understand, tells me she has sold out.

The only doubt is whether or not she is fooling herself as well as other people.<br>  <br>  As someone commented, she, like the other so-called psychics use a technique called "cold reading" which basically teaches its practitioners to keep throwing out suggestions until someone grabs hold of one and then they (the sucker) fill in all the details for her.  <br>  <br>  Trouble is, the technique often leaves the practitioner high and dry if the questioner doesn't give enough the "psychic" enough information to base their guesses on.<br>  <br>  And wasn't she the one who said the miners were alive and they were all dead but one?|`|AA11570293	About as real as any con can be.

Some foreigners tend to come to Brazil and have an attitude of superiority upon the Brazilian population as if since Brazil is still a developing country and still a little bit far from other economies and societies such as north american and european ones, the people of Brazil wouldn't deserve the proper respect.<br>  <br>  I don't usually think that about a foreign before I know him, but I also wouldn't be surprised to discover this attitude once knowing him.<br>  <br>  3. I feel fine. Brazil has a wide variety of religions and everyone seems to get along pretty well, respecting each other. One journalist once said that "In 25 de Mar?o [a known Brazilian commerce street] is the only place in the world that a Muslim can go to a Jewish shop, buy something and leave with no trouble at all. And besides that, he even gets the right change!"<br>  <br>  4. Treating the Brazilian people with the proper respect, being polite and well educated, demonstrating sympathy and willing to learn, discover and immerse in the brazilian society is very well seen by everyone over here.<br>  <br>  5. In the larger cities such as Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Curitiba, etc... you would have pretty much the same activities as NY, for example. Theaters, night clubs, parks, etc. Tourism is also a great oportunity, Brazil has a wonderful coast with hundreds of beautiful beaches.|`|5f5388a8b3c788266f7fa2eb926493d7aa	1. How do you view members of different cultural, ethnic or racial groups? What adjectives immediately come to your mind about some groups?<br>  R: Brazilian, in general, do not have problems with different cultural, ethnic or racial groups. Normaly, when a foreign person arrives, has a very good handling. Brazilian make an effort for speak the language to the visitor feel well<br>  <br>  2. Do you have stereotypes and prejudged expectations about how other groups (which are not Brazilians) will behave? If yes, give me some examples.<br>  R: No. This problem there is not in Brazil.<br>  <br>  3. How do you feel about members of different religions than yours ?<br>  R: Brazil have many different religions. catholic, protestant, muslin, Jewish, spiritualistic, afro-brasilianas the major religions on Brazil. They live together very well<br>  <br>  4. What advice would you give to a new immigrant coming to live in Brazil?<br>  R: Brazil has complicated cultural issues as: nobody respect the law, drive in Brazil is terrible, dishonesty and violence. You will need to take care about it.<br>  <br>  5. What are your favorite leisure activities when you are off from your job? Why? <br>  R: running, bike, barbecue
kH6HL5smaa	1.  My favorite Saint is the Blessed Mother (Mary).  Because she was so obedient to God without question.  2.  My favorite Pope was John Paul II.  I think he was a very likable man who reached out to the people.  3.  It is the Prayer of St. Francis.  I love what it says and means and I try to live my life according to it.  4.  Knowing that I can attend mass every day of the week if I want to and that we celebrate all 7 of the sacraments that Christ gave to us.  5.  I was born into the faith and raised Catholic.  the more I learn about it the more I love it and know it to be true.  6.  Christmas, because it is the beginning of the life of Christ.  7.  Following all of the rules,  because I am human and sometimes fail, which causes me to feel badly for being weak.  8.  Providing faith formation to our children at no cost to the families.  I think that alot of families do not bring their children to faith formation because of lack of funds and embarrassment to ask for help.  Christ said "You received without giving and you are to give without receiving."  If we would follow this teaching the Church would grow stronger.<br>  <br>  God Bless...|`|1TYZDRUqaa	OOOOH, IJR is telling!! You owe Y!A R&S 40 points!!!!

AA10221225	For the war? I think everyone is entitled to their own opinion. I am against war of all kinds simply because in any war, there are casualties. Does they world really need people to die, just so that the government can gloat about their big win, and what good they are doing? Yes I am for the soldiers, but not the war. even if the only people to actually die were honestly bad people, think about whose lives their death would affect?<br>  Even bad people (most of them) have someone in their lives who either loves them, or is close to them. their death would affect the lives of the people left behind. hate breeds hate.<br>  As for drugs, I honestly do not know which path is right? On one hand, if you keep them illegal, more people will be shot, raped murdered, abused, and forced into prostitution, mafia, gangs...you get the pic, just to get to the drugs and keep the money coming in. But if they were legal, and easier to get, yes alot of people will get hurt because more people will be able to abuse them, but if you compare it to food, as in food sold from some shady dude out of the back of a van as opposed to food sold fresh out of a store which is safe and has benn inspected, what would you choose? most people would go to the store. it would be like asking a dealer if he has some tylenol instead of your pharmacist. is it real? is it safe, is it the right brand? ect. some illegal drugs can save some lives, but most can kill, or hurt everyone it touches. maybe we should leave that one in the doctors hands, not the dealers.|`|b1fa431ff52ddca763b3b2db03e4e634aa	against the war in Iraq. It was started as an oil fight and now innocent people (americans and non americans) are dying each day.<br>  For legalization of marijuana. It is a drug that can be used to heal or help with many medical conditions, and it is not physically addictive . Focus on the war against the serious drugs|`|AA12365118	1. Against the war in Iraq. To me it was an "optional" war. IT did not apply to tracking down Osama Bin Laden, and now it has created a tone of war for other nations. Iraq is now a hotbed of terror and violence that we are stuck with to babysit a bunch of people who did want our "help" to begin with.<br>  Also, I do NOT understand why Saddam could not have been removed from power without bombing the country and innocent people to do it.<br>  <br>  2. Drug Legalization? I don't know about that one. Alcohol is a drug, and it is legalized. It used to be categorized as an illegal substance. A lot of harm comes from drug use, but our prisons are also over filled with people who got caught using drugs, and I don't think that serves any purpose, except when violence is involved. Prison should be more reserved for VIOLENT CRIMINALS. I do understand that people can commit crimes of atrocity without violence that deserve imprisonment, but our prison population is out of control and needs to be looked at.<br>  If drugs were legal, it would become an intense trade. Yes, taxes would be paid, but people would be upset who are now profiting more off of a black market trade. I don't have enough knowledge of the domino effect it might have in order to give a strong "yes" or "no" opinion overall.

cd87c1cf515692ef0adc60a28df772b0aa	I agree with people saying they think it'd be nice if you wrote a song for her, too, but I also love the guitar idea. Since your girlfriend likes playing guitar, obviously a guitar is a nice gift, and this way she'll have an acoustic and an electric guitar. I disagree with people saying to give her the new one or to sell this one and buy a new one for her. Give her your used one. As long as it plays, it'll be the better gift by far, if you ask me. Not only can she use it to play just like the new ones, BUT as a wonderful bonus, it will mean more than a new one because it's one that is connected to you even more. I think like one of the other posters said, this is something that has been very special to you which should make it even more special to her. My friend once dated a guy who played guitar and I thought it was really nice when he gave her a pick he liked to use a lot, and she put it on a necklace to wear. That was special to her because it was so connected to him, and I think the fact that it's your old guitar, would make it more important to anyone who cared about you. Trust me, if she cares about you, the old guitar that you used and loved, trumps a new one. Wonderful gift idea for your gf.|`|Ws663hBVaa	You should totally do that. Hahaha. That is so sweet.

uohDGXwCaa	Even though what you did is wrong, Jesus will forgive you. As a Human race none of us are perfect we all make mistakes so your not alone in this. If anything you should talk to you wife about it and try to avoid arguments. The first step to overcoming is to talk to her and you sound like a loving man and I believe with time she will forgive since what Jesus would want her to do. If you tell her exactly what you wrote here she probably will forgive you I would but remember it will take time.     I hope I was any help|`|eb71d539c6860290e80bdaa4253a2f87aa	Jesus would want you to admit your mistake, ask forgiveness, forgive yourself and then never commit that sin again.    Once you forgive yourself, everyone else will be more inclined to forgive you also. A person who walks around wracked with guilt is actually much harder to forgive than someone who has forgiven themself and moved on.    Do your best to try to make this up to your wife by making a commitment to be true to her from now on...and then move on with your life determined to keep that commitment.    No more dwelling on it. It's over and you have the rest of your life to be a good husband now. So do it and stop being mean to yourself. Mistakes are for learning. If you learned your lesson, then that is what should really matter in the long run...to yourself, to your wife and to God, too.    The bright side is that you have not lost your wife yet, so you still have a chance to make it up to her. Get to it!|`|fOfJz9OMaa	Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.

Matt 11:28-30     And the Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying, This man receiveth sinners, and eateth with them.  And he spake this parable unto them, saying,  What man of you, having an hundred sheep, if he lose one of them, doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness, and go after that which is lost, until he find it?  Luke 15:2-4    I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons, which need no repentance.  Luke 15:7     A certain man had two sons; and he came to the first, and said, Son, go work to day in my vineyard.  He answered and said, I will not: but afterward he repented, and went.  And he came to the second, and said likewise. And he answered and said, I go, sir: and went not.  Whether of them twain did the will of his father?  Matt 21:28-31    There was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty.  And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both.

People that tell their spouses "out of guilt" are the very ones that fail for adultery. While adultery is taboo, not all adulterers are failing due to it.

I used to go out and when I would come home I would be wheezing from the smoke and hang my clothes up out side and  wash my hair. Hell I wouldn't even date a smoker!!!! Well one day I was out at the club and my best buddie had a black and mild so i took a couple of puffs i was like oh yeah this is nice with my dranks.  So every once and a while i would smoke one.

Many I know also think those laws were for the Jews only and neglect the fact the Jesus was a Jew and followed those laws.|`|AA11914788	OLD LAWS? If you mean the Mosaic laws of sacrifices, then they were done away with on the cross. Because, Jesus was the sacrifice of God, for the sins of the world. However, if you mean the LAW OF GOD, then NO WAY WERE THEY EVER DONE AWAY WITH OR CHANGED IN ANY WAY. If God could change His law and make the first day holy instead of His seventh day, THEN THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO NEED FOR CHRIST! NO NEED FOR SIN, AND NO NEED FOR A FLOOD, OR A JUDGMENT! It would also mean that God is a liar. He said that He is unchangeable, If He can change His law then He is CHANGEABLE! and that would make Him a liar.|`|a14e191e6139d47ecdcf2069e5a2de64aa	They confuse the moral law with the Moses law; in short The Ten Commandments with 600+ laws of Moses that was written by Moses in a book - Deut 31. Col 2 however, tells us that the handwritings that were against us - Moses laws - was nailed to the cross not the ten commandments. How can you nail stone to a cross, anyways, the distinction is clear and we should study for ourselves to see them. Paul even said in Romans that he knew sin because of the Law - the big ten. Also 1 John 3 gives the definition of sin which is breaking the big ten.|`|AA11277007	Jesus and the Mosaic Law<br>  <br>  <br>   Many Christians are perplexed when they confront the issue of the Mosaic Law. How binding is the Law on the Christian? Some have said that Jesus abolished the Law of Moses. I would have to disagree, based on the following passage spoken by Jesus Himself:<br>  <br>  Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. (Matthew 5:17)<br>  Some have suggested that by "fulfil," Jesus meant "abolish." Indeed, "abolish" is one meaning of "fulfil," but it is also the only meaning of "destroy." So if He had meant "abolish," He might as well have said, "I am not come to abolish, but to abolish." We can assume, therefore, that Jesus meant, "to develop the full potentialities of" when He said "fulfil."<br>  <br>  So why then do Christians not observe the Mosaic Law? The answer is that they do observe parts, but not all of it. Some parts of the Law were meant to be temporary, while others were intended to be permanent. This is seen in the fact that before Moses, the ancient Jews were not bound to the ritual commands (except circumcision). If the Mosaic Law was not meant to be temporary, then either God changes or the God of the righteous men and women before Moses was a different god. But this is absurd. We know that the God of Abraham was the God of Moses, and that He is our God today. The coming of Christ made parts of the Mosaic law unnecessary.<br>  <br>  <br>  In order to understand this, we must realize that the Law is made up of three parts: ceremonial, civil, and moral.<br>  <br>  <br>  The ceremonial law related specifically to Israel's worship. Since its primary purpose was to point to the coming Savior, Jesus made it unnecessary. He did not abolish it, in the sense of destroying it; He fulfilled it. Nowhere do we read that Jesus thought that the ceremonial law was wrong. The principles behind the ceremonial law are still applicable to us today, that is, the principles of worshipping and serving a holy God.<br>  <br>  <br>  The civil law prescribed rules for the Israelites' daily living. These laws separated the Jews from the Gentiles, and gave the Gentiles the example of how a holy people should live. Since much was given to the Jews, much was expected. But God gave a new covenant in Christ, and there is now no distinction to be made between Jew and Gentile. We are still to follow the requirements of this law as God's people, but the punishments are not for any nation to impose on its people, because we are no longer separated by nations but by God's grace (Christians and non-Christians).<br>  <br>  <br>  The moral law is basically the Ten Commandments. We are still bound by these laws, not for salvation, but to live a holy life. Jesus not only desired that His followers adhere to these commandments, He wished that they would go above and beyond them. He said, "Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment: but I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment..." He desired not only an outward observance of these laws, but an inward observance as well.<br>  <br>  <br>  So we see that the parts of the Law that have been rendered obsolete are those that contain ordinances. An ordinance is either a memorial of something that has already passed or a type of something in the future. The Old Testament laws containing ordinances were not meant to be permanent. There are no ordinances in the Ten Commandment Law. <br>  <br>  <br>  Now, we must remember that following rules and regulations will not get us into heaven. It is only through the blood of Jesus that we can see heaven. But if we love Him, we will keep His commandments.|`|AA12139805	To a Christian the law can no longer convict us to death for our sins. Christ died for our sins, now we have the Holy Spirit within to convict us. We don't need the law to tell us what is right or wrong.

03Xx7l8Baa	I'd say the first thing is    1) the Quran. I love the verses and I love how whenever I feel confused, lost or just need some guidance, I can read any surah and somehow there's an aya, verse, just waiting for me with so much comfort and the answer. Or sometimes I'll join a congregational prayer and the imam, leader, will recite sometime that TOTALLY touches or hits the spot.    Surah A l-e- Imran (3:18 &19)   - Allah Himself has testified to the fact that there is no god but He and so do the angels and those who are well grounded in knowledge standing firm on justice. There is no Ilah (God) except He, the Mighty, the Wise. (18)     - Surely, the only Deen (true religion and the Right Way of life) in the sight of Allah is Al-Islam. Those to whom the Book was given did not adopt ways different than this except out of envy among themselves, and after true knowledge had come to them. Allah is swift in calling to account those who deny His revelations.    Secondly,  2) There's a hadith, unfortunately i don't memorize it all or the narrator and can't find it now, but it says something like...    The Prophet (PBUH) asked his companions who has the strongest of faith. They thought and said the angels? He replied, and why shouldn't they have faith, since they receive orders directly from Him. So they thought and then said, the prophets? He replied, why shouldn't we have faith, since we receive our revelations from Him. So they (out of their innocence) said us? He said, why shouldn't you since I am here before you. So they asked then who oh Messenger of Allah? He replied there will come a people after you, when all they will have to learn from is books and their faith will be the strongest.    perhaps someone knows of this hadith and can correct me?|`|AA10248239	Love and fear.

fcb47ba6b3d558e424fe13d64318ea8caa	The 40 days is literal. In order to understand this in the bible you have to understand what the signifigance of the number 40 is. The number forty is used by God to represent a period of testing or judgment (the length of time necessary to accomplish some major part of Gods plan in his dealings with various portions of mankind).  It rained for 40 days and 40 nights in Noah's day. After Deluge, Noah was on ark for another 40 days.  Moses was on the mountain 40 days and 40 nights with God in the mount.  The Israelites wandered 40 years and ate Manna for 40 years. "Forty years" was the length of Israel's wandering in the wilderness. This period of years represents a generation, that is, the time it takes for a new generation to arise.   A 40-something time period, whether days, months, or years, is a period of testing, trial, probation, or chastisement and ends with a period of restoration, renewal. God is consistent, so the meaning of a number in Genesis remains the same all the way to the book of Revelation.   The spiritual significance may not be revealed directly, but in the case of "40" and its many examples throughout the Bible, we can be certain of its importance and significance.|`|wZEGi1EHaa	god appears to be overly dramatic...|`|eO2rnf7yaa	As far as the details go, both stories are allegorical.

b3a4e3954118fb9fef3e435ed488eeadaa	You are right to trust. However the way people can be, you need to choose who to trust (in other words they have to earn it). As a manager you are at a different level than your underlings. It's ok to be friendly with your other co-workers but remember that you are being paid to manage a team. At work there is a standard and after work there is room for some slack (not too much, though).  Not everyone can be trusted. It seems you learned that the hard way.  People are always after your job because they want to move up. Stay fair and polite with everyone and double check what people tell you to determine who you can trust more than others.

fcb47ba6b3d558e424fe13d64318ea8caa	To understand prophecy, it is important to understand the symbols used. God's symbols used in prophecy are consistent. God does not use a symbol in one place and then change its meaning in another. So we will use Scripture to interpret Scripture:   God often uses the principle of repetition and enlargement in unfolding the development of prophecy. That means the same history is repeated using different symbolism as the themes are enlarged and described in fuller detail.     Beast: Represent kingdoms.   Horns: Symbol of kings, power and authority.   Sea: The sea, or waters, represents multitudes of peoples.   Winds: A symbol of the forces of change, war, strife and turmoil.   Day: Represents a literal year (360 days).   Wings: Represent great speed of conquest.   Rib: Represents a nation. The rib taken from Adam became a woman who was the mother of all nations. The twelve pairs of ribs represents the twelve tribes of Israel.|`|2k8TEiRtaa	I think that the times are right and the prophecies are coming true.

It just seems like the right thing to do.    Do I feel good when doing so? I suppose. But I never really think about feeling good afterwards. In my life I've been helped out many a times when under one kind of duress or another. I suppose it's simply passing along kindness. Sort of like what that movie 'Pay It Forward' was about.|`|a457e9a42af7d95c857ddbcfefd4f337aa	I help others because that is how I was brought up.

I'd have to say "All of the above and more."  I do the best I can to live my life by Christian principles...as I understand them...and I do what I can to make the world a bit better.  Putting love into the world is its own reward, and doing that manifests itself in many ways.  Best wishes!|`|KrdOKdJcaa	I help others because I was brought up to believe it was the right thing to do.

Who cares what the underlying motivation is?|`|yu53u5TFaa	Just because I'll feel like a selfish dick if I don't.|`|FB7QVMzQaa	If I had to define "why" I help others, I can only come up with that it is something I learned from the man who taught me compassion, caring, and giving, and that is my grandfather.  Truly, he would literally have taken his shirt off and given it to someone in need of one.  In my darkest hour, in every tragic moment I have ever lived through, he was always there by my side.  There were a number of occasions when I have been blessed by the graciousness of other people in a time of need as well.  Now that I am older and in turn able to help others, I pay it forward.  Yes, to know that you touched someone the way that another once touched you with their help makes you feel glad that you could do something, that can never be a bad thing.  IMHO, only jaded, cynical people try to "qualify" someones* motivations for helping.     *I do think there are times when people help for the wrong reasons and those are if you're intentionally planning on throwing it in someones face later on to gain some type of control over them or manipulate them, or you are keeping score, and/or you are expecting something in return.|`|avVdKiWKaa	Objection, assumes facts not in evidence.

Sometimes I have to work really hard on not resenting it, esp. when it's I'm dealing with willful ignorance or laziness.    That might be because of the serotonin related problems I seem to have been blessed with.  It might be because I'm just a grump sometimes.    Either way, I try to do the helpful thing in any given situation, so I guess it's from knowledge that this is the right thing to do.

The Bible even states in several places that "he is a God exacting exclusive devotion."<br>  Comparing it the way you are makes it sound like God is indeed selfish. However, if you look at it from a different view, Who else but God could ask for exclusive devotion? If he did send his son to give up his life on our behalf, that shows that he is a loving God, doesn't it? He created us to be able to have love & joy & have children ourselves. He knows the importance we feel for our children & the rest of our loved ones, he feels it himself. If you are a parent, don't you expect your children to be obedient to you? Don't you discipline & expect them to behave as you train them too? God expects the same from us, he doesn't demand that we obey him, love & honor him, he hopes we do & wants us too & even asks us too, as we hope our children will obey & love & honor us. But he also gives us free will to make that choice. <br>  <br>  Another way you can look at it is the word "selfish" itself, can you say you have a material possession that your selfish over? Nothing childish, I mean something that is so sentimental for you, a wedding ring or a gift you received from a friend, or a possession that belonged to a grandparent, etc, something that means the world to you, that you would be devastated if you lost or if it was taken away from you? I believe we ALL have those possessions. These are material things, so how can we not expect God to have these strong feelings for us, his children, his creation. He's our father & we should want him to feel this for us, it's not a repulsive thought at all, it's a feeling we have ourselves.<br>  <br>  Well, this explains at least my views on this matter. Hope it helps you understand why others feel that God has every right to exact exclusive devotion & I for one am glad he does. Take care!|`|41dgPeRtaa	He loves you just the way you are.<br>  But it sounds like your being selfish.<br>  How do you think God feels when you put others before Him?<br>  He saved You and died miserably on that cross and rose again..<br>  it's not just a child bible story.<br>  It's real.<br>  Think about putting God first.|`|CEQpDpnPaa	Deuteronomy 4:24 "the Lord your God is a consuming fire, a jealous God"<br>  <br>  He deeply longs for us, wanting us to keep Him first in our hearts<br>  <br>  He loves us so much that He sent His son to die for us so that we might have eternal life and not perish in hell<br>  <br>  God's love for us is unconditional. even if you hate Him He still loves you and wants you to turn your heart to Him|`|N6cCc9dOaa	Hell no!If Jesus Christ was selfish then the human race would be in hell.Why?Because Jesus Christ would not have come to earth to die for our sins.Putting Christ first is the least we filthy sinners can do for Jesus after He came to earth to get nailed to a cross for our sins.|`|oVHFz52Laa	No. God is Love and He is Just. He will be whatever He will be and no matter what is your human opinion about Him|`|GZv6ft8gaa	Let me see if I got this:<br>  <br>  You ask "How can a person /being or whatever say they love you but only if you put him before all others, or to worship only him ."<br>  <br>  Take this for example: We live on a earth that provides nourishment and materials for our well being. This world also includes incredible beauty for all to enjoy. Certainly a blessing to all.<br>  <br>  We have all been blessed with minds. Some minds with incredible intelligence become further blessings to us all. Stop for a minute to consider all the incredible things that man has created. This is certainly a blessing to all.<br>  <br>  God has given us all a conscience. He has stamped His moral law in our hearts. We are all born with a sense of what is right and wrong. Generally speaking, in our societies, if we work hard and live a generally moral life, we will see blessing. Without this moral stamp in our hearts can you imagine what life would be like? Imagine everyone doing exactly what they want, when they want. No laws to follow. No moral code whatsoever. It would be chaos. Certainly this is a blessing to all.<br>  <br>  Think about all the music and artistic abilities that exist. Think of Bach, Beethoven, and Rembrandt. Think of all the beautiful expressions of artistic abilities that exist whether from believers or unbelievers. Certainly this is an incredible blessing to us all.<br>  <br>  Think of the various organizations and structures that we have in this world. First and foremost we have the structure of the family. Imagine not being part of a family? Think about hospital, educational institutions, businesses, corporations, voluntary services. All of these things are certainly a blessing to all.<br>  <br>  History is full of God's grace to the unbelieving. Christ healed many people without any directive that they first believe. When tyrants stand over people and are ultimately defeated, certainly all benefit from this grace. Were believers of Christ the only ones to benefit from the destruction of Hitler? Certainly not...we all benefit from the answered prayers of believing Christians to the living God.<br>  <br>  <br>  Do you still ask why you should love God more? Okay... <br>  <br>  God created you, gave you life, gave you your children, your grand children, your house, food, your job, everything that you have is given to you by God. <br>  <br>  "but you gave your children life", is false. You may have conceived your children, but you did not give them life. <br>  <br>  We see time and time again that God wants to be praised and worshiped for all the things He did for you, and especially the biggest of all, giving His One and Only Begotten Son to save you from eternal torment in hell. <br>  <br>  You say "I used to be a Christian", you may have grown up in a Christian household, but you never were one yourself. Being a Christian is following Jesus Christ your whole life long. And Jesus said "My sheep know My voice" (John 10:27) and "no one can snatch them away from me" (John 10:29). <br>  <br>  I would imagine since you have had children and now have grand children that have had the this feeling: You buy your kids a brand new toy and they play with it day after day. They enjoy it so much that they don't even pay any attention to you or even say "thank you". They enjoy the gift more than the giver. That is what you are doing...<br>  <br>  You are enjoying the creation more than the Creator. <br>  <br>  Like Soldier of Christ said above me, if God was selfish and loved His Son more than anything else, and never sent Him to die for us, we would all be heading for hell, but Jesus died to prove what He said in John 3:16, for God so loved the WORLD a.k.a. Us! <br>  <br>  Jesus died to prove that He loves you more than He loves Himself!|`|4qfh2m0haa	Argh I see. <br>  God loves us. But the thing is - his love stems from the fact that he doesn't need us at all. He doesn't need us for anything. He could have created us in a worshipping form like the angels. Yet, he , out of mercy and out of examination created us with intellect. Given us abilities on our planet that no other creation has ever been witness to. The fact is , despite God not needing us to even exist, he still gives us our meaning of life, our sustence , our provisions, wealth, you name it. Isn;t tha tlove?<br>  Despite our intention of creation being just to worship him.<br>  <br>  <br>  Children are placed under the command of God.<br>  Being dutiful to one's Child is the same as carrying out good deeds in the way of the Lord isn't it?<br>  The only thing that God has anything against putting your life for your son is if it is blasphemous. God and children aren't synonymous. Children make mistakes, learn and so on, God doesn't. He is the learned. So we must make the distinction of love in wordly terms and Godly Love. <br>  <br>  <br>  The debate also arouses about whether we create humans, or is it God that decrees birth and death, who knows?<br>  <br>  Btw, the god of the Christians = God of Jews = God of Muslims.<br>  They all are branch faiths of the Abrahamic religion|`|CVdcrY3kaa	No! God is not selfish. He is Holy! God gave me life, AND my child her life.

You are just picking a different candidate for God !!! Something is at the top if you aren't an unthinking cow. <br>  <br>  Worship is for your sake. Big error number 2. Here is from the Catholic Mass :<br>  "Father, all-powerful and ever-living God,<br>  <br>  we do well always and everywhere to give you thanks.<br>  <br>  You have NO NEED of our praise,<br>  <br>  yet our desire to thank you is itself your gift.<br>  <br>  Our prayer of thanksgiving ADDS NOTHING to your greatness,<br>  <br>  but MAKES US GROW in your grace,<br>  <br>  through Jesus Christ our Lord.<br>  <br>  In our joy we sing to your glory<br>  <br>  with all the choirs of angels: <br>  <br>  ====> But this shows you to be truly unthinking. Do you really think you love your kids more than God does. Do you really think you know better what is in their interest than God does. Do you really think they got here ("into the world") WITHOUT God !!!<br>  <br>  You're dumb. Provably so. I know why you aren't a Christian. Because you have no grey matter.|`|2Hot9EJiaa	For your information, God gives everyone life, without God there would be no parents to give "birth" as you say to your children.

He is worthy!|`|3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	No I think God is generous and loving to all who love Him.

Nostradamus is credited with some predictions, but not everything he "saw" came to pass, and he even is quoted as saying that just because he saw it didn't mean it was inevitable.  Of course some one could dig up his grave if Nostradamus already gave the date; couldn't that person just wait until the appointed time?  Human history is full of great wars and natural disasters; we don't need an oracle to predict that. Of course bad things will happen, just as they always have.<br>  As far as the Mayan calendar goes, most Mayan scholars give little credence to the idea that the Mayans predicted the end of the world.  At most, they (the Mayans) were merely pointing out that according to their reckoning of time, an new age would begin in 2012.  What does that really mean?  Y2K was supposed to be such a big deal, and it was only because we created such a hysteria surrounding it.<br>  What about the stars aligning?  How exactly were the stars aligned during the great extinction events of the earth?  To our best knowledge, mass extinctions were caused by asteroids, volcanic activity, and changes in the environment, but not by alignments of distant stars.<br>  Don't be afraid of 2012.  Be aware of global warming and climate change and how to best survive the economy, but don't fixate on dates that are relativley meaningless.  There's nothing magical about the year 2012 in context of the billions of years of earth history.

No woman is going to be bossed around by an arrogant, self centred man.  Major problems and trouble.<br>  <br>  If you look at many Christian marriages you will see that there is mostly peace and harmony.  They discuss things together and communication is always strong.  The man may seem to make decisions publicly but the man and woman together would have sorted it out beforehand so both parties will be pleased with the outcome.<br>  <br>  A godly man would never do anything to opress his wife, force her to cook, clean or anything else.<br>  <br>  Hope this explains things a bit better.|`|ltMbMIPlaa	well, the story goes that one day God was walking in the garden and saw Adam sitting there all alone.

Adam said oh God, how much does this thing would cost me? God said: An arm and a leg. Adam said; well, I can't afford it.

It is not to  be a slave to our husbands, but to understand they are the head of the home as God designed. Yes we are to be respectful to our husbands, yes we are to bear children for him (if we can) but that is not the only thing. No we donot have to cook his meals ( my husband is the chef of the house so I can't cook ,I can only cook easy meals)   We are to be our spouses support system, not be taken advantage of.|`|rU6nh42Eaa	Would I make you scream if I said yes?  Of course I say no, because every woman is an individual, with her own special gifts, talents, and personality that God intends her to use in her life.  She is equal to a man before the Lord and before the law of any civilized country.  That being said, if we get away from all that and think on a purely biological level, women are designed to bear children.  With that goes a nature that nurtures children and seeks to create a secure and comfortable home for her children and husband.  As we see in traditional societies, men are the hunters and farmers who deal with the outside world, as they are usually stronger and can work continuously, as pregnant women or nursing mothers often can't.  Although both spouses contribute equally to their livelihood, they must take on different roles to balance it out.  I think God created women to want to care for their loved ones because it balances out their biological role as mother.  <br>  <br>  The problem I see in your question is that some people see this as a curse on women, a low status, like a servant or slave.  If that's the attitude a woman has it will be a miserable life.  If her man thinks that's all she can or should do, it will be an unhappy home.  She still has her own special self.  We could say the same about men.  No man would be happy to think that his only purpose in life is to bring home a paycheck.  If he can't, then he's a useless creature.  If he does, who cares about him personally?  That's wrong.|`|vBk4LaYRaa	No. God created woman to be a helpmate for the man. In other words, they are equal to us men (Genesis 2:20-24). Husband and wife are supposed to be helpers of one another. They are not slaves or servants. And if God gives us a wife, then we need to love them. Meaning you can cook for them too and take care of them. Women do not serve men nor vice versa. We do need to serve God. Me personally, I love a wife and would help her and take care of her to the best of my ability. I would be thankful to God for her because she would love me and take care of me the same that I would for her.|`|FATyhyZ2aa	No.  Gen 2:18 says that it is not good for man to be alone & God will create for him a "helper."  /  In Hebrew, this word is "ezer."  /  Psalm 54:4  says, "Behold God is my helper."  /  The same "ezer" translation is used here to compare God's relationship King David.  /  I conclude that God was not proposing to be David's housekeeper & nursemaid.  /  If anything, it elevates the role of a wife to her husband.  She is there for so much more.  Correlate God ministering to David.  A wife's duty is of ministry to her husband and that encompasses so much more.  With a higher degree of respect.  /  A lot of people over look scripture that is highly elevating to women.  Well, from what I've read, all of it shows woman great respect.|`|fe8aa5495caab3873690c07d37e65268aa	God created us all as equals.  We do have "jobs" that we need to share with each other.

ridu0Rtwaa	Never mind the mistakes all the evidence says that Jesus never was and that the whole bible is a fraud!!    There is not one single mention of Jesus in the entire Roman record - that is right - not one!!! At the same time as he was supposed to have been around there were a number of Jews claiming to be the messiah - all of whom are well recorded!!    He was supposed to have been a huge problem to the Romans and produced wonderful miracles but still not one contemporary record?    Even the bible mentions of him like all other references were not written until many years after his supposed death!!    At best he was an amalgam of those others!!    Pilot is recorded in the Roman record as a somewhat lack luster man but no mention of a Jesus, a trial or crucifixion that would surely have been used to make him look brighter!!      The Roman Emperor Constantine produced the bible and he was a pagan not god!!!   He also organized Christianity into the Holly Roman Catholic Church!!  Not in Israel or any of the countries of supposed origin but entirely Italian!!    Not one word of it is contemporary with the period and was not written until many years after the period the story is set in!!

There are NO mistakes in the Word of God.  Man tries to read the Bible like an ordinary book. It is filled with mysteries and those mysteries are only revealed to those who are 'hungry' for righteousness.  Also, the Bible has a lot of words with different meanings and you must be able to interpret them appropriately.  That is where the Greek and Hebrew meanings come in to play.    Please read the 'exact' scriptures you have referenced:    2 Samuel  21:19  And there was again a battle in Gob with the Philistines, where Elhanan the son of Jaareoregim, a Bethlehemite, slew the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver's beam.     1 Chronicles 20:5  And there was war again with the Philistines; and Elhanan the son of Jair slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, whose spear staff was like a weaver's beam.     Okay, let me explain using the Strongs Concordance.  The word (name) Jaareoregim in 2 Samuel 21:19 means  ...H3296  ???? ?????  ya?a?re?y 'o?regi?ym  yah-ar-ay' o-reg-eem'  From the plural of H3293 and the masculine plural participle active of H707; woods of weavers; Jaare-Oregim, an Israelite: - Jaare-oregim.    Now here is where 1 Chronicles 20:5 comes into play.  The word (name) Jair means...H3265  ?????  ya??u?r  yaw-oor'  Apparently passive participle of the same as H3293; wooded; Jaur, an Israelite: - Jair [from the margin].    Notice that the Hebrew words H3293 in both verses mean the "same" thing.    I hope this helps clear your thoughts of errors in the Bible.|`|M7r8oaUzaa	they accept it because they've believed in it so long they say something like    "well thats how the bible is, its not perfect but this religion is perfect because my parents taught me it. so i wont pay attention to what doesnt make sense"|`|pbTtiPqOaa	Christians who believe there are mistakes in the Bible better really think about why they believe the Bible then.

Man is imperfect, and Bible Copyist have at times inadvertantly copied certain text wrong.  In addition, some religion's to advance their dogma, or interpretation of the Bible have printed versions, or paraphrased copies of the Bible, and not line by line translations of God's Word the Bible.  This is why when I engage in personal Bible study I strictly utilize only direct translations of the Bible that translate from the original Dead Sea Scrolls and/or other original texts.      I believe in God because I feel his love in my life.  The reasons why, and how I feel God's love in my life are too numerous for me to list here.  In addition, the more quality time I spend truly studying and meditating on what I read in the Bible, the way one might study to obtain a 3.5 to 4.0 GPA College Doctorate Degree, the more certain I am that the Bible doesn't contradict itself, and is completely harmonius.  I also find that the Bible doesn't need interpretation, because scripture(s) is always explained elsewhere in the Bible by other scripture(s).  I hope that my research below answers your other Bible questions satisfactorily.      At 2?Samuel 21:19, it states: Elhanan the son of Jaare-oregim the Bethlehemite got to strike down Goliath the Gittite (or Goliath the man of Gath), the shaft of whose spear was like the beam of loom workers. The parallel account at 1?Chronicles 20:5 reads: Elhanan the son of Jair got to strike down Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the shaft of whose spear was like the beam of loom workers.    Several suggestions have been made for an explanation of the so-called contradictory problem. The Targum preserves a tradition that the man Elhanan is to be identified as a soldier in David's army.  Davids men twice struck down Giant or Goliath Warriors of the Philistines forces at Gob near Gezer.  (2 Sa 21:18,?19)  In addition, a third confrontation took place at Gath with another Philistine Giant, or Goliath who had a total of 12 fingers and 12 toes. (See 1 Ch 20:6; 2 Sa 21:20)  The Soncino Books of the Bible, edited by A.?Cohen (London), comments that there is no difficulty in the belief that the Bible speaks of there being two Goliaths, commenting that Goliath was a descriptive title  like "Pharaoh," Rabshakeh, Sultan.      Some Bible Scholars believe that 2 Samuel 21:19 (before imperfect man copied it from the original scrolls) read, got to strike down Lahmi, just as the parallel text at 1?Chronicles 20:5 reads. This would make the two texts harmonize on this point. The Philistine named Lahmi, then, was evidently the brother of the Goliath, or Giant that David killed.  One must remember that "the Mighty Philistine Warrior or Goliath" that David killed account is recorded at 1 Sa 17:1-54.       The fact that 2 Samuel 21:19 refers to Jaare-oregim, whereas 1 Chron 20:5 reads Jair, and also that only the account in Second Samuel contains the term Bethlehemite [Heb., behth hal?lach?mi], while the Chronicles account alone contains the name Lahmi [eth-Lach?mi], has been suggested by the majority of commentators to be the result of imperfect Bible Copyists error.    Jaare-oregim is a name appearing only at 2?Samuel 21:19. It is generally believed that scribal error has given rise to this name and that the correct reading is preserved in the parallel text at 1?Chronicles 20:5. Jaare is considered to be an alteration of Jair, and oregim (o?reghim, means weavers or loom workers) is thought to have been copied inadvertently from a line below in the same verse.    I hope the above explanation was of assistance to you.  If you visit a university library you may be able to reference some of my source materials.      -Arlene J.|`|DR7mTpnXaa	by doing this    ..,-~*`lllllll`*~,  ..,-~*`lllllllllllllllllllllllllll...  ,-~*lllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll...  ,-*lllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll...  .;*`lllllllllllllllllllllllllll,-~*~-...  ..\lllllllllllllllllllllllllll/\;;...  ...\lllllllllllllllllllll,-*..`~-~...  .\llllllllllll,-~*)_-\..*`*;....  ..\,-*`,*`),-~*`~..../  ...|/...//~,...-~*,-~*`;./.\  ../...///..,-,..*~,.`*~*.*......  .|...///.*`...\...).)`~,  .|.//./.),.)`*~-,.../.|..)...  /./.../,*`-,..`-,*`.,---...\./...  ...(.)`*~-,.`*`.,-~*.,-*|/./...  .*-,.`*-,...`~,..``.,,,-*.|.,*....  .*,`-,)-,..,-*`...,-*.(`-,...|`|3SYnZEZ9aa	Because the mistakes show the human side of the Bible.  Look at Matthew, Mark, Luke and John.  They don't agree 100%.  In fact, Luke and Matthew have 2 different genealogies for Jesus!  This is evidence that the "authority" of the time just didn't make it up.  In fact if the human "authority" (Roman government in 300 BC) or whatever had made it up, they would've praised themselves and not God!  When Jesus was arrested what did his followers do? Run like cowards.  I'm not Catholic, but what did the supposedly first Pope do?  He denied Christ like a coward!  If this stuff was made up, that would've never happened in the pretend story.

The truth is main stream Christianity is too liberal. They preach many things not found anywhere in the bible and don't dare preach many things that are in the bible.    The modern day up and coming worldly church is the dangerous cult today. Instead of preaching and teaching the truth as found in the Word of God it is diluted, and discounted.     By handling the Word of God in craftiness too many preachers only preach what is politically correct. Preacher are becoming politicians in that they only preach what people want to hear and never what people don't want to hear.    The word Doctrine has become a dirty word.    Words like sin, repentance, and obedience is seldom heard.    Those that preach righteousness, holiness, and against sin are branded a cult or legalistic.    Yes there have been cults and extremists like those found in Jones-town and Waco. Yet they did not do near the damage and hurt to sincere souls as the churches lead by preachers today who know the truth but refuse to preach it because of their livelihood.    The love of money is the root of all evil.    Paul told Timothy, "The time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears"     The time is here folks.     The time of the most dangerous cult.

Let it go this one time, don't deliberately act differently just to p*ss your dad off, but don't try to adjust your behavior either.    If your dad disses you again let him know how you feel. Don't be angry about it, or upset about it, just be cool, calm, and collected. Let him know that you love him unconditionally and that you would like the same from him in return, that you don't expect him to love you only if you act in a certain way.    You weren't acting feminine, all you did was ask if a blouse was a particular color. Would it have been different if you had asked if the wall was mocha? Or if it was a Chrysler 300 and you asked him, 'do you think that is light sandstone or cool vanilla'? Would that have been girly?    He only perceived it as feminine because you asked about the color of a feminine object. If you were not gay he would have thought nothing of it. It is unfair to judge you on this basis.

And im sure he will rethink before he says anything hurtful like that again|`|bhN0exrnaa	Zac (cool name BTW),  I'm sorry that had to happen to you and I'm amazed that you seem to be more mature than your own father.  That said, I would urge you to let it go this one time (assuming that it was the first time this happened).   I would also urge you not to purposefully act any different in front of your father (it genuinely is he that needs to mature).  If the same thing does in fact happen again, I would definitely say something like you wrote above - - that you are hurt by what he says and that you thought you could at least be yourself around your own father.  Hopefully it won't ever be necessary, but if it is, I think he will definitely get the message.  Good Luck  Joe|`|dFq4dKBZaa	Haha owned.|`|nMhJwHAtaa	Awww.... *hugs*  I think you should talk to him about it. That he hurted your feelings.  And that you don't want to act around him, that you only want to be comfortable around him - with just being you.  Say to him that  you can not be comfortable around him if he says ignorant and hurtful things like that.

Don't let anyone tell you otherwise, but at the same time, realize you can't judge others for what they believe, either.|`|wR1XyyrUaa	None we know of, because no one can seem to agree on anything we have now... However, I do suspect Buddhism and Taoism are rather close to it.|`|lh8Tn02Naa	The one that works for you.

Jehovah's Witnesses are the only group on earth that resembles to such an extreme degree the pattern Jesus' first century disciples followed. The majority of religions that claim to be Christian have their hand in politics and greedy commercialism of this world. Jesus did not promote human rulership. He preached God's Kingdom.|`|3oCdTWYZaa	None!    Belief in yourself should be the ultimate faith!  Don't rely on any deities for moral or emotional support - realize that you have the strength within yourself to overcome all adversities!|`|WiIviMv5aa	Christianity|`|rFFYCmOGaa	All of them and none of them depending upon who you ask.|`|AA10876206	Natural selection/evolution applies to anything that replicates with a slight chance of error and competes for natural resources.  This means that religions are subject to natural selection and evolution too.    It is in the best interest for all religions to claim themselves as the "true religion".  Those religions that don't say that will likely lose followers to those religions that say they are "true" and will eventually become extinct.    Is there actually a true religion mixed in among all the ones saying that they are true?  Impossible to say at this point.      I am a skeptic.  At a minimum, I would think that any true religion would be internally consistent, not contain any errors or contradictions and would jibe with what we know of reality.  Right now, we don't have any religion that achieves those things.|`|8Y0iCF2maa	who knows|`|uMKWNhLkaa	You need to talk to experts personaly from each major religion.  Find out how they came to be and why they thnk the other religion is wrong.  No one on Y!A will be able to write a long enough answer to convince you.    My opinion.  Christianity. Proven through fufilling prophesies perfectly in the past as evidence for a start.|`|U24VtSlZaa	I suspect from the context that you are using the term "religion" in some way other than what most original speakers of the English language would ordinarily mean by it.    Reason I suspect that is, there is nothing inherently "true" or "false" about any "religion," as I suspect you know.    Why not just come on out and directly state your agenda?|`|UmdKqP5kaa	Ok, we know we don't create each other and we don't come to this world from nowhere because when we die we must be going somewhere as well, hence there must be God, if there were many Gods, they would have fought over what to be created and what not to be, probably over who to die and who to live at the same time... so it's gotta be one God... if that God created us then there must be a reason... could we figure it out on our own? God made it easy and sent us messengers and prophets to show us the way and tell us why... so all the messengers and all the religions are from the same only God, so they've got to be complementary to each other, not opposing each other!!! then God must have said His final words in the last message, what is the last message? and how do we know it's the last one? I guess that would be the religion that believes in all messengers and all books equally... is there such religion? actually yes, Islam does :)  A True Muslim (man or woman) gets his reward for obeying Allah's orders (Allah means The God in Arabic) by going to heaven, where he/she are indulged forever in all the good thing s that were on earth and more, things no one ever dreamt of or heard about. The Holy Quran tells Muslims (men and women) there will be good food, good wine and sex in heaven for all, but not in the bestial way you may think of, but rather in a way that is satisfactory for everyone and better than what was on earth. Heaven is no heartbreak or injustice land.  True Muslims are no terrorists, and Islam never calls for that, Islam means peace, it bans violence unless you were fought so you fight back, it only doesn't require Muslims to be cowards, and true Muslims understands this very well and never attack civilians.   Islam is the only religion that accepts freedom of religion and asks men to treat women gently like queens.  Muslims don't deny Jesus, they believe in him, love him and respect him so much.  We believe Jesus is NOT dead till today; he wasnt murdered or crucified as most people think. God made the man who betrayed Jesus be killed instead by switching their looks for a moment. Jesus was left up to live in heaven until the end of days when he will come back to earth, make justice prevail instead of oppression, fight the imposter and perform his last prayer before he really dies like other Prophets. So we're waiting for you Jesus, Messenger of God, to bring the world peace and pray with us. Thats what prophet Muhammad told us and this is what I believe in, Im a Muslim  so how do we know it's true? what is said in the last message and what should we do? read the following, and you'll figure out for yourself:|`|O3WYA3WGaa	I think it's something very close to what the Jehovah's Witnesses got going on.|`|xTriyfWuaa	true and religion dont belong in the same sentence, unless it is to show that they are diametrically opposed.|`|yu53u5TFaa	The fact that they all claim to be true yet which one you believe in is almost always dependent on where you were born implies that none of them are true.|`|db7df25ea31227e5641d5c32d43c3bcdaa	none    only salvation in jesus leads to heaven nothing else|`|5Smw52iTaa	Choose yourself:    - Pastafarianism  - LOLcatism  - None|`|LTvReFIxaa	There is no "true" religion.|`|45Mmu3SFaa	A follower of Jesus Christ....|`|M7r8oaUzaa	probably animism. every thing alive on earth follows it. when humans civilized, they forgot it, they adopted christianity and things like that, and part of the people of our culture said... no this doesnt make sense (which it doesnt) so they say there is no religion|`|b9082e593baa61d6020c92bab2fa8deaaa	NONE!!!!

But I have been watching! declares the LORD.     12 " 'Go now to the place in Shiloh where I first made a dwelling for my Name, and see what I did to it because of the wickedness of my people Israel. 13 While you were doing all these things, declares the LORD, I spoke to you again and again, but you did not listen; I called you, but you did not answer. 14 Therefore, what I did to Shiloh I will now do to the house that bears my Name, the temple you trust in, the place I gave to you and your fathers. 15 I will thrust you from my presence, just as I did all your brothers, the people of Ephraim.'     16 "So do not pray for this people nor offer any plea or petition for them; do not plead with me, for I will not listen to you. 17 Do you not see what they are doing in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem? 18 The children gather wood, the fathers light the fire, and the women knead the dough and make cakes of bread for the Queen of Heaven. They pour out drink offerings to other gods to provoke me to anger. 19 But am I the one they are provoking? declares the LORD. Are they not rather harming themselves, to their own shame?     20 " 'Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: My anger and my wrath will be poured out on this place, on man and beast, on the trees of the field and on the fruit of the ground, and it will burn and not be quenched.     21 " 'This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Go ahead, add your burnt offerings to your other sacrifices and eat the meat yourselves! 22 For when I brought your forefathers out of Egypt and spoke to them, I did not just give them commands about burnt offerings and sacrifices, 23 but I gave them this command: Obey me, and I will be your God and you will be my people. Walk in all the ways I command you, that it may go well with you. 24 But they did not listen or pay attention; instead, they followed the stubborn inclinations of their evil hearts. They went backward and not forward. 25 From the time your forefathers left Egypt until now, day after day, again and again I sent you my servants the prophets. 26 But they did not listen to me or pay attention. They were stiff-necked and did more evil than their forefathers.'     27 "When you tell them all this, they will not listen to you; when you call to them, they will not answer. 28 Therefore say to them, 'This is the nation that has not obeyed the LORD its God or responded to correction.

NnYB9eXiaa	Hi :)    This question will be *so* much easier to answer AFTER your mother meets with the principal.    There could be a million and one reasons they want to talk to her!    I wouldn't immediately jump to the conclusion that it has *anything* at all to do with him being Latino.       In kindergarten, I too was bilingual.  Although I didn't have the problems with reading that he had earlier in the year, my parents were called into a meeting 9 weeks into the school year to discuss my progress with the principal and my teacher.  I was given a battery of tests, psychological, IQ, comprehension, etc.    You don't know that it's because he's not doing well.  Perhaps they've seen such improvement that they want to move him up, or put him into a special program for bright children.    In any classroom, the teacher to child ratio is SO high (even in some of the best private schools) that in almost every situation, it's impossible to help every child on a one to one basis -- which is unfortunate but true.  Your parents were smart in getting him a tutor - it's not uncommon.    Like I said, try asking the question again, perhaps after you know what the principal has said - it could turn all your questions around 180 degrees.    Good Luck|`|08QtgdpOaa	I wouldn't send my kids(if i had any) to a school like that.|`|TJpQZju2aa	It will be discrimination when and if they expel him from school for unfounded reasons, at this point you just think they might expel him,  Maybe the principal is requesting a conference with you mother to discuss the improvements your little brother has made|`|LCCsJ62Saa	If it's a private school they can do what they want.|`|b9082e593baa61d6020c92bab2fa8deaaa	I do not understand what the problem is. He's got a tutor and caught up. He's doing well. What is the problem? If the school doesn't treat him fairly, go to the schoolboard.|`|bhN0exrnaa	My perspective is this:  You are actually prejudging (the act of being prejudice) the Principal before having all the facts.  You've already decided in your head that something bad is going to happen and that it won't be justified.  No matter what ultimately happens, you're doing exactly what you are accusing the Principal of doing - and I can't imagine that helping the situation.  If they are trying to kick your brother out, it will take cool heads with facts and patience to prevail. Emotions would only make the Principal tune you out.  Please be calm if the situation comes to be as you fear, but hopefully, it will not.  Good Luck  Joe
65QqZBnjaa	One thing I don't think men appreciate is how important our hair is to us.  There used to be a saying that said:    A woman's hair is her crown and glory.    And it's true.

Realize the two of you are approaching this thing from totally different perspectives.|`|8ldA7Z3Baa	I say you should grow some balls when it comes to your lady or she'll walk all over you, and that doesn't seem healthy. I say this because I'm all about equality in a relationship. If your lady wants YOU to change your look at her request, but doesn't want to do that for you in exchange, then you should put your foot down and say, 'if your not gonna just change your look for me just this once, then I see no reason to do that for you'.    In a relationship, what I've learned is, sometimes guys will do things they wouldn't normally do for their women because they love them and are willing to try new things (that doesn't hurt anyone) And sometimes girls do things like that for guys, because they care. The outcome can sometimes be, you learn that you actually like doing what she requested and vice versa.    My wife for example. She was so against getting an emo hair style. I told her she would look super cute since she has the body and face for it. She fought against it. Then she asked me to wear a certain shirt she bought me. I said, 'you can forget it'. Later on, after me nagging her, she finally got the emo hair style, and she absolutly loved it. I finally wore that shirt, and now I have three more in that style because it's awesome.     Point is, yeah, we all are in control of our bodies and can do as we please, but relationships, and life in general seems a lot less cold when the one you love will humor you and try new things, and vice versa.    EDIT: Thumbsdown for what, making sense? Well, I guess in the end it doesn't matter sense my wife and I are happy and growing older together. And because we're both open to stepping outside of our comfort zones here and there, we've become more refined versions of our past selves.|`|8Udhkkw0aa	no, you're not wrong, you just have a different opinion.    but just like you should cut your hair the way you want it you should let her cut hers the way she wants it.|`|AA12006309	It's her hair, she can have it as she likes it.  I know my partner has voice once or twice the thought of me growing my hair out, but he knows I won't do it.  I don't like long hair, I don't like how it looks on me, and I always keep it less than 2 inches (I'd shave it, but he'd flip!).    He has hair down to his mid-back, and has mentioned cutting it a few times, knowing that I like him with long hair.  I'm not going to be mad at him if he cuts it - it's his head, not mine - it'll just take getting used to.    In the end, it's your head, keep your hair how YOU want to wear it, since you're the one who has to walk around in that body with that mop of hair.  Same goes for her.|`|0XkIHnipaa	If hair is your biggest problem then you are doing very well indeed.

tuIw5c6raa	Hi,    in the german education system the pupil starts school at the age of 6. For for years he will go to a primary school. In third grade they will start having english, but simple things, like colours and singing songs. no grammar.    After year 4 it is decided upon their marks which further school they can go to. -there are three different choices. Hauptschule is up to year nine, Realschule is uo to year ten and Gymnasium up to year 12. Only after Gymnasium you can go and study at university.    From year 5 on they will have proper english lessons with grammar and everything. Most schools will start with English in Year 5, but some do start with French or latin.     Each school focus on something different. sometimes you get different choices at the same school, like on focus might be mathematics, or languages, even musician.    LAnguages i know of that are teached in school, besides english, are french, latin, spanish, italian, russian. Some schools offer an additional language classes you can sign up to as well. Most times you will find english, french and latin.    There is no difference between east and west. The difference is between every county. Nothing big. Little things.     I hope i could help you.

We can not pick and choose who are true Christian people. Only God knows our hearts. It is not for any of us to judge the heart of another person. I belive that none of us are sinnless. I am not gay, but I do other things that are just as bad and I try not to do them, I ask for forgiveness for the things I feel are sin. I am sure that there are sins that I commit that I think are ok. I think that as a Christian she would examine her sexual orientation and it would be between her and her Savior. She is not for you nor I to judge at all. (I am gonna catch it for this answer....FIRE AWAY!) So in my opinion she can be gay and a Christian. I know smokers who are Christian.

But active homosexuality is not the only sin and true Christians need to guard against other things too. Every person is enticed by their own desires of the flesh, some may be lying, adultery of the heart, fornication, gluttony, greediness. What ever it is it is resisting the desires and standing to the test, just as Christ Jesus had to on earth. You cannot repent and still continue in willful sin. The basis of forgiveness is to repent and cease from the sin any further. To turn around.  Acts 3:19-20 "Repent, therefore, and turn around so as to get YOUR sins blotted out, that seasons of refreshing may come from the person of Jehovah 20?and that he may send forth the Christ appointed for YOU, Jesus."<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  1 Timothy 1:8-11<br>  .?.?.Now we know that the Law is fine provided one handles it lawfully 9?in the knowledge of this fact, that law is promulgated, not for a righteous man, but for persons lawless and unruly, ungodly and sinners, lacking loving-kindness, and profane, murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, manslayers, 10?fornicators, men who lie with males, kidnappers, liars, false swearers, and whatever other thing is in opposition to the healthful teaching 11?according to the glorious good news of the happy God, with which I was entrusted.<br>  <br>  1 Corinthians 6:9-11<br>  .?.?.Do YOU not know that unrighteous persons will not inherit God’s kingdom? Do not be misled. Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men kept for unnatural purposes, nor men who lie with men, 10?nor thieves, nor greedy persons, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners will inherit God’s kingdom. 11?And yet that is what some of YOU were. But YOU have been washed clean, but YOU have been sanctified, but YOU have been declared righteous in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and with the spirit of our God.<br>  <br>  Galatians 5:16-18<br>  .?.?.But I say, Keep walking by spirit and YOU will carry out no fleshly desire at all. 17?For the flesh is against the spirit in its desire, and the spirit against the flesh; for these are opposed to each other, so that the very things that YOU would like to do YOU do not do. 18?Furthermore, if YOU are being led by spirit, YOU are not under law.

The Vatican State has Italian its official language. The official language of the Holy See (not the same thing as the Vatican State) has Latin as its official language, however, almost no-one can speak it anymore, even within the Vatican, and most of those are over 60. The majority of speakers of Latin nowadays are not based within the Church.

FOzN3xwzaa	Salvation is a ONE TIME moment in a split second, when you believe in Jesus alone for salvation.  Once you believe, you are saved FOREVER and will be in heaven, no matter what!  :) <br>  <br>  The Bible says to KNOW RIGHT NOW that you are saved (1 John 5:13).   The Lord WANTS you to know.  So believe, and KNOW right now!  <br>  <br>  Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation. <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what! <br>  <br>  Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|AA10057370	Salvation is from Jesus.(He paid the debt for sin).<br>  <br>  Read bible<br>  pray<br>  fellowship with other christians that are seeking Jesus.<br>  avoid sin situations<br>  share gospel and help needy<br>  <br>  e-mail me if you have any other questions.

It's like a subconscious thing.  If someone is being rude, and short with you on the phone, you tend to be short back to them.  But if they are really friendly and talking in a happy voice, you will reciprocate.  I would say that he is just doing this ... it probably means he is empathetic.  I don't think he's mocking you.|`|BwJOeHDEaa	Either he likes you and he's juat making fun, or he's being a douchebag..you're jsut going to have to feel out the conversation and determine it yourself.

Go to garage sales, buy and then sell.  Try selling a product door to door in your neighborhood, something everybody has need for in the summer, like bags of charcoal for the BBQ on Friday afternoons, offer to water the gardens, and if you know anybody traveling, offer to pay the light, water, gas bills for a sum. Be sure to let them know what you want the money for.  Make fliers for your neighbors to call you on your cell to make special deliveries.  But the best is where you can get tips.|`|SsEAvhs7aa	Mow their lawn twice a week and you should get to that amount of money during the summer.

And upside down stars aren't satanic, they are upside down stars. The Pentagram is a symbol far older than Christianity, and thus could not possibly be satanic, It is an Ancient Alchemist symbol.    I dont care for anyone to go to hell, nor do I care if I go to hell. I really have no opinions either way about it.      And why would someone dis Jesus? well when 70% of the planet doesn't care about him, he isn't revered.

Stephen F. Roberts: I contend we are both atheists, I just believe in one fewer god than you do.

Doom and Quake and games like that are premised around hell and demons...  What the hell did you expect?  Are really afraid of going to hell because of a damn video game?  Life isn't about fear of hell or desire of heaven.      Did you know that god kills 33,000,000 people in the bible and that satan only kills 10?  Maybe that's why some people prefer satan.      People don't did Jesus, most people completely agree with Jesus' philosophy, it's just Jesus' followers that mess it up for everyone.|`|6jAVElX7aa	playing a satanic game, then you are also offending our Lord and Saviour Christ Jesus. There is not one of us who hasnt offended or caused Him grief at some time or another. This is the reason He came to earth, so that by believing on Him, we can receive forgiveness of sins. and turn away from anything that He does not bless  And I imagine a lot of things are sold strictly to make money.|`|fFmbqLf4aa	i have a few things for you to consider.  Doom and Quake are just video games and all of this 'satanist' iconography surely must fit into the plot some how.  and did you know that the pentagram (your upside down stars) are not actually satanic, they've been adopted by Hollywood to make things interesting and then in turn used as a satanic symbol by people who follow movie satanism.|`|UmdKqP5kaa	Ok, we know we don't create each other and we don't come to this world from nowhere because when we die we must be going somewhere as well, hence there must be God, if there were many Gods, they would have fought over what to be created and what not to be, probably over who to die and who to live at the same time... so it's gotta be one God... if that God created us then there must be a reason... could we figure it out on our own? God made it easy and sent us messengers and prophets to show us the way and tell us why... so all the messengers and all the religions are from the same only God, so they've got to be complementary to each other, not opposing each other!!! then God must have said His final words in the last message, what is the last message? and how do we know it's the last one? I guess that would be the religion that believes in all messengers and all books equally... is there such religion? actually yes, Islam does :)  A True Muslim (man or woman) gets his reward for obeying Allah's orders (Allah means The God in Arabic) by going to heaven, where he/she are indulged forever in all the good thing s that were on earth and more, things no one ever dreamt of or heard about. The Holy Quran tells Muslims (men and women) there will be good food, good wine and sex in heaven for all, but not in the bestial way you may think of, but rather in a way that is satisfactory for everyone and better than what was on earth. Heaven is no heartbreak or injustice land.  True Muslims are no terrorists, and Islam never calls for that, Islam means peace, it bans violence unless you were fought so you fight back, it only doesn't require Muslims to be cowards, and true Muslims understands this very well and never attack civilians.   Islam is the only religion that accepts freedom of religion and asks men to treat women gently like queens.  Muslims don't deny Jesus, they believe in him, love him and respect him so much.  We believe Jesus is NOT dead till today; he wasnt murdered or crucified as most people think. God made the man who betrayed Jesus be killed instead by switching their looks for a moment. Jesus was left up to live in heaven until the end of days when he will come back to earth, make justice prevail instead of oppression, fight the imposter and perform his last prayer before he really dies like other Prophets. So we're waiting for you Jesus, Messenger of God, to bring the world peace and pray with us. Thats what prophet Muhammad told us and this is what I believe in, Im a Muslim  so how do we know it's true? what is said in the last message and what should we do? read the following, and you'll figure out for yourself:|`|xTriyfWuaa	who the hell cares? get over it. jesus as you know him never existed anyway. christianity, satanism, their both just goofy figments of people's imagination.  oh no, i celebrated halloween last year, i must be a satanist!   gimmie a break.|`|SeVyIfQ6aa	uhhh...it's a game, if you think playing a video game is the same as worshipping anything or anybody, you have issues.|`|OefOHgPFaa	you're nuts buddy.|`|pbTtiPqOaa	Are you insinuating that you are better than everyone else?

Games are for joking around and being free without worrying about religion or the real world. i doubt that the satanism you see is there to dis jesus. satanism doesn't dis Jesus. satanism is believing in both god and satan but you see satan as a more fair ruler. It not that hard to understand. and its just a game, its for enjoyment not to question or cause dispute with your religious beliefs|`|mP6naFLDaa	Playing this game doesent make you satanic and people who worship satan belive that satan will give them the bigger end of a deal if they follow him when in all reality the get punished worse and some people cant imagine someone going through that much suffering so they could be jerks and still be forgiven|`|5Smw52iTaa	Your religion is just a myth. Get over it! You believe in legends.    It's totally ok to dis something which didn't even exist in the first place! Especially if there aren't any consequences, because heaven and hell don't exist either.|`|4hNWBpHZaa	Quake had satanic messages you have got to be kidding me?    doom too right?|`|23e6287b78d1587e57b2d262f45629b1aa	If you like a game and stop playing it because of supposed pentagrams, that's pretty crazy. They have no meaning unless you give them meaning. If they have a Satanic message and you feel you do not want to play, that is fine, but if you do not give the symbols that kind of power, they will no longer have that power over you.     You ask a lot of questions here on philosophy and if you are really looking for religious answers of why people chose to do what they do, asking Yahoo probably isn't the best place for theology as most answerers (no offense) are not educated enough in religious philosophy to tell you the "hows" and "whys" people do what they do. But I do suggest if you are interested in it, to take it up as a major in college.|`|EtMW3RY0aa	"lmfao. okay?? who cares?"|`|74c8b30f822cbd858ebede507e67269caa	Well I guess I will get thumbs downed for this but study why Jesus was crucified. Back in the days the worse thing you could do was blasphemy...claiming to be God.So that is why Jesus was crucified.    (I am a Jew and I believe in the Bible. Old Testament. Hosea 13:4  God told us there was no other savior but him).  Now all these games and stuff I do not know much about. I know when I was a kid they said that if you played Stairway to Heaven backwards it had satanic statements. But heck, I listen to the song forward not backward. So if something makes you feel evil or gives you bad, dangerous or evil thoughts-then don't play it.|`|yu53u5TFaa	Not everyone believes that Jesus actually did those things or that he was even a real guy. I could just as easily ask you why you refuse to follow Mohammad. He went to *all* the trouble of sitting in a deep, dark cave for years getting the Koran dictated to him. Why do you dis Mohammad? Oh right, you don't believe in him. Not everyone believes in Jesus.    I can hear what you're saying now. "Mohammad never died for our sins." Well, Jesus never sat in a ******* cave writing the Koran, did he? You can't judge one religion by the tenets of another one. That'd be like me saying Jesus doesn't exist because he never mentioned how to get to Mount Olympus.    And I'm sorry you won't allow yourself to play games anymore.

Thanks!    -Whitechapel|`|yu53u5TFaa	Its such a joke when people want to be "hardcore" and Christian at the same time. Sorry, not trying to be a dick or anything here, but the two lifestyles are mutually exclusive.    Hardcore, alternative, punk--rock in general--is centered on rebellion and independence and emerged as a BACKLASH to antiquated conservative traditional "family" sensibilities and morals, including Christianity, all of which enforce conformity and groupthink. Its a REACTION to your religion, not compatible with it.|`|0NWLcj4Caa	if you look them up on myspace.com and click on "see all blogs" or something like that, they have a big q and a thing    they arent't christian, but they aren't satanic either    but i do have a respectable list of bands that are both christian and heavy, if you're interested    and seriously not trying to mock you or anything, i swear, but with a statement like"its such a joke..." you may not be trying to sound like a dick, but that's how it comes off as  and its no harm done, i'm not taking it personally or anything..just letting you know

In order to relieve ourselves of suffering and attain a perfect, pure mind, we must dispense with this desire.  Once the desire is gone, the body is gone.  By the time you reached that stage, you would understand the total unimportance of the body and would want to be rid of it.  Anyway, when we reincarnate, we take on new bodies all the time (until enlightenment).

AA11840819	When I was told that my mother had a heart attack and was dead.  She had not even been sick and it was the day before Thanksgiving.  She had fixed her turkey ready to cook in the fridge and gone into town. When she came home she sat down with my dad to eat a hot dog and she clutched her chest and died.  I cried like a baby.  She was my mom whom I loved dearly.  My daughter was not quite two at the time.  Took me years to not cry every time I thought about it.  I still miss her and it has been 30 years.

Having my career shot down, while depressed really shattered what little self-confidence I had at the time.

May Billy RIP.|`|KBxz1Wfyaa	I was and still am a fan.  So many great songs like "Sweet Home Alabama" and "Simple Man."  In 2005 Donnie and Johnny released a CD that is excellent.  It went gold on the title song "Right With The Man."  They were nominated for a CMA award and deserved it.  Every song makes a connection with everyday working folks.   My daughter took me to a Hank Williams Jr concert in Evansville, IN back in 2006.  What a surprise when 38 Special with Donnie Van Zant as the opening act appeared.  Nothing on the tickets let us know who the opening act was.  He sang "Right With The Man" at that concert.    I am sorry to hear about Billy Powell.  What a loss.  Does anyone remember the VH1 special where they interviewed Billy and other members of Lynyrd Skynyrd recalling the plane crash.  Such a tragedy.    Here are the words to "Get Right With The Man"  Well Granddaddy was a hillbilly, scholar blue collar of a man  He came from the school where you didn't need nothing   if you could Make it with your own two hands   He was backwoods, backwards, used words like no sir, yes ma'am,   by God be darned, hell yeah I'm American!   And all the years he walked this Earth, I swear all he did was work  He said the devil dreams on an idle horse, so you listen to me squirt!   Don't get too high on the bottle and get right with the Man  Fight your fights, find the grace in all the things that you can't change  And help somebody, if you can   Now Granny said son, I'd stick to your gun and said,   if you believe in something no matter what  Cause its better to be hated for who you are than beloved for who you're not   She was 5 feet of concrete, New York born and raised on the slick city street  She'd cold stare you down, stand her ground, still kickin' and screamin' at 93   I remember just how frail she looked in that hospital bed,   taking her last few breaths of life, smilin' as she said   Don't get too high on the bottle, just a little sip every now and then  Fight your fights, find the grace, in all the things that you can't change  And help somebody if you can  And get right with the Man   I never let a cowboy make the coffee  Yeah, that's what granny always said to my Granddad  And he'd say, never tell a joke that ain't that funny more than once  And if you wanna hear God laugh, tell him your plans   Don't get too high on the bottle  Get right with the Man, son  Fight your fights, find the grace in all the things that you can't change  And help somebody if you can  And get right with the Man|`|FdOjT08saa	Definitely a huge fan.  All my children too.  I live in J-ville the bands hometown.  I've worked with and been around many of their friends, family etc.  Skynard, .38 Special,Rossington Collins are well loved.  Billy was classical pianist who put the intro to Free Bird and really made the song even more special.  Each individual in the original and the bands brought together since the plane crash have carried on a unique sound and tradition.  They are surely Rocking in Heaven.|`|TrBZvXfzaa	SWEET HOME ALABAMA!

Remember that!    Also, you should definitely eat at least something little an hour or two before you go. Going on an empty stomach is a terrible idea. You don't want to pass out afterwards!
UmdKqP5kaa	Ok, we know we don't create each other and we don't come to this world from nowhere because when we die we must be going somewhere as well, hence there must be God, if there were many Gods, they would have fought over what to be created and what not to be, probably over who to die and who to live at the same time... so it's gotta be one God... if that God created us then there must be a reason... could we figure it out on our own? God made it easy and sent us messengers and prophets to show us the way and tell us why... so all the messengers and all the religions are from the same only God, so they've got to be complementary to each other, not opposing each other!!! then God must have said His final words in the last message, what is the last message? and how do we know it's the last one? I guess that would be the religion that believes in all messengers and all books equally... is there such religion? actually yes, Islam does :)  A True Muslim (man or woman) gets his reward for obeying Allah's orders (Allah means The God in Arabic) by going to heaven, where he/she are indulged forever in all the good thing s that were on earth and more, things no one ever dreamt of or heard about. The Holy Quran tells Muslims (men and women) there will be good food, good wine and sex in heaven for all, but not in the bestial way you may think of, but rather in a way that is satisfactory for everyone and better than what was on earth. Heaven is no heartbreak or injustice land.  True Muslims are no terrorists, and Islam never calls for that, Islam means peace, it bans violence unless you were fought so you fight back, it only doesn't require Muslims to be cowards, and true Muslims understands this very well and never attack civilians.   Islam is the only religion that accepts freedom of religion and asks men to treat women gently like queens.  Muslims don't deny Jesus, they believe in him, love him and respect him so much.  We believe Jesus is NOT dead till today; he wasnt murdered or crucified as most people think. God made the man who betrayed Jesus be killed instead by switching their looks for a moment. Jesus was left up to live in heaven until the end of days when he will come back to earth, make justice prevail instead of oppression, fight the imposter and perform his last prayer before he really dies like other Prophets. So we're waiting for you Jesus, Messenger of God, to bring the world peace and pray with us. Thats what prophet Muhammad told us and this is what I believe in, Im a Muslim  so how do we know it's true? what is said in the last message and what should we do? read the following, and you'll figure out for yourself:  rasoulallah(dot)net--  islam-guide(dot)com--  islamreligion(dot)com-- and   http://www.whyislam.org/Prophethood/Prop...|`|UutLVO2Laa	It would be like going back in time, by about 500 years.|`|vNvtwuBfaa	I just hope they start using a guillotine by time they cut my head off because I don't want it to be slowly sawed off with a dull knife.|`|mC4mnvGFaa	no, it would be a blood bath.

It is historically accurate and archaeologically accurate.  The more scientists and historians try to prove it wrong, the more the end up proving it right.|`|AnkIzRXWaa	Yep, not one, but a lot more....|`|91XGHfSaaa	Let's count the bollocks in that question.

The only places where there might have been "contradictions" are the places where numbers were recorded. ie- Jesus fed the 4000 (or five thousand, depending on whose story). But yeah, the Bible is super cool, because it's true!|`|ZhR4QPymaa	Let's read the bible and learn that women should obey their master husbands!    There are definitely contradictions.  In fact the God of the Old Testament seemed rather wrathful, while Jesus preached peace, forgiveness, and understanding.  The important thing I suppose is the message you gather from it.  Jesus' message whether you believe him fictional, prophet, or messiah, has a very good message about how all humans should treat one another.    Well, there are certain organisms that can reproduce sexually and asexually.  This was probably the case of the first divergence of gender.  Sexual reproduction has advantages by allowing the fit to reproduce as well as very important genetic variation. The more genetic variation in a species, the less 'unfit' mutations, and more liklihood that the species as a whole will survive in case of a sudden change in environment that those that were considered less fit, are now more fit.  Actually, strong emotional attachments increase odds of survival. A pack of animals, or a group of humans that share their kills are more likely to be fed than a single hunter.  Ex. Say as a skilled hunter, I am able to catch prey every so often, and put in a lot of effort to do it.  Now, in a group of 5, let's say each person individually has an equal chance of trapping prey, however it's not consistent.  However, if they share their kills, they are more likely to be well fed every day, rather than every so often.  This 'group' hunting helped forge bonds of looking out for one another, because it truly helped self-preservation.|`|Z9WBVWhqaa	Did you read the Bible...and still if you say there is no contradictions then you are mentally retarded.|`|db7df25ea31227e5641d5c32d43c3bcdaa	i agree|`|eDX2ESrcaa	God bless you|`|hR7OsqtRaa	You may be believing in God. Iam writing below for people who dont.    Who created Humans.? People may say The Big Bang. Then Who Created the Big Bang.? Particles ? Who created the particles ? I can keep going on and on.  Answer : Humans are not real since there is no evidence of their evolution.  Would you accept the above argument. ?  If I tell you Who Created God, then you would say Who created the one who created God and it would go on and on.  We know God is real, since we are real. If you deny God, then you have to deny your own existence, which is impossible. No matter how knowledgable or intelligent you are, you cannot deny that there has to be a supernatural force that has created our planet and our body and, that creator is God.      In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"    The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.    There are a lot more chapters and verses mentioned in the below website along with music, speeches and praise and worship.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    Jesus is God. He is alive forever.    The questions usually asked are:-    1) Did Jesus really exist?  2) Is Jesus God?  3) If Jesus is God, then why did He keep praying to the Father in Heaven? How can the Father and Jesus be one God? Why did Jesus have to suffer on the Cross?  4) What is the Holy Spirit?  5) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?      It would not be possible to give a short answer to these questions .    I suggest you visit the below website.    After visiting the below website, you would get a lot of answers.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus  specifically.)  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became  flesh (John 1:1-14)  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as  "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT  (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)  16. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) and "God" also be called the  Mighty God in Isaiah 10:21  17. Jesus is able to raise Himself from the dead (John 2:19-21)  18. Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things  by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship  is used in each place.)  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts  7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father  that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John  8:58.  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see  Exodus 3:14.  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).  26. Jesus is the One who will judge you on judgement day (John 5:22-23). Only God can be the judge.  27. Jesus forgives sins (Luke 5:20) (Luke 24:47,Acts 10:43) .Only God can forgive sins.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com|`|6jAVElX7aa	I dont know if there are contradictions, as one person would not necessarily state things in the same way as another, but I do know that throughout the Bible the message is that God is just, faithfull and abounding in steadfast love and mercy.

Those that say otherwise are sinners themselves so you can't take their word over mine.  "Those that are non sinners cast the first stone."

I'm a believer who also allows for the probability that our  version of the scriptures we have now are highly flawed, that the Emperor Constantine altered and dictated much that ended up in (or didn't end up in) the version the (at the time the Roman Catholic) Church gave us, that whole sections and books were left out (like the Gospels of Mary and Judas).    The fact than these books have been discovered and disclosed after all these years should tell any intelligent Christian that the version of the bible we accept has it's flaws.    Do a little serious research. Use your brain. You can have faith without it having to be 'blind' faith.     To deny the obvious contradictions is to deny logic and knowledge.

Edit: You want proof of contradictions? How about you go and read the Torah, which predates Christianity (and, aka, Jesus) and then compare it to what the Christians call the "Old Testament." It is blatantly obvious that Christianity edited out that which wouldn't allow their oh-so-precious "Jesus" be the messiah. He didn't fulfill all necessary prophecies, which prophecies say must be completed in a single lifetime. That alone shows that the entire new testament is a contradiction of the original beliefs, and that Christianity is nothing more than a "newer religion" worshiping this man called Jesus.

Creation of the earth is PROVED to be false, evolution is fact, provable and our knowledge of it is continually being improved.  You may choose to ignore proof of evolution in favour of your belief, but it is a fact even if you don't like it.  Anyway, you can't provide evidence of something that doesn't exist - it's just not possible.  What part of the bible has been proved true?  Apart from some geographical detail there is nothing in that book that can be proved.  Why?  Because it didn't happen and it's not true.    But people are gonna believe what they want....    Have a look at this web site - it'not about proving or diproving anything - just simply points out hundreds of contradictions in the text of the bible  http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/|`|hV48lhvqaa	Of course, because that was God.

lR6Ocjm1aa	In Alaska I use to go out on the Tundra outside of Barrow Alaska...and Listen to the Silence most of the Time .....was good......Also the northern Lights can be Noisy at times as they do their Electrical Dance,It sounds like the Wind Dancing but no wind ,only  light .    Went on many  Cave tours ......When they turn out the lights and ask for silence  awesome feeling.....We have much to be thankful for we just don't thank him enough......Thank you for the recall....Agape    You too dog lover|`|GbHvB6nFaa	Have you ever stayed a place where it is very dark  ?    At firist it's relaxing but arfter a while you go loopy|`|cbZdeOSPaa	I have stayed in a very quiet place for a while but didn't feel anxious or anything, I felt relaxed and comfortable instead, you know, sometimes we need a little time away from noise just to meditate or distress ourselves.|`|AA10671142	I don't mind the quiet. it does not bother me at all. sometimes I enjoy it when it is quiet in the house. then when a plane flies over head, I jump because of the loud noise|`|7pBjLKIjaa	Yes.     I enjoyed the quiet, actually.|`|9XA7KxK5aa	No.  My brain works all the time, when it is quiet in the middle of the night or when my dogs bark crazily, I dont hear anything at all and I never have the nervous feeling neither.      Sometimes my mom was mad at me and asked me why I didnt stop the dogs barking, I replied her " sorry, I didnt hear them bark....... "|`|I5P2bbgWaa	no I like it quiet|`|vS1Z0inOaa	I don't know if my answer counts because I consider myself deaf, but I do have 15% useable hearing when I wear my hearing aid in one ear.     Anyway, I think it really depends on what kind of silence it is, the person's background, and how much of it at a time. All of us need noise sometimes and silence sometimes. (There is never TOTAL silence, because if a hearing person were to step into a sound proof room where there is absolutely no sound, he or she would hear their own sounds like heartbeat, breathing, etc. We don't normally hear those things, but when it gets quiet those things become loud.) Also for many of us who enjoy silence, silence also goes along with being alone and all of us need to be alone sometimes.     Where I live it is kind of country-ish, so if there are no people in our house it gets quiet. But you can still hear floorboards squeak, animals playing in the attic, the wind blowing the tree branches on our roof, etc. (Again, those things become loud when it gets quiet.) That used to be what I called peaceful silence... But when I lived at a school in downtown Chicago for five months, I would hear sirens going by my dorm room window every 15 minutes and my roommates always had music going and there were always others passing by in the hall (even in the middle of the night!) and the student lounge/game room was just down the hall from me. At first the noise drove me to distraction and I couldn't sleep, even when I took my hearing aid out and heard nothing my brain would still make up noise.     But I got used to it, and then when I went back home and the house would be quiet all day while my parents were gone to work I had the radio going full volume because the quiet was spooky to me. Now I'm used to that again as I've been home for four years, and now I like it sometimes.     In the morning, in fact, noise makes me cranky. So I don't put my hearing aid in until I am fully awake; that way I hear nothing, not even the floorboards squeaking. But if my parents are gone all day I'll turn the radio on for part of the day because I need a balance--too much noise bothers me and too much quiet does too.     Along those lines, when I lived with another friend for a short time I was usually with other people all dy and when we were both home she had the radio or TV going LOUD (she's also deaf) all the time, so when she was gone to work and I was home alone I really enjoyed it. But if I were home alone most of the time, I would've enjoyed my time with the other people or her being there with the TV on more.|`|wF2G3Krcaa	I think it's really wierd, it depends on where I am. Like last night, there was a black out and I didn't hear anyone or anything. Then all of a sudden this stupid kid starts laughing really loud like a villain or something.

Facts are subject to change.Jesus said God's word is truth. Truth will always change facts. It may be a fact you have cancer. But truth says, " by the stripes of Jesus you are healed." 11Corinthians 4:18.While we do not look at the things which are seen,but at the things that are not seen.For the things that are seen are temporal( temporary, subject to change)but the things not seen are eternal or not subject to change.      God's word is eternal. The eternal things will change the temporal things.Cancer is subject to change by the eternal word that says you are healed by Jesus's stripes. We do not deny the existence of disease. We do deny its right to exist in our bodies.Because we are joint-heirs of Jesus. His body was healed on resurrection day , so we should be healed .

I don't know if they use the Yahoo logo or not, since I have  yet to get one. But they warn that there can be a virus attached to  the bogus alerts and such supposedly sent from Yahoo. Close down  and run a virus scan to see what shows up. Check your security  settings, to make sure you are on a high level. I'll bet what's going on  may be a virus attacking you. So run the scan and then if you do  find something isolate and destroy it before it can do more harm to  your hard drive. That's what I'd do anyway.      Also email Custmer Care at Yahoo, and alet them to your problem.     And make sure you reboot and start over again.  EDIT:  I just checked a post from customer care for a link for  you. Here is their referral link: Abuse@yahoo.com/ for any  mail that may be bogus and not from Yahoo. They said to  send them the headers from the post you received.

I used to read a lot of comics and just about anything I could get my hands on.    She was a drug addict and kept me in confinement from age 8--12 until I managed to run away and live with my dad in another state.    I became the best reader in grade school because I used to act out the characters and my teachers and fellow students used to love hearing me read out loud. All of that changed after middle school because I had to quit school so I could work for my pops but I caught up with my education later on plus the years I spent working for dad was a great education in itself.

Lj1ET4sYaa	During trials we grow.  Our patience can be increased and they can help us to realize the blessings in life.  Depending on the trial, other aspects of our personality can grow too.

Lets say you work metals, remember a blacksmith??  So there you are, you have a big chuck of steel and are going top make a sword, but the metal breaks as you begin to shape it.  Thusly, you return the steel to the smelting pot, because there are too many impurities that need to be cooked off.  It much the same thing with the daily trials we experience.    You must go before the Lord God Almighty and give up your sin, you must ask for forgiveness and in return the Lord will grant you the "Wisdom" only He has.  With this Wisdom, you again lool at the situation and realize where the discrepancy is, after fixing it, you find the satisfaction of a good job.  The end result is what was meant to be all along, but you would never know this, if you hadn't asked for the Lord's intervention.    Being born, is a gimmee and so is your death, it's what happens every single day, easy or tough, that actually defines whether you have lived a happy and fulfilled life.  Stuggles are meant to strengthen you, we have finite minds, we can't see the future, therefore it is one step after another.  The Lord is always present and is waiting to help you with "anything" that comes along, His wisdom will bear you up through it all.

God made it easy and sent us messengers and prophets to show us the way and tell us why... so all the messengers and all the religions are from the same only God, so they've got to be complementary to each other, not opposing each other!!! then God must have said His final words in the last message, what is the last message? and how do we know it's the last one? I guess that would be the religion that believes in all messengers and all books equally... is there such religion? actually yes, Islam does :)  A True Muslim (man or woman) gets his reward for obeying Allah's orders (Allah means The God in Arabic) by going to heaven, where he/she are indulged forever in all the good thing s that were on earth and more, things no one ever dreamt of or heard about. The Holy Quran tells Muslims (men and women) there will be good food, good wine and sex in heaven for all, but not in the bestial way you may think of, but rather in a way that is satisfactory for everyone and better than what was on earth. Heaven is no heartbreak or injustice land.  True Muslims are no terrorists, and Islam never calls for that, Islam means peace, it bans violence unless you were fought so you fight back, it only doesn't require Muslims to be cowards, and true Muslims understands this very well and never attack civilians.   Islam is the only religion that accepts freedom of religion and asks men to treat women gently like queens.  Muslims don't deny Jesus, they believe in him, love him and respect him so much.  We believe Jesus is NOT dead till today; he wasnt murdered or crucified as most people think. God made the man who betrayed Jesus be killed instead by switching their looks for a moment. Jesus was left up to live in heaven until the end of days when he will come back to earth, make justice prevail instead of oppression, fight the imposter and perform his last prayer before he really dies like other Prophets. So we're waiting for you Jesus, Messenger of God, to bring the world peace and pray with us. Thats what prophet Muhammad told us and this is what I believe in, Im a Muslim  so how do we know it's true? what is said in the last message and what should we do? read the following, and you'll figure out for yourself:|`|2Xh1ywWRaa	what about people who marry someone they haven't met like arranged  marriages?next question please|`|U7sBZKUuaa	You don't really love some stranger in any of the ways you listed, but in older English, love was often used for 'charity', and you can 'love' the world by doing charitable things, never actually meeting the people who benefit from your actions.|`|KmnbjZIdaa	No, we cannot really love a stranger, knowledge is a prerequisite to love.  But when we help a stranger, say a beggar, we are supposed to be giving the alms for the sake of our love for God.  That is why a christian cannot live the gospel unless he knows and love God. Incidentally the highest form of love is the last one, unconditional, because it is an act of the will and not feeling or emotion.|`|GE6vqqF8aa	I think we can "care" for other people, and some would call that a form of love. Many times, people confuse love with lust. So for as loving someone to a point that we have personal feelings that transcend superficiality and we are willing to make sacrifices for that person, it takes time. Being "in love" with someone also takes time. I've dated girls I've met on-line and they'd tell me that they love me before we even met. Now, I'm not so sure about that. I think some people are lonely and are just in love with the idea of being in love.

What people love as God could be nothing more than a conception born of solipsism, accepted as true by tradition or because of the feeling of security people get when they know other people accept it as well, which would be more like a "collective solipsism".     God, conceived as the being who gave order to the universe, as a principle of order, does exist. As for a personal God, I think it might exist, but it is impossible to prove it.     A great deal of brilliant people (and not so brilliant as well) have always attempted to prove the existence of a personal God. But many of them, if not all, have started with "theological axioms": statements that do not need demonstration, like the existence of God himself. Therefore, what follows is a completely logical and coherent argument, but that still fails to really proof the existence of God. Descartes is a clear example of this, even when I admire him a great deal.    St. Thomas Aquinas, on the other hand, deserves a special mention. He might be the sole exception to the "thelogical axiom" line of argument. He proves the existence of an intelligent being through his Quinquae Viae, which is founded in reason alone, as well as in the texts of Aristotle. But then again, an intelligent, superior being, which definitely exists, does not mean that a personal God exists, which can exist, but can't be proven.|`|AA10723688	you can love someone's point of view... and yes that someone could very well be an actual total stranger.... ;)    ``|`|u33x2hqzaa	I don't believe so and agree that it does diminish the meaning of the word.

I believe that it is possible to have a general affinity for someone that you do not know, but only insofar as a general sense of admiration of character, liking or compassion towards them. I do believe that it is impossible to love, by definition of the word, a complete and total stranger. Love is such a deep emotion that encompasses more than the physical attributes that i feel in order to truly exercise this emotion towards someone, you must know them intimately, wholly and completely.  Love is unconditional, it surpasses the outward actions and appearances and overlooks character flaws, bad days or the temporary lousy disposition. It is more than emotional, it is spiritual and it cannot be extended towards or granted to someone that you do not know at all. To adore someone wholly, you must first know them, intimately.

Browse the web for german audio labs,|`|FqRaTTPpaa	Of course there are a lot of little things you could work on, but here are a few that I noticed:    Stop ending sentences as questions, and don't end long words as questions.  If you listen to yourself, you'll know what I mean.  The intonation of German is actually quite similar to English, where a regular sentence goes down at the end.    Take another look at the umlauts.  You're pronouncing them just like regular vowels.  for is not the same as fr.    You've got a pretty strong American R.  It's most obvious marker of an American, and usually the hardest one to overcome.  First, not every R in a German word is pronounced (at least not as we think of pronouncing an R).  End-of-word Rs are usually pretty much omitted.  For instance, the word "aber" sounds more like "aba".  If there's an R in the middle of a word, like "Schraube", it's really hard to pronounce, because it has to be vocalized deep in the throat.  If you can't manage that yet, at least work on flipping the R (prepare your mouth to say R but insert a bit of an L).    Not too bad.  To really improve, you'll have to go to a German-speaking country and just hear it for yourself.
Zadysvg5aa	It would be logistically impossible to distribute the millions of easter eggs, to every shop in the country in a 4 week period prior to Easter. For that reason the big Multiples start taking deliveries into their warehousing immediately after Xmas. They then release them to their branches in staggered deliveries throughout January/ March. Because they are so bulky and branch warehousing is at such a premium, they are put on sale, in advance to try and free up warehousing capacity.   Cadbury Creme Eggs are only available to the trade for January/ February, and distribution is withdrawn after that. It takes 12 more months production to replenish the stock sold during that period.|`|EBqFpZbjaa	Easter Eggs usually go on sale here in UK immediately after Christmas.

Rl1Qqcqzaa	Both are Christians.  I am unfamiliar with the term "judaic Christian" but i am very familiar with the term "messianic jew".    Don't be surprised if your question and/or my answer is deleted for "violating community guidelines or terms of service." A few so-called "messianic Jews" flood Yahoo!answers using their multiple accounts with "abuse" reports whenever there is any question that even approaches exposing them for what they really are.    "Messianic Jews" are a bizarre Christian cult who refuse to acknowledge that they are Christians and instead insist they are Jews! Instead of following the tenants of Judaism, they (1) worship Jesus, (2) believe in virgin birth, (3) believe that sins are atoned by human sacrifice, (4) believe in the divinity of Jesus, (5) believe that Jesus was the son of God, (6) read, study, and follow the New Testament, etc., etc., etc--all these things and much more that they do and believe in are Christian and none of these things are Jewish. Therefore, calling themselves Jews as they do is nothing but FRAUDULENT, DECEPTIVE, and DESPICABLE. It is sickening and pathetic how they insert THEIR Christianity into all of OUR holidays and holy days and claim the result is Judaism. What they are doing as far as Judaism is concerned is nothing less than blasphemy.    No Jew on earth accepts them as being any part of our religion in any way. They should be denounced by everyone who stands up for righteousness and honor and truthfulness--not of course because they believe in Jesus--but instead because they make a mockery of Judaism by claiming Judaism is something other than what it is. No Jew worships anyone other than one God, a God who did not have a son sent to earth, born to a virgin, died on the cross, rose again, etc. etc. etc as is believed by Christians. Period. The Christian New Testament is NOT part of our bible. Period.    To get some example of how bizarre they really are consider this: Can one deny Jesus, say he never even existed, and still be a Christian? Of course not, and the same reasoning applies to these so-called "messianic Jews"--one can not believe in Jesus and be Jewish simultaneously. Christians who feel the need to take up what they think is a Jewish lifestyle without letting go of their Christian beliefs really need to come up with another name for themselves rather than misappropriate ours. They, including their fraudulent "messianic rabbis" are living a lie by calling themselves Jews. All sane, rational people, no matter what their religion happens to be, know these people are NOT Jews (except the "messianic Jews" themselves).    edit:  Is there some better term than a "bizarre cult " for a group of Christians who refuse to call themselves Christians and who instead go by the name of a religion that does not even recognize the Christian god they worship?  It seems fitting to me.|`|wU0c3i7baa	Well in the first, the modifier is "messianic" and the noun is "jew," which indicates that it's a Jew who also believes Jesus is the Messiah. Jews for Jesus fall into this category.    In the second one, "Judaic" modifies "Christian, " which indicates that it's a Christian who adheres to some Jewish beliefs/practices. Though I've never heard this term, I think it would apply to Seventh Day Adventists who are Christian, but don't believe in Hell, celebrate the sabbath on Saturday, and keep kosher.|`|38vza5Gxaa	answer: none.

As a Messianic Jew, I can answer your question.  I'm not a Christian, I'm a Torah-observant Jew.  Many in my congregation are Messianic, but not Jews, nor do they claim to be.  They are, however, Torah-observant and not Christians.    There is a group called Jews for Jesus who are Christians.  And they evangelize Jews to get them to leave Judaism and become Christians.  We Messianics believe this is not a good thing.  As we've already seen in Yahoo, it causes a lot of bad feelings from and toward Jews.    I hope I've answered your question, but if there is more you would like to know about Messianic Judaism, please contact me.    Shalom,    D1|`|hceNM6Uxaa	Both terms are nonsensical.  Different, maybe, but neither makes sense.    In one sense, all Jews are messianic, but the group that terms itself "Messianic Judaism" is following a religion that believes Jesus is the messiah.  Since Jesus doesn't fulfil the Jewish prophecies for the Jewish messiah, it is clearly dishonest to pretend that the religion they are following is Judaism.  They claim it isn't Christianity either - fair enough, not that I understand why, but they need to find a term that doesn't hijack the name of another religion.    I am uncertain what a Judaic Christian would mean.  Judaism and Christianity are two entirely different religions which, although they share a document, in some ways (the Hebrew Tanakh is rearranged and translated and very differently interpreted as the "Old Testament), the rest of what makes up the two religions is as unalike as chalk and cheese.  So the term seems no different from eg Islamic Christian, Christian Hindu, etc.|`|ygbhsZ2Zaa	The terms they use in their fraudulent, lying, vile impersonation of us ('us' being real Jews).

A Messianic Jew is a person that was born Jewish and believes that Jesus is the Messiah. Judaism is a "Tribal" religion which complicates matters of belief and who is and is not "part of the tribe" There are also people that are Christians that are calling themselves Messianic Jews who have never gone through proper conversion.   Some here will say that there is no relationship between Christianity and Judaism but all the Apostles and all but one of the writers of the New Testament were Jews. They all claimed that Christianity came from Judaism. This had lead to a problem for some and it has become impossible for them to not have a difficulties with the mere existence of Christianity. One person wrote of the feeling of oppression of growing up as a minority in the US where everyone around them was of another Religion and that religion believed that they were not following their own messiah. Add to that all the horrible things Christians have done to Jews for the last 1,700 years and it becomes easy to understand the often not so nice attitude. It is compounded by a tiny minority of Evangelical Christians that have made it their duty to convert Jews to Christianity. This has let to all kinds of hate being directed toward Christians from a minority of Jews. Most Jews are quite neutral to Christianity, many I have met actually like it but just don't think Jesus was the Messiah and would have preferred better relations through out history. The problem you have hear on R&S is that many of the most vocal anti Christians Jews have banded together with Pagans and are presenting a false version of Christianity and Judaism to "combat Christian missionaries". I do not buy this story. From many of the answers and questions it is very clear that its all about attacking Christianity and Jews that have decided that Jesus actually was the Messiah. As I have said before I don't know any other Jews that behave like this. Its just not the Jewish way to be so disrespectful. They will say anything to win an argument. Another thing you will see a lot is the Misspelling of Jesus's name. If you ask about it they will tell you that they are forbidden to write the name of a "false god" but you will see some times they misspell it some times they don't depending on the context. If they want to appear friendly the spelling rule need no longer apply. So you know it has to be done out of hate then. I sent an email to one about it and she admitted the the name was revolting to her. If you complain then you are an "anti-Semite". These are just a few of many examples of this kind of behavior. I hope this helps you understand. Jews have many opinions on the subject perhaps more opinions that there are Jews. Please don't think that they are all this way, most are kind loving people.|`|RMMdGYCDaa	Messianic Jews are simply Jews who accept Jesus Christ as their savior.  That does not make them any less Jewish.  I would say that a Judaic Christian is basically the same thing but I am not familiar with that term.  Marcuss says, ""Messianic Jews" are a bizarre Christian cult"  and he wonders why his answers get deleted.  He and most of the other "JPA's" despise and hate Messianic Jews.  In fact that is what the JPA is all about.|`|UIhn5LCHaa	Hi there Joe, I have created this website to illustrate the very question you're presenting. This way I don't have to continually have to copy and paste so if you or anyone else like to see my illustration of this please go here:  http://moshiach.faithweb.com/yihudim.htm...|`|aWHvHIr1aa	The answer depends on who you ask as Judaism doesn't have one answer for anything.      As Ambivalent Bittern PJA, expert in Judaism since birth, says,     ***We don't really do final arbitration of doctrine. Judaism is more like a 3500 year argument.***    What you need to know is Christ is the Greek word for Messiah.  The common language was not Hebrew as the Jews were subjects of Rome and having been conquer by Greece.      During this same time period, Solomon's Temple had been rebuilt and renamed Herod's Temple.  Rome even selected who would be the high priest.  In other words, the mandates of the Torah were not being met during this time.    Hope this helps    EDIT    Surely, if Messianic Christian was a fraudulent term, those making the claim could back it up with the scriptures with something intelligent to support their anti-Tanach claim.    Even the most elementary student of the Tanach knows that there isn't one example in the Tanach where the Jew had the religion of their mother changed because of the belief of the child....as a person is born Jewish.      Being born Jewish, there is no way Jews can make the claim that Judaism is a religion unless they are prepared to quiz new borns about their beliefs.      As PaperbackWriter JPA KosherNinja, expert in Judaism since birth,  says,     ***A person who is born to a Jewish mother is Jewish, whether they never set foot in a synagogue or whether they become a Rabbi - they are EQUALLY Jewish.***    As she says, once a Jew, there is no requirement of an infant Jews professing Judaism as their faith.      As the cat's meow, expert in Judaism since birth, says,    ***Atheism doesn't, strange as it may sound, violate Judaism; there are Jewish Atheists. As Atheism doesn't involve worshipping idols or other deities, and as Atheists can and do enjoy and respect the complex ethical structure within Judaism, there's not the conflict that one might expect to find.***    Obviously, if you are an Atheist Jew, you aren't a monotheist who believes in the Hebrew scriptures.      So once again the claim that a person needs to convert to Judaism to be a Jew is just not a commonly held belief.    As Mark S. JPAA, expert in Judaism since birth, says,     ***Most Jewish scholars agree that you cannot convert away from Judaism (there are a minority who say you can convert away). However, this by no means implies that a Jew who joins another religion has the same standing as a Jew who has remained Jewish. A Jew who practices another religion, whether it be Christianity (in any of its forms, including Messianic "Judaism"), Islam or anything else, is known as an "apostate."***    The challenge to Mark's statement is that "apostate" is not found in the thousands of possible examples of Jews practicing another religion found in the Tanach, is there not ONE example where ANY of the divisive and hurtful terms Jews now call their brothers and sisters.    In fact, when Elijah prayed on the mountain, thought he alone was faithful.  That means that if a visitor came to Israel during this time, the king and all of Israel would been seen as worshipping other gods.  If there was a time with the term "apostate" could have been used, it wasn't.    The same thing can be said about the Talmud or oral Torah.  There is no evidence of any of the at least 62 verbal passing to the next generation found in the Tanach.  In addition, it doesn't make sense logically.    If the Talmud was able to be written down 20 years after the revolt against Rome failed, then it could have been written down 20 minutes after Moses came down from the mountain.    If the volume of material was so vast that it couldn't be written down after Moses came down from the mountain, then it couldn't have been written down 1600 years later and be the same thing Moses came down with from the mountain.    Therefore, there is a foreign fire in camp.

They merely wish to keep the rantings of nonbelievers from brainwashing young minds. When those who follow the path that only science can prove God's existence have the opportunity to comprehend all scientific knowledge about all of the universe, then faith will no longer lead to salvation. Absolute scientific proof will be clear for all to see and faith will no longer serve. It will be too late for faith to be a viable conduit for God's grace. The mad dash to understand all things about all things would condemn future generations to live in a world without salvation.

Lk4aCBACaa	Simple, really: there isn't only one, nor are we all following the same one and giving it "different names." :) But you do have a point: those religions that do believe theirs is the only correct one, and that their god is the only true god have had a lot of conflicts with just about everyone who ever dared to disagree with them.    I reject the idea of "one true" god or "one true" religion. My religion isn't "the" right one for anyone but myself; everyone else is free to choose the path that works for them, even if that path is non-belief. Religious beliefs cannot be proven or disproven anyways; all religious people have only their own personal experiences and intuition to go on, neither of which constitute proof to anyone but themselves. Peaceful coexistance would be so much better, but too many people just have this overwhelming desire to consider themselves "right" and argue with everyone they think is "wrong."|`|yFo1GR3gaa	Different interpretations. People should chose the religion they belief and agree with the most.     You can't follow all religions, its Impossible because the teachings can be very contrary.    I believe that wars that started out because of "conflict of belief" is just an excuse to go to war and to gain power.    Every religion is good, It helps develops a persons spirituality and true nature is followed correctly. No religion is "Bad" or "Wrong". It is what  it is.|`|iuyYfQHmaa	The reason there are so many different religions, is because there is a whole bunch of people trying to figure out the ultimate answers of life.

Some have said that the various religions all represent different ways of presenting religious truth. But a comparison of their teachings and practices with the Bible indicates, rather, that the diversity of religions is because people have become followers of men instead of listening to God. It is noteworthy that, to a large extent, teachings they hold in common, but that differ from the Bible, originated in ancient Babylon.  Who is the instigator of such religious confusion? The Bible identifies Satan the Devil as the god of this system of things. (2?Cor. 4:4) It warns us that the things which the nations sacrifice they sacrifice to demons, and not to God. (1?Cor. 10:20) How vitally important, then, to make sure that we really are worshiping the true God, the Creator of heaven and earth, and that our worship is pleasing to him!|`|WF085j2Daa	cant wait to see the look on the xtians faces when they see the invisible pink unicorn Bless his holy appendage|`|NmIYrL1Paa	because we have our own beliefs and opinions.

Therefore people have different ideas of who & what God is & express their beliefs about the same God in many different ways.  A friend of mine says that there are as many ways to believe in & worship God as there are people.  Each person's view, belief, & worship is personal.  No one can say who is right or who is wrong, who God is & who he is not.  Perhaps each person or denomination or religion is only a tiny fragment of who God is & perhaps all of us are right to some degree.  Since no one can possibly comprehend to the fullest extent, no one can actually say who is right & who is wrong.  Perhaps we are all right.    Follow your own beliefs about who the God of your understanding is.  You probably aren't wrong.  The only thing you, or anyone, could be wrong about is that you believe there is no God.  I can't prove there is a God but I know from personal experience that God is really real.  I suggest that you start from where you are now in your belief & learn & grow from there.  It gets to be very interesting.|`|UmdKqP5kaa	Ok, we know we don't create each other and we don't come to this world from nowhere because when we die we must be going somewhere as well, hence there must be God, if there were many Gods, they would have fought over what to be created and what not to be, probably over who to die and who to live at the same time... so it's gotta be one God... if that God created us then there must be a reason... could we figure it out on our own? God made it easy and sent us messengers and prophets to show us the way and tell us why... so all the messengers and all the religions are from the same only God, so they've got to be complementary to each other, not opposing each other!!! then God must have said His final words in the last message, what is the last message? and how do we know it's the last one? I guess that would be the religion that believes in all messengers and all books equally... is there such religion? actually yes, Islam does :)  A True Muslim (man or woman) gets his reward for obeying Allah's orders (Allah means The God in Arabic) by going to heaven, where he/she are indulged forever in all the good thing s that were on earth and more, things no one ever dreamt of or heard about. The Holy Quran tells Muslims (men and women) there will be good food, good wine and sex in heaven for all, but not in the bestial way you may think of, but rather in a way that is satisfactory for everyone and better than what was on earth. Heaven is no heartbreak or injustice land.  True Muslims are no terrorists, and Islam never calls for that, Islam means peace, it bans violence unless you were fought so you fight back, it only doesn't require Muslims to be cowards, and true Muslims understands this very well and never attack civilians.   Islam is the only religion that accepts freedom of religion and asks men to treat women gently like queens.  Muslims don't deny Jesus, they believe in him, love him and respect him so much.  We believe Jesus is NOT dead till today; he wasnt murdered or crucified as most people think. God made the man who betrayed Jesus be killed instead by switching their looks for a moment. Jesus was left up to live in heaven until the end of days when he will come back to earth, make justice prevail instead of oppression, fight the imposter and perform his last prayer before he really dies like other Prophets. So we're waiting for you Jesus, Messenger of God, to bring the world peace and pray with us. Thats what prophet Muhammad told us and this is what I believe in, Im a Muslim  so how do we know it's true? what is said in the last message and what should we do? read the following, and you'll figure out for yourself:|`|CjRfJbncaa	Although there is only one Almighty God of Truth, here are many man-made gods, and, the world is currently under the rulership of God's chief adversary.

Same essential 'God', though what they call him and their doctrines on him differ by who they each consider to be sent by him.  Messiah, Messiah to be, or Mohammed.     Hinduism/Buddhism also have a similar root, founded in general eastern mysticism and certain key characters...but follows a worldview that's pretty impossible to understand by a western thinker.

Bully hits little girl, little girl runs to tell teacher,bully runs faster and fakes tears and tells the teacher how terrible the little girl was and that she hit him. Remember that game?    That's why there are so many false religions.    Think about it. Suppose there really is a God and really, satan. If you were satan, and felt robbed of your rights and inheritance, what would you do to mess things up for the other siblings?  If God commanded His children, to follow His words and to do certain things, wouldn't it make sense that satan would work hard to fake out the children-causing them to believe a lie? That way, they'd all be in trouble and satan wouldn't be alone.    How to chose the right one? Well, you have common sense. Right? Would you stay with a mate who made you feel guilty at every turn? Or would you stay with a mate who let you go hungry or cold, while they took all your money?  Or would you prefer a mate who made you feel whole and worthy? A mate who made you want to just love the whole world and everyone in it?    What do you feel, when you examine all these religions? One tells you there's no way you have a chance, another tells you to hate people, another tells you that some man can forgive all your sins, and yet another tells you that you have a Savior who died for you because He loves you.    How about going with your heart?

(Luke 11:3) Do not let todays wants become tomorrows needs. Remember that your life does not result from what you possess.Luke 12:16-21.    Live within your means. Our wants are not necessarily the same as our needs. Priority should be given to our needs. We can easily convince ourselves that we need something, when in reality it is a want and not a need. The wise person will first allot earned income to immediate needsfood, clothing, shelter, and so on. Then, before spending on anything extra, he will determine if his remaining funds can cover additional items. In one of his illustrations, Jesus recommended that a person first sit down and calculate the expense, to see if he has enough.Luke 14:28.    Our wants may far exceed our needs, and may cause many to be overreached or to become overanxious about their wants. Caution against this is expressed by Jesus in these words: So never be anxious and say: What are we to eat? or, What are we to drink? or, What are we to put on?

In order for a mammal to be Kosher, it has to have cloven hooves and chew its own cud. Pigs don't fit this description.    Muslims interpret G-d's will similarly and did not abandon that commandment as Christians did. Muslims, like Jews, also circumcise their sons as a rule while Christians either don't or do it simply for medical reasons.

Isaiah 65:4 Which remain among the graves, and lodge in the monuments, which eat swine's flesh, and broth of abominable things is in their vessels;    Isaiah 66:17 They that sanctify themselves, and purify themselves in the gardens behind one tree in the midst, eating swine's flesh, and the abomination, and the mouse, shall be consumed together, saith the LORD.    http://www.bibleuniverse.com/|`|AA12270622	Wow, look at the people saying "The Qur'an forbids it!" and quoting The Bible instead.  Guys, that's like quoting Canadian law to insist something's a crime in France.  Close, but no baguette.    Pork is specifically forbidden in the Qur'an in Sura 6: 145.    "Say, "I do not find in the revelations given to me any food that is prohibited for any eater except: (1) carrion, (2) running blood, (3) the meat of pigs, for it is contaminated, and (4) the meat of animals blasphemously dedicated to other than GOD." If one is forced (to eat these), without being deliberate or malicious, then your Lord is Forgiver, Most Merciful."    As you can see from the verse, it is forbidden because the meat is "contaminated".  The presumption is that pork was forbidden because swine are very prone to bacterial and parasitic infections that can be lethal to a person if they ingest improperly cooked pork (the most commonly known of which is trichinosis).    Since that was't really possible when the Qur'an was written (the ability to consistently cook food has only really come in the last 100-150 years or so), it would have made sense to forbid consumption of the meat as a health risk.  That isn't as much of an issue today since we can properly cook food, but it's still one of the first foods we warn people not to eat unless they're sure it is properly cooked, and for good reason.    There are people who end up with fatal parasitic infections every year because they either didn't bother to take the right precautions in cooking the food all the way, or didn't  have the ability to do so, and ate contaminated pork anyway.  Don't take me to be panic mongering.  I adore pork chops.    That's why Muslims don't eat pork, though.|`|7d49ddbf3b36edeb5a77c20235621a44aa	they are considered wild animals and not of the eating type . but they didn't have barbeque.|`|itroxygvaa	Because we submit to God and follow His commandments.

God made it easy and sent us messengers and prophets to show us the way and tell us why... so all the messengers and all the religions are from the same only God, so they've got to be complementary to each other, not opposing each other!!! then God must have said His final words in the last message, what is the last message? and how do we know it's the last one? I guess that would be the religion that believes in all messengers and all books equally... is there such religion? actually yes, Islam does :)  A True Muslim (man or woman) gets his reward for obeying Allah's orders (Allah means The God in Arabic) by going to heaven, where he/she are indulged forever in all the good thing s that were on earth and more, things no one ever dreamt of or heard about. The Holy Quran tells Muslims (men and women) there will be good food, good wine and sex in heaven for all, but not in the bestial way you may think of, but rather in a way that is satisfactory for everyone and better than what was on earth. Heaven is no heartbreak or injustice land.  True Muslims are no terrorists, and Islam never calls for that, Islam means peace, it bans violence unless you were fought so you fight back, it only doesn't require Muslims to be cowards, and true Muslims understands this very well and never attack civilians.   Islam is the only religion that accepts freedom of religion and asks men to treat women gently like queens.  Muslims don't deny Jesus, they believe in him, love him and respect him so much.  We believe Jesus is NOT dead till today; he wasnt murdered or crucified as most people think. God made the man who betrayed Jesus be killed instead by switching their looks for a moment. Jesus was left up to live in heaven until the end of days when he will come back to earth, make justice prevail instead of oppression, fight the imposter and perform his last prayer before he really dies like other Prophets. So we're waiting for you Jesus, Messenger of God, to bring the world peace and pray with us. Thats what prophet Muhammad told us and this is what I believe in, Im a Muslim  so how do we know it's true? what is said in the last message and what should we do? read the following, and you'll figure out for yourself:  rasoulallah(dot)net--  islam-guide(dot)com--  islamreligion(dot)com-- and whyislam(dot)org/Prophethood/ProphetJesu...|`|yev2iWgWaa	very nice you had spent so much energy to get all good things why don't you  find latest stem cell successes also please?   please no offence|`|bwiCLBnmaa	Everyone AND Muslims?

6jAVElX7aa	you will still be Jewish, not a gentile. As your parents are Jewish, but you will have a love for Israel, and its people. Moses believed in Christ as God said He would raise up a prophet like him,  And Aaron used to the High priest who entered into the Holies of Holy. Now it Christ sitting at the right hand of God making intercession for us, or our High Priest.  The New covenant God is talking about is when we believe in Christ as Lord and Saviour, God sends His holy Spirit within our hearts and writes His commandment on our hearts and minds.  So if they disagree with you that Christ is not the Messiah, show them the proof with the passage of Isaiah 53 You will astound them.|`|a43c635a9767f924cfd929c6c43f2501aa	Jesus|`|d8zxbKduaa	Jesus Christ of course.

Don't forget that originally the Tanakh was written without breaks into Chapters and verses.  As such you need to read the prophecy as a whole to understand it.  Isaiaih 53 is in the middle of a prophecy which is in both the chapters before and after.  In Isaiah 52 it is obvious that the switch from the multiple to singular usage is a metaphor- and just as obvious in Isaiah 54 when it switches back to the multiple usage that the metaphor is complete.  By taking Isaiah 53 out of context and isolating it from the previous chapters Christians are deliberately distorting the message to try and justify there beliefs.    As for Yirmiyahu, that is referring to the fact that in the Messianic times all Jews will automatically know, and follow, the Torah.  G-d is not fickle or false, he does not change his mind- therefore when he states that the Torah is an eternal covenant it is just that ETERNAL!    as for the Kohen Gadol on Yom Kippur- that was only for communal sins- individual atonement can only come from an individuals acts - there is no concept of vicarious atonement in Judaism, no justification for it anywhere- ont he contrary it states that a son will NOT be punished for the sins of the father!    And Moses says no such thing in Leviticus 17:11  11 For the life of the flesh is in the blood; and I have given it to you upon the altar to make atonement for your souls; for it is the blood that maketh atonement by reason of the life.     Yep- atone mment can be through blood- but nowhere does it state that it is the only method of atonement!  On the contrary, we see in othe rplaces that if a person cannot afford an animal for a Korban Chatas (sin sacrifice for accidental transgressions), he brings am orlah offering- in other words a mix of flour and oil- no blood there!  Even more, for deliberate transgressions NO SACRIFICE WAS BROUGHT!  Atonement for deliberate transgressions was through repentance alone!    As for the status of Messianic Jews in Judaism, feel free to read the following posts on my blog:    http://marcl1969.wordpress.com/2009/01/2...    http://marcl1969.wordpress.com/2009/01/2...    http://marcl1969.wordpress.com/2008/06/2...    Oh, and your translation of the last verse of Isaiah is completely off- nothing about lambs in it!  Heres the Hebrew:    ????? ????????-??? ?????????, ?????-????????? ???????? ??????, ?????? ?????? ??????? ???????? ????????, ?????-?????????? ???????; ?????? ?????-??????? ??????, ?????????????? ??????????.     See the Hebrew word for lamb there anywhere?  You won't find it, because its NOT there!      A far better translation is:  12 Therefore will I divide him a portion among the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the mighty; because he bared his soul unto death, and was numbered with the transgressors; yet he bore the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors. (from http://www.mechon-mamre.org/e/et/et1053....    Or you can go to http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cd...    12. Therefore, I will allot him a portion in public, and with the strong he shall share plunder, because he poured out his soul to death, and with transgressors he was counted; and he bore the sin of many, and interceded for the transgressors.|`|45Mmu3SFaa	The coming of Jesus Christ...|`|HlFzl1piaa	I refuse to give you the answer you already know. why do you want hear it from some-one else, if you clearly have done research and to me it sounds very obvious that you already know.|`|UE2fFzq7aa	You have the answer already.

Moses is truth,blood is atonement for sins,but u have to continue to sacrifice if u sin,its not just a one time thing as in jc's case,and we have also have a day of atonement once a year,im sure u know,....The 'new covenant' is where all will know Yah and His laws,He will put the law in our minds and hearts,He will be our god,us His people,no longer will we [israelites,his'son'] have to teach folks'know Yah' all will know,He will forgive and remember our sins no more,thats the new covenant,in jeremiah 31:30-to the end..Isaiah 53 is speaking of a servant Yah chose and the only son and servant i know is those who are obediently,living and serving and spreading the word of Yah..Shalom|`|lh8Tn02Naa	Well clearly the answer is NOT Jesus Christ.  A Jew asks the question and you reply like this?  How offensive can you get!  I don't expect any better from the fundies who lurk around R&S but really, do some proper study.  This particular passage was not even SEEN as a prophecy of the crucifixion until somewhat later than the New Testament period.  The Gospel writers were much keener on Psalm 22, which influences a number of details in the way the Passion story is told.  It's interesting that if you read Isaiah 53 in a proper translation, some of the details don't fit Jesus' death anyway; in the KJV they are tweaked so that this isn't obvious.  One out of many reasons why you should not rely on the KJV!    2nd Isaiah records a remarkable vision, one of several that deal with a mysterious "servant" who appears in some contexts to be Israel itself, in others a kind of representative and redemptive figure drawn out of Israel.  The context is exile, with a writer trying to make some kind of sense of the suffering of his people which, surely is out of all proportion to their sins; so the "servant" - and with him the community from which he is drawn - is seen as suffering for the sins of others, as well as those of Israel.  It is one of the great moments in the OT when the Jews are seen as having a ministry to "the nations", as well as their own special covenant with God.      Searching as your question is, I think its thrust is mistaken.  The writer doesn't have a particular figure in mind, but he is talking about Israel's mission to the world, through the icon of his "servant".  This is however one of the most deeply discussed passages in the whole of the OT, and if you are interested in taking it further I would to some research at a good academic library.

uzczwVT1aa	Salam. I'm with Janvier here, I don't know what tiles you're talking about but we do have those prayer rugs that we use to pray on, which has to be clean. And yes, Qur'ans do come in all sizes really, but not so tiny that we can hang from our necks on a gold chain. Well, I've never seen Muslims do that. You may find very small Qur'ans with a couple of chapters that you can put in your pocket... Many Muslims do that, but don't really hang it from their necks. And as for those tiles... I don't really know about that, we pray on rugs and clean mats. Sometimes, people put little cloths on the ground so that when we're bowing down (prostrating) our foreheads would be touching the cloth instead of the ground, to stay clean during prayers. Maybe you mean that here someone was using tiles? Then its something else used instead of cloths. Some people even use napkins lol. As long as we're clean then, it doesn't matter what you use. I'm not sure about other tiles used for praying, thats all I know really. Janvier's answer was good too. Ignore Lizzy lol. Salam Alaikom and good luck with your research :)    Edit: Well, Saudi Arabians speak arabic, and Pakistanis speaks Urdu. 'The director' in arabic is 'Al Mukhrij' or 'Al Mudeer'... I don't know how to say it in Urdu though, sorry, but its probably something similar to ours maybe, cause I know they have many words similar to ours though I don't know much about them, sorry. There is no Muslim language, by the way. Maybe you think that because Islam happens to be something 'Arab' that all Muslims usually talk Arabic. Its true that this religion was originated here in Arabia, but it doesn't mean that all Muslims now speak this language.     And just so you know, those prayer hats don't really have a name or anything, they're just called hats, and men wear them all the time not just during prayer. Still, if you want to know, the word 'hat' in arabic is 'kaboos' or 'quba'a'. These hats differ in every Islamic society. You don't have to wear this during prayers, but men prefer to, and they'd just keep it on after prayers all day long, or they'd just put it on when they go out. Like Jews wear that little hat too on their heads.     Anyway I hope I helped. Take care and Salam alaikom :)    Edit: Thank you for your kind words, and know that I also respect your beliefs. Best of luck with your book, it sure sounds interesting. Salam alaikom :)|`|PcNzgisHaa	ONION RINGS:    Onion rings are a type of fast food commonly found in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, Malaysia and other places. It generally consists of a small ring of onion dipped in batter or bread crumbs and then deep fried. The result varies from restaurant to restaurant. The ring-like structure of an onion lends itself well to this mode of preparation.    The exact origin of the onion ring is unknown, but in 1933 a recipe for deep-fried onion rings that are dipped in milk then dredged in flour appeared in a Crisco advertisement in The New York Times Magazine.[1]    [edit] Variants    * Tobacco ring - very thin, crisp onion rings named for their color  * Blooming onion - a whole onion that is cut into a flower shape that fans out  * Onion loaf - a rectangular structure of onion rings fried together  * Texas Toothpicks - strips of onions and strips of jalape?os battered and fried. Served in a basket together with ranch dressing.    [edit] References    1. ^ "Crisco Advertisement", The New York Times Magazine: SM18, November 5, 1933, http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.h...

4Ud7ao9Iaa	Yes there have been people who claimed to be Christians, and who were terrorists. In Ireland, the IRA certainly claimed to be Christians, and they conducted a horrible campaign of terror by randomly planting bombs to kill civilians. There would have been many others. Many within the ANC in South Africa regarded themselves as Christians, all while they were killing hundreds of innocent people in car bombs, believing their cause justified it. The Basque terrorist organisation (ITA I think) is likely also comprised of (officially) Christians. In Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe (who is nominally Catholic) is estimated to have in excess of 500,000 deaths on his hands. His faith also did not stop him from deserting his ailing first wife, which is also against what Christianity teaches.    To your second question. Yes, it does go against the true teachings of Christianity. Jesus taught that if someone hits you on one cheek, you should turn the other. Jesus reprimanded Peter for defending Jesus with a sword. Jesus said if someone forces you to do carry his goods, you should carry it double the distance. Jesus encouraged obedience to the Roman authorities that governed his country, even though it was somewhat injust.

His crime was based on what he felt was a political injustice and an attack on American people by her government. He never made any public statement that he was a Christian. Just because he was a white American with far right views does not make him a Christian. Please stop stereotyping.    Universal Pants, Timothy McVeigh was baptized in 1968, the same year he was born. As an adult he claimed to be agnostic, sometimes believing there may be a deity and sometimes claiming to believe in science rather than a God.  There is tons of information on Timothy McVeigh on the internet and books and I have personally studied him extensively. There were plenty of people who wanted to turn him into a Hitler like figure, a Christian gone mad figure but everything the man himself said as well as interviews with his friends has proven that he was very far from a Christian. He was given his last rites by the Catholic church only after being offered them, but at the time of his crime he had no ties to church (other than as a child, which everyone knows just because your parents force you to sit in a church does not make you that particular religion.)|`|74b388eca668facf7bdd1f57af916ab9aa	Absolutely:    The Crusades  The Inquisition  The Witch Hunters of Massachusetts  The Ku Klux Klan  The Army of God (abortion clinic bombers)  The Church of Jesus Christ-Christian (the Aryan Nations)  The Christian Patriots (including Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols)  Just look at the mess of Ireland from the Cromwellian conquest to only a few years ago|`|d83d9da8709343b3aaed98bd340e3ba5aa	Number one Christian Terrorist BUSH.

AA12139712	One of the surprising aspect is that none of the muslims have questioned the source nor asked you to provide one as they do for questions that are not to their liking.  They take it for granted the lie that is being spread across the world for conversion.    I do not for one minute believe that it is the fastest growing religion.  No educated or a logical mind will accept Islam and its violent teachings.  No educated and reasonable person will believe Mohammed to be a prophet with the kind of life he led.|`|Jvsc2lQkaa	Islam claims to be the fastest growing religion in the world.  Similar claims are being made by the Mormons (Aka LDS), and the Baha'i (an offshoot cult of the cult of islam, as if that makes any sense).    Islams claims are founded on the numbers of people who convert to islam, and the birth rate of the muslims vs. the non-muslims.    What the claims disregard is the fact that most muslim converts in the west usually leave islam within 2 years of converting.  But once a muslim, always a muslim in their eyes.    The birthrate issue is a testament to the second-class citizenship of females in the muslim world.  It's conclusively proven that equal rights for women and higher educational opportunities for women are the only sociological factors that are consistently tied to a lower birth rate.  The more educated a population of women are, the less children they will have, and they will do so at a later age.    Another issue that the islamic counters are disregarding is the unspoken scandal of apostasy in non-arab countries.  *** many as 6 million muslims a year convert to christianity in Africa, as well in other countries, as stated above.    Islam is doomed to the ash heap of history if it doesn't reform.  Unfortunately for it, its very structure will collapse if reform is attempted.  The closest Islamic sect to the belief and practice of Muhammad himself is Wahhabiism, which demonstrates that reform can only lead away from islam.|`|A5HPUGxraa	religions are all good but what is the best needs some research  i'm a muslim myself so i'll try to tell you what made me 100% believe in islam    first of all muslims believe (as god told us) that all religions came from the same god ( it is a condition in islam to believe in all religions and prophets to have real faith) and he is god not a human has no son no father no wife simply not a human after all humans didn't succeed to invent a perfect computer yet or to create a single insect!   he is the god from whom our souls came from the invisible powerful thing which makes us stand even if we have broken legs! and he is only one god i believe if there are others they would fight for power and everything!    i believe we are not in a competition it is just people who made that but god sent religions gradually to tell people the truth about their god their mission in life and how to be good humans on this earth first of all prophets told people that they have only one god then religions became sophisticated and ended up with islam you will say it when you search it is a complete way of life     Islam Way of Life  http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Islam_Way_o...

We can see that most of these reasons can only be attributed to the process of critical thinking and intellectual reflection.    Eloquence of Qurans language  The uniqueness and beauty of Qurans text has been marveled by the best of Arab linguists and scholars from the days it was revealed until today. The more knowledgeable people are in the language, the more they appreciate the wonders of the textual fluency of the Quran.   Overwhelming scientific evidence and proofs  The Quran, revealed more than 1400 years ago has numerous scientific facts that are being validated by science only in this era.   Divine wisdom behind various social issues  The Quran provides a solution to numerous social issues, a deviation from which has known to cause societal chaos at all levels.   Arguments rooted in intellectual reasoning  Quran is the only known religious text that challenges mankind to think, reflect and ponder over the creation at large, social issues, Gods existence, and more. Quran in many instances challenges people to reflect and think on their own rather than heeding to the lose talk of those whose criticism is based on baseless foundations.   A confident assertion of a supreme being  Quran is the only known religious book that has a confident assertion of a supreme being on all issues ranging from the creation of the universe to social issues.   Divine Text  Qurans language and prose is very different from the language in the hadith (Porphets sayings) thus proving that Quran is not the imagination or words of Prophet Muhammad, as many doubters have alleged in the past and do so even today.   http://www.iqrasense.com/uncategorized/w...     try to watch convert stories video on youtube it really will give you an idea and will help     you may also check those links  The True Religion (part 1 of 8): Which is the True Religion of God?  http://www.islamreligion.com/articles/44...  http://www.beautifulislam.net/tellmemore...    the truth is out there you just need to search and dig for it     and about the pork you can check those links  http://islamic-world.net/sister/h1.htm  http://www.helium.com/items/1113167-why-...    wish you the best luck.. please feel free to contact me whenever you need to i'll be more than glad|`|N8QLKpCMaa	yes, its growing fastest because of media , they try to mis guide people that its a murderer religion people surprise what religion is that which allows killing and blood shed , when they come to see religion they understand propaganda .     you mind 1 thing in this time peroid if one buys pair of sleeper than also thinks that how far it would be comfortable ,          so   why they will opt a religion which is of no use, success n peace.   ofcorse when people want to convert to islam they ask numerous question, they make wider studies n experimentations , then if they go to other religion......  you got my point ?  people dont research n study longer for other religions as they do for islam while taking intrest/ converting !    now a days people are sensible :  they know what is marketting n what is product ??????????????  they justify they want real true n justified product , not advertisment  n marketting,,,,,,,,,,,,|`|CPvv9vWxaa	islam is NOT the fastest growing religion on the planet.     muslims are emigrating in droves to non-muslim lands, chiefly the West, they set up communities, they have many children, they build mosques and actively proseletyse among the native non-muslim communities in those countries..and they get many converts from ignorant naive white and non-white liberals who feel that islam has not been given a just portrayal by the so-called 'biased' western media. and so these converts want to feel good about themselves by identifying with the underdog, and giving Islam the benefit of the doubt.     however, hve you read reports of the plight of ex-muslims who either convert to christianity or have renounced their old religion to become athiests? they are under severe restrictions, and face systemic persecution by the authorities of those Islamic countries. name me one Islamic / or muslim majority country where an ex-muslim is allowed to openly denounce Islam?

In countries such as Russia, for example, 2 million Muslims converted to Orthodox Christianity in 2005.      In fact, according to Ahmad Al Qataani, 6 million Muslims convert yearly to some form of Christianity.    However, this does not mean anything, it does not mean that Islam is the "only true religion" nor does it mean that Christianity is the "only true religion".  It simply means that more people at this point in history do not want to be Muslims than want to be Muslims.   The first dominant, multinational religion was Hinduism, does this fact make it valid?  For a while, most of Europe believed in Odin and Loki, then in Zeus and Hades, then in Jupiter and Pluto, then in God and the Devil.  Numbers of believers clearly mean nothing to describe the validity of the religions.

They do not have the numbers that islam has but their percentage of increase is something like 300% since 1970.    Pork consumption has not gone up. Once upon a time, pork was Americas favorite meat. From Colonial times until the 1950s, pork was the mainstay of the American diet, outselling both beef and chicken decade after decade. From the 1950s through the 70s, pork consumption decreased steadily and the diet craze that began in the 1980s sent the industry into a tailspin. As chicken became Americas favorite meat, pork producers responded by promoting pork as the other white meat and switched from raising tender, tasty farmstead hogs to producing pork with as much as 30% less fat. The reduction in fat cut a few calories, but it robbed the pork of intramuscular marbling ~ where the flavor and juiciness reside. The end result was pork that was tasteless and dry. Not the best incentive to buy a package of pork chops or a pork roast for Sunday dinner.    hope this helps!
AA12139712	Generally, people are intolerant towards each other.  And your question does not hold true for Christianity.  Christians are taught to love even their enemies.

In order to have control over the followers, it is necessary to turn them against the non-followers, and to do so you must obviously stir up hatred against the non followers.     It's like an us vs them mentality and as long as there is that mentality the "prophet" knows that the followers will remain loyal. It wouldn't work for him if everybody was friends with each other.     That's my 2 cents.|`|mwdwDOaWaa	Salim, you should watch Kingdom of heaven (extended edition) and Slumdog millionaire.     Don't be pissed at religion just because your girlfriend left you for a non/ex moslem.     By the by, give the exact translation of the whole ayah not just a quote. translate the whole thing from 2:95-97. then restate your question.    the exact ayah:  [2:96] In fact, you will find them the most covetous of life; even more so than the idol worshipers. The one of them wishes to live a thousand years. But this will not spare him any retribution, no matter how long he lives. GOD is seer of everything they do.     Here God, says that simply, if one worship idols, and live 1000 years there is no retribution because one have committed shirk the greatest sin. I am amazed how you just twisted the statement. Thats all.    --------------------------------------...  --------------------------------------...  here is the whole thing now analyse it all.        [2:92] Moses went to you with profound miracles, yet you worshipped the calf in his absence, and you turned wicked.     [2:93] We made a covenant with you, as we raised Mount Sinai above you, saying, "You shall uphold the commandments we have given you, strongly, and listen." They said, "We hear, but we disobey." Their hearts became filled with adoration for the calf, due to their disbelief. Say, "Miserable indeed is what your faith dictates upon you, if you do have any faith."     ______________________________________...   47                                                                                                           1805     [2:94] Say, "If the abode of the Hereafter is reserved for you at GOD, to the exclusion of all other people, then you should long for death, if you are truthful."     [2:95] They never long for it, because of what their hands have sent forth. GOD is fully aware of the wicked.     [2:96] In fact, you will find them the most covetous of life; even more so than the idol worshipers. The one of them wishes to live a thousand years. But this will not spare him any retribution, no matter how long he lives. GOD is seer of everything they do.     Gabriel Mediates the Revelation   [2:97] Say, "Anyone who opposes Gabriel should know that he has brought down this (Quran) into your heart, in accordance with GOD's will, confirming previous scriptures, and providing guidance and good news for the believers."     [2:98] Anyone who opposes GOD, and His angels, and His messengers, and Gabriel and Michael, should know that GOD opposes the disbelievers.     [2:99] We have sent down to you such clear revelations, and only the wicked will reject them.     [2:100] Is it not a fact that when they make a covenant and pledge to keep it, some of them always disregard it? In fact, most of them do not believe.     Disregarding God's Scripture   [2:101] Now that a messenger from GOD has come to them, and even though he proves and confirms their own scripture, some followers of the scripture (Jews, Christians, and Muslims) disregard GOD's scripture behind their backs, as if they never had any scripture.|`|nddmwDAmaa	THE QUOTE YOU WROTE FROM THE HOLY BOOK OF QURAN IS WRONG.

6100f239c1abd562ada33e5323d1c871aa	By picking and choosing ayhat rather than correctly reading entire surat, you have deliberately misinterpreted the Holy Qur'an, its revelations and its meanings.    All correctly guided Muslims know that one must read the entire surah in question so as to be able to glean its meaning.    One can easily do what you have done and thereby twist the meaning of any scripture.  Look at what Jews and Christians have done with theirs by such a practice.    When one reads "hate" into the Holy Qur'an, he or she is more probably displaying his or her own personality and bent regarding life.  those full of hate see hate and understand all life in such a manner while those who live love and peace see the truth.    You have obviously made your choice and will be held accountable for the same on the Day of Judgment, insha'Allah.    By the way, you might well read the Torah and the New Testament, where you may well see a "god" portrayed a vengeful, jealous and murderous who condemns entire peoples to death for the sake of one group or at lest, such is how it is often understood.

Slaves are not kept in line by encouragement or love, but by threats and promises to withhold priveleges.    Muhammad was an abused orphan child, and the frustration and hatred towards his abusers came out when he started a condemnatory rant.  Fire plays a prominent role in his punishment fantasies, which may be diagnostic concerning his pathology.    For those who point to the Bible and say you find the same things there, the point is that these things were in the Bible for a reason, and were appropriate for the time and audience of the day that they were recorded.  The relationship of the Christian God to mankind is that of a parent to a child.  The punishment and discipline clauses that critics gleefully cite are compensated by passages of encouragement and love.  Christ himself referred to the patronymic familiar "abba" when referring to god, which scandalized the jews of the time, because this is akin to "daddy" or "poppa".  Hardly a title for the Author of the Universe.  So be it.    Allah is a one dimensional caricature of Majesty, and little else.  Show me the passages of Allah's love in the quran. They don't exist.  Where is Allah's demonstration of love towards mankind?  Where is his demonstration of commitment to the covenant of Abraham?  God sacrificed his only son for Man on the very hill on which Abraham was prepared to sacrifice his son Isaac for God.  He did this to demonstrate his love and commitment to his promise to man.  Where is Allah's sacrifice?

Many Christians believe this is a symbolic lake or some have thought it could be a black hole swallowing one.    At Koran 3:24, this could parallel  the Bible where it says in Psalms, that 1000 will fall on your right and a 1000 will fall on your left but you yourself will not be harmed.  So Christians and Jews might be referring to those Scriptures.  However, if a Christian does not follow the Book/Bible and is unrighteous, the Koran points out in the previous verses in the Koran, that these Jews and Christians when before God or a prophet of God, refuse to obey God and might only have partial Scriptures they go by. But they think, they can be unrighteous and will not pay.  Even the Bible says they will pay with the loss of their precious lives..     (Koran 5:6)  Even the Bible expects a Christian or believer to confess all their sins and to be clean before they come forth as an adult to be baptised with water.  Even modern society says you should wash your hands before you prepare food. In Jewish and Christian services they might serve matzo and wine, bitter herbs etc. Prayer will be said over the food. So hopefully you have clean hands. By" touching a woman" it means touching her in a certain place where there are germs.  So get real in your interpretations, please.  Especially, if you are going to point fingers. Anyone who interprets it differently, meaning just to touch a woman, is misinterpreting and is not using reason. The Muslims and the Greeks were the first people to introduce baths and bathing to the world. This helped people avoid disease.  Many Europeans did not take baths!     Actually,  Christians and Muslims and Jews that believe in God are supposed to warn you to obey God for your own good. Some religions or religionists  sometimes go too far, but hopefully you still get the main message which is be good so that the world can live in an orderly manner and remember the God who made them and gives them the energy that keeps them living.

zE2hOt64aa	The legend goes that Karni Mata, a mystic matriarch from the 14th century, was an incarnation of Durga, the goddess of power and victory. At some point during her life, the child of one of her clansmen died. She attempted to bring the child back to life, only to be told by Yama, the god of death, that he had already been reincarnated.    Karni Mata cut a deal with Yama: From that point forward, all of her tribespeople would be reborn as rats until they could be born back into the clan.         In Hinduism, death marks the end of one chapter and the beginning of a new one on the path to a souls eventual oneness with the universe. "This cycle of transmigration is known as samsara and is precisely why Karni Matas rats are treated like royalty.    Unlike the rest of the world, where rats are commonly killed for inhabiting the same space as humans, in this temple the rat residents are treated with sincere devotion. The veneration is so complete that if someone accidentally steps on a rat and kills it, they are expected to buy a gold or silver rat and place it in the temple as atonement.|`|6ZI1hx99aa	I'm not a Hindu but I know Hindus worship not only rats, but also elephant, ant, peacock, cow, snake and a lots of other animals, birds and insects.

It is the act that is sinful. In God's eyes sin is a sin doesn't matter how small or big it is, and we all have fallen short one way or another.     Sin is not acceptable in God's eyes, but we are not called to judge even God doesn't judge until our days are over. We are called to love, which also means accepting people for who they are and where they are in their life.

(Wikipedia)      To 'hell' potatoes, is to store them underground, or in a cool cellar.  To 'hell' a building, is to roof or thatch a cover on it.    The word 'hell' was used instead of 'grave' in the KJV, to replace (the Hebrew) She'ol, & (the Greek) ha'des, which both mean 'grave'.    Regarding what the Bible says, it is those who *practice* sin willfully --after having come to an accurate knowledge of God & his requirements-- who are negatively judged.  Not those who have yet to learn such, or, those who have learned, & fight against their inclinations.  In the future, gayness & its causes will be abolished, whatever they may be.  (I suspect that may be different for different individuals.)  After the resurrection of the dead, everyone will be educated about the true God, his true purposes, & his true requirements.  It is only after this that these will be judged, & on the basis of their choice.  In their re-creation (resurrection), the sinful tendencies will be left out*, so that they will have a sinless fresh start:    He who has died has been acquitted from his sin. --Romans 6:7     Those --after gaining, or, rejecting the chance to learn-- this knowledge  who chose to resist God's will for them, t is these who will be judged worthy of the second death / the lake of fire, but notice what death itself actually is:    ". . .The living are conscious that they will die; but as for the dead, they are conscious of nothing at all . . ." --Ecclesiastes 9:5    ". . . There is no work nor devising nor knowledge nor wisdom in Sheol , the place to which you are going." --Ecclesiastes 9:10      "The soul that is sinning will *itself* die." --Ezekiel 18:4     "You will ... return to the ground, for out of it you were taken.   For dust you are and to dust you will return." --Genesis 3:19      Now notice, that besides rebellious angels & people, adamic death & the common grave of mankind will also be thrown into 'the lake of fire'.  Ask yourself: "How can death & the grave be tortured???'  Obviously, they can't.  Death is the complete cessation of existence, not torture.  Second death is the complete cessation of existence, without any possibility of re-activation / resurrection:    "Death and Hades were hurled into the lake of fire. This means the second death, the lake of fire." --Revelation 20:14      What Has Happened to Hell?

Romans 1:26-27 teaches specifically that homosexuality is a result of denying and disobeying God. When a person continues in sin and disbelief, the Bible tells us that God gives them over to even more wicked and depraved sin in order to show them the futility and hopelessness of life apart from God. 1 Corinthians 6:9 proclaims that homosexual offenders will not inherit the kingdom of God.    God does not create a person with homosexual desires. The Bible tells us that a person becomes a homosexual because of sin (Romans 1:24-27), and ultimately because of their own choice. A person may be born with a greater susceptibility to homosexuality, just as people are born with a tendency to violence and other sins. That does not excuse the person choosing to sin by giving into their sinful desires. If a person is born with a greater susceptibility to anger / rage, does that make it right for then to give into those desires? Of course not! The same is true for homosexuality.    However, the Bible does not describe homosexuality as a greater sin than any other. All sin is offensive to God. Homosexuality is just one of the many things listed in 1 Corinthians 6:9-10 that will keep a person from the kingdom of God. According to the Bible, Gods forgiveness is just as available to a homosexual as it is to an adulterer, idol worshipper, murderer, thief, etc. God also promises the strength for victory over sin, including homosexuality, to all those who will believe in Jesus Christ for their salvation (1 Corinthians 6:11; 2 Corinthians 5:17).|`|AA12048147	Well, as you say, this is a pretty heavy topic, in here especially....

We have those in our family that are gay and I love them dearly... I just do this : I leave it alone !! I do not make the issue a priority in my life...I feel and believe the way I know is right and leave others to do the same... I do speak up when abuse is involved... I do not tolerate abuse of any kind... I have a big mouth that way....I wait on God to answer any question I might have.... Us humans do not have the authority to condemn or change people..... we just do NOT.... why let it separate and tear families up when we can not change it ?? I just can not see it !!!

Having homosexual tendencies, therefore, can be a natural occurrence.   Taking part in homosexual acts, however, is a clear choice made by those who are not raped by homosexuals. They choose to act on their feelings just as heterosexuals choose. That choice can and does have consequences.  If it hurts you that practicing homosexuals will not see the kingdom of heaven, your beef is not with your Christian acquaintances, rather with the family member who is conducting himself outside of the will of God. You assume much when you assume that all Christians are against all abortion in all circumstances. That being said, if I knew I was carrying a child who would be born with homosexual tendencies, I do not think I would abort. I would raise him to know that God can and does give people the power to overcome carnal desires. God bless.|`|zfFjKhJJaa	I'm guessing you'll get a lot of unwanted answers from rude atheists also but it is actually stated NOWHERE in the bible that homosexuals will go to hell    Not to mention, this is an instance of scientific manipulation, and therefore is not a natural occurrence|`|zYAQrnjcaa	To be honest, I believe that different testosterone levels definitely can make a man feel more attracted to other men than they are to women, however ultimately the choice to actually be with a man is a choice... same goes for women.

So, yeah, I'm not arguing that no matter what, homosexuals go to hell; I'm arguing that no matter what, homosexuality is a sin.|`|dZMHd5PMaa	The feelings that I have on articles like this are the same feelings that some people have about the  Bible.

I believe that homosexuality goes against the Bible and as far as the abortion question life is precious no matter what the outcome. Some one who is gay is just as important as someone who is straight. And I will probably be ripped apart for this answer but it is mine as far as the person in your family that is gay yes I believe that is a sin but it is no more a sin than my father being an alcoholic or the fact that I have been divorced. to me sin is sin and they are all equal. Don't stop loving that person or caring about them just b/c they are gay that would be ignorant and against the Bible. It clearly states that we are to love the person and hate the sin.

God makes those decisions, we as humans know it's a sin and therefore we can't condone that behavior regardless of whether or not he's a sex addict. The problem with sin is it hurts you and others, that is why God doesn't want us to commit sin. We are His children and He loves us and doesn't want us to hurt or cause hurt.

I am a christian and I don't believe that homosexuals are going to hell... here is why: though it does CLEARLY state in the bible that a man who lies with another man is put to death... but you have to think about how many times the bible has been revised since that time, people have just added what they want to it... It ALSO clearly states that homosexuality is an abomination... but so is children disobeying their parents, and eating shellfish... if we tried to enforce these abominations today we probably wouldn't get too far. It really leaves doubt and question in my mind... No sin is too big for god.... Ask for guidance..|`|i6Mi8uWIaa	Okay, before I say anything, I just ask that you listen with an open mind and not take offense. After all, I have some friends that are homosexual, so you know I'm not homophobic. I just choose not to take part in homosexual practices.     Now then, that being said, I think that this study proves that homosexuality is not the natural order of things. God created the sheep, but it was the interferance of scientists that caused the sheep to have a preference for members of the same sex. God did not create homosexual sheep. Man did.     Also, I speak a little from experience. Before I was baptized and came to Christ, I was bi-curious. I found myself experiencing a sexual attraction to a few other women, mostly those who, like me, preferred lace-up bodices and corsets to modern bras. (They really are more comfortable, so long as you're not stupid enough to tight-lace, and they really do offer more support, but that's a different subject.) I even tried it a little.     After I was baptized, and came to Christ, and gave myself over to Him completely, I no longer felt those feelings.     The same with my husband. When I first met him, he was gay. And I mean all out gay. However, something about me turned my head. (I admit I do have a few masculine qualities, something usually evidenced on the battlefield on Days of Honor, which is this Klingon thing. Again, another subject.)     My husband then decided he was bisexual. He was pagan. When he returned to the Catholicism of his youth, and gave himself over to Christ, all of those homosexual tendencies left my husband.     Homosexuals themselves are not condemned, just like those with Down Syndrome or Autism (like my brother-in-law) are not condemned.    It is the homosexual activity that is sinful and is frowned upon, not the person who commits the activity.|`|JQ4K1IpSaa	"If it can be proved that homosexuality is caused by abnormalities in the womb, then what does that say about homosexuals going to hell?"   The problem is that we all have some kind of imperfection by the standards of the Bible. To make an exemption for just one of them does not make sense. ALL behavior is voluntary when it is not its called mental illness.|`|hx1SZPcbaa	Homosexuality is a sin.    Any sin is not acceptable to God.    Yet, though we are sinners, Christ died for us, so that we can be eternally with Him someday. People going to heaven does not depend on works. It's a gift from God, anyone can receive Him, even if your a very bad person.    People are sinful that's why they have to be forgiven. This forgiveness that came from God will eventually change you. You will receive the Holy Spirit that will totally change you, maybe not now or not automatically but as you grow deeper in love with God.    God is not unfair, He is inviting everyone to come to Him, yet some men are prideful and choose to stay in the pleasure of sin. They don't want that God is dictating them what is right or wrong. They create their own god and follow their own desires.    Godbless to you.

vEEeq7kYaa	Regarding Exodus 12:43, it has always been my understanding this applied to anyone not a part of the covenant, meaning both gentile and apostate. The apostate is an outsider, and the gentile is an outsider.   This passage isnt one that is IMHO particularly useful to illustrate to the apostate or the gentile that they are not a part of the people for whom the observance of the Passover is intended, unless you take it as a whole with the entire story of the explanation of the plagues and the exodus that precedes it.     It is because the New Testament tells those that follow its doctrine ( that is of course, another religion and incompatible with Torah) that they are grafted into the people of Israel, that they feel entitled to perform their version of Jewish ceremonies.    What their teaching fails to show them is what I just mentioned, the specific reasons for the Passover and why God commands Israel, and only those of Israel to observe it because it is an affirmation that the people REJECTED the notion of false man/gods and embraced the covenant of worship of the one, indivisible incorporeal Creator. If they read the Exodus in context, that is what clearly reveals that it honors the covenant of dedication to exclusive monotheism of the Torah and no other.     If you are of the New Testament or Covenant of faith, this holy observance is not commanded of you to observe as the core meaning is incompatible with the Christian religion. Jews are required by direct commandment in the Torah to keep the Passover observance for an eternal memorial. Passover ( Pesach in Hebrew) is the celebration of the deliverance of the eternal covenant nation Israel, the Hebrews, from the yolk of idolatry, superstition, and physical slavery in Egypt. It was a reaffirmation of their identity as a nation dedicated to God through Torah and our memorial reaffirms this for each generation. . The events we retell at Passover were demonstration to Egypt that their deities were false and their man/god Pharoah impotent to God's power.    It is a very important part of Judaism and many central aspects of our identity as an eternal covenant nation are embedded in it's observance. It has absolutely nothing to do with any form of Christian doctrine. Jesus is completely insignificant to it. Inserting Jesus into the Passover in fact INVALIDATES it as honoring the direct commandment in Torah.  Christians may wish to rethink their claim of Jesus as the Paschal lamb if they read in the Torah what the lamb represents and why the covenant people, Israel is commanded for eternity to remember it.  6:6 'Therefore say to the Israelites [in My name], 'I am God. I will take you away from your forced labor in Egypt and free you from their slavery. I will liberate you with a demonstration of My power, and with great acts of judgment.     The Israelites had been subjugated to hundreds of years enslaved in a culture that dwelled on death, false animal and man gods and superstition. God was going to break both the physical and spiritual bonds of enslavement to the Israelites.    Through each one of the plagues God demonstrated to both the Egyptians and to Israel that the God of Israel was more powerful than the false gods of Egypt.     After one of the plagues Pharaoh said to Moses:  8:21 Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron. 'Go!' he said. '[You have permission to] sacrifice to your God here in [our] land.'     8:22 'That would hardly be suitable,' replied Moses. 'What we will sacrifice to God our Lord is sacred to the Egyptians. Could we sacrifice the sacred animal of the Egyptians before their very eyes and not have them stone us?     This is a direct reference to the LAMB representing their false god to the Egyptians. Israel was still enslaved in fear to do something like that in front of the Egyptians!    8:23 What we must do is make a three day journey into the desert. There we will be able to sacrifice to God our Lord, just as He told us.  8:24 'I will let you leave,' said Pharaoh, 'as long as you do not go too far away. You can sacrifice to God your Lord in the desert. But pray for me!'    8:25 Moses answered, 'When I leave your presence, I will pray to God. Tomorrow, the creatures will go away from Pharaoh, his servants, and his people. But let Pharaoh never again deceive us, refusing to let the people sacrifice to God.'    Well, we know Pharaoh went back on his word again so God then killed much of the Egyptian livestock ( representatives of their false gods by the way) and spared those of the Israelites. Then boils and then hail and they were still not convinced of the power of God over their gods.  But God wasnt done with his demonstration to fully convince the Egyptians and those of Israel who still may have had doubts and fears.    10:2 You will then be able to confide to your children and grandchildren how I made fools of the Egyptians, and how I performed miraculous signs among them. You will then fully realize that I am God.'     Pharaoh was still obstinate so locusts and darkness came..and then finally after Pharoah said Moses would see his face no more came the ultimate show of power and strength that also gave Israel the opportunity to demonstrate to Egypt and to God their loyalty. Finally, their bonds of enslavement of both mind and spirit were now shattered.  11:4 Moses said [to Pharaoh] in God's name, 'Around midnight, I will go out in the midst of Egypt.     11:5 Every first-born in Egypt will die, from the first-born of Pharaoh sitting on his throne, to the first-born of the slave girl behind the millstones.

Eg. some of the rules of leviticus aren't binding when there's no temple. Noone's making animal sacrifices anymore, so using a verse relating to sacrifice wouldn't hold much weight.    You can be a Jewish atheist, which seems to make no sense unless being a Jew is a cultural/ethnic thing. If you can be an atheist-theist (ie. atheist-Jew) they might not see it any less logical to paricipate in it as a cultural activity.    Judaism seems able to change with the times. Reform Jews eat pork and shrimp and remain Jews and don't see a problem with it. Maybe this is an aspect where people say it can change too.|`|AA10020540	Here is what Rashi says:    "No estranged one Whose deeds have become estranged from his Father in heaven. Both a gentile and an Israelite apostate are meant.  [from Mechilta]"    ??? generally refers to a non-Jew.    In the Artscroll commentary, it expands this to anyone who rejects part of the Torah. I suppose this could be expanded by one to anyone who tramples even the smallest mitzvah.    I have found many Jews claim their brand of Judaism is the correct brand and anyone who isn't their brand isn't Jewish. Yet we have examples of kings who rejected Torah and no place does it suggest they aren't Jewish.     In Likutey Mohoran by Rebbe Nachman, I read that a tzaddik is required to judge everyone favorably. It gave a primary reference, but I don't have that.    Given that all reject parts of the Torah I'm going to judge these groups favorably. We no longer have a Temple, so there are no physical Pesach Sacrifices. Therefore it is done by prayer. I would judge that if their intent is such that the sacrifice done by prayer is at a level that it becomes an actual Pesach sacrifice, then it must be Hashem's will that they partake of it and it is allowed. If they are so distant from Hashem that the prayer doesn't equal the sacrifice, then they are not able to partake of it.     In my opinion, it's really not for us to judge the spiritual path of others.    This does not mean that I would go to a messianic Jew's seder. I'm also free to follow my path which doesn't include that.    By the way, it also says in Exodus that we are not to mention the name of false gods. Have you rejected that when you mention the name of the person the christians worship?    "As for using the name of the Christian deity- no one is going to mistake me for praying to him or to applying anything divine to him- it is used purely for identification so that there is no confusion as to what is being referred to. As such my usage does not contravene the Halachah as there is no chance of a chillul Hashem or of anyone mistaking me for Jew worshiping a foreign deity."    This is the exact same argument some use for having statues in their churches. Yet it clearly states in the Torah we will not have objects representing Hashem.    Should we violate the Torah injunction against speaking the name of a false god because nobody would mistake us for worshipping that god? For me, the answer is no.     Clearly, one who does the actions of a Seder without the proper knowledge and intent is not doing a Seder. Therefore we don't have to worry about them participating in the Pesach sacrifice, even in prayer.    When one mentions the name of a false god, one attaches some importance to it. We can't fight what doesn't exist. By mentioning the name, we are implying it exists. In order to fight these people, one must learn their beliefs. I have no interest in that.     As for fighting those who worship other gods, I do that by focusing on Torah study in the morning in a Paltalk room. When people come in who would disrupt with other beliefs, we simply boot them.    If a person has learned Torah, they will not embrace false beliefs anymore than a person who has learned about gravity will jump off a tall building unless their intent is to harm themselves. If we focus purely on learning Torah, we won't jump off any tall buildings as it will seem silly.    In our town in the last 40 years, there has only been one Jew who has become messianic. There have been dozens who left the messianic place and converted to be Jewish. Perhaps Hashem allows them to exist in order to draw christians to Torah in a roundabout way.    I have seen grave injustices done by Jewish anti-missionaries to those who are beginning a path toward Judaism. They are immediately branded as missionaries when actually they are feeling the influence of their Jewish soul. Many of these people find out they have ancestors who were forced to convert.     If you wish to discuss this further, please feel free to email me.    Shalom    Gershon    Added: Everything I've read is that the christians are from the side of Esau who is blessed with proficiency with the sword. In a direct battle, they will win. They use lots of Greek fallacies to overcome us and their numerical advantage allows them to shout us down.    Everytime one fights a messianic, one gives them some credibility that they are somehow Jewish. To the non-Jew, it looks like a squabble between sects of Judaism. To me, it makes as much sense as debating a baptist.    The way we fight Esau is simple. We follow the Torah. Hashem will take care of them if they need to be taken care of. Maybe they will live peacefully in a building down the street and we will never interact as is the case in our town.     Once my Rabbi asked me what he should say if asked if he knows the messianic leader. He was asked by the person if he knew the messianic "rabbi" and his answer was he is not a Rabbi. Of course this ended up in a somewhat heated discussion. I suggested he just say "Yes." If asked what he thinks about this person, I'd suggest he says he doesn't.     This leaves no foothold for a person to attempt to convince him of anything about their group.    Once I was in a coffeeshop waiting for my Rabbi to go over some Kedushat Levi I translated. Two messianics saw me reading Hebrew and asked if they could join me. When they sat down, they wanted to tell me about their stuff. I told them I was preparing for a meeting with my Rabbi and all I would talk do is read Kedushat Levi to them. They stayed for about 5 minutes and then suddenly had to go.     Torah is our defense against these people. I don't care at all about what they believe and I won't discuss it with them at all. If all Jews did the same, their missionary tac|`|i7oHTo9haa	Well we can argue semantics til the sun shines but the simple fact of the matter is  there are lines that cannot be crossed and that they crossed the line and that is the perspective that I throw into this discussion.  Once a faction is "split" from the whole to still be considered part of the whole or a separate entity in itself.  Jewish people drew the line at Jesus therefore they are not part of the whole but cast out.    That is what majority Jewish people believe who use both interpretation of text and the events and experiences of modern history that have not been recorded in text. One can bring up Rashi or any other biblical text and provide Jewish interpretation, but cannot discount what we've learned from  modern history tells us also on how to interpret the text. By doing so it shows limited perspective.  So let's combine text with historical perception.     Biblical scripture supports my view that Ruth accepted the covenant and the community accepted her, so too can people's intentions and the community's opinion determine they are not part of the community.  The majority opinion is that these people are not Jewish therefore they are not.    More history shows thru my Sephardic Inquisition ancestry lived and died to maintain the covenant and anyone trying to alter this history is an enemy to Judaism and an enemy to me.  To willingly disavow the covenant or to die protecting it is the difference.  The Messianics that crossed the line cast themselves out did so willingly and I VEHEMNTLY oppose anything to do with them.  The difference now is that Sephardim are much stronger now and the "Inqusitors" are using another tactic as they cannot kill us then or now and I will defend with all my might just like my own ancestors did back then. Do NOT cross my Sephardita path I cannot make it any plainer than that. Does anyone think that we would accept these people in covenant and disavow what happened in Inquisition?  I think not. These people just need to be viewed for what they really are and the voice of the Sephardim must be heard and counted.    Majoritiy Jewish community says they are not, I say they are not and the voice of the  Sephardic community who's experiences cannot be erased from time says they are not.  If they want to be in covenant without conflicting with Judaism and Sephardim,  they need to examine Noahide.  Only by that will they ever be received by the Jewish community. If they continue to fight then we will just continue to defend. We learned alot from the Inquisition and Holocaust.      Gershon b, I've appreciated your perspective on other matters but find your perspective on this matter limited, practically tunnel vision, spiritually limited and perhaps one's special purpose needs to be found. Please don't tell people not to fight to do so discounts our experiences from both Inquisition and the Holocaust, and heck I'll just throw Masada in there because I'm willing to make last stand, can you say the same?  If the Sephardic voice says they are a threat, then they are a threat.  These people are attempting a spiritual Holocaust.|`|AA10747442	Here are 365 messianic prophesies FULFILLED by the messiah 'Jesus' !!!  http://bibleprobe.com/365messianicprophe...

A few so-called "messianic Jews" flood Yahoo!answers using their multiple accounts with "abuse" reports whenever there is any question that even approaches exposing them for what they really are.    "Messianic Jews" are a bizarre Christian cult who refuse to acknowledge that they are Christians and instead insist they are Jews! Instead of following the tenants of Judaism, they (1) worship Jesus, (2) believe in virgin birth, (3) believe that sins are atoned by human sacrifice, (4) believe in the divinity of Jesus, (5) believe that Jesus was the son of God, (6) read, study, and follow the New Testament, etc., etc., etc--all these things and much more that they do and believe in are Christian and none of these things are Jewish. Therefore, calling themselves Jews as they do is nothing but FRAUDULENT, DECEPTIVE, and DESPICABLE. It is sickening and pathetic how they insert THEIR Christianity into all of OUR holidays and holy days and claim the result is Judaism. What they are doing as far as Judaism is concerned is nothing less than blasphemy.    No Jew on earth accepts them as being any part of our religion in any way. They should be denounced by everyone who stands up for righteousness and honor and truthfulness--not of course because they believe in Jesus--but instead because they make a mockery of Judaism by claiming Judaism is something other than what it is. No Jew worships anyone other than one God, a God who did not have a son sent to earth, born to a virgin, died on the cross, rose again, etc. etc. etc as is believed by Christians. Period. The Christian New Testament is NOT part of our bible. Period.    To get some example of how bizarre they really are consider this: Can one deny Jesus, say he never even existed, and still be a Christian? Of course not, and the same reasoning applies to these so-called "messianic Jews"--one can not believe in Jesus and be Jewish simultaneously. Christians who feel the need to take up what they think is a Jewish lifestyle without letting go of their Christian beliefs really need to come up with another name for themselves rather than misappropriate ours. They, including their fraudulent "messianic rabbis" are living a lie by calling themselves Jews. All sane, rational people, no matter what their religion happens to be, know these people are NOT Jews (except to the "messianic Jews" themselves).|`|H7L66ynJaa	I presume that if you have converted from Judaism to any other faith it does not matter to you as you no longer believe.

My view is that evolution has been working exactly as described by Darwin, ever since God created living things complete with DNA in the first place. In order to allow free will God had to allow imperfection in his creation, which innovation made possible the Fall, and Evolution to begin. Science seeks to prove God does not exist by analysing the continuing evolution of his created ecosystems. Proving that living things evolve does not disprove creation.

God made it easy and sent us messengers and prophets to show us the way and tell us why... so all the messengers and all the religions are from the same only God, so they've got to be complementary to each other, not opposing each other!!! then God must have said His final words in the last message, what is the last message? and how do we know it's the last one? I guess that would be the religion that believes in all messengers and all books equally... is there such religion? actually yes, Islam does :)  A True Muslim (man or woman) gets his reward for obeying Allah's orders (Allah means The God in Arabic) by going to heaven, where he/she are indulged forever in all the good thing s that were on earth and more, things no one ever dreamt of or heard about. The Holy Quran tells Muslims (men and women) there will be good food, good wine and sex in heaven for all, but not in the bestial way you may think of, but rather in a way that is satisfactory for everyone and better than what was on earth. Heaven is no heartbreak or injustice land.  True Muslims are no terrorists, and Islam never calls for that, Islam means peace, it bans violence unless you were fought so you fight back, it only doesn't require Muslims to be cowards, and true Muslims understands this very well and never attack civilians.   Islam is the only religion that accepts freedom of religion and asks men to treat women gently like queens.  Muslims don't deny Jesus, they believe in him, love him and respect him so much.  We believe Jesus is NOT dead till today; he wasnt murdered or crucified as most people think. God made the man who betrayed Jesus be killed instead by switching their looks for a moment. Jesus was left up to live in heaven until the end of days when he will come back to earth, make justice prevail instead of oppression, fight the imposter and perform his last prayer before he really dies like other Prophets. So we're waiting for you Jesus, Messenger of God, to bring the world peace and pray with us.

I understand why you may want to do this as it is better for both your safety, and comfort, as you can do it in your own home.            The powers of tarot cards are not bound by modern technology, this means that as long as you are in some way in contact with the card reader, they will be able to read your cards.            If you would like to have your cards read without actually having to go and visit a card reader, I suggest visiting the website which I will leave in the source section of this answer.

Let me tell you an incident of my early college days in B.H.U Varanasi (India), though some may feel that it has nothing to do with spirituality.     I fell ill and was in poor health. Some of my hostel mates after lot of arguments were able to influence me to start taking non-vegetarian food. I somehow got carried away.

If the path gets too tough, I guess I would have to work on making my spiritual training techniques better so that I will be able to handle more.  I try to make my spiritual training as tough as possible so as to help me handle anything that I really feel is important that I handle.  I have had pain that was stronger than I thought I could handle at the moment, so I just kept meditating on the pain and telling myself that I will eventually be able to handle the pain if I just keep on trying too.  Often in a crisis one will think things are tougher than one can handle or that one will never get beyond the situation one finds oneself in.  One just has to survive moment to moment and have faith that eventually the storm one is in will pass.      One does have to always be willing to adjust ones beliefs or course of action so as to be more effective at getting where you really need to be.  Sometimes one even needs to adjust ones goals.  But, one should not be into trying to always find the easy way out.  Constantly challenging oneself spiritually is how you get really strong and really sensitive spiritually and able to manage to find a way when the goings are tough.

I think they can marry both a man or a woman, maybe both at the same time :)     What about people who have had a sex change? I think this brings up a good question. What if A man and a Woman get married, but then the Man has a sex change into a woman, does that make their marriage null/void?    What about people who live their life as another gender? It's all about the plumbing.    What about people who want to be animals? I want to be a millionare, that doesn't mean that I am one.       I think this whole law is a bunch of BS. People claim that gay marriage would either destroy marriage as we know it, or that it's against god's will.     Marriage is already a bunch of crap, and even if it wasn't it's not changing the rights of those that can already marry.    Plus, just because it's written in a book (written by man) doesn't make it GOD's Will. If it was God's will then he wouldn't have given us free will to change the laws of man.

Shias do NOT believe Imams are higher in rank to the prophet.  we do NOT believe the Holy Quran is croupted.  we do NOT worship anyone other than Allah SWT.  and....        so......  we said muslims can get married.  what are the criteria to be a muslim?  you need to believe in the oneness of Allah SWT, believe in his messengers, believe in his books, believe in his angels and believe in the day of judgment:    2:285  "The messenger believes in what has been revealed to him from his Lord, and (so do) the believers; they all believe in Allah and His angels and His books and His messengers; We make no difference between any of His messengers; and they say: We hear and obey, our Lord!

If the person you wish to marry is a Shia, he should be told to convert and become a Sunni. Shias cannot be trusted as they practice Taqiyyah, that is, holy hypocricy.

lar1FyQBaa	this is a very good question.    although i am not a muslim woman, i am with a muslim man and it's clear that a muslim woman can only marry a muslim man.  i've asked about this too.  perhaps they bellieve that women maybe swayed to go in her husbands direction.  I'm not sure but I too have questioned this.  If I marry my boyfriend, I know for a fact I shall remain with my own faith and we shall bring our children up how we see fit.  Not necessarily Muslim (because quite frankly even though he's Muslim, he's not firm).  I get the idea that perhaps Islam thinks that women can be swayed too easily by the man, therefore maybe thinking we are a bit weaker in the mind than a man.  I'm not definite, just my thoughts.    I have asked this to my boyfriend and he said it's because the woman can be "perswayed".|`|6SlBdQZ8aa	Mam I'm sorry ..I would say A muslim women is stronger than any women..on earth..they are more stronger than..you can think of..|`|zBqt99avaa	no no, this isn't it.  In Islam, men play a very dominant role in religion.  This was likely true of all religions at the time of Islam's inception.  For example, women in Christianity (my religion) were kept out of religious rituals and practises until modern days.    Since the time of the Prophet (pbuh), men dominated religion and it's practise.  Men must go to the mosque for Friday prayers, women do not (the *can* but they don't *have* to).  Women are exempt from praying during their cycle, since it's a trial to have it (you know it is).  This doesn't mean they can't pray, but they don't have to offer the obligatory prayers (salat).    Anyway, as you can easily see, to a Muslim, if a woman marries someone outside her religion, she won't have as much opportunity to practise.  And since a man is much more likely to practise and be obvious about it (going to the mosque, etc.) her practise will be overshadowed.    In modern times, Chrisitan faith tends to sit in the hands of the women, while men tend to practise less.  So we look at this provision and think:  That's nuts.  Her religion will likely dominate the household.  Moreover Christians of today are pretty unlikely to stop someone from practising their religion.  The same was not true in more ancient times.    Does that mean they should change the rule?  That is only for Muslims to say, and they say no.  I can't say I blame them; it's the thin edge of the wedge.  Once you start making changes, when do you stop?  Look at how many "flavours" of Christianity we have, and you tell me.  :)    WSMA:  You should be more careful with your posts.  Perhaps you didn't mean to put it quite this way but saying:      "If a Muslim woman were to marry a non Muslim...She would get beaten, raped...would have no say in her children's upbringing. Her children and herself would be ridiculed by her husband and her non Muslim in-laws if they practiced Islam."    There is no reason to believe this **would** happen to any Muslim woman who married a non-Muslim man.  I've known Muslimahs who've married Christians and their lives aren't like this.  They even raise their children as Muslims, with the father's consent.    I'm sorry for the abuse you suffered, and that your husband yells at you.  My sweetheart is also born Muslim, and would never intentionally hurt me in anyway, physically or verbally.|`|dPJr1Lbmaa	No I don't. That is not the reason Muslim women don't marry non muslim men. The father is seen as the one to guide children in faith, we want Muslim fathers for our children. Muslim men are only permitted to marry women of the book IF they agree there children will be raised Muslim if they cant then they cannot marry Jewish or Christian women either. A muslim women who married a Jewish man, seriously you think he would let his children be raised Muslim? Not a chance.   It has zero to do with our faith being considered weaker than a mans. Men and women are equal in Islam we have different roles and are different but that does not mean one is held above the other in terms of strength of faith, not at all.  Allah knows why he has revealed these things and we as submitters to the will of Allah trust in his word.  You got a problem with what he reveals take it up with him. We are more, more than happy with our wonderful Muslim husbands...|`|uzczwVT1aa	Salam. You can't judge a person's faith on their gender. And well, when a Muslim woman refuses to marry a man outside her faith, thats because its haram to do so, meaning its forbidden. I don't know why she'd marry a non-Muslim, which is wrong and going against the Islamic beliefs, then start worrying about how strong her faith is lol. Anyway, Muslim women should only marry Muslim men, if she wants to make sure her children will be raised as Muslims. Salam :)|`|0BHiaVZ9aa	the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) highly recommended that both male and female should consider marrying someone who is religious/pious so that we may succeed in life and the hear-after. So all Muslims primary goal should be to marry a pious person.   Marriage in Islam has aspects of both 'Ibadah (worship) of Allah and mu'amalah (transactions between human beings).  In its 'Ibadah aspect, marriage is an act pleasing to Allah because it is in accordance with his commandments that husband and wife love each other and help each other to make efforts to continue the human race and rear and nurse their children to become true servants of Allah.|`|A5HPUGxraa	i believe relationships are about manners not faith or beliefs     concerning the fact that your faith is weak you can do something about it (and for the sake of god do not listen to those who tries to catch greater number to make them unbelievers or to change their religions) there are many things for me i read more Qur'aan this is what gives me strength and to know more miracles in Qur'aan gives me more strength    try to read more about islam it is a great religion     and concerning the man thing i can completely understand you .. sometimes we meet people who claim they have more faith and makes us feel that we have weak faith it is his fault to make you feel so this is his character or personality and has nothing to do with islam     try to search again for your life purpose you will find it just search to add a value to this world    i know watching TV brought us (female muslims) a hell of contradictions but take care do not let these contradictions make you hesitate about your beliefs to be honest the more i know about islam the more i find that everything it told us is for our good     again again try to communicate more with your husband or your man and think is he the right person to live with because if he does have more faith he should try to give you more strength more support more appreciation that would make you stand on the ground and happy with your life and your beliefs and the fact that he made you rethink about them means one thing that he is failing with you it has nothing to do with islam as a religion here it is about your relationship    wish you the best of luck feel free to contact me anytime|`|Izn1ye9Raa	No I don't believe my faith is weaker then a man's.  The Qur'an says "Do not marry your daughters to idolaters until they believe".  Idolaters are basically pagans or people who worship more then one God(aka Christian sects who think Jesus(Peace be upon him) is God and at the same time the "son of" God, and at the same time the "holy spirit").  I am happy that I am not allowed to marry a non Muslim man.    A Muslim woman may not marry a non-Muslim man, because her Muslim status would be affected, the wife ordinarly takes the nationality and status given to her by her husband's law. No mother wants to see her children grow up with a different religion then hers.  If a Muslim woman were to marry a non Muslim, her Islamic rights wouldn't be protected.  She would get beaten, raped, might be forced to serve alcohol or pork to her husband, would have no say in her children's upbringing, might leave her religion for her husband, might be forced to leave her religion, might be forced to work outside the home around non mahram men, etc.  Her children and herself would be ridiculed by her husband and her non Muslim in-laws if they practiced Islam.     I was abused by non Muslim men as a child. My husband is a born Muslim. He has NEVER laid a finger on me in a harmful way to hurt me. He has yelled at me but that's only when I do something that he doesn't like.  I feel safer with my husband, then I do around non-Muslim men.|`|JzyhvENXaa	lots of muslim women are secretly anti islamic , and most run off and find happiness with non muslim or ex muslim men    my girlfriend is one    x muslim|`|AA10248239	Pas du tout--not at all.    In Islam, Christianity, Judaism, and every other religion with which I am familiar, the husband is the head of the household and the leader of the family.  A Muslim, male or female, has religious obligations and prohibitions which differ from those of other faiths.  It would be very difficult for a Muslim woman married to a non-Muslim to observe all the practices of Islam and still meet her responsibilities to her non-Muslim husband and  household.  It also would be difficult for her to raise her children Muslim, and if they did not grow up Muslim, it would break her heart to see them go astray.    It actually would be less of a problem if a woman's faith was, as you suggest, so weak that marriage could destroy it.  We Muslims believe that a woman's  faith is as strong, as valid, and as important as a man's is.|`|60df5ff8f8ccc7873e68c2407a7ca9f6aa	i believe that my faith is stronger than any man but my body is weaker than them ,what if i got married to non muslim man and he tried to convert me out of islam using physical way?|`|88fHI3xDaa	Belle our womens are more strong in religion u know this fact that only one percent child like obama who convert his mother religion 99% child accept their father's religion Allah knows better u don't know islam see persent past and future of a person a socity and the universe  so islam ban woman to marriage others|`|rM9QdK75aa	No not at all. I'm a revert, and at times I get frustrated with my husband because I feel that I'm encouraging him to pray on time more then he encourages me. I don't think that Imaan (faith) has anything to do with what gender a person is.    About the marriage thing, I think it's got more to do with the difficulties the children will encounter having a non-Muslim father. We believe that it is our children's right to be brought up in an Islamic household, we hold that responsibility for our kids. That would be made a lot harder if the father's not Muslim. Plus, the children take the father's name, which would make them appear non-Muslim. It just wouldn't work out well for the children, in regards to the Islamic faith.    peace|`|stRWElvPaa	Well I'm not a muslim woman, but I think that due to their "prophet" being a man who was around 1500 years ago in ancient S.A, the women there were to do whatever their husbands told them to, and were to stay at home, were to be completely dependent on their husbands and therefore were in a weaker position.     I feel really sorry for any independent minded muslim woman. I really do....|`|DO7lDtqxaa	No, I do not believe a womans faith is weaker. The reason is..   Al-Baqara(221)   Do not marry unbelieving women until they believe; a slave woman who believes is better than an unbelieving woman even though she allure you. Nor marry (your girls) to unbelievers until they believe: a man slave who believes is better than an unbeliever, even though he allure you. Unbelievers do (but) beckon you to the fire. But Allah beckons by His Grace to the Garden (of Bliss) and forgiveness, and makes His Signs clear to mankind: that they receive admonition       http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Interf...  http://quranexplorer.com/quran/|`|MYN4VFJvaa	I will never consider marrying a non-muslim guy    a) b/c It's forbidden in my religion    b)  since I believe Islam is the right religion, I would want my husband to accept the truth so we can both enter heaven together :)    c) I want my kids to see their parents unified in faith
h3gMzNS3aa	The quran makes no mention of them.    You're either a person of the book (non-trinitarian monotheist Christian, Jew, Muslim) or a Sabean and you're able to go to heaven under certain conditions or an unbeliever. However, any monotheist who worships god alone, does good works and believes in a day of judgment may be considered a monotheist, which is like a Sabean. All others are unbelievers and Hindus & Buddhists are unbelievers.    However people who have not heard the true message of Islam may be able to go to heaven out of mercy for their ignorance. Buddhists and hindus have a chance here. If they rejected even after understanding Islam, they fall into unbelief without ignorance.    Buddhism teaches that there's no creator god, not to worship god, that the soul doesn't exist and that there's no day of judgment. This is a serious sin. However the only sin that's unforgiveable is to make partners with allah, but Buddhists don't have a creator god to begin with so they're not really making partners with allah. But they deny these other requirements to be a believer.    Hinduism is monotheist in some respects in that all is brahman, but the deities are seen as separate deities at times while in others it's just different aspects of one reality (like 99 names of allah). So hinduism's complicated to judge in this respect, since a hindu will worship Vishnu the preserver much like a muslim will repeat the name of allah the preserver 99 times to emphasise that aspect. Lower-level Hindus sometimes worship objects themselves, which is a big sin in Islam and a non-wise act according to higher levels of hinduism. Hindus believe in souls and god and the need to do good works but they don't believe in the day of judgment, so they don't satisfy one of the requirements of the quran to be a worshipper of god alone (that's why Deists count as unbelievers too, even though they're monotheist & do good deeds).    Hinduism & Buddhism both violate Islam's requirement of animal sacrifice because they refuse to do so. Based on all this info, it seems most buddhists and hindus are not submitters to god (muslims). But it primarily depends on whether they understood islam or not to reject it in the first place. I think it takes years to understand Islam sufficiently before actual Islam can be rejected... when I see people say "how come if you kill yourself you get 23 virgins?" then they haven't studied Islam in detail, so it might be hard to be a rejecter of Islam if you don't understand what you're rejecting, eg. I might reject watching a TV show, but unless I really knew what the show was about I'm only rejecting the show but not its contents because if I had known the contents I would have actually watched it, so I rejected the show superficially but didn't reject it in substance.|`|1b47d266c534a22e56fed1ec2c0bf117aa	To each his own.|`|hhVz4BlUaa	pagan bastards and uduno, respectively|`|6SlBdQZ8aa	Well wait a minute mam..    I am a Muslim..     Well I would say that..In Hinduism..There is a Prophecy of a Avatar (like a Prophet coming to teach all good things etc..forbid evil etc..).. His name is Kalki Avatar..which is mentioned in the Hindu Scripture.. VEDAAS>>> So the Attributes mentioned are straight directing to Prophet Mohammed SAW.. and Its is forbidden in HINDUISM..TO DO IDOL WORSHIP.. .. SO WHAT THEY ARE DOING IS AGAINST THERE OWN RELIGION..     BUDDHISM.. IS BUDDHA. Who never claimed divinity..      Al-Araf [7:3]  [Say (O Muhammad SAW) to these idolaters (pagan Arabs) of your folk:] Follow what has been sent down unto you from your Lord (the Qur'an and Prophet Muhammad's Sunnah), and follow not any Auliya' (protectors and helpers who order you to ASSOCIATE partners in worship with Allah), besides Him (Allah). Little do you remember!    Al-Qasas [28:68]  And your Lord creates whatsoever He wills and chooses, no choice have they (in any matter). Glorified is Allah, and exalted above all that they ASSOCIATE (as partners with Him).    Al-Hajj [22:17]  Verily, those who believe (in Allah and in His Messenger Muhammad SAW), and those who are Jews, and the SABIANS, and the Christians, and the Majus, and those who worship others besides Allah, truly, Allah will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection. Verily! Allah is Witness over all things awitness.

So far the best guess I've heard is that there is a mysterious force that attracts one bit of matter (for example me) to other bits of matter (like this planet Earth thing...) A fellow named Newton called it Gravity.     All right, seriously... I think that there is no reason beyond the ones we make for ourselves. If we want to have a life that is meaningful we must decide what that is for ourselves individually. This is a subjective value that we each must place on the experience individually and no one else's reason would ever be meaningful or satisfying to you for that reason. For some that would seem to be a matter that relates to their unique and personal understanding of their faith, or spirituality, for others there is no need for "meaning" since they do not have a religious or philosophical point of view in which their existence has a personal frame of reference.    Since it is not universal it would seem obvious that the meaning of life is not objective.

The earth is a like substrate and we are growing on it.  We are energy filters. The brain takes all this random info around and filters it into a meaningful picture, we call the self. I think it is a natural part of the evolution of the universe. Matter is becoming more compex and novel. What I really wonder is like who am 'I'? What makes me separate from the air I breathe or the water I drink? I am like a dot on an endless line, a point. Death is nothing to fear to me anymore, it all seems too far off weird, science does not do it for me fully. I need more than that. I need to experience truth, not have some math fourmula that abstractly represents some sort of truth  Many of the concepts that have led to the mechanized picture of nature are only theoretical abstractions. Theoretical abstractions are quite useful; they allow us to build all kinds of technologies that operate adequately, in some cases astonishingly adequately. So we are very impressed by this abstract knowledge and mechanical understanding of the way energy is exchanged between physical bodies. So, Sometimes we mistake these abstractions for the world as it is, we mistake the abstractions as our experienced world. This leads us into crazy ideas like we as human beings are determined mechanisms or that nature as it exists without the human subject is without purpose, beauty, or value.   From an embodied point of view experience is pre reflective. We are in the world before we think about what that world might be. Any thoughts we might have or concepts we might form about that world are always just that, thoughts. The laws of nature as science has formulated them are mathematical symbols. These symbols only refer to anything because human beings know how to relate to them. So, the human being is always involved experienically in this process of getting to know the world. Scientific knowledge is an inter-subjective enterprise and never is an objective world reached, perceived or sensed. Its always a theoretical entity and as a theoretical entity its very useful, but we should not mistake this technical knowledge or this theoretical entity for the actual world as we experience. When we do so we lead ourselves into all kinds of existential confusion, if we return to our immediate experience we remember that creativity, freedom, expression, and morality are all just as real as any of the scientific knowledge we have written in our text books. This is not to demean scientific knowledge. This is just to bring to attention the order of gathering knowledge and what comes prior to the abstract conceptual knowledge that we gain from science. That being our living embodied experience.|`|dl97DmmYaa	This is the only planet in the galaxy where humans are fit to live.  Other planets near us do not have water, air, and vegetation.

xCfub799aa	Oh dear.    I honestly don't know what to say. I actually cried reading about how much pain you are in right now!    Okay listen, don't do anything, ANYTHING, drastic.  This is all in the heat of the moment. I could be completely wrong but things usually die down with time. I think your parents and his parents need space and distance which is obviously highly unfair and unjust on the two of you but considering they play a major role in your lives try and play along with it, for at least a week. I know that's impossible for you because I would be devastated. This is the moment that you need Josh the most and he is unable to be with you.  I say (even if this is 14hrs later) take a deep breath, go to your room, lie on your bed and close your eyes for five minutes thinking of nothing and just concentrating on your breathing. At school today just talk to Josh at lunch and recess, get the full story from his point of view and then discuss the most delicate way of handling this explosive situation.    As regards the depression. I've been on anti-depressents which just seemed to leave me numb of any feeling, like I just didn't care when I was on them. John is just starting to take them now, but unlike me they are helping him a lot, so I wouldn't stop taking them if I were you.  I think you should come out to your school. But if it's anything like the highschool I went to (strict catholic highschool who hated gays) then it's best to leave it alone.    Oh god, my advice is stupid and I don't know what to say. I'm so sorry. You know I'm here for you and I feel for you.     Email me please if things get too much! You helped me in my time of need and now I'm here to help you!|`|HyknijLxaa	wow this is an extremely sad story....    i remember reading your earlier questions about how much you two are in love and it is terrible that people are trying to ruin it    i think you and josh should still see each other..just you have to keep it secret from the adults    meet at friends houses so you can see each other    what age do you become an adult in  Australia?  if your parents want you out and you think you should leave as well then maybe you could get your own place, like an apartment    you both know that you two are meant for each other...don't let anyone get in the way of that    it will all work out someday, don't worry|`|ltYtxmjEaa	dude that sucks...reminds me of my life in highschool! tough it out. thats all you can do. wait it out. bare the pain. and when you can, get out. i mean, im still at home... granted im only 19. but i desperatly wanted to leave, i couldnt though... lack of money and all. and my dad and me actually had a physical fight!! tough it out, and stay on your toes with them. you can try to talk to them. really try to get through, without yelling or anything though. and if that doesn't work. leave it alone until you can leave. :) good luck man!|`|Ut9Y1xUoaa	Don't blame yourself and don't let anyone blame you or lay a guilt trip on you because of THEIR problems and hang-ups.

The second thing to do is to get this stupid idea that you have nothing to lose out of your head, you always have things to lose. It just so happens that sometimes it is worth risking them.     The third thing is to go to sleep, take a good long nap and when you wake take a few hours to evaluate the situation. I guarantee you that given a little time you will find a good solution and you will feel better. When you panic things always seem worse than they really are.     The last piece of advise I have is that while everyone HATES to hear this, you are obviously young and have a lot of time ahead of you so don't freak out. Believe me that no matter how bad it seems all you have to do is wait it out. It may be hard and it may take years but eventually you will come out on the other side of this and you will be a better stronger person so just take it slow and don't ever let yourself think that it's the end of the world because frankly even if it was, then congratulations the world is ending and there is really nothing left to fret over.|`|a432b51e0a46f5957270f47cd8423553aa	OMG :( thats really bad dude. i'm sorry it happen. I dont really know if there is anything you can do other than give it time and hope that Josh's mum will calm down. Dont try and force issues or she could get angry :(|`|NlWSj3OWaa	your parents seem 2 have enough problems right now so i don't think u should add 2 them. it might b better 2 keep your personal life personal for now. Coming out is best done when its calm and going 2 your mom first. she will understand and accept better then she will b able 2 help u when its time for dad 2 know. sounds like right now u r better served 2 let things die down for awhile. It wont b fun if dad kicks u out and the shock will have him saying things 2 u that wont b kind.  my advise is focus on schoolwork, and see josh when u can but don't come out till a better time when its calm.|`|BU6pYizfaa	omg... thats soo sad.   I would say not to tell everybody though. Just people that really care about you and would not judge you for it. I think you should talk to your parents, tell them how much pressure you are under and how overwhelmed you feel. I know this is going to be very hard, but they love you and will do their best to make you feel better (i know i could never handle this much pressure). I would suggest telling your parents how much you love Josh and maybe they will understand  and maybe his mom will too.  You could always see Josh when both your parents and his parents are gone (at work or anywhere else). Sorry if i'm not much help, i've never had anything like this happen...   My best advice would be to give them time and see Josh as much as you can, whether it's just at school and youth group, or if you sneak out to see each other.   Email me if you want to talk about this or anything else.  I would say pick up Josh and then find somewhere that you both can live, maybe a hostel to start out if he was willing to do that. But then you could get into kidnapping charges...****...that is so sad, i don't even know what to say. Why did you take the pic of you two off, you were so cute together.   You should talk to his parents though, if you are being let go, which is bullshit that your mom is doing that. If she knows you are having as many emotional problems as you are, she should be a bit more sympathetic.  seriously though,  if you need to talk, EMAIL ME.  If you really want to stay where you are and be with Josh... i hate to say it... you might have to find a friends house and not tell your parents where you are.|`|nQW1MSMpaa	Follow Tim's advice, it is good.    While everything seems bad right now, and it all seems to be spiraling out of control and everybody is all emotional, nothing can be resolved. It is best to take time to breath, take a nap, or even sleep on it - see how things are looking in the morning, tempers may not be so frayed.|`|0c9cGh8Oaa	Wow,,,, Im really sorry to hear this , you truely are like a hero and someone i look up too... I might not know you to well , but what i have gotten to know about you is that ur such an amazing guy!!! I know that my advice might sound cheesy and stupid but i think you should listen to your heart, what do you actualy feel like doing ? If you really love him (which i think you do) you will do the right thing fight for wat you want and throught all those challenges and obstacles you will finaly get what you wanted no matter how hard or how much you had to fight. Dont listen to your his mom she like many other moms (that have gay kids ) are afraid. Enjoy the time that you have with him he is and will always be your shining star no matter what happen!! Dont let any of this hurt you emotionaly or physicaly because i promise you that everything will be better at the end.   Im not really much of a advice person,, but what i have said comes from the heart. You are speacial, and you have done no wrong so everything is going to be better.   E-mail me if want ...      Your boyfriend must be very lucky to have you and vise versa i bet,  dont stop believing!|`|b371fd5225e0f0948944cb7d323618b7aa	this may sound strange to you but what does meditation mean to you? you are panicking in your situation and you need to relax to a point where you can think rationally.    i would love to *try* and help you but you are full of chaos and your question is spontaneous prose of all your thoughts pouring out at once.    focus on your mind and roll the weight of the world off of your shoulders. then you can turn around and pick up the pieces 1 at a time. you can look at each piece and say "why does this piece exist? can i do anything about it?"     certain problems will have no viable short term solution which means you can not let it get to you because there is nothing you can do.    do that first so you can organize your thoughts.
N8UwWt2Kaa	This is NOT your fault!    Your parents sound like they have their own problems already, and it seem so to me that your dad  is using you as a scapegoat because he wants out. And as far as your bf, I don't think his parents know him very well or trust him. Obviously you see something in him that they don't, and unfortunately they probably won't until he's a little older. In this situation, it seems like your relationship is all that you two have got. And this will be a real test for you guys. Remember, love can overcome any obstacle, and if you guys are really in love than hold on to it.     And, I also think that you should change the way you think, you can help people to the best of your ability but ultimately they have to help themselves. Josh is young, but that doesn't mean that he's unaware of his emotions, but as far as this goes you have to allow him to fully figure things out. It's hard enough having to come out, and its especially hard when you have people around you making you feel like your wrong.     I think that's probably what he's feeling, it's not that he doesn't love you or that your making him depressed. He just needs to be allowed to be who he is, and he can't do that with his parents and friends ratting him out all of the time. But I promise you things will get better, it's just a test of faith, so be strong and hold on to what you do have.  I hope this helps, and I really hope you guys can figure this out.    Good Luck!|`|uky2nsh8aa	*gives you a hug* i'm gonna come back later to edit, i need to get ready for school, but dude, we're in like the exact same situation. >.|`|b371fd5225e0f0948944cb7d323618b7aa	can i just say that getting drunk is always a bad idea.    add the fact that you are in a state of depression and it will make it much worse.    if you are on antidepressants this is very dangerous. please do not mix psychotropic drugs with alcohol.    refer to my other comment about flushing the chaos from your mind. perhaps you are causing problems but you can not fix the problems while you are freaking out and i don't see enough information to know.|`|nQEiNGkeaa	No child or young adult, is ever the cause of a family breaking up. If your parents have decided to split, then it is their relationship with each other that has failed not the relationship that they had with you. You are not the cause of their problems.    As for Josh, you really need to talk to him and try and find out why he gets depressed. You may find that he misses you so much when you are not around, that when he sees you, he realises that you will have to go home again soon and he is thinking about that, rather than enjoying the time you do have together.    Good luck|`|AyEkA6Flaa	Hey Connor!    With respect to Josh, I see two possibilities, and I'm not sure which one is correct.    -- It is possible that Josh's mom just doesn't want you around because she can't accept the possibility of her son being gay.  And he might feel terribly caught between his parents and you, on one hand wishing to please them, and on the other hand wishing to please you.  He may not know how to balance those two weighty realities, so he gets depressed.    -- On the other hand...one thing I noticed when watching your last video of fishing with Josh...when you alone with him...he may have felt on the spot, too public, and smothered by all the attention.  You are an affectionate and loving guy, Connor, but it *might* be that you are at times a bit too intense and overwhelming for Josh.  Perhaps he is depressed because he does love you, but he doesn't know how to tell you to back off and be less intense.  He is afraid of hurting you and doesn't know how to talk to you about it, being as you are the dominant guy in the relationship and a couple years older.  So anyway, it might be that you are just too powerful or too big of a presence and he feels smothered or trapped, but at the same time cares about you, and has no idea how to handle it.    Even the way you talk to him when making Y!A questions, like, "But Josh, remember this..." may seem to him like you are being way too public with your relationship, and he is upset by all the attention.  I dunno, but you may seem a bit overwhelming to Josh possibly.    That's pure speculation of course.    Meanwhile, don't be fatalistic!  "every single one.... Crashes".  Not so!  You aren't under a curse, Connor.  There's no reason why you cannot have joy and happiness in your friendships, so don't convince yourself of failure beforehand.    I don't have all the answers, but hope this is food for thought.  Just...lighten up...be cheerful around Josh, and not controlling.  Trust!    Hugs to a fine fellow!|`|xCfub799aa	1) You are not the cause of your family breakup. Never, ever in a million years could you be the cause! When my parents separated they used me as a scapegoat, well my father actually. Yes, that's right he used my homosexuality as an excuse to leave and because my mother was so upset she said "see what you've done Ben! You could never be normal could you, now look what's happened!" I'll never forget that betrayal but a few years later we had a big sit down and they were adament that I was not and never the reason for their marriage failure.    2) You do not make Josh depressed. He is depressed about the situation you are in not you personally. Anyone can see that he loves you. That video of your life proves everything and I would watch that to remind yourself that he will be waiting. Actually, maybe don't watch it too soon, your emotions are probably a bit raw at the moment.    3) Friends 18th. You know that I have a binge drinking problem. So my advice to you would be no, especially because you are depressed and alcohol depresses the nervous system even more. John would be saying the same thing, don't get drunk, I don't like it when your drunk etc. I would say have a little bit but don't go overboard, for Josh. But if I were you in your situation, the temptation to forget would get the better of me.    3) You are not a jerk, at all! You are a caring and loving person with feelings. You're upset which is why you're acting out, my therapist calls it a defense mechanism and she says I use it to drive people away. Which is why I ultimately get called a person with a bad attitude, even though I'm not.    4) The people you help never crash and burn. Think about me! What would I have done without your advice!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...    So, to conclude. You are not the cause of all this, at all and you know that I'm not lying about that.    I'm going to send you an email when I get back from work to check you're okay.    I care about what happens, remember that. Also remember that Josh still loves you and you still love him, yes you're apart for the moment but that's what you need to hang on to. There's always school remember, he's not completely out of your life yet!|`|stWGfFeTaa	you could be the cause but i doubt it. i have mean teachers who say crap like that when there just at a loss for words as to the proper thing to say when there mad at u, theyll say weird stuff like that sometimes. i have heard a teacher say the f word, s word and d word and ****** and p issed but i have never heard a teacher say BALLS before untill friday, when my hisotry teacher was yelling at me and matt. i dont think your the cause, my dad acts like that 2 sometimes after hes been yelled at by my mom, maybe he was just mad at something else or in thought. just f--k it who cares, just ride it out and sweat the small stuff. worry about grades not your social life. a lot of people dont have one.|`|i4Vt4YJ4aa	I think you need to rest your head now..Cause you seem to have hard time at the moment.|`|FJPKtZN5aa	if you want to talk about it to me im me at xmcrguyx@yahoo.com|`|BU6pYizfaa	I don't think you are the cause. It sounds to me like you got the sh1t end of the stick, i think you sound like a great person. It's just that everyone around you is picking out all the small flaws they see and assuming thats all you have to offer. Your dad kind of sounds like an a$$hole. So, i think he is negatively affecting how you feel about yourself. Same with your teacher and everyone. They are all being cruel to you, you deserve better. It takes a pretty big person to try to admit to their own flaws, even if they are uncertain, you did just that  So i would say you are not the cause, it is all the negativity being thrown at you.

Don't ever think you are. No one is.|`|nQW1MSMpaa	Hey guy, it seems to me that your dad might have a problem with your being gay, this might be why he picks on you and bullies you. The comment that he made about the washing up is emotional abuse, it is a form of making you feel worthless and guilty, and it is obviously working.    Because you are being emotionally abused you are depressed and you don't see things rationally, it may even make you act like a rude, selfish person. If your teacher was any good she might try to look for reasons why you act the way you do, she might even seek counseling for you.    Are you the cause? No.    Is it your fault you are gay? No.    Is it your fault that your dad can't cope with that and bullies you because of that? No.    Is it your fault that your response to your dad's emotional abuse and bullying is depression and acting out? No, this is perfectly normal behavior.    Is it your fault that your drama teacher can't see that your being rude and selfish is acting out? No.    Are you a jerk? No.    Don't be so hard on yourself. I think you are expecting too much from yourself. You're only 16, just be 16. Just be a kid and enjoy yourself, don't try to put too much pressure on yourself. Don't try to solve other people's problems, you've got enough of your own.    Take some time to just be you. Just you. No expectations on yourself, just be you.|`|gi1cEGgRaa	listen and listen good, it is not your fault it is not with in your power to break apart your parents.

Isaiah written 700 Bc/e before the coming of the gentiles Messiah Cristos/Christ from the GReek meaning the anointed one  Isaiah 42:1 says he will be a light to the gentiles.

He will show His arm unto us  He will be despised and rejected   He will lay down his life as a lamb, to make atonement for our sins  he will die with the wicked and be burried with the rich  He will see his seed and prosper (last verse of Isaiah chapter 53)    JEWISH ONCE SAID IT WAS THE MESSIAH  today in true form they mostly say it is Israel... when did Israel reject and despise itself, get marred more than any man, lay down its life innocent for its own sins, die with the wicked and get burried with the rich, see it's own seed spiritually and prosper after dying?    MUSLIMS say that Jesus is the Messiah, born of a virgin, lived sinless, and rose to heaven...that he didnt ever die, another took his place on the cross...making his mother crying at the cross...over the wrong person dilusional? and as she said "Behold my savior and my God." John's gospel....  MUSLIMS SAY that the Jewish people tampered and changed the bible (yet why would they PUT THIS IN ABOUT HIM DYING FOR THEIR SINS?..AND not remove it rather than put this in, as it is so obviously pointing to......would those who despise and reject add this? the one that Muslims say is the Messiah coming back to earth=clue it is not Mohamad)    ATHEISTS could you predict what will happen in 700 years... like this?

The abbreviation of "Xmas" for Christmas, long reviled by many conservative and Low Church Christians, is not nearly as blasphemous as many contend. Rather than a sacrilegious removal of "Christ" from Christmas and replacing him with an unknown, as some claim, the "Xmas" abbreviation has a long history in the church. In Greek, the language in which the New Testament was first written, "chi" (c or C), which is almost identical to the Roman alphabet "X," is the first letter of the word "Christ" (cristoV, or as it would be written in older manuscripts, CRISTOS). In fact, the symbol of the fish in the early church came from using the first letter of several titles used for Jesus (Jesus Christ Son of God Savior) that when combined spelled the Greek word for fish (icquV, ichthus).    In the early days of printing when typesetting was done by hand and was very tedious and expensive, abbreviations were common. The church began to use the abbreviation "X" for the word "Christ" in religious publications. From there, the abbreviation moved into general use in newspapers and other publications, and "Xmas" became an accepted way of printing "Christmas."    Have a great day!|`|45Mmu3SFaa	Because the name Christ is so powerful people are intimated buy the name....|`|B12rW6Dsaa	use it properly at least...jesus is 'the' christ not just jesus christ or christ.he is the saviour the christ|`|HD6McHinaa	I don't know unless the Name of Jesus Christ is hated.

I didn't really notice. I do agree that there are PLENTY good-looking people out there of mixed race/ethnicity. But somehow, I think we tend to view them all as beautiful because for the most part, the ones we usually see in the media are the GOOD-LOOKING ones. Face it, the television/movies/showbiz usually only show people who are good-looking enough to raise the ratings/box office income. I mean, if Halle Berry doesn't look like Halle Berry, would she still be used in movies? Exactly.

1Vih78dZaa	Are you seriously suggesting you look at a clock only twice a day (and wake up in the early morning to do one of those checks)? Are you seriously suggesting that every number you encounter every day is 444 or has 444 in it? That seems highly unlikely.    First, I'd suggest that you're only remembering the times when you encounter that number. You will see many other numbers every day, but since they are not "meaningful" to you, then you just disregard them.    Since you have effectively told your subconscious that you find it very interesting to see 444, your subconscious will prompt you to look at the clock at that time and to take note of the number in other contexts.    We all deal with so much information every day that we could not cope with paying conscious attention to more than a tiny fraction of it. That's why we are so very good at disregarding almost all of what our senses detect. Nonetheless, we are are aware of it all at some level and, if you feel that something is important  be that the number 444, the colour of a ripe berry in a bush or the yellow and black pattern of a tiger crouching in the undergrowth  then your subconscious will give you a metaphorical kick in the shins and draw your attention to it even when you're concentrating on something else. For example, It's possible for you to catch a glimpse of the clock out of the corner of your eye which is so quick that you don't consciously register it, but for you subconscious to have noticed that the clock is displaying an "interesting" time. Or you might pass a billboard advertising some product of no interest to you whatsoever, but your subconscious might take note that the phone number in small print at the bottom contains "444", so you end up taking a closer look at it.    One regularly sees questions here from people who are seeing patterns in the time they see on a clock. Usually, this is repetitions of numerals (11:11, 2:22, 4:44 and so on) or sequences (1:23, 2:34, 3:45 and so on), but it can also be things like 9:11 or numbers relating to another date that's significant to the asker.    If they want to feel special and singled out by cosmic forces or something, they can choose to believe that an angel is whispering in their ear telling them when to look at the clock or that there's some amazing mystical message in the numbers they're seeing, but the explanation I've given above seems to me to be both the most sensible one and pretty amazing in its own way, given what it suggests about powers of our brains which we normally disregard.|`|ad08fe27604f983a2b098f5c3a9bdfa5aa	Confirmation bias.

4GiIXWUXaa	AH, now THIS i can answer.    Open bottle.  Pour into glass.  Add rocks (ice) IF you're a sissy so as to water it down.  Add OJ, Cranberry Juice, Fruit Juice, Iced Tea, Soda or whatever is to your liking to make it a sweet drink.  Drink and Enjoy responsibly.     Add OJ to make a screwdriver  Add OJ + Peach Schnapps to make a Fuzzy Navel  Add Cranberry Juice + lime twist to make a Cosmopolitan  Add Vermouth and Olives to make a V.Martini :)    Go with Grey Goose or Belvedere if you can. There ARE higher end Vodka's but those aren't worth the purchase if you are going to polish off the bottle alone. Smirnoff or Absolut are okay in a pinch.     Here are some recipes:   http://www.drinkoftheweek.com/vodka.htm  http://e-alko.com/drinks_vodka.html    xoxo  ?    *edit*  YES you can smell alcohol on someones breath ... Vodka's not as bad as like JD or something, but good grief, IF you have to ask that ... i doubt you're old enough TO drink ...|`|A90SRsTxaa	I drink, but only beer and sometimes wine these days. I like vodka too much to drink it responsibly. A good basic vodka is a screw driver which is just some orange juice and maybe a little peach schnapps or something. This is for a vodka that isn't that good to begin with.    These are for good vodka.  Vodka with a little splash of cranberry is good and some Ice. Martinis are great by the time you get done with the first one. There are several ways to make them. Like I said though drinking vodka is a little too indulgent for me.     I highly recommend you do not pour it into any kind of soft drink like pepsi.|`|xMGUDenDaa	u can smell vodka on peoples breath my friend|`|J7KSKm54aa	When I quit drinking, I was drinking vodka and diet coke- Smirnoff. When I was younger, I drank beer daily. Vodka smells like alcohol.|`|18f4aeb76a3e8aee506482a962921d26aa	Traditionally: small glass and down in one.

Also, this is religion and spirituality - so please at least make an effort to reference Fireball, Losasha or babby.|`|Nf0FLjGhaa	1. all alcohol will be on your breath  2. the best way (with good vodka, at least) is neat. fill shot glass. drink. repeat. you can mix it. a screwdriver is always nice. get a glass, fill with some orange juice and some vodka. take a sip. fine tune the drink by adding one or the other, depending on how strong you want it. when it's just right, chug it and start over|`|HDyqzvUkaa	Stay awhile and Listen!    Firstly, you must know of the spiritual effects of the VODKA will bring you to a level beyond that of the BEER.    Vodka is harsh to me when it's be itself, but i've done it and it's not that bad.      It mixes well with citrus, usually Orange juice, and it'll be fine in Pepsi.    As beer drinker, you'd probably prefer it in Pepsi, than a fruity drink.      of course, JUICE has vitamins and will have you feeling better    Edit; NO not all alcohol stays on the breath, i'm pretty sure Vodka is one.|`|mC4mnvGFaa	Its best to mix vodka with either orange juice or tonic water.

CuHfhI1qaa	If you really are a Christian protestant then you won't try to disrespect her with a one night stand. I think the Hijab is to help avoid men thinking sexually of her, obviously it's against her religion to have recreational sex.   Don't dishonor a girl like that.|`|X5hTmAkBaa	most i've come across are humble and completely down to earth... a good friend in hs|`|bltgAc9Maa	Well, I'm from Indonesia so there are a lot Muslim girls here, whether they wear hijab or not, and just like all of us, they all have various personality and attitude, so you can't really judge them all equally. A Muslim girl may be serious and thoughtful and calm, while another may be humorous and quirky and witty, while another one is very feminine and beauty-conscious and sensitive, etc etc etc. They're no more different than any other girls out there. The only different thing is their religion, that's all.    Anyway, regarding your friend, I think she's just trying to be the best friend she can be for you. Her intention is nice and I appreciate her for it. But if you feel that she starts to annoy you or intimidate you, then I suggest you should talk to her. Tell her that you like being friends with her and that you like her as a person, but you also want to be respected and accepted for the way you are. Tell her that you are a tolerant person as you claim to be and for you, the world is a better place if people can accept other people wholly without trying to change them. Don't make a scene or be angry with her. Just tell that CALMLY and NICELY. Whatever you do, don't start attacking her religion, coz looking from your story, the issue here is NOT related to religion whatsoever. It's just a matter of accepting people for the way they are. Her religion has got nothing to do with it. I'm sure she would understand. And if she really is as nice as you say she was, then she should have no problem with your honesty and eventually start appreciating and accepting you for the way you are, just like you appreciate and accept her for the way she is.    EDIT: Wait, what do you mean if she's "allowed to have sex with you"? Do you like her (I mean sexually)? I though you were only friends with her. Well, in that case, you should really ask yourself if she also likes you the way you like her. Does she also consider you more than just friends? I guess it's pretty okay if you have a crush on her. I mean, it's perfectly normal for a human being to be in love with another human being.  But like I said, you should really assure yourself if she also feels the same way for you, or if she only considers you as friend and nothing more. And since she's of different religion/culture than you, you should also make sure of yourself if she ever wants to have a romantic relationship with a non-Muslim guy, because some of them, despite being very close friends to you, may object with the idea of dating or having a romantic relationship with non-Muslim guys, especially if they wear hijab and brought up in a very conservative Muslim family. And of course, one more very important thing you should consider is: are you prepared of the risk of jeopardizing your friendship with her and/or losing her if it turns out she doesn't like you back the way you want her to be? I suggest you take your time first before "opening your heart" to her. And you should be ready for whatever consequences that may come. If it turns out she also likes you and she has no problem dating you, then by all means, go for it. But remember, since you both come from different worlds, there are some differences and rules that ought to be respected. If she doesn't want to have a pre-marital sex with you, whether because of her religious faith or personal view, you should respect that. She should also be able to accept and respect your religion and personal belief too. And if YOU have a problem with that, then I suggest you look for another girl. Don't try to "change" her opinion, coz I believe you must know how sucks it must feel to have people try to change you, right?|`|6eKqfXkwaa	dont stand beside one that has a rucksack|`|AA10996005	In islam the whole idea of "girl friend" is forbidden unless it is totally platonic. Other than that the only option is marriage :D. I guess from your question you are not muslim so even marriage is not an option. Anyway being muslim has nothing to with the personality so if you like her go for it and be her friend but remember the limitations. As for her signals , she might like you however as i just mentioned it wont work out. Sorry dude...|`|zLUk9YyCaa	''THE person with a long answer: I am not trying to marry her, I just wonder if she's game for a night stand with a typical non muslim person line me? and I dont care if she rejects me. I understand ur from a different country and that ur point of view is different from my point of view''    so all you want is sex?    well anyways, it differs with each muslim. over in the arab countries they are very strict on their rules and would probably not allow it. over here, i guess it is accepted and not viewed as immoral in their eyes. hmm and what she is trying to say from the health bit you were talking about..perhaps she was just being a concerned friend.

It isn't the job of evolutionary biologists to determine how life "spontaneously generated", but of physicists.  There was once a great nobel prize winning physicists who noted that matter does indeed spontaneously materialize, and it is a perfectly natural act of the Universe.  He asserted that proof of God would be a universe with nothing in it, because it would take divine intervention to stop things from materializing.    Now, had you done an incline of research perhaps you would have known that already.    Also, your argument is totally non sequitur.  If you believe evolution to be too difficult to believe due to a lack of total, complete, and absolute conclusive evidence for every facet of the subject's assertion, despite the massive and constantly accumulating physical evidence for most of it (evolution being a fact but natural selection the theory), than the God hypothesis fails from the beginning because it has NO evidence whatsoever.  And you dare to challenge only "intelligent" people respond?  Why would they respond to a completely unintelligible and completely incoherent question such as yours?    If you believe life couldn't have started naturally, than the God hypothesis couldn't satisfy your inquiry, because it automatically regresses into a self refuting follow-up question: where did God (a being  of seemingly far more complexity) come from?      Perhaps you should think a bit more before you start typing.|`|RrVr9Bwfaa	Why is it that even though I didn't finish high school, I can still find the answers to these questions within minutes of using a search engine.  You aren't even asking questions that belong in R&S.  These questions belong in the Science category.    Try looking. The answers are there and it makes more sense for you to find them than for someone to try and give you decades of research in a few lines.  Asking these sorts of questions here tells me you aren't really interested in knowing the answer.  You simply think you know the answer and are looking to stir up those who don't believe as you do.|`|xTriyfWuaa	i dont need proof to demonstrate the fact that i dont know how the universe originated, but i sure as hell can make fun of blatant imaginary claims that others present.    oh and your stereotypical views on abiogenesis are completely out of date.

Conversly. a lack of understanding in the field of abiogenesis does not invalidate the theory of evolution.     Secondly, Atheists don't make fun of Creationist because they believe in God; we make fun of them because they believe God created all life in 7 days - a completely arbitrary number given that not only does God have eternity on his hands but that God could also create the physical and natural laws which govern evolution - so why wouldn't God just do that? Why don't you just credit evolution to God if you must believe in him? Why does evolution threaten you so much?|`|06aceb1d90d3755e9049c8a9a59210ddaa	1) Evolution does not cover the origin of life and as such we "evolutionists" do not have to explain it.  If you will use such ridiculous terms to group "believers" of scientific theories together then you should be addressing the "abiogenecists" and "panspermicists".    2) Lab results have been used to demonstrate how organic molecules form spontaneously in "the wild".  These organic compounds include lipids and nucleotides which can make up a very simple self-replicating proto-cell.  Just because we don't know the specifics it doesn't mean that it's wrong.  What exactly has creationism demonstrated besides ignorance or cherry picking of results?    3) The reason we have 46 chromosomes compared to the 48 of other apes has been well documented.  The site of a fusion of one pair can be clearly seen when analysing chromosome 2, which shows superfluous telomeres and a redundant centromere.  There are also several damaged genes found between the telomeres that are duplicated from elsewhere in the genome.      Incidentally, the loss of an entire chromosome would result in death before the zygote stage - there are no known cases of anyone surviving without a chromosome, and all chromosome related retardations are due to the partial deletion of a chromosome or the duplication of portions of one or more.    In the most recent comments it is clear why you don't want to accept evolution because you think the idea that you're related in any way to organisms such as flies or whatever is offensive.  All I can say to that is grow up.  I could find it offensive that you're related to me but I choose to ignore it due to the extreme distance between our families.|`|KTtJYq4waa	HAHAHAHAHAHAH, intellectually insufficient people a.k.a. those who believe in god|`|v38WXjbFaa	Belief in God has absolutely nothing to do with the reason I consider creationists a bunch of willfully ignorant idiots.

I'm going to see a Pentecostal pastor on Sunday who teaches about the facts of evolution.|`|b2bMy1EAaa	Nothing can ever be 'proved' but there can be overwhelming evidence. Example I cannot prove blue apples do not exist, but I'm 99% confident they don't because of the evidence. We do not claim to know all the answers, but we keep trying instead of the blunt 'God did it'. At least we have the guts to question things and stride towards the truth. There is far more evidence for the big bang, evolution etc than there is for the creation story, infact the only evidence for that is the bible. You say no chemical combination has been found, fair enough but why if something so improbable mean it is untrue? All the evidence is there after it so why not? You can keep going with your blind faith but step by step, as scientists have done for hundreds of years, we will pick holes in all religion.    You believe everything just went 'poof!' and it existed, like a little magic story. Get a grip.    *edit* you sound like you've been brain raped by creationist 'science' books. You can't use the fossil record as an argument against evolution, it is evolution lol|`|91XGHfSaaa	Several problems with your question, dude.    1: not all atheists are "evolutionists"  2: there's no such thing as an "evolutionist". Are you a "Godist"?  3: Yeah, actually I can explain abiogenisis. I'm a biologist.   4: you clearly have no idea what you are talking about and are presumably parroting creationist bollocks.  5: Evolution and abiogenisis are two different things  6: As a result, your "question" is an Epic Fail.|`|QVFjO5m0aa	Well if you fallow evolution old designs for survival die off when stronger, smarter, faster. ETC. plants and animals develop the old ones never show up later on, evolution is all about going forward and improvement not going back and being weaker. So that "chemical combination" would no longer exist as it did in the beginning it was improved and changed, its all around us it is every living thing you see.|`|Z9WBVWhqaa	I don't think there is any point talking to atheists, you are wasting your time......I'm sure you have better things to do.|`|ZhR4QPymaa	Think in time of 4.6 billion years.  Life wasn't created spontaneously.  And scientific data from observations/hypotheses/theory arise from intense studies by peer-review based on following evidence, logic, and reason, rather than sourcing a book that says things were created, because it was written that they were created.  The origin of life isn't nailed down, but neither is the express functions of genes, DNA,  or consciousness.  However, there are great amounts of data that build a solid foundation in evolution, that by reason we can narrow down greatly on the hypotheses of the origins of life.      Chromosomes across species don't encode for the exact same things.  The number of chromosomes necessary for proper funciont is relative to each species.  And not all of your genes are expressed as traits in every cell at any given time. While we share 98% of our DNA with Chimpanzes, what DNA is expressed between are species is a bit more different.  Plus you get into the process of alternative splicing which in a sense, shuffle around genes to create even more proteins.    Also, you have to understand that not every organism that dies is converted into a fossil. Fossils are rare and to even find a complete fossil of an organism is extremely lucky.  To find a lineage that shows gradual changes is even more rare.  The fossils we find offer a VERY skewed view of the history of organisms.  So when you do find fossils with gradual changes, that are separated by millions of years by dating, it offers compelling evidence for evolution.    And don't you think many microevolutions accumulated overtime would be a macroevolution?  To believe in microevolution, given time, could only lead to macroevolution.    There weren't apes, but there were small mammals during the time of dinosaurs.    There is no way to even begin explaining everything, but if you're truly interested in learning about this, use this as sort of a jumppoint to begin your research.    I'm curious as to what you mean by microevolution not involving the chromosomes, when all genetic data or any heritible property involves chromosomes. Oftentimes, even a single base pair change creates a drastic change in funtion of the protein.  Sometimes, it's neutral, sometimes beneficiary.|`|8YUtmEU7aa	First off a person is mentally retarded, if they have an extra chromosome, not if they lose one.  That may be what you meant, though.    The "sudden" appearance of life you're talking about is the Cambrian Explosion. This is a time-frame at very early stages of multicellular life.  It seems reasonable, the biggest variations would occur when the opportunities for niches to fill are at their greatest.  It's not as though this occurred overnight,   The Cambrian is an entire period, millions of years.    The only difference between "micro-evolution" and "macro-evolution" is time.  What happens when you stack several micro evolutions together, and the lifeform is no longer very similar to its distant ancestor?    There are plenty of transitional fossils throughout the fossil record:    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitiona...    The reason you won't find ape-like creatures in the dinosaur time-frame, is that mammals, in general were only just beginning to come into existence near the end of the dinosaurs existence.  Apes evolved from earlier mammalian forms.    Just because you haven't seen the vastness of the entire fossil record, doesn't mean there's no evidence of evolution in it.  Dig a little deeper, and you might just see how well the record actually does point towards evolution.      For what it's worth, I never make fun of people, for simply believing in a god.  I rarely make fun of people, for any reason.|`|AA12120591	wooowww what a debated issue...now i m not sure whether i m creationist born or evolutionist born last but not least i would like to join in...the adam family or the ape family...mau cakap olang bukan olang mau cakap monyet bukan monyet....haiiii yaaaa mau hidup pun susah...maaaa

Your god is a ******* idiot.|`|4854FMZjaa	The Design Theory     The following notes from Swami Vivekananda's class talk are reproduced from his Complete Works, 6: 97-98. Being "notes"-and not a verbatim report, like his other lectures in the Complete Works-these are sketchy and may not represent the exact words spoken by Vivekananda. But they give a fairly good indication of his ideas on the subject.         The idea that nature in all her orderly arrangements shows design on the part of the Creator of the universe is good as a kindergarten teaching to show the beauty, power, and glory of God, in order to lead children in religion up to a philosophical conception of God; but apart from that, it is not good, and perfectly illogical. As a philosophical idea, it is entirely without foundation, if God is taken to be omnipotent.     If nature shows the power of God in creating the universe, [then] to have a design in so doing also shows His weakness. If God is omnipotent, He needs no design, no scheme, to do anything. He has but to will it, and it is done. No question, no scheme, no plan, of God in nature.     The material universe is the result of our limited consciousness. When we become conscious of our divinity, all matter, all nature, as we know it, will cease to exist.     The material world, as such, has no place in the consciousness of God as a necessity of any end. If it had, God would be limited by the universe. To say that nature exists by His permission is not to say that it exists as a necessity for Him to make us perfect, or for any other reason.     It is a creation for our necessity, not God's. There is no scheme of God in the plan of the universe. How could there be any if He is omnipotent? Why should He have need of a plan, or a scheme, or a reason to do anything? To say that He has is to limit Him and to rob Him of His character of omnipotence.     For instance, if you came to a very wide river, so wide that you could not get across it except by building a bridge, the very fact that you would have to build the bridge to get across the river would show your limitation; it would show your weakness, even if the ability to build the bridge did show your strength. If you were not limited but could just fly or jump across, you would not be under the necessity of building a bridge; and to build the bridge just to exhibit your power to do so would show your weakness again by showing your vanity, more than it would show anything else.     Monism and dualism are essentially the same. The difference consists in the expression. As the dualists hold the Father and the Son to be two, the monists hold them to be really one. Dualism is in nature, in manifestation, and monism is pure spirituality in the essence.     The idea of renunciation and sacrifice is in all religions as a means to reach God.|`|gBoUrlrKaa	God can do anything, why can't he be on call 24/7 to heal us?

Amputees are used because their condition is very clear and visible, and can't (currently) be healed by our medical science.    therefore if god is capable of healing anything, why not demonstrate the ultimate healing power and heal an amputee?  Surely there must at least once over the last 10,000 years been one faithful, deserving, pious amputee?   People claim that their god helps them find a boyfriend, get a job or recover from spots; isn't this a bit more deserving?    (answer: because he can't- which makes him impotent,  won't - which makes him evil, or doesn't exist.  My money's on the last of these)|`|mVsWyu0yaa	Muhammad:  You have simply missed the import of the problem.  If god (any god) could restore an amputated limb (through prayer, or faith, or even a ONE TIME miracle), it would prove TWO things:     1: God exists    2: Miracles are possible.     Humans, and their habits have NOTHING to do with it.  So until we find a god who can restore missing limbs, and those restorations are validated by medical or scientific investigation, the existence of god or miracles will ALWAYS remain in doubt....simply a matter of faith, which can never be proved.     It would be the same if anyone were ACTUALLY raised from the dead.  Even if it happened only ONCE and was verified scientifically.     Every other 'ailment', or illness.....even if cured, or in recession, could still be attributable to doctors, or misdiagnosis.  That would NEVER be the case with a restored limb.     Your argument that..."If god cures one thing he HAS to cure all the others" surely concretizes the notion that god does NOT exist....for if a god is all loving, and ALL POWERFUL, he would WANT to cure the ills and evils that plague mankind and he would be POWERFUL enough to do it.  Since that has not happened, we can conclude one of three things:     God does not CARE.     God is NOT all powerful.     God does not exist.     You shoot yourself in the foot with your argument, for the simple reason that your major premise is faulty.    p.s. Your response to Aashaf, suggesting that people are responsible for their OWN limbs being amputated, is simpy ludicrous: It dishonors all of those who have had their limbs destroyed in war, or natural disasters.   Just one more argument against an un-caring and powerless god.|`|AA10663644	Because healing an amputee will amount to pretty much 100% proof that God exists and that praying to this God is a valid thing. Cancer can be cured, but there are natural processes that help to understand why that may happen. But there is NO known cases of amputee's missing body parts growing back. It would not be able to be explained in any other way.    Since the result of amputees not being healed is the same with, or without, prayer, it is more logical to think the simpler of the 2 possibilities; that God doesn't exist.
gBoUrlrKaa	You wouldn't ask this if you were an amputee.    Compassion: get some.    Edit: He Should heal amputees.

Being "notes"-and not a verbatim report, like his other lectures in the Complete Works-these are sketchy and may not represent the exact words spoken by Vivekananda. But they give a fairly good indication of his ideas on the subject.         Concentration is the essence of all knowledge. Nothing can be done without concentration. Ordinary people waste ninety per cent of thought force and therefore they are constantly committing blunders. The trained mind never makes a mistake. When the mind is concentrated and turned backward on itself, everything within us will be our servant, not our master. The Greeks applied their concentration to the external world, and the result was perfection in art, literature, etc. The Hindu concentrated on the internal world, upon the unseen realm in the Self, and developed the science of Yoga.     Yoga means controlling the senses, will and mind. The benefit of its study is that we learn to control instead of being controlled. Mind seems to be layer on layer. Our real goal is to cross all these intervening strata of our being and find God. The end and aim of Yoga is to realize God. To do this we must go beyond relative knowledge, go beyond the sense-world. The world is awake to the senses, the children of the Lord are asleep on that plane. The world is asleep to the Eternal, the children of the Lord are awake in that realm(1). There is but one way to control the senses-to see Him who is the Reality in the universe. Then and only then can we really conquer our senses.    Concentration means restraining the mind into smaller and smaller limits. There are eight processes for restraining the mind. The first is Yama, controlling the mind by avoiding externals. All morality is included in this. Beget no evil. Injure no living creature. If you injure nothing for twelve years, then even lions and tigers will go down before you. Practice truthfulness. Twelve years of absolute truthfulness in thought, word, and deed gives us whatever we wish. Be chaste in thought, word, and action. Chastity is the basis of all religions. Personal purity is imperative. Next is Niyama, not allowing the mind to wander in any direction. Then comes Asana, posture. There are eighty-four postures: but the best is the most natural to each person; that is, which can be kept longest with the greatest ease. After this comes Pranayama, restraint of breath. Next is Pratyahara, drawing in of the organs from their objects. Then comes Dharana, concentration, followed by Dhyana, contemplation or meditation. (This is the kernel of the Yoga system.) And finally there is, Samadhi, superconsciousness.     The purer the body and mind, the quicker the desired result will be obtained. You must be perfectly pure. Do not think of evil things, such thoughts will surely drag you down. If you are perfectly pure and practice faithfully, your mind can finally be made a searchlight of infinite power. There is no limit to its scope. But there must be constant practice and non-attachment to the world.     When we reach the superconscious state, body-consciousness melts away. Then alone does we become free and immortal. To all external appearances, unconsciousness and superconsciousness are the same; but they differ as a lump of clay from a lump of gold. The one whose whole soul is given up to God has reached the superconscious plane.|`|OY1WlSKvaa	God says to hell with the amputees...

eeBBtPA6aa	I need more information. I am in my 30's and if I were to tell you why I think she left the game, I would have to know more information. I will give it a shot.    Maybe she thinks that because you are younger that you haven't gotten over it. You did run after her after she drove off. That is hard to say. Maybe she was surprised to see you there. Maybe that makes her uncomfortable, especially if she is at work, and maybe she can't work with you. But, maybe she can, I don't know. I would think she is more grown up than to avoid you like that. Is she the coach? I think if she left it wasn't because of you, or she would have left shortly after she made eye contact with you. Did she smile when she saw you? Maybe she thinks that you want more and won't stop letting her know. I don't know, but I would love to help you out. I just need more questions answered. Did she know you were going to be there?  If you want to be just her friend, you have to let her know that you hope things can go back to normal, and you won't be able to have another conversation like last year because she said she is involved. You have to respect that, if you care enough about her to want to stay her friend. You deserve someone who is unattached, and available, who can reciprocate your feelings in return. If you get a chance to talk to her let her know that she does not have to be uncomfortable around you. That was an awkward situation the two of you were in, and now it is over. If this is the first time she has seen you since then she may think you still want to pursue something more, maybe she wants to avoid an awkward situation like that again.. Like I said, I need to know more of the circumstances. Maybe she really did leave the game because she was ill. Have you had a chance to talk to her after you ran after her? E-mail me if you can.   Whatever happens, good luck, and remember some things just aren't meant to be, but everything happens for a reason.   Let me know more info so I can give you better advice.

HDyqzvUkaa	In the morning, as he was returning to the city,(AD) he became hungry. 19(AE) And seeing a fig tree by the wayside, he went to it and found nothing on it but only leaves. And he said to it, "May no fruit ever come from you again!" And the fig tree withered at once.        20When the disciples saw it, they marveled, saying, "How did the fig tree wither at once?" 21And Jesus answered them, (AF) "Truly, I say to you,(AG) if you have faith and(AH) do not doubt, you will not only do what has been done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain,(AI) 'Be taken up and thrown into the sea,' it will happen. 22And(AJ) whatever you ask in prayer, you will receive,(AK) if you have faith."

The LORD answered, "Judah, for I have given them victory over the land."  The leaders of Judah said to their relatives from the tribe of Simeon, "Join with us to fight against the Canaanites living in the territory allotted to us.  Then we will help you conquer your territory."  So the men of Simeon went with Judah.  When the men of Judah attacked, the LORD gave them victory over the Canaanites and Perizzites, and they killed ten thousand enemy warriors at the town of Bezek.  While at Bezek they encountered King Adoni-bezek and fought against him, and the Canaanites and Perizzites were defeated.  Adoni-bezek escaped, but the Israelites soon captured him and cut off his thumbs and big toes.  Adoni-bezek said, "I once had seventy kings with thumbs and big toes cut off, eating scraps from under my table.  Now God has paid me back for what I did to them."  They took him to Jerusalem, and he died there.  The men of Judah attacked Jerusalem and captured it, killing all its people and setting the city on fire.

XEbrGfZuaa	This is just a guess, from a vet. I think it's due to all the media  coverage of the last several years that has them scared. They'ed  rather hang out with mom and dad and be safe. I do have to applaud  my oldest grandson, who's 20, and is heading for Korea this spring.  He did the best thing possible, since he wasn't going on to college.  And he met his wife in one of the schools after basic, and now they  share the same MOS and travel together. He admits he's already  growing up fast, with the responsibilities he's been handed.      I've felt that it should be mandatory after highschool for kids to be  put into a branch of the military, to learn responsibility and to take  charge of their actions. Both women, as well as men. Let them take  two years out of their lives at least, to do their patriotic duty. Then  allow them to come home and go to college if they still choose to. Or  better yet, take it while in the service, and let them pull the standard  4 years duty. It sure would hurt them any.

3elj0E81aa	First things first, you can involve your teenager to plan for the party. This way, you would have a party both would really enjoy. Plan the venue first. The number of people coming for the party would also help you to decide the venue. Do you need a large open space or would an indoor venue be more preferable? Should it be a regular hall or would you like to have a different type of venue? You can rent out a space in a restaurant or even have it at an amusement park if you are looking for something different.     One you have decided the venue, you need to plan the theme of the party. Use this as an occasion to get really creative! How about a costume party? This works well with most teens. You can even have Hollywood as a theme. Teens often have Hollywood stars as idols therefore, everybody would enjoy dressing up for the same. Rock n roll is yet another popular theme. If you wish to add some color to the party, a Hawaiian theme is ideal. Colorful sarongs and loads of flowers are bound to add the right touch to the party.     While planning for the 16th birthday party, you also need to plan the activities! Girls would love the idea of a makeover and you can involve some adults who can help you with the same. If there is a particular theme for the party, you can even give away a prize for the best costume. Guys would love some sporty activity for the party. You can have a talent show where in young teens can either dance or sing to show their talent.     Well, to complete any party, food is of utmost importance. Plan a special shape for the cake. Snacks can be varied and light if its an early evening party. Pizzas are bound to please everybody but it you are looking for something else, you can have the option of sandwiches, delicious pretzels, crackers, fruit salads etc. Loads of chocolate can follow later! Food can also be thematic depending upon the mood you have decided for the party. If the theme is Hawaiian, you can plan the dishes accordingly and also serve it differently. You can add some unique type of dishes if the theme is Hollywood. Ensure you do not really experiment too much because the teens may not really be accustomed to gorging on various types of cuisines.     Use these 16th birthday party ideas to plan a party that really rocks for your child! Your kid is bound to cherish these memories forever!|`|NaRTybOYaa	How about a spa day with your best friends...or a house party with a dj.|`|4LvtYgvRaa	go to the cinema and then to a restaurant.|`|mqcVaxMvaa	reading lessons?|`|uCB3VHv5aa	Find out what she is into...like maybe a game you have or something. and Use that as a theme...have a surprise party with a bunch of her friends where she has no idea...scavenger hunts...pizza or if she doesn't like pizza a pasta party where you pick your own toppings...|`|AA10685337	Have sex. 3 times.|`|LongdduNaa	let the girls choose !!!!  no controllie!!!!  go wild girls wowowowoowowoowp

eg71zQ5Raa	Totally wrong.  The vast majority of good (i.e. trained) fighters are anything but bullies.  They know that if necessary they can "do the business" but are probably some of the calmest people around.    Bullies tend to be the otherway around - they are not "good" fighters and if people stand up to them then they will back down or probably take a beating.|`|baQpo0kdaa	disagree|`|om9PLGecaa	disagree   i can handle myself if push comes to shove   i was never a bully   i used to stick up for the kids who got picked on   even if i was with a m8 which was picking on them   i have a mean right hook though|`|EYqTV2EYaa	Actually, I agree because in school, when I saw bullies go to work, they typically knew what they were doing, whether during intimidation or actual fighting. Also, I doubt someone would even have the courage to bully if they knew they weren't good fighters. For example, in my case, I can't imagine myself bullying anyone because I can't fight for crap, and I would possible get beaten by the person I'm trying to intimidate. That would be VERY embarrassing and naturally, humans don't want to be in uncomfortable situations. (Don't get me wrong, even if I could, I still wouldn't bully.)|`|HvIS1Mk1aa	Disagree.    You'll never see a bully picking at anybody who can give them a good pasting; they single out those who can't fight back well enough to put a stop to it.    Bullies are always better fighters than their victims, but that doesn't make them good fighters.|`|qky7gWosaa	Disagree.    Bullies are cowards.

Since the environment is constantly changing, evolution is never ending.|`|zfRwAc5uaa	human evolution  From: The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition | Date: 2008 | The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition. Copyright 2008 Columbia University Press. (Hide copyright information) Copyright information    human evolution theory of the origins of the human species, Homo sapiens.     it says theory,not fact    Hominid Evolution    The earliest known hominids are members of the genus Australopithecus , the earliest of which date to more than 4 million years ago. Unlike other primates, but like all hominids, australopithecines were bipedal. Their crania, however, were small and apelike, with an average cranial capacity of about 450 cc in the gracile species and 600 cc in the robust forms. Australopithecines that have been considered ancestral in the lineage leading to the human genus Homo include A. afarensis (an important skeleton of which is popularly known as Lucy) and A. africanus. The exact position of these and other early species on the hominid family tree continues to be disputed.    The first member of the genus Homo, a small gracile species known as H. habilis, was present in east Africa at least 2 million years ago. H. habilis was the first hominid to exhibit the marked expansion of the brain (with an average cranial capacity of about 750 cc) that would become a hallmark of subsequent hominid evolutionary history. By about 1.6 million years ago, H. habilis had evolved into a larger, more robust, and larger-brained species known as Homo erectus . Cranial capacities ranged from about 900 cc in early specimens to 1050 cc in later ones. H. erectus persisted for well over a million years and migrated off the African continent into Asia, Indonesia, and Europe.    Between 500,000 and 250,000 years ago, H. erectus evolved into H. sapiens. Transitional forms between H. erectus and H. sapiens are referred to as archaic H. sapiens. With the exception of H. sapiens neandertalensis (see Neanderthal man ), no additional subspecies are recognized. Indeed, some scientists consider Neanderthal a separate species. Archaic H. sapiens changed gradually, becoming somewhat larger, more gracile and larger-brained through time. Cranial capacity, for example, increased from about 1150 cc in early transitional forms to the current world average of just over 1350 cc. By 150,000 years ago in Africa and Asia and 28,000 years ago in Europe (see Cro-Magnon man ), the transition to H. sapiens was complete, and fully modern humans became the single surviving hominid species.    yes if the theory is accurate,then we are.|`|EzqX9ojdaa	It's true that we aren't evolving further.

Just because we don't hunt or forage for our food anymore, for the most part, doesn't mean we aren't put under other pressures, that we'll have to stretch, and grow, and evolve from.

So no, I don't consider the present incarnation of homo sapien to be the end of evolution.|`|23kap6Feaa	not really no    it took billions of years for a single celled organism to humans to get where we are now, i think it would take at least a couple million years to evolve into something greater|`|7bbfUYUOaa	Unless things change drastically, I don't think we'll be evolving anymore.  Like you said, we kinda ruled out the natural selection (not entirely, but well enough) thing.  If anything, we'll evolve of our own scientific choice (by implementing machinery... I know, all sci-fi right?).  Of course, I have no scientific backing for this and have thought about your question all of two seconds before I answered it.  It would be cool though.|`|WF085j2Daa	You need to study the theory a little deeper there is nothing to indicate that humans are the pinnacle of anything and as for evolution it never stops|`|U24VtSlZaa	Hey, maybe Yao Ming is evidence to the contrary.|`|lh8Tn02Naa	One of the natural constraints on our evolutionary progress is the size of a woman's birth canal, which in turn restricts brain size.    However, some scary technologists reckon they will in time be able to replace bits of the brain with electronic components, which will function more efficiently and never wear out.    Extrapolating from this, we may eventually be able to construct super-brains.  This leads to an absolutely wonderful piece of speculation: what would you do with a super-brain?  Well, you would create or maybe just simulate a universe.  Its intelligent inhabitants would not know they had come into existence in this way ... so how do we know this has not already happened?    I think it was Britain's astronomer Royal who came up with this one, and I love it.|`|RrVr9Bwfaa	Natural selection isn't evolution, it's ONE of the process by which evolution occurs.

You are not following the Lords example and instead have chosen to alter yourself.  This is not meant to hurt your feelings, but is the truth.    God intended for you to be a man, from birth to death.  He intended for you to marry and be a strong Husband and father children.  As a Dad you were to teach your children and make them strong as well and to live according to the Laws of God.    God has said in the Bible, be careful of "Decievers" and this is exactly what you have become.  I am not condeming you, but I am saying what is evident to all.  It is sad that you would knowingly give up a God Appointed position.....for something else.  You have given up the Stature of being a man, you have given up Husbandry, you have given up Fatherhood and the esteem to be a "Dad".

His prayers were answered after only one visit from a mechanic!  It was a true miracle.  However if you happen to be a christian in a concentration camp and you pray for your life, invariably god seems unable to come up with the goods.  It's also interesting to note that whilst there is anecdotal evidence that he has cured thousands of people all over the world, there isn't a single recorded case of an amputee getting their limb back.  I therefore suspect that you forget praying to him for help getting pregnant but you might get a response if you need help getting your vibrator to work.  Especially if he sends you a sign to remind you that there are spare batteries in the kitchen drawer!

She said she doesn't know what to do when the older girl kisses her. If she isn't into a same sex relationship------ walk away.  Truthfully it doesn't sound like a healthy relationship -- mostly because of the young ages involved. Why is the 18 yr old living on her own? Why would a 16 year old be working and now worrying about money for school. I am rather confused.   The older girl's  behavior about demanding all of her gf's time is normal for a young new relationship but it can become obsessive and unhealthy. It might be a good time for you and your friends to grab her up for lunch or something and talk to her about what's going on. At 16 she should still be in high school, living with her folks, without so many worries- whether she is gay or not.   If her parents are freaked out because of their daughter being gay, check out PFLAG.ORG and get some info from them. IT WILL HELP!!  PS.....of course they sleep in the same bed. Where did you think they would sleep?|`|wEFiPb6waa	wow i almost don't know what to says that's quiet a situation, well if i were u I'll try to get my ex friend back to friends  and go from there if u know what i mean? u k as the good friend you are, talk her out of that mess she into with the lesbo'     hope this helped:)

ovjYVpvWaa	Do you have single-lidded eyes? Just asking. Most of the Koreans at my school seem to have slitty eyes.   Otherwise Chinese and Koreans along with Japanese tend to be hard to tell apart. Although I think I've seen more Chinese with rounder eyes and less squarish face than Koreans.    Oh there is one other trait that makes Koreans very distinctive. That's their smell. Not to be offensive, but that Kimchi they eat really lingers in the elevators. Then you know it was a Korean.    On that note, maybe when someone thinks you're Korean, ask them if it's because they think you smell like kimchi? : P    Cheers!|`|xpiGWrdMaa	dim sum is really good|`|9XA7KxK5aa	I think you are just too sensitive.

FG248uVsaa	In a single word, yes. Sexuality, whether gay, straight, bisexual, transgender, etc, etc,  is not connected to religious beliefs, cultural background, wealth, or any factors you may wish to apply to it. There are groups specifically for Gay Christians, Gay Hindus and Gay Muslims.    Some cultures, groups and cultures will deny its existence or view it as an aberration. For the most part though, sexuality is universal. Many people are perfectly happy and secure in their sexuality without feeling the need to question it or explore/experiment. Many people aren't. Some say that sexuality is not a life choice, but simply how you are. I'd disagree, as some people successfully convince themselves otherwise because of their beliefs or cultural upbringing, and may feel quite happy in themselves without feeling the need to explore it.    There's a lot that could be written in response to this question, but the simple answer, in a word, is yes.|`|i4Vt4YJ4aa	Anyone can be whatever they wanna be, whether rich, poor etc...|`|accdd753250739a255f532616b8c6cdfaa	I don''t know how to take your question, is it serious or are you just sort of joking around at others expense.  Why do you ask a question like that, is it something you really want to know and really don't know, or is it just something to write in the grand scheme of life.  To answer you as if this is a real question, of course anyone anywhere could turn out to be gay.  There are no rules and regulations set up as to who is born gay, it just happens.  Nobody knows why, it hasn''t been figured out yet why some people are born straight and some born gay, it just happens.  Rich man, poor man, beggar man, thief, they can all be gay.  I doubt a Muslim would come out of the closet, I don't know enough about Hindu, Christians certainly do, many of them priests.  Did you know that it was illegal to be gay in England up until 1966?  if you were caught doing something you shouldn''t be doing you ended up in Jail.  In fact Sir Alec Guinness was arrested for such a thing and had problems with his career.  It was why he did Star Wars, he needed the money, he knew nothing about the property, but was somehow sure it would make money and was the only one who took a percent of the gross of the movie from Lucas as well as a salary.  He was married throughout his life, and as is said quite happily, but very gay and in the closet until the laws changed and it was certainly hard on a lot of actors.  And as you said in Britain there are a lot of gays and they all seem to be on TV.  But more and more in the US our actors are coming out of the closet and it isn't effecting them and their careers, and we do have the not so great ""don''t ask don't tell" in the military.|`|UDr6FD2Zaa	Any one can be gay.

IYe1TTwYaa	They also do not follow his teachings despite the fact that they call him a Prophet.|`|h56ccHJGaa	Jesus was a prophet. God is perfect, therefore needs no successor/son, etc. Muslims don't believe Jesus ever died, but that Judas died on the cross after God changed him to look like Jesus. Jesus is said to come back. The Jews wanted Jesus dead because he called himself the prophet, they slenderized his name calling him a basterd, and well you get the picture.|`|Z9WBVWhqaa	I don't get it....why would god in any form human or whatever die for our sins.

He is alive and will be back. when jews wanted Him dead, and "not" for calling Himself son of God but for showing them the true path to God as the jews called Ezra the son of God, God did not let Jesus to be killed. as the jews assembled outside His place to crucify Him, He was taken up by God. God took Him away from there by removing Him from the place and raised him to the fourth heaven. then God placed His resemblance on a devil who was crucified in Jesus's place. Jesus is alive and will be back to fight the "dajjal" or what u call "antichrist".|`|UmdKqP5kaa	Ok, we know we don't create each other and we don't come to this world from nowhere because when we die we must be going somewhere as well, hence there must be God, if there were many Gods, they would have fought over what to be created and what not to be, probably over who to die and who to live at the same time... so it's gotta be one God... if that God created us then there must be a reason... could we figure it out on our own? God made it easy and sent us messengers and prophets to show us the way and tell us why... so all the messengers and all the religions are from the same only God, so they've got to be complementary to each other, not opposing each other!!! then God must have said His final words in the last message, what is the last message? and how do we know it's the last one? I guess that would be the religion that believes in all messengers and all books equally... is there such religion? actually yes, Islam does :)  A True Muslim (man or woman) gets his reward for obeying Allah's orders (Allah means The God in Arabic) by going to heaven, where he/she are indulged forever in all the good thing s that were on earth and more, things no one ever dreamt of or heard about. The Holy Quran tells Muslims (men and women) there will be good food, good wine and sex in heaven for all, but not in the bestial way you may think of, but rather in a way that is satisfactory for everyone and better than what was on earth. Heaven is no heartbreak or injustice land.  True Muslims are no terrorists, and Islam never calls for that, Islam means peace, it bans violence unless you were fought so you fight back, it only doesn't require Muslims to be cowards, and true Muslims understands this very well and never attack civilians.   Islam is the only religion that accepts freedom of religion and asks men to treat women gently like queens.  Muslims don't deny Jesus, they believe in him, love him and respect him so much.  We believe Jesus is NOT dead till today; he wasnt murdered or crucified as most people think. God made the man who betrayed Jesus be killed instead by switching their looks for a moment. Jesus was left up to live in heaven until the end of days when he will come back to earth, make justice prevail instead of oppression, fight the imposter and perform his last prayer before he really dies like other Prophets. So we're waiting for you Jesus, Messenger of God, to bring the world peace and pray with us. Thats what prophet Muhammad told us and this is what I believe in, Im a Muslim  so how do we know it's true? what is said in the last message and what should we do? read the following, and you'll figure out for yourself:|`|xhE79ycEaa	Jesus is one of God's Prophets.     Yes, he was born without father. But certainly not God's biological son.  God's will, He could do anything. Adam also was created without biological parents. Adam & Jesus are not the sons of God.    Noble Quran, stated that there is NONE in this world & universe have any similarities to God.     No, Jesus did not die for our sins. We are responsible for our sins.|`|waz8ONEEaa	the torah specifically states that their god would never take a physical form. their god was never, is never, and will never be a man.     the old testament is just a overly edited, plagiarized form of the torah, with anything the christians didn't like, or need (aka, the prophesies unfulfilled by jesus, and the fact that all messiah prophesies had to be completed in a single lifetime) or would blow holes in their religion.    the muslims saw him for what he was. a good man/prophet. but not allah in the flesh.

xxEhpytpaa	No He wasn't mistaken, you must keep in mind, that His time is not our time as we know it. When Jesus decides to return, He will return when He wants and not one minute sooner. And when He does return, He will descend the way He ascended, the sky will roll back and He will appear with all the Angels and Saints by His side. Awesome! God bless you.|`|lh8Tn02Naa	Yes.

The Greek word translated kingdom can also be translated royal splendor, meaning that the three disciples standing there would see Christ as He really isthe King of heavenwhich occurred in the transfiguration.    Verse 27 warns of the second coming of Christ. Verse 28 speaks of the Transfiguration. Read them separately as they are two different things. Some translations do not say "Truly" but "And I assure you that some of you standing..." They are two separate promises from our Lord.   As for Mark 13:30 theologians have many different views on the subject but the most common and accepted is that Jesus was not speaking of a generation as in the people his own age that were present but speaking of race or tribe, thus despite wars that would come the race or tribe of Judah would remain until all prophecy was fulfilled. Jesus would not have meant "this generation" with the meaning of the people standing there and then tell them that the hour is not known.|`|hQDapmICaa	Jesus was referring to 2 events, one which would take place while the generation which lived in HIS time lived and another referring to HIS second coming and the people of that generation.    The first even took place as HE predicted about 70 A.D. :    Luk 21:24  And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led away captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled.

Matt 16:28 Jesus is the Son of Man and He ascended to Heaven before their eyes before Pentecost Day, as for the rest Israel still had to fall, not one brick upon another of the temple(70 A.D.) and be rebuilt(Parable of the Fig Tree) Israel came back in the 50's, and one generation is 70 years, which means we are still waiting for the 6th seal, 6th trump, and the 6th censer to come (666) antiChrist, and then Jesus will return in the 7th seal, 7th Trump, and the 7th Censer, lets not get too anxious, let's just live every day for Christ, then we don't have to worry ourselves with Doomsday Prophecies.  as for what you said to Sinner and Warrior you are mistaken Jesus said only the Father knows that day, and it will be when no one expects it to be, like a thief in the night, so if anyone says it will be a certain day the Bible says it will definately not be that day, for no one will know.  Anyone that prophesizes about this is in false doctrine simple and plain.  In fact if they continue to spew out days, they might be prolonging the day actually coming, for in that day one will be taken and the other left behind, etc. it is all written, and no where does it say someone will know before it comes, so when anyone tells you when it is,  they are liars, and are not to be trusted.
NlQhkgFCaa	Salaam Brother     Good points, the following link also supplements what you say   http://www.miraclesofthequran.com     Salaam|`|37LKDbtsaa	Appeal to authorities: An overused fallacy.|`|WbaN6osZaa	They made a lot of money from Islamic book deals?    Let me know when you can find a few hundred biologists and geologists who will show peer reviewed papers stating that  the Quran unambiguously demonstrates any scientific fact that was unknown anywhere else in the world at the time of the Quran being written.    I can state it no plainer than this fellow:    "If the Quran is scientific then why not Kama Sutra (Sanskrit treatise to love making) scientific too?  Why not the Bhagabat Geeta, Monus Sanghita, the Vedas and the Mahabharata scientific?  If the Hindus could generate billions of petro-dollar they can surely employ many western professors to do just that.  When I was in high school, I had a devout Hindu teacher. He always used to say that Hinduism is the basis of all science. How?  He used to give examples of the mention of Vimana (air craft), Garuda (probably flying saucer or space ship), Trishul Chakra (probably rotary space station), Agni Baan (ballistic missiles), etc., to prove that the Hindus knew how to make those things, which are very common in to-days world.  'Do not these examples prove that Hinduism is more scientific than any other religion?' he used to say.  We just used to nod our head in agreement.  That was just to please him and to ensure a good mark in his subject.  Dr. Bucille is there to please the Arabs, the Islamists and to make money; tons of it.  He also employs another tactic. He declares that his own faith (Catholic Christianity) is not as scientific as Islam is.  What a great news for our new Mullahs!  There can be no news sweeter than this, no news happier than this, no news more pleasant than this.  Nonetheless, he actually fools the Islamists by throwing dust in their eyes. Never does he covert to Islam.  But Mullahs are too docile and cretinous not to see his stratagem.  How sad!"    http://www.faithfreedom.org/Articles/abu...    Keith Moore?  Same article:    Dr. Keith Moore    Another great sanctuary for the Islamists and the new Mullahs is the embryologist Dr. Keith Moore.  He was the former President of the Canadian Association of Anatomists and professor Emeritus, Department of anatomy and cell biology, University of Toronto.  When he was offered a faculty position in King Abdul Aziz University, right away he smelled the sweet scent of petro-dollars and plenty of it in Saudi Arabia. He worked with the embryology committee of the King Abdul Aziz University in Jeddah. His job was to interpret the many statements in the Quran and Sunnah referring to the human reproduction and prenatal development. One wonders why the Saudi Government has to employ an infidel to interpret the Quran when there are no shortages of Islamic scholars for this job. Why did not the Saudis have qualified people from the 'Islamic brother' countries?  How come the Saudis cannot trust the interpretation of the Quran from their 'brothers'?  The answer lies in the fact that the Arabs practice overt and covert form of racism (call it Islamic racism if you would like).  Any dark skinned people who have worked in the Arab countries will attest to this fact.  There are separate pay structures and perks for the whites and the dark skinned people in most Arab countries.  A statement from a dark skinned people no matter how much education and knowledge he or she does have is not acceptable to the Arabs.  Whereas, a sworn statement by a western white skinned person with a very little expertise is totally acceptable to them.  As you know, bulks of American Muslims are blacks.  However, the Arabs will seldom employ a black American to do the job of Dr. Keith Moore even though the Black American may be as competitive as a white American.  The white population knows this craving by the Arabs for white recognition.  And they take full advantage of this weakness of the Arabs to make more money out of them.  Any way, let us hear what Dr. Keith Moore had to say to please his paymaster.  At a conference in Cairo, he presented a research paper and stated:     "It has been a great pleasure for me to help clarify statements in the Quran about human development. It is clear to me that these statements must have come to Muhammad from God, or Allah, because most of this knowledge was not discovered until many centuries later.  This proves to me that Muhammad must have been a messenger of God or Allah".      Bravo!  What could be a better statement than this from an infidel to please the Islamists! Notice that he never mentioned whether the statements in the Quran are scientific or not. He simply stated what the Islamists wanted to hear, took his money and went home.  He never converted to Islam.  He just fooled the ever-gullible Islamists and the new Mullahs and laughed all his way to the bank. In the West, they say that a sucker is born every minute.  I have to say that as long as Islamists are there they will produce gullible folks ad infinitum and in turn these new simpletons would be taken for a ride by the clever ones such as Maurice Bucille and Keith Moore.

False logic so bad question.|`|HDyqzvUkaa	As one who is labeled an Atheists, i do the same, consult me heart.    If the eternal right of your God exists in everything, then it exists within me as well.     I become more and more frustrated with the notion that spirituality is synonymous with morality and that believing in a god means you know better of right and wrong.        Although we will all search for guidance,  one must know God even when deserted from the books of our forefathers.  To see God with only your eyes and not through the eyes of another man.      EDIT: just wanted to point out how ignorant it is to believe that the Religious "Get of the Hook"  yes, religious without consciences (sociopaths, i.e. 1/25 america) won't think twice about their mistake. Those people are merely superstitious.  Most people who dedicate their life to God are constantly aware of their sins, which weigh much more heavily because they believe in an immortal soul.  it is an obvious shame to have to tell another man your sins  Catholics are big confessors....have you ever heard of Catholic Guilt.|`|O9omaIDAaa	If I do something intentionally, then it is not a moral *mistake*.

If I continue with that action, knowing it to be wrong, then I have got a damn good reason.    Unwise, perhaps    A mistake, no.|`|7nO4pgIiaa	Your quote lead to doctrinal relativism.

pNww5UC0aa	I just pray by talking to Him. Not necessary to recite prayers and verses like a parrot because I don't understand what I'm saying and it's not beneficial to grow like that. I need to strengthen my relationship with Him. It needs to go up.    I pray to Him ALL the time.    I don't watch people pray. I pray myself to the Heavenly Father.    I kneel. I thank Him for so many specific things. I ask Him to forgive me for specific sins I did during the day so I won't do them again.    It all by His grace. He is in the midst of my prayers all the time. :)|`|eO2rnf7yaa	My most frequent prayer is to thank God for letting me be alive.  I also regularly apologize for my sins and ask for forgiveness and for help from The Holy Spirit to guide me in all my ways.  I do pray in times of distress, and perhaps I should do this more regularly, but mostly I thank God for what I have, and I thank Him especially for the salvation and mercy of Jesus Christ.  I'm praying for you as I write this.  Peace be with you.|`|A90SRsTxaa	I pray mostly when I feel called to do so. Often times I have dreams about people I know having struggles. I then pray for these people. When I talk to them later I find that they were indeed having difficulties that were not just similar but right on the money. This is how I know that God is very real. Pretty often I will pray after watching the news for the people of the world. I only pray for myself when in great distress.|`|2RKPtuL9aa	I pray to God continuously within the day and daily with praise and worship and I also pray 3 times a day like Daniel did, I base my prayers as The Lords prayer, first I come before His throne of Grace humbly and in praise and worship then I repent of all sins as I forgive anyone who has ever sinned against me, then I make my requests known to God and remind Him of any past requests I have made in the past, then I ask not to be lead into temptation, then I ask to be delivered from satan, then I pray for friends, family and neighbors ect..ect...ect...|`|f364d0719c244ddc3a65d736558b8fb2aa	Prayer is more than a 'formal' plea to the Lord in times of distress. For me, it is an active decision to have a one-on-one conversation with the Lord. At times it may be a request that I have to ask of the Lord and at other times I may cry out to the Lord in times of confusion and doubt and at other times I cry holy and give thanks to the Lord for His amazing love and provision. Just like with a relationship with any other person there are different levels of 'trust' and conversation.
AA11749193	Hey Dream-Maker- Sometimes I do this. When a loved one passes on, I look at the sky and see if there is a new star up there that represents them.

Unfortunately for them many of the "facts" they wrote down as supposedly the word of god have since been revealed as being wrong.

"Salle de Bains" (french) is much more exotic than instructing my child to go to the potty room.    This is R&S, so,   "33 The human person: with his openness to truth and beauty, his sense of moral goodness, his freedom and the voice of his conscience, with his longings for the infinite and for happiness, man questions himself about God's existence. In all this he discerns signs of his spiritual soul. The soul, the "seed of eternity we bear in ourselves, irreducible to the merely material",9 can have its origin only in God. "    Belief in God is intrinsic. My Priest says that to the argument is man inherently good or evil. Man is a "sinner" but desires to do good! So, Man is inherently good.
isxNUJlZaa	1. In what the Bible tells us, Jesus took a lot of stances in ancient Rome that would be considered social protest. Lepers, for example, were traditionally kept outside city limits, in fear that their disease would infect the rest of the population. Jesus not only talked to these people, but helped them, which is very forward thinking in a society that tells you these people are worthless. He also embraced tax collectors as his disciples: people who were traditionally hated and seen as arms of the greedy Roman Empire.     There may be no historical record that specifically said Jesus did this and that, but from a Biblical understanding, yes, Jesus was a social protester whose own thinking deviated outside of the traditional Jewish beliefs.    2. Jesus must be given at least some credit to discovering Christianity. Without his preaching, people wouldn't have caught onto his ideas or thought they were worth spreading. You are right, however, in ascertaining that he did not "found" Christianity, as he never once said, "Bow down and worship me now, please." He told St. Peter to continue his work, and St. Peter is often regarded as the "rock" of the Christian church ("rock" here meaning "cornerstone" or "foundation"), so saying that St. Peter actually founded Christianity is a solid statement.    3. Jesus' first appearance (in the New Testament) is as a baby in the manger. If he has been to earth before, we have not known it. If, as Christians believe, he returns to earth, then yes, he would be considered a bodhisattva. But until he does, he's still hanging out in heaven, and hasn't come back to save people and help them.    This is, however, being literal. If you want to be broader, you could say that the men and women who dedicate their lives to the Church could be those bodhisattvas, considering that they help people rekindle their faith and serve as spiritual guides.    Hope that helps!|`|qXmAOyXiaa	jesus maybe considered as a heretic jew.surely he was not the only saviour or only god.god is 1 and that is nature-adi shakti param  prakruti parambrham paramatma.all gods and goddesses r aspects of the same nature.we r also part of god=nature.|`|xZet9Dunaa	Jesus Christ was the founded the Catholic Church.

There are a lot more chapters and verses mentioned in the below website along with music, speeches and praise and worship.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    Jesus is God. He is alive forever.    The questions usually asked are:-    1) Did Jesus really exist?  2) Is Jesus God?  3) If Jesus is God, then why did He keep praying to the Father in Heaven? How can the Father and Jesus be one God? Why did Jesus have to suffer on the Cross?  4) What is the Holy Spirit?  5) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?      It would not be possible to give a short answer to these questions .    I suggest you visit the below website.    After visiting the below website, you would get a lot of answers.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus  specifically.)  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became  flesh (John 1:1-14)  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as  "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT  (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)  16. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) and "God" also be called the  Mighty God in Isaiah 10:21  17. Jesus is able to raise Himself from the dead (John 2:19-21)  18. Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things  by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship  is used in each place.)  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts  7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father  that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John  8:58.  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see  Exodus 3:14.  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).  26. Jesus is the One who will judge you on judgement day (John 5:22-23). Only God can be the judge.  27. Jesus forgives sins (Luke 5:20) (Luke 24:47,Acts 10:43) .Only God can forgive sins.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com|`|AA11440601	1. Jesus did talk about social issues but this was not his primary purpose. He fully intended to create a new religion.    Matthew 16:17-19 states:    Jesus said to him in reply, "Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah. For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my heavenly Father. And so I say to you, you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church, and the gates of the netherworld shall not prevail against it. I will give you the keys to the kingdom of heaven. Whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven."     2. Yes, Jesus Christ founded Christianity. Peter was just the first leader of the Church after Jesus rose to heaven.    3. I do not know enough about Buddhism to answer this question.    With love in Christ.|`|fOfJz9OMaa	1. Jesus is the Son of God, who God raised from the dead, who is now on the right hand of God in heaven, until His enemies are under His footstool.  2.  Peter was an apostle of Christ; the tradition of the catholics is irrelevant to scriptures.  3.  We which do believe in the true and living God have learned to not think above that which is written, so that we will not exaggerate or over-estimate any matters.|`|OT4SrmDXaa	Jesus is the son of God. He told his disciples to preach the Gospel. Christians are followers of Christ. The disciples are just the first followers of the Christ once he revealed himself to man.     Peter is not the first Pope. Peter was Married. The Pope cannot marry.  The Apostle Paul was not married he was to busy serving God and he did not need a spouse the same way many man cannot handle living without. If the Catholics wanted to call soemone there Pope it would have made more sence to say Paul was the first Pope.    They call Peter the first Pope for one Reason. Because Jesus said you are the rock on which I will build my church. The Catholics say they are Christ's Church and Peter Was the Rock Christ built it on. Which is not true. God was saying the faith Peter had would flock others to want to have boldnessness as Christ made him the leader of his Church. The church has nothing to do with buildingreligiousgous services. Its scatteredered believers through the world that refuse to follow the lord of this world (Satan)    Thats why the bible says we are in this world but not of it.    The Catholic Church is Paganism mixed with Christianity. Don't confuse Jesus with the Teachings of the Catholic Church.|`|8465ed09a7111e9ef73563fd6ed0ec22aa	1)  "This catechism is conceived as an organic presentation of the Catholic faith in its entirety. It should be seen as a unified whole." ( 18)    Part One:   The Profession of Faith  "The Implications of the Faith in the One God":              o "It means knowing the unity and true dignity of all men (people): Everyone is made in the image and likeness of God." (Genesis 1:26) ( 225)            o "... The human race forms a unity" ( 360)            o "'law of human solidarity and charity'" ( 361)    Original Sin "gives rise to serious errors in the areas of education, politics, social action, and morals." ( 407)    "Sin of the world" can "also refer to the negative influence exerted on people by communal situations and social structures that are the fruit of men's sins." ( 408)    Jesus is "our model," "the perfect man (human)." ( 520)  "Jesus identifies himself with the poor of every kind and makes active love toward them the condition for entering his kingdom." ( 544)    "By reason of their special vocation it belongs to the laity to seek the kingdom of God by engaging in temporal affairs and directing them according to God's will...." ( 898)              o "The initiative of lay Christians is necessary especially... for permeating social, political, and economic realities with the demands of Christian doctrine and life." ( 899)              o "Far from diminishing our concern to develop this earth, the expectancy of a new earth should spur us on, for it is here that the body of a new human family grown, foreshadowing in some way the age which is to come. That is why, although we must be careful to distinguish earthly progress clearly from the increase of the Kingdom of Christ, such progress is of vital concern to the kingdom of God, insofar as it can contribute to the better ordering of human society." ( 1049)    2)   Matt. 28:1; Mark 16:2,9; John 20:1,19- the Gospel writers purposely reveal Jesus' resurrection and appearances were on Sunday. This is because Sunday had now become the most important day in the life of the Church.    Acts 20:7 - this text shows the apostolic tradition of gathering together to celebrate the Eucharist on Sunday, the "first day of the week." Luke documents the principle worship was on Sunday because this was one of the departures from the Jewish form of worship.     Heb. 7:12 - when there is a change in the priesthood, there is a change in the law as well. Because we have a new Priest and a new sacrifice, we also have a new day of worship, which is Sunday.    Jesus builds the Church.  Peter and the Apostles are the foundation on which Jesus builds his Church. Peter is the first among equals, not a dominating dictator.     3) Buddhism, in its various forms, realizes the radical insufficiency of this changeable world; it teaches a way by which men, in a devout and confident spirit, may be able either to acquire the state of perfect liberation, or attain, by their own efforts or through higher help, supreme illumination. Likewise, other religions found everywhere try to counter the restlessness of the human heart, each in its own manner, by proposing "ways," comprising teachings, rules of life, and sacred rites. The Catholic Church rejects nothing that is true and holy in these religions. She regards with sincere reverence those ways of conduct and of life, those precepts and teachings which, though differing in many aspects from the ones she holds and sets forth, nonetheless often reflect a ray of that Truth which enlightens all men. Indeed, she proclaims, and ever must proclaim Christ "the way, the truth, and the life" (John 14:6), in whom men may find the fullness of religious life, in whom God has reconciled all things to Himself.(4)    The Church, therefore, exhorts her sons, that through dialogue and collaboration with the followers of other religions, carried out with prudence and love and in witness to the Christian faith and life, they recognize, preserve and promote the good things, spiritual and moral, as well as the socio-cultural values found among these men.   http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_counc...|`|1GCLKkpTaa	Johnlemartirao, get your fundamentals straight about Buddhism and Jainism. From where you got the fantastic notion that Mahavira and Buddha were simply social protestors.wonderful.what imaginative and fertile thinking. Mahavira and Buddha were kings and if they had an axe to grind about social issues, they would have stayed as kings and got it implemented. You need much more motivation to leave your kingdom and family and undergo austerities than simple protests against social evils. They did not found any new religion. Jainism and Buddhism are continuation of very ancient sramana dharma, which is much more ancient than vedic religion. Evidence exists of 23 tirthankaras (spiritual teachers or gods) before Mahavira. Buddhists traditions also speaks of sramana teachers before Buddha.

5HcnqxKQaa	Can you leave her a box outside (put a towel inside) to give birth in? If so, try to make sure the box is big enough for her and her kittens. Do not move it till the kittens are bigger and can run around.    But yes, she should have no problems by herself. You just have to provide water and food nearby. Take note that after giving birth, if she doesn't feel safe, she will move the kittens to another spot.    If that happens, don't worry too much. Cats still have some wild instinct left and she can take care of herself.    By the way, when you say new cat, do you mean she was a stray cat?

I have had the same problem for 20 years.  My friend was there for me when I came out and has been there for every major hiccup in my life and likewise I for him.  When we are together I long to take him in my arms and hold him.  I've dreamed that someday my love would be reciprocated, but you know what, he's straight and that's all there is to it.     There are a lot of questions on this site about is being gay a question of choice.  The simple answer is no.  He is NEVER gonna be able to feel for you what you feel for him.    So I'm afraid you have a choice.  You either push your feelings aside and continue to enjoy your friendship or you lose them completely.      If you think your friendship is strong enough you can tell them exactly how you feel and see what reaction you get.  More than anything sexuality defines who we are and challenging this can get very ugly especially in young men.      My advice would be tread very carefully here.  Straight men no matter who they are are tolerant only to a point with gay men.  How far that point moves varies greatly but it WILL have a limit.      I made my choice and felt that my friendship with my mate was too important to destroy.  But I have come close to ruining it many times, especially when I'm drunk.  My mate knows exactly how I feel about him and is flattered in a strange way but I know not to push the issue too far.    I do feel for you in your predicament but someday you will meet someone who will/can love you as much as you love them.  Then you will have the best of both worlds, you'll keep your best mate and you'll also have a good lover.      As for the way you treat him that is classically you taking out your feelings of resentment on him.  It can be very frustrating when you have so much affection for someone and they don't give any back.      Admit it you want more than hugs from this guy and you feel angry that he is not giving you what you want.  When you set him up on dates with these girls does it make you feel jealous but you do it because you need to be nice to him.      I know I've been there and these are the feelings that you need to push aside.  BUT only do this if you think that you can cope with it because it is very hard to do and has to be worth the effort.    I wish I had better advice for you.
lfnjwpu1aa	Actually the media has started using larger women in some of their commercials so that they can appeal to a broader audience of people.  Not everyone is a size 4, but yes they do play up the glamor, makeup, life style, jewelry and cars.  But the people portrayed are not 9-5 ordinary people like we are.  Today's teenagers, will be tomorrow young adults and they are so much smarter, than to buy into all that garbage...(Ugly Betty) is setting a great example that you can be smart, nice and still achieve success.even within the confines of high tech fashion.....just my opinion...thank you|`|EYqTV2EYaa	In a way, yes. The media symbolizes, in my opinion, a fake view of beauty. Although as a cosmetologist, I'm all for fixing people up and making them look better from their command, but too much makeup to the point of looking different is unnatural; for an example, take a look at celebrities. They look so 'beautiful' on the screen, but when you look at videos of them without their makeup, people say they look 'ugly.' In fact, most people are so brainwashed by the media, they forget those stars are normal people like us, just wearing tons of makeup and getting mainstream exposure. Therefore, they're so used to seeing the fake makeup image until when it's removed, they didn't primarily see what they normally looked like, so they believe they're ugly. I bet, if they seen without the makeup beforehand, they'd be considered just as beautiful. I'm not against wearing makeup, don't get me wrong, but too much to the point of looking like a mannequin is pathetic. As for teenagers, they watch TV often and don't realize the 'media' or nothing more than normal people like us with their personal opinions. Therefore, they need to learn to develop their own opinions WITHOUT media help. As for fitting in, it's not all because of the media, but also peer pressure. In school, student that were influenced by the media to look pretty in a fake way could influence other girls, and therefore, creating even more 'symbolical beauty.' My advice is, be yourself, find things about yourself you find beauty and forget other people's negative opinions, thank positive opinions, and remember, makeup and flashy may look great, but self-confidence and determination to feel better about yourself is more attractive. Beauty is too good a thing to be wasted on a superficial image rather than a true image.|`|NaRTybOYaa	Yes, they do have that extra pressure.  I support my 12 year old daughter to be fit, but not to try to "fit-in".|`|AA10504008	Definitely. i have an "alternative" family structure that somehow manages to include at least one example of each of the major "types" of people. Despite all efforts to make sure my daughter understood that all we wanted her to be was herself she still managed to get it in her head that she had to pick a type to be like. Skinny or fat. Emo or preppy|`|514cc5e71bfeb7c07bd7f7603faaf9e5aa	yes devo|`|83lk0PSFaa	I don't understand why people always say things like 'today' and 'this generation'. There has been an obsession with the idealized body since the beginning of human kind. Look at the Greeks!  all their sculptures were of always of what a perfect person should look like. Wanting to look a certain way has existed for all people in all cultures. People always act like this is some recent epidemic, but its not. Humans (teenagers included ) are always going to want to reach the standard set by their society on how they should look, whether it is harmful or not. Its inevitable.   The celebrities and models in the media are just our 'Greek Sculptures' of the modern era that are the means in which we view societys physical expectations of us.|`|3OLmKB4waa	i know this is directed at females but i shall answer anyway =P  im a 16 yr old guy, and i do feel that they influence me but more of a role model. I see them and believe i can do it too. I also act because i want to be fit to be healthy and maintain self respect.|`|bZ27y1Qcaa	no
lfnjwpu1aa	No pressure here, but then I am not famous glamorous, or really very exciting....I just live my life by my rules, and the community and my employer, and the State and the Government, no pressure what so ever......thank you|`|EYqTV2EYaa	I already answered your other question similar to this one, so look at it for my answer. As for me however, if that's what you're asking, no the media has no influence on me. Various people and I consider me pretty, but even if they didn't, I wouldn't do something I refuse.
FXD0rHyzaa	well im not really a phychic but i tend to get a good feeling about wether relationships are going to end or not and i really wanted to answer this question to be honest i think your family is just trying to make rumors and allegations just to split you two up they obviously arent the type of people to give other people second chances and its great that your helping him with his new life     i really think he can benefit from you alot and be really happy if he is clean then thats good and trust him see how it goes give him a chance if he is genuine he will prove it and if you two are really ment to be together then there is nothing to worry about    just dont let the rest of your family get to you dont try to prove any thing to them either they are just creating problems that arent there  but also dont fall out with your familly either look at it from both points of view they are only being protective of a person they dont know who has a bad history they should ease off after a while of you too being together     i hope i helped =]|`|9T09iprPaa	its up to him to prove his value to your family, lets face it if you were the parent you would want the best for your daughter, daddies little girl is number one in my heart, it is every parents dream to have there daughter with somebody who can take over as the protector when they are ready to leave this earth, i must confess that i to would be worried to if my daughter linked up with somebody like your boyfriend, hopefully you can change him and he dosnt change you, a prime example is Amy Winehouse, look how she changed when she went with that chap of hers. thats exactly what your parents are worried about|`|gCP6uZOvaa	Give him a chance.

Mother Theresa had things in her heart and she followed her heart.Jesus said that of the evil deposit of a man's heart, evil things come to pass, and of the good deposits in a man's heart, good comes to pass, for out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks. Maybe you should first take very close note of the words you speak continually. Are they fear based or are they faith based.Fear comes by hearing the negative things from the world. Faith comes by hearing the great and prescious promises from God's word.|`|o1Lq2eikaa	yes do follow what religion teaches us. its hard, but then i try my best.

She basically  says as long as you respect their rules and know what you're doing, then it's a great place to be.

aYi8oEkJaa	hi Christina,  no need to apologize dear, it is good to ask questions =)    i converted to Islam for myself, not for anyone or anything.   it was not hard to decide. i just fell in love with Islam after learning it and being around other Muslims. i found a feeling of belonging, it felt like after wandering around, i finally found my home. i was not forced in any manner, it was my very own decision. i was never weak in my faith as a Christian but i never had logical answers which i found in Islam... it was never like i woke up one day and said " i am going to convert " rather i was slowly drawn to it.    my family doesn't know yet and i am not married. hopefully i will tell my parents soon and i will surely marry a Muslim guy.. Insha'Allah.    about that person that is saying bad... not all people are like that dear, not even half of them are like that! .. there are many many nice Muslims, you should just know that don't judge the religion by a handful of people rather judge it by the religion itself.    if you are planning to learn about Islam, let me warn you... there are many phoney sites and books out there ... choose reliable and true sites, we all are here in the Ramadan section to gladly help you identify the true ones and the fake ones.    Edit : you are most welcome =)|`|A5HPUGxraa	this is a brave decision to make .. i'm a female muslim and i do respect convert muslims because they did decide to be muslims themselves their islam is so true they may be better than a lot of muslims who are muslims since the minute they were born    here are some questions i answered before hope they can help     1- CONVERTING TO ISLAM ?  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...    2- How do i become Muslim?  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...    3- Why are so many Women converting to Islam?  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...    4- What is the difference between Muslim & Islam?http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...    5- Muslim reverts: Which part of Islam do you struggle with most?  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...    6- Is convert or die the muslim way, except for jews of course,?  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...    7- Why are so many Women converting to Islam?  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...    8- I want to learn more about Islam, can anyone tell me about it?http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...    i can also introduce you to some convert friends i have the honour to know some of them    i really hope i could help.. please feel free to contact me any time or even to add me i'll have the pleasure.. wish you the best of luck|`|8897ef26cacbd959d0b80f92cb194984aa	All you'll be is a badge of honour.  Be prepared to be subserveint, remember in Islam your husband will be allowed to "educate" you through physical punishment.  According to Islam it is not possible to rape your wife, so be prepared for that.  And also remember that if you ever split and wish to leave Islam, that in some places is punishable by death.  One final thought, if you have children, you as a mother will have no say or rights, especially if he takes them to a muslim country.  Think long and hard.  If he really loves you religion wouldn't matter, and he would have the guts to tell his family the same, or why doesn't he convert to Christianity, why do you have to be the one to make the life altering change.    Silly nieve girls.  FYI, I have lived and worked in Muslim countries for the past 15 years, and have many Arab and African friends.  I'm afraid that you are sadly mistaken if you think that the majority of muslims think women are on equal footing with men.  To the one o0n about the Kenyan who married the Christain woman, not only do I doubt that, if he did, he would be percieved as a very bad muslim and a sinner.  The point is not how many beat and rape their wives, the point is it happens and you have no recourse if it does.  Like I said, think long and hard.  If you want to convert to Islam, do it for you, not for man.|`|DO7lDtqxaa	I converted to Islam. I was curious. I had many,many questions.I wanted to understand why Muslim were different.  What is it that makes a Muslim more willingly obedient to God?      I thought, what did I have to fear as a strong Christian?So I found an English version of the Quran. I compared it with my Bible. I began to study the Quran. I realized that the questions I had as a Christian about life and religion became clear in Islam. After several months of study and soul searching I said Shahada.(Alhumdulilah)!    I was happy! Ecstatic! I told everyone. Maybe, I was naive in thinking they wouldn't care. They were all sure I had lost my mind.My family and friends said a lot of nonsense. "It is just a faze."  "It will pass.".... Not even close..I have been Muslimah for about three years now.(Alhumdulilah! ).     I did marry a very wonderful Muslim. Later after converting.|`|bs9Zbouaaa	I am a Muslim by born but it is the true and peacful religion.|`|HnX6qyuGaa	Well , I am muslim by choice , and thats for the following reasons that i found after study      islam is simplicity , clearness , direct teachings , and absolute uniqness of God , no embeded paganism or multi Gods.      1- The view of Jesus and Mary in islam:    the view of jesus in islam is the best and the most reasonable as In islam jesus is looked at as a moderate view between two extreme views , jews humiliate jesus and his mother , whereas christians worship jesus and raise him above humanity this thing jesus denied and refused .  in the bible there has been altering but still there can be find from the bible ,, sayings of jesus that makes us know the truth  let us take an example of jesus saying "My God" in the bible, one can find that in alot of places in the bible like :   >>  and:  >>   and in alot of other places ..   notice the word -Our God - that jesus said this means that we have a common God we and jesus, God means creator this means we r both created and raised by the same God,, we as well as jesus     jesus always admitted and declared with hight Voice that he worships Our God that is in the heaven and invited us to worship him how can he be God after that    we always see jesus saying (my God) and praying to him why don't we just worship the God of jesus , that is; the creator of jesus  its amazing how jesus used to call God : (My God) and (Our God ) many times in the bible ,  God is the one who creats and rises that means jesus always used to say :  (my creator).  which agrees with islam view of jesus as human prophet and no more than that.    Mary   also mary is considered in islam ,  as a very great woman and the  purest woman on earth , but not as mother of God !! whom he had made pregnant !! , nor his gf!      HolySpirit  the holy spirit is considered as the head of angels and he it is called gebrael , but its not a part of God nor any divine , he is just a creation of the One and Only true God that is in heaven .      2- Upon reading quran i found many amazing facts  from those i found is scientific facts or miracles i will mention some of them:    Few miracles Of Quran   Big Bang  When describing the creation of the "heavens and the earth," the Qur'an states the theory of the "Big Bang" explosion at the start of it . the Qur'an says that "the heavens and the earth were joined together as one unit, before they were aparted:   Quran (21:30) {Have not those who disbelieve see that the heavens and the earth were joined together as one united piece, then We cloved them asunder}  [cloved them asunder means separated them].  and this was 1400 years before the discovery of the big bang theory.    Expansion of Universe   this amazing theory was discovered in the 20th century that the universe is continuing to expand after the big bang explosion,,   this idea ; that the universe is continuing to expand. was mentioned in quran 1430 years ago : {and The heavens, We have built them with power. And verily, We are still expanding it} quran (51:47).      Conclusion:   finally and in conclusion... The concept of God taught by Islam is, the Supreme being who is uncreated , anyone who is  created,  born or dies is not God.     i found that islam is the only religion that claims absolute uniqness of God and really means it and thus islam is the only religion today that follow the first commandment of all commandments to moses and jesus and mohammed which is :     "For thou shalt worship no other god: for the LORD, [is] a jealous God:" [Exodus 34:14]  and jesus said:  after one of the scribes asked him Which is the first commandment of all? Jesus answered him, ((The first of all commandments is, Hear, O Israel The Lord our God is one Lord ))   [Mark 12:28to33]   .|`|9f178b78d1df3d5b00c072925dbeddc0aa	converting to another religion is  like changing ur father , please dont do tht only for the selvish motive  of marrying one , religion isnt a thing to play with|`|hhVz4BlUaa	**** you man|`|tGaHEV6Daa	The guy above is generalising like CRAZY!! Not all Muslims are like that. My friend met a guy when she was travelling in Kenya and after four years of a long distance relationship he came over here and they got married and had a baby and then stayed for a year or so to save some money and then went back to Kenya. He doesn't push his beliefs on her, he isn't violent, he respects totally what she believes. Luckily she isn't a strong believer of any religion particularly so there isn't much of a barrier, but seriously not all Muslims are violent rapists as suggested above.     However, you shouldn't change your religion just for protocols, you should change it for you, you will know what is right. After all it is YOU that will have to face the consequences after life with regards to heaven/hell or reincarnation or what you believe. And if the man loves you properly he will respect your views and will probably say as long as you respect HIS views and don't mind him praying 5 times a day and doing Ramadan then there's no need to convert. If someone says you HAVE to convert, then yes it is likely you will be a trophy wife.|`|AA10248239	I decided to accept Islam based on a comparison of the Bible and the Qur'an.  They are similar in many ways, but where they are different the Qur'an seems more logical to me.    I told my family straight out.  My father congratulated me.  He told me he was proud of me because I took life seriously enough to make such a momentous decision.  My mom was upset at first, but later admitted that it had been very good for me.    A year or so later, I was introduced to a Muslim man, and, after talking to him on the phone for a few weeks, decided to marry him.  For the past 21 years we have lived in Saudi Arabia.  I miss Home, but I love it here.|`|eRT4d6hvaa	Ahamdullillah, I converted.  I am about to share with my family my conversion.  As an all english catholic family,I know they wont understand, but thats fine.  I dont push my beliefs on anyone, its for my own salvation.  What I believe and need inside.  I remember years before... when I was considering conversion my mum pleading with me not to do it.  Telling me to remember Jesus, as once when she was really ill and no one could help her, the only thing that stopped her totally flipping was Jesus and that she prayed and held onto him & he helped her.  I hope when I tell her about my conversion she can understand that this is how I feel about Allah and Islam.  It completes me and I am so at peace.  I hope they chose to stay in my life.  Subhanallah, I married a muslim I love very much six days ago.  So, now I have an additional blessing.  New muslima of 9 months.|`|yf9fabOKaa	Keep me posted.|`|78gwXI1eaa	Be VERY careful. If it not a true religion and you will be killed if you leave. Read this site http://www.apostatesofislam.com/    Why Mohammed was not a prophet:    One who claims to be a messenger of God is expected to live a saintly life. He must not be given to lust, he must not be a sexual pervert, and he must not be a rapist, a highway robber, a war criminal, a mass murderer or an assassin. One who claims to be a messenger of God must have a superior character. He must stand above the vices of the people of his time. Yet Muhammads life is that of a gangster godfather. He raided merchant caravans, looted innocent people, massacred entire male populations and enslaved the women and children. He raped the women captured in war after killing their husbands and told his followers that it is okay to have sex with their captives and their right hand possessions (Quran 33:50) He assassinated those who criticized him and executed them when he came to power and became de facto despot of Arabia. Muhammad was bereft of human compassion. He was an obsessed man with his dreams of grandiosity and could not forgive those who stood in his way. Muhammad was a narcissist like Hitler, Saddam or Stalin. He was astute and knew how to manipulate people, but his emotional intelligence was less evolved than that of a 6-year-old child. He simply could not feel the pain of others. He brutally massacred thousands of innocent people and pillaged their wealth. His ambitions were big and as a narcissist he honestly believed he is entitled to do as he pleased and commit all sorts of crimes and his evil deeds are justified.     Why Quran is not from God:    Muhammad produced no miracles and when pressed he claimed that his miracle is the Quran. Yet a cursory look at the Quran reveals that this book is full of errors. Quran is replete with scientific heresies, historic blunders, mathematical mistakes, logical absurdities, grammatical errors and ethical fallacies. It is badly compiled and it contradicts itself. There is nothing intelligent in this book let alone miraculous. Muhammad challenged people to produce a Surah like it or find an error therein, yet Muslims would kill anyone who dares to criticize it. In such a climate of hypocrisy and violence truth is the first casualty.    If you can be deceived by a false prophet you will be deceived by the anti-Christ.|`|EE9hxPXraa	Something for you to consider before making a huge mistake.

bltgAc9Maa	I heard that Bulgarian women are beautiful. As I recall, I think Bulgaria is voted  4 as the country with the most beautiful women in the world according to Traveler's Digest (so I read on the internet).    Well, Bulgarians are part of Slavic people. If you know about the Slavic people features, then I'm sure it would be easy for you to imagine. Other examples of Slavic people are the Yugoslav (Croats, Bosniaks, Macedonians, Serbians etc), Russians, Czechs, etc. I don't know if there are anything distinguishing regarding their physical features. I'm not exactly an anthropologist so I don't know for sure. I only know that they're white Europeans. They can have skin color ranging from the fairest to olive or even caramel colored. And they can also have either blond or dark hair, so I don't know about their most distinguishing features, I'm afraid. But I do agree with Traveler's Digest, though. Most Slavic women are HOT!!!|`|wh3BAc4taa	I have a few Bulgarian friends and they are all different. They look mostly European, either have dark or blonde hair, nice clear skin (skin tone can vary), have a sharp nose and look a bit Russian.|`|v9FE0nWCaa	First I want to say that Bulgarians are not Slavs. I have no time to explain, but you can investigate on the Internet. According to recent studies, the Bulgarians are with afgano-Iranian origin /aryans/. For women - Bulgarians are among the most beautiful women in the world. There are blond, and there are dark, white or dark eyes, but a classic example of Bulgarian woman is dark hair and blue or green eyes. They have smooth skin /very white, caramel or olive/, in 90% of the cases their noses are right or sharp, and it is rarely able to see a woman on bg streets with short hair. In Bulgaruia the beauty is like some cult and most girls try to have good bodies. Respectively - they have.    http://www.vbox7.com/play:b90a8810    http://www.travelersdigest.com/countries...|`|AA10932291	mixture of slovans and turks:  dark hair, toned skin, sometimes look russian.

YHmr7nvsaa	It's the brainwashing.|`|AeSxi3RQaa	You know that the Moses story about parting the Red sea was actually a mistranslation from the Aramaic to Latin.. It was actually the Reed Sea..  a mistranslation which seems to have carried on into Christianity and Islam .. :) twits.|`|dPYotwUxaa	I thought at certain times of the year the red sea was only a few metres deep in places?|`|ZLabz00naa	David Copperfield isnt threatening me with eternal damnation|`|4cRKwYfoaa	Moses had God behind him.|`|4GiIXWUXaa	Well no not really.    Atmospheric disturbances and wind currents make a "splitting sea" possible. In the event of a hurricane [or tornado on land] the waters underneath are divided by the pressure and force of the winds as they are somewhat "sucked up" into the funnel and thusly pushed outward.  Though it is more so relevant to wind currents than splitting waters.  In a Tsunami wind currents along with tectonic plate shifts cause massive waves and tides.  Tides, after all are all relevant to current and current relative to the rotation of the earth and wind flow. A matter of gravity in conjunction to the earth's rotation.    In any case, it has been scientifically proved that, IF the ground was elevated or "curved" making the depth of water at that point minimal in comparison to the rest of the "sea" (or lake) and a strong wind or force comparable were present the sea could actually "part" leaving a passable route upon the initial place of elevation of land.     So it is theoretically, hypothetically, plausibly and tangibly possible for there to be such an anomoly as a "parting sea" though no such occurances have been documented outside the Biblical story in Exodus.    This article is old, but it is interesting nonetheless.  http://worldnetdaily.com/news/article.as...    http://www.science-frontiers.com/cat-geo...    xoxo  ?|`|80JBvRdFaa	@ American Idle  So the only thing keeping you in line and making you a good moral person is fear of going to hell?

When Moses parted the Red Sea he prayed for God to help them get away from the Egyptians and God gave Moses the power to part the Red Sea. It was definitely not an illusion but the mighty power of God
ASSbLOk6aa	So simply my friend. Now that you notice that he notices you, just act 'approachable'. Don't and look away when you walk pass him, he gets confuse. You need to send the right signals saying "I am ready to engage".    One of the surest way is to give a broad and warm smile, maintain eye contact for at least 5 secs, then walk away if you are shy.     You already said enough with these gestures. He knows you will talk to him if he approaches you. Give him as much opportunities for him to do so. Don't keep running round and round.  Look helpless at the drink machine, trying to look for change,  or  rest and a corner with enough room for him to approach and start a conversation. Now sit back and wait.,      Good luck.|`|C4BJ3yLWaa	After your run, sit by the sidelines and cool down.  Perhaps you can strike up a conversation then.|`|2DICrKNraa	When you're all sweaty, ask to borrow his towel.  (just kidding)    Eh these situations are always tough.  You just have to have the guts to go up to him and say hi.  See if you can catch him on the way out or going over to the water fountain.  Something like that....trust your gut.    Another dumb idea would be to get on the flat bench and ask him to spot you.  Haha...lame!  (sorry, I couldn't resist)|`|iuyYfQHmaa	Sounds like you have the same problem as I do. And yes, it's called shyness. Also might be low self esteem. I'd suggest the next time you are doing your stretching, and he's on the other side of the room smiling at you, smile back.

If they're open minded they won't mind but they won't flirt back if they're not interested. They will just smile or laugh it off (what I use to do back in the days lol.)

Before you start 'hitting' on other girls, make sure you are clear of any STDs. Just a note, many lesbians are wary of bisexual women-- for possible infections and also the idea that the bi woman can live in a socially approved straight world with a man.

Other countries have xenophobia problems too, some, in my opinion, are a lot more severe.  The USA is a lot more mixed than lots of other countries.  We have turbulent relations between people of different groups, but we generally tolerate each other.  This doesn't happen in other countries where there is less of a variety of people/races/national origins.  There are places on this globe with overall less tolerance for "different" cultures.  I'm not even talking about obvious places with repressive regimes.  Even Japan has a xenophobia problem.    I'm not trying to justify the actions of ignorant American citizens, but I don't think xenophobia is a US-centric problem at ALL.
ngxw9waWaa	God/Satan/Man is weak because he submits to prostitutes and the demands of women, thereafter driven by the will of women.    Only the Creator he who stands with submission to none other than wisdom is King of Kings.    All others are readily destroyed and subjugated by witches, whores and devious trolls.    He who is Omnipotent, Omnipresent, Omniscient cures and cleanses all sin with his presence. The remaining wilful sinners require destruction. To forgive such devices is to create the hell of struggle and suffering for the virtuous and good.

The Bible is not a science book or a history book.  It's not a "step-by-step how-to" book either.    It's a theology and philosophy book.  Got some poetry in there too (think:  "metaphor").    It was written in the East by Easterners using the distinctly Eastern concept that the value of lessons to be learned from history is greater than the value of precisely correct factual factoids.|`|EiiVMtjyaa	Dear Friend,    The Bible is God's Instruction Manual for man to live an abundant life.  It is also His "love" letter to us, because we can personalize it.    God is a God who commands, obedience to His Word.  Why?  Because He knows what is 'best' for us ...better, than we do.  So, when we obey Him, there are blessings.  When we disobey, consequences.  Sounds like a very loving Parent to me. (grin)    It is no different than you setting specific good moral guidelines (rules) for your children to follow.  When they follow the rules, there is peace and great communication in the home (one accord).  When there is disobedience/rebellion...chaos.  Makes sense to me.    By the way, my grandmother was a bold, dynamic "preacher."  She led me to...Jesus when I was 14 years old. Women are not to have authority...OVER a man.  But if you think about it...we are ALL ministers, preachers of the gospel.  Amen (grin)|`|EBGdlo35aa	Humans have free will.  God generally allows people to do as they wish - including lie, prostitute themselves, etc.    1) Jesus did not stone a prostitute although the Law says she MUST be stoned.    You are misquoting and misreading the Mosaic Law.  If Jesus had stoned the adulteress (not prostitute), it would have been murder.  If he had even instructed the crowd/mob that she should be stoned (which is what the Scribes/Pharisees were attempting to get him to do), he would have been guilty of a capital offense under Mosaic Law (assuming the authority of a judge).  He did the only thing that he could under Mosaic Law - neither join the stoning nor pass judgment.      2) Women are told not to be preachers in church in the Bible yet there ARE MANY female prophets, apostles in the Bible.    No contradiction there (obviously).      3) How can Christianity or God be simply black and white, or right and wrong?    Essentially, it's simple:  what God instructs is right, what God forbids is wrong, everything else is either  a) a judgment call or  b) optional      4) Not everything is absolute or RIGHT or WRONG. Many things like abortion, homosexuality are all subjective    Here you are wrong.  It's true that not everything is absolutely right or wrong.  For example, is writing with green ink right?  Is it wrong?  It is neither - it is not a moral issue.    However, homosexual acts are wrong.  It is NOT subjective - God is THE arbiter of what is right and wrong.  "Wrong" (better:  "sin") is *by definition* what God says is wrong.  What is right is *by definition* what God says is right.  The personal *opinions* of what is right and wrong have no bearing on the absolute determination - of God - concerning what is right and wrong.    Abortion is a little bit trickier because there *are* cases in which abortion might be justifiable - for example, in the case where bringing a fetus to term is likely to cause the death of both mother and child.  In such a case, abortion will greatly improve the chances of life for at least one of the two.  In such a case, there is no truly good solution, only a choice between two solutions, neither of which is truly good.    Another example is killing someone in defense of your family.  This is not a *good* thing to do - but it is an *acceptable* thing to do.  It is the less of two evils (the other being allowing harm to your family).

God gives us free will.  We freely chose to sin or not sin.  You can't blame that on God.  If God did not use a sinner, He could not use any of us.     It never ceases to amaze me how people can blame God for their sins.  Or, find fault with God because He allows us free will.  The same ones who find fault with God for that, would also find fault and cry if God did not give us free will.  I can hear them now, "whaaaaa  whaaaa, God didn't let me make up my own mind.....Whaaaaaaaaaa".    Women are told that they are not to exercise "authority" over the men within the Church.  There is a big differences between that, and being a prophet, or even preaching in certain situations.    The Law was the "schoolmaster" set down to teach us right and wrong.  Jesus came to institute the New Covenant that God promised.  This New Covenant freed us from the bondage of the Law and placed us under Grace.  Now, instead of "an eye for an eye", we have "turn the other cheek".  This is why Jesus did not stone the prostitute.    You should study and learn the Bible before trying to find faults with it.  biblical|`|o6mP6yBAaa	U seem confused cause u keep trying to put our creator and jesus as one, and thats not true. our creator is Yahweh ,god is Yahweh Yahweh is god...now jesus is the god that came with the new test, or son of god, or whatever he claims to be,merely a man if anything..Ok..If the law says to do something and jc didnt obey the law then whats that say of him...women are told that not to be preachers and stuff in the new test by who? jesus or whomever,but Yah,had female prophets and judges,so whats that say?...God-Yahweh,god of israel,creator...Christianity-jesus,fals... god....I dont say the bible is fake,but the new test is...only those who serve Yah get His grace,thats a hard thing for folks to take in so they deal with it by saying its ok to do things when its not..grace is not for everyone and Yah been giving grace,to those who serve Him, way before the new test and jc came into play..No, things are right,or its wrong, if ur doing right there is no argument,if ur not, then there is always someone who wants to debate...I would like to know the script where u got ur info,..Shalom
0XkIHnipaa	Probably because they dont feel threatened sexually by two gay men. At least the two gay guys are going to leave her alone and not hit on her.    Some women dont mind gay people; but Ive met some that absolutely hate it, gay or lesbian. and some that hate gays but accept lesbians. I guess it depends on their upbringing and personal preferences.    The difference between men and women is that generally speaking, men get off on sexual behaviour of any kind, women tend not to. Men are going to naturally be more excited when they see two women kissing or making out, because theyre sex maniacs, lol. Women might get off on it too, but theyre generally more reserved about it. And men feel threatened when they see two guys getting it on; a lot more than you'd think would be turned on by it, but are scared, so that is converted into anger and revulsion.|`|NlWSj3OWaa	u r as offensive as u r ignorant.

eO2rnf7yaa	Look into PhD programs at American universities. They commonly provide a small stipend to the student in exchange for a modest amount of work done for a professor.  Under such conditions, you also would pay no tuition. A scholarship would be part of the package.  Ask one of your previous professors about this.

To care for the welfare of others before our selves, and not after is what love is in truth.  The sacrifice of righteousness is what He looks for from us.  The spirit of selfishness is the driving force behind every sin under the sun; and without selfishness, there would be no sin.  Our sincerity toward God is determined by how willing we are to actually care for others.|`|9vm0Y1UUaa	Let us put things in Perspective:  1. You have passion. That is fantastic. To achieve anything passion is absolutely necessary and important.   2. However this passion needs to be directed towards a goal, destination, and aim. Then it gives more satisfaction and meaning to the life and time spent for something worthwhile.   3. Once you nail the direction in which you want to strive, then the courses or training required for it becomes easy to mark.     Since, you have said, My passion is international affairs...particularly in regards to the Middle East and Persian Gulf. Ask yourself what exactly you are interested in. It looks to me that you are interested in,  I would be able to (hopefully) gain valuable work experience in international affairs.....and gain valuable insight into the inner workings of foreign relations. as you have mentioned in your post.     Military is not fit for such a job:   The reason is that you may not be able to share the knowledge you gain with anyone. Most of the things as you have mentioned (inner workings) will have to be secret. And a lot of dirty diplomacy and lies one has to get used to and hardened into as you see it so blatantly in the world today.    For Example:   Bush-Blair (BB) and Iraq war: it is now clear to the whole world that the war was actually for the Gulf fuel wells. But BB could not do it openly. So they attacked Iraq under the pretext of searching for Chemical Weapons which they did not find till today. The BB duo has escaped any International Inquiry. But they managed to kill Saddam Hussein who supposedly killed many Iraqis as a dictator only and ironically after BB themselves (their army) killed innumerable hapless Iraqi citizens.     2. Another best example: Pakistan has repeatedly denied that Ajmal Amir Kasav, one of the terrorists captured during attacks on Mumbai in India, is a Pakistani citizen, despite the proofs provided. As they were denying it they cordoned off the whole village where Kasavs house was. It was too much for Pakistan to hold the lid tight on the Truth till finally Mohmad Durani National Security Adviser of Pakistan himself came out openly that Ajmal Amir Kasav is a Pakistani national.     If such are the inner workings of foreign affairs you really need to think hard and go through the pros and cons of it before you nail yourself to it. I can quite understand the precarious condition often Mis Condolisa Rice could have found herself. That is why ollin Powel resigned.     Then you need to go to the sites that are related to foreign affairs etc. like the one here:         Of course there are other indirectly connected jobs to the things you are looking for.     1. Journalism. With this you are able to travel abroad and collect information you want with dignity.     2. To open an NGO of your own in order to insert yourself into the lives of the people there and work for them. As you work, you will also come to know a lot of inner workings of the countries. However, before you start your own NGO there are studies related to that to be completed. Studies in Social Sciences, Community Building, and host of other lines. You can choose one of them for your studies. Then some experience of working under some recognized International NGO.       Take care and all the best.

uD1UFdRsaa	I'm sorry but she doesn't even look real. Literally speaking.   Hrm... she looks a mix of Caucasian as well because her eyes are larger then the regular Chinese or Japanese person. I'd say she's more Chinese judging by the clothing and yeah the eyes. My mums chinese and she's got pretty large eyes too :)|`|5I6ZQUn7aa	she doesn't look chinese or japanese. it looks like she is wearing that costume for photo shoot.|`|7mCd6z0Zaa	Pretty sure she's japanese...

We don't really know what to do with the damn thing. At the moment it's stuck with grunt work for the immune system, but it's not a good solution.    Obviously you don't need a full-sized caecum anymore as you don't metabolise cellulose, but isn't there something else you could do with it?    Couldn't you, like, keep your mobile phones in it or something?

At least I would be confused.|`|IfevtHM8aa	they are confused and want to be the opposite gender they originally was!|`|Vzz89Ikpaa	Firstly transsexuals can be male to female or female to male.    They will feel as though they are in the wrong body from an early age.    In the beginning the need to dress is often hidden and restricted to safe opportunities when they will not be found out, so although some relief is gained, they also have to cope with guilt at being deceptive and terror of being found out.    They often struggle to come to terms with who they are and will often go through cycles of purging all of their feminizing or masculinising items.    Once they decide to seek medical help they have to deal with telling and often losing family, friends, colleagues etc at school or work and often their means to earn a living.     When they are born they have a brain dictated gender which doesn't match their bodies. This is a physical birth defect however the medical profession have to be sure that they are suffering from gender dysphoria and not transvestic fetishism or any of the other mental health issues, so they have to be interrogated by psychiatrists this is often a big ordeal.    Once this is done they begin a set period of transition, in the UK it is a minimum of two years, during which time you have to live fulltime as a woman. This is when you get problems with using toilets, bullying etc.    Hormones can help a f to m grow a beard but often don't stop beard growth in f to m so plucking or epillating is needed, but you then get the issue of 5 o'clock shadow showing through light make up or wearing heavy make up, probably with a wig while you wait for your hair to grow out, which draws attention to you.    Voices and stature, ie foot size also cause problems.    Buying clothes especially m to f can be problematic.    There are often problems when asked for proof of id over the phone.    A lot of people refuse to accept that surgery and hormones can change the sex of someone, they do not understand it is the body that was wrong.    If one half of a married couple in UK transition, when they apply for the gender recognition certificate get 6 months to anull thier marriage. They then get the option to have a same sex ceremony, once a full certificate is granted. It also affects, pensions, retirement age and insurance.|`|HGUavBU4aa	One big one that was missed probably because no one had the courage to say it or are so full of Harry Benjamin Syndrome hate that they probably support it:      Placing transsexual women in men's prisons.      Many people may feel that these people deserve it but that misses a huge point.    The surest way for a woman to be raped is assurance from the government that nothing will happen if you decide to rape her.    The message the government sends with this policy to men in America is "If you want rape a transsexual woman, go for it boys!!! We want you to!!!"    That is why the fact that a transsexual woman is post-op and law-abiding misses 90% of the point. Law abiding  transsexual women are at a heightened risk for rape as a consequence of this policy.     Where do you think rapists learn that it is ok to rape transsexual women. Prison of course; or at least from buddies that went there.    Right now, the government is just getting around to the murder thing; debating whether or not trans-panic (panicing about the discovery that the woman you just had sex with is transsexual; thus make people think you are gay) is justification for it or not.    This policy also expands rape culture to chromosomal XX women or cisgender women. If any woman thinks that men who learned to rape women in prison will stop at transsexuals when they are released are naively foolish.     Rapists do not have such impulse control. Prison trained rapists will not likely find transsexual women to rape for their impulse releases when released from prison. That leaves only one other option; cisgender women.    Even if cisgender women don't get raped by  released convicts; their horrible attitude and views on women are spread to other men in the communities they are released to. This obviously has a horrible impact on the sexual culture of those neighborhoods.

BevylvVSaa	Most everyone's advice so far is good. Talk about anything and everything you would usually talk about.     BUT, talk to your parents, and have them talk to her doctors about using the sleeping pill AMBIEN ti help her wake up. I know for absolute certain it has woken two people up from coma.     My friend Sylvia had been in a coma for over a year and a half after a car accident and they were going to turn off the life support because they felt she was brain dead - she had two doses of AMBIEN and she woke up. Within 2 months she was pregnant with her second child. The pregnancy was too hard on her body so quickly, and she miscarried the baby and went into coma again. After a month in the coma, they tried the AMBIEN again and it worked again. It is now a few months later, and she is doing really well. She is unable to walk at present and uses a wheelchair, but it is expected she will be able to walk again soon.    My friend Marco also was in a coma from an overdose. After 3 days they tried it and it worked for him also.    There is growing evidence that AMBIEN works to wake people up from comas. Just do a google search on AMBIEN and comas.|`|AA12194228	You would not be responding. What ;you would be doing is speaking with her as though you think she can hear. tell her things you've been doing and how much you would like for her to wake up because you miss hearing her speak with you.  It is often quite amazing what people who have wakened, even from a long coma can tell you what they heard when they were in that deep sleep. Don't think for one minute she doesn't hear,(maybe she doesn't but maybe she does), sit by her bed side, hold her hand and talk with her.  God bless and give you strength both you and your sister and all your family.|`|Xcri5qeTaa	That's quite a blow, but it's doable.    I know it's a bit odd when someone isn't responsive, but don't let that get in the way. Physical contact and talking about anything goes a long way, and bringing some things from her life to her room, like the music she likes, candles, stuffed animals or whatever.    Tell her you brought it, and indulge her appropriate senses -- like if it's her favorite perfume, put it on her, or a stuffed animal, touch her cheek with it. You get the idea.    Talk about things she would like to hear about. Bring her the news about what's going on. Share what's going on in your life.    Develop a routine, even if it's just two or three things. It'll be a little bit like talking to yourself out loud, and sometimes talking to her. You'll get used to it pretty quickly.    Having other people visit and talk to her is good, too, and doing physical therapy stuff, like raising her arms (I'm not sure if moving her legs would be good because of the back injury -- check with the doctor) might be helpful.    The idea is to stimulate her senses.    I don't think there's much conscious thought going on during most of the time in a coma, but it might be like talking to someone who's asleep, where there may be times when they're semi-conscious.    I had a friend who was DOA after an accident, but was revived. He was in a coma, and the doctors thought he was unlikely to walk again if he even came out of the coma. He did, though, within six months after coming out of the coma.    His brain injury took a while to recover from -- he couldn't talk at first, went through a lot of physical and speech therapy at the hospital.    He died about a year later, though, from a brain tumor which appeared.    There's too many unknowns about coma and paralysis to be certain what will happen.    My sincerest best wishes to you, your sister, and your family.|`|defde0b6e42848179471ab740c517f46aa	I'm so sorry to hear this, I can't imagine how hard it must be.  I think you should talk to her like you used to.  Just tell her about your day, your plans, things like that.  Also, I bet she'd love it if you'd maybe reminisce about things you've done together.  Maybe you could even giver her a run down of new movies that are out, or read her books by her favorite author.  Good luck, and again, I'm so sorry.|`|accdd753250739a255f532616b8c6cdfaa	There's a lot of questions as to how much someone hears or doesn''t hear when they are in a coma.  They are certainly alive and must have some sensory idea of what is around them if they are not too deeply in a coma for a long long time and are not brain dead.  It sounds like there is hope that your sister will come out of the coma, and will have a hard road ahead of her, so I believe that there probably is a part of her that hears.  I use my Mother I guess as a sort of example for my thoughts on this.  My mother fell into a coma a number of years ago, and there was a lot of talk about would she come out or not, and she did.  During the time she was out all I can say is we talked to her, I told her what was happening in my daily life, my husband helped as did her sister, we held her hand, we were there for her.  I know that at one point I found a braclet that she thought she had lost and I brought it in to the hospital to show it to her and let her know I had it safe for her.  Do little things for her like that.  Just let her know that you love her and you will be there for her no matter what.  It's the sound of your voice that helps.  Ok, sounds stupid, it's sort of like when people say plants react better if people talk to them.  No your sister is not a plant and I'm not saying that, but it''s just the human voice does so much in a void.  Please take what I said in a positive way.  I have been where you are, so I am not trying to be funny or make fun of anything here.  My situation was a bit different than most as my mother was left handed and left handed people come out of comas better than others, it's a strange thing with their brain.  Be supportive, talk to her and hold her hand, that's all you have to do.  Be there as much as you can be there.  But please, do try and remember one thing, you do have a life of your own.  I know you love your sister, and she is your little sister.  But, I gather you have parents who love her too.  you should all take turns in being there. You should all also remember that you need time and rest for yourselves, you will have a long road with her once she is awake.  My best to you and your family, I hope the suffering ends soon.|`|PnlgLBcwaa	What is recommended is to talk to her like you did before her accident--gtheuy can't tell if she can hear/understand at all--and in case she can--a sense of normalcy will help her if there is any chance of recovery    While it is true that there have been reports of Ambien helping people in comas-you need to be cautious and not overly optomistic....    Ambien has been referred to as cortisol--but a review of vaious reputable websites shows no indication it is cortisol-I am still looking.    Whatever it is-ambien is something to consider and research|`|Qyue0Ykgaa	Whisper into her ear > we will always be here for you. Your body will repair itself, and you will open your eyes when the time is right.    This way you are telling her, that you will emotionally always be here for her, that her body will heal itself, and to the subconscious > to open the eyes, to start the brain work and be able to send signals with the eyes.    Ps: Dont forget to say >>> In the name of Allah, Most gracious most Merciful, before you start to talk to her. For a coma is only a state of neutrality, memories, a film of what has happened before in the life, a fantasy that can be changed many times when the ears hear words of hope and prayer, and that can work miracles, if your works from Allah can but reach her heart, through the ears.|`|bHfuVh6kaa	I am sorry about your sister - life is the pits sometimes :0(    My friend was in a type of coma - I used to just chat to her as normal - like what our kids had being doing at school, what I made for dinner - anything and everything - it might sound mundane and boring but any chat is good.    I used to brush her hair and put a little makeup on for her - also used to massage her hands with hand cream as hospitals can be a very drying environment - also use to put chap-stick on her lips - kept them soft and I used to hope she could taste it    used to play her favourite music, read mags etc to her, do her nails - in fact everything we used to do together before she was like this.    My friends was a waking coma and I never got any real responses - I just used to hope she was getting some pleasure from the little things I was doing  - Please don't give up doing things for her - no one really knows what they can hear or feel - I hope things improve for your sister & your family (())|`|UvUUhFtGaa	This is such a painful experience for your family, I am so sorry you are all going through this.  I have been there.  Try to talk naturally to your sister as if you know she is nearby, listening.    Feel free to talk about your own confusion and learning how to talk to her while she is in hospital.  Express your faith and hopes that she is going to be alright.  Be as calm and reassuring as you can be.   If there is music you know she likes, use that.  (Not too loud).   Look for music that is gentle and calming and uplifting.  Is there a perfume or fragrance she likes?   Bring that in.  Be sure to touch her, especially when you are talking.(My brother, who was quadriplegic, stressed the importance of touch).  Make her space as cheerful as you can--- most hospital rooms are pretty grim.  Color, stuffed animals, flowers, etc-- do what you can to make the room comfy, for her and also for her visitors.    You are at the beginning of a new chapter in your life and that of your sister.-- we can't know exactly where it will take you and how the time will play out, but you can use each day to express your love and care.  Read to her, many children's books are simple and clear and cheery.  I used to read the Reader's Digest jokes to my brother.   Develop a routine--- when you enter her room, say something like :   "Hi, Sis, this is _______ and I'm glad to see you today.  "  Don't be looking for response from her right now---- just give to her your best support and affection.   It is alright to realize that doctors are human and do not really know all the answers.  It is also alright to realize that your sister's body has been severely injured, and she can benefit from your caring no matter what state she is in.    I hope some of this is helpful.  Your family has suffered a great shock but you can get through this.  You will find your way .|`|F3nlVXJ5aa	she's in her body, just that she can't come out and talk to you.  I suggest you talk to her, read to her, tell her about school and your friends and what's going on in your school, tell her funny jokes, tell her you miss her and need her back, tell her you will pray for her.  Do crossword puzzles at her bedside and guess at the words.  Do as you normally would do as if she were there talking with you.  She hears you.|`|ca8edf2a66d3abd8c642d9f347f4b0b0aa	I've heard that people who are in comas can hear stuff that is going on around them and if it is happy, peaceful and/or excited voices or sounds it sometimes wakes them up sooner.

Physical  contact  is  stimulating.  Dont  speak  of  any  negative  or  allow  others  to  do so. Research  her  condtion  to  learn  more  what  to  do  later  and  what  questions  to  ask.

It generally consists of a small ring of onion dipped in batter or bread crumbs and then deep fried. The result varies from restaurant to restaurant. The ring-like structure of an onion lends itself well to this mode of preparation.    The exact origin of the onion ring is unknown, but in 1933 a recipe for deep-fried onion rings that are dipped in milk then dredged in flour appeared in a Crisco advertisement in The New York Times Magazine.[1]    [edit] Variants    * Tobacco ring - very thin, crisp onion rings named for their color  * Blooming onion - a whole onion that is cut into a flower shape that fans out  * Onion loaf - a rectangular structure of onion rings fried together  * Texas Toothpicks - strips of onions and strips of jalape?os battered and fried. Served in a basket together with ranch dressing.    [edit] References    1. ^ "Crisco Advertisement", The New York Times Magazine: SM18, November 5, 1933, http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.h...

rFFYCmOGaa	First off congratulations on getting married and planning on having children.    Secondly I would advise you to seriously meditate long and hard about how you feel about this in your heart because it is sending you signals for a reason.    My wife and I rarely see eye to eye on religious matters and it has certainly cause a great deal of grief throughout the years that quite often I have wondered if I would have gone through it if I knew beforehand how such issues would play out--but it can be done I mean there are plenty of other folks on here who do not share the same faith as their spouses and have what sound like perfectly good marriages.    So it can be done but seriously, I would really really think hard and long about it before making such a life changing commitment.    I do wish you the very best and hope everything works out for you guys.|`|7cLYgf2raa	Whatever you compromise to keep, you will lose.If you are not comfortable about this marriage, it will not get any better. You need to vent your concerns NOW.And see his reactions. Do not sweep those concerns under the rug. The best thing you can do is bring conflict and see how he handles it.Because conflict will always come when the puppy love of the honeymoon is over.
sinvSdkeaa	no, it should be up to biology, rather then culture.  Culture changes from place to place, while biology is pretty consistent nation wide ;).|`|kHv0CuaMaa	Uh, no. I thought the same thing when I was that age. Although, I was pretty mature and responsible. For that to happen all ever the country, or even state wide, would be awful. Teens at 15 or even 16, don't think about the future they don't care about the ramifications of their antics.   At that young age, the brain isn't fully developed and can't make certain judgments or decisions for one's self.  It would not work, sorry kid.|`|bs9Zbouaaa	no because parents have more exprience.|`|h7LsYmrtaa	Well, most parents consider children to finish college, then they can make all their decisions all by them selves. So, I would say no, as my mother says.|`|TcaWW4OBaa	yes, providing we have a proper understanding of the topic and consequenses either way we decide.    we may be young, but we are old enough to understand what we are talking about and make an informed decision without interference from adults. we can think for ourselves.|`|MhbEQoJYaa	I trust my parents decision more. They are more wise. But I dont see the problem if others believe difrently.|`|8f7499c9305e3e0c3d2784e92308020caa	YES, because its none of their buisness and either way they make decisions on their own anyways.

I personally hate it when people stray their course to try to keep up with trends. Jackie Chan for instance. Amazing Actor and Stunt Choreographer. But in my opinion his best work was his older movies, such as Drunken Master or something along those lines. The new stuff is fun, but takes away from traditional values.      I suppose you have to adapt to your industry. Singers usually tend to follow trends in order to sell they're music.       So my final opinion is, Musicians and Singers, Yes.

cd87c1cf515692ef0adc60a28df772b0aa	I think it's fine as long as he likes that style and wears jewelry. And don't worry that you can't afford something as expensive. If he's dating you for your family's money, he doesn't really like you, right? So, no worries about the price of the bracelet. Besides, sterling silver is quite nice, actually. It's good quality and it's pretty, in my personal opinion. How was the bracelet more expensive? Was it gold? Gold does cost more than silver, but some people prefer silver over gold, anyways. I like the look of yellow gold, but I usually prefer the look of silver, white gold, and platinum. Some people are caught up on the price tag of something, but some people just like what they like and they don't let what society considers it to be worth (the price tag) to be relevant. Also, like I said, it shouldn't be about the money in this case, especially. It should be about the thought. That you cared enough to get him something. :) I don't know why sterling silver is more at Tiffany's, but my guess is it's just the name. Sometimes, people charge more just for a name. Silly, huh? I swear I've seen some shirts that really weren't very unique and looked quite simple and similar to other shirts I've seen for FAR less, but due to their brand, they were outrageously priced. That's just my guess.|`|WjwLkh9laa	Its fine.

JuWQMgSkaa	This was the first time that I've heard of Christadelphians. And it's interesting to see how much it parallels with Christianity. And please believe me I don't and will not judge, but I looked it up on wikipedia and there were several disagreements that Christadelphians have with Christianity. Here are some and there were a couple others still but these seemed like main ones:    Christadelphians reject a number of doctrines held by many other Christians, notably the immortality of the soul, trinitarianism, the pre-existence of Jesus Christ, the personhood of the Holy Spirit and the present-day possession of the gifts of the Holy Spirit. They instead believe that the words devil and satan are references to sin and human nature in opposition to God. According to Christadelphians, these terms are used in reference to specific political systems or individuals in opposition or conflict. Hell is understood to refer to death and the grave, rather than being a place of eternal torment. Christadelphians do not believe that anyone can go to Heaven.    It said that Christadelphians believe in the Bible, but that's not fully true if they also believe in what is stated above. For example, there are several references in the Bible that state when someone, other than Jesus, goes to Heaven.    Like I said before, I'm not judging you or anyone else.|`|defde0b6e42848179471ab740c517f46aa	Wrong Category.  I think you took a right when you should have gone left.

So long as you are happy with your lot in life, that is all that counts.  As for your other concerns. Well some so called Christians and other religious groups, are so hypocritical. I hate religion. It is the cause of just about all the wars that we have seen on our planet. They should ALL be banned and maybe we would all get along.|`|8A83Zagoaa	Because religion is full of hypocrisy!  It's a form of brainwashing...  And try posting this on the Religion Section; you may get better answers from there.|`|RfGiuZ15aa	I know little about your religion except what I've gleaned from a quick look at wikipedia and your official website but I can understand where you are coming from and why you chose to ask your question here. Homosexuality is a minority group and oh so many, secure in the comfort of their inclusion in the majority (whether that be by sexuality or religion) are happy to condemn us as evil or try to deny us our rights. Look at Islam which calls itself the religion of peace and tolerance under whose love and tolerance gays are imprisoned or executed. We are perceived as a threat to the family whereas we have as much chance of changing our sexuality or that of  anybody else as a leopard has of changing its spots.    You follow a Christian sect and you will know what the Romans did to Christians 2000 years ago. By and large, things aren't so bad for you now but still others try to marginalise you or condemn you. What it comes down to is intolerance. Every religion claims to be the one true path to eternal bliss. Therefore, all other religions must be wrong. Some will condemn you out of so called pity but I believe most hatred and condemnation come from fear and insecurity. Yet when you think about it, if you are secure in your faith, why should you fear anyone else. You're right and they are wrong. But try telling that to the muslims in Saudi Arabia where all other religions are banned by law.    In the end, faith is the belief in an afterlife whether you have any proof for it or not. Possibly, you'll just have to emulate the ancient Christians and suffer for your beliefs but that does not make them any less valid than the belief of a mainstream Christian, Jew, Muslim or any other religious sect. I'm gay and you're a Christedelphian and they don't like us. That's their loss. You just keep doing what makes you happy so long as it doesn't hurt others.|`|NlWSj3OWaa	all christians believe the bible is the straight source from their God as do Muslims believe their koran from their God. This country has had several religions who produce bibles in addition to the "HOLY BIBLE" as with the mormons. have u met any christians who can actually tell u what the bible said in the Original form? They don't consider that the book they study has been through so many translations it varies greatly from its origin. for example the words cerefim (a level of angles)was taken out after the king james version. Since there isnt any actual proof Jesus was on earth folks have to believe he was here-he was jewish yet the jews dont even believe he was Gods begotton, with so much controversity you cant expect folks 2 concider that anyone has the TRUTH but them? What is a cult? You say it like its a bad thing. And whats wrong with being in one if it serves your needs and you choose 2 b there? Personally i dont know what christedelphian is but you cant go about changing others so relax and enjoy the freedom u have to worship as u c fit.
87VmFMEoaa	It's a religion.  Like Christianity, it's entirely separate from Judaism.  However, like Judaism it is entirely monotheistic.    My understanding is that it was founded by Islam's prophet, Muhammed, around the 7th century and that Islam's holiest site is Mecca.|`|MPX0f5jzaa	Islam is a very old and widely-loved and practiced religion that has its beginnings in Judaism (or at least at the time of the 12 tribes).  Some of our customs are alike, though our religions are very different.  We are both monotheistic, however.    If someone's trying to get a rise out of Jews just by saying the word "Islam", you're not going to find much.  We've lived side by side for centuries now.  It's only a few hate groups that have ruined that for the rest of us.|`|Oc7Cgi0oaa	A religion who believes in the same God and some of the same prophets?|`|ZASZsWs4aa	Islam is a false religion created by a false prophet.|`|TVJsOEKNaa	I look at Islam and Judaism as two distinct theological beliefs, with certain similarities that deserve respect, just like all religions.     Historically, Islam and Judaism have fared better, when compared to other faith based relations like Christianity.  As a whole, a lot of the disputes revolve over political views.    There should be better education/relations between the two religions in today's society, and it is a shame that this isn't the case. People need to stop equating religion with political views as a whole.      If we can learn to accept one another and focus on the positives of both beliefs, rather than the negatives, I feel we will see a lot more peace in general.

The Catholic Church does not teach that either.  The Bible contains the Truth,  but much of the Bible is written as allegory.  Demonstrating that the Bible makes a poor science manual is kind of absurd, since the Bible is not intended to be a science manual.     The Bible is neither a science manual nor a simple journal.  Trying to read it while purposely ignoring  2000 years of Catholic scholarship is likely to lead anyone astray.    God created the world.  The Bible is not a simple direction manual for how He did it.   The part of Genesis that is simply True is that God created the universe.   Mere humans could not possibly understand the details from reading the Bible.

Not to mention the extinction of just about everything except crocodiles and cockroaches.|`|Hjwp1yGWaa	Not all Creationists think the same, some paint themselves into a corner scripturally, others understand the Bible clearer when it comes to certain events.  The Bible mentions them and that should be enough for everyone to put dinosaurs to rest, as well as temporal issues, which is where science conflicts with Bible Scholars, yet the Bible does not mention a time line for these particulars either, it only says they happened.  So your question in regards to scripture is best defined by your own study of it, to try to make sense of it for yourself, and not to ask other people who don't research the Bible thoroughly.  Pick up a Strong's Concordance for $20 and research the Bible with as much passion as you study archeology, and you will find the truth to your answer in due time, I know already the answer to your question for myself, and we don't conflict with what the Bible says, however you will find science occasionally fudges figures to favor evolution over creationism without evidence, as to lead others away from the Bible, if you don't believe me what happened to the Brontosaurus(Allosaurus with a few bones that did not belong to him).|`|TEtOq1XCaa	Yes. Bible believing Christians know that dinosaurs were created on the same day as man.    Your mistake is that you call the Mesozoic Era a fact. It is not a fact - it is an evolutionary belief. Christians don't believe there ever was a Mesozoic Era (at least not 65 million years ago), as the earth is only 6000 years or so old.    (If dinosaurs lived millions of years ago, how do you explain red blood cells, blood vessels and hemoglobin being found in unfossilised dinosaur bone? The facts speak out against the evolutionary religion in this case, my friend).|`|oL6FUbshaa	There is no such thing as the Mesozoic Era. Those time periods are just a bunch of balogne. The dating methods are innacurate. Fossilization is caused by flooding. The bible talks about a flood.

Not only televangelists either, but a lot of preachers. I'm not necessarily disgusted by Ted Haggard as he is only human, but I certainly don't like him, I definitely don't agree with his brand of Christianity, and the fact that he's a lying hypocrite doesn't help either. He consistently bashed homosexuals when he himself turned out to be one. I'm not particularly fond of Dawkins either though. I think he is very overrated. So while i'm a Christian, I don't like nor agree with most televangelists and hypocritical preachers.|`|A90SRsTxaa	I don't know either of the men, but I fail to see where you have a problem with the exchange between them. From every thing I have watched of Dawkins, he seems like a pompous elitist to me. He compared the man to Hitler right of the bat with that Nuremberg comment.|`|8e5f9cb1082d891d0f3075f0e2e92d34aa	I'm not a "Xtian" and what Ted Haggard did was disgraceful. But It isn't my job to say he is on his way to hell. Anyone who is willing can make it to heaven. If they are willing to confess their sina to God, and repent (meaning they never want to make that mistake again) then they can be saved. It doesn't matter what they did in the past. God will forgive Atheists, and people like Ted Haggard. I'm not comparing you to him, I'm just saying anyone can be forgiven if they are willing to do what it takes to be forgiven. Unless they have committed the Ultimate sin of Blasphemy. And in order to do that, they would have to had once been saved, then turn their back on God and curse him. A person cannot commit the sin of blasphemy if they have no knowledge of who God is or what that sin even is! I don't slam the door in anyone's face. Everyone deserves a chance! Thats why Jesus died and was resurrected.|`|zfFjKhJJaa	Ehh..I don't tend to think of it as a "team", sorry    That's a pretty ignorant analogy|`|AA11931057	We are only human, made by a loving Creator who didn't want a bunch of brain dead will-less robots running around worshiping Him but a heart and soul-filled child with a choice.    Since we're none of us perfect, I guess it will surprise people that we're there and we'll be surprised by some of the people we see there.    Isn't it great that we don't have to worry that the entire world is judging our faith on the basis of one person?  I mean, that would be unfair and ludicrous in the extreme.|`|AnkIzRXWaa	Outlaw, your analogy doesn't make sense.  Those people you mentioned didn't do what they did in the name of Atheism.  But Tedd Haggard and all the other religious freaks do it in the name of Christianity!
lfnjwpu1aa	I would dress appropriately for any interview, clean, neat, and tasteful.  Diversity is not something they do for its own sake. It's something they firmly believe is critical to fulfilling their mission. Diversity in the firm is essential to serving their clients to the highest standards of professional excellence and gaining their complete satisfaction. Further, diversity is crucial to cultivating a vibrant work environment - one in which the opportunity for professional growth and personal satisfaction is assured for all.  Go prepared for anything and everything, grades, recommendations, experiences or involvement in any activities.why you want the interview, employment, hopes goals, suggestions ..you will be just fine, relax.  Thank you|`|ZQWEgFZ2aa	For this season, wear dark wash hollister jeans to your interview. They'll have a better idea on how you'll look while working at their store. For the shirt wear a hollister shirt in one of these colors, navy, gray, or white. As for the interview, everything is chill and relaxed. Just answer honestly and don't be fake. For the diversity question, just say diversity is a group of different people who come together with a common style and interest. It's important in a workplace because it shows people that anyone can work there and it brings in a wider customer base. Hope this helps, good luck!|`|AA11159067	no i don't recamend wearing shorts. I would wear jeans, and for a shirt I would wear anything that is grey, navy blue, or white (since thats what the employess wear- and it will look good to them). No, they don't ask about your grades or anything. Some of the questions I was aked at my interview was "Why do you think diversity is important", "How would you define diversity" "How would someone else describe you", things like that. Since it is a group interview they only ask about 5 questions or so, and If you don't know what to say right away, you will usually have a chance to think about it while the others are answering. And for the interview questions, pretty much just say what you think they want to hear, and you should get hired.

In the process of a sinner who gets saved.. they must FIRST have "faith" Which means not only "believe" that God exists.. but put their ENTIRE "TRUST" in Him... as though they trusted a parachute while jumping out of a plane. You are aware that the parachute exists.. but now, you have to trust that it will save you from death.      Then, a person must "repent". Not just realize they are a sinner & be sorry for what they have done.. but turn away from the sins they are aware of.. one step at a time.     They cannot do this on their own. Most people cannot stop sinning. It's human nature.     Both of these things... "Trusting & Repenting".. are done through the power of the Holy Spirit drawing one to the understanding of God & His character. The Holy Spirit changes a person. It changes the thoughts, desires and understanding. The things that person loved, (like... sex outside of marriage, secular music, indulging in sin) now becomes things they hate. The things that they hated, (like... church, prayer, reading the bible, fellowship with other believers) then becomes things that they love. Their entire character changes through the power of the Holy Spirit. The same person you knew as a sinner acts like a completely different person.. because they have become born-again!    Once this has gone into action...   the individual is fully aware of God existing.. cause the spiritual blindness is cured. They can now see, hear & have a relationship with God. The evidence is in the supernatural transformational experience. Hence the meaning, "Born-Again".    The Faith started the transition of "hoping without seeing" into "knowing without seeing" or in other words, "becoming spiritually awakened".    This may not make any sense to you.. if you are not saved. It is a "spiritual" thing. If you are unsaved.. the spiritual side of you, is asleep.|`|RKlMDz4Eaa	our faith allows us to know.   it is something you will never understand|`|dKgkHZf3aa	Hebrews 11:1    1Now faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see.

Tell that to non-denominational Christians who follow Christ and the Biblical script.  Get off your high horse.|`|dFk5bRlCaa	to know something does not necessarily warrant that you have evidence. and that if you have facts does not translate to having no faith at all.    i know God exists. for me that means i believe firmly in the existence of God. know=be certain. faith helps me believe in God.    we are Christians after all so we only believe in one true God regardless of other gods existent.    people have different beliefs. you can't call them a liar for believing in things unlike what you yourself hold true.|`|xZet9Dunaa	I am a catholic and I know my faith is right.

To lie is a sin, and everyone has lied at one point in their life. Theer are also many other examples. But if they can find a way to promote hate, and stay away from the teachings of love and acceptance they will do that in a heart beat.|`|hR7OsqtRaa	Galatians 6 :7-10  "Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows. The one who sows to please his sinful nature, from that nature will reap destruction; the one who sows to please the Spirit, from the Spirit will reap eternal life.     Who created Humans.? People may say The Big Bang. Then Who Created the Big Bang.? Particles ? Who created the particles ? I can keep going on and on.  Answer : Humans are not real since there is no evidence of their evolution.  Would you accept the above argument. ?  If I tell you Who Created God, then you would say Who created the one who created God and it would go on and on.  We know God is real, since we are real. If you deny God, then you have to deny your own existence, which is impossible. No matter how knowledgable or intelligent you are, you cannot deny that there has to be a supernatural force that has created our planet and our body and, that creator is God.      In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"    The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.    There are a lot more chapters and verses mentioned in the below website along with music, speeches and praise and worship.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    Jesus is God. He is alive forever.    The questions usually asked are:-    1) Did Jesus really exist?  2) Is Jesus God?  3) If Jesus is God, then why did He keep praying to the Father in Heaven? How can the Father and Jesus be one God? Why did Jesus have to suffer on the Cross?  4) What is the Holy Spirit?  5) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?      It would not be possible to give a short answer to these questions .    I suggest you visit the below website.    After visiting the below website, you would get a lot of answers.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus  specifically.)  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became  flesh (John 1:1-14)  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as  "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT  (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)  16. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) and "God" also be called the  Mighty God in Isaiah 10:21  17. Jesus is able to raise Himself from the dead (John 2:19-21)  18. Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things  by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship  is used in each place.)  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts  7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father  that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John  8:58.  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see  Exodus 3:14.  23.

Jesus forgives sins (Luke 5:20) (Luke 24:47,Acts 10:43) .Only God can forgive sins.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com|`|0yTM98Odaa	No!  That's abusing grace, those who are born again don't abuse the grace given to us a gift from God.  I certainly don't feel I can sin all I want, I don't like sin and know it separates me from God so I try and avoid sin all the time but since I'm not perfect I will still commit sins in my life but not on purpose and I like all people suffer with temptation.      Jesus died and rose again so we can have forgiveness of our sins and not have to suffer the punishment not so we can sin all we like.|`|AA10744471	Sin is sin. There is no forgiveness if there is no repentance and compensation. Don't believe that bull that in the last minute you could be saved by just spouting the words, "I believe in Jesus, I'm so sorry for my sins," and then you are in heaven when you die. That is a lot of crap.|`|iblT1HJpaa	Yes, God will forgive - "7 x 77 times..."   However, one must also remember that God is a God of Wrath and at that time when Jesus Christ sits on the Judgment Seat - He will call out to judge the "living and the dead."   By His own word - it's called the Law of Sowing and Reaping. You will reap what you have sown throughout your life.   Will God indeed forgive you of your sins when you have TOLD Him that you will repent of those sins and ask for forgiveness and you continually LIE to Him? For you do not repent and you do not turn away from it and you seek the counsel of satan instead of the Lord. You either "look" to the Lord or you turn away and "look" to satan. Which way do wish to walk? The path is narrow and the gate is small and few will find it. (Mat 7:13...)   Homosexuality is just another sin. We all sin. We all TRY to turn from sin - what is yours?   Romans 8 tells the whole story.|`|s40sgQ45aa	No, that is not how it works.  God knows the secrets of the heart.      We are to repent (turn away from sin).  Even homosexuals need to repent (turn away from their sin).|`|QDFj9JPfaa	...I see you know very little about God and His Word...    (*God will NOT be mocked...)  There is a place where God will turn and NOT look upon you any more.  You will become a Reprobate and not blessed by Salvation. **Taking the Lords Name in vain also means more then just cursing His Name... it means using it in vain as well as trying to justify "your" sin with His Benevolence.  Many will say:  "Lord, Lord...haven't we done this and that...and The Lord will say: "depart from me, I never knew you"...|`|x81bKkFqaa	No, not really but some Christians view it that way.        As you can see so far by the answers already given you're probably confused. Some say yes and some say no. They can't agree on anything much less know a "real christian" is.|`|6RiLrsuBaa	No, you have to mean it, and if you're sinning with the intention of repenting right before you die, you don't really mean it.    The whole thing about gays, though is pretty silly.  That's one reason I'm not a Christian.|`|NSbU041Caa	it depends if you are truly sorry for the things you do, to put it simply.|`|OT4SrmDXaa	No it does not say that in scripture. Yes anyone can repent on their deathbed but guess what you don't know when that will be!!!!!!    Second God will see though a fool and if there don't realy repent there going to die on there deathbed and go to hell. Do you realy think God is that stupid to fall for phoney repentance?    Besides that once you take the mark of the beast theres no chance to repent then no repentance is possible.|`|ec5e2cfdd5364a1a67d973613c5d9480aa	If you truly are a Christian, you cannot go on sinning as you did before. The Holy Spirit continually prompts you to stop for it grieves him when you do sin.  If you continue, it is possible to put out the warmth He gives you.    If you confess your sins and repent (repent being the key word here) then your sins are forgiven.      If you have a serious problem with a particular sin, then ask Jesus to get the sin out of your life. If you ask sincerely and want to do as He tells you to with new opportunities to stop the sinning, you'll be forgiven and blessed.    I don't get the connection either why homosexuals are treated so badly or even killed for their sexual sins while gluttonous, drunkard, and lying behaviors are overlooked by people in the Christian community.      Look at America's population in general. She's one fat heifer, yet the openly homosexual community is the one continually blasted from the pulpit. Now that one I don't get. My best neighbor is openly gay and the kindest people I have ever met were openly gay. The cruelest people I have ever met were obese or alcoholics or drug addicts and called themselves Christians.|`|hQDapmICaa	Firstly thank you for admitting that these are sins and secondly, God knows our heart, if our repentance is true or not.|`|2QuGuphYaa	You're leaving out a few goofy steps like confession and baptism.  But as long as you have done those silly things, you pretty much nailed it.    Being able to do that allows Christians a backup plan for all the filth they wanna live in during their life and them immediately get forgiven for it.  Whereas non-believers only have true forgiveness from their neighbors and loved ones and the idea that they should be kind and get it right the first time around cuz there is  no silly rule that will forgive them instantly.|`|YrW8QwVjaa	No, get a life freak|`|a7e4527ac6ed1229d8be6f0ca3adf702aa	No.    We are living human beings both male and female and should learn in our own life to be obedient to the Holy Heavenly Father who rules and judges righteously.    When a person grows up in age and becomes an adult in the   family, the person should accept a person of the opposite gender sex to be the life partner with the marriage relationship in the human society.    Read in the Holy Bible Ecclesiastes 8:12 - Though a sinner do evil an hundred times, and his days be prolonged, yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God, which fear before him:    Matthew 5:32 - But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery.    1 John 5:18 - We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not; but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not.    God bless you in Christ Jesus mighty name.|`|1xQQVFhFaa	hypocritical is what u call them.|`|VJ3Y4RwTaa	Some sins are unforgivable and being gay aint one of them, When you denounce and curse god thats unforgivable theres a few more.....|`|DJThkWRTaa	yes but as we all know death has the ability to come swiftly and it's a risk they are willing to take!

Yes Jesus die for our sins and the sins of mankind. But that doesn't mean that if we repent on our death bed we will go right to heaven. With sin comes punishment. God will forgive all sin but your soul must be pure to enter the kingdom. None of us are sinless and in order to enter we first must be purified therefore, Purgatory.  When a child tells a lie, and get caught by his parent, the parent forgives that wrong. But if the parent is a good parent they will take something away that the child enjoys for a time or sends them to their room, it's called punishment.   God as our Father does the same thing to His children (us), being a good parent He gives us a punishment.   This world would be utter chaos if we didn't run things this way. Why everyone would sin all the time with no one to care or try to stop them.  no rules no punishment. God bless you.|`|bkX0wiXcaa	Yes, but if you are a true Christian it is not that easy to sin. Life gets new meaning. It really feels like you are born again - you are a totally different person. Most off you only sees the people claiming to be christians - sit in church every sunday, some times even in the week, but when they are not at church or trying to preach to you they are even worst than the non christians. The perception is if you go to church you are a christian. It is wrong, you will know a true christian by his actions, not his mouth.
3ljf1xLlaa	I'm so sorry that you're getting disappointing answers. Lemme just tell you that Americans expect everybody to be like them and think they're always right. Their education system is down the drain and the kids barely get any punishment for their bad actions. They sometimes take it too far and get into other countries.     Anime is an animation so of course they're going to look like that. What's funny is that most Americans believe that all orientals are born with a darker skin tone. I have heard someone say "asia is closer to the equator", which is weird because northern china, japan, and korea are in the more northern hemisphere.    Don't let it get to you. This type of behavior is not surprising at all.|`|ncPdftafaa	hey i would love a japanese friend.|`|WlywfjG1aa	Human race has for generations together made a ethnic distinction and it has gone into their blood , bones and genes.

Look At Goku, Vegeta and all the other dragon Ball Z characters.  Look at all the Humans on the Pokemon show.  Look at Naruto.  Mario, Luigi, Peach.  Link, Zelda  Sailor Moon  Street Fighter series.    It's like they are obsessed with white people!

I'm really lucky that i'm an Asian/Oriental. I wouldnt want to be stamped as "white" or "black", thank you very much.....|`|emvIYyufaa	I think the people who are copying asians and are asian influenced are different ones than the ones who are dissing them. It's either that or else it's possible that they think they are not copying an asian influenced style when they actually are. I.e if they get something from Gwen stefani's clothing line they may consider it to be not asian since Gwen isn't asian but she is inspired by asian styles, you know? I guess the nerdyness comes from the fact that asians do get a lot of pressure from their parents to excel at school and such. There are also a good number of people who are asian that like anime, which is thought to be a "geeky" thing to like, similar to trekkies. Doesn't mean that all asians are nerds who study all the time and obsess over everything but there are enough of them to make people beleive all asians are like that. I've met asians that were very lazy and did bad at school and loved sports.    There are plenty of things that asians take from american and european influences as well. In fact, there are a lot of things that they openly admit they like about america and europe, especially cars and clothes. They take a lot from european influences. Anime, not so much. There are a lot of characters that may look big and buff or busty with off-color hair may not seem to be asian because they aren't skinny, scrawny or plain looking but some of the time, they are a projection of asians on a universal beauty standard. You may not see a super tall and/or muscular asian man but look at Yao Ming and Genki Sudo (MMA fighter, look him up) They are one in a million in the asian world but they are still asian. You also don't see a tall, busty asian girl too often but there are asian models that are 5'10" and up and there are asian bikini models with natural breasts larger than their heads. Once again, one in a million but still asian. And a lot of the time, the hair color is meant to show off their personality. Red hair doesn't necessarily mean european. It could just mean they are a hot-head or aggressive. Blonde could mean ditzy or promiscuous or trendy. Blue could mean shy, etc. It's very likely that sailor moon had blonde hair because she was a ditz not because of any european relationship.|`|NlWSj3OWaa	because they re so much more educationally motivated. they tend 2 get better grades have higher IQs and run businesses.

God created this planet to be able to heal by counterbalancing human/animal CO2 discharge with trees and organic plants which need CO2 to survive. And there are many other scientific reasons why our planet will continue to sustain life.     Humans are not a big mistake. "God don't make no junk!"  We are the crown of his creation. He delights in those who believe, worship & obey Him. He loves humans so much that when they wanted to go their own way and make a huge chasm between them &  their relationship with God... He sent His only Son, Jesus to make it possible once again for humans to be in a close relaitionship to God.     The sin in human's hearts is what Jesus came to take away... to give a new heart or new desire to go God's way. However, if humans continue to go their own way, God will not stand in their way. Because of this "free will" to sin, humans cause all sorts of pain to each other. Don't blame horrible death on God.|`|Oc7Cgi0oaa	What have we done to it?|`|n1eXQr5oaa	The World Will Live ON...

If the god is flawed, we can't assume that it would be regretful about what we have done to the planet, since the god itself would not be pure (flawed).    However if the god forsaw what we would do, it couldn't have been a mistake so there shouldn't be any punishment for us to fulfilling what had to become as it was foreseen.    If that god had the capability to create us, it wouldn't need our help in destroying the world. It would have the power to do it on it's own, without our help.

If I tell you Who Created God, then you would say Who created the one who created God and it would go on and on.  We know God is real, since we are real. If you deny God, then you have to deny your own existence, which is impossible. No matter how knowledgable or intelligent you are, you cannot deny that there has to be a supernatural force that has created our planet and our body and, that creator is God.      In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"    The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.

The questions usually asked are:-    1) Did Jesus really exist?  2) Is Jesus God?  3) If Jesus is God, then why did He keep praying to the Father in Heaven? How can the Father and Jesus be one God? Why did Jesus have to suffer on the Cross?  4) What is the Holy Spirit?  5) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?      It would not be possible to give a short answer to these questions .    I suggest you visit the below website.

AA11353245	Theories are scientific principals backed up by large amounts of evidence to explain observed facts.  Theories describe what we perceive through evidence and empirical study.  Science is always open to revision based on new evidence, as such theories and laws are mutable in the long term based on our understanding of the universe.    Now we cannot prove anything exists at all that we cannot perceive.  A bed in your room but outside of your field of view for example, you know it exists and is where you left it, but without observing it you cannot prove its position in the present.  Now apply that to something like god, you cannot observe god, you can observe the supposed result of its works, but all the evidence we have points towards more mundane reasons as to our existence rather than an omnipotent deity.     This is not to say that god cannot exist, as absence of evidence does not provide evidence of absence.  Only that given our current understanding of the universe and the evidence we have at our disposal that the existence of god is less likely than all other options posited by science.      Once more, this does not make your belief one way or the other inherently incorrect.    Now applying the layman's definition of theory imparts a very solipsistic  point of view.  That the mind is the only thing you can truly know exists and that everything outside it may (or may not) actually exist.  Which is a debate I'd rather avoid because it makes my head hurt.

If you think of life as strategies for success you having your religious views, which may be considered irrational by others actually help you more in life.

Since the same God who reveals mysteries and infuses faith has bestowed the light of reason on the human mind. God cannot deny himself, nor can truth ever contradict truth. Consequently, methodical research in all branches of knowledge, provided it is carried out in a truly scientific manner and does not override moral laws, can never conflict with faith, because the things of the world and the things of faith derive from the same God. The humble and persevering investigator of the secrets of nature is being led, as it were, by the hand of God in spite of himself, for it is God, the conserver of all things, who made them what they are.|`|O1xSW736aa	Science doesn't look for "proof", it looks for evidence.

Wade Davis, a Harvard ethnobotanist, presented a pharmacological case for zombies in two books, The Serpent and the Rainbow (1985) and Passage of Darkness: The Ethnobiology of the Haitian Zombie (1988). Davis traveled to Haiti in 1982 and, as a result of his investigations, claimed that a living person can be turned into a zombie by two special powders being entered into the blood stream (usually via a wound). The first, coup de poudre (French: 'powder strike'), includes tetrodotoxin (TTX), the poison found in the pufferfish. The second powder is composed of dissociatives such as datura.

So, just be a little more patient, things like Goths may be here forever, but trendy people are starting to see less Emo and more Electronica/Techtonic from France and more Grunge/Preppy looks as well.|`|NlWSj3OWaa	whats an emos?

They just don't blindly believe what they are told and often research, read and learn.  They find out 'facts' as opposed to 'beliefs".  An atheist is not afraid to question what they have been told or look for other alternatives.    What you're saying is no different to me asking    "What kind of psychosis causes Christians to blindly believe every thing they've been told without question?"    The answer could be "delusional psychosis"    But then we'd both be generalising - after all, most atheists don't think they know everything and most christian's aren't delusional (though that could be open to debate...).|`|e4tvh1d2aa	umm.. you are mistaken sir!  we dont know everything  we just know that something must have evidence to be believed    if i told you that i was born of a virgin climbed a mountain to talk to god  went to the ocean and swallowed by a fish, lived inside for three days  came out built a boat and let god flood the planet  lived for over 900 years and was crucified for doing all this, but it didnt matter as i came back three days later, you would not belive me  however each event  is something someone else did(supposedly)  if i replaced the story of jonah with jack and the beanstalk  when the bible was written  you would argue that the bean stalk is fully capable to hold a cloud city up    you are the people who think they know all|`|isxNUJlZaa	Atheists believe there is no god with the same conviction that you believe that there is one.

We insist upon applying the scientific method to develop an objective understanding of reality.      It is when people start asserting that they "know" something that is falsifiable by direct observation when we start getting into problems.      We are not omnipotent, we are simply animals that have developed large enough brains to think critically and compare reality with preconceived notions.  Humanity's biggest flaw is that far too often, people choose to believe that which is most expeditious.  It allows an individual to not have to stress and think things through.  This, combined with a desire to fit in with the rest of society has resulted in religion.  In Japan, everyone was a Shintoist because everyone else was a Shintoist those who didn't were arrested.  In ancient Greece, everyone believed in Zeus and Hera because everyone else did, those who didn't were considered heretics.  In Christianity, everyone believed in God because everyone else did, those who didn't were stoned to death as heretics or otherwise murdered in front of an entire village, and in the Crusades were slaughtered like animals, AND were threatened with eternal torment in Hell.    These are not reasons to believe.

Remember that you'll be 'moving' at the speed of thought unless you want to see the path between your sleeping body and that person or place. You can get back to your body instantly at any time by wanting to see it (your body). If it's difficult to remember what you wanted to go and see once you're "out", meditate during the day and focus on memorizing your target, and ask your subconscious to help you remember.  Remember that you aren't limited by time. After several present-day Astral Journeys, try out some ancient ones, and then maybe a future or two.    When you are fairly experienced at all of that, it night be time to look at some of the 'higher' layers of existence, the plane of causality, the River of Time, the Akashic Records....|`|FswuiOIjaa	try reading "seth Speaks"  by jane roberts and her husband.

The Goat herders Guide to the Galaxy was needed by rulers seeking to control the masses, inspired and conceptualised by Machiavellian-like advisors and written by scribes following orders.    It is sentimental speculation at its finest lacking any meaningful philosophy that was had by the Judaism that reputedly spawned it.    AND, it's filled with lotsa ignorant mistakes:   Bats are not birds.  Rabbits do not chew their own cud.  Rabbits do not have hoofs.  Pi does not equal 3.  The Earth is not a circle.

Some of the books are letters, some are songs, some are visions of what the future holds, and some are history books.     & I am answering your question with an intellectual POV, not a religious.     THe Bible does contain an amazing amount of non-fictional information. It contains an amazingly accurate time line. So on the contrary of the beliefs that the bible is a crock, whether you chose to believe the miracles and have faith in the word of God, the bible is real and not a collection of books made in order to cause a mass conspiracy.    Also the 66 books of the bible were all written in a time line of over more than 1200 years, by men of different origins who had never met each other (for the most part)...and amazingly enough, their stories seem to match up pretty well.|`|d8mJAuz1aa	Who Wrote the Bible - A Letter from God  Who wrote the Bible is a question that is undoubtedly asked by many who are familiar with the impact this book has made on people around the world. The Bible gives guidance in our journey through life to eternity, as well as leads us to a relationship with the God of the universe. It is a historical book that is backed by archeology, and a prophetic book that has lived up to all of its claims thus far. In light of all these facts, asking, who wrote the bible, is a vital question that deserves serious investigation and a serious response. The Bible is Gods letter to humanity collected into 66 books written by 40 divinely inspired writers. These writers come from all walks of life (i.e., kings to fishermen) and spans over a period of 1,500 years or more. These claims may seem dramatic (or unrealistic to some), but a careful and honest study of the biblical scriptures will show them to be true.    Who Wrote the Bible - Evidence of Divine Inspiration  Who wrote the Bible is a question that can be definitively answered by examining the biblical texts in light of the external evidences that supports its claims. 2 Timothy 3:16 states that All scripture is inspired by God. In 2 Peter 1:20-21, Peter reminds the reader to know this first of all, that no prophecy of scripture is a matter of ones own interpretation,  but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God. The Bible itself tells us that it is God who is the author of His book.     God does not leave us with just claims of His divine handiwork in the Bible, but also supports it with compelling evidence. The design of the Bible itself is a miracle. Written over more than 1,500 years by vastly different writers, yet every book in the Bible is consistent in its message. These 66 books talk about history, prophecy, poetry, and theology. Despite their complexity, differences in writing styles and vast time periods, the books of the Bible agree miraculously well in theme, facts and cross-referencing. No human beings could have planned such an intricate combination of books over a 1,500-year time span. Bible manuscripts (remember, there were no printing presses until 1455) have survived despite weather, persecution and time. Most ancient writings written on weak materials like papyrus have vanished all together. Yet many copies of the Old Testament scriptures survived. For instance, the Dead Sea Scrolls contain all books of the Old Testament, except Esther, and have been dated to before the time of Christ. Consider Julius Caesars Gallic Wars. Only ten copies written about 1,000 years after the event are in existence. In comparison, there are over 24,000+ New Testament manuscripts, the earliest one dating to within 24 years after Christ.     The Bible also validates its divine authorship through fulfilled prophecies. An astonishing 668 prophecies have been fulfilled and none have ever been proven false (three are unconfirmed). An honest study of biblical prophecy will compellingly show the divine authorship of the Bible. Further, archeology confirms (or in some cases supports) accounts in the biblical record. No other holy book comes close to the Bible in the amount of evidence supporting its divine authorship.     Who Wrote the Bible - A Question of Eternal Significance  Who Wrote the Bible is indeed a question that everyone must ask. If indeed it is the Word of the living God, then no other book gives us more insight into our lives, more hope for our future, and a true path to a relationship with God. Search the Bible with openness and honesty and see for yourself what the Creator of the universe wants to tell you!

O9omaIDAaa	Insects have six legs.  Spiders, and other Arachnids like scorpions, have eight.|`|7bbfUYUOaa	lol Awesome I never noticed that verse before!  So apparently flying insects aren't detestable.  Gonna have to disagree on that one *grabs fly swatter*|`|C1SOqQSkaa	Silly boy!

They are closely related to the seraphim.|`|EHozsofQaa	Why should that make a difference if it's spiritual or not? Insects ALWAYS have 6 legs!!! If they have more or less, they're not insects.|`|EzqX9ojdaa	So people in the first century couldn't count, either.  Wow what a shock.      (It depends on what they mean... insects as in arthropods have 6 legs.. arachnids have eight.)|`|y56BkEcMaa	uhhhhhh....................................|`|M7r8oaUzaa	well you probably couldnt catch them. if they had wings and four legs    this doesnt make sense|`|GqfEYnpsaa	Insects have three legs, there are no winged creatures that have four legs.

From:  The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition   | Date: 2008  | The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition. Copyright 2008 Columbia University Press. (Hide copyright information)  Copyright information    insect invertebrate animal of the class Insecta of the phylum Arthropoda . Like other arthropods, an insect has a hard outer covering, or exoskeleton, a segmented body, and jointed legs. Adult insects typically have wings and are the only flying invertebrates.    The body of the typical adult insect is divided into three distinct parts, the head, thorax, and abdomen. The head bears three pairs of mouthparts, one pair of compound eyes, three simple eyes (ocelli), and one pair of jointed sensory antennae. The thorax is divided into three segments, each with a pair of jointed legs, and bears two pairs of wings. The abdomen has posterior appendages associated with reproduction. The exoskeleton is composed of a horny substance called chitin.    Insects breathe through a complex network of air tubes (tracheae) that open to the outside through a series of small valved apertures (spiracles) along the sides of the body. In chewing insects the digestive system includes a muscular gizzard that is lacking in sucking insects. The simple circulatory system is composed of a tubular heart that pumps blood forward into the head, from which it diffuses through the tissues and back into the heart. The aquatic larvae of many insects breathe by means of external gills; some very primitive species breathe directly through the body wall.    Insect Species    There are about 900,000 known insect species, three times as many as all other animal species together, and thousands of new ones are described each year. They are commonly grouped in 27 to 32 orders, depending upon the classification used. The largest order is that of the beetles (Coleoptera). Next, in order of size, are the moths and butterflies (Lepidoptera); the wasps , ants , and bees (Hymenoptera); and the flies and mosquitoes (Diptera). Other major orders are the true bugs (Hemiptera); the cicadas , aphids , and scale insects (Homoptera); the grasshoppers and crickets (Orthoptera); the cockroaches (Blattodea); and the mantids (Mantodea).    Insects are found throughout the world except near the poles and pervade every habitat except the sea (although there is one marine species of water strider). Fossil records indicate that many species exist today in much the same form as they did 200 million years ago. Their enormous biological success is attributed to their small size, their high reproductive rate, and the remarkable adaptive abilities of the group as a whole, shown by the enormous variety in body structure and way of life. The mouthparts may be adapted to chewing, sucking, piercing, or lapping and the legs for walking, running, jumping, burrowing, or swimming. Insects may feed on plants or decaying matter or prey upon other small animals (especially other insects) or parasitize larger ones; they may be omnivorous or highly specialized in their diets. They display a remarkable variety of adaptive shapes and colors that may serve either as camouflage or as warning (see mimicry ). Some have stinging spines or hairs and blistering or noxious secretions, used for defense.
N8UwWt2Kaa	I'd say to definitely let them do all the talking.    They already know, which is awesome and it's less work for you. So if you do get into the "big talk", just let them initiate it. They'll probably just ask you questions so all you'll have to do is answer. I mean, it's not like you have anything to hide now! The only thing I wouldn't do is offer up information, don't say more than what needs to be said unless you feel comfortable enough to take the conversation there.    Good Luck!|`|zjzfWaGXaa	just let them come to you.     If they already know and don't have a problem with it then maybe it just isn't so big a deal as to need a big talk.    When I came out I kept expecting a backlash from my parents that never came until I ended up confronting them with it asking them if they were in denial or something. I got a big mental slap in the face when they told me that they just didn't think there was anything else to it, I was gay and that was fine and dandy but it didn't really matter what my sexuality was to them. Of course then I had to come out again when I realized I was bi but again it wasn't really consequential to them.     So maybe your parents are just cool with it and don't have any questions that need answering. I'm sure they care about you as a person just like mine did but being gay, bi, straight doesn't really tell you much about who a person is and that may be what they truly care about.|`|WY297lnLaa	Lucky you, my gf and i been struggling for many years w same issue and don't have the heart to tell family just feels not the right time.Im in a 3yr relationship now all is well both sides of family is great they have a hint but we dont talk about it.

xxEhpytpaa	I don't know, never heard of it being that way. is there a date on it. Anyway St. Benedict is very powerful. Don't loose it. There must be some book or something like a record of where it came from. I don't think the computer knows, it's only as smart as the person who programed it. You could try a book on his life, sometimes they have a picture of the medals they casted for him in that for info.Sorry, I couldn't be of any more help. God bless you.|`|d529cebfe13576f3ddee3e55b4cd08ffaa	I'm pretty good at hunting stuff down online, but I can't for the life of me find a hint of anything like it.    You might consider looking for an appraiser of religious items or medals, who might be able to give you some idea. Or a good medal dealer that might be able to do it.
3ETIU4lDaa	Dude relax just be your self, if your thinking about how you should acted or be it's not really the true you. They most likely will be curios about you and your country and that may spark of a conversation and a friendship.|`|5HcnqxKQaa	I agree with the other guy. Be yourself.    I think they'd probably be curious about you and your country. I'm sure they'd be friendly enough to ask you questions so you won't have to think of what to talk about.    It may help in being honest and admitting that you're a bit nervous (especially to the girls; it can be pretty endearing) about being in a brand new environment with none of your friends around.
iuyYfQHmaa	Nothing wrong with being a bit picky in your taste of partners. I'd suggest you move. You are an adult now, and can choose to move to wherever you might want to. Come to South Florida, and I'd be happy to introduce you to all of my friends. (and me, of course. lol.)  Peace!|`|AA11944162	Y dont you use like eharmony or something like that to find someone. You never know you might find the guy of your life/ur prince charming. But i suggest you get to know them a little before u decided to go out on a date or something. Take your time and chose wisely and im sure you'll find the perfect guy for you. =]|`|fdkegbwgaa	Sounds like you need to move hunny!  Also you need to go get some self esteem classes.  Can you go to college in a different town or get an apprentice job somewhere else?  Look into your options that way.

At least you'll be meeting guys for other than a quick f--k. Go have yourself checked out for all STDs before you start going to meetings and stuff. You might want to check out a gay friendly counselor thru the gay center. Maybe it would help with your self esteem. Be happy. Have fun. Be safe.|`|t7K7ETfgaa	hold out a few more years until you can more away, unless you can now.  go to a big city and you can meet lots of really great guys there. I know three gay guys personally and I'm just in highschool in a suburb.  so honestly, the closer to a big city you get, the bigger the population, the more people you'll meet. if you just get out there in the big wild world you'll meet a lot of great people.  and if you can't move away, may i suggest a road trip? just head over to a big city for a few weeks and get out there and meet people.  good luck!  and don't worry, I know a ton of people who are your age or older who are single and haven't even had many hookups in the past, so you're just fine.  you're young and you've got your whole life ahead of you. go get 'em!|`|f48gha45aa	You pretty much answered your own question.  The main reason you are not in a relationship is because you feel you don't deserve it.   You will have to fix that before you can ever hope to have a successful relationship.  Next you don't see any potential in the guys in your area. There are a few options, you can move, you can search in a broader area, or reconsider the guys in your area.|`|30PIgrYoaa	would you like me to call you a whambulance?
gcdMCAfqaa	I don't know. I'm first generation, and I feel like I belong here.     I get highly annoyed when people put down our country.

We are so lucky compared to the rest of the world.|`|wuIxDbosaa	Remember that great australian adage:    " Don't let the b astards get you down "|`|e32de2cabcb4724ac5bf8a46f28f0a4eaa	I'm American, but I've heard that there are a lot of prejudiced people in Australia (more so than in the US). Mostly prejudiced against immigrants who went there for a better life. And the Aboriginal people who were there before the settlers.

5HcnqxKQaa	Hmm, how about indirectly saying no?    For example:  - "Nah, I'm not really hungry."  - "Sorry, I got this project I really need to work on right now."  - "I'm supposed to see so-and-so for lunch."    But it's troublesome having to come up with all these excuses. Maybe you'd be better off telling the truth: "No offence, but I don't really feel like it."    If you mean it and say it sincerely, I don't think it should offend anyone (except for those of petty minds... >_>).|`|45u7BzCUaa	Just say no!  Why hurt someone else's feelings when your's is being sacraficed.|`|Mbj1qPAtaa	I know your problem cause my friend is like U... he cant say no even he wants to.. sometimes it s difficult to say NO and easier to say yes... but I M NO MAN... polite..never rude..but I WANT TO FEEL BETTER... and I say NO..cause all the others r very selfish and I Learnt to say NO THANKS..

101bfea0cfc2e9bab98441d37836406eaa	This isn't a gender issue, kid.     It's not even store policy.     It's the LAW.    You expect people to break the law for you.  It's not her fault that the law exists.  What you are mad about is that she isn't willing to risk her job and a fine so you can get a video game.    Apparently, guys who work in that store are stupid enough to take the risk for you. This girl isn't, and good for her!    If there's a sexist view to take on this, it would have to be that girls are intelligent enough to know better than to put their asses on the line for some punk kid, and guys are not.    It doesn't matter if you think the law is stupid. It doesn't matter if SHE thinks the law is stupid. It doesn't even matter if your mother or the store owner thinks the law is stupid. The law is the law, and authorities monitor this stuff. A cashier selling to a minor would get fired and fined. That is the fact.    It is selfish and rude of you to expect someone to break the law for your convenience.    The answer is simple.      Get your mom or dad to come along with you.    Why is that a problem?|`|AA10804824	Oh you poor baby. Your life is so hard. (sniff, sniff) Couldn't buy a video game...|`|RxBe4y3Waa	it's nonsense doofus!  so according to you she should have ignored company policy and put her job on the line because you had a gift card and had to have a video game that is too mature for you? sure, that's logical. write to your congressman, oh wait you're a minor and will not be taken seriously!!! and you wonder why! give us a break.|`|0kWsC3Uhaa	That is annoying.  Over-regulation is a problem in general, in my opinion.  It's like we need the government to tell us what we can and cannot do, just because of a few idiots.  Oh well, I'd like to tell you it gets better once you're an adult, but I can't, because it doesn't.  We still can't always get what we want because of silly little rules.|`|AM7CgQ4daa	I am sure if she knew what a well grounded mature person you are she might have made an exception.   However, she most probably saw a loud mouthed hyped up kid.    Edit:  thanks for the kind words.   Truthfully, there has to be a cut off point.  If they moved it to 16, then all the 15 year olds would complain, but i'm only 3 months short.     Get my point,  some one will always be unhappy because they are near the cut off point.   Ask your parents or older sibling to go in and get it for you|`|0e0a0f1828f99f87ea3d5e5bc8cbd46daa	Here's a tip. Order it over the internet, they won't be asking your age then.|`|C4BJ3yLWaa	They are attempting to curb the violence that kids get in these games.  That is why they are restricted.|`|KuXNYqa3aa	its hard life. poor thing. do you want a tissue, sweetheart?  need a hug???????|`|e800d2182f5490a71079dce72530ceebaa	Ok i'm not going to read through all your nonsence, you need to get to the point more quickly.  But, she was just doing her job.  Get angry at the game company or whoever made it 17+.  I have a job where I am not allowed to sell to under age kids, and I hate the little **** that come in and get all annoyed.  You are a right idiot.|`|5mCm2XTLaa	Maybe you should sell that gift card to one of your buds and try and use the cash buy the game. A lot places get real funny when you try and cash in gift certificates on account they keep closer track of those transactions. Then again you can always try and come back when the chic's off duty.     Yea it's a pretty dumb rule. I can see maybe wanting to prevent someone under 13 from buying certain violent games but by age 16 most people pretty much know what for.|`|2Om1LosMaa	This is just the beginning of your frustrations in life. There are some stupid laws out there and they were made because in most cases someone was irresponsible and it resulted in a lawsuit. Maybe that game is okay for you but a less mature 16 year may think they could really fly off the building or shoot up police cars because they did in the game. You will spend the rest of your life paying for others mistakes, get used to it. The only thing you can do is lobby to have the laws changed - good luck with that. I hope you will stand up for yourself and do try to make some changes in the world but be smart about it. It is not fair that instead of making people responsible for their actions they just take the privileges away from everyone.I could go on and on, if it is snowing and you know the ground in slick, you RUN to your car and fall, why is that the property owners fault? You can't clean away the slick can you, should you stand outside in the snow all day in case someone is careless? Get the picture.|`|Xnh2tmQlaa	Well there are just certain video games that would blow your sixteen year old mind.  Your brain magically changes when you turn 17.  This happened to me and I am sure it will happen to you.  The powers that be have decided in their wisdom that you MUST not see things that are nasty and unpleasant or sexual because you are too easily corrupted.  This would transform you into a juvenile delinquent or something.  This is the same reason they bleep words on YA! because we don't want you learning those rude words before you are old enough to handle them.

OT4SrmDXaa	I don't like psychiatrists in fact they are all Godless wackos who get off on torturing people. They hate christians more then anyone.      You brother has most likely has one of several factors.     1. He is being tormented by a Demon.  2. He has some thing psyiclaly wrong with is his body like a back injury which effects the spinal alighment. This causes pysical disorders, Look into sublaxtion. Every so called mentally ill person I have ever met has had spine injury. This effects your nervous system and changes the electric signals sent to the brain through the nervous system. It can rob feeling all over the body making you numb. Parts of your body won't function properly. Your brain stem is not part of your brain. Its the begenning of your spinal cord. When it is misalighed or has pressure on it, it can effect anything from depth perception, your ability to dream when yuo sleep, to emotional feelings.     3. He has some kind of disorder or tumor in the brain or something else I can't explain.      So if its not a demon and its all pysical then usally only a maricle will fix it if its something wrong with his body. If he obessing the devil will take advantage of this problem an torment him. The Drs won't give a damb because they refuse to study the human body the way God made it. The bible talks about a silver cord. This is referring the silvery white part fo your spinal cord. Its like a radio antenna signal beteen  the body an God. Because God made are bodys just like a machine.      I will pray as I have seen similar things to this in my life.|`|G9VBTg47aa	http://ie.youtube.com/watch?v=sDaJP9G4Q6...  This video series is very interesting.|`|PM23RDycaa	Never known anyone to be possessed even when I was a Christian. Your brother needs psychiatric help and soon. Praying and sitting around worrying will not help him. He needs help and soon before he does something to hurt himself or someone else.|`|mC4mnvGFaa	I think perhaps you need to take him to the doctor and ask him for help in dealing with the problem, Your brother needs psychiatric help, not prayers.|`|n1eXQr5oaa	TAKE HIM TO A PSYCHIATRIST HE HAS A MENTAL ILLNESS! THIS SHOULD NOT BE TAKEN LIGHTLY|`|vDcDnO7Yaa	There are several things that could be the problem...     1.  God will not hear the prayers of someone who is not saved.. unless it's a prayer for salvation. If you wanna make sure he's saved.. go to the website, wayofthemaster.com. Being brought up in a christian family does not automatically make one saved... neither is knowing the bible theologically nor just saying out loud the common sinner's prayer. It's a bit more then meets the eye.     2.  A spiritual leader (who knows what he's doing) must pray over him. He cannot pray alone. "Where two or more are gathered, God will be in there in the midst of them."      3.  If he's writing in an unknown language.... how do you know he's not possessed? It sounds dangerous... as if he needs some STRONG prayer of deliverance from being oppressed by the demon(s).     4.  If he in his heart is not willing to let go of the demon.. it will not leave. He has to be in agreement with whoever prays over him. They must pray with the authority of Jesus Christ over the demon. It will leave him alone guaranteed.... IF like I said, he is in agreement and there are more then one praying against it.    May the Lord direct you and lead you in wisdom as you & your little brother deal with this issue. In Jesus' Mighty Name. Amen!      P.S. All the comments that are being said to you about taking him to a "PSYCHIATRIST" are of the devil. Pass over those comments & ignore them. A HUMAN BEING that doesn't know anything about the "spiritual realm" cannot help you with anything in the "spiritual realm".     Stay strong in the Lord, look to HIM and not man.|`|yev2iWgWaa	if you are god conscious nothing in world can do any thing. when asked i do pray for anyone.  god be with you|`|91XGHfSaaa	Pick up your Bible... and smack your brother upside the head with it.

Sitting around and mumbling prayers won't do anything!|`|esdjKGeBaa	Well, first of all, you should call a priest. You can't really say if he's obsessed or possessed, but a priest might make the difference. Has he been hanging out with strange friends lately? Be careful and don't let him gang up with any satanic cult, GOD FORBID!   If he's really possessed, try to wet him with some holy water. This isn't just a cheap movie scheme, it really works. I've seen exorcisms, so trust me, it works.  However, a priest is the best way to go, whether he's obsessed or possessed, he's the one who can help you. Don't try to help him on your own, You don't know what you're up against. Please, please go to a priest. A good one. Old priests are better with this because they have more experience.   God help us all. Just have faith and don't be afraid of anything. God will help you! I have a priest friend and I'll ask him to pray for you. We'll ALL pray for you.|`|2RKPtuL9aa	There is no distance in the spirit world, if you are truly a born again practicing christian as you say you are and not just a Christian by the name of your religion then you have the authority to cast out any demon so do it from your bedroom so that no one can hear you do it and say: satan and every lying spirit who has been harassing my brother I loose you now away from Him and I bind you away from Him and I cast you into hell In Jesus Name for it is written that whatsoever I shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven and whatsoever I shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven amen. If by any chance your brother continues with this after you cast satan out then Jesus said: "some come not out but by fasting and prayer" which is what you will have to do is fast and pray for a day or two or three in order to effectively do this, have no fear they cannot hurt you, but if you are not sure if you are a genuinely born again christian then you must first Whisper this prayer to God so that only you can hear yourself and say:    Lord Jesus I ask you to forgive me now of all my sins and come into my heart as I now repent of all my sins and be my own personal Lord and savior and save me now from all sin and hell, write my name in the lambs book of life so that on judgment day I will be allowed to enter heaven for accepting Jesuss sacrifice of dying on the cross for me and I will not be cast into hell which  was not prepared for me but was prepared for the devil and his angels, I thank you now Lord Jesus that I am now saved and on my way to heaven because you are now in my heart as you have promised if I ask you to come in as you are not liar but are a God of your word,  now teach me all your correct ways and truths in which you would have me walk and make all my ways well pleasing in Your sight even as a sweet fragrance to thy nostrils and a sweet sound to thine ears In Jesus Holy Name, Amen.|`|1ec32bd76f3584208ce83bf42928a21faa	You need to take your brother to a mature Spirit-filled Christian who has the gift of discernment of spirits.  Only he can truly tell you whether you brother is oppressed/possessed by a demon.  If your brother has a demon he can cast out the demon in the name of Jesus.  If his answer to you is no then it is a medical problem that doctors can deal with.  God bless you.|`|x8zkUGWGaa	It doesn't really matter if the demon is real or not.  If your brother thinks it's real, the best way to help him would be to play along with it and call in a priest to perform an exorcism.  Or a person who can do a banishing ritual.  Then tell him that you can tell the difference it's made and that without the demon, he's like a whole new person.

He/she should keep their bias political or religious views and personal opinions to themselves not publicly soap box them to students.     Any teachers personal or bias political or religious views should never be discussed, used or mentioned as a tool, when they are teaching students.     Any teacher that does this, can loose their job and would never be able to teach students as a career.     Sorry but it's illegal and against the law.|`|JXMVNEQoaa	i agree with him, its a total load of crap. he spent 120 million dollars on an inaugeration when we our health and education system need help. bush only spent 40 million. what if obama put that extra 80 million towards funding for schools?|`|IJTcGIG7aa	I think it gives the USA way too much credit to assume that its ideals have ever matched up with action.    This was a country founded by the enlightenment, guaranteeing freedom for all men, with an economy founded in the institution of slavery (it took 100 years extra to break that).    The whole line about 'anyone can be President' may have always been the slogan, but the fact remains that the first FORTY THREE were old white guys, or that even now, Nintey-Some percent of the Senate are old white guys.    I can understand why people get emotional with Obama's win.    Your professor is taking the place country is now for granted, and ignoring all the struggle that it took to get here.|`|45u7BzCUaa	BOOO HOOO FREAKIN' WHOOOOOOO!|`|tRZ0DZtSaa	I completely agree with your teacher|`|U7sBZKUuaa	He is right.

Oh well, to each his own, right?|`|d6d6ba532d5982bcf991fac313dd88a1aa	Don't take it the wrong way, but that's exactly how it should be.  It does take on a special aura given the history of the obstacles African-Americans have overcome in this country, but your teacher's onto something.  After all, Dr. King spoke of a dream in which all men would be judged on the content of their character, not by the color of their skin.  In a perfect world, we wouldn't be celebrating it because he's black, we'd be celebrating it because it is a peaceful transfer of power from one group to the next.|`|8cXAf7lCaa	Sure, to some the race issue will be overplayed. HOWEVER, consider the families of the blacks in this country who were chased around with electric cattle prodders -- by the police-- for protesting their disenfranchisement. How long ago was this? Hmm. FORTY years ago. That's it.     Remember that these people this professor is referring to might be overreacting. But, he has no idea what the person has gone through in their life with regard to race relations. Empathy before judgment.|`|KNvNlr2maa	You are in college.  He is your instructor.  He was making you think.  That's his job.  Thank whatever god that you pray to that you have a teacher who wants you to think for yourself.  If you made it to college, you have been taught a lot of dogma!  Not always wrong, but not even right!|`|nyrXBf6kaa	I understand what he is talking about, however he should be understanding that not everyone is a rock like himself, & can always keep their emotions inside when you are happy/excited. I was happy when Obama won, however, I didn't cry. But before he won I did have a ominous feeling that majority of the American people were set in their ways or some may have been even raciest. So there was that thought in the back of my mind saying: "There's no way majority of the USA will vote for him." However, I was proven wrong... by a lot! Which made it even more exciting.    The thing to remember for yourself though is do not let anyone else ruin this historic moment for you. Enjoy yourself, & have fun!|`|8272JH3uaa	I agree with your history teacher completely.    To say that Americans are special to vote in a black president is ridiculous. By segregating and labeling Obama as black you are strengthening the fact that there is still racism in the world. Thats segregation. Black is in fashion.     It should be just like any other presidential inauguration because being black should have nothing to do with whether or not you will make a good leader.     It is dumb to be proud of the so called achievement of electing a black president because it SHOULD be Obama's skills that got him elected not his appearance or colour.     The world is appeasing black people.|`|xONW7FRFaa	i completely agree. first of all let me say that i am African America.    when i saw the inauguration i was happy but i was kind of upset that all those people that vote for him just because he was black and not on his policies. trust me, we have a big problem in America. since this is the country of immigrants, no one takes pride in America, which is sad. everyone has it's own culture and country that they put forward while discarding america. for example, us blacks don't give a flip bout america but our Heritage Africa, the hispanic would prefer mexico over america, and so on. it is sham-full that when you tell them, if you don't like it here go back to your country, they'll tell you that it's easy to get a job here, there is more freedom here, you can live your dream here, and you can get a good education here. yet, they still don't show any respect to the country that provides them with all of this opportunities.
czXaUPIlaa	You're referring to the stupas that were built in early Buddhism to house the relics of teachers such as the Buddha.    These large structures evolved from pre-Buddhist burial mounds. Over time, particularly in the rule of King Ashoka, these burial mounds became huge structures that not only housed relics but became focal points for practice.    Stupas came to have symbolic meaning for Buddhists. The shape of the stupa represents the Buddha, crowned and sitting in meditation posture on a lion throne.     The top of the spire represents the Buddha's "crown." The square at the spire's base represents the Buddha's legs and his body is the rounded shape. These representations were especially important during the early days of Buddhism, when the Buddha was not literally represented.|`|6QrnOBZVaa	boobies|`|yev2iWgWaa	sun looks round moon earth  even fetus in mother.s uterus foot ball basketball cricket ball  the whole universe is round shaped so why not a temple?

However, when listening to Edith Piaf's 'Non, je ne regrette rien' recently, I detected a definite rolling of the 'r' using the tongue against the palette.  Not that I think the Parisian sparrow had the best French pronunciation.
dRVB3dtoaa	Start reading the Bible.  You will find all answers in the Bible.|`|HWoLbR7Aaa	Pray for punctuation.|`|wlYcWaQ3aa	Most people who talk about God tend to describe Him and vilify Him according to the world in which we live. None of this universe was in existence before God made it, so doesn't it stand to reason that God is not limited by time, gravity, heat and all the other considerations He created? Our understanding of Him did not bring Him into being. It is He who made us.  Being afraid of what happens after you eventually die is not the proper reason for turning to God. Realize how much He loves His own creation, you and all those around you. Only then will He find your heart worthy of the sacrifice He made on your behalf.|`|K788nNsbaa	You should ask yourself why you should belief Jesus is God, while he is pray to His God.|`|9p2wQ21Aaa	The most rewarding and meritorious attitude is to approach religious issues with the spirit of a scientist who welcomes any evidence that may prove or disprove his theory (or a theory to which he may subscribe).       There are certain rules to be followed in religious research for the safety of any conclusion that may be reached.       1. Never embrace a doctrine when evidence stands against it, nor should one follow a principle without evidence.     If God wants a person to believe in a principle, He should make it clear and evident. He is the Most Fair and Just. He knows that belief is not a voluntary thing;      2. Never accept popularity at face value.    A religious researcher should not take the popularity of a religious doctrine in his society as an evidence of its truth.      3. Inherited religious principles should be examined.    Islam advises every adult to examine the religion which he inherited. Inherited religion, like any other religion, is subject to proof.       4. Doubters are not excused.    When a person is not committed to any religion and doubts the whole religious concept, he should not be satisfied with his doubt. It is his duty to protect himself and his vital interests in this world from any harm and damage. Similarly, he has the same responsibility and duty in protecting his spiritual interest from being damaged.      5. When you conduct a religious research,    let no one make decisions for you.   Do not rely on the judgement of any other person, even if he is sincere and highly intellectual.       "And follow not that of which thou hast no knowledge. Surely the hearing and sight and the heart, all of these will be asked about it." 17:36       "And if thou obey most of the inhabitants of the earth, they will mislead thee far from the way of God: They follow naught but an opinion, and they do but guess." 6:116       "And we have enjoined on man concerning parents.... saying: 'Give thanks to Me and to thy parents. To Me is the eventual coming. And if they strive with thee to make thee associate with Me that of which thou hast no knowledge, obey them not, and keep kindly company with them in this world. ' " 31:14-15       "God does not impose on a soul a duty but to the extent of its ability." 2:286       "And no bearer will bear other's burden .... " 35:18, 53:38       Thus, we can see from these five Qur'anic verses that Islam is not afraid of being questioned or analyzed. Only those who fear failure forbid free discussion of their religious principles and avoid examination by researchers.|`|vDcDnO7Yaa	Here's what you do...

Christianity, islam and judaism all pushed this same "god" upon people so their popes, priests, mullahs, rabbis and politicians could all hop into the shoes of this imaginary dicator and play "god" with millions of ignorant peoples lives.

Do people honestly have better things to pray about?|`|BAAehgWlaa	GOD REALLY CARE IF YOU WANT HIM TO TAKE CARE OF YOU|`|yqUgRG2raa	If you have to fear in order to do the right thing then you need to think a little harder. We die because we are born. You get one in order to get the other. We all suffer but it can force you to think about what is actually important in life. Do good for that will be how you define yourself. If you treat others badly, guess what, you get treated badly in return.  One person treats someone badly than that person treats another badly and it just keeps rolling. You can stop this tide by "turning the other cheek". Figure out what is going on and how to correct the situation. God is eternal which means God didn't come from something. You have to get out of the thought process that things come from somewhere. Science will tell you that matter and energy are eternal. Life and the stuff it is made of is in a state of constant change. Some change takes many lifetimes to see but nevertheless, there is change. God is the framework, the glue, the direction which all participate.|`|DXXpHKupaa	This is something you need to come to by yourself.  Let no one force you to be a Christian or an Atheist (a person who does not believe in any form of God).  You're at an age when you'll have to make many important decisions in your life, don't let this one be made for you.    A TRUE Christian tells you of the benefits of being one, not the punishments of not being one.  There are other beliefs out there too you know.    "All religions are the path to the same goal." -Gandhi    Just relax, and come to the conclusion yourself.  If God exists, do you think he wants you to find him and accept him from your heart, or does he want you forced to believe in him because of peer pressure?  If God does not exist, then what are you worried about?    I will not tell you what's right or wrong...do you know why?    NO ONE KNOWS!    Not one person on this Earth trully knows whether or not their is or is not a God!  It's all faith, one way or the other.  That's why it's up to you to decide.  Your Christian friends cannot prove to you God exists, and your Atheist friends cannot prove to you God does not exist.    No matter what the decision, it's YOURS, and never let anyone make it for you.    Peace and happiness,   Travis|`|74b388eca668facf7bdd1f57af916ab9aa	Read the Bible.  Don't skip any of it.  Read it cover to cover.  If it makes sense to you, believe.  If not, then there is no Hell and you don't have to sit around worrying about it.  It is very convenient for a religion to threaten you with eternal punishment for not believing: fear can clearly compel anyone to believe anything.  Don't make your judgment based on those threats of Hell, make your judgment based on what you understand about reality, and see if the religion matches reality.|`|9EFUVX7aaa	So you're going to establish your belief system for the rest of your life on what someone says here?

The most bad and stupid thing you can do is to join religion because of fear of "hell" or because you dont want to dissapoint your friends.|`|foJndaKgaa	God has always existed and he always will - that's why he is called a God.  Some things are beyond our little minds.  He is loving and he wants to be loved - but he will not force anyone - he has given us free will to chose good or evil.  Each choice we make has consequences, that's why there is good and bad in this world.  The Bible says the earth belongs to God but he has given it to mankind.  If we decide to pollute our water, how can we say God has not given us clean water to drink?  Give God a try in your life - he sees and knows everything we see and do (maybe that's why he had me to stumble upon your question).  If you simply look up to heaven and ask him to show you the path to him - he will!  He only requires that you have a little faith in him.  He will reveal himself to you in ways you never thought if you can just believe.  Its true that he sent his son to the earth to die for our sins so that his son's blood would cover our sins and we could be accepted into the kingdom.  If you can believe that Jesus came, died and rose again to live forever and that acceptance of him now makes you accepted by God, you are on your way!!!  The plan of salvation that God has provided is as simple as that.  Reach out to him today and you will never be sorry.
q6phm94caa	Hate is a strong word to use, but the stereotype American can get up an Englishman's nose for all sorts of reasons. They're better off, and don't appreciate it. They can't speak proper English. They wear ridiculous clothes and imagine they're Gods gift to women. They think they deserve to be rich just because they're hard working. They don't know where Africa is, or which two countries are linked by the Channel Tunnel. They think owning guns is a bright thing to do. They see foreigners as a threat to their safety. They like to elect really dumb Presidents. I could go on all day.     I worked in the USA for five years, and of all the thousands of Americans I met there were very very few I disliked. Sure they all have their weird ways and their differences, but when you live in an American community you soon begin to see why they think and act the way they do.

HiHQvqodaa	1. "?ubuk" has no meaning in Turkish slang, as far as I know. It actually means rod or stick rather than pipe. The Turkish word for pipe is "boru", which does have a meaning in slang.    2. According to this etymological dictionary:    http://www.nisanyansozluk.com/search.asp...    the word "?ubuk" is derived from Middle Persian "chobag", meaning stick or twig.|`|XvWotokIaa	?ubuk means stick or rod.  You can guess from that the double-entendres that can be made. However it is more usual to make puns based on eggplant (patl?can) or cucumber (hiyar).    The words for pipe are: boru for a pipe used in plumbing, or pipo for a pipe that is smoked. Nargile is the word for a waterpipe for smoking.

eYs8DpbBaa	A Christian is someone who believes in the divinity of Christ. If you believe this then you are a Christian.|`|AA10223196	I also find it hard to believe that my own family members who are non-religious, will go to hell for all eternity.  I think you are still considered a Christian.  It's not for us to determine where someone will go after death.  Perhaps there's room in heaven for all good people who love and help one another in this life.|`|wlYcWaQ3aa	How much of our own will can we force upon God? Must He conform to our own desires to be worthy of our affection?  There are many things hard to accept. Jesus said it would be like that.

I for many years thought as you do.  I did not really know the Lord on a personal level and I did not seek to understand Him.  We as humans cannot really with the human mind understand the mind of God until we walk with Him.  I hope you find Him along your journey.

IVy35SE2aa	it only has meaning to you!  And it does have all the meaning you want it to have
cNniG2L0aa	There is NO purpose; there is NO plan or 'meaning' to our existence; there is NO invisible sky critter; at best we are an accident in Time and Space.   We exist for the simple reason that we exist.  We are, at best, an accidental collection of loosely combined molecules responding to our environment ... no matter how sophisticated that environment may be or we imagine it to be.  At the end of 'life' we 'disperse'; we dissipate into stardust.  We may as well have some fun while we're here without all that paranoia stuff - thinking there are invisible sky critters watching and waiting for us to screw up.  ~|`|553d65e6b054bb10fd35c5dfbadb844eaa	To me the meaning of life is love. We are simply put here to love one another, care for one another and to love our universe. I strongly believe in a supernatural God, but I believe that is a choice and not a fact of the universe. I believe it is impossible for a religious person to prove "God" and it is likewise impossible for an atheist to prove there is no "God". We both make a choice to fit our situation. To me Jesus was a good example of a person willing to love his fellow man in every situation. One must admit that to love ones enemy is to be an exceptional example of the human species.  Of course on the physical side of mankind it seems that we are here to take energy at a high level of density and to disperse it at a lower level of density. That seems to be what the physical world is doing all around me. So we also seem to be a part of that cycle. In addition to the emotional and physical aspects, there seems to be a purpose that is evident. We seem to be dependent upon one another and that dependence manifest itself in a common path. That path can be called "evolution" or "creation" either of which seems to satisfy my mind. That evolution can either lead to a "God" like future or to an uneventful end. To me if there is a path there must be a purpose. Therefore I believe in an afterlife and in a creator of the universe and the path that I am clearly taking. I believe that this gives me a purpose in life that I would not have did I not believe as I do. However, I do not believe that others are on my same path or are required to believe as I believe. I think Jesus was an example of living his life in such a way as to inspire others to follow him. I wish I were such a person as that, but sadly I am not and never will be. I don't have what it takes. I don't believe a single racist, oppressive, hateful or nonsensical statement in the Bible. I do believe that it is the inspired word of God and is infallible taken as a whole. But it is so full of contradiction (as I am also) that it cannot be taken word for word out of context. Like the universe itself it is full of mystery that makes the working and understanding impossible and inspires atheist to believe it is simply a book of stories. I have felt that way myself. But in times of need, when I truly open my heart, I find the answers to my questions and food for my heart.|`|1V1PzEYZaa	42|`|YHmr7nvsaa	For me, it is to eat, drink and make little atheists.|`|XYTUAzzgaa	life is the universe's desire to think,touch,see, feel, hear, smell and taste.|`|uJO0MbShaa	Live and learn.

We are all individuals. I don't believe in or follow any religion, because that's just not where my heart is.   So, what is your passion? For me - it's writing. Novels, poems etc.  That's MY passion, my meaning.   I simply do whatever makes me feel good about myself, whatever makes me happy. That's why we're here.  I don't think we should be afraid of death, because it's all coming to us.  But what we should do is to value the life we've got, and make the best of it.     So, the meaning of LIFE? Ask yourself, it can only be answered within yourself, in your heart.    And then, there's another question, maybe what you were looking for.  What's the meaning of death? And I can't answer that, I don't what will happen, I can only believe whatever I believe, and I'm not sure yet what I do believe when it comes to that. It's too much for me to imagine, so I'll just enjoy life as long as I can, so should you.

There is a particular way of taking minutes - they are not usually a note of all the discussions that took place in the meeting, but a record of the decisions and outcomes of the meeting.    2.  To hold a meeting means to organise and attend a meeting; to have a meeting.    3.  To send apologies means to inform the organiser of the meeting that you will be unable to attend it, and that you are sending your apologies for your absence.    4.  To call a meeting is to ask for a meeting to be held, or sometimes to issue notice that a meeting is to be held and to ask for people to attend.|`|bibIAhN9aa	take minutes- to shorten your schedule by taking of minutes here and there    hold a meeting- to rely on a promise made a meeting you had with a friend.    send apologies- 'Apologies' in this case the ancient child of Greek God Zuse, to send him home means to look after someones child.    call a meeting- the sound a slave driver would make to encourage/ scare his workers 'a-meeeting!!' meant 'work harder you dogs' in ancient Egyptian.

q802CQnAaa	You didn't say, but I will assume you're a guy. With that assumption in place, it sounds like she is playing games with you. From what you provided, she's gay. Leave it at that.|`|533aec411376adde47ba86f66a0aa949aa	There is a difference between being physically attracted to someone and being emotionally attracted to someone. Your friend may be physically affectionate with you, but that doesn't mean that she takes an emotional attachment away from those encounters.    Think about jerking off to a playboy centerfold. You really aren't emotionally bonding at that moment, you are just physically expressing yourself. Emotional commitment comes from someplace else, and in lesbians, that comes from being connected to a woman. Some lesbians wouldn't spit on a man if he was burning on the side of the road, while some are very physically affectionate. Neither person has changed their sexual/emotional orientation, merely how they act towards members of the sex they aren't attracted to.    Think about gay men and straight women. Gay men can be very physical in their affections, especially towards women, but the woman doesn't take it to mean he's 'attracted' towards her.    If her actions are making you confused, tell her so, and then hang out with a straight woman who cuddles and asks for kisses and who doesn't make you confused. You and your friend will both be happier.
q802CQnAaa	Pursuing this girl will only lead to more hurt and disappointment. It sounds like she doesn't know what she wants. It is not fair at all of her to come on to you like this when she knows you obviously have an attraction.  Even if she ditches "this boy" today, she will most likely have one eye on other guys or girls. If you don't think you can be just friends with her, avoid interaction with her.

Must be "as good as" for it to be a comparison.    2. Neither are correct.  He asks whether someone can send the letter  He asks someone to send the letter    3. Who is smaller,Luc or Mat?  OK, but can only be used with 2 people in the list.  or Who is the smallest,Luc or Mat? OK. Also works for a longer list  or Who is smallest,Luc or Mat? Wrong    4. After few you must have a plural noun.  He has only a few letters left to write.    the second sentence (He has only a little letter left to write) means he has just one letter left, and it is short.    5. Critical is an adjective. You need to use the noun: criticism  He doesnt take criticism of his work very well    6. It is the "rate of exchange", or simple "exchange rate"    7. Rolling in the aisles: laughing a lot (thinking of people in a theatre laughing so much that they fall off their seats and are rolling on the floor between the seats).  Going in to bat for someone: supporting someone, and taking up their cause, speaking on behalf of someone.

FdVR7nvzaa	Funeral.  You can have many weddings but one funeral.  To me weddings symbolize a new beginning and funerals mean it's over. A wedding can also be looked at as a money grab and trivial because people will invite you just so they can show off and get a gift/money.  I'm not knocking weddings, I take marriage seriously, but the ceremony is really just the more expensive equivalent to the prom.  The emotions at a funeral are usually more sincere than a wedding because so many fake smiles get passed around at weddings especially if the in-laws aren't fond of each other.|`|D4Jr9gvbaa	I agree
W11nQzVPaa	Since the definition of transgender varies wildly your question leaves open a lot of space. Most people under that umbrella term are male crossdressers and transvestites and yes they fully function regardless of orientation.  If you are referring to a transsexual woman or man then I will also point out that they too are fully functional but cannot bear or sire children. Sexually they are much the same as anyone else. For transmen this is extremely expensive and not as good as they would yet desire but there is hope in the future as medical science improves. Also for a post-op transwoman even many OB/GYNs cannot tell.

qHEpR92Gaa	Mexico's Christmas traditions are based on Mexico's form of Roman Catholicism and popular culture traditions also called posadas. Over nine days, groups of townspeople go from door to door in a fashion reminiscent of when the parents of unborn baby Jesus looked for shelter to pass the night when they arrived at Bethlehem, and are periodically called inside homes to participate in the breaking of a gift-filled pi?ata.    Mexican Christmas is not influenced by American Christmas[citation needed] since it is filled with over 30 traditions found only within Mexican Christmas.    In many Mexican places, children receive gifts not on Christmas but on January 6, the Feast of the Epiphany, when, according to tradition, the Three Wise Men bring gifts not only to baby Jesus but also to children who have placed written requests in their shoes.    At midnight on Christmas, millions of families place the figure of baby Jesus in their nacimientos (Nativity scenes), as the symbolic representation of Christmas as a whole.    Mexican Christmas festivities start on December 12, with the birthday of La Guadalupana (Virgin of Guadalupe), and end on January 6, with the Epiphany. Children usually do not attend school on this date; and, when they go to their rooms, they find not only the toys but also that the Three Magic Kings have appeared at El Nacimiento. Since the 1990s, Mexican society has embraced a new concept linking several celebrations around Christmas time into what is known as the Guadalupe-Reyes Marathon.|`|b96fde92465dad4682565d6b50541297aa	Because tamales are delicious!!! =)|`|LfAIdU2Oaa	I can tell you why they have tamales FOR Christmas.

7608d8bbef666e373ac9050db58b0ce9aa	Jesus (Peace Be Upon Him) was a Messenger of Allah.  He was born to virgin Mary.  His birth without father is a miracle revealed by God.  He is also one among the one lakh twenty four thousand (approximate) Prophets sent by God to various parts of the world for the guidance of mankind from the time of creation of the mankind.  The verses from Holy Qur'an regarding the legacy and personality of Jesus (PBUH) is quoted below:-    (1) We gave Moses the Book and followed him up with a succession of apostles; We gave Jesus the son of Mary Clear (Signs) and strengthened him with the holy spirit. Is it that whenever there comes to you an apostle with what ye yourselves desire not, ye are puffed up with pride?- Some ye called impostors, and others ye slay!    (  ???? ??????  , Al-Baqara, Chapter 2, Verse 87).    (2) Say ye: "We believe in Allah, and the revelation given to us, and to Abraham, Isma'il, Isaac, Jacob, and the Tribes, and that given to Moses and Jesus, and that given to (all) prophets from their Lord: We make no difference between one and another of them: And we bow to Allah (in Islam)."    (  ???? ??????  , Al-Baqara, Chapter 2, Verse 136).    (3) Those apostles We endowed with gifts, some above others: To one of them Allah spoke; others He raised to degrees (of honour); to Jesus the son of Mary We gave clear (Signs), and strengthened him with the holy spirit. If Allah had so willed, succeeding generations would not have fought among each other, after clear (Signs) had come to them, but they (chose) to wrangle, some believing and others rejecting. If Allah had so willed, they would not have fought each other; but Allah Fulfilleth His plan.    (  ???? ??????  , Al-Baqara, Chapter 2, Verse 253).    (4) It is He Who sent down to thee (step by step), in truth, the Book, confirming what went before it; and He sent down the Law (of Moses) and the Gospel (of Jesus).    (  ???? ?? ?????  , Aal-e-Imran, Chapter 3, Verse 3).    (5) Behold! the angels said: "O Mary! Allah giveth thee glad tidings of a Word from Him: his name will be Christ Jesus, the son of Mary, held in honour in this world and the Hereafter and of (the company of) those nearest to Allah.    (  ???? ?? ?????  , Aal-e-Imran, Chapter 3, Verse 45).    (6) Behold! Allah said: "O Jesus! I will take thee and raise thee to Myself and clear thee (of the falsehoods) of those who blaspheme; I will make those who follow thee superior to those who reject faith, to the Day of Resurrection: Then shall ye all return unto me, and I will judge between you of the matters wherein ye dispute.    (  ???? ?? ?????  , Aal-e-Imran, Chapter 3, Verse 55).    (7) Say: "We believe in Allah, and in what has been revealed to us and what was revealed to Abraham, Isma'il, Isaac, Jacob, and the Tribes, and in (the Books) given to Moses, Jesus, and the prophets, from their Lord: We make no distinction between one and another among them, and to Allah do we bow our will (in Islam)."    (  ???? ?? ?????  , Aal-e-Imran, Chapter 3, Verse 84).  (8) We have sent thee inspiration, as We sent it to Noah and the Messengers after him: we sent inspiration to Abraham, Isma'il, Isaac, Jacob and the Tribes, to Jesus, Job, Jonah, Aaron, and solomon, and to David We gave the Psalms.    (  ???? ??????  , An-Nisa, Chapter 4, Verse 163).    (9) O People of the Book! Commit no excesses in your religion: Nor say of Allah aught but the truth. Christ Jesus the son of Mary was (no more than) an apostle of Allah, and His Word, which He bestowed on Mary, and a spirit proceeding from Him: so believe in Allah and His apostles. Say not "Trinity" : desist: it will be better for you: for Allah is one Allah. Glory be to Him: (far exalted is He) above having a son. To Him belong all things in the heavens and on earth. And enough is Allah as a Disposer of affairs.    (  ???? ??????  , An-Nisa, Chapter 4, Verse 171).  (10) And in their footsteps We sent Jesus the son of Mary, confirming the Law that had come before him: We sent him the Gospel: therein was guidance and light, and confirmation of the Law that had come before him: a guidance and an admonition to those who fear Allah.    (  ???? ???????  , Al-Maeda, Chapter  5, Verse  46).  (11) Then will Allah say: "O Jesus the son of Mary! Recount My favour to thee and to thy mother. Behold! I strengthened thee with the holy spirit, so that thou didst speak to the people in childhood and in maturity. Behold! I taught thee the Book and Wisdom, the Law and the Gospel and behold! thou makest out of clay, as it were, the figure of a bird, by My leave, and thou breathest into it and it becometh a bird by My leave, and thou healest those born blind, and the lepers, by My leave. And behold! thou bringest forth the dead by My leave. And behold! I did restrain the Children of Israel from (violence to) thee when thou didst show them the clear Signs, and the unbelievers among them said: 'This is nothing but evident magic.'    (  ???? ???????  , Al-Maeda, Chapter 5, Verse 110)  (12) And behold! Allah will say: "O Jesus the son of Mary! Didst thou say unto men, worship me and my mother as gods in derogation of Allah.?" He will say: "Glory to Thee! never could I say what I had no right (to say). Had I said such a thing, thou wouldst indeed have known it. Thou knowest what is in my heart, Thou I know not what is in Thine. For Thou knowest in full all that is hidden.    (  ???? ???????  , Al-Maeda, Chapter 5, Verse 116).  (13) And remember We took from the prophets their covenant: As (We did) from thee: from Noah, Abraham, Moses, and Jesus the son of Mary: We took from them a solemn covenant:    (  ???? ???????  , Al-Ahzab, Chapter 33, Verse 7).  (14) And (Jesus) shall be a Sign (for the coming of) the Hour (of Judgment): therefore have no doubt about the (Hour), but follow ye Me: this is a Straight Way.

His life was one of helping those less fortunate and teaching a doctrine based upon the ethics and religion of Buddha and Pythagoras.    To me, he is really no different from the Buddha: a figure to be admired for his revolutionary teachings.  Unfortunately, his influence was greatly abused (cough, cough, Paul, cough, cough).|`|3aVxJYf6aa	FOR 2,000 years now, much attention has been focused on the birth of Jesus. According to the first-century physician Luke, a young virgin named Mary was told by an angel: Look! you will conceive in your womb and give birth to a son, and you are to call his name Jesus. What did the angelic messenger say about Jesus? This one will be great and will be called Son of the Most High, he said. He [Jesus] will rule as king, and there will be no end of his kingdom.Luke 1:31-33.    Surely that is what mankind needsa righteous world ruler to administer earths affairs in a loving way! Indeed, long before Jesus birth, the Bible foretold: To us a child is born, to us a son is given, and the government will be on his shoulders. And he will be called . . . Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. Of the increase of his government and peace there will be no end.Isaiah 9:6, 7, New International Version.    A righteous government and peacewhat glorious prospects! But note that this government was foretold to be on the shoulders of a princethe Prince of Peacerevealing that the King over all, Almighty God, entrusts such rulership to His Son. So Jesus repeatedly called this government of which he would be Ruler the kingdom of God.Luke 9:27, 60, 62.    Early in his ministry Jesus said: I must declare the good news of the kingdom of God, because for this I was sent forth. (Luke 4:43) Jesus even taught his followers to pray for Gods Kingdom to come. (Matthew 6:9, 10) The journal Christianity and Crisis says that the Kingdom was the dominant theme of [Jesus] teaching, adding: No other subject was so much on his mind or so central to his message. It is mentioned over a hundred times in the Gospel narratives.      In what way do you think of Jesus today?      In what way do you think of Jesus today? Commonly at this time of the year, he is depicted as a babe in a manger. And it is true that he was briefly a helpless baby. (Luke 2:15-20) But is that how he should primarily be remembered? Think about it, Why was Jesus born as a human? Really, who was he?    Was Jesus the Son of God, the promised Messiah of the Hebrew Bible? the Encarta Yearbook of 1996 asked. Or was he simply a man, an extraordinary one perhaps, but a man nonetheless? Such questions deserve serious thought. Why? Because our very life and happiness depend upon how we view Jesus and act toward him. He that exercises faith in the Son has everlasting life, the Bible says, but he that disobeys the Son will not see life.John 3:36.    No Ordinary Man    After describing Jesus activities at Jerusalems temple when he was 12 years old, the Bible says that he returned home with Mary and her husband, Joseph, and [Jesus] continued subject to them. (Luke 2:51, 52) But after Jesus grew up, it became clear that he was not an ordinary man.    When Jesus calmed a storm-tossed sea, a frightened friend exclaimed: Who really is this? (Mark 4:41) Eventually, Jesus was turned over to the Roman Governor Pontius Pilate on trumped-up charges. Certain of Jesus innocence and moved by Jesus dignity in the face of cruel, unjust treatment, Pilate in admiration presented Jesus to the crowds, exclaiming: Look! The man! But the Jews replied: We have a law, and according to the law he ought to die, because he made himself Gods son.John 19:4-7.    At hearing Jesus referred to as Gods son, Pilate was fearful. He had earlier received word of his wifes dream about Jesus, whom she called that righteous man. (Matthew 27:19) So Pilate wondered who Jesus really was! Although knowing Jesus was from Galilee, Pilate asked: Where are you from? When Jesus refused to answer, the conversation soon ended.John 19:9, 10.    Jesus clearly was a man, but he was unlike other men in that previously he had been a spirit person, known in heaven as the Word. Then his life was miraculously transferred by God to the womb of Mary. The Word became flesh, the apostle John testified, and resided among us.John 1:1, 2, 14, 18; Revelation 3:14.    Why a Divine Origin Necessary    Before the first man, Adam, fathered children, he succumbed to sin. A rebel angel, who came to be called Devil and Satan, succeeded in causing him to disobey God. As a result, Adam lost his relationship as Gods son, as God said he would if he disobeyed. Thus, Adam suffered the consequences. He became imperfect, grew old, and eventually died.Genesis 2:15-17; 3:17-19; Revelation 12:9.    Describing the effect that Adams disobedience had on all of us, his descendants, the Bible explains: Through one man [Adam] sin entered into the world and death through sin, and thus death spread to all men because they had all sinned. (Romans 5:12) Sadly, we all inherited sin from our forefather Adam, along with its dire consequences, namely aging and death.Job 14:4; Romans 3:23.    Release from such consequences could only be realized by having a perfect father, one who had not inherited sin and its dreadful consequences. Consider how that new father, comparable to the perfect Adam, was provided.    The Needed One Provided    The promised Prince of Peace, as you will remember, is also called Everlasting Father. (NIV) His human birth was foretold this way: The virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son. (Isaiah 7:14; Matthew 1:20-23, NIV) Jesus did not have a human father, nor did Adam, the first man. In tracing Jesus lineage back to the beginning of human history, the Bible historian Luke shows that Adam came into existence as a son of God. (Luke 3:38) But, as we have learned, Adam lost that relationship as Gods sonfor himself and for all of his offspring. So we all need, as it were, a new father who is perfectone like Adam when he was creat|`|jW0VqZcOaa	Jesus "was" a Jewish carpenter.

To be a Christian, you need to accept Jesus Christ into your life as your Lord and Savior forever.

To accept Jesus into your life, you can say a prayer like this: "Dear God, I know that I am a sinner and that Jesus Christ is the sacrifice for my sins. I have done the following sins (state these out) and I pray to discontinue these sins. I pray to receive Jesus Christ into my life as my Lord and Savior forever. In Jesus' name, amen."

Air is  one of the Five Primodial existing divine elements that keep us survive on this planet Earth!  The others being, The Fire, The Earth, The Space (Aakasha) and The Water.

He symbolises the success of any major mission undertaken for the Peace and Prosperity of Man-kind- extermination of cruelty, immorality and inconsistency, duality and all bad motives that invade ones mind and body are controlled by the wise intellect and this is symbolized by Hanuman or Aanjaneya.    He is also the embodiment of Knowledge. Obviously we worship the ocean of knowledge.

ys3DHzDuaa	Assuming we are talking about the same God here, you should NEVER feel that He has turned his back on you.  That would just contradict what being a Christian and being saved by Him is all about.    No matter how good or bad a person you are, you will face trials and tribulations in life.  As a matter of fact, your whole life is pretty much a test.  So you're a good person.  Wonderful!  I am too as are a lot of my friends.  But nobody i know, including myself ever has a smooth road.  We all have our trials.  So you think God may have shown you where you should be and who you should be with?  Are you sure about that?  So you're telling me, your human brain is able to "interpret" God's thinking and know who, what and where you should be in your life now?  We can try to understand but we usually can never comprehend the big picture.  He's got the script to your whole life while you only have the script to the present day.  How could you possibly know where it should lead and end?  You sound more like you have a lack of faith than God turning his back on you.

Whoever came up with this stupid story should try the chalk test first.|`|7d49ddbf3b36edeb5a77c20235621a44aa	ridiculous I'm supposed to believe in the god of chalk dropping ? try this one go out on the super highway alone and take your hands off the wheel and leave the driving to god . still believe in chalk?|`|AA11466759	I think it is an amusing anecdote.  Thanks for sharing.    The ones I know are rather dark, since they were born during the cold war when people were tortured for being Catholic (the Orthodox were left alone because they cow-towed to the communist regime)    For instance, one old man was told to revoke his faith, or they would kill his grandson before his eyes.  As he was about to open his lips, his grandson said:  "Don't lie, grandad!"    The kid  was shot on the spot.    This was not an urban legend.  This really happened.|`|EepiLrmZaa	this is not the first time this story has been posted. it means nothing.|`|7nO4pgIiaa	What ridiculous piffle.  A professor of philosophy would have abundant logical proofs supporting the nonexistence of god.  Why would he even bother with dropping the chalk?
w8D0ktFmaa	If you think this will "convert" anybody to your religion - epic fail. Delusional theists and other religiously superstitious people are ALWAYS in the dark.|`|5f80f1f151b797b394930ab7261f6128aa	Oh, you poor thing!  You're just not getting anywhere with us, are you?  I mean the atheists and the other nonbelievers...oh, wait...isn't the definition of atheist "a nonbeliever"?  Who are the "other" nonbelievers?  Do you mean Jews?  Do you mean Muslims?  Jews and Muslims certainly do believe in something.  They believe in God or Allah; they believe in something.  We've chosen the path we wish to follow; you can't convince anyone with little stories like this.  Well, maybe you could convince young children, but not adults...|`|Z0Vds9oCaa	Nice made up story.

Hooray!    /sarcasm|`|X8LNbaKQaa	I like this story of some person bringing technology to primitive people.  And I'll bet that the woman who first stepped forward will become one of the most educated people in her tribe and teach many of them.    This is a great story about learning new things about reality and leaving your superstitions behind.    Have you seen the movie "Quest for fire".  I liked it a lot for the same reasons.

It's basically a rehash of a movie from the 80's that I saw about human evolution.    But when I read it, I though of religious people huddled in the dark, shown the light of reason.

No. Will it make me believe in your gods? No.     Am I insulted that you imply atheists live in a cold, dark place? Maybe. But I consider the source.     Keep trying. I left behind all of that sort of stuff 40 years ago, and have yet to find any compelling reason to come back to it. Someday, one of you might make religion make sense.

By the way, I know another story about a cave that you should read...|`|7nO4pgIiaa	Holy spit!  Early humans were a lot smarter than we've been led to believe.

n4oOFWGEaa	It matters. In a business sense it is a good way to start networking yourself with people and can show that you participate in extracurricular activities. So if you are looking to put this on your resume it can be a great thing for you if your participated in things like leadership, taking a board position, etc. However a lot of people see the "apart from everything" that I think you already know about.|`|xpiGWrdMaa	no they're stupid and lame|`|4f2071ce0b3deda8b527470042c9a809aa	Not generally.

2tR5zKEuaa	Anorexia is Satans way of holding you in bondage which you should be free from. Anorexia is also brought on because most people are so desperate and addicted to being perfect which we can not achieve. It is trying to please the world. Therefore, I urge you, brothers and sisters, in view of God's mercy, to offer your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to Godthis is true worship. 2 Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God's will ishis good, pleasing and perfect will Romans 12:1-30 TNIV. He still loves you, but it is a problem.|`|DvoP2aawaa	While wasting food is a sin, you can probably not help it at this point in your disease, what god would want you do to (according to your religion) is to seek out help and try your hardest NOT to have this disorder any longer. As long as you are trying your hardest, then its not sinning, and god will forgive you.  I'm a lapsed roman catholic. Or agnostic, whatever way you want to slice it.|`|202da6e16e428763788627390b166485aa	Change your perspective on things.... stop looking at whos at fault.  Jesus died on the cross for us all.... and when He died He paid the price for all of our sins.... past, present, and future.  God loves you.  Talk to Him.... ask Him this very question and see what God says.  You just might be surprised.|`|EtCRnDJMaa	This is what I think, but I may be wrong.  I think that it is.  You are doing harm to your body, which may result in death.  If that happens, then isn't it like suicide then?   Would this be the same as a person who abuses drugs?  or a person who eats too much?     Sure it's a mental disease, that you get from a mental issue you have or are having in you life, that can be treated, not cured, but treated.  You were not born with this disease.  There are reasons why people are anorexic and why they became this way.  If they get to the mental problem of this disease it can be cured.      Who is to blame.  People in your life that somehow did something to you mentally.  For some girls it's the media, the super models.  they want to be like them.  For some it's about control.  If you have controlling parents you might want to control something in you life, this is the only thing you can control.  It's about controlling your own body.  It's kind of like bulimia, they also want to control their own life.|`|4GiIXWUXaa	I've dealt with eating disorders. And i would assume them to be my own fault.  The result of a choice that i made.    The % of men that deal with eating disorders is significantly less then the % of women; but some men do struggle with the disease.    Who said it was a "mental disease"? It is more behavioural/emotional than psychiatric .... anyways, why even blame God at all?     As of this moment i cannot answer your question. I have my own issues/thoughts on this subject; and i would not be helpful.    xoxo  ?|`|kxUigIkraa	Jesus fasted 40 days and 40 nights.|`|zYAQrnjcaa	I've never heard of it being a sin, however I suppose anything that does harm to your body could possibly be a sin. Basically, I guess I don't know. I've never seen it specifically stated in the Bible.|`|O3WYA3WGaa	Um, God didn't give you those illnesses.  Illness is a result of original sin.  There would be no sickness or death if Adam & Eve hadn't sinned.    So, no God did not give those to you.    Alcoholism is a disease, but the Bible condemns drunkards. It is your responsibility to try your best, get the help you need to get your anorexia under control. And, yes I believe not eating when it's available to you is a sin. Your body is a temple, and not eating is destructive to it, like gluttony, but the opposite affect. So, do you best and get the help you need. Reach out.|`|6jkusbCgaa	I think you are an anorexic simply because you have no sense of control in your life; controlling what you eat, or don't eat at that, is the only thing you can seem to manage. Therefore, you ought to find different mechanisms to deal with your no sense of control issues.     Nothing bad that you are experiencing is part of "god's great plan". You can rest assured about that. We are not born innocent, we are born with the ego intact.|`|AoACu48daa	Are you really as crazy as you sound, or are you just a troll?    If you are for real, I suggest you go into some sort of "religious rehab" where they can cure you of your religious beliefs first. Once you can throw off all that unnecessary guilt, your other problems will be trivial to deal with.
AoACu48daa	It's worse than that. Free will can actually be used to prove that the concept of God that most Christians have is completely meaningless:    http://www.gotatheism.com/freewill.asp|`|f2cadb13ef40dd19dbc25057af15104eaa	ok let me clarify for you,  God had the devil and his angles that rebelled against him in heaven, so God cast them out and made man.  So now before we can go to heaven God wants to see if we are like the devil and will rebel,   so therefore we have the freedom to choose whom we will serve,  God or the devil.  is that clear enough now.|`|WUjlEuTtaa	The law is there to convict every individual of their sins..Whatever those sins may be..The law states that the penalty for sin is death..

Matthew 13, John 6, and Romans 9  are about people God didn't want. According to Jesus in John 6, you can't even want to know God unless the Father is willing.      Why don't people look at what he said? God doesn't love everybody, and He also doesn't call everyone His children. So people on both sides should pay attention to that.    If you are not interested in knowing God, then He didn't want you either. This isn't anger, I am only telling you what Jesus said.|`|AA10233645	because he gave us freedom of choice and its your life. but if you do live a good life but don't believe inn God you will still because not believing is a huge sin and goes against   commadment  1 : I am your God and you shall not have any other gods besides me.  but you can still not believe, its your life|`|n1eXQr5oaa	obviously... i love you but if you dont love me.. I KILL YOU!|`|kxUigIkraa	Jesus said, "I set before you life and death. Choose life."     I understand what you are saying though.|`|d8zxbKduaa	God created the world and people for relationship. He wants us to manifest love, joy, peace, kindness, patience, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control. These qualities make the world go around so to speak and these qualities can only be fully acquired through a relationship with love itself which is God and Jesus Christ. If you say no to this God says you have that choice but the alternative is hell. Hell is ceasing to exist not an everlasting burning and torment in fire.|`|WTqeubeWaa	That's God's justice. He has offered the salvation but there is always people who choose the dark over the light.|`|79e4b3c6bff1c064ae45299e8ee84170aa	The Bible says the wages sin pays is death. once you die you've paid for your sins, their is no eternal torment.|`|db7df25ea31227e5641d5c32d43c3bcdaa	by your statement our government would be unfair    They tell us obey the law or else you get punished and go to jail and or prison.    So the government by your stated ideal is not giving us freedom. We are forced to obey the laws of our government if we do not we get punished.    The laws make you free. Yes it is still free choice. you either obey the laws or get sent to jail or prison. The choice is to obey or not to obey not whether you get punished or not.    You do not get to make your own choices obey the law and stay out of jail and prison or do not obey and go to jail or prison.     its the same way with God obey get eternal life or disobey and get punished.|`|PXnn6LoPaa	You already believe in God.  There is no "convert."  There is good in everyone.  You can choose to be a good  person and find eternal understanding if you want it.  Or you can choose to ignore that it is our responsibility to treat others humanely and if you choose that, most believe you will eventually suffer for it.  I think society is too caught up on "Christianity" or other religions and fail to realize that there is one God, but many paths.  The path of goodness and love will take your soul to bliss because if that is what you sought in your earthly life, then that is what your soul will likely continue to seek .  The path of hate and anger will take your soul to a place full of those kinds of things.  God is love, and does not want to control you.  You can choose love, and love will lead you to light.|`|s40sgQ45aa	Everyone sins.  The wages of sin is death.  There is only one way to atone for sin.  There is only one name given under heaven in which you can be saved.  You want to stand on your own merits?  You will pay for your own sins which is death.      God can not do anything.  God can not lie.|`|zYAQrnjcaa	You choose to believe or not to believe... to go to heaven or hell. That's the choice.|`|bJt3fFnraa	"so he lets you choose, but if you choose not to, you go to hell?"     exactly!!    You go to hell if you dont choose God because that means you choose SATAN.|`|dZMHd5PMaa	because the Bible says if you don't repent of your sin and follow God then you will go to hell. Just like if you walk into the gas station and decide to rob and kill the tenant. You know it's wrong and society's rule for killing someone is going to court and possibly spending your life in jail or facing the death penalty. You know all of this before you go into the gas station, but it's ultimately YOUR choice if you pull the trigger or not. Repentance of sin is the same thing. We know what we are supposed to do it is up to us to make the choice    EDIT  It's not that death is your only punishment. Hell is a never ending death and place of punishment and torture. It's death everyday. It talks in the Bible about the weeping and gnashing of teeth in hell.

The other person was bound and determine that they were right no matter how unreasonable the points they were using to justify their statements. Well, that is the same as trying to reason with someone that God's way is best and they try to use every excuse possible to either disprove the existence of God, or that God's way is not right in every instance because they don't understand.|`|2tR5zKEuaa	Yes we can choose. God doesnt want someone who only loves him because they have to.|`|9btru19waa	God wants those who freely choose to love him.      The penalty for sin is death. If you don't accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior, you will be charged guilty of all your sins and you will be thrown into hell with Satan, his demons and all the people who's names are not written in the Lamb's book of life and you will be separated from God and all that is good forever and ever.      If you accept Jesus Christ's free gift of salvation, you will be washed clean of all your sins and on judgment day you will be judged not guilty. You will be given a new body, the kind that lasts forever, that does not get sick or die and you will live with God and all that is good on the new earth. For God is doing away with this present earth and heavens. He is making new ones, and there will be no evil allowed there.|`|J31X7h3iaa	If you are deathly ill and the doctor offers you medicine that can save your life, you may refuse to take the cure.  If you hate the doctor, or hate taking medicine, or like being ill, you may continue as you are.  -- I'm not sure blaming the doctor is helpful, he didn't give you the disease.    EDIT>  I'm not sure where you are going with the "have to believe" or "have to accept".  Jesus already died for the sins of the world.  God already has offered you forgiveness.  If you don't think you need to be forgiven or you don't like the idea of being with God, you may go your own way.  (Jesus said he came for those who need a physician.)    EDIT>> Only physical death?  No.  Physical death is a consequence of spiritual death.  Spiritual death is being cut of from God.  Being apart from God _IS_ what makes hell "hellish" -- and it is what makes much of life here on Earth tragic and tearful.  Many of the selfish things we do that brings grief to us and those around us are a symptom of being spiritually cut-off from God.  God has called you back to him and will restore you.
256t9bIqaa	She was a poor representative of humanity.    Even the atheists distanced themselves from her.       I met her 27 years ago at the University of Arizona.   I was on the University's Speakers Board.   We invited her to come and speak on campus.   For 2 hours she spoke.   I still remember it.    What a miserable person.  She insulted people at the event.   She spit on the people in the front row.    She was so full of hate.   Everybody was turned off.    There wasn't anything redeeming about the event from any vantage point.       The Christians who showed up at Centennial Auditorium to debate with her in the Q & A session to be held afterwards, didn't even bother.      No one felt the need to confront.   We felt the need to run.    And so we all did . . . to Gentle Ben's, to the Rocky Horror Picture Show, and every hang out in between.|`|iqWfufpUaa	I remember when she rallied to have prayer removed in class rooms as she recognized other faiths or atheists/agnostics did not appreciate it.    She took on the system and eventually won - now it is up to the policy of the individual school board and their personal agenda if they wish to present it or not.

k6cXOxvtaa	Im so sorry!  I am 16 and lesbian.  You are probably a bit older than me; but I can still relate to what your going through.    You see, I came out when I was 15. Actually, i HAD to come out, because my sister blackmailed me.    Long story, blah blah blah.    But after coming out as gay, a few months later, i finally had a girlfriend. my mom and her hit it off! I was SHOCKED!! They had actually become best friends.      Since then, my gf and I have broken up. But I will never forget how accepting my mom was =) my advice to you, (oh, mystery YahooAnswers woman;) is that you should live your life.  Tell your mom when you are comfortable and ready (I regret coming out too soon, although it hasnt really affected anything).    Please, come out when you are ready.  And remember: Your parents will always accept you.    I mean, my mom was a homophobe, and my dad is Mormon. But, after everything, they both voted No on Prop 8 (we live in Cali) and they have accepted gay people.      Sometimes, things get awkward. But always know: You already HAVE eachother. How much harder can things get?|`|uD1UFdRsaa	Well you're both responsible adults aren't you? I'm sure once you both move in together, your parents really don;t have a say in it. You live your life for you and no one else. As for your gf's mum, she'll soon come to realize that her daughter's happiness is more important than her own pride and ignorance. All in good time. If she doesnt she's lost her for sure but your gf's always got you. Once you both move in together and the fire dies down a little, you both should have a good talk to her parents like mature adults and make it known you're love.     Let's hope it all goes well for you!|`|cxnrP97taa	there goes the neighbourhoood, stop being sucha drama kweeeeeeeeeeen|`|z5WNJkx9aa	I'm sorry to hear that you can't see her.  :(  If your g/f is still so young that she has to live with her parents, then there is probably nothing you can do until she can finally move out.      Are there not times during the day where you can meet her secretly?  Lovers' trysts are always romantic.  :)|`|HENHouAOaa	You know how your mom is accepting, and your parents don't know that your gay yet. Maybe if ur gf can live with you guys for now and when you have the money and a car, you guys can move out... I mean she's 18 and can move out on her own so why not move to your place first and then move out together later? it's better than not get to see each other at all, that's like the most horrible feeling ever. Well good luck girl|`|f9d76af854dd6350cec3b082d636c6a6aa	This is a lame idea but might work do you know a gay guy friend? If so have him pose as your girlfriends date since her parents are more close minded. He can come get her "for dates" and then she can go were ever with you. My mother did that back in the 70's and my grandfather (a minister) was like your "boyfriend" is very effeminate......... Ha ha ha plus his hair was much longer than that of the person she was really dating. Your bedroom business is not your parents business so I guess maybe not [comming out to them until after college] their opinions matter to your survival too much right now an until you both are financially independent their punishments and lectures will make you that much more rebellious|`|aOjMf5SPaa	So you need to pull your mum aside and tell her that she doesnt get to decide who is gay and who is not. I was chosen, and Im happy. Lecturing my gf will not make her straight, in fact I have to apologise and she likes you - except for the lectures.   Tell her you don't choose a harder life - but you'll work with what you've been given, and it would all be alot easier if she supported you.   Tell her that you love this girl and you have long term plans to stay together, and if you push her away, you'll push me away, and that's the last thing I want.     Lay it on the table, listen, and dont try focus on how hard she is making your life, but how wonderful her support and acceptance would be.|`|E4iUcYEjaa	I don't think your girlfriend should let your mom dictate whether or not she should come out of the closet.  You both can come out, but eventually her parents are going to have to learn to accept it (if she decides to tell her parents as well).  And in a year, when you two live together, you two won't have anyone else stopping you from having a relationship.    My question is how old is she?  Why can't she just leave the house or lie about going out and then seeing you?  If she wanted to see you, there are plenty of ways about doing it.    EDIT:  Well then urge her to hurry and get her license so she can see you then!  It's possible when you get your license, you can sneak into her room and possibly spend the night, but don't count on it.  It's easier for her to lie about where's she going and then going to see you (unless her parents are like mine and hired a p.i. to follow me...).|`|XoOanmdraa	this s.h.i.t happens all the time...all you have to do is wait because the more you ahve to fight for something the more you appreciate it in the end
G9R6VZOXaa	Went to a psychic fair couple of years ago.  It was generally full of theatrical fakes, with crystal balls, tarot cards and over-the-top mediums    Some of my friends had their cards read by these head scarf wearing fake Gypsies and were told very vague things.    I was sceptical, so I had my tarot cards read by a very plain and ordinary lady.  I kept very quiet. I was totally blown away by the accuracy of what she said.  It was spookily accurate and she told me a couple of things that made me shiver; she knew stuff I'd never shared with anyone.      She never mentioned marriage, or children and she kind of hinted that she knew I wasn't straight.    I would highly recommend anyone to go and make up their own mind about it all.  I was pleasantly surprised|`|i4Vt4YJ4aa	Sure if you have enough cash to waste on finding out then well and good, but make sure you don't tell your orientation before the psychics says it.|`|oiPrycbJaa	my guess is that since you will even ASK her to guess your sexual orientation would make it VERY obvious that you like girls.    So I guess just keep quiet and let her talk about you.    Do NOT answer any questions.|`|HENHouAOaa	yea i have and no they dont really guess my sexual orientation, but whatever they said to me was accurate. Don't be afraid, it'll be fine and fun when you get to know what happens next even if its bad or good. good luck!
FyLfEPv0aa	It's so sad that most Christians subscribe to the religion that 2000 years ago broke Jewish tradition and said:    -There are additional writings from God's true prophets available to us (New Testament Scrolls).  -Jesus Christ visited a group of people and we can read his words.  -There is a Prophet of God, like Moses, on the earth today (Peter or Paul).  -There is one church on the earth today that was founded by and led by Christ himself.    How sad it is that the herald cry of Christians is now used to try and suggest that our excitement in the same fashion as they held somehow disqualifies us from Christianity.    It's sad that the Book of Mormon is rejected without opening the cover.  More non-mormons on here take their guide to our religion from South Park than the Book of Mormon.|`|2wUvFmrhaa	Why would God choose a man like Joseph Smith??  Polygamy with many teenagers, a third were under 20.   Lying and telling the women to lie about it. Would God tell him to lie??   BIGAMY over and over again. Thats adultery in my book.     A con man, tricking wealthy farmers over and over again. He was searching for **lost treasure** on their property with the rock in the hat, that same way he translated the book of Mormon, think about that!   Brigham Young and other *prophets*  OH THE Lovely men GOD had chosen. The Lord's mouthpiece's? Really?? All the racist and hateful statements, and false ideas?    "Dear friends, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world." - 1 John 4:1    Quotes..  Journal of Discourses 6:25--"What!  Are Christians ignorant?  Yes, as ignorant of the things of God as the brute beast."    AND    Heber C. Kimball (First Counselor to Brigham Young)--"Christians - those poor, miserable priests Brother Brigham was speaking about - some of them are the biggest whoremasters there are on the earth..." (Journal of Discourses 5:39)    BIBLE..  Mormons mistrust the Bible because it is the book that refutes their doctrines.

I don't believe you can change things to suit your needs. If you want to follow the Bible you have to take the good with the bad.|`|7e2dad446deb31af0e15a02d4e75fc9caa	IF it were true yes it would be.

Can I make one more question,      WHY JESUS PRAY IF HE IS THE GOD?|`|Qy4k1w1aaa	I've got news for you--your little sales pitch is unlikely to bring any new converts to the Mormon Church. But since that's what Mormons do with their religion all the time--soliciting like crazy--I guess it'll just keep popping up here.|`|Tcu0NWkUaa	First let me say to Riverboat (above) "thank you" for your respectful response.  It is refreshing.    I, like Ender, believe very strongly in the teachings of God that Ender has presented by way of question.  I feel confident that there are MANY in the world seeking for those very truths.  Unfortunately, some have been blinded by the craftiness of men and know not where to find the truth.  Many have ears to hear, but cannot hear.    It is my testimony that God lives,  Jesus Christ is the only Begotten of the Father in the flesh and he is the Savior and Redeemer of the world.  It is only in and through Jesus Christ that we may return to the Father.  I also testify to the truthfulness of the fact that God has restored his true Church as promised and Joseph Smith was the prophet instrument of that restoration.    May God bless us all to see the Truth and give us strength to accept it.|`|QrUosz51aa	Most likely a false prophet.|`|0dcHegt4aa	Ender,    I see that you are a devout Mormon. Good for you my friend. I admire the zeal and tenacity of your questions. I wish that more young people would take the lead of the LDS church and send out missionaries... who go without regard for their future and livelihood to spread their message; however,  it is not the best message. It is a good message on the surface: Love and faith and family and love of God etc    The problem is that it is a little like meeting a hungry young man on the road on his way to the greatest wedding feast the world has ever seen. All are welcome, and encouraged to attend. To that young man an offer of another feast is proposed. Come this way! We have pot-roast, candied yams, salad, and a great chardonnay!     The point I am trying to make is this. The Good Book is complete. It is an ancient writing consisting of time tested manuscripts, thousands and thousands of exact copies of the same writing to verify authenticity, archeological evidences galore, uncountable collaborative ancient writings, and the story of Gods love from the creation of everything to the end of time. The historical record of kingdoms trying to manage, eliminate, alter, and ban this collection of 66 writings (the Bible) is unequalled in the entire world.     My response to your questions my good man/woman is that your eagerness and enthusiasm is wonderful, but spent of the wrong cause. The Book of Mormon, Doctrines and Covenants and the Pearl of Great Price are very recent writings which hold none of the battle scars and collaborative evidences that even the novels of the 18th and 19th century have to offer. One reason foe this may be because as a Mormon, truth is taught as something to be believed before it is understood, verified, or tested. This is why there is Mormon teaching about a burning in the bosom which verifies truth instead of simply what IS true.    I dont mean to encroach upon your dignity or try to overshadow your right to believe or practice whatever religion that you choose. I am merely answering your questions with the small insight that I have, which has been borrowed from wiser men than I.    I do not believe, upon a fair amount of merited and cautious study, that there is much virtue in writings of the Mormon Church, but where it strays from the simple and tried texts of the Bible it is simply cultic. There is just no reason to believe that the first collection of writings left anything out. Perhaps you should do as so many others have, including me, and read the Bible from cover to cover without the aid of the LDS church. You may find that you have discovered a true hidden gem in your midst.    **************************************...  Some of the follow-up comments would suggest that I do not make room for the prophetic in these days beyond the last writings of the Bible.     Not so.     I do believe that men and women can, and do, operate in the many gifts and callings that the Lord has for them. The catch is that everything must be weighed and measured by the original standard. The Bible is not made "truer" by the tests it has undergone... It has always been truth.     The teachings and texts of the Mormon church, those of Joseph Smith, would be welcome as would any subsequent writings of the faith, if they were consistent with Biblical texts. I have all of the texts of the Mormon church on my bookshelf. I will state this as plainly as I can. Mormon people are, for the most part, wonderful people, eager to do the right thing; however, the only redeeming qualities of the Mormon church are the areas where their teachings overlap with the Bible. This is the sweet spot of every religion in the world.    In all my dealing with the special Mormon people, it has become clear to me that it is a family thing. What is taught from infancy is not easily undone. THe ones who have come away from these false teachings have done so with much pain and tearing with regard to family ties.They do not generally change what they believe. I've put in my time and showed my Mormon friends the exact diecrepencies and flaws in their text... as plain as 1+1=2.    The response has always been... nil. People will always believe what they want to believe, regardless of reason, rational, proof otherwise, or even Truth. This isn't just a mormon problem, it is in all religions, and quite prevalent in the N. American Church as well. Many people believe blindly without seeing the big picture.    I don't pretend to weild God's Truth as if I understand everything, but I can see the path layed out for the believer int he Bible, and the Mormons are not on that path. It is a different path chosen by Joseph Smith. I would not take that path if I were you.    The N. American Church, LDS's, and the JW's would be alot better off if they threw away all of their "books" and went back to the Good Book, alone. That's just my opinion.|`|93fc57ca1c692acd2bd8f1bc7a446e6eaa	Ender's questions remind me of questions we used on my mission to Brazil 38 years ago.  The gospel is logically true in that additional scriptures have been made know to man as promised by the Bible.  Truths have been made known that have been hidden or lost.    For example, no mother can hold her infant in her arms, look at that baby's face, and then look me in the eye and say with a straight face that the baby has sinned.  The notion of being born in sin and going to hell without baptism is a foolish and false notion.  Infants are innocent before God, have no need for repentance, and thus no need for baptism.  Such an infant, if death comes prematurely, will be welcomed home to Heavenly Father's presence, just as innocent as the day they were born.  Many other gospel truths have been made known as promised by Amos, surely the Lord God will do nothing save He revealeth His secrets unto His servants, the prophets.  The heavens are open, revelation is available to all who seek it in faith, humility and sincerity.  May God bless all who earnestly seek the truth.|`|97f3e02ea0c61fb5033e4520729f2781aa	A great man I know had similar thoughts some 40 years ago.

1V1PzEYZaa	In Europe, most people accept evolution (possibly around 95%.)  In America some say only around 20% of people do (to the full extent), which is scary.|`|gSxYuDEEaa	THE TRUTH IS, no one truly believes the evolution theory.  The mind is deceiving.  They may think they believe it, but the heart/soul knows things the mind has no knowledge of.  God has placed within all people the hunger and knowledge of Himself as creator.  Consider Romans 1:18-20    18The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of men who suppress the truth by their wickedness, 19since what may be known about God is plain to them, because God has made it plain to them. 20For since the creation of the world God's invisible qualitieshis eternal power and divine naturehave been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that men are without excuse.     This scripture basically says that His existence as creator is in both the human consceince and creation itself.  There can be no creation without a creator.|`|c7pbvYmpaa	maybe 40%?|`|C1SOqQSkaa	Frighteningly high.

When I was younger guys were afraid to go near me in case I snapped- I was so skinny, because I was still growing, and I had no curves. When I went to university and put on some weight suddenly they paid attention!

I think a lot of white guys arent so comfortable with voluptuous girls though    so yes weight is important but only so as long as she is not fat and is thick. cause too many people can't distinguish between someone who is voluptuous and someone who is fat. i mean one thing is gaining weight and putting on fat, another is putting on weight and turning it into muscle going into the right areas like hips and butt.    lets put it this way this is what I call gaining good weight  anorexic aubrey oday(go to the 2nd page on the 1st link)  http://viewmorepics.myspace.com/index.cf...  voluptuous aubrey oday  http://www.smug.nl/2008/01/aubrey_oday.p...    she gained weight in the right areas and looks much better with round meaty thighs|`|0y1Mtcp0aa	a womans weight shows how much they care for themselves in my opinion. too skinny may be because they want to look good like everyone else and go about it the wrong way. too fat could mean they do not care about their body or themselves in general. though i am guilty of discrimination. personally i think there is a right way and a wrong way to go about making that decision. but i think to most men it seems socially right. meaning they want what everyone else wants like a fashion. as for being pursued. i think it a just a part of life. fighting for what you want. if you watch animals they fight for dominance. being pursued by women is fighting over dominance for a mate.|`|mBQQL0kCaa	i like my women atleast 200 pounds max,i like being pursued but i never really had girls to literally fight over me like that|`|2ydF6OTAaa	nah, it doesn't really matter to me either.

But if you are frequently having trouble sleeping at night then it's time for a check-up from your doctor. There are many causes and it's safest to let a doctor evaluate what's going on.

It happened to me when I was in my 40's, etc. & it still happens to me now & then. Sometimes, I take a little nap right after dinner, while watching tv. Sometimes, I have a concern or worry on my mind, & I just don't feel sleepy at my normal bedtime. (like last night & I was here & not in bed) The nice part, is that I can crawl back into bed & sleep as long as I desire.|`|5qFmukWwaa	I woke up at about 2 also and now its 4:20am.  I'll feel it later at work I'm sure I'll be slamming back the coffee just to get through the day.  Part of me loves this time of day - its so quiet and peaceful.  When everyone else is asleep and I'm the only one up it just feels like "my" time.

I've been to A lot of Anti-Islam sites.... and the stuff they state is either out of Context/misunderstood or From Hadiths that contradict the Qur'an, which means they are fake.    FOr example Hadith says: Kill all those that Leave Islam or Apostates or whatever. Proven fake, because in the Qur'an it says:    Quran: " there is no compulsion in Religion".    IN the Qur'an: It challenges you to create a Book like it, or even 10 sura like it.    I have found many contradictions in the Bible, I didn't even have to read it.... I mean they are so in the open for example: Christmas and Trinity.|`|WUjlEuTtaa	No, the Bible exhorts us to question and learn...

ALLAH bless you !|`|UmdKqP5kaa	Ok, we know we don't create each other and we don't come to this world from nowhere because when we die we must be going somewhere as well, hence there must be God, if there were many Gods, they would have fought over what to be created and what not to be, probably over who to die and who to live at the same time... so it's gotta be one God... if that God created us then there must be a reason... could we figure it out on our own? God made it easy and sent us messengers and prophets to show us the way and tell us why... so all the messengers and all the religions are from the same only God, so they've got to be complementary to each other, not opposing each other!!! then God must have said His final words in the last message, what is the last message? and how do we know it's the last one? I guess that would be the religion that believes in all messengers and all books equally... is there such religion? actually yes, Islam does :)  A God whose message never reach you or get manipulated before reaching you can't be God, how can he protect you or tell you to do this or not do that if he couldn't get the message to you? if he couldn't protect his messages from his own creatures?  That's why God meant to protect the last message eternally, because it's the one that sums all, and the previous ones are no longer needed.  A True Muslim (man or woman) gets his reward for obeying Allah's orders (Allah means The God in Arabic) by going to heaven, where he/she are indulged forever in all the good thing s that were on earth and more, things no one ever dreamt of or heard about. The Holy Quran tells Muslims (men and women) there will be good food, good wine and sex in heaven for all, but not in the bestial way you may think of, but rather in a way that is satisfactory for everyone and better than what was on earth. Heaven is no heartbreak or injustice land.  True Muslims are no terrorists, and Islam never calls for that, Islam means peace, it bans violence unless you were fought so you fight back, it only doesn't require Muslims to be cowards, and true Muslims understands this very well and never attack civilians.   Islam is the only religion that accepts freedom of religion and asks men to treat women gently like queens.  Muslims don't deny Jesus, they believe in him, love him and respect him so much.  We believe Jesus is NOT dead till today; he wasnt murdered or crucified as most people think. God made the man who betrayed Jesus be killed instead by switching their looks for a moment. Jesus was left up to live in heaven until the end of days when he will come back to earth, make justice prevail instead of oppression, fight the imposter and perform his last prayer before he really dies like other Prophets. So we're waiting for you Jesus, Messenger of God, to bring the world peace and pray with us. Thats what prophet Muhammad told us and this is what I believe in, Im a Muslim  so how do we know it's true? what is said in the last message and what should we do? read the following, and you'll figure out for yourself:|`|zY64xc6xaa	Yes.  You're SUPPOSED to test the Bible.  It says to.|`|2tR5zKEuaa	Well questioning your religion is showing lack of faith. But we are all human and it happens. Sometimes questioning your faith can lead to deeper questions/study which creates stronger faith.     If my book said to kill my first born I would not. But my Bible doesn't tell me to so I don't have to worry.|`|oTwymgpIaa	Well, I know if I don't understand something I ask questions, if that is what you are asking. Through asking questions I've come to a better understanding of some things that didn't seem logical, and the more I ask the more in tune with love and kindness the bible becomes, but when I first began reading it and didn't understand I thought it was barbaric. If I question it because I think it is wrong, I have never received an answer that did not suit my expectations, so I can't answer that question. As far as the Koran and Torah are concerned, I don't know if they are allowed to ask questions, but I assume not because they live in countries that aren't free which is more of a political matter than a religious one. ;-)

N4FqQmIbaa	"Petulant" is not commonly used.  You can use it to describe someone who is easily annoyed/irritated, or someone who is boldly rude.    Example: Every day the petulant old man yelled at children for walking near his lawn.    Explanation: Walking near someone's lawn isn't that big of a deal, and kids wouldn't know any better anyhow; getting worked up over something like that indicates that the old man is probably easily irritated (petulant).    Example: No one could believe it when the new employee called the boss "a fat, balding, good-for-nothing, low life" in the middle of a big meeting; how could he be so petulant?    Explanation: You'd think the new guy at work would be more careful, but publicly insulting his boss like that implies that he isn't shy about being rude (petulant).      Given all that, I've probably only used it out loud twice, ever.|`|mUK240ykaa	" "petulant" : 1599, "immodest, wanton, saucy," from Middle French 'petulant' (1350), from Latin 'petulantem' (Nominative : 'petulans') "wanton", "froward", "insolent," from the root of 'petere' "rush at, seek" (see "petition"). Meaning "peevish", "irritable" first recorded 1775, probably by influence of "pet"."    "a petulant toss of the head"    "Petulant moods." (Macaulay)    So remember : "Peevish Pet" !|`|wU0c3i7baa	When someone is being rude, abrupt and immature in one's impatience, they're petulant.     I remember it by thinking of the word pest, which is sort of similar, but I'm not sure that's helpful.     "Kristen Stewart actually plays a pretty good Bella, not nearly as whiny and petulant as the character in the book."|`|0XkIHnipaa	It means "sulking" and is a very old fashioned word, which isnt used much any more. An example might be "she was being very petulant".

God bless.|`|QyAyQf3Laa	I would say the most common misconception of Biblical doctrine is people like... YOU, who lack accurate knowledge of God's word, the Bible and Jehovah God also by making such broad but mostly incorrect blasphemous comments that "God rewards violence".    Jehovah God is all-knowing as he is pure and just in his actions. On the other hand, we humans are imperfect and do not have the right to take a life alone "on our own thinking".    Perhaps what would be best for you and millions upon millions of others is to allow a free home Bible study with two loving sisters from a kingdom hall hearest to you. This way they can sit with you lovingly and study the Bible and help you to obtain accurate knowledge about Jehovah God and his standards, and his requirements of us in order that we draw close to him in these last days.    It is that "accurate knowledge leads to everlasting life".    James 1: 12 - 15    Happy is the man that keeps on enduring trial, because on becoming approved he will receive the crown of life, which Jehovah promised to those who continue loving him. When under trial, let no one say: I am being tried by God. For with evil things God cannot be tried nor does he himself try anyone. But each one is tried by being drawn out and enticed by his own desire. Then the desire, when it has become fertile, gives birth to sin; in turn, sin, when it has been accomplished, brings forth death.   ------------------------    2 Peter 3: 8 - 10    "However, let this one fact not be escaping YOUR notice, beloved ones, that one day is with GOD as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day. GOD is not slow respecting his promise, as some people consider slowness, but he is patient with YOU because he does not desire any to be destroyed but desires all to attain to repentance. Yet GOD'S day will come as a thief..."  -------------------------    We are in the last days and soon there will be no more outcry, no more sickness, no more paying taxes, no more pain and suffering, no more wickedness period in the earth, and the last thing that will be removed is "death" itself.     Where are you?  -------------------------    Psalms 37: 1 - 13:    "Do not show yourself heated up because of the evildoers. Do not be envious of those doing unrighteousness.  For like grass they will speedily wither, And like green new grass they will fade away.  Trust in Jehovah and do good; Reside in the earth, and deal with faithfulness.  Also take exquisite delight in Jehovah, And he will give you the requests of your heart.  Roll upon Jehovah your way, And rely upon him, and he himself will act.  And he will certainly bring forth your righteousness as the light itself, And your justice as the midday.  Keep silent before Jehovah And wait longingly for him. Do not show yourself heated up at anyone making his way successful, At the man carrying out [his] ideas.      Let anger alone and leave rage; Do not show yourself heated up only to do evil.  For evildoers themselves will be cut off, But those hoping in Jehovah are the ones that will possess the earth. And just a little while longer, and the wicked one will be no more; And you will certainly give attention to his place, and he will not be. But the meek ones themselves will possess the earth, And they will indeed find their exquisite delight in the abundance of peace. The wicked one is plotting against the righteous one, And at him he is grinding his teeth. Jehovah himself will laugh at him, For he certainly sees that his day will come"..  --------------------------    EDIT: For the comment made by Reinadelaz, you have misread Romans 1 because it clearly shows that Jehovah God despises homosexual behavior and "gave them up to uncleanliness". It does not state he made them because homosexuality is detestable to Jehovah God; why would he make them?    Romans 1: 17 - 32:    ...But the righteous oneby means of faith he will live. 18?For Gods wrath is being revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who are suppressing the truth in an unrighteous way, 19?because what may be known about God is manifest among them, for God made it manifest to them. 20?For his invisible [qualities] are clearly seen from the worlds creation onward, because they are perceived by the things made, even his eternal power and Godship, so that they are inexcusable; 21?because, although they knew God, they did not glorify him as God nor did they thank him, but they became empty-headed in their reasonings and their unintelligent heart became darkened. 22?Although asserting they were wise, they became foolish 23?and turned the glory of the incorruptible God into something like the image of corruptible man and of birds and four-footed creatures and creeping things. 24?Therefore God, in keeping with the desires of their hearts, gave them up to uncleanness, that their bodies might be dishonored among them, 25?even those who exchanged the truth of God for the lie and venerated and rendered sacred service to the creation rather than the One who created, who is blessed forever. Amen. 26?That is why God gave them up to disgraceful sexual appetites, for both their females changed the natural use of themselves into one contrary to nature; 27?and likewise even the males left the natural use of the female and became violently inflamed in their lust toward one another, males with males, working what is obscene and receiving in themselves the full recompense, which was due for their error. 28?And just as they did not approve of holding God in accurate knowledge, God gave them up to a disapproved mental state, to do the things not fitting, 29?filled as they were with all unrighteousness, wickedness, covetousness, badness, being full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, malicious disposition, being whisperers, 30?backbiters, haters of God, insole|`|jW0VqZcOaa	That any portion of it should be taken literally...      There is "truth" in the Bible... but it is not "true".|`|8gi5gfOsaa	Probably the most obvious would be the 10 commandments.    The Bible does not list a consistent set of 10 commandments at all. In Exodus, the list includes 14 or 15 statements. Though the Bible does refer to a set of 10 rules, it does not mention them in the same sections. Different Christian cults have divided the list of commandments up differently. The Catholics combines the first 3 statements in to one commandment, and the Protestants combine the final two in to one statement. To add to the confusion, there is also another set of 10 commandments called the Ritual Decalogue which includes laws such as Do not cook a kid in its mothers milk.  How ludicrous does that sound?    Another would be Adam and Eve eating an apple, when in fact the Book of Genesis refers to them eating from the "tree of knowledge of good and evil". Back when the idiotic morons who promoted these books as guidelines to live by, most everyone referred to fruit as "apples".  Again controverted Christian belief.    Noah's BS Ark:    We all know that the animals went in two by two right? Wrong! In fact, all clean animals went in in groups of seven, and unclean animals in groups of two. According to Jewish dietary law, there are far more clean animals than unclean, so the majority of creatures entering the ark went in as a group of 7. [Genesis 7:2-3]    Christians are really blind people leading blind people, it is so sad to watch.    Whose Bible is it, anyway? The Christians or the Jews?|`|db7df25ea31227e5641d5c32d43c3bcdaa	God does not condone violence that humans do to each other to kill and hurt and destroy.    God does not reward people who do violence to other people.    The murderer and mugger and rapist are not rewarded by God.    what a terrible thing to say.|`|qMwjrQbOaa	I do not see any misconceptions of the biblical doctrines within it's scope. Contradictions arise on how we interpret.     If you analyse out of its scope, you will understand the 'God' concept is just one philosophy, where you cannot define the reality of nature only from a one view.    There are times, you will have to see from out-of-the-box to understand the real picture to give optimal solutions for some problems.|`|eO2rnf7yaa	I think one of the worst errors by Christians is teaching that Jews were, and by heritage still are, Christ Killers.   I'm a devout Roman Catholic and this just boils me when I hear it.     A careful study of Christian theology reveals that we are all responsible for the death of Jesus.  This is because our sins make it necessary for Him to have accepted death on the cross.    I'm grateful for what He did, and I hope and pray that all of God's creation will be reconciled with Him in eternity.   Peace be with you.    EDIT:   After reading Father Joe's response, I realize I missed the big problem., but I'm not sure if this is what he had in mind.    I think the biggest error is to take the Bible as the sole source of revelation.  It is a Catholic Church document, and ought to be read as such,  in communion with the Church.|`|kl1kzlzXaa	People will use any doctrinal framework to justify their nefarious deeds.

How can facts be kept straight that long? I try to think as a parent...if my kids sin, I have to punish them to teach them. I try to make the punishment fit the crime. Is it fair to punish a good human to eternal torment in Hell for not believing in someone who lived long ago? I believe in a just and loving God.

bF4HAvsZaa	If you live in the US, it is legal for your employer to ask you to take any given shift. Depending on the terms of your employment, you may have the right to refuse.     Chinese New Year is not a national or "public" holiday in the U.S.    If you don't celebrate Chinese New Year, and many of your co-workers do, it would be thoughtful for you to take a shift so that one of them can celebrate with their family.    It is not uncommon for say, a Jewish employee to offer to take a shift on Christmas so that a Christian co-worker can have the day off to celebrate.

t5Nrj6Txaa	You became enlightened by psychedelics disrupting your stream of consciousness.  In that brief freedom from causality your spiritual self was born.    Most people will never experience this, they will never ask themselves "WHY do I need the newest i-pod?", they will simply buy it.  When presented with pleasure, people will be drawn to it, when presented pain, people will shrink from it.     Those who brave discomfort in the name of virtue are not understood by such people, whether they are atheist or not.

I basically agree.  I think the reason is that some people find the moral lessons of religion very hard to follow, so they get sidetracked into looking at Scripture as if it's literally true.  It's the result of moral weakness and they end up looking in the wrong direction.  The literalist interpretation of Scripture is probably a fruit of the same tendency in Philosophy, so the rise of science and fundamentalism go hand in hand.  In medi?val times, the Bible was taken allegorically and there was no firm distinction between religion and the precursors of science.  Nowadays, the rhetoric of logic has become divorced from that of imagery and metaphor, and the result is polarisation.
dai4nP0yaa	Quite frequently. Most people regularly solve problems when they stop thinking about them. They say distancing yourself from the problem allows you to see the whole and find a solution.Most people of course do it without any forethought. Probably one of the most famous stories of this happening was Archimedes and his density of irregular objects (although the truth of the story is doubted)    I'm a little ashamed to say that although I have practiced doing it (to the point where I can willfully put myself into a state where my conscious mind gets out of the drivers seat long enough to solve basic problems, like where the keys are or what the answer to that question is) I do it only occasionally.    It's interesting to note that anyone who has perfected meditation has also found the state necessary to be awake while performing this activity. And another interesting thing to note is that artists often describe going into a similar state as they work.|`|OUbNSXjJaa	It is absolutely true. Our sub-conscious mind has great potentials. If any difficult problem arises, and we, as human beings, with our limited knowledge, if we are not able to find a proper solution, we can keep such issues in our sub-conscious mind. This facility is available only for believers. It will not work for non-believers. What happens is, at one stage or other our individual mind is connected to infinite mind (cosmic mind) and a proper answer/solution to our problem is sent even without our knowledge. When we look at the problem afresh again after some period of time, we will be surprised to find a novel solution.    It is my frequent experience. Not once. Everyday affair.|`|Xcri5qeTaa	I do.

That's a great question!    I do use my subconscious.  But I respect the fact that I can't "communicate" on a conscious level with it.  So when I ask for a problem to be solved, I don't sit there waiting for an answer.  Instead, I leave it alone completely and let it resurface on its own terms.      I have used "the power of suggestion" to subconscious to wake up, and I also use it to alert me when something I'm cooking is done.  It sounds silly, but it really works.  I could be totally distracted in the garden and suddenly at the critical moment something tells me the roast is done - and it is!  I've actually gotten up in the middle of a great movie thinking something's done, and the timer goes off right then.  Weird! :-)    The last time I asked for help was with writing.  I needed ideas but they weren't coming to me, so I left it for subconscious to mull over.  Then I got a feeling that I followed to pursue a sentence that seemed a dead end.  The feeling was that if I started this sentence, it would evoke the idea I needed.  Sure enough, before I finished, a great idea popped into my head.      Here's some good reads for you:    Mind Power Tips, Steve Goldberg: http://www.selfgrowth.com/articles/Subco...    It's a long-held mystical belief that conversing with subconscious is part of the path to enlightenment.  The mystics drew pictures of how it worked and today, those are called "tarot cards."  They were supposed to tell their secret wisdom only to people ready to perceive it, so they counted on the subconscious to process the symbols in the pictures.  That way the person would harness the subconscious and learn subtle things it's not possible to write down.  The images weren't even meant for fortunetelling as a matter of fact.

0BHiaVZ9aa	In The Name of God The Beneficent the Most Merciful    If any do deeds of righteousness, be they male or female,  and have faith, they will enter Paradise  and not the least injustice will be done to them.  [Quran 4:124]      In Islam there is absolutely no difference between men and women as far as their relationship to God is concerned, as both are promised the same reward for good conduct and the same punishment for evil conduct. The Qur'an says:    And for women are rights over men similar to those of men over women. (2:226)     For Muslim men and women, for believing men and women, for devout men and women, for true men and women, for men and women who are patient and constant, for men and women who humble themselves, for men and women who give in charity, for men and women who fast, for men and women who guard their chastity, and for men and women who engage much in God's praise, for them has God prepared forgiveness and great reward. (33:35)      The Prophet of Islam, peace be upon him, said, "Women are the twin halves of men". The Qur'an emphasizes the essential unity of men and women in a most beautiful simile:    They (your wives) are your garment and you are a garment for them. (2:187)      The Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, was full of praise for virtuous and chaste women. He said: "The world and all things in the world are precious but the most precious thing in the world is a virtuous woman." He once told the future Caliph, 'Umar: "Shall I not inform you about the best treasure a man can hoard? It is a virtuous wife who pleases him whenever he looks towards her, and who guards herself when he is absent from her." On other occasions the Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "The best property a man can have is a remembering tongue (i.e. which remembers God), a grateful heart and a believing wife who helps him in his faith." And again: "The world, the whole of it, is a commodity and the best of the commodities of the world is a virtuous wife." Before the advent of Islam women were often treated worse than animals. The Prophet wanted to put a stop to all cruelties to women. He preached kindness towards them. He told the Muslims: "Fear God in respect of women." And: "The best of you are they who behave best to their wives." And: "A Muslim must not hate his wife, and if he be displeased with one bad quality in her, let him be pleased with one that is good." And: "The more civil and kind a Muslim is to his wife, the more perfect in faith he is." The Prophet, peace be upon him, was most emphatic in enjoining upon Muslims to be kind to their women when he delivered his famous sermon (Arabic: khutba on the Mount of Mercy, at Arafat, in the presence of one hundred and twenty-four thousand of his Companions who had gathered there for the Hajj al-Wada (Farewell Pilgrimage). In it he ordered those present, and through them all those Muslims who were to come later, to be respectful and kind towards women. He said:    "Fear God regarding women. Verily you have married them with the trust of God, and made their bodies lawful with the word of God. You have got (rights) over them, and they have got (rights) over you in respect of their food and clothing according to your means."|`|XTUg4Uk8aa	no of course not they are slaves to their masters their husbands and fathers|`|nS7koC7Oaa	yes they are equal, Islam never discriminated between both woman and man and it's the only religion which granted woman's rights ^^|`|DO7lDtqxaa	We are equal but different. With different duties and responsibilities in life.|`|Izn1ye9Raa	Yes they are.  For men and women who give themselves wholly (to God); for believing men and women; for devout men and women; for truthful men and women; for patient men and women; for men and women who are humble; for charitable men and women; for men and women who fast; for men and women who guard their chastity; and for men and women who engage in abundant praise of God. For them (all), God has prepared forgiveness and a magnificent reward.(Qur'an 33:35).     "If any do deeds of righteousness whether male or female, and have faith, they will enter Paradise and not the least injustice will be done to them."(Qur'an 4:124)     Are Women and Men Equal?     Yes, defintely. Islam teaches equality between women and men. However, in some Muslim countries and socities a patriarchal culture dominates, and women are denied their God-given rights. Nowhere does the Qur'an state that one gender is superior to another. God makes it clear that the only criteria for superiority are piety and righteousness, virtues that only He can judge. "O humankind! We created you from a male and female, and made you into nations and tribes, so that you may come to know one another. Truly, the most honored of you in God's sight is the greatest of you in piety. God is All-Knowing, All-Aware."(Qur'an 49:13)     Islam recognizes women as individuals with specific rights. Among these are the right to life; the right to learn; the right to earn, own and dispose of property; the right to choose a husband; the right to a marriage gift; the right retain her maiden name; the right, as a wife, to her pre-marriage standard of living; the right to seek divorce; the right to inherit; and the right to a final will. Women, like men, are rewarded by God for a righteously led life. Does Islam want Women to be Public and Political? Most certainly. Islam not only promotes, but charges women (and men) with the responsibility of using their minds for good, preventing evil, as God's trustees on earth.     "The believing men and the believing women are protectors one of another; they enjoin good and forbid evil; they establish regular prayers; practice consistent charity; and they obey God and His Messenger. On them will God pour His mercy, for God is the Powerful, the Wise."(Qur'an 9:71)     Several Qur'anic verses chronicle female thinkers and doers, such as: Mary, the mother of Jesus; Bilquis, the Queen of Sheba who ruled justly and believed in the One God; and Aasiya, the Pharaoh's wife who saved Prophet Moses.     History also tells of many great women: Aisha, the wise teacher and philosopher wife of the Prophet, who taught people daily for 50 years; and Zubaydah, the famous builder of an aqueduct systme for pilgrims. In the first Islamic state in Madinah, Prophet Muhammad asked women to indvidually pledge loyalty (one person, one vote) to Islam and to his leadership. Women were expected them as they are expected now, to assume their rightful role in society as equal partners. Muslim women today work for the public good as activists, artists, entrepeneurs, leaders, scholars, scientists, social workers, and teachers. Muslim women excel in all fields, not in spite of their religious convictions, but because of them.     "And among His signs is that He created for you mates form among yourselves, tha tyou may live in tranquility with them; and He has broght between you love and mercy. Truly, in this are signs for those who reflect."(Qur'an 30:21)|`|zoH6rMCPaa	Men and women should never be equal in any faith.

A wife of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said: (The Prophet) never hit anyone with his hand, neither a woman nor a servant."    Narrated Abu Huraira: A man came to Allah's Apostle and said, "O Allah's Apostle! Who is more entitled to be treated with the best companionship by me?" The Prophet said, "Your mother." The man said. "Who is next?" The Prophet said, "Your mother." The man further said, "Who is next?" The Prophet said, "Your mother." The man asked for the fourth time, "Who is next?" The Prophet said, "Your father. "  (Book  73, Hadith  2)|`|MYN4VFJvaa	no.  men and women are not equal BUT they are similar.   'and male is not like the female' (Quran).  Islam gives men and women certain rights and responsibilities. none is superior to each other. each has their own role to play. science has proved that men and women are NOT equal in biological/anatomical terms. men and women react differently, and Islam has assigned each gender specific rules according to their inherent nature.    anthony b: yeah right, in your religion women are required to take over their husband's name b/c they are treated like property. in my religion, a married woman proudly carries her father's (her natural guardian's) name. if you dont believe me, search on how the whole taking husband's last name originated.|`|ORbFRn4oaa	Is an apple equal to an orange??

They have different attributes and thus different roles etc. They have their rights based upon their abilities and and responsibilities.

Just like Muhammad 33:50    A wife is a tilth (cultivated farmland) and you may go to your tilth as you wish. 2:223    When you draft a formal contract pick two men as witnesses. If few men are available, pick a man and two women. Two, because one of the women might forget. 2:282|`|zBqt99avaa	**I'm Christian**    However, no, men and women are *not* equal in Islam.    Nor should they be.    Men and women are not equal in any event.    I'm as smart and as capable as anyone, this is not what I mean.  In most cases, a man is stronger than a woman.  But it isn't just physiologically.  In talents, abilities, aptitudes, we are all different.  You are not my equal.  I am not Noub's equal.  We all have equal WORTH but we are not equal.    What would be the benefit of a relationship between two complete equals?  Who would do the jobs the other was poor at?  I'm happy to let Mustafa fix my wallet with pliers.  Of course, who suggested it could be done?  Me.  Does that make me less than him or him less than me?  No.  But we did different parts of the job.  Unequal.  But equally valuable.|`|UpIjgNV5aa	Men and Women in Islam are equal in every regards . . so men also have to be chaste just like women, men also have to be modest just like women. Men are also "Jewels" just like women.     It is merely cultural not religious. Qur'an has given women all the rights. Different responsibilities doesn't mean men and women can not do anything else. Prophet(PBUH) also worked at home and did the chores himself; cooking, cleaning, collecting wood, washing etc. In those times women had no freedom at all and were treated worse than animals. For womens protection that to give them more rights especially to help raise their children men were made bound to help women financially, it was for children not women.     Only other way men are women differ is Physical Strength. Men are also bound by everything women are, and women are also bound by everything men are. Both are equal in every regards and are free to chose how they want to live their lives. Women are by NO means inferior to men.     Trust me its not long when women in Islamic countries will demand their rights Allah(SWT) has bestowed upon them.     "And in no wise covet those things in which Allah Hath bestowed His gifts More freely on some of you than on others: To men is allotted what they earn, and to women what they earn: But ask Allah of His bounty. For Allah hath full knowledge of all things. "  [4:32]    "I shall not lose sight of the labor of any of you who labors in My way, be it man or woman; each of you is equal to the other" (3:195)    4.1] O people! be careful of (your duty to) your Lord, Who created you from a single being and created its mate of the same (kind) and spread from these two, many men and women; and be careful of (your duty to) Allah, by Whom you demand one of another (your rights), and (to) the ties of relationship; surely Allah ever watches over you.    Indeed, the Muslim men and Muslim women - the believing men and believing women, the obedient men and obedient women, the truthful men and truthful women, the patient men and patient women, the humble men and humble women, the charitable men and charitable women, the fasting men and fasting women, the men who guard their private parts and the women who do so, and the men who remember God often and the women who do so - for all has God prepared forgiveness and a great reward. (Quran 33:35)|`|ukJ0rk2vaa	Not really.....do you see the way they treat women in Islamic countries?!  0_0|`|Bi51WJd7aa	I know for a fact that in certain Islamic countries, women are far inferior to men. They have their basic rights (that we often taken for granted)stripped from them. They are often not allowed to drive, they have to wear only certain types of clothing (or rather ways of dressing), they must only speak when spoken to by men, and the ridiculous list goes on. But, the reality for many Islamic women is not so, thankfully. I live in South Africa and all my Muslim friends have the same freedom and rights, that I as a Christian possess.  I think it depends on those particular Islamic countries.|`|A5HPUGxraa	i'm a muslim i'll try to give you what i know.. i admit this is challenging i used (may be still) competitive but i'll try to be honest    first of all as humans:  ------------------------------  god told us we (humans) are all equal and the only measurement is 'obeying god' this is the only measurement in islam     for the marriage relationship:  --------------------------------------...  god told us that men the only criteria that make the man more powerful is the 'kawama' -this means taking the reponsibility to bethe head of the family make living and these things- and this aims at appreciating women -not demeaning them or so- appreciating the hard mission they are having concerning having a good happy family  you can search yourself what the society suffers since women went out for work (i'm not againt it i used to be workholic myself but after i had my children i found it will be unfair to leave them the whole day to work i made other options like working from home)  this was concerning marriage relationship     the 'equal theory' :  ------------------------------  personaly i find this word not suitable to describe the situation we are meant and existed to complete each others not to prove we are equal or not i find this a waste of time    let's return now to muslims and the current situation:  --------------------------------------...  there are some muslim men who appreciates women and respect them but on the other side there are some who think she is inferior than them and this has nothing to do with isla it is about old traditions (some families raise their kids and made them they can make anything but girls can't it is all about the culture and traditions)    so finally the conclusion to be muslims or not women and men complete each others the man is powerfull in certain things and women are powerful in other things (my husband cannot htink about tow things while i do make 5 things at a time laundry, children, my work on my PC, cooking, and what is being sain on TV and radio!!!)     just look how we were designed differently you will figure it out to complete you are good at that and i'm definately good at this simple isn't it    hope i could help...good luck|`|Wgsl0hVLaa	no, Allah says in the Quran    they are equal in terms of seeking the reward.|`|QDFj9JPfaa	..."he" is encouraged to have "4" wives and beat them if they disobey him...

Peace, and Namaste!|`|15b68e83c3ef9d01d0153600c96e7fe3aa	Look at it this way, my friend:    Let's say our Lord spoke to you directly and gave you everything you needed or wanted to live a long, happy, healthy, fruitful life. In return for giving you everything you needed to live such a life all He asked in return was one thing. He asked you specifically not to eat a specific fruit from a specific tree. He asked you not to eat the fruit from the tree of knowledge.    When you think about it that's not asking very much from you in return for all He gave you, is it? You can live forever and be happy and healthy as long as you obey a simple command.    It was a test.    Adam failed the test.     What I don't accept is the fundie mindset that it was all Eve's fault and the blame for all our misery should be placed on Eve. Adam had a mind of his own. He could have easily said no, could have easily accepted all God had given him in return for following the one command.    The real sin in the 'original sin' is in believing that hundreds of generations of humans are being punished for the actions of Adam and Eve. We are not born being punished for the sins of Adam and Eve. We all have the right to chose, all have a concept of moral right and wrong.|`|b8e321f3ad0d1eae90c1058863af7856aa	it was a test of obedience...and their life was at stake...they lost|`|u1vC5c77aa	***hand flies over my head***|`|By4HPyFyaa	too see if humans can fight temptation I would say. which apparently failed.|`|6c0c3f616204d91c1cc89db45e2c41d1aa	The purpose of the forbidden fruit was to test character.. jesus told him never to touch the tree or the fruit on it....

It wants ppl to follow celibacy in order to reach heaven. get it?|`|ZOifSvNhaa	The forbidden fruit was not sexual relations, as some have held. This view finds no support in Scripture. For one thing, when God made the prohibition, Adam was alone and evidently remained that way for a while. (Genesis 2:23) Second, God told Adam and Eve to be fruitful and become many and fill the earth. (Genesis 1:28) Certainly, he would not command them to break his law and then sentence them to death for doing so! (1?John 4:8) Third, Eve partook of the fruit before Adam and later gave some to her husband. (Genesis 3:6) Clearly, the fruit was not sex.    But the tree of knowledge was a literal tree. It represented Gods right as Ruler to decide what is good and bad for his human creation. To eat from the tree, therefore, was not just an act of thefttaking that which belonged to Godbut also a presumptuous grasp at moral independence, or self-determination. Note that after lyingly telling Eve that if she and her husband ate the fruit, they positively would not die, Satan asserted: For God knows that in the very day of your eating from it your eyes are bound to be opened and you are bound to be like God, knowing good and bad.Genesis 3:4,?5.    When they ate the fruit, however, Adam and Eve did not receive godlike enlightenment on good and bad. In fact, Eve said to God: The serpentit deceived me. (Genesis 3:13) Still, she knew of Gods command, even restating it to the serpent, Satans mouthpiece. (Revelation 12:9) Hence, her act was one of willful disobedience. (Genesis 3:1-3) Adam, though, was not deceived. (1?Timothy 2:14) Instead of loyally obeying his Creator, he listened to his wife and followed her independent course.Genesis 3:6,?17.    By asserting their independence, Adam and Eve irreparably damaged their relationship with Jehovah and inflicted sins imprint upon their organism, right to its genetic foundations. True, they lived for hundreds of years, but they began to die in the day of their sin, as a branch severed from a tree would. (Genesis 5:5) Moreover, for the first time, they sensed an internal disharmony. They felt naked and tried to hide from God. (Genesis 3:7,?8) They also felt guilt, insecurity, and shame. Their sin produced an upheaval within them, their consciences accusing them of wrongdoing.    To be true to himself and to his holy standards, God justly sentenced Adam and Eve to death and expelled them from the garden of Eden. (Genesis 3:19, 23,?24) Thus, Paradise, happiness, and everlasting life were lost, while sin, suffering, and death resulted. What a tragic development for the human race! However, immediately after sentencing the couple, God promised to undo all the harm resulting from their sin without compromising his own righteous standards.    Jehovah purposed to make it possible for the offspring of Adam and Eve to be freed from sins deadly grip. He accomplished this through Jesus Christ. (Genesis 3:15; Matthew 20:28; Galatians 3:16) Through him, God will eliminate sin and all its effects and will make the earth into a global paradise, just as he purposed in the beginning.Luke 23:43; John 3:16.

JiaGiVexaa	Thank you for this nice thought. I am muslim and proud and i try to practice my religion in peace. I never judge people or stereotype the whole for a few people's actions which are against the teaching of Islam. Islam is trully a peaceful religion. Some ignorants keep on spreading the same lies such as: we should kill all the infidels, however killing is the ultimate sin in Islam, exept of course in self defence. They believe all the non sense fed to them without once questionning their credibility. And they make false statements, as facts with no evidence where they got them from.  Some, though loose it, not everyone is as tolerant. People actually post insulting comments about Islam or make really racist comments without any reason, than ignorance. And when it keeps on happening, some do loose it. However, Islam teaches us to be more tolerant.   But i challenge any one to find a question by a muslim insulting another religion or the prophets, never, we are more tolerant and respectful to others religion and we see Jesus(pbuh) and Moses(pbuh) as the same level as Mohamed(pbuh), because they are all the prophets of Allah.  i admit that many christians ashare your views and are nice people, but you can tell that there are the few uneducated bunch who insults, but it only portrays them as bigots, racists and uneducated.  People who are educated as yourself do read and use their brain to decide, not let others and media feed their shallow brains. But now, many learnt to ignore them as this is the best way to deal with ignorants. Thank you again.|`|waz8ONEEaa	true, modern islamic beliefs are centered around a peaceful coexistence.    christianity has its share of violent scripture, as does the koran. its the extremists, however, that give moderate religious people the bad name.|`|lar1FyQBaa	i agree with you and for the most part, there are a lot of friendly muslims on here  but then there aren't friendly people on here.  i guess it's their personality.  i ignore the unfriendly ones because after all, it appears they are nieve and ignorant in a manner of speaking.    good question!|`|uJO0MbShaa	Don't agree.  Recently, a Muslim wrote that Obama was "going to die and his wife and two little girls will be all alone."  Another implied that all Western women are whores!  Nice, huh?|`|Lc8hkjHPaa	I imagine it's a different style of thinking about how your religion is the truth. The white yankee Christians are going to be more aggressive about their religion being the truth because of the decadent lives they've been leading and the comfort of having their religion run their country for the past while. They become angry at anyone who denies it. Hence all the questions about Bush vs. Obama, which I find simply ridiculous.  The Muslim maybe seems to be the minority here (based on   of questions seen posted), and they find it easier to use their heads to discuss, and learn.|`|505kdpepaa	You know I am so glad I clicked on this question! I see so many questions on here (perhaps even with the same title) that are so derogatory to Muslims. But you hit the nail on the head! They're lovely. The Muslims I know are all lovely too. It's part of their faith, to practise Islam the way that they do- Including finding a common ground and not forcing religion on anyone. Islam is supposedly the most calming and peaceful religion, and thankfully most Muslims practise their peace and tranquillity. I'm not a Muslim, but I certainly would be proud to be one.    Satsuki- You're talking about society, culture and tradition. Religion is something different. It's sad that some Islamic countries can't see past the end of their own noses, but you can't tar all Muslims with the same brush. The majority of Muslims in the UK are Pakistani, and although in Pakistan there are problems with crime (as there is everywhere!) and matrimony, the problems and issues are far less there than in Britain. And some countries do kill their own, but it's a vast thing to understand. They carry a belief that by doing so, they are preserving honour. In the Western world we know it's wrong, but that's just their culture and tradition. The question asked here was about Muslims, about the majority, and about religion.|`|U8gIdoXFaa	They are good people save for a few idiots. And it only takes one bigot, like up there, to point an idiot out. But bigots are idiots too.     Muslims are good people. Its only the bigots that dont know it.|`|bhd1KbxXaa	I don't know who you are referring to, but sometimes when you have to stand up for truth, people automatically get offended.  As far as I know, Islam claims to be the absolute truth along with Christianity.  I don't see a lot of reasoning in Islamic countries.  You aren't even allowed to change religions there.  No freedom of religion.  No freedom to share your faith.  Much persecution of Christians and others who don't hold to the Muslim teachings.  I mean they even kill members of their own family if they dishonor them at times.  If you were a Christian who lived in a Muslim country, your view would be very different.  At least they stand up for what they believe in.  I admire them for that, but I disagree with their doctrines.  Most people don't have anything worth living or dying for, but they do.|`|dai4nP0yaa	Well it's more about individuals than about what religions they belong to. It's probably true that the majority of muslims on here are reasonable people, but it's probably also true that the majority of any other religion on here are reasonable people. It's just the aggressive people tend to be way more active.    However very aggressive muslims tend to withdraw from communities that have non-muslim members with the result that there are fewer aggressive muslims in most groups of mixed religion. You'll probably notice a similar situation in real world societies of mixed religion.|`|BZBluhXqaa	Because us mulsims have the most peaceful and respected religion|`|0yTM98Odaa	Tbh I don't think one group of people on YA is nicer than another because all the groups have their nasty people and nice people.  Yeah a lot of them are nice but then a few really aren't, you can't ask a question in ramadan without at least a few insulting you.  I have also like some other people have mentioned heard some saying bad things about Jews and western people on here.  Maybe you have only come across the nice ones.

However, some Muslims are unkind to others, but what i want to say is that their behaviour is not Islamic and is not of Our Islamic principals. Islam has taught us to reason with others, cursing and downing other people's beliefs and concepts is not the way to a civilized conversation. Respect must be mutual. However, some Muslims choose to ignore this Islamic principal, and unfortuantely reflecting a bad image of Islam; a false image...    "Say : O ye that reject Faith! I worship not that which ye worship, Nor will ye worship that which I worship. And I will not worship that which ye have been wont to worship, Nor will ye worship that which I worship. To you be your Way, and to me mine. "  (Surah 109)    God Bless You...  :)
WjRqYf6naa	Actually, I think that is one of the few wholesome messages to be found in Madonna's repertoire. I strongly support any woman's decision to keep and raise her child. I also think that the father should be involved, as it takes two to tango, as the saying goes. Being a single mother is not an easy thing, especially for a young person.    I think that the pro-life movement in general needs to concentrate more on counseling, support, prayer and adoption, and less on picketing and lobbying. i don't like Roe v. Wade very much at all, but I'm not under any illusion that it will be overturned any time soon.    I would also like for many advocates for life to come off of their high horse inregard to birth control. If a pregnancy never happens, a young woman will not have to make this agonizing choice.    God bless.|`|gBoUrlrKaa	I think any time someone chooses to keep a baby, it's good. Unless of course it's Madonna.|`|bK5MJCxhaa	Teenagers get pregnant. It shouldn't be encouraged, but it happens.

I am prochoice, but I think a song encouraging people to keep their babies is better than a song saying she is goin down to the clinic to take care of it.

Everything is the moment, so why would a loving Creator expect his creation to worry about the future? My dad doesn't do that. ...Hell? Does a wise and loving Creator sound like the type to use fear in order to gain trust and respect? My dad doesn't do that. BUT, this is something us humans often do, and that is distraction, most of the time unintentionally. If there's a Creator- all-encompassing, powerful, all-knowing- why would he want to remind us constantly about himself? The truth, as I know it to be, is that we all have a little piece to ourselves, a spark of Light, a gift that allows us to exhibit qualities such as wisdom, knowledge, compassion, creativity, and everything else that separates us from the animals. But wait, creativity? Are we creators? Do we not constantly create our own realities by first having a thought, then sending it to our brain, which sends the appropriate action, and we then experience the initial reaction? With knowledge we can realize any mistakes we've made, with compassion we can be considerate of others, with wisdom we can know where to move next, and every other "tool" we have can be used in this process. Some people say we're here to learn lessons. Some say we're just remembering.   I like to say, "It doesn't matter what you do, as long as your intention is true."

One room, everyone has long spoons, so long that the bowl of the spoon cannot reach their mouth.  There is food galore, but they are tied to their chair so that they can only use the spoons, and of course that is no good.  He is told this was hell.  Everyone looks starved, and he can understand how that is hell.    Then the man is taken into the next room, the conditions are the same.  He is told this is heaven.  "How can that be?  It's the same?"  The angel says "No, there's one big difference... watch."  As he watches, he notices that the reason the people are well-fed are that they are feeding one another with the long spoons.  The attitude of the people made it heaven.|`|d529cebfe13576f3ddee3e55b4cd08ffaa	Heaven/Hell: Some way too sickeningly sweet cutesy cartoon with bunnies, flowers, the works...

G-d led the holy man to two doors. He opened one of the doors and the holy man looked in. In the middle of the room was a large round table. In the middle of the table was a large pot of stew which smelled delicious and made the holy man's mouth water. The people sitting around the table were thin and sickly. They appeared to be famished. They were holding spoons with very long handles and each found it possible to reach into the pot of stew and take a spoonful, but because the handle was longer than their arms, they could not get the spoons back into their mouths.        The holy man shuddered at the sight of their misery and suffering. G-d said, You have seen Hell.        They went to the next room and opened the door. It was exactly the same as the first one. There was the large round table with the large pot of stew which made the holy man's mouth water. The people were equipped with the same long-handled spoons, but here the people were well-nourished and plump, laughing and talking.        The holy man said, I don't understand.        "It is simple," said G-d, it requires but one skill. You see, they have learned to feed each other, while the greedy think only of themselves.|`|wAKZxpBxaa	Could possibloy be.

Heaven is the 'abode' of ALMIGHTY GOD.  It is where he was approached by Satan.  (Job 1:6) Now it came to be the day when the sons of the [true] God entered to take their station before Jehovah, and even Satan proceeded to enter right among them.    Heaven is constant and will always remain.    On the other hand,."Hell" also known by its Greek name " Hades" is NOT constant, and will cease to be along with death. which of course is a condition, not a place.    (Revelation 20:14) And death and Hades were hurled into the lake of fire. This means the second death, the lake of fire.    So heaven and hell cannot be the same...

uFAoq4idaa	Jesus will come when Israel will be restored again after the sixth trumpet judgment of God. Revelation 9:13-21. After the cleansing God will restore Israel. He will gather all the children of Abraham with them. Isaiah 60:5-7 Then thou shalt see, and flow together and your heart shall fear and be enlarged: because the abundance of the sea shall be converted to you the forces of the Gentiles shall come to you. The multitudes of camels shall cover you, the dromedaries of Midian ans Ephah; all they from Sheba shall come: they shall bring gold and incense; and they shall show forth the praises of the Lord. All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered together to you, the rams of Nebaioth shall minister to you; they shall come up with acceptance on my altar; and I will glorify the house of y glory. Aside from the Gentiles who will be gathered to Israel as children of Abraham and children of God the children of Abraham with Keturah shall also be gathered with them. God will be the King of the whole earth. Zechariah 14:9 And the Lord shall be king over all the earth: in that day shall be there be one Lord and His name is one. Then Jesus will come to take His followers, His bride the church and they will reign with Him for a thousand years in heaven. After one thousand years God will bring them down to earth.

There are no signs for the rapture, He could come at any moment. In other words nothing has to happen (including the NWO coming into effect) before the rapture takes place. But there are signs for the second coming which will take place about 7yrs after the rapture when antichrist and the whole world is against Israel.|`|Hsz0Qn6Eaa	umm no I think we will have to endure the NWO or reign of the anti christ as described in the bible until the end.. I find it in the bible Mat. 24:3-28.

To me that says that the church will be there during this time of course many disagree with this view saying the rapture will be before this time. The bible doesn't say anythin gabout a new world order it just speaks about a group of kingdoms under the rule of one . This is said during the prophecies about the beast with I think it's 7 heads ten horns and on those horns ten crowns. ( rev 13:1 )KJV www.endtime.com or just read revelation. The symbolic language is decoded in daniel 7and rev 17:7-15.  it says that  the heads are 7  mountains on which the beast sits. horns are the kings or leaders that will recieve power with the beast The beast represents a kingdom ( daniel 7) . But please read the verses because there is more info that I can't write everything here.  this is all KJV|`|BEafTcLwaa	Jesus said time and time again, that He would return to that generation - His own contemporaries.  2000 years and counting is simply illogical, if you believe the Bible.  God knows how to communicate time.  He told Daniel to shut up the words of his prophesy because the time of its fulfillment was a long way off (took 600 years.)  So how can we possibly believe that John, writing under divine inspiration, was wrong when he wrote that the angel told him NOT to seal up the words of that prophesy, because the time was 'soon' and 'at hand?'  It's absolutely illogical.  If 600 years is a long way off to God, then 2000 years cannot possibly be 'soon.'  We must learn how to use 'audience relevance,' study history and culture of that time, interpret figurative and apocalyptic language correctly, using the Bible as our guide.    There is much misunderstanding about the nature and purpose of His return.  It was simply to destroy the old covenant system w/ its Temple and rituals, and usher in the new covenant, which has no end.

fcb47ba6b3d558e424fe13d64318ea8caa	This is where I will tell you that you should sincerely pray and ask God for guidance. The bible is only filled with contradictions because people interpret them that way. God's word is infallible. It is all how a person reads the bible. One person can read the bible one way and someone else the other. But this is the thing, God gives us each knowledge and when He wants to reveal the spiritual meaning behind a certain scripture, He will.   I also say this, when choosing a "religion" I suggest that whomever you choose to be your god, that you put them to a "test". Jesus Christ will allow you to not test Him but He will allow you to know that He is real. I can't quit find the word I was looking for (late and half asleep). Jesus Christ is the only One True Living God. If you give Him a chance He will show you.

The more research the better.     Many of the apparent contradictions are more due to hermeneutical misunderstandings, or contextual ignorance.  The farther away we get from the mindset of the original writers the harder understanding what they meant will be.      That said, there are a couple things in the Bible that, given all our context and hermeneutical knowledge (which isn't actually that much) that still confuse many people.  However, given the range of time, people, and geographical locations that the Bible was written in, the number of even those kind of incoherencies is strikingly low.      Regarding how much it has changed, the discovery of the dead sea scrolls in the 70's (I think) verified the validity of the current state of the Bible.  To get the purest understanding, of course, learn Greek and Hebrew and do your own exegesis...but until then, choose a good english interpretation.      Any more questions, please feel free to email me.|`|4bb8aefb2a2ea8d99c78d3fbc5220586aa	Honey, i think its well known. the Bible has constantly been "revised" by christians. it has been changed from time immemorial. i'm muslim and the Quran says that God gave Jesus the Bible or "Injeel" in Arabic. He gave Moses the Torah and David the Psalms or "Zabur". but all books were changed by those who wanted their own wills that did not agree with God's word. Hence God gave the Quran to the Last Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) and God Himself declared in it that the Quran is His final word and has made such that no change can be brought in it. It has been created in such a way that even if all humanity got together, they would not be able to produce a single verse like it. though many claim to have done this, any arabic knowing non-muslim who has read the Quran can claim that whatever they have created is not at all like the Quran. by the way, i've heard that the Gospel of Barnabas retains some purity and confirms a lot about the Quran and the Prophet (PBUH). however it is not accepted by the catholics and others. i'm not sure of the name but that's it i guess.|`|EzqX9ojdaa	Just so no one says he doesn't name any contradictions, here are a very select few:    GE 1:3-5 On the first day, God created light, then separated light and darkness.

In fact that is easy to do - make passages appear to contradict. But here is one simple fact about it - nothing it says is incorrect. There are a FEW MINOR gramatical errors but we know what they are and where they are because we compare newly discovered manuscripts to those that were available in the past. We westerners do not destroy our manuscripts, but in the case of the quran, it is admitted historically that there originally were several very unmatching manuscripts that were condensed into one and those original, conflicting manuscripts were burned. But the Bible translations we have today are as old and accurate as they could possibly be, and so many copies were made in the early years and compared for accuracy that the Bible is (I'd say) 99.9% accurate and 100% reliable in what it says. This IS a subject worthy of deep study, but the misunderstanding about 'contradictions' and 'alterations' need to be revealed for the lies they are. Email me with what you have. But you can rely on the Bible, even though it is not technically 'perfect'. Nothing is. This, I believe sincerely, is a part of God's will. The same reason he doesn't make appearances to us all individually, doesn't heal all our sicknesses, and so many other things, even though he could - he requires we come to him in faith, not because we are impressed by his miracles and what he can do for us. May God bless you in your searching, if it's sincere and open-minded.

VSzF36Ywaa	No. Write it all in 12 point black.  You'd look cheap and nasty with large and coloured font.|`|yegDdZfRaa	If it's work-related, I'd forego the email & talk to them in person. That's ridiculous that they can't/won't do their job. I'd complain to their superior as well, especially if they don't reply to urgent correspondence.    I had a boss like that once...all she did was walk around and gossip with other people in the office - took her hours and sometimes days to get a reply from her.|`|C4BJ3yLWaa	If they don't respond they are the ones holding up work.

To show how important the letter is, there is a button that looks like a red exclimation mark, click it and it will change the status of the email to "high importance" and a flag button means that you need a follow up or feedback.   once sent, allow a day or two before the deadline (when you need the reply) and send another email, a forward of the first on
NfSLXHU3aa	I think it's cool and funny when listening to people that have plural accents.     One of the doctors I work with was born and raised in American and has an American accent.  But when he talks with his dad, he most definitely has a Vietnamese accent.    This is very common in Southern California.  The parents have English as a second language, but the kids learn the American accent from school and TV.    All people have strange little quirks, they don't always share them.

Your opinion is correct.    Edit:  I just had to come back to this question.  Firstly, I live in Canada.  I am mixed Chinese/Lao/French descent.  I am very much in love with this Indian lady.  We're both in our mid 20s, yet everytime I see her, she has to sneak around.  Her parents, especially her dad does not like her seeing me, even as a friend.  And I am not a bad influence on her...I am a very decent guy, great job, I sponsor a child, donate to charities, I am a regular volunteer at many organizations...yet because I am not Indian, it most likely won't work out...I will always be viewed by her family as a "poison" to her life.

hJAtgbb8aa	To me it sounds like he's the kind of person who only gets along with the person he seems to be having something in common, or perhaps they share something different...or perhaps, nothing, except the sexual+emotional attraction.  He may not be a bisexual if he is into girls 100%, but again he admits that he's into guys.  I think it's more likely that he's what people call a "Polysexual", lol trust me, there are way too many labels.    I say that only he'll be able to tell what he is, not you, not me, but him. He knows himself better than us and so he can identify himself the way he is comfortable.    I am a pansexual, but most people say I should be a bisexual....in certain extent, they are right, but I'm not comfortable with it, because I know I'm not bisexual.    So you see, it depends entirely upon the person themselves.    I think you should ask him clearly about this, or he may not know about polysexuality/pansexuality or even bisexuality. (I said probably), so talk to him about it.    As a Pansexual, I can say that I am attracted to people who catch my eyes somehow...not based on their looks, but the thing in them....probably the way they carry themselves or the way they talk....it could be anyone.    But for polysexuals, they are attracted to a wide range of personalities, or even to male and female, but not necessarily all sorts of genders.  Here's an extract from Wikipedia:    Polysexuality refers to people who are attracted to more than one gender or sex but do not wish to identify as bisexual because it implies that there are only two binary genders or sexes. Polysexuals are those people sexually attracted to many different sorts of ideas and characteristics. Polysexuality should not be confused with pansexuality; pan meaning all, and poly meaning many, though not necessarily all.    The term is also used as an appellation for relationships that are non-monogamous, but not necessarily intimate, polysexuals being those who engage in such relationships.    Polysexuality is a self-identifying term that is somewhat amorphous, as there is a wide variety of different people who use the term to describe themselves.    Hope this helps.

I used to say all the same things as your friend and felt the exact same way - lonely, couldn't find some one, wasn't fair...  In fact it lasted all the way to my 30's.  Then I admitted I was gay (including to myself).  I am grateful now that I didn't go down the road that many gay guys do - that of marrying a girl and ruining someone else's life (along with their own).  Your friend might be gay;  or he might be bi (he's clearly not straight).  Be a friend to him, no matter what.  Its a lot harder on him than you could ever know (one of the things guys in that situation fear the most is losing friends like you).

Sometimes it is the person someone is looking for, perhaps he just does not want a label or thinks that if he is labelled it means he has to fit in some kind of box.  (you have only angered a few people, I find the question quite interesting)  it also could be he just hates being on his own in that ind of way. He does sound kind of lonely.

If he says hes straight then leave it alone... and if he's gay what is the big deal?    Maybe he is bi... maybe he is confused right now. The best thing to do is STOP talking about him and just be a friend to him.|`|faZuAHkbaa	Unless you're talking about yourself here (I think so), or have a stake in this guy's sexual life (you're romantically or sexually interested in him), it's really none of your business unless he seeks advice from you.|`|f48gha45aa	He's your friend. That's the important thing. His sexuality shouldn't matter.  If he wants to classify himself as straight, that's his right, and you, as a friend, should accept that he wishes to be identified as a straight male.    People are defensive here, because a lot of people can probably relate to your friend. I know I can.  I've had, and still have some, friends that insist on questioning my sexuality, trying to tell me what I am and am not. It's not a nice feeling.    I do hope you don't just think your friend likes talking about the subject, he may just be going along because you seem to have such an interest in the topic.    My personal advice is to just let it go. His sexuality impacts your friendship in no way. If he wants to label himself as something other than straight, I'm sure he will let you know.
YA2TzdRxaa	Yes, it does.It may be illogical and seem anachronistic in the modern World but it reminds me of over 1000 years of history and tradition.    I was born in the city of Winchester which was the ancient capital of England, where the old kings were crowned.    I live on the south coast of England and near to us is a National Heritage site called The New Forest.Not 'new' at all but planted by King William the Conqueror in 1066 as his personal hunting forest. It is wild and beautiful with deer and New Forest ponies roaming free.        We have so many beautiful castles and stately homes that were built for Kings and Queens, such as The Tower of London, Buckingham Palace, Holyrood House etc., where we can visit and see the greatest Art, Sculpture, Architecture and gardens of their period.         I went to see the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, as a schoolgirl and I will never forget the sheer scale and pageantry of the event as troops from all over the World marched proudly by and the beautiful young Queen passed by in her fabulous golden coach.|`|Ku3A8kkzaa	Yes, whether that is good or not is another thing ...|`|AA12324252	It's like dragging a 2 ton load of manure behind my car.

If it's pure friendship then he knows his boundaries and limitations without telling him, if he wants more than that then he has to court you and wait for you to be ready.

WAoNhHB1aa	The grass is always greener.  Those who are skinny wish to be curvy, and those who are curvy wish to be skinny.  Those with freckles hate them, and people like me who don't have freckles want them.  Those with curly hair want straight hair, and those with straight hair want curly hair.  Flat chested girls want to be bustier, and girls with big strawberry creams want them to be smaller.    I don't want to be supermodel skinny, but I could stand to lose a few pounds.  I want my butt to be smaller, but I don't want it to be flat.  I kind of want it to be in the middle.  Maybe kinda big but smaller than it is now.  My hips are big, and no amount of weight loss will change that.  I used to hate them, but I saw a pic of Christina Aguilera where her hips looked big but it looked cool and now I want to look like that.  I want my thunder thighs and waist to be smaller, and my stomach to be a little flatter.  But I don't want to be super bony skinny because that's just wrong, and also my hips would look bad, and because I like to eat too much.  My strawberry creams are B's, but for some reason part of me wants them to be smaller.  Maybe if I lose weight, the girls will shrink!    What's ironic is, I have big hips and a fear of childbirth, and bigger hips are supposed to make birthing easier, but of course I have no plans to give birth.|`|xpiGWrdMaa	i love my curves. no way in hell i'd want a big butt though. and my hips are too big for my taste. yeah, maybe i dont like them so much. but i love my boobs!|`|EXurNsB4aa	I think everyone has the right to gripe about their body.  And I know a ton of girls who complain about their breasts being too big (it can hurt your back a lot).|`|fJMDTjPXaa	Well, I hate my boobs.  I wish they were smaller and a little more normal-looking (I find them strange).  I've always thought women with small breasts fit nicer in clothes.    I feel you about women having no reason to hate their curves.  I have a bit of weight on me (I'm b/t size 2 and 4, and I'm only 5' tall), but besides my butt and boobs, I have the most unfeminine body ever.  I would do anything for shapely legs and wide hips.  I think it's so sexy and enviable when a woman has an hourglass figure... like Monica Bellucci or Aishwarya Rai or Kate Winslet.|`|emvIYyufaa	There is a lot of pressure to be thin and especially when most clothes where I live seem to be made for someone who is 5'7" and up with small hips and a C-cup max, the clothes make me look fat and feel fatter than I am. A lot of clothes make me look pregnant, especially since right now, I notice almost everything is empire waisted so if I were to wear the size to fit me, the seam cuts my breasts in two and puffs out, making me look fat. I also have to go a couple of sizes up to fit my bust comfortably but that usually makes my waist look large so I squeeze into a smaller size. Jeans also don't fit. I have to go a size up to fit my hips and thus, my pants would slide down until it fits comfortably, making me look like a dumpy, short legged person. Even apple bottoms are not a perfect fit for me. On delias when I was trying to find my size, they indicated that I should wear an 13/14 because of my hips and bust but if I were to only go by waist, I'd wear a 5/6. Most of the time Skinny, tall (but not too tall) people can hop into a store, find something almost instantly and look great in it. It's really disheartening. Not to mention that most clothes that can fit me are usually way to expensive. One of my bras costs upwards of $70-80 at full price and that's just the basic ones, and that's not including shipping since they do not carry my bra size anywhere in America, only in UK.    I didn't start loving my body until I learned to make clothes for myself and found clothes that fit wonderfully from vintage stores. I wear a size 4 from the 80s but have to get at least a 6 to fit my hips (Which is like two sizes, considering the sizing differences from then until now) I don't think I want to be that thin but I'd like to either see more clothes for women like me or be a little more balanced.|`|Sicr0Mdoaa	I love my curves|`|5vcd7GHNaa	Lol, I remember I had bigger than average breasts in Grade 7, and three guys picked on me, saying I had big breasts. D:     Ahh, those times. I remember beginning to wear minimizers, and such.      In other words, peer pressure, and being unable to fit into clothes.|`|wF2G3Krcaa	They do that to fish for compliments. And to be honest, some men like women who look like you. I have a friend who likes only size 2 and smaller. I think it's weird, but he won't date anyone bigger than that. I LOVE my curves and am very proud of them. You know what they say, the grass is greener on the other side.|`|CuHfhI1qaa	I think since a lot of gay men are fashion designers and determining who is the model for their shows they go by what they find sexy which is a shape as close to a boy as they can get. Yes, gay fashion designers  would like all women to aspire to having boys figures with maybe some silicon boobs stuck on.

Some people believe there is something wrong with them so they start acting differently because, deep down, they probably think it's cool or something. But not all are what they are or see what they see because they believe in it. Do you really think I wanted to be what I am? I've noticed strange things about me long before I knew what I was or even that such a being existed. So, obviously it had nothing to do with believing...I didn't even know what it was. But I've accepted what I am and I'm happy with it to an extent. I just wish humans could be as understanding (like that will ever happen).
N5yp2TiRaa	99.99%...are you crazy???  Did you see the Top Gear article when they put up a wannabe fast car (Escort Cosworth) against a Lotus Esprit? The Lotus left the Cossie standing. The Lotus then went on to lose a race against a Porsche 996 turbo and a TVR Cerbera.  There are many cars which would keep up with the Cosworth...VW Corrado VR6,  Honda Civic Type R, Fiat Coup Turbo...and those aren't considered all that fast today.|`|I8ZpZSCGaa	I take it you've never worked on a mark 2 escort ghia?, they were class.

uNu7b21baa	Well my father died when I was young  I've faced social and personal persecution  My mother struggled greatly and worked 3 jobs    No; I don't wish I was aborted.|`|8yE2sYGeaa	This is what I would say:    "The choice is yours. I want to give you a full range of options with no limitations, but i cannot make that final decision for you. Only you can make that decision, but I want your decision to be an informed decision."    I ahve also seen this test does as a two parter.    The first part, you would ahve killed beethoven.    when you spare the second child, you allow david Berkowitz (Son of Sam) to live    it's all an unfair test.    Now, here's a good one for you.    Pro-life convince a mother to keep her child and that child grows up to be an abortion doctor. Will now the pro-life movement feel it is OK to kill this person?|`|NaM4ZT64aa	That was nothing even remotely like Obama's situation.  Barack Obama Sr. did not leave until his son was two years old, and his mother had no idea that such a thing would have happened.  Besides, this is the same as arguing about aborting Beethoven.  Absolutely irrelevant.      You can always do the flip side and ask, what if somebody aborted Hitler?  Or Stalin?  Or Pol Pot?  Or Saddam Hussein?  The argument is a logical fallacy.|`|3nw2Pwu8aa	Abortion is legalised murder, pure and simple. What a load of crap about "it's the womans body, it's her choice".......what an easy way of taking the focus off the HUMAN BABY. The only choice the mother should make is to either raise the child or give for adoption, how many people go through IVF to have kids but still don't? how many can't have kids but would love them?? Aborting babies is wrong, it's disgusting and shouldn't happen. What a great society we live in, we call for human rights for everyone, equality for minorities, some fight tooth and nail for gay marriage, more money for the arts, all these superficial things that don't really matter when compared to a life. and that's what we're talking about, a little, tiny life. the most innocent of us, and what happens?? we have people celebrating in the streets because now we can legally kill them.

The pro-lifers usually adhere to patriarchal, sexist religions, which explains their brainless pro-life stance.    It's interesting to note that in the Old Testament, God didn't consider anyone to be fully human until he/she was at least ONE MONTH OLD. The pro-life position, therefore, does NOT have Biblical support, and if the pro-lifers are persuaded by their religion, then they should admit that their "morals" regarding this issue are completely MANUFACTURED.|`|tPoZasqOaa	I am for life, but I'm also for freedom of choice.

I am also a Christian. Although my choice for being pro-life is party because of my faith, it is also just how I feel morrally when it comes down to the topic of abortion and the death penalty. No man has the right to end another humans life. When it is your time to leave this Earth, God will take you.  But, Very interesting! Glad I came across this question because I was unaware of that!   To answer your question, in my personal opinion that situation does not justify abortion. There should be no situations were abortion should take place. No matter how tough life may be, choosing to end your child's life should not ever cross a mothers mind.   Just goes to show basically, "don't judge a book by its cover" and don't let stereotypes fool you. Just because a situation can look bad on the outside to others even yourself, it doesn't mean things will not change or get better. Having faith and trusting in God will only make you stronger as a person, he is able to guide us through difficult times.    Check this out, if you already havn't!           Question 1:    Ifyou knew a woman who was pregnant, who had 8 kids already, three whowere deaf, two who were blind, one mentally retarded, and she hadsyphilis, would you recommend that she have an abortion?      Read the next question before looking at the answer for this one.        Question 2:    It is time to elect a new world leader, and only your vote counts. Here are the facts about the three leading candidates.      Candidate A -    Associates with crooked politicians, and consults with astrologists.  He's had two Mistresses. He also chain smokes and drinks 8 to 10 martinis a day.      Candidate B -    He was kicked ou t of office twice, sleeps until noon, used opium in college and drinks a quart of whiskey every evening.      Candidate C -    He is a decorated war hero. He's a vegetarian, doesn't smoke, drinks an occasional beer and never cheated on his wife.        Which of these candidates would be your Choice?    Decide first, no peeking, then scroll down for the answer.      --------------------------------------...        Candidate A: is Franklin D. Roosevelt.  Candidate B: is Winston Churchill.  Candidate C: is Adolph Hitler.      And, by the way, the answer to the abortion question: If you said yes, you just killed Beethoven.    Pretty interesting isn't it? Makes a person think before judging someone.      and in case you never saw this one..! ....    Can you imagine working for a company that has a little more than 500 employees and has the following statistics:    * 29 have been accused of spousal abuse  * 7 have been arrested for fraud  * 19 have been accused of writing bad checks  * 117 have directly or indirectly bankrupted at least 2 businesses  * 3 have done time for assault  * 71 cannot get a credit card due to bad credit  * 14 have been arrested on drug-related charges  * 8 have been arrested for shoplifting  * 21 are currently defendants in lawsuits  * 84 have been arrested for drunk driving in the last year    Can you guess which organization this is?

She know that if she will become pregnant now, the following will happen:    Father would abandon him  He will face social and personal persecution  His mother will struggle greatly, and die relatively early in life    Will you recommend that she get pregnant, or advise her to abstain for now?    My point is that your argument is hypocritical, because the result of abortion would be the same as the result of not conceiving in the first place.|`|mXajRsLsaa	What are you talking about?|`|AoACu48daa	I don't think the reasons need to be justified.

Prayer is always good, too.|`|s8P8C92zaa	Is he new to the faith? It may be an attack from the enemy...even if he's been saved a while, the enemy knows what your weaknesses are, if he's always had low self esteem,this would be a likely target! I believe prayer is key to this kind of problem. He needs to pray for himself, you should pray for him too. That God would make him confident of the way he was created, he may naturally be shy, which is fine, the way God made him, but having low self esteem is not of God and is entirely different from humility!

On educational shows or the news for example the host is sometimes a lady.. and she not covered up so will men be sinning by watching these shows??? even though the subject they are talking about is NOT HARUM .         Praise be to Allaah.     Firstly:     The Muslim woman has to cover her entire body in front of non-mahram men, and it is especially not permissible for her to show her adornment such as her hair, chest and forearms.     In the answer to question no. 11774 you will find the ruling on women covering their faces, with detailed evidence.     At the end of that question we mentioned the evil effects that result from showing the face to non-mahrams, which include: self admiration because of her own beauty, loss of modesty and men being tempted by her.     If this is the ruling with regard to showing the face, and these are some of the effects of her showing it before non-mahram men, then what would the ruling on showing the chest and hair as well be? What would be the effects that result from that?     We are saddened by the fact that women accept to become a cheap product that is traded by sick and evil people. Can a woman be chosen to work as a broadcaster on a satellite channel if she is not beautiful? This is the first quality that is sought, so that viewers may enjoy looking at her and thinking of her. How can a woman agree to be the focus of millions who are staring at her and thinking of her? Would she be a noble woman who guards her chastity and modesty in their view, when they see her adorning herself for her viewers in a way that she does not adorn herself for her husband?     Secondly:     With regard to a man looking at the face, chest and hair of a non-mahram woman, it is not permissible to doubt that this is haraam.     Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:     It is haraam for an adult man to look at the awrah of a free adult non-mahram woman, and her face and hands, if there is the fear of fitnah, and even if there is no such fear, according to the correct view. End quote.     Ibn Shihaab al-Deen al-Ramli (may Allaah have mercy on him) said, commenting on the words of al-Nawawi:      The consensus of the ummah is that it is forbidden for women to go out with their faces uncovered, because looking is the cause of fitnah and provocation of desire.      Nihaayat al-Muhtaaj ila Sharh al-Minhaaj (6/187, 188)     Dr. Muhammad Ismaaeel al-Muqaddam said:     The scholars  including the imams of the four madhhabs  are all unanimously agreed that it is obligatory for a woman to cover her entire body before non-mahram men, whether they think that the face and hands are awrah or they do not. But it is obligatory to cover them in these times, because most people  are corrupt and weak in religious commitment, and they do not take care to avoid looking in a haraam way at the face of the woman which is the site of her charms, the standard of her beauty and the indicator of her physical well being.     Awdat al-Hijaab (p. 432)     In al-Mawsooah al-Fiqhiyyaah (26/269) it says:     If the woman is free and a non-mahram, it is not permissible to look at her with desire at all or when there is the fear of fitnah, and there is no difference of opinion among the fuqaha. End quote.     In (26/270) it says:     The fuqaha are unanimously agreed that looking at a woman with desire is haraam, whether she is a mahram or a non-mahram, except for his wife and the one who is permissible for him.     It is also forbidden for a non-mahram woman to look at a non-mahram man, if it is with desire. End quote.     The kind of looking at a non-mahram woman that is excused in shareeah is the unintentional glance. If that happens, then one is required to look away; it is not permissible to keep looking. The comments of the scholars on this matter refer to looking at the face; as for looking at her chest or hair  as in the case of these female TV presenters  no one would doubt that this is haraam, and there should be no difference of opinion concerning that.     Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):     Tell the believing men to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things), and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts). That is purer for them.

Mosesasked, and God did not give an answer.  All God said was "I am that which I am," so the hebrews called him "I AM" among many other names; depending on which attribute of God they were appealing to or addressing, such as El-Shadai, El-Elyon, Jehovah, Jehovah Jirah, Adonai, and so on.

If you think His name is Yahweh you couldn't be less wrong about that either.  If you are using Elohim or Eloi you  are closer, but again they used those for other gods too, If you are using Allah you would be really wrong.  So whats left? El Shaddai(more of a label than a name), I will quote Paul in saying if you believe and understand there can be only one God, all the rest are counterfeit, and not worth worshiping, this is why Christians don't overemphasize His name, they know there can be only one.  If you must have a correct version of His name try Luke Ch.1 Vs. 5 "Abijah" which a "J" in Hebrew is yod pronounced in   English as a "Y" which phonetically turns it into Abiyah let me break it down in Hebrew for you Abba is Papa in Hebrew or if you and Jah are more formal; then "Father" and Jah(Yah) is part of God's true name like HalleluJAH or CumbiJAH Which means Heavenly Papa, and also has the right vowels too unlike the tetragrammaton JHWH which phonetically in Hebrew is YHVH which makes Jehovah and Yahweh both only 1/2 right, and both are using bad vowels too.  I know the right vowels for both but that is another answer some other day, for right now be fed with Zachariah's priestly order of "Abijah" which was taught twice per year the 8th week and the 32nd week in the Hebrew calendar which puts John the Baptist's conception day at June 24th that year, but you did not ask when Yeshua(Jesus) was concieved or born did you?, maybe if you looked a little deeper you would realize it's all in the Bible, you just like an Archeologist must dig, and know where to dig for these pieces of information.|`|c2fc70c8196fb6665f4605b33bcc57a4aa	"god' is a title.

Still, the fact that you chose to put your question to gay people is a good sign.  I hope you now understand just how paranoid you are and how unfair your are being to your brother-in-law. Aren't you lucky that he takes an interest in his nephew? I live thousands of miles from my nephews and nieces and regret that they have all grown up without me being able to be a closer part of their lives while they were children unlike my lesbian sister who was always involved. Happily though, as teenagers they often turned to us when they had problems that they felt they couldn't ask their parents. They have known about my sexuality since their childhood and I was amazed at how supportive they are. Not one of them is gay.    Be thankful that you have somebody who takes an interest in your son. I am sure he loves him as much as I love my nephews and nieces. Try not to jump to conclusions when there is no reason for them. That is pure paranoia. Imagine how devastated your brother-in-law would feel if he knew what is going through your mind.    A couple of questions for you: have you told your in-laws your low opinion of their son despite having no grounds for it? Does your husband know what you think of his brother?

You can specify when sending your item(by waiving) that you don't require a signature, otherwise it DOES need to be signed for.

Seems a large manila envelope was about $10.00. As far as I know no one delivers on Sun..|`|Qz3sii2caa	Depends on a few factors such as when you sent it and how far away it's being sent. For best results, mail off first thing in the morning. You can discuss these details with the front desk clerk and in the early morning there is more time to get things done.     Nobody delivers on Sunday. Anything that doesn't make it to the station before your carrier leaves for their delivery route on Saturday will be delivered the following Monday. If the recipient is a business that is closed on Saturday, it will be held until Monday.    If a signature is required (it isn't always) and no one is there to sign for it, a note will be left letting the addressee know when and where they can pick up their package/envelope. There may be an option for re-delivery, but those are on a case to case basis. If a signature is required and you know the recipient will not be present to sign, you can pay a little extra to waive signature confirmation and the package will be delivered.    While I have never had a problem with FedEx, I recommend using USPS. Generally they are very reliable with things like Overnight or Express Mail (hey, if it's got a barcode it can be tracked, so they don't slack on those Special Deliveries because they're being watched). However, FedEx is SUPER expensive. If you're trying to save money, USPS all the way. Depending on what it is you're sending, they offer flat-rate packaging, so if you're sending something dense and heavy you can save a ton of money with that. "If it fits, it ships!"     Added bonus, if you do flat rate, you don't have to weight your item. If you don't need the scale, you can get everything set up and then arrange for your mail carrier to pick up the package from your house. Saves you a trip to the post office!|`|ozwLZwXeaa	We have sent overnight from Northern Michigan to my Grandson near Nashville TN.

3890f326e072192e79ea3f718551dfb8aa	Another question: what did all the herbivores eat after the waters receded. Sure, plants and grass grow relatively fast, but would it be fast enough to provide enough food for all the grazers?    And none of this speaks to the fact there isn't a single bit of evidence to support the idea of such a flood which would have had to happen within the past 5000-10,000 years. This is especially laughable when they claim the remnants of the Ark are embedded in a high mountain in Turkey. In geologic terms that is absolutely impossible.    Obviously I am a skeptic. In fact, I am an atheist and I think the story is pure bs. But I do think it's possible the story comes from some kind of local legend about a man who took his animals on a boat when flood waters rose. Going back several thousand years, the average person's world was within about a 50-100 square mile area. So something that encompassed everything the eye could see could certainly be taken as world wide.    EDIT  BrEnDen: Have you even stopped to think about how absurd that sounds. Sure it only takes faith to accept it, but at some point common sense has to step in and say " this just doesn't make sense".

HAHAHA!!!|`|gi65K6Bbaa	lol, yeah ive always had a problem with that part of the bible (raised christian orthodox) but what i find even more far fetched is Jesus pulling hundreds of fish and loafs of bread out of his ***. Seriously whats with that??|`|ou104VaHaa	1) if you read the bible more you would find that Jesus took up loves of bread and fish only a small amount and Jesus lifted it up to the sky and thanked God and when the basket came down it was full and every time someone took out of it it kept filling up until everyone had eaten so i think noah did the same.  2) No noah did not go round the world looking for animals God sent them all to him.|`|IBhisfm9aa	First you would have to assume that all the animals we have now they had then especially if we believe some animals now didn't exist then. Salmonella is a problem from all these genetically enhanced products used to feed our animals of today i highly doubt they would have that problem then. Our math is a product of cultural diffusion so our one plus one wouldn't be the same as theirs. So we wouldn't know how long it took to make the Arc. Another problem with the bible is it has been written so many times and lost in translation it bothers me that drowning the world would be put in it when you read it God has a problem with the people he was dealing with. You see he is mad at those who knows his laws and they are deliberately disobeying them. They all know about the animal sacrifice and all yet they did it in vain. The world did not know God that is why the children of israel is cursed because they were entrusted with his word. Remember Noah and his sons populate the earth after the flood. So who's to say he flooded the world and not the place where Noah and his family were. So no i do not take all things from the bible literally. But its not the bible that's wrong its the interpretations that are. So this will be an argument forever.|`|E5BJ7REzaa	Quite literally! I have been studying the Word of God since 1984 and haven't even started to scratch the surface of the mysteries, Wisdom, Understanding and Knowledge that can be found if one is lead to search and study. I often amazed at how ignorant people are when trying to debunk the Bible. A person devoid of the Spirit of God will use what little common sense they have in attacking something Holy not realizing their rational is little more than a gnat's in comparison to what Almighty God can do or accomplish whether in the feeding of animals or the 5000 at Bethsaida.

Final note: With the assumption that God created all things - just why is it that we are still finding hundreds of new species on this earth every year? Could God still be creating?   Macro evolution is bunk. Micro evolution (Natural selection) is the truth. We use it to our advantage all the time.

C1SOqQSkaa	Beautifully put. It truly is a remarkable thing that a human mind - so good at wresting truth from nature - can be so weirdly hypnotised.    They suspend all logical mechanisms - and they must know what they are!     There was a question here recently about whether Jesus's death was actually a terrible mistake by an overconfident cult leader. Many answered by quoting Scripture stating that it was all a cunning plan! The axiom seems to be that a bit of Bible trumps anything, however rational. How weird is that?    It seems to be a psychological mode, as profound as the state people get into when they're terribly afraid or desperate. Civilised and sensible behaviour or thinking becomes secondary.    It reminds me of the behaviour seen in addicts, where morality, hunger, self-preservation and every other impulse becomes secondary to achieving the next fix.|`|Gc49JgoQaa	Serial killers also make for an interesting psychological study.|`|UutLVO2Laa	I think it's mind boggling that with all the contradictory evidence, they still believe.|`|cNniG2L0aa	They can't help it.

Who says that animals and plants don't have the same energy and conciseness inside them, no ones ever asked, and there's no possible way to get answers, After all the bible was written by men, no where does it say the God was personally dictating the words.

Many of us  been taught something ignorantly by sincere preachers or Sunday School teachers that we found out later was not in the bible.     Maybe she just said what she thought God would say.

Pray about your conversation with this teacher.    You might want to  explain to her it would have been better to have told your child she didn't have all the answers. Children can accept that.    You wanted a scripture.... Pro 30:5  Every word of God is pure: he is a shield unto them that put their trust in him.   Pro 30:6  Add thou not unto his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar.     None of us want to be guilty and found a liar so as parents and teachers we must be careful and know what is truthful.    We don't have to have all the answers to be good parents and teachers.     Often times I have told others with hard questions that I would pray and ask God for the answer. Many, many times a day or two later I had the answer.

They do not possess a seperate soul that survives death.1 Corinthians 15:50 says "flesh and blood cannot inherent God's Kingdom" A change in organism is required to enter into heaven.

As far as the natural cycle of life on earth, animals in general have a wonderful future on a paradise earth according to Isaiah 65:25, where they will live in full peace with each other and humans. Individual animals however, are not purposed to live forever. It shows us as humans how precious life is and how we are a distinct and remarkable creation of Jehovah God, made "in his image", with the chance of living forever like God himself.|`|49c07573b2ef8b7f4c512a10de7d7febaa	I think maybe animals go to heaven (whatever heaven may be) by default.

Romans 8:21-22 says "Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.

Animals DO think, and do have personalities, and do have emotions. They are different from the kinds that you and I have, but they're there. A cat can display signs of depression, associated often with either loneliness or thyroid disorders (thyroid disorders also cause mood issues in humans).    Animals have certain individuals they are attached to. They can be content, afraid, upset, or depressed.    Elephants experience such profound emotional attachment that they have "funerals" for the dead, which include morning for days.    Many animals are definitely conscious to some degree. Most of them don't possess meta cognition, as we do, and their thought processes and emotional ranges are not as complex as ours. But animals definitely have "souls," however you care to define that.|`|O3WYA3WGaa	Ecc 3:18 I said in my heart with regard to the sons of men that God is testing them to show them that they are but beasts. 19 For the fate of the sons of men and the fate of beasts is the same; as one dies, so dies the other.

AoACu48daa	Night and day.    Catholics are much more similar to most other Christians than most other Christians would like to admit.     On the other hand, Mormons have a completely different holy book (The Book of Mormon) which was written by some crazy dude named Joseph Smith about 200 years ago. It tells all sorts of wacky tales about how Jesus visited here in America shortly after his resurrection, and there were tribes of Jews living here back then. Just totally nutty.|`|WyICbuPqaa	The Romans Catholics don't believe in modern revelation or living prophets.  The Mormons do.  Those are the main differences.    The Catholic church has lost the spirit of the Holy Ghost, which is the spirit of prophecy and revelation, and they have lost the gifts of the spirit.  They no longer give people the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands, or have the proper authority to do so.    Peter, James, and John appeared to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery along the banks of the Susquehanna river.  They laid their hands on the heads of Joseph and Oliver and ordained them to the Melchizedek priesthood, which is the priesthood that Christ himself had, and through which the early apostles governed the church.  Using this apostolic authority, Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery ordained twelve apostles to once again administer the affairs of the church.  With this apostolic authority came the authority to give the Gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands as described in Acts.  The Gifts of the Spirit were once again found on the Earth, and the kingdom of God was restored in its fulness.|`|ZtEVlc0yaa	Mormons believe that after the death of Christ and the apostles, the proper authority (The priesthood) to govern the church was lost. And that it remained lost until it was restored by the Lord Jesus Christ through the prophet Joseph Smith.     Catholics do not.     Something like that. :]|`|qVaaaT7Gaa	mormons are slightly more gullible than catholics....only slightly|`|Hwe4MA6Faa	No comparison can be made between the two.        http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zy0d1HbIt...

I'm sure others will cover that.|`|n1eXQr5oaa	book of mormons... pope... bishops... polygamy|`|tBwdVpG4aa	Roman Catholics now have holocaust-denying bishops again.|`|yuzKikSRaa	magic underpants and secret handshakes|`|qPzxKhrlaa	Mormons believe in three levels of heaven. Mormons believe that only a husband and wife sealed in the Mormon Temple will go to the highest heaven. Mormons believe in eternal families. They also believe that black people bear the mark of Cain, were less valiant in the pre-life and that you existed as a soul, spirit or something of the sort before you were born. They believe that God was once a man and that men can become Gods. They believe that God has wives who give "birth" to the souls to be people here on Earth. They believe men who become Gods will have multiple wives (up to 200 in one account I read of). Oh, and they used to believe that no man who didn't have at least 3 wives would get to the highest heaven. Catholics find most of those beliefs to be heretical.|`|FGcwxZz0aa	Catholics worship only God for eternity. Mormons believe they will be Gods for all eternity.

God the Father God the son and God the Holy Sprit. 3 Beings but ones same God equal and essence and cosubtantial  The Mormons believe a form of Apollism That while God the Fater is God Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit not  to be God. They even claim that 3 beings can come together to form one unity in Gohristanityd or rather   Gods  The other thing they deviate from Mainstream Christanity is that they(the Mormons) claim that Jesus Christ spoke to North Americans  when there is no account of that in the Bible. Should it be so. The 4 canocial synoptiv Gospels should have a mention but there is none and so effectively they are trying to say God is lying and his Roman Catholic Church is lying  The Third and last thing they deviate is that while the Roman CAtholic Church and Christaniy has proclaimed that the last public relevation  was in Saint John of Patmos, They claim that in the 19 century God spoke to Jospeh smith to find the so called hidden Ark of the covenant when it is in Ethopia god told him to form his own Church to replace the so called defective mainstream Christanity or the Roman CAtholic Church. The Church has  said public relevations after Saint John of Patmos do not concern or jepordise the Roman Catholic Church. Did Joseph smith ever tested if that was a evil spirit  Polygamy-The Mormons claimed that you ca have more thena one wifes when God said thy shally not comitt adultery.Joseph smith and his gang decided to have more then one wifes  The Roman Catholic Church is the union of man an woman where their love for each other becomes one. As Jesus said in the Gospel when a man and a woman comes togetther the two become one  Oh Yes the Mormons have these things called Celestial marriage  what celestial marriage, Jesus our God abd saviour said in Heaven there is no marriage no man or woman but angelic like beings  God Bless|`|BMQlzUkfaa	1.  Both believe in Christ that he is the son of God and the Redeemer of the World    Difference:  We as Mormon's believe that Jesus has a resurrected imortal body.  That he is a separate being from God and the Holy Ghost.  Catholics believe that they are three beings rolled up into one and that Jesus was praying to himself.  That when Jesus took up his body in the resurrection that he only did it for a brief period of time and then he laid it down again.    2.  Both believe in baptism    Difference:  Mormon's are baptised as Jesus was, by immersion and by one holding the authority or priesthood of God.  This was restored to the earth again through the power of God and given to Joseph Smith.  We believe that one should be baptized into the fellowship of Jesus Christ in the same way that he was baptized.    Catholics are sprikled.  They believe that even young children who die are consigned to an eternity of hell if they weren't sprinkled or baptized before.  The practice of sprinkling to baptize was started when someone who was important wanted to be baptized and was too sick to get down into the water so, the Catholic leader changed the ordinance and sprinkled him instead.      3.  Revelation:  Mormon's believe that God is the same today as he was yesterday and that he will be the same forever.  That he spoke to mankind through prophets in ancient times and that he does so today.  We believe that when we pray we can receive answers to those prayers, and that this is a form of revelation too.  Personal revelation.  We also believe that when you serve in a position or calling in the church that you have the right to revelation and inspiration over the things that are under your responsibilities.  We believe that God loves all mankind and that he did not only speak to the Jews in the old world, but to others in the new world.  That the Book of Mormon is a record of the prophets and people who lived here in the American Continent, and that God prepared for it to come forth in the Last Days in which we now live.        Catholics:  Don't believe in prophets, nor revelation of any kind.  They think that God had written what he wanted written in the Bible and that is good enough.  Funny thing though is they were the ones who decided what books or writings were put in the Bible, in what order, and translated it many times too.      4.  With Mormon's our religion is much more involved in our lives. It is a way of life.  When you are a Mormon, you are part of a family.  You can go anywhere in the world that their is a Mormon chapel, walk in to services and feel at home.  People welcome you and when you are in need of help.  They help.  If you are sick they bring you meals. If you need company, they come and visit.  If you need help in fixing a roof, laying sod, tending children, etc.  they are there to help.  Everyone serves and they do it for no money.  Not one person in a ward or what you might term a congregation is paid.  Not even the Bishop or his councilors who are in charge of the ward and the meetings. Most people dedicate many, many hours each week to serving others.  For example, a Sunday School teacher will be called to serve for about two years.  The teacher will prepare lessons to give each week for no pay for two years until they are released from that calling and are asked to do another one.  The whole process works very well, and everyone gives, as it should be in Christ's church.        We attend meetings on Sunday which include Sacrament meeting, Sunday School, and a final meeting where we split into age groups and gender groups.  Women, men, children, teens.  We have activities for our youth on one night of the week.  We have functions for women, men, and children on a regular basis.  The teens have seminary which they attend every week day and where they study the scriptures.    Every member of our ward is visited by home teachers once a month, and the women have visiting teachers come also once a month to share a message, be a friend, and help you if you need it.    Catholics:  I am not sure exactly what they offer but I do know that the Catholics that I know only attend Mass once in a while, and don't have as much of an involvement with their church as Mormon's do. I am sure that they have programs too that involve others, but I don't think that their is any church that has as much involvement with their members as the Mormon church has.    These are a few of the things that I have noticed that are different about our two religions.  Hope this at least gives you a Mormon perspective though.|`|c25b976df76790483eae7d219034707caa	(((((lightgive)))))    Concentrating on the likenesses rather than the differences.

If the government didn't reward people for having children they can't afford to support and forced them to care for them out of their own pocket, like they do to people like me who work for a god damn living, teenage pregnancy rates would hit the floor.    What teenager would want to get pregnant when, instead of getting a free house and free money, their parents had to support them and they had to live at home because they couldn't afford to move out ? No help from the government means no incentive to lay on your back and think of the freebies.    Fair enough not everyone who gets pregnant does it so they can sit on their backside all day and live off state handouts but if you don't like the idea of looking after your children without depending on the state to pay for everything then keep your god damn legs shut.    Problem solved...

That's the ONLY thing that offers protection from STD's and pregnancy. At school they should be taught about all the diseases in great detail, and shown medical photographs - because if that doesn't work then there is no hope for them. Abstinence should also be taught as an option, but it's pretty obvious that most teenagers don't listen to logic in the heat of the moment. Condoms should be cheap and be easily available from many different locations.  :-)|`|Hae8acnpaa	Simply stop making sex such an issue so early in life.    Bring back shame. A long lost and sadly missed emotion which is the brake on many unwanted behaviours.    Stop paying benefits to the young 'career' mothers. If children are not adults until they are 18 then they are their parent's repsonsibility and that includes any 'scrapes' they get into. Their babies are then an added weight on the parents budget not the countires. I bet they'd soon stop popping babies if Mum and and had to finance the whole kaboodle.    Bring back unmarried mother hostels where they do nothing but scrub floors and knit until the baby is born, then care for the baby for a few weeks under supervision, then go home to Mum and Dad and let them take over the expense.

What better way to know than to hear it from the people themselves.    I mean after all, christianity is not the only religion or spiritual belief in the world now is it.    Now granted when I answer questions, it's normally from christians/theists/believers to atheists or about atheists, and I can answer in kind because I am an atheist living amongst christians, and thankfully, I am also living amongst Muslims, Pagans, Wiccans, etc.    I see you saying "it is often hard to take a religious discourse when questions specifically pertaining to religion are bombarded by atheist silliness".  To a point I would agree with you, but you do make the choice to read those responses you could always thumb them down JUST to get them off your screen and concentrate on the question at hand. Or are you easily distracted?  But I could ask this of you.  When atheists are asked a question why is it bombarded with christian claims of people they do not know? Why are those claims so broard that they seem to know each and every atheist so "intimately"?  Why is it that questions are posed to atheists when the answerer is not looking for an actual answer from an atheist but more of someone that agrees with them. Why (such as this question) do people ask questions of atheists when you know all you are looking for is someone to say "yes they want to know the word of god they just won't admit it".

This, all in an effort to convince themselves that what they promote as their "faith" is really rational and copacetic.     In addition, those, like the terrorists who wish to kill us because of fundamentalist persons and organizations who believe as fervently as they do, must be surveilled, monitored and watched closely. This due to the fact they are the ruination of mankind, and most closely associated with a desire for the decimation of mankind in order to fulfill their fantasy regarding an apocalypse and the Book of Revelations; which they have routinely distorted and falsified to conflate with their warped views regarding the second coming of their false savior.    May you praise your God, from whom all blessings are suppose to flow. May you and your false God guide you to praise all creatures here below. May you and your false God praise ye heavenly hosts. May you praise your false Father, Son and Holy Ghost!!    As it was in the beginning, is now and ever shall be, world without end, amen! No room for your fantasy in that regard, is there?

English does not have a separate word for collective "you".

And the Italian singular tu, has an equivalent in you as well. You can differentiate the two identical forms according to the context.  For example, if you want to say "Ti amo", you say "I love you." If you want to say "Vi amo", you say the exact same thing, "I love you." If you want to underline the fact that you love several persons, not just one, you may say "I love you all" (Vi amo tutti).     Hope this helps a bit, and by the way, I apologize for my Italian. I guess it's a little rusty.|`|lOp75aGUaa	I'm afraid I don't understand fully. so... Copy and paste.     The form of a verb used (in English and other languages) with the pronouns thou and you in its singular sense (or their equivalents in other languages).        The second-person singular of "to be" is "art" or "are".     Second person pronoun is just "you"    second person singular, "hey, what are you doing?"    second person plural, "Hey, what are you all doing?"

At work the boss comes in and says, "Hey you guys (men & women), stop talking and get to work!"      Various people make excuses why they aren't working.

And even if you didn't have eye contact, you'll answer if you want to get something to eat.    After answering, I've been told many times, "I wasn't talking to you."    I just smile.|`|hIk0lWT2aa	You know what? Sometimes we get confused by the word "you" too! However, you can generally just figure out what the person is trying to say, or if not, just ask them. :o)

Yes, they had a concept of humans living on a horizonal plane and God/gods on a vertical plane, get out your graphs from math class.

The Bible states that he spoke about the currents of the sea and air, and the motions of heavenly bodies, and the nature of animals from other areas.|`|A90SRsTxaa	No where in the Bible does it say the Earth is flat. One scripture refers to is as a circle. Isa 40:22    [It is] he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth, and the inhabitants thereof [are] as grasshoppers; that stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain, and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in:     What do you see when you look at a full moon. You see a circle.     When it talks about the four corners of the earth it is talking about the the points on a compass. North, South, East, West.    You guys completely fail with this argument. It has been said so many times. It is really said for you who would say that Christians cannot think for themselves, yet you just parrot bogus information of some website.|`|EBGdlo35aa	1) Did you know those who wrote the bible thought the earth was flat?    No - and neither do you know any such thing.      2) But do you understand that now that we know that the earth is round and inside the earth is a molten core and above the earth is our atmosphere, it makes no sense to continue to believe in hell and heaven?    Well, first, we DON"T know all of these things.    Second, what we learn from your statement is NOT that "it makes no sense to continue to believe in hell and heaven".  What we learn is that "it makes no sense to continue to believe in the things you write".      3) the bible makes several references to the 'four corners of the earth'    As do we today.  Do you REALLY believe that people who make use of this euphemism think the earth is "flat"?  What about people who talk about sunrise and sunset - do you REALLY believe that everyone who uses such phrases thinks that the sun orbits the earth?  If not - then why do you expect the ancients to write in a manner more exacting than modern, well-educated people?  Not very logical of you, is it?

55db1dbbab55471fd7e483514f53d0a4aa	Hi!  Only having sex for procreation? Where did you get that idea?  Here is SOME of what the Bible says about sex and marriage.    The book of 1 Corinthians chapter 7:1-5 where the Apostle Paul writes:     1Now for the matters you wrote about: It is good for a man not to marry.[a] 2But since there is so much immorality, each man should have his own wife, and each woman her own husband. 3The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife, and likewise the wife to her husband. 4The wife's body does not belong to her alone but also to her husband. In the same way, the husband's body does not belong to him alone but also to his wife. 5Do not deprive each other except by mutual consent and for a time, so that you may devote yourselves to prayer. Then come together again so that Satan will not tempt you because of your lack of self-control.     When I was younger I had pre-marital sex because I was not following God's word as well as I should have.  After my divorce I became more aware of things and have dated different men for long periods of time without having sex. I think by waiting it will be more satisfying if I ever decide to marry again.     Have a great day!|`|4GiIXWUXaa	Well sweets, i can overlook the sheer vehemence and contemptible attitude with which you are "asking" this question to provide you with an appropriate response.    1) A person's religious beliefs does not make them any less human.  2) EVERYONE makes mistakes, including YOU.  3) Before you judge someone, make sure you have committed no sin yourself; Be merciful in your judgments as with the measure you use it, it will be measured to you  4) You must have known some pretty lousy Christians for you to be this angry and generalise us all by the few that you've met. I am sorry.  5)  Now, To answer honestly, YES i have had premarital sex.  5B. YES i know that it is a sin.  5C: I enjoyed nearly every minute of it.... each time.  5D. I could "get laid" any time that i wanted to. (I'm darn pretty!) I never get rejected, i am the one who rejects. ;)  5E. I did it, because i was bored and i figured that i would not be getting married any time soon (IF you must know).  5F. I am still not married; I am not in a relationship hence, no sex.  I have only ever broken my conscience and had sex when i was in a relationship. (And once, just because) I do not sleep around.   5G: I am 50% sorry because i know that it is wrong to have sex before marriage. But i really do enjoy it wholly. ;) So, it's between myself and God since i am accountable for my own actions.  5H. I will not condemn anyone because i myself am not sinless in this area. So your judgments are wasted on me; i am not affected.  5I.  It's really none of your business and i would not have answered, save you seemed so angry i thought it might help you.  5J: I am honest, which means i am no hypocrite.  5K: When was the last time that you did something against your own conscience? And what religion are you? I could make the same spiteful comments towards you, but i will not. We are all human, no one is perfect and above making mistakes, not even Christians.       Hope this helps you out.  xoxo  ?|`|OT4SrmDXaa	Atheist, why did God put pleasure in sex if it were for only procreation?  The bible says the marriage bed is undefiled. Meaning he wanted that pleasure to be between man and wife whenever they pleased. The  Spilling the seed you refer to was because God wanted Israel be fruitful and multiply. If you had Oral sex you would be braking the law but that's not what the law was referring to. Remember the marriage bed is undefiled, meaning what you choose to do together is alright as long as you don't bring a third party into play. It meant during intercourse God wanted them to procreate. Get your facts straight.    No I have not had Premarital sex. I have several offers from woman and I ignored them. Don't want to be with a woman unless its the right one.      If I was like you then I would probably be taking women up on there offers but I am not like you.|`|ZjqdLSv2aa	I'm a Christian and I don't follow the premarital sex rule.    Sure, I'm Christian, but I'm also human. So as a compromise I set a rule for myself. Only have sex with women I love.    Just because we're Christians doesn't mean we're the bible thumpers you probably met, based on your negativity towards us.    Even we unload on our girlfriend's chests and face every once in a while.|`|4g9UKpyVaa	"premarital sex is wrong" is what the church and our parents say. so it's like a sin to our parents.

I regret it and I would take it back if I could.  But I know that God has forgiven me.  Yes, you are right, I should stick to what the bible says.      But that is why I so desperately need my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and why I trust in Him completely.  He has rescued me from my sin, He is rescuing me from my sin and He will rescue me from my sin.    A side note: sex between a husband and wife is not solely for procreation.  When a husband and wife have sex in a most loving selfless way, and not necessarily because they are trying to have a baby, it is a most God glorifying and wonderful gift and that is how God designed sex between a husband and wife.|`|7kvTHzj0aa	psh, i wish it was because im devoted to the bible.|`|SgtoKNBgaa	having pre-marital sex is detestable in the eyes of God.. it should be after the marriage..|`|RKlMDz4Eaa	im christian and i have had pre-marital sex. i dont think it says anywhere in the bible that we cant, its just a church teaching. but i could be wrong im only 14. but i do know that it is ok by the church to have pre-maritial sex if you are immature and theres another excuse but i forgot it. and of course because of my age im immature ;)|`|CWDTEV82aa	OMG all the time all the time my friend    God blessed them, saying, "Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth."Genesis 1:22    also it says in Player 2:52 god said look at that hot chick sweet jesus! just kidding not about the 1st one tho|`|25f028ca58dc6cd9e4f9158a8def7156aa	Let me put it this way. I am in the late 20s now, became a Christian at the age of 14 and currently not yet married (dating though). I haven't had sex yet and will do that once married sometime soon. Its possible to not do it if you have the determination and know what you are doing, true sometimes your feelings get wild and wacky, but everything can be subjected to what you want. Its called self control and all human beings have it.

It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation.     The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what!     Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead.

aWHvHIr1aa	The reason I think Jews don't believe Jesus is the Messiah is because they can't hear the voice of God.  Therefore, the scriptures being the "words of God" have become meaningless.  It doesn't matter which scriptures as the author of the scriptures was rejected.    The Tanach records about 2000 years of people being able to hear the voice of God and see God's work of redemption on the earth.  Then, for no explainable reason, they say the age of the prophet ended and the era of rabbis not being able to hear the voice of God or see Him working began.    The time this began was about the time when Solomon's Temple was rebuilt and renamed, Herod's Temple.  Therefore, the time began about the time Rome conquered Israel and started appointing the high priest who was to enter the Holy of hollies and pray for the sins of Israel.      Today, if a rabbi told the congregation, "God spoke with me today." the rabbi would be discredited by the congregation.  Jesus came during this era and the Bible records, ***10He was in the world, and though the world was made through him, the world did not recognize him. 11He came to that which was his own, but his own did not receive him. 12Yet to all who received him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God 13children born not of natural descent,[c] nor of human decision or a husband's will, but born of God.***  http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?sea...    For example, Elijah, the prophet, is to come as well.  But, how can the prophet come and be accepted as they say if they say the era of the prophet has ended?  How could the prophet be welcomed during Passover if hearing the voice of God is discredited?    Take this idea, one step further.    When Herod's Temple was destroyed,    1.  the men were killed  2.  the women were raped  3.  infants were born asking questions about who their fathers were and how they could worship now that the Temple was destroyed.    20 years later, the Jews compiled the Talmud to answer these questions.  It was here where the lineage changed from men to women and the activities of the Temple were no longer needed.    For example, as Jeffrey said, ***Thisnk about this scenario...  What if I needed to make a sacrifice in the Temple. I live in Los Angeles, CA USA. Would I have to travel all the way to Jerusalem to have a sacrifice performed. Do you see how rediculous this would be?    So today we pray. And prayer takes the place of the animal sacrifice.  Jews have not sacrificed an animal since the temple was destroyed 2000 years ago (70 CE)***    When has walking to the Temple and sacrificing the best animal been practical?  Which Jew making the sacrifice couldn't say, "It is "rediculous" for me to stop working make this sacrifice when praying is an acceptable alternative."    Who wouldn't do choose not to make the sacrifice if the Torah offered this as an alternative?  Again, changes to the Torah and Tanach were made by the Talmud so that the worship of God as they mandate and describe is no longer needed as Jeffrey explains.    There is no evidence that the Talmud, otherwise known as the oral Torah, came from Moses as is claimed.  ***Along with that written text of the Torah, G-d gave Moses an oral explanation. We can thus speak of two Torahs - the Written Torah and the Oral Torah....The Oral Torah was originally meant to be transmitted by word of mouth. It was relayed from teacher to student in such a way so that if the student had any questions he would be able to ask and thus avoid ambiguity. A written text, however, no matter how perfect, is always subject to misinterpretation. Furthermore, the Oral Torah was meant to cover the infinitude of cases which would arise in the course of time. It could never have been written in its entirety.***  http://talmud.faithweb.com/articles/what...    If we believe ***It could never have been written in its entirety.***, then how we get a written copy.      If the need for an oral Torah was ***It was relayed from teacher to student in such a way so that if the student had any questions he would be able to ask and thus avoid ambiguity.*** then how is the current written Talmud able to avoid the ambiguity?    It is impossible to state something can't be done and then do it.  Arguments for Moses giving 2 Torahs are self-defeating.  There can't be a need for Moses to do something and that future generations following what Moses did would not have to do.      If Moses had to have an oral Torah in addition to the written, then we do too.  If our oral Torah could be written down, then Moses' could have as well.    The only way this changes is if the need no longer exists.  Without the Temple, the need no longer exists.    So can there be a priest in the line of Aaron today.  No, because Ezra 2 mandated 100% proof of lineage....not the argument that my DNA demonstrates 100% proof that the line was NEVER broken.    Can another Messiah in the line of David come today?  No, not to our knowledge.  There are no records of lineage that gets us to that can get us to the times when the lineage was written and prove-able.  Ask the Mormons or ask for the proof.      Therefore, your question needs to be,     ***If the Messiah was to come today, how would this messiah be able to fulfill all the prophecies when Jesus did not.***  Make Jesus the standard to be....in comparison.      Will the new messiah be able to hear the voice of God?  Jesus did.  Will the new messiah be able to prove David in his lineage?  Jesus did.  Will the new messiah be able to prove He was from God?  Jesus did when God raised|`|hR7OsqtRaa	In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"    The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.    There are a lot more chapters and verses mentioned in the below website along with music, speeches and praise and worship.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    Jesus is God. He is alive forever.    The questions usually asked are:-    1) Did Jesus really exist?  2) Is Jesus God?  3) If Jesus is God, then why did He keep praying to the Father in Heaven? How can the Father and Jesus be one God? Why did Jesus have to suffer on the Cross?  4) What is the Holy Spirit?  5) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?      It would not be possible to give a short answer to these questions .    I suggest you visit the below website.    After visiting the below website, you would get a lot of answers.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus  specifically.)  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became  flesh (John 1:1-14)  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as  "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT  (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)  16. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) and "God" also be called the  Mighty God in Isaiah 10:21  17. Jesus is able to raise Himself from the dead (John 2:19-21)  18. Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things  by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship  is used in each place.)  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts  7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father  that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John  8:58.  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see  Exodus 3:14.  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).  26. Jesus is the One who will judge you on judgement day (John 5:22-23). Only God can be the judge.  27. Jesus forgives sins (Luke 5:20) (Luke 24:47,Acts 10:43) .Only God can forgive sins.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com|`|AA10405801	This question gets asked several times a week!

The page that deals specifically with your question is:    http://jewsforjudaism.org/index.php?opti...    Personally, my biggest problems with Jesus as the messiah are:    the claim that God impregnated a young girl    the idea that God would demand human sacrifice for appeasement (God said repeatedly that he hates human sacrifice)    Jesus repeatedly violating Jewish law unnecessarily and being very disrepectful to his fellow Pharisees (yep, Jesus was a Pharisee and is portrayed as repeating many of the teachings of his predecessors)    the idea that God would perform a "bait and switch" regarding his covenant with the Jewish people and his instructions on what to look for in prophets|`|tePg8kO4aa	Same reasons why the Christians don't think Joan of Arc is.|`|cuZRfMjeaa	Look at this website...    http://www.askmoses.com/en/article/255,3...|`|IBhisfm9aa	They say he did not fulfill any of the prophecies of the coming messiah. He had to be directly from the line of David and Solomon and he wasn't since Joseph was not his real father. He had to end wars for good as we can see there are wars to this day. He had to rebuild Jerusalem, that hasn't happened yet. God name is Jehovah according to scripture and he was suppose to raise his name as the only name to call god, that hasn't happened. In fact in the new testament i don't even think he says the name Jehovah. He is suppose to be a man of flesh and blood not a deity. No matter how you look at it not even sin is destroyed, he failed that one also.|`|bhd1KbxXaa	I'm sure there are lots of reasons for this and it probably varies from person to person, but let me give one big reason why I think they do not believe in Jesus as the Messiah.     WRONG EXPECTATIONS.    The Bible has two types of Messianic prophecies.  One type refers to the first coming of the Messiah as a servant, one who suffers.  The second refers to the Messiah as coming as a King and reigning.  The Jews were under the rule of the Romans and what they wanted most was for the Messiah to come and free them from the oppressive rule of the Romans.  But that was not why Jesus came the first time. He came to die.  He came as a servant and so He didnt' fit their image of the Messiah.  It wasn't that He didnt' fulfill the requirements.  He did.  He didn't fulfill the group of prophecies concerning his coming as a King to be sure, but those will be fulfilled at His second coming.  I think it was more a matter of wrong expectations than anything else.  Of course, the Pharisees and other religious leaders at that time didn't like Jesus because He exposed their hypocrisy and they felt threatened by Him.  Anti-semitism probably creates a desire not to believe as well.  It is hard to believe that your ancestors missed out on the truth.  For others, I'm sure it is just a matter of lack of knowledge, but they have been taught from when they were little that Jesus is not the Messiah so they just dismiss it without another thought.

Pray for guidence before you get hooked up with the Mormans.|`|CTxGUFZOaa	Any missionary will tell you it is a pleasure to teach anyone in their home, and it doesn't matter if their home smells like smoke, which is a very, very common situation.  They are there to share the greatest message in the world with you, is all that really matters.       If your parents are fine with your receiving the missionary discussions, I wish to emphasize very strongly that it is in your best interest to have the missionaries teach in your home with your parents present.  Going somewhere else might give your parents cause for worry that things are too secretive; that is something they may well find a problem with, which could damage your relationship.  The Church promotes communication between parents and children, and it is important that your parents know what is going on in your life.       Since you love your parents and know the Church would be a positive thing for them as well as for yourself, having the discussions in your home will give them a chance to hear, understand, and accept the gospel with you.  And if you ask them not to smoke with the missionaries there, but to be there for you, and get to know the missionaries with you, I think you will be happy with the results.|`|U24VtSlZaa	You can meet with 'em outside if you prefer.

But if you are that self-conscious about it, I'm sure the missionaries won't mind scheduling the appointment at a different venue. They might actually be glad that you thought of them when choosing a place to meet. Don't be afraid to tell the missionaries how you feel about it.|`|5CuN9h20aa	I am sure your house wont be the first one they have seen that smells like smoke.

You could even meet at the Young Women's President's house or one of her counselors... do you know anyone who is LDS?      I am sure the missionaries are used to situations like this - we understand people smoke, drink, everything... I don't think they would care.  You can ask them if they mind, or even suggest meeting somewhere else.  No big deal.    Good for you.  The LDS church is true and the gospel is true!
1Vih78dZaa	If you go to the site I've linked to below and scroll down the page, you'll see pictures of how a .45 bullet splatters when it hits a steel plate at 50 yards. Ask yourself if flying through another 25 yards of air is likely to slow it down that much.    If you scroll down a bit further, you'll see someone mention a serviceman in Viet Nam being awarded a Silver Star for killing several enemy soldiers with the classic 1911A1 .45 pistol at measured ranges from 7 to 97 yards.    I'm sure what you're talking about is indeed a myth.|`|WX1b747Iaa	Folded over how many times?

Note that the .357 was shot from a 4" barrel, the .45 from a 5".|`|H4bYFqwPaa	that's a myth. why don't you ask the mythbusters on the discovery channel?|`|Nf0FLjGhaa	never heard of it, no. of course, it's plausibility depends on a few factors.  first, what type of .45? a .45 ACP, or .45 colt? (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cartri... .45 colt is 4th from the left, .45 ACP is 4th from the right)    second, what is it being fired from? the longer the barrel (to a certian limit, of course) the more power.    third, amount of powder and bullet weight. more powder means more power. a smaller bullet will be faster, while a larger bullet is slower with lower penetration    fourth, how is blanket being held? a blanket, tightly strung between two poles stretches, and therefor weakens, the fibers. a loosely-held blanket can give, and catch the bullet, much like kevlar in bullet proof vests    additionally, the distance will gretly slow the bullet, reducing it's energy at impact, with a proportional decrease in penetrating ability    assuming a typical .45 ACP round, fired from a basic 1911 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:M1911_... ) or similar handgun, into a loosely-held wool blanket, i'd say it's plausible that the blanket would not be penetrated

I was kind of hoping because I was thinking about my former mother-in-law (who was just a lovely, caring person but I'm not so sure that she believed in Jesus) and the thought of her being in complete darkness condemned to hell just makes me want to cry.

BrJGHetsaa	"Soul Searching" is just an honest, self evaluation...it can be a self evaluation of your conduct, something you have done, your beliefs, or something you plan on doing...Bottom line you mitigate your reasons of why you make a certain decision or take a certain action...For example: You find a wallet with $10,000 in it...Nobody knows you find it...You could keep the money ...guilt free...Do you ??? Or do you try to find the rightful owner...What arguments can you find to justify keeping the Wallet....What arguments can you find to return it to the owner...Weigh those two argument ...make your decision....There you go...There term "Soul" refers to your self...Your values, your inner thought, ideals, etc which make the "soul"...You search these to find your answer...It's done in your mind...and not with the help of outside parties....Good Luck...Take Care|`|u1vC5c77aa	oooh, you should not have asked that question here.|`|voa0KReTaa	to find their career, they travel and look at jobs and see whats right fir them.|`|wzqahEqiaa	Soul searching means discovering who you are and finding your own identity.

qRFTEBlGaa	Gods Word, the Bible. This inexhaustible source of divine wisdom is powerful in helping us to overcome wrong practices and conform our lives to God's will. (Hebrews 4:12) It is through the Bible that we come to know Jehovah by name and see the implications of his name. (Exodus 3:14) We realize that Jehovah can become whatever he choosesa loving Father, a righteous Judge, a victorious Warriorin order to fulfill his purposes. And we see how his word always comes true. As we study Gods Word, we come to say, as did the psalmist: I have trusted in your word.    When you begin to experience the blessings of living by Bible standards, your appreciation for Gods Word will increase. This will lead to an even greater blessingyou will come to love its divine Source, Jehovah God. This is what the love of God means, that we observe his commandments; and yet his commandments are not burdensome.1?John 5:3.    Pointing us to Jehovah, the divine Source of understanding, Proverbs 3:6 next states: In all your ways take notice of him, and he himself will make your paths straight. Taking notice of Jehovah involves keeping close to him in prayer. Wherever we may be and no matter what situation may arise, we have immediate access to him in prayer.|`|a43c635a9767f924cfd929c6c43f2501aa	God|`|45Mmu3SFaa	The true living word of God, the bible...|`|2vf6tu8Oaa	It just could be back to you for this question, which may, how would you define yourself from the divine source ?

JQa86WoVaa	Not to be melodramatic but without any sorts of religion, humanity would probably end.

It pacifies those with weak minds who are afraid to not have the answers to life's big questions. I suppose they'd probably go crazy and possibly become violent, were it not for religion being there to soothe them with comforting illusions about an invisible man in the sky who's watching everything they do, judging your worthiness to enter heaven.

yCTxg4t5aa	It's not like any spells ive heard of, especially with a paperclip, coins usually mean prosperity though. And it defiantly wouldn't be Wiccan, unless its a nice spell. maybe someones just playing around.|`|Tvc6Tmz5aa	Taking a guess here but it sounds very much akin to a prosperity type practice.. I know several Italian families who place coins at every entrance and on every window sill for that purpose. I'm thinking it's more along the lines of a folklore thing than anything else.|`|DpPAUqyKaa	That doesn't sound like a Wiccan spell, unless it was for prosperity or something...   If it brings evil, it's not Wiccan. :)|`|a8kAassWaa	Wicca is basically a religion that is about minding your own business and living peaceably with your neighbors and environment. Wiccans are eager to draw parallels between themselves and biblical Christianity for the sake of earning credibility, but what does the Bible have to say about this religion? You wont find the word wicca in the Bible, so lets evaluate the beliefs in light of what God says about them.    Wicca spells are idolism Romans 1:25 says, They exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshipped and served created things, rather than the Creator Who wants to settle for second best? In Isaiah 40, God paints a very cool picture of how much greater the Creator is than His creation. If you are worshipping anything besides the Creator, you are just spinning your wheels.    Wicca spells bring false hope  Hebrews 9:27 says, Man is destined to die once, after that, to face judgment. God says we get one chance at life, and that is it. There are no do-overs. If we dont accept Gods gift of Jesus in our lifetime, He judges us as unwilling to be in His presence, and we are sent to Hell.    Wicca spells bring disillusionment  Mark 7:8 says, You have let go of the commands of God and are holding on to the traditions of men. God is God, and we are not. We have a decision to make. Are we going to take God at His word and adopt His worldview, or not? Knowing God is hard work that takes a lot of discipline. Wicca is a religion that takes a pack of lies, ties it in a romantic ribbon, and searches out a well-intentioned, but lazy and gullible mark to sell its hollow doctrines.    Deuteronomy 18:10-12 says, Let no one be found among you who practices divination or sorcery, interprets omens, engages in witchcraft, or casts spellsAnyone who does these things is detestable to the LORD... Wicca witchcraft is a sin and God hates it. Why? Because it is an attempt to cut off our dependence on God and get answers apart from Him.    This is what sin is all about. Sin isnt just a heinous, socially disagreeable action. Sin is our decision to disagree with God on any topic  to rebel against Him. Sin is saying, God, I want to live my life MY WAY. Romans 3:23 says, For all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God. Romans 6:23 says, For the wages of sin is death This isnt bodily death, this is spiritual death: eternal separation from God and all the blessings that His presence brings. This is the definition of Hell: the absence of Gods presence. That is what our sin buys for us.    Thankfully, Romans 6:23 doesnt end there. It goes on to say, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord. God knew that we would all rebel in one way or another, and he provided a way for us to avoid that separation.|`|6aIuZZi7aa	It isn't Wicca, because Wiccans abide by the three-fold law, which is that whatever energy is sent out will be returned. If the practice is known to be voodoo, then it is a voodooist, or another witch. I think it is more important that you find out who amongst your friends, family or co-workers that would hex you.|`|bwiCLBnmaa	Why do you think that it may be a spell. Maybe someone was really bored?

These are all conscious effort on our part.|`|kpi69PHWaa	Absolutely. Love is a verb, it's voluntary.

Sadness and tears. Sickness and death. All I can say is, it won't matter if your life was 17 years or 120 years, relative to eternity both are like the blink of an eye. God has the eternal perspective that we don't. Sometimes there is just no way to see what he sees until we are on the other side. Faith isn't easy. Here is a verse that I hope encourages you.    2 Corinthians 4:16-18 (New International Version)     16Therefore we do not lose heart. Though outwardly we are wasting away, yet inwardly we are being renewed day by day. 17For our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all. 18So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen.

Let me say something really hard though. I thought I was a pretty good Christian for many years. I listened to a lot of sermons and did Bible study but a few years ago God really put me through the wringer and showed me I needed to study just the Bible. I found studying from the beginning to end and starting over again revealed that an awful lot of what I thought I knew wasn't true. For one thing I can tell you God is forgiving but not compromising. Let me give an example that shocks most people who have been taught God is happy with whatever we do except for Hitler or the like.    Sa 6:6 And when they came to Nachons threshingfloor, Uzzah put forth his hand to the ark of Elohim, and took hold of it; for the oxen shook it. 7 And the anger of ???? was kindled against Uzzah; and Elohim smote him there for his error; and there he died by the ark of Elohim. 8 And David was displeased, because ???? had made a breach upon Uzzah: and he called the name of the place Perez-uzzah to this day. 9 And David was afraid of ???? that day.    It seemed like a good and reasonable thing Uzzah did except he was not to touch the ark as it is a thing most Holy and only the Levites cold touch it.    Cain made what sounded like a nice offering to God it did not contain the blood sacrifice that God said was necessary. God is looking for absolute obedience and to a lot more than most are aware of. I am tired and need to go to bed but I will tell you somethings and if you like email and I will prove them by scripture another day.    There are many false preachers today. Most are false teachers. Very very few are going to heaven. God is looking for the kind of faith and obedience that Abraham had that led him even to sacrifice his own son in obedience to God. Doctrine is important and heresies will take you to hell. A lot of what is practiced today is heresy. Much of what is really being practiced is like the things going on in Jerusalem before the siege (which was horrible) and the Babylonian captivity.  Read Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekial, There is a reason so much of the scripture is dedicated to this time. Understanding this opens the rest of time.    I am really sorry for your friend and I will pray for you both as I know it is hard for you too. Read the Bible with her as much as you can.|`|NPV35jmQaa	Im sort of an Athiest but I say that the supernatural being out there has no control over the situations on Earth.But it can observe.|`|2tR5zKEuaa	Gods promise is not that anything bad  wont happen to us, it is that he will be there when they do.|`|OMs8tKlJaa	Im so sorry to hear all that.. Yeah god works in mysterious ways.. and i hate to sound like a broken record, but maybe he's testing you because you have something big in your life you need to do, maybe this situation you are in with your friend is supposed to be the cornerstone that pushes you to go to college and find a cure to cancer? you never know. sometimes its hard to always be faithful, even in the bible gods' followers were pissed at him for the things he did.. Job was a perfect servant for god and look how well that ended up..|`|FmefX0Nyaa	You never know. God has many surprises and many more to come and who knows he may heal your friend of the aneurysm. Maybe he is using her in is own way to bring people closer to him. Not in a bad way but a way that she can tell them of him.    I am not much to preach but one of my friends actually got over a Brain tumor (Orange size) that he has had since he was 4! It was amazing cause he didn't even get the surgery that he needed. He just woke up one morning, went to the doctor, and the doctor came in saying he had no clue what happened. It was truly a miracle.    So who knows he may cure your friend also.|`|nSsIGlF1aa	the Lord called my husband home two months ago today... he was thirty three with no health problems,,, just a sudden heart attack and within minutes he was gone... Now why does God do the things he does? God does not take any of us to evil, however He will allow us to go thru some hard times, and He will allow us to experience roads in life that no answers are due to us, BUT God is an amazing source of  comfort, He can and will if we allow Him to comfort us, and those around us.... I will pray for your friend, and for you as well.... Please know God is a just a God and even though there are no good words to give you, or advice to make this easier on you or yoru friend KNOW THAT God is there to help her and you... God Bless You and Keep You|`|dZMHd5PMaa	God didn't point his finger at your friend and say you are going to suffer horrible terrible things in your life. I AM NOT SAYING THAT YOUR FRIEND SINNED, but when sin entered the world then bad things entered the world as well. Bad things happen to good people just as they happen to bad people that is just the way of the world. I have a friend at church who was diagnosed with lung cancer, she got a clean bill of health from her lung caner and then 2 months later found out that she had a brain tumor. She passed away this week leaving behind her family. Was it fair no it wasn't fair. We have to lean on God thru the good times and the bad that is what keeps your faith strong.
ylzPAWaxaa	I would say let them know with actions if you really want to. there is not shame in just not sharing it, but do not hide it live your life and people will respect you.|`|AWCx0Blzaa	First choose your own friends that you know will be okay with it, don't randomly say it like, 'hey I'm bi! can you pass the milk?" which will make it the foundation of everyone's first impression/judgement before they open up. Warm up to people and try to know them a bit first, be nice and just mention it casually if it comes up in a conversation such as if they assume you are straight etc and try to hook you up with someone or ask about you past relationships.|`|aPcw0sz7aa	You tell them that you like both guys and girls =)|`|0k2xuCqYaa	With you being a new guy in school its already going to be hard enough to fit in.

AA10100036	I'm not Muslim, I'm sorry, but I would think the best person to ask about all of this would be your boyfriend.  He knows the culture, whats acceptable, and his sister.  Try asking his advice on how to go about this.    Something else you should consider - have you thought long and hard about this?  I don't want to sound judgmental, but your courtship is highly atypical for an American.  I understand that it is the standard for Muslims and you want to respect that, and that's excellent.  I just think you should take deeper consideration when making this decision because it's so atypical.    Best of luck.|`|lVkaALbOaa	i'm muslim egyptian girl   i'll do my best to give you my advise try to call her and be friendly with her and show your respect to muslims and islam don't wear cut t-shirts or mini jubes try to be moderate i want to tell you that if you'll marry muslim guy you have to be honest with him don't hang out with guy's try to keep him happy and don't worry she'll like you inshaa allah       wish you all happines and best luck forever

3SYnZEZ9aa	Great question!  How do we really know that?  You have to look at the evidence.     The OT written before Mary's time said that a virgin would give birth to someone who would deliver us.    Mary could have just taken that prophesy and ran with it.    But there's more that was out of her control.  The Savior had to be from Bethlehem, Nazareth and Egypt.  The Savior had to be killed and live again.    But maybe the church authorities invented these stories about the crucifixion and everything.  But if they did that, Peter wouldn't have denied Christ.  The disciples would not have ran like cowards.  And we wouldn't of had that ominous warning of Judas the betrayer.     Edit:  Around Romans 5:1-12  gives theological reasons as to why the Savior had to be born of a virgin and not have a Y-Chromosome from Adam.    Edit2: Mary had to be a virgin for the conception and birth of Jesus.  After that, it did not matter if she had relations with Joseph and had other kids.  This is were I disagree with Catholics.....|`|U24VtSlZaa	As a Christian, I've thought about this quite a bit.      As far as I can tell, Mary was a virgin when God selected her, that much is clear.  (And if by any chance she wasn't, I for one won't hold it against her.)    That's all I have so far.    edit:  the "Virgin Birth" assertion is all before-the-fact:  in the prophesies, Isaiah being the best-known.  True that the other prophesies surrounding the event turned out to be accurate, giving strong credibility to the prophet, but a true skeptic will hold out for the other possibility.  For some, this will be a deal-breaker;  if the virgin birth isn't a fact then all bets are off;  for others, it's just an interesting topic for discussion.  I say, there's room at the table for all of us.|`|WiIviMv5aa	because God claimed it was so.  Does God lie?  No way!!|`|a43c635a9767f924cfd929c6c43f2501aa	She didn't lie.

NfSLXHU3aa	One of the Kindergarten teachers was teaching the kids French.  They were so enthusiastic to learn.      I think it's stupid to wait until high school to learn new languages.  Usually it's not taught in Elementary Schools because of budget restraints.    Being in California, many people have Spanish as their first language.  If you are bilingual, you are more likely to be hired for jobs.    The only reason I could think of with someone telling you that learning spanish is wrong is if you live in an area that has a different language that's more popular.  Like in areas of Canada, French is spoken more often than Spanish.    My son won't take the Spanish class in high school cause he's had the teacher in another class and dislikes him.|`|cb9c8be6c633186631612c54c6c11d0aaa	i am learning Spanish now,   i had read an instruction sheet in English on an item i had just bought ,and glanced at the Spanish version, and realized that i actually understood Spanish,   why? because i already speak French and Italian, and most Latin languages are similar,  so? up for my 5th language..and i am really excited about it. ;-)   also speak German..i did forget how to write it..    and? i will teach it to my children and grandson...he is already learning French and i sneak some German in there,children learn so fast..  my children do speak French..|`|GyrG1roTaa	because in america they only speak english thats the mentality of many people here...they fail to realize that someone who knows more than one language is better of,  everything is going global you kinda need to know more than one.  i myself speak two and working on my third|`|IEliUISJaa	There is nothing wrong about learning spanish, most people who say that it is bad or crap are most likely raceist.|`|45u7BzCUaa	Forget about learning Spanish, learn english.

Chinese is the way to go though.  Think about it, they don't have much land, but they're growing and growing!!!!  Punjab would be another language to learn.

In 1848 the Fox sisters of Hydesfield in New York State claimed to have communication with the disembodied spirits of the dead and launched the Spiritualist movement, which claimed many adherents in the nineteenth century. The claims of spiritualists and others as to the reality of ghosts were investigated by the Society for Psychical Research, founded in London in 1882. The Society set up a Committee on Haunted Houses and a Literary Committee which looked at the literature on the subject. Apparitions of the recently deceased, at the moment of their death, to their friends and relations, were very commonly reported. One celebrated example was the strange appearance of Vice-Admiral Sir George Tryon, walking through the drawing room of his family home in Eaton Square, London, looking straight ahead, without exchanging a word to anyone, in front of several guests at a party being given by his wife on 22 June 1893 whilst he was supposed to be in a ship of the Mediterranean Squadron, manoeuvering of the coast of Syria. Subsequently it was reported that he had gone down with his ship, the HMS Victoria, that very same night, after it had collided with the HMS Camperdown following an unexplained and bizarre order to turn the ship in the direction of the other vessel. Such crisis apparitions have received serious study by parapsychologists with various explanations given to account for them, including telepathy, as well as the traditional view that they represent disembodied spirits.    Summoning or exorcising the shades of the departed is an item of belief and religious practice for spiritualists and practitioners of ritual magic. According to a poll conducted in 2005 by the Gallup Organization about 32% of Americans "believe in the existence of ghosts".    i hope that will help u dear ... :)|`|NJbLm7Pyaa	ghost is only our imagination.|`|Ky0UGwSyaa	they are g(ood) hosts as long as you want  to entertain them with your screams and quivering|`|5ifdI69Raa	May be.......  or  May not be.......

Certain circumstances makes us feel about the presence of something unearthly, we draw our hypotheses about ghost etc.    Spirit or "Atma" is termed as a form of energy which drives or regulates a human body. We all know that energy is indestructible, only it changes form.  In the event of death, only the human body becomes non-existent, not the spirit. It remain, perhaps takes another form through another earthly body,  which we call rebirth.  This energy can be felt, which given us the impression that something is present.      There's no end of debate on this, there's end number of examples we have, in favour of existence  of ghost, sometimes rubbishing the same, too.  But in lifetime, we have to go through some or other unearthly feeling for which we find no justification.   Indeed....something exists.|`|mu8gZhCvaa	jus see ur face in mirror,, after tat you wont be afraid of anything...|`|kkHytpEmaa	they exists becuse they can interect with humans by specific other ways i have an experience about them|`|rRC2ap5haa	sometimes i really feel that ghosts really exists but sometimes i feel no. but finally i will say that they don't exists bcoz they r only our illusion nd nothingmore than that. so don't believe on that unless u see them.|`|AA12079139	yes they do exist 'coz if u believe in GOD u got 2 believe in ghost also but  i don't think there's nething 2 worry abt 'em until they don't harm us :) but anyways 4 those who dont want 2 believe in ghost every fact is untrue and 4 those who believe in supernatural powers there's no need 4 any facts.It lies in what u believe not in what others think|`|uHHGy497aa	in cities its hard to find but in village  u may find one after seeing them if  u are  still alive and then reply|`|qTnrq5n9aa	Yes There's Ghosts That Does Really EXIST 1,110%.And It Has Thee Already Proven 1,110%....Take Alot Of Camera Pictures Shot's And Take Alot Of Video's Cameera With You And Sound Recorder's And EVP And Some Other Stuff's Like That...And When You Experience Thee Ghost Make 100% Sure If There Are Really Have A Real Live Ghost Haunting A House And Or You And Or Some Other Stuff's Like That.And Try Get Alot Information As You Possiblity As You Can....And Try Not To Explore Thee Ghost By Your Self Tell Some One Like An Adult And Or A Friend Or A Preist To Seek Help...|`|eQv4bv0aaa	They do exist...They have their different world to leave...

They are a type of energy which is strong only if you feed it fear. Usually they are in mansions which are ancient and they are renovated. But don't worry, you can't find them in your house if it's not a renovated mansion or something like that.|`|443f4529fbbed8636b6a6001f8a4dc50aa	Well here is my opinion:    why do we say some person has seen/experienced it, but I havent.    why do we associate ghost is fear, not joy, happiness, wealth, friendship, creativity, prosperity, and other positive attitudes of life.    its because ghosts are weakness of human conscience and we associate it with our weakness and with fear - death and pain being ultimate fear, we associate ghosts with painful death.    Similarly God does not exit, its human conscience that wants to cling on to a strength and sometimes be lazy and leave ourselves to strength of luck.    In reality there are only three thing s in the universe that exits; MATTER, ENERGY and THOUGHT PROCESS.  There are LAWS of physics and chemistry which govern the working of matter and energy.  There are LAWS of biology which govern, when matter and energy are combined to form a living being.  But there are NO LAWS of THOUGHT PROCESS.    The living being defines the LAWS of THOUGHT PROCESS.  A dog is a faithful animal...., thats the end of his thought process.  A plant does not have a thought process.    Its human who has full fledged capability of having thought process, which runs to infinite directions.    Few of the aspect of thought process of human being have been very week and thats why we have created various ways and means to cling on to some imaginations, like;   Fairy, witch, telepathy, god, ghost etc.    Once upon a time there lived a beautiful fairy and ugly witch - this is man made story, which is realised by us.    But the fear within ourselves makes us from say that God is that Beautiful Fairy and Ghost is that Ugly Witch.  Fear being, what if God stops blessing and what if Ghost comes and make my life pathetic.      Besides weekness, our thought process is very stong also, doing various ceative things...    Just imagine, if God can bless a person and Ghost can destroy a person, why God/Ghost are not doing similar thing to any matter which is lying in abundance on earth or to any animal or plant?  Or why does a rock lying on moon gets a blessing from a God or gets destroyed by an evil.    None of the false imaginations (like God/Ghosts) are doing any effect to humans/animals/plants/matter/energy.  It is only our perception that they are effecting our lives.|`|JPbzT4UHaa	I think ghosts are nothing but souls or spirits that do not attain salvation.i believe in it.or you can see it by yourself in "rescuing mediums" on discovery channel.|`|7BygPgs1aa	ya dou u belive in god. if u do so then obvi there is ghost.|`|eOR1enO8aa	well as humans exists ghost exist too,if one believes|`|ea59fafcee35589a09d5c883178801e1aa	Ghosts!  c dis d most difficult question coz most of the people have different opinions regarding super naturals.  its better to adjust according to situations instead of being worried and discussing those with others, if you found sum unexpected things happening to you than pls suggest it with expert not with any one who is not known..  and most important what we see in movies is totally fictious and no resemblance to reality.

"Fish" :      "To see fish swimming in your dream, signifies insights from your unconscious mind. Thus to catch a fish, represents insights which have been brought to the surface. Alternatively, a fish swimming in your dream may symbolize conception. Some women dream of swimming fish when they get pregnant. The fish is also an ancient symbol of Christianity and Christian beliefs. Consider also the common phrases "like a cold fish", "fish out of water" or something that is "fishy" about a situation.

It's a joke.  The whole set up and cheesy arrangement is just dumb.  But that's a cultural opinion.  i even saw Obama cringe at times.      Someone called SLF answered something similar for me.  I thought it would be good to quote:     "They are brought up to have a very high opinion of themselves and their entire lifestyle seems to revolve around bolstering their own self-pride.Case in point - the cheerleader syndrome. Always cheering on their 'team' with embarrassingly fulsome praise, always bigging themselves and each other up. When you've spent your entire childhood being told how wonderful America the Great is, how fantastic your sports team is, what a warm, wonderful human being you are, how it's wrong to criticise the president simply because he's the president - no wonder they get confused when people laugh at them and fail to see the funny side of their faults - or indeed to see their faults at all."    Take what you want from that.

What about them calling themselves the most Christian nation when their airwaves are filled with pornography and their television shows are filled with gore and sex? What about the idea that anyone can "make it" in America if they work hard enough but there is a huge population of people on welfare because the system is set up to KEEP them on welfare? What about us calling ourselves civilized so we send millions to other countries so their people don't starve when we have people starving here in the U.S.? How about telling us we are a free nation but at the same time, our news stations are designed to keep us afraid because an afraid population is easier to control?

You could either become a diocesan priest in the area where you feel called to work, or you could join a religious order that has missionary priests in different countries.

Admittedly, I'd be trying to fix everything I see wrong in the world. But of course, I'm not sure that fixing things would make us better people. I read a comic strip once and I wish I could remember which one it was, but one character said to another that it wanted to ask God why It allowed certain things to exist. Poverty, I believe was one of them, but there were more listed. Anyway, the other character asks why the first character doesn't ask God. The first character said something akin to, "Because I'm afraid God might ask the same of me." Maybe God wants us to fix our own messes. A lot of things wrong in the world are our fault, and maybe God thinks we'll learn best if we fix them ourselves, or maybe God wants us to be responsible. I'm unsure.    Yet, admittedly, if I had control for awhile I'd prob. try fixing everything wrong I seen in the world, just to see what would happen.

b1294888a8e10ac6a8ff0614d97982ccaa	The last sheaf of the harvest, dressed in a woman's dress or woven into an intricate shape and decked with ribbons, is regarded as the embodiment of the spirit of the crop, the spirit of the growing grain itself. The safe-keeping of this corn dolly over the winter insures fertility for the following harvest, provided that some portion of it is given to cattle and horses to eat, and some portion of it strewn in the field or mixed with the seeds for the next crop.    This practice of saving the spirit of the harvest is extensive throughout Europe.    In Northumberland, the corn dolly is attached to a long pole and carried home to be set up in the barn. In some communities it goes home on the lastload. Sometimes it is fairly small. In parts of Germany, the heavier it is, the better.    On the Isle of Lewis in Scotland, the corn dolly's apron is filled with bread, cheese and a sickle. In other parts of Scotland, the reapers hold races. The man who finishes reaping first designates his last sheaf the corn maiden; the one who finishes last makes his last sheaf into a hag.    In some localities, the corn dolly is made by the first farmer who finishes his harvest and then passed from farm to farm as each farmer finishes his harvest, ending up with the farmer who finishes last. In this case, no one wants the dolly as it is a sign of procrastination.    In Wales, others try to snatch the dolly from the reaper who carries it from the field. If he gets home safe, he gets to keep it on his farm for the rest of the year.    French, Slavonic, and some Germanic regions use the last sheaf to create a Kornwolf, believed to hold a wolf-like spirit that resides in the last sheaf and provides the same life force for the next season. This is a fiercer version of the corn dolly and is sometimes used to scare children.    Today, corn dollies are seen as emblems of abundance.    why corn?    Historically the word corn was applied to the the small hard grain or fruit of a plant. It was used generically to refer to the leading crop of the district. In England, corn was wheat; in Scotland, oats; in the U.S., maize.    How to make a Corn Dolly    The best part of the stem is the top length from the ear (the seed head) down to where the last leaf leaves the stem. Leaving the ear intact, strip off the dead leaves and sort the stems according to size: thick, medium, and fine.    Dry straw must be soaked flat in cold water for about 15 minutes and then stood upright to drain before plaiting.    The Five-Straw Plait is the easiest to work with for a beginner:    1. Tie 5 straws together close to the ears.    2-5. Each time the straw being folded passes over two corners, it is then left and the one at the last corner is picked up and used in its place until the round is completed.    The attractive spiral pattern grows as round succeeds round.    6. When completed, the ends are tied to the starting point below the ears, making a decorative circle.    To feed in new straws, cut the old straw off after it has passed the second straw. The thin end of the new straw is inserted in the hole, making sure of a firm fit which is hidden under the fold of the straw of the next round.    Simple corn dollies can also be made with the standard three-straw plait.    More complex corn dollies involve multiple straws, intricate braids, and sometimes the creation of a straw core shape around which the outer straw is plaited.    A Corn Dolly by any other name    England: Harvest Queen   Kern Baby   Corn Doll   Scotland: Hag   Old Wife   Old woman (Cailleac)   Wales: Hag (Wrach)   Brittany: Mother Sheaf.

3732b991052c52571579d5013ce6442eaa	since i know you personally i can tell you that you already do!!!!!  I love u!|`|eZDoQPg8aa	Here's some suggestions for you, based on how involved one has to get.    Easy - simple things like opening doors  for an elderly person, a mom with her kids and her hands full.  Offer to load the groceries into the car for them.  If in your neighborhood there is someone who could use a hand with something, ask if you can help them out.  Might be anything from carrying a package up the steps to shoveling the snow from their walks.  I routinely helped moms with getting their kids settled in loaner cars when I worked for an auto dealership repair facility.  It's hard to get the toddler car seat installed when you're worrying about little Johnny running off.  I'd watch little Johnny for the mom and help move all the things that seem to go with a child over to their loaner vehicle.  If they were returning a loaner and picking up their vehicle, I'd do the same thing.         A little harder - make time in your schedule weekly to volunteer for a specific cause.  Might be the SPCA, the soup kitchen, the Senior center, Big Brothers/Big Sisters and then do it!    A little harder still - after you have found a cause that you really want to be involved in, really get involved.  Help with fund raising, weekly operations, whatever they need to get the job done.|`|41188d690f5ba5f0d5e1f49744f618d6aa	Compliment people throughout your day.

They've been married for 45 years, I believe, and had  one son. They are just as happy today, as they were when they got  married. Maybe even more.     I did try matching up another friend in highschool. She also was shy.  And so was the guy I introduced her to. They were together several  times in a group situation.

VLv3Vzjnaa	No, I've never noticed that.  Instead, I find that their hypocrisy bleeds over into other areas of their lives.  The sad thing is that they are not "pro-life."  They are pro-fetus.  When it comes to the lives of murdered gay people, they could not care less.  When a 15-year-old boy is shot in the head in school for being gay, and we don't hear a peep from the "pro-life" crowd, that tells us all we need to know about their morality.|`|kVTryKlBaa	Well, Yeah.  think about it, those who love live will enjoy life.

I am also NOT hypocritical in this, I am against the death penalty and I believe in severe punishment for hate crimes|`|ca44e4978f073cfbe40e189d1ad4fdacaa	I haven't noticed any such trend.

I know pro-lifers that have gone through something difficult and still haven't gotten over it. I also know people on the pro-choice angle who lead very admirable lives. They have gotten over various difficulties and have strong relationships with their family and friends.     I don't think you can categorize how well someone's life is going for them based on their views of abortion. It's a random facet of someone's personal beliefs that doesn't impact the path their life will follow.

The fear of the pain is irrational, since theoretically suicide would reduce overall pain in the long run, but it's still a part of how our brains work.|`|YOynOfo5aa	Ive seen the post about the pills...  I think, these people should use guaranteed method..  (i am not trying to be cruel..i do understand depression and thoughts of it well)  I think, they just wish to make it as  painless as possible and in short period of time  Most of all  They need urgent help by specialists, antidepressants etc..  It is so sad either way you look at it|`|QyAyQf3Laa	Though suicide goes against Godly standards so against Jehovah God, if you were to commit suicide, would you:    STAND IN FRONT OF A MIRROR WITH A PICK-AX AND CONTINUE BLUDGENING YOURSELF IN THE HEAD AND UNTIL YOU FINALLY SUCCOMB TO DEATH AND COULDN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE?    OR....    Would you opt for an extreme overdose of painkillers and die silently like Anna Nicole Smith did when she finally succomb to drug overdose?    You may also consider that in the prisons across our nations the most chosen way for inmates who receive the death penalty [to die] is what?? LETHAL INJECTION. This way they feel less pain and are unconscious (as it is commonly practiced - to be put into a sleep as if you go under the knife using anesthesia before surgery) before they receive the lethal dosage that ultimately kills them. They don't really feel that much.    Not many opt for the electric chair anymore.|`|i46hr7duaa	Extreme pain would probably cause you to screw up the attempt.|`|bkX0wiXcaa	There are two types off suicides. People who kill themselves to spite some one or those that are depress. The first type is the ones worrying about pain. They are still having feelings and most off all dreams. They do not really want to die they only want some one else to suffer. What they do not think off is they will never enjoy the results and the people they are trying to punish maybe feel sad or guilty for max two years and then what? The second type is the ones with big problems. Depression kills you from the inside. First to go are your dreams. Then you cannot sleep at all or for very small periods. The nice car or attractive girl you do notice any more. You do not care about anything. Totally anti social or if you at a function it will be totally because you have to. If you want to know who is depress look for the person in the corner standing alone and has really a serious problem with God. I have been there. Seven off my friends and my parents died in three years time. I died with them; the only thing that kept me going was my wife and daughter. However, it also started to change. I was starting to convince myself they are going to die eventually so will follow me later. I will be waiting. I used the pills. Went to nine psychiatrists nothing helped except a question the last psychiatrist ask me. The pain that is in me, do I want my daughter and wife to life with this pain? No. I stop the pills  it only helps the first month then you back down again. I stop seeing the psychiatrists. I ask God what I should do. I will do anything he wants me to do. A strong feeling off peacefulness came into my hart. I got the feeling I have to change everything in my life connecting me to the past. I moved to another town. Left my job (all seven friends was working with me) and start a business, I never went back to my parents house from 1996 up to date. I do not watch old family videos. I am trying to cut out anything witch bring back old memories.  Today I have dreams, notice things and enjoying live up to a point. The business is very successful. Still anti social, scared off losing some one. Over protective with my wife and daughter. And the pain still there. It will never go away but I learn to live with it. Pain was never on my mind when I was thinking off suicide. Even my fear off heights was gone when I was looking down a building standing on the edge of the third floor. Only thing that kept me on the edge was my wife and daughter.|`|z1Trjjdlaa	either way, suicide is a painful death, emotionally.|`|wKGp9BrTaa	Hello,   I believe that its a combination of things.  Firstly Suicide flys in the face of any biological self preservation mechanisms which exist.   Further more it is something which is unknown to us, the pain we will feel is unknown (which is scary in its self), and there is the fear of the dying again which we do not know or understand.  And we all fear most that which we do not understand.    As you say, is it not all a little pointless since it wont matter after its done... well thats a very true and rational point you make, but when the adrenalin is pumping and the senses are screaming that what your doing is nuts, then rationality seems to go out the window some how.    Lastly i would say that not every one is the same, for some it doesnt matter how they die, for others they wish to make a statement, but others, and i feel the majority hope for it to be some what graceful, and as a result they dont want there last act on earth to be spasm-ing to death while excreting themselves and to have there body left for family to find.. etc.    But lastly (x2), and im steeling this from a book i read and i cant remember what its called. But death is an experence, and since its to be the last experence you have, you dont want it to be painful.|`|I40vnqNyaa	Easy for you to say because you are sitting where you are right now.  The reality is they don't actually WANT to die.  They are so concerned about how bad it is going to get further on down the track and the impact that it will have on their family that they are willing to do just about anything  to avoid it.  No one wants to suffer, no one.  They are so immersed in their own sadness they are incapable of making decisions with the same kind of clarity as you are right now.  I guess at the end of the day you have to walk a mile in their shoes to truly understand what motivates them to take that last step and the method they chose to do it.   Lets hope we never have to be in that position.|`|C1SOqQSkaa	Er, if you have a choice, why not choose a painless option?    I don't see anything rational about deciding - oh, wotthehell, I'll just stick a rusty nail in my neck and wait for it to go septic.    Seems to me that if you're going to quit this vale of tears, you have every right to be as self-indulgent as you please.    'Only a few minutes of pain' - what a strange life you must lead!|`|Xcri5qeTaa	Mostly just because it hurts. But if it hurts, there's also the impulse to stop.|`|6ZmiuwWDaa	People are given a life for a reason, to live it, not to take it away from themselves, the reason they are worried about the pain, is like a last defence your being has attempting to stop you from ending your life as pain Is used to stop you from hurting yourself.  It all comes down to survival, so if apart of your mind is infected with the need to commit suicide, you will be held back by the though of pain/death.|`|XN0cYCATaa	Well Perhaps You should Visit a Hospice center and take a survey of those who are in that predicament, after all, you really think you will get a good answer here in R&S ?|`|1iWNBBMfaa	With this argument there's nothing against torturing someone to death because it won't last forever and he won't remember it.|`|WzWaz9hvaa	I think people who are already in a whole lot of pain don't want their last moments to be even more painful? Think of it as the last meal for the man on death row?  I have no idea mate - I have no desire to kill myself, just putting my thoughts out there.|`|aqJJbciQaa	I don't know...

Wishing for an infinite punishment for a finite crime means only one thing - that you don't understand what "infinite" means.|`|AA10741853	Better to make them into nothingness so that there is no-one like that anywhere in the universe.|`|bbb941465ccc4a1ec3a57d5ff0a4b17baa	I don't care how evil someone is, an eternity of torture is disproportionate.  Just punishment is one thing, but what could anyone ever do that would merit them getting tortured forever?|`|tePg8kO4aa	Oh yes, I completely agree with you. Sometimes I wish hell was real for this reason, but then I remember that, by Christians standards, I would be sent directly there, simply for not believing in the concept in the first place.    Bring back medieval torture methods. That should sort them out!|`|AA10332321	Opportunity knocks only once! Make prison hell for such people. We are not sure if they really go to hell!|`|Qn9V5rajaa	There is a difference between revenge and retribution.    Do you really think they should have to suffer "forever" for it?    If hell were real, that would be god would be real.    It would also mean that he's a real a$$hole.    just my thoughts on it :)|`|1V1PzEYZaa	I do not believe that infinite torture is suitable for a finite crime.    The people you mentioned above are most certainly insane. They are ILL. So they should be getting medical help, not burning for eternity.|`|c7pbvYmpaa	Sad world but reality is sad.|`|a20834f6b1047d276d0ed096fdbea380aa	Well, obviously the threat of hell does not deter their anti-social behavior.   So it all comes back to, "Does hell exist?"|`|9m2LvlWdaa	What good is a concept if it has no basis in reality? So we can *say* the "bad" people are going to hell? That does nothing. Fact is, there are bad people in the world. Some people seem to take comfort in thinking silly things like they will be tortured for eternity by some horned entity for their evils. But, that's not reality.|`|1iWNBBMfaa	I don't.  Whatever horrible things people did how can it be morally justified to just do horrible things to them, even worse than they could possibly have done?     Morality is proved by getting beyond committing horrible crimes not by repeating them|`|C1SOqQSkaa	These people you describe don't sound evil to me. They sound insane.    You don't punish one-legged people for being bad at dancing, and you don't punish insane people for not behaving sanely.    You seem far too keen on punishment. Isn't Christianity all about salvation?    Who was it who cautioned against people who had lots to say about how others should suffer for their wrongs?|`|CPvv9vWxaa	First and foremost, atheists do not believe in the existence of a just God... and hence by extension heaven or hell ..     although those criminals you mentioned do, in my opinion, deserve some form of retribution for what they had done, another question arises, which is, "Where is God when all this torturing of innocents was happening?"    so asking this question brings forth another, more difficult question...|`|i46hr7duaa	Eternal torture?  No.  What sort of violent, hateful person would you have to be to wish ETERNAL torture on somebody?  You're worse than the people you guarded.|`|Gc49JgoQaa	No one deserves eternal torture.|`|bc8492ecc5cb8d9056d4595644fa6f30aa	Concepts are nice as long as they explain your point, but to get lost in the concepts and to start making up worlds based on these concepts; that is just annoying.|`|182defe841baeb406682182cc8675475aa	Not really, notice prison never seems to make people any better?    And vengeance, while sometimes satisfying, isn't really a good way to run a system...    And keep in mind when you speak of most xtian's concept of "Hell" you're speaking of literally ETERNAL torture.  Eternal.  That means never ending.  Millions of years, billions of years...  That, for a sentient being, is excessive for any transgression(s).|`|GGUDvicaaa	I understand your point, and yes, torturers are filth, but I cant put anyone to ETERNAL torture. Perhaps kill them to cleanse the world or let them taste a bit of their own medicine - I am thinking a group of teenagers who were NOT insane, just filth and who tortured old woman... but ETERNAL torture? No. Edit No, usually bullies, torturers and murderers are NOT mentally ill, albeit some pretend that they are. They make a choice. IF person is consumed by hallucinations, they are insane and sent to mental hospital to be  medicated, not punished. Humane thing to do.|`|YHmr7nvsaa	I do agree with you, it isn't fair that death is the end for all of us but again, life isn't fair.

I am also sure of who the messiah is, he is my best friend  David in His amazing grace
MED20HbPaa	The Old Testament itself is full of foreshadows to Jesus. Joshua, Moses, and Abraham all have strong parallels to the life of Christ.     I've thought about this myself quite a bit. I don't think I have an answer that will be satisfactory to you. For one, I don't think Jesus really was preaching anything people did not already know. We already knew we should treat others better than ourselves, we knew we should turn the other cheek, and that it is better to forgive others. We know it all and we've known it for awhile now.    Another interesting thing is the character of Jesus when it comes to performing "Miracles". He drags his feet when he is asked to create wine for the party and calls people demanding a miracle from him, "Only an evil, adulterous generation would demand a miraculous sign". Besides this, the Bible records that everyone in the city who had seen these miracles turned their backs on him viciously.    So here's this man, telling people age old truths and performing miracles in a begrudging attitude suddenly sparking the most wildly explosive religion the world has yet seen. I am therefore inclined to believe that something must be different about Jesus.    What do I think? I think it was a combination of an opportunist period in time (release the bible in Greek at a time when the whole world is under Roman control and speaks ancient Greek), and offer something that people couldn't find somewhere else, at least at the time (forgiveness from sin and an opportunity for heaven), and give them some real credibility (prophecy about Jesus found in the Old Testament).     I don't really think there was anything "new" about Jesus, yet here I am, 24 years old, christian for 2 years, living and working in a third world country, and caring a lot about things that--just a few years prior--I wouldn't have paid even the littlest attention to.|`|G9VBTg47aa	Propaganda, a net cast out for gullible fish.

vmv1rP76aa	I was once overweight and I WAS a failure back then. I was short, fat, and ugly, I look back and I see why I didn't have any friends or why people didn't want to be near me.     I need to lose a few pounds now, but I'm nowhere near like I used to be at least.     (Sorry to hate on overweight people, as I have dear friends and family who are and they are good people, but many overweight people are unsuccessful in life, its true!).    Edit: I know there are successful overweight people and I know many who are good people. But I'm saying as a whole, generally if I come across someone who's thin and healthy they tend to do more with their lives and seem happier whereas someone who's obese tends to be a bit more dour and angry with the world (and with him/herself). Not all but many.|`|CxdW9Q2naa	NOPE :)     have a nice day ^_^ !!!|`|TimaMW1laa	no.|`|jiFHJ6daaa	no.....why to...........overweight upto some instant its ok........but after that not|`|P544Sbmqaa	I have always had issues with my weight.  During my cancer treatment I went from being slightly over weight (but happy with how I looked and felt) at 140 to being obese at 200.  Contrary to popular belief, cancer is NOT a weight loss program.  Most of the time today they mix steroids into the chemo and I have actually been on high dose steroids since my bone marrow transplant.      I have mixed feelings.  My brain knows I gained the weight because of the steroids.  I mean, they make you eat everything you can see.  But my emotions tell me its my own fault because I didnt try to exercise or eat healthy.  And then my brain says that I was going through a transplant, I couldnt walk to the mail box much less exercise.  But then my emotions tell me that was over a year ago, I can do most of my daily activities, my steroid dosage is down to really low, its my fault.  My brain tells me that I gained the weight over about a year, I cant loose it all at once.  My emotions get totally upset when I eat healthy for a couple months and cant even loose 5 pounds.      I look at myself and I am disgusted.  My husband wont have sex with me, none of my clothes fit (the clothes that do fit are stretched out sweats and t shirts...  I finally was able to find a couple pairs of second hand jeans at Goodwill, but I dont have the money to buy new clothes, and cant find anything in my size hardly at any of the thrift stores).      I dont really blame myself for gaining, I mean, I was on high dose steroids.  But I totally blame myself for not loosing, and I just dont know how to loose.  I was eating healthy for about 3 months and was exercising literally couldnt even loose 5 pounds.  I HATE the way I look and I am just disgusted with myself.  It wouldnt be as bad if my husband was actually having sex with me, but he isnt.  My brain says he might be having ed issues, but he says he isnt, and he says its not my weight, but if its not either of those, then what is it??  We were fine in that area until I started gaining weight.      I think what hurts more than anything is that no matter what I do, I cant loose it.  I dont know how.  I calorie count rather than doing fad diets, and I try to keep my fat intake at a healthy level, and I try to walk every day, but nothing happens.  Or the scale will go down one week, but it must be a fluke, because the next week I have gained even though I am doing the same thing.|`|0kWsC3Uhaa	For me it's an issue of being healthy - I hate the doctor, so if I take care of my own body, then I won't have to visit the doctor! lol    I think overweight people are very attractive.  I don't consider myself attractive as a thin person, and it's not something that's important to me at all.  Why would I want to look attractive for other people?|`|HivQdKgwaa	I wouldn't necessarily consider myself a failure if I were to gain weight . For me it's a beauty and health issue

cd87c1cf515692ef0adc60a28df772b0aa	Well, according to the religion I was raised in, God created all life, so many Christians might say the chicken, but I don't see why it couldn't have been an egg with a chicken baby inside of it, except for one thing- it needed a mommy to sit on it till it hatched, right?    Anyway, I always thought the chicken came first because the egg and embryo are created within the chicken's body. Just as human bodies creat egg and sperm cells that help create embryos. But it is still the kind of question that can keep you banging your head on the table at times.|`|HWoLbR7Aaa	The chicken fingers were an appetizer, and came before the meal of eggs and sausage.|`|tW86bOMNaa	The egg.

khXGGBiTaa	English I already knew, as I migrated from England to Australia. I migrated very young, so the accent was never going to be a problem.  The accent is not going to be easy to develop if you migrate after your mid-teens. If you were born in England, though, accents are a piece of cake, because there are so many different regional accents there, compared to Australia or USA. The British are a lot better at mimicking American accents than the Americans are at mimicking British accents. The Americans nearly always end up sounding like Dick Van Dyke in Mary Poppins (tragic!).

I will now talk openly about my crazzy bisexual/lesbian situations to my brother and cousins and friends as I do online. :)    Its awesome.

hR7OsqtRaa	When you preach the word of God, you will face opposition, but this should not stop anyone. We should continue to spread the word of God and defeat the plans of Satan.    In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"    The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.    There are a lot more chapters and verses mentioned in the below website along with music, speeches and praise and worship.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    Jesus is God. He is alive forever.    The questions usually asked are:-    1) Did Jesus really exist?  2) Is Jesus God?  3) If Jesus is God, then why did He keep praying to the Father in Heaven? How can the Father and Jesus be one God? Why did Jesus have to suffer on the Cross?  4) What is the Holy Spirit?  5) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?      It would not be possible to give a short answer to these questions .    I suggest you visit the below website.    After visiting the below website, you would get a lot of answers.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus  specifically.)  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became  flesh (John 1:1-14)  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as  "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT  (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)  16. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) and "God" also be called the  Mighty God in Isaiah 10:21  17. Jesus is able to raise Himself from the dead (John 2:19-21)  18. Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things  by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship  is used in each place.)  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts  7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father  that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John  8:58.  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see  Exodus 3:14.  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).  26. Jesus is the One who will judge you on judgement day (John 5:22-23). Only God can be the judge.  27. Jesus forgives sins (Luke 5:20) (Luke 24:47,Acts 10:43) .Only God can forgive sins.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com|`|Kxwyy0Eaaa	Perhaps some are smart enough to weed out the answers they don't consider quality with the answers they do consider quality. Maybe some of the people asking Christian-themed questions want the viewpoint of the atheists, either for the alternate viewpoint just to see it, or because they are questioning their faith or their faith in that particular area (i.e., did the Creation story happen verbatim?).|`|37LKDbtsaa	I'm sorry the atheist minority is hurting the Christian majority, please accept my heartfelt apology.|`|QlQYGlifaa	Honestly, what kind of an answer do you expect for this little rant that's not even a question?|`|a20834f6b1047d276d0ed096fdbea380aa	They enjoy it!  They are "witnessing" and spreading the word.  A good argument gets them to rattle off bible verses ad nauseam and that makes them feel like they are doing something.    Little do they realize...................|`|HWoLbR7Aaa	They know it's going to happen, and they do it anyway. The only sensible answer is that they want it to happen. They like it when they're mocked.|`|Gc49JgoQaa	The expression is "flack", not fleck.|`|182defe841baeb406682182cc8675475aa	Some of them might be searching for the truth.    Others (probably most) are trolling.    Others might want someone elses answer or thoughts on something.    And honestly, on something as anonymous as Y!A, do you really expect people to be respectful and reverent about your sky-fairy?|`|i46hr7duaa	You're not supposed to tell us we're getting to you.

I just don't get Christians, they are so odd and they like their oddness in a way that makes me want to interview them.|`|Q7EN2Zqbaa	Yeah, atheists on here are almost all fucktards, can't say religious folk are much better.|`|1V1PzEYZaa	What is fleck?    "If on the other hand he went to pay his respects to The Door and it wasn't there ... what then?         The answer, of course, was very simple.

I'm sick of everyone saying that atheists are mocking Christians.  Of course we'll mock you if you say we do, because then you are mocking us too.     Just let it be instead. Don't waste so much energy on atheists if you're not sharing our beliefs, and we'll let you be.|`|Qn9V5rajaa	WEECHA WEECHA SQAW WOOHOO!!!    Bet u didn't expect that kind of answer did you?    lol|`|yar1mQCuaa	Without meaning to cause offense, the utter incoherence of your question would remind many an atheist of the mind boggling fug of confusion that many die-hard religious types seem to be suffering from.    Thankfully feelings of confusion often drive Christians to start asking questions. There is nothing at all wrong with having a bit of religion in ones life of course, but blind and unquestioning religious believers are the most dangerous people on the planet. Perhaps decent Christians are willing to take a certain amount of mockery in order to broaden their horizons and lessen their ignorance.

mOWyzwubaa	whats the use of the prophecy when people understand after the prophecy,be it 9/11,world war 2,or JFK !|`|HWoLbR7Aaa	He was a creative genius.  He wrote prophecies so vague, they were practically guaranteed to come true at some point in time, but so poetic they appeared to be specific.|`|AA10744471	Nostradamus was a writer and a visionary. His supposed "prophecies" were just visions and subjected to many, many interpretations. He was only imagining and not prophesying.|`|ZNo1Ah5taa	He Truly was a pig half man.|`|GeoiGjbCaa	"i've heard that (nostradamus) predicted the jfk assassination and 9/11"    Yes. Barnum is continuously being validated, isn't he?    Another perfect example of the complete and total destruction of sentience due to rote based thinking is to read "waygoddoesthings" comment below.    Magical thinking KILLS BRAIN CELLS!|`|rFFYCmOGaa	There are at least six questions in there but to answer the last one the answer is yes sometimes.    Several years ago it was discovered that a guy from the midwest altered Nostradamus' writings to fit several "prophetic events" that were about to take place. I think it was before the year 2000--I forget when.    As with any cryptic writing, loose definitions also allow for multiple interpretations.    If you really tried you could drum up some equally prophetic writings yourself.    In fact let's try it now:    "I heard a great sound followed by a sudden burst of fire which consumed crowds in a public area. Men women and children lay dead and dying all about. Then I heard the screams of female voices in a foreign language I did not recognize"    This will happen next week somewhere in the world.|`|182defe841baeb406682182cc8675475aa	I'm of the opinion people attribute things to prophecy, even if the evidence is contradictory, for the same reason people believe in conspiracy theories.    People have what seems to be an incredible desire to believe there's a "Plan", be it God's plan, Nostradamus's predictions, a government conspiracy, or the contingency of the goddarn wizardsinmyhead...  It's all the same concept, just one delusion is shared by hundreds of thousands, rather than hundreds and/or thousands.|`|xcG5Tasiaa	I find this line from the Principia Discordia to be rather appropriate.....  "In the Erisian Archives is an old memo from Omar to Mal-2: 'I find the Law of Fives to more and more manifest the harder I look."    In other words, if you're looking for it, you'll find it. Sometimes you just have to look HARD enough.     Seriously though, if someone makes broad enough predictions, anyone and their mother can attribute them to any number of things.|`|SWP4m1cLaa	I think he is just a myth.|`|7cLYgf2raa	The books of the bible predicted the re3birth of Israel in the last days. It predicted the advent of satelite tv and nuclear war.It predicted the rise of Europe as a world power under the anti-Christ. It predicted the invasion of Russia with arab allies in the last days,Ezekiel 38,39.And it predicts the return and assention to the throne of Jesus over this world, I guess we will see in the near future if these are true.Because all the prophecies point to these being the last days of mans rule on the earth ending with the 7 year great tribulation.|`|vvlLXjOdaa	Very interesting.  I'll not say one way or the other if I think Nostradamus truly saw the future/made accurate predictions or not.  What I do know if that he wrote some very intriguing and mysterious quatrains that have left many people wondering and hooked to his words, myself one of them.  My perspective if that so often it seems that while we can make assumptions about what his quatrains mean, they are often so vaguely written and meanings disguised that we never seem to truly know what they could be referring to until an event happens.  And even then, it's all up to interpretation.    If we knew for certain that his prophecies were truth, perhaps we could try to prevent them.  The problem I see is that we can never know.  It involves too much interpretation, too much vagueness in words to ever really know if the words are truth or not.  And say we decide that one quatrain refers to say a coming destructive power from so and so person or country...but often the quatrain would never say how it happened or specifically when or maybe to whom.      It's a tricky business, prophecies, and I do believe we never truly realize what they could mean until it's too late to do anything about them.  Plus, perhaps they are warnings, and maybe we have prevented some from happening without knowing it, already.  That is, of course, if they are real.    That's my take, anyway.|`|Zj8JkvX1aa	Apparently, Nostradamus' predictions were really vague and open to interpretation. The origin of the bible is widely disputed. Some scholars claim that Jesus Christ was actually Jesus Chrestes meaning the good or able one for example and also over translated and written over about a 1500 year period. I would say that prophecies are interpreted after the event. Why, I don't know.

I'll say 1 year.    On second thought, I since we can't observe the suffering of those in hell, don't know that it exists, no amount of suffering could be a deterrent to mass murder.  I don't believe in revenge.  So I'd say no one should suffer at all in hell.|`|AA11840819	Forever|`|NjPjpewlaa	hypothetically, 40 years for every person they killed.    I'm being lenient today... lol|`|bVJDV6QPaa	No time at all. even mass murder can be forgiven.  Sad to say, but it is true.  There is only one unforgiveable sin and Christ Jesus died for all sin.  So basically, if someone came and murdered my whole family, they would still be able to part-take in salvation, if God deemed it so.  I mean moses murdered the soldier for whipping a slave.  Saul ordered the death edict to kill all Christians before his transformation call to start the early church.  The truth is that even in the hypothetical, I just do not have a concrete idea of time to give you.  I think hell is to be without God, to turn your back on God thus, that can be as long as it takes God to chase your heart or it could be an eternity.|`|G2IoZpeqaa	if you don't believe in Hell why ask the question? Its like asking who do you think is the best all time boxer if your not interested in boxing|`|Lc8hkjHPaa	Hell is only a deterrent designed by the same people who designed Christianity, Jesus and the Bible.|`|lL1IkNN7aa	i have been to hell it was hot there i say about about 50 years|`|MED20HbPaa	"How long" is a question for humans, not for things that exist outside of our dimensional existence. If, in the other 5 or 6 dimensions that exist outside of time there even is such a place as our understanding of Hell.    I think a murderer causes a lot of long-lasting damage. They hurt immediate family members, friends, potential friends of friends. In the grand scheme of things they leave a pretty long trail of collateral damage. I think, in hell, they will be brought to realize this. They can "stay" for as long as it takes.

You're just gonna have to wait your turn!|`|SwtaUd56aa	I am going to assume throughout my response that by god you are referring to the Judeo-Christian God, believed to be the Father of Jesus Christ.    If you actually heard a voice in your head say something like, "I am God and I exist", would you honestly believe it? I am a Christian but my first thought if I were to have an experience like that is that I am going crazy and need to see a psychologist.     The senses can be immensely deceiving and so can emotions and the brain. Therefore, God simply cannot be empirically proven in the way you would like. Either accept Gods existence in faith if you believe the probability of his existence is strong enough to warrant that faith, simply reject him, or remain undecided until you feel comfortable with coming to a conclusion. You could believe what feels to be intuitively right (and you seem to feel belief in God is right or else I doubt you would be asking this question), but then not much would separate you from those who subscribe to any other religion for no reason at all.    Keep in mind, however, that no evidence will ever be enough for the atheist or agnostic with a confirmation bias.|`|UmdKqP5kaa	Ok, we know we don't create each other and we don't come to this world from nowhere because when we die we must be going somewhere as well, hence there must be God, if there were many Gods, they would have fought over what to be created and what not to be, probably over who to die and who to live at the same time... so it's gotta be one God... if that God created us then there must be a reason... could we figure it out on our own? God made it easy and sent us messengers and prophets to show us the way and tell us why... so all the messengers and all the religions are from the same only God, so they've got to be complementary to each other, not opposing each other!!! then God must have said His final words in the last message, what is the last message? and how do we know it's the last one? I guess that would be the religion that believes in all messengers and all books equally... is there such religion? actually yes, Islam does :)  A True Muslim (man or woman) gets his reward for obeying Allah's orders (Allah means The God in Arabic) by going to heaven, where he/she are indulged forever in all the good thing s that were on earth and more, things no one ever dreamt of or heard about. The Holy Quran tells Muslims (men and women) there will be good food, good wine and sex in heaven for all, but not in the bestial way you may think of, but rather in a way that is satisfactory for everyone and better than what was on earth. Heaven is no heartbreak or injustice land.  True Muslims are no terrorists, and Islam never calls for that, Islam means peace, it bans violence unless you were fought so you fight back, it only doesn't require Muslims to be cowards, and true Muslims understands this very well and never attack civilians.   Islam is the only religion that accepts freedom of religion and asks men to treat women gently like queens.  Muslims don't deny Jesus, they believe in him, love him and respect him so much.  We believe Jesus is NOT dead till today; he wasnt murdered or crucified as most people think. God made the man who betrayed Jesus be killed instead by switching their looks for a moment. Jesus was left up to live in heaven until the end of days when he will come back to earth, make justice prevail instead of oppression, fight the imposter and perform his last prayer before he really dies like other Prophets. So we're waiting for you Jesus, Messenger of God, to bring the world peace and pray with us.

The argument goes something like this: "I refuse to prove that I exist," says God, "for proof denies faith, and without faith I am nothing."       "But," says Man, "the Babel fish is a dead giveaway isn't it? It could not have evolved by chance. It proves you exist, and so therefore, by your own arguments, you don't.

No waste of time preparing yourself in another language or teaching another language.    I think it would be great.

Zamenhof created the esperanto language with the hope that it would become the universal second language for all people on earth to speak. That never really worked out and I don't think it will ever be possible. It would be comfortable but other languages would still be necessary and would remain prominent in some areas with or without the universal language being known. So essentially, you can make people learn an universal language but that doesn't make them use it. Literature would still be created in mostly original languages, business would also be done in original languages and in the end a whole lot of it would still need to be translated. I don't think an universal language is necessary. Things would still be done the same way as they have always been done.|`|Inc78M0Raa	Yes, and no.  Yes, because it would make traveling easier.

I'm Welsh, and having my own language makes me special! It gives me a better idea of history! I'm also fluent in English and French. Each language has a different purpose!    Welsh- To speak with my family and friends.    English- To speak with Foreigners    French- To speak with foreigners who don't speak English.    Over Christmas I worked in a restaurant where everybody spoke Spanish to each other. Was I unhappy that they were speaking in a language that I didn't understand? No! I loved hearing the language!    My cousin is 6 years old and is fluent in Welsh, English and Hungarian, due to his parents. I don't understand a word of his Hungarian. But I really love hearing him speak it with his mother! It's interesting.    If the world only had one language the world would be a seriously boring place.|`|3b8f805c7988647b5a9ca864a23d2a7aaa	You're on the right track. A universal language that supliments the other languages.    The idea of having a universal language, especially if it is arbitrarily chosen or worse, forced would be next to useless. English would be just one of many bad choices. English uses so many rules with exceptions that anything past the basics would be a barrier to those that need to use the language if it was chosen as a universal language. As English speakers who learned it at our mothers knee, we find the language easy to use (for the most part; you don't have to look very far to find examples of bad English by native speakers). For a language to be truely universal it must be as natural as possible for any and all speakers or else those that don't master it to a high degree already suffer a disadvantage to those that do master it. As a second language it is VERY difficult to master.  There isn't a national language out there that would permit most people to learn it like a native. The deadlock over which language would get ugly indeed.  Herein lies the problem with this question, because people limit their answers to the idea of a single language with which to become universal.  However, an AUXILIARY language, intended to bridge the gap between cultures by providing an easily learnt method of communication would be the answer. It would open the EU and indeed, the world up to far more in the way of understanding.  Esperanto is making headway in becoming an AUXILIARY language, yet people reject it out of hand because they all fear the loss of their tongue and a single language spoken by all, which of course is exactly what Esperanto is trying NOT to do.  As a common SECOND language you and you and you have no need to sink years into study of a language that you will most likely NEVER fully assimilate like a native. The choice would be yours. With Esperanto you can be comfortable talking to your neighbour in your native tongue and just as comfortable talking to Ming Lu across the waves on an equal footing in this easily learnt language. It's like a neutral handshake, because each participant invested an equal amount of effort to learn this easy language. (16 gramatical rules... NO exceptions!)  Believe it or not, Esperanto represents the best chance for the survival of the multitude of dying languages since it's purpose is to forestall the monopoly of any one National tongue to the disadvantage of another.  So will it some day become universal (which by the way doesn't mean that EVERYBODY in the world speaks it, just those that want it / need it)?  Well, the $600 million+ USD spent yearly on translation services at the UN (six official languages) and a similar amount in the EU says, sooner or later something is going to change, and this is the cheapest and most effective, proven alternative.    Further, if you don't think Esperanto is making headway, check this.  In a recent reprint of the Unua Libro (first book), editor Gene Keyes said that when he first started the project in 2000, he did a search for Esperanto on Google and it yielded over 1 million hits. At the completion of his task in February of 2007, the same search yielded over 34 million hits. Out of curiosity, after I had read that I did the same search and it yielded over 39.2 million hits. That's up over 5 million in two months. So it's growing. Slowly (or maybe not so slowly!)  Obviously not everyone will find a use for it, and that's fine. However for those that take the time and bother to search out the other users, it's worth it. Of course searching out other uses gets easier with each passing day.  Personally I have friends all over the world. Friends I wouldn't have had with out Esperanto.    Some have the opinion that the language is Impractical and awkward.  The two million plus (as of 1995) people that use it says it's not Impractical. Two million was considered the functionally fluent level (IE: able to get by in the necessary elements when travelling) in 1995. Since 1995 the Internet has grown by leaps and bounds, and Esperanto right along with it.  As for awkward, well I don't agree, but then anything that you start might be considered awkward until you get the practice in that you need.  Wikipedia hosts more than 250 different languages. Esperanto ranks 22nd in the most numerous articles category.  More than these languages to name a few.      23 Slovak  24 Danish  25 Indonesian    http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/List_of_W...    NOBODY has to give up their mother tongue, nor should they.  Esperanto as an auxiliary language however would be wonderful.    I encourage everybody to research and draw their own conclusions.    ?is!|`|esdjKGeBaa	No, no, no, no, no! I'm a translator! That would mean losing my job!

There may be subtleties of meaning you do not understand, or the translation may not capture the meaning you are looking for. Also, there are many ways to translate even a simple phrase or sentence.
