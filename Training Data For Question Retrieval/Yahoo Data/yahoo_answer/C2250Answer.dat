LxN8sjhkaa	This one?<br>  <br>  Welcome! Foolish Mortals, to the Haunted Mansion, I am your host, your ghost host. Hmmmm. Our tour begins here, in this gallery. Here where you see paintings of some of our guests, as they appeared in their corruptible, mortal state. Kindly step all the way in please, and make room for everyone. There's no turning back now...<br>  <br>   Your cadaverous palour, betrays an aura of foreboding, almost as though you sense a disquieting metamorphosis. Is this Haunted room actually stretching? Or is it your imagination, hmm? And consider this dismaying observation, this chamber has no windows, and no doors. Which offers you this chilling challenge, to find a way out! Of course, there's always my way...

Most importantly, it is crucial that your friend remains calm, takes his/her time and doesn't make rash decisions like quitting his/her job or moving to another state. He/She will have a lot of decisions to make and he/she want to be sure they are the best decisions. <br>  <br>  Before he/she does anything else, sign the back of his/her ticket and put it in a safe place. His/her ticket is his/her only claim for the prize. I recommend a locked box or a safety deposit box.<br>  <br>  Tell the fewest people possible. Good news spreads fast, and he/she may have news media coming to their door or people calling before they have a chance to place the claim or put their ticket in a safe place.<br>  <br>  They should get professional tax and/or legal advice to help decide the best way to claim the prize. Change the telephone number, or get an answering machine and caller ID so calls can be screened. After people hear that your friend has won, he/she may receive calls from friends who want to congratulate or sales people who have heard about their good fortune.<br>  <br>  Courtesy: <a href="http://www.a1cashcasinos.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.a1cashcasinos.com</a>

Generally since it's only been a 24 hr period, they should exchange the game you have for another that you want. Does the game you want, cost the same amount of money, as the game you bought. If it doesn't they might not take the game back.hope this helps :).|`|gk9nl2Xmaa	Yep!

i75pLoPmaa	One time, I got a "corrupt card" thing, so I restarted and tried again. But that probably won't help here.<br>  <br>  Concerning the memory, can't you just take the save files from the memory card and put them into the Wii's memory? I'm not sure, (because I haven't done it), but I own a Wii, and there's a menu called "Memory Management" (or something like that) Format the card, and then transfer the save files back. I don't usually get many corrupted memory files.

f2da73f26820e41a00db0edf3483a591aa	Actually, that is my 92 sprite code, no 94 exists. Here's my official code list: <a href="http://wiki.dscoders.com/index.php/Harvest_Moon_DS_Cute#92_sprites_saved.2Fmax_FP_.26_Skill" rel="nofollow">http://wiki.dscoders.com/index.php/Harve...</a><br>  After looking at the first answer more, I now realize why they thought it was 94. Many people think this codes will make you have 92, it actually fills in a specific 92 slots, and does not erase any other sprites. If you have a sprite that this code doesn't add, your number will be larger than 92. When I designed this code, I went straight to 100, I only had baby left to get.|`|PWaWuD3Jaa	There is a cheat to get 94 sprites.

Look at your memo tab and look at the harvest sprite number it should read "94"(if its more oh well). Go and save a sprite you know how to get like the casino guys. Once you save your first one gutz will say the counter is full of harvest sprites. then a channel will be discovered. next, save another sprite and the harvest goddess will thank you and tell you to go offer at her pond..<br>  So you've got a channel and you've saved the harvest goddess, Her offerings, try and give her straw berrys, just walk up to the pond and chuck em in.<br>  <br>  This will give you 94 sprites, sadly, there is no code for all 101 sprites.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!

Don't get me wrong, the book was entertaining, but the movie was almost unwatchable.  There was no chemistry between the actors and the effects were overdone to compensate for the lack of chemistry.  The Potter movies completely butcher the books, but at least they're fun to watch.  Twilight was just bad.  It's also mediocre as a romance, and cheap as a vampire story.  If you want romantic vampires, you're better off reading Ann Rice's earlier stuff.<br>  <br>  Don't have as favorite character.  I enjoyed the Twilight book for what it was, but never really connected with any of the characters.<br>  <br>  I would probably not bother to read or watch it again.  There are better book series out there, and much better movies.|`|N2Xto1pFaa	Hun why did you post this is Video Games?<br>  <br>  Anyway, I like Harry Potter better. I work at a book store so I've come to hate Twilight and the hype around it. I read half of the first book and then just said "No". I don't like romance stories, and added vampires to it doesn't make it any better. I'm an adult, and I know it's a teen novel, but there's so many better-written teen novels out there, so I don't really understand the Twilight craze...<br>  My favorite Harry Potter character is Remus. <br>  I've only ever re-read one of the HP books and that's 3, because it's my favorite.

There are many different kinds of stitches.  A single crochet is a stitch.  So is a double crochet, or a half double crochet, or a K2tog.... they are all stitches.  But a stitch can be anything at all, not only in crochet, or knitting, or macrame, or sewing, or... well, any kind of string art.|`|6K1D6Azmaa	If it starts out that way, I would guess they mean chain stitch. ?|`|QyNAJxGyaa	Single, double, treble, and half are all considered one stitch, it's really the style or patten that's the difference.|`|3Ophdo9raa	Stitches are usually a term used in sewing or knitting.

5e3a08fb0f8df1781963c23284f90448aa	You'll eventually make it into the Castle and find Everyone.  Until then, just survive because it'll be a little while.  Yeah, you'll get the keyblade and your friends when you fight Riku.  Right now just worry about making it into the Castle because it takes a LONG time to beat Hollow Bastion.  Unless your a nerd.  You'll eventually have to go all the way to the top of the castle.  And it takes a while.  Just pace yourself.  I HATE this level.  The only good thing is finding out what happens.  It's important stuff for the 2nd KH.  VERY important.  Have fun and good luck.|`|5604945f9dd44c619ba28dfd8a1fba28aa	You will be standing on a platform, jump off it and run behind the rocks to<br>   find a chest containing Dalmatians 91, 92, and 93. Then return to the starting<br>   platform and make your way up until you reach a moving platform, which will<br>   take you to a larger platform. Seacrh this area for a bubble which you should<br>   use to get a Dispel-G. Then continue to make your way up the platforms. Once<br>   you reach the top, you will meet Riku, and watch the cut-scene that will<br>   dramatically change the story. After the cut-scene ends, Beast will join your<br>   party, and you will be automatically equipped with the wooden sword. Donald<br>   and Goofy have left you and so you must rely on Beast to defeat the Heartless<br>   that appear. You can now turn back and glide to three chests containing a<br>   Megalixir, a Blizzaga Ring, and a Dispel-G. When you are ready, head for the<br>   castle behind the platform with the White Trinity Mark on the floor. There are<br>   three new types of Heartless that make their first appearance here. They are<br>   the Wizard, the Wyvern, and the Defender. Not much of a threat, but since you<br>   only have a wooden sword, it will be difficult to defeat them. Your best<br>   option is to flee. When you reach the castle gates, head to your right and<br>   activate the crystal. Jump onto the elevator that appears. There are two<br>   chests containing a Mythril and a Tornado-G. Then apporoach the bubble that<br>   is closer to the ground to reach the waterway. Use the nearby Save Point and<br>   get Beast to break the wall down, by using the Call command. Enter the new<br>   room to find another bubble that you should use to reach another room. Head<br>   into the room to find a switch on the wall, release it. This should open a<br>   gate. Head for the gate that just opened and release the switch near the gate.<br>   Another gate should of opened, and again, you should head for the newly opened<br>   area, to find another switch that you must press. Then head for the newly<br>   opened area and press the switch on the ground. Then use the bubble to reach<br>   another area. Press the switch in the area and then finally press the last<br>   switch. Doing this has opened the main door at the entrance gate. It's time to<br>   backtrack to the entrance gate. To get out, use the "switch" steps in reverse.<br>   When you have reached the gate, turn right and head for the door. Prepare<br>   yourself, as a boss awaits...
AA12024062	Ok, seriously, there is only one type of memory stick that will work on the psp.

Now if you practiced to become a Jedi of Speed Stack i think you could gain participation by challenging kids. That's one thing i noticed working in an after school program is that kids always want to challenge and beat staff in whatever they can.

AA10970922	Resistance: Fall of Man is the game to get.  It's not exactly the "Halo killer" that Sony so badly wants, but definitely a great first-person shooter game.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/ps3/action/insomniacshooter/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.gamespot.com/ps3/action/insom...</a>|`|40a198d77c9ee7b0e62a63be20b8743faa	Sony is the least dependable company when it comes to hardware. Microsoft rules! The PS3 will be Sony's 4th entertainment system and 3rd console and finally it will be alright, or it is supposed to be. Microsoft's second console is basically the same Sony's 4th entertainment system... pretty pathetic... Eventually the PS3 developers will learn how to use the PS3's hardware to max potential but by the time most of the games are better than the Xbox 360, it will be time for a new console to be released.|`|147f15153b38b549f787747a276a5611aa	none i hate playstation consoles even though i have a psp ....get a 360 they are awesome and can download movies in a week on xbox live  and they have better games|`|34c96172507022cfbca22695110a905daa	none. Its too expensive. I like the wii.

Many, many more awesome exclusives belong to the 360 than the PS3. It is also cheaper and has a better, proven online service. The sixaxis controller is just a major gimick to get a few extra sales. The only reasonable exclusive games Sony has is Socom and MGS. Final fantasy is also on 360, but comes out at later times.|`|b42473e1b17518317807df12b24c0611aa	i don't think the PS3 would need a system update and as for the wifi i doubt  it|`|6b18445e3e01f6073fd668909e384e18aa	it is $600.00 thats all you need to know
hy4EzB2Caa	In diamond the old chateau is in the eternal forest at the very north end. You will need somebody with cut  for the trees in front of it. Inside on the second floor between the hours of 22:00 and 4:00 in the TV in the second room on the left you will see a rotom. A legendary elect/ghost Pokemon that is lvl 15. <br>  <br>  Also you migrate Pokemon after you get the national Dex by going down to sandmeg town...(watever its called :}) Then you surf down in the water and there will be 2 paths. Go through the right one and follow it until you reach land and keep going right. Than you go in the house thing and you will be at the migrating place!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!

Newer games for newer systems usually are made too quickly and have problems. It is a platformer game with great replay value. If you just got the playstation 1 or as its called the psp, you might try, Spyro: Year of the Dragon, Medievil,  Ape Escape, GEX3 Deep Cover Gecko they are all great games and all of them are tame enough for the whole family.

FQXfM7gQaa	"You might have known the Mystery Gift option in previous Pokemon games as <br>  Mystery Event. Mystery Gift has been somewhat of a widely known secret for a <br>  while now. Basically, when the Mystery Gift option is acquired in a Pokemon <br>  game, you are enabled to acquire free gifts from a certain source, such as a <br>  console Pokemon game.<br>  <br>  In all games, the method acquiring the option of "Mystery Gift" has stayed the <br>  same. There is always a certain person somewhere in the game who, after you do <br>  something else in the game (like beat a Gym), will ask you to give him some <br>  input about whatever. The same method works for this game.<br>  <br>  In order to get the Mystery Gift option, you must first go to Jubilife City and <br>  walk into the TV Station. Walk up two flights of stairs to the third floor. On <br>  the lower half of the room is a man speaking to a woman. <br>  <br>  When you talk to him, he'll ask for some input about a couple things. For the <br>  first pair of words, using ABC mode to quicken things up, put "EVERYONE HAPPY". <br>  Answer "WI-FI CONNECTION" for his second question.<br>  <br>  After you've done this, save your game. When you start up your game, Mystery <br>  Gift will be a permanent addition. If you have a GBA Pokemon game inserted and <br>  you can Migrate Pokemon, the main menu will scroll to show the Migrate option <br>  in between Mystery Gift and Nintendo WFC Settings.<br>  <br>  Like the previous Pokemon games, Mystery Gift is only useful if Nintendo takes <br>  initiative and creates a use for it, such as receiving goodies for your Pokemon <br>  Gold/Silver/Crystal from Pokemon Stadium 2, or having the ability to scan E-<br>  Reader cards and receive goodies from Pokemon Colosseum for your Pokemon Ruby/<br>  Sapphire/Emerald games."|`|lpCXAhWiaa	i believe the only use is for speciel nintendo events, but im not sure|`|5e3a08fb0f8df1781963c23284f90448aa	Well...<br>  <br>  People are supposed to wait for the like 3 events for the 3 last guys, but if you have hook ups like me, then you already have it without cheating.<br>  <br>  Another way is to buy stuff on Pokemon Battle Revolution, you buy stuff with points there, then send em to your DS.<br>  <br>  What I did in PBR was defeat all Colosseums and then you get a Pikachu that knows surf, then I went into a PokeMart and talked to a guy in green and e gave it to me

It has all info you need.|`|jq9zv80Raa	Blizzard is pretty well known for blowing their release dates, so even when one does become known, you can count on it being out a few months thereafter.

Not many of the bugs are getting resolved either, as the property keeps getting handed off from one publisher to another.  It's not making much money either, so it will most likely be shut down anytime unless it gets in the hands of a publisher that actually gives a damn about this property.  Dissapointing, I know, I was looking forward to this one myself.

b9689f3234fdf126700a30bee5d24067aa	YES, but there is a catch: (from team xbox.com):<br>  <br>  30. Will the Xbox 360 work on any TV that Xbox is able to work on?<br>  <br>  Yes, the Xbox 360 will work on any TV that also works with the current Xbox. Even if the Xbox 360 has been designed to play games in HDTV 720p (1280x720) mode with 5.1 surround sound, the Xbox 360 will also work with regular TV that has NTSC or PAL and stereo audio capabilities. <br>  <br>  34. I live in the U.K and I’m planning to order my Xbox 360 from the U.S, as it is much cheaper than here in the U.K. I wanted to know if it would be compatible here in the U.K.<br>  <br>  Just like current generation consoles, a console designed for North America (NTSC) won’t work on Europe (PAL) for the simple reason that games are region locked. So if you get an US Xbox 360, you’ll have to purchase NTSC games because those titles sold in Europe won’t work on your North American Xbox 360.<br>  <br>  So, just let him know that he won't be able to just buy a game around him and have it work, all of them will have to be imports.<br>  <br>  For TV standards:<br>  <a href="http://www.kropla.com/tv.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.kropla.com/tv.htm</a><br>  Power Converter:<br>  <a href="http://www.powermax.com/product/Targus_World_Power_Travel_Adapter/h76635.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.powermax.com/product/Targus_W...</a>|`|bgohEtTbaa	I also think most European countries use a different power outlet as well.  I'm sure there is some kind of converter he could find though, obviously when people travel with laptops or whatever they'd need to be able to use them.<br>  <br>  I'd just ask him to double check he has the correct inputs on his tv to hook up to the 360.  If he says he does, then get it for him.|`|0BiYLMAXaa	idk what to tell you<br>  <br>  i know alot about the 360 but idk what the tv's are like in europe|`|FhK2SSt7aa	if you're thinking of buying an Xbox 360 you should out this site first. they give you an xbox 360 for FREE! all you need to do is complete a few quick tasks for them.
AA11991193	It is a beneficial thing for you pokemon. If you have pokerus, check under your pokemon name and you will see PKRS in a violet background. It doubles the EV gained when you train them. To get pokerus you have to battle a lot of wild pokemon, it is rarer than getting a shiny. It usually stays for 1 day if the infected pokemon is in your party. It will have it forever if you put it in your box. To spread it to other pokemon, you only have to walk and battle with the infected pokemon and the rest will get it in less than 10 battles. Once you cure a pokemon of pkrs, it can't never get it again or infect others, but the effects will be permanent.|`|IPkV4Cugaa	i think its good and it spreads|`|efYZEulvaa	its good...it makes your pokemon grow faster...

JVRWy3Huaa	yes there is an Action Replay code for Pokemon Diamond and Pearl called Wild Pokemon Modifier, You Press L and R and go to the items part of your bag and there are 493 masterballs. Discard the number of Masterballs to match the the pokedex entry in the national dex. (Example if you want palkia throw away 10 masterballs because  493 - 10 = 483 and that is Palkia's number in the national dex. also when yo search through the grass hold L. If you want the code go to  www.youtube.com and search Action Replay Codes for pokemon Diamond. Look for the video that says Wild Pokemon Modifier it has a pitcure of a boy finding a darkrai. Click on it and it will have a descripption next to it. click more and it wil tell you the cde.|`|C7J9NGTlaa	no there r still no codes to have all pokemons in 1 area<br>  so if there i will give it to u|`|ukvYHcDiaa	there is but if u cant find it urself u are a lazy dumbass who doesnt even deserve them.|`|efYZEulvaa	lazy

They both work the same. <br>  <br>  If you already have both(which is pointless, fyi), just pick whichever you can find the most codes for. It seriously doesn't matter either way.

It does not evolve, but unlike the other only one or genderless Pokemon it can breed with Ditto. Guess what where Rotom appears? @_@ In a TV! It's the only TV I guess in the Old Chateu.<br>  <br>  === Rare: Needs something to do ===<br>  Such as trading or holding an item.<br>  <br>  - Event Pokemon: They are Pokemon that are sent from Nintendo when attending an event ^_^ and they can only be obtainable this way!<br>   They are: Darkrai, Shaymin, Arceus<br>  <br>  - GBA Starter Pokemon: Bulbasaur, Chikoria, Charmendar etc. The only way to get these is to transfer them from Pokemon Leaf Green, FireRed, Ruby, Sapphire or Emerald.

They do not appear in the wild, but taking the fossil to the museum in Oceburgh City will resurrect the Pokemon back to you!<br>  Omanyte, Kabuto, Aerodactyl, Anorith, Cranidos, Shieldon.<br>  <br>  - Spiritomb: From PokeDream's guide:<br>   While digging in the Sinnoh Underground you may find a Odd Keystone. You also can find one from the Blackbelt at the end Route 208. After you have one, take it and place it in the Spirit Well on Route 209.  Then you must talk to 32 friends while you have 2 or more Nintendo DS systems connected in the Sinnoh Underground. After doing this, you can find Spiritomb at the<br>  Spirit Well. This sidequest can be attempted as many times as you wish. However, you need to talk to 32 friends every time. Also, you can use the same friend over and over, but you must exit and re-enter the Underground every time for it to count.<br>  <a href="http://pokedream.com/games/diamondpearl/sidequest.php" rel="nofollow">http://pokedream.com/games/diamondpearl/...</a><br>  <br>  === Rare: Evolution ===<br>  <br>  - Holding and Item while Trading: <br>  Magmortar (Magmar Traded and holding Magmorizer), Electvire (Electabuzz traded and holding Electrizer), Porygon z (Porgyhon 2 Traded and holding Dubious Disc), Dusnoir (Dusclops traded holding Reaper Cloth), Rhyperior (Rhydon traded and holding the item "Protector"). They can also be counted as "obtained only once", because whenever the held Item has been used, It could not be used again!

Mamoswine.  Mr.Mime & Sudowoo also evovle upon learning a certain attack but they can also be found in the wild.<br>  <br>  - Eevee's Evolutions: Eevee can be rarely found in Trophy Garden, but It can be easily obtained after the Nationaldex from bebe in Hearthome city! Getting several Eevees is easier by breeding a female Eevee with a Ditto! (If you got a male Eevee, you can look for female ones in GTS)<br>   In the early pokemon games eeve evolves by stones, and now the new evolutions "Leafeon", "Glaceon" evolve by area ^_^<br>   <a href="http://www.serebii.net/diamondpearl/evolution.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.serebii.net/diamondpearl/evol...</a><br>  <br>  = Cheating in Pokemon Diamond Pearl = <br>  - Using Action Replay you can get absolutely any pokemon and item you need, you can find all the codes in PokemonPalace:<br>  <a href="http://www.pokemonpalace.net/index.php?id=nds/dp_actionreplay" rel="nofollow">http://www.pokemonpalace.net/index.php?i...</a><br>  <br>   You can buy the Action Replay online from Play-Asia <br>  <a href="http://www.play-asia.com/SOap-23-83-3sol-71-b8-77-2-49-en-15-action+replay-84-j-70-1ilb.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.play-asia.com/SOap-23-83-3sol...</a><br>  <br>  - Pokesav: It is a program used to hack the gamesave of your Pokemon game.

It looks really good.|`|d38SeAU5aa	if you are familiar with the call of duty series wait for COD4. but if not pratice with COD 3. as you know COD 3 is WW2 and COD 4 is modern. so basically what ever your style is. i would wait unless you cant|`|uQiFGsm5aa	I have Call of Duty 3 for XBOX360 the online gaming is awesome. i have seen the trailer for the fourth installment, it looks incredible. i can tell you now, once i get Call of Duty4 i will not play Call of Duty3. you should wait.

Sometimes, during a good run of notes the character does a signature move.  <br>  <br>  Another cool thing is that if you have two controllers, you can play vs mode (like in the first one) but you can also play cooperative mode so that you play lead and your friend plays rhythm or bass (or vice versa)<br>  <br>  I really like it.  I'm looking forward to the third one that's coming out.  It's called Rock the 80s or something like that.<br>  <br>  Good luck and have fun!|`|RHADBLwRaa	All that you mentioned is a yes you can earn money for performing, you get to spend it, and your character moves occasionaly|`|AYAW6RT7aa	The game is freaking awesome.

Basically call ALL the local stores every day and try to find one that will be receiving some ON A SPECIFIC DAY.  Then, just get there early.  I mean several hours before the store opens.  If you can get the store to tell you how many they expect, you can tell right away if you are there in time.  My store was getting 12 and I was number 4 on the line (at around 6am for a store that opened at 9).  Even though I had nothing in common with the other people that were waiting... the fact that we were all there for the same reason gave us something to talk about.  All in all the experience really wasn't a bad one.  Keep the extra money and use if for stocking stuffers (it's only 250+tax in the stores).|`|AA10436125	its really hard to get a wii at that price right now, they are too expensive on ebay (most are at 500). i say wait until after the holiday rush. keep checking local stores like target for shipments. good luck!|`|c582420652c7cb8c961ab4131c6b2fbeaa	the best bet is look into walmart fo its next shipping date and or try ebay and get lucky  i did with xbox 360  brand new never opened with 1 game and the head set for online  for $200  cause the highest bidder couldnt pay and i won on default

They're a BLAST.|`|7f20b39048baa0ad72c9b7bb73eb11bbaa	I'm 33 and I would love to wear them if I found a pair. They're not as fast as regular skates because you only have a single wheel on each heel.

Yea, i know.|`|e084a5e91600a7cdc1c4dffee1ce4eedaa	I don't know of any in which you build your own fighting unit, but here is a list of the top rated multiplayers.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://internetgames.about.com/cs/actiongames/tp/tprts.htm" rel="nofollow">http://internetgames.about.com/cs/action...</a>
V3m0UyVDaa	as of now NO ='(|`|5e3a08fb0f8df1781963c23284f90448aa	Not yet, but that's what would make me get one.  I have and beat Jet Grind Radio, and have played Jet Set Radio Future, and I want it soooo bad.  JGR and JSRF are the best games EVER (well...second to all Sonic the Hedgehog games!)
bfe8bb12df79642a6a56ceb55870f1f2aa	Depends on which one.  I don't know about the first one, but in 2 you turn into Super Sonic.|`|5e3a08fb0f8df1781963c23284f90448aa	Nothing because it's SEVEN
381e3207230460fe8521d523304a91a6aa	Try the Fatal Frame series.  It's supposed to be really scary.<br>  <br>  The Silent Hill series is also scary.  But I think it's scary because you feel so helpless against the enemy.|`|AA10787012	i would have to say resident evil2!!!|`|67c54a2d904b87a25cf61e32fe875cddaa	"The Suffering" on PS2 is a great game that you don't want to play alone in the dark. Its about you being imprisoned for killing your family and you are in a haunted prison being chased by dead inmates. There is a second game called "The Suffering, The Ties that Bind"<br>  Good Luck.|`|AA10012580	Both the silent hill series as well as the game called Clock Tower were both great!!! My husband loved them, and I found them not only suspensful but also very entertaining and mind challenging (puzzles and codes to figure out in both). Good luck I hope this helps you!!!|`|cbf0aa916d665e2cae1e151f3ea73775aa	well if you have a xbox or pc or 360 then F.E.A.R. it is simply H~O~R~R~I~F~Y~I~N~G!!! I still have nightmares from it. lol|`|e084a5e91600a7cdc1c4dffee1ce4eedaa	The Silent Hill series is pretty good, along the Resident Evil series.  You should check out the Alone In the Dark games as well.|`|OKZ7cIlNaa	try manhunt very gory and alot of scary parts and its only like 9.99$ because its old its a must have for people who like scary games.

8vUAjRh4aa	You have to make sure you fight just about every trainer. If you did, then once you beat the Elite Four and caught the Legendary Trio (Azlef, Uxie, Mesprit [one of them immediately runs away, but don't worry. Prof. Rowan will tell you how to find him]) you should have seen (not caught)149 pokemon. Then go to Celestic Town and look for Cynthia's grandma. She will show you a picture of Dialga/Palkia (depends on what version you have), which will complete the Pokedex. Go see Prof. Rowan and Prof. Oak will come and give you the National Pokedex. You can now "migrate" Pokemon from past games.|`|92cc0ccbb5c5999bee0323c086265762aa	Insert your GBA and Diamond/Pearl into the DS. After you've beaten the E4 and have the national pokedex, go to Pal Park on route 221 and select pokemon for transfer. After that, you enter the park and 'catch' your pokemon.  {Park balls are basically MasterBalls, so you don't battle, and finding them in the park is just as easy.}

Also, if you start the game with a button pushed it will often act as though you're still pressing it even if you're not.<br>  <br>  If you have any compatible screwdrivers you might open it and check the connections and buttons. If not, get it repaired at  video game store or replace it.<br>  <br>  AtG|`|P7eb1T2Baa	I have a Game cube but nothing like that never happended to me. Maybe you just need a new controller

41eae61a7b2727d67843e556240132e1aa	with bomb the base act 2 make sure you are on the roof of the building nearby where there are stairs to get to and start by shooting the guys at the trucks first. then work your way from left to right shooting all of the Columbians  make sure that it is one shot one kill because thats pretty much all the time you will get. after a few tries you should be able to get it. they will be carrying AK-47s so you don't want to charge up there because you will probably get killed...same with running a car up there they will shoot and blow up your car before you even kill any.<br>  <br>  with big and veiny i think its the one where you have to drive the truck around and pick up the magazines...anyways with this one you want to do your best to memorize the route because if you don't you are going to have a very hard time completing this mission.|`|b442f47acfb237841f00f3f333625749aa	Geritol...lol<br>  Here's "bomb da base" ...<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cE0PFLCA3sA" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cE0PFLCA3...</a><br>  Here's "big and veiny"...http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...<br>  Good Luck Ollie.|`|df052c46a815a1856c23f3ca1ef792afaa	lol 70 year old gamer.... thats funny<br>  anyways try the weapons cheat or the destroy all cars cheat... they are all available on gamefaqs.com|`|JXqoWGhraa	check gamefaqs.com they have full walkthroughs that are free.|`|bgohEtTbaa	Some advice I'd give for almost ANY mission would to be to take out as many people as you can with your car.  There are so many mission where the objective is to knock off someone, and people always try doing it in person.  <br>  <br>  When the mission allows, just find a vehicle and plow through as many of them as you can.  And always try to get full armor before going on a mission.  The Uzi is probably your weapon of choice, if it is available.  Pack plenty of ammo for it.|`|qB5oPBO0aa	Well I do remember Bomb Da Base Act 2<br>  <br>  It is the one where u take 8 ball n then have to burst the ship rite?<br>  <br>  Okie...here's what u can do...<br>  The steps arent too difficult...<br>  U leave 8 ball a long way away from the ship<br>  Now just in front of the ship, there's a building with stairs<br>  Climb the stairs n stand there with ur sniper rifle<br>  Shoot those two punks standing near the jeep first<br>  Then aim towards the deck, zoom up, start killing from the left to the right<br>  There are not more than 10-12 people...<br>  Just aim properly...dont  zoom in too much..n u'll do good<br>  They'll all get killed...<br>  This should get u done with the mission...<br>  <br>  As for Big N Veiny..I dont remember the mission, so if u cud just provide me with the details I'll help u.

I was sooo pissed! Haven't played it in months!   But anyway, this game is really easy!  Go to a save point (there are about five in Hollow Bastion that I can think of right now.)   Easiest one is at the house were you talk to Merlin, go to there.  Do the same thing you would do to save, but instead click on gummi ship!  Simple!  Good luck!|`|JrDSGoyPaa	When you enter any save location there is a menu there to board your gummi ship.|`|xBdxsfFCaa	go to a save spot and click save<br>  <br>  -attack<br>  -magic<br>  -drive<br>  >  -save  <<br>  <br>  ...from there you have the option to save or board gummi

Tenchu looks cool, but their last few games have been huge let downs... Really weak games. Overlord looks cool, so does Call Of Juarez. Maybe rent, before dropping $60...|`|67a4b4bfd001414f85a34dbb6629acebaa	well overlord looks good and i'm a huge tenchu fan, but if you don't have gears, etc i'd work on getting that first. but my money is on tenchu.|`|9lLGVU7Gaa	The Darkness|`|l6KKLgkvaa	hmmm, the tenchu games keep me disappointing me more and more, but I really liked Shadowrun, its  fun but I dont know if Id pay 60 bucks for just a multiplayer game-it has no single player.
EQhY4x05aa	Make an account on the website.|`|3pUur8hbaa	Go to the website below to regester you need the code on the back of the case.

3D0FOthdaa	Yes, you can catch both on Pokemon Diamond. <br>  <br>  To catch Elekid, put Fire Red inside your GBA slot. Now go to either Route 205 or the Valley Windworks for a level 9 or 10 Elekid. You will have an eight percent chance of finding one all day and night.<br>  <br>  To catch Magby, put Leaf Green inside your GBA slot. Here's where you can catch it.<br>  <br>  Stark Mountain, Outside: Level 22<br>  Stark Mountain, first room: Level 25<br>  Stark Mountain, large room: Level 27<br>  Route 227: Level 22<br>  <br>  Like Elekid, it has an eight percent chance of being found all day and night.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped!|`|f7OSjABMaa	Sort of; yes, you can catch Elekid at  Route 204-South and Valley Windworks, and Magby at  Stark Mountain and Route 227, but you need the Fire Red game inserted into the GBA slot on the DS to find Elekid, and the Leaf Green game for Magby.<br>  <br>  or you could just use the online Global Trading System and ask for one|`|OIbBPz3Maa	yea u can but u have to have either the fire red or leaf green inserted in the gba game slot. if u dont have it then u cant and its on route uhmm 223 somewhere around there|`|9uvZpkZcaa	If you put your fire red and leaf green in the game slot and go to Mt.

But other than that you have a great team.|`|a85f7296bd89d164e65c09b343ee8a83aa	you'll probably have a bit of trouble. level 60's have better chances. its like that in all pokemon games|`|K7HqBGcyaa	To envolve Riolu:<br>  <br>  Riolu (Happiness + Daytime) =Lucario<br>  <br>  How to make a pokemon happy:<br>  <br>  Train your Pokemon and don't let them faint.<br>  Feed your Pokemon Poffins that they like.<br>  Walk your Pokemon in Amity Square.

Raikou's special attack and speed will be its highest statistics and it's defence will be it's lowest. If you encounter it in the wild for the first time don't try to catch it right away because it will get you be surprise. So after you counter it for the first time, use your pokedex to track him down. <br>  Note: He will change a different location everytime you fly, enter a new area,or enter a building.|`|NyDrTXFeaa	i think so because of scuicune|`|4p71Gd32aa	yeah but only if uv beaten the game|`|AA12095220	Im not sure but the easiest way is through Pkmn Colleseum.

h66Q1XUOaa	The only gang you can actually run is your own. You can take over other gang territories by defeating the opposing gang; therefore your gang will control that area. To recruit your gang members go up to one of your “homies” and target him then hit the up button on the directional pad. Depending on your respect level, I think you can recruit up to 7 members. They will follow you where ever and attack who ever you attack.|`|WRpgftK5aa	go up to one of your gang members aim at them and press up they will follow you around until they get killed|`|i5Cpc23Iaa	all you have to do is aim at the gang member and press g or h<br>  to recruit them.|`|iuVs3Yn8aa	Check out this website, it will show you cheats, codes, walkthroughs, reviews.

5e3a08fb0f8df1781963c23284f90448aa	I'm pretty sure you plug it into a USB port on your computer, and then use software (maybe I don't own this product nor a PS3) then get the internet to flow through the WiFi stick.<br>  <br>  Then go to your PS3, and probably find the internet or WiFi options, or whatever it says. Then when setting up the internet or WiFi, use "scan for an access point", or if there's an option, "use WiFi stick" or something that deals with an alternate access point.<br>  <br>  Of course, and you probably know this, but if you already have a wireless connection, for say a laptop, then you won't need that.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

tFMkGe2Zaa	First of all, if you are going to ban Barbie, you'd have to ban dolls like bratz as well! <br>  <br>  I don't think Barbie is responsible for girls these days having self esteem issues. Barbie has been around for more than this generation. In fact, I've seen a decline in the stuff that is available for Barbies as compared to when I was a kid. And I don't remember it ever being about designer clothes. I remember the cute clothes she had, but there weren't any labels...they were just cute clothes. Not too mention I used to love the clothes that were handmade just for my barbies. <br>  <br>  I never grew up thinking I had to be tall, curvy, and have thick, full blonde hair to be beautiful. Sure, I'm blonde, but my hair definitely isn't full. If anything Barbie taught me to be proud of my personal style. My dolls were different from my friends' dolls, and vice versa. <br>  <br>  People who pin this self esteem issues on Barbie seem to be looking for an easy way out of their problems. It's a stinkin' doll. If I have girl, I have every intention of letting her play with Barbies. They taught me to use my creativity and imagination.|`|7YeGJHQqaa	You know adults bring so many prejudices to Barbie, that kids wouldn't even think about. When I was little I LOVED playing with Barbies. In fact playing with Barbies helped me to express my creativity. I 'd spend hours playing in the back yard with friends, or in my room with my sister. For Christmas I couldn't wait to unwrap the shiny rectangle-shaped box that I knew held a brand new Barbie doll. And as far as barbie being anti-feminist in anyway, well I wouldn't agree. I may have had a whole collection of Barbie dolls, but I could also take on any boy in a wrestling match.|`|fpXDVT1paa	I think Barbie really F'ed up today's society....<br>  <br>  Most young adolescents (teens) almost as young as 10 to 16 are displaying this "Barbie" image.... where you always have to have "designer clothes" and you can only wear "brand name" things....<br>  <br>  I PERSONALLY think, girls would develop a sense of maturity at a much younger age....then they do now with their "Barbies" or "Perfect looking girl".... <br>  <br>  P.S: Not being sexist here.......|`|pglU2CTQaa	I think it's so cool that they want her out of West Virginia... I mean really, at least to me, a barbie was like that role model everyone needs to be in order to be beautiful..<br>  You know,, blonde, slim, tall, blue eyed... etc..<br>  And it can destroy a little girl's selfsteem. It makes you want to be someone else. Which is just horrible..|`|90b77bbefba2eb318173c23604ffe4d2aa	Really?  I don't remember Barbie when I was a child. I would have been 12 then. I never had a Barbie doll.  I think it makes girls think that life is all about looking thin, having the right clothes and being a ****. I think all dolls are stupid anyway.. never liked them.<br>  <br>  What is wrong with that word?? S l u t. It is what it is.
FKLvd3O1aa	depends.  if you want it overnight expect to pay like $26.00 extra.  sometimes the manufacturer ships it for free.  if its is coming from far about a week no exceptions|`|aF1tqNdXaa	not long now...|`|gLZogTC7aa	it depends on how you want it to be delivered as well as how far the company's manufacters are from your house. you have standard shipping, expedited, and overnight. Standard shipping is usually 5-10 business days for both UPS and USPS. Expedited is 3-5 days (not business) Fed-ex an UPS. And then overnight is delivered the next day granted you order before 1 pm the previous day. These delivery times are not set in stone, however, because it depends on close or how far you live from the company's manufactures. Case in point, lets say you got standard shipping with your order--it would take about 5 days normally. But, if you lived in New Jersey and the package was coming from New York, you could get it in as little as 2 days. It all depends.

qblrMFV0aa	Spoons is the greatest party card game.<br>  <br>  If you don't know:<br>  <br>  Everyone is dealt 4 cards.  Then in the middle of the circle, you place a spoon (fork, sticks, etc) for each person minus 1.  I.E.  8 people playing, 7 spoons.<br>  <br>  The goal of the game is to get 4 of a kind.  The dealer starts by picking up a card from the deck.  Then he passes one card to the left.  Then he picks up another.  The person on the left picks up the card passed to him and repeats the process.  The last player usually has a pile of cards which they are allowed to search through to get 4 of a kind (though kinda slow).<br>  <br>  When a person gets 4 of a kind, that person grabs a spoon.  Then everyone else makes a mad dash to grab a spoon.  You can do it stealthly (try to make it so no one notices that you grabbed a spoon, or you can yell it out.  It's all about your preference.<br>  <br>  We usually play it where everyone has 2 chances to grab a spoon.  If a player does not grab a spoon two times, then they are out and play continues with one less spoon and player.  Once a player is out, the counter gets reset and everyone starts out fresh again.|`|VxE46bSFaa	Hahaha all we ever play is Uno!|`|DkFoX4pHaa	STRIP POKER

nGYqrKPTaa	Phoenix Wing Wind Blast is better, and in some cases, better than <br>  Bottomless Trap Hole. I think PWWB is better because you can return any card on the field to the top of the deck, giving you hand advantage and stoping them from drawing and diff. cards. With CED, no draw delay of any kind, just gives them more cards in their hand, but their are both good for cards like Trap Dustshoot and Mind Crush. And if you run decks that is good to dis. cards from your hand, like some Zombie decks to get mez and plague to grave. Also being able to send Spells / Traps to the top of the deck is also great because it could be solemn and you have the freedom to do what you wish when solemns not on the field and other cards like Torrential Tribute and Mirror Force. So I would say PWWB IMO|`|K3gbmyCpaa	compulsory evacuation device, definetley. if you return a spell or trap card to their hand, they can just play it again next turn. If you return a monster, they can only summon one monster per turn, so that limits them. also, you get to keep the card that you would have discarded.|`|FXBNO1GTaa	i think the phoenix wing is better ... the reason is because ... if ur returning it to the top of the dekc ... most likely it is something u have seen ... if a tribute ,.,,  u know they what they will draw .. it will hinder 1 turn ... if  a magic/trap u know exactly what to look for .. with compulsory .. its just a monster and its back to the hand ... not delaying any draw and only monsters . Discarding a card is a small price and some cards u might not need ,etc ... a good time to put phoenix wing wind blast is in a dark world deck.|`|Q3FdhYgRaa	putting poenix in dark world is fail because the discard is cost not effect. phoenix wing wind blasts discard is a pretty big cost so it depends on weather or not you have discadable cards or not.|`|0jnILvY2aa	wing wind blast is better if u have discard able cards|`|DQyHwIeiaa	I like comp for heavy synchro decks, it pretty much destroys synchros for free.<br>  <br>  I run PWWB's because i have cards in my hand that i like to get out of there (like high tribute monsters.)<br>  <br>  I also like pwwb more against tribute monsters, nothing screws something over mid game monarchs like putting the monarch back on top of there deck after they waste a few cards to get it out.

zXAuoPOSaa	I struggled with this fear for a very long time. I was actually deathly afraid of going on roller coasters when I was smaller but now I love them. What made a difference for me was just calming and clearing my mind while I was in line, waiting to go on the ride. I would also do deep breathing which would really relax me if I concentrated on it hard enough. When I was on the ride I tried to consciously let go of the fear and actually enjoy the ride. I did this by just not analyzing my fear so much. I let the nervous thoughts just float away and be replaced by thoughts of "having fun". <br>  I think the best option for you is to just not analyze it anymore. Each time a nervous or negative thought enters your brain, you simply just think about something else. I know it sounds way too simple but, trust me, it absolutely works. The best of luck to you and try to have fun!|`|DEyjlz73aa	im 10 and i LOVE coasters but in ur case i would say just once ur at the top close ur eyes thats what i did when i was 8 so try it and i hope u have lotsssss of FUN|`|GfwjOVGdaa	Its ok that you feel that way, I used to have a friend like that.  Just think about the hundreds of thousands of people that ride the roller coasters yearly and don't get hurt.  And if this "Lake Compounce" amusement park is like all of the others,  they will spend the most money on safety because injuries cost them big bucks.  You'll be ok just relax and try to have some fun, nothing is going to happen to you, and after a few rides you will probably start to enjoy them.|`|nrTVlo8Eaa	I have tried and tried to conquer this fear and I just can't. It's not a fear of heights, not a fear of speed or jerky movements, and knowing it's safer than the way I drive my own car is no help whatsoever. For me it's the long drops; the feeling is so uncomfortable and so memorably awful that my body rebels any time I even consider riding these rides. <br>  <br>  Thankfully I don't have so much fear that I can't set foot in an amusement park because I've heard that there are people who are that scared. I can also stand in line at a roller coaster with my friends with no problem because I know that I won't be riding it with them. Beyond that I can't go. <br>  <br>  I've never tried taking a valium or xanax with me when I go to the amusement park simply because the rest of the day is enjoyable enough that I would like to stay alert. Besides, I'd still be alert enough to feel that dropping sensation and I doubt chemicals can fix that fear.<br>  <br>  I wonder about hypno therapy, but again, I doubt it would help.<br>  <br>  The best I can offer you is to say hopefully you can find some rides/activities that will justify the expense of the ticket cost when you go. Sometimes just a nice day with friends in the sunshine is more than worth it.|`|popRBGHUaa	It sounds like something happened to you, if you used to like roller coasters and now have a problem with them.  I am 45 and my girlfriend is 40.  We were both afraid of roller caosters our entire lives, but we started out with some daring non-coaster rides this past summer, then worked our way up, and rode some of the biggest and baddest coasters in the country in the fall.  The coasters at Lake Compounce are "kid stuff" compared to a lot of the ones we have been on.  Just start out with the milder rides and work your way up.  If you don't go on the most daring rides, at least you might have gotten past a former hurdle and might be able to try something more daring the next time.  We are both afraid of heights, but we don't worry about heights on roller coasters.  My girlfriend likes the "butterflies in the stomach" feeling, while I control my breathing and abs to reduce that feeling.  It takes practice, but it doesn't take away from the ride experience for me.  It also helps to NOT eat a lot of yucky foods before going on the rides.  We usually pig out on stuff like trail mix, peanut butter crackers, candy bars, and water before entering the park.  None of those things seem to make our stomachs queazy when we go on the rides.  Chili cheese dogs, corn dogs, greasy burgers, soda, and other foods are more likely to make your stomach queazy.|`|Dlni9XaFaa	well i absoultely love rollar costers and i only 13 and i think they are a blast.. i like getting scared thats the whole fun part about it.. i mean once you get off you will realize how much fun you had getting scared.. kinda like a haunted house.. but totally do it.. see i scared of water slides like at water parks and it makes me feel like i free falling cause i not straped in cause i don't feel safe.. but roller coasters you are strapped in and i feel safe.. i recommend the six flags over georgia   the golaith roller coster or ninja or definatly super man and bat man  but galaith was the scarrest cause it went up 200 feet high and dropped at 70 somethin mph and it was so fun i forget how many drops but after that first drop i wasn't afraid of nothin..|`|KODSAedQaa	Well I absolutely LOVE roller coasters, but my best friend is terrifyed. A big problem when we go to places like Disneyland and Great America. <br>  <br>  I suggest going on small rides first. Like the kind that just sit you down in a little two-seater and take you on some little kiddy adventure. Sounds retarded, but you can gradually build up from there. <br>  <br>  I dont wanna be cruel like I can be with my best friend LMAO. I tricked her into going on the Tower of Terror at California Adventures xD She took it surprising well after the bloodcurdling drop >___> LOL But of course we did the kiddy ride method first. It helped her, now she can ride the sorta-good rides x]|`|sgRDJUXqaa	I don't think that's a fear; it's just a strong dislike of that stomach-in-your-throat feeling.  I have it too.  I'm not afraid to go on them, I just don't like my insides moving around that much, lol.<br>  <br>  Try stress relieving activities, like taking deep breaths, closing your eyes (which I find helps actually), picturing yourself somewhere else, squeezing a stress ball -- things like that.  I would just avoid them; I'm sure you wouldn't be the only person doing so.  (Besides, maybe a cute girl will ask you to hold her purse, haha.)

Being greatly defensive, Umbreon can take a lot of hits and hit back with Payback. Payback is better on slower Pokemon since its power doubles if you go last, plus it gets Attack boost from Curse. Wish or Moonlight both heals. Moonlight is good for direct heal, but bad weather may mess it up, and it has low PP. Wish just takes 1 more turn to heal, and you can switch out to heal others. Yawn is forcing them to be asleep or switch out, and you can really get a free curse on it or a free heal.<br>  <br>  Be careful of Primeape with its Vital Spirit ability and STAB Fighting moves.|`|WVklvJNgaa	i would say: have an umbreon of sassy nature (+ sp.def  -speed)<br>  and for the attacks i would say : <br>  toxic<br>  sunny day<br>  moonlight<br>  and shadow ball

I created a craft kit for him that included colored construction paper, pipe cleaners, wiggly eyes, sewing notions like rick rack, ribbon, buttons, etc., stickers, special effect paint markers, colored pencils that when wet with water act as paint, paint brushes and anything else you can find perhaps at a Walmart store.  I put it all together in a plastic container with a lid and he loved it.  It kept him busy for hours.  As he uses up his favorite supplies, I replace them.  <br>  <br>  You might also consider some type of musical instrument because he is of the age where his musical talents can be promoted if exposed to an instrument where he can express himself musically.

JjKUpJ6naa	POP Sands of Time: it was really a good game and I can even say it was beyond a good game for IT's time...<br>  POP Warriors Within: it was perfect too, it had a very strong story and lot's of new weapons and enemy's ! Having such a terrible monster on your tail ,going back in time WOWww that was great! The only thing That I think it lacks was have some particular way of killing... I like this one most.. <br>  POP the Two Thrones : it was a good game but the story ends easily, yes perhaps it had some incredible cut scenes but I never enjoy <br>  fighting, because you didn't fight, just pressed buttons at right time, and even now I cannot understand where did he get that sand ring back <br>  because at the end of the past POP the monster take every sand Items from U!!!<br>  POP 4!!!!!: let's not speak about it because I think it was a shame!

2b6bec3d7f2fe8f5707c7d178253ef15aa	It also helps to state what game you are trying to play and the rom you have for it. You need to understand the structure of game roms. <br>  <br>  Lets say you are trying to play Pac Man. There may be different versions available. Many games are available from different countries US,UK,Asia,Eurp,World,Brizi . Also Versions .1, .21, .09.  You may even find them saying that they are a clone of another game. Some games need the master rom (this is the first rom the game used ie Pac Man then as other versions came out they just made patches and added on to the master. So both the master rom and the patch would be needed) Some roms need BIOS roms to play, these would be like the Street fighters series requiring CPZ1 and/or CPZ2 bios also NeoGeo games needing the NeoGeo bios. More advanced/newer games require CHD files which are the hardest to come by and the largest files MAME uses. And lastly not all games listed in MAME32 work or work properly and states that in the descriptions<br>  <br>  So the more Information about a game you are trying to play will help out the most. <br>  <br>  Also MAME32 you should state what version of it you are using. You need above version .115 to use with Vista (VISTA has a lot of issues with older games and programs not given the Microsoft AOK) <br>  <br>  You have done right by placing the roms in the right location and by leaving them zipped. Give some more info an keep looking here....|`|AA10398889	HAHAHA! DUDE! roms are illegal downloads, and normally that wouldnt be a problm, whos gonna find out unless u download like a million right? but vista, apart from taking up like 800 mb of ram, operating system alone outta the box, it reports all illegal downloads! vista probably messed u up so u couldnt use them! ill stick to windows XP, it doesnt report illegal downloads, and it doesnt use up much ram.(the 800mb thing is the main reason that most pc w/ vista come with a couple of gigs of ram already inside)

TYstsM7Yaa	it is all about how the game designer intends it. most do include aim assist and most you are able to turn off in settings. 
6FnOyZ00aa	Most of the time its because your NAT is not set to OPEN. Go to the dashboard, go to the system blade. Go to NETWORK SETTINGS and select TEST XBOX LIVE CONNECTION. At the bottom is your NAT and it should always read OPEN to get the best connection. Otherwise you'll have problems joining games and trouble like you're experiencing. Also, but not often, your router won't be compatible with someone elses and you won't be able to hear them or sometime have trouble connecting at all, even with your friends. I have one friend that I have to run a direct connection from the wall to the xbox, just to play with them.|`|TYstsM7Yaa	this means you have a family setting, IF U ARE UNDER 18.

THIS may require a password that was set when u created the account.

Or like clear nailpolish if you have that much time.|`|VK3uWrs1aa	dont know never tried it|`|0eqamEIeaa	By the sounds of 'the entire weapon was ruined', it was more than surface cracking, maybe the surface needs more sealer (under the paint, like they said in other posts) but more importantly, maybe the underlying foam wasn't rigid enough.

Either use firm foam, or thicker paper mache.|`|sKwTnTw9aa	get some paper-mache anti-cracking gel.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_mache" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_mache</a>|`|qEDEmgLfaa	did paint crack or paper...use Mod Podge before paint, make sure it has time for mod podge to dry then put on a second coat, then dry and paint it.
fub5QVFfaa	Well done on doing all that.<br>  <br>  It doesn't matter. The egg colour makes no difference on the dragon within. Once the egg hatches, you get an option to go to a glade. The priestess is there. When you talk to her, you can ask to change its element. So you can make your dragon suit the place you are about to explore. So just pick a nice colour and hatch the egg (and watch an interesting cutscene). The element is chosen after. Artix and Co chose not to make the colours matter since some of the colours are so similar.
mTmonRD8aa	No, I would say level up some more just to be on the safe side.
aQ9EX98Gaa	The top two that I would recommend are: Ace Attorney games, and The World Ends with you.<br>  <br>  There are actually four installments of the Ace Attorney games. In order are:<br>  Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney<br>  Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Justice For All<br>  Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trials and Tribulations<br>  and Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney<br>  I'm not going to lie, these games don't really appeal to everyone. They whole premise is that you play as a defense attorney, solving crimes and proving your clients innocent. These games are incredibly funny and witty all at the same time. There is a lot reading involved as well as a lot of thinking, which will most likely lead to frustration. Gameplay consists of an investigation portion where you go around to locations associated with the crime to collect evidence and question witnesses and a trial portion where you disprove testimonies by presenting evidence. This is also where you get to shout "OBJECTION" into your DS. x3 They require a keen eye for details and logical thought, and even then they may be difficult. Personally, I find them to get increasingly easier the more I play them. Though it may be hard to track them all down without shopping on the internet as the earlier games are becoming increasingly difficult to find. However, if you start with Apollo Justice, you won't miss any of the main plot points by not playing the previous games. I personally started with the third game, worked my way backwards to the first, then played Apollo. You can't get much more screwed up than that. x3<br>  <br>  As for The World Ends with you, it is a great RPG, the storyline is awesome, characters are entertaining but still hold their depth, and it probably has the most replay value than any other game I've played. It's actually designed by the same development team who created Kingdom Hearts, so it will appeal to people who are already fans of Kingdom Hearts, however I would have to say this game is a bit more mature and probably interests a greater audience than Kingdom Hearts. Also, I can almost guarantee that Sho Minamimoto will become your favorite video game villain. xD Just seeing the things he says will make you think "Wow. Really? Did they really make this guy..."<br>  <br>  I've also heard very good things about Professor Layton and the Curious village.

5NIKZPqpaa	hmmm, if you mean by improving the sounds and not the looks, then you should have the tuning keys of drums. snare and toms' sounds to its appropriate sound by adjusting them using that key, if you dont have that one then you can buy it in any music stores, you have to make sure that you know its proper tune to do this.|`|ZUELM4Nnaa	If you have a factory drum kit and your mixing it with Sabian cymbals which are very high quality, your going to sound really off.<br>  <br>  Is it just the toms and snare that sound terrible? How many toms do you have, or intend to use?<br>  <br>  If your picking up the less 'standard'  cymbals such as splashes and china's, the diverse sound they create is going to sound pretty crap with a factory kit. My advice, is to invest a little more and buy yourself a decent pearl snare. I know they're expensive but seriously, if you paying 400 and 100 for other items you might as well go the whole hog and get yourself some decent drums.<br>  <br>  If you can't afford to redo your whole kit, invest in the snare, and one tom. I personally don't use my second larger tom much at all, in some cases I have removed it from the kit entirely and added a cow bell. Upgrading the quality of your drums will make your entire kit and the newly purchased cymbals sound a tonne better.<br>  <br>  You can pick up a decent pearl snare on ebay for about $100-200 AUS if you shop around.<br>  <br>  And, in reference to your original question if you can't afford to replace your snare and toms,  I'd say work with the heads first, purely because they're a lot cheaper to replace, and are more flexible with tuning. If your shells are poor quality though, it won't do much good.<br>  <br>  BTW: Nice find with the Sabian package! =)|`|g7sZ8elHaa	try using remo heads on the snare and toms. or they might just need tuning.
p1e15P7Laa	Wel first you have to create your idea and then you can start making it|`|KTNqah9eaa	Why not get a big piece of paper and start drawing something on it and see what you come up with?|`|q1Fav370aa	Come up with an idea first, really flesh it out, give it style, pizzaz. When your concept is thought out enough, try a simple paper prototype, building upon your game more and more, coming up with the rules and whatnot. When it seems like your prototype is in its best state (i.e. its actually fun to play) then try pitching your idea at companies that manufacture board games. Besides the big ones, theres plenty of smaller ones, or try toy companies, you just never know. If no one wants to make it, then try making flash web version of your game and put it on sites fo that sort of thing. If it gains popularity, try again with the manufacturers.|`|SCy20RcWaa	Check out the board game design group on yahoo groups.

And files get created/deleted all the time.<br>  <br>  Such activity is less common on a game console hard drive, so it would take much longer for any negative effects to result from fragmentation.

bKo79vnBaa	You are going to level a hunter faster simply because you can use your pet to tank and just hammer away at them with you gun/bow. Both are good in BGs if you spec right. Locks are frail so you are going to be spending your time by doing (dot dot fear). All classes are fun, it just depends on what you like best. You should try out both of them.|`|AA12328571	I got a level 80 Hunter and really enjoying it, questing is so much more easier and more fun with a hunter as the pet helps alot, you pretty much get double dps as you get the dps you putting on and the dps you're pet is putting on. Some raids and bg's my pet has actually outdone me on dps so pretty happy with that. <br>  The pro's- Really easy to solo level, with the profession of skinning and leatherworking you can make quite alot of gold.Dps with the right gear can do massive hits, one of the hunters in my guild always tops the damage meter list.<br>  <br>  The con's- Melee attack aint the best, A hunter is only as good with his pet alive, without my pet, pretty much a dead hunter, you can still defeat mobs without the pet but pretty much need to know everything your hunter can do, thats why i do as much dps as possible with the pet and if it dies, i can still have a shot at defeating the enemy.|`|DhBAtmGRaa	will atm the war lock is brock up in pvp but in pve #1 in my guild cuz of the dots they put out and warlocks are going to get good again i know it and hunters will get nerfed because survival spec is BA so every 1 changes to it and its hard to do pve with all the Competition i would play a warlock they are fun cuz if u are almost dead just fear and run lol i also like how they are so evil to|`|yX1O5EcDaa	I myself have an 80 hunter, fully epicced out and have completed every raid in game, that bieng said:hunters are boring when u get them high up, but they do excellent dps if specced correctly and have good gear.<br>  <br>  In pvp warlocks are very good because they can just dot you up, then fear and you die, that easy. Hunters are good in pvp, but they arent the best by any means, actually theyre probably one of the worst classes for pvp. and in pvp warlocks can do decent damage at 80 but they usually arent at the top of the charts, and if you do choose a warlock i promise you, you wont do that much damage in instances and such simply because warlocks rely on their dot's and at low lvls, thing just dont stay alive long enough for your dots to do anything.<br>  <br>  umm, they both can solo quest pretty easily because they both have pets that can tank (warlocks use voidwalker to tank) but id say hunters would kill their targets a lil quicker. besides that i think it comes down to what ever you prefer (choosing a class usually isnt that easy, i chose a hunter because i love ranged weps, so i went with a hunter, but now i play every class, my hunter is my main, but i have 1 of every class all over lvl 50, good luck|`|2jxysUjCaa	I have both BM spec Hunter And  Demon spec Warlock both are now 80 its hard for me to pick witch one i wanna play more.. I love my hunter she is sweet not much to her just let pet do work and shoot :) but with my lock its a bit more work i love my big boy he is unstoppable but if he dies i can just fear until i get him back but with the hunter with BM if my pet dies i am done no coming back from that, the traps work less then half the time.<br>  I like pvp with lock better then the hunter.<br>  one more thing about lock with WOLK you get the epic mount with out doing the quest for it so that's very nice :)

This is usually what happens when accounts have been "hacked" if this is the case you need to be honest with xbox when you call them and then they can do something about it. Otherwise you are SOL|`|Bgo0xmjnaa	Errrr it wasn't me...........<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Hehehehehehehehehehehe|`|5XcRNeh6aa	I would give it a couple of days, cause it could be just Microsoft having issues with the servers.

mOTCr8Pxaa	Yeah, prety much. There isn't any storyline after Heatran.|`|Qe19kcUbaa	Giratina<br>  <br>  A new path has opened up near Veilstone city. You can get their by flying to <br>  Veilstone and heading south. Stick to the east side while heading south and you<br>  will see a new opening. This is the spring path. The spring path leads to the<br>  Sendoff Spring. Walk around the spring until you get to a cave entrance. You <br>  will need to use Rock Climb to enter Turnback Cave.<br>  <br>  The cave is very difficult to navigate through and if you return through a door<br>  from which you came, you will back at the beginning. I was able to get to<br>  Giratina in six rooms but when I tried to duplicate it, it wasn't the right<br>  route. It seems that the cave is random. You need to get past 3 pillars per<br>  the writings instructions. The first room is easy as you can just turnback if <br>  you pick a room that does not have a pillar. Also, do not forget that you can<br>  also go south.<br>  <br>  When you do encounter Giratina, it will be lvl70 and is a ghost/dragon type. A<br>  normal pokemon works very well here as 2 of the 3 attacking moves Giratina has<br>  do not effect normal types. It will be only using slash on your normal pokemon<br>  so a pokemon with Intimidate is going to work out even moreso. Dusk balls catch<br>  it. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Then,,,<br>  <br>  Rotom<br>  <br>  Rotom is available in the Old Chateau once you beat the elite four. Return to<br>  the chateau and head upstairs. There is a tv in one of the rooms up there so <br>  press A on the tv. You will be attacked by Rotom. Rotom is an electric ghost <br>  and is at lvl15 so do not bring your legendary capture team. If you do not <br>  encounter Rotom on the tv, try again later until you finally do. Keep trying, <br>  it is there. Rotom comes out at night so do not look for him during the day.<br>  <br>  Then,,,<br>  <br>  Regigigas<br>  <br>  You will need to use Pal Park to have access to this lvl70 beast. In order for <br>  this Regi to show up, you need to first transfer Regirock, Registeel and Regice<br>  from Pokemon Ruby/Sapphire to Diamond/Pearl. With these three pokes in your <br>  party, head to the temple north of Snowpoint City. You will be blocked at first<br>  but Cynthia will show up and tell you it is OK to enter. Regigigas is in there <br>  and is a normal type.<br>  <br>  1) Enter, go down stairs. Calcium is here and another staircase. Go down.<br>  2) This next room isn't hard. Follow the path and go down the stairs again.<br>  3) Now the ice puzzle. Go down the ice that is between the two rocks. East,<br>     north, west, north, west, south. You should stop now. West, north, east,<br>     north, stairs. Walk through the rocks and go down the stairs.<br>  4) We can now see Regigigas but first, ice puzzle. Stand by the 3 rocks so that<br>     you make a square. Head east onto the ice.<br>  5) South, stop, south,east, north, stop, west, south, east, North.<br>  <br>  Press A on Regigigas and as long as you have the 3 REGIs in your party, the <br>  statue will come alive. Ghost type works really well here. Make sure you have a<br>  lot of Dusk and Timer balls.<br>  <br>  Then Fill you pokedex or get points in the battle tower!!!

3oKcNr3caa	Xbox live doesn't use dedicated servers for its games, players use there bandwidth to host games. <br>  Internet speeds currently not fast enough to handle 1 person hosting a game of that size, maybe in the future when super ridiculously fast internet connections become standard.<br>  <br>  Its possible that they could use some dedicated servers like they do for MMO's (FF XI) but they would end up charging extra for people to use.<br>  You shouldn't get your hopes up

0brkUyGgaa	Well...<br>  <br>  Several of the legendaries have new forms, most notably Giratina. Rotom now has five new forms. Shaymin also has a new form, though it's of little consequence since people normally couldn't get it in Diamond/Pearl.The three Regis from Ruby/Sapphire/Emerald are more easily obtained.<br>  <br>  New areas include the Distortion World, which has been seen in commercials, and the Battle Frontier from Emerald.<br>  <br>  Some new characters have been introduced, including a Team Galactic scientist and a detective who is investigating Galactic.<br>  <br>  Platinum can link with your Wii and send GTS updates to your Wii when a trade is made. Another update for the GTS is, if you get a Pokémon from a different region, let's say Japan, a Japanese entry will be added to your Poké Dex.<br>  <br>  You can now get Dialga and Palkia with only one version.<br>  <br>  Background visuals have been improved from DP.<br>  <br>  The order that the gyms are battled in differs from DP.<br>  <br>  There are other add-ons as well.

2WrV0Js6aa	hmmmm. well an archer is mainly just str and dex base.<br>  since you are lvl 94, you should have 99 str right now and the rest to dex. REMEMBER...your strenght should always be 5 more above your level...like if your lvl 100.it should be 105..the reason is because the weapons/armors require STR!!! so yah..all the rest of the stats go to dex. =] 900~3000? i think that's a little low...try getting some good attack work gloves and a good bow. and you shouldn't be training at yetis...the spawn is bad and they hurt..i reccommend...partying at gobis.|`|OGM7g6anaa	A good stats range.. hm that's hard to determine but I can direct you to a website in which some archers post their damage ranges.

The rest of your deck is meant to kill with damage.  If your opponent plays enough spells for them to matter, you'll be dead)<br>  Onyx Goblet (does nothing)<br>  Quenchable Fire (very inefficient way to deal 3 damage--occassionally ore, bot not enough reliably)<br>  Filligree Sages (you're not running enough artifacts for this to help)<br>  Reliquary Tower (does absolutely nothing.  Andyour deck needs a lot of colored mana)<br>  <br>  Add: <br>  Your deck really needs a lot more creatures.  There are hundredof options, including a lot of good red/black creatures from Alara and Conflux.  Goblin Deathraiders, Hell's Thunder, all of the Unearth reatures, Especially focus on the creatures that cost 2-4 mana total.<br>  <br>  Also, you need to add more removal.

JrAq9Z91aa	They are all such GOOD games.And Fallout 3 is the shizz.<br>  Lol.But Im going to tell you the pros and cons of Devil May Cry 4 and <br>  Assasins Creed.[Pros and cons...Good and bad things about it]<br>   <br>  Assassins  Creed:<br>  Pros:<br>  Actually has funner and better Combat system.You can go stealth Kill.Or all out Brawl.Funnest ever.Probaly Best Game I've ever played in my life and Im sure you'll love it just as much as me.You Have Theifing.Weapons kinda lvl up.And is free roam HEAVEN.The storyline is very understanding.And very interesting.Spoiler down there:<br>  Spoiler:Its a guy that goes back in time and is in his ancestors body.I think in Jerusalem.Or something.I forget.And He is Assasinating the Muslims.Very Fun.<br>  <br>  <br>  Cons:<br>  There is no music.<br>  <br>  Devil May Cry 4:<br>   <br>  Pros:<br>  Has Kick Booty Music.And awesommmmmmeee looking weapons.<br>  <br>  Cons:Not that fun.And you fight too much.I want a storyline.Which it has but people get tired of fighting those monsters left AND right.All you do is fight the whole game.And Angles are pretty Bad too.|`|1a0f6fbe24356f0f5db0fe61e06d93deaa	Creed has a nice story and more of a strategic gameplay whilst DMC4 has alot of action and well, more action. Overall DMC4 is more fun whilst SinCreed is alot more immersing|`|9yLYcDVPaa	neither. Get Fallout 3 best game ever.|`|ce7d9476f89500dea124f2208519bdcfaa	Grab yourself a copy of Devil May Cry 4, another amazing game in the series, Assassins Creed became boring about half way through for me, as it is very repetitive, just going around doing basic tasks, revealing more parts of the city, then assassinating somebody, 9 times|`|SE8TzHjtaa	I agree with the Fallout 3 statement, but between the two listed, Creed.<br>  Devil May Cry's camera system is so annoying. (I've only played the demo.)<br>  And Creed is just fun, although repetitive after a while, it's still fun.<br>  And Creed 2 has been announced as well.|`|5XcRNeh6aa	Kind of a tough call in some ways, they both have there ups and downs. I would go with Devil May Cry 4 myself, cause even though assassin's creed is indeed a free roaming game but the story line is weak and odd. Never played DMC 4 but I have a friend that has for the 360, and I own assassin's creed for ps3.|`|9WAtB40aaa	DMC 4<br>  <br>  you're freaking Dante for christs sake, that should be enough for you to make up your mind and get devil may cry.|`|0jnILvY2aa	you should get DMC4. its awsome.|`|UIyyPNWPaa	Devil May Cry 4 is the game you should choose. I read here one said that the game is tiring with just fight, but you learn new action moves, and you get incredible cgi cutscenes. <br>  <br>  Saying that a game is boring cause all you do is fight demons over and over again is like saying I'm tired of mario brothers with running around jumping on bad guys over, and over. Yet mario brothers is one of the most famous games out there =P.<br>  <br>  Devil May Cry 4 also has incredible voice actors. They put a lot of work into there voice acting. So much in fact that all the voice actors did all the body action as well for the game cgi cutscenes.  <br>  <br>  As the director of DMC 4 said, you can't own a PS3  with out getting DMC 4 =P<br>  <br>  The only con I say to this game is that you don't get to play as Dante as much, and that the fighting in this game doesn't last as long I believe as the others. Cause I noticed the lack of demons that showed up time to time, but doesn't make the game any less fun. <br>  <br>  You get to stretch your demon arm 20 feet away and drag the demons to you and hack them up, or throw them up in the air and slam them to the ground, or take there weapons out of their hands and jam them into their backs. Or grabbing them and punching them dozens of times with in like 5 seconds. Or use a demon dogs head as a rocket launcher.<br>  <br>  There are many, many more different kinds of fighting styles in this game to even begin describing. You may be doing nothing but fighting, but you get new styles of fighting when furthering into the game.<br>  <br>  Gotta remember that Devil May Cry was created by an accident. Devil May Cry 1 was orginally suppost to be Resident Evil 4 lol. So an accident that became this big, is like the best kind of accident!
wz0HdlL1aa	it's no real brand.  a lot of people are calling it a "generi-caster"<br>  <br>  from sourced link:<br>  <br>  "The Generi-Caster Guitar Hero Guitar<br>  I'm not sure if this guitar has a name, but due to legal wranglings between Gibson and Activision over patent infringement of the previous designs, Red Octane designed a guitar that was totally original, not based on any guitar design, or infringing on any trademarks (although some will argue it does look like a specific guitar)."
7hD5b6oZaa	It completely depends on what kind of game you want to make. If it's an RPG or a Shoot-'Em-Up game. Where the setting is and if you have any ideas on what the storyline is like. If you want, I can try drawing up some character designs for you if you want to get in touch. But no promises~<br>  <br>  The usual RPG usually has a heroic male as the main character. But it's really hard to make a main character everyone likes. For instance, Lina Inverse, Laharl, and Edward Elric are all insanely popular main characters in anime and video games. If you look closely, you see one thing in common for all three characters; They love kicking butt, they have a bad attitude, and they're very energetic. Other main characters are usually ranged by personality. For instance; you can have a hyper person, an emo person, a smart boring person, a dorky person, a strong dark and scary person, etc. If the main character falls in love with a girl, the girl has to be a good character as well. She can't be too girly, but she can't be too dark. A strong female with a cute personality might work. When it comes to outfits, you have a large range of ideas out there. If it's a midevil game, you usually have just the typical adventurer's outfit. A vest, maybe a hat, a belt to hold his sword, etc. (Usually the main character uses a sword.) It's been used millions of times. Then there's the more colorful midevil outfit you'd usually see in The Slayers. It's like everyday midevil clothing but corny and bright colored. Then there's always the fun SteamPunk look. Everyone loves that~<br>  As for the bad guy, I would actually make the arch nemesis stupidly evil and hot. Like Sephiroth. Unless you wanna go for the cartoony bad guy, with the everyday corny evil laugh (Mwahahaha!) and incredibly ugly. But to be honest I'd go and make the bad guy of the game have a personality and good to average looks. He doesn't have to have a big cape or anything, or be a complete jerk. He just has to hate the main character and have his reasons. He also has to be incredibly powerful. Give him an awesome air ship or a dragon! :D<br>  Normal enemies are usually the typical goblins and strange monsters. Go for the weird things like evil plants and demons.<br>  <br>  If it's a shoot-'em-up game, I unfortunately can't help you. I am disturbed by games like Halo because it's very plain. Soldiers all look the same, you know? Main characters should be unique and awesome compared to everyone else.. At least awesome looking.
yiEUOwK0aa	i say "bananas"... but, hey... i'm your sister... and who in their right mind listens to their sister concerning video games???|`|xi9sOmEXaa	use something with big numbers so everyone will feel rich (like yen)|`|wil9TlCxaa	Just some made up currency that fits the game's world.<br>  <br>  Or you can go basic and use Gold or Silver.

eNHGiEvGaa	From PStars:<br>  <br>  "Points = 10 * [sqrt(n)/sqrt(k)] * [1+log(b+0.25)]<br>  <br>  Where:<br>  <br>  n is the number of entrants <br>  k is the place of finish (k=1 for the first-place finisher, and so on) <br>  b is the buy-in amount in dollars (excluding administrative fee). For freerolls the buy-in is $0, and for FPP tournaments 1 FPP is counted as $0.0161."<br>  <br>  Therefore, in your specific case, <br>  <br>  10 * [sqrt(90)/sqrt(1)] * [1+log(1+0.25)]  =<br>  <br>  10 * [9.4868] * [1.0969]<br>  <br>  Which works out to about 104.<br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  The formula looks complicated, but if you play around with it for a while, with a calculator, you'll learn a few important points:<br>  <br>  -Field size is MUCH more important than the cost of the tournament buy-in.  In fact, a $10,000 buy-in tourney is only worth about 3 times the number of points as a $10 tourney of the same size.<br>  <br>  -Finishing 3rd out of 300 earns the same number of points as finishing 1st out of 100.  <br>  <br>  So, winning is nice, but there's not really a "premium on winning."  If you can place high in big fields, it may be more valuable than beating smaller fields.  For instance, you can expect to finish in the top 3 out of 300 just as often as you win 1st out of 100... but "in the top 3" includes some 1st and 2nd place finishes too, unless you're a bad shorthanded player.<br>  <br>  Conclusion:  If you care about tournament leader board points, the key is to play tons of tournaments with large fields.

Most games DO NOT come with a mac version on the same disc, although some do.  Spore is a good example.<br>  <br>  Here is a list of games that have a mac version<br>  <a href="http://www.apple.com/games/articles/" rel="nofollow">http://www.apple.com/games/articles/</a><br>  <br>  There are a ton of mainstream titles on this list, such as WoW, COD4, Spore, Civ IV, Need for Speed Carbon, Quake, Rollercoaster Tycoon 3, and many more.

If there is a mac version of the game, it will probably as good as the windows version but with online games, you may not be able to play with windows users.|`|5XcRNeh6aa	Yeah you would have to get the mac versions of the games that you want to play and it's kind limited selection too.

Another way is to get large amounts of coal and iron/mith/addy/rune (level varies) ores and smelt them. Typically you get twice back what you spent (eg, spend 100k on ores, get 200k back) and this means the cost of ores TOGETHER. Repeating this trick over and over works well. (Plus the smithin exp is bonus)<br>  Also, making teletabs is a good way, and gains magic exp while doing it. They always are in demand, so they sell quick, and usually are worth about three or four times the cost of runes, not counting the discount by using a elemental staff of some sort.|`|11PsymVQaa	hi i had this problem too but instead of asking and looking up stuff i went on and did some research.

If the router is malfunctioning I would message Linksys Support.<br>  <br>  You can also try Port Forwarding PSN, they have lots of guides at:<br>  <a href="http://portforward.com/" rel="nofollow">http://portforward.com/</a><br>  <br>  And probably a sure way of fixing all of this would be to connect it wired rather than wireless.<br>  <br>  If all of those fail, contact Sony or your internet service provider.<br>  <br>  Best of luck!|`|AA11477464	Because Sony sucks. MICROSOFT. Its made in the US. How could you not buy it?
U1HqGfUEaa	Well check the obvious...<br>  <br>  Is the tv on? <br>  <br>  Are the cables plugged in correctly?(HD cables(blue/green) will not work in RCA plugs(red/white/yellow) and vise versa.<br>  <br>  Check to make sure that the switch that is on the video cable plug(on the underside of the part that actually plugs into the xbox) is switched to the correct setting, either HD or standard I believe.<br>  <br>  Other than that, try a different tv with your xbox to make sure that it is not a problem with the xbox. Have your friend set it up to eliminate any problems you yourself might be causing.<br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  <br>  (To Devon's Response)- No way to change the resolution if you can't see what you're doing in the first place.|`|AA10911952	There is a switch on the cable near where it plugs into the 360, have you got it on the correct setting?|`|CVHZM3asaa	I would go with MLW's answer, and also when you set up your xbox, did you set it to the right resolution? i.e. if you make the resolution for a 1080p tv and you are trying to play it on a normal SD TV it would probably do that.|`|AA11477464	You have terrible internet. Thats the answer no matter what others say. The internet cant load them cuz they are too many megabits or what not. Get a better internet Sorry buddy.|`|X8yfEFgIaa	are they HD cable? you could be using hd on a non hd tv and alot of older TVs can't handle the graphics.
U1HqGfUEaa	1. No, absolutely not. Why fix a problem that isn't there(it's not a permanent fix either)<br>  <br>  2. As long as your xbox has proper ventilation and your house is under 75 degrees your xbox should be fine.  Also, if this is a new xbox 360, then you have nothing to be concerned with. The RROD problem was solved by microsoft a while ago. This is overkill.<br>  <br>  3. The stand is useless, don't bother. The electric fan will do more than nothing but keep dust off your xbox.<br>  <br>  <br>  Seems that you're really freaked out about getting red rings but overall, all of these third-party products aren't going to help keep your xbox that much cooler and you're wasting money.<br>  <br>  Quit worrying about it and enjoy your purchase.|`|AA10911952	1) No, if it ain't broke, don't fix it<br>  2-3) Probably not, are you affraid it's going to melt? I have tested my console on 35-40 degree celcius days, and as low as 9-10 degree celcius nights, no worries.|`|HTWIR7mRaa	1.  No, not until it RRODs  the newer consoles are pretty much safe from rrod for quite a bit (unless your a 24/7 gamer)<br>  <br>  2.  Yeah, the talismoon fans are the best you can get.<br>  <br>  3.  Don't worry about cooling, the talismoon will handle the cooling.|`|CVHZM3asaa	I think instead of wasting time and money on that arcade you should have just got the pro.
C02lxopxaa	i guess it could be worth somthing<br>  back in the day i can remember the dark ones were not even worth that much even if there shiny<br>  and energy cards arnt even worth anything really<br>  <br>  if ur shiny ones a charizard it could be worth somthing maybe<br>  thats alot cards <br>  try ebay<br>  or flea market or even in the mall i saw places  that still sell them<br>  craigslist 2 i really dont know any places that buy them anymore<br>  <br>  i dont even know how i remember this still???|`|59f0d623da24062341c864749a68da9daa	Probably a few dollars. If you have any first editions, and of the earlier sets (the ones you categorize number 1), they may be worth a little more.  Only the foils (the shinies) have any value, and even that is not that common.  The problem is that there were soooooo many Pokemon cards printed, that they just don't have a lot of collector's value.  Maybe 20 years from now, but possibly not even then.|`|NToiXYjFaa	Don't sell them pokemon is the shizzle yo!!!<br>  that was gay, but go to a store or wherever they sell them and see if they would take them.|`|0ba9eacdb0aff6ff4deedb2b577fddd1aa	I think it should be more than $50.
lf58E1MEaa	If your a non-member then Rune is obviously the best armor.<br>  <br>  and if you are a member who has ALOT of money then dragon is the best armor.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|cMzA8qTMaa	dragon armor i believe|`|11PsymVQaa	you should buy dragon... <br>  but if you have other stats like high level range or what not you should wear my favorite armor which is armadyl sorry if i spell it wrong. I just like the stats it gives me. The only problem is that it's around 20mil.|`|uyjHpXEEaa	i reackon you should wear guthan or dharkos with a god sword, but if u hav enough for drag full i would say that<br>  <br>  :D|`|FKsxbgOSaa	Dragon definitely
6npsRIzUaa	As far as I know there are no lookup generators, you can Google HTML/CSS sites though to help you make one, or even ask on the Neopets Help boards for a petpage that has a step-by-step guide on how to make one (I know there are a couple out there, I just don't know the link to them).<br>  <br>  You could also look at other premade lookup codes and change things around to see how it effects the layout (DO NOT take credit for the code though, Neomail the creator first to make sure it is OK to use and edit their code, and for credit just write 'coded by -insert UN- and edited by me').<br>  <br>  UN = Username|`|OrFu77k3aa	You can get fast and easy neopoints from <a href="http://www.turmaculus.com." rel="nofollow">http://www.turmaculus.com.</a> I bought 2 million neopoints from there and they delivered within 20 minutes!

59f0d623da24062341c864749a68da9daa	If two or more triggered abilities are being put on the stack at the same time, they will be put on in APNAP order.  That means all of the Active Player's triggered abilities go on first, then all of the non-active players (in a multiplayer game, go clockwise around the table from the active player).  If any player controls more than one triggered ability, when it is there chance to put the abilties on, they choose the order.<br>  <br>  Then players can choose to respond to those abilities being put on the stack.  If no one does, the last item put on the stack resolves first (that will usually be the non-active player's).  Then players get a chance to respond again, thn the next thing on the stack resolves.<br>  <br>  In this situation, it's your turn, so you're the active player.  First you put your ability on the stack, then you put your opponents on the stack.  Both of you can play spells or abilities.  Assuming no one does, your opponent's resolves first, so first you clash.  If he wins the clash, he puts the creature into his hand.  In that case, when it comes time to use your ability, yours will no longer work since the card has changes zones since the ability was put on the stack.  If he loses the clash, then you will get to put the creature into play under your control.<br>  <br>  In the future, you'll be able to get these and any other questions answered more easily at the official Magic the Gathering Forums.  There's even a forum dedicated to Rules Question and Answers.  I don't have the link off the top of my head, but you can send an email through Yahoo and I'll get you the link.|`|l9LL5xOvaa	<a href="http://www.wizards.com/magic/multiverse/default.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.wizards.com/magic/multiverse/...</a>
c7Zmlediaa	I really like the pedometer pets.  :)  The only one I remember being released in the US is the Pocket Pikachu.  I wish the Tamagotchi developers would take that into consideration (pedometer)!<br>  <br>  And yes, I do like the fake Vpets better than Tamagotchis (for the most part) because there are a lot of different kinds of pets.  The games and "care" of the Tamagotchis are so... repetitive.|`|qfGXtF5taa	My favorites are real, live pets. Of course I guess tamagotchi does satisfy that desire for a pet dinosaur.|`|m9gJ6nHUaa	what are tamgotchis? just joking vpets all da wasy
Jff2i7msaa	the exact same thing happened to me and my friends!!! i think it is just a glitch in the game though. if you don't want to constantly keep feeding your pets, then you could just send them to the spa! they come back 100% happy, healthy, and not hungry!!! if you have enough money to send them, that is. if you want to give me your username then i can send you some food, cuz i have a lot of food and a lot of money. (63,273) just e-mail me cuz you might not wanna post your username on the open internet! hope this helps!!! = ]
ajNTSffmaa	Buy it.|`|EBkW1ME4aa	very good deal imo|`|Ict5JA4eaa	good deal, i'd buy it|`|yJiWpvxSaa	yes, every games is like 20 to 30 plus the psp is like 120 used|`|977eab4a315d43905b937b86490bae16aa	PSP is a great machine, funner then ipod touch|`|uzGjTBhYaa	ya but the psps graphics might be alright but overall they got boring real quick|`|11PsymVQaa	That's i really awesome deal that i would take even if i don't want because you can sell it for more. Well if you buy it new, it would be around 300 dollars i'm guessing and would be a rip off compared to this. I too had a deal like this but mines is a psp slim and the old one with like 12 games for 35 dollars. So i hope i helped you out.|`|FKsxbgOSaa	great deal, get it|`|IeEFay1raa	yes its very goods deals...u must buy it...
yrYQHbYAaa	Something has been done, there are ratings on games just like on violent movies. Its up to the parents to check what content they feel is alright for their kids, they do it with movies but seem to forget it when it comes to games.<br>  <br>  I had a mother & her ten year old son come in to buy condemd 2 for , I explained the ratings system and said that in good concience I couldn't sell it to her son as it is an extremely violent game. She got extremely angry and said she'd go to another store to buy it then!!<br>  <br>  We can't just stop violent games, then we'd have to stop violent movies and then violent art and so on. People should be able to make the correct choice, if there not given a choice you take away free will. Its only ignorant people like the lady I spoke of before who cause issues.|`|K3VhC7AMaa	Most definitely. Kids tend to be drawn to these things.|`|eeb898bd256e45f62aa2f9354d7b958baa	No. Parents need to control the kids access to the content of some games. The ESRB does an okay job, and with more and more retailers trying to curtail M-rated purchases they are. There's still going to  be the occasional whack-job that would have eventually gone crazy over something else anyways that will try to blame it on the game. But there is no shown correlation to gaming and actual violent behavior. The only things they've been able to show is desensetizing...which most kids already are from TV, Cartoons, Movies and even literature they're reading in school- like Lord of the Flies<br>  <br>  The person that gets screwed up from gaming was already screwed up. Gaming just happens to be this decade's Comic Book / Rock & Roll / Explicit Lyrics issue.|`|GbK3bldGaa	It should be up to parents to moderate what their kids play, <br>  I've played FPS games for years and i have never once thought about going and shooting people IRL, <br>  <br>  Why should i be punished because some idiot parents can't look after their own kids. <br>  <br>  People will always pick on stupid things to blame, Them kids apparently shot up columbine because they played quake and listened to marilyn manson, That's utter Bull...<br>  <br>  Games have ratings for a reason,|`|2PCksILraa	Yes. Parents should be fined for giving mature games to their kids, and shops should not allow minors to play such games. As a gamer I'm sick of my industry being threatened because some stupid parents decided that it'd be a good idea to give an 8 year old violent games.|`|mHQl6FmGaa	Unless the person is mentally ill, I don't think it's an issue what so ever.<br>  <br>  With most people, what goes in a video game stays in a video game.|`|6ss6vuopaa	I don't think so, there is no reason these games should be curved. If we don't have games to play violence in then there will be other outlets and possibly worse ones. I agree with the poster above who said humans crave violence, it's just something we want. <br>  <br>  If a game doesn't provide it then there will be something else to come along and this can be nearly guaranteed because without the gaming industry producing it someone will stand to profit from providing violence in some other format. *looks at the coliseum*  yeah...|`|KXeMtfe5aa	the way they are rate should introduced to every parent violent videos games only grow stronger over time and the gore of them just get bigger and bigger i belive we should just introduced the ratings of the game in every game and store before they buy it to the parents because beteween me and you games of that nature will never be gone.|`|kmeZBSlcaa	have you ever seen the back of a game how it has ratings? it has the ratings of <br>  <br>  A: for Adults<br>  <br>  M: for Mature <br>  <br>  T: for Teen <br>  <br>  E: for Everyone<br>  <br>  RP: Rated Pending<br>  <br>  So they put these ratings on here so that little children dont get consumed into these very bloody games and go do stuff like killing someone. because they think its right just becuase they saw it on a game.<br>  <br>  So really if a kid or child is playing a RATED M they shouldn't because u must be 18 or older. so i guess thats what there trying to do not that its being stopped because im only 16 and i cant buy games that are rated M so i get my mom to :)|`|G38ltd04aa	Nothing can be done...<br>  <br>  Society craves violence...it's in our blood...violence has always been around and will always be around...<br>  <br>  Whatever form of violence is available, people will find it.|`|wj4XhKUXaa	No. ESRB warns parents who will buy these games for kids that it has mature content. If those parents dont want to pay attention to that. thats their loss when their child does something stupid they saw in a video game.|`|u9dHyF1Caa	nothing should be done it is the responsability of the parents to make sure what games their kids have access to.<br>  <br>  guardian angel your an idiot!!!!|`|FKsxbgOSaa	No. Better to take it out on games instead of people|`|9acbdc61db12cb3cbf26e8c330814491aa	no games don't hurt people, people do
