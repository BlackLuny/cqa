I just wanted to know if UT has any good filmmaking courses. I know Ryerson and York have some.

20090309211015AA8oBus	Travel;United States;Chicago	Most overrated Chicago restaurants?	The most overrated & over-recommended Chicago restaurants?     Here’s my list, in order.  Write-ins are welcome…      1. Ed Debevic’s    Badly done Chicago street & diner food served to you by struggling improv actors.  Save a coupe of bucks and walk a block over to Portillo’s where they do street food the right way.  I’ve never met a real Chicagoan who has dined at this place more than once.      2. Lou Mitchell’s    Breakfast at Lou Mitchell’s doesn’t taste any different from any of the other hundred diners in the city, though it does feel a little more different coming out of my wallet.      3. The Billy Goat   Wander underneath Michigan Ave. and wade through a sea of homeless people for thin burgers, stale buns and no fries.  Chips. That sucks.        4. Signature Room on the 95th    I’m sure you’ve heard about how great the view is at the Signature Room.  But has anybody actually brought up the Signature Room in a sentence that starts like this: You know what restaurants serves the best food?        5. The Walnut Room   My wife & I bring our son to the Walnut Room every Christmas because it’s a Chicago tradition, not because the food is any good.

20090309212312AAtmxNq	Travel;Africa & Middle East;Egypt	The pyramids of Giza and who built them?	I recently learned alot about the great pyramids of Giza and the amazing facts associated with them. The pyramid lies on the longest line of latitude and longitude, the sides are exactly aligned with NSEW, etc.. Also there is a pyramid in ancient mayan civilization that shares the exact dimensions as the great pyramid of Giza. There is no way the egyptians built these but if not them who...I believe ET's. Also the pyramids line up with Orion's belt as of 10,000 BC so it makes me wonder if they were built around that time. On the history channel they showed an ancient city (forget the name) that dates back farther then we have the ability at least 17,000 BC. The most interesting thing with that is the stones used are the second strongest material on earth and they are perfect!, only diamond is stronger so basically the civilization that built them had to use diamond tipped equipment, highly unlikely. I think that earth had a great civilization inhabiting it that is lost throughout time. it has made me question my faith (catholic) because nothing that they teach you adds up. Any input?

I am in my early 30's).     I have no one to ask any questions- all i know is that my paternal grndmthr followed my grnfthr (american soldier) here after the war- they ended up with 4 boys + 3 girls before splitting.  Only my Aunt Aiko (deceased) had a Japanese name- the rest have american names.       I have one photo albulm that was my fathers.  Most of it is here in the US, but some older photos of my grandmother and her family are in the back.  on the back of the photos is Japanese writing, but no clues.  Most are photos of my grndmthr, usually with other women, in kimono on a stage looking as if they are posing mid dance.  The rest are indistinct photos of what looks like a beach, but the foreground is indistinct so the faces are in shadow (they are all dressed up in these too) .       Can anyone who either lives in Japan or has been there   tell me anything about where I might begin to look for information about these places or where i might be able to start my search?  I know it's not much to go on, but it's all I've got.   Up until recently I didn't have a real desire to know (my name is Danni, and you would not believe how many time I heard "Daniel-son, wax on, wax-off" and every other joke) because of the teasing I got.  So I'm a bit late to the party as they say.        Any advice or help would be much appreciated.

20090309213828AA63oG6	Travel;Canada;Toronto	What is the best way to drive from Vancouver to Toronto?	My friends and I want to plan a little road trip perhaps in the winter to do some snowboarding out west. We would generally consider flying from Detroit/Toronto, but to get to any ski places from major airports, we need to rent a car or take shuttles (we aren't 21, dont want to be restricted by bus schedules, plus cost as we're college/university students)      We plan on driving out to Whistler via the Canadian route, perhaps stopping at one or two mountains on the way (we had revelstoke, kelowna and golden in mind) and then finally whistler.       Its still early in planning, but we want to know whether its reasonable on a student budget, safety, and any other advice.      with the consumption of my car thats fully loaded with gear, i worked out gas to be about 500 dollars with current prices. How much are motels per night? Is it possible/legal to camp out instead of motels (pitch a tent)? I also drive a front wheel drive pontiac vibe with "all season" factory tires (and find i can sometimes get stuck in a snowy Guelph, ON), how dangerous would this be to take this car into the mountains in winter? do people even attempt this in the winter? I'm a good driver but I guess I cant predict how I will be after hours of driving.       what good advice can you guys pass on? obviously never made this trip, and we feel ts almost like a right of passage to make a trip like this. Or is doing this in winter a bit of a pipe dream? (December)      all (constructive) responses greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!

20090309210154AAvpSEe	Travel;Asia Pacific;Taiwan	Help with teaching in Taiwan?	In my 4 years here in Taiwan I have been both a teacher and a tutor for everyone from 5yr olds to 30~40 something business men/women and in that time I have never had a student ask me something that I couldn't easily find an answer to or figure a way around answering them (only if it is something that they shouldn't know ie 7-9yr old boys asking about sex).  But this time I had a group of 6th grade students (boys and girls)  ask me why do people wear underwear. Now this is the one thing that I have been asked that I didn't know what to say, and I have put them off for a few weeks now but they are persistent in getting an answer. Actually I am sort of curious my self.    1. Why do people wear underwear?    2. Is there a good answer to give them?    3. Is there some website or book about the history of underwear haha.    4. Has anyone else had any crazy questions from their students that stand out in your mind.      I have told them that they should ask their parents or grandparents, and tried passing them off on other teachers but they keep coming back to me for an answer.

I want to find a nice neighborhood that I will feel comfortable in as both a single minority and as a college educated professional. I know that there are plenty of places that have lots of singles like Astoria, LIC, etc. What are some other good, cultured neighborhoods in in Queens? How about Jamaica Estates? I want to be in a culturally diverse area with decent public transportation but not too expensive.

20090309221924AAKVtO3	Travel;Caribbean;Jamaica	I Want To Runaway!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!…	I have been having a lot of feeling about running away this past year. Everythings changed I lost all my friends, I feel alone. I think about suicide but I am a christian, and I believe I will go to hell. I may be depressed but I just want to get away from my mother. My father visits, in fact he's here now, but doesn't live with us. My mother is a decent person, who tries to be a good mother. But just her very voice makes me want to jump out a window, screaming. She hid me in the head today, and always talks to be about adult problems of hers, I just turned thirteen I'm a girl. I know if I runnaway I will most likely get raped murdered, and die. But I can't wait any longer to meet someone like me. Someone that was ment for me, and I know loves me more than there dogs, my mother. She has four dogs, and I am very jelous, she feeds them all organic feeds and thats why she hit me today. I just hate her... she is so obsessed with her looks. she just recently got a boob job and liposuction... and wants a tummy tuck and a face lift.. she crazy..I don't want my problems to be resolved with her. I just want to leave, I don't want to finish my education... I mean I am very intelligent... I know I'll never get a job. And if I runaway I'll get caught with my big ol' suitcase one block from my house. haha. But I just want a break from my life.. alone without anyone trying to harm me. I mean why is there such evil in the world that would want to hurt someone who just wants a break. I mean I can't take it. I am in 7th grade. I feel like a retard, right now. But I lost all my best friends. But I just want to go somewhere where I feel invinceable, maybe I should take karate before I run away... hmm that's a smart idea. But my mom loves me, but I don't love her. I actually want to go to juvinelle hall, I don't know why I'm a freak. But what are some teen help lines numbers? I need to talk with someone, desperatly. I HATE SCHOOL. But I've watched George Lopez he has a pretty nice house haha... yeah it's T.V I know. But I want to leave this god-awful place, I need help immediately it's late at night..  maybe nows my chance. I live in a suburb near chicago. Help me.. I mean I should suck it up, but i need a break, NOW.
