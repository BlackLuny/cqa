She had a phone interview with GreenCorps and now has been invited to interview in DC with them,.  This is the intern program they offer.  She would have to pay for her own flight and hotel.  Is this a good opportunity or not?  How many other college students are invited to interview.  She told me that only 35 positions are opened for this year to intern.  Please give me any input you have good or bad?  I will back her in any opportunity she wants, but I just want to be sure this is not some type of hyped up program.  Thank you.
