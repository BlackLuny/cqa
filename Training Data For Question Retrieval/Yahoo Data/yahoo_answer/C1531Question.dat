20090309233745AAkUe4V	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Are todays fundamentalist christians tomorrows amish?	What I mean by this is that you often notice that the extreme Fundamentalist Christians always seem to be extremely literal when it comes to that bible passage that says somethign like "be no part of the world" (I dont know the exact passage) and they practice being 'no part of the world' by home schooling their kids, only associating with other fundamentalists and not letting their kids socialise with non christians. They are against all modern culture, anti-rock music, anti-television(I have seen fundie sites devote whole pages to how evil televison is and how 'good christians' should not even have a TV in their house) The more extreme have a dress code and refuse to celebrate christmas, halloween, etc. So what Im wondering is do you think that in the future fundie's are going to set up seperate sommunities with seperate laws the same way the amsih have? The way the fundies are so extreme I can honestly imagine it happening. what are your thoughts?

20090225093340AA21BcG	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Theologans, answer this please?	"What does this verse mean?"       30 Lot and his two daughters left Zoar and settled in the mountains, for he was afraid to stay in Zoar. He and his two daughters lived in a cave. (They do not experience much of the spiritual realm, they do not see very much) 31 One day the older daughter (someone past the age of bearing fruit for the Lord. Someone old) said to the younger (the one who has supernatural spiritual insight into the kingdom of heave), "Our father is old, and there is no man around here to lie with us, as is the custom all over the earth. 32(There is not Lord to save them, as there is a Lord to save all of creation)  Let's get our father to drink wine and then lie with him and preserve our family line through our father." (preserve the labour and toil of their work, through their father. Let him believe falsely about the nature of the destiny that they are trying to acquire and change so that they can receive prophecy from the father)        33 That night they got their father to drink wine, and the older daughter went in and lay with him. He was not aware of it when she lay down or when she got up. (To lie with the father, is to disclose intimate secrets about this person that they want to capture. HE (Moab) did nto know when she laid down or when she got up.        34 The next day the older daughter said to the younger, "Last night I lay with my father. Let's get him to drink wine again tonight, and you go in and lie with him so we can preserve our family line through our father." 35 So they got their father to drink wine that night also, and the younger daughter went and lay with him. Again he was not aware of it when she lay down or when she got up.        36 So both of Lot's daughters became pregnant by their father. 37 The older daughter had a son, and she named him Moab [g] ; he is the father of the Moabites of today. 38 The younger daughter also had a son, and she named him Ben-Ammi [h] ; he is the father of the Ammonites of today.      I know the one of the sisters represent the "Wisdom" of God. Moab symbolises someone who is stingy about sharing God's grace with other people. He doesn't want to share it with others... Therefore the wisdom of God is represented by the Ammonite.

It's because I might have not understood them properly. So can you make these clear to me?      Qs.1.       John 9:39 -   39 Jesus said, "For judgment I have come into this world, so that the blind will see & those who see will become blind." [NIV Bible]      In John 8:15 it's said -    15 "You judge by human standards; I pass judgment on no one."      Previously Jesus mentioned that He came to earth for judgment. But in John 8:15 He mentioned that He passed judgment on no one. What did He exactly try to say?      Qs.2.      Mark 13:9-10 reads -    9 "You must be on your guard. You will be handed over to the local councils & flogged in the synagogues. On account of me you will stand before governors & kings as witnesses to them.   10 And the gospel must first be preached to all nations."      It seems to say that before all kinds of persecutions happen to the apostles of Jesus, the gospel of His kingdom must be preached to all nations. But the apostles didn't preach the gospel to every country before they were persecuted. So does it mean something different?       Please explain these      Thanks in advance

20090225093124AAtiBva	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	I am obsessed with her, is it sexual or what? (sorry it's long)?	I'm confused, help please!    She is my coworker, she is married with children, and about 10 years older than me. There is no reason why a straight girl like me should have any interest in her, but I'm OBSESSED with her!   Since the very first time I saw her I was instantly attracted, she is so cute and I just can't stop staring at her!   She is shy and introverted and when she talks with me she is very coy and gives me what appears to be some signs of flirting.   She wears her hair short like a man's, wears no makeup, and dresses masculine which makes me suspect that she's not completely straight, even though she is married to a man and has 2 pre-teen children.   Either way, why should I care, if I'm supposed to be straight!   Every time I see her I feel butterflies in my stomach and my hands and knees actually start shaking, when I speak to her I'm nervous and clumsy, but I'm always eager to see her, to speak to her, and I'll find any excuse to "accidentally" touch her.   What is happening to me? I feel like I have a major crush on her, but I don't think I'm gay or bi because I've never been attracted to another girl before and I'm in my late twenty's. If I was lesbian, shouldn't have I know it when I was younger?   I'm also confused because I find her physically attractive but I can't imagine her in sexual ways, like actually having sex with her, although I do imagine holding her, cuddling with her and even kissing her and I get excited thinking of it.   I think I'm obsessed because I can't stop thinking about her for even a minute and this has been going on now for about 7 months.   Is this a crush? Am I having lesbian feelings? Or is it simply admiration or adoration?   By the way, I haven't been attracted to men since high school, could I possibly be lesbian?  It would explain why I don't seem to like men and why I never had the desire to marry or have kids. Please, I need advice.

En otros paÃ­ses se puede beber alcohol a cualquier hora del dÃ­a -?Te acuerdas con esta ley? ?CuÃ¡les son las ventajas y desventajas?      I donât agree with this law as not only will the people be able to drink alcohol but they may be able to purchase it for more hours in the day. This will lead to more noise, rubbish and illnesses related to alcohol. It could also increase the levels of alcoholism in the country.      d. ?Crees que es malo beber y conducir? ?Por quÃ© lo hacen muchas personas?   Yes, drinking and driving is terrible as it causes accidents. A lot of people have to live with the effects of drinking and driving every day of their lives such as paralysis, burns and the loss of a loved one or family member. A lot of people drink and drive because they have no other way to get home or they think that they arenât as drunk as they actually are but one drink impairs driving.       e. ?QuÃ© sabes del botellÃ³n en Espa?a?   BotellÃ³n is when young people meet up in the street to drink alcohol and get drunk. This tradition in Spain happens on a large scale and most think that it is a bad idea. It creates a lot of noise and rubbish but also a lot of business for local supermarkets selling cheap alcohol.

20090225094231AAd73QO	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Wiccans: Do you beleive in the Three Fold Law (details inside) ?	I'm sure you've heard of Doreen Valiente? The former High Priestess of the deceased Gerald Gardner and famous Witch? Well this Queen of Witchcraft said something in an interview I think may stun or at best interest you. This is a direct quote ... I'll post a link to the page as well.      DV: I don't believe this stuff about the threefold return, you know. I've always been very skeptical about that, but I'm a lot more skeptical than I used to be. The older I get, the more skeptical I get. I don't believe in all sorts of things that I used to believe in.           FH: Where do you think the threefold idea came from?       DV: I think old Gerald cooked it up in one of his rituals, and people took it terribly literally. Personally, I've always been skeptical about it because it doesn't seem to me to make sense. I don't see why there has to be one special law of karma for Witches and a different one for everybody else. I don't buy that. But there's an awful lot of things I don't buy.       Source:  http://www.earthspirit.com/fireheart/fhd...       Now this is coming from a VERY experienced Witch and author of the Craft. So I ask you this: Do you still believe in the Three Fold Law ... after a wise woman like Doreen Valiente came to the realization that it's not a real Law at all?

I go to a public university and it is having a "sex fair" next week. The flier read that it is a "sex fair to get everyone ready for spring break. We will be handing out contraceptives to get ready for the sexual activity of spring break." My argument and problem with this is not only is abstinence being left out, but promiscuity is being encouraged by the fact that they are saying lets get ready for all of the sex everyone is going to have. In addition, I don't understand why they wouldn't do this year around. Those who sin don't wait up until spring break. How do you feel about this?

20090225071758AAiqoRC	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Spiritually speaking: when I asked a couple questions about anthropogenic global warming last night...?	I made my statement clear that I'm skeptical humans are the result of the change in the climate, said that I was all-for going green, and said there was no concrete proof that humans caused the change anyway.  I also mentioned that temperature increases CO2, not the other way around; there's a 400 year time lag in the graphs.  And I mentioned that yes, I knew the temperature is rising overall, but that I didn't thik humans were necessarily the cause.      Now, instead of getting intelligent answers or sources for scientific proof that humans caused any changes, I was insulted by most of the answerers.  Now, why would that be?  They claimed that I ignored science, too, when it was science that changed my mind about AGW in the first place ('cause I used to be a strong believer in AGW).
20090225054411AAJ3WP7	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	The tower of Babel - division of language - why?	I want to open the question by stating that I am ignorant when it comes to the Bible, this is something I am currently rectifying by intensive reading through many versions of the Bible and unfortunately I have been stumped on a few issues, name that of the question I have posed.      It loosely states in both the King James and American Bible that God saw the unification of the people was leading to man being too powerful (powerful being evil I'm not sure), and as such it was 'decided' (and I'm trying to be careful in putting it in that fashion) that a division of language was necessary to diversify man to possibly reduce 'evil'.         What are your thoughts?      David      ps- I would just like to add that I am not attacking the Bible, I'm not trying to be sceptical about religion, I merely seek to understand

20090225054142AALAKIE	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Will I really go to Hell for something I simply cannot believe? How is this free will?	The Bible says that God gives us free will to choose whether or not to believe and accept that Jesus is the Son of God and was sent to Earth to die for our sins. But can anyone honestly tell me that they can force themselves to believe something?       Imagine someone gives you a book that millions of people claim is infallible and divinely inspired. In this book, it states that every human being on Earth is surrounded by 12 purple unicorns every second of every day, but that these unicorns are invisible to humans. It also states that if you "choose" not to believe that this invisible purple posse exists, you'll spend eternity shoveling unicorn feces in 120 degree heat. Would you believe it?       Given the current available evidence, I simply cannot force myself to believe the claims of the Bible. So, how exactly has God given me free will to choose my eternal fate? You either believe something or you don't. You can't "choose" to believe. Sure, I can go through the motions. I can pray, go to church, tell myself over and over again that I accept Jesus Christ as my savior, but if I don't actually believe it, what's the point?

He tried a lot of pills and pot, to it a slave became;        he needed dough, to buy, you know, to feel on top again.â           âWhich leads me, now, to tell you, how, this man before you stands         accused of killing for a âfixâ, to still his trembling hands.         For a little loot this man did shoot another human being;         He left him dead, and this man fled, afraid of someone seeing.â

How do I know if the Jews gave up when Jesus walked the earth while the Jews were under Roman occupation.

Why do we have to accept the story as told in such a confusing about a man who claims to be the light, who says he came down from heaven, he and God are one, and calls himself Morning star. This is all so vicious I can not see why there are so many Christians who claim all non Christians will go to hell and burn for ever in a lake of fire no matter how good they are by a loving  God, And all evil will go to heaven as sonâs of God by just believing in that one.

I live in Reynosa in Mexico in the border; the city has over a million people of which 95% work in a factory. Unlike what the average American might think, more than half of these companies are owned by Asian companies, not American companies. These include LG, Panasonic, and others. All the managers of these companies are Asian. The few Asians in Reynosa are usually rich executives. The USA is even allowed to intervene in Mexico if something ever happens to them, so not even the mop would ever do anything to an Asian. Most people here see an Asian person and treat them like royalty assuming they are one the people bringing work to the city. However I have this Asian friend, he came here knowing the situation here. Heâs a drunk. Heâs been caught 3 times drunk driving by the police, since heâs Asian, the police are too afraid to take him in, and just let him go.      Isnât this wrong? Heâs just a poor drunken Chinese-American. Should he get any special treatment?

20061223084843AAFX4Yt	Society & Culture;Languages	Ecco il testo che ho problemi nel tradurre in italiano non letterale?	Active language enables the writer to slow down events effectively. Lawrence manipulates the reader's sensations by using highly descriptive language and emphasizing the constant motion of settings and actions as they occur. The distortion of time is achieved by means of slowing down actions and events, enabling the process and its implications to take precedence over the act itself. Thus, in "The Crucifix Across the Mountains," Lawrence uses the defamiliarizing technique of time distortion transforms the simple task of gathering hay by incorporating details and active language.By slowing his prose down so precisely, Lawrence recreates the simple act of lifting hay, adding an element of importance to the movements and sensations involved. This slowing down of actions has an important overall effect on the reader because it emphasizes the centrality of the senses and begins to inform us of Lawrence's admiration for the Italian emphasis on sensation and emotion. Descriptions such as "closing round itself" and "active flesh" create a continual movement on multiple levels. Contrasts in the description serve as sensual cues for the reader, emphasizing sensation over literal action.

I am a Christian wife who struggles more than anything in submitting to my husband.  I just read all the passages about women submitting to their husbands and this is something that I know that I HAVE to do.  But, I am afraid that if I totally surrender to him then that will open the door for him to treat me even more like a slave.  And submitting to your husband means that you have to submit to them in the bedroom,too.  Don't get me wrong I like to have sex with him, but does that mean that I have to have sex EVERY SINGLE TIME that he wants to?  You know as well as I do that men want it at the most inoppurtune times.  I love my husband and marriage and have prayed about this.  But, completely submitting to him seems a little scary.  But, I know from scripture that I can also bring him to the Lord if I do this.  ( He is not a christian)  I know this is what the Lord wants.  Can you give me some encouragement or some advice or something?  Thanks.

20090225090518AA2o9fU	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	How is it possible to truly love someone without actually having met them face to face?	Love is a powerful concept.  If I love someone, I'm willing to die for them, even take a bullet for them somewhere other than the buttocks.      It is like respect in that it must be grown over time and as the fruit of active communication and interactions with another party.  As you get to know someone, get to see the person they are and how they react to things that life throws at them, you one day decide "Hey, I love you!"      Some claim with passion that they love God, Jesus, Allah, and other members of divinity which in fact may or may not exist.  Furthermore, this love is very one-sided, it seems; for while the person declaring their undying love is making a great effort to make this love known to the world (to the collective facepalm of many secular groups), the recipient of said love remains curiously silent, or seems to send messages either using telepathy or using an elaborate encryption system involving burning bushes and bright lights.

20070105032612AAJqCZW	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Can someone help me understand my issue better?	I have outer body experiences 3-4 times every night. Sometimes I travel somewhere in the world that I never been before, and sometimes I am in my room. When I am somewhere else, I see people that I never seen before and I can communicate with them. When they touch me or when I touch an object around me, it feels as though I am touching it when I am awake. I am still able to think, smell, hear, see, touch, and taste. The only difference from being awake is that I have to use a little more force to move around and focus my eyes.When I am having an experience in my room, I feel my entire body tingling and my eye lids feel heavy. When I open my eyes, I can see everything around me, even what is on television. Sometimes I can see spirits in the room and hear different sounds like plastic rattling or the toilet flushing. I am able to smell different scents and conversate with the spirits and if they touch me, I can feel it. I always remember their faces and what they say to me. When I move my arms and legs, I can feel them exiting my body, but sometimes when I try to move, I can't move at all. The only thing I can do is open my eyes and I can feel my body tingling and see spirits, hear noises, and smell scents in my room. When I am having an experience where I travel, I am aware of everything around me. I can always move freely but I have to try hard to focus my eyes. I can feel someones touch and conversate with them. In a dream, you can make objects appear and dissapear if you want, make people say and do what you want them to, and go where you want. During an outer body experience, it is impossible to do that. Everything is real and it can't be controlled. You will see things as they are and have real conversations. You can only control yourself. I use to panic during my experiences but now I am use to it. I am not scared to see or speak to spirits but I am uncomfortable when they touch me. I learned that when I am somewhere around the world and I try to snap out of the experiance, I somehow end up in my bed still having the experience and able to hear my tv and see everything around. If I panic and try to move, thinking that if I will wake up, I don't. When I relax and close my eyes, I can wake up from it. I have to wait for the tingling feeling to go away and force myself sit up. When I do, everything in my room, including what was on tv, is exactly how I saw it during my experiance. They only thing different is that the spirits and extra noises are gone and I feel really sleepy. If my eye lids feel heavy when I am awake, I have to try not to lay down because if I do, I am going to instantly get pulled back into the experiance and the spirits and extra noises will return. When this happens, I relax and force myself to sit up. After I am awake, I stand up and walk around. About a minute later, i feel normal again.

If my biological father wants closer then heâs obviously not close to God right?    How do I justify that what Iâm doing is wrong IF Iâm okay with it?   My mother has raised us and remarried to give us a normal/peaceful up bringing just after she left my father many years ago. I have two brothers (late-20âs) and our biological father is trying to get to know us, now that his health is in jeopardy...so he says! I saw the horrible beatings/abuse my mother went through when I was six but even after all that, my mother feels compassion for our father. My brothers and our mother know exactly how I feel about our father. Our father is attempting to speak to our mother through my brothers and I have NOT allowed it, because itâs hurt my mother (emotionally) each time. My mother tells me that disrespecting my father over the phone is making matters worst but I tell her, if so then he hasn'tât changed like he claims! In many ways Iâve sheltered and protected my mother from her pain as I grew older. My STEP-DAD is the entire father I need and Iâm happy.

20061221091239AADpU9k	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	The hatered still lives?	My lst question was why hate still is so strong between christians and muslims. towards anything diffrent.      THEY BOTH have their bad points.   Christianity has been responsible for the death of 9 million pagans, 4 million muslims, and 2 million jews in the "holy crusade".   1 mil away from 4 haullacausts.      Islam has been a founder of middle eastern terrorism, all terror cells base their acts on Allah and their faith. Terrorism causes murder.      You both have your bad point, accept them and stop holding such hate.      It makes me so sad to see people acts just the same, and yet say they're better and go to the grave with that "were still better than you" attitude, its like another for a prejudice, close to racism.      Im not saying they dont have good points to, yes they both have points and times when they express love, kindess, etc.   But when you hold hatered at the same time   Your good deeds mean nothing. you negate it.      Out with your hatered, in with love.

I love patent leather high heels too. Whenever a pretty lady comes into the store, she sometimes is wearing high heel shoes. And when I go to assist her by measureing her feet, I get extemely horny, especially if she is wearing pantyhose and her toe nails are painted. And if the shoes she slips off are patent leather, I take them into the back room and get in a few quick sniff's. Very intoxicating aroma! Sometimes I'll even lick the insides of the shoes, then bring them back to her. It's fun to see the look of bewilderment of their face as they feel something wet or sticky on the bottoms of their feet,,,heee hee

I keep trying to not think of it and I'm trying to ignore it but I can't help it. I used to like girls, but now I'm turned on by men aswell. I think some people will tell me it's one of those teenage things but I don't think it is, because I have ... looked at stuff on the internet and I'm pretty sure I know what turns me on now.       But the thing is I can't imagine myself being with a man for the rest of my life when I'm older. I want to marry a woman and have our own children, but I have these sexual feelings towards men so I don't know what to do. I still like girls but not as much as men. Maybe I'm bisexual. I haven't really figured that out yet. I don't act like a girl, I don't have one of those voices and I don't dress in pink like they show gay people do on tv.       So what do I do? How do I decide what to do with my life?

20070429091315AAHx9qq	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christianity, No Sense At All ?	In every detail concerning the birthplace, birth date, and the death of Jesus, the 4 gospels are in complete contradiction. It is not agreed whether Jesus was born 3 B.C. or 6 A.D. In "The New Archaeological Discoveries" by C.M. Cobern, D.D., it is stated that recent excavations definitely place Jesusâ birth between 9 B.C. and 6 B.C., and his death on April 3, A.D. 33, making him between 39 and 42 when he died, meaning he was nearly 40 when he began his ministry of one or three years, though his virgin birth was announced by an angel and a star.   The dates and hour of the crucifixion do not agree in the gospels. The names of the 12 apostles are differently given in Matthew x and Luke vi. According to John, Jesus was not at the Last Supper -- at least the three Synoptic gospels say that he celebrated the Passover and was crucified the day after, while John, though describing a supper, states that Jesus was crucified the day before the Passover.   You call this God Inspired ? Crazy !

During the past couple of years I have developed a friendship with a man from Finland; and in the course of this friendship have also gotten to know many more Fins. I'm embarrassed to ask him this outright, as I don't think he knows he's doing it, but fairly often in sentences he sort of gasps in air. Like catching ones breath.   I assumed he may have some health problems with his lungs as he is a senior and smokes a lot. I met a lady friend of his recently, and while driving her 3 hours distant, she did the same thing. Tonight at a party, another Fin was doing the same "gasp". I see a pattern! haha Is this something in the speaking of Finnish that is common, or do I just know elderly smoking with lung disease?.

Nell'amena puntata di A sua immagine di domenica 4 febbraio:    http://www.asuaimmagine.rai.it/R2_pagina...    Mons. Francesco Anfossi si Ã¨ interrogato lungamente, dice lui, sulla possibilitÃ  di avere figli tramite l'inseminazione artificiale. Interpellato sull'argomento si Ã¨ espresso dicendo che le persone che non possono avere figli non dovrebbero cercarli in maniera innaturale e contro la volontÃ  del signore, ma piÃ¹ che altro interrogarsi sul perchÃ¨ dio ha scelto per loro quella strada. Adesso, a parte la continua intromissione sul discorso della natura, discorso sul quale la chiesa Ã¨ stata sempre  di una competenza a dir poco fallimentare, procurandosi perÃ² di bruciare chiunque si mostrasse piÃ¹ ferrato; mi chiedo se si puÃ² essere cosÃ¬ cattivi, arroganti e intolleranti verso una persona che ha degli impedimenti fisiologici di concepimento, Ã¨ accettabile che si discrimini ancora tra chi Ã¨ scelto da dio per proseguire la stirpe gloriosa e chi invece si deve..

Dopo averlo visto      Credo che non ci siano parole per giustificarlo.      Come possono alcuni politici cattolici essere a favore dell'aborto e nutrirsi del Corpo di Cristo?      Come possono alcuni medici e donne abortire e dire che non c'era nulla di male, anzi hanno fatto pure del bene a farlo?      Come possono uccidere e dimenticare?      C'Ã¨ forse un guadagno da parte di medici?   E se fosse anche tutte le ricchezze del mondo: come  pensare di uccidere per arricchirsi?

Ich bin entsetzt und schockiert, denn als ich heute mein erstes Gespr?ch mit einem Pfarrer hatte, erfuhr ich in diesem Gespr?ch, das sehr angenhem verlief, unter anderem, da? Maria, die Mutter Jesu Christi, erst 14 Jahre alt gewesen sein soll, als Josef sie ehelichte.      Meine Frage ist nun, ob es tats?chlich historisch belegt ist, da? sie bei der Ehelichung noch ein Kind war?      DafÃ¼r, da? die damaligen Juden eine ?u?erst rigide Moralvorstellung hatten (Ablehnung der Homosexualit?t, kein Ehebruch, "Hurerei" u.s.w.), finde ich P?dophilie (die soweit ich wei? eher bei den Heiden vorkam) nun wirklich g?nzlich unpassend.

20070301134532AAwRXvc	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Is there any way to question God or religion without being arrogant?	The word "arrogant" is a tool of intimidation amongst the religious. We all detest arrogant people, or are trained to anyway.       ARROGANCE is almost like the word "pedophile", in that, the moment someone slaps it upon you, know one else cares to examine whether it fits, the stigma or perception is immediate.      When we question God or religion, in front of the religious, how can we do this without being arrogant, after all, what more arrogant that questioning God!      Theres simply no way to do it with out being arrogant. If I smile and talk kindly, I am condescending, the worst form of arrogance. The major religions all have verses that condemn disbelievers and engender hatred for them.      In Islam, to be called "arrogant" is almost like a death sentence, your biding your time. Its a word of intimidation, thus wiser people hesistate to open their mouths and the circle of ignorance perpetutates.

20070430051442AAyZey1	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why are physical idols so hated by some religions?	I ask this because Hindus and Buddhists are often accused of worshipping idols and of ignoring the true power of an Almighty Being.      According to my readings Hindus worship idols but recognise the power of unseen entities/ a single greater entity. Buddhists don't specify the existence of a creator in their belief system but will bow down before Buddah, whose ideals they respect.      Are the stone statues merely physical symbols- concrete tangible references to recognised ideals and tools to help a person focus? If this is the case, then surely a Muslim who prays towards the Kaaba or a Christian who prays at the foot of a crucifix can understand the reasoning towards having a point of ocular reference to help focus the mind.      Why then, are religions that use these tools so denigrated by monotheists? And couldn't polytheism be understood as the recognition of the facets of human character and emotion  respected as powerful processes and given deitic identities.

20090227111543AA7mjAg	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Dealing with an alcoholic...?	My fiance is an alcoholic. He was attending AA for a while and insisted that he's not drinking hard liquor anymore. But I'm catching him in little lies about it and finding whiskey bottles hidden in different places around the house. We are expecting a baby in May and he wants to get married as soon as possible but I've decided against this. I don't want to call off the engagement (I'd rather work things out the best I can for our child's sake), but I am going to lay down some guidelines. If he really wants to marry me, I believe if he will do everything he can to make it work.      1. He must be attending AA meetings every week.   2. He absolutely cannot drink ANY alcohol (including beer and wine).   3. He must continue this for at least a year before I will consider marriage.   4. I want at least 6 months of premarital counseling before saying "I do".      The only problem I have is, how will I know if he's truly being faithful in his endeavor? I'll know if he's attending the meetings, but what if he's sneaking drinks? I can't always tell when he's been drinking. And how should I go about telling him this? I know he's going to be upset. He's a great man in every other way but I'm not going to settle for less! I do really love him but I believe marriage is for life and I'm trying to be very careful about my decision. Please provide your input.

20090227104935AAyDN43	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What is Your View on what is about to happen on Our World?	I see 2 Major Global Catastrophes, almost back to back. The Earth slipping back to its proper spin. And then a body from outer space hitting the Earth.   Which will cause explosions of energy. Flowing outward, and an influx, flowing back. Which will open the doors to other realities.   I also see a time when many souls will be elevated to Positions of Authority. While others are demoted. And some souls getting trapped in negative realities.   EarthLife will continue after this. With "evil" again coming into play for a Time. Before the Resurection of the "Dead", Lost Souls. And The White Throne Judgement.       Anthony Silva   USA

Because in Hebrews it says those who fall away can never return to repentance.

I was just thinking about it today and it kind of confuses me!
20090227111358AAGAAby	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	From an LDS standpoint, is this wrong?	I'm 14. Recently I've been having a little issue. There's this boy, and it seems like I'm always thinking of him. There isn't a day that goes by that he doesn't at least cross my mind, and sometimes when I'm trying to get him out of my head, I find my mind wandering again. I never think about inappropriate things related to him, but still I know that we aren't supposed to date or be concerned about dating until at least 16. It's just that he is almost perfect! I try to stop thinking about him, but it's hard.      From a Mormon point of view, would this be considered a sin? I'm not really sure if it would be considered wrong or not. I never even see this boy, but still I feel kind of guilty that I think about him all the time. It's not that I'm boy crazy, because he's the only one I've ever felt this way about.      Thanks.

20090227090315AAZZH9a	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What guideline should we use (if not religious beliefs) to teach our children some sort of moral code?	For example: Most religions would say that all premarital sex is wrong.   Most people don't agree with this (or at the very least don't practice what they preach)   But, most parents(therapists)would agree that even if its ok for a young person to experience some premarital experience,  they would not think it healthy(physically or mentally) to say have hundreds or thousands of sexual experiences before trying to settle into marriage...my question I guess is if you don't use centuries old advice, what should you use?

It has one of the shoddiest histories of record keeping of any book ever written.      Someone is wrong.      And the christians are constantly arguing that skepticism is morally deficient.      Instead of arguing about whether or not it is "moral" to be religious, should more emphasis be placed on WHICH version is right FIRST?      Defend which version of the bible is right BEFORE you claiming it literal truth AND explain why all other translations are wrong.      Seems to to me that if something is true and of utmost importance it would be better preserved in its original form.

20090227104428AA8NnHR	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Atheists, what are your views on the information stored in DNA?	I posted a similar question not too long ago, but didn't get many answers. There aren't many people in the science section and I would like to know what atheists think?      1) DNA is not merely a molecule with a pattern; it is a code, a language, and an information storage mechanism.       2) All codes are created by a conscious mind; there is no natural process known to science that creates coded information.       3) Therefore DNA has to have been designed by a mind or entity.      But since most atheists don't believe in creation (or maybe all don't. I'm kinda new to this stuff) then how do you explain the DNA matter? If the coded info in DNA has to have a designer or creator of some sort, and it exists, then how can you believe that there is no creator?      Just curious? Any facts would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.

20081018053541AARMYDy	Society & Culture;Etiquette	Was this woman from another planet or something?	Last week when I was on my lunch break at work, I went outside the main entrance of my work place (a supermarket) to make a phone call. As I was talking on the phone, this woman who I'd say was in her 50's who seemed to be on her phone dragged her trolley and stood very close behind me talking very loud on her phone. So I did nothing and just moved away and carried on talking, but she dragged her trolley and followed me really closely and talking louder and louder. I felt really uncomfortable for some reason. I didn't ignore her or nothing before because I dont work on the shopfloor so she wouldn'tve called me for something. So I turned to her and asked: "Is there a problem maddam?". And she ignored me and carried on talking loudly right next to me. So I just finished my conversation and went back to the staff room.      WTF?

20081114213527AAzy5Yh	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	One of the biggest misconceptions of Islam?	Is how people think that we made up our OWN God and decided to call him "Allah." We believe in God. Period. No "holy-trinity" concept. No three combined into one. There is only ONE. But in reality this is the same God that people of all other religions pray to. Well... not ALL other religions -- but most of the monotheistic ones.      So why do we call him Allah [SWT]? Because that is the ARABIC word for "God." Arabic is important because it is the language the Quran is written in. Our last prophet [pbuh] spoke this language.      I hope this clears things up for some people. I'm not looking to insult anyone and if any wackjobs try to be funny on here, I'll just report them.       ****** So MY QUESTION IS did you already know that?

I don't fit into the "normal playgroups" and even don't feel as though I fit in at the church.  I don't want to change myself either just to perfectly fit into a peg at one place or another.

IDK if you have ever heard the testimonies of people from people of other religions, or even another type of christianity (like say Mormons), but I assure you they are just as powerful as the ones you may hear in church. These people convey intense emotions, and you can tell that in their hearts they are fully convinced that their beliefs are right, and that they are in accordance with the will of god(s).       What do you think to yourself when you hear these testimonies? Maybe, "pssht, they are just deluding themselves with this emotional-high"? Or maybe, "the devil has decieved these people"? Or what? And how can you be sure that these things aren't happening to you? It seems like these people have just as much faith in what they believe as you do on what you believe.

I believe that I'm supposed to be and going to be a Gospel singer, but there are alot of obstacles in the way, like not having money for voice lessons, not having money for studio time, etc. Is this normal? This is something I really want to do, and I don't want to give up, but its sooo hard, especially since I have no other financial\emotional support to do it.       I always look for opportunities to sing, like a talent show that I have coming up. I have a band and singers. Do I just need to be patient?
20081104003947AAkheaI	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What do you do or say when a group of pagans, atheists, or homosexuals make fun and ridicule christians?	What if they bully a christian? Do you think that they have the right to do that because they are victimized by society?  Do you think that certain allowances must be made in order to even out the playing field?  Why is that when a 1000 people kill or murder, it is more justified than when only 10 people kill or murder? Why does the rights of the minority have to trump the rights of the majority?

When in fact pagans in history including vikings and other Celtic pagans participated in Slave trade.  They too killed mercilessly people who were not like them.

20090227095204AA26X0S	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Catholics, if even Hegesippus said James is Jesus' Brother, why don't you believe?	Hegesippus, who lived immediately after the apostles, gives the most accurate account in the fifth book of his Memoirs. He writes as follows: "James, the brother of the Lord, succeeded to the government of the Church in conjunction with the apostles. He has been called the Just by all from the time of our Saviour to the present day"         So he even says that James is the Brother of the Lord, Paul says that James is the Brother of the Lord, Josephus says that James is the brother of Jesus, who was called the Christ.          So why don't you believe when the only person in all of Christian history who was called the brother of the Lord, is James??

20080729114405AACMZ8a	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why do people want to keep faith and fact at two ends of a spectrum?	Nobody can have faith in something that has not already provided some sort of fact/experience. Even "blind faith" has to do with some (even remotely) viable reason to believe in a particular, predictable result. That's also called "life". We take chances based on our experiences and our trust of certain things and predictable outcomes.       I have a relationship with Jesus Christ because He saved my life five times. The facts being my experiences and my prayerful interactions. He has proven Himself to be the same Spirit whose Word is the Bible. It has to do with how what is communicated in prayer or in spirit that is consistent with His Word.

Being the content of the Bible so symbolic, cryptic, ambiguous, confusing, metaphorical and full of parallelism and analogies... why is it still taught to children as being literal? I went to a Catholic school for 4 years (8yo - 12yo) when I was a child, and nobody ever mentioned a word about the symbolic character of the Scriptures.    I mean, being the Bible the bringer of so much raged and heated debate, and being considered to be the most cryptic and ambiguous book ever, is it the appropriate thing to make a kid read?

I decided to be honest with myself about how I really think from now on.   When I say think, I mean true, original, honest thoughts, not regurgitated from a pastor or parents etc.      I know there are people out there just like me.      I refuse to pretend to believe something that I don't just because the church says I should.       God can't show me right from wrong unles I am honest with myself and with him.      So...Here it goes, Why would God create man just to have him burn in hell for all eternity if he loves us so. That isn't love. It's actually kinda sadistic. And the whole concept of eternal punishment goes against the Bibles teachings and concepts about forgiveness.      It's like saying , "You have 1 life to love, don't get it all right and u burn forever. But I love you my child. "      I don't think that is who God is.

By killing the tree he automatically made it so no one else who went hungry would have the chance to eat from that tree. That is what I call immoral.

I even accept the slight possibility of one of the many different religious texts that exist in this world being true, or at least to some degree.  I simply don't understand how someone can limit any possibility in regards to our existence without being able to prove it.

20081023214925AAM7oZC	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Does the Big Bang and Creation go hand and hand?	No. The Biblical account of creation as found in Genesis is amazingly accurate. Genesis 1:1-3 states "In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. And the earth was without form, and void; and the darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. And God said, "Let there be light."  It is well established scientifically that the universe did come into existence in a tremendous explosion known as the Big Bang. Scientists believe that the Big Bang occurred between 13 and 17 billion years ago. In other words there was a moment of creation. Scientific evidence for the Big Bang includes observations that the universe around us is still expanding and distant galaxies are receding away from us (and from each other). Another piece of evidence is that we can detect light waves left over from the Big Bang. These light waves are microwaves and are collectively called cosmic microwave background radiation. Scientists believe that before the Big Bang, there was literally nothing; no space, no time, nothing. This is consistent with Genesis 1:2 that the earth was without form, and void. Furthermore it is interesting that the word "firmament" or "expanse" in Genesis 1:6 comes from the Hebrew word for expansion. Indeed the universe is still expanding and started expanding at the Big Bang. So the Big Bang does NOT contradict the Bible; it confirms it.      Further in Genesis 1, it says that God created plants on the third day (Gen. 1:11-13) and on the fourth day he created lights in the sky such as the sun, moon, and stars. This appears to contradict current scientific thinking that the sun, moon, and stars were created before plants. However, it may be that the account given in this part of the first chapter of Genesis is from the point of view of an observer on earth. The early atmosphere was probably opaque and it may not have been possible to see the sun, moon and stars for quite some time, just as when it is overcast, we can't see the sun even though it is daytime. Plants could have flourished eons before the sky cleared up and the atmosphere changed.      I got this from a site and do you think this could be possible?

Today we find in the Arabian Peninsula, the Arabs who used to be impoverished herders of camels and sheep, are competing in building the tallest tower blocks.       The Mosques would be like palaces. This is clearly the case, even though the Prophet ordered simplicity in the houses of Allah, the mosques have become more and more fantastic, with golden domes, marbled floors, lavish carpets and chandeliers.       Disappearance of trustworthiness, so much so that one would only be able to say: "I know a trustworthy person in such-and-such town."       The increase in killing, so that the one who kills does not know why he killed, and the one killed does not know why he was killed. I was recently sent an article from the Washington Post about the rise of gang warfare. Part of the initiation ceremony was for a new gang member(some times as young as eleven) to shoot someone. The second highest cause of death from fifteen to thirty five in the US are gun related. The massacre of civilians in the Vietnam War by American troops who had little idea why they were there, and the increase of such conflicts, is further illustration of the fulfillment of this prophecy. As are the rise of insane mass murders, of children killing children, such as Jamie Bulger.    The increase of the use of riba (usury/interest) so that no one will able to escape being tainted by it. This clearly the state of the world economy today.       The enemies of the Muslims dividing the Muslim's wealth and lands between them, the Muslims abandoning jihad, and concerning themselves only with the worldly matters. We have already mentioned this.       The increase of literacy.       The decrease of religious knowledge due to the disappearance of scholars.       The increase of musical instruments, and the Muslims making it lawful even though the Prophet has forbidden them.       The increase of sexual promiscuity, and new diseases that people had not herd of before spreading amongst them as a consequence of that. This is clear, with the arrival of AIDS, and other previously unheard of viruses.       Appearance of Dajjals (liars), each claiming to be a Messenger of Allah, while Muhammad is the last messenger. There are numerous examples of this, starting with Musailima, who arose in the time of the Prophet, just before his death, to more modern liars such as Elija Muhammad, founder of the Black American racist movement "The Nation of Islam", and India's pretender Gulam Ahmed of Qadian.       Nakedness of women while still being dressed.       The drinking of wine becoming common, and the Muslims making it lawful by calling it another name.       Shouting in the mosques.       The worst and most ignorant will become leaders and they will be oppressors.       A man will obey his wife and disobey his mother, and treat his friends kindly and shun his father.       Men will wear silk and gold, and the making of it lawful by the Muslims even though the Prophet had forbidden it for the men of his 'Ummah (nation).       People will abandon the religion for a small worldly gain, and keeping to the religion will be like holding two hot coals.       So these are just some of the numerous prophecies of Muhammad, that have clearly come true, and some have been fulfilled in this age in which we live, all adding weight to the evidence in favour of his claim.       The Qur'an also provides accurate knowledge of the past. This is also information which Muhammad was unable to receive except from Allah. Some examples of this are:       The Qur'an mentions about the ark of Noah: "The Ark came to rest upon Mount Judi" (11:44). Recent archeological research has discovered a boat shaped object with exactly the same dimensions as those of the Ark on Mount Judi. The Bible claims that the Ark came to rest twenty miles away on the Mountains of Ararat. This is not possible, since these mountains are a recent geological formation, and did not exist at the time of Noah. The Qur'an also refers to the flood as a localised event, destroying only Noah's people. The dates and time offered by the Bible for the flood, and its claim that it was a world wide cataclysm, has been proven false by all archeological evidence.       The Qur'an describes the ruler of Egypt being addressed as "King" in the time of Joseph, whilst Moses addresses the ruler as "Pharaoh". This is a small but telling accuracy, for in the time of Joseph the rulers were from the Hyk

I just read yet again, for the zillionth time now, some atheist parroting a certain well-known atheist whose definition of who's an atheist contradicts the well-known definition of "atheism".      Is this definition wrong???      Main Entry:a?the?ism?   ?[ey-thee-iz-uhm]  Show IPA   ânoun   1. the doctrine or belief that there is NO God.   2. disbelief in the existence of a supreme being and BEINGS.      Yet, the atheists who monkey a certain well-known atheist say "Dumm...you're an atheist too because you don't believe in this obscure god, and that obscure god that I only know the names of because I hang on every word of a famous atheist who uses this nonsensical argument everywhere he goes."      So tell me, can someone be an atheist and believe in GOD too or not?      Make sense, you people of superior logic and intellect.  Please make sense.

I would like to know if you would support marriage in the case of consenting adult incest. After all, the argument to support homosexual marriage, that they are consenting adults, can also be applied here.      I do not support either, but I am interested in learning what differentiates the two in your minds. If you support one and reject the other on moral grounds, then doesn't your arguments against those who object, on moral grounds, to whichever one of them you accept hypocritical?       I would like to learn your opinion.

In Heaven, if God is going to lobotomize the sh#t out of you so much that all your human behaviors and human emotions are gone and you are nothing more than just another one of his perfect little angel mind control slaves with no freewill, then what's the point of having a mansion in Heaven anyway? You can't enjoy mansions and riches if you're not human and can't feel emotions and indulgence, if everything about you in Heaven will have no individuality, if your mind truly is 100% pure, then that's a state of nothingness, a state of not thinking any free thought, not being human, not being an indivdual, a state of no freewill. You will just be another one of his perfectly happy happy-induced pets like a dog on a leash with no free thought, you won't need anything to stay happy, all you'll need is a bare ground and him in front of you and mindlessly and happliy praise him over and over because you'll be one with God, just like a Borg creature from "The Borg" on Star Trek. You will need nothing, you will be a mind-controlled happy zombie forever, your humanity, personaity, free thought, freewill, and individuality now will perish forever once you enter Heaven.

20090227102529AA4IzuO	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	My mother in law is mad at me because...?	Well, last weekend, my daughter (step-daughter) spent the night with my mother in law and her cousin (which is my MIL adopted grandchild, so she is basically her daughter)   ANYWAY, at about 4pm, the cousin called me and said they would drop my daughter off in about 30 mins, so I said ok and hung up.      30 mins later, the cousin called and said they were on their way to the movie theater and my that my daughter was with them.      When I asked who was driving, she said "her friend"  and I said "what friend" and she said "my friend from school."   I said " a guy friend?"   and she said "yeah my friend"   and I said "how old is this friend, is he the 17 yr old?"      keep in mind that my daughter is 14, and her cousin just turned 15   and I said "and who said it was ok to go the the movies?  I didn't"      then I asked to speak to my daughter and when I asked her the same questions about this "friend" she said it was the 18 yr old guy "friend" from her cousins school and I told her that she doesnt' make decisions for herself, and who told her she could go to the movies when not 30 mins later the cousin had called saying they would bring her by soon.      anyway I told my daughter that she KNOWS that her dad (my hubby) would be VERY upset to know that she was driving around town with this "18 yr old friend" and that she better get home now.      After this I called my MIL and was telling her (VERY CAMLY, MIND YOU) that I had just spoken with my daughter and that I had asked her to come home, cause One, she never even asked us if she could go anywhere, and second because I didn't think that she needed to be driving around with this 18 yr old.      After giving me this long spiel about how this guy is smart and responsible and he just adore W, (the cousin) that he has been to her house many times this week to help with homework and he is a good kid, and just to throw it in, which I had never heard before, she also said "and he is a Christian boy"      After all was said and done and I still kept my cool, she is mad at me, and my husband for the reason, that even though I was talking about my OWN daughter and not wanting her to be driving around with this guy, she took it as a personal attack on her-basically because if i think its wrong that I dont want my 14 old with this guy, that I think it's wrong that she is letting her 15 yr old out with this so called "friend"      I dont care what she does with W, well I do, but she isnt my daughter so I cant do anything about it.      Should I apologize?      I am a Christian, she is too...well she is a Sunday only Christian I should say.

There are more important issues in the world and in America to worry about than gay marriage. do yo agree.

I don't have any homosexual friends so this is the only place I could get opinions. What do you think? Are you offended if people say its biological because you believe it's a choice? Or do you think its a relief because it's nothing you can control?            P.S I tried finding the link but I lost it.

20081123225007AAR5mDw	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians only please: do you also believe in psychology (chemical imbalance in the brain, depression, etc.)?	If you're just going to tell me that there is no God or Jesus Christ in the first place, then don't answer! I'm not asking you to support why your beliefs are different from mine.   A lot of the people, especially the elders, in my church don't believe in that psychology stuff, like that you can be mentally unstable and that you need pills for it (well, they don't really believe in depression in the first place), because they believe that God does it all for you if you just pray because he can heal anything. I do believe that he can heal anything since he is the Almighty but I think that it's okay to take medication for it if you have to. Or maybe it has something to do with my culture instead? Since I'm an Asian American and I do go to an all Asian church.. I already know that many Asians don't believe in clinical depression or any of that inner pain since they believe it's something that you can only control, not medication. But people in church keep getting God into it too. I feel like people look down on me at church, including my parents who thought it was okay to tell the whole world about it since they think I'm being so stupid and looking for attention, just because I was diagnosed to have clinical depression when it's not even "real." I mean, isn't it true that there CAN be an chemical imbalance in the brain? Isn't that even another way of how God made the body to function?

20081114135553AAMnjOW	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What i don't understand about Christian, Muslim, etc advocates of creationism?	some argue all kinds of ways to try and disprove evolution. they say there must be a creator because of the complex design of dna, of the planet, etc.      I would disagree with that but regardless......      Even if you can come up with VERY strong evidence to suggest creationism or intelligent design, HOW THE HELL does that in any way say that the Christian God is real or Alah is real. And further more the physical existence and how a god could do such a thing is completely unexplained. (yea I know God is unexplainable as you say) It really doesn't. Scientists know for a fact that gravity exists. However, the essence of it or what causes it is still unknown. (but I know Christians would say God causes gravity. Yea sure, that doesn't explain anything either).         I asked this question before and got rather stupid answers so let me clear some things up.      THE WARPING OF SPACE TIME IS A THEORY      I DON'T WANNA HEAR EXPLANATIONS FOR CREATIONISM   I AM NOT ASKING ABOUT CREATIONISM      I AM ASKING HOW CREATIONISM (if provable) SAYS YAHWAY OR MOHOMAD IS THE CREATOR. It doesn't prove anything about who the creator is.

Take a look at the "best" answer for this question.  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...       I thought the asker had a valid point. Constitution in mind, gay marriage MUST be allowed. The constitution has a higher rank in american law than your religion. The state is not supposed to not allow their religion to come into it "Separation of State and Religion".      So why does the point that you (and only you, the religious people) think it is wrong come into it?      Don't quote the bible at me either. I know WHY you think it is wrong, I want to know HOW you think your religion is relevant in law.

20090227103326AABxWHv	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	How do people have morals if they don't believe in god?	NOT TRYING TO BE RUDE TO ANYONE WHO DOESNT BELIEVE.   it just came to my mind,   i mean most of our morals come from the ten commandments   thou shalt not murder, steal, commit adultery, etc..   if you dont believe..then there is no reason to have morals because theres no god to please         so if the whole world didnt believe in god,   do you think the world would like go crazy??   becuase without god you can do whatever you want??

20081114234335AAQ82Qw	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Whereas life has a meaning, what is the purpose of an eternal afterlife (be it heaven or hell)?	Life offers up choices, trials and tribulations, happiness and sadness - an actual meaning where input and learning are required. In comparison, eternal torment or bliss, having strictly only pain or peace and no other to compare, will be pointless: no meaning, no learning, nothing. Afterlife sounds like a retreat for zombies, no matter what room you're put in.       Have faith in God or be tempted by the Devil... just why are they collecting our souls anyway? For what grand purpose? Is it a game with the two of them keeping score?      We experience reward and punishment during our life depending on our actions... so, can anybody offer up a valid reason - an actual purpose - for an afterlife? (And please think about it, I want some insightful answers not just, "It's God's will," or "We shouldn't question God's plan.")       All thoughts welcome.

Considering Islam denies the trinity and Jesus who "self-proclaimed" himself as the "Son of God" in his teachings, do you think they will still be allowed to go to heaven?  Also Islam teaches hate and allows you to rise up and kill unbelievers...to me that is nothing God would want.  God is our creator and it is not up to us to take the lives of others just because they don't live or believe in the same way as they do.  I don't think they are but am curious to others opinions.  Also, why are muslims so beligerent about religion and conversations about religion?  They are so close minded...why?  How do they know there religion is right if they were taught Islam from birth with no other options?

We recently considered getting to know each other more and seeing where it goes. However, he told me he has a relationship with God, believes and is spiritual. But sometimes he's too tired to get up and go to church after a long week or work and the gym, so sometimes on Sunday he'll get the word through the tv.      I said I want someone as dedicated as I am, and we cut things off. Was this wrong, does he not need to attend church every Sunday. I just think it's odd... and I assume he'll attend church much less than he will watch it on TV.

20080930040028AArZzVR	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians what are good reasons to get married? .. what are the right motivations?	Why should people get married? Should it be because they fall in love, and want to spend their lives together? Is it seen as just the right way to do relationships, and to help people stay pure by having a partner, rather than being burnt up by desire. Or should they be married because they feel they can serve God better together? Is there a risk of people marrying on attraction, but not really being the right match? Surely this shouldn't drive a Chrisitan marriage?      Basically what should the reasons for marriage be based upon, Biblically?

20081103234415AAiMokB	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Okay why is there so much Hatred between Muslims and Christians?	I just recently read an article of a young Iranian who stated that "The U.S. is the enemy of Muslims, especially Iranians" It also went to state that there is great hatred towards Christians and Americans. I have read many things like this across the globe, even of Christians calling Muslims the enemy, and yet both religions state that one- another are basically siblings and therefore it makes no sense to fight on it.      My question is this, it says in the Quran that basically as long as a person believes in the one true God, that their religion works as well, A Muslim can marry a Christian and yada yada yada...So then why is there such an issue between these two religions?      I have read the Quran and I see hardly any differences in the rules and thoughts of the holy book of the East and that of the Holy book of the West. If someone could tell me a valid reason without racism and propoganda it would be really appreciated.      P.S. Saying that I do not understand this issue is not appreciated as I was raised Christian and am engaged to a Muslim and have read the Quran so please do not state that I know not of what I speak.

20081125155420AAs5zke	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Jehovah Witnesses, something about your quotes?	I told myself I was not going to post anything for a season, since all my questions were answered well by Jehovah's Witnesses, and now I had to study deeper.      Yet, I am breaking my own rule because this is serious. Look at this quote, and tell me that this isn't so, please:       now this is a site that is debating the JW article about the Trinity. I am not talking in this  question about the Trinity, but their allegation that you misquote your sources  http://www.4witness.org/jwysbt/ysbt_ch1....       (The watchtower quotation begins as follows)      âFirst-century believers accepted the Scriptures as the authentic revelation of God. It was the basis for their beliefs, the final authority.â¦Since the Bible can âset things straight,â it should clearly reveal information about a matter as fundamental as the Trinity is claimed to be. But do theologians and historians themselves say that it is clearly a Bible teaching? â¦A PROTESTANT publication states: âThe word Trinity is not found in the Bible...It did not find a place formally in the theology of the church till the 4th century.â (The Illustrated Bible Dictionary) And a Catholic authority says that the Trinity âis notâ¦directly and immediately [the] word of God.ââNew Catholic Encyclopedia.ââShould You Believe in the Trinity?, p. 5       (the article talks about JW's view on the Trinity):      Endeavoring to appeal to the scholarly community for credibility, the Watchtower Society quotes statements from Catholic, Protestant, and secular authorities throughout their brochure. While they frequently state the title of the books being quoted, one will search this brochure in vain to find the volumes and page numbers from which these quotes are derived. Furthermore, upon examination of the original sources of these quotes, it is evident that the Society has misrepresented these scholars in an attempt to solicit scholarly support for their position. Letâs take a moment and examine some of the Societyâs quotes in context. (Note that throughout this book, the underlined sections of quoted text highlight the portions of text that the Watchtower Society quoted out of context.)      âThe word Trinity is not found in the Bible, and though used by Tertullian in the last decade of the 2nd century, it did not find a place formally in the theology of the church till the 4th century. â¦Though it is not a biblical doctrine in the sense that any formulation of it can be found in the Bible, it can be seen to underlie the revelation of God, implicit in the OT and explicit in the NT.ââThe Illustrated Bible Dictionary, part 3, p. 1597       âThe 4th-century articulation of the triadic mystery is at least implicitly the word of God, hence part of the Christian credo. On the other hand, it is not, as already seen, directly and immediately word of God.ââThe New Catholic Encyclopedia, vol. 14, p. 304       The key words in these quotations are âformulation,â âimplicit,â and âexplicit.â What these and many other scholars are saying is that while one cannot find a formula for the doctrine of the Trinity explicitly stated in the Bible, the concepts which provide the basis for the doctrine are clearly manifest. Thus, âthe triadic mystery is at least implicitly the word of God.â       If you made it all the way to the end of my question,  I hope it's not confusing. again, what happened is that a site says that JW's misquote their sources. and the site gave an example and so I am   asking JW's about this

Mr Phileas Fogg is a rich man whose life is only divided between his home and his club, and follows the same routine every day.      On October the 2nd he dismissed his servant because of his inefficiency and got a new one: Jean/John Passepartout, a Frenchman.      That night, in his club he and some gentlemen were talking about a bank robbery that had taken place the day before, in which the robber had stolen 55 pounds. One of the gentlemen said that the police would never catch the man as this world is immense, but Mr Fogg said that this world was no longer a big place. He even claimed that would be able to travel round the world in just 80 days. It was a bet.      So, he and his servant set off to âexploreâ the world. At the station, Jean showed his masterâs passport to a man called Fix. He said that his master had to go himself to the consulâs office if the wanted the passport to be signed.      After that, they travelled to Bombay but Mr Fix began to think that Mr Fogg was the robber who was trying to escape from the police.       During the journey, Fix, who was a detective, did not stop going after Mr Fogg, but in the end he realised he was wrong.      One of the most important adventures that occurred during the journey was when in La India, Mr Fogg saved a girl who was going to be burnt alive by some Indians as a âgiftâ to their gods. Her name was Aouda and was very grateful to Mr Fogg for saving her life.      In The end, Mr Fogg married Aouda and won the bet: he got to travel round the world in eighty days and became a happy man with his wife.

What I dont get is why do everyone make such a big thing about a black woman's hair when you have all other races of women dying,curling, wearing hair extensions and all? Why when a sista wear weave or dye her hair she gets so much hate from people? Me as a black man love a sista with dreads, short, long, afro, twist, or weave it doesnt matter. Black women are versatile with their hair. So why do the sistas get so much hate about wearing weave? If she wants to wear it let her. Its her money man. Im tired of hearing people especially other black men fussing about a black woman's hair man.

For a short film I'm working on with some others I know, I need to find a Bible verse which can be spoken over the on-screen events depicting the aftermath of an act of vengeance upon a preacher who raped a character's niece. Since the visual is vague about actual details of the plot, it would be good if the Bible verse was as specific as possible, allowing viewers to better infer the events that have transpired.
