20090131172130AAxrWSt	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	"I have friends who are LGB so..."?	....so apparently no matter what derogatory or offensive thing I say, it's ok, because I have LGB friends, and I totally support you guys."      Am I the only one kind of sickened hearing these kinds of remarks?  I have a friend/cousin/uncle/roommate who's gay, so I understand?        I'm curious why it's believed that following up an inappropriate comment with "I have a friend who's..." somehow negates their sense of responsibility for the words they choose.  It ranks up there with "I have a friend who's gay, and I'm fine with it, but they shouldn't act so gay around me."  Um.  What?!      *sigh*      Oh, and the only reason I left T out, is because I've almost never heard "I have a friend who's trans so...", it seems to predominantly circle around gays, lesbians and bisexuals.  Note: I'm not generalizing, I'm sure it happens, but it's far less common.      Tell me, LGBTers, do these comments bother you as much as they bother me?

I have to create and give a workshop to club officers called "Member recruitment, retention, and motivation" I'm still looking for cool ideas for motivation, things they can't find by looking online. I want this workshop to be verrrry beneficial.    Here is the motiviation page so far:       ? Share your Enthusiasm – You’re a leader so you can lead by example. Let members know how much fun you have.    ? Host Informal Gatherings – Helps members know you value them   ? Praise – positive reinforcement works wonders. Create a ‘kudos’ column in your newsletters   ? Share occasions – sing happy birthdays, special achievements should get mentioned.   ? Communicate Constantly – creates a comfortable, productive environment.    ? Encourage input from members – ask them to write a short article for your newsletter, ask them to write down one cool new service project to try. Shows that they are important to the clubs success.    ? Incentive program – candy etc… for working at a service project, consider a point system   ? Keep it fresh – no one likes to be repetitive. Have people change seats to get to know more members, add quotes or interesting facts to agendas, etc…          So please give me ideas! THANKS

Evolution does not encourage or discourage a belief in god, has no clergy, no rituals, no special apparels, no holidays, does not permit supernatural explanations, has no doctrines or dogmas, has no religious leaders or "defenders of the faith" (because there is no faith), no list of morals, no fables, no rituals, no traditions, holds nothing sacred, no enchantments,no miracles,no angels,no prophets, says nothing about how we should live or what happens after we die....      So how can evolution be even REMOTELY mistaken for a religion? I mean, it's the same as saying Newtonian physics is a religion as well.

20090131173106AAbnER4	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Do you regard plain dress to be vain?	An interesting person here, talking about the Amish and other plain folks, mentioned getting "dressed up in religious costumes is so dangerous. It takes the focus away from inward spirituality and focuses it on appearances. Then, when you take the costumes away the whole charade falls apart."    She/he feels plain dress is something that is just a show and therefore not modest because it attracts the attention of others.But plain people believe in non-conformity with the world (Romans 12:2) and plain dress (1 Peter 3:3-4,  1 Timothy 2:9).    In your opinion,does a cape dress wearing,headcovering person put you off the Anabaptist faith?Would you approach an Amish church if you knew they would not be dressed plain?Do you regard Amish dress to be vain?Should the wear modern versions of plain clothes instead like these people http://www.beachyam.org/yfm09.jpg or just dress simple in modern, non-brand, ethical clothes like the Quakers?    As an Anabaptist, I would appreciate all opinions on the matter.

The founders of the Adventists and also the JW's tried to pinpoint the Day and failed.This is taken from a web site called"godtube">">9/11 is encoded with the Rapture! Please check my video about the book I co wrote with Gerard Colombat called "Bible and Numbers" (Tate Publishing). The "codes", as Gerard and I call them, keep coming in! As a matter of fact, Gerard found many of them before 9/11 and in a way, 9/11 was the catalyst that united all these codes together, and it still is! These codes confirm each other. This is really mind boggling, folkes! God indeed is an awesome God. Gerard and I believe that since the Rapture will mark the beginning of the COUNTDOWN to the Day of the Lord 2520 days later, 9/11 itself is a countdown to the Rapture!"

20090131175947AAHPB7Z	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Do you like sealed box analogy for representing religion?	You know, humans have always had this sealed box in front of them and in this box are the answers to all the mysteries of life and the universe. Religions form when a charismatic person or group of people makes a wild guess at what’s in the box and they convince a bunch of gullible ignoramuses to believe their guesses.       In the last few centuries, science has enabled us to crack open the lid just a little bit and more accurately guess at the contents of the box and gradually, the wild guesses made by religious people are being replaced with knowledge and facts. But religious people know that once the lid is opened enough, their guesses at what the box contains will be shown for what they are - unfounded myth and primitive irrational superstition. So naturally they oppose the efforts made by society's thinkers to open the lid because it's the thinkers who want to know what's in the box whilst the believers are content with merely believing what’s is in the box.

And I can't be all, "hey, you're cute....are you gay?"...that could/would cause problems.

He will seize firm hold on you, 18 and whirl you round and round, and throw you like a ball into a wide land; there you shall die, and there shall be your splendid chariots, you shame of your master's house. 19 I will thrust you from your office, and you will be cast down from your station. 20 In that day I will call my servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, 21 and I will clothe him with your robe, and will bind your girdle on him, and will commit your authority to his hand; and he shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to the house of Judah. 22* And I will place on his shoulder the key of the house of David; he shall open, and none shall shut; and he shall shut, and none shall open. 23 And I will fasten him like a peg in a sure place, and he will become a throne of honor to his father's house. 24 And they will hang on him the whole weight of his father's house, the offspring and issue, every small vessel, from the cups to all the flagons. 25 In that day, says the LORD of hosts, the peg that was fastened in a sure place will give way; and it will be cut down and fall, and the burden that was upon it will be cut off, for the LORD has spoken."

20090131181137AAyCpWA	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Am I a Transsexual?.?	I’m 16 years old and am very confused.  Since I was like 4 years old I thought that maybe I should have been a girl.   (I am a boy).  It is not like I knew for a fact.  I was always on the border.  I knew my body was a boy but my brain was always confused.  As I grew older the feelings would drift in and out.  I started to like girls and I thought that was the end of it, I was wrong.  For about 6 months I didn’t feel anything but then the feelings came back.  Now at 16 they are still there.  I do masturbate.  I started to do it like a normal guy.  But then I felt the need to be more of a woman when I did it.  I started to where lingerie in order to do it.  At times I would even where a bra and put a towel in it to make it look like I have breasts.  At times I felt that it was wrong for boys to do that but then I’d know it was just in my own nature.  I have dreams of me having SRS surgery and being fine afterwards, sometimes I’d regret it. (These started before I realized that SRS actually existed).  As a child I world picture myself as being a girl and sometimes daydream about it.  I’ve been thinking about going to see a sex therapist but don’t have the money.  Up till now I have lived life as a boy to the best of my ability.  I like sports, I play video games (I always tend to pick girl characters), and I do workout.  I am on the high school football team.  I can see myself growing up as a man but always being somewhat lonely and/or depressed of not having anything about my true feelings.  I can also see myself growing old as a woman and not being nearly as lonely but might possibly regret the decision.  Either way right now doesn’t seem that great but I know one will be much better just don’t know which.  As a guy I can see myself having sex with women only, I don’t have any thoughts of guy on guy.  As a woman I can see myself as having sex with men or women.  I haven’t told anyone about my feelings or actions.  No one has suspected anything either.  These are some questions I really need answers to, and please be respectful.      Am I transsexual, if not what am I?      Should I see a sex therapist?      Should I consider SRS?       If not SRS should I consider some transition just not the genital surgery?      What do you think would be the best rode for me?

20090131182722AAGQ7VW	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Anyone married a transgender overseas girl before?	I met my girlfriend over a year ago.   It started of innocent emails and poking each other from time to time.    None of us took it seriously at first, mainly cause she lives in the Philippines and I'm here in the UK.   When she first sent me her picks I was stoned by her look - big dark eyes, gorgeous smile and just a perfect body. First I thought she's too perfect for me and there's no way she would even look at someone like me even I've always had no problems with woman attention. Everyone's got some ideal image of the perfect man or woman i suppose and to me she was just a perfect one.      Then we've discovered we've got so much in common and that's when we've started those long phone calls and frequent texting each other.    One day I've received and email from my beloved and she confessed that she's a transgender. It was a huge shock to me. I was ill for two days afterwards and just couldn't understand it all. I felt so weird, I was calling myself names and thought I'm gay, even I have never had any interest in same sex. It took me time and sleepless nights to understand it all and I've realized that I love her for who she is and nothing else matters.      My girlfriend had a hormone treatment since she was 12. She is 28 at the moment and had her last reassignment surgery 4 years ago.   She behaves like female and looks like one and if she wouldn't tell me i would not ever realize she went thru all that.   I love her to bits and she's my everything.   We both know that we want to be together and I would like to propose and marry her soon.      I know all the visa procedure but the only question I've got is if she can change her gender and name once she come here to the UK?   She's going to hold only a fiance visa and her Filipino passport.   We would like to sort this out before we get married and we'll have as little as six months to sort thas out.      I'm sure I'm not the first and the last person in such a situation and If you've experienced a similar situation, I would appreciate your advise.      Many thanx!      L.

Yesterday I am out shopping, and a very very elderly man gets in the lineup behind me, he is ancient, using two sticks, (canes) bent over, skinny as a rake, trembling, he has spots all over his face, a few wisps of hair, a stubble, rheumy eyes, and trembling mouth. His clothing hangs on him, and I am guessing he has to be 90+     His wife joins him, well dressed, beautiful really, attractive lady, probably 70+?  She says to him "Are you talking to that young girl?"    That would be me, 57 year old young girl, lol  I looked at her and started to chuckle, and she said "they never stop do they? Men always do and the better looking they are the worse they are, this one has to be kept on a leash."  She was dead serious ! Part of me wanted to say "dont do this to yourself, believe me he is safe from other women and you are such an attractive lady"     The additional weight of a leash would have made this old guy's knees give out completely.  :-)    I laughed out loud, at the point. And said "yah he's a hottie you better keep a close eye on him." The old guy grinned and his wife nodded her head in agreement, and I walked away thinking "isnt love just grand?"  Seriously, isnt love amazing? To her he is still hot and desirable to other women.      But it also made me sad thinking, she is wasting energy on jealousy when she doesnt have to be. :-( (Thats the Libra in me seeing both sides) The thot that love is amazing won out though. Love is truly blind.

I don't mean to offend anyone with this question, I'm just really curious.

Do you just have to buy new clothes and change your hair or is it a lot more complicated than that? When you meet a transgendered person and they are a woman, does that mean they have already transitioned from a man to a woman? I really don't understand the whole concept of it because I've never really been exposed to it or had much thought about it. Can anyone shed some light on my questions or provide me a website that would explain it?      Thank you:)

20090226055550AAnLJRt	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Can I pull the rug out from under the Trinity doctrine?	When the scriptures say "in the Name of Jesus", Trinitarians claim it really means:  "by the authority of" and not literally in His Name.  Lets use that same idea in Matt 28:19:  Go ye therefore unto all nations teaching and baptising by the authority of The Father, authority of The Son and authority of The Holy Ghost.  All authority in heaven and earth is giving unto me"   That puts it ALL under The Name of Jesus Christ doesnt it?   Baptism with the titles of The Trinity strips away The Name, blood and pre-eminence of Jesus rendering the ritual null and void, leaving the subject dead in his sins.  The Apostles understood this and commanded:  "Whatsoever ye do in word or deed do all in The Name of The Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and The Father, by Him".

20090131201542AA9bgzd	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why do people quote scriptures like mad men whenever someone is asking a simple question?	Even if you don't agree with the question a person is asking, the person will better receive your answer if it is intelligent and if it is answered in the spirit of truth. The word of God was not written for immature folks to go insane and quote scriptures that have nothing to do with the topic. Just because we are Christians that does not mean we are all on the same spirtual level or the same page. Just because a person ask you a question about astrology are something you don't agree with, that does not mean you have to go insane.

I don't mean a man lying to his wife about her butt being big, I mean like...at the end of To Kill a Mockingbird, when Heck and Atticus LIE and say that Bob fell on his knife instead of telling people that Boo had killed him.      I just think there are worse things people can do. If I had to spend a day with a liar or an elitist snob, I'd pick the liar.

When he reached for the apple, it went just beyond where he could get it.  There was also a stream below that he could drink from, which acted in the same way.

This is just for people who have relationship between Gay and Straight.   Please give your opinion about these two cases that I see everyday.      1. There is a college guy dating so many different girls. From his behavior, the way he walks, speaks etc. people would know that he might not be straight. Not that I against gay but it is obvious that he is very feminine acting. The question is that he is dating so many girlfriends. He still stays with her mom.      2. There is a young man (maybe in his late 30's) who is married and has three kids. People would know within a second even without talking to him that he might not be straight. The question is that he is married to a woman. He has a male friend who comes at night and then the husband and his friend talked outside the house till very late at night.      Please give your opinion only if you are in the same kind of relationship mentioned above.      Again, it is not that I am a nosy person but I am just curious and try to understand and I see it almost everyday with my own eyes.      Thanks

20090131192255AA8mlSt	Society & Culture;Mythology & Folklore	From what sources could I find the modern versions of folklore?	For instance I have read answers about banshees that have nothing to do with the Irish legends, and answers about skinwalkers that have nothing to do with Native Americans,  and so on and on......    None of these have ever listed sources so I was wondering where these modern, or alternative, versions of folklore originate. Can anyone give me a book title or website? I'm really just curious.

20090226073247AApueYE	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Who sinned first, Adam or Eve?	I was told that Adam sinned by not protecting Eve from the serpent. He was near by when she was talking to the serpent and ate the fruit.  And I've heard that Eve sinned first by giving into temptation and eating the fruit first.  I personally don't think it matters.      But last night I read Sirach 25:23 "In woman was sin's beginning, and because of her we all die."  Does this mean that the question has already been answered?

My gf and i have been together for 4 years, in that time weve had 2 breaks, as i wanted to explore my orientation and see if i was bi gay or straight. Im pretty sure now that i am bi and have accepted it. I find guys attractive, but i dont want a relationship with one. I feel im more into women than men on the whole. My gf and i have a strong relationship, we are VERY in love, but for some reason i feel like i need to get with another girl, to see if im lesbian. Ive only ever been with my gf, never had anything with any other girl, havent even kissed another girl.      I love my gf more than anything and i wouldnt be doing it coz i felt love with another girl, it would simply to see if i can have feelings for more than one girl. My girlfriend said shell give me a guilt-free weekend.....      is this wrong??

20090131183003AA3ZT9o	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Ive asked this question before but iam hoping for different folks's answers?	ok this is a logical multiple choice question  3 choices,  The logic comes from comparing the 3 choices with eachother nothing else.  Children and open minded folks have no problem answering this question,  but i must warn you that most religious folks cannot answer this question,  The reason is their religious beliefs won't let them be open minded enough to  see the logic of the choices,   any way here goes.   Choice number 1- (Most religious folks believe there is a god existing). Choice number 2- (Most atheist folks believe there is not a god esicting)   Choice number 3- (Most agnostics folks believe there may or may not be a god existing)  Which choice 1,2, or 3, is the most logical choice  and why?  good luck

20090131185818AAFxeK0	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Do I have the right to...?             ?	(God I need a hug. Sorry for bringing crap like this to the section.)      A few days ago I was at an all gay gym in my city trying to find out if my friend, lets call him "T", could get his gym hours plugged into a report so the school he attends can see that he met their physical education requirements. Well since I had the guy's membership card on me I thought what the heck and decided to hit the treadmills for a few hours (I count exercise hours in minutes, folks).      To make a long story short: I dodged a bunch of come ons by creepy old men, burned one french fry worth of fat off my body and played eye tag with a guy the whole time there. Yep, eye tag. Somehow I got the courage to talk to the guy and we hit it off  pretty well; we joked, laughed and even got each other to take an HIV test while we were there (both negative! yeah!)  Though the whole thing I couldn't help but get the vibe that he was in the closet. It tuned out he was when I asked for his e-mail, and he was so afraid of being outed that he didn't want to give it out (it was his first time at a gay gym, how cute xD)      Well I thought that was that, but somehow we ended up sharing a too great too short kiss and he told me that maybe he could give it out next time. While I lamely said the days I'd be there, he left and I went home whipped. I spent the next few days telling my friends about it and how I hope I'd see him again and they were all pretty normal about it. As a pathetic last resort to get in touch with the guy, I posted an ad on CraigsList  missed connections thing (stop laughing at me!)       A few days after posting it he responded =D! Like three hours ago! I was on cloud nine and messaged him back fast and the fact that he knew about our funny conversation made me believe it was him. After the third message he didn't reply though so I spent the last hour going crazy! When I got a good look at the e-mail I saw that it was a text from a cell. I pick up the phone to call "T",  to tell him about it all and I notice that the text-message e-mail from gym-kisser-dude had "T"s cellphone number in it. Yea, it wasn't the guy, T was pretending to be him for the last few hours.      Of course.      Now T knows that I've been stressing my encounter with this guy and how I was sad about not seeing him again (so many reasons why I won't). To me, that "joke" wasn't funny in the least. We're not even on a level of friendship to even joke with each other!      So, LGBT, do I have the right to ((((punch T square in the face and stomp on his arms while he reaches for his lip gloss)))) be upset or am I just making a big deal out of nothing?
20090131181845AASN5ST	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Is it okay to go to church alone?	I've decided after a lot of thinking that the LDS church probably isn't right for me but I'd like to start going to a local Christian church. I was raised baptist but don't have any friends in the town where I live. Is it okay to go to church alone or is it awkward? How will I know if the church will accept me and want me to be there?      I like shying away from 'mega churches' or churches with too big of congregations, as they feel impersonal. At the same time, Its harder I think for most people to become accepted by a smaller group.      help!

I was talking to my partner the other day about getting a nice suit jacket for myself - I'm always envying his.  He'd like to take me to the store where he buys all his nice shirts, ties and jackets from (He's taken me there before, and bought me a gorgeous shirt and tie).  It's very much a Men's clothing store, run by these older Italian men, where they measure you and make sure everything's a good fit.       I'm... not entirely comfortable with this idea.  I already have a difficult time shopping for clothes as it is, without having to worry about being measured, etc. in the store.  I know I dress (and pass for the most part) as male, but the men who work in this store have only really seen me as a woman, not a man.  I think why it bothers me most is I don't want to be the center of attention.      I'd really like to be able to shop and not be bothered by this kind of thing.  FtM/TS/TG/GQ/ETC, where do you shop for clothing, and do you have any kind of difficulty from sales associates?  I mean, personally I just want to be left alone, it's like clothes shopping is already traumatic enough without adding to it.      I wish I could be just a bit more confident when I'm out, I just don't know why this bothers me so much.  Anyone else run into this kind of an issue?      Thanks in advance for your replies.

I did Apartheid in school and stuff, but I have a terrible memory...      anyway I been wondering for ages really.   at school my friend [black girl] was from South Africa, but she had been in this country for a few years.   then this other South African girl [white] was like fresh from the country. and I can understand why they would sound different, after all one had been in this country for a few years.   and I thought that was why they sounded so different.      but when we were watching films and documentaries on Apartheid, the south african accent varied between the races. why is this?      thanks :)

20090131192537AAPNFyf	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	What race of girl does an East Indian guy have a best shot with in interracial relationship?	sorry for the bad grammar in the question, as you can see I had limited space.      Anyways here is some background.      I am an Indian guy. I live down south and currently I am in my junior year of high school. I do not have an Indian accent or anything like that, I really do plan on being an NFL QB someday, we do not have football at our high school sadly but I will play it in college, I have overcome too many obstacles in life in order to be denied of that position and I know good well that I will get it, I am just too determined.      Anyways I have made up my mind, I want to interracially marry. That means I will NOT marry an Indian girl (From India, not native American, I am an Indian from India aka East Indian, not native American) or a Pakastani or middle eastern girl. I live down south (I know it sucks real bad) but for college I am going up north (Any New England states or New York). So I am just curious to find out, out of all of these races which one of these girls will most likely interracially marry an Indian guy and which one will least likely. I mean in general, so don't say the whole "UHHH marriage is a thang not deturrmind by race mayne" type answer.         Here are the choices      Asian (Japanese, Korean and Chinese, I am Asian too but a different type so don't whine about me including this as my choice)      Black      White      Hispanic

I talked with my counselor who fixed up my classes to where I'm taking an english class at school and the rest of my courses are online classes.   Two of my classes (psychology and digital communications) I don't have a problem with doing. However, my third class, German 1, I seem to have a problem with.   It's not a strenuous class and I speak fluent German (which is why i opted to take this class), I just seem to, well, not do it.  I've had this class since January 22nd and I've still only logged on to the website three times to do work.   I'm so concerned that I'm going to fail this class which isn't going to look good at all considering this is my freshman year.   If you could please tell me some way to fix this procrastination/laziness problem without being a prick about it, I would REALLY appreciate it.   Thanks=]

What was the shrine symbol that Jacob dreamed about?   - The shrine symbol was the ladder.      2. How did God identify with Jacob?  What five things were involved in the renewed promise?   - "I, the LORD, am the God of your forefather Abraham and the God of Isaac; the land on which you are lying I will give to you and your descendants. The five things were protection, land, descendants, blessing, and he won’t leave him.      3. The Jacob stories are very much concerned  with how people and places in Israel received their names. What names and customs are accounted for in these two dream episodes?   - Bethel is real and Peniel.    4. What was the cost of Jacob’s bargain with the Lord after the first dream?  How many of his possessions did he promise to return to the Lord?   - Give a tenth of his possessions      5. What did the wrestling in the second dream incident symbolize?  Wanted the blessing and struggling with life.      6. Why was Jacob renamed Israel?       7. Why do you think Jacob was left with a limp after his encounter with God? Because god broke his hip in the fight.

A gay man once asked me if I were gay, and I told him I was BI and he said.........." no such thing, it just means you are still holding on to your masculinity and not all the way "there" yet! ...........Well the truth IS that I am neither Bi nor Gay but because I hate being just a boring straight guy and because I am very sexual and sensual I am rather bi-curious. But since the guy who asked me "WAS" gay I didn't want to sound as if I had a problem with being attracted to men, so I answered that way. However I think that people CAN be........as "he" put it.....on ONE side of the fence ONE DAY and on the OTHER the other day..........since people are SEXUAL and they at any time can be attracted to anyone, however they usually have a TYPE, which is also why I said bi.   What are your thoughts on this?

That means SHAVING not cutting right?   because im going to grow out a emo hair style and I need the back shorter and chunky.   Would God care about my hairstyle?   Or my choice of style?      If it is haram to harm another person without a reason then why are there suicide bombers.   and for people that say it is haram to go boxing because you punch people in the face, then explain suicide bombing and why do those muslims let us down.      Hadiths keep bothering me, like the one that says you cant touch another women pisses me off.   Its natural where I live.   I live in America.   Would God care if I give high fives.   I heard hadiths were made 200+ years after the death of the prophet......... So in the prophet time were people aloud to touch because I don't think the physical word "touching another women that is not permissible" is in the Quran.

20090226074456AA5yDu4	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why does word of God in Heb 4:12 divide asunder soul spirit & joints marrow to get to heart of matter?	Hebrews 4:12   For the word of God [is] quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and [is] a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.       Is soul spirit as if dividing asunder law law?   Is joints marrow as if dividing asunder laws grace?   Is it a problem if the heart has plural thoughts and intents?      Which of two dividing asunders would be    "comparing spiritual things with spiritual": 1Cor 2:13?      Which of two dividing asunders would be    rightly dividing the word of truth to end up    approved(only) and not ashamed: 2Timothy 2:15?      Why and How is word of God "sharper" than any twoedged sword?   Is this allegory for Grace is smarter than law vs law & laws vs grace;   as law vs law divided against itself and laws vs grace is still "division",   But "Christ is the end of the law" is "our peace", and not our division?   So to have no schism in body, rightly divide laws vs grace to grace.       Why does the priestly figure in Revelation 1:16 have a    sharp "twoedged sword" coming out of his mouth, and    use this sharp twoedged sword to smite nations later on,   if God is defined as also merciful, and not as also merciless?      Comments?

20090226074545AAf207s	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	I've seen a lot of answers, but this one beats them all. Do you find it helpful or maybe a bit off?	I was asking if Christ preached Paul's gospel of blood for sin, and here is one of the replies:      *****************************   Christ in His earthly ministry preached the KINGDOM gospel to the Nation of Israel alone. That gospel is no longer on the table      Christ RISEN gave a NEW gospel to Paul for we who are in the dispensation of the GRACE of God, and that gospel is still on the table today.      Paul's gospel is called the gospel of Jesus Christ because it is NEW information about Christ RISEN, and is part of the body of truth given to Paul alone for the church today. The BODY church, NOT the Kingdom church.      God changed programs, dear lady. We are not being offered the Kingdom gospel today.      Paul is our apostle with the information WE need for the Christian walk of faith today.      The KINGDOM gospel was to the Nation of Israel ALONE and God has changed His method of operating.      ****************************      So what do you think? I think this person is saying that the Kingdom Gospel is not the Gospel of Jesus Christ! (and thus does not apply to Christians)      Click on my avatar if you want more context... about these two gospels.      Is this person's answer right on target, or way off base?

I'm just curious because of all the drama over the New York times cartoon. If Bush would have still been president and that cartoon came out no one would have cared. So now why all the sudden is it racist? Is Obama's being black going to have a "If you don't like me your racist" ideology for his term? All the negative press given to all of the presidents of the past was allowed so now after all these others why are we setting up a "Be nice to me" boundary? Whats so special about Obama that the press isn't allowed to take shots at him like the others? Is him being black going to have this big of an effect on the country? Whats next? Not being allowed to put him in political cartoons at all because the black ink would be considered racist?!

As in, isn't that proof of the whole conversion on the road to Damascus? Because God saw how the other 11 somehow just couldnt get the Word out. So He enlisted Paul, and Paul then got other learned people into the ministry.          So if Christianity was going no where under Peter, but flourished under Paul, isn't that proof that God chose Paul?

This morning, when I went to take a shower, I learned that the water was cold and it still is. My sink water, and bathwater were all cold and a little dirty. I went to see the apt manager and even called her asking WHERE maintenance is so that I could get my water turned back to hot water. When i went to see the apt manager's office for the first time today and told her about the problem, she said maintenance will be there shortly and just keep the water on for 15 minutes, So i waited about 1 hour for maintenance to show up so I went by the office again. The apt manager said that he will be there. Another hour went by to the point I got pissed off so I called the apt manager's office and asked WHERE maintenance is. She said he is out somewhere. I said WHEN will he be there to turn my water back to hot water. She said she does not know. I became angry to the point where I sneered at her then stormed out of the office.      It has been until then since. Maintenance never showed up. I'm thinking of reporting the manager to the owner of the apartments where i reside. She has pissed me off since I reported the problem to her. I wanted to take a shower!      Have any of you had this problem when it came to rendered services of maintenance? Is this considered rude and thoughtless by the apartment manager on her part?

I always find it interesting how people talk about how good-looking a celebrity is, while most celebrities look just like the rest of us without their makeup and extravagrant clothing that is meant to flaunt their figures.

20090131160314AAoSN4n	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Can anyone tell me why people are...?	…so rude and senseless on the internet? I know this has been brought up a lot, but I’d like to take another look at it and get some more opinions.      The first thing I think of is anonymity—people don’t have to actually look the ones that they criticize in the face, so it’s very desensitized. Unlike reality, those with low self-esteem aren’t the usual victims on the internet—they’re usually the aggressor. (Although, many bullies in reality have low self-esteem, as well).       But when on earth did people stoop to treating other people like they do online? Bullying them like older kids shaking down the little guy for lunch money? Honestly—I think it’s really sad that politeness and human respect has taken a total backseat. Is it that people don’t actually realize that on the end of every username there’s an actual human being? I think, or at least hope, that most of the insults and criticism slung at others over the internet would never leave the mouths of the people saying it in real life. Yes, in real life, there are jerks. But from the number of jerks online, compared the number of jerks in the real world…I’ve noticed a staggering difference. This must mean that--*gasp!*--people who are nice in real life can be jerks online? How can this happen?! Okay, people. If you’re a total jerk in any aspect of your world—be it work, play, school, or online…you’re a jerk, period. Being an elitist pig online and a sweetheart to people’s faces doesn’t make you less mean. Who you are when you know you can’t get caught, no one will ever know your identity…that’s who you REALLY are. So it’s a little disheartening, to me, to see that so many people are pointlessly cruel and pigheaded.       This is not to say that you have to agree with every opinion, but people need to learn some respect for the opinions and feelings of others. I’m no goody two-shoes, and no, I’m not always kind. But I am respectful. Bashing the religions, opinions, appearances and likes of others it pointless to me (as is the idea of trolling the internet for the express purpose of DOING so), so perhaps someone else can explain it better.       There are a thousand arguments going online right now. People are cursing, insulting, and behaving like rabid monkeys. Please tell me they don’t expect what they say in rudeness to make any positive difference?      Phew. This is a bit of a rant (okay, maybe a lot of one), but I really would like to hear some more opinions on this, or see if anyone agrees with anything I’ve said. I could be totally wrong in a lot of ways, since it is, in fact, just an opinion. I’m no better than anyone else, and I can be mean-spirited and get angry. But I try to approach it in a civil way, and I don’t exist to devastate others.       Is it too much to ask for people to behave like people, whether they agree with something or not?      Thanks,      ~Jen      P.S. Please don’t misunderstand, I am NOT generalizing everyone who uses the internet. There are a great number who treat others with dignity and respect, and I appreciate that. The trouble, it seems, is that they appear to be greatly OUTnumbered…

20090131194625AAJVBpV	Society & Culture;Community Service	American red cross club project ideas?	Hi all. I am brainstorming for activity ideas for my american red cross club in my high school. My club can not make fundraisers because it's against school rules. And we are already going to do a blood drive. Already wrote letters to soldiers, made cards for the senior citizens and hospital patients and made sandwiches for the poor. What could we do which is more interactive and interesting? I've contacted a senior citizen center which might not work out. I have a group of more than 60 members in the club. What are some safe projects other clubs had done? It would be great to interact with people and their problems more than just making cards and having constant parties. There should be another purpose for this club because I want to raise leaders out of it. The Blood drive is a long time away and we are prepared for it already.but what  could we do this spring? Got any more ideas?       It would help a lot. =]      And if i would like to invite a professional to teach our members CPR and first aid basics how could  i do that? I know that we'd need certificates but would it be possible for trainers to come in and teach all of us and help us get certifications? The club would be a lot more valuable then

I noticed that all my life I've only been in relationships with women from other race, Spanish, White, Asian or mix but never Black women. Now don't get me wrong, I love all women and treat all equal and with respect. But for some reason I have not been given the chance by a black woman. I have many women friends including black women who claims they are attracted to me but whenever it comes to be serious and be in a relationship and pass the friendship status only women from other races have allowed me to make it happen.Mind you i have not yet to received any complaints or bad things said about me from any of the women I've dated.

I'm going back and forth between 2 gifts to give my bf. The 1st one i know will make him laugh but he can't really use it and might just get shoved in his closet. the 2nd one he might open really fast and then put away but i know that he'll use it a lot!   1) A teddy bear on a motorcycle (which i would put a funny note on it about "here's the motorcycle you always wanted") and something else with that, not sure what yet.   2) a teddy bear he can actually hug wearing boxers with kisses on it that he can wear (i just have to see how to keep them on the small bear) and some after shave that he loves.   ***So what do you guys think? All of your help is appreciated!!

20090226075941AARxXYw	Society & Culture;Etiquette	Employees like 'Steve' at workplace?	I recently posted about Steve the backstabbing coworker at our bank who will do this: receive a call from a customer, I immediatley hear my name as in 'USC did what?', Steve then runs to supervisor mentioning my name nonstop, Steve will then email me about what I supposedly did wrong. My boss says to ignore him so I do what boss says or try to anyway. I got lots of great answers from you guys earlier but now want to know how to deal with Steve's friend and motherly figure named Samantha at work. If I do not speak to Steve she will ask 'USC, why do you not talk to Steve?'  I once gave an honest answer and was told I was paranoid. It is obvious that Steve is her boy so how should I resond to Smantha without rocking the boat because she is a fiesty one just like Steve?
20090131195838AAx2VWt	Society & Culture;Mythology & Folklore	How do I deal with Clairvoyance?	I'm a negative clairvoyant, I've discovered what it's referred to as recently. I've always had dreams about the future, but not the whole thing. I dream snippets, small scenes. But they always, always, always come true. I can tell the difference between my clairvoyant dreams and my regular dreams because I always wake up after a clairvoyant dream, but only for a few minutes. They're super vivid and colorful, too. Every time they come true, something huge happens. I dream something seemingly insignificant, but immediately after, something big happens.       I guess what I am asking is what should I do with this? I have absolutely no idea if it is a good thing or a bad thing. I want to intensify the dreams and make them longer, but how do I do it? How can I make them more significant, extend out so I can see what happens?

I grew up in the states and not in Egypt like my parents and my parents were Copts so they didn't dwell on Islamic things all that much. Having said all of this I have wondered why so many Islamic countries have the crescent symbol in their flags. I know that the Ottomans had it because of a family heirloom that had been in the family from the Ottoman period. Why is the moon so significant?

20090131200349AAy7qIB	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	I need some real world advice.?	I have no identity.  You can't describe me.  All you can say about me is that I'm a quiet kid.      I'm a little interested in stuff like Lord of the Rings, Magic cards, and I'm sure I would play Dungeons and Dragons.  But I don't have any actual friends that I could do that stuff with.      When I see a kid with long hair, glasses, and is obviously one of those geeks, I get jealous.  He is happy with who he is.  And it shows.      I'm afraid to let anybody know the real me.  When asked what music I listen to, I try to change the conversation.  I don't want them to know what I listen to out of fear they can't relate and then think I'm weird.  I don't listen to common bands like other people do.      I'm not interested in sports.        Cars?  I know absolutely nothing about them.  I don't get why people know and care so much about cars.      I have no friends that I hang out with outside of work or school.  I sit at home on the computer all day.      Biggest accomplishment?  I've filled up my Pokedex in one of the original Pokemon games.  Yep, that's all 150 original Pokemon, including Mewtwo.  (I'm actually proud of this though :P)      I'm 17 years old and a senior in high school.  I've never been kissed, never had a girlfriend...       Someone please give me some advice or something!!

I hope that one day you'll come to realize,   how perfect you are when seen through my eyes.

20090131194553AAAfK1y	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Am I a lesbian? What should I do ?	For the past year and a half, I have been having strong emotional feelings for my female art teacher (Im a girl as well).   These feelings started as soon as I saw her and have bloomed into a darn right obsession *to some extent* Every time I see her I get butterflies. Whenever she talks to me I can't look at her in the eyes or talk to her while I know she is watching, I get shy and go red in the cheeks.      I have a gut feeling that she knows my feelings for her and may have the same for me. She always talks to me about work, or what I am doing for the weekend, asks how I have been and shows me more interest then to the other students. Whenever I talk to her or do something wrong *like dont get enough sleep* she says 'Ohhh *my name*' but it sounds as if she is moaning it. (Im serious).   Most of the time her focus is on me, whenever she talks to the whole class she looks at me and smiles.      She is married but she has an abusive husband. I over heard her talking to another teacher talking about how she got the bruise below her left eye. She said he just lashed out at her for no reason.   I want to tell her but Im not sure if I do. I just want to get opinions and feedback on what you all think what is going on and suggestions. Please some real answers

20090226080621AAAdOEv	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Rational People, do you agree that taken overall the absence of evidence IS evidence of absensce?	An earlier poster gave us the idea that there is no historical evidence because people of that era could not read and write--which allowed him to "fluff" over the egregious lack of evidence for the jesus character. He quotes the fictional writer mathew in his account of the temple curtian being rent--and tells us that "people couldn't read and wrrite" "The temple curtian was torn in two from top to bottom." Excuse me but    the Jewish heirarchy was educated and could read and write--and wrote volumes. Now--the temple curtain was very important to Judism--for it to be rent in two--and not one word written about it--when there are volumes and volumes in Jewish archives from this period--is rather like the New York Times not reporting on 9/11. Sorry but clearly--this omission IS evidence the event never occurred. Pliney the Elder was a Roman historian living in Jerusalem at this time--who wrote about natural wonders etc--don't you think he might have thought it worth a single line or so--when dead people walked into town--again the omission being clear evidence that the whole affair either never occurred or was exagerated. Among the romans, the jews, the egyptians, and others living in the area were astronomers-in the sense of recording major celestial events --there are good records of eclipses yet there was no "blotting out of the sun" recorded for this time period--if it went behind clouds--well then the biblical authors need to have their noses lengthed don't you think. Finally there are many records of earthquakes in the area (the earth shook and the rocks split)--quakes recorded in BC and a fairly violent one in about 80 AD--yet none hit the middle east in the this time period. Surely ya think residents of Jerusalem and those living in the area might have noticed a good shake don't you think. Any one of these by themselves might be arguable--all of the lack of historical documentation for all of these MAJOR occurances taken together clearly shows the mythic nature of this jesus character and the crucifixiton. Add to this the 15 prior "saviors" in history who all died via crucifixtion according to their own legends--and we see clearly that the whole thing was mythical and that christianity is built on a tissue of myths and sham. The only reason it exists today is the brainwashing techniques that all religions develop to keep the faithful faithful.  I'd be interested in any reasonable arguement "other than the bible says so-it's authors had a vested self interest"--to accept their account would be like asking Hitler if everything in Mein Kampf was true.  So--present me with a reasonable logical valid arguement if possible.  Can you do that?

20090131200034AA70fQ2	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians, why was your god content to allow humans to worship the sun, nature, etc, for thousands of years?	Before the Abrahamic god arrived on the scene, humans worshiped all sorts of things... the sun, the sky, the trees, animals.      The Sumerians, the Valdivia, the neolithic cultures of China & Japan, the Vra, the Druids all got along quite well without your god, or Jesus.      Why, for hundreds of centuries, was your god content to just sit back and watch mankind flourish without his guidance?

A lot of people I know think that drinking is "something to do" and they are bored with everyday life.  It seems like drinking is an activity.  How can people do this to themselves...don't they know alcohol is more addicting and more harmful than a lot of street drugs?  I think it's because of lack of confidence in social situations, addiction and media.  What do u think?

I'm 6'1 and the docs say i still have another inch in me so when i reach my adult height i will be 6'2.  I HATE my height and i HATE all the stupid are you a model or do you play basketball? questions.  Also, it's really hard to find a tall guy.  For me the minimum height in a guy would be 6'4 and at 16 I don't know any guys that tall.  I'm the tallest girl at my school and there are like 3 guys taller than me (none of who i like)  I feel like society is harder on tall women.  What do you think?  Whats your impression of tall women?  Also, do you think there is any way for me to just accept my height?  Any advice appreciated!

Read the quran with the english transliterations, go online and really learn what Islam is all about. If you truly understand the beauty of it, you would not be remarking negatively about it. What have the Muslims really done to you? More importantly than that, what has ISLAM done to you that you are bashing on it?

20090226080728AAnv8p1	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Experience with Japanese friends?	This may sound weird but I have a Japanese acquaintance - here in the US - who will just not take a hint.  I have tried to be nice but it's getting impossible.  Basically, she is always asking me to get together and I am always saying that I am too busy.  (We are both women in the same age group.)  I did hang out with her a few times, but found there was nothing in common in spite of the fact that she is very, very nice.     She is here studying and doesn't have many friends.  I have a full time job, studies and many friends and family members nearby.  (I find it hard to take care of those relationships and add an extra person right now.)        I've even not answered a few of her emails.  But she'll wait awhile and send another!  What do I do?      *A friend who lived in Japan for a short time suggested that the Japanese are so much more "socially-obligated" - that is, they focus on keeping harmony and relationships while Americans are more independent and less bound by social ties.  I don't want to stereotype, so I am asking everyone out there for their insights.  Thanks!

20090131195059AADwZFg	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christian question.....Where can I find split skirts ie Culottes? It's my Dad's conviction- not mine. Now I...?	know I already asked this question before, and I'm thankful for all the great questions I got. I forgot to mention that I already searched Modest Appearal USA and MyCulottes.com. I already ordered one thing from that web site. I want something sporty, and that won't get me laughed at as usual, meanwhile, he's bent on the granny style-looking split Skirts that was in style when my Great Grandma was a kid. That's his conviction so I listen. My perfect idea of a split skirt is something that Khaki, army green, camo, and with cargo pockets. Stylish. But that some one who doesn't believe in pants can agree on too- a happy medium. Here was my previous question:   It's my Dad's conviction- not mine.    But since he is the head of our house and he is good to us.... and I really have no choice.... I oblige without much of a question and try to keep peace even though me and my mother do not share that view, we still obey.       Now, we are going to Orlando to go to a few differant amusement parks with rides that requires a split skirt or a pair of culottes. And pants and men's shorts are not an option. I mostly appreciate web sites, but will accept a store name also. Thanks!
