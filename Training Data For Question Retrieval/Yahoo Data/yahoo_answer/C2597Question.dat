So here's a description :::      -Short (5ft-ish)   -Slim   -Graceful   -Agile   -Polite   -Pretty. Perhaps stunning is a better world. I'm not talking playboy model pretty, I mean, inhumanely beautiful.   -Skin: Light, rosy cheeks. Not quiet red, more golden-pink if you know what I mean   -Lips: Redish-pink with a prominent cupid's bow.   -Hair: Shoulder length, curly, colour of Welsh gold. (Click here, if you've never seen Welsh gold :  http://www.fhinds.co.uk/Images/Products/...  FYI, only the part with the Welsh dragon on it is welsh gold, the rest is just normal gold.)   -Eyes: Varies between pale, rose pink and gold, depending on mood. Bright and shiny.   -Shy among humans, but bright and bubbly when around her own kind (Faeries/Faeries).      So, that's it. I'm not looking for a car that really reflects her looks, more her personality. So very unique, perhaps a rare car? Oh, and graceful and agile are a must.         Anyone know of a car that fits?         Thanks,   sdj x

I have a Sony home cinema system, with an class D S-Master Amplifier, which I've owned for around 4-5 years now.

Hi,        My 2000 Nav recently had an air ride susp issue with the chk susp light on.( Advisers in the forum lead me to the relay- which infact was the problem- Thanks to all)... The mechanic ran a series of tests to troubleshoot the issue. I saw him playing with the fuses as well as the battery, also, manually pumping air to the air bags via the compressor.......Susp problem has been resolved, but the PROBLEM now is that after all this trial and error, he started the car and the Service Engine Soon light came on, over drive flashing, all lights in the vehicle are on as well. When you drive the vehicle and get to the stop sign, it stalls..but reverses just fine......He checked the fuses and all are OK....Any ideas what could be the problem suddenly?.....The only issue I noticed in the past before the suspension problem was that it was idling too high...Please help..I'm desperate ...

20090308103614AAgKLED	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	PCV valve hose end is  plugged with a screw?	I asked this last night and just looking for other opinions. Thanks people!      Why would a so called good mechanic plug my PCV hose with a screw?   Just had my head rebuilt and found a loose hose with a screw in the end. I traced it to my PCV valve (one connector type) and wonder why he plugged it and also charged me to replace it with a new one???      In my opinion the PCV valve is required for a reason, if it wasn't then there wouldn't be one right?      More info.....there is a NEW PCV valve on car...the hose from the valve goes towards the rear of engine and hangs down and it is that end that has a screw in it!!       What effect can this have on my car because sometimes while driving and then at a standstill and then to give gas it feels like she wants to stall but not that bad and not all the time...   This is a good car. I want to keep it and everything has always been in good condition. My PCV was never plugged with a screw before this guy did my head job. It is a 1997 Chevy Lumina Car 3.1L V-6   I really don't want things "plugged" like this and wondering why he would do that???????   I cant ask him because this happened out of town and I don't have contact with this guy. My parents had it fixed when I broke down on the road.

20090306222133AA2Wvtk	Cars & Transportation;Insurance & Registration	Someone wants to borrow my car to use in their drivers license driving test?	Basically the person is a friend of a friends and I don't know them personally. My friend says that the kid doesn't know anyone with a car and my friend figured he's ask me since he doesn't have a car either. I wouldn't mind because they said they'll fill up my tank as payment and I have the time to kill. But, I'm worried of what kind of risk am I taking? Is there anything I should do before I let him take my car, if I decide to let him? Some sort of contact saying any damage he has to repair/pay for? Or should I not worry about. Ill drive the car to and from the dmv, he will only be driving it when the DMV instructor person is in the vehicle.

20090306233454AAmxj4o	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	What does my mechanic mean by "internal engine work"?	My car broke down recently, I have a 99 Mitsubishi Galant, and it had been running louder lately. Particularly, if it hadn't had enough time to warm up (a good 10 minutes) it makes a sputtering noise. Like a rattle.      It has also been making a weird noise, and seems like it has been struggling when it's around 20-30MPH and the RPMs are between 1000-2000, when it's past 2000, the car runs smoothly.      It died on me in a parking lot, it was attempting to turn over, there were engine noises. What might this be? Oil's good, just got it changed 2 weeks ago. I should add, I live in Minnesota, it was 0 degrees here at the time, possibly colder since i've last checked.   I tried to jump start it, but it wouldn't take. Just fueled up the day before.

20090227104309AAznwtL	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Why does my car keep going out of alignment?	To add details, I bought a 2007 Ford Focus SE in October of 2008, everything was fine until the steering made a noise, turns out the power steering fluid was contaminated, well, they fixed it, and shortly after, my car went out of alignment, I thought it was no big deal since the car had 30k miles on it, and paid for an alignment in November, then, the end of november it was out of alignment again, I couldn't believe it, so, I just drove it. In January, I put 4 new tires on the car, and then had an alignment done then, everything was fine again, until the end of January, I called Ford complaining, and they agreed to take a look, when they looked they found a Bad Axle shaft, and said the reason the wheel was tilted to the left when I drove straight was because of "tire pull," they fixed everything and it was fine, now again it is out of alignment.       I'm losing my head, this annoys me so badly.       It's not really that the wheel pulls, it's that the steering wheel is not centered while driving, it now tilts to the right when I'm going straight, it looks as though maybe when this car was produced, the steering column is crooked possibly? All I know is, I'm not paying for another alignment, but also don't want to ruin 400 dollars worth of new tires.         Note: I do not take corners rough, nor go fast over train tracks, I don't hit pot holes, and practically PAMPER this car.       A litte help?

Whenever I drive behind trucks and SUV'S (mostly domestic cars) such as Ford Explorer's they brake, stop braking, brake, and stop braking, and so on until they come to a complete stop.  It causes their brake lights to blink on and off and it confuses me whether I really have to brake or not.  It's not like I can see what's in front of them because I drive a coupe. I don't understand why they do this.      Are the drivers just that bad and can't control their car's brakes?   Ford Explorer owners, Why do most of you guys do this?   It's so annoying! =)

20090227112906AAdpVD6	Cars & Transportation;Buying & Selling	Should I keep my car?	I have a 2000 Chevrolet Malibu LS with close to 175,000 miles.  Other than the water pump gradually wearing out (had to replace it at about 155,000 miles), I have had absolutely zero problems.  I have routine maintenance done by my hometown mechanic, i.e., oil changes about every 3000 miles or so, tune-ups, fluid changes, annual internal "visual check-ups" to make sure "nothing is ripped, torn, and is otherwise in good working order, etc., etc.  I still have the original alternator as well.  I also have the car on just liability insurance (enough to keep me legal *lol*).  I also have AAA.      Let me cut to the chase.  I have never been in debt in my life (I'm 37) and I have trouble visualizing myself paying $5000 a year (full-coverage insurance and car payments) for four to five years.      I drive this Malibu 65 miles a day to and from work, 55-60 MPH on cruise (it's a straight four-line highway).  We also take occasional weekend drives (sometimes up and down the hills of Arkansas).      Am I doing right by keeping this vehicle until it poops out?  (My piano teacher has a Chevy that has 270,000 miles on it and they've had no trouble with it, either).

20090227111443AALle7Y	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Could something have gone wrong during a brake job on 94 Chevy s10?	I have a 94 Chevy S10 truck.  Last week I took it to the mechanics to have the brakes looked at.  They replaced the rotors & brakes (not sure if pad or actual shoe & pad).  I also had a fuel injector replaced (not related).  However, when I picked up the truck and drove it home, the steering was really weird.  It would be driving just fine, and then start to pull to the left rather hard.  I'd slow down and a little while later I'd get a slight pull to the right.  My husband drove it a few days later and he constantly got the pull to the right. Enough so he suspected the drag links.  We took it back to the mechanic today, and he can't seem to find anything wrong.  I'm thinking it most likely has to be something to do with the brake job because it wasn't acting like this at all before we took it in.  The steering and alignment were very good before.  It just seems too coincidental not to be.      Am I missing something - could it be something else?

20090227112030AAwfcGj	Cars & Transportation;Insurance & Registration	Car Insurance query on how to fill in application forms?	Last year my son's car was hit by another car driver. The other car drivers insurance company paid for the damage. Then when my son tried to get the last years' insurance he filled in his application on line and when he did so he put on it that he had made a claim for an accident (but it wasn't a claim on his own insurance) and the insurance policy was issued, then a few days later the manager there ,said that there was no claim on his last insurance and therefore could not be insured with the same company,(they only insured high risk drivers)  so they cancelled the policy and found my son a new insurer at a higher rate.        Now that my son has come to get this years insurance and is trying to find a lower quote , as the company he is with are very expensive- we are not sure how he should complete the insurers questions regarding whether he has been declined insurance before. He doesn't want to say no he has never had insurance  declined as he is not sure if they mean his type of situation and if he says yes,  the insurance companies  either quote a very high rate or won't give a quote at all.   What should he put on the application forms? Any advice would be most welcome.

So I have a 2004 Civic with 37K miles, drives great, no problems, but my check engine light came on (not the maintenance light that reminds you about oil changes). I just got new tires, brakes, and an oil change last week. My inspection is due tomorrow.       I've run the OBD2 diagnostics and the reader says that I have 1 fault but does not give any trouble code. It just says N/A 01/01. I can shut off the engine light with my reader but it just comes back on again once I restart the car. I can't figure out what is wrong except that the light is on (which I believe is an automatic emissions fail on the inspection).       Should I just go an get my big fat fail sticker and then deal with this later? I have no money at the moment to try to figure out why this light is on, although it's unlikely that I'll have any money next month either.    Should I drive on an expired sticker or just go with my engine light on even though I know it's going to fail me?       Any tips on what the heck is wrong with my car? I can't figure it out and I don't have the finances to throw money at the car when it's just guesswork. Thank you all.

20060924203737AAwd2ZB	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	1996 Jetta question.?	A few days ago I was driving my 96 Jetta (only a few miles), and out of nowhere my coolant light started flashing (temperature was in normal range).  I stopped the car for about 30 minutes , and went back home, this time the light wasn't flashing.  When I got home, I heard a weird noise under the hood of my car, so I checked out and the tube connecting the coolant tank to the engine was leaking fluid where it was connected to the engine.  Any ideas what caused this?  Is it safe to drive?  Thanks.
