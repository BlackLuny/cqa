I would go no bigger than 31s for that reason. Save up for a real lift (IE not a body lift) and to regear. Expect to spend about grand or so for a decent suspension lift and another $1200 to re-gear.

5XFGNmVuaa	If an employee just went to the restroom or something, then I would go back and pay.

If a shop is advertising a tune up they are using a catchy term for whatever they want it to mean. A tune up was needed up to about 1970, a little in the 1980's. Cars needed regular attention and adjustments to keep them running. Spark plugs didn't last long, they had points and carburetors etc. On modern cars just follow the scheduled maintenance and deal with any other issue that arises. Your spark plugs for example are listed due at a specified mileage on the schedule. It's best to find a professional and reputable shop you like and go there not all over town. Let them know that you are interested in keeping up your car, that you want to be informed of what is due and any other issues they see. Bouncing around town gets you whatever it is you are asking for regardless if it needed or not.

2DLqsVFcaa	read about them in things called books|`|XLXncQu9aa	There are two basic ways to learn about cars.  The first obvious way is to do research.  If you want to know more about a particular subject no matter what it is, read about it in a library or online.  The internet is so much more than just entertainment.  Use it to do research on cars.  What type of cars are you interested in?  What do you want to know about how a car works?  Basically doing research on cars and what involves cars can help you to be educated about it as a particular subject.  The second way is to go to local repair shops.  Talk to a mechanic and ask him/her questions about what they do.  Ask them if they don't mind that you sit in with them to see what it is they do while they work.  Some may mind because they don't want to be distracted, but if you express an interest in the field of mechanics they may just have time for you.  Also you might want to volunteer.  Look up volunteer opportunities for mechanics.  Volunteering for a mechanics agency may help you to gain more knowledge.  But try researching about cars first and narrow down what it is you want to know.|`|KwY0EveSaa	you could subscribe to car magazines like "Motor Trend" or "Automobile" and read about the cars. you can go on the internet and google in "knowledge of cars." sometimes the knowledge of cars just comes to you when you start to like them. you can go to Auto Shows with someone who knows a lot about cars and have them show you the different parts of a car (inside and out). you can go to a mechanic you know and have him teach you about cars. <br>  you can read books, watch videos, and even takes classes about cars so you'll know about them.|`|55a7c9ee13be4af0516d03c798a92a60aa	buy a junk one and take it aprt and put it back together is how i did it read books on auto repairs which is way to many to list any good ones here i started working on my dads cars when i was like 5 or 6 a creeper was big i couldnt do much but look but i was there and today im still working on cars you can go to school for it but til one does reading about cars best  way to know about cars

HAIAE3AZaa	Well I am 25 years old. I took drivers education here in Texas at my high school when I was 16 years old. If i remember correctly, you study the book first, then go to take your written test to obtain your permit. You could always be the "early bird" and study now, and go take your written test and have your permit when you start drivers ed. If you are in Texas, unless they changed the law since I was in drivers ed. You will not have to take a driving test at the license office if you complete your drivers ed training course and get your completion certificate. I know that may not be exactly what you wanted to know. But I hope it helps you. Good luck.

cAGv5evLaa	Michelin are very good. You will be very safe with them.

It came with 205/55R16 Michelin MXV4 tires.  Very solid, good grip in dry or wet.  Excellent wear.  She saw the VW ad about powering through corners and started doing so, sometime leaving cars with supposedly better performance behind.<br>  <br>  A little over five years 50,000 miles later they still look good with 3 or 4 sixteenths of an inch of tread depth left.  But you lose a lot of wet traction with a reduction of tread depth, and five year old rubber in Southern California's corrosive atmosphere ("you can't trust air you can't see!") deteriorates, so we went to get her reshod.  Since the Michelins did so well we stuck with them, stock size Primacy MXV4 tires, DOT rating of 640AA, tread guaranteed for 60,000 miles.<br>  <br>  "Better" is a variable.  You can get better traction, but give up tread life.  You can get better tread wear, but usually at a loss of traction.  A 640AA is high mileage (640) and excellent traction (A).  There is also the money factor; you don't want to pay for something you will not be using.  There may be "better" tires, but I couldn't find them.<br>  <br>  We got the new Michelins at Costco as they had a sale going and gave us four tires on the road for under $580 -- including free rotations, inflations, rebalancing, and flat fixing for the next several years.

daw140ceaa	Yes, you can connect it behind the head unit, IF the head unit is connected directly to the speakers.  However, it's possible that your vehicle is equipped with a factory amplifier.  That's common with premium OEM sound systems.  In that case, the speaker wires behind the head unit will run to the amplifier, not the speakers.

So, utilize your grants and school loans wisely my friend. Otherwise, you can get a job, and save up about about 1500 dollars, and this will get you started.

However the Few units of P47s in the Pacific did perform adequately.<br>  <br>  The P51 was used in the Pacific only late in the war as an escort for the B29 bombers. It performed excellently in this role but there wasn't the same drama in the air war by that time since the Japanese air forces had been drastically reduced in effectiveness.<br>  <br>  The premiere US fighter in the Pacific theatre was the P38, it was responsible for more downed Japanese aircraft than any other type.|`|4bGQpFB3aa	Mustangs and Jugs did very well against the Japanese.  Especially toward the end when they could provide some escort for the B29s out of Saipan and Tinian (before LeMay went to night ops).<br>  <br>  The P38, which wasn't that well recieved in the ETO was also a great Pacific fighter as you could come home on the other one.<br>  <br>  If you're looking for more, try www.ArmyAirForces.com|`|Lbulud8raa	Warbird Pilot is quie right in his answer and I can add:<br>  <br>  Both of these aircraft are more commonly associated with the European Theatre of Operations, but also did sterling service in the Pacific, as did several other legendary fighters such as the Corsair, just to name one other.<br>  <br>  Both of the aircraft you mention had distinct advantages over typical Japanese aircraft:  they had longer range was one point, and were quite easy to fly on long missions.  They offered better pilot protection.  The Battle of Britain demonstrated that a lack of piolts in an air superiority situation is more problematic than a lack of aircraft in most cases: the Japanese lacked skilled pilots and treated them like commodities and dispensable weapons.  American and other allied forces treated pilots and aircrews as essential componemts that needes effective weapons to fight in the long term.  <br>  <br>  These two aircraft were such weapons: fast, well armed and armoured, manoeuverable and resistant to battle damage.  By late 1943 the myth of the invincible Zero (Mits A6M) had been dispelled too.  Towards the end of the war, their single engine status was less of an issue as the war came closer to Japan as well.  The Jug in particular was held in some awe as it was a single seat fighter that had "combat persistence" and great strength and weighed as much as many light bombers at the time.<br>  <br>  The P-38 was less liked in the ETO because early models were not fitted with superchargers when supplied to the RAF.  Despite them christening this aircraft with the name "Lightnening", in Europe the early ones were anything but quick.  Later models reversed this though.  This aircraft also did well against the Japanese, especially once the pilots were able to get the best range out of their aircraft....an advantage that took some time to develop.|`|f05ea7b6535ace20ef9808478efbef84aa	Unless I'm much mistaken the Mustang was only operational in the ETO.The Thunderbolt may have been employed on the periphery of the Pacific war,most combat missions against Japan were flown by the USN.

Thpmh4lmaa	I bought a used car in New Mexico last week and saved some cash. Try visiting several used car lots in California. <a href="http://www.findusedcardealer.com/California-Used-Car-Dealers.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.findusedcardealer.com/Califor...</a>|`|04118ae23b43083371f655128f6eb539aa	Be careful. GM would have an add-on called a "California Package".  Check the VIN.  There is a # that denotes which exhaust system is installed.  You have no idea where that car was before.  Do yourself a favor and run the VIN through Carfax and pay a mechanic to check it out.  All used cars are sold, "As Is".|`|Lu9HbywHaa	Should be the same, as long as there aren't any aftermarket parts installed. As long as it meets the California's requirements you should be fine. Before you can register the car you have to get it smoged
v5fEfmO8aa	Well, those statements could mean a lot of different things, But when He says you need  a compression check, This means your motor is getting tired and worn out. For the noise, and the response from the mechanic, I would be checking the lower end of the motor. First thing I would do is drop the oil pan and sift through the bottom of the pan to see if their is any metal particles. And this would be a good time to examine the bottom end of the motor such as the main Bering's, piston rods, bolts etc... I do have to tell you, I wish you the best of luck, However I don't know how many miles the car has, but it is 10 years old. It might just be getting tired. So Good Luck to you!|`|ozwLZwXeaa	That means it will cost you lots and lots of money for the tear down and repairs.

A compression test will test your cylinders and should be able to tell you something.|`|3585617e66b6e408b3a748ee15238f75aa	What he is saying is that the engine will have to be taken apart to fix what is wrong with it. That could get very expensive. You need to ask yourself if the car is worth fixing. The compression test tests the cylinder pressure to see if the piston rings, head gaskets or the valves are bad.|`|4vOKQ0YKaa	it means there might be something wrong inside the motor like push rods, cams, lifters, pistons, or piston rings, or any other major component that make your motor run like it should|`|1tJ25HPZaa	Internal engine work means that there may be problems with some parts in the inside of the engine.(ie. the crankshaft, pistons, crankshaft bearings, valves etc.

3jzqG7Oqaa	I would never buy either of those cars, but looking at your two choices, I would go with the 1998 Hyundai.

The Sunfire/Cavalier did not get good until about the 2001 model year.<br>  <br>  Hyundais back then were pretty crappy too.<br>  <br>  But the Pontiac will likely cost a lot less for repairs as parts are cheaper and much more readily available.|`|ojxfzv7Faa	Both are junk<br>  <br>  Keep saving for something better

AqKALUItaa	I've had several cars painted at Maaco, and they do a very good job for the price. But, realize that no refinish job will be as good as the factory paint, especially if the very cheapest materials are used. So,  you definitely don't want to get the Ambassador (cheapest) Maaco paint job. The Presidential, with catalyzed enamel, is the least expensive that has a chance of holding up for more than a year or two. Be sure to find out how much of the old, defective paint will be removed. Will they just feather the flaking paint, or completely strip it off?. <br>  You should get a firm price estimate from Maaco so you can directly compare the cost of their paint job versus your friend's. It may turn out that Maaco will not be that much less expensive than your friend.|`|HFrsH9MRaa	Forget Maaco!!!!! They use the cheapest paints systems and do lousy prep work to keep the cost low. Have your friend do it, and make SURE he is using Asian or German paint, and not anything from USA!!!!|`|TsJoADGPaa	If you want to save some money go for Maaco. They have different paint levels that you can buy, and unless they do not do their job right, it should last for the 3-4 years you want to keep the car.<br>  <br>  Also, you could get the car painted several times for the same amount of money of getting it painted once at the other place if it becomes necessary.|`|fr5ImqW9aa	And your paint will chip..Maaco sucks..Also they don't hardly put any clear on your car and your car looks dull within about 6 months..|`|JLayHNZCaa	Maaco and don't worry when someone opens a door into it.  Put any extra money into something else more fun.|`|RiQA4Epraa	if you spend 10 bucks on some wax<br>  you couldve prevented this..|`|AA11435704	When you have flaking paint the car needs to be correctly prepared or the new paint job will not last. Macco is good for older cars that have been correctly prepped, they do what is called a scuff and shoot job. This means that they do not spend much time on preparing the surface, they just scuff the old paint and shoot the car. <br>  <br>  You are planning on keeping the car for a good while. you are going to have a better job that will last longer if you have your friend do it rather than a cheap low quality job. If you were planning on selling the car after repaint, then I would say to take the cheap route, For something you are going to keep, have it done right.
sqEydCZVaa	Well this is a good question and its never happen before that I have seen and I have seen a lot of older 325's in my day. I'm thinking if work was not done recently your filling the reservoir up to much when the car is cold and when the fluid warms up it expands like it should and the res can't hold that much.  <br>  If you did work recently its possible the hoses were hooked up backwards.|`|iAqqQrXRaa	does your steering have a squeaky sound when you are drivin? if it does,you shud prolly look up for the kind of fluid ur car needs. sometimes if you jus buy any, it causes all the problems you r havin.so get rid of all the fluid and put the right one for your marvellous car.
CkrD7rOVaa	I'd simply say the BMW Z4, better for everyday driving if you want, the S2000 will be scary in the rain, the BMW Z4 is about grip, precision, and safety most importantly. The BMW Z4 is a rather reliable car, for example the 2003 BMW Z4 scored a 9.5 from the consumer section of edmunds.com, not bad for its first year, not many problems. The S2000 isn't as appealing to many people, which is why the Z4 is better. Better quality things, and more attractive interior and exterior trust me. Handling, I'd say the BMW definitely, and yes the Hondas faster, but depends on the driver and how they drive. Better value, they both have nice stuff, but the BMW has more, I'm not saying this because of the name plate, im just stating what I see, look at the Z4 interior, compared to bland S2000 interior.|`|ojxfzv7Faa	If you want luxury and something for fun, everyday driving, get the BMW. If you want a more simple, reliable and fun sports car with great high revving and a high HP/L engine, the S2000 is definitely the better of the two.|`|fr5ImqW9aa	They are both good cars..I think you should think about future maintenance the bmw is going to cost alot more to keep maintained..If you don't mind paying the extra I would go for the bmw|`|Jfa0QcBsaa	what you need to ask yourself is can i live with the low ride quality in the bmw if not then buy the honda|`|3MTYGEbWaa	The Honda is more reliable but Honda has announced the discontinuation of the S2000, which will lower it's resale value and make parts hard to find -- at least until it becomes a collectible in about 25 years.|`|bB5ZPtvvaa	overall both decent cars,  in the long run the honda will of course be more dependable....and do not get carried away with the BMW name....take a look around they are just another commodity car producer and regretfully when they rushed to become that in the 90's they left cutting edge- performance behind..a lot of BMW today relies on the "propellor image and marketing. in general (statistics and performance and dependability ratings prove it) their cars are slower, more expensive to buy and service and to repair and regretfully are way low on dependability.<br>  <br>  bmw perhaps better looking, but a touch underpowered and of course there is overall problem with lack of quality.<br>  if you are in the 2 seater market,  perhaps better than both is the nissan product (350z if used or new a 370z),  better looking (my opinion) rugged drive train and better engine with more low end grunt than the honda.<br>  <br>  regards,  owner past and present of supercharged cars, fan of forced induction

uLEpOpSMaa	Are you going to rebuild the engine's internals or just modify it a little bit?  If the engine is newer then 1971 it will have a low compression ratio around 8.5-1, meaning it's harder to make lots of power of it with the stock heads, pistons, and cam.  A 1970 or 1971 454 would be ideal, but you could still make some decent power with headers and dual exhaust on a 8.5-1 454 engine if it has a good ignition, clean air filter, and is in good running condition.<br>  <br>  Another thing to consider is that an RV engine may have been worked really hard and is tired from pulling so much weight.  If it's a high mileage RV motor, I'd recommend not pursuing it.<br>  <br>  Also, all 454 blocks are basically the same regardless of year but the other components change from year to year.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!
vvVOZd18aa	Hey,I say Toyota Prius. It is very Reliable,and gives a great Mileage. If u don't like it go with some other but see for Reliability, Fuel Economy, and safety. Go for a used one rather than a new one. If u buy a new one and if u want to sell it the price varies a lot. If you buy a used car and want to sell it after 1yr or so, the price doesn't vary much. I feel Toyota's, Honda's, Ford are better reliable than Nissan's. Iam using Mustang coupe its reliable and great but when the part of Fuel economy comes its ok.<br>  U are of age 18 so u may like coupe.

Your insurance will probably run you around $200+ a month and depending on the insurance you decide to go with might require a deposit. Save up as much money for a nice down payment as you can that way it looks better. As for the whole insurance thing I always find it easier to pay 6 months ahead of time at a time and save up for it. Don't pay the sticker price. Once you find what you want tell them this is all I can afford and they can work with you. Trust me. They can. And right now, everything this is only worth what the buyer is going to pay for it. Plus, the value of it depreciates almost 5k once it's in your name and you drive it off the lot. and always get a print out of the value of the exact car you want so when you go in there if the dealership is asking to much you can def talk them down then. lol<br>  <br>  Have fun with your car search!|`|Jfa0QcBsaa	you should buy a toyota aygo as it is cheap has cheap insurace and is relialbe|`|i7nEgSW1aa	Get Nathan's Van|`|d8eb2747aa6627fe7a5b835a16139fa6aa	Car insurance will be damn expensive.  You'll be looking at probably $2k per year.  Maybe more.  The industry really is stacked against single men under 25.<br>  <br>  You should ask a question in the military section of YA and ask if the Army has some sort of discounted program for auto insurance.<br>  <br>  So let's say that leaves you about $300 per month for payment.  You could pick up a new economy car for that kind of payment, or a used car with a bit more flexability.<br>  <br>  If I were an 18 year old guy, I'd want something a little fun.

Yes, that's the answer. <br>  ======================================...|`|AA12103453	Well when you hit the brakes the safety to most Remote Starts would kick in and shut the engine off(since the key wouldn't be in the ignition, turned to on). So you would see that instead of "haunted" it was just a remote starter that started the car. Yeah sure the car is haunted though.-+|`|BgwTxzEFaa	Do you have a remote starter on your vehicle?<br>  <br>  May be on the same frequency as a neighbors.<br>  <br>  Seen it happen.|`|pYJ0I0cXaa	probably just a dream.

euo0j3NTaa	Okay, about safety, it what happens in the street, what the sign has been made: <br>  <br>  Here's the stop sign-You may stop what you are driving and watch, and/or let the pedestrian can walk across the street. Then you may go<br>  <br>  Here's the yield sign-You may slow down what you are turning left and/or right, stop watch, and/or let the pedestrian can walk and car pass; same thing as the stop sign. Then you may go.<br>  <br>  Here's a bus stand-You may wait for the bus.<br>  <br>  Here's a traffic light: <br>   <br>  Red Light: You have to stop what you are driving and walking, stand still; wait your turn and let the other vehicles and the walkers go, watch until the green light says go. You may go.<br>  <br>  Yellow Light: You have to amber what you are driving (slow down) before yellow light into the red light, if you can't wait, drive a little bit fast; not too many speed. If you are the pedestrian, you have to wait until the next green light and if you are walking, what the green turns into yellow really fast, hurry up and run before red light.<br>  <br>  Green Light: You may go, drive what you want to go and walk what you want to go. Go and be free!!!!<br>  <br>  Beneath the traffic light: <br>  <br>  There is the orange hand, you may slow down stop and wait your turn.<br>  <br>  There is the white pedestrian image, you may walk and go what you want to go.<br>  <br>  Here's the pedestrian crossing with an letter "x" above in yellow cylinder- When you are driving, stop, wait, and let the pedestrian can walk across the road.Then you may go. And if, you are the pedestrian, alway push the pedestrian crossing button. Then, you may walk across the road and go.<br>  <br>  Here's the school crossing sign- When you are driving, stop, wait until the person and/or people who are the school students. If you are the school student, you may walk across the road to go to school. Or if you are not the school student, you are not the school student; you are not belong to the school, do not go across the road with the school crossing sign is. That means you are stranger, do not go across the road with the school crossing sign is.<br>  <br>  Here's do not enter sign- You do not enter into the wrong way; as an exit way.<br>  <br>  Here's do not exit- You do not exit into the wrong way; as an entrance way.<br>  <br>  Here's an enter sign- You may go into the right way; as an entrance into to school, building and any place where you are.<br>  <br>  Here's an exit sign- You may go out, in the right way; as an exit, it's a get out. You may get out of the school, building and any place where you are.<br>  <br>  Here's the fire exit sign- You have to hurry up and exit the school, building and any place where you are, wait outside before the alarm can go off, you may go back into the school, building and anyplace where you are. And/or if, the fire is still inside of the school, building and any place where you are when the firefighters doesn't show up so quickly to extinguish the fire inside of the school, building and any place where you are, go to home, friend's house or your neighbor's house; inside of the school, building and any place where can be evacuated and/or vandalized- which as the school, building any place where you are can be closed.<br>  <br>  Always you have to do, what the person doesn't know you that much, as the stranger. Whatever you do is: do not talk to stranger.<br>  <br>  Always you have you to do, to remain with your family, friends and pets (including your dating mates).<br>  <br>  Here's the seat belt sign- When you are in the vehicle: When you are the driver, passenger and you in the back of the vehicle, always put on your seat belts, all the way in and sit tight.<br>  <br>  <br>  Remember: always you have to do, is to follow the safety rules and think safety.<br>  <br>  Thank You.<br>  <br>  Have a nice day.|`|b2444f35a7f9696e20acbb1687b47466aa	U.S. Department of Labor / Occupational Safety and Health Administration<br>  <a href="http://www.osha.gov/" rel="nofollow">http://www.osha.gov/</a> <br>  <br>  and <br>  <br>  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration <br>  <a href="http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/</a> <br>  <br>  Or, go by a local Fire Department Station - they have all kinds of safety information. <br>  <br>  should give you plenty to look at. <br>  ======================================...|`|uNcynY38aa	Razorblades...................BAD<br>  Chainsaw juggling...........BAD<br>  ....Ad Nausium............

i0OeuQnMaa	I have towed cars with a tow bar, a tow dolly, and a drive-on trailer, and prefer the trailer by far. First, it is much easier to back if you need to do this. The car rides higher, and has always been cleaner at the end of a long day, and is actually less trouble than using a tow bar or dolly. Plus, a drive-on trailer equipped with brakes, is safer, in my opinion, than the others.|`|k6IFEGYzaa	You can tow a car on an A frame in this country but its not legal to do so in many European countries.|`|57a71f942819d63b93af6d1922b8dd52aa	get in Touch with the makers of the motor home some can not tow a car if they have a extended chassis if it can you can get a A frame you will find them for sale in any of the motor home mags|`|tGUnM2XCaa	there is an attachment you can buy that allows motor homes to tow cars, it fits to the car's steering but I can't think for the life of me right now what that attachment is called... also, the car has to have the attachment option fitted to it's steering, I know that some cars dont have it, I'm sorry it's a little vague, but some astra's do have that option to be towed behind motor homes as long as you have the correct tow bar attachment, it basically lets the towing vehicle steer the car.|`|Bj3BgdLRaa	<a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_2123302_tow-car-behind-rv.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/how_2123302_tow-car-...</a>|`|jxg88KqFaa	You can buy a special attachment|`|Jfa0QcBsaa	no

Connect to the positive anode on the internal voltage regulator (colored green) put a jump wire from the white wire to the red wire on the external control module.|`|EMC7JwVBaa	Unless you have the power to run all those amps from extra batteries and a more powerful alternator to keep them charged that project may be too ambitious. I hope the contest you're getting ready for pays off enough to make all this worth while.  Are you confusing watts with amps? If you want to produce 500 watts from 12 volts the amps will draw a little over 40 ampres each. That may be about half the battery current. An extra battery could do it. Consult a stereo shop with expert technicians.

2cb3153c313f04e3810e6bc6151a9494aa	How could you haggle with them to get the price down to $85k?  The only sure fire way I can think of would be to offer the salesman $16k - that should do it.<br>  <br>  Really, there is a large possibility they have that much or more money into it themselves and they are unwilling to sell it for a loss.  Or even if they have less in it, the market may not support that and there would be little reason for them to sell it to you for less than they could easily sell it to someone else.<br>  <br>  How much they put into the car would be up to whatever amount they felt was reasonable based on what they could sell it for and what they consider to be their minimal amount of profit (since they must make a profit in order to pay their staff, pay rent, etc).  A 2007 Turbo could be expected to sell for around $100k or more depending on options.  Given the current economy, it was likely that they have counted on the possibility of having to hold it in stock for awhile (which costs more), and figure %15 is probably about minimal profit level when you consider costs and commission - so they most likely have $75-80k in the car (or more depending on options).  But it could vary, and if a lease return it's an entirely different picture.<br>  <br>  Negotiate and see what you can get... make an offer for $85k, and they will either accept it or reject it.|`|kOCtAVXwaa	If it was a trade in, than most likely the last owner go totally ripped off.  That is just what happens with these cars.  Im guessing the trade in was probably 75k, than if something was wrong thats 5k they added.  If they arent happy making 5k on you, than go else where.<br>  <br>  This is a slow economy, and they know this, and you should too!  Play there game, waste some time there, and when all said and done give them the offer and walk away.  They can think about it, while you look else where and find the car you want for the price you want. <br>  <br>  You will find the car for the right price.  <br>  <br>  I traded in my 02 996 TT and got shafted on the trade in for an Audi, but I wasnt thinking the best at the time, and wish I just kept the damn porsche.  Best car I ever had so far overall.  <br>  <br>  One thing to think of is manual gearbox for this car, as the tiptronic slows it down quite a bit.

r0FkeXtVaa	These models are not categorized as Sport or luxury cars,. So expect to pay about the same insurance as if you would have bought a Toyota or Honda of comparable size and performance. <br>  <br>  There are many mods but it all depends on how much $$$ and how fast you want to go. Most of the mods for these cars don't do a damn thing and is a waste of $$$. Average mods that actually improves the performance can run from $100-$800. Figure it this way, it would be about $-$20-$40 per horsepower. Most mods can be easily installed by owner .|`|hEZaWs9yaa	Insurance is ok, depends more on driver. Don,t mention mods. Ck. saabnet and saabcentral. Saab had 2 levels, std 185hp and HOT,high output turbo on SE models. Cheapest way to increase accel. is to disable APC and overboost cuttout, but you will crack a piston if used regularly! Kits that allow more than std boost only for limited time and conditions are safer. Saab club has Nines magazine with performance ads. Groupnine performance for mods. Stateofnine is for accessories, expensive. Saabmedic.|`|abnqs0jQaa	It won't be astronomical. I have a 2006 9-5, which has a 2.3L Turbo, and I pay like 700 per year, and I'm only 23, living near Boston. When I had a 1999 9-5, I was paying about 550 a year, same basic engine, just less powerful. All things considered, it isn't too bad insurance-wise. It is not a target of car thieves, and being 8 years old, the rates won't be too bad.<br>  <br>  And they can easily be moded. There are a couple parts stores online, if you just google Saab Performance or Parts. Most notable is Hirsch, but I'm not sure of their accessability here in the US. I know they are available in Europe, where you can get the parts put on without voiding the warranty, kind of like AMG before Mercedes took them over completely and made them in-house. I think you can get ECU tunes from Nordic and BSR as well.<br>  <br>  There are Saab 9-3s out there with tons of hp and torque, just you tube Saab with a word like drag, fast, race, etc...<br>  <br>  Good Luck!

It appears to work<br>  5.  No, but that does not mean that it does not occur.<br>  <br>  <br>  Finally, it is possible that the image memory in the camera is full; in such instances there may not be any further flashes, although some cameras are set to register a dummy flash regardless because that very act tends to slow down the vehicle in question (a case of shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted!). Or, the other reason for a non-flash could be that the camera is faulty.|`|HMgRFOhqaa	It used to be 10% + 2  which would be 46, so if you were doing 50 and it didn't flash, then think yourself lucky...|`|kgk3Yz9Naa	well i can answer the 1 to 5 questions but normally the cameras are set to flash at 10% over the road limit.

JeUvm9NIaa	I work for a leader in On-Demand Charters. It works like this.<br>  1. You call in/ request a quote for service. You provide the destianations and the dates for the flight. We then check to see if we can use our aircrafts, sub-carriers to handle this flight. We can usually launch the aircraft in about 1 hr from the time it is booked.<br>  2. Depends on the routing, some may not be feasable inthe time frame due to crew duty times/ customs/ or overflight/landing permits. Each aircraft type usually has a few set of pilots  that can operate it. This ensures 24 hr a day coverage, meaning it is never uncovered with a crew and potential lost trips.<br>  3. How are you going to pay. Many large customers have established credit line with charter companies. Personal charters are handled usually by a credit card, where as we call the card issuer and place a hold (secure) on the account for the price of the charter. At this time the card is not charged, but the amount is placed on hold and can be withdrawn by us if for some reason other forms of payment do not work. (You sign the ppwk on a Charge Auth Form that I send you prior to incuring any costs on my end). We will usually give up to 30 days, depdning on the customer to arrange a form a payment (we dont like using credit cards as they take about 3% in fees) such as a wire transfer, cashier's check or some other form of certified payment, otherwise we charge the card.<br>  4. The aircarrier will advise what FBO's that they will pick you up at, and some will even set up ground transportation to pick you up at hotels and take you the the airport. <br>  5. The aircraft shows up and you still go through security done by the pilots/Flight attendant and board the aircraft.<br>  6. Get to destination and relax. If your plan on returning roundtrip, the crew and plane will stay at the airport with you, or plan on returning at a certain time. <br>  <br>  Private Charters are in no means cheap, and a typical charter in a Lear 25  from Detroit to say Las Vegas will run around 20k one way. Plan on spending another 1,000.00 a day to keep the a/c on standby. Oh, its also 250.00 for every hour that they have to wait on you, not including any overtime airport fees or international charges.|`|dWLgwb3baa	The charter industry varies a lot, so the answer to all of your questions will be different by operator.  I'm assuming you are talking about passenger charters, so all answers are based on that.  There are also on-demand cargo charters as well.  Here's some general answers.<br>  <br>  Booking-<br>  A passenger will generally call a charter operator or charter broker with their requirements - number of passengers, amount of luggage, destination, preferred cabin size, etc.  The operator/broker will then provide several quotes based on which planes are available and work best for the given trip.  Not many places book on the internet because there are so many variables for aircraft and cost, a real human quote is the only practical way to go.<br>  <br>  Pilot assignment-<br>  Charter operators are generally small operations that may only have a handful of pilots for any given plane or fleet.  They are usually assigned on a rotating basis.<br>  <br>  Advance notice-<br>  Varies by operator. Some will give as little as 20 minutes notice, some 2 hours, some a full day.<br>  <br>  Wait time-<br>  Yes, the crew will generally stay in a hotel on the shorter trips.  If it was a short flight with a long wait, the customer may elect to have the plane fly back to home base because that would be cheaper than crew hotels and meals, parking fees, and any "wait time" fee that the operator charges.<br>  <br>  Flight hours-<br>  Impossible to say.  That varies a lot by aircraft, operator, customer, and market conditions.  300 to 500 hours a year per pilot is a pretty good average.

YupMCYHlaa	It depends on so many things!  Some models just fall out of favor, so a few years later they're worth much less no matter what shape they're in.  Other models, like the hot sport bikes--GSX-R, CBR, R6, etc.--are upgraded almost every year so they lose value even though they're still very good bikes, because people want the latest/greatest thing.  When a model is discontinued, all the ones already on the road lose value because parts availability will be dicier. Very highly stylized bikes lose their value quicker because the look goes out of style.   And really popular models only one or two years old with light wear on them are worth more because people see a lightly-used one as a good alternative to waiting for a new one.  For a long time, Harleys and BMWs  kept their value very well and Japanese bikes were considered 'disposable', but this is changing.<br>  <br>  So it's hard to say.  But as a general rule I'd say a bike loses 20-30% of its value the first year, then 20-30% of the remaining value the second year, and so on.|`|f16135be2aee5d27de11802f8dd54704aa	After 10 years, they tend not to lose any further value.

DydFQ0fcaa	Take your car back to the dealer and have them adjust your steering wheel.  This should have been done as part of the alignment service you already paid for so it won't cost you anything.|`|AA11536968	The sad truth about cars and especially their steering components is that they can't be changed piece by peice.  replacing only a part of the entire setup only makes those parts that were once good, wear our even faster.  Sounds stupid but when you have something like a steering setup, all the parts need to wear evenly to maintain certain things like tie-rod, bushings, alignments ect....   Ford might have made things worse by only fixing what was wrong, and not taking preventative measures.  it might be best to get one last alignment, but only if you can take it to a shop that will check all the parts of your steering setup.  Usually a shop that specializes or has a reputation for aligning cars for racing (rice rocket/tuner shops) will do this for you.  A really good one can sometimes even point out and expain what part was the cause for everything else going out and causing your alignment to go south every other month or so.

Tg5PxDnBaa	This is a  2 part answer. <br>  part one: if you have not narrowed you choices down but have your vital information ready( budget, needs, style, wants etc.) hire a buyers consultant. Imagine a car salesman working for you instead of the dealership. His\her job is to do all the research  on  your needs, evaluate all makes/models, find any incentives and pricing, then boil that down to a 2-3page report with recommendations. Yes you pay them, but most are a one time fee of $300-$400. Usually a bargain for the work we do.<br>  Part 2: if you know *exactly*  what you want, Edmund's.com has what they call TMV pricing. it is an average of what that car is selling for in your area. To effectively use TMV you MUST know what you want down to color!<br>  <br>  kbb & Edmund's are guides and only guides. updates are monthly(usually) and things  change in dealerships almost daily, so don't be too rigid on those prices, your consultant should be more plugged in on dealer stock etc|`|FKoPF6hraa	You also should compare car insurance quotes for different cars before buying one, for example here - autoinsurance.noneto.com

You will need to find a custom exhaust/speed shop cause norm exhaust shops can't/won't get it right <br>  <br>  You can fit dual 2.25" over the rear axle, of if you want larger you have a couple of options. You can get a upper panhard bar reloction bracket to move the upper bar, <br>  <br>  Or you can just stop the pipes before the rear axle and use turn downs on them. <br>  <br>  Now of my third gen (1988 camaro) I run larger rear tires and stiff springs for drag use so my rear is high enough I ran my dual pipes under the rear axle.|`|PmaB839Naa	The first answere is right.

nAzbLdBCaa	Depending on the charger, you may only be charging at 2A for the last 4 hours.  But if you had discharged the battery say 60% used, leaving 40%  in the battery, It would charge at 10 Amps for 4-5 hours.  but as it reaches 85% most Automatic chargers cut back to 2 amps or so and take several hours to top up.  At that point it will shutoff or stay at the trickle rate. Check the spec. on your charger.  Good Luck!|`|4KvLIa6Saa	You should be using a deep cycle charger at 10 amps 6 hours 2 amp over night>|`|QFfLXNPfaa	whatever size the battery is in amps, charge rate should be 10%. i.e 110 liesure sholud be charged at 11 amps. from 12.4 volts(flat)this would take 10 hours to reach nominal charge.<br>  you really need to perform a specific gravity test and volts or drop- test to verify the state of charge. also do not try to charge a marine liesure battery with an automotive/car battery charger.they are regulated at 13.7 volts.marine batteries should be regulated at 14.4 volts other wise the plates will sulphate and your batterries will lose their deep-cycling/charging capacity.<br>    simple math : 6 cells to a battery @ 2.4 volts per cell =<br>  14.4 volts.<br>  <br>  tried and tested basic battery management.<br>       buy a proper marine charger! <br>  sorry to appear rude but its the right answer.<br>  good look, happy boating.<br>  <br>                                isnertam
SohrsIBoaa	because you have a 3 speed.|`|AA11660242	It sounds like you're engine is burning fuel inefficiently. It should be getting around 22 MPGs average. I would probablly check to make sure that everything is in running order. Check the spark plugs and cables, as well as the distributor to make sure they're all in good condition. Does it need an oil change? Old oil in your engine increases friction, making your engine block hotter. A hotter engine burns fuel less efficiently. Check to make sure you have coolant, and make sure it's also in good condition and that you have enough of it. Check tranny fluid, flush and refill if needed. Tires play an important role as well. Make sure they're in good shape. There are tons of ways to improve your economy and to see why you're getting 50% of what you're supposed to, but these are the main reasons. Good luck!|`|hZco463faa	dont know where you  live but it is probably the ethenol.

i5lk5eN2aa	Sounds like the ECM is hunting due to a sensor malfunction or some other problem. I suggest you check for trouble codes. That might yield information about the malfunctioning system or sensor. If that yields no codes then I suggest you check for proper fuel pressure at the test port on the fuel rail. I don't have the specific pressure specs on that but I expect it is about 40 psi. The fuel pressure should be steady. Also check for a vacuum leak, especially the hose at the idle air control valve. A vacuum leak will cause sensor signals to be incorrect and, while trying to satisfy perimeters, the ECM will hunt which will cause the engine speed to surge.|`|AA10331789	A "hunting" or "rolling" idle indicates a lean engine condition as described below.

f62f84279f66c27518596919f0d61103aa	Regardless of military experience you will go through training again at the FAA academy.  The good thing about being an ex military controller, you will get to skip the 3 month intro course and you won't make the something like 8.50 dollars per hour most academy students make.  As an ex military controller you shoot right up to the AG (short for academy graduate) pay band.  Right now, depending on locality pay thats around 38,000 dollars a year.  <br>  <br>  <a href="https://employees.faa.gov/employee_services/pay_perf/pay/" rel="nofollow">https://employees.faa.gov/employee_servi...</a><br>  <br>  Go there and find the pay scale excluding locality pay.

Just about ALL the information about controller pay on the internet is WRONG!  I went into the FAA and became a controller believing that I was going to make a 6-figure salary (because of what the "all-knowing" internet said) and when I actually got hired and started working, I found out that I probably never would - even after 20 years of service!!!  The new pay scale for controllers that was put into effect several years ago drastically CUT controller salaries and, in my opion, makes the job NOT WORTH THE MONEY.  The very most new controllers can now expect to make after MANY years of service is between $75,000 and $90,000 a year.  I worked with a controller who was a retired controller from the Marine Corps (with over 20 years of service) who ended his retirement to work for the FAA and he got the same pay as the brand new, untrained employees who had never been in the military (or even controllers), which was $50,000 a year.  He didn't get ANY seniority from his prior service either.  He didn't get any respect from the FAA...they treated him like an inexperienced trainee.  The only thing he got was a one time $20,000 payment as a signing bonus that the FAA was offering to military controllers at the time.  The FAA is a backward organization, I tell you!  I left the FAA because the job isn't at all what it looks like on paper, and I've been much happier ever since.  My only regret is that I actually DID work for the FAA...|`|0Th3lvynaa	Well the average air traffic controller makes about $122,220 a year.

a71d5f81722a7bc5dec2e5ac57fc2fd3aa	Hola de nuevo Pepe. Voy a tratar de ser lo mas explicito posible sin enredarte mucho.<br>  <br>  Una leva es un ovoide concentrico montado sobre un eje, esta leva al girar abre las valvulas de admision y escape del motor, ok? Esta leva tiene una duracion medida en grados (Duration) desde que se comienza a abrir y se cierra totalmente dicha valvula a la misma vez esta leva tiene un levante total que se mide en milesimas (lift) y se mide a la apertura maxima de la valvula. Bueno esa duracion y ese levante puede ser modificado a la hora de que se esta maquinando en el torno. A un arbol "caliente" se le da mas levante y mas duracion en grados. Por lo tanto las valvulas abriran mas y permaneceran mas tiempo abiertas permitiendo un mejor llenado de mezcla aire/combustible hacia los cilindros.<br>  <br>  Existen mucho mas factores en el dise?o como el perfil de las rampas de apertura y cierre y la alineacion de las levas de admision respecto a las de escape (lobe centers) pero por lo regular los arboles de levas para uso de calle no son tan sofisticados.<br>  Regularmente un arbol "caliente se instala de la misma manera que uno convencional, siempre y cuando sea uno conservador. En los arboles de levas no aplica la frase de:<br>  "Biger is better"<br>  Los arboles de competencia efectivamene si tienen que ser instalados por expertos pues deben de ser centrados, y se debe verificar que las valvulas no choquen con los pistones. Pero esa es otra historia.<br>  Ojala te haya podido ayudar.<br>  <br>  Pro 4 Racing Cars - Mexico<br>  <br>  Suerte|`|RrOYau8oaa	Pues lo tiene que instalar un experto, por que implica desmontar todo el motor, eso en los motores en "V"...y algunas partes de la cabeza de los motores en Linea.<br>  <br>  Se dice que el Arbol es "Caliente"....por que los picos (en ingles se llaman LOBES, no se como le dicen en espa?ol) tienen diferente el angulo, lo que hace que las valvulas abran mas tiempo o menos tiempo. Se dice que el perfil es agresivo o suave. (al menos asi he oido)<br>  <br>  Tienen ventajas y desventajas, pues los arboles de levas originales, estan dise?ados para darle un funcionamiento suave  y silencioso al motor cuando esta en "ralenti" (IDLE). Pero un arbol caliente le da mas torque y HP solo en cierto margen de revoluciones, por decir, de 2000 a 6500 el arbol es eficiente.<br>  <br>  Mira este video, es de un Neon DOHC 2.0 con arboles "calientes"...y fijate como acelera...incluso, hasta  los 150 KPH sigue acelerando:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCm8fTWMkmY&mode=relate" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCm8fTWMk...</a><br>  <br>  Pero tambien parece que fallan mucho los autos con arboles calientes, por que esos arboles no estan dise?ados para bajas rpm, si le pones un arbol caliente, es obvio que lo quieres para correr.<br>  <br>  escucha a este camaro V6<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNhl4KJP5CM" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNhl4KJP5...</a><br>  <br>  Honda tiene un sistema muy bueno, llamado VTEC...este tiene 2 perfiles...<br>  <br>  A bajas RPM, las valvulas abren normal, para ahorrar gasolina, pero si le exiges, un contro, electronico e hidraulico hacen que se active el perfil mas agresivo, donde las valvulas abren antes y cierran despues, y aumenta sus HP, checa estos videos:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzW8ECb5xWk" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzW8ECb5x...</a><br>  <br>  Escucha al motor antes del VTEC...y despues cuando entra o "patea"<br>  <br>  Y para terminar, para que veas por que un profesional los debe instalar, mira esta hoja con cuantas especificaciones para cada arbol de levas y cuanto cuestan (por desgracia, mi auto lleva 2)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.modernperformance.com/dcx/crane_cams_for_1995.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.modernperformance.com/dcx/cra...</a>

El compresor tiene los mismos componentes que el motor de explosiÃ³n, es decir, camisa, biela, pistÃ³n y aros pero, no tiene bujÃ­a ni le llega gasolina lo que lo convierte en un "peso muerto" para el motor que debe arrastrarlo / moverlo en detrimento de velocidad, potencia y consumo de gasolina.

oReGA5kEaa	Usually the question is worded something like this:<br>  "Has an insurer cancelled or refused or given notice that it intends to cancel or refuse any similar insurance for misrepresentation of any material fact in the procurement or renewal of insurance or in the submission of claims?"<br>  In your case, the answer is no. Your son did not deliberately try to misrepresent the information, he simply made a mistake. When you intentionally give incorrect information it is considered misrepresentation.<br>  I've never heard of an insurer refusing a policy because the driver's record is actually better than they stated and the new (better rated) policy is more expensive? That makes no sense to me.

HUluAQM3aa	In all my years of being around vehicles I have never heard of this condition.<br>  I think that vehicle has other issues and not just a faulty ECU.
XNFvoIGxaa	Sorry cant help with the fact that you live in Scotland (LOL) Cameras in my experience are rarely used at night because they don't work real good. Why did you go back? That would make you look guilty if it went to court. Yes they do flash however shouldnt be used once it's properly dark. Twilight is ok and they still work.
7b82464d78bd12dd3fa7c9dd430d9480aa	I usually use wet and dry 800 grade then a finer 1000 grade. The primer will show though as grey.|`|ytgjFFq6aa	use a da sander and get 320 grit to sand the car. your sanding through clearcoat so the dust will be white, if you get to the color the dust will be the color of the car, if your repainting there is no reason to cut through all the clearcoat. just sand and make sure there is no shiny spots left. your original paint alrasy has a sealer underneath the original paint so all you have to do is sand and paint that is unless you take it to metal but thats very unlikely with 320 grit. if there is rock pecks on the hood sand them smooth and if metal is showing just get a can of aerosol sandable primer (they sell at oreillys) and spray those spots and then sand them with 320 and make sure the whole body is smooth. now your ready for paint!<br>  <br>  good luck mate!|`|ezoZkO7gaa	it really all depends on what your trying to do with it.<br>  <br>  if your sanding it down to remove any paint blemishes, such as "orange peel" or heavy scratches/scuffs, you should wet sand with 2000 grit, and then i would suggest that you buff and polish out the faint scratches from sanding.  trust me you will have a very nice glossy shine to it afterward.<br>  <br>  now however, if your looking to repaint it,  start with 180 and work your way up to either 400 or 600 grit.  and also, despite what you may have heard, you do not have to sand down to primer in order to paint a car, you just have to sand the clear coat away (you can tell you have done it because it will look very, very dull when dry).  if you sand all of the glossy clear coat away and your left with just a dull paint, then your set.  throw a couple coats of primer on there and then spray your paint.  but be careful not to sand to far to where the bare metal shows through the paint, because if you do then your going to have to spray some etching primer over the bare metal to protect it from rusting.<br>  <br>  take your time and don't rush.  have fun.
ECLYzIXZaa	I would suggest you get someone who has done this before to help you.|`|TQoM8vCZaa	you bleed the slave cylinder next to the transmission.. there should be a nipple. just put a small hose on the end of the nipple and submerge the other end of the hose into a cup of brake fluid. put a wrench on the nut around the nipple. when an assistant pumps the clutch pedal and holds it down, you loosen the nipple and should see air bubbles in the container of brake fluid. then tighten back up and repeat the steps. dont let the resevoir run dry or youll have to start all over.

6Zflv6cpaa	all vehicles run around 180 F to 192 F .anytime the temp gets out of the normal range on the high side, you should stop ,let the engine cool down ,check coolant level and add if needed otherwise have it towed and have the problem corrected by a mechanic|`|Do0pmMcfaa	no|`|57129a726b95061531a862a37ebbea17aa	modern cars in order to run efficiently and to minimize air pollution need to run above 190F.

v6NdNE4xaa	rear axle mount bushes were very common for this easy fix need some grease remove mounting bolt let the axle down a bit one side at a time load the area which the mount sits into with grease then this should be you. either that or it may be the tailgate needs adjusted or the interior trims  but have the rest of the suspension checked just incase.|`|EmgiGg17aa	the little old lady you got tied up in the trunk?|`|kxs2mzZZaa	the best thing u can do is 2 drive over a bad road and get a mate 2 press in the panels in till the creek has stopd once u found it take the panel off and stick a bit of cardboard behind it or in the gaps of the panel it workd on my fiesta|`|WUA5xdI0aa	I've no idea. It could be your rear suspension but it's probably something quite serios whatever it is. Get it down to your Vauxhall dealer.|`|f6ae2bf2ebd4ad49b32dea3818324e4caa	possibly worn/damaged shock absorber, a broken coil spring or one of the rear axle bushes is worn.
2cbe1bba8389a009e6f7e731cb983e90aa	The shudder you feel when shifting and letting clutch out too slow, is because your flywheel has been overheated and warped from letting clutch out too slow, first I'd stop letting clutch out too slow but the damage is done and the clutch may soon need service. A shudder from not letting engine warm may just be in a tune up. the engine needs more fuel when harming and any restrictions (fuel filter) may cause it to starve for gas and shudder. The best test I can think of to see if your clutch will keep going awhile is to pop the clutch while in second or third while giving alittle gas. if engine stalls then clutch still has time, if engine revs alittle and car starts moving forward then its slipping and you dont have much time|`|uTA2TLC6aa	Sounds more like a misfire due to a bad spark plug (or two). They do tend to make themselves most obvious under load at low revs. Change the plugs and leads - hopefully a cheap fix!|`|Ty32khkaaa	It is good, you just need a tune up. Get new spark plugs, air filter, cap/rotor, fuel filter, and PCV valve. You will get better gas mileage too.|`|jHmepKRMaa	Sounds like the pilot bearing in the flywheel is worn allowing the transmission shaft to wobble.|`|OqQPzYfHaa	It does not sound like a clutch it sounds like your transmition. and i would have an ase certified mechanic check it out before going anywere
v8TWvtQgaa	No they are not the same transmissions. <br>  <br>  1982 and 83 used a th-200 3 speed auto <br>  <br>  The 1984 and up used a 700r4 4 speed overdrive auto. <br>  <br>  You could do the swap but you would need to move the transcrossmember about 3/4" and re drill new holes,  have your driveshaft cut down to the right size, fix up a man controlled torque converter lockup switch, etc etc
TQoM8vCZaa	doesnt sound good at all. it was most likely caused by low oil level and the engine parts got too hot and too much friction. then it wore out some of the bearings. it would really depend on the motor, but i would say take it to a shop and have it diagnosed.|`|XMOwmWM0aa	Yeah to many variables take it to the shop
96b65acfcbdff367c21572dba47ccc2aaa	As far as I know that is normal. A diesel Golf GT will only have TDi on the rear and a small GT badge on the front grill. You should be able to find pics on-line somewhere, maybe even VW's website, if they havn't updated it to the new Golf yet.|`|0Ei3ePJzaa	Hubby dearest says it could have been missold.<br>  <br>  Petrol ones are GTI and diesel ones are GTD.  It should be marked on the vehicle somewhere if not, it's fully possible it's not GT.|`|EmgiGg17aa	Gunter Tergun was sick that day|`|784fbac22b2c480483b2cedc7dbbf3ebaa	Not all GT's have the badge Only the GTi and the TDi have the badge everytime. The TDi takes the place of the GT on his car.|`|kxs2mzZZaa	it could be tha badge was a extra or has fallen off or it aint a GT|`|f6ae2bf2ebd4ad49b32dea3818324e4caa	is it a proper gt? could have been stolen or just not put on to start with.
Rz6k4D8Xaa	it's cheaper to buy a new one but i have an idea you can put<br>  bumper sticker over it to hide the dent or cut or go to a place where<br>  they sell aluminum plates with a cool design and stick it over the dent|`|Ty32khkaaa	Get one from a junk yard for about $50.

AA12201710	the idle is controlled by the computer.a dealer or mechanic shop with the proper diagnstic computer can check the settings.|`|AA11163266	You can't because the ECM controls that.
AA11163266	Just replace the idle air control valve. Very common problem for this to go bad.|`|AA11767990	you probably have a vacuum leak. a vacuum hose may have a hole or break in it.  check all hoses (small ones) and listen for a hissing or sucking sound.<br>   vacum is created by the engine while it is running  while it sucks in air to mix with the fuel to burn.<br>  there is no "vacum" part on your car.....
AA10369772	Is it an OLD vw bug? Porsche left vw back in the 40's(I think) to start making his own cars which he did base off the VW.|`|AA11990068	Some of the engine parts and transmissions will bolt onto a VW, but those would be from an older model Porche.|`|AA11163266	Yes VW or Porsche they are the same crappy cars. Get in a VW that is stick shift and get in a Porsche even some of the new ones like the Carrera and you will see no difference in appearance and feel. Thet both SUCK A*S*S|`|AA11246438	can be possible.especially if it's some kind of jacked up custom deal that he's worked on and modified himself
AA11163266	Have the wiring checked for a short. They may have pinched a wire and pierced through with an object or while puting back on the cluster. Either way take it back to who install the harness to recheck there work.|`|AA11875415	Could be a pinched wire somewhere on the chassis.  Check your wiring on your parking lights.  They use the same circuit as the blinkers.  If one is pinched in the fender and shorted, it will blow the fuse.  It is preventing the wire from catching on fire.|`|e1b9b7be50aaa897b9dadfc98313c2e2aa	it sounds like a short in the wiring, or  maybe a headlight switch.

Take your cross-cable (the one that has sleeves on both ends) an hook one end to the negative connector on battery #1.  Take the other end of that cable and hook it to the positive connector of battery #2.  Now hook the negative cable of  the truck to the negative side of battery #2.  That's it....good luck.

Mecanica rapida y barata y los repuestos los venden en todos lados, si le agragas vidrios polaras y llantas potenciadas y bajas la suspencion ahi cambia la cosa, yo me inclinaria mas por un 128 SE a?o 87 por menos plata y tenes 4 puertas, y si no queres tener problemas de chapa lo mejor es un Uno SCR 93.<br>  El tema de si es lindo o no es mas de gustos personales.|`|849652b8dad4fca65b288d2959317497aa	Depende de que procedencia sea el mismo, si es italiano excelente, brasilero y argentino, ahi! no son malos de mecanica pero! su carroceria es un poco debil, ya que tiende a rajarse en varios lados, y ni te cuento cuando los preparan para que se vean mas deportivos, es decir que los bajan al piso, cambian sus neumaticos y demas, despues de un uso intenso! jajaja quedan detonados!!, pero no deja de ser un auto gauchito! saludos R|`|fc1320fdfa1a3aa4179b596b72a77349aa	Sin ofender: es la peor creaciÃ³n de FIAT, un auto de mala calidad, pobres prestaciones, un nivel de terminaciÃ³n muy bajo y con muchos problemas mecÃ¡nicos debido a los "materiales austeros" con los que es fabricado este coche. y ni hablar si le sumamos los problemas de chapa que trae este auto, sin un mantenimiento adecuado y regular al cabo de unos meses se empiezan a pudrir las terminaciones y los encastres de la chapa.<br>  Saludos!
ddb2954034c7aee855a5e30729197d12aa	you need the downstream o2 if code reads b1s2- the only problem you may run into is getting the o2 from a parts store. unfortunatly some imports are too sensitive to use the aftermarket sensors sold at chain stores.  it will cost more money at the dealer but this is your best bet. computer calibrations are very specific and an aftermarket o2 may set a check engine light.  at the very least if you try the aftermarket sensor always buy a direst fit that does not need to be wired but only plugged in.  they often sell universals that need wires crimped and sodered. never use these!!!|`|AA11163266	This is how it is broken down and I hope you got a proper diagnostic before spending on parts you don't need. Bank1 would be considered where #1 spark plug is located so the exhaust side on the #1 cylinder of engine block. Bank2 would be the other side since it would be the #2 spark plug but in this case it would need to be a "V" type engine. You only have a 4 cylinder it looks like so you only have one exhaust side. Sensor 1 would be the upstream sensor and sensor 2 is the downstream sensor. So the this means you need the down stream sensor.
AA10690406	Is it a 600 or 750 Katana? According to <a href="http://www.nadaguides.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.nadaguides.com</a> the 1998 GSX600FW Katana has an average retail value of  $2,440 and the 1998 GSX750FW Katana has an average retail value of $2,830 ...  <br>  <br>     Average Retail Value â An average retail unit should be clean without obvious defects. All rubber and cables should be in good condition. The paint should match and have a good finish. All lights and switches should work properly. The mileage should be within or slightly higher than the average range. This unit should also pass any emission inspection.  <br>   <br>  Note: These values are for central U.S. retail transactions.|`|3c8bd6a67058475ffdfc9d4003a10505aa	offer him 3k, :)|`|AA10736082	Motorcycles are like music - everybody has a favorite.

2a0cf97ba9aeb2dd30d6ee5a8dd66fc5aa	may not be a good idea to do this, but............................... if your familiar with car wiring, get to parking brake switch, on or very near parking brake and look for a added wire to the factory wire to the switch and disconnect it, most likely will need to ground this wire coming from DVD player and ground it to a good metal ground/bolt. or take it back to the shop or person who installed this and have them do it or ex plane to you how to, should be very easy,hardest part may be getting to the added wire to parking brake switch.ps keep your eyes on the road,be careful!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|3MbzfFahaa	NOT THAT YOU WOULD USE IT GOING DOWN THE STREET OR ANYTHING, BUT WIRE A TOGGLE SWITCH THAT IS AN OPEN CIRCUIT ON ONE END AND A GROUND ON THE OTHER. USE THE PARKING BRAKE WIRE FROM THE JVC, AND CONNECT IT TO THE OPEN END. WHAT YOU WANT IS TO BE ABLE TO TAKE IT OFF GROUND, SO IF YOUR PULLED OVER (WHILE SITTING STILL!), IT WILL PROVE TO THE OFFICER THAT YOU WEREN'T WATCHING IT. WHEN THE CIRCUIT IS CLOSED (ON) IT GOES TO GROUND AND IT WILL PLAY. WHEN OPEN (OFF) IT BREAKS THE GROUND AND WILL PROBABLY SAY SOMETHING LIKE ENJOY THE AUDIO, PICTURE NOT AVAILABLE WHEN MOVING.|`|L7bjIVI8aa	Just Conect It Direct|`|bwfenRZTaa	I had the same issue.  What I did was locate the wire that hooked up to the parking break.  All mine needed was to be hooked up to a ground and it worked without a problem. Find a good place to ground the parking break wire and you should be good to go.

OqCIl735aa	drop hitch or get your plasma cutter out and cut an area for the hitch to be exposed and when your are not using it cap it with a cap painted to match. I believe they sell roll pans with the void and cap already made for a hitch setup. It all depends on if you are lowered, stock, or lifted. Obviously a drop would not work if you are lowered. Check JC Whittney online, they might have something.<br>  <br>  Brandon Wells|`|aa236d66324e04df6dbf17e0670812b0aa	Get a drop hitch!
ABMs5SJaaa	allot of times people find better rates (mainly on used vehicles) than the dealer offers. you should start looking for better rates. try a credit union. you need to make sure you don't end up upside down (owing more than the vehicle is worth) or no bank will help you|`|2634234dd8b943344ddd5e82268d3fa3aa	You have incurred a mistake that no refinancing will alleviate.<br>  <br>  Bankruptcy will occur within 3 years, and I suggest you learn as much as you can about insurance fraud and forensic investigations.

R1dM9oyAaa	check out your manual. Usually within the first chapter it covers that. If you don't have a manual, open the hood and USUALLY the oil dipstick is on the right side (passenger side) of the engine. Usually the handle is yellow. The red or black handle on is for transmission. If it is for transmission it should say "TRANSMISSION"  on it.  Hope this helps good luck!!|`|f2dc7c47627cbc54589cf654e8ba7d03aa	drive into any parts store and say "PLEASE CHECK MY OIL",,,, PROBLEM SOLVED|`|owYlgFqJaa	its under the hood|`|1yKX8fT2aa	The handle is a yellow circle on the passenger side.|`|MFdnDC75aa	all oil dipsticks are marked yellow<br>  they are (if you are looking under hood standing in the front of car)located closest to the front<br>  the trans fluid can be yellow or red and they are closest to the fire wall<br>  if both are yellow oil is marked oil<br>  <br>  if you don't see it it might be missing,especially if it is a used car
b6a91a707fec429b7c881c99de030a66aa	Have you tried doing an online search like "change alternator belt" or "95 mazda protege"?  <br>  <br>  Other than that, I'd try your local library (moreso if you live in a larger town or have one closer) or go to 1/2 Price Books (we have several in Texas - basically buy & sell used bookstore).<br>  <br>  There's also chat sites where you can post auto repair questions.

FTpy9M8raa	should be an 8 lug wheel patteren on the one ton.. the motor is the same as a reg motor .. the problem you are running into is due to the fact not alot of those were sold so the aftermarket parts companys dont make stuff for it ...  car-part.com will find you used parts accross the nation ...  and a good dealer will locate new parts for your truck
3VHk9K00aa	No way they will go down, they will most likely go up. Just because you will have to roll over your negative equity, and pay taxes,tags, and fees all over again.<br>  Good Luck<br>  <br>  10 yrs in the biz|`|AA12164734	Maybe. If you owe more than the value of the truck then you'll have to roll that into the new one...meaning your payments will rise. The only way for payments to drop is to reduce the amount of money you borrow.<br>  Example:<br>  Your Trailblazer is worth $10000. You owe $11000. <br>  The Silverado sells for $11000. You'll need to borrow $12000 to cover the shortfall in the Trailblazer.<br>  Don't take a loan for more than 48 months on a 4 year old truck. To go back to the example, $12000 at 9% for 4 years is $298.62|`|b0deb4f7788dc013f888122cd33c99bdaa	Odds are good they won't go down. If you owe 15000 on a vehicle that is worth 10,000, you will have to add the remaining 5000 to the loan on the new vehicle.<br>  Unless your new loan will be less than the original loan, the payments will be more.
