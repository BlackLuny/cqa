Gw1LLzDgaa	As long as you live in fear of what others will think -- you cannot know what you are.  You have to accept yourself, without conditions  -- and when you genuinely have done so -- you won't worry about what you feel, you will just feel them.  THEN you can look and see what you are feel.

If you want a relationship with a girl, then be with a girl.  If you fantasize about guys then just leave it at that, a fantasy.   No one has to know but you.

I really don't like the idea of my boyfriend watching naked women do over the top acts without me. I'm not a prude by any means, but when your with me you get enough sex so why bother?<br>  <br>  My ex found this difficult, but I told him he didn't need it and it was a waste of time.  He argued with me and said he couldn't masturbate without it, which is ridiculous, because my new boyfriend uses his imagination.  No matter what they say, they don't need it at all.  Think about it, what did they do in the old days, before the internet, T.V., and Playboy?  They used there imagination! DUH GUYS!!!<br>  <br>  Plus I know men who just are addicted and it's disgusting, it is a TOTAL turn off.  Why "pretend?"

T2JBX5Ataa	I don't know about back then but more recently they ordered a sunni student to be put to death. See Below<br>  <br>  They burn down masjids. I mean we know that the Shi'a have been aligning with the Jews over fellow Muslims for along time, all the while blaming the Salafi's for all the disunity and pretending to want brotherhood with easily fooled Sunni's.<br>  <br>  <br>  . Educational discrimination against the Sunnis of Iran<br>  <br>  There are 44,000 students in Iranian Baluchistan universities. Even 4, 000 of them are not Sunni Baluch. The Iranian government deliberately does not allow the Sunni Baluch of Iran to enter universities freely. This is while, according to one United Nations research, the Baluch children are the most talented children in Iran. This policy is pursued in all other Sunni dominated areas. Only in one county of Baluchistan, there are 500 schools which are built with cardboards and tents.<br>  <br>  <br>  2. Political discrimination against the Sunnis of Iran<br>  <br>  Since the beginning of the revolution, the Shia regime of Iran has not allowed even one Sunni to become prime minister, president, minister, an army general, and an ambassador. There is not even one single Sunni in Iranian Foreign Ministry. There is not even one Sunni chief executive in the whole country. All the officials in the Sunnis provinces and cities are the Shias who have been appointed by the Shia government.<br>  <br>  3. Religious discrimination against the Sunnis of Iran<br>  <br>  The Iranian media and leaders cite every day dozens of insulting remarks about the principles of Sunni religion. They have published hundreds of books which discredit the most important values of Islam. Even the Iranian government has built recently a huge temple to promote Abu Lo Lo, the killer of Omar, the second Caliph, as a great Islamic figure. The regime celebrates every year the murder of Omar by staging some ceremonies in which his effigy is burnt in public.<br>  <br>  There are about one million Sunnis in Tehran, the capital of Iran, but the Iranian authorities do not allow them to build even one mosque. They are not allowed to perform their prayers in other Shia mosques. When they try to perform Friday prayers in parks, the security forces attacked them.<br>  <br>  4. Economic discrimination against the Sunnis of Iran<br>  <br>  99% of the Iranian businesses are under the control of the Shia population of Iran while 30% of Iranian population is Sunni. The government creates every barrier for the Sunnis to stop them from starting or developing their businesses. The major import and export licences are allocated to the Shia business. Even in the main cities of Sunnis, all the facilities of business are given to the Shias to deliberately impoverish the Sunni population of Iran. 70% to 80% of Sunnis are unemployed.<br>   <br>  I think that makes it pretty clear. Even though it most Sunni Majority Countries Shi'a are treated fairly well.<br>  <br>  1. Pakistan<br>  <br>  Everybody knows Bhtto family in Pakistan. They are a Shia family but they have governed Pakistan three times. There have been other Shia presidents and prime ministers in Pakistan. The Shias in Pakistan enjoy complete equality in a Sunni dominated country. There have been many Shia ministers in all governments of Pakistan from the beginning of Pakistan up to now. There are Shia army generals, there are Shia ambassadors and diplomats and there are big Shia businessmen. They have their own mosques. There are Shias in different levels of civil service too.<br>  <br>  2. Afghanistan<br>  <br>  There are several Shia ministers in Afghan government. There have been always Shia ministers in various Afghan regimes. There are Shia governors in Afghanistan. There are Shia army generals in Afghanistan. There are very rich Shia businessmen in Afghanistan too.<br>  <br>  3. Kuwait<br>  <br>  There are two Shia ministers in Kuwait. There are many Shia generals in Kuwait army. There are many Shia diplomats in the Foreign Ministry. There are many Shia businessmen in Kuwait. They have their mosques and they are free to perform their prayers.<br>  <br>  4. The state of Qatar<br>  <br>  There are dozens of Shia ministers, army generals, ambassadors, businessmen and high officials in Qatar and other Arab countries.<br>  <br>  While we see that there are so many Shia high officials in Islamic and Arab world, why there is not even one single high official from the Sunnis in Iran? Why there is so much discrimination against the Sunnis in a regime that claims to embody Islamic justice, Islamic equality and brotherhood? And why there is so much silence about the exclusions of Sunnis from all sources of power in Iran? If the Shia government of Iran is fighting for the rights of Shias everywhere, why the Sunni governments of the world are not fighting for the rights of Sunnis in Iran?|`|xTRMSm7yaa	yeah cause im sure u lived there and knew every little bit, have u lived there? did u witness that stuff there?<br>  <br>   maaaaan u guys will come up with any crap just to have  reason to HATE....all u ever spread is HATE... all u ever talk about is HATE....hate Shias hate Shias and some more hating Shias....|`|nS7koC7Oaa	They are in jail, do you think Sunnis are happy in Iran?<br>  <br>  may Allah (swt) send down peace to their hearts,,|`|hP7edhKYaa	OMG WILL U STOP?? leave all this sect business no one cares...<br>  <br>  As for those who divide their religion and break up into sects, thou hast no part in them in the least: their affair is with Allah: He will in the end tell them the truth of all that they did. <br>  <br>  Chapter 6. v 159 xD<br>  <br>  if the QURAN -ALLAHS WORD say that then stop causing a fuss its being dealt with  Allah not u.. so even if people are gettin imprisoned in iran.. all this sect stuff.. omg chill people lol <br>  <br>  LOL at pedram ty :P sorry for the mess up xD looool<br>  <br>  @ asker wth My name is tania :Z pedram isnt me loool ask any other user i chat to on msn :P  salaams|`|4ViYw6Hxaa	they still live there<br>  <br>  NOTE: You are just a loser|`|e3PWZYsAaa	please speak about somethin i wouldn't know about.......<br>  <br>  it's MY country, i lived there for YEARS.......<br>  ......i know how it's like there<br>  <br>  in Iran, nothing happens to sunnis......<br>  .....they just live their lifes like Shias do<br>  <br>  in fact there are about 1 or 2 citys in Iran (one being Ahwaz or Ahvaz) which has a lot of sunnis......<br>  <br>  they're living their lifes just like others do..........<br>  <br>  <br>  who ever says they're injail is a laier.......<br>  .......even jews live in Iran with peace.<br>  <br>  <br>  so just you know.......<br>  ......Shias consider sunnis as their brothers and sisters<br>  but it's always wahabis like you who try to make fitna<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  <br>  actually there is a user here called "sunni iranian".....<br>  .......she's a sunni muslim, but she's Iranian<br>  why don't you ask her how it's like to be a sunni in Iran?

You realize that you only have this life to live, that "now" is the only time you'll be with you friends and family.<br>  <br>  You see "right & wrong" in function of what is best for humanity's best interest. Actions are viewed as if yes or no they will harm someone. Are you really helping people or are you just making yourself feel better.<br>  <br>  Of course, it's a lot of responsibility... I think not everyone can handle it...  There is no comfort being an Atheist, no book you can turn too, no promises of Eternal life or Justice.<br>  <br>  I think religions can bring people together and comfort them... but they are mostly about power: who has it and who submits to it.

But a deity that asks for worship is immoral, so this premise is distasteful at best. <br>  <br>  Some people confuse religion with morality, but goodness exists outside of religion. Before there were Christians, Muslim, Buddhists, good people existed. Morality comes from understanding the human experience, understanding what is hurtful and what is kind. <br>  <br>  A modern world will emerge one day and belief in religion will only exist in uneducated pockets of the world.|`|etXYn0sCaa	I subscribe to the theory of evolution - a well rounded, comprehensive and satisfying explanation that is backed up by a wealth of mutually supporting evidence. <br>  Religions tend to offer antiquated rhetoric from anonymous semi literate men from dead cultures that hold up blind faith as a virtue and offer no evidence for their claims beyond the ascertation "Its the word of god because it says its the word of God'<br>  If people feel better following blatant untruths thats fine - get in the way of science when it's trying to bring our understanding of the universe forward, and you can expect to get ***** slapped out of the way without so much as an apology- its too important and has too much riding on it to worry about the feelings of a few misguided fools who only seem capable of taking offence and starting wars.|`|Im9cwUIyaa	There are many different paths to God.

ombfkcfNaa	There is no such thing as coincidence. Aren't people's lives in the hands of Allah? It is fate and destiny. It is easy to think, "Oh, what a coincidence!" Especially when it seems so much like it. With that in mind, if you think about such occurrences a lot then it might seem as a sign. I mean, if I wanted something, I wouldn't stop because of a "coincidence" that seemed like a sign. It's really a tricky topic, because sometimes you have to submit and say, it might be for the best. Then later on in your life you would remember giving up for something you wanted then but somehow, after some time, it truly is waaaaay better than what you wanted! I had that happen so many times and every time I'm more astounded! <br>  <br>  Indeed, everything is fate and destiny because if you really think deeper and trace such "coincidences", you'll find a pattern that would seem so much more complex than mere coincidence. Subhan Allah. You seem to be a lucky person, mashallah, for having signs that seem to be the result of an istkhara (which you never did ;P) to help you. Inshallah always :)|`|7dGpL4mSaa	They are a sign from allah!

I do know there's Christian hiphop, metal, rock...|`|lG7HdW6Gaa	I've thought the same thing actually. I love that genre of music and would love it even more if there was a Christian group that did that. <br>  <br>  There are preconceived notions that those things are associated with night clubs and there are potentially immoral and illegal things that go on in them, so I could see why no one has done something like that yet. It's hard to break down that kind of negative barrier and give a positive image to techno/trance/electronica music. <br>  <br>  If I had the programs and instruments for making that kind of music, I would do it.|`|jsM8F4bLaa	my favorite genre. <br>  <br>  And they do have some, it's just not that known.

2DahzSWvaa	Heck no it's not popular in Muslim culture. Homosexuals are stoned to death, and killed.|`|vTra7n5baa	People are homosexual in every culture.  No more in one than in another, biologically speaking.  Now, in Muslim cultures people don't exhibit this for fear of extreme punishment.  <br>  <br>  In any culture where men and women are segregated from each other, they will inevitably be sexually attracted.  Look at Ancient Greece.  While the men were "competing" in the Olympics, the women went to the island of Lesbos for "poetry readings."  I think we know what else they were doing too.|`|i0JQoLaIaa	I think they are "gay" in an Ancient Greece kind of way. That makes more sense to me than all the negative answers that say that the Christian West and the Islamic world are the same kind of homophobic and misogynist thing, when they are in fact opposites in many ways. Muslim women aren't allowed to use their feminine wiles and Western men aren't allowed to hold hands without being gay.|`|FHLKpNv4aa	No.in the middle east they actually bury them alive.|`|4uUHoddEaa	what you got a find another way to word that|`|qDFeUbM0aa	Homosexuals are usually either treated VERY badly or even killed in the Islamic culture. Also women are not thought of  as ugly! They wear long black cloths that cover them from head to toe and are only allowed to show their face at the absolute most to protect their beauty. Its kinda like they value personality over beauty but they are treated unfairly in many other aspects of their culture.|`|376ce902307f5e574ed98c7f99ccba8daa	What? Women are seen as ugly in Islamic culture? Where DO you get your information? It's quite the opposite really. Women are treated horribly, but they are told to wear covering garments largely because it is believed they are so beautiful that they will distract men and cause social calamity - such as the kind they complain about pervading the West. <br>  <br>  Also, MANY cultures if not MOST teach that women are below men. Look at Judaism and Christianity. They both teach that women are to be below or behind men. That doesn't make Jewish or Christian cultures gay-friendly. That doesn't make the men in those cultures gay. Many straight men LIKE the idea of a woman being behind them - they want her to shut up and stand back. This has nothing to do with homosexuality. This is heterocentrism, and misogyny.
9g8spRvPaa	Yes in some ways but many immigrants can see the opportunities that people born here don't see.<br>  My husband came to the USA when he was 23 and didn't speak or understand more then two words of English.<br>  he came from a former communist country.<br>  His first hardship was trying to survive on his own without language skills.<br>  That was his number one priority, to learn the language and customs here.<br>  You lose a few years when you are an immigrant by trial and error but if you stay strong, you can catch up to anyone here.<br>  We know many immigrant people that have become millionairs in the USA by hard work and by being strong without cheating or stealing.|`|ohUm00RYaa	Nobody has it harder than a Mexican American, because you have to be a mexican and an american.|`|7d866ea2a2dff3d3d77ce1b12a4e11c8aa	No, I don't believe so.|`|VMY7No0eaa	DEPENDING on if you are LEGAL or illegal.<br>  If you are legal then you can do just about anything a citizen does.<br>  <br>  Illegal - you get the left overs... and people who did it the right way want you gone!

Tell her shes not your type!|`|YIOIUZZlaa	just sit her down and tell her you only love her as a friend hope it works out :)|`|2DahzSWvaa	Tell her that her breaths stinks. I've learned that telling someone that their breath stinks in public in front of a large group of people hurts  them deeply. She'll most likely never want to talk to you again.|`|4uUHoddEaa	tell her how you feel say you like her as a friend an friend only if she has a blank look on her face then kiss her lol who will it hurt|`|hhJrwRNdaa	Tell her exactly what you said in the details of your question.

Oh, and theres the fact that I can't buy alcohol on Sunday's. The day I say religion isn't negative is the day religion stops affecting my life in negative ways.|`|7d84621e89c49bcba037226d3361c90baa	Well, for starters:<br>  <br>  Religion is negative because of the fact that theists consistently try to push their religious dogma into our laws, schools, and government. It's negative because theists tell people who are dying of AIDS and starvation that using condoms is wrong because there’s a magical being in the sky (God) who just might want to give them a baby that's going to die of AIDS or starvation in six months. It's negative because school boards all across this country are STILL -- more than 80 years after the Scopes trial -- having to spend time and money and resources that are ALREADY in short supply on the fight to have evolution taught in the schools because religion tells people to ignore and deny facts and evidence in favor of superstition. It's negative because these theists are trying to tell our children that the Earth is less than 10,000 years old, and that humans walked with dinousaurs, despite the fact that not only is there not a *single* scrap of evidence to back up such a claim, but ALL of the evidence points AGAINST it.  (And it's negative because this attitude gives our children the impression that it's OK to not expect someone to provide evidence behind claims that they make, and it gives our children the impression that scientific fact can be ignored or denied and replaced with whatever information you want if you don't LIKE what it *actually* tells you.) It's negative because theists treat the gaps in science and scientific knowledge as somehow proof of the existence of God, and despite a thousands-of-years-old pattern of supernatural explanations being consistently and repeatedly replaced with natural ones, they still think every single unexplained phenomenon can be best explained by God. And it's negative because, whenever a gap in our knowledge does get filled in, believers either try to suppress it (see above re: evolution in the schools), or else say, "Okay, that part of the world isn't supernatural... but what about this gap over here? Can you explain that, Mr. Smarty-Pants Scientist? You can't! It must be God!" <br>  It's negative because there are people on this planet who will actually fly airplanes into buildings full of people because they have FAITH that they're going to get 72 virgins in some magical paradise for doing so.  And it's negative because religion has started more wars throughout history than ANY other reason.<br>  It's negative because people will use their religious literature as an excuse to deny other people their rights.<br>  It's negative because in a lot of areas in this country, if a person is daring enough to actually admit publicly that they are an atheist, they can FULLY expect to be harassed, discriminated against, and even lose their jobs, have their property damaged, and be physically assaulted.<br>  It's negative because so many religious leaders opportunistically use religion, and people's trust and faith in religion, to steal, cheat, lie, manipulate the political process, take sexual advantage of their followers, and generally behave like the scum of the earth. And despite the fact that this happens OVER and OVER and OVER again, theists will still say that *atheism* is bad because, "without religion, people would have no basis for morality or ethics, and no reason not to just do whatever they wanted."<br>  It's negative because theists love to say smug, sanctimonious things like, "atheists are only atheists because they don't want to have anyone to answer to", and "all atheists cry out to God on their deathbeds", and will even say that they “can’t wait to see the look on your faces when you face God and he casts you into the pit!” while at the same time claiming to be so caring and "filled with God's love".<br>  If other people's religious beliefs did not affect us and our lives, we wouldn't care. But it does. So we do.|`|rGEZup0Zaa	Atheism deals with deities, not religion.<br>  <br>  Most Buddhists are atheists, and yet have no problem with religion.<br>  <br>  That said, religion encourages ignorance. It stops discovery, it divides people.|`|X1jupF0paa	It is easier to mock something than to understand it.<br>  I think the majority of atheists on this site are just wannabe commodians.|`|2h8tqOeFaa	Because its not what they believe in, so they ridicule at mock it at any given chance they get, most answers here are documented proof of this..|`|WYk0zYdhaa	I as a Christian dislike the word religion as well.  A lot of horrible things have been done in the name of religion thus giving it a very negative context.  <br>  <br>  However, I think I know what you mean,  I'm not an atheist so cannot answer for those that are of that view.  I have friends that are though and they tell me because they don't want to believe in a God that would send people to hell.  There are many reasons though just as there are many reasons to believe :)  <br>  <br>  Lee Strobel a well known journalist and Ex-Atheist said that he didn't support theism because he thought that evolution had too much credibility.  It was only after he went to start looking for all the evidence (which he expected to be scads of) that he started re-thinking that view.  He ended up investigating the bible using his journalistic skills and many many external sources in order to dis-prove God.  Eventually this led him to accept Christ and write several books on the subject.  Today he is a top apologist writing books to expose the fallicies of evolution and claims against the bible.|`|e8UujnJnaa	because religion is a negative thing|`|idmgvLfRaa	We don't - believers do that themselves!|`|f522078ffdf8786fcab6f8023c6befbdaa	Most religious human beings do so out of love and geniunely good intentions.  Unfortunately, those who do so, generally do so quietly.

Also, they believe that the differing beliefs between religious groups are what cause most conflicts in the world. <br>  <br>  I'm atheistic, but I don't see religion as a necessarily regative thing. I think the fact that religions have existed nearly as long as humanity has is testiment that people 'need' something to believe in to give them comfort and security in their lives. So I'm fairly neutral about it - on the one had you're believe something that might not be ture, but on the other it's making you happier/more confident about your life/whatever. But it's when religions try to force their beliefs on others that they can become a negative thing.|`|UO3i8BqVaa	LuLz<br>  You do that very well yourselves; you need no help from us.<br>  ~|`|3e9cd86e32403818853bca17334a00abaa	Look at all the harm it has done.|`|tdJuvdeXaa	I (an atheist) have absolutely no problem with religion. I don't see it as a negative thing at all. In fact, I think it can be a wonderful support system and way to guide oneself through life with good moral.<br>  However, I am simply unable of believing in God, and I personally think that the Abrahamic religions are all on the shaky side. There are many commands from the Christian, Muslim, and even Jewish gods to do things that I dont think most of us consider moral. (E.g, stoning adulterers and disobedient children, keeping slaves...etc) And seriously, a God should be morally superior to humans. So I choose not to follow any of those religions because I think if you believe in  God(s), you should follow his/her/its/their instructions and commands entirely rather than just picking out the ones you agree with. After all, an almighty God can never be wrong.<br>  <br>  Take a look at history, though. In my opinion, religion has done more harm than good in the world.|`|aTh1nyBbaa	Because they can't understand why we can have faith in something that THEY can't grasp.

Obviously, atheists who belong to religions don't view religion as a negative thing.  Buddhism has room for atheists, theistic beliefs aren't required or encouraged in Taoism, LeVeyan Satanism is an atheistic religion, and the Country of China is largely atheistic, but filled with various forms of ritualized ancestor veneration and Confucianism.  And there are, as evidenced by the attendance on this forum, tons of unaffiliated atheists who are nonetheless fascinated by the religious mind, and don't make value judgements about all religions.<br>  <br>  Now, perhaps you'd like to ask why does it SEEM like many American and Western European Atheists are Anti-Christian?  But that's an entirely different question.|`|3ZgOAUOTaa	atheists don't make religion anything; they just point out what it is|`|s1zitZMOaa	Huh? <br>  <br>  How can I, an atheist, make your religion into something it's not? I can ask questions about religion. I can criticize religion. I can point out fallacies within religion and I can list atrocities committed in the name of and at the hands of religion. But I am not able to make religion negative. I can't change what religion is. I can only have opinions about religion and point out facts about it - which I do. If you think religion is a negative thing, that is your opinion.|`|f3nwI8ytaa	Because they want to be their own boss.

X8kP7G5Saa	So called Muslims, why do you not read your books before you speak on matters that you have little knowledge over. In your all consuming hatred against a group of follow Muslims, you are blinded and do not accord the love, respect and veneration that you were supposed to have for the Holy Prophet SAW. Such ingratitude...<br>  <br>  For the followers of the sunnah of the Prophet SAW (see below). Accordingly, the death anniversary is being observed, for there has never been and never will be a greater being in all of Allah's SWT creation.<br>  <br>  Ibn Ishaq writes, "After the death of Khadija, who was the supporter of Muhammad and his Message, calamities successively overtook the Prophet of Allah. His troubles in that year reached such an extent (with the death of Abu Talib) that this period became known as 'the year of sorrow'".

Abu Malik alAsh'ari reported that the Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "Four practices of the pre-Islamic days of Ignorance will continue to be practiced by my ummah: taking pride in one's parentage, giving a person a father other than his own genealogical father, believing that rain is caused by some stars, and wailing over the dead." He further said: "A (professional) mourner, unless she repents before her death, will be raised on the Day of Judgement wearing a garment of tar and an armor of blistering puss."

'The American Dream' is one of those phrases politicians use but deliberately don't define.  So everyone with different ideas of what that phrase means thinks the politician is talking about -his- version.<br>  <br>  To me, the American Dream is social mobility.  We've always prided ourselves on this.  The idea that any kid, no matter how rich or poor his parents are, can get a good education, can pull himself out of poverty to become a doctor or lawyer or businessman and live in a good neighborhood.  We were the first country with social mobility, no fixed class system.  We invented it.  But today maybe 10-15 countries do it better than we do.  And conservatives who talk the most about The American Dream are the ones who most want to defund the public education system to keep people in their place.  (Maybe I should say 'Republicans' instead of 'conservatives' because social mobility really used to be a big part of the conservative outlook.)<br>  <br>  Most us, just about everyone in the US, is three generations or less from the 'old country'.  Our grandparents came here in an almost desperate condition, often with not much more than the clothes they were wearing. But they had a dream!  (cue the violins here).  They came here to work their butts off and our family history works up from there.  We have ALL done a lot better, some more than others.  THAT is the American Dream.|`|b8e7225eb1b9214f4836b0310368ade6aa	Nothing, if you are speaking of the original idea behind the phrase. It was much more consolidated, and predicated on personal responsibility and effort, and frankly did not ask for much. What some people, and mass media portray it as today is unreasonable, unsustainable and bankrupt. Get as much as you can as soon as you can, and at somebody else's expense and effort if you can. That notion is indeed self destructive and cannot go on forever as we are seeing. Whether you are a lazy welfare cheat of a motivated corporate cheat, you're still a cheat, and are preying on the rest of us who just want to make our own way in this world, and have the freedom to take care of ourselves. that's part of the original American Dream.|`|N53y9qohaa	Hello,<br>  <br>  Well as some well to do say, there has to be winner and losers in this system and philosophy but as of late there are far too many losers.<br>  <br>  Cheers,<br>  <br>  Michael Kelly|`|fqRBdOWLaa	It's becoming reality!|`|HPqCRBq8aa	Nobody's asleep anymore.|`|rZWEFz4Qaa	i was born in france, and moved to new york when i was seven.<br>  as far as i'm concerned, i love the US,<br>  and everything it stands for.|`|5q0Fhxpgaa	The American dream is just a fantasy for most people.|`|2980af5b4722d033c6edc3ef6f679894aa	It requires perfection

WmU7jhObaa	Saleh(as) was from the city of Thamud. some time after Allah swt punished AD. the villagers were worshiping idols and forgot about Ad. so god commanded Saleh(as) to warn the people about god. Saleh (as) told his fellow villagers what they wanted as proof of god, so they agreed that they would belief if god made a pregnant She-camel. so Saled(as) prayed and bam a pregnant she-camel came out. the villagers were no turning evil so they plotted to kill the she-camel who supplied the village with milk. they killed the she-camel and god ordered Saleh(as) to leave. god punished Thamud with a dangerous Whirlwind.|`|aRaMjnQ1aa	The Prophet Salih (PBUH) was commissioned by God to invite the tribe to the worship of One God but the tribe turned a deaf ear to the Prophet's preaching. Finally, the tribe decided to kill the Prophet. The Almighty fixed a she-camel as a sign and warned them if they slew her, they would be overtaken by the chastisement from God. Prophet Salih (PBUH) asked the tribe to be kind to the she-camel and let her graze in the pastures and drink water from the spring but the tribesmen denied the access, instead they slaughtered the she-camel.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  From the Quran:<br>  <br>  Some references regarding the Prophet Salih (PBUH) and his people are as follows:<br>  "And to the Thamud We sent their brother Salih. He said: O my people: Serve The Almighty. You have no God other than Him. Clear proof, indeed, has come to you from your Lord. This is The Almighty's she-camel for you, a sign. Therefore, leave her alone to pasture on the Almighty's Earth and do not do her any harm. Otherwise painful chastisement will overtake you. And remember when He has made you the successors after 'Ad and settled you in the land. You made mansions on its plains and hew out houses in the mountains: remember, therefore, The Almighty's benefits and do not act corruptly in the land making any mischief. The Chiefs of those who behaved proudly among his people said to those who were considered weak, to those who believed from among them. Are you sure that Salih is sent by his Lord? They said: Surely we are the believers in what he has been sent with. Those who were haughty said: Surely we deny of what you believe in. So they slew the she-camel and revolted against their Lord's Commandments and they said: O Salih! Bring us of what you have threatened us with if you are one of the Apostles. Then the earthquake overtook them so they became motionless bodies in their abodes." (Qur'an 7:73-78)
WmU7jhObaa	god send Shoaib(as) to his brothers in Madyan. god told Shoaib(as) that if his people do not stop practicing dirty business transaction(Interest) that he will punish them. Shoaib(as) tried his best to warn them but the Madyan people where very cocky and stubborn so they did not listen to him. Allah swt sends an earthquake to teach the Madyan's a listen<br>  <br>  <br>  Good answer Mr. Yasin|`|aRaMjnQ1aa	Our prophet Shu'ayb was an eloquent orator. His proofs were strong, for he spoke in the name of truth and justice, He spoke in the language of pure nature.<br>  Our prophet Shu'ayb summoned his people to serve Allah, the One and only and to refrain from worshipping idols. Then he calmly talked about corrupt markets and cheating in buying and selling.<br>  Our prophet Shu'ayb said to his people: "With these acts of yours you will spread corruption. Social life depends on exchanging commodities. You must exchange your commodities with each other.<br>  "Exchanging commodities in the market requires public security. This public security will keep the weight, quality, and quantity of all commodities.<br>  "Beware of cheating both buyer and seller. Be careful not to decrease the weight of the commodities you sell. Do not take good commodities for bad ones. If you do not refrain from these deeds, Allah, the Glorified, will destroy your houses."<br>  Prophet Shu'ayb words were very sweet. The Prophet used such words because he wanted the people of Madyan to lead a better life. He wanted them to live in a village full of good, livelihood, peace, and faith.<br>  Our prophet Shu'ayb knew what had afflicted the people of Noah, Salih, and Hud. He knew that Allah, the Glorified, had destroyed Noah's people with the flood, Thamud's tribe with storms, Sodom and Gomorrah (two tribes at the Dead Sea) with meteors.<br>  Shu'ayb said to his people: "Allah destroyed Lot's people because they disobeyed their prophet."

If these guys are just friends or people at school or whatever, they are showing that they have less respect for women by doing so.  If you let them or encourage them to do so, you only affirm their belief that women are objects for them to enjoy and take advantage of instead of knocking the respect they need to give you into their thick, cro-magnon skulls.<br>  <br>  As a woman or girl you are deserving of equal respect to any male out there, don't give them an excuse to continue their misogynistic behaviour.

Just use discretion. Don't let just any guy do that to you (to eliminate the sl*t factor), pick ones that you actually like.

Thus, eleven is literally "one-left" (over, that is, past ten), and twelve is "two-left" (over past ten).|`|7dGpL4mSaa	LOL!

Be honest with yourself.|`|H8WqMK1eaa	Your unbelief does not effect my life at all...unless you try to force me to not believe...or some such thing.<br>  <br>  That doesn't mean I don't care about you.<br>  <br>  But if you are completely and utterly happy in your life...content in knowing that this life is exactly as it seems and nothing else...then good for you. :)<br>  <br>  Jesus came not for the healthy, but for the sick.  And if you think you're healthy, why would you go to a doctor?|`|UWKF7x4faa	The same way as a Yankee fan I cannot in good conscience see eye to eye with a die-hard chicago fan(i.e. - your profile)|`|PKULDaC7aa	They feel like its up to them to "save" everyone on the planet. That is where their religion interferes with my daily life. Christians: WE DON'T WANT SAVING!<br>  <br>  I like SanJose's answers below. (I have done drugs and gone to strip joints with plenty of Christians)|`|i48kxrbaaa	None whatsoever.<br>  That's why I don't care if you believe in the toothfairy, sonic the hedgehog, or nothing at all.|`|g0lKlQGnaa	It doesnt<br>  <br>  Maybe the same should be asked to the atheists though.  Many of them seem to care a great deal|`|MtweOtuLaa	It doesn't effect me greatly, but it saddens me.<br>  Why do you atheists care so much about disproving God?|`|0lpXN8p9aa	I Love and care for you, no matter what you believe!|`|Lgmg6uYKaa	We try because we are required too.<br>  <br>  Trust me, I have a natural tendency to not give a flying you-know-what about what happens to you especially when this question was obviously done in a mocking way.<br>  <br>  But Christians try because they want you to spend eternity with them. They want you to see that God is not as much of a figment as people have made him out to be. Some Christians go about it the wrong way of course, but at least give them credit for being concerned about your sorry existence to try in the first place.<br>  <br>  But whatever, like I said I probably -under normal circumstances-   couldn't care less what happens to you, but because I am a Christian I am required too care. I was changed into being part of something great that, wether you like it or not, I am going to act on.<br>  <br>  So in the end, your "not believing in God" affects my life because it is my responsibility to care. I've never met you yet I'm taking the time to explain this to you. <br>  <br>  But by all means, if you want to market your useless existence then go right ahead. In the end it's just faith and the willingness to accept the fact that there will always be things you won't be able to understand. That's called faith. I hope you find it someday. Truly.|`|5163421430fada657d83a91148b438e2aa	It does not.Jesus cares and wishes that no one should perish, cause He loves you.What you choose is your choice.I'll love ya anyway|`|AA11120822	This is the part where they tell you all about how wonderfully righteous and selfless they are because they want to save your wretched atheist soul from eternal fiery damnation.<br>  But mostly, their motivation is to get you in a pew dropping money in the plate so they can improve their own social standing in the church and help solidify their own place in the afterlife.|`|67EaIAvbaa	none..your not that important.|`|QuaVnaOEaa	It affects me in no way at all. I'm just taking care of may own *ss. I don't try to convert, I'm just a follower because it gives me comfort without proof and hard thinking.....same as Santa Claus and elves ....And because I end up doing good things for other people without exercising judgment....|`|9ntoGPFyaa	thank you!!!! I'm a heretic now, and life is a lot better for me!|`|AA11346514	Christ has directed that we "go into all the world and preach the gospel."  He has also directed that we love our friends and our enemies.  If I don't at least try, I am not doing my job.  If I truly love you then I must try to get you to believe in the love of God and Jesus Christ.|`|HDeUYCnXaa	LOVE to see the answers to this.<br>  <br>  EDIT: thank you michell7. people should follow her example|`|1BXHUjqIaa	It has no affect on my life at all. I would certainly hope that the life you are leading is a happy one - if you're happy, more power to you. I don't need others to believe in what I believe in. Just not a priority.|`|rqwXqmyTaa	I don't care.  The question can go right back to you.  No matter what jind of question I ask towards a Christian there are usually a dozen atheists that make a smart reply to something that I believe.|`|pxgIsS0Maa	I'll tell you, but I'm only going to explain this once.<br>  <br>  Evangelism.  You'd be much happier, fulfilled, and most importantly eternally secure, if you knew Our Creator!|`|rWP4suXuaa	God so loved you that he gave his only begotten son and if you believe in him you shall not parish John 3:16 "Love is the effect on life" Accept jesus and live he is your only hope"<br>  <br>  <br>  God loves you....God bless|`|sebhK7r7aa	We want to save you from Hell. It's a very real place, and if you don't accept Jesus, that's where you'll end up.|`|KhJwOurLaa	Funny how the get all hysterical when atheists respond in kind.|`|ggwsClQBaa	Well, I'm going to answer this taking neither side.<br>  Some Christians may feel challenged by atheist belief. Nobody wants to have a belief questioned or turned down, and often someone in this position will become defensive and then offended. So when a Christian tries to convince you of God, it may be that they are reaffirming their own belief to themselves, kinda like when you say something enough times you start to believe it yourself. I'm not sure otherwise, I basically think they are defending themselves more than trying to "save" you. <br>  Good question!|`|8f1i9DWyaa	God is love; and we love like God does, only we are not capable of loving as much as God does. But we care about people.<br>  God has a wonderful plan for your life; God is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him. Don't you want to know what God created you for? I was so glad when I found out. It is so much bigger than what I thought of for myself and it fulfills my heart's longings.<br>  This life is only a dressing room for eternity. It is only 70 years maybe a bit longer. Eternity is forever and goes on and on. You need to get ready for eternity now, here on earth. Spend your time on earth, getting ready for eternity.|`|279ac5587c0a982b23b03bde3f0bbf91aa	Great question! <br>   atheist|`|ORDjVHY4aa	It does not effect my existence now or later. It effects yours.<br>  <br>  If you could tell the people from the world trade center buildings to not go to work on 9-11 wouldn't you do it? <br>  <br>  I bet many of those people you warned would laugh at you and tell you, you have no proof, and die anyway.  I'll bet you would have heard, let me live my own life.|`|L81GyNmjaa	I do not wish for you to go to Hell. Simple enough?|`|CEQpDpnPaa	because i hope to see you in heaven|`|664ef7ac282ab7a5fe638caafbfb05b3aa	It grieves me greatly when I think about how much God loves us (you and me), loving us enough to send His Son Jesus (the Christ) to earth to pay the price for our sins that we could not pay, and yet many poo poo that sacrifice and love.<br>  <br>  I am happy that other people loved me enough to teach me about Jesus, what He has done for me and what I must do to accept that gift.  It would have been much easier for those people that taught me to just watch TV, listen to the radio, play sports, etc. instead of giving me their time.  I am eternally grateful for their patience on not giving up on me even though I was not an easy sell -- I was enjoying sinning too much to admit I was wrong.<br>  <br>  Now, I have been developing that love for others, no matter how difficult it is at times.  I owe it to God for His love He has shown for me & others, and I owe it to the people that "wasted" their valuable time on me.<br>  <br>  I will not give up trying to make the sacrifice of Jesus as far reaching as possible.  I will not give up on trying to save people, especially my friends and family, from an eternity filled with suffering.  Call me whatever you will because I "foolishly" try to lead people in the right direction, but at this point, I am driven by love.<br>  <br>  Think about it.  Research it & study it.  Figure it out.<br>  <br>  <br>  ADDITIONAL INFO:  Thanks for the email.  I really do care and I make no assumptions.|`|B7pxO9dDaa	because you do not know what happens after death<br>  <br>  I care so much because I  beleive I have a good idea of what happens and I'm not simply talking about going to heaven or hell.|`|Fxp5Owfwaa	Because they believe it's their duty to bug the crap out of you.|`|iaPtohhhaa	It has no effect whatsoever.

You both know you're acting stupid, and doing something worthy of being made fun of.<br>  <br>  Now a third person comes into the room, that's not playing spaceman.  Now you have to explain yourself to him.  A rather nerve-wracking experience, isn't it?<br>  <br>  This is how Christians feel every time they are confronted by an atheist.<br>  <br>  Luckily for them, there are usually 10 people in the room playing spaceman, to the one of you.  But that doesn't make them appreciate your presence any more.

283tO9j9aa	I'm British and it isn't such a big deal over here, but because of the way our school system works we had one prom at 16 and one at 18, when a lot of people had left school. The first one was horrible. It was in our school hall. I was a complete geek with stupid hair and no boobs, and I felt so ugly and pathetic. I didn't have a date.<br>  <br>  Second time round it was in a nice stately home, we had a formal dinner and it was a lot of fun... mostly. I turned up with my best friend as my date. But when we had these awards for 'most likely to succeed' and all that, I got biggest ego. I was really upset, because I wasn't bigheaded- people just didn't like me.<br>  <br>  Yeah, prom sucks.|`|hXQnR2Scaa	My prom experiences were AWESOME.|`|ZA5QTj3Zaa	It was meh.

FpMS47sXaa	Mardi Gras means FAT TUESDAY<br>  It is the Tuesday before Ash Wednesday, the beginning of Lent.<br>  <br>  On Fat Tuesday, you are to indulge in what you plan on giving up for Lent.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: Mardi means Tuesday in French.<br>  Gras means more or fat (slang), in French.<br>  <br>  <br>  Do I need to draw you a map as well?!?<br>  <br>  I know I said I was gone, but I was just here browsing (wasting time) and I couldn't resist.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT2:<br>  Lent is the Catholic tradition of fasting. Basically, you give up what you like the most. Traditional Orthodoxed Catholics will actually fast completely for the 6 weeks of Lent. Lent ends on Easter.<br>  <br>  It's a symbolic tradition to show you love and thanks to God and Jesus for the sacrifices made.<br>  <br>  <br>  btw - GOOGLE.COM does work if you use it.|`|2kJKwpEEaa	Just to add the one thing that Oberon forgot, mardi gras is French; mardi= Tuesday, gras= fat.<br>  I think it's the same thing as German Faschtnacht, (feast night)- when my mother was a child they celebrated it something like trick-or-treat in the small midwestern town where she was raised, i.e., kids went door-to-door for candy.

BXd4I9mmaa	Give it time.|`|mq7X8j4Kaa	You have to give her time to believe you. The reason a lot of parents think people your age are only going through a phase or are confused is because a small minority do come out as gay and then change their minds. It will be hard for her to believe you for now, but just be yourself. You don't have to prove anything to her at the moment, enjoy yourself and love your life, she will understand and be there when you need her.|`|ynZvIh2baa	just be yourself, and let your family know that you love them and need their support. it isn't easy, and the good job for being happy enough at 15 to come out, that takes guts...just love yourself, and don't let anyone make you feel bad for who you are. good luck|`|y5DAfNtHaa	Be straight..|`|pJzeUd0Haa	Maybe your mom will understand in time|`|bq255NKSaa	well theres nothing left to do but praying that god will redeem you|`|AA11165686	My best friend has the same problem. When our parents were growing up, homosexuality was looked down upon a lot more than it is now and it was a bit of a taboo, so often when teenagers come out, their parents don't understand it or think it's something horribly bad or just a phase.<br>  <br>  Have a talk with your mom. Tell her that there's nothing wrong with you; you just happen to be attracted to guys instead of girls. You're not depressed and you're really happy. You're sure about this and you'd love her support.<br>  <br>  There are plenty of books and websites that give advice and answer questions about coming out. I've linked to some sites below.<br>  <br>  Good luck! And remember, it'll take patience. While many people may not be okay with the fact that you're gay at first, there's a good chance they'll come to terms with the fact and realize there's nothing bad about it.|`|MoXHdqMqaa	She's just going to have to come to terms with it and believe you. Do you have any gay tendencies that you could point out to her-any brothers to compare yourself to-I wish you the best of luck!|`|2JEHE8rGaa	Well even if you are gay, it doesn't mean that your family won't love you.

It never hurts to ask-maybe in a friendly game of truth or dare.|`|Np9mqUYlaa	Honestly, your 13. Just because you go to an all girl school doesn't mean that all of them are bi or homosexual. If your confortable with your sexuality, that's great. However, I believe you need to rethink somethings. Just because she's your best friend doesn't mean she's that way. If you want to ask her, then beat around the bush. Ask her if she's ever done anything with a girl, etc. Just don't do anything your going to regret? Do your parents approve of this?|`|vnEraDS0aa	I think for me; <br>  I'd be like; "You know how you like yaoi? What about yuri?"<br>  Since yuri is girlxgirl instead of boyxboy like in yaoi.<br>  And if she said yes; it's POSSIBLE that she might be bi. <br>  Then again; if she likes yaoi at all; that means that she doesn't mind with gays. . . right?<br>  <br>  It's kinda hard to tell with girls. They can play around cuz they feel comfortable with you and when you tell them that you're bi or whatever. It ruins everything you had you know?<br>  But I'm guessing that since you two are close friends and all;<br>  it wouldn't hurt to ask her.<br>  Just don't make it that she'll be afraid to answer your question.<br>  Lol xD<br>  I mean; when I have people ask me if I was les; I end up denying it cuz I get scared and the way they ask me make me not want to say anything at all.<br>  Yeah; just do it slow and easy.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps?

As long as the partners connect mentally, THAT is what is compatible.<br>  <br>  The only thing is, if age is illegal, then you legally cannot do it. See pedophiles are the way they are because they have arrested social development like that of a small child. Combine that with an adult sex drive and you've got a pedophile. It is illegal for an adult to engag in sexual activity with a child, so the pedophile has no choice but to get help. In that case, age IS an issue.<br>  <br>  If both partners are consenting mature individuals of legal age, then no, as long as they connect on a mental level, then age is not a factor.|`|GzpFvgVAaa	It depends what the age difference is.<br>  If it's just 3-5 years, than not really.<br>  But if it is a difference of 8+, yes.<br>  <br>  But then again, it depends how old YOU are lol<br>  My mom is married to a man 10 years younger than her.

W6oedX9gaa	Brother! it is not obligatory to have a beard. But it is strongly recommended to have one since our prophet and his companions and his followers all kept beard. You won't be excluded from being Muslim if u don't keep. There are more things in Islam than just keeping beard, Strong faith, five time prayers/day, etc. you can be a better muslim even if u don't keep beard, but through God consciousness, righteousness and piety.<br>  <br>  And there is no such thing as wearing a false beard in islam.<br>  Hope this answer helps u and Allah knows the best.<br>  And by the way, All the best for ur right decision.|`|6L4n6CFaaa	It is not obligatory, only encouraged.<br>  there are more important things in Islam than growing a beard.<br>  <br>  I have no doubt you will pay no attention to this and continue to remain ignorant|`|0fd02382528c74c76d5ddc83b78b411baa	dont concentrate on appearance, you should learn alot of important things before you think of that|`|d1zz0Afwaa	They sell them in joke shops|`|dPJr1Lbmaa	There are plenty of Muslim men who don't have a beard and plenty who do.

In AFJROTC, we use to direct traffic as needed for various events to include football games, cook-outs, rodeos, etc.<br>  <br>  - Contact the local VFW or American Legion (they're located in most towns across the nation).  Find out if they have any upcoming events they need assistance with or if your ROTC group can come out to perform for them (e.g. color guard, drill team, the flag raising ceremony again, singing the national anthem etc - anything that gets you involved with the public and gives you a chance to show off your uniform).<br>  <br>  Let me know if these are helpful or if you need any more.

dDMOJWxwaa	Easton's Bible Dictionary, Harp<br>  (Heb. kinnor), the national instrument of the Hebrews. It was invented by Jubal (Gen. 4:21). Some think the word kinnor denotes the whole class of stringed instruments. It was used as an accompaniment to songs of cheerfulness as well as of praise to God (Gen. 31:27; 1 Sam. 16:23; 2 Chr. 20:28; Ps. 33:2; 137:2).<br>  Easton's Bible Dictionary, Jubal<br>  jubilee, music, Lamech's second son by Adah, of the line of Cain. He was the inventor of "the harp" (Heb. kinnor, properly "lyre") and "the organ" (Heb. 'ugab, properly "mouth-organ" or Pan's pipe), Gen. 4:21.<br>  Easton's Bible Dictionary, Music<br>  Jubal was the inventor of musical instruments (Gen. 4:21). The Hebrews were much given to the cultivation of music. Their whole history and literature afford abundant evidence of this. After the Deluge, the first mention of music is in the account of Laban's interview with Jacob (Gen. 31:27). After their triumphal passage of the Red Sea, Moses and the children of Israel sang their song of deliverance (Ex. 15).<br>  Easton's Bible Dictionary<br>  Of wind instruments mention is made of, (1.) The 'ugab (Gen. 4:21; Job 21:12; 30:31), probably the so-called Pan's pipes or syrinx. (2.) The qeren or "horn" (Josh. 6:5; 1 Chr. 25:5). (3.) The shophar, rendered "trumpet" (Josh. 6:4, 6, 8). The word means "bright," and may have been so called from the clear, shrill sound it emitted. It was often used (Ex. 19:13; Num. 10:10; Judg. 7:16, 18; 1 Sam. 13:3). (4.) The hatsotserah, or straight trumpet (Ps. 98:6; Num. 10:1-10). This name is supposed by some to be an onomatopoetic word, intended to imitate the pulse-like sound of the trumpet, like the Latin taratantara. Some have identified it with the modern trombone. (5.) The halil, i.e, "bored through," a flute or pipe (1 Sam. 10:5; 1 Kings 1:40; Isa. 5:12; Jer. 48:36) which is still used in Palestine. (6.) The sumponyah, rendered "dulcimer" (Dan. 3:5), probably a sort of bagpipe. (7.) The maskrokith'a (Dan. 3:5), rendered "flute," but its precise nature is unknown.<br>  Easton's Bible Dictionary, Organ<br>  some kind of wind instrument, probably a kind of Pan's pipes (Gen. 4:21; Job 21:12; Ps. 150:4), which consisted of seven or eight reeds of unequal length.<br>  Jubal<br>  Hitchcock's Bible Names and Meanings, Jubal<br>   He that runs; a trumpet Gen 4:21<br>  Smith's Bible Dictionary, William Smith, 1884<br>  Harp The harp was the national instrument of the Hebrews, and was well known throughout Asia. Moses assigns its invention to Jubal during the antediluvian period. Genesis 4:21; Josephus records that the harp had ten strings, and that it was played on with the plectrum. Sometimes it was smaller having only eight strings, and was usually played with the fingers.<br>  Smith's Bible Dictionary, William Smith, 1884<br>  Ju'bal (music), a son of Lamech by Adah, and the inventor of the "harp and organ." Genesis 4:21.<br>  Smith's Bible Dictionary, William Smith, 1884<br>  La'mech 1. The fifth lineal descendant from Cain. Genesis 4:18-24; He is the only one except Enoch, of the posterity of Cain, whose history is related with some detail. His two wives, Adah and Zillah, and his daughter Naamah, are, with Eve, the only antediluvian women whose names are mentioned by Moses. His three sons, Jabal, Jubal and Tubal-cain, are celebrated in Scripture as authors of useful inventions. The remarkable poem which Lamech uttered may perhaps be regarded as Lamech's son of exultation on the invention of the sword by his son Tubal-cain, in the possession of which he foresaw a great advantage to himself and his family over any enemies.<br>  Smith's Bible Dictionary, William Smith, 1884<br>  Music 1. The most ancient music.-The inventor of musical instruments, like the first poet and the first forger of metals, was a Cainite. We learn from Genesis 4:21; that Jubal the son of Lamech was "the father of all such as handle the harp and organ," that is, of all players upon stringed and wind instruments. The first mentioned of music in the times after the deluge is in the narrative of Laban's interview with Jacob, Genesis 32:27; so that, whatever way it was preserved, the practice of music existed in the upland country of Syria, and of the three possible kinds of musical instruments two were known and employed to accompany the song. The three kinds are alluded to in Job 21:12; On the banks of the Red Sea Moses and the children of Israel sang their triumphal song of deliverance from the hosts of Egypt; and Miriam, in celebration of the same event, exercised one of her functions as a prophetess by leading a procession of the women of the camp, chanting in chorus the burden of the song of Moses. The song of Deborah and Barak is cast in a distinctly metrical form, and was probably intended to be sung with a musical accompaniment as one of the people's songs. The simpler impromptu with which the women from the cities of Israel greeted David after the slaughter of the Philistines was apparently struck off on the spur of the moment, under the influe|`|hYzfzu9yaa	What? I don't say anyone was the father of all who play the harp and flute. And I don't really put any stock in what the Bible has to say about it. For one, I doubt that "Jubal" ever really existed, and I  also doubt there are any sources outside of the Bible that confirm his existence. Maybe he did, maybe there are. He's not important enough for me to waste the time looking, though. :)|`|Io9288c7aa	I am just a simple Bible believing follower of Christ. So until proven otherwise I go with the Bible.

You know I did pray that and it was amazing. I had a neighbor who was something else, loud and he had problems, I avoided him as much as possible when I was outside. One day I was dumping my trash into the dumpster, he offered me some bananas, he thought they were too ripe and his mother had given them to him. I said OK wait a minute. I went back into my apartment and brought him a loaf of banana bread from my freezer that I had made, and I said I will trade you this bread for those bananas. He was so happy to get something, and I made more banana bread.  And he would greet me each time and we were good neighbors after that.

What is the ruling on this?<br>  <br>  Praise be to Allaah.<br>  <br>  Shaping the eyebrows by trimming, shaving or plucking their edges in order to appear beautiful, as is done by some women nowadays, is haraam because it involves changing the creation of Allaah and following the Shaytaan in his tempting of mankind to change the creation of Allaah. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):<br>  <br>  “Verily! Allaah forgives not (the sin of) setting up partners in worship with Him, but He forgives whom He pleases sins other than that, and whoever sets up partners in worship with Allaah, has indeed strayed far away.<br>  <br>  They (all those who worship others than Allaah) invoke nothing but female deities besides Him, and they invoke nothing but Shaytaan, a persistent rebel!<br>  <br>  Allaah cursed him.

We are not omniscient as He, all we know as far as Heaven is that the bible is clear.. if you accept Christ you are good go so to speak.  If not and choose NOT to spend an eternity with Him He will honor your request.   Which begs the question why would you want to be with a God you despise or don't believe in? <br>  <br>  As for what people decide...even on their last dying breath we know not.  I never tell someone they are going to hell.  How the heck do I know and it's not my place lol.|`|QqxZzvbAaa	there is a lot of interpretations but this is pretty clear,<br>  <br>  John 14:6<br>  Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.<br>  <br>  without Jesus you don't get to heaven.<br>  pretty clear,but if you don't believe the bible then I can't help you.God gave us His word so that we would know what we need.<br>  <br>  (IFB)|`|xlHC8qPqaa	Anyone who claims to know the mind of GOD, Is a god in their minds eye. This is of course pride, self , the mother of all harlots.|`|1a42bf28fe11e609b0c68795bce43d6baa	God wants us to know His mind in our decisions, not when it comes to other people's faith. A Christian that says that someone is going to hell, should take a look at their OWN life.|`|46q6xyKmaa	I'm Christian and I have to agree with you there.  No one knows who will be or not be allowed in Heaven.  It truly is up to the Lord. "For by thy words thou shalt be justified and by they words thou shalt be condemned." Matt. 12:37...we have to watch what we say..all of us.|`|AA12156048	a big no! God(providing God has a mind) would probably think ah! at last, someone who is actually understands the nature of reality that is the God|`|KhJwOurLaa	Christianity does exactly this. It is it's greatest flaw.|`|31M2IDw2aa	I think you make a great observation!  BUT!!!  Isn't it logical that Christ would establish ONE Church on earth through the apostles, and history PROVES that this is the Catholic Church?  <br>  <br>  That being the case, the Magisterium of Holy Mother Church has the sole authority (guided by the Holy Spirit) to interpret Holy Scripture.  Below is paragraph 100 of the Catechism of the Catholic Church.<br>  <br>  <br>  Even with this in mind, the Church can't and won't declare who will/won't make it to heaven, for final judgment is for God alone.  The Church can, however, declare the essential steps necessary for salvation.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  100 The task of interpreting the Word of God authentically has been entrusted solely to the Magisterium of the Church, that is, to the Pope and to the bishops in communion with him.|`|NAhEQiXyaa	No because some Christians believe that you should have a relationship with God and that is just like a relationship with anyone else like you ask questions and they answer and if you hang out with someone so much you start to act like them and thats how I am with God|`|AA10781962	When a Christian is saying "You will go to hell" it is an incomplete statement of fact of a more complex reality.  It is a simple truth without a complete explanation of why.<br>  <br>  That individual is simply giving a warning to you to be restored to The Book of Life through Christ before you die, because failure to do so WILL result in an eternal separation from God in a place called The Lake of Fire.<br>  <br>  Now I will explain the why:<br>  <br>  Where do you think people go when they die?<br>  <br>  God physically exists. He is just physically different. God Himself is The Book of Life. Every soul created from God (be it angel or human), are written in The Book of Life (which means are in harmony with God's state of existence from conception). <br>  <br>  "Spirits" are angels. The human race are spiritual descendants of God through Adam and Eve (who were both in harmony with God's existence and thus were in the Book of Life). <br>  <br>  S.I.N is Spirit Inverse Nature. God is Spirit. Anything opposite of God's Nature is SIN. <br>  <br>  Spirits created from God's physical existence is made from the stuff God is made of and is naturally in harmony with God's state of perfection. <br>  <br>  When a spirit does something opposite of God's nature, or SIN, they become inverted (their physical existence is literally opposite of God's nature). If an angel inverts, it is permanent because angels are made of the same stuff that God is made of: ENERGY. <br>  <br>  When energy changes form, it cannot change back to its original state. A raw egg when cooked can't be restored to its raw state. Thus, when an angel inverts, because it consists as conscious energy, it is permanent. Inverted angels are demons. When a spirit being inverts, they are no longer in harmony with God, and are thus removed from the Book of Life.<br>  <br>  A human being consists as spirit, soul, and body. The human spirit dwells within the soul. The soul is a composite of both the spirit and the body. The soul dwells in the brain and controls the body through the brain; which is why you are not dead until you are brain dead (without the aid of any machine). <br>  <br>  Human spirits are made of the stuff like that of angels, but consist as the raw material from which the human soul is created (and then co-exists interdependently within the human soul). <br>  <br>  The human soul is YOU - the individual who is expressing thought, emotion, and actions through the physical body. <br>  <br>  When Adam and Eve ate from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, their soul and body inverted and they became opposite of God's nature and their bodies began to age. God prevented them from eating of the tree of life to prevent their spirits from becoming inverted (and making it possible for their souls to be restored to God's nature of existence (to be reverted) through the blood of lambs).<br>  <br>  Genesis 3.21 - “Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of skins, and clothed them.” <br>  <br>  Leviticus 17.11 - “For the life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement (reconciliation/restoration) for your souls: for it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul.” <br>  <br>  Animals are governed by the spirit of life that dwells in them; and cannot invert, so that when they die, they are simply restored to God. <br>  <br>  The human body and the body of mammals are created from the earth, thus God was able to use the body of animals as a substitute for the inverted human body - through which the blood of that which is pure is used to cleanse that which is inverted (to temporarily restore them to God - which required a daily sacrifice until God Himself formed a body to provide His own blood to restore the human soul to Himself permanently). <br>  <br>  John 1.29 - “The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.” <br>  <br>  To take away the S.I.N. of the world is to restore the inverted state of man back to its original state. This can only be done through pure blood; which is why Christ said, <br>  <br>  John 14.6 - “I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father (is restored to The Book of Life as a son of God), but by me.” <br>  <br>  It is the blood of Christ that restores you to the Book of Life. <br>  <br>  Leviticus 17.11 - “For the life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement (reconciliation/restoration) for your souls: for it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul.”<br>  <br>  The breath of life that came from God's physical existence is the spirit of life. The human spirit itself is literally restored to God; while the soul's destination is determined by its state of existence upon death (which takes about 1/10th of a second). Upon death, the soul consists in either one of two states: in harmony with God's existence or opposite of God's existence (or the inverse).|`|BHRHf367aa	Yes you are partly right, Jesus nor any of His followers ever said if you do "X" you are going to hell, yet we are clearly told the way to heaven, and few will find it. The truth is, I by the way I live will tell you which way I am going, by the fruit, a tree is known, and we are told in <br>  Scripture what happens to a fig tree that does not bear, or bears corrupt fruit. <br>  So while we do not tell people that they are going to hell, Christ has given us insight into the path to hell...in essence "we have the mind of God" Romans 11:33-35; 1Corinthians 2:6.|`|52246014c6731089215da64339f2d610aa	It will smite them.|`|5dd8eBDYaa	To think that one could even begin to wrap ones puny little brain around the true nature of the universe is the height of arrogance and the epitome of human folly.|`|zZxX5PXBaa	Jeremiah 23, vv 21 to the end is salutary.

Their son, Abel found favor with God but was then killed by his brother, Cain.  Later, they had a son, Seth, "and to Seth also there was born to a son and he proceeded to call his name Enosh.  At that time a start was made of calling on the name of God." (Genesis 4:26)   Enosh's great, great grandson was Enoch "and after his fathering Methuselah Enoch went on walking with the true God three hundred years." (Genesis 5:22)  "Now it came about that. . . men started to grow in numbers on the surface of the ground. . . Consequently God saw that the badness of man was abundant in the earth and every inclination of the thoughts of his heart was only bad all the time.  And God felt regrets that he had made men in the earth, and he felt hurt at his heart. . .But Noah found favor in the eyes of God." (Genesis 6:1,5,6,8)  Then, the flood happens.  Centuries after the flood God made a covenant with Noah's great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great grandson, Abraham.  "When Abraham got to be ninety-years old, then God appeared to him and said to him: "I am God Almighty.  Walk before me and prove yourself faultless.  And I will give my covenant between me and you, that I may multiply you very, very much. . . As for me, look! my covenant is with you, and you will certainly become father to a crowd of nations. . . And I will carry out my covenant between me and you and your seed after you according to their generations for a covenant to time indefinent, to prove myself God to you and to your seed after you." (Genesis 17:1,2,4,7)  Here God made a covenant with Abraham that His nation would come from Abraham's offspring.  These previous scriptures are vital in the discussion of Judeo/Christianity vs. Islam.  Each feel they are the nation that God spoke to Abraham about.  The nation of Isreal, from which Jesus and Christianity were born, originated with Isaac.  Islam, however, came from Abraham's son, Ishmael.  Ishmael was born to Hagar, the concubine of Sarah, Abraham's wife.  God, speaking to Abraham in regards to his two sons said this, "Sarah your wife is indeed bearing you a son, and you must call his name Isaac.  And I will establish my covenant with him for time indefinite to his seed after him.  But as regards Ishmael I have heard you.  Look! I will bless him and will make him fruitfl and will multiply him very, very much.  He will certainly produce twelve cheiftains, and I will make him become a reat nation.  However, my covenant I shall establish with Isaac." (Genesis 17:19-21)  So here is the beginning of the history of Monotheism.<br>  <br>  HISTORY OF POLYTHEIS: The bible speaks of many polytheistic nations, such as the Canaanites, Edomites, Egyptians and many more.  The Babylonians have the earliest known history, dating back the the days of Nimrod, the great-grandson of Noah, and the Tower of Babel (Genesis 11).  The inhabitants of the city Ur, where Abraham and Sarah were from before they began to worship the Almighty God, were Chaldeans, a polytheistic nation. (Genesis 11:31)  Since Satan the Devil as been influencing the people on the earth since he brought sin to the Garden of Eden there may have even been polytheistic beliefs before the flood.  God expressed his displeassure with the state of the earth at the time, and has continued to express his displeasure with polytheism throughout the centuries.  Here is an overview of the beginning of the history of polytheism. <br>  <br>  So so long - but you asked!|`|S7XZ6KCpaa	Animistic Spirit and Nature Worship seems to be the most primitive or earliest, then came more complex Polytheistic theology.

("my lord has chosen me to be his bride above all others" etc.).

At the rapture we will be a glorious church. The word glorious means perfect. We will be a glorified church when all the believers are caught up in the air. Our bodies will be changed, we will be like Him, and we will be without spot or wrinkle. Then we also will be His bride. We are not yet fit to be His bride. He wants a glorious bride without a spot or wrinkle. <br>  <br>  When the rapture takes place and all of us are caught up in the air, the church, the body, and the bride will all be the same. We will not be the bride until we get to the wedding, but we are already sanctified or set apart. <br>  <br>  We are already members of the family of God. We are going to Heaven when we die, and we are going to form a group at the rapture that will be His bride. Until then, the church and the body are the same because the church is the called-out assembly and that called-out assembly is the body of Christ.<br>  <br>  You probably don’t understand this and most likely don’t even want to.  <br>  <br>  1 Cor 2:14 But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.|`|hdFn4Dobaa	The Bride of Christ is the Church and it's people, people of the Lord , God's remnant dear.<br>  <br>  'And I saw the Holy City, the New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God. It was prepared like a Bride dressed for Her Husband. and I heard a Loud Voice from the Throne, saying, " Now God's Presence is with  people, and He will live with them, and hey will be His people. God Himself will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and there will be no more death, sadness, crying, or pain, because all the old ways are gone " ( Revelation 21; 2-4 ).<br>  <br>  The apostle John, seen a vision of what was to come.<br>  One day God will remake the world and take away all evil and suffering. This is based on the promises of God's Character and Faithfulness. It is a vision for what life should be like when it is lived in full agreement with God's Will. Jesus taught His disciples to pray that God's Will would be realized here on earth, as it is in heaven ( Matthew 6: 10 ).<br>  The New Jerusalem is the place where the new heaven will meet the new earth. It is a Spiritual City where God's people live with Him. John says that God will make His home there among His people. God's people are back in Paradise. The old agreement with Israel established a place where God would choose to be worshipped, the old Jerusalem. The new agreement must have a place to worship God that reflects the changes God has made in the Redemption of His people. This require a new city, Jerusalem.<br>   Jesus and His followers founded the organized church as a visible manifestation of His Kingdom. Jesus the Christ is not only the founder, but also its Head. He is over the whole church ( Ephesians 1;22; 5:24, Colossians 1:18 ).|`|SS5py9jIaa	Yeah, baffling.

1ffb5797d2e26ccb8eb17dd3db6e22c0aa	The Bible doesn't comment on their relationship much.  The New Testament focuses primarily on Christ's missionary work,  NOT his childhood, nor his parent's relationship,  so simply,  we don't know for sure. <br>  <br>  So,  it is OK that the Nativity story you saw, took liberties on minor issues that do not impact the story.  They likely portrayed that because Culturally, at the time, often marriages WERE arranged so the 2 didn't know each other much and therefore were not expected to "love" each other. <br>  <br>  We don't know for SURE if their marriage was completely arranged or not.  It is quite possible and this was the practice of the time. <br>  <br>  There are some extra-biblical books which are attributed to the teachings of the apostles, but weren't written down until around 200AD, which supposedly allege that Mary's mother made a vow to God, that Mary would remain a virgin, consecrated unto the Lord as was sometimes the custom back then.  IF those writings were actually true (they are written late enough that they are suspicious) then Mary would have been appointed a "protector" -- usually an older man,  to keep her vow of chastity all her life.  Joseph COULD have been this older man, since the bible doesn't mention him after Jesus is about the age of 12. He might have died by then.  Therefore IF that speculation is TRUE,  then Mary and Joeseph probably didn't love each other before they were married and their marriage was most likely arranged. <br>  <br>  BUT,  all this is speculation and there is no way of knowing for sure. <br>  Luckily it doesn't change the message or the later events of Christ's life any, therefore the movie can take what is called "artistic license" with that small part of the story and portray it anyway they want.|`|93galWG1aa	Mary had sworn a vow of celibacy to God, she wanted to stay that way, But she submitted to God as he wanted Jesus to have an earthly Father.<br>  Joseph also had made a vow to God to remain celibate, so God joined two holy people together.<br>  Mary Loved Joseph deeply.|`|OhhKRahTaa	Its just a fairytale.|`|DDYIrSKOaa	Read your Bible|`|AA11849917	Maybe the kid playing Mary in the school play was rather reluctant to get married to the kid playing Joseph (just a guess), because the Bible never says anything of the sort.|`|96cd1744acaf1e87751ac1ec9c729b19aa	You know that it's a bronze age middle eastern goat herders fairy tale dear don't you ?

As soon as you compare it to something that everyone accepts as myth and get the believers to justify the difference in acceptance this becomes obvious.

Religion is not the #1 problem, although fundamentalist religion could well be.    We do not need to force everyone to atheism, but we do need to make people see that their faith is based on wishful thinking.   That does not make it bad, but it does make them realize that it is wrong to hate or pass laws just based on that wishful thinking.|`|ao2mP5pNaa	Actually I found the film to be a little too vague and weak.

Too many holes and too much religion bashing without proper arguments.

This is why they are called World Wars.<br>  <br>  + Just War Theory +<br>  <br>  The “just war” doctrine requires rigorous consideration to determine if defense by military force is legitimate. <br>  <br>  Offensive war is never justified. <br>  <br>  All the following considerations must be true to justify war:<br>  1. The damage inflicted by the aggressor on the nation or community of nations must be lasting, grave, and certain;<br>  2. All other means of putting an end to it must have been shown to be impractical or ineffective;<br>  3. There must be serious prospects of success;<br>  4. The use of arms must not produce evils and disorders graver than the evil to be eliminated. <br>  <br>  WWII against the Nazis was a just and defensive war.<br>  <br>  For more information, see the Catechism of the Catholic Church, section 2309: <a href="http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt3sect2chpt2art5.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt3s...</a><br>  <br>  With love in Christ.|`|mrMkKFqNaa	Quakers<br>  Moonies and Scientologists (because they didn't exist yet!)<br>  <br>  And...the answer you're looking for...Watchtower followers (sort of).  During the SECOND world war, the Watchtower followers (by then called Jehovah's Witnesses) were pacifists.<br>  <br>  But during the FIRST world war, the Watchtower followers were not quite as consistent.  For example, the June 1, 1918 issue of the Watchtower on page 174 exhorted its followers as follows: "In accordance with the resolution of Congress of April 2nd, and with the proclamation of the president of the United States of May 11, it is suggested that the Lord's people everywhere make May 30th a day of prayer and supplication. God was graciously pleased to cause the nation to be formed and to grow under the most favorable conditions in the world for the preservation of liberty, civil and religious."<br>  <br>  The June 1, 1918 Watchtower continued, "Let there be praise and thanks-giving to God for the promised glorious outcome of the war, the breaking of the shackles of autocracy, the freeing of the captives (Isaiah 61:1) and the making of the world safe for the common people--blessings all assured by the Word of God to the people of this country and of the whole world of mankind."<br>  <br>  Thus, the Watchtower encouraged its adherents to pray for the allies to win World War 1.

Most of all the others that won't take up arms and kill another human, will do jobs or work that is for the war effort they just won't pull the trigger.<br>  <br>  The Jehovah's Witnesses won't even move or carry anything including working on items that are used for war. The Bible in the book of Rev calls government a scarlet colored wild beast that has 7 heads & ten horns, this beast is going to be destroyed by God, not man. Jehovah's Witnesses are law abiding & will obey the laws of the land they live in unless they conflict with Gods laws, then it's God we obey, not man.<br>  <br>  IN READING THESE ANSWERS, I HAVE ONE QUESTION, HOW DOES ONE THINK THAT A VICTUM IS PART OF AN ACTION?

AND YOUR ON THE LEADER POLE FOR RELIGION AND SPIRITUALITY, please!!!<br>  <br>  The catholics starting from the Popes did not support the war but they did support Hitler before he came into power, once the atrocites started. Pope Pius XI signed the Concordat with Hitler in 1933. The only thing that the Concordat did is to give the Popes independance in the for of thieer own tiny soverign state, the Vatican City. The signing of that was just to save themselves, nothing more. I still have to read more upon it, but the fact is that Catholics Clergy men, what ever they are called did join the Nazi Regime.<br>  Joseph Ratzinger, or our current pope, Pope Benedict the XVI, in his teen years was in the hitler youth program. I found pictures of him in his alter boy uniform doing the Heil Hitler salute. Catholics participated in that war.<br>  In the country of Rwuanda, the Catholic population is 90% of the citizens. So why couldnt the Catholic Church stop the Rwuandan Genocide in 1994? Did any catholics participate in the Slaughter? Yes, almost all of them if 90% or the population is Catholic.<br>  With your answer, iamcatholic2, are you saying that WARS ARE JUSTIFIABLE? IS THE RWANDAN GENOCIDE JUSTIFIABLE? The worst massacres happen in Churches where church officials often participated in the killings themselves. Read "Genocide" by Jane Springer.<br>  Also a Catholic Church Official was arrested after the "justifiable war" we now call the Rwandan Genocide.<br>  There was only one case of a Mormon that did not join the Nazi's, but he was only one out of the milliions of Mormons. According to their 'Law of the Land' you have to fight and do what ever the Law tells you to do.<br>  <br>  The only people that did not join any war, any where are the Jehovah's Witnesses. In the US they were sent to prisons, arrested, beat etc. Also in Canada, Mexico, Yugoslavia, Greece, Turkey, etc.. almost all around the world Jehovah's Witnesses are the only ones that follow John 13:34,35.|`|nQvcqVkNaa	If I'm not mistaken, Catholic leaders blessed troops on both sides of WWII and then those same soldiers went out and murdered eachother. I believe there were many of the Protestant sects who also murdered ones of their own sect in the wars of the nations of this earth. The Bible is clear that satan rules this present world and that peace loving, non-violent Christians are awaiting the "new heavens and new earth" that is to be ruled by Yhshua (Jesus in english) the Christ who has been appointed to that Kingly position by the Almighty God named YHWH (Jehovah in english) whom he serves.<br>  <br>  True Christians follow the Bible.<br>  Romans 12:17<br>  1 Peter 3:9<br>  Matthew 5:39<br>  Luke 6:27-30<br>  True Christians do not murder each other in the wars of satan's world.

N. 569/00/L<br>  <br>  Dear Father:<br>  This Congregation for Divine Worship has received your letter sent by fax in which you ask whether it is in accord with liturgical law to remove the Holy Water from the fonts for the duration of the season of Lent.<br>  <br>  This Dicastery is able to respond that the removing of Holy Water from the fonts during the season of Lent is not permitted, in particular, for two reasons:<br>  <br>  The liturgical legislation in force does not foresee this innovation, which in addition to being praeter legem is contrary to a balanced understanding of the season of Lent, which though truly being a season of penance, is also a season rich in the symbolism of water and baptism, constantly evoked in liturgical texts. <br>  The encouragement of the Church that the faithful avail themselves frequently of the [sic] of her sacraments is to be understood to apply also to the season of Lent. The "fast" and "abstinence" which the faithful embrace in this season does not extend to abstaining from the sacraments or sacramentals of the Church. The practice of the Church has been to empty the Holy Water fonts on the days of the Sacred Triduum in preparation of the blessing of the water at the Easter Vigil, and it corresponds to those days on which the Eucharist is not celebrated (i.e., Good Friday and Holy Saturda). <br>  Hoping that this resolves the question with every good wish and kind regard, I am,<br>  <br>  Sincerely yours in Christ,<br>  Mons. Mario Marini<br>  Undersecretary|`|qOGh6ODLaa	Removing water from holy water fonts is a physical action reminding us of the liturgical season that the Church is celebrating. Not singing the Gloria or the Alleluia during Lent serves a similar purpose.All three customs are a fast before the feast, a time when we will use lots of water (the Blessing of Water during the Easter Vigil and the Sprinkling Rite during the Easter season) to remind us of our Baptism, we will sing the Gloria with new vigor and our Alleluias (Hebrew for “Praise Yahweh”) will express our profound belief in God’s providence, even as we face trials and difficulties.Some parishes replace the water with sand.|`|bXeHr69Vaa	it is only removed on the thursday and friday of easter

Going to hell is not the punishment for not loving God, hell is our just punishment for a life of sin, (no matter how 'good' of a person you are).  and in that sense, yes He does 'need' to do that, God is perfect and cannot allow imperfect things into His presence, that is why Jesus had to come and die as an atonement for our sins so that through His blood we might be made righteous.|`|SrSGgPoraa	Naw dude.

Atheists are rational, intelligent people that can sometimes have better character and morals than religious people.  Atheists are people to who have feelings and compassion.

Those people probably had a much easier time in death because you were there to comfort them and share a part of you with them when they needed it most.<br>  <br>  Whether you know it or not, God was watching you and whether you belive in Him or not, he would have approved of everything you did.<br>  You were looking out for others and showed compassion which God does with us every day.

But as for plucking the eyebrows, it is forbidden and not permissible in Islam, according to the Hadith: 'May Allah's curse be inflicted upon women who pluck their eyebrows, and women hired to do this.' <br>  <br>  What is prohibited is an-Nams, which denotes removing the hair of the eyebrows by plucking in order to make it thin. The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) is reported to have cursed both women who do the plucking and those who seek to have it done.

Nbs6w3hLaa	It is just easier for people who speak English to call it Germany.|`|yZ1VioWvaa	..and DUTCH is a corruption of the word DEUTSCH.not the other way around.|`|BhEsZMG8aa	Because that is the German name for their country.  That's like asking why english speakers don't call Spain, Espana|`|5mHF9C8Iaa	Why do germans call England England..lawl ><!|`|1d627596e14caafeacfad98d799d9a7caa	Not at all. <br>  <br>  Deutchland is the German word for Germany. We speak English not Deutch.<br>  <br>  Why do the French call England "Angleterre"? Because that is the French word for England. En francais, "Angleterre" est le mot francais pour l'Angleterre.<br>  <br>  All languages have names for other countries. They are not generally the same name that is used in the language from that country. <br>  <br>  Do you think Vietnamese people call themselves "Vietnamese"? Or refer to their home country as "Viet Nam"? Of course not. They have Vietnamese words for their language and country. It's normal.

bYGqsxfwaa	Sono italiano e sono pure gay.<br>  <br>  Ti voglio rispondere in tutta sincerità. Sinceramente, mi sembra una gran perdita di tempo andare dietro una canzone, criticarla in continuazione e fare tutte queste storie. Ricordiamo che è solo una canzone, delle parole messe in fila con un suono in sottofondo. Niente di più, niente di meno.<br>  Ti ripeto, io sono gay e non mi sento minimamente offeso. Perchè? Semplicemente perché è una storia come tante altre. Una storia di un ragazzo che prima era gay e ora non più. Può succedere; e non ci trovo nulla di male nel voler raccontare una storia del genere. <br>  <br>  Se poi si affronta il discorso della politica italiana e di quanto i diritti dei gay non siano riconosciuti, allora ti do pienamente ragione. Non c'è neanche una legislatura riguardo le unioni civili, ed è una vergogna considerato che ormai in quasi tutti i paesi dell'Occidente ce ne sia una.<br>  Ma per quanto riguarda la canzone, mi dispicae, ma credo sia proprio tempo perso. Io mi preoccupo più di far valere i miei diritti in politica piuttosto che crogiolarmi nel vittimismo gay che - purtroppo - contraddistingue questa minoranza italiana. <br>  Saluti.
3J6KaUg8aa	there are different levels of gender identity disorder-this is likely what you are seeing--very few of the total population of trans-gender people actually have full medical transition.  Sexuality and gender are two different things and should not be confused as the same thing-because your friend dresses opposite of her biological sex doesn't have anything to do with sexuality unless it is being used to attract other females for the idea  of having sex|`|AA11620807	It sounds like she's got a gender identity that leans towards the male. No offense to her but it occurs that she identifies as a man, but wants to retain all of the benefits of being a woman. <br>  <br>      She may also be in denial of the gender issue (confused yeah) or be afraid of losing YOU by admitting to a male identity. try supporting her with this in mind. Make it clear you care about her no mattter what.|`|gLVbSrx6aa	i don't know.<br>  but i know a girl who dresses exactly like a boy, to the point where you can no longer tell she's a girl<br>  <br>  YET<br>  she has a very feminine girlfriend, and they both hate men and aren't sexually attracted to them either.<br>  <br>  how's that for confusing?|`|ynZvIh2baa	no, she is probably just reall weird!|`|mIj958p1aa	well i guess it all has to do with personal preference in behavior and style. i really have no idea about the whole tellin people she has a p33n thing that's kind a weird.

If he likes guys a lot and looks to guys for his emotional needs, he may well be gay.<br>  <br>  Is he super, over-the-top passionate for you?  If so, he probably just feels brotherly love fo the other guy.<br>  <br>  But if he is not over-the-top passionate for you, or if his eyes brighten and his heart pounds when a good looking guy walks into the room and hugs him, and he seems passionate and energized by guys -- then he's gay.<br>  <br>  Only he can know for sure.|`|Vu726Q18aa	bisexual if he still likes you|`|KszocgnSaa	Idk maybe, you should ask him.|`|Atm21O43aa	HELL TO THE YEAH!

And as far as that goes, males rate the importance of attractiveness higher than other characteristics. I think stereotypically, amongst hetero couples this is pretty obvious also. The old adage of a "trophy wife" has a lot to do with how much the breadwinner (usually the male) makes. I think it all comes down to what a person values in a mate and in their life.

c3DqvgE4aa	Government and politics<br>  <br>      Main articles: Politics of Turkey, Constitution of Turkey, and Elections in Turkey<br>  <br>  The Grand Chamber of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey in Ankara<br>  <br>  Turkey is a parliamentary representative democracy. Since its foundation as a republic in 1923, Turkey has developed a strong tradition of secularism.[26] Turkey's constitution governs the legal framework of the country. It sets out the main principles of government and establishes Turkey as a unitary centralized state.<br>  <br>  The head of state is the President of the Republic and has a largely ceremonial role. The president is elected for a five-year term by direct elections. The last President, Ahmet Necdet Sezer, was elected on May 16, 2000, after having served as the President of the Constitutional Court. He was succeeded on August 28, 2007, by Abdullah Gül.[27] Executive power is exercised by the Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers which make up the government, while the legislative power is vested in the unicameral parliament, the Grand National Assembly of Turkey. The judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature, and the Constitutional Court is charged with ruling on the conformity of laws and decrees with the constitution. The Council of State is the tribunal of last resort for administrative cases, and the High Court of Appeals for all others.[28]<br>  <br>  The Prime Minister is elected by the parliament through a vote of confidence in his government and is most often the head of the party that has the most seats in parliament. The current Prime Minister is the former mayor of ?stanbul, Recep Tayyip Erdo?an, whose conservative AKP won an absolute majority of parliamentary seats in the 2002 general elections, organized in the aftermath of the economic crisis of 2001, with 34% of the suffrage.[29][30] In the 2007 general elections, the AKP received 46.6% of the votes and could defend its majority in parliament.[31] Neither the Prime Minister nor the Ministers have to be members of the parliament, but in most cases they are (one notable exception was Kemal Dervi?, the Minister of State in Charge of the Economy following the financial crisis of 2001;[32] he is currently the president of the United Nations Development Programme).[33]<br>  <br>  Universal suffrage for both sexes has been applied throughout Turkey since 1933, and every Turkish citizen who has turned 18 years of age has the right to vote. As of 2004, there were 50 registered political parties in the country, whose ideologies range from the far left to the far right.[34] The Constitutional Court can strip the public financing of political parties that it deems anti-secular or separatist, or ban their existence altogether.[35][36]<br>  <br>  There are 550 members of parliament who are elected for a four-year term by a party-list proportional representation system from 85 electoral districts which represent the 81 administrative provinces of Turkey (?stanbul is divided into three electoral districts whereas Ankara and ?zmir are divided into two each because of their large populations). To avoid a hung parliament and its excessive political fragmentation, only parties that win at least 10% of the votes cast in a national parliamentary election gain the right to representation in the parliament.[34] As a result of this threshold, the 2007 elections saw three parties formally entering the parliament (compared to two in 2002).[37][38] However, due to a system of alliances and independent candidatures, seven parties are currently represented in the parliament. Independent candidates may run; however, they must also win at least 10% of the vote in their circonscription to be elected.[34]

urQQ6kbcaa	See OJ Simpson|`|jdVxsK4yaa	i believe in karma!!!<br>  everybody will get theres......|`|i48kxrbaaa	It's called karma.|`|aacfd8fefffdd38954d160d7caee8f91aa	I don't think this concept was ever intended to be an all inclusive, absolute fact; just a general principle.  <br>  <br>  But as a principle it's a good one.  For the most part, you will reap what you sow.|`|pvabglXhaa	Yes, really.<br>  <br>  Everything that goes around comes around, whether you hear about it or not.<br>  <br>  It's karma.|`|kF9aHWfUaa	Yes.ppl tht hurted me got hurt infront of my eyes.It's called karma.|`|ao2mP5pNaa	Maybe this is difficult to explain and a little vague, but I believe that there is a sort of general power of "luck, fortune, karma" whatever you want to call it.  I think the earth and everything in nature wants to achieve a baseline state of this power, much like how the universe and all the known forces in the universe want to exist in the state of lowest potential energy.  What this means is that in whatever direction you deviate from this baseline, there is a higher probability that you will revert to the "other" side of it.  i.e. if you pull a spring out and release it, it will most certainly retract, and then compress in the other direction.<br>  <br>  I know it's a confusing explanation and I'm having a hard time explaining it, but basically what I'm saying is if many good things happen to the point that it is unlikely and higher than the global trend, then it is much more likely that bad things will subsequently happen, in order to balance it out.<br>  <br>  The earth exists as it does and for great things to happen to you, bad things must happen to others, and vice versa.  The global state of "karma" itself can change, improving or worsening, but since there are 7 billion of us, it's a gradual shift and any one person has little to no influence upon it.<br>  <br>  This is in no way an answer, but just kind of a working theory.  I hope it gives you a little inspiration or insight or whatever you want to call it.  Food for thought.

However, here are the best in my opinion:<br>  <br>  New Jerusalem Bible, Regular Edition<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385142641?ie=UTF8&tag=wwwjimpettico-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0385142641" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385142...</a><br>  the best translation available (in my opinion) with really excellent study notes.<br>  <br>  New Oxford Annotated NRSV Augmented<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0195288815?ie=UTF8&tag=wwwjimpettico-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0195288815" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0195288...</a><br>  overuse of inclusive language, but very scholarly notes and includes the entire Eastern Orthodox canon (6 more Scriptures than the NJB-RE).  More literal than the NJB-RE, which tends to be less accurate but is more useful in original language word study.<br>  <br>  New Interpreter's Study Bible, NRSV<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0687278325?ie=UTF8&tag=wwwjimpettico-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0687278325" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0687278...</a><br>  <br>  The Oxford Study Bible, REB<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0195290003?ie=UTF8&tag=wwwjimpettico-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0195290003" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0195290...</a><br>  A translation possibly as good as the NJB with excellent study notes.  Includes the entire English Protestant Apocrypha (3 more Scriptures than the NJB-RE)<br>  <br>  If you require an "easier reading" version - that is, for those not comfortable with high school level vocabulary and a dictionary (both of which are really needed for the above)<br>  <br>  The Learning Bible CEV<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1585160172?ie=UTF8&tag=wwwjimpettico-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1585160172" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1585160...</a><br>  A very simplified translation with basic but excellently non-sectarian study notes (the only easier-reading one that I've found).  Only includes 66 books of the bible, the "minimal canon", but great for those not ready for a more scholarly study effort.<br>  <br>  <br>  Next, a good book on Christian doctrine.  This may seem strange to you (it does to me), but the most extensive and well-explained text on Christian doctrine that I have ever read is the Roman Catholic Catechism<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0879739770?ie=UTF8&tag=wwwjimpettico-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0879739770" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0879739...</a><br>  Although it includes several Roman Catholic doctrines to which I do not subscribe, it includes very nearly every Christian doctrine held to be true by Christians, with explanation and reference Scriptures.  I consider this a "must read" book for Christians - AFTER reading the bible once or (better) twice.  It is available online<br>  <a href="http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/ccc_toc.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/...</a><br>  As an example, see the way that the doctrine of trinity is fully explained (see 253 forward)<br>  <a href="http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p1s2c1p2.htm#III" rel="nofollow">http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/...</a><br>  The problem with the online version is that the references aren't conveniently located at the bottom of each book-length page as in the printed version.<br>  <br>  Next, I recommend participating in some sort of bible discussion like you find here on YA.  You can ask questions and receive answers and judge for yourself the value and validity of each.  I find my own ideas corrected frequently - which (of course) is of great benefit.<br>  <br>  Jim, <a href="http://www.bible-reviews.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bible-reviews.com</a>|`|hZjPYyFTaa	I study scripture alone.

The term applies to all who deny what the Bible says about Jesus Christ, all who oppose his Kingdom, and all who mistreat his followers. It also includes individuals, organizations, and nations that falsely claim to represent Christ or that improperly ascribe to themselves the role of Messiah.<br>  Does the Bible refer to only one antichrist?<br>  1?John 2:18: “Young children, it is the last hour, and, just as you have heard that antichrist is coming, even now there have come to be many antichrists; from which fact we gain the knowledge that it is the last hour.”<br>  2?John 7: “Many deceivers have gone forth into the world, persons not confessing Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the antichrist.” (Notice that the “many antichrists” of 1?John 2:18 are here referred to collectively as “the antichrist.”)<br>  <br>  Is the coming of the antichrist reserved for some future time?<br>  1?John 4:3: “Every inspired expression that does not confess Jesus does not originate with God. Furthermore, this is the antichrist’s inspired expression which you have heard was coming, and now it is already in the world.” (That was written near the end of the first century?C.E.)<br>  1?John 2:18: “Even now there have come to be many antichrists; from which fact we gain the knowledge that it is the last hour.” (By “last hour” John evidently meant the end of the apostolic period. The other apostles had died, and John himself was very old.)<br>  <br>  Some of those identified as antichrist—<br>  Persons who deny that Jesus is truly the Messiah<br>  1?John 2:22: “Who is the liar if it is not the one that denies that Jesus is the Christ [or, Messiah, anointed one]? This is the antichrist.”<br>  <br>  All who deny that Jesus is the unique Son of God<br>  1?John 2:22: “This is the antichrist, the one that denies the Father and the Son.”<br>  Compare John 10:36; Luke 9:35.<br>  <br>  Apostates<br>  1?John 2:18,?19: “There have come to be many antichrists .?.?. They went out from us, but they were not of our sort.”<br>  Those who oppose Christ’s true followers<br>  John 15:20,?21: “If they have persecuted me, they will persecute you also .?.?. But they will do all these things against you on account of my name.”<br>  Individuals and nations that oppose Christ as King or that themselves falsely claim the Messianic role<br>  Ps. 2:2: “The kings of earth take their stand and high officials themselves have massed together as one against Jehovah and against his anointed one [Christ, or Messiah].”<br>  See also Revelation 17:3,?12-14; 19:11-21.<br>  Matt. 24:24: “False Christs and false prophets will arise and will give great signs and wonders so as to mislead, if possible, even the chosen ones<br>  The apostle John stated: “Who is the liar if it is not the one that denies that Jesus is the Christ? This is the antichrist, the one that denies the Father and the Son.” (1?John 2:22) Apostates and leaders of false worship twist the clear teachings of Jesus into knots of religious deceit. Such ones reject Bible truth and spread lies in the name of God and Christ. They deny the true relationship of the Father and the Son by their Trinity doctrine. Therefore, they too are a part of the antichrist.<br>  Jesus forewarned his disciples at Luke 21:12: “People will lay their hands upon you and persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues and prisons .?.?. for the sake of my name.” Since the first century, true Christians have endured savage persecution. (2?Timothy 3:12) Fomenters of such treatment work against Christ. They too are a component of the antichrist.|`|vNvtwuBfaa	18 TYPES OF ANTICHRIST<br>  <br>  1. Cain. In type, the "seed of the serpent" (Gen. 3:15) born "of that wicked one" (1 John 3:12), who had a MARK (Gen. 4:15) which signified a murderer. <br>  2. Nimrod. His name means "the rebel," the thirteenth from Adam and a builder of an integrated United Nations to glorify man. He is a Hamite, whose seed had a divine curse on it (Gen. 9:25), as Cain. "Nimrod" also has a root derivation of "LEOPARD" or "PANTHER" (Gen. 10-11; Rev. 13:2). <br>  3. Pharaoh. The one who persecuted Israel (cf. Rev. 12:1-17) and is called a "DRAGON" (Ezek. 29:3), as Revelation 12:1-4. Plagues come on him, as Revelation 11:4-6; and his catechism is, "I know not the LORD, neither will I let Israel go." (Ex. 5:2). <br>  4. Balak. The man who tries to eliminate Israel, winds up corrupting Israel with BAAL worship (Numbers 22-25). His prophet is BALAAM, thus making a trinity: Father-Baal, Son-Balak, Unclean Spirit-Balaam (see Rev. 16:13 cf. Rev. 13:11-15). Baal is our word "bull" or "OX."  Balak is a king, as the Antichrist. He is a half-breed of Moabite extraction, the Moabites coming from the mixture of Lot's Hamitic wife and daughters (see Gen. 10:6, 19; 13:12; 19:15, 30-38). <br>  5. Sisera. A Gentile King who is defeated at Megiddo (Rev. 16:16), which is the Armageddon of Revelation. "The stars in their courses" fight from heaven against him (Judg. 5:19-20; Rev. 19). and the man who fights him is said to be a type of Jesus Christ (see Judg. 5:12; Eph. 4:4-10).  Sisera is killed by a blow on the head (Gen. 3:15; Judges 5:26). <br>  6. Abimelech. The man is a rebel (Judges 9) who is killed by a blow on the head (Rom. 16:20; Hab. 3:13). <br>  7. Absalom. This "father of peace" obtains the kingdom peaceably, by flatteries (see 2 Sam. 15:2-6; Dan. 8:25, 11:24). He rebels against David, a type of Christ. He is perfect in beauty (2 Sam. 14:25-26; Ezek. 28:15) and is hairy (cf. Esau) and hangs (Gal. 3:13; Matt. 27:5) and has a memorial built to himself (2 Sam. 18:18; Rev. 13:14-15). <br>  8. Saul. He is demon-possessed, a rebel against God, a usurper of the priest's office, a popular idol, a hater of David (type of Christ), and a tall man (2 Thess. 2:2-6; Rev. 13:3-6). <br>  9. Goliath. A tall man. He is killed by a wound in the head. Goliath comes from Hamitic background, exactly as Nimrod, Balak, and Pharaoh (note Gen. 10:6, 14). He has SIX peices of armor (1 Sam. 17:4-7), and he is killed by David (a type of Christ). <br>  10. Ahab. He is a wicked prince of Israel (Ezek. 21:25-27) and marries a Phoenician Baal-worshipper (1 Kings 16:31). He is opposed by the herald of the Second Advent, Elijah! Ahab has priests who wear vestments and come from the apostate tribe of Dan, who called the priest, "Father"! (see Judg. 17:1-3, 5, 7-13; 18:1, 6, 14-25, 28-31; and 2 Kings 10:22.)  These priests hold services at 11-12 on the day of the sun-god, "Sunday," and worship Baal by penitential acts of self-mutilation (1 Kings 18:17, 27-28).  They honor the "Queen of Heaven" with wafers (Jer. 44:17, 19, 25), and as Phoenicians, they come from HAM (see Gen. 10:19-- Sidon, Zidon in 1 Kings 16). <br>  11. Jeroboam. He is a wicked prince of Israel (Ezek. 21:25-27), who worships Baal with golden calves which men are to KISS (1 Kings 12:25-33; Hosea 13:2; I Kings 19:18).  Jeroboam, as the Antichrist, had a bad arm (Zech. 11:16-17 -- note the "IDOL"; 1 Kings 13:4); and Kaiser Bill, Hitler, and Napoleon seemed to have picked up the thing accidentally. <br>  12. Nabal. He is an enemy of David and , as was Herod, is killed by God (1 Sam. 25:36-38). His answer is identical to Pharaoh's except the word "David" is inserted for "Lord" (see 1 Sam. 25:10; Exod. 5:2) see Eph. 2:1-3, 11-13.  <br>  13. Sennacherib. An enemy of Israel who is stricken by the angel of the Lord, as was Herod (see Acts 12:22-23; II Kings 19:16, 35). He attacks Jerusalem, goes away and returns, exactly as Titus in A.D. 70, exactly as Saul chased David in 1 Sam. 24, 26, and as the Antichrist will do in Matthew 24, thus giving those in Judea opportunity to "flee to the mountains" (Matt. 24:16; Psalm 11:1). <br>  14. Nebuchadnezzar. He builds an image (Rev. 13:18; Dan. 3). The image is 60 by 6 by 6 (Dan. 3:1; Rev. 13:18). He persecutes the Jewish remnant (Dan. 3:16-18) using SEVEN as the ratio (Dan. 3:19). There ar six instruments of music involved in idol worship, and it says six times that "he set it up" (Dan. 3:1-3, 5, 7). He is king of Babylon, and this is the last form of government on the earth at the second coming -- Revelation 17, "MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT." Nebuchadnezzar, as Pharaoh is called a "dragon" (Jer. 51:34; Rev. 12:1-4). <br>  15. Haman. He is called an "adversary," which s the meaning of the word "Satan" (Esther 7:6). He persecutes the Jew, as Pharaoh and the Antichrist (Rev. 12:17), and hangs, as Judas and Absalom (Esther 7:10: Deut. 21:23; Gal. 3:13). <br>  16. Solomon. He is associated with the number 666 (2 Chron. 9:13), and six lions are on six steps on one side and six on the other (2 Chron. 9:18-1|`|1WX6ZYWlaa	The Book of Zechariah is of tremendous importance in viewing history from the time of Zechariah to the reuturn of the Lord Jesus Christ. One of the most significant prophetic events is the rise of an individual known as the antichrist.  Although THAT IS NOT SPECIFICALLY WHAT HIS TITLE IS in the old testament, it certainly fits him well. John said there were many antichrists present in his day. 1 John 2:18, but spoke of one who would be the most vehement advesary of God to ever live apart from Satan himself 1 John 4:3.  When we come to Zechariah 11:15-17 we come face to face with his being, He is not a demon or a fallen angel, but an evil person whom the prophet identifies as a "foolish shephard" (verse15). In verse 17 he is called an "imposter" (KJV, "idol."  archaic for "pretender").  He is a false shepherd as contrast to the true shephard, the Lord Jesus Christ.   The apostle John writing in the first century to a wide circle of believers, said, "Little children ...ye have heard the antichrist shall come" 1 John 2:18. So the coming of the antichrist was common knowledge.  The apostle Paul wrote specifically about the comming of this person "The man of sin will be revealled, the son of perdition" 2 Thess. 2:3.  Alluded to by the Lord in John 5:43. Jesus was echoing the theme of Zechariah 11 that Israel would reject the true shephard and accept a false one.  In Matthew 24 Jesus associated the Antichrist as the one responsible for the abomination of desolations, which will occur in the middle of the 7 year covenant he will establish with Israel (v v 11-15, Daniel 9:27)  See also Zechariah 11: 15-17  "The Lord said unto me take unto thee yet the insturments of a 'foolish shephard' ,,,he will eat the flesh of the fat, and tear their claws in pieces. Woe to the 'false shephard'...the sword shall be upon his arm, and upon his right eye, his arm shall be completely died up, and his right eye shall be utterly darkened."  That is ONE OF SEVERAL OLD TESTAMENT PASSAGES REFERRING TO THE ANTICHRIST. SEE ALSO: Isa 14: 13-14, Genesis3:15, Genesis 6:2, Ephesians 6:12, Matt 6:18,  Revelation 12 prophesis about the war that Satan and his demons will wage against Michael the archanegel and the holy angels.  Daniel 7:8 describes him as having "eyes like the eyes of a man." (cf verse 20). The eye is often a symbol of intelligence. Daniel 7:8 says the Antichrist will have "a mouth speaking great things" (verse 20). Effective leadership is predicated on the ability to communicate.  He will be a MASTER POLITICIAN. Revelation 6: 2 says he will conquer the world having a bow without any arrows.  That means he will conquer peacefully through politics.  THE WORLD WILL BE LOOKING FOR SOMEONE TO BRING PEACE AND ECONOMIC STABILITY. Daniel 11:21 says. "In his estate shall stand up a vile person (the antichrist) to whom they shall not give the honor of the kingdom; but he shall come in peaceably, and obtain the kingdom by flatteries."  SEE ALSO DANIEL 8:25 "Through his policy...he shall cause deceit to prosper in his hand, and he shall magnify himself in his heart, and by his peace shall destroy many; He shall stand up against the Prince of princes, but he shall be broken without hand."  He will be a wizard at building a world system of economics that feed his own pockets (Revelation 18).   According to Daniel 7:23 he "shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces."  He will be a military leader without equal... Revelation 13:4-7 says "They worship the beast (Antichrist), saying who is like the beast? Who is able to make war with him?...It was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them, and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations." The antichrist will gain favor over the entire world.  SEE ALSO Second Thessalonians 2:3-4 which identifies him as the "man of sin...the son of perdition, who opposeth and exalts himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped, so that he, as God, sits in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God. "He will command the whole world to worship him."  See  again Daniel 9: 27 and Matthew 24: 15|`|GC3qn1Aeaa	1st John chapter 2 speaks of antichrists, and 2 Thessalonians 2 talks about "the man of sin."

At first glance, the bible doesn`t seem interested in these questions.  Genesis 1assumes the existence of God and jumps right into describing His creation of the universe, the earth, plant and animal life, and humanity. At other point, the Bible insists that people can look at creation and reason from itto the existence of the Creator (ps 19:1-4; Rom 1:20) The great Greek thinkers insisted that life and the operation of the physical universe could be explained by an unborken sequence ofcauses and effects reaching back to the first cause - the uncaused cause that explains every effect that comes after.  Some will always feel courages and daring because they deny a Designer is necessary to explain the design.  They elaborate on all of the observable causes and effects of the natural sciences.  They insist they are taking responsibility for themselves.  Ultimately they are saying they don`t believe god because they have never seen Him.  the design should be enough to require that at the beginning of the seemingly endless string of causes and effects is God, the Uncaused Cause of everything else.<br>  There are so many prophesies told in the Old Testament that are exact to the letter in their fulfillment in the New Testament (and I do not have space here to list them) that it would be absolutely impossible for anything other than a True Living God to make these all come to being in such defining detail.|`|AA10034051	I dont believe in God.

The Bible tells us what happened and whats to come, which continues to happen. Everyone that tried to proove it wrong failed. Everyone is touched by God even if nonbeliever! When people pray and worship God their prayers are answered if it is Gods will and they have such a rejoiced feeling. Followers have seen many myracles and heard Gods voice. <br>  <br>  We also know there is a God by the base of scientific evidence. There is evidemce for most things that have been here in history. scientists, such as Ken Ham have studied the Bible and gotten logical proof, which is why he built the Answers in Gensis Museum.

atfKCzmPaa	What does the Bible say that helps us to understand what the soul is?<br>  Gen. 2:7: “Jehovah God proceeded to form the man out of dust from the ground and to blow into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man came to be a living soul.” (Notice that this does not say that man was given a soul but that he became a soul, a living person.) (The part of the Hebrew word here rendered “soul” is ne′phesh. KJ, AS, and Dy agree with that rendering. RS, JB, NAB read “being.” NE says “creature.” Kx reads “person.”)<br>  1?Cor. 15:45: “It is even so written: ‘The first man Adam became a living soul.’ The last Adam became a life-giving spirit.” (So the Christian Greek Scriptures agree with the Hebrew Scriptures as to what the soul is.) (The Greek word here translated “soul” is the accusative case of psy?khe′. KJ, AS, Dy, JB, NAB, and Kx also read “soul.” RS, NE, and TEV say “being.”)<br>  1?Pet. 3:20: “In Noah’s days .?.?. a few people, that is, eight souls, were carried safely through the water.” (The Greek word here translated “souls” is psy?khai′, the plural form of psy?khe′. KJ, AS, Dy, and Kx also read “souls.” JB and TEV say “people”; RS, NE, and NAB use “persons.”)<br>  Gen. 9:5: “Besides that, your blood of your souls [or, “lives”; Hebrew, from ne′phesh] shall I ask back.” (Here the soul is said to have blood.)<br>  Josh. 11:11: “They went striking every soul [Hebrew, ne′phesh] that was in it with the edge of the sword.” (The soul is here shown to be something that can be touched by the sword, so these souls could not have been spirits.)<br>  <br>  Do other scholars who are not Jehovah’s Witnesses acknowledge that this is what the Bible says the soul is?<br>  “There is no dichotomy [division] of body and soul in the O[ld] T[estament]. The Israelite saw things concretely, in their totality, and thus he considered men as persons and not as composites. The term nepe? [ne′phesh], though translated by our word soul, never means soul as distinct from the body or the individual person. .?.?. The term [psy?khe′] is the N[ew] T[estament] word corresponding with nepe?. It can mean the principle of life, life itself, or the living being.”—New Catholic Encyclopedia (1967), Vol. XIII,?pp.?449, 450.<br>  “The Hebrew term for ‘soul’ (nefesh, that which breathes) was used by Moses .?.?.?, signifying an ‘animated being’ and applicable equally to nonhuman beings. .?.?. New Testament usage of psychē (‘soul’) was comparable to nefesh.”—The New Encyclop?dia Britannica (1976), Macrop?dia, Vol. 15, p. 152.<br>  “The belief that the soul continues its existence after the dissolution of the body is a matter of philosophical or theological speculation rather than of simple faith, and is accordingly nowhere expressly taught in Holy Scripture.”—The Jewish Encyclopedia (1910), Vol. VI, p. 564.<br>  <br>  Can the human soul die?<br>  Ezek. 18:4: “Look! All the souls—to me they belong. As the soul of the father so likewise the soul of the son—to me they belong. The soul* that is sinning—it itself will die.” (*Hebrew reads “the ne′phesh.” KJ, AS, RS, NE, and Dy render it “the soul.” Some translations say “the man” or “the person.”)<br>  Matt. 10:28: “Do not become fearful of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul [or, “life”]; but rather be in fear of him that can destroy both soul* and body in Gehenna.” (*Greek has the accusative case of psy?khe′. KJ, AS, RS, NE, TEV, Dy, JB, and NAB all render it “soul.”)<br>  Acts 3:23: “Indeed, any soul [Greek, psy?khe′] that does not listen to that Prophet will be completely destroyed from among the people.”<br>  <br>  What is the origin of Christendom’s belief in an immaterial, immortal soul?<br>  “The Christian concept of a spiritual soul created by God and infused into the body at conception to make man a living whole is the fruit of a long development in Christian philosophy. Only with Origen [died c. 254?C.E.] in the East and St.?Augustine [died 430?C.E.] in the West was the soul established as a spiritual substance and a philosophical concept formed of its nature. .?.?. His [Augustine’s] doctrine .?.?. owed much (including some shortcomings) to Neoplatonism.”—New Catholic Encyclopedia (1967), Vol. XIII, pp.?452,?454.<br>  The concept of immortality is a product of Greek thinking, whereas the hope of a resurrection belongs to Jewish thought. .?.?. Following Alexander’s conquests Judaism gradually absorbed Greek concepts.”—Dictionnaire Encyclopédique de la Bible (Valence, France; 1935), edited by Alexandre Westphal, Vol. 2, p. 557.<br>  “Immortality of the soul is a Greek notion formed in ancient mystery cults and elaborated by the philosopher Plato.”—Presbyterian Life, May?1, 1970, p.?35.|`|1CS2KR7Taa	"Gasp" has put it very nicely: "the soul is the self and the self is existence".<br>  We really only exist in our souls, but our souls are only in potential when we are born, and we have to work to develop them to the state we can actually feel our existence within them. It is not an automatic process.<br>  And the only way to develop our souls is to connect to others, leaving our self interest behind, as the soul can only be revealed within our mutual connections.<br>  And this is the purpose, to discover this loving connection between us, to understand that we are all ONE.<br>  Here is a short animation that you might find helpful:<br>  <a href="http://www.kabbalah.info/engkab/kabbalah-video-clips/the-cogwheel-adventures" rel="nofollow">http://www.kabbalah.info/engkab/kabbalah...</a><br>  I hope you find it helpful, all the best.|`|OhhKRahTaa	Its at the bottom of our shoe and it comforts our feet.|`|F4Wu6JXyaa	If the word has any meaning at all, then you ARE your soul.

Then, I started talking to people at our local religion center and discovered that I was actually a Buddhist! When I asked about the religion, I could just tell it was the right fit. You can tell when a religion is right for you. You know when:<br>  <br>  - You don't have to force yourself to believe in it, it just comes naturally<br>  - You're not afraid to stick up for it if people make fun of it<br>  - You don't live your whole life fearing this 'God'<br>  <br>  And yes, my goodness. I hate when people impose their views on me. And I know that I am kind of doing that right now, I was just trying to give you an example. Research different faiths before you find one that's just right for you. If you don't find it, you are either an Atheist or maybe you could consider converting to Pastafarianism...?|`|AA10552086	Good for you.

lTLaQ5i9aa	Durante varias décadas las drogas han sido uno de los principales problemas de la sociedad. Hay aumento de los costos se han gastado en la guerra contra las drogas y un sinnúmero de dólares gastados en la rehabilitación, pero el problema sigue existiendo. No sólo el problema de las drogas ha aumentado, pero los problemas relacionados con la droga van en aumento. El uso indebido de drogas es una causa de muerte en nuestro país. Algunos nacen adictos, mientras que otros se los usuarios. <br>  <br>  Muchos creen que la legalización de las drogas disminuiría la delincuencia. Se?alan que la legalización de las drogas sería disuadir futuros actos delictivos. También hacen hincapié en la prohibición y el contraste. Cuando el público se dio cuenta de que la prohibición no se podía cumplir la ley fue derogada. A partir de esto, se puede deducir el mismo de la legalización de las drogas. La legalización de alcohol no aumentó el alcoholismo, así que ?por qué las drogas que aumentan el uso indebido de drogas? <br>  <br>  Sin embargo, las drogas no debe ser legalizado porque habría un aumento en el uso indebido de drogas debido a su disponibilidad. Una vez legalizados, los medicamentos se convertiría en más barato y más accesible a las personas que anteriormente no había probado drogas, debido a su alto precio o el riesgo jurídico. El uso indebido de drogas cohete! Toxicómanos, que tienden a detener, no por elección, sino porque los medicamentos no son accesibles ahora pienso que si la adicción a las drogas se hicieron legales. <br>  <br>  Aunque la gente cree que la legalización de las drogas disminuiría la delincuencia, las drogas debe seguir siendo ilegal en los EE.UU. porque habría un aumento del uso indebido de drogas y un rápido aumento de enfermedades como el SIDA. Los Estados Unidos no puede permitirse este problema. Se ha convertido en una potencia mundial mediante el fortalecimiento de su pueblo por no matarlos. El uso indebido de drogas ha empeorado, con sus efectos sobre los bebés de crack, los drogadictos, y la IV usuario.

[i know info about her without wikipedia i just don't feel like typin it out when i can just copy n paste =p]<br>  <br>  Rosa Louise McCauley Parks (February 4, 1913 – October 24, 2005) was an African American civil rights activist whom the U.S. Congress later called the "Mother of the Modern-Day Civil Rights Movement".<br>  <br>  On December 1, 1955 in Montgomery, Alabama, Parks, age 42, refused to obey bus driver James Blake's order that she give up her seat to make room for a white passenger. Her action was not the first of its kind: Irene Morgan, in 1946, and Sarah Louise Keys, in 1955, had won rulings before the Supreme Court and the Interstate Commerce Commission respectively in the area of interstate bus travel. But unlike these previous individual actions of civil disobedience, Parks' action sparked the Montgomery Bus Boycott.<br>  <br>  Parks's act of defiance became an important symbol of the modern Civil Rights Movement and Parks became an international icon of resistance to racial segregation. She organized and collaborated with civil rights leaders, including boycott leader Martin Luther King, Jr., helping to launch him to national prominence in the civil rights movement.<br>  <br>  Parks eventually received many honors ranging from the 1979 Spingarn Medal to the Congressional Gold Medal, a posthumous statue in the United States Capitol's National Statuary Hall, and the posthumous honor of lying in honor[1] at the Capitol Rotunda.<br>  <br>  At the time of her action, Parks was secretary of the Montgomery chapter of the NAACP and had recently attended the Highlander Folk School, a Tennessee center for workers' rights and racial equality. Nonetheless, she took her action as a private citizen "tired of giving in". Although widely honored in later years for her action, she also suffered for it, losing her job as a seamstress in a local department store. Eventually, she moved to Detroit, Michigan, where she found similar work. From 1965 to 1988 she served as secretary and receptionist to African-American U.S. Representative John Conyers. After retirement from this position, she wrote an autobiography and lived a largely private life in Detroit. In her final years she suffered from dementia and became embroiled in a lawsuit filed on her behalf against American hip-hop duo OutKast. Her death in 2005 was a front-page story in the United States' leading newspapers.|`|A7GV3lYkaa	yeah there are many that died while shooting each other in gang realated gangs.  they still do they were famous in their gangs|`|Vu726Q18aa	rosa parks!<br>  jackie robetson!<br>  George washington Carver!<br>  Barak Obama|`|300aa90c6e4459736882fabd827b612faa	Malcomn X, Jessie Owens|`|ZSlXrXsCaa	Bob Marley
71qbN5l6aa	I had to do that in junior high. After reading a few different ones I basically just wrote a short story kind of like others but different people/situations etc. Just think there are no real rules, pretty much anything can happen. (Like a child being born a grown adult out of Zeus' head. This is how Athena was born.) We had to make up a god/goddess and tell how they were born and what they were god/goddess of.<br>  <br>  Some of my favorite short ones are Echo and Narcissus, Daedalus and Icarus (probly not so short), Aphrodite's birth. King Midas is good, and the super long Odyssey. The 12 labors of Herakles (Hercules) is good too but long.|`|ztrRs62Daa	Um, in Greek. Ancient Greek.<br>  <br>  Well, presumably this is a school assignment? Greek myths often had a moral to the story so you could start with that? You would do well to read some Greek myths to get some background knowledge. You probably don't want to be reading things like the Iliad (which is SO gory.. Homer had mad Epic poet skills) which are really long. You want things like the Minotaur..<br>  <br>  Also, I figured you meant myths as in stories, as opposed to Greek Mythology, like the gods and stuff.. Well, here are some sites you could check out:<br>  <a href="http://www.historyforkids.org/learn/greeks/religion/greekrelig.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.historyforkids.org/learn/gree...</a><br>  <a href="http://atschool.eduweb.co.uk/carolrb/greek/greek1.html" rel="nofollow">http://atschool.eduweb.co.uk/carolrb/gre...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.mythweb.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mythweb.com/</a><br>  <br>  No offence that these are for kids either, I'm an A Level student and I still use these!! Good luck :)|`|y7z9hCDNaa	what do you mean can you be more specific please|`|ze6CbvCeaa	The greek myths weren't written at all, they were passed down 'mouth-to-ear', in fact, Homer knew the whole 'Odyssey' by heart. Later they were written down using the Cyrillic alphabet, in greek, obviously. Today they are printed onto sheets of paper and available in many different languages. You have absolute freedom of choice! :)
OUbNSXjJaa	Individual's choice.|`|IIhiSprlaa	I'd say no. Reason being: I haven't even heard of all souls day; and I don't believe in souls.|`|dDMOJWxwaa	In Western Christianity, All Souls' Day commemorates the faithful departed. This day is observed in the Roman Catholic Church, churches of the Anglican Communion, Old Catholic Churches, and to some extent among Protestants. The Eastern Orthodox Church observes several All Souls' Days during the year. The Roman Catholic celebration is based on the doctrine that the souls of the faithful which at death have not been cleansed from venial sins, or have not fully atoned for mortal sins, cannot attain the beatific vision in heaven yet, and that they may be helped to do so by prayer and by the sacrifice of the Mass.<br>  <br>  All Souls' Day is also known as the Feast of All Souls, Commemoration of all the Faithful Departed. The official Latin designation Commemoratio omnium Fidelium Defunctorum, on which this last name is based, is rendered more literally in Portuguese Comemora??o de todos os Fiéis Defuntos and many other languages. Day of the Dead (Día de los Muertos or de los Difuntos) is used in Spanish-speaking countries, and Thursday of the Dead (Yom el Maouta) in Lebanon, Palestine and Syria.<br>  <br>  The Western celebration of All Souls' Day is on 2 November and follows All Saints' Day, which commemorates the departed who have attained the beatific vision. If 2 November falls on a Sunday, the Mass is of All Souls, but the Office is that of the Sunday. However, Morning and Evening Prayer (Lauds and Vespers) for the Dead, in which the people participate, may be said. In pre-1969 calendars, which some still follow, All Souls Day is instead transferred, whenever 2 November falls on a Sunday, to the next day, 3 November, which is the case for this year in 2008.<br>  <br>  The Eastern Orthodox Church dedicates several days throughout the year to the dead, mostly on Saturdays, because of Jesus' resting in the tomb on Saturday.|`|AA11058044	I'd stay home every day if they'd keep sending me a pay cheque.<br>  <br>  Sadly, All Souls Day is not one of the days our union negotiated for us as a paid day off, so I will spend it sitting at my computer, on Yahoo!

U5zcbHuZaa	It depends upon the court, the judge, and other factors. If a police officer knowingly enters lies made up by the officer herself and does not bother to investigate anything that is said against the defendant and then if the defendant is assigned a public defender who has an impossible case load (50 or more clients at once, impossilbe to serve any one of them), then you don't really need any evidence at all, just a bunch of liars to gang up on the person.<br>  <br>  After I was falsely accused of heinous things I did not do -- anyone who says I did is a liar and can rot in hell because that is exactly where such people will go -- I found out some very painful truths about the "justice system." Not only did my lawyers not do their jobs, but one of them even commited his own crimes against me. His name is Jay Ames, he works for the Spokane County Public Defender's office and this is not slander because I can prove he he committed crimes against me.<br>  <br>  Also, the police officer, Detective Stephanie Barkley is a criminal. She commits crimes against citizens of Spokane, Washington USA. She committed a crime against me and I can prove it. She falsified her police report.<br>  <br>  And guess what, I did some more research. The underfunding of the public defenders office by the County Commissioners, yep, makes 'em all criminals under Washington state law because they are knowingly denying rights guaranteed by U.S. Constitution. John Rodgers, the head of the public defender's office here, he is a good guy. He has been telling the Commissioners for years that his office is a joke that can't serve its clients.<br>  <br>  Oh yeah, I did lots of research.<br>  <br>  Watch out for kangaroo courts, it's where monkey trials occurs.|`|YTLePvkVaa	Simply the case is closed. If there is evidence that you are lying then it becomes slander. If there is no evidence  from both sides it simply is case closed. <br>  <br>  Innocent until proven guilty.|`|aRaMjnQ1aa	Anyone who is accused of a crime, will remain guilty until proven innocent.<br>  <br>  So when no sound evidence appears in the court room, i assume the accused will be presented as innocent.|`|KqiiT1WSaa	No, if there is no evidence that you cannot convict anyone.<br>  <br>  Yes, it is slander if you accuse someone without any evidence|`|Y9ruXnKcaa	Prosecutors accuse individuals of being guilty all the time and sometimes they are wrong.  They are never convicted for slander or libel.|`|83evCnFHaa	yh it is slander but they can still say<br>  LA LA LAAAAAAAAAA|`|DIlNnjf8aa	If someone accuses another of zina and fails to produce the 4 witnesses, the accuser gets the penalty the accused would have received and their testimony cannot be accepted again in a court.|`|kkO87h0Xaa	No way.

It is timeless and for all peoples.<br>  <br>  However, within the Old Testament there were certain rules and practices only pertaining to the Jews of that period and these specific rules were identified as being only for them and only as a shadow of things to come and that they were given as a teacher.<br>  <br>  The New Testament is the fulfillment of the Old Testament and the teaching example given through the Jewish people now applies to all who seek God and an eternal salvation.|`|AA10637643	The scriptures are for everyone and anyone... and wonderful for those who follow them.<br>  <br>  Scriptures actually speak of our day.

It is mostly as secular works that, if not universal, are at least highly readable for most people in Western culture.<br>  They are primarily didactic sources that are neutral or absent of religious overtones.<br>  <br>  Aesop's fables: An educational resource for over 2000 years. I have frequently found that young people unfamiliar with them also are unfamiliar with cause and effect, and the consequences of their actions.<br>  <br>  Illusions by Richard Bach: A very spiritual book for me. It tells the story how we are all the Messiah.<br>  <br>  Bartlett's Book of Quotations: Described by Kurt Vonnegut Jr. as the "Atheists Bible".<br>  <br>  The Screwtape Letters by CS Lewis. Though technically a religious book, it is actually more to do with the living with the weaknesses and doubts of the human condition, and not blaming "demons" for our own shortcomings.
Sm7Oev8Iaa	It depends on your perspective of life. If you see life as valuable thing it could be heartbreaking at first, but God said " Those who morn shall be comforted". Also if you don't care about life when someone that is close to you who dies you may not care at all.<br>  <br>  The reason I say all this is in recent years I have had a brother, best friend, and grandmother die. At first it felt like someone had dropped a two ton weight on my head.

It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation. <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what! <br>  <br>  Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|ao2mP5pNaa	It's the end of the line.

zZxX5PXBaa	Megan, I think you'll find that grieving goes through many stages, and you'll be a long time before you're really 'over' it at all. Some of what happens will just seem silly.<br>  <br>  When my father died, I felt very little at the time, regret I'd missed a chance to visit him shortly before, but it hadn't been an easy relationship, and there was some relief. Then, weeks later, we lost a family pet, and suddenly I was in floods of tears. Even then I think I realised it wasn't for the pet. Tears can come very suddenly, very unexpectedly, and what triggers the memories and feelings is different for everyone.<br>  <br>  I think you'll find that this time of not feeling that he is with you will pass. Some people go through a similar thing of not being able to remember what the person looked like. But you have your lifetime of memories, and they won't leave you, and there will be many, many things your father did that will remain in the world.<br>  <br>  Talking to him out loud is the most natural thing in the world. I can't say if he hears, I honestly don't know, and I doubt if anyone does for sure. But what's more natural than to speak to him.<br>  <br>  I think you'd be wise to not focus too much on signs. But accept the fact that many many things will remind you of him, and sometimes that will be painful, and sometimes it will remind you of something when you really need it. Don't be afraid to talk about your feelings with family and friends ... it may show you something of your friendships ... which are real and which are less so. It's hard for friends to know what to say, but the good ones will do their best, and if they say the wrong thing, forgive them, and stay in touch. But don't ever be ashamed to cry, and if anyone gives you a hard time over it, just stay away from them. I've been surprised by the places that real compassion and understanding can come from, and I hope you can find that compassion too. Above all, don' tjudge yourself for your grief. It's natural, and it's a sign that you loved your father. Hard as it is to bear, it would be worse if there was no grief at all.<br>  <br>  Hard to know how to close. What comes to mind is the blessing from the book of Numbers chapter 6. In our church it's a tradition to sing it at baptisms, but sometimes it suits the end of life too.<br>  <br>  The LORD bless thee, and keep thee:<br>  <br>  The LORD make his face shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee:<br>  <br>  The LORD lift up his countenance upon thee, and give thee peace.|`|tManvxfQaa	I am Sorry for your loss .|`|332vXA6oaa	The best thing you can do is draw closer to God, he is the one that can truly comfort you.

The pain will never completely go away, but it will not hurt so much after time.

Your reaction is unfortunately, quite normal.  It is OK to miss him.  Being heart broken only means that you loved him.  Your heart will ache for the rest of your life, but you just get more and more used to life without him as time goes on.<br>  It is far worse to lose a child than a parent.<br>  <br>  No, you're not getting any 'signs' from him.  That's also a good sign.  It means that you're not hallucinating or going crazy.  I'm sorry- but he cannot show you that he's there, because he's gone.

He is gone. Instead, remember all the times he smiled at you while he was alive. THOSE were his signs. Those are the memories he wanted you to have when he left. <br>  Close your eyes and picture him smiling at you. There is his sign. He was thinking of you now, even back then. And don't worry about all the tears. It'll always make you cry a bit when you remember that smile. Trust me. 15 years and I'm misting up even now. You'll be fine.|`|UKPQN0UKaa	No one really knows for sure what happens after we die. Your father's spirit could be very near to you right now. He could be in heaven. He could be in some other realm we haven't even learned about yet. The important thing is to remind yourself that he's okay, wherever he is. It sounds like his death was sudden and unexpected. I'm sure leaving you and your family was the very last thing he wanted to do. Sometimes this world is just so cruel and random... :(<br>  <br>  I'm so sorry for your loss. I know that doesn't help, but I am.<br>  <br>  Just let yourself feel. If you're mad, let yourself be mad. If you're sad, let yourself cry. Write down how you feel... that can be very therapeutic.<br>  <br>  When a friend of mine passed away, I wrote him letters for a while. I know it sounds silly since he'll never see them, but who knows? He could have heard my thoughts. And if nothing else, I got my feelings out.<br>  <br>  One day at a time...

5HPkIxZHaa	sometimes yes. in the indian subcontinent, there is always ethnic conflict. people like punjabis, gujaratis, tamil, bengali, rathores, kashmiris are always fighting about whos superiour. also hindu muslim conflicts. also north and south conflicts. ethnic groups from north india are actually completly different from the south. the northern people are caucasians while the southern part is (dark/dravidian). indians always discriminate over this. <br>  <br>  well , as for africans, they  shouldnt be fighting about facial sturctures since they have the same facial sturcture. they were all decendants of slaves from the 16th century, whether in the carribean or the americas. they couldnt have evolved in just 200 years. africans in america are lighter than africans because they have white ancestry for when europeans raped/had affairs with their slaves.|`|OZjlW5utaa	Yeah that's true, but probably more hurtful, my moms always said, that black peoples worst enemy are themselves, Some are constantly picking on things that don't fit in. When a black girl rocks her natural hair, it'll be a black women to disagree with it, and a white lady will love it. Dont get me wrong there are plenty of different black people who don't do this.<br>  Even as a quarter black person, someone accused me of thinking I'm better then blacks because I'm light skinned when I'm already naturally light skinned.<br>  <br>  This also happens in other cultures, where being a lighter skin arab is better then being a darker skin one. White people also have these insecurities and pin point undesirable features on other whites, but this I think is much more low scale.<br>  <br>  That's why I love being multiracial, I feel like I can sense all of these insecurities while dealing with them.|`|npTZTzWRaa	black people need to stick together like we did to get through slavery and the struggle<br>  <br>  The problem is that many black people have gotten so pampered and familiarized with 'white culture' that they abandon their roots. Also it would generally be in someones best monetary interest to date interacially because white communities are generally economically more well off than black communities, this is the 'house slave' mentality because the house slave would favor his master over his fellow blacks because his master was better off while the blacks were in turmoil, this is still the case today but to a lesser degree, the black community is in turmoil in comparison to the white community which is part of why some black people prefer to intermingle with whites and make mixed babies instead of fellow blacks and endure the hardship that is being a  black family in America.  The term 'sellout' derives from black people who would betray their own  people for their own personal benefit, as house slaves would 'sellout' fellow slaves to their master for there benefit.|`|ye33tNkOaa	yes...but i think it's also based on insecurities in an individual. to make himself feel better about his own short coming, he has to break others down. i've noticed this, because i work in a large, urban school district, that the kids ALWAYS try and talk about each other.  it infuriates me...i used to be the kid my peers talked about. and when i went to a HBC, ppl used to talk about the way i talked, because i was raised in a suburban area.  so i don't know how we can rectify this situation...but it is troubling|`|4Vmlf902aa	It isn't like it'll ever stop!

It's one thing for someone of a different race to insult you; it's far more different when it's one of your own relatives praising you for having 'good hair' and 'red skin'.  <br>  <br>  Ethnicism is a word that should be made official.  There is too much discrimination within the races, and of course, if we're discriminating against our own kind, what's to stop other people from discriminating against us?<br>  <br>  From West Indian people, I've heard, "You don't LOOK African; you're too light to be African!"

You sometimes have to conclude the phrase "Who knows you the best than those close to you?" to be correct.<br>  <br>  <br>  We as being people in society know what racism means.  We know what discrimination means, but we sometimes fail to understand racism amongst each other within our own race. When it comes down to outsiders being racist to us(your own race) many times people become hypocritical especially if their racism amongst their own people is the targeting subject for outside racism.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Name everything outsiders claim to be racist about other races, then compare those with inner racism in each race(White, Black, Asian, Hispanic)  and see who is more racist after doing the comparison.  That's why when people ask which race is more racist, It's easy to say anyone.
kclpa0Abaa	Depends on the reason. There are people that go thru hell in school because they are gay. In my city, they have the Harvey Milk High School, which is a safety school for people in general, but targeting LGBTs particularly. To me this school has a place and is not segregating.

Sorry for the sarcasm!<br>  <br>  Job 9:23 (NIV) When a scourge brings sudden death, God* (*NOT SATAN, but God!) mocks the despair of the INNOCENT. <br>  <br>  Job 9:17 (NIV) He* (*God… NOT SATAN, but God!) would crush me with a storm and multiply my wounds FOR NO REASON. <br>  <br>  Job 9:24 (NIV) When a land falls into the hands of the wicked* (*like the USA falling into the hands of Obama?), he* (*God) blindfolds its judges. If it is not he, then who is it*? (*Certainly not SATAN!)<br>  <br>  Lamentations 3:37-38 (infallible King James Version) Who is he that saith, and it cometh to pass, when the Lord commandeth it not? OUT OF THE MOUTH OF THE MOST HIGH PROCEEDETH NOT EVIL AND GOOD*? (*Preachers lie, they say that “God is GOOD”, but not firstly EVIL… read it again FIRST EVIL and then “good” as a teaser!)  <br>  <br>  Exodus 4:11 (NIV) The Lord said to him, “Who gave man his mouth? Who makes him deaf or mute? Who gives him sight or makes him blind? Is it not I, the Lord? (This Bible God loves to brag about his endeavors! How barbaric can you get?)<br>  <br>  Amos 3:6 (infallible King James Version) Shall a trumpet be blown in the city, and the people not be afraid? shall there be EVIL in a city, and the lord hath not done it?* (*ALL THE EVIL IN THE WORLD COMES FROM GOD… NOT FROM SATAN…!!! Praise the LORD!!!)<br>  <br>  Proverbs 16:4 (NIV)  The LORD hath made all things for himself: yea, EVEN THE WICKED FOR THE DAY OF EVIL.<br>  <br>  No primitive religion in the world is as wicked as the Bible God religion. Christians made up in their mind about what Christianity ought to be all about in spite of the overwhelming primitive barbarism describing the Bible God! Christians need to be masochistically oriented to function in this world!<br>  <br>  Ruth 1:20-21 (NIV) “Don't call me Naomi,” she told them. “Call me Mara, because the Almighty has made my life very bitter. I went away full, but the Lord has brought me back empty. Why call me Naomi? The Lord has afflicted me; the Almighty* (*NOT SATAN, but God Almighty! PRAISE THE LORD…! Sweet Jesus! Amen?) has brought misfortune upon me.”<br>  <br>  Proverbs 1:26-28 (NIV) I* (*God NOT SATAN, but God!)  in turn will laugh at your disaster; I WILL MOCK WHEN CALAMITY OVERTAKES YOU* (*Preachers are taking advantage of any calamity like a forthcoming California Earthquake to convey a “message” from the Bible God) - when calamity overtakes you like a storm* (*please read carefully… it doesn’t say “when I send calamity!” but when it happens the SOB Bible God takes advantage of it! God is also at the mercy of the weather conditions! You need to have a very low IQ and be very dishonest to qualify as a “minister of the Word of God”!), when disaster sweeps over you like a whirlwind, when distress and trouble overwhelm you. Then they will call to me but I will not answer; they* (*God’s people) will look for me but will not find me* (* yeah, what does God have to do with all that?).<br>  <br>  There goes the “I’m with you to the end” or is it only a teaser joke? This God is real only in the clever mind of the Bible writers… <br>  <br>  Jeremiah 11: 14 "Do not pray for this people nor offer any plea or petition for them, BECAUSE I* (*God) WILL NOT LISTEN WHEN THEY CALL TO ME IN THE TIME OF THEIR DISTRESS.<br>  <br>  Nothing scares primitive religious people more than the idea that their God doesn’t listen to them! It still works today! The Christian idea that this whimsical God always listens to them is wishful hoping that the chances are just right that God will answer on the spot, or later on, or never! It is just like praying to a stick or a rock or any other more benevolent Heathen God and getting the SAME IDENTICAL RESULT!<br>  <br>  Romans 9:11-15  Yet, before the twins were born or had done anything good or bad–in order that God's purpose in election might stand: not by works but by him who calls–she was told, “The older will serve the younger.” Just as it is written: “Jacob* (*Israel) I loved, but Esau* (*Arabs) I hated.”  What then shall we say? IS GOD UNJUST? NOT AT ALL!* (*Saint Paul says so… because he is telling you he speaks for God!)  For he says to Moses, “I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.”* (*the Christian clergy preaches you all the opposite that God is “no respecter of persons” when the Bible writers made it clear that he very picky just for the heck of it! BTW, one of the reasons why Christians do not favor Palestinians at all unless they convert to Christianity is in this Bible story that is taught in Sunday School session not over the public media!  If the Palestinians convert to Christianity there is no guessing of what will happen. Christians favor for Israel will be put on hold! Except for Christians in America most Christians elsewhere don’t give a hoot about politics!) <br>  <br>   Malachi 1:4  (NIV) Edom* (*Esau… Arabs) may say, "Though we have been crushed, we will rebuild the ruins."  But this is what the LORD Almighty says: "They may build, but I will demolish. They will be called the Wicked Land, A PEOPLE ALWAYS UNDER THE WRATH OF THE LORD* (*How would you like to be one of them? No FREE WILL FOR YOU! NO Salvation, either! God doesn’t like you for ever just for the heck of it! AND GOD NEVER CHANGES!)<br>  <br>  Isaiah 45:7 (infallible King James Version) I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and CREATE EVIL: I the LORD* (*NOT SATAN, but God) do all these things.<br>  <br>  Job 42:11 (infallible King James Version) Then came there unto him all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance before, and did eat bread with him in his house: and they bemoaned him, and comforted him over ALL THE EVIL that the LORD* (*NOT SATAN, BUT GOD!) had brought upon him:* (*God had a plan to have ALL of Job’s children slaughtered! The heck with family love and affection…!!! Isn’t God so wonderful?! Life is so cheap in the Bible!)<br>  <br>  When was the last time that a Christian blamed God for any of his/her misfortune? I bet they only credit Satan!  No wonder that the only way to pacify this whimsical sadistic God the Bible writers came up with the idea of sacrificing his “Only Begotten” son in human form… after he was beaten to a pulp to be properly tenderized then thoroughly marinated in Roman soldiers’ spit, and crucified totally naked as a “spotless Lamb of God taking away the sins of the world!” There is no historical record that the Roman soldiers ever dressed their victim’s genital area in a diaper before hanging them on any cross! How religiously primitive can you still get in today’s society…? Now Christians delightfully snack on this God spit flavored meat and drink of his Holy Blood for “salvation” (John 6:53). Europe is waking up out of the Dark Ages of Church domination far ahead of us here in America! I guess that religious gullibility will still be in effect until our IQ, common sense and self esteem improve to a decent level… Hey, are we still evolving, or what?  The Bible writers were very silly to credit their idea of a God with so much EVIL when they could have done a much better job blaming the Devil all along…! They would have kept me fooled to this day, too!|`|97031ab5ff9bcf387a9d1278f60ddafeaa	(Romans 13:1-4) .?.?.Let every soul be in subjection to the superior authorities, for there is no authority except by God; the existing authorities stand placed in their relative positions by God. 2?Therefore he who opposes the authority has taken a stand against the arrangement of God; those who have taken a stand against it will receive judgment to themselves. 3?For those ruling are an object of fear, not to the good deed, but to the bad.

If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him; because everything in the world—the desire of the flesh and the desire of the eyes and the showy display of one’s means of life—does not originate with the Father, but originates with the world. ?Furthermore, the world is passing away and so is its desire, but he that does the will of God remains forever."|`|Cvp2WRcsaa	Your not quoting the Bible to prove it's point, your just using it to support yours.

The second one is talking about how the devil tries to trick people. The third one is saying that Heaven is seperate from earth. The fourth one has nothing to do with governments being controlled by the devil. <br>  Hope this clarifies and if you have questions you should ask a preacher or someone who can help you understand a bit more. <br>  And to any Christians out there who may have been a bit thrown off by this, just remember that some people out there don't want you to believe so they throw this sorta stuff at you to confuse you.

Time -- Even with intention behind the effort, certain parts just take an inordinant amount of time to transition from one step to the next.<br>  2.) Ethics -- Most ethics committees consider the possibility of creating life truly from scratch to be immoral and dangerous.  It is conceivable, and without a way to measure the risk of, that the new evolutionary root that would be formed would be stronger than existing life, and escape the laboratory.<br>  <br>  But let me ask you this --<br>  <br>  Let's say both of these problems are overcome, and scientists produce life from an organic soup.<br>  <br>  Are you going to accept this proves abiogenesis as a viable hypothesis, or are you going to assert that the fact it took scientists doing it as "proof" that intelligent involvement is required in the formation of life?|`|ao2mP5pNaa	I'm no biologist, but even a single-celled organism is rather complex when compared to lumps of the building blocks piled sporadically about a landscape.

If someone can produce a scientifically valid means to do so, they have at least a million dollar prize waiting for them in the Origin of Life prize....not to mention a Nobel.<br>  <a href="http://lifeorigin.org/" rel="nofollow">http://lifeorigin.org/</a><br>  <br>  The fallacy of the Miller-Urey experiment has been demonstrated in various followup experiments and their experiment failed to use oxygen which is now known to have always occurred in earth's atmosphere in the distant past from oxides found in the oldest rocks on earth. They also filtered their results which produced tar and other compunds which are fatal to life. Their results are skewed. Anyone can produce a few amino acids...the problem is that all life forms use left-handed amino acids and the Miller-Urey experiments produced both right and left-handed amino acids....such a combination is the opposite of life and poisonous to it. When a person dies, all their left-handed amino acids revert to a mixture of right and left. We never see those mixtures go the opposite way TOWARDS life. This homochirality of amino acids would also have had to preceeded any origin of life.<br>  <a href="http://www.godandscience.org/evolution/origin_homochirality.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.godandscience.org/evolution/o...</a><br>  <br>  Of the several hypothesis' we have today such as RNA origin or PNA origin or Iron-sulpur or mineral clay, none of them have been scientifically proven and they have major fundamental problems with basic chemistry.<br>  <a href="http://www.godandscience.org/evolution/chemlife.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.godandscience.org/evolution/c...</a><br>  <br>  We do know that life cannot begin in the presence of oxygen since it oxidizes and breaks down chemical compunds...and you can't start life without oxygen since the ozone layer, which protects us from the sun's radiation, is made up of oxygen.

We are able to create RNA strands from said amino acids. We are now able to synthesize metabolic molecules (molecules which take and convert energy from other molecules) from inorganic molecules as well. We are able to create membranes which isolate those metabolic molecules into distinct and self-replicating "organisms". We have yet to create an actual prokaryote in a test-tube, but this will almost certainly occur within the next decade. If you're genuinely interested in abiogenesis, this is a wonderful, remarkable time to be alive, because it's happening, right now. <br>  <br>  On the other hand, if you're holding out hope that abiogenesis will pose some insurmountable obstacle to science and therefore somehow lend credibility to the Biblical account of Genesis, you're going to be very, very disappointed.

It must, so you turn around, you should see the light has dispelled the darkness and the only darkness is from your shadow. If you let the light go through you, then more darkness is dispelled. It seems that most of the darkness in the world is us. <br>  It seems like we have been given dominion over the earth and a commission to cultivate the earth and make it into a garden.

Maybe God works the opposite way, using love and truth to guide us, but we have work to do too. It seems to me your right and that fearing Satan is believing in his power and spreading knowledge of it is more like glorifying him. We are told that God is all powerful and he protects his own and to fear God, if we must fear. The good news must be more like that. You can believe a witch doctor can cause people to die of fear when he puts a hex on them, that's the nocebo affect, but you give him the power.

Amen !<br>  <br>  Lucifer and his assistant Satan were never high Sons of God; they all had lesser stations. Jesus Christ, Who is Coordinate Deity and the full Power of God here to and with us in our universe, Incarnated here as Son of God and Son of Man; during this time, in AD30, Jesus removed all the junior powers that Lucifer and Satan had; and they were replaced with loyal Sons of God.  In John 12:31-32 Jesus states: "Now is the judgment of this world; now shall the (former, fallen, planetary) prince of this world be cast out. and I, when I am lifted up, (in your hearts and minds) I will draw all men (and women and children) to Myself."<br>  <br>  I must state that our loving Savior Jesus Christ loves all humans and desires their eventual salvation unless they decide to fully reject this sacred free Gift of eternal Life in God's Light.  Those spiritually dumb humans who still believe that a devil or devels or demons or fallen angels, etc still have power, are now fully protected by Jesus since AD30; (at Pentecost, about 50 day after Jesus Ascended back into the Father and received all Power in Heaven and on earth) as Jesus sent Himself and the Father as One Spirit of Truth freely outpouring then and now upon all flesh --upon all humans !   That prevents any more demonic influence or possessions. "The devil made me do it" is a feeble cop-out from admitting that they did it !  <br>  <br>  God has made your freewill sovereign to be able to choose to follow God's will or not - do your own will.<br>  <br>  True Light is of God and is a Spirit Reality; blood and sacrifice are all from the dark minds of primitive religionists of long ago.

But their light did not reach the surface of the earth. On the first day, “there came to be light” because diffused light penetrated the cloud layers and became visible on the earth. The rotating earth thus began to have alternating day and night. (Genesis 1:1-3,?5) The sources of that light still remained invisible from the earth. During the fourth creative period, however, a notable change took place. The sun, the moon, and the stars were now made “to shine upon the earth.” (Genesis 1:17) “God proceeded to make” them in that they could now be seen from the earth.|`|qPbKJeXzaa	Neither.

vljYq4Fyaa	Marriage can be either a legal contract and/or a religious standing.<br>  Most couples either have both or simply the legal version. <br>  There has been an increase of couples who either place no value on the legal aspects with consideration for the legal responsibility or simply refuse to partake of a legal contract out of protest against church doctrine and the discrimination against same sex marriages. These couples have non-traditional ceremonies and do consider themselves married on a spiritual level.<br>  <br>  My marriage was performed by an ordained minister that officiated over the ceremony. Being as she is Pagan and the ceremony as I wrote it was Pagan oriented and took place overlooking a lake as opposed to inside of a church and officiated over by a Christian minister thends to prove that marriage is to be dictated by Christian ideologies. I should add that my marriage was legally registered and recognised by various countries when I was in them.<br>  <br>  One problem with attempting to define marriage by religion and calling the legal consideration a civil union would be the international considerations. Other countries do not seperate the two, the translation is either married or not as far as I have heard but there may be some that I am not aware of, being as I have not been everywhere and my language skills are limited to a couple of languages. With considerations for military deployments, business travels and vacations the constant differiantion of definition would be confusing.<br>  <br>  To simplify things, one could take the two different kinds of marriage that Arizona recognises as a standard and/or follow the proceedures required in Germany. In Arizona a couple may either be registered with a legal "Marriage" or a legally accepted "Covenant Marriage" which also incorperates religious aspects. Either way for legal purposes consideration is given as "Married." In germany a couple must be married in a legal ceremony to be recognised. Afterward the couple may if desired also follow through with a religious ceremony although this has no bering on the legal aspects and is not of interest to the government. It is strictly a choice of those involved and the remains out of government influance and/or influance toward the government.<br>  <br>  Edit: Any religious group that wants to influance the government and/or lobby to have their ideas pushed onto others should be taxed the same as any other business. <br>  <br>  Any church that wants to maintain their tax exempt status needs to respect that other religious practices are guaranteed under the constitution. Other religions also perform marriages and some not only accept and recognise marriages between same sex couples, they will perform/officiate the ceremony. Myself being an ordained Pagan minister and legally sponsored and registered with the US Military will perform/officiate such ceremonies. At this time they are not legally registered but are recognised within our religions.|`|VhtyM9Bpaa	They dodge this by saying it's a family values issue, not a religious one.|`|wYdHeAE9aa	marriage is a religious concept, a union for procreation and family union.<br>  <br>  as for the state and marriage it is used for proper taxation. single and married persons are taxed differently. <br>  <br>  of course because the state has interest it does have the right to perform marriage. <br>  <br>  if state allows same sex marriage, it is not suppose to influence religions view of it, because church and state politically is seperate.|`|auUeI2Vnaa	Look up the word "marriage" in the dictionary.  It say's it's a term for religious ceremonies.  Any religion, not just Christian.<br>  <br>  In my opinion, the government should refer to any legally binded couple as a "civil union" and religious people can call each other married.  Anyone who disagree's obviously doesn't really think church and state should be separated.<br>  <br>  edit.  You are right.  Marriage should not be about legal contracts and benefits.  Marriage is something that should recognized by God, not the law.  This is why, to truely separate church and state, no legally binded couple should be called "married".|`|AA11008046	The judges of our time have usurped the Churches authority in doing so.  Originally it was  the duty of the local pastor to sit the parties down; discuss the obligations of each to the other; investigate and determine no known reason why the two should not marry and then perform the service.  Counselling was also done at the church.  Of course if you live your married life as per Biblical truths there isn`t such as  divorce.|`|WalnRzfGaa	Ummm what about the fact that marriage was around long before christianity?|`|UinOWcMUaa	Yep you are right -- but we all know that marriage doesn't belong to Christanity, Islam, Budda, or anything else. I'm Christian but... it doesn't belong to my church or anyone's church !! <br>  <br>  I will support your statment -- Christanity has nothing to do with my beliefs.. But, it's just God created the institution not my church. Marriage was defined by God for humans, to exist between 1 man and 1 woman.. I think people should LOVE who they want, but don't call it marriage. It's like being a Christian -- Atheist (no objections)<br>  <br>  Yes, marriage was along longer than Christianity be it started with God and will end with God !|`|ZmdIlkpQaa	You're certainly correct about that.  History, too, shows that marriage exists outside of the bounds of the Christian churches.  Do non-Christians in China or Japan not get married?  Of course they do.  My informal studies of marriages in the State of Washington, here in the US of A suggest that between 1/4 and 1/3 of all marriages from 1881 to present have been civil affairs presided over by a Justice of the Peace rather than religious affairs.  The fact that you have to have a license issued by County government before you can have a legally recognized marriage, whether performed by a religious officiant or not, is also highly suggestive of the fact you point to.|`|QVKWVValaa	Yes.<br>  And the larger fact is that even if you are married by a priest, or whatever church head handles things for your faith, that church head is only acting as a servant of the state and making sure you sign the marriage license that was issued, and will be certified and stored, by the state. Just try getting married without filing that document.|`|1d627596e14caafeacfad98d799d9a7caa	Oh for Pete's sake. <br>  <br>  If you take religious vows before God with a Minister present it's a religious ceremony. <br>  <br>  If you take non-religious vows before a Justice of the Peace, it's a civic ordinance.<br>  <br>  I think you're opinion of "so many people" is completely prejudiced AND wrong.|`|96cd1744acaf1e87751ac1ec9c729b19aa	Remember dear, the legal part of the marriage is the license, any hocus pocus you add, whether religious or Elvis is optional.|`|64d4893f2b5ad37e1908f80ec7b0c4c2aa	Marriage is not a legal binding contract without a state issued license.  So much for religion.|`|gDVQNMR7aa	Righto.|`|FIXKYCIGaa	In some states you don't even need a judge.  A notary public can do it.|`|89MKzLl3aa	You can get married in BFE and it will still be binding.|`|qMCHLrKCaa	The law regards marriage as a civil contractual relationship in which the state has a particular interest, because children often are involved eventually.  Because of the state's special interest, dissolving a marriage is often more complicated than dissolving a commercial contract.  Contracts normally involve an exchange of promises that bind the parties involved.<br>  <br>  The Church, historically, has looked at marriage as a sacrament.  A sacrament is a relationship between a person or, in the case of marriage two people, and G-d.  Sacraments are not contracts but the "outward and visible signs of an inward and spiritual grace."  They reflect a totally different ontology than contracts in law.  While the Church may have an obligation to accept the fact that a couple has a legal relationship enforced by the state, it is under no obligation to accept that that same couple has a sacramental relationship, over which the state has no control.<br>  <br>  Marriage as contract and marriage as sacrament are two totally different things.<br>  <br>  Grace be unto and peace.|`|UKPQN0UKaa	Gays are just the newest ones to pick on, I guess.<br>  <br>  Used to be they picked on married couples who used birth control or got divorced.

Now that those things are more widely accepted, there has to be some "sinners" to point the finger at.<br>  <br>  I can't wait for it to stop.|`|Io9288c7aa	You are right. Marriage does not belong to Christianity, it belongs to God. And as such was instituted originally to Adam and Eve by God and intended for a man & a women, Not man & man or women & women.|`|MTuUZBzIaa	And, what about all the different forms of marriage, polyandry and polygamy just to name two|`|FarsCSY1aa	People have been getting married since Christianity was even an idea.|`|CCa9kRHHaa	Yes, that and people of any religion can get married.

It tells in the end of times, there will be people like you, who fall under the name of the anti christ.  I am not saying you are, but your beliefs are the same.           No I would not read your book.    The Holy Bible is the truth.    You need to read the New Testement.    and also go to speak to a Scholar in Religion.    They can help you understand and to realize that the Holy Bible is from God.       All of us, have a Holy Spirit within our bodies.   Why do you suppose your wisdom tells you right from wrong??       If you write the lucifer book, it will allow you to not recognize right from wrong.  People will go and do all sorts of horrible sins.     You will work against anything that is good.  Your favorite word will be hate and kill.  Just the Opposite of knowing God and reading the Holy Bible.      Lucifer is the Opposite of God.   People who know and believe in God, are good.  They work hard to walk the straight and narrow Path.  They depend on their Holy Spirit. <br>      You who want to teach about lucifer is just the Opposite.  You will be the anti christ.    Don't do that.    You need to go the other way, towards God the Father Almighty.    Maker of Heaven and Earth.    <br>     Not the Destroyer, like lucifer.   Don't go down the wide path .

NvGqiA4vaa	If she fell out of her dress, it means that certain parts of her body were spilling out/coming out of it -- usually the breasts. If Jack Black fell into it, he, um, how do you say it.. went inside her dress? Haha. Not literally of course, as in being dressed in it, but imagine the dress was held open by someone, there would create a space where a person could 'fall into' it. In the sentence you gave, though, I think they're implying that Jack Black liked the fact that she was revealing herself and as a consequence he got a little too close to her and so it seemed that he was 'falling inside' her dress. Does that make sense? Sorry now that I'm typing it out it's actually kind of difficult to explain...|`|mUK240ykaa	"fell out of her dress" : her nipples were showing, she had a "wardrobe malfunction" (cf.

If she does not please the man who bought her, he may allow her to be bought back again.  But he is not allowed to sell her to foreigners, since he is the one who broke the contract with her.  And if the slave girl's owner arranges for her to marry his son, he may no longer treat her as a slave girl, but he must treat her as his daughter.  If he himself marries her and then takes another wife, he may not reduce her food or clothing or fail to sleep with her as his wife.  If he fails in any of these three ways, she may leave as a free woman without making any payment".   (Exodus 21:7-11 NLT)

The second war, The War for Souls, is being fought right now and will end with the rise and fall of the Anti-Christ and his everlasting imprisonment in Hell with all of the other devils and evil spirits in Revelation 20:11-15. <br>  <br>  He is destined to hell because he worked hard for it.

oyvLCy5Caa	Have you ever thought that maybe God was blessing you by removing her from your life?  She obviously is not someone you would want to marry if she was unfaithful.  Someone who attaches God, God bless you or Jesus to their actions does not make them a Christan.  A true Christian does not lie, betray and deceive people.  So you have to apply that to this situation.  Many lost, wicked people are happy in their sins.  The bible tells us that sin is pleasurable for a season (Hebrews 11:25).  But in the end all will be judged and will be held accountable for their sins.  She will not get away with anything, unless the Lord truly saves her.  And if he does she would apologize for her behavior towards you.  Christians make restitution because their lives are radically changed.  And no sin can keep us from the grace and forgiveness of God, if he chooses to save us.  I know you are hurt right now but be glad you weren't married for 10 years before you found out about this woman's unfaithfulness when there would have been children involved and much more heartache.  Ask the Lord to reveal himself to you if you do not truly know him as your Savior and Lord.  Repent of your sins and cry unto him for salvation.|`|FeUmyxqqaa	brilliant: I find that funny considering she had to lie, deceive and cheat on me to get it.<br>  <br>  maybe she had a bath with a priest and now shes been reborn free of sin and you|`|CEQpDpnPaa	ever heard of David and Bathsheba?|`|JREs9K0Gaa	She may seem happy now.

This is the hope that we have in Jesus!~ he cares for us and loves us.. For me, I am going thru financial crisis~ I began to compare my life to other sometimes..but God loves us just as we are....

I am trying to learn Italian after already knowing Spanish, so the only problem is that I sometimes confuse the two languages.  <br>  <br>  You should decide on what use of language is more important to you.

Or do you want to learn a language that you show more interest in and perhaps move to Italy to pursue a business career.

Vietnam was something that happened at a moment of warfare and the poor decision of a division leader! Not an order by the president! Japanese concentration camps were not made to antagonize the Japanese (Even though it was demoralizing and crass) it was for their safety from civilians who developed extreme hatred over what their countrymen did to Americans by surprise! The trail of tears was probably one of the most horrific points in American history and remember the times were very different and because the "White Man" wanted to migrate, they were being stopped as best as they could by Native Americans who could not stop the better armed "White Men!"  Slavery cam as the settlers did and as wrong as it was and as awful as it was, it was again, a different era where (as much as this sounds bad) it was accepted!

I mean, justifications besides being batshit crazy like Hitler.<br>  although it is difficult to think about slavery and racism:  was racism the motivation for slavery--it suddenly appeared in the same form it was in the 1940s-60s and today?  or did racism get built up and strengthened because of slavery?  it's complicated.<br>  <br>  anyway i think that history should be objective and we shouldn't say that this was wrong or right.  we should just know why it happened and how it happened and what it caused.  history is a soulless subject.
6beL9zycaa	There are as many reasons for homophobia as there are people who hold those beliefs.  Many boys/men (& girls/women as well, but it doesn't seem to be as prevalent with them~ the female gender has always been more accepting of & open minded when it comes to most social issues) but many people are very insecure about their own sexuality, so they beat their chests & proclaim to be macho to leave no doubt in everyone ELSE'S minds.  Also, you have the religious zealots & radical right wing nuts who have been brain-washed all of their lives & don't have the intelligence or incentive to think for themselves & question anything they've been taught.  It takes some backbone to question authority, especially religious leaders that you've been brought up to revere, respect, &/or fear all of your life. Unfortunately there are not many people that have that kind of courage & prefer to take the easier road~ the one that requires the least amount of thought, effort, & character.  Look at any far right-wing politician to see what I'm talking about.  When everyone starts thinking for themselves & questioning the teachings that originated when people still thought you could sail off of the ends of the Earth, the human race will begin to develop real compassion & understanding as a people.  Until then, we all have to deal with the ignorance of bigotry, hypocrisy, & stupidity.  Remember, the most cruel & inhumane acts against others have been committed in the name of religion.  I'm not gay... but have friends who are, & easily could have been~ science has proven that it is a biological phenomenon, not a "choice."  Who in their right mind would "choose" to live a life of being persecuted, beaten, tortured, murdered, & discriminated against?|`|RSv2E2KNaa	They are narrow-minded.

They didn’t embellish us with any interesting affairs. The people examining had embraced the hypothesis of the showdown and the case had soon disappeared from the news. But, by chance, I read the name of the woman who had signed almost all the pieces of the most important local newspaper and it suddenly put me in a good mood. Maybe I had found someone who could help us. <br>  Paola Narduzzi, before becoming a journalist and moving to Verona, had been the wife of a drummer from Padua who played in a jazz group. She followed him from club to club and, when she got bored, which was often enough, (she) killed time drinking a gin fizz, one after the other. When I met her, she was drunk, and she was also drunk the last time I saw her. <br>  I called the newspaper. The usual ill-tempered operator informed me that Mrs Narduzzi went out to do a report, but before evening she would return. We parked our car nearby editing, in a place where we had a view which allowed us to oversee the main door of the palace. <br>  “It’s her,” I told my colleague, when I saw her enter. We let her have time to make herself comfortable on the writing desk and after we turned up in the porter’s lodge.<br>  “Marco Buratti, alias the alligator!” she exclaimed surprised. “How many years have passed… well, better not count them,” she added giggling. <br>  She then showed a very serious face. “I've stopped drinking,” she declared solemnly, “(I) now only drink when I’m depressed.”<br>  “A healthy life will do the job these days,” I commented conversationally.|`|SDhKNBBkaa	It's understandable but not colloquial English.

obHa7Stuaa	Yes.|`|Kxwyy0Eaaa	Personally, I think that all fast food supports factory farming and that factory farming is not Christian. That is why I became vegan. Ironically, I do own six to eight shares of Wendy's. These were bought years ago before I was a conscientious eater and consumer. I also own Tim Horton's stock, which I got when they split from Wendy's. (I get dividend checks from TH's, nothing more than a couple of dollars, but enough to treat myself at TH's for "free" and give them their money back.) <br>  <br>  If you're worried about supporting the religious right, don't eat there. Your heart might thank you.<br>  <br>  I agree with cooking yourself and even supporting the local economy by buying your food from local suppliers. Heck, even going to the chain grocery store you can buy real food for much cheaper. (I can  have a veggie burger on two slices of whole wheat bread for less than a fast "food" burger.)<br>  <br>  If you are looking for a good read, try "Fast Food Nation" and "The Ethics of What We Eat Why Our Food Choices Matter".

That is a sacrifice so that people can eat meat.  A 'sacrifice' does not just mean sacrificing for a spiritual or personal belief.<br>  <br>  So to eat meat, especially avidly, and to say animal sacrifices are wrong is a complete double standard, I'm sorry.|`|TjwgBFCzaa	to me it is<br>  <br>  "Harm none"|`|7mhRDbvsaa	they shouldn't even be thought about...cuz its not normal<br>  <br>  like why would i eat alive fire ants or get whipped by horns just to show that i'm a man|`|iybezfi6aa	What's with the "theory behind the question" bit?

C7o9XMaZaa	Actually, there are 4 Archangels, AND LUCIFER WAS NEVER ONE!!!! There names are Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, and Uriel.|`|bTh3NNpSaa	look for doreen virtue books she has some good insight into these things. I believe in them and Michael ain't the only one there are a couple others|`|zlJwyg8Raa	Michael and gabriel are the only archangels.  Lucifer used to be the archangel of light until he fell. The cool thing about being human not an angel is , God will help us back up if we fall. :D|`|MHMndoCcaa	Just Michael And Gabriel|`|vgpuTBmSaa	Gabriel is an archangel he stands guarding the gate to the garden of eden<br>  there are more but i'm not sure of their names
zlJwyg8Raa	Yes, they are.  When Lucifer, the main archangel(of light) fell, so did one third of the angels. They are now demons. No, demons do not live in hell they will go there when the world ends, because they fell from God.   as far as i know, they aren't red-skinned or have horns, they just look like normal angels.|`|919XflnDaa	This is a religious question. And yes. The christian god banished all rouges angels, thus creating fallen angels. Where people got the red skinned demon thing, I've no clue. But essentially the demons of "hell" are fallen angels. A demon is a manifestation of hatred formed through a human soul. A type of corruption.|`|vgpuTBmSaa	not in my opinion. demons are the worst parts of the human psyche brought into existence by the guilt and fear they breed|`|e9Q51Oxyaa	If I'm not mistaken, In Christianity, I believe so. <br>  In Spiritual Satanism, of course not.

Now since angels are spirits like God, Well they too have the ability to appear to mankind in a multitude of forms..

So I don't think that you should start trying to change angels to look like  something that you can relate to...... And since angels only appear to mankind in a form that they can relate to... I would not dare to presume that this  is what class they belong to......................|`|zlJwyg8Raa	try to be patient...Doom Shepherd is quite right, although the main cater gories are cherubim, seraphim, and archangels... they are all very intimidating- when a brave person starts to cower, you know they are scary...<br>  <br>  Seraphim: have two sets of eyes and two sets of feet. have 4 wings to cover them all<br>  Cherubim: have two eyes and just 2 feet.  also have wings <br>  <br>  umm for arch angels, they are the head angels, not too sur what they look like....|`|kIEZ2HOgaa	yes. verrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrry much so. you ask alot of questions about angels

2567c53ea5be1f53420408d56fd5f4b4aa	I've always said, if you can offer me solid, incontrovertible evidence that god exists, you'd have to pry my butt out of church. <br>  <br>  Still waiting.|`|495e344229dc3bcc5dcbf3cd52fed97eaa	Certainly. Extraordinary claims demand extraordinary proof, but I would accept even ordinary proof of the existence of God. So far, there isn't any. If there were, I would believe in God, just like if you produced proof of the existence of leprechauns i would believe in them.<br>  <br>  That doesn't mean that I would worship God, necessarily. But I would acknowledge God's existence. <br>  <br>  Do you have any? I'm guessing not.|`|AA12203324	If course an empirical atheist will be convinced by proof.  The problem is with validating such "proof".  Very likely, "proof" would require a redefinition of what "God" is since, as currently described, such a being cannot logically exist.|`|5tMCDu8gaa	Yup. If I had real, concrete evidence for a god, I would stop being an atheist.<br>  <br>  But somehow, I very much doubt the likelihood of that happening.|`|eZbkg3BWaa	If there was evidence that any deity existed, I would most definitely acknowledge that, yes.|`|AAglvbfbaa	If it was proven without a doubt then obviously I would have to believe it, but until then I will continue the way I am.|`|NWnOTkwCaa	Jesus said that if they will not listen to Moses and the prophets, even a person rising from the dead will not change them.|`|Kg5KX432aa	if there was scientific evidence of god, then yes, I would follow the evidence.|`|k4EtI2Avaa	Ohh..that was the answer to one of my questions. Hmm. Is there any true way to prove that God exists or doesn't exist?<br>  <br>  I think there's proof on both sides.<br>  Like people that have seen demons/angels (call it mental illness all you want but it could be perfectly normal people that see these things, and more than one person) and miracles taking place, such as healing. I've known of such things occuring.<br>  <br>  The again there's scientific proof against a lot of things in the bible..but you said hard evidence that GOD existed not that the bible is true, so that depends..which God are you talking about?|`|uK3tkaOJaa	If I had proof of a god, I'd believe in a god.

I would not accept the Bible still as I do not agree with many of the teachings though.|`|E0uRBwWtaa	Well that Atheist answer is a smart one.

And so I am doomed to an eternity of torment.|`|WalnRzfGaa	If there was hard evidence then we would have to accept that there is a God. The reason we don't is because there IS NO such evidence.|`|g7uMKvEzaa	I guess they werent't blessed with believing...I am glad I am. I am sure God will find a way to let everyone know him somehow,sometime. I hope it will be sooner than later.|`|ZDDya5Ibaa	of course. I accept the facts.

Teachings of<br>  all holy books are same. All religions are for Benefit of Mankind, betterment of humanity and to create atmosphere of peace and love. But illiterate people from all religions are active in twisting there real holy teachings, either to satisfy there own emotions or to serve their personal agendas. Mullah of Muslims, Priest of Christians, and Rabbi of Jews are playing same role.<br>  <br>  As for Muslims are concerned, because of many interpretations of Islam, promoted by various semi-literate Mullah, Ulema, Imams and leaders, Islam has become an excuse for committing acts that have nothing to do with its spirit. The Islam that the West sees today is not the one that was intended for the whole world; a religion offering a message of love, peace, tolerance, equality and compassion to all without distinction.<br>  <br>  But that is not all. The entire problem is further complicated within Islam itself. Like other leading religions, there are countless sects, opinions, beliefs within the overall religious parameters of Islam. It's not just a question of Sunni Islam and Shia Islam and how they interpret the Shariah. There are at least 70 sects within these two main offshoots whose interpretation of Shariah differs with each other. Aren't we witness to leaders of one sect declaring the murder of the followers of another sect as not only religiously legal but also divinely rewarding?<br>  <br>  To compound the problem, the qualifications of the interpreters too have been routinely challenged by the progressive mind set over the years. It has been observed that the interpreters "were neither educated nor developed enough to understand Islam and the contemporary issues of the modern world and have narrow view of the religion." And that "they belong to a particular school of thought and sect as they are trained in orthodox and outdated system."<br>  <br>  With that said, let us now precede to another fundamental question...How to define a Muslim? The Munir Inquiry Commission, when appointed to investigate into the reasons of the anti-Qadiani riots<br>  in Lahore in 1953, tried to tackle the issue. No less than twenty-two leading lights on Islam were invited to define a Muslim. Ironically, no two given definitions coincided with each other.<br>  <br>  It is necessary to get aware about the subject or object which any<br>  person wants to comment or criticize. But now days it became a<br>  fashion to explain or condemn the Islam with out comprehending the<br>  Quran that is a foundation and the Holy book of Islam.<br>  <br>  Being Islam as a holy religion for mankind, there is neither any<br>  check upon the behavior nor any control upon the conduct of those<br>  people, they declare themselves Muslims with out knowing the actual<br>  sprit and wisdom regarding commands of God those were transmitted to prophet (P.B.U.H) and present in Quran<br>  <br>  Here some verses of QURAN are pasted for brainstorming; these are a<br>  few vital instructions, imperative information's and essential guidance of ALLAH for mankind.<br>  <br>  Mankind was one single nation, and Allah sent Messengers with glad<br>  tidings and warnings; and with them He sent the Book in truth, to judge between people in matters wherein they differed; but the People<br>  of the Book, after the clear Signs came to them, did not differ among<br>  themselves, except through selfish contumacy. Allah by His Grace<br>  Guided the believers to the Truth, concerning that wherein they differed. For Allah guided whom He will to a path that is straight. [2:213]<br>  <br>  The Religion before Allah is ISLAM (submission to His Will): Nor did<br>  the People of the Book dissent therefrom except through envy of each<br>  other, after knowledge had come to them. But if any deny the Signs of<br>  Allah, Allah is swift in calling to account. [3:19]<br>  <br>  The same religion has He established for you as that which He<br>  enjoined on Noah - the which We have sent by inspiration to thee -<br>  and that which We enjoined on Abraham, Moses, and Jesus: Namely, that ye should remain steadfast in religion, and make no divisions<br>  therein: to those who worship other things than Allah, hard is the<br>  (way) to which thou callest them. Allah chooses to Himself those whom He pleases, and guides to Himself those who turn (to Him). [42:13]<br>  <br>  To thee We sent the Scripture in truth, confirming the scripture that<br>  came before it, and guarding it in safety: so judge between them by<br>  what Allah hath revealed, and follow not their vain desires, diverging from the Truth that hath come to thee. To each among you have we prescribed a law and an open way. If Allah had so willed, He would have made you a single people, but (His plan is) to test you in what He hath given you: so strive as in a race in all virtues.

Basically, we just hang out and chat and talk about things that have been bothering us. We're starting to become more activist-like because we're trying to put together a presentation to present to the students why using the phrase "that's so gay" is wrong. So, yeah.. but if you're in it you totally don't have to tell anyone and it's anonymous and people don't find out that easily. =]|`|zF6zkFfbaa	There is a Straight-Gay Alliance (SGA) club in my school which apparently fought for the right to exist however for the 3 sessions I went to they were mainly about how to fundraise and club shirts and not really much about the issues, perhaps that was later on.|`|IrWWmTQKaa	I live in the UK... there isn't much LGBT clubs around here...

When you hit someone, the pain sends a signal to the brain indicating which part of our body is in a bad shape so that we care about it. It is mainly nerve cells which send signals to the brain, so if someday one happens to have no nerve cells, he will not be in pain at all, however you want to hit/slap him. Take for example your dentist, when you have to get a tooth extracted he will use anesthesics so that you have no pain. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthetics" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthetics</a><br>  <br>  I am not trying to be rude but just want to clarify certain things which us human being who don't have explanation for certain things just try to associate it with hmmm...well you know what I mean!<br>  <br>  Speaking the truth and my opinion which might be bias or as real as any story out there. <br>  <br>  PEACE ;)|`|dOXUYv0Xaa	A wonderful teaching!<br>  Thank you for sharing!<br>  <br>  This story sheds a great deal of light, regarding the Zen question:<br>  "What is the sound of one hand clapping?"<br>  <br>  al-hamdu lillah<br>  Salaams,|`|7dGpL4mSaa	That is very interesting!

dc00e6f724cc094e75dc0475843d0e44aa	The clip was a perfect example of why the Christian attitude of "do unto others as you would have them do unto you" is needed in the world.

T2JBX5Ataa	Sloppy as An American Born Muslim I find that offensive, as I certainly do not hate America, many Muslims dislike america, and really who can blame them, what with America invading, plundering, sacking, and generally terrorizing many Muslim countries, if I was from one of them I would be a little peeved as well. <br>  <br>  As for the question at hand, Well dating anyone, muslim or not is Haraam a big no no for Males and Females in Islam so she Isn't that traditional,  Well those are not just muslim values that's chilvery, and now you know she wants a knight in shining armor lol. Although it is traditional Islamic values for you to pay for everything hehe , she might be trying to get you to marry her I doubt it though, she probably is just spoiled. Probably daddy's little girl always gets her way good luck. Oh and if she says it again ask her why she's dating in the first place if she cares so much about Islamic values.|`|FyEAm3niaa	Muslims are scum and there is nothing like a dead muslim.

Why because parents lay down rules which say you cannot sleep with every boy in school because you can get pregnant and have a child they have to raise.<br>  If you would leave and never come back then they would want that, but trouble is you get pregnant and find out  you have no where to live and want to come home again with a kid or two for them to raise.<br>  Boys do stupid things like drunk driving and joining the military at 17 1/2 and away they go and get in some foreign country and find out it is not that much fun shooting at people when they shoot back.<br>  But girls just want to date boys and sleep with them and do not want the parents to put any restrictions on them.<br>  <br>  I agree with Louis, get a job, get your own place to live and move out.

The way they may stand tall and proud.  Full lips.  Very thin lips.  All shades of hair--especially if it doesn't look dyed.  People with very wide bone structure and very narrow.  One of my personal favorite things that I see as very beautiful are laugh lines around someone's eyes.  I don't know why--I just think they're beautiful because it took a lifetime of laughing to get them.

I've been healthy all year, as well as this winter. I haven't had a cold nor have I had the flu in years. (got a flu shot again in the fall) I have had a lot of Sinusitis problems, that I'm seeing a doctor for. Like you, I am a strong believer of hand washing all the time but especially during the cold & flu season.|`|2R3iJnFPaa	No in between here.

Poppy|`|XEbrGfZuaa	My husband and I both, have had a strange cold/flu that has already<br>  lasted a month. Just when we've thought we were over it, we take a<br>  few steps backward in our recovery to get it more entrenched again.<br>  This is a bug that starts out like an allergy problem. A bit of a sore<br>  throat from drainage, and then a heaviness in the chest, and then the<br>  nose starts doing its' thing ever few minutes. I have used up almost<br>  two boxes of kleenex in a couple of weeks already. Antihystamines<br>  don't touch it. So it can't be dried up. I have increased my tea and<br>  other liquids due to being thirsty much of the time. This is a bug where<br>  you get depleted of energy fast.  And progression is slow. Things <br>  have kicked in to repeat the stomach upsets now, as well as the<br>  nasal and respiratory symptoms. All that can be done, is to use<br>  nasal sprays, and take Tylenol a couple times a day to help relieve<br>  the severity of the symptoms. Since we are very tired, taking a nap<br>  if we can, helps to re generate us. But we both feel we can't get<br>  enough rest. We wake up so tired, it's hard to pull ourselves up<br>  and out. Rest and plenty of liquids seem to be the way to wade<br>  through this. And try to avoid spreading it to others. It's running<br>  rampant in our area and I hear it's highly transferable. I had a flu<br>  shot, but it never seems to matter. I sure wish we could finally<br>  get rid of it, instead of it making us stay sick.|`|ozwLZwXeaa	I had my Doctor give me my flue shot and pneumonia shot early this year. I have not been really sick but have felt tired out real bad a few times this winter so far but not sick.  The flu shot is worth your time and doesn't cost that much.

Very tasty grilled too!|`|VQNHDTeQaa	I really can't add anything except to wish you all the best. Red is very good for cooking but you each have your own taste to satisfy I guess.

They are on the sweet side & very tasty. Once in a while, I'll use the red/purple onions in a few cold dishes for color, but I prefer the Vidalia onion most of the time.<br>  <br>  edit: Red onion in a meatloaf would taste just fine.|`|Z9Ioz2JMaa	I prefer using the yellow/brown onions for cooking and saving the red onions for salads.  I personally do not care for cooked red onion. The green onions and white ones I use for both cooking and salads.  I have made meatloaf with white onion and I think it tastes better that way. I have never put green onions in my meatloaf, but I think that would taste good, too.  mmm... I think I will try that the next time I make meatloaf.  I will sprinkle green onion over my enchiladas the last 5 minutes of baking. I put green onion in my potato salad and in my coleslaw.  And I add both red onion and green onion to my bean salad.  This is making me hungry now.|`|ozwLZwXeaa	When I did the cooking I liked to buy the big sweet yellow onions. The big bag costs under 4 dollars now and one bag of the white onions with only 9 onions costs almost two dollars. I like the red onions for salads.

ZmdIlkpQaa	First, in all honesty, I never give out spells.  Spells are intimate, and are very personalized and custom tailored for me and my specific faith.  They're not cut and paste creations, nor are the a recipe for pancakes.  <br>  <br>  If you really want to cast effective spells, you need to learn how to do them (and create them) yourself.  There are ample books and sources for this.  I would no more give an under-educated and unprepared person a spell I'd created than I would give a child a loaded handgun.  There's a reason why surgeons have to undergo so much schooling and internship.    <br>  <br>  I suggest studying and deciding which of the many systems of energy manipulation makes the most sense to you, and then study it until you understand well enough to cast your own spells.  I wish you the very best.|`|SDDgbtQ4aa	Agreed with Chances and Devo.  If you want to learn how to cast spells, then start at the beginning by learning meditation and magical techniques.  Like any other set of skills one sets out to learn, it's going to take some time.<br>  <br>  I would recommend these books for beginners:<br>  <br>  "The Inner Temple of Witchcraft" by Chrisotpher Penczak<br>  "Before You Cast a Spell: Understanding the Power of Magic" by Carl McColman|`|175061f78daa0acce0c1ddee4462560caa	well good spells depend on what you are looking for.<br>  you don't need an old spell or an "official" spell. just say what you want, preferably in rhyme.<br>  get candles the color that matches your goal. (look up what different colors mean)<br>  and visualize the outcome you want.<br>  <br>  but its really a lot more complicated then that and it won't work if you do it rushed and without knowledge of magick.<br>  <br>  and to HAROLD -- that book states on the front page, do not practice these spells.|`|dFBccLExaa	Your question is a little too open ended. There are spells for literally thousands of things, so it just list off random spells seems a little, well, random. <br>  The best spells (just for your general knowledge) are best made by the practitioner, or by the person who wants the desired change. Your best bet would be to learn how magick works, and then create a spell that suits your needs.|`|vgpuTBmSaa	now listen to me please. the exact ritual or chant or ceremony does not matter as much as intention...but be sure of what you want. these things ha ve a way of manifesting differently than you would expect. all you have to do is personalize somekind of short rhyme or make up your own symbols<br>  <br>  you should perhaps think about getting a deck of tarot cards i recommend the dragon decks and the cosmic tarot. the voodoo tarot is always very accurate but it also rather scares me...just because i don't understand the whole genre, though|`|v14DyoP5aa	You don't get spells from other people, you make them yourself, based on your unique situation. search a simple spell that asks for an everyday solution to an everyday problem, then take it from there.

I know it seems like a lot of work, but it is worth it in the end.|`|twP8eJVWaa	whell i do believe in magic and fairies and everything but when it comes to spells im not very resourceful. but try this site-- it helps! www.nowspells.com   ok there are love spells, curse spells, money spells and much more! hope this helps!|`|vUFICF6oaa	Well, Here is a spell I use every full moon<br>  <br>  <br>  Ok, Go outside during a full moon.

Without the focus to concentrate, bring energy up, shape it and let it go, the words are useless.<br>  <br>  The best spells are the ones you write yourself, since they'd be designed by you for what's needed, but it's like painting--you can throw paint at a canvas or use your tools to create a masterpiece.  Since I don't know what level you're at, just handing you ';paint' will do very little.
SqLIZQN5aa	I've recently been browsing around in Religion and Spirituality...and I can say I am appalled. There are atheists bashing religion and vice versa. What is the point of saying "religion is made up", or "why do people waste their time on a fake idea?"

3BHPJweWaa	Genesis 4:26 --<br>  <br>  "A son was also born to Seth, and he named him Enosh. At that time people began to worship the LORD."<br>  <br>  [Google search on: Genesis, translations, worship]<br>  <br>  [Then, sticking in: Genesis 4:26, worship --]<br>  <br>  Many Biblical scholars point to Genesis 4 as the first instance<br>  of worship. In Genesis 4:26 we are told, Seth also had a son, and he named him Enosh. At that time men began to call on the name of the LORD. It was very early in the history of people that<br>  they specifically worshiped, or called to God, seemingly together. <br>  <br>  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br>  <br>  INTERESTING!  i had never realized that.  There is no record -- in Genesis -- of God ever commanding either Adam or Eve to worship him!<br>  <br>  i didn't find anything in "The Apocryphon of John" or "The Hypostasis of the Archons" or "On the Origin of the World" that would indicate such, either.<br>  <br>  However, in "The Book of Adam & Eve" it is claimed that Satan & his angels were commanded to worship *Adam*!<br>  <br>  *<br>  <br>   xiii 1 The devil replied, 'Adam, what dost thou tell me? It is for thy sake that I have been hurled<br>  <br>  2 from that place. When thou wast formed. I was hurled out of the presence of God and banished from the company of the angels. When God blew into thee the breath of life and thy face and likeness was made in the image of God, Michael also brought thee and made (us) worship thee in the sight of God; and God the Lord spake: Here is Adam. I have made thee in our image and likeness.'<br>  <br>  xiv 1 And Michael went out and called all the angels saying:<br>  <br>  'Worship the image of God as the Lord God hath commanded.'<br>  <br>  And Michael himself worshipped first; then he called me and said: 'Worship the image of God<br>  <br>  3 the Lord.' And I answered, 'I have no (need) to worship Adam.' And since Michael kept urging me to worship, I said to him, 'Why dost thou urge me? I will not worship an inferior and younger being (than I). I am his senior in the Creation, before he was made was I already made. It is his duty to worship me.'<br>  <br>  xv 1,2 When the angels, who were under me, heard this, they refused to worship him. And Michael saith, 'Worship the image of God, but if thou wilt not worship him, the Lord God will be wrath<br>  <br>  3 with thee.' And I said, 'If He be wrath with me, I will set my seat above the stars of heaven and will be like the Highest.'<br>  <br>  xvi 1 And God the Lord was wrath with me and banished me and my angels from our glory; and on<br>  <br>  2 thy account were we expelled from our abodes into this world and hurled on the earth. And<br>  <br>  3 straightway we were overcome with grief, since we had been spoiled of so great glory. And we<br>  <br>  4 were grieved when we saw thee in such joy and luxury. And with guile I cheated thy wife and caused thee to be expelled through her (doing) from thy joy and luxury, as I have been driven out of my glory.<br>  <br>  <br>  www.pseudepigrapha.com/pseudepigrapha/...<br>  <br>  ***<br>  <br>  According to "The Origin of the World" it appears that -- to that perspective -- worship was begotten by what were really deceptive & fallen entities (the Rulers/ archons, who would *be* the "Elohim" of Genesis -- Elohim being the Jewish/Christian/ Islamic "God" -- Yhwh/Allah):<br>  <br>  *<br>  <br>  "Let us return to the aforementioned rulers, so that we may offer some explanation of them. Now, when the seven rulers were cast down from their heavens onto the earth, they made for themselves angels, numerous, demonic, to serve them. And the latter instructed mankind in many kinds of error and magic and potions and worship of idols and spilling of blood and altars and temples and sacrifices and libations to all the spirits of the earth, having their coworker fate, who came into existence by the concord between the gods of injustice and justice.<br>  <br>  "And thus when the world had come into being, it distractedly erred at all times. For all men upon earth worshiped the spirits (demons) from the creation to the consummation - both the angels of righteousness and the men of unrighteousness. Thus did the world come to exist in distraction, in ignorance, and in a stupor. They all erred, until the appearance of the true man."<br>  <br>  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br>  <br>  i seriously doubt that the Ultimate Divine *ever* genuinely asked for or required worship.<br>  <br>  i'd say that worship was created by *men*.<br>  <br>  It was probably motivated out of fear, appeasement, seeking something from what were perceived as being higher spiritual powers.<br>  <br>  Worship may have preceded the priestcraft, who have obviously made extensive use of it to advance their own welfare & power-over/ control of others.<br>  <br>  Worship *does* function soas to reinforce *humility* -- & genuine humility (as opposed to arrogance/ hubris) is, to my view, good.<br>  <br>  However, i have frequently suspected that pretty much *all* worship is a form of idolatry -- which includes monotheistic worship. ;)<br>  <br>  i would say that the requirement to "believe in" God's existence is a *human*-created doctrine.|`|l7KNCARGaa	Sex might have made you, hon, but it didn't make me.

Enjoy your life!|`|e0lfV7skaa	Of course it doesn't make you gay.

Ok so they can make you a bit jumpy when you sense/see them without being prepared but that's about it. I have often had experiences in my home, out and about, when visiting friends etc. In fact they are sometimes so solid and lifelike looking that you don't always realise what it is that you are seeing until you either see it disappear or realise it has disappeared under circumstances that makes it physically impossible to do so. Our latest spirit visitor has been that of a cat. We have never owned a cat but we have one which follows you from room to room meowing at your feet when you stand still as if it wants attention or food or something. At least it costs nothing to keep and we don't have to pay vets fees for it - Lol<br>  I hope this helps with your question|`|BhzCW1rYaa	What we call ghosts reside in the 4th dimension, which is the spirit world and we can't see into that world unless there is a portal or the veil between worlds is thin..<br>  All dimensions have a different vibration, we are surrounded by dimensions we cannot see, but sometimes we do get a glimpse into their world and sometimes they get a glimpse into our world; also remember our dimension is the only dimension where time is measured...<br>  <br>  I recently read about a ghost scream which was recorded in England; a team of paranormal researchers were conducting an investigation into a haunting and 3 or 4 women were together in a room when they were taken by surprise by the appearance of a ghost, so they screamed...<br>  The Ghost also must have been taken by surprise as it also screamed, which was recorded on their equipment..<br>  They had the recording analysed and the result was that the scream was not of human origin; so you see we can spook the spooks just like they spook us...<br>  <br>  About 1 km up the road from me is an old manse called St Cecilia, this is in Peterborough, Sth Aust...<br>  This old manse hosts 5 ghosts, and the most prominent is the ghost of one of the old Bishops who lived there in the 1870's..<br>  A friend of mine is a psychic medium and he has been on a couple of documentaries which concern haunted places in Australia, and he has been filmed there several times...<br>  I walk past St Cecilia's 4 times a week, mostly at around the 9ish PM mark, but sometimes much later on my fitness walk..<br>  I have personally seen the Bishop 3 times, up on the porch on the far left hand side of the the building...<br>  Every time I walk past the manse all the hairs stick up on the back of my neck and I have that feeling of being watched...<br>  Every-time I have seen the Bishop, he is looking directly at me and it sends a shiver straight up my spine..<br>  He knows my energy and I know his, I just hope he stays where he is, as I honestly believe that there is something a wee bit sinister about him...<br>  <br>  I will tell you what happened to me when I first moved into my cottage in the country..<br>  One night I got outta the shower and was drying myself in the lounge room and all of a sudden I was freezing cold; I was as cold as if I were naked and out in a blizzard...<br>  I found my winter sleeping clothes(trackie daks, thermal T-shirt and a wind-cheater) and my thick woolly Pancho and I was still shivering; the temperature in my lounge room was 26C so I should have been quite comfortable in just a pair of shorts; the entity had changed my body temperature...<br>  This happened on 3 separate occasions and I contacted a psychic medium mate of mine and we sent him to the light..<br>  He was an adolescent child who was just having a bit of fun, but that fun could have killed me as it is not healthy to be all rugged up in winter clothing etc when it is in fact really quite warm inside the house....<br>  I still have one entity, and he causes me no dramas at all...<br>  In Light... )O(|`|ZKLlTxd0aa	The ghosts?

Xkas9BG2aa	I was born in Poland and my family immigrated to America when I was 5 years old.  Though I'm not in England, I have felt bigotry against our ethnic group here in America.  There have been times when I felt that I'm not considered white though am white.  White is considered to be English, German or Irish.  And you're not considered a minority...so therefore you feel that you're not in any category.<br>  <br>  There's a woman who is a big celebrity in America...Martha Stewart...whose both mother and father are Polish.  Her Polish surname was Kostyra, but with the bias & bigotry against a Polish name, she would not have become successful in the business world with that name.  It was on America news a few months ago that Britain denied her entrance to England because she was convicted of a white collar crime in America....and they don't want convicts in their land.  (Some of the American criminal cases are very questionable, so her court case was questionable.)  The joke is that Martha Stewart....with her WASP sounding name...is a Better WASP than most WASPs are.  She has to show them how to do things that they should already know how to do.  So for England to deny entry to her is a joke.  (Personally, I have no desire to go to England.) <br>  <br>  I would recommend to you that if you're not happy in England move elsewhere.  I personally have not been content everywhere in America, though for me, presently Salt Lake City, Utah, is a pleasant residence.

Whinging about personal failures and using other peoples successes as a yardstick by which to measure your own is a waste of time and that is where you can perhaps coin the term racist on a select few native white uk citizens who scream 'but its OUR country not THEIRS'.<br>  <br>  As for Polish immigrants, they simply get on with their own business like civil citizens of this land.

fDUCEX3Haa	wow, ur question reminded me that I have a test on the Iliad tomorrow so thanks for that. Anyways I tried answering some of your quuestions.<br>  1. The Gods discussed and decided that Hector should lose and Achilles should win.<br>  2. She disguised herself as his brother and reassured him that she would be there at his side.<br>  3. umm with his sword<br>  4. They preserved it so that it wouldn't get maggots or look like it's been dead for a while.<br>  5. To show the role of the hero in that culture as well as the Gods.<br>  6. Probably to show their importance to the Greeks and what they believed<br>  7. The Greeks firmly believed in their Gods so they knew that the Gods affected history. The Iliad is a perfect example, where they chose Hector to die over instead of Archilles. Hera wanted Troy burnt to the ground, while Appollo took the trojans side.

(2 Peter 3:10) "Unexpectedly" (Matt 24:36)<br>  <br>  That He would come with a new name and His New Name is "Glory of the Lord." (Isa 62:2) and (Rev 2:17)<br>  <br>  Accompanying His return, the "Gospel preached throughout the world..." (Matt 24:14) This happened in the 1840s when it was published that the Gospel of Jesus Christ reached every corner of the Globe.<br>  <br>  And so I think we should consider that just as the majority of the Jews failed to recognize Christ, that so too may we have failed to recognize the Return of Christ. Because Christ did not fit into the prophecies the way the Jews understood them, so does this make the prophecy wrong? Clearly not. For example the Messiah was to be named Emmanuel (Matt 1:23), and was to sit on the throne of David (Amos 9:14-15) and was to carry a sword and defeat enemies of God's chosen people (Isaiah 66:16). So we see that if we, like the Jews in the time of Christ confine ourselves to our understandings (our interpretations) then we too would have missed He who is the Lord. <br>  <br>  Finally I think we should look at two quotes: <br>  "My doctrine is not my own but His Who sent me. If any man's will is to do His will, he shall know whether the teaching is from God or wheter I speak of My Own authority. He who speaks on his own authority seeks his own glory; but he who seeks the glory of Him who sent Him is true." (John 7:16-18)<br>  <br>  "Verily, He Who is the Spirit of Truth is come to guide you unto all truth. He speaketh not a prompted by His Own Self, but as bidden by Him Who is the All-Knowing, The All-Wise... Not of My Own volition have I revealed myself but God, of His own choosing hath manifested Me... the fact that abasement in the path of God is my true glory... The glory of all greatness belongeth to God, the Incomparable, the All-Compelling" (Baha'u'llah), a title which means "Glory of God", came from the East (Persia), in the mid-1800s, and through persecution, because of His teachings, ended up in the far reaches of the Ottoman Empire (the Plain of Sharon) where He was a prisoner for the rest of His life.|`|HM2pvjWmaa	Jebus is cummin' back when Homer or Marge says so!

But your whole view on what you're saying is flawed.<br>  <br>  Satan influences people on earth to do what they want and believe what they want instead of God, so that they end up in hell. He can't treat them well in hell, since once people are in hell they have no escape, and God does not dwell in hell. Satan can't hurt anyone in heaven or "target" them. And satan doesn't respect anything or anyone, except for himself. He hates people because God loves us and we are made in Gods image. Satan will try decieve you to pull you away from God, making you think God is bad, or that you shouldn't have to obey God or believe in Him to be happy.<br>  <br>  You should try reading the bible, it tells alot about this.<br>  <br>  I can't make it any clearer.

He hates humans and hates God, alike.  He is a study, if you will, in adnormal psychology. <br>  <br>  You are thinking too rationally.  <br>  <br>  Think of it like a psychologist would. <br>  <br>  The Devil is basically a lot of normal emotions gone totally wrong, or taken to extremes. <br>  <br>  For example,  he has taken what should be normal understanding of his place in the universe (God's highest angel) and taken that fact to the extreme in the form of pride.  He believes he is the MOST high creation.  He has taken God's love for humanity to an extreme by believing that God favors the lowly humans over HIM.  He has taken the natural concept of justice to an extreme by feeling SLIGHTED by God because he loves the lowly humans.   You see at every turn,  a normal emotion is turned to the negative. <br>  <br>  He primarily hates HUMANS because he KNOWS we are beneath him.  He feels like the Angels in Heaven SHOULD have been enough for God, and us humans were an unnecessary creation. <br>  <br>  In a way he is like the ULTIMATE jealous sibling. -- Always saying "That's not fair,..they don't deserve that"<br>  <br>  At some point his anger and feeling of injustice and pride caused him to turn against God as well.  He hated US so  much that he ALSO hated the God which loved them. <br>  <br>  SO, as the poster-child for unbridled rage,  he urges us, encourages us to sin against God to hurt God.  THEN because he doesn't not love us or respect us.. ALSO tortures US, when we get to hell.  <br>  This to him is JUSTICE..what we DESERVE.  <br>  <br>  He is in a constant temper tantrum against God  AND also, once he gets his way,  isn't happy with that either. <br>  <br>  REALLY,  if you want to understand the Devil,  You need to look at him as a spoiled,  inmature, jealous, sibling. Who is rebelling against his Parent because he thinks he is unfair,  AND hates his siblings so he'll do anything to tear them down, as well. <br>  <br>  He doesn't love anyone besides himself.  He doesn't respect anyone but possibly God, only because he KNOWS first hand, he isn't more powerful then God.. which feeds into his rage, because he WANTS to be more powerful, so he can "correct" the injustice he believes God perpetrated when he created mankind.<br>  <br>  Psychologists may ALSO say that he is increasingly angry at himself and may even self loathe because no matter HOW much he tears down humankind, or rebels against God, it does nothing to change the situation.  Therefore his sense of injustice GROWS with each act of rebellion, there by making him MORE unhappy. <br>  <br>  Similar to how many Drug addicts deep down, self loath and the more they do drugs, the WORSE they feel about themselves. -- This type of behavior is very common in Psychology, creating endless circles of self destructive behavior.<br>  <br>  So far from what you think. This is NOT an inconsistency with Christianity.  Theologians have for a long time theorized about what makes Satan tick and why he is like he is.  I think he is a poster child for rage and jealousy taken to the extreme. <br>  <br>  He would have to have the capacity for love in order to respect the sinners.  He would have to see what they did as good and appreciate them.  But he doesn't.  That's the whole point.

However, the hole is not in the beliefs of *true* Christianity.  Rather, the teaching of eternal torment is a teaching that has its roots in pagan religion, & it was adopted by apostate Christianity.  Notice the original definition of the word 'hell' itself:<br>  <br>  "The modern English word Hell is derived from Old English hel, helle (about 725 AD) and ultimately from Proto-Germanic halja, meaning 'one who covers up or hides something' ".  Wikipedia  <br>  <br>  'Hell' was used to replace 'grave' in the early KJV, & is still found in the newer versions of it today.  However, 'helling potatoes' is simply storing them underground or in a cellar, &, helling a building is putting a roof or thatch covering on it.<br>  <br>  The 'lake of fire' is explained in Scripture to be 'the second death'.<br>  <a href="http://watchtower.org/bible/re/chapter_020.htm?bk=re;chp=20;vs=14;citation#bk14" rel="nofollow">http://watchtower.org/bible/re/chapter_0...</a><br>  And, death itself is described as total cessation of life. <a href="http://watchtower.org/bible/ge/chapter_003.htm?bk=ps;chp=3;vs=19;citation#bk19" rel="nofollow">http://watchtower.org/bible/ge/chapter_0...</a><br>  <a href="http://watchtower.org/bible/ec/chapter_009.htm?bk=ec;chp=9;vs=10;citation#bk10" rel="nofollow">http://watchtower.org/bible/ec/chapter_0...</a><br>  Adamic death leaves the  hope of resurrection... <br>  But, the second death is absolutely final: <br>  total, everlasting, nonexistence!<br>  <a href="http://watchtower.org/bible/ps/chapter_037.htm?bk=ps;chp=37;vs=28-29;citation#bk28" rel="nofollow">http://watchtower.org/bible/ps/chapter_0...</a><br>  <br>  What Really Is Hell? <br>  <a href="http://watchtower.org/e/20020715/article_02.htm" rel="nofollow">http://watchtower.org/e/20020715/article...</a><br>  <br>  Besides all of that:<br>  <br>  “He who has died has been **acquitted** from his sin.” --Romans 6:7  'Acquitted' = "declared not guilty; legally blameless!<br>  <br>  And, also:<br>  <br>  "...

Many of these cells are already being used to treat people with a wide variety of diseases. <br>  Cloning is a depersonalized way to reproduce in which human beings are manufactured in the laboratory to preset specifications. It is not a worthy way to bring a new human being into the world. When done for stem cell research, it involves the moral wrong of destroying an innocent human life for possible benefit to others, plus an additional wrong; it creates human beings solely in order to kill them for their cells. This is the ultimate reduction of a fellow human being to a mere means, to an instrument of other people's wishes,|`|TBbhmZEwaa	Well, i dont really think that there are certain religions in particular, its more that certain people feel that cloning goes against what is meant to be.

When my dad died young , so many people felt sorry ( I guess???) for me and my brothers, we were 18-25, and there was so much food alot went to waste. BUT, yes, it was appreciated. Now fast forward to 2007. Its not the YEAR that is in question, it is the WHY, or perhaps the terms of death that I remain so , so upset about I literally moved to another state. Im so upset I need a snoke...brb to finish.....aaarrrggghhhhh. Ok, so my 15 year old son killed himself, I am left with 4 other children and my husband. I couldnt even THINK about food! I dont know what my kids ate I was in such shock. When your child commits suicide, you find out real quick the friends and family you dont have. I can maybe understand that no one knew what to say to me, but I dont understand why they didnt attend his service, and in your questions case, why didnt anyone bring food? It would have been SO SO welcome! Heck, it STILL would! I still cant eat well! But my kids need to eat. Even if they didnt want to face me, they could have had some pizza delivered so my family could eat! <br>  Well, there is my public service announcement for today.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	They do it everywhere, it helps those who are too grief stricken to cook or even think about food.|`|r4xRkqzdaa	i live in the north (ohio for most of my life and penn for the past 2 years) and food is always customary to give when someone dies.|`|ec0c9e8415736306f06b43a3b3c74134aa	I am from Canada (Toronto) and we do this as well.

33E9E96iaa	Well, it's very unlikely and probably impossible. Though I have heard stories about people stolen by faeries slowly becoming a faerie as they live out an eternity in captivity, usually servitude as well. And most humanoid faeries are about from the size of a child to a tall woman, most faeries don't even look human in the first place. And the only powers are your basic Glamour (disguise) Healing (rumor only) and a few rather mundane powers like souring milk and causing dogs to go lame. Faeries aren't like Tinkerbelle, they are usually evil or mean. Even the nice ones can turn on you in an instant.|`|YTasscmKaa	Faeries are their own race. You can't become one any more than you could become an owl.|`|Is3pmbbKaa	Become one in your heart...<br>  Or die and go to Heaven then ask God if you can become one.<br>  If you lived a good life then he will probably grant your wish.<br>  (:|`|d3VV4b6vaa	faeries and humans are two very different things and its IMPOSSIBLE to turn into one. sorry its true. BUT you can connect with them and invite them into your life by 1. treating the environment and animals with care 2. leaving them offerings outside such as chocolate or milk. 3. growing a garden (the easiest and most effective way)  ask any great gardener and they will tell you the faeries are in there lives.<br>  (you might also be an incarnated faerie....do research on this....research doreen virtue as well)|`|31gN5L58aa	put on wings, and flyyyyyyyy awaaayy *note: don't be near heights...*<br>  <br>  and~<br>  please answer this (if you have a heart and soul):<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AqXscsqeOelY77_mey7aAfnsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090223151257AAXN8H0">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|jLL7sDILaa	You can't become a faerie.

I had a husband I loved deeply, I had an exciting career that paid a fortune, I had looks, designer clothes, a renovated loft and so much more.

That went well until I got to Venice and I fell into another world where I obsessed about death and walked along the canals late at night while drunk. I wanted to slip away into the water and I knew God wouldn't mind. After a couple of weeks I became frightened and got out of there and returned to Paris. I began unravelling further and came home.  Eventually I became too sick and lost job, home, gained weight from meds and was incapable at doing much.<br>  <br>  Never lost faith. It wasn't God's fault I knew life was hard.

Coincidence?<br>  <br>  Nobody has ever provided any evidence that any gods, much less a specific god, exist. People believe in specific gods because of indoctrination from an early age, tradition, apophenia, hallucinations, fear of torture (for gods sadistic enough to threaten it) and other similarly illogical reasons. But no gods exist in reality; these are all stories, created for people who were scared of the world long before we understood it. Now we have no more reason for these superstitions.<br>  <br>  And religious belief has caused more misery than any other idea throughout history.|`|9961a4fda02d0241974fd4e74d5ad8aeaa	I'm an atheist.

Are you out of your gourd?  There are over 10,000 religions on the planet and you can't just claim that anyone who doesn't love YOUR god loves YOUR devil.<br>  <br>  I, for one, walk in harmony with the Triple Goddess and Horned God, who live in every part of nature and in every one of us.  They are neither your god nor your devil, and I do not believe in no deities.  Stupid question.  Are you actually going to claim that all these religions are really Satanism in disguise?

But also because there are many theories that aim towards the non existence of gods. Evolution theories, the big bang theory and also the very fact that such books as the bible have been sourced on various other religions in which have been in existence prior to the first publication of the bible, greek mythology and paganism for example.|`|gxWYcxa3aa	I don't love either of them, and I'm not an atheist.

My beliefs make my life better, make me happier, calmer, nicer to live with.  They fit my ethical values and how I see the world.

Las imposibilidades son aquellas circuntancias en las cuales nosotros por nuestra propia fuerza o inteligencia no podemos atravesarlas victoriosamente. Existen cristianos que a pesar de tener a Cristo en el corazón viven con el pensamiento de que ellos son los que deben tomar la delantera en todas las cosas de la vida. Por cierto el resultado final aunque todo nos salga bien será evadir la voluntad de Dios para nuestras vidas.<br>  Al recibir a Cristo como nuestro Salvador y llegar a ser hijos de Dios podemos por el poder del Espíritu Santo y la guía de la Sagradas Escrituras hacer la preciosa voluntad de Dios. No hacerlo significa torcer el camino dise?ado por Dios. Hemos sido dise?ados no para tomar atajos sino para transitar en el camino correcto del Se?or. La clave es permitirle al Se?or no sólo ser el residente sino también el Presidente de nuestras vidas. Cuando eso sucede experimentaremos el Se?orío de Cristo y el comenzará a enderezar todo lo que hemos torcido por nuestra desobediencia. Dejar al Se?or a que ocupe el primer lugar en nuestras vidas es una garantía de que vamos a llegar a buen destino.<br>  <br>  LE DOY LA DELANTERA DE MI VIDA AL SE?OR PARA QUE ME DIRIJA<br>  <br>  ORACION:<br>  Reconozco que me falta tu presidencia oh Se?or. El resultado ha sido que muchos de mis caminos se han torcido. Te clamo en este día para que me ayudes a salir del pozo de la desesperación y encauces mi vida en tu preciosa voluntad.

No hay otro mandamiento mayor que éstos. <br>  12.32   Entonces el escriba le dijo: Bien, Maestro, verdad has dicho, que uno es Dios, y no hay otro fuera de él; <br>  12.33   y que amarle de todo corazón, y de todo entendimiento, y de toda el alma, y de todas las fuerzas; y amar al prójimo como a sí mismo, más es que todos los holocaustos y sacrificios. <br>  <br>  Pienso que por eso no dimos correcta la respuestas, ya que las tablas son una, y Jesus resumio los diez mandamientos en dos, como puedes ver al inicio.<br>  <br>  Saludos|`|89bbd3c4e489fec0d0f800979ae1d950aa	Mandar no implica obedecer.

Pero a pesar de todo los creyentes no pueden prescindir de la Biblia, a pesar de todo no pueden prescindir del Génesis. Es la única prueba de su dios. Alguien escribió en el Génesis que Dios existía y a partir de ahí lo toman como prueba de que Dios existe, rechazar el Génesis y la Biblia sería dejar sin base el mismo Dios. <br>  De ahí el dilema de los creyentes, saben que la Biblia es indefendible, saben que es mentira, saben que ya nadie la cree, saben que no contiene ninguna base científica ni verídica, pero no pueden prescindir de ella, porque aunque sea una fábula es la única prueba de ese dios. Saben que la Biblia miente, saben que ellos mienten, pero no les importa seguir mintiendo. Saben que su fe se basa en una mentira indefendible, pero no les importa seguir mintiendo. <br>  <br>  Crearon una fábula, un dios monstruoso, idearon una mentira, saben que toda su religión y los principios morales en que se basan están basados en una mentira, pero no pueden prescindir de ella por que se quedarían sin Dios. ?Quizá sea por eso por lo que algún creyente no se atreve a contestar cuando le pregunto decenas de veces si considera que la biblia es la palabra de Dios? Es plenamente consciente de que la Biblia miente, pero no puede contestar por que sin ella se quedaría sin dios padre, pero sobre todo se quedaría sin dios hijo. Por que no puede haber dios hijo sin haber dios padre. Y el dios hijo es la base del cristianismo. <br>  <br>  Despojar a Cristo de su naturaleza divina lo convertiría en un filósofo mediocre, muy mediocre, un filósofo que en unos sitios dice una cosa y otros dice la contraria, por eso se obstinan en defender a un dios padre por muy basado que esté en la fábula y en la mentira.|`|f6e8f18e271abcbbf579eb901716b74faa	Hola amigo, espero que esta respuesta te satisfaga.<br>  <br>  En la Biblia si existen palabras de Adán respondiendo a Jehova, te podría dar los versículos pero respetando tu pregunta, solamente te diré las palabras que utilizo según escritos antiguos.<br>  <br>  La Biblia son escritos sagrados para los antiguos, aún caben en nuestros días.  Esta escrita para dar conocimiento, el árbol que Jehova plantó en el centro del jardin, era un símbolo, se trata de lo que significa la vida eterna, la transgresión a una ley, si sabes que estas haciendo mal y aun asi lo haces, ese es el pecado, el hecho de desobedecer.<br>  <br>  JEHOVA: Y llamó el SE?OR Dios al hombre, y le dijo: ?Dónde estás tú? <br>  <br>  ADAN: Y él respondió: Oí tu voz en el huerto, y tuve miedo, porque estaba desnudo; y me escondí. <br>  <br>  JEHOVA: Y le dijo: ?Quién te ense?ó que estabas desnudo? ?Has comido del árbol de que yo te mandé no comieses? <br>  <br>  ADAN:  Y el hombre respondió: La mujer que me diste, ella me dio del árbol, y comí. <br>  <br>  Verdad que el responde no acusa, cuando dice esto, te digo que sí hay versículos donde Adan habla con Jehova.

Al contrario muchas científicos afirman la existencia de Dios al ver el intrincado dise?o de los seres vivientes. Si existe un dise?o también existe un dise?ador. Esto es  lógico, razonable e irrefutable. Sobre maría, en ninguna parte de la biblia dice que ella era celestial. Ella perteneció a la linea del Rey David y su esposo José también. El espíritu santo de Jehová, su fuerza activa, protegió a el mesías mientras estuvo en el vientre de su madre. Por eso nació perfecto, sin pecado. Jehová significa: “YO RESULTARé SER LO QUE RESULTARé SER”. Esta en éxodo 3:14. Esto quiere decir que Jehová es un Dios de propósito, el sera lo que haga falta ser para cumplir todos sus propósitos y como es el único perfecto nunca falla. Lo que siempre les digo a mis amigos, si piensas que lo que escribo no es verdad, te invito a refutarlo. Que tengas un hermoso día.

SCkhQc2Caa	Praise be to Allaah.<br>  <br>  It is sufficient for you to be a Muslim who follows the sharee’ah. With regard to Hanbali or Shaafa’i madhhabs, you do not have to restrict yourself to that. <br>  <br>  Those (four) scholars have a high status that is well known throughout this Ummah; their words were written down and followed by their companions and followers, and became madhhabs that were recognized and known, even though they were agreed on matters of belief and Tawheed. <br>  <br>  They were also close to one another on minor issues, but it so happened that one of them might be unaware of some evidence (daleel) or its correct interpretation, so he made ijtihaad and issued fatwaas based on his ijtihaad.<br>  <br>   They did not oblige others to adhere to what they said, but most of those followers adopted sectarian attitudes and restricted themselves to the views of those imaams even if they went against the daleel.<br>  <br>   They went to great length to interpret the texts in such a manner as to make them agree with what they thought. <br>  <br>  On this basis, we advise the “rank and file” to call themselves Muslims and to refer problematic issues to respectable scholars and to consult the works of scholars who are known for their sincere devotion to Islam and the Muslims. And Allaah knows best.<br>  <br>  [al-Lu’lu’ al-Makeen min Fataawaa Ibn Jibreen, p. 30]<br>  ______________________________________<br>  <br>  So long as a Muslim is following the correct evidence (daleel) and has the desire to follow the Sunnah properly, there is no harm in following any of the Imams when it comes to rules of fiqh. In the case of the ordinary Muslim (who is not educated in fiqh), his madhhab (school of thought) is that of the mufti whose knowledge he trusts. <br>  <br>  But problems of the worst type occur when people become fanatically devoted to one particular imam or madhhab, to the extent that they reject the truth or ignore other sound evidence because of this.<br>  <br>  Allaah warns against rejecting the word of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) (interpretation of the meaning): “… And let those who oppose the Messenger’s commandment (i.e., his Sunnah) (among the sects) beware, lest some fitnah (disbelief, trials, afflictions, etc.) befall them or a painful torment be inflicted on them.” [al-Noor 24:63] <br>  _______________________________<br>  <br>  Is it obligatory to follow a particular madhhab?  : <a href="http://isl*am-qa.com/en/ref/21420" rel="nofollow">http://isl*am-qa.com/en/ref/21420</a><br>  <br>  Should every country be obliged to follow a particular madhhab (school of thought)? : <a href="http://isl*am-qa.com/en/ref/103339" rel="nofollow">http://isl*am-qa.com/en/ref/103339</a><br>  _______________________________<br>  <br>  remove * from the links<br>  _______________________________|`|m3YC7Jcyaa	All from the best example Muhammed SAW... so it would all be from Muhammed SAW which was from Allah SWT unless used to alter for some bend sideways left intention.. as that also exists.|`|X8kP7G5Saa	The four madhabs that you cite are really just differing on how to carry out the sharia injunctions ie prayer, zakat rules etc.<br>  <br>  The mainstream Sunni school has a strong sense of the collective Ummah and egalitarianism, the Shi'i have a strong intellectualism and devotion to the Prophet SAW, and Sufi Tariqahs are high on spiritual dimension.<br>  <br>  Try a bit of all and feel the diversity and vitality of Islam. Each branch has its seeds in the Message.|`|abisG2QIaa	Please do NOT listen to the above poster.<br>  <br>  I advise you to seek out this;<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divisions_of_Islam" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divisions_o...</a><br>  <br>  As I see it to be very reliable!<br>  The Schools of thought are just different interpretations of sayings and how to apply Islam to your daily life, they dont alternate AT ALL in beliefs!! They only vary on some very slight Fiqh (rulings) such as whether to delay the prayer of Asr by one hour, whether it is halal to keep a dog, how one should trim their beard etc. etc.<br>  <br>  The actualy beliefs of Islam are all the same!
ZmdIlkpQaa	My Companion's elder sister has been blind nearly all her life, so I'm basing my answer on the conversations I've had with her over the period of the last 15 years or so.<br>  <br>  For her, initial attraction often has to do with being well spoken, and having an "attractive voice."  She actually has said that she used to have crushes on radio announcers and the people who did TV ads, because they had such smooth voices and such excellent diction.  <br>  <br>  Once she was attracted to someone, then their personalities, intellect and scent were major elements of additional attraction.  She has said often that the blind may be the only people who really do fall for someone because of their personalities, assuming they're hygenic...lol.<br>  <br>  Race does not factor in for her at all.  She's never seen a black person or a white one or an Arabic one or whatever.  She falls for people based upon their ideas, their personalities.  As a result, she's dated an amazing array of people from every racial group you can think of.  <br>  <br>  Although she says it's not generally true for the blind, she also doesn't care so much about gender in who she falls for.  She's dated men and women, and again is far more concerned with how smart they are, what sort of conversationalists they are, than what their genitalia looks like.  <br>  <br>  She's actually really cool, and has loved deeply, if not wisely.  I admire her a good deal.  Of course, I might be biased.  The first time she met me, she asked her sister if she'd mind sharing me...LOL...and also, she's very smart and very wise, and has often helped my avoid putting a foot wrong in my relationship with her sister.|`|Rkz68cIJaa	that is SUCH a good question. i've wondered about that too.. i have no idea<br>  <br>  maybe they get turned on by smells.. or like dirty talk must do alot for them too. also they still have the sense of touch. i think touching would be enough to get them going lol

After you get an account, go to answers.yahoo.com<br>  3. Then just click on the white box with green letters and find a question you want to answer.<br>  4. When you find the question you want to answer, click on the button just below the question. It will be a blue box with white lettering and it will say "Answer question."<br>  5. Answer the question, click the blue box that says "preview" and then click submit or edit your answer and repeat this step.|`|TzZnsjquaa	I think you've answered your own question..|`|tQsxsuNPaa	Well,looks like you've already figured it out.

Explain that it's very dirty, but you fear breaking it by cleaning it yourself.  Since the property is also their investment, it would make sense for them to want to protect that investment by helping you out in this situation.|`|0PvpGjSqaa	no you can ask, but i would explain to them why you want them to do it because they may not understand why you can't do it on your own.|`|Y7CGMwodaa	It never hurts to ask...|`|MY8A1MByaa	alot of management co. add those kinds of tasks in as perks i would just call and check on it better to be safe than sorry

mx1HHyteaa	Adicción. La búsqueda y el consumo compulsivo de sustancias psicotrópicas, o, de manera más genérica, de ciertas situaciones que suelen ser gratificantes, suele recibir la denominación de "adicción". Usualmente el término se ha vinculado al consumo de sustancias psicoactivas, pero se ha extendido a otras situaciones que no requieren del consumo de alguna sustancia, como el juego o el uso de internet. El término ha estado sometido a múltiples discusiones a lo largo del siglo XX y XXI, y ha sido objeto de variadas definiciones que reflejan, más bien, el estado de ánimo social y político más que una discusión netamente científica. La OMS, por ejemplo, ha utilizado los términos "habituación", "farmacodepedencia", "uso perjudicial" y otros para referirse al uso de sustancias, lo que refleja la discusión al interior de los diversos comités que se han formado para discutir el tema.<br>  <br>  En la actualidad existe un cierto consenso, no completamente aceptado, que distingue al menos dos fenómenos relacionados con el uso de sustancias psicoactivas: adicción y dependencia. Estos dos fenómenos son completamente diferenciables tanto en la clínica como en la neurobiología, conducta y tratamiento. Sin embargo, los dos grandes manuales de consenso en torno a los trastornos psiquiátricos (el DSM IV de la American Psychiatric Association, y la CIE-10, de la OMS) presentan una mezcla de sus signos característicos.<br>  <br>  Originalmente, adicto era quien seguía ciegamente al líder, sin criticarlo ni decirle nada (en latín a-dictio: ‘no dicción’). Luego se llamó addictus a un ‘esclavo’ por deudas. De allí addictio: ‘adjudicación, cesión al mejor postor, consagración, dedicación’.|`|VXfWwVrPaa	buscas una explicación culta?<br>  Es un estado de intoxicación crónica y periódica originada por el consumo repetido de una droga, natural o sintética, caracterizada por:<br>  Una compulsión a continuar consumiendo por cualquier medio.<br>  Una tendencia al aumento de la dosis.<br>  Una dependencia psíquica y generalmente física de los efectos.<br>  Consecuencias perjudiciales para el individuo y la sociedad.|`|nnsxzqVLaa	Para mí adicción es cuando algo te domina , tu mente y tu cuerpo y no puedes controlarlo , es un deseo mucho más fuerte que tú y te controla aunque tú no quieras , y vives pendiente de eso que se vuelve parte indispensable en tí , por ejemplo el deseo de fumar se vuelve una necesidad , que no puedes controlar ni dejar por tí mismo , sólo con ayuda de terceros , generalmente de algún profesional y con mucha fuerza de voluntad.

Efesios 4:26 dice: 26 Estén airados, y, no obstante, no pequen; que no se ponga el sol estando ustedes en estado provocado, 1 Juan 3:15 dice: 15 Todo el que odia a su hermano es homicida, y ustedes saben que ningún homicida tiene la vida eterna [como cosa] permanente en él. Mateo 10:28 dice: 28 Y no se hagan temerosos de los que matan el cuerpo pero no pueden matar el alma; sino, más bien, teman al que puede destruir tanto el alma como el cuerpo en el Gehena.  El análisis es el siguiente: no es de sabios estar enojados con alguien, es mejor hacer las paces. En caso contrario nuestro enojo se puede convertir en ira y esto nos puede llevar incluso a cometer un asesinato.Esto ya a pasado millones de veces. Si nos convertimos en homicidas no podremos alcanzar la vida eterna.

[23]Si, pues, al presentar tu ofrenda en el altar te acuerdas entonces de que un hermano tuyo tiene algo contra ti, [24]deja tu ofrenda allí, delante del altar, y vete primero a reconciliarte con tu hermano; luego vuelves y presentas tu ofrenda.

Sacá tus propias conclusiones:<br>  <br>  San Lázaro y sus dos hermanas, María (la que ungió al Se?or con perfume y le secó los pies con sus cabellos) y Marta, eran amigos de Jesús y le invitaban a su casa en Betania, cerca de Jerusalén. En aquel hogar Jesús era amado y visitaba cuando estaba en Jerusalén.   Esto le era muy importante ya que Jesús no tenía casa propia ni siquiera una piedra donde recostar su cabeza (Lc 9,58)<br>  ?Se siente Jesús acogido en tu casa? ?Es amado como en Betania, se le da toda la atención a escucharle? ?Hay actitudes, programas de radio, u otras cosas que le ofenden en tu hogar?<br>  <br>  Jesús resucitó a Lázaro.  Ver: Juan 11,1-44. <br>  <br>  Ya en el siglo III se le veneraba en toda la Iglesia. Eteria (c.390), una peregrina a Jerusalén, describe impresionada sobre la gran procesión que se hacía el sábado anterior al Domingo de Ramos al "Lazarium" (sitio en el que Lázaro había sido resucitado.<br>  <br>  No sabemos de su vida posterior pero hay muchas tradiciones. En las Pseudo-Clementinas se cuenta que Lázaro acompa?ó a San Pedro a Siria. La tradición más común en el oriente afirma que los judíos embarcaron a Lázaro en Jaffa en una nave que hacía agua, junto con sus dos hermanas y otros cristianos, y la nave llegó milagrosamente a la isla de Chipre. Lázaro fue, según esa tradición, elegido obispo de Kition (Larnaka), y murió 30 a?os después. <br>  <br>  El a?o 890, el emperador León VI construyó una iglesia y un monasterio en su honor en Constantinopla y trasladó allá una parte de las pretendidas reliquias, que se hallaban en Chipre.<br>  <br>  En el siglo XI, en relación de la leyenda provenzal de Santa María Magdalena, empezó a decirse que Lázaro había sido obispo de Provenza y había muerto mártir en Francia.  El Papa Benedicto IX, en ocasión de la consagración de la iglesia de San Víctor de Marsella, hace alusión a las reliquias de Lázaro que estaban ahí. <br>  <br>  Hay otro Lázaro en el Evangelio: El pobre ilustrado en la parábola de Jesus (Cf. Lc 16,20-25), el cual es representado popularmente con perros y muleta. Este NO es un personaje histórico sino parte de una parábola de Jesús. Por lo tanto NO es un santo<br>  <br>  Saludos!!!!!|`|uGKq9b0Daa	No estaba muerto...........ANDABA DE PARRANDA ! ! !<br>  <br>  <br>  (mis diez puntos por favor......)<br>  <br>  \=]

No se usa la "h", seguramente como es muda no va a protestar, se pone "aser" en vez de la forma correcta que es hacer. Se usa indistintamente la "j" y la "g", se pone targeta, en vez de la forma correcta que es tarjeta.

Lo mismo con signos de exclamación<br>  - Empezar oraciones con minúscula, y no terminarlas con un punto.<br>  - Dejar espacio antes de una coma o punto, o no dejarlo después de uno.<br>  - Escribir nombres propios con minúscula (maría, juan, parís, etc)<br>  <br>  Otros errores:<br>  - Muchas veces en el tipo de oraciones de "si..., entonces..." se usan incorrectamente los tiempos de los verbos. Como es un poco largo de explicar, voy a dar un par de ejemplos de como debe escribirse: "Si yo HUBIERA/HUBIESE (cualquiera de los dos es correcto) escrito esta pregunta, HABRíA usado correctamente la gramática" "Si él ESTUDIARA/ESTUDIASE, entonces APROBARíA los exámenes"<br>  - La gran mayoría de las veces veo escrito 'haber' o 'aver' en vez de 'a ver', 'hallan' en vez de 'hayan', y cosas por el estilo.<br>  - Escribir 'porque' en preguntas o 'por que' en respuestas, debiendo escribir "?Por qué...?" en las preguntas, cuyas respuestas se deberían empezar con un "Porque..."<br>  - "A sido..." o "Ah sido..." en vez de "Ha sido..."<br>  - Y algo que no es necesariamente un error, pero no es lo correcto, es quienes ESCRIBEN TODO CON MAYúSCULAS.<br>  <br>  Errores ortográficos hay muchisimos, pero algunos pueden ser:<br>  - Escribir 'llendo' en vez de 'yendo'.<br>  - Intercambiar z, s y c, o b por v y viceversa, etc.<br>  - Y algo que ya es más subjetivo, escribir mal las onomatopeyas; por ejemplo un grito sería "?AH!" y no "?HA!"; jaja, y tengo un amigo que siempre lo escribe de la segunda forma.<br>  <br>  Algunos que saco de las respuestas de esta misma pregunta:<br>  - 'aveces' en vez de 'a veces'<br>  - 'hacerca' en vez de 'acerca'<br>  <br>  Y no sé porque es algo tan común que la gente escriba tan mal, si en la escuela desde la primaria nos ense?an a escribir correctamente.<br>  Saludos.|`|94ec800638b2ec660e5ff022071f9142aa	Te paso el error y tu deduce lo correcto:<br>  pader <br>  entén,<br>  tortias<br>  ejo e su<br>  inga tu m...<br>  polecía<br>  salte pa′ fuera<br>  métete pa′dentro<br>  sube pa′rriba<br>  baja pa′bajo<br>  si fuera sabido|`|J0TTsoetaa	los errores que yo cometo normal mente son que no se manejar muy bien el teclado del computador, y en revisar ortografía aveces no aparecen como este, ''anos'' hacerca de la edad para que me entiendas y otro es ''unas'' hacerca de los dedos.|`|K47ahcNjaa	Sin duda alguna la "s" al final de las palabras,  Omision de algunas otras como Haya y lo peor de todo la mala pronunciacion de algunas como difiriencia o diabetis en lugar de diferencia o diabetes , saludos

Estamos acampando al pie del Monte Sinaí, así como los hijos de Israel en el libro de éxodo. Es obvio que hemos alcanzado el punto donde vamos a tener que tomar una decisión. ?Seguiremos o escaparemos?<br>  <br>  El se?or trajo a los descendientes de Abraham al pie del Monte Sinaí, pero no fue fácil. Cuando la multitud de personas necesitaban comida, Dios quiso que lo buscaran por pan, pero en lugar de eso, rega?aron a Moisés y le dijeron cuán bueno era estar en Egipto, el lugar de la esclavitud. <br>  <br>  Lo mismo ocurrió cuando hubo escasez de agua. En lugar de pedirle a Dios o creer en su abundante provisión, arrinconaron inmediatamente a Moisés para quejarse y recordarle los “buenos días pasados” en Egipto. <br>  <br>  Dios tenía algo mejor para los hijos de Israel, pero fue como si hubiera pensado, “si solo puedo hacer que pasen esta monta?a, entonces puedo tener esperanza de llevarlos todo el camino”.<br>  <br>  La triste y desafortunada verdad del Libro de éxodo es que ese diverso grupo de personas que Dios trajo al Monte Sinaí no fue el grupo de personas que hizo atravesar el río Jordán hacia la tierra prometida. <br>  <br>  Algo sucedió en la monta?a. Dios los llamó e hizo de ellos una nación por primera vez en la historia. Los llamó a un lugar – un lugar de bendición y un lugar de cambio – y ellos no quisieron ir.<br>  <br>  No caiga en la trampa de pensar que ese “lugar” era meramente un punto físico en el mapa, porque esas personas ya estaban deambulando a través del desierto. <br>  <br>  Su bendición no consistía de algún lugar real, aunque la tierra prometida era parte del paquete pactado. Dios los llamó a una tierra prometida por él. Los llamó a un lugar de pacto, un lugar de intimidad con su Creador que no fue ofrecido a ningún otro pueblo sobre el planeta en ese tiempo. <br>  <br>  Este es el secreto del lugar secreto. ?Nosotros pensamos que la idea de un “reino de sacerdotes” es una idea exclusivamente del Nuevo Testamento o cristiana, pero era también el plan original de Dios para Israel!<br>  <br>  Y moisés subió a Dios; y Jehová lo llamó desde el monte, diciendo: Así dirás a la casa de Jacob, y anunciarás a los hijos de Israel: Vosotros visteis lo que hice a los egipcios, y cómo os tomé sobre alas de águilas, y os he traído a mí.<br>  <br>  Ahora pues, si diereis oído a mi voz, y guardareis mi pacto, vosotros seréis mi especial tesoro sobre todos los pueblos; porque mía es toda la tierra.<br>  Y vosotros me seréis un reino de sacerdotes, y gente santa. éstas son las palabras que dirás a los hijos de Israel. (éxodo 19:3-6).<br>  <br>  Aunque la primera generación de israelitas reunidos alrededor de la monta?a creería a los espías temerosos y retrocedería ante la tierra prometida por temor, la verdadera causa de su fracaso se encuentra justo allí al pie del Monte Sinaí. Dios quería que todos los israelitas se acercaran a él en la monta?a, pero a ellos esto no le agradó.<br>  <br>  Todo el pueblo observaba el estruendo y los relámpagos, y el sonido de la bocina, y el monte que humeaba; y viéndolo el pueblo, temblaron, y se pusieron de lejos. Y dijeron a Moisés: habla tú con nosotros, y nosotros oiremos; pero no hable Dios con nosotros, para que no muramos.<br>  <br>  Y moisés respondió al pueblo: No temáis; porque para probaros vino Dios, y para que su temor esté delante de vosotros, para que no pequéis.<br>  Entonces el pueblo estuvo a lo lejos, y Moisés se acercó a la oscuridad en la cual estaba Dios. (éxodo 20:18-21).<br>  <br>  Ellos vieron los relámpagos y escucharon los truenos, y retrocedieron con temor. Huyeron de la presencia de Dios en lugar de buscarlo como hizo Moisés. No estaban felices con el estilo de liderazgo que Dios había elegido. <br>  <br>  Dios no podía deponer su identidad como el Dios Todopoderoso sola para agradar al hombre, y no lo hará tampoco hoy. De modo que el resultado final de su huída de la intimidad santa ese día fue que murieron antes de que ellos o sus hijos entraran en la tierra prometida. Prefirieron el respeto distante por sobre una relación íntima.<br>  <br>  No era el plan original de Dios que la primera generación de israelitas muriera en el desierto. Dios quería llevar al mismo grupo de personas a quienes sacó de la tierra de esclavitud hacia la tierra de promesa. Quería dar a su nueva nación de antiguos esclavos su propia tierra y heredad, pero no la tuvieron a causa del temor y la incredulidad. <br>  <br>  Su condena fue sellada cuando miraron a través del Jordán la tierra prometida y retrocedieron, pero comenzó realmente cuando retrocedieron de la presencia de Dios en la nube sobre el Monte Sinaí. Fue allí que ellos huyeron de Dios y demandaron que Moisés se colocara entre ellos y Dios.<br>  <br>  La iglesia ha sufrido del mismo problema desde entonces. A menudo preferimos que un hombre se coloque entre nosotros y Dios. Tenemos un temor carnal inspirado del infierno, a la intimidad santa con Dios. <br>  <br>  Las raíces de este temor se remontan al Jardín del Edén. Adán y Eva se escondieron con vergonzoso temor, mientras Dios anhelaba una dulce amistad.<br>  Hoy enfrentamos el mismo desafío que los hijos de Israel hace miles de a?os: ?Escapar o entrar? ?Entrar a dónde? A la presencia de Dios.<br>  <br>  Dios llamaba al pueblo a una intimidad, y ellos corrieron en la dirección contraria. Le dijeron a Moisés “…no hable Dios con nosotros, para que no muramos” (éxodo 20:19). <br>  <br>  Entendían que solo las cosas que se asemejaban a las características de Dios como estaba descrito en los Diez Mandamientos, podían permanecer para vivir en su presencia. Al escaparse, ellos decían: “Mira, no queremos vivir de esa manera. <br>  <br>  No permitas que Dios nos hable ahora”. Todo lo que Dios quería que hicieran cuando le dio a Moisés los Diez Mandamientos, era arreglar sus hechos para que él pudiera hacer más que solo mirarlos desde lejos. <br>  <br>  Dios quería caminar con ellos una vez más en el calor del día desértico. Quería sentarse con ellos y abrir su corazón en íntima comunión. Nada ha cambiado, mi amigo. Nuestra respuesta conveniente es: “Por favor, Dios habla con nosotros, ?incluso si por hacerlo morimos!”<br>  <br>  Creo que la iglesia está parada en una encrucijada crítica hoy. Por un lado podríamos decir: “Hemos llegado demasiado lejos como para volvernos ahora”. Pero también podríamos decir: “Estamos realmente cansados. <br>  <br>  Queremos sentarnos aquí por un momento”. La verdadera pregunta es: “?Qué dice Dios?” Yo creo que él quiere que entendamos dónde estamos en este momento. Quiere que nos extendamos y recibamos todo lo que él tiene para darnos hoy.<br>  <br>  Usted y yo vamos a hacer una de estas dos cosas desde este momento en adelante:<br>  <br>  1. Creceremos en una relación con él, sin importar lo que nos cueste, o regresaremos de donde hemos venido y nos convertiremos en personas conductoras de programas, de reuniones, organizaremos comités eclesiásticos, haremos todas las cosas “buenas” que las “buenas personas” se supone que hacen.<br>  <br>  Terminaremos por mirar cari?osamente hacia ese momento de decisión y diremos: “Aquellos fueron los días”.<br>  <br>  No se usted, pero yo no quiero envejecer y mirar con pesar a algunos días y decir: “OH, aquellos fueron días grandiosos”. ?Por qué debería hacerlo cuando tengo que entender que con Dios puedo vivir en el tiempo presente? Puedo caminar en la frescura de lo que él tiene para mi cada día. <br>  <br>  Si me atrevo a seguir a Dios hoy, entonces ma?ana podré ser capaz de mirar hacia atrás y decir: “recuerdo aquellos a?os; ?eso fue antes de que tuviéramos el gran avivamiento de la presencia de Dios!”<br>  <br>  Francamente, nuestro futuro depende de nuestra actitud en esta hora de decisión. Si nuestra decisión es: “Bien, lo hemos hecho bastante bien”, entonces esto es probablemente todo lo que haremos. <br>  <br>  Pero nuestros futuros serán totalmente diferentes si decimos: “Gracias, Se?or…pero ?dónde está el resto? ?Tiene que haber más! ?Muéstrame tu gloria!”<br>  <br>  Necesitamos aprender de los acontecimientos en el Monte Sinaí. Primero de todo, Dios reveló en el Monte Sinaí que él quería comenzar a tratar con el pueblo directa y personalmente. Hasta ese día Moisés siempre había transmitido a los israelitas todo lo que Dios decía. <br>  <br>  Ese fue un tiempo de transición, un período en el cual Dios decía: “Está bien, es tiempo de crecer. Quiero hablarles directamente a partir de ahora, como una nación completa de sacerdotes santos. <br>  <br>  No quiero más que tengan intermediarios. Amo a Moisés, pero no quiero tener que hablar a través de él para llegar a ustedes. Quiero tratar con ustedes directamente como nación, como mi pueblo”.<br>  <br>  Desdichadamente, los israelitas sufrieron del mismo problema que muchos cristianos hoy. Nos hemos convertido en adictos a la unción, la palabra transmitida por medio de una buena predicación y ense?anza. <br>  <br>  Muchos de nosotros nos hemos convertido en “bebes de pecho” que queremos sentarnos en bancos con almohadones en un edificio con aire acondicionado y climatizado, donde alguien más dijera con anterioridad lo que Dios tiene para decir, y luego lo regurgite a nosotros en una forma media digerida.<br>  <br>  La solución es el hambre y desesperación por Dios mismo sin intermediarios. Necesitamos orar: ?Dios, estoy cansado de que otras personas te escuchen! ?Dónde está la traba de mi armario? ?Voy a encerrarme hasta escucharte por mí mismo!”<br>  <br>  Dios está cansado de tener relaciones lejanas con su pueblo. Estuvo cansado de ellas hace miles de a?os, en los días de Moisés, y está cansado de ellas hoy. <br>  <br>  él realmente quiere tener intimidad, encuentros cercanos con usted y conmigo. Quiere invadir nuestros hogares con su permanente presencia, de una manera que hará que cada visitante comience a llorar con asombro y adoración en el momento que entre.<br>  <br>  Tanto como puedo decirle, solo hay una cosa que lo detiene. Dios no va avenir a donde no encuentre hambre. él busca al hambriento. Hambre significa que usted está insatisfecho con la manera que ha sido, porque lo forzó a vivir sin Dios en su plenitud. <br>  <br>  Dios solo viene cuando usted está preparado para volver con todo a él. Dios regresa para recobrar su Iglesia, pero usted tiene estar hambriento. ?Cuán hambriento está? <br>  <br>  DIOS TE BENDIGA QUERIDO AMIGO ( soy cristiano evangelico para la gloria de Dios )|`|a518f614b3ae2b03e9d191fe5fd396a2aa	En sí las religiones que se Basan en el Cristianismo son lo más Absurdas y contradictorias de lo que pensamos...<br>  <br>  Como bien lo hemos visto a lo largo de 20 siglos, ellos son los primeros en tomar la Muerte como Solución...<br>  <br>  No olvidemos que la injusta, cruel y sangrienta muerte de un inocente llamado Jesús es la base principal de su gran "Fe" o mejor dicho, su Gran Negocio Religioso!!!<br>  <br>  En el caso de la Católica...<br>  Quien dice que el Gran Imperio Romano se "extinguió" hace tiempo???<br>  <br>  Ese gran imperio sigue operando de la misma forma, lo único que tiene como diferencia es que ahora está cubierto bajo un velo dogmático llamado Catolicismo...

Esto es lo que podía deducirse del concepto de presente.

Ahora era un concepto vigente en todas partes, ?o no? Parecía que todo el universo tenía el mismo presente. <br>  <br>  La teoría de la relatividad destruyó la base de estas convicciones. Einstein nos ense?ó que dos acontecimientos pueden ocurrir simultáneamente para un observador, mientras que otro observador que se mueva relativamente respecto al primero, percibirá estos dos acontecimientos sucesivamente. Un tercer observador quizá los vea por un orden sucesivo inverso al del segundo observador. Naturalmente en nuestra vida diaria no existe algo parecido. Esto se debe a que en nuestro ámbito vital las distancias y las velocidades son demasiado peque?as para poder notar nada de la relatividad. pero ésta existe y sus consecuencias son de gran alcance." ---<br>  <br>  Albert Einstein dijo: "La diferenciación entre pasado, presente y futuro no es más que una ilusión, por muy tercamente que nos agarremos a ella".<br>  <br>  Saludos|`|abf0d593eee51745546111fec2088018aa	Si existe pero pasa y no vuelve nunca más.<br>  El tiempo junto con las dimensiones espaciales: largo, ancho y espesor; forman las dimensiones del Universo.

Yo nací en una familia católica y con el paso del tiempo me desligue en su totalidad, al darme cuenta de la porqueria que son la mayoria de sus jerarcas, al enterarme  de la historia bastante más negra que buena durante los aproxidamente 2000 a?os  que lleva de existencia  (son menos, pero, ahora mismo no  recuerdo  las fechas del gobierno Contantino el primer emperador romano que  institucionalizó  la religion catolica ), en fin, no sólo son hechos del pasado, como el invento de  instrumentos de tortura y la persecucion de muchos inocentes durante el tiempo que duró la inquisición, sino , en la actualidad los grandes manejos economicos, politicos, y otros latrocinios legales, sin contar con las irregularidades que son parte del conocimiento comun. La gran contradicción que es  por ejemplo  la existencia de sacerdotes homosexuales, cuando la iglesia los condena, el que sean complices los altos jerarcas incluyendo al papa, de delitos como la corrupcion y abuso de menores sexualmente hablando. Con ejemplos asi, dicha religión no puede tener feligreses responsables. Incluso la confesión no es otra cosa que un ejemplo de más de esa hípocresia que tanto te admira, pues, una vez que se realiza el acto de contriccion puedes volver a las andandas siempre y cuando vayas y te confieses y asi eludas la responsabilidad de tus actos. Este tipo de farsas son segun veo sólo unos cuantos ejemplos para que tu duda quede  un tanto discipada y tampoco te confundas tanto. Que con religión o sin ella la mayoria de  los humanos se dejan llevar por actos egoistas cuyas consecuencias les importan muy poco, pues aparentemente no les afectaran directamente.|`|0nnzpqBNaa	creo que hay tantas religiones en este mundo lo que no comprendo e sporque hay tantas diviciones si es el mismo Dios la misma biblia y los humanos hechos a la imagen de Dios y es que la interpertacion que se le da a la biblia es diferente poque muchos no creen en los diez mandamientos dicen que ya estan abolidos..<br>  <br>  la regla de oro para medir la veraddera religion es los diez mandamientos y que tengan la fe de Jesus..|`|E0MdvzyGaa	la neta soy ateo y desde mi punto de vista la religion es una mentira y por desgracia todos emos vivido esa mentira los religiosos o los que se disen religiosos creen pero solo por que les grabaron en sus mentes que tenian que creer y quesino un castigo divino y que el infierno (metieron miedo) <br>  <br>  por eso la gente no save llevar su religion por que en verdad no es algo que ellos crean sino que los icieron creer a la fuersa (no fisica sino sicologica)<br>  <br>  por eso gracias a dios  soy ateo|`|Jx3D3303aa	La congregacion, grupo o asamblea de creyentes (EKLESIA) no te dan la salvacion, te la da el Mesias que murio para comprarnos de la esclavitud del pecado, todo se resumen en "amara a YHWH con todo tu corazon , con toda tu mente y con todas tus fuerzas y amaras a tu projimo como a ti mismo".

Lo cual implica que no es facil serlo en estos tiempos. Cuando uno lo sabe no tiene porque preocuparse y sí de que ocuparse. El que "cree" NO SABE ignora. Porque el Católico no es "Creyente", sino VIVE EL APOSTOLADO, la religión no se vive A LA MANERA DE UNO, o como a uno le conviene. Sino conforme los mandatos de Dios. El que VIVE la fe catolica, se le NOTA , la presencia de Dios  en el Espiritu, en sus actos, en su conducta de vida. , esos que dices que fastidian Creen pero no LO VIVEN  y la religion ES VIDA, amar a Dios es Servirle, y servir es ver en tu progimo (proximo) a Dios."Amaras a Tu Dios, con todo la fuerza de tu corazón, con todo tu ser y con toda tu alma, como a tí mismo...y a tu progimo"  En eso se resume todo. No hay que cree hay que vivirlo, y de tal manera QUE SE TE NOTE, no tenga veguenza, la fe , la religión de cualquier CREDO no te puede dar verguenza  o sino NO SIRVE.

En la naturaleza como una estrategia existe el homosexualismo. Sobre todo en aquellas especies en las que existen machos dominantes. Como la energía sexual es mucha y genera agresividad, para disipar esta energía la homosexualidad es una alternativa. Además en la historia de la humanidad algunas culturas han aceptado ampliamente las prácticas homosexuales de forma natural. <br>  Creo que debiéramos hacer un alto y tratar de evolucionar hacia una sociedad tolerante.|`|eba18a1b89e55f841ba9286bc3838a6eaa	El versículo del Génesis en donde Dios le dice a Adán "Henchid la Tierra y dominadla" y la pretensión de que el ser humano no pertenece al reino animal sino a un reino enormemente superior (más cercano a Dios que al resto de las criaturas) es la causa de la extinción diaria de tantas y tantas especies y del proceso de destrucción del hábitat en que se desarrolla nuestra vida, proceso que está llevando a la humanidad a su desaparición. Es significativo constatar cuánto más hay de irracional y suicida para el género humano en seguir al pie de la letra las indicaciones de la Biblia, un libro escrito desde la ignorancia (ignorancia criminal, en este caso), que la práctica de relaciones sexuales de las llamadas, curiosamente, "contra natura".|`|p67wHTh8aa	He ahí el quid del dilema.

Lo       ¨naturalmente perfecto¨ es la heterosexualidad porque permite la reproducción de las especies. Ahora, si llamas ¨natural¨ a todo aquello en lo que no ha intervenido el hombre y si, la homosexualidad puede ser considerada natural... como tambien lo es el síndrome de down, las malformaciones, la demencia, etc.|`|5cddc10f4f2f7630249783c951cc2e1baa	si  de hecho a algunos los descriminan y la verdad no es justo y si super natural|`|7QbQEwUxaa	quien sostiene que la homosexualidad es antinatural solo busca mantener una status quo idilico de las cosas... ya es hora de que se acostumbren de que los gays estan creciendo como fuerza... y no lo digo porque lo sea sino porque mi novia es bisexual y soy muuuy feliz con ella!<br>  <br>  y por ella conoci a muchas lesbianas que puedo decir que son mas "gente" que muchas otras personas ignorantes<br>  <br>  asi que... no no es antinatural solo es anti ignorantes|`|90304af87efddc6002bf871bd84b7282aa	Yo creo que la naturaleza es mas complicada que lo que el hombre conoce.<br>       Los instintos que tenemos los animales y el hombre son nada mas que un reflejo de una necesidad que el cuerpo manifiesta que tiene que ser saciada.Uno no conoce toda la complejidad del funcionamiento del cuerpo y la psiquis.<br>        Tanto el hombre como los animales tienen no solo la programacion subconciente de "necesidad de producirse" sino tambien "la necesidad de amor y afecto".Esta necesidad de "amor y afecto" tiene mas urgencia que la otra de reproducirse,eso es natural.<br>       Pero como nosotros estamos viviendo en un mundo que creo una complejidad de creencias,mitos y dogmas a cerca de nuestra conducta,como consecuencia de religiones que imponen codigos de conducta,y de leyes que tambien ponen sus prohibiciones.Todo esto que invento el hombre es lo "antinatural".Si alguien no aguanta el frio y tiene instinto de taparse con algo y alguien inventa que es pecado taparse con unas cosas y con otras no,que puede hacer la persona o animal,si no le autorizan ninguna forma legal,tiene que darle prioridad a su instinto.<br>          Tambien quiero hacer mencion de mi hipotesis,mi hipotesis es que el mundo esta llegando a una "superpoblacion" donde la tierra ya no va a tener cupo para tanto ser humano,y eso se nota en los problemas economicos que se tienen en estos tiempos que impiden casarse no mas empieza la necesidad de  actividad sexual,entonces no podemos todos,no tenemos la via libre para hacerlo todo heterosexual.Antes que ese razonamiento hay un subconciente que da los instintos y eso hace que algunos humanos sintamos como que tambien hay personas del mismo sexo que nos atraen mucho pero como tenemos siempre que lidear con dogmas establecidos por sociedades antiguas,ese es el problema.|`|9lB72UhPaa	Las prácticas homosexuales son naturales al 100%.

Y NOSOTROS SOMOS ANIMALES, bastante alejados de los demas por nuestras caracteristicas, pero lo somos. Y en la naturaleza esta la reproduccion, apareamiento de macho y hembra, no de macho y macho, y las hembras no se pueden aparear entre si. <br>  <br>  <br>  A MENOS que dentro de unos a?os los animales seran todos machos, y la proxima revolucion humana sea que no haya macho y hembra, todos seremos iguales de sexo, como las mulas, nada mas que nos podamos aparear,  y tener hijos. ?quien tiene los hijos? cualquiera de los dos, bueno, tendremos muchas modificaciones que haran posible lo que digo. Tal vez sea un paso hacia esa revolucion, acostumbrarse a ser gay. <br>  <br>  <br>  Pero por ahora los gays son ANTINATURALES. Lamentamos mucho para el que es gay y tiene verguenza de esto, pero sepa que puede ser un paso mas hacia la nueva revolucion humana. <br>  <br>  "LA REVOLUCION GAY". o "LA REVOLUCION MULA"<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  saludos!|`|daa06f5a1e50cd8a96b06501dd9ed87aaa	Leí la nota en la dirección que anexas.

Para empezar es de lo mas absurdo creer que una Jirafa macho penetre analmente  a otro macho, es mas, en el reino animal ningún animal macho penetra analmente a otro.

Mientras haya al menos una esperanza de conseguir esta calidad de vida creo que hay que continuar luchando, si no la hay y la persona elige esta opcion pues es su vida y tiene derecho a decidir sobre ella. Los medicos consideran que cumplen con su mision mientras el corazon lata, aunque la persona se encuentre conectada a 3 tubos, una sonda y un respirador y sedada todo el tiempo, me parece inhumano. Algunos argumentan que solo Dios tiene derecho a decidir quien vive o muere, si esto es asi pues los medicos no tendrian tampoco derecho a detener de manera artificial la muerte de nadie. La eutanasia, con una buena evaluacion del caso para evitar abusos por parte de familiares o medicos, me parece completamente aceptable|`|WeRyMLE4aa	Por supuesto que tiene derecho.

Tienen vida nocturna y habitan en cuevas. Comparten estos hábitos los murciélagos, pero ellos se alimentan de frutas y son importantes polinizadores de plantas silvestres. Es por eso que desde la época prehispánica en América existían deidades que usaban la imagen de los vampiros como dioses del inframundo. El mito de los vampiros se desarrolló en Europa a partir de un conde sanguinario que es el Conde Drácula, muy buen guerrero pero demasiado cruel. Estas historias llevaron a la creación del mito de los vampiros, era tan sanguinario que metafóricamente decían que le gustaba beber la sangre de sus víctimas.<br>  Al parecer actualmente existen ritos de magia negra, o de guerreros que se inician como tales, en varios lugares del mundo en los cuales como parte del rito beben sangre, pero no sangre de humanos, sino de animales. No creo que hayan existido nunca los vampiros.

Sin embargo, en la corriente New Age se habla de "vampiros energéticos", que pueden ser personas que te succionan tu energía vital, como aquellas que, supuestamente, se acercan a una planta y la dejan seca, o personas cuya compa?ía te hace sentir incómoda porque te ponen nerviosa o de mal humor, aunque exteriormente parezcan inofensivas. También se habla de que estos "vampiros" pueden ser espíritus de personas muertas que no se han adaptado a su condición de difuntas, o "entidades espirituales" (cualquiera que sea el significado de esto).

El que a ti te parezca que la evolución humana sea la mejor, porque se basa en evolución de la cultura y la tecnología ?quiere decir que sea esta la mejor alternativa para la evolución biológica? De hecho no, al parecer nuestra evolución ha conducido en varias ocasiones al planeta a crisis ecológicas por sobre-explotación de los recursos naturales. Y nosotros en comparación con otras especies solo llevamos unos segundos de evolución. Otras especies de animales presentan mejor adaptación, como las tortugas, cuya forma de vida se ha preservado por miles de milones de a?os. Y a quienes el hombre ha puesto a punto de extinción. El éxito evolutivo de una especie se mide en el número de a?os que ha permanecido en el planeta. En esto, son campeonas las bacterias que llevan sobre la biosfera 3500 millones de a?os, mientras que la especie humana solo lleva 6 o 7millones de a?os.<br>  Como puedes ver, Darwin si tuvo razón. Las especies evolucionan y se adaptan a las condiciones cambiantes de nuestro planeta, sin la intervención de la especie humana.

Ellos siguen conservando sus rasgos porque no ha habido mezcla o mestizaje, además los esqueletos que han tomado han sido de gente con rasgos africanos, tal vez hicieron sus falsas de encontrar en tal lado tal esqueleto y decir que ahí vivió ese hombre, etc., quien dice que no fue un esclavo que al amo ya no le sirvió y lo enterró en su jardín, ahora con tanto avance tecnológico y científico pues que saque ADN de los huesos y recreen a esos humanos.

Yo digo que el CHINO<br>  Porque su cultura es rica en leyendas, en creencias, en artes milenarias, como la pintura, la caligrafía, la medicina. Porque su gente posee una mentalidad pacífica y llena de buen humor. Porque de sus tierras emana la tranquilidad y la belleza. Porque el hablar chino, aunque sólo sea un poco, abre, automáticamente, los corazones de los nativos, ya que comprenden que su idioma es difícil y admiran a aquella persona que intenta hablarlo. Porque es el idioma más hablado en el mundo por número de habitantes (1.300 millones de chinos). Porque ya han empezado a abrirse al resto del mundo. Porque tienen una potencia económica grandiosa. Porque cada vez hay más empresas que tienen tratos con China.

Un día se levantó temprano se despidió de sus amigos, especialmente del burro del vecino, de las bandadas de palomas, del sapo de su huerta y de la caricia de sus 'arbol y se lanzó al camino que ya había trazado en sus sue?os.

Y podría estremecerse igual cuando viera a las mujeres en el mar que cuando veía a Ana disfrutar en el río del pueblo, lucirían tan bellas y atractivas como ella ?serían diferentes? Valía la pena arriesgarse y caminar hasta lograr su sue?o, con tal de sentir en sus pies la diferencia de pisar la hierba o la arena que lame el mar...<br>  Debía intentarlo.

En realidad era sencillo, nunca había seguido sus propios instintos, sus verdaderos ideales, todo lo había dejado pasar por el afán de ser "la mujer perfecta". Por ser aceptada, por ser amada. Y al final, ni una ni otra cosa, esa soledad que solo podìa apagar otro trago de whisky...?Dónde estaba aquélla Laura de anta?o? ?Dónde habìa quedado aquélla Laura feliz?

El canto americano se distingue más por su connotación que por sus características sonoras; en los códices mexicas el cantar es llamado "hablar florido", denotando su relación con la poesía. Es difícil generalizar acerca del sonido de la voz indígena americana. Bernardino de Sahagún (ca. 1550) nos cuenta que el "mal cantor" entre los aztecas es considerado quien "tiene voz hueca, áspera o ronca", en cambio el "buen cantor" canta en tenor, dulcifica y afina su voz, términos que se aplicaban por igual al cantor espa?ol de la época. En los Andes hoy en día se acostumbra que las mujeres canten usando una voz agudísima, y los hombres una muy grave. En el Templo de las Vírgenes del Sol, en Cuzco, había un sector especial llamado Taquiaclla ("música escogida") para ni?as de entre nueve y quince a?os escogidas en todo el imperio por su belleza física y vocal, quienes eran ense?adas a tocar la flauta en los banquetes, matrimonios y festividades de la corte.

Los libros restantes llaman la atención y son vendidos en el mercado *****. parte del código fue adquirido por la Fundación de C.G. Jung, que demostró tener el Evangelio de Tomás.<br>  El Evangelio de Tomás, el Evangelio de la Verdad y el evangelio de los Egipcios, Son mencionados  por los primeros padres de la Iglesia, Clemente de Alejandría, Irineo y Orígenes. casi todos los textos datan de 150 d.C., hay material más antiguo que los 4 evangelios = Nuevo Testamento.<br>  <br>  Judas Tomás o Dídimo era el hermano gemelo de Jesús y Tomás significa gemelo y Dídimo también.<br>  <br>  La religión Católica no acepta los "otros" libros, porque no le convienen, ya que la religión gira en sólo 4 libros o Evangelio que escogió Constantino, desechando casi 600 libros más.<br>  <br>  **En los Papiros de Naj ′Hammadi, contienen numerosos pasajes de que son contrarios a la oxtodoxia, .En un códice que no lleva fecha, el Segundo Tratado del Gran Set, dice que Jesús se libró de morir en la cruz, gracias a una ingeniosa sustitución.<br>  En el siguiente extracto Jesús habla en primera persona:<br>  <br>  No sucumbí ante ellos, como ellos habían planeado...Y no morí en realidad, sino en apariencia, no fuera ser avergonzado por ellos....<br>  Pues mi muerte que ellos creen que sucedió, les sucedió a ellos en su error y ceguera, toda vez que clavaron a su hombre hasta su muerte...Fue otro, su padre, quien bebió la hiel y el vinagre; no fui yo.

En su interior había 12 códices (libros de papiro o manuscritos encuadernados en piel) y algunos autores mencionan 13.  Sin  saber lo importante  del hallazgo, utilizó algunos de éstos papiros para calentar su choza, pero, los restantes códices por alguna causa, fueron descubiertos en poder de éste campesino y  sacados clandestinamente de Egipto. Parte de éste códice fue adquirido por la Fundación C.G.Jung y luego de estudios intensos y de trabas provenientes del Vaticano, se demostró que contenía el evangelio de Tomás (ahora famoso a pesar de que la iglesia se oponía a su difusión)<br>  El evangelio de Tomás había sido mencionado en su época por los historadores y precursores de la iglesiá cristiana:  Clemente de Alejandría, Irineo y Orígenes. Se basan, al parecer, en fuentes de primera mano (no como los otros 4 evangelios hechos a la medida de los intereses del vaticano 400 a?os más tarde) Los evangelios de Tomás no son narrativos,  son dichos atribuídos a Jesús (Joshua Ben Josep) y éste habla en primera persona. Obviamente contienen una fidelidad histórica que los otros evangelios no podían permitirse el lujo de conservar. En uno de los códices llamado "el Segundo Tratado del Gran Set", se habla de Jesús librándose de morir en la cruz porque ideó una sustitución muy ingeniosamente. Se habla, también, de una gran disputa entre Pedro y Magdalena por el liderazgo. Se habla de una cámara nupcial de Jesús y Magdalena. <br>  Como acotación al márgen debo agregar que según los datos históricos, Tomás era hijo de Herodes el Grande y de Mariamme II, cuando los padres se divorciaron el perdió todos los derechos que tenía por nacimiento, y se convirtió así en "otra persona", por eso le llamaban "el mellizo" o Dydimus. En esa época todos tenían varios nombres y, también dependiendo dónde estaban, qué hacían o qué papel interpretaban (es muy interesante el estudio de estas formas antiguas, pero siempre respetando el "tiempo y espacio")<br>  La iglesia reconoce sólo 4 evangelios, que fueron los que ellos mandaron a escribir " a medida" y por sus propios intereses y.... por razones obvias.<br>  El evangelio (o los códices de Tomás) es un dolor muy agudo de estómago que la historia les está causando.<br>  No quieren entender que la historia es implacable, que aunque hayan destruído escritos, bibliotecas enteras, testigos y todo lo que había acerca del Jesús hombre, la historia, los hechos, volverán (como están volviendo) y demostrarán lo que realmente pasó. Y algún día las nuevas generaciones crecerán en un ámbito de veracidad, de historias sin ocultismosy todo será más llevadero.<br>  Gracias por la pregunta, muy interesante!<br>  Saludos desde Argentina|`|trk1lSCXaa	quien es ese-.-.<br>  <br>  disculpa mi igrnocancia

Según la versión de varios historiadores, Moro se fascinó por las narraciones extraordinarias de Américo Vespucio sobre la recién avistada isla de Fernando de Noronha, en 1503. Moro decidió entonces escribir sobre un lugar nuevo y puro donde existiría una sociedad perfecta y socialista.<br>  Moro describe una sociedad organizada racionalmente, a través de la narración de los hechos que realiza un explorador, Rafael Hytlodeo. Utopía es una república que establece la propiedad común de los bienes. No existen los abogados y no envía a sus ciudadanos a la guerra -salvo en casos extremos-, pero contrata mercenarios entre sus vecinos más belicosos. Tal vez Moro se basó en la regla monacal cuando describe la manera en que funciona su sociedad, dado que él era un hombre de Iglesia. Este trabajo fue la inspiración de las reducciones que establecieron los jesuitas para evangelizar al pueblo guaraní.<br>  <br>  Desde entonces, se ha empleado el término Utopía para describir tanto obras de ficción que presentan las ideas de un autor respecto a la manera en que una sociedad se debe organizar mejor, como en comunidades fundadas para poner en práctica tales teorías.<br>  <br>  La utopía puede ser idealista o práctica, pero el concepto ha adquirido una fuerte connotación de perfección optimista, idealista e imposible. La utopía puede ser contrastada con la distopía (antiutopía, pseudoutopía) o con la utopía satírica.|`|502a860354638067fdfc4399da0cc7caaa	Utopía significa en "ningún sitio".  Es el título de una novela o ensayo escrita por Thomas Moro.  es de política ficción, el autor se basó en los relatos que los cronistas de Indias hacían sobre las comunidades indígenas.

Tal vez mi nerviosismo fue normal, ya que había considerablemente más hombres que mujeres. Conforme pasaba el timpo, mientras caminaba sobre la plancha del zócalo para elegir mi piedra, me di cuenta de que ningún hombre me veía de manera libidinosa, te juro por dios que vestida en la calle en un día normal he recibido más miradas que las que recibí hoy en el zócalo, no recibí una sola falta de respeto, todos los hombres súper educados. Todo eso me hizo sentir cómoda poco a poco hasta que dejé de sentirme expuesta. Luego, la foto que fue solo de mujeres no me gustó, ya que la comunicación de las instrucciones fue muy mala y no entendíamos para donde caminar, hasta sentimos que el fotógrafo estaba improvisando. Tampoco me gustó ver a los hombres ya vestidos cuando nosotras seguíamos desnudas, ya que no sabía si eran los participantes o si ya había población civil normal, y me volví a sentir expuesta, además, cuando regresamos ya a vestirnos, la masa de mujeres se empezó a separar y me encontré sola en medio de homberes vestidos, sin embargo, los hombres seguían comportándose respetuosos, lo que me hiso sentir cómoda otra vez. <br>  Arriba los mexicanos que participamos!!! fuimos un ejemplo de educación, respeto y cooperación. <br>  Fue una experiencia muy interesante, como para hacer un estudio antropológico del significado del cuerpo humano, de la ropa y de la desnudez, y de la amenaza de estar siendo observado densnudo y cómo esta amenaza desaparce cuendo estás en el anonimato, me alegro de haber sido parte de esto y aún no termino de asimilar lo que significó para mí esta experiencia.<br>  Yo estudié la cerrera en la Ibero y ahora estudio una maestría en la UNAM.|`|63b455fe07092de88a474c392ba80509aa	hola jose yo soy de guadalajara pero si viviera en df no me hubiera animado nunka a quitarme la ropa pero aqui te mando un link  donde pasan un video de los ventemil asistentes en el zocalo se ve impresionante solo dale click donde diga "Video: Los ángulos del desnudo masivo en el DF" suerte bye<br>  <br>  <a href="http://estadis.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/423260.html" rel="nofollow">http://estadis.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/...</a>|`|unr2wjPNaa	Yo tuve que ir a trabajar !!!   <br>  <br>  :(|`|SDHvDNGJaa	No se, no vivo en el DF...

(Eclesiastés)<br>  <br>  Los amigos de nuestra vida, nos hacen participes del misterio de la pertenencia. <br>  <br>  Somos parte de nuestros amigos, tanto como ellos son parte de nosotros. <br>  <br>  Precisamente, no hay misterio más grande como el de ser una persona, porque cada persona es un misterio; un misterio que no permanece oculto sino que se devela parcialmente y a cada momento: una revelación que no viene revelada a todos, sino solamente a aquellas personas, que vienen consideradas como amigas. <br>  <br>  De tal modo que, en las manifestaciones que cada uno realiza de sí mismo con los propios amigos, se encuentran las verdades que constituyen la propia personalidad. <br>  <br>  El ser concientes de lo que un amigo nos revela, y de lo que nosotros revelamos a un amigo, nos hace reciprocamente petenecientes. <br>  <br>  Las personas son para nosotros personas, y nosotros somos para las personas lo que ellas son para nosotros: perfectos desconocidos. <br>  <br>  Personas de las que no sabemos más, de lo que nos pueda hacer saber su apariencia, es decir su modo de aparecer. <br>  <br>  El diccionario nos dice, que la palabra persona significa:  máscara (personaje), <br>  <br>  Así pues, rescatando el significando filosófico del concepto persona, podemos inferir que una persona extra?a a nosotros deja de serlo, cuando entra en relación con nosotros y, ademas de eso, deja de ser una persona cualquiera, cuando se vuelve amiga nuestra. <br>  <br>  A través de este dinamismo social, cada uno de nosotros se forma y adquiere una personalidad. <br>  <br>  Si queremos saber quiénes somos, por tanto, hemos de ver lo que hacemos. <br>  <br>  Pero si queremos comprobar que somos lo que decimos ser, entonces tenemos que saber lo que nosotros somos para los demás. <br>  <br>  No preguntaremos a cualquier persona, sino a aquellos que nos conocen, ?y quiénes nos pueden conocer mejor como nuestros amigos?...<br>  <br>  Los amigos y las amigas son grandes tesoros, porque en ellos no sólo se encuentra la riqueza de la amistad, sino también la riqueza de conocernos a nosotros mismos. <br>  <br>  Es muy importante tener amigos en la vida y mantenerlos presentes, pertenecientes a nosotros, porque sólo así podemos ser verdaderamente ricos. <br>  <br>  Porque los amigos, además de la riqueza humana que nos donan, nos quieren y nos estiman, y esto representa una gran fuente de “agape” fraternal. <br>  <br>  He conocido a muchas personas, pero hasta ahora pocos amigos, porque un tesoro, no se encuentra todos los días, más no por eso me canso de buscar. <br>  <br>  Quien encuentra un amigo encuentra un tesoro, y yo te he encontrado a Tí...|`|GH7CQKcraa	yo creo que si es un amigo enserio, si tenes algun problema con alguien va a salir a defenderte, si estas mal te va a escuchar y a tratar de ayudarte , cuando no le gusta algo te lo dice, pero a los demas no le habla nunca mal de vos.. igual creo que no existen muchos amigos en serio.|`|aQeOKasUaa	A. fecto<br>  M.erced<br>  I.   ntimo (personal)<br>  S. ignificativo<br>  T. rato<br>  A. poyo<br>  D. esinteres|`|fM0cjjTxaa	Pues como tu a decir verdad muchas veces creo qe los amigos  no existen... y es qe en realidad ninguno de aqellos a los qe considero mis amigos ha sido el "amigo perfecto" para mi.. o el qe todos deseamos qe se yo.. todos por lo menos me han decepcionado una vez.. pero pues nadie es perfecto y supongo qe a varios de ellos los habre decepcionado o molestado en alguna forma.. y tambien creo qe aunqe en realidad no hay un amigo qe sea del todo un amigo, cada qien puede tener un pedazo de ese "amigo real" cuando alguien es capaz de escucharte y entenderte.. cuando sientes qe a alguien puedes hablarle de lo qe sea o qe puedes compartirle algun secreto o qe te preste un hombro para llorar a veces... o alguien qe te defienda de alguien mas etc...creo qe cada persona aunqe sea en una peqe?a caracteristica tiene algo de ese amigo perfecto qe todos qeremos... osea qe todos los qe conoces tienen una pieza de ese amigo ideal y puedes usar esas piezas a tu favor y cuando mas te convenga.. tener al amigo ideal en todos tus "amigos"..|`|7b892a9520eb12228ed7740b10079827aa	Te invito a que veas en la Biblia la descripcion que da de un amigo.Proverbios 18:24 y Proverbios 17:17.Yo te puedo decir que,aunque pocos,tengo amigos como estos y en el mas extenso sentido de la palabra.Saludos|`|OV2Fmu28aa	Las personas que yo tenia como amigos en una etapa de mi vida, la verdad que me fallaron y no me lo esperaba, pero tambien te digo que despues conocí a otra gente y ellos si que me han ayudado a pasar los peores momentos que pasé hace 1 a?o mas o menos, sobre todo una amiga, que ha estado muy pendiente de mi para ayudarme en todo momento, se ha portado de maravilla conmigo y se lo agradezco de todo corazon.|`|OpFhoTR5aa	Un amigo es esa persona o cosa que siempre esta ahí, digo cosa por la peli "El naufrago"(Tom Hans), no importa si lo ves todos los días o hace mucho no lo ves.

TfSkbweCaa	Muy interesante, sin embargo la fe no es lo que todos creen aquí, o bueno la gran mayoría. La fe no es creer sin razonar, al contrario, es creer en algo que es plenamente posible debido a que conoces y tienes la plena seguiridad de esto.<br>  <br>  La palabra “fe” se traduce del griego pí·stis, cuyo significado primario comunica la idea de confianza y firme convicción.<br>  <br>  La Biblia define la fe como “la expectativa segura de las cosas que se esperan, la demostración evidente de realidades aunque no?se contemplen”. (Heb 11:1.) <br>  <br>  La Lógica cuya definicion real es, "ciencia que estudia los pensamientos de acuerdo a sus formas mentales para facilitar un raciocinio correcto y verdadero" no dice que hay las cosas son ENTES, que hay entes reales (los que vemos y palpamos) y entes potenciales.<br>  <br>  La definición de ente potencial me parece muy interesante pues dice: "Es TODO aquello que PUEDE llegar a existir, independientemente de que exista o no en el momento de nombrarlo".<br>  <br>  Como podrás darte cuenta la fe nunca es ilógica, el problema es el conocimiento limitado de quienes no la tienen.|`|136046de1b467fbec94414031277f1b8aa	Exelente frase!!!!<br>  Es algo muy pero muy sierto....<br>  DTB|`|1be66b3b99943c9ade10b8665946e9b4aa	solo un juego de palabras,pero a medias.....el que tiene fe,por mas que le prueben de su error,no lo aceptara por queel prefiere seguir viviendo de esa mentira y no tener la valentia de razonar y cuestionar las cosas que pasan y el que no la tiene ,por supuesto que si le dan una razon puede replantearse todo,pero depende que entiendes por "razon".Si veo que un angel pasa por el cielo y desde el cielo nos muestra la grandeza de Dios  o algo por el estilo,claro que despejaria completamente mis dudas,pero si "razon" llamas a un libro que fue escrito por y para los hombres y con un sinnumero de contradicciones y mandando castigar o a asesinar ante la mas minima desobediencia,pues claro que esa razon no es para nada suficiente....-|`|20298156ded34c2936ac39263287d3f7aa	original juego de palabras|`|8388804c1ae7e71d49317cab58564764aa	Yo creo que es muy real, pero todos relacionan la fe con la religion y no es asi.

En ese sentido es mas abierta una persona razonable que una con fe, el que tiene fe va a desmerecer cualquier prueba rotunda y contundente, el que razona va a cuestionar las cosas irrisorias y ante la falta de sentido y la improbabilidad opta por no creer. <br>  Es logico, siempre fue y siempre sera. El problema es que hay muchos hechos cientificos que desconocemos, al no poder medir la energia que el hombre genera, y no hablo ni de la calorica ni de la electrica, hay muchas cosas relacionadas con la fe que la ciencia jamas va a poder contemplar. Lo mas parecido descubierto hasta ahora es el placebo, que es bacicamente lo mismo que la hipocondria. El cerebro tiene mucho mas poder del que creemos, al punto de poder tener sintomas de enfermedades que no padecemos e incluso morir por esas enfermedades inexistentes en nuestro sistema, de igual manera se ha probado que la gente puede curarse de enfermedades reales sin medicacion, se enga?a al paciente entregandole pastillas inocuas, y el paciente responde favorablemente.<br>  Esto nos demuestra que la mente humana genera mucho mas que impulsos electricos, y que no hubo milagro divino alguno, sino fe, que no es lo mismo. Dios no interviene directamente en nada, todo pasa por una razon explicable y justificable, muchas veces la ciencia no esta a la altura de los hechos y no pueden desifrar lo ocurrido, pero ningun paciente se cura instantaneamente, no hay milagro, hay hechos excepcionales. Las cosas no desaparecen ni aparecen, que no sepamos como sucede no quiere decir que sea magico o milagroso. Si de un hecho "milagroso" no hay pruebas un religioso lo atribulle a un milagro de Dios, una persona razonable sigue investigando, eventualmente llegan a la verdad, demostrando que no fue un hecho milagroso sino una conjuncion de hechos determinados. Esto demuestra que la verdad esta muy lejos de ser descubierta por una persona de fe, porque solo se queda con el hecho, no las razones del hecho en si.<br>  Sin embargo se puede ver a diario que la fe mueve monta?as, que cuando uno esta convencido, realmente cree, sucede, esto no tiene ninguna explicacion logica... hasta ahora.<br>  Escuche una vez que "no existen los milagros, solo hechos cientificamente no comprobados", es decir, todo tiene un porque, se puede ver el paso del tiempo y demostrar que el mundo no se creo en 7 dias, si la biblia dice tantas cosas que se pueden desmentir, si el evangelio de uno dice cosas distintas del evangelio de otro en una misma biblia, con que criterio se puede tomar la biblia como un libro de historia? por algo solo la creen ciegamente los que solo tienen fe, pero no razonan.<br>  Un ni?o cree realmente que Santa Claus existe, y el convencido intentara demostrarlo ense?ando como evidencia los regalos que este le deja, y si eso no te convence, te mostrara entonces el plato de galletas vacia, ese ni?o tiene fe, cree, hasta que un dia se entera de la verdad, que lo que dicen no era cierto, que la aparicion de regalos tenia otra razon, que las galletas podian faltar del plato por otro motivo, ahi es cuando deja de creer ciegamente y aprende que para conocer y saber algo solo se puede a travez de entender el porque.|`|da1cb0f6d34047bf703c486c58b9736caa	???Que respetuosa es la duda!!!<br>  ???Que absoluta es la fe!!! <br>  Me quedo con la primera.

Quieres hallar felicidad, pero te asemejas al hombre que "cree haber perdido su caballo,  se pasa toda la vida buscándolo, y al final descubre que siempre estuvo montado en el" <br>          Chuang Tzu<br>  <br>          Estas habituado a tener la atención dirigida hacia afuera, para percibir con la mente, todo aquello que es exterior a ti. Dejas que la mente interprete cuál es el mundo real. Permites que designe lo que tu eres, según la comparación con las fachadas que fabrican los demás. Es ella quien decide si eres pobre o rico, bonita o fea, bueno o malo, poderoso o miserable, talentoso o bruto.  Y luego pasas la vida anhelando ser aquello que no eres, tener aquello que no posees y sufres enormemente porque no puedes alcanzarlo. <br>  <br>          Cuando construyes tu realidad con la mente, el pensamiento siempre está en movimiento. Viajas al pasado a recorrer una y otra vez aquellos eventos traumáticos donde te quedaste atascado. Repasas el dolor y dramatizas diálogos interminables, de lo que podrías haber hecho y lo que deberías haber dicho. En este proceso pierdes tu salud, tu alegría, y el mundo parece gris y desabrido. <br>  <br>          La mente no sabe vivir el tiempo presente, porque está demasiado ocupada para percibirlo. Si no está rebuscando en los archivos del dolor, estará planeando el futuro dentro de los parámetros de lo que ya has vivido. Ella no tiene posibilidades de aceptar algo diferente a lo que ya conoce, ni tampoco consigue manipular lo que vendrá para complacer tus deseos y apetencias. Los pensamientos proyectados al futuro te paralizaran de miedo, porque se enfrentan con la incertidumbre. Y el miedo es tu peor consejero, recuérdalo. Si lo aceptas como huésped te atraerá precisamente aquello que mas temes. <br>  <br>          Cuando tomas la determinación de ser feliz, solo hay un cambio que debes hacer para lograrlo. Usa tu facultad de atención, y dirígela hacia adentro. Lo primero que trascenderás, será el concepto del tiempo. Te darás cuenta de que el pasado no existe ya y que, para ser libre, debes diluirlo. Que el futuro se sale de tus manos, pues su único elemento fijo es la inseguridad. Es así , porque la eficacia de tu aprendizaje depende ampliamente del hecho de enfrentarte con aquello que ignoras. <br>  <br>          Solo puedes ser feliz en el "aquí y el ahora", que es lo único que es tuyo. <br>  <br>          Ese "aquí y ahora" tienes que vivirlo, no con la mente y sus juicios interminables, sino con la conciencia de tu cuerpo físico y su inteligencia celular. Esto lo consigues, si cultivas la atención enfocada hacia tu interior. Desde allí se te revelara un universo nuevo, espiritual y perfecto. <br>  <br>          El  "aquí y el ahora"   te permite disfrutar del regalo que son tus sentidos, el olfato, la vista, el tacto, el gusto y el oído, que están ahí para realzar la vivencia de las maravillas que te rodean. Cuando la mente interfiera para sabotear tu percepción, vuelve inmediatamente tu atención hacia el cuerpo. Hay dos formas eficientes de lograrlo: puedes hacer consciente tu respiración, o conectarte con los latidos del corazón, tomándote el pulso. <br>  <br>          Permite que el pasado se disipe, con el convencimiento, de que siempre hiciste lo mejor que pudiste. El futuro dejara de amenazarte, si sabes que siempre, estas bajo el cuidado de la provisión divina, que es perfecta. Tu perteneces ahora a la eternidad, que equivale al enfoque consciente en el "aquí y el ahora".

En primer lugar música lenta que introdujera a la paz o a la relajación, después música más alegre para no caer en desánimo (los que no estaban bien) y al final canciones de gozo. De todas maneras esas son técnicas de grupo.

Homo sapiens pertenece a una estirpe de Primates, los hominoideos diferenciada en Asia y en áfrica, de donde surgió la familia de la que forma parte, los homínidos.<br>  <br>  El nombre científico alude al rasgo biológico más característico: sapiens significa sabio o capaz de conocer, y se refiere a la consideración del hombre como ?animal racional?, al contrario que todas las otras especies. Es precisamente la capacidad del ser humano de realizar operaciones conceptuales y simbólicas muy complejas —que incluyen, por ejemplo, el uso de sistemas lingüísticos muy sofisticados, el razonamiento abstracto y las capacidades de introspección y especulación— uno de sus rasgos más destacados. Posiblemente esta complejidad, fundada neurológicamente en un aumento del tama?o del cerebro y sobre todo de su complejidad, sea también una de las causas, a la vez que producto, de las muy complejas estructuras sociales que el ser humano ha desarrollado, y que forman una de las bases de la cultura, entendida biológicamente como la capacidad para transmitir información y hábitos por imitación e instrucción, en vez de por herencia genética. Esta propiedad no es exclusiva de esta especie, y es importante también en otros primates, pero alcanza en H. sapiens un desarrollo cualitativamente distinto, que ha justificado que A. Montagu situara en la cultura el nicho ecológico de nuestra especie.<br>  <br>  <br>  saludos|`|y0y445hXaa	Es un mono en pleno desarrollo humano.

Ademas, Mexico tiene un  indice de pobreza del 33%, es muy elevado para los paises del primer mundo que como mucho llegan a un indice del 15%.<br>  <br>  Todos los paises de Latinoamerica sin excepcion son subdesarollados, mismo si algunos estan mejores que otros o mas cerca del desarollo que otros.|`|3f42250d1d8c6716e4b4dee1ea1de7b0aa	MEXICO ES OPRIMIDO POR USA|`|AA10627619	el subdesarrollo esta en la mente de personas que no quieren desarrollarse.<br>  yo soy una persona desarrollada en todos los aspectos.|`|SDHvDNGJaa	Mas bien es un país estancado en el subdesarrollo, la corrupción y la impunidad!|`|c68d4d46e039facaa198638e82e56bd0aa	subdesarollado quiere decir que esta cerca del desarrollo, entonces no, no es subdesarrollado|`|40b7bdd8478ad8801d7f31ae96703603aa	Quién eres, el hijo de guazón?<br>  Todo es dependiendo del cristal con que se mira!<br>  Si vas a la universidad ICEL, talvez sí sea sub<br>  Si vas al Tec de Monterrey, tal vez no.<br>  Si te compras ropa en la Merced o en el tianguis de los martes en tu colonia, tal vez si.<br>  Si te compras ropa en Perisur o en Santa Fe, tal vez no.<br>  Si te transportas en pesera o en metro, tal vez si.<br>  Si te transportas en un Volvo o un BMW tal vez no.<br>  <br>  Cada quien habla dependiendo de cómo le va en la feria.<br>  <br>  Tú eres subdesarrollado o no?|`|6cd75dadb2da744d487e6ee0b26ef4b9aa	Si, aun nos valemos de  los grandes bloques o naciones  para la existencia de la economia, importaciones, y poco trabajo.<br>  <br>  saludos|`|SD4Zuukaaa	COMO TODOS LOS DE AMERICA LATINA, DEL PRIMER MUNDO NO SON|`|T8YVIMF6aa	Es un país en vías de desarrollo.

d18eb97f6d712713a59d41745ed56da2aa	Los cientificos tienen q pasar por alto la existencia de un Dios, porq Dios no se puede explicar a traves de la ciencia.  Ellos creen, como bn has dicho, la teoria del bigbang y hace poco encontraron una formula q explica lo q ocurrio un segundo antes de q ocurriera el big bang.  El punto es q tambien puedes leer de cientificos creyentes q todavia no descartan la existencia de un Dios, y hacen sus teorias con argumentos cientificos, pero eso no va a ser reconocido por la ciencia, porq Dios no se puede explicar por una formula echa por hombre.  Yo creo en q Dios creo los cielos y la tierra y una forma de explicarlo es lo q los cientificos han encontrado hasta ahora, o me podrias decir donde esta la contradiccion??,  Genesis no es literal, sino un cuento o una forma de explicarle a aquel pueblo una forma entendible para ellos de lo q es la creacion.  Hay q saber interpretarlo.  Y por ultimo, la ciencia confirma lo q la Biblia nos dice.  Lo se porq estudio ciencias.

Porque hacen CIENCIA, no pseudociencia.

Porqué hay que aplicar una lógica diferente al universo que a Dios? <br>  En realidad la ciencia actual acepta que es totalmente posible la creación ex-nihilo del universo, sin necesidad de un creador, mediante procesos puramente naturales.

There was a poll done at Harvard. They took a single gay male, and decided to see at what odds he'd meet someone he actually likes. They first took the population of the city of Cambridge, Mass (101,000 ave.) and cut in in half, assuming only half of them are men. So now we have roughly 50,000 people. <br>  <br>  Then he said he is primarily attracted to white guys, and that he'd be happy if they were within a close age range of five years. 68.1 percent of the people in Cambridge are white, but only half of them are male, so they cut it to 34%. And 34% of 50,000 males is 17,000 people. Then they added that 29% of these 17 people would be married already, leaving 4,930, of which only 21% would be between the ages of 19 and 24, leaving only 1035.3 unmarried, white, male, young adults. Then you factor in that only 14% of them are statistically bisexual or gay, leaving 144.2 people in the entire city of Cambridge, MA that even make potential candidates, not to mention that only 8.3% of those people likely attend Harvard, bringing your final total to 11 people for him to choose from in the whole city, without even factoring in physical appearance or common interests.<br>  <br>  Now of course, this is very mathematical, and leaves little room for compromise, which is usually the only thing that holds a relationship together. However, the purpose for the model is to display the idea that it is MORE than possible that even in a town with 100,000 plus people and three colleges, there is likely only one or two men that any one gay male will get along with, so don't blame this on yourself. I am sure you are a kind, and unique person. From the questions you ask on this site, alone, I would say that you are a thoughtful person, and the fact that you are in high school and have accepted homosexuality into your life obviously shows that you have a clear mind. And you hug everyone who answers you, which is just cute...<br>  <br>  So my guess is, you need to just take the blame off of yourself and let your connections come naturally to you, they will. The odds may be against us all, but, everyone wins one sometime, right?<br>  <br>  P.S., I've always been a fan of "Mow" over meow or woof. It is the sound they used for the French subtitles of My Neighbor Totoro (don't ask me how I know that) and I think it's fairly endearing.|`|iSvDvFneaa	Because us females understand you better and we appreciate you more...<br>  Nah, we do appreciate you lots though : )<br>  <br>  <br>  Maybe you just need to stop looking for that male, he'll come to you when you least expect it.<br>  Maybe he's looking for you, too.<br>  <br>  : )<br>  <br>  Ily Dao.<br>  <br>  MP: Meow. : )<br>  I'd rather hear something cute and gentle instead of loud and startling. <3|`|QVs4ZRx4aa	Venture out of your safe zone a little bit and meet new people.

93y6qc2paa	'straight' acting is probably one of the most offensive terms in the world. as a  GAY man like myself, i don't act straight - because, well, i'm not straight. i'm gay.<br>  <br>  like you.|`|8j7FCEOraa	EVERYone does it.

The first and only girl I dated was more often with women, but she also liked men, and while we were together. So eventhough I could have her, I was very hurt when she wanted to be with a guy. And since then, all the women I have been interested in are pretty much straight. I have tried to figure it out myself, and the only thing i can come up with is having what we can't is attractive to begin with. And also, people tend to idealize who they are interested in, maybe convince yourself that the straight guy you are into has some of the worlds worst habbits that completely repulse you, besides, it could be true!|`|GGf3XRBCaa	As the others have said, don't use the term straight-acting. <br>  <br>  You, like me, are a masculine gay guy who happens to be attracted to masculine guys.<br>  <br>  You need to find out where the masculine gay guys hang out in your area.<br>  <br>  Use places like Gay.com's chat room for your area to ask if there are local gay sports teams, if you're into sports. I play on a gay rugby team with a bunch of masculine gay guys. Even the fans are mostly masculine guys.<br>  <br>  One of my buds plays on a co-ed gay/lesbian softball team and another is in a gay bowling league.<br>  <br>  Find a local gay friendly church, if you are a believer. Sometimes they have group meetings for young and/or single guys.<br>  <br>  If your city/town has a gay paper, call and ask them if they recommend someplace for you to meet other masculine gay men.<br>  <br>  Although I'm not a big fan of country music, I met my last boyfriend at a gay C&W bar. Not all guys who frequent "leather bars" are into leather, but they tend to be masculine. <br>  <br>  You gotta think outside of the box buddy.<br>  We're out here!|`|kclpa0Abaa	Replace 'straight acting' with masculine first off.<br>  <br>  Secondly, there are more straight guys around.

The obvious problem with that is those guys who act straight tend to either be straight, or in the closet. But keep trying there are guys out there for you, you find them.|`|vfjKzvyfaa	we kinda all want what we cant have... its all about feeling that rush of doing something that is considered taboo.

Why have women in some places been satisfied with the same small achievements for millenia?  <br>  If I were to assume that it were true, I wouldn't assume that the difference in orientation meant that gay men didn't have the same incentive that straight men have to impress other people, mates or otherwise.  After all, if a man impresses other men by great achievements, he's likely to impress women as well.  So it wouldn't even be necessary for men to be consciously trying to impress women, and considering our own civilization, it's more likely that men WERE trying to impress other men in historical times, because status-wise, the opinion of men was more important.  <br>  But I suppose if you go farther back, I think you have to admit that we really know virtually nothing about society in those times.  It seems to me, though, that since civilization seems to inevitably involve class-formation, that there would have been almost from the start either an upper class, a headman, whatever, to impress and that the prospect of a better sexual partner might have been part of what was being aimed for but not the only thing and maybe not even consciously. In other words, a better life in general may have been the goal and impressing women directly may not even have been the way to get there.<br>  That holds true even if you consider that the ruler being impressed was a queen, because the goal wouldn't necessarily be to have sex with the queen but to reap whatever benefits accrued from in it.  But I still have this nagging in the back of my mind- why are women in some times and places, including some times and places today, satisfied with very little achievement if this is true?

Albert Einstein trató de desmitificar  esa leyenda toda su vida, pero “una mentira repetida bastantes veces se convierte en verdad” ( coo decia Goebbels, ministro nazi de Propaganda).<br>  <br>  Einstein rara vez hablaba de Dios como algo existente. Cuando lo hacía, se refería, y fué muy explícito al respecto, al Dios de Spinoza, a la Naturaleza como Dios. Rechazó explícitamente un Dios personal o con voluntad, rechazó explícitamente un Dios que premia y castiga, creía que creer en la vida después de la muerte era algo propio de cobardes y egoístas.<br>  Aqui algunas pruebas documentales.<br>  <br>  Palabras de Eisnten<br>  “The World, as I see it” (“Mi Visión del Mundo”):<br>  : “No puedo concebir un Dios que premia y castiga a sus criaturas, o que tiene voluntad, tal como la tenemos nosotros. Tampoco quiero ni puedo concebir que un individuo sobreviva a su muerte física: Dejad a los espíritus débiles atesorar estos pensamientos, movidos por el miedo o absurdo egoísmo.”Original: "I cannot conceive of a God who rewards and punishes his creatures, or has a will of the kind that we experience in ourselves. Neither can I nor would I want to conceive of an individual that survives his physical death; let feeble souls, from fear or absurd egoism, cherish such thoughts."<br>  “Ideas and Opinions” (“Ideas y opiniones”)<br>  Traducción: “El deseo de ser guiado, amado, y apoyado, se expresa en los hombres en su concepción social y moral de Dios... el hombre que está convencido del funcionamiento universal de la ley de la causa no puede entretenerse en la idea de un ser que interfiere en el curso de los acontecimientos... un Dios que premia y castiga no es concebible para él”<br>  Original: “The desire for guidance, love, and support prompts men to form the social or moral conception of God. … The man who is thoroughly convinced of the universal operation of the law of causation cannot for a moment entertain the idea of a being who interferes in the course of events. … A God who rewards and punishes is inconceivable to him …”Traducción: “Durante la infancia de la evolución espiritual humana, la fantasía creo a Dios a la imagen del propio hombre. ... la idea de Dios en el pensamiento religioso es una sublimación del viejo concepto de los dioses. ... en su lucha por el bien ético, los profesores de religión deben tener la estatura de abandonar la doctrina de un Dios personal...”<br>  : 'During the youthful period of mankind's spiritual evolution human fantasy created gods in man's own image. … The idea of God in the religions taught at present is a sublimation of that old concept of the gods. … In their struggle for the ethical good, teachers of religion must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal God … '|`|9fa9eecf52a6ee994f5db31efbcbe48daa	Ambas respuestas son: NO.<br>  <br>  pero para la segunda: No todos los científicos son ateos... pero las estadísticas en EE.UU. revelan que el 70% de ellos, lo es.<br>  <br>  Y para Elpidio: Einstein no era creyente... más bien, era.... sí... ateo, como el mismo lo dice en sus libros.<br>  <br>  "(...)una doctrina que se mantiene no en la luz clara sino en la oscuridad, que ya ha causado un da?o incalculable al progreso humano, necesariamente perderá su efecto en la humanidad. En su lucha por el bien ético, las personas religiosas deberían renunciar a la doctrina de la existencia de Dios, esto es, renunciar a la fuente del miedo y la esperanza(...)" (Albert  Einstein, Mis Creencias, Página 30)<br>  <br>  "Era, por supuesto, una mentira lo que usted leyó acerca de mis convicciones religiosas, una mentira que está siendo repetida sistemáticamente. No creo en un Dios personal y nunca he negado esto (Albert Einstein: el lado humano p.38)<br>  <br>  "Durante la etapa primitiva de la evolución espiritual del género humano, la fantasía de los hombres creó dioses a su propia imagen que con su voluntad parecían determinar el mundo de los fenómenos, o que hasta cierto punto influían en él. El hombre intentaba atraerse la voluntad de estos dioses en su favor a través de la magia y la oración. La idea de Dios de las religiones que se ense?a hoy es una sublimación de ese antiguo concepto de los dioses."

En qué pasaje se menciona al infierno?<br>  PARA VOS FLORes:<br>  Algunos comentaristas se han referido a determinados contextos en los que aparece la palabra “tormento” en la Biblia para apoyar la ense?anza de sufrimiento eterno con fuego. Sin embargo,, hay razón bíblica para creer que lo que se dice en Revelación 20:10 no?tiene ese sentido. De hecho, el versículo?14 muestra que el “lago de fuego”, donde tiene lugar el tormento, significa realmente “la muerte segunda”. Por otra parte, aunque Jesús habló de cierto hombre que era rico y que “existía en tormentos” (Lu 16:23,?28),   muestra que Jesús estaba presentando una ilustración, no?refiriéndose a una experiencia física de una persona real. En el libro de Revelación se usa varias veces la palabra “tormento” con un sentido claramente ilustrativo o simbólico, según puede verse por el contexto. (Rev 9:5; 11:10; 18:7,?10.)|`|417798750a0536d22a139a54642ffd54aa	En tan poco tiempo no podría cambiar nada,viviría lo que me queda de la mejor manera,nada más.|`|d24daca95606d5904c083e16db47527faa	Según lo que dice la Fe Cristiana me arrepentiría de mis pecados, y encomendaria mi alma a Dios.<br>  <br>  Que Dios te Bendiga|`|5ea8936bf2e3056f5b1bbb8a5f53b3c8aa	Lo siento, no creo en ese concepto de infierno...|`|85a767b335aa5827d84449e808b17f3aaa	Disfrutaría todos los placeres que puediese en tan corto tiempo, con la saludable seguridad de que el infierno es un cuento para asustar a los ni?os.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  .|`|SDHvDNGJaa	No creo en el infierno.

fp57eYZaaa	It could be one of three things. The first is that she doesn't share your feelings. Sometimes straight women flirt with other women who they know or suspect or are lesbian or bi for fun but they aren't interested in taking it any further. Another possibility is that she IS interested in you and felt jealous when she saw you speaking to her friend a lot, or maybe when she saw you speaking to her friend, she thought you were just a flirt and resents you for that. The last thing I can think of based on the information given is that she's interested in you but not yet ready to act on her same sex feelings.<br>  <br>  The only way to know for sure is to ask her. Let her know that you miss talking to her and feel hurt that she's been cold to you lately, and tell her you want to know if you've said or done something that's causing her to treat you that way. Hopefully you can at least get your friendship back by talking things out. Once the friendship is back on track again, you can subtly find out if she's interested in women and, if she is, whether shes looking for a girlfriend. If she is, then you can let her know how you feel about her. ;)|`|i9BgSAMjaa	maybe she is not interested or not bi like u

Is he religious?  If he's religious then maybe he just doesn't want to get into that kind of relationship at all.  Although gay is a possibility, you shouldn't assume that until you have solid proof, like email conversations or websites that he's visited or at least something.  I don't think the fact that he likes to be dressed well and watches the Bachelor are good enough to call him gay.  At least the Bachelor is about guys meeting girls...|`|Y63zyLZyaa	He's your ex....why in the world would you care?<br>  But to answer your question, chances are he is gay or bi. My friend always swears he's not gay, hes BI. Apparently there is a difference *shrugs*.<br>  <br>  Or he could be a girls guy. Like, girls are girly-girls and guys have guy-guys. Then we have Tom-boys and they have.....uh......Tina-girls or something. I don't know what its called. <br>  <br>  *shakes of subject* It doesn't matter though. If he's gay or bi or whatever, that's his problem, not yours.|`|Dx8eudXfaa	To answer the question "How can you really tell?" well, you can't. You can only be supportive and open minded, and let him tell you if he wants to. If he is gay, even.

Sex breaks that tension and allows it to be released.  I think our society helps make sex so good with all the sensorship.  It makes it "bad".  So now we are more willing to want to break the rules and along with breaking the rules, we get excited, aroused, and have loads of fun doing it.  Even at about 30, I'm still loving it.|`|rCWc7m3Iaa	it only hurts for girls if youre a virgin,<br>  it has to do with your hymen, which is.. well... a kind of stretch of skin around the opening of your vagina, which is what will break when you have sex<br>  once you get past the first two minutes of sex, it will be very pleasurable.|`|pmatCUrtaa	First times for girls I've heard can hurt. It all depends on the guy. If its 'big' then it could be more likely to hurt to be honest. Thats when it might pay to be a little smaller because its actually easier to work with.

Depends I guess.<br>  <br>  Ppl have sex because it feels good. It feels good because we evolved/God made us (take your pick) so we would enjoy sex b/c that way we would do it more and carry on the species. <br>  <br>  Well of course they're eager in the movies THEY'RE MOVIES!!

5FgbflNiaa	JamesH: the lesbian and gay category isn't against homosexuality-Christians are. So of course this would be the place to ask, and by asking for any real reasoning other than a quote, it may make some think about the real reasons they are against it. Not for any logical reason, but because their book tells them to. Any book that creates and spreads hatred against any group of people is wrong. Just wrong.<br>  <br>  Edit: TJ, if you change 'homosexuality' into 'christian' in your statement, you'll know what non-christians go through. Rather hypocritical to assume it's okay to shove an unwanted religion down someone's throat but homosexuals looking for equality are 'unnatural.'|`|zPfgFXU5aa	How many non religious reasons do you need?<br>  <br>  Apart from religious texts, most people instinctively know that homosexuality is wrong and are disgusted by the excesses of the gay community - cruising, drugs, higher rate of sexual fetishism.<br>  <br>  Most people also know without needing to read a religious book that bestiality, necrophilia and various other sexual perversions are also unhealthy choices that should be discouraged.<br>  <br>  Scientifically, Homosexuals are living a lifestyle in conflict with the biological laws of their design.  When you eat pudding with a shovel or dig a ditch with a spoon, you are using objects contrary to their design, and harm will certainly result.  <br>  <br>  Homosexuals bring destruction to themselves and others.  You do not need to read the Bible to know homosexual intercourse is perverse, you just need to know what your penis is for!!!  Urination and copulation.  <br>  <br>  The penis was not designed to be shoved up another man’s rectum.  The rectum was not designed for penile penetration, a fist, a bottle, a gerbil... The tongue was not designed for the anus, urine for the mouth, etc. <br>  <br>  (all of the above perverse acts admitted to by a majority of homosexuals in scientific surveys).  <br>  <br>  From a Medical point of view AIDS kills over 30,000 Americans yearly.  65% of those fatal cases are sexually transmitted (mostly homosexuals).  Almost all of the others got it through shooting drugs with a sex pervert or receiving a blood transfusion contaminated by a sex pervert. <br>  <br>   <br>  Homosexual activity produces an increased health risk to society. As a society we have the duty to campaign against behaviors that destroy individual lives and the lives of others. <br>  <br>  The Gay Report (homosexual researchers) surveyed the sexual habits of homosexuals and discovered that 99% had engaged in oral sex; 91% had engaged in anal intercourse; 83% engaged in rimming (mouth to anus contact); 22% had fisted their sex partners; 23% admitted to golden showers (urinating on a sex partner); 76% admitted to group or public sex; 4% admitted ingesting feces. <br>  <br>  These behaviors are breeding grounds for a whole variety of serious intestinal parasites, viruses, and bacteria known collectively as 'Gay Bowel Syndrome.' In addition to these intestinal diseases, homosexual males are also at high risk for anal cancer. Dr. Stephen E. Goldstone, the medical director of Gay Health.com says that 68% of HIV-positive and 45% of HIV-negative homosexual men have abnormal or precancerous anal cells.<br>  <br>  Homosexuality is therefore considered by medical professionals to be a “high-risk” sexual activity and, in addition to AIDS, homosexuals are prone to catch hepatitus A, hepatitus B, herpes, gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis, intestinal parasites, tuberculosis, and a host of other contagious diseases.  <br>  <br>  <br>  The theory of evolution also argues against homosexuality as well. In a world where only the fit survive to pass their genotypes on to the next generation, homosexuals are doomed to rapid extinction.|`|FhHklqkhaa	so homosexuality is unnatural? this is already repeatedly disproven by the fact that it happens plus animals exhibit homosexual behavior.<br>  many heteros can\'t reproduce either yet no-one lies that they are unnatural<br>  jeffd_57 rant has no links and is based on stereotyped lies like that everyone's the same, he uses bestiality and necrophilia to falsely demonise LBG people, <br>  religion is the main reason people are homophobic<br>  having an opinion doesn't mean you are above criticism<br>  some are also trying to split hairs as to why they aren't homophobic which is another sadly predictable tactic|`|3xmQz1TTaa	D'you know what?<br>  <br>  There was a recent study done where sexual arousal was monitored while groups of people were shown different types of porn.<br>  <br>  Guess what those who are militantly homophobic were mainly turned on by?

Fifty years ago, the same sorts of people were fighting against interracial marriages, claiming society would collapse if they happened.|`|cdAMxxMQaa	I think most homophobic thoughts originate from biology class.  Everyone know the combination of the XX gene and the XY gene make a person.  We learned the visual symbols for male and female as children.  We always knew there was a mommy and a daddy, a male and a female.  I think most people who frown upon homosexual relationships have never felt any type of attraction to the same sex.  Because they have never felt it, they begin to question it because they don't understand.  They get angry as a result of not understanding.  Humans attack what they don't understand,|`|9GGoCCSNaa	I have nothing against two gay people loving each other. I am against marriage, (which I think this question is about). I am against special legislation (ie. that which only benefits 10% or less of the population.). And it is just my opinion, with what I have seen and experienced in life, I formed an opinion. So, I can change that opinion if I see reason to, but at the moment it stands as is. And my religion has little to do with this opinion.|`|AL6okJ0Saa	Iron, some of these people are nuts!!!!!<br>  <br>  Did you see how long JP-whatever's answer was?

I have a right to believe what I wish just like you.Can you prove why two homosexuals should be together?

LrMEWvkCaa	Pues fijate que soy puertorrique?o y aunque no he visitado Mexico te puedo dar una contestación de corazón a esa pregunta.El hecho de que un pueblo,en este caso la nación mexicana se sientan sumamente orgullosos y felices de ser mexicanos no quiere decir que no quieran interactuar con otras culturas y mucho menos entorpecer el desarrollo de su cultura.<br>     Te digo esto porque en todo pais existe gente con más educación que otras.Existen diferentes grupos y escalas <br>   sociales.Lo cuál propicia que existan grupos que cada nación se?ale  como grupos marginados que no quieren progresar ni desarrollarse.Que son fanaticos de unas creencias y que no pueden entender ni aceptar nada más.<br>    Tienes que comprender que la ignorancia es el peor componente de cualquier nación o país.Además en estudios de la sociología de la familia se ha comprobado que la mentalidad del indio originario de America.(todos).Era una mentalidad grupal.Por esa razón los espa?oles acabaron con muchas culturas indias ,porque cuando le mataban el jefe no sabian que hacer.<br>    Eso ocurrio con el taino en P.R. y el caribe,con el indio norteamericano,suramericano y el centroamericano.Si vez en los medios que muchos son los grupos que existen en toda America y que se dejan llevar por lideres que no quieren salir de su mundo y su cultura ,y que a su vez controlan y manipulan a la gente que les rodea y que tambien son ignorantes.<br>    Por otra parte te quiero decir que me encanta la cultura mexicana y que tengo en planes visitar la plaza garibaldi, para cantar musica ranchera mexicana que es mi favorita.

Pero si no te diriges a hacer lo bueno, hay pecado agazapado a la entrada, y su deseo vehemente es por ti; y tú, por tu parte, ?lograrás el dominio sobre él?".<br>  <br>  Caín se hizo cultivador del suelo, y "al cabo de algún tiempo", tanto él como Abel, su hermano más joven, le presentaron ofrendas a Jehová, pues sintieron la necesidad de ganarse el favor divino. Sin embargo, Dios "no miraba con ningún favor" la ofrenda de Caín, compuesta de "algunos frutos del suelo". (Gé 4:2-5;) Aunque se ha se?alado que el registro no especifica que la ofrenda de Caín fuese de los frutos más selectos, mientras que sí dice que la de Abel era de los "primogénitos de su reba?o, aun sus trozos grasos", el problema no radicaba en la calidad de los productos que Caín ofreció. Más bien, como se registra en Hebreos 11:4, la ofrenda de Caín carecía de la motivación de la fe, que fue lo que hizo aceptable el sacrificio de Abel. El que Dios no viera la ofrenda de Caín con favor pudo haberse debido también a que era incruenta, mientras que la de Abel representaba una vida derramada.<br>  <br>  No se especifica cómo se hizo la distinción entre la ofrenda aprobada y la que no lo era, pero debió ser evidente tanto para Caín como para Abel. Jehová, que lee el corazón del hombre (1Sa 16:7. 7 Pero Jehová dijo a Samuel: "No mires su apariencia ni lo alto de su estatura, porque lo he rechazado. Porque no de la manera como el hombre ve [es como Dios ve], porque el simple hombre ve lo que aparece a los ojos; pero en cuanto a Jehová, él ve lo que es el corazón". ;ver tambien Sl 139:1-6), conocía la actitud incorrecta de Caín, que se manifestó con claridad una vez fue rechazado su sacrificio. Entonces empezó a mostrar abiertamente las "obras de la carne", entre ellas, 'enemistades, contiendas, celos y arrebatos de cólera'. (Gál 5:19, 20.) Jehová mostró a este hombre resentido que podía ensalzarse si sencillamente se dirigía a hacer lo bueno. Pudo haberse humillado y haber imitado el ejemplo aprobado de su hermano, pero prefirió pasar por alto el consejo divino de lograr dominar el deseo pecaminoso que 'estaba agazapado a la entrada' deseando con vehemencia someterle. (Gé 4:6, 7; compárese con Snt 1:14, 15.) Este proceder irrespetuoso fue la "senda de Caín".

Una informacióm mas completa sobre el tema te servirá para ver la diferencia.<br>  Ofrezcamos sacrificios aceptables a Jehová<br>  <br>  EN UN tiempo de la historia pudo observarse un notable fenómeno en la entrada oriental del jardín de Edén. Unos poderosos querubines montaban guardia ante ella y su amenazante presencia dejaba claro que nadie debía atreverse a pasar. Igualmente disuasoria era la hoja llameante de una espada que daba vueltas, y el sobrecogedor resplandor que debía reflejarse de noche en los árboles circundantes (Génesis 3:24). Cualquier observador se mantendría a una distancia prudencial, por muy intrigado que estuviera.<br>  <br>  Es posible que Caín y Abel visitaran muchas veces el lugar. Puesto que nacieron fuera del jardín, solo podían especular sobre la experiencia de la que disfrutaron sus padres: vivir en el Paraíso, con su exuberante vegetación y abundantes frutas y hortalizas. Lo poco que entonces pudieran ver de Edén parecería inculto y abandonado.<br>  <br>  Adán y Eva seguramente explicaron a sus hijos por qué se hallaba descuidado el jardín y por qué se les expulsó de él (Génesis 2:17; 3:6, 23). ?Qué frustración para Caín y Abel! Podían ver el jardín, pero no?podían entrar en él. Estaban tan cerca del Paraíso, y al mismo tiempo tan lejos. La imperfección los había marcado y poco podían hacer al respecto.<br>  <br>  La relación que había entre sus padres seguramente no?ayudó a mejorar la situación. Dios dijo al sentenciar a Eva: “Tu deseo vehemente será por tu esposo, y él te dominará” (Génesis 3:16). A partir de entonces, según esa profecía, Adán debió dominar a su esposa y quizá no?la trató ya como su compa?era y ayudante. Y Eva parecía depender excesivamente de su marido. Un comentario bíblico incluso define su “deseo vehemente” como “un ansia casi enfermiza”.<br>  <br>  La Biblia no?dice qué incidencia tuvo la situación conyugal de Adán y Eva en el respeto que sus hijos sentían por ellos. Pero es evidente que el ejemplo de Adán y Eva tuvo un efecto desestabilizador en sus hijos.<br>  <br>  Escogen caminos diferentes<br>  <br>  Con el tiempo, Abel se hizo pastor y Caín labrador (Génesis 4:2). Abel debió tener mucho tiempo, mientras atendía a sus reba?os, para reflexionar sobre la singular profecía que Dios pronunció antes de expulsar a sus padres de Edén: “Pondré enemistad entre ti y la mujer, y entre tu descendencia y la descendencia de ella. él te magullará en la cabeza y tú le magullarás en el talón” (Génesis 3:15). Puede que se preguntara: “?Cómo se cumplirá la promesa de Dios con respecto a una descendencia que aplastará a la serpiente, y cómo se magullará a esa descendencia en el talón?”.<br>  <br>  Al cabo de un tiempo, Caín y Abel, probablemente ya adultos, presentaron cada uno una ofrenda a Jehová. Como Abel era pastor, no?sorprende que ofreciera “algunos primogénitos de su reba?o, aun sus trozos grasos”. Por el contrario, Caín ofreció “algunos frutos del suelo”. Jehová aceptó el sacrificio de Abel, pero “no?[miró] con ningún favor a Caín ni?su ofrenda” (Génesis 4:3-5). ?Por qué?no?<br>  <br>  Se ha apuntado al hecho de que Abel sacrificó “primogénitos de su reba?o”, mientras que Caín solo ofreció “algunos frutos del suelo”. Pero el problema no?radicaba en la calidad de la ofrenda de Caín, pues el relato dice que Jehová miró “con favor a Abel” y no?“a Caín ni?su ofrenda”. De modo que Jehová se fijó primero en la condición de corazón de cada uno. ?Qué percibió? Hebreos 11:4 dice que Abel ofreció su sacrificio “por fe”. De modo que a Caín posiblemente le faltaba la fe que hizo aceptable el sacrificio de Abel.<br>  <br>  A este respecto, cabe mencionar que la ofrenda de Abel requirió derramamiento de sangre. Es posible que Abel llegara a la conclusión de que la promesa de Dios sobre una descendencia a la que se magullaría en el talón, implicaría el sacrificio de una vida. En ese caso la ofrenda de Abel constituyó una súplica de expiación, y una expresión de fe en que Dios suministraría al debido tiempo un sacrificio propiciatorio por los pecados.<br>  <br>  Por el contrario, puede que Caín pensara poco en la ofrenda que iba a presentar. “Su ofrenda era un mero reconocimiento de que Dios era un benefactor —interpreta un comentarista bíblico del siglo?XIX—. Mostró claramente que no?creía que hubiera ninguna brecha entre él y su Creador, ni?ninguna necesidad de confesión de pecado ni?de expiación.”<br>  <br>  Además, como primogénito, puede que Caín supusiera presuntuosamente que él era la descendencia prometida que destruiría a la serpiente, Satanás. Quizá Eva también albergara esas aspiraciones ambiciosas para su hijo primogénito (Génesis 4:1). Por supuesto, si eso es lo que Caín y Eva esperaban, estaban muy equivocados.<br>  <br>  La Biblia no?dice cómo indicó Jehová que aprobaba el sacrificio de Abel. Se ha dicho que quizá lo consumió fuego procedente del cielo. En cualquier caso, cuando Caín se dio cuenta de que se rechazaba su ofrenda, “se enardeció de gran cólera, y empezó a decaérsele el semblante” (Génesis 4:5). Iba camino de un fin calamitoso.<br>  <br>  El consejo de Jehová y la respuesta de Caín<br>  <br>  Jehová razonó con Caín. “?Por qué estás enardecido de cólera, y por qué se te ha decaído el semblante?”, le preguntó. Así se le dio a Caín la oportunidad de examinar sus sentimientos y motivos. “Si te diriges a hacer lo bueno —continuó Jehová—, ?no?habrá ensalzamiento? Pero si no?te diriges a hacer lo bueno, hay pecado agazapado a la entrada, y su deseo vehemente es por ti; y tú, por tu parte, ?lograrás el dominio sobre él?” (Génesis 4:6,?7.) (Véase el recuadro de la página?23.)<br>  <br>  Caín no?escuchó; se llevó a Abel a un campo y lo asesinó. Posteriormente, cuando Jehová le preguntó dónde estaba Abel, agravó su pecado con una mentira. “No?sé —replicó—. ?Soy yo el guardián de mi hermano?” (Génesis 4:8,?9.)<br>  <br>  Caín no?quiso ‘dirigirse a hacer lo bueno’, ni?antes ni?después del asesinato de Abel. Permitió que el pecado lograra el dominio sobre él, y por ello se le desterró del territorio donde vivía la familia humana. Se estableció una “se?al”, quizá solo un decreto solemne, para que nadie vengara la sangre de Abel matando a Caín (Génesis 4:15).<br>  <br>  Caín edificó luego una ciudad y le puso el nombre de su hijo. No?extra?a que a sus descendientes se les conociera por su violencia. Con el tiempo, la línea de Caín llegó a su fin cuando el Diluvio de los días de Noé barrió a todos los injustos (Génesis 4:17-24; 7:21-24).<br>  <br>  El relato bíblico de Caín y Abel no?se conservó solo para nuestro entretenimiento, sino que se ‘escribió para nuestra instrucción’ y es “[provechoso] para ense?ar, para censurar” (Romanos 15:4; 2?Timoteo 3:16). ?Qué aprendemos de este relato?<br>  <br>  Una lección para nosotros<br>  <br>  A todos los cristianos se les invita hoy a ofrecer, como Caín y Abel, un sacrificio a Dios: no?una ofrenda quemada literal, sino un “sacrificio de alabanza, es decir, el fruto de labios que hacen declaración pública de su nombre” (Hebreos 13:15). Actualmente, los testigos de Jehová están cumpliendo estas palabras a escala mundial al predicar las buenas nuevas del Reino de Dios en más de doscientos treinta países (Mateo 24:14). ?Estamos participando en esa obra? Entonces podemos estar seguros de que ‘Dios no?es injusto para olvidar nuestra obra y el amor que mostramos para con su nombre’ (Hebreos 6:10).<br>  <br>  Tal como en el caso de las ofrendas de Caín y Abel, no?se juzga nuestro sacrificio por su apariencia exterior, por ejemplo, solo por el número de horas que pasamos en el ministerio. La visión de Jehová penetra más. Jeremías 17:10 dice que él ‘escudri?a el corazón’ e incluso ‘examina los ri?ones’, es decir, los pensamientos, sentimientos y motivaciones más profundos de la personalidad. De modo que lo que cuenta es la motivación, no?la cantidad. En realidad, Dios valora el sacrificio, sea este grande o peque?o, cuando se ofrece con un corazón motivado por el amor (compárese Marcos 12:41-44 con 14:3-9).<br>  <br>  Al mismo tiempo, debemos ser conscientes de que Jehová no?aceptará sacrificios cojos, como no?aceptó la ofrenda que Caín presentó con desgana (Malaquías 1:8, 13). Jehová quiere que le demos lo mejor, que le sirvamos con todo nuestro corazón, alma, mente y fuerzas (Marcos 12:30). ?Lo estamos haciendo? Entonces podemos estar satisfechos con nuestro sacrificio. Pablo escribió: “Que cada uno pruebe lo que su propia obra es, y entonces tendrá causa para alborozarse respecto de sí mismo solo, y no?en comparación con la otra persona” (Gálatas 6:4).<br>  <br>  Caín y Abel tuvieron la misma educación. Pero el tiempo y las circunstancias dieron a cada uno la oportunidad de desarrollar sus propias características. La envidia, la rivalidad y los arrebatos de cólera fueron conformando la actitud de Caín.<br>  <br>  En cambio, Dios recuerda a Abel como un hombre justo (Mateo 23:35). Su determinación de agradar a Dios a toda costa diferenció a Abel de su ingrata familia: Adán, Eva y Caín. La Biblia dice que aunque Abel murió, “todavía habla”. Su fiel servicio a Dios es parte del relato histórico permanente de la Biblia. Que todos sigamos el ejemplo de Abel ofreciendo continuamente sacrificios aceptables a Dios (Hebreos 11:4).|`|db4dd2dff9e0c75c0e72e4d079fd560faa	por que abel fué el primer gay y cain al darse cuenta lo mató<br>  de otra manera no habriamos nacidos todos, ya vez que luego caín tuvo relaciones con eva para tener mas hijos y mas hijas, luego adán con las nietas y cain con las hijas, de esas generaciones venimos, tal vez abel tuvo algunos hijos   con eva pero eran pu?ales, hidrocanoicos, se le iba la cochina al monte, cacha granizos, recoge piedritas, de abel viene la descendencia de las lesvianas y homosexuales|`|jAE1viDRaa	Porque Dios sabia que Cain tenia envidia en su corazon.<br>  Porque el los conocia desde ni?o, no era la ofrenda ofrecida, era el sentimiento con que se entregaba dicha ofrenda.|`|6QREuMawaa	A lo mejor porque Abel lo hacia sinceramente, no por el hecho de quedar bien ante Dios.....|`|1LoQNjKqaa	es mas profundo pero de forma simple se resume que abel lo asía como un deber que el tenia y lo asía con gozo y alegría.<br>  en el caso de caín cumplió pero solo por obligación y Dios y dios quiere que la gente este de su lado por voluntad no por cumplir.|`|0a8a6705c38f3c2d79ea2d530ad6b705aa	Porque hay que recordar que las diferentes narraciones bíblicas están escritas en distintos géneros literarios: cuento, poesía, etc. y que el lenguaje es simbólico en muchos casos.

Ese sacrifico fue Jesucristo, por eso cuando Juan el bautista lo vio dijo de el: "He aqui el cordero de Dios que quita los pecados del mundo".

Primero no aceptes el hecho de que vas a morir porque un médico lo dijo y no quiero decir con esto que ignores el hecho porque eso es una estupidez, alo que me refiero es que si es pronto o no eso no lo sabe nadie. Dice una homeópata que conozco que el mayor problema al que se enfrenta cuando tiene un paciente con una nfermedad de las que conocemos como incurables es al diagn′stico en si y no a la enfermedad, es decir, cuando le dan al paciente eldiagnóstico de la enfermedad, entonces este lo toma como una sentencia de muerte y deja de luchar y se deja morir, esta misma doctora me contó que a su padre le diagnosicaron u n cancer en fase terminal y que ella se encargo de que el no lo supiera, lo estubo tratando y lo mantubo bien por muchos a?os hasta que en una ocasión en unos estudios que se tuvo que hacer una enfermera cometió la indiscreción de decirselo y a partir de ese momento su padre se dejó morir y ya no duró mucho tiempo. Como ves nada está escrito, ignoro que enfermedad padeces ni cual sea la esperanza de vida que te dieron, pero piensa que nadie sabe cuando es el momento lo que si puedes elegir es como vivirlo, preparte como deberimos hacer todos para cuando ese  momento llegue. Hay una página de internet que se llama www.greatlifeintl.com que tiene un producto que se llama vidacel, ahí viene oda la explicación de como funciona, es un suplemento alimenticio que va directo a tus celulas y parece ser que por su composisión lasalimeta de tal manera que ayuda a su regeneración y ayuda al cuerpo a sanar, no te puedo decir que ta efectiva sea, yo se lo estoy dando a mi hija que fue diagnosticada con dabetes tipo I (diabetes infantil) y requiere inyectarse insulina varias veces al día y llevamos poco pero lo que si te puedo decir es que tuve hace poco visitas en casa y contagiaron a todos de una gripa terrible de fiebres muy altas y mucho malestar y los únicos que no enfermaron fueron dos de mis hijos que la están tomando, chécala tu mismo la puedes comprar por internet, te dejo mi correo por si se te ofrece algo, digo, igual y te sirve, no dejes de buscar opcones, tambien está el noni o el xango que es un jugo de una fruta que se llama mangostan y que dicen que hace maravillas no se mucho acerca de ellos pero estoy segura que en internet puedes encontrar algo. Lo único que si te puedo recomendar es que vivas tu vida al máximo, nadie sabe cunto tiempo le queda, ni tu y la muerte solo es un cambio que algún día va a llegar inevitablemente y para todos. eugenia_maria58@yahoo.com.mx|`|81d1bcf1d5d053f2e2ae51cbe4015229aa	Qué pena lo que estás pasando.<br>  <br>  Pero mientras tengas vida, lucha!!!!!

8e25bf9817dc255b5c730a94ceb10edeaa	???EXCELENTE!!!. Estoy completamente de acuerdo que se legalice el aborto, así se evitarán los hijos no deseados , quienes al captar que no son deseados adquieren enfermedades mentales debido al rechazo de sus progenitores. Por otra parte, la economía de familias numerosas es bastante pobre. <br>  Se dice que el alma ingresa al cuerpo del recién nacido con el primer aliento de vida (por eso el médico le da unas palmaditas al bebé para que reaccione al cambio de ambiente, inhalando su primera bocanada de aire, ingresando además junto al alma, la memoria total de todas las encarnaciones pasadas de esa alma); y recién  pasa a ser un ser humano, capaz de pensar; antes sólo era materia viviente que acumulaba información , contando sólo con la básica inteligencia celular, como lo son los órganos, los cabellos, etc. Así que hacerse un aborto es equivalente a extirparse un órgano extra que va a tener que salir del organismo de la mujer, de todas maneras, tarde o temprano. <br>  El plan de la iglesia católica fue, que al prohibir el aborto tendrán más católicos , ya que cada familia católica estará temerosa de abortar. En el Segundo Concilio de Constantinopla, en el a?o 553 , acordó la iglesia católica abolir las doctrinas de las encarnaciones sucesivas del alma en la Tierra y del Karma, o ley de causa y efecto, por considerar que no eran convenientes a los intereses materiales y de poder de la iglesia católica romana sobre la gente; agregando a cambio "el cielo" y "el infierno", para mantener sometidas a las personas, así el sacerdote interecedería con Dios por el alma de cada persona al morir ésta , para que su alma se vaya al cielo si le daban a la iglesia católica su herencia o parte de ella, y además , mientras viva deberá hacer todo lo que la iglesia le aconseje, de lo contrario esa alma se iría al infierno.<br>  Sucede que el alma encarna en la Tierra para evolucionar, y sólo lo puede hacer mientras está encarnada en un cuerpo material, porque éste le permite sentir y tener todo tipo de experiencias terrenas necesarias a su evolución.<br>  Se dan a veces los casos en que ningúna alma va a encarnar en determinado cuerpo , porque con ese cuerpo no podrían evolucionar todos los aspectos que requeiren, así que el cuerpo nace muerto.|`|43e2c5b246409e7a2f4a6cc3c425f2eaaa	Mira yo si fuero alguien del gobierno lo aprovaria, nadie sabe lo que la persona haya pasado para querer abortar, ahora muy en mi punto de vista, el abortar o no lo decidiria cada mujer de acuerdo a su circunstancias, yo nunca lo haria en mi caso personal, ahora no dependeria de que se legalice o no, si la persona lo deseara hacer lo haria con o sin ley, no lo crees, te digo dependera de cada mujer cada quien el libre de hacer lo que quiera con su cuerpo.|`|690b9e02d0f36d146533f6f5821c9d1faa	Pienso que hacer legal el aborto evitará muchas muertes por abortos clandestinos y evitará que haya charlatanes que se hagan ricos con ese tipo de prácticas.  <br>  <br>  NO ESTOY DE ACUERDO CON EL ABORTO, sin embargo pienso que es una decision personal y moral de cada quien.|`|Hu8Q7l0Qaa	Pues yo creo q deberia existir esa opcion para la q se sienta completamente segura moralmente d lo q va a hacer y pues con eso creo q se evitarian muchisimas situaciones q pasan en el mundo por culpa d madres q solo cumplieron con la funcion d tener a los hijos y los abandonan o los van matando poco a poco aunq esten vivos..|`|Pv64U1H9aa	Es mejor que sea legal xq igualmente se practica y si es legal al menos no se corren tantos riesgos.|`|Xzxf3a12aa	Que abandonaran menos bebes, que se evitaran las muertes por abortos clandestinos, que dejaran de lucrarse los matasanos y no habrá mas abortos porque sea legal, si una mujer quiere abortar lo hace sea legal o no.|`|addbf1f7f59745572e8d6f92dcec2891aa	Pienso que de todas formas se hace, qué mejor que sea legal, así no sale tan caro y las condiciones de higiene mejorarían, habría menos mortandad de mujeres.|`|da0a93a0547c9f801a883dd1906c70a1aa	no se puede legalizar el asesinato, nuestros paises son conservadores y prefiero que sigan siendolo|`|6ea2921e6f50fa1e84deefd489313cf7aa	Socrates dijo:<br>  el mayor premio es no haber nacido|`|WuiV1BEfaa	hey  baby ;  bueno yo creo que  esta muy mal  eso porque  a mi punto de vista  los jovenes como nosotros   tendriamo  la seguridad    de tener sexo many  times    sin ni siquiera pensar en lo que eso significa   y   sin cuidar   a nuestra pareja   ni tampoco a nosotros mismos  seria como asesina y su complice;  yo lei un libro que dice que los bebes  aunque esten dentro de la mujer  tienen la abilidad   de llorar y pegar gritos de desesperacion cuado se esta  realisando el proseso de aborto;; ademas  las mujeres que asen eso tienden a contraer  enfermedades   tiempo despues  del aborto.....    yyyy  para mi el sexo es algo  natural  y no me es algom  malo   porque antes de aserlo  me aseguro bien   para no correr no riesgo  y  eso es lo que todo mundo deveria de aser   OK  by nena.|`|uNGmJR5zaa	Bueno... mirá a decir verdad, creo que el aborto consiste en matar una vida humana y  yo, como abogada estoy totalmente en contra de ello; sin embargo, creo que existen casos en los cuales se puede "tolerar" este mecanismo, pues en los casos en los cuales el feto está enfermo, o bien cuando corre riesgo la vida de la madre me parece totalmente procedente.

d5329536070d69396fcdc9e2151bb621aa	El aborto no es un homicidio (o una lección elemental de biología)<br>  En días recientes se ha reavivado una nueva edición de la polémica entre abortistas y antiabortistas a raíz de la iniciativa de varios integrantes de la Asamblea Legislativa del Distrito Federal para ampliar la despenalización del aborto. De nuevo se escuchan las voces de la ultraderecha y las altas jerarquías de la Iglesia católica que utilizan y repiten ad nauseam el único seudoargumento que tienen para oponerse a y condenar el aborto en cualquiera de sus modalidades: la vida (humana) comienza desde el momento de la concepción y, por lo tanto, el aborto, al ser una interrupción del proceso vital, es un homicidio.<br>  <br>  Por una obligación moral ante la sociedad, es necesario hacer un esfuerzo para explicar por qué las afirmaciones de los se?ores de El Yunque, los Rivera Carrera y los Serrano Limón, de Pro Vida, son totalmente falsas y reveladoras de la más profunda de las ignorancias.<br>  <br>  El seudoargumento arriba citado se basa en una completa confusión entre lo que es vida y lo que es un individuo biológico. Si bien no existe hasta el momento una definición de vida clara y tajante, admitida unánimemente por todos los científicos, sí se admite desde hace casi dos siglos, cuando Theodor Schleiden y Mattias Schwann emitieron su teoría celular, que existe una unidad mínima de materia viva que puede existir de manera autónoma a las demás. Esta unidad es la célula. Todo ser vivo está compuesto de peque?as unidades de vida llamadas células. Algunos seres vivos, llamados unicelulares, al mismo tiempo que son una célula, son el individuo biológico, pero solamente ellos.<br>  <br>  Aceptada esta verdad elemental, vemos que en el ser humano, tanto espermatozoides como óvulos son células, unidades de vida al igual que las neuronas, los leucocitos, los hepatocitos o los odontoblastos. Cuando un espermatozoide fecunda a un óvulo, se forma una nueva célula, distinta a las dos que le dieron origen, pero sigue siendo una célula. La diferencia fundamental es que esa nueva célula contiene la información genética de los dos potenciales progenitores del individuo que está por producirse, pero que aún no lo es. El hecho de que esa célula-huevo sea el resultado de esa fecundación del gameto femenino por parte del masculino, no le confiere el estatus de individuo biológico, pues no puede sobrevivir de manera independiente a quienes sí son individuos biológicos: la madre y el padre. Solamente los individuos biológicos pueden desarrollarse y sobrevivir de manera independiente a otros de su misma y de otras especies, gracias al proceso de diferenciación y especialización de sus partes. En el caso de los vertebrados superiores, grupo al cual pertenece el ser humano, ni embriones ni fetos pueden considerarse individuos biológicos pues carecen del desarrollo que les permite alcanzar esa independencia en su existir, aunque estén compuestos de células y, por lo tanto, haya vida en ellos, pero no individuación. Por esa sencilla razón, la destrucción de una célula o un conjunto de células cualquiera del ser humano no puede ser considerada un homicidio.<br>  <br>  Si la tesis antiabortista de la ultraderecha fuera correcta tendríamos que extenderla a cualquier modalidad de pérdida celular. Cualquier hemorragia sería un asesinato de células del tejido sanguíneo y tendría que ser sujeto de persecución legal, en algunos casos con la atenuante de la involuntariedad del "homicidio", como en la menstruación, pero no lo sería así en el caso de la pérdida de células del tracto bucal expulsadas en un escupitajo, o en la extracción de una muela, menos aún en la amputación de un miembro. En todos esos ejemplos existe una masiva pérdida de células de uno u otro tipo. Hay pérdida de vida, a veces consciente y voluntaria. ?Han de considerarse estos casos como asesinatos? ?Vaya ridiculez! Hasta se sonroja uno de pena al tener que estar ocupando espacio en un diario serio como este para explicar cosas tan elementales a personas tan ignorantes como las que conforman la ultraderecha de este país.<br>  <br>  En fin, cada una de las "discusiones" que se tienen cuando se intenta despenalizar el aborto es una confrontación de la verdad y el saber contra la mentira y la ignorancia. Inevitablemente la ultraderecha se ubica en el segundo bando. Ningún legislador puede hacer la mínima concesión a la ignorancia; esto, en estos momentos, incluye en primerísimo lugar a los legisladores del Distrito Federal, quienes tienen la obligación de perseguir el bien público combatiendo el fanatismo y la ignorancia. La despenalización del aborto debe extenderse.

De tal modo, las conocidas como células madre no serían entonces tan importantes, pues su objetivo es el desarrollo hacia funciones específicas.<br>  <br>  En esencia el embrión dicigótico es una célula madre, pero diferente a las demás, en el aspecto de que bajo la influencia adecuada, siempre está encaminada a formar un SER HUMANO completo. Obvio, si Don Rich cree que para sere humano hace falta ser independiente, entonces creo que él no sentíría el menor remordimiento de matar a un hijo suyo de 2 a?os, ya que, citando sus palabras, aún no se ha "individualizado", a esa edad, el bebé aún se percibe a sí mismo como parte de su madre.<br>  <br>  La gente que habla del aborto como si de sonarse los mocos se tratara peca de una ignorancia bárbara. La mayoría de los casos de aborto no son por madre soltera y paupérrima, o por violación o cuantos justificantes se aduzcan, sino por la FLOJERA, DESIDIA, VALEMADRISMO y demás de gente que se niega sistemáticamente a emplear un método de planificación familiar.<br>  <br>  Realmente, en lugar de aprobar el aborto, se debería reforzar fuertemente la promoción y empleo de los anticonceptivos, ?hay tantos y tan diversos!<br>  <br>  Finalmente, si comparan, en México está creciendo de manera alarmante la cifra de casos de Cáncer Cervicouterino, prostáticos y coloproctitis, adivinen por qué...<br>  <br>  La causa se llama Virus del Papiloma Humano, transmitido por relación sexual sin protección.

Segundo antes de tener la entrevista, prepara un guion con las posibles preguntas que te pueden hacer y respóndelas. Ensaya los días previos con este cuestionario enfrente de un espejo. Fíjate mucho en las respuestas y los gestos que haces cuando las respondes. Eso te ayudará a vencer la timidez y a mostrarte mas seguro de ti mismo en la entrevista. Para lo anterior haz que te ayude un familiar, tu pareja (novia, esposa), o un amigo (a), el que haga el papel del entrevistador y te de sus opiniones acerca de tu desenvolvimiento.

SDHvDNGJaa	Un mercado de pulgas es un lugar en donde encuentras objetos usados, antig?edades, de buena calidad, a buen precio. Es una "denominación  de origen". En Espa?a se le conoce como  "rastro",  en Monastiraki y Plaka, en Atenas se le llama "mercado de las pulgas" (?tal vez por influencia francesa?) al igual que al mercado de Saint Ouen en París. A éste, quizás, porque en su inicio fue el lugar donde los traperos y como diríamos en México, cachibacheros podían vender sus mercancías, las cuales (como sus vendedores) debían acarrear multitud de animalitos ingratos (les puces: pulgas en espa?ol). Sería interesante conocer el nombre original en griego del mercado de Monastiraki, para comprobar si efectivamente también es "pulgoso" en la moderna lengua helénica. En estos mercados es válido el famoso regateo, ellos te dan un precio tu ofreces otro y el precio final se consigue de común acuerdo. Por lo visto es una práctica antiquísima esto del mercado de pulgas, que se remonta a la Grecia Antigua.<br>  Un cordial saludo.|`|d242c69a06284d001db22d40e58a5a7faa	Es el mercado en donde se agrupan muchas personas a vender productos de todo tipo.

Así con ese mismo aprecio que le tienes hablale claro, para nada trates de dudar porque el puede tomar esa duda como una ligera esperanza, dile francamente que lo quieres COMO AMIGO pero que tu no compartes sus preferencias, y que si le dices eso es por el aprecio que le tienes.

a0090097cd4a79826131331acd8d0956aa	Serpientes y escaleras:<br>  El origen de este juego proviene del hindú moksha-patamu. En su versión original simbolizaba el recorrdido moral a lo largo de toda una vida, hasta alcanzar el cielo. Las escaleras son nuestros actos virtuosos que acortan el viaje del alma hasta alcanzar un estado de perfección definitivo. Las serpientes, son por el contrario, la representación de la maldad humana, y nos condenan a reencarnaciones en formas inferiores. La mayoría de las versiones occidentales de este juego han perdido este simbolismo. Si una ficha cae en una casilla con la cabeza de una serpiente, debe descender siguiendo el curso de la serpiente hasta la casilla donde se inicia su cola. Si la ficha cae en una casilla en la que se encuentra el pie de una escalera, podrá subir hasta la casilla en la que se encuentra el extremo superior de ésta.|`|SDHvDNGJaa	No es de mesa, pero si es un juego tradicional es la matatena, no se si serpientes y escaleras sea mexicano, pero no me exta?aría que fuera espa?ol como el juego de la oca.|`|HYgTUzpDaa	NO ES MEXICANO, ES ESPA?OL|`|Jwi5xJHRaa	tal vez la pirinola.|`|WEHCbMqKaa	No no es mexicano.

Todo sirve para aprender. Dicen que cuando se?alas a alguien con un dedo, los otros cuatro te se?alan a vos mismo...lamentablemente tendemos a hacerlo, puede ser una forma de justificar nuestro propio proceder. Sí creo es bueno cuando alguien con cari?o y no como juez te da un alerta si ve que estas errado, y no lo considero te esta juzgando sino ayudando a ver, cosa que a veces estando en algunas situaciones nos resulta difícil. un beso, es mi opinión...|`|nkYnKJNLaa	No podemos  ser felices juzgando a los demás, sino que eso debemos dejarselo a Dios que es el unico juez y perfecto.  Debemos tratarnos con el amor y la misericvordia y tener cuidado con las palabras que pueden herir a otros, como dice el Se?or :"cada cosa que hagamos a estos peque?os a mí me lo haceis".<br>  <br>  Debemos tener cuidado de ello y poner nuestra emte y corazón en sintonia con la paz que solo da Dios.|`|3a0d432b766ad2281db66ef2ba670a8daa	Juzgar es necesario para vivir. Si no juzgáramos (discrimináramos) lo bueno de lo malo, no podríamos saber si lo que comemos nos hará bien o nos hará mal, si las personas que nos rodean son amigos o enemigos. Pero lo malo es juzgar como si fuéramos seres superiores, que no tienen los defectos y las virtudes de los demás. En esta época se confunde la discriminación justa y necesaria con la discriminación arbitraria, fundada en prejuicios e ideas preconcebidas. Hay que discriminar en la vida, pero discriminar bien y sin orgullo.|`|eEUY3ezbaa	por supuesto q sí, nos hace creer superiores cuando en verdad no nos damos cuenta de lo patético q es, ya q sólo se juzga al q hace cosas, el q toma decisiones, sean erradas o no. es un alivio psicológico. creo q sólo tenemos derecho a juzgar a alguien cuando nos lastiman, lo demás es de mediocres.|`|g9K50TUFaa	El hecho de jusgar hace a la persona que jusga como mas superior al que esta jusgando, como un ser humano de caracteristicas superiores al resto, por ello la gente jusga, tambien podria interpretarse como una manera de autoconvencerse, de que por alguna razon uno esta un escalon mas arriba que el otro, como si fuera alguien especial que posee un razonamiento mas correcto que el otro (a pesar de que no sea asi).|`|jy4hevpsaa	El unico que puede juzgar al hombre es Dios, es el unico que conoce su corazon es él, mira la paja de tu ojo antes de juzgar a los demas. Cuando uno se?ala con el dedo a la gente hay tres dedos que te estan se?alando a ti. No juzgues para que no seas juzgado y con la misma vara que mides seras medido.

Porque tú estás denostando una religión, pero ocultas cual es la tuya y tus intenciones.<br>  El arte no tiene precio, y las iglesias son el mejor sitio donde pueden estar las obras de arte, porque es el sitio más sagrado, y donde todo el mundo lo puede admirar. Y no en el salón de ningún multimillonario. <br>  Por otra parte no eres católica, se supone que son los católicos los que debemos decidir con nuestro patrimonio ?no?, porque nosotros no nos metemos con lo que tienen los líderes de las sectas a su nombre en el banco. Mejor ocúpate de qué haces tú con tu dinero, o qué hace por los demás el gobierno al que que votas.<br>  El patrimonio artístico genera cultura, educación y también riqueza económica para la sociedad (restauración, conservación, investigación, catalogación, turismo), y sobre todo el disfrute de todos los que apreciamos el talento del ser humano, reflejado en las obras maestras del arte. <br>  Encuentro tu correo mezquino, porque la Iglesia Católica hace obras asistenciales por todo el mundo.<br>  Intenta hacer un discurso un poco más intelectual, por favor, porque deprimes con tus tópicos.|`|1df5c7da7bb867ebd327f613b8ffbbd1aa	Hola Andrómeda, espinoso tema el que planteas.<br>  En estos momentos, seamos realistas, no podemos hacer nada con lo que ya tienen acumulado.<br>  La iglesia reclama dinero, a través de?, porque a mi solo me lo reclama cuando efectúo la declaración de hacienda y aún así, puedo optar por no dárselo.<br>  Otra cosa son los favores "pagados", que a ciertos niveles es lo que prima.<br>  Pero nosotros, poca cosa podemos hacer.

Todos los católicos deberían plantearse si realmente quieren ser testigos de que sus oradores y pastores se embolsen el dinero del ciudadano con una frialdad aguda y sin falta de humanidad. Deberían plantearse si realmente esperan que el mundo vaya a mejor y tenga paz y amor como tanto cantan. Sé podría cambiar todo desde el momento que crean que lo que están haciendo no aporta nada al mundo , ni a la pobreza, ni a las guerras, si queréis ayudar al mundo dejar de rezar y hacer algo que realmente cambie, exigir a vuestros pastores y cambiar ese concepto radical, mirar a la gente como humanos que somos y intentar como hacemos los que no creemos ayudar en vez de quitar y defender ese hurto santo.|`|GnI35R8Gaa	Por propia experiencia se que la iglesia es dispensadora de la gracia de Jesus, en ella fuimos bautizados y recibimos los demas sacramentos, que no son sino expresiones visibles de la presencia de Dios y del amor que nos tiene. Ayudar a la iglesia economicamente para el sostenimiento del templo y la sustentacion de futuros sacerdotes es un acto de fe que agrada a Dios. Si no quieres dar esta ofrenda en dinero, Dios respeta tu decision. Sin embargo, en vez de atacar a la iglesia -que tanto nos sirve-, podemos orar por ella, por los sacerdotes con dificultades espirituales y en particular por aquellos que la juzgan en vez de ayudarla a levantarse. En lo personal, se que la iglesia catolica, a pesar de todo, es amada por Dios y no podria vivir sin ella. Mi hermano es sacerdote y he aprendido a ver todo de un modo distinto. <br>  <br>  En vez de preguntarse que pasaria si el vaticano vendiera sus bienes, mas bien pensemos en lo que cada uno de nosotros puede hacer por alguien o por muchos y no juzguemos a NADIE. Ya sabra nuestro buen Senor que cuentas tiene que rendirle el vaticano. El y solo El puede juzgarlo realmente. Por lo demas, no utilicemos a la iglesia como excusa para justificar nuestra propia mezquindad. Mas bien demos lo que podamos, si no tenemos dinero para compartir, o no queremos hacerlo, entonces al menos brindemosle apoyo y comprension al que podamos, cuanto mas a la iglesia!! :0<br>  <br>  Un hombre que abusa de un nino no lo hace por ser sacerdote, sino porque es un hombre con serios problemas que necesita ser ayudado (por supuesto que el nino primero, ni mas faltaba) pero dejen ya de juzgar a todos los sacerdotes porque unos hacen dano. <br>  <br>  Son muchos mas los buenos. Su tarea no es facil y mucho menos cuando son juzgados injustamente. Que paso con la misericordia? :(|`|VGpTifoRaa	Fijate que siempre me he preguntado lo mismo, los sacerdotes vievn con muchos comodidades, no solo las iglesias están llenas de riquezas, sino que ellos viven como personas ricas, creo que de verdad a Jesus eso no le agradaría, he visto padres con Ccamionetas del a?o, apartamentos, tienen ba?eras carisimas, uff que no se gastan esa gente, además un gran porcentaje de los ingresos de un gobierno son designados a las Iglesias, esto no es justo. Sin ir muy lejos casi siempre afuera de las iglesias hay gente pobre pidiendo dinero, comida, ayuda!! mientras que la gente cree que adorar y resar adentro se una Iiglesia a todas esas edificaciones carisimas les servirá de algo, el que quiere a Dios y quiere encontrarlo, está dentro de nosotros mismos, no hace falta adorar una imagen, ni una Iiglesia, y sies cuestión de predicar la palabra o adorar a Dios en grupo o en misas, pues podría ser en lugares humildes y sencillos como lo hizo Jesus. <br>  Definitiavamente hay dos cosas infinitas, el universo y la estupidez humana! =(|`|WYgMajZkaa	La iglesia nos habla de pecado, pero ellos pecan en el voto de pobreza, ya que no lo cumplen..

Busca fotos de la alcoba del Papa (que debería ser el más rico entre todos los curas) y notarás que su apartamento consiste en dos habitaciones y un ba?o, austeramente decorados con elementos religiosos.<br>  <br>  Los templos están llenos de riquezas porque son la Casa de Dios. El cura vive pobre, pero a Dios siempre se le procura un lugar mejor. Jesús no destruyó el templo, destruyó el comercio adyacente al templo.<br>  <br>  A la gente no se la salva con dinero y oro, sino con la Palabra. La misión de la Iglesia es difundir el evangelio, no enriquecer a los pobres (y aun así cada a?o, solo el vaticano destina 200 millones de dolares en ayuda a los países de áfrica).<br>  <br>  ?Un gerente puede vender los bienes de la empresa en la que trabaja?

Gran parte de esas riquezas han sido y son originadas por donaciones de feligreses.

Luego habla con tu marido, por mas duro que suene divorciarse, no sos la primera. Que tu hijo pueda mirarte orgulloso de la madre que tiene y vos tambien puedas sentirte orgullosa de vos misma.

Hasta ahora la política lingüística de la UE ha sido la de mantener los idiomas de los países miembros como oficiales (discriminando, eso sí, idiomas como el catalán, gallego, euskera, bretón etc.), ?pero qué ocurrirá cuando se incorporen los idiomas de los nuevos países miembros?, ?quién pagará el sueldo de los traductores que ya se lleva una parte proporcional elevadísima del presupuesto comunitario?, ?no sería mejor dedicar ese dinero por ejemplo a mejorar las escuelas que gastarlo en absurdos problemas de comunicación que serían muy fácilmente solventables?. Si la Unión Europea responde que sí a esta última pregunta e impone como oficial el inglés y algún otro idioma europeo para que los países ricos de Europa se queden satisfechos (el alemán o francés) ?cómo quieren que nos sintamos identificados con un proyecto político en el que la mayoría ni siquiera puede entender las decisiones que se toman?. Esta misma pregunta vale en cierta medida (sólo parcialmente) para el  movimiento por una globalización alternativa, que no debe caer en el error de aceptar la hegemonía cultural del mundo anglosajón para luchar precisamente contra esa hegemonía.

No había caso que se pusieran en el contexto de que era otro idioma, otra idiosincrasia, y que ellos estaban  a p r e n d i e n d o   otra lengua.

f6e8f18e271abcbbf579eb901716b74faa	Nacido en Austria, Franz Anton Mesmer cursó en Viena estudios de abogacía y medicina. Casado con un rica heredera, con una gran cultura y muy aficionado a la música (tocaba el armonio entre otros instrumentos) se dedicó inicialmente a organizar en su mansión veladas musicales a las que asistia Mozart, Haydn y otros compositores de la época. Así, la primera opera de Mozart, Bastien y Bastienne, fué estrenada en septiembre de 1768 en el teatro que Mesmer poseía en el jardin de su casa, a pesar de la religión y la aparición ciencia moderna, el ocultismo mantuvo su  presencia intelectual durante los siglos XVIII y XIX, estos personajes tan famosos pertenecían y practicaban la masonería.<br>  <br>  En 1774 Mesmer usó un imán para producir una ?marea artificial? en una paciente. Mesmer le hizo tragar una preparación que contenía hierro, y luego le sujetó imanes en varias partes de su cuerpo. La paciente dijo que percibía corrientes de un fluido misterioso corriendo a través de su cuerpo y por varias horas se sintió aliviada de sus síntomas. Mesmer no creyó que habían sido los imanes los que habían logrado la cura por sí mismos, sino que pensó que había contribuido al magnetismo animal que se había acumulado en su cuerpo y había sido transmitido a ella. Pronto dejó de usar imanes como parte de su tratamiento.<br>  <br>  Sin embargo, a raíz del conocimiento que tuvo Mesmer de la curación de una paciente con úlcera gástrica gracias a un imán, elaboró la teoría del "magnetismo animal". Mesmer creía en la existencia de un fluído magnético que podía ser traspasado de una persona a otra mediante la imposición de manos o friegas. Al principio utilizada un imán, pero posteriormente empleó las manos y a veces ni siquiera tocada a los pacientes, mujeres por regla general. Dicha imposición o pases provocaban en los pacientes crisis de histeria con convulsiones, espasmos, temblores seguidos de una remisión total o parcial de los síntomas.<br>  <br>  Inicialmente, su labor fué objeto de reconocimiento por sus colegas, adquiriendo Mesmer una gran fama y siendo incluso llamado a Munich por el Elector de Baviera. Allí, la aplicación del imán en casos de parálisis total y de debilidad óptica va seguida de un éxito tan fulminante que el Consejero de la Academia de Ausburgo escribe que ".. lo que ha conseguido aquí con diversas enfermedades hace suponer que le ha arrebatado a la naturaleza uno de sus más misteriosos secretos..". Posteriormente, sus éxitos y sus procedimientos un tanto teatrales comienzan a granjearle los envidias y odios de sus colegas. El caso de la Srta. Maria de Teresa de Paradies, es la gota que colma el vaso. Esta joven ciega tratada en vano por los más prestigiosos médicos vieneses, recupera con Mesmer parcialmente la vista. Sus despechados colegas acusan a Mesmer de superchería y de utilizar la joven, a que la acusan de ser amante. La situación empeora hasta tal punto que Mesmer abandona Viena y marcha a Paris en febrero de 1984. <br>  <br>  Al llegar a la capital francesa, Mesmer intenta en vano que la Academia de Ciencias y el recién fundado Colegio de Médicos acepten sus teorías y métodos, con los que consigue curaciones espectaculares. Al cabo de varios meses, y a pesar de haber obtenido un buen número de discípulos y adeptos entre los nobles y la burguesía - el mismísimo marqués de La Fayette es uno de sus más fervientes admiradores -, Mesmer no consigue el reconocimiento oficial siendo el propio rey Luis XVI uno de los más escépticos. Mesmer abandona Paris y marcha a Alemania.<br>   <br>  La polémica está servida. Sus seguidores y adeptos fundan una "Société de l' Harmonie" para recabar fondos, consiguiendo la enorme suma de 340.000 libras, haciendo volver a Mesmer a Paris donde, pese a la oposición oficial es el médico de moda. La situación es tan compleja que Luis XVI ordena a la Academia de Ciencias que cree una comisión de investigación para comprobar la veracidad y la utilidad de la medicina practicada por Mesmer. Aunque en dicha comisión figuran personalidades tan se?aladas como el médico Guillotin (-que pocos a?os después inventaría la guillotina-), el astrónomo Bailly, el botánico Jussieu, el químico Lavoisier y Benjamin Franklin, embajador en Paris de los recién creados Estados Unidos, el informe de la misma es desfavorable. El 11 de Agosto de 1784, la Academia proclama solemnemente "la nullité du magnétisme".<br>  <br>  Para colmo de males, en ese mismo a?o de 1784, uno de los discípulos de Mesmer, el conde Maxime de Puységur que practica sus métodos en Bayona de forma altruista, descubre fortuitamente al intentar magnetizar a un joven pastor, que este, en lugar de mostrar los síntomas habituales de convulsiones, temblores y espasmos, entra en un sue?o profundo, un trance hipnótico. Durante el mismo, el paciente es capaz de reponder a preguntas y de obedecer las órdenes de Puységur, pero al despertar no recuerda nada. Aunque el hipnotismo había sido descrito de alguna manera en la medicina - Paracelso cuenta como los monjes del convento de K?rntner distraían a los pacientes con objetos centelleantes durante los tratamientos y en la antiguedad, a partir de Apolonio de Tyana ya se encuentran huellas de procesos hipnóticos, es sin duda Puységur el que incorpora la hipnosis al mundo. Pronto el vulgo cree que el sujeto hipnotizado, el medium, posee propiedades omniscientes y puede contestar a todo tipo de preguntas y comienzan a proliferar charlatantes, farsantes y estafadores que se aprovechan de la credulidad de la gente para hacer fortuna. El mesmerismo, al que por extensión se ha incorporado el fenómeno hipnótico, se va desacreditando poco a poco. El mismo Mesmer es acusado por haber montado "un espectaculo de feria".<br>  <br>  En 1792, Mesmer pobre y olvidado, habiendo perdido durante la Revolución muchos de sus amigos nobles, abandona definitivamente Paris. Después de una corta estancia en Viena, donde es arrestado y encarcelado, aunque luego es puesto en libertad sin cargos, Mesmer se retira a su casa del lago Constanza donde seguirá ejerciendo, como médico rural hasta su muerte. Hubo que esperar hasta 1882, para que el nombre de Mesmer y el hipnotismo fueran rehabilitados por Charcot en la Salpétriêre de Paris.<br>   <br>  El mesmerismo (en francés mesmérisme) también conocida como la doctrina del ?magnetismo animal?, se refería a un supuesto medio etéreo postulado como agente terapéutico por el médico Franz Mesmer (1733-1815) proveniente de Alemania. Fue un término muy usado en la segunda mitad del siglo XVIII.<br>  <br>  Mesmer es considerado como el padre de la hipnosis moderna. Fue el primero en creer en la capacidad de toda persona para curar a su prójimo usando el hipotético (y ahora aceptado universalmente como inexistente) ?magnetismo animal?.<br>  <br>  El mesmerismo es, usando las mismas leyes, el fenómeno opuesto a la moderna hipnosis. La hipnosis tiende más al dominio del sujeto, y muy a menudo los hipnotizadores terminan por injertarles vicios morales, quizás inconscientemente a sus sujetos. En cambio el mesmerismo, basado en la creencia del "Magnetismo animal" (o sea, en otras palabras la hoy tan conocida sugestión) se encaminaba más al cuidado del paciente. En sus inicios, Mesmer, en su establecimiento curativo fundado en Viena, no sólo usó el magnetismo animal, sino que también empleó electricidad, metales y maderas.<br>  <br>  Quizás sus creencias tenían un ligero vaho, proveniente de la tradición europea de la alquimia. él creía que todo el universo se había desarrollado de una sustancia homogénea primordial, luego diferenciada en la diversidad que conocemos. Luego entonces, la madera, metales, piedras, plantas que él usaba se basaban en la afinidad con el cuerpo del enfermo, más directo aún, en la afinidad y correspondencia de los átomos y mediante el uso ya sea interno (bebidas) o externo (brazaletes y otros debidamente magnetizados) de este agente, el paciente recibía fuerza adicional para combatir la enfermedad. Según es reportado, Frankz Mesmer hizo muchas curaciones para su tiempo Pero fue en 1774 cuando realmente dio con el secreto del magnetismo, y quedo tan altamente interesado que abandono el uso de imanes naturales.<br>  <br>  Fue aquí cuando le dio el conocido nombre de magnetismo animal y la nueva fuerza fue entonces empleada por toda Europa a través de multitud de seguidores. Alrededor de 1780, Mesmer ya se había instalado en París; aquí atendió a muchos.<br>  <br>  El mesmerismo fue examinado científicamente por una Comisión Real Francesa que había sido hecha en 1784 por Luis XVI. La comisión incluía a Majault, Benjamin Franklin, Jean Sylvain Bailly, J. B. Le Roy, Sallin, Jean Darcet, de Borey, Joseph-Ignace Guillotin, Antoine Lavoisier, Poissonnier, Caille, Mauduyt de la Varenne, Andry, y de Jussieu.<br>  <br>  La Comisión estuvo de acuerdo en que las curas de Mesmer eran curas realmente, la Comisión también concluyó que no había evidencia de un fluido magnético, y que sus efectos derivaban de imaginaciones.<br>  <br>  En 1825 hubo una segunda investigación, pero el reporte fue nuevamente dejado de lado una vez más.<br>  <br>  El flujo Mesmer entendía la salud calibre del proceso de la vida a través de cientos de canales eléctricos que recorren el cuerpo humano. La enfermedad sería causada por los obstáculos, sin tocarlo.<br>  <br>  Hoy se supone que — al igual que cualquier otro método de inducción de trance hipnótico —, aquellos pases favorecían la liberación del espíritu, abriendo el subconsciente del paciente, cuya voluntad quedaba vulnerable a toda suerte de sugestiones.<br>  <br>  Otros aseguran que Mesmer hacía que un grupo de curiosos voluntarios formaran un círculo, permaneciendo sentados, tomándose de las manos y formando una cadena humana, en cuyos extremos, dos de los asistentes introducían sendas barras metálicas en diferentes soluciones hidroelectrolíticas, de manera que hacían circular por sus cuerpos una suave corriente eléctrica. ésta trasmitía al sistema nervioso cierta clase de sensaciones, producto de la propia corriente y de los cambios provocados en la propia composición electrolítica de los fluidos corporales.<br>  <br>  Se supone que Mesmer no entendía claramente la naturaleza de sus experimentos ni de sus consecuencias, aunque lo explotaba con fines comerciales.<br>  <br>  Sin embargo, tuvo mucha oposición de parte de los catedráticos de su época. Así, muchas de las fuentes de hoy son debidas al reporte de Bailly, que quiso eliminarlo por completo. Pero en esencia el propósito del mesmerismo era la curación de enfermedades.<br>  <br>  Este término también fue empleado en el siglo XIX por una congregación religiosa llamada "Ciencia cristiana". Describía las influencias mentales maliciosas o ignorantes (imperceptibles o a las que no se les presta atención), y que dependen de que los sujetos crean en ellas. <br>  El uso más común del término magnetismo animal se refiere al carisma o al atractivo sexual de una persona. <br>  <br>  Saludos.|`|2e53b14c32ffa311e21211775bf777caaa	si, es cierto,Mesmer,como han puesto en otras respuestas fue el que impuso esta doctrina, no se si te acordas de Tu-Sam el usaba esto, que también se llama facinasión le rascaba la panza a una gallina y la "dormía"<br>  pero esta forma de hipnosis ya la acostumbraban los egipcios, también los celtas.druidas y hasta aborígenes americanos actualmente, supuestamente es para llegar a curar las mentes desquiciadas,pero para eso en la época de don Mesmer estaba la santa iglesia<br>  por lo que se el creía en Dios, solo que no podía aceptar que un dios que le da la inteligencia para acercarse a esta rama de la ciencia(así se la concidera hoy)no podía también ser el mismo que castigaba a los seres con problemas mentales<br>  lo descubrió investigando tradiciones orales que hablaban de seres sin voluntad, tengo que admitir que se obsesiono un poco, bah... bastante y por eso tuvo mala prensa<br>  espero que te sirva<br>  ciao|`|33315295bf0d2502d7154fc233f96a23aa	la verdad no sabria que contestarte solo que si existe, y no es por ser vanidoso pero tengo un chingo........<br>  solitas caen.......<br>  saludos........|`|b57d6ecb6ca28ab2d6e6b29aac83e87faa	era el austriaco Franz Friedrich Antón Mesmer|`|7cd694d407ae672aa9999f0fec349a08aa	Descubridor: El médico alemán Franz Anton Mesmer  (1733-1815),<br>  considerado, quizás injustamente, como el padre de la hipnosis moderna. <br>  El creía en la capacidad de toda persona para curar a su prójimo usando el ?magnetismo animal?, o sea, en otras palabras la hoy tan conocida sugestión; encaminada al cuidado del paciente.<br>  No creo que haya sido ateo, puesto que estudió en las universidades jesuitas de Dilinga e Ingolstadt.<br>  ........<br>  Maitechumia:<br>  En 1775, la Academia de Berlín publica una carta en la que trata al magnetismo de "mistificación", a pesar de los buenos resultados y curaciones conseguidas hasta entonces (por ej. la curación del barón Horka) . De todos modos, Mesmer continúa con sus tratamientos. Sin embargo, después de la continua oposición de los médicos, abandona Viena en 1778, como bien dices, y se instala en Paris. <br>  Al a?o siguiente, la publicación de su "Memoria sobre el descubrimiento del Magnetismo Animal" despierta una enorme curiosidad y le asegura el éxito. <br>  Entre los a?os 1783 y 1784, el mesmerismo se transforma en la curación "de rnoda" y es entonces que la Facultad de Medicina obtiene que se dicte una prohibición de las sesiones, lo que despierta la cólera de los pacientes y de la opinión pública. Debido a este asunto, Luis XVI decide crear dos comisiones para que se encarguen de estudiar el fenómeno, concluyendo que el fluido universal no existe, que es producto de la imaginación, y peor aún le atribuyen peligrosidad por sus "connotaciones sexuales" (debido al contacto que se requiere para la imposición de las manos). <br>  Desenga?ado y en vista de que la práctica del magnetismo le estaba prohibida a pesar de las curaciones atestiguadas por los enfermos, Mesmer se retira a Constancia, donde vive apaciblemente hasta su muerte, en 1815. <br>  <br>  Saludos.|`|SDHvDNGJaa	No se, me quedo aquí para aprender algo nuevo.<br>  Saludos!

En cambio, Shmuley Boteach expresa una opinión diametralmente opuesta en su libro An Intelligent Person’s Guide to Judaism (Guía del judaísmo para gente inteligente), donde dice: “El hombre no es un animal, por lo que siempre ejerce control sobre su destino”.<br>  <br>  Muchas personas concuerdan con las palabras de Gray y creen que la suerte de la familia humana está a merced de fuerzas ciegas de la naturaleza. Sin embargo, otras consideran que Dios dotó al hombre con la capacidad de configurar su propio futuro.<br>  <br>  Hay quienes opinan que su porvenir está en manos de fuerzas humanas poderosas. Según el escritor Roy Weatherford, “la mayoría de la gente —y en especial la mayoría de las mujeres a lo largo de la historia— no tiene [...] ni poder ni control sobre su vida debido a razones obvias: la opresión y explotación humanas” (The Implications of Determinism [Las repercusiones del determinismo]). Por otra parte, muchos han visto desvanecerse los sue?os de un futuro feliz cuando sus rivales políticos o militares han asumido el poder.<br>  <br>  En el pasado, otros se han sentido maniatados porque creían que fuerzas sobrehumanas gobernaban su existencia. “A los griegos de la antigüedad —dice Boteach— les obsesionaba la idea de que toda esperanza era vana, pues creían que el hombre era incapaz de eludir su suerte ya fijada.” Opinaban que la suerte de cada ser humano estaba a merced de diosas caprichosas. Según sus creencias, estas divinidades decidían cuándo moriría cierta persona, así como cuánto dolor y angustia soportaría durante su vida.<br>  <br>  Hoy día está muy extendida la creencia de que una fuerza sobrehumana controla el destino de la gente. Hay quienes la llaman kismet, y afirman que Dios ha predeterminado el resultado de toda acción humana y el momento de la muerte. Por otra parte, está la doctrina de la predestinación —aceptada en la cristiandad—, que plantea la idea de que “la salvación o condena final del individuo ha sido dispuesta de antemano” por el Todopoderoso.<br>  <br>  ?Qué opina usted? ?Han fijado su futuro fuerzas que escapan a su control? ?O hay algo de verdad en las siguientes palabras del dramaturgo inglés William Shakespeare: “Los hombres son due?os de sus destinos en cierto momento”? <br>  ?Es usted due?o de su destino?<br>  ?ESTá predeterminado nuestro destino eterno? ?No influyen para nada en nuestro futuro las decisiones que tomamos en la vida?<br>  <br>  Supongamos que el hombre es due?o de su propio destino. ?Podría alguien haber nacido para efectuar una labor concreta u ocupar cierta posición? ?Y cómo realizaría Dios su voluntad en la Tierra si los humanos tuvieran autonomía para configurar su futuro? La Biblia ofrece respuestas satisfactorias a estos interrogantes.<br>  <br>  ?Son compatibles la predestinación y el libre albedrío?<br>  Pensemos en cómo hizo Jehová Dios al hombre. “A [su] imagen [...] lo creó; macho y hembra los creó”, afirma la Biblia (Génesis 1:27). Por lo tanto, poseemos la capacidad de reflejar sus cualidades, como el amor, la justicia, la sabiduría y el poder. Nos confirió también el don del libre albedrío, o la libertad de elección, algo que nos diferencia del resto de su creación terrestre. Podemos optar por seguir la guía moral de Dios o rechazarla, razón por la cual el profeta Moisés pudo decir: “De veras tomo los cielos y la tierra como testigos contra ustedes hoy, de que he puesto delante de ti la vida y la muerte, la bendición y la invocación de mal; y tienes que escoger la vida a fin de que te mantengas vivo, tú y tu prole, amando a Jehová tu Dios, escuchando su voz y adhiriéndote a él” (Deuteronomio 30:19, 20).<br>  <br>  Sin embargo, el libre albedrío no nos concede libertad absoluta, pues seguimos sujetos a las leyes físicas y morales que Dios implantó para suministrar paz y estabilidad al universo, normas que fueron establecidas para nuestro bien y cuya violación puede acarrearnos graves consecuencias. Pensemos tan solo en lo que sucedería si decidiéramos pasar por alto la ley de la gravedad y saltáramos desde una torre (Gálatas 6:7).<br>  <br>  La libertad de elección también nos impone obligaciones que no tienen las criaturas que carecen de este don. El escritor Corliss Lamont pregunta: “?Cómo podemos atribuirle al hombre responsabilidades éticas y castigarlo por sus malas obras si admitimos [...] que sus elecciones y actos están predeterminados?”. Es obvio que no podemos. Los animales irracionales no son moralmente responsables de lo que hacen, como tampoco lo son las computadoras que ejecutan sus funciones programadas. Por lo tanto, el libre albedrío coloca sobre nuestros hombros la seria responsabilidad de rendir cuentas de nuestras acciones.<br>  Sería injusto y poco amoroso de parte de Jehová que antes de nacer prefijara nuestro derrotero en la vida y luego nos responsabilizara de nuestros actos. Pero él no obra así, porque “Dios es amor”, y “todos sus caminos son justicia” (1 Juan 4:8; Deuteronomio 32:4). No nos dotó de libre albedrío y al mismo tiempo determinó desde la eternidad a quién salvaría y a quién condenaría, como afirman los partidarios de la predestinación. La libertad de elección descarta esta doctrina.<br>  <br>  La Biblia es clara al indicar que las decisiones que tomamos inciden en nuestro porvenir. Por ejemplo, Dios ruega a los pecadores: “Vuélvanse, por favor, cada uno de su camino malo y de la maldad de sus tratos, [...] para que yo no les cause calamidad” (Jeremías 25:5, 6). Esta súplica no tendría sentido si Dios ya los hubiera predestinado. Además, su Palabra asevera: “Arrepiéntanse, por lo tanto, y vuélvanse para que sean borrados sus pecados, para que vengan tiempos de refrigerio de parte de la persona de Jehová” (Hechos 3:19). ?Por qué habría Jehová de pedirles a las personas que se arrepintieran y cambiaran si supiera de antemano que nada alteraría un ápice su suerte final?<br>  <br>  Según las Escrituras, hay quienes reciben la invitación divina de reinar en el cielo con Jesucristo (Mateo 22:14; Lucas 12:32). Sin embargo, se les dice que perderán tal privilegio si no son fieles hasta la muerte (Revelación [Apocalipsis] 2:10). ?Por qué habría de invitarlos Dios si ya tuviera decidido no elegirlos? Veamos también lo que el apóstol Pablo escribió a sus hermanos en la fe: “Si voluntariosamente practicamos el pecado después de haber recibido el conocimiento exacto de la verdad, no queda ya sacrificio alguno por los pecados” (Hebreos 10:26). Tal advertencia habría sido inútil si Dios los hubiera predestinado. Ahora bien, ?no ha predeterminado a algunos para ser gobernantes con Jesucristo?<br>  <br>  ?Se les predetermina individual, o colectivamente?<br>  El apóstol Pablo escribió: “[Dios] nos ha bendecido con toda bendición espiritual en los lugares celestiales en unión con Cristo, así como nos escogió en unión con él antes de la fundación del mundo [...]. Pues nos predeterminó a la adopción mediante Jesucristo como hijos para sí mismo” (Efesios 1:3-5). ?Qué ha predeterminado Dios, y qué significa ser escogido “antes de la fundación del mundo”?<br>  <br>  Este pasaje indica que Dios ha elegido a algunos descendientes del primer hombre, Adán, para reinar con Cristo en los cielos (Romanos 8:14-17, 28-30; Revelación 5:9, 10). No obstante, suponer que predeterminó a personas concretas para que recibieran este privilegio miles de a?os antes de que nacieran está re?ido con el hecho de que los seres humanos poseen libre albedrío. Dios predeterminó a un grupo, o clase de gente, no a personas individuales.<br>  <br>  A modo de ejemplo: supongamos que un Estado decide crear cierto organismo y predetermina sus funciones, poderes y tama?o. Por fin, dicho organismo entra en funcionamiento tiempo después de su creación, y sus integrantes emiten la siguiente nota: “El gobierno dispuso a?os atrás cuál sería nuestra función. Ha llegado el momento de cumplir con ella”. ?Concluiría usted que el Estado predeterminó con a?os de antelación quiénes individualmente llegarían a formar parte del organismo? Claro que no. De igual modo, Jehová dispuso el establecimiento de un organismo especial para remediar los efectos del pecado de Adán. Predeterminó al conjunto de personas que lo integrarían, pero no a sus integrantes. Estos serían elegidos después, y las decisiones que tomaran en su vida pesarían a favor o en contra de su aprobación final.<br>  <br>  ?A qué mundo se refería el apóstol Pablo cuando dijo: “[Dios] nos escogió en unión con él antes de la fundación del mundo”? Pablo no alude aquí al que comenzó con la creación de Adán y Eva, pues aquel entorno era “muy bueno” y no tenía ni el menor rastro de pecado o corrupción (Génesis 1:31). Por lo tanto, no precisaba “liberación” del pecado (Efesios 1:7).<br>  <br>  El mundo al que hizo alusión Pablo es el que llegó a existir tras la rebelión de la primera pareja en Edén, uno completamente diferente al que se había propuesto Dios. Tuvo su origen con el nacimiento de los hijos de Adán y Eva, y estuvo constituido por gente alejada de Dios y esclavizada al pecado y la corrupción. Se trataba de personas que podían ser redimidas, a diferencia de Adán y Eva, que pecaron deliberadamente (Romanos 5:12; 8:18-21).<br>  <br>  Jehová Dios afrontó sin demora la situación que hizo surgir aquella rebelión. Enseguida dispuso el establecimiento de un organismo especial —el Reino mesiánico en manos de Jesucristo— que utilizaría, entre otros objetivos, para la redención de la humanidad del pecado adánico (Mateo 6:10). Dios actuó así “antes de la fundación del mundo” de la humanidad redimible, es decir, antes de que les nacieran hijos a Adán y Eva.<br>  <br>  Los hombres suelen planear sus acciones para lograr objetivos. La predestinación está vinculada a la idea de que Dios ha de tener un plan detallado para el universo en el cual todo está predeterminado. Roy Weatherford escribe: “Numerosos filósofos han opinado que no puede esperarse menos de la Majestad de Dios que una completa especificación de cada suceso”. ?Tiene Dios que precisar todo acontecimiento de antemano?<br>  <br>  En vista de su infinito poder y su inigualable sabiduría, Jehová puede afrontar cualquier contingencia que surja del ejercicio del libre albedrío de sus criaturas (Isaías 40:25, 26; Romanos 11:33). Es capaz de hacerlo al instante y sin previa planificación. Al contrario de los hombres imperfectos, que tienen capacidades limitadas, el Todopoderoso no precisa un plan minucioso que establezca de antemano el destino de cada persona del planeta (Proverbios 19:21). De hecho, varias traducciones de la Biblia dicen en Efesios 3:11 que Dios tiene un “propósito eterno”, en lugar de un plan prefijado.<br>  <br>  ESPERO LO LEAS COMPLETO, Y TE AYUDA A DAR RESPUESTAS A TU DUDA EXISTENCIAL<br>  <br>  buen dia|`|443751f88c2f7ed4c0572e951f579588aa	amigo :<br>  <br>    Acuerdate que ellos nacieron inocentes, lo que paso en el camino de la vida fue su eleccion, Dios nos dio libre alberdrio...<br>  <br>  Dios que te creo sin ti, no te podra salvar sin ti|`|640bdb55ccc56a7df4ec1734e28bf237aa	Se puede hacer una peque?a defensa de Nerón, pues los primeros cristianos le atribuyeron, quizás, demasiadas cosas.

La libertad si no ha alcanzado su perfección puede fallar, y eso es el pecado. La perfección de la libertad la alcanzaremos en la otra vida, donde ya no podrá fallar, pero eso será algo sobrenatural, consecuencia de la visión de Dios cara a cara. Dios ha querido que haya distintos grados de seres, y en el caso del ser libre eso implica la posible existencia del pecado. Pero en último término para los que lo merezcan es un estado intermedio y no definitivo. Por eso Dios lo tolera porque no da su gracia al que no coopera con ella. Y en último término los males que podamos sufrir por parte de los malos repercutirán en mayor gloria para los buenos. San Pablo decía que para los que aman a Dios todo es para bien. Nada nos podrá separar del amor de Cristo. Por otro lado Dios es Justo y quiere premiar a los buenos y castigar a los malos, lo que no podría hacer si nos quita la libertad.<br>  Además la oración puede evitar muchos males, pero se reza tan poco. Luego no nos podemos quejar.<br>  <br>  En resumen: <br>  1. Dios quiere que haya distintos grados de ser<br>  2. La libertad natural puede fallar<br>  3. El estado perfecto de la libertad es sobrenatural y hay que merecerlo.<br>  4.

30ae8d0ad22d3c3688372363a60305dbaa	Hola, mira Adán fue creado perfecto o sea habría vivido para siempre, pero no era inmortal, ni Jesús lo fue pues de hecho murió en el madero de tormento, luego, sí, al ser resucitado por su Padre sí fue inmortal, Adán tenía los atributos de Jehová que son:amor, sabiduría, justicia y poder. En consecuencia, poseía un sentido de moralidad que implicaba una conciencia, algo completamente nuevo en el ámbito de la vida terrestre. Al estar hecho a la imagen de Dios, habría de administrar toda la Tierra y tener en sujeción a las criaturas terrestres y marinas, así como a las aves del cielo. Pero no tenía ni inmortalidad (sólo viviría para siempre)o sea eternidad y tampoco tenía lo que llamamos presciencia, sólo Jehová la posee  en la Biblia se dice claramente que Dios puede preconocer y predeterminar. Jehová mismo presenta como prueba de su Divinidad esta capacidad de preconocer y predeterminar acontecimientos de salvación y liberación, así como actos de juicio y castigo , Adán tenía un concepto claro de las consecuencias inmediatas de su actuar pue Jehová ya se lo había advertido y a diferencia de Eva que fue enga?ada, Adán pecó , con pleno conocimiento de causa decidió pecar o sea desobedecer, en lo personal pienso que no tuvo en cuenta la responsabilidad de la que hablás, lo que puedo decirte para terminar es que no tuvo lo que llamás ciencia infusa de origen sobrenatural como no la tuvo Jesús sino a partir de ser bautizado, eran ambos seres perfectos, si Adán no hubiese pecado hoy día viviría entre nosotros , lo mismo Jesús, si no hubiese cumplido con su misión maravillosa, pero reitero, ninguno fue inmortal, sólo Jesús luego de su resurrección, y recordemos que fue levantado en espíritu y tomó imagen humana para poder ser reconocido|`|8271b77aa17e8c1a5256ee53fe34aeb6aa	Saludos amigo, entre para apoyar la respuesta de "rajadevi" esta maravillosa su ponencia.|`|EklfNSkBaa	Adan vivio en el jardin del eden (conciencia espiritual) hasta que eva lo indujo a comer del fruto del arbol del bien y el mal(conocimiento de la materialidad de las cosas) entonces el tambien probo de aquel conocimiento y entro a la materialidad perdiendo con esto gran parte de su estado de gracia. (Caida del hombre ) No tenia la remota idea de lo que perderia y de todo lo que generaria, como tampoco lo tenemos nosotros actualmente, los errores que cometemos y sus consecuencias se las achacamos a Dios, y no nos percatamos que nosotros nos acarreamos nuestros propios sufrimientos.<br>  no tenia conocimiento del futuro, porque si asi hubiera sido no habria ocurrido ciertamente ninguna caida en la materialidad. pero sus potencialidades de vida divina o sea el arbol de la vida, que tambien estaba alli en el eden, eso si lo perdio, por tal motivo tenemos que luchar por alcanzarla.<br>  <br>  Sintio el primer sufrimiento ciertamente. fue la condenacion pero tambien se le dio la esperanza cuando Yehova le hablo sobre la venida de una mujer que quebrantaria la cabeza de la serpiente y daria a luz  al salvador.|`|GsoMShcVaa	para mi todo fue creado en forma perfecta, como nosotros mismos, recuerda existe siempre el libre albedrio y eso es desicion de cada ser fuè mortal, e inmortal en la historia.<br>  <br>  <br>  saludos.|`|15879b7c48017a096a486b21a182680aaa	Y Abel? si no había mas que una Eva? a quien se estaba tirando?|`|2f600969c15b51b425b47b103ecf3855aa	DEBEMOS DE TENER MUCHO CUIDADO CON TEOLOGIAS Y CONCENTRARNOS MAS EN COMO RELACIONARNOS MEJOR CON DIOS PARA QUE NOS DE SABIDURIA PARA ENTENDER SU HERMOSA PALABRA.

Si estamos de acuerdo en que estos primeros inscriben algo propio en la serie que encabezan, podemos concluir que como cualquier humano supo que tuvo responsabilidad, tuvo curiosidad por saber aquello que le estaba vedado por un superior, tuvo rebeldía para trasgredir la norma y valentía para llevar a cabo algo cuyas consecuencias estaba dispuesto a sufrir. Desde mi lugar creo que Adán no hizo más que comprender que la rebeldía y la valentía de Eva tenían un precio y que estaba dispuesto a acompa?arla, porque después de todo, quién le garanizaba que tendría vida eterna ?y si ese ser todopoderoso le estuviera minitiendo sólo para mantenerlo quietito y sin protestar por nada, para tenerlo dominado a él y a la bella Eva?<br>  Creo que entendieron ambos la responsabilidad tremenda que asumían y eligieron darle a la humanidad la posibilidad de disfrutar del conocimiento y la libertad: El conocimiento y la libertad siempre tienen un precio y si eligieron perder la vida eterna a cambio, creo que es el mejor legado que pudieron dar como primeros de la serie.|`|KvAxogDgaa	Adan tenia padre su creador Jehova Dios y fue creado immortal para habitar el paraiso al lado de Eva y poblar la tierra pero por el pecado de Eva se conviertieron en mortales al igual que toda su descendencia osea nosotros nacer, crecer, reproducirse y morir!!

Viendo el panorama general de la humanidad, ahora y siempre, muchos se la han hecho.<br>  En la tradición cristiana, más propiamente en la Biblia, ya muy lejos en el Antiguo Testamento, se menciona en diferentes oportunidades este concepto: el hombre como una criatura extraviada en su razonamiento, actuando en contra del sentido común y de sí mismo.<br>  Precisamente, el mensaje de Jesús parte de esa premisa: todos tenemos la mente corrompida, distorsionada en relación con su naturaleza original, y necesitamos un nuevo nacimiento. Es esa la propuesta que vino a traer Jesús, y no una nueva religión con ídolos y toda clase de falsedades.<br>  La mente normal sería, en ese contexto, aquella cuya motivación principal, preponderante, por no decir exclusiva, sería el amor. El verdadero amor surgiendo naturalmente de lo más profundo del ser, regenerado por el nuevo nacimiento que propuso Jesús.<br>  Una mente sana, no "demente", funcionaría así.<br>  Serían inimaginables la mentira, el robo, el asesinato, el odio, lal maldad en cualquiera de sus formas. No sería necesario el dinero: cada uno trabajaría organizadamente en lo que pueda o sea necesario y cada uno tomaría lo que necesita. No habría guerras, cárceles, hambre ni ningún tipo de sufrimiento. El amor nos motivaría a vivir de una manera plena, cada uno procurando ocuparse en algo útil y positivo para el bien de todos. Al no haber dinero, ejércitos, policías, cárceles, tribunales y todo lo que se hace por seguridad, por prevención contra la maldad de otros, viviríamos plenamente. <br>  Dios es amor, y al vivir así, estaríamos viviendo en comunión con la fuente de vida y paz que es Dios nuetro Creador.<br>  En cambio, somos tan dementes, que la sola idea de pensar en el amor como la fuerza vital que nos mueva a todos nos hace sopechosos de estar locos.<br>  No hay ningún inconveniente en entender que todos los humanos, como raza, somos dementes; y tampoco de cuál es la solución: aceptar el mensaje y la persona de Jesús y experimentar el Nuevo Nacimiento que nos propone.<br>  Saludos.|`|jVKl2u0yaa	Hay muchas personas que nos llevan indicando desde hace milenios que el ser humano es de mente ;-).

El concepto ha sido extendido en ocasiones a los animales y a la inteligencia artificial de las computadoras. Muchas autoridades religiosas han apoyado dicha creencia y mientras que ha sido criticada como una forma de ideología individualista por escritores tales como Baruch Spinoza y Carlos Marx.

Por ejemplo, en la ética puede suponer que los individuos pueden ser responsables de sus propias acciones. En la psicología, implica que la mente controla algunas de las acciones del cuerpo, algunas de las cuales son conscientes. En el reino científico, el libre albedrío se puede percibir en las acciones del cuerpo, incluyendo al cerebro, no siendo determinadas enteramente por la causalidad física.<br>  <br>  La existencia del libre albedrío ha sido un tema central a través de la historia de la filosofía y la ciencia.|`|SDHvDNGJaa	Es la capacidad que tiene el ser humano de elegir una opción.<br>  Saludos!|`|fVQoIFbSaa	El libre albendrio en religion es que somos libres de elegir el camino, la conducta, o la situacion, sin la intervencion de Dios en ello, podemos elegir lo bueno o lo malo|`|kdYpMg1taa	honestamente no se|`|rCYDVjPUaa	No hay verdades absolutas, solo libre albedrio que la toma de desiciones con CONCIENCIA.

Si alguno ama al mundo, el amor del Padre no?está en él; porque todo lo que hay en el mundo —el deseo de la carne y el deseo de los ojos y la exhibición ostentosa del medio de vida de uno— no?se origina del Padre, sino que se origina del mundo”. (1?Juan 2:15,?16.) <br>  <br>  También escribió: “Sabemos que nosotros nos originamos de Dios, pero el mundo entero yace en el poder del inicuo”. (1?Juan 5:19.) Además, Jesús mismo llamó a Satanás “el gobernante de este mundo”. (Juan 12:31; 16:11.)<br>  !Ya está bueno de tanto echarle la culpa a Dios de las cosas que pasan y nos pasan. Cuando se nos muere alguién nos consuelan diciendo "es la voluntad de Dios", !qué clase de consuelo! y cuando sufrimos una desgracia por alguna enfermedad nos dicen" "son pruebas que Dios nos  manda" Que disparate son esos ,no más puras MENTIRAS!!! mira lo que Dios mismo dice respecto a esto buquen y lean y eduquecen .En Santiago 1:13 él nos dice: "?Al estar bajo prueba, que nadie diga: “Dios me somete a prueba”.

Ιω?ννου [apokálypsis Iōannou], 'revelación a Juan' )? es el último libro del Nuevo Testamento. También es conocido como Apocalipsis de Jesucristo por el título que al principio se da a sí mismo (Αποκ?λυψι? ?Ιησο? Χριστο?,...), y en algunos círculos protestantes como Revelación. Por su género literario, es considerado por la mayoria de los eruditos el único libro del Nuevo Testamento de carácter exclusivamente profético. [1]<br>  <br>  El Apocalipsis quizás sea el escrito más rico en símbolos de toda la Biblia. La cantidad de símbolos, eventos y procesos complica la tarea de interpretar la totalidad de la revelacion y como tal, ha sido objeto de numerosas investigaciones, interpretaciones y debate a lo largo de la historia.<br>  Tabla de contenidos<br>  [ocultar]<br>  <br>      * 1 Historia del libro<br>            o 1.1 Autoría<br>            o 1.2 Contexto histórico de su escritura<br>            o 1.3 Canonicidad<br>                  + 1.3.1 Partidarios de la canonicidad del Apocalipsis<br>                  + 1.3.2 Adversarios de la canonicidad del Apocalipsis<br>      * 2 Análisis del libro<br>            o 2.1 Escuelas de interpretación<br>            o 2.2 Estructura<br>                  + 2.2.1 Estructura septenaria del Apocalipsis<br>            o 2.3 Simbología del Apocalipsis<br>                  + 2.3.1 La liturgia<br>                  + 2.3.2 Números y Colores<br>                        # 2.3.2.1 Números<br>                        # 2.3.2.2 Colores<br>                  + 2.3.3 Los septenarios<br>                  + 2.3.4 Personajes y figuras en la simbología del Apocalipsis<br>                        # 2.3.4.1 Los Cuatro Jinetes del Apocalipsis<br>                        # 2.3.4.2 Los 144.000<br>                        # 2.3.4.3 La Bestia y su número<br>                              * 2.3.4.3.1 La primera Bestia y los Dos Testigos<br>                        # 2.3.4.4 Babilonia y la prostituta<br>                        # 2.3.4.5 La Mujer vestida de sol y el Ni?o<br>                        # 2.3.4.6 La Nueva Jerusalén<br>      * 3 Nota<br>      * 4 Véase también<br>      * 5 Referencias<br>      * 6 Enlaces externos<br>  <br>  Historia del libro [editar]<br>  <br>  Autoría [editar]<br>  Artículo principal: Autoría de las obras juaninas<br>  <br>  El autor se identifica a sí mismo dentro del libro solamente como Juan, siervo de Jesucristo y en condición de desterrado en la isla de Patmos (en el mar Egeo) por ser testigo de Jesús.<br>  San Miguel combatiendo al Dragón, de Jean Fouquet<br>  San Miguel combatiendo al Dragón, de Jean Fouquet<br>  <br>  La coincidencia de este nombre con el de Juan el Evangelista y el autor de otros escritos del Nuevo Testamento (NT) es en gran parte la razón por la cual se atribuye el libro de manera tradicional al apóstol San Juan (a quien se le atribuyen también el cuarto Evangelio y tres cartas: 1 Juan, 2 Juan y 3 Juan).<br>  <br>  Sin embargo en el Apocalipsis, el autor sólo menciona su nombre, sin identificarse nunca con el mismo apóstol Juan de los Evangelios, o que se trate siquiera del mismo autor de los otros escritos atribuidos al apóstol.<br>  <br>  De cualquier manera, las investigaciones modernas suelen agrupar los escritos atribuidos a Juan y algunas llegan a afirmar que pertenecen a una comunidad denominada "juanina". Esta postura no indicaría necesariamente la autoría directa del apóstol Juan, pero sí que una comunidad ya sea fundada por él, o fuertemente influenciada por él, sería la que generaría estos documentos (Hahn, 2001). Así, aunque Juan no hubiera escrito de pu?o y letra el Apocalipsis, sería como si lo hubiera hecho a través de esta comunidad.<br>  <br>  Además, asignar como autor de las obras a un personaje de renombre es común en la tradición de la literatura apocalíptica, no para darle un crédito extra pero falso a la obra, sino porque de hecho el autor verdadero se identifica plenamente con el personaje que se marca como autor de la obra (Vanni, 1982: 18-19).<br>  <br>  Contexto histórico de su escritura [editar]<br>  <br>  Históricamente, se sabe que el Apocalipsis fue escrito a finales del siglo I o principios del siglo II (aunque otros historiadores lo ubican en distintas fechas de toda la segunda mitad del siglo I [1]), cuando las persecuciones romanas contra los cristianos se hicieron más cruentas, en tiempos del emperador Domiciano (que fue César del imperio romano a fines del siglo I). Este, como algunos otros emperadores, exigían (ya sea por simple vanidad o como estrategia de coerción a sus súbditos) que sus estatuas fueran adoradas a lo largo de todo el imperio, cosa que los cristianos se negaban a hacer por motivos religiosos: los Césares se autoproclamaban 'Se?or de Se?ores', además de 'hijos de Dios', títulos que los cristianos reservan exclusivamente para Jesucristo. [2]<br>  <br>  Por ello, el Apocalipsis conllevaría también un trasfondo histórico que haría referencias múltiples a estas persecuciones y a los consejos que el autor daría a sus lectores, cristianos, de mantenerse en la fe para soportar las angustias, poniendo la esperanza final de la nueva Jerusalén como premio seguro para los que fueran firmes (Prévost, 2001: 27-32).<br>  <br>  La siguiente es una lista (incompleta) de algunas fechas importantes a tener en cuenta en el contexto histórico de la escritura del Apocalipsis (Prévost, 2001: 27):<br>  <br>      * Década de los a?os 30: muerte (y resurrección para los cristianos) de Jesús.<br>      * A?os 60: probables fechas de las muertes de los apóstoles Simón Pedro y Pablo de Tarso. Persecución de los cristianos bajo el emperador Nerón.<br>      * 70 – 73: destrucción por parte de los romanos del templo de Jerusalén, expulsión de los judíos del territorio de Palestina.<br>      * Luego del a?o 73: los conflictos crecen entre cristianos y judíos. Para los a?os 90, en que probablemente fue escrito el Apocalipsis, la separación es casi completa.<br>      * 81 – 96: Domiciano es emperador de Roma. Impone con fuerza el culto divinizante al emperador. Las persecuciones de cristianos se acrecientan.<br>  <br>  Canonicidad [editar]<br>  <br>  El Apocalipsis es considerado uno de los libros más controvertidos y difíciles de la Biblia, por la multiplicidad de posibles interpretaciones en los significados de nombres, eventos y símbolos que se narran. La admisión de este texto en el canon bíblico del NT no fue nada fácil, la polémica entre los Padres de la Iglesia respecto a la canonicidad del Apocalipsis duró varios siglos.<br>  <br>  Partidarios de la canonicidad del Apocalipsis [editar]<br>  <br>  Al final del siglo II el Apocalipsis fue reconocido por los representantes de las iglesias principales como una obra genuina del apóstol Juan. En Asia, Melitón, obispo de Sardes, reconoció el Apocalipsis de Juan y escribió un comentario sobre él (Eusebio de Cesarea, Historia Eclesiástica, IV, 26). En la Galia, Ireneo de Lyon creía firmemente en su autoridad divina y apostólica (Adversus Haer., V, 30). En áfrica, Tertuliano citó frecuentemente el Apocalipsis sin dudas aparentes sobre su autenticidad (Contra Marción, III, 14, 25). En Roma, el obispo Hipólito asignó su autoría al apóstol Juan, y el Fragmento Muratoriano lo enumera junto con las otras escrituras canónicas. La Vetus Latina contenía el Apocalipsis. En Alejandría, Clemente y Orígenes creían sin vacilación en su autoría joánica. Orígenes aceptaba el Apocalipsis como inspirado, y lo catalogaba como parte del Homologoumena. Atanasio, obispo de Alejandría, lo reconoció plenamente en su carta pascual 39 en el a?o 367.<br>  <br>  En occidente, el libro fue definitivamente aceptado por el decreto del papa Dámaso I, en el a?o 382, confirmado luego en los concilios de Hipona (en el 393) y de Cartago (en el 397), junto con todos los demás escritos del NT. En oriente, fue incluido en el canon después de mucha polémica (que se prolongó hasta el siglo IX) aunque es el único libro del NT que no es leído como parte de la liturgia en la Iglesia Ortodoxa.<br>  <br>  Adversarios de la canonicidad del Apocalipsis [editar]<br>  <br>  Algunos, como el romano Cayo, a principios del siglo III rechazaron el Apocalipsis por fomentar el milenarismo. El antagonista más importante de la autoridad del Apocalipsis fue Dionisio, obispo de Alejandría, discípulo de Orígenes. él no se oponía a la idea de que Cerinto era el escritor del Apocalipsis como se puede leer en su obra Sobre las promesas:<br>  <br>      "Esta es la doctrina que ense?aba Cerinto: el reino de Cristo será terrenal. Y como amaba el cuerpo y era del todo carnal, imaginaba que iba a encontrar aquellas satisfacciones a las que anhelaba, las del vientre y del bajo vientre, es decir del comer, del beber, del matrimonio: en medio de fiestas, sacrificios e inmolaciones de víctimas sagradas, mediante lo cual intentó hacer más aceptables tales tesis".<br>  <br>  Otro discípulo de Orígenes, Eusebio de Cesarea discrepaba de su maestro alejandrino al rechazar el Apocalipsis como no bíblico, aunque se vio obligado a reconocer su casi universal aceptación. Afirmó lo siguiente:<br>  <br>      "El Apocalipsis es aceptado por algunos entre los libros canónicos, pero otros lo rechazan." (Historia Eclesiástica, III, 25).<br>  <br>  Cirilo de Jerusalén no lo nombró entre los libros canónicos; tampoco aparece en la lista del Sínodo de Laodicea, o en la de Gregorio de Nacianzo. Otro argumento en contra de la paternidad apostólica del libro es su omisión de la versión Peshita, la Vulgata siria en arameo.<br>  <br>  En el siglo IV, san Juan Crisóstomo y otros obispos argumentaban contra la inclusión de este libro en el canon del NT, sobre todo debido a las dificultades que planteaba su interpretación y el peligro latente que podía entra?ar. Los cristianos de Siria también lo rechazaron debido a que los montanistas se apoyaban mucho en él.<br>  <br>  En el siglo IX, fue incluido junto con el Apocalipsis de Pedro entre los libros "discutidos" de la Stichometría de san Nicéforo, patriarca de Constantinopla.<br>  <br>  Martín Lutero consideraba que el Apocalipsis "no es ni apostólico ni profético", y decía que "Cristo no se ense?a ni se sabe de él aquí". (Tratado de Lutero de libros discutidos del NT (en inglés))<br>  <br>  Análisis del libro [editar]<br>  <br>  La lectura del libro del Apocalipsis se puede hacer a varios niveles (literal, simbólico, por su género literario, con el contexto histórico en que fue escrito, por el mensaje de fondo del que habla, etc.) Según Prévost (2001: 5-9) es necesario comprender todos estos niveles para entender el libro del Apocalipsis y para evitar entenderlo solamente desde la perspectiva de actitudes de los movimientos apocalípticos que se centran únicamente en el terror que causaría un supuesto fin del mundo: [3]<br>  <br>      * Una lectura literal del libro puede dejar distintas impresiones en el lector, pero es importante no quedarse solamente en este nivel, sino profundizar más para una mejor comprensión. El uso de los detalles literales permiten decifrar una situacion en su totalidad. Actualmente hay un enfoque hacia la revelacion de un tema y la metodologia que hizo posible la creacion del texto. Implica que cuando un comentarista expone sobre la revelacion de Juan, tiene que exponer el criterio y la metodolgia usada.<br>      * El nivel de género literario es muy importante, pues permite ubicar al Apocalipsis dentro del contexto de otros libros (bíblicos y no bíblicos) que con una estructura o simbología similar puedan dar luz para entender lo que el autor del libro en realidad haya querido decir al escribirlo. El Apocalipsis de Juan pertenece de hecho al género Apocalíptico, aunque presenta algunas características que lo diferencian del resto de la literatura apocalíptica.[4]<br>      * El nivel histórico permite también ubicar la época del autor, junto con las crisis y sucesos que podrían haber influido en la escritura tanto del libro en general, como de ciertos pasajes particulares [2].<br>      * A nivel simbólico es posible entender también lo que para el autor representarían los numerosos símbolos que aparecen en el libro.<br>      * Es importante no olvidar que, en último término, el libro es un escrito cristiano, y que como tal, lleva implícito el mensaje que se encuentra en los Evangelios, centrado en la figura de Jesucristo. [5]<br>  <br>  Igualmente, se pueden incluir análisis que contemplen la estructura desde el punto de vista del idioma en que fue escrito el libro (griego). (Vanni, 1971: 236-247; Vanni, 1982: 12)<br>  <br>  Escuelas de interpretación [editar]<br>  <br>  Según (Hahn, 2001), básicamente existen cuatro escuelas interpretativas del contenido del Apocalipsis, a saber:<br>  <br>      * Preterista. Subraya el cumplimiento de las profecías del Apocalipsis durante el siglo I. [6] Tiende a identificar a los personajes del libro con personajes históricos de la época del siglo I.<br>      * Idealista. Ve al Apocalipsis como una alegoría del combate espiritual entre el bien y el mal que debe tener todo fiel.<br>      * Futurista. Conlleva la identificación de los personajes del Apocalipsis con distintos personajes que han surgido a lo largo de la historia humana, como la identificación de las Bestias del Apocalipsis con Napoleón Bonaparte, Hitler o Stalin, etc.<br>      * Historicista. Sostiene que el Apocalipsis expone el plan maestro de Dios para la historia, de principio a fin, incluyendo la historia particular de la Iglesia. [7]<br>  <br>  Para Hahn, todas estas escuelas tienen su razón de ser y su parte de veracidad, y aunque dicho autor favorece ante todo la visión preterista, no rechaza del todo ninguna de las otras escuelas.<br>  <br>  Según (Vanni, 1982), desde esta misma perspectiva el mensaje de todo el libro del Apocalipsis puede actualizarse a la época de cualquier creyente cristiano, o más bien de cualquier comunidad de creyentes cristianos (pues todas las citas del libro están siempre dirigidas a un grupo de gente, no a alguien aislado). Y así desde la perspectiva preterista, la Babilonia que podría haber representado para el autor la Roma perdida, una ciudad dominadora, consumista, pagana, podría representar hoy en día un sin número de situaciones particulares similares, pero teniendo cuidado de discernir adecuadamente cuáles son esas situaciones y de no llevar la interpretación al extremo de la identificación (es decir, en una especie de perspectiva futurista pero sin rayar en la identificación, evitando pensar que el Apocalipsis hubiera sido escrito explícitamente para "predecir" los hechos de alguna época y nada más). Por eso dentro del Apocalipsis el libro de los siete sellos no lo interpreta, ni lo puede interpretar o siquiera abrir, cualquiera, sólo el Cordero (Ap 5:1-8), como diciéndole a la comunidad, que siempre el Cordero debe ser su criterio de discernimiento. (Vanni, 1982: 137-139)<br>  <br>  Además, se pueden reconocer muchas otras escuelas de interpretación del Apocalipsis, como la visión esotérica y la propia de Iglesias como la Católica, la Ortodoxa oriental, la Anglicana o la Mormona, algunas de las cuales incluyen elementos de las otras escuelas (de las anteriormente citadas y las de otras Iglesias), pero se encuentran bien definidas en sus doctrinas y por eso se diferencian.<br>  <br>  Estructura [editar]<br>  Las Visiones de Juan el Evangelista, de Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry<br>  Las Visiones de Juan el Evangelista, de Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry<br>  <br>  En primer lugar, se puede ver al Apocalipsis como compuesto por cuatro partes:<br>  <br>     1. Introducción y Cartas a las Iglesias (Ap 1-3). El contenido de la salutación está dirigido a una jurisdicción eclesiástica y representa una comunicación oficial de un dirigente a su cargo. Siguiendo el ejemplo de otros libros de la epoca, su distribución es local y luego de su inclusión en el canon, es distribuido a toda iglesia. Como si fuera una epístola (pero sin serlo), se podría reconocer aquí a los destinatarios del libro.<br>     2. El Cordero y los Siete Sellos y Trompetas (Ap 4-11). Se ven aquí muchos símbolos que hacen alusión a la liturgia cristiana primitiva, y para Prévost (Prévost, 2001: 28) es también una forma de definirse frente al judaísmo.<br>     3. El Dragón y el combate (Ap 12-20). La historia se vuelca ahora a un combate cósmico para explicar el sentido de la historia, y para Prévost (Prévost, 2001: 28) a la vez simboliza el enfrentamiento de los primeros cristianos con el imperio romano.<br>     4. La Nueva Jerusalén (Ap 21-22). De forma conclusiva, como una despedida al final del libro, se menciona la esperanza que guía a todo el libro.<br>  <br>  El libro del Apocalipsis presenta también secciones bien diferenciadas, en las que los símbolos cambian entre una y otra, aunque conservando un mensaje principal idéntico de esperanza:<br>  <br>      * Introducción y Presentación (Ap 1). Presenta la visión de todo el libro e introduce la siguiente sección (el mensaje a las Iglesias) como venido de parte de un ...hombre de larga túnica, cuyos cabellos eran blancos. En su mano tenía siete estrellas y de su boca salía una espada de doble filo..., en referencia a Cristo resucitado.<br>      * El mensaje a las Iglesias (Ap 2-3). Es una serie de evaluaciones, buenas y malas, a siete comunidades, que terminan con un reto y la inspiracion para vencer. Las comunidades tienen una relación específica en la época del autor. [8]<br>      * Las Teofanías de Dios (Ap 4). Se presenta un conjunto de símbolos que representan la majestad de Dios, haciendo alusión a las teofanías más importantes del Antiguo Testamento: la zarza ardiente, el monte Sinaí, la vocación de Isaías y la visión de Ezequiel en el río Quebar.<br>      * El Cordero (Ap 5). Se presenta, en contraste pero en unidad con la sección anterior, la humildad y poder del Cordero (Cristo), como el único que es capaz de entender al principio el designio de Dios y por lo tanto abrir el libro de los siete sellos (sección siguiente).<br>      * Los Siete Sellos (Ap 6-8). En esta sección abundan los símbolos numéricos y cromáticos. La sección comienza con la famosa descripción de los Cuatro Jinetes del Apocalipsis, que llevan numerosas plagas a la humanidad. Durante la apertura de cada sello, se desarrollan también las visiones de cataclismos naturales, que concluyen con el Juicio Final.<br>      * Las Siete Trompetas (Ap 8-11). Con la apertura del séptimo sello, comienza el desarrollo de un nuevo simbolismo numérico de catástrofes anunciadas por 7 trompetas, y el surgimiento de una primera Bestia que guerrea con dos Testigos.<br>      * El Dragón y las Bestias (Ap 12-13). Después, en un cambio del hilo de la historia, se narra el surgimiento del Dragón que combate con una Mujer que da a luz a un Ni?o. Después, el Dragón convoca a dos Bestias que lo sirven.<br>      * Los Vencedores (Ap 14-15). Entran en escena los que serán vencedores del Dragón y las Bestias. Aunque en esta parte no se indica aún que los venzan, sí se indica que están de parte del Cordero, y que de hecho éste los dirige, dispuestos a vencer.<br>      * Las Siete Copas (Ap 16). De nuevo en un simbolismo numérico, se habla de catástrofes, y de la batalla final que comienza con la reunion de los ejercitos en un lugar llamado Armaguedón.<br>      * La Prostituta y la caída de Babilonia (Ap 17-19). Entra en escena la Prostituta que viene de Babilonia, y que estando del lado de las Bestias y del Dragón es vencida. Entra entonces en escena Cristo montado en un caballo blanco y las Bestias son capturadas y echadas al lago de fuego.<br>      * La Derrota (Ap 20). Se menciona que el Dragón queda encerrado por mil a?os luego de la victoria de la sección anterior y que al final volverá a salir reuniendo a las naciones para ser vencido de nuevo, esta vez de manera definitiva. [9]<br>      * La nueva Jerusalén (Ap 21-22). La visión concluye con esperanza: la tierra y el cielo son hechos de nuevo, Jerusalén, como símbolo de la ciudad de Dios, es toda la Tierra donde ahora Dios habita directamente en medio de todos los hombres. El libro, y por lo tanto la Biblia cristiana concluyen con una bendición y una petición que apremian a Jesús a volver pronto.<br>  <br>  Estructura septenaria del Apocalipsis [editar]<br>  <br>  La estructura del Apocalipsis se puede ver también de acuerdo a septenarios: dividido en 7 grupos, cada grupo a su vez puede subdividirse en subgrupos de 7 junto con preludios, interludios y otros excursos (L?pple, 1970):<br>  <br>      * Título del libro y prólogo (Ap 1:1-3)<br>  <br>  1. Las siete cartas a las Iglesias (Ap 1:4-3:22)<br>  <br>          * Destinatarios (Ap 1:4-8)<br>          * Visión preliminar (Cristo resucitado) (Ap 1:9-20)<br>  <br>     1. Carta a la Iglesia de éfeso (Ap 2:1-7)<br>     2. Carta a la Iglesia de Esmirna (Ap 2:8-11)<br>     3. Carta a la Iglesia de Pérgamo (Ap 2:12-17)<br>     4.

La parte penitencial (la que pide y mueve a conversión) serían las cartas a las Iglesias (Ap 2-3), mientras que el resto del libro hablaría a la comunidad sobre la necesidad de hacerse actora en la historia, llena, sí, de malos momentos, pero siempre acompa?ada del Cordero (Vanni, 1982: 127). Para (Hahn, 2001) prácticamente todos los elementos de la celebración del sacramento de la Eucaristía en la Iglesia Católica son tomados de una u otra forma de figuras del Apocalipsis, convirtiendo así al libro en una especie de guía figurada de la liturgia cristiana primitiva.<br>  <br>  Por último, la liturgia se ve reflejada en muchos símbolos a lo largo de los pasajes del libro. Por ejemplo, las oraciones. Al inicio estas se presentan ante el trono de Dios en copas (Ap 5:7-8), tal vez inmerecidas, pero purificándolas un ángel con incienso, adquieren su valor y su fuerza verdaderos (Ap 8:3-5). Y precisamente estas mismas copas son las que posteriormente llevan ahora la furia de Dios (ver el septenario de las copas), una respuesta a las oraciones de los cristianos (los consagrados y los santos que elevaron en un principio sus oraciones). (Vanni, 1982: 143-148)<br>  <br>  (Hahn, 2001) muestra la siguiente tabla, en la que el autor empareja varios pasajes del Apocalipsis con partes definidas de la Eucaristía:<br>  Culto dominical   Ap 1:10<br>  Sumo Sacerdote   Ap 1:13<br>  Altar   Ap 8:3-4,11:1,14:18<br>  Sacerdotes (presbyteroi o ancianos)   Ap 4:4,11:16,14:3,19:4<br>  Ornamentos   Ap 1:13,4:4,6:11,7:9,15:6,19:13-14<br>  Célibes consagrados   Ap 14:4<br>  Candeleros, o menoráh   Ap 1:12,2:5<br>  Penitencia   Ap 2,3<br>  Incienso   Ap 5:8,8:3-5<br>  Libro o rollo   Ap 5:1<br>  Hostia eucarística   Ap 2:17<br>  Cálices   Ap 16,15:7,21:9<br>  La se?al de la cruz (la tau)   Ap 7:3,14:1,22:4<br>  El Gloria   Ap 15:3-4<br>  El Aleluya   Ap 19:1;3;4;6<br>  Levantemos el corazón   Ap 11:12<br>  ?Santo, santo, santo?

Muchos de los significados de estos símbolos son, de hecho, propios de la literatura apocalíptica, no solamente de este libro (Prévost, 2001: 53,60).<br>  <br>  Números [editar]<br>  <br>  Prévost (2001: 39-43) menciona que los distintos números mencionados en el Apocalipsis tienen siempre un carácter simbólico. El significado de los números se daría en función del sentido que los cristianos de la época del siglo I les darían, y que estarían directamente influenciados por los significados que los judíos le darían a muchos de esos números:<br>  <br>      * Uno. Normalmente se usa para referirse a Dios. (p.ej. Ap 4:2)<br>      * Un medio, tres y medio. Parece ser que estos números están directamente heredados del libro de Daniel; representan un tiempo limitado y restringido, que no llegaría a ser uno (que significa la plenitud de Dios) o cuatro (que significa la plenitud del universo), incluso por ser la mitad de siete (la perfección). El tres y medio se ve reflejado también en la frase un tiempo, tiempos y medio tiempo. Los mil doscientos sesenta días mencionados en el libro, así como los cuarenta y dos meses, son equivalentes a tres a?os y medio. (p.ej. Ap 8:1;11:2-3,9,11;12:6,14)<br>      * Cuatro. Se puede referir a todo el Universo, o Creación (por los cuatro puntos cardinales), e igualmente se aplica a los cuatro Vivientes que se encuentran con Dios al inicio de la visión, y que muchos identifican con los cuatro evangelistas (aunque esto último no necesariamente es cierto [12]). Sin embargo, con base en el simbolismo de toda la Creación, los cuatro vivientes que están con Dios podrían representar más bien el dominio que tiene Dios sobre toda la Creación y la relación que esta tiene con su Creador. (Vanni 1982: 50-51) (p.ej. Ap 4:6-8;7:1;20:8)<br>      * Seis. En algunos contextos denota imperfección, pues le falta uno para llegar a la cifra perfecta (ver símbolo siguiente) (p.ej. Ap 13:18); sin embargo, cada uno de los cuatro Vivientes que están junto al trono tienen seis alas.<br>      * Siete. Para los judíos, el número siete denota la perfección. Este número está presente en muchos libros del AT y del NT, siempre con el mismo significado. [13] (p.ej. Ap 1:4,12,16;4:5 y los septenarios)<br>      * Doce. Representa en primer lugar a las doce tribus de Israel, y por extensión al pueblo de Dios. De forma cristiana entonces, este número representa a los cristianos (que según su interpretación son el nuevo pueblo de Dios), en particular representados por el número de los apóstoles (p.ej. Ap 12:1;21:12,14,20,21). Otros números directamente influenciados por el doce son el veinticuatro (24 = 12 x 2), el cuarenta y ocho (48 = 12 x 4) y el ciento cuarenta y cuatro (144 = 12 x 12). (p.ej. Ap 4:4,10;5:8;7:4-8;11:16;19:4)<br>      * Mil. Este número no representaría la cantidad exacta de 1000, sino la idea general de un gran número (por ejemplo, los mil a?os de encierro del Dragón antes de que se vuelva a levantar y sea vencido para siempre (Ap 20), no representarían un período de exactamente mil a?os sino solamente la idea general de mucho tiempo). (p.ej. Ap 5:11;7:4-8;20:2-7)<br>  <br>  Igualmente, muchos otros números aparecen en el libro, que siguiendo la interpretación de la literatura apocalíptica, tienen también un significado simbólico. El tres por ejemplo puede representar a Dios, y aunque para los judíos de por sí el número tres ya es representativo de la divinidad, desde el punto de vista cristiano también lo hace tomando en cuenta la Trinidad Padre, Hijo y Espíritu Santo. Por otro lado en el Apocalipsis, el tres aparece como una fracción, en vez de como el número entero (una tercera parte, un tercio, indicando también que ni es el Uno pleno de Dios, ni el Cuatro pleno de la Creación, y que dos tercios no se ven afectados por lo que la tercera parte sí lo es). Aparecen también otros números como el dos, el diez, entre otros.<br>  <br>  Colores [editar]<br>  <br>  Los colores también juegan un papel importante y tendrían un significado propio (Prévost, 2001: 37-38).<br>  <br>      * Blanco. Pureza, victoria. (p.ej. Ap 1:14;4:4;19:14;20:11)<br>      * *****. Desgracia, miseria. (p.ej. Ap 6:5,12)<br>      * Rojo. Violencia. (p.ej. Ap 6:4;9:17;12:3)<br>      * Verde o Amarillo. Muerte. (p.ej. Ap 6:8)<br>      * Púrpura. Desenfreno. (p.ej. Ap 17:4;18:12,16)<br>      * Escarlata. Desenfreno. (p.ej. Ap 17:3-4;18:12,16)<br>  <br>  Los septenarios [editar]<br>  El Cordero con el libro de los siete sellos, folio 13v del Apocalipsis Bamberg<br>  El Cordero con el libro de los siete sellos, folio 13v del Apocalipsis Bamberg<br>  <br>  El libro del Apocalipsis contiene series del número 7 a lo largo de todo su corpus. Las más notorias se encuentran por la relación que guardan entre sí los tres septenarios de sellos, trompetas y copas.<br>  <br>  El septenario de los sellos (Ap 4-8:2) se da conforme el Cordero va abriendo uno a uno los sellos de un libro que nadie podía abrir excepto él. [14] Antes de romper los sellos la visión se encuentra en el cielo, con las teofanías de Dios y el Cordero y la alegría que causa que éste sea capaz de abrir el libro. Los primeros cuatro sellos originan a los jinetes del Apocalipsis. Los sellos 5 y 6 originan cataclismos. Después del sexto sello se da una visión de esperanza (los 144.000) y con el séptimo sello comienza el siguiente septenario: las trompetas, y con ellas en realidad todo el resto del libro que concluye con la visión final de la Nueva Jerusalén.<br>  <br>  El septenario de las trompetas (Ap 8-11) comienza con una visión celeste de esperanza (básicamente los mismos 144.000 que vienen antes del séptimo sello que coincide con la primer trompeta), después se tocan las trompetas, acompa?adas de cataclismos. Luego de la sexta trompeta, viene una visión de esperanza (el ángel y el librito, los dos testigos). Al tocarse la séptima trompeta, hay un cántico de victoria.<br>  <br>  El septenario de las copas (Ap 15-22) aparece un poco después. De nuevo, comienza con una visión celeste de esperanza (los Vencedores). Después las copas se derraman, acompa?adas de cataclismos. Luego de la sexta copa, aunque sumergido en un ambiente de derrota, viene una promesa de esperanza. La conclusión de este septenario, luego de derramar la séptima copa comienza con la presentación de la Prostituta de Babilonia, pero nótese que inmediatamente comienza su declive, e in crescendo desemboca hasta la visión gloriosa del final del libro.<br>  <br>  Así pues, los tres septenarios más importantes del Apocalipsis tienen aproximadamente la misma estructura: una visión celeste que es preludio de la esperanza, una serie de cataclismos terrestres, luego del sexto símbolo hay un interludio de esperanza y al finalizar el séptimo símbolo hay un triunfo total de salvación. (Prévost 2001: 102)<br>  <br>  Otros septenarios del libro, algunos un tanto velados, se encuentran en las iglesias a las que se dirige el autor (7, Ap 1:4), que son las mismas a las que se dirigen las cartas a las Iglesias de los capítulos 2 y 3; en las bienaventuranzas mencionadas (7, Ap 1:3;14:13;16:15;19:9;20:6;22:7;22:14); en las aclamaciones litúrgicas a Cristo (7, Ap 1:4-7;5:9-10;5:12;5:13;7:10;11:15;19:6-7... en los espíritus que están ante el trono de Jesucristo (7, Ap 1:4), etc.<br>  <br>  En este contexto, también se puede analizar la estructura del Apocalipsis de acuerdo a septenarios.<br>  <br>  Personajes y figuras en la simbología del Apocalipsis [editar]<br>  <br>  Conjuntando el significado de la diversa simbología del Apocalipsis, se pueden encontrar dentro del mismo una variedad de personajes y figuras frecuentemente analizadas y estudiadas. Además del librito (ver nota), del Arca de la Alianza (ver nota) y de los componentes de los septenarios (los 7 sellos, las 7 trompetas y las 7 copas), en orden de aparición algunas de las figuras del Apocalipsis son:<br>  <br>  Los Cuatro Jinetes del Apocalipsis [editar]<br>  Artículo principal: Los cuatro jinetes del Apocalipsis<br>  Los cuatro jinetes del Apocalipsis, de Alberto Durero<br>  Los cuatro jinetes del Apocalipsis, de Alberto Durero<br>  <br>  (Ap 6:1-8) La imagen de caballos se ve en el libro de Zacarias, se establece que son enviados por Dios. Montando cada uno un caballo con un color característico, estos jinetes llevan plagas a toda la humanidad (recordando que el número 4 representa a toda la Creación, por lo que las plagas se extenderían entonces por toda la Tierra). Recordando el significado de los colores, la interpretación más común de lo que cada jinete representa sería la siguiente:<br>  <br>      * Caballo rojo, ese color representa la sangre y la guerra.<br>      * Caballo *****, representa el hambre.<br>      * Caballo verde o amarillento, representa la muerte, o para otros la enfermedad.<br>      * Caballo blanco, representa para algunos la muerte, por el hecho de que vence siempre, pero para otros, por el color, por el hecho de que porta una corona [15] y por el hecho de que los cristianos no creen que la muerte sea invencible, representaría más bien a Cristo (o a un jinete en su representación), haciendo referencia también a Ap 19:11-21, donde vuelve a aparecer el caballo blanco, con Cristo montándolo. (Prévost 2001: 38; Vanni, 1982: 53-54)<br>  <br>  Los 144.000 [editar]<br>  El juicio final, de Miguel ángel Buonarroti<br>  El juicio final, de Miguel ángel Buonarroti<br>  <br>  (Ap 7:4-8) Hay que notar primero que 144.000 = 12 x 12 x 1000, es decir, recordando el significado de los números, una gran cantidad (1000), multiplicada por la totalidad (al cuadrado, es decir, todavía más grande) del pueblo de Dios.<br>  <br>  Esta cifra puede interpretarse literalmente a partir del libro del Apocalipsis como el número de las personas que quedarían salvadas al final, pero leyendo más adelante, se puede leer lo siguiente: ...vi luego también una multitud que nadie podía contar, de toda nación, raza y lengua... (Ap 7:9-17), lo que se puede interpretar también como el hecho de que el número 144.000 no sería exacto ni literal, sino solamente representativo.<br>  <br>  El total de 144.000 se da por la suma de doce mil miembros de cada tribu del pueblo de Israel. Según Prévost (2001: 105-106) existe una curiosidad en este listado de las tribus, que no aparece en cualquier otro listado de las tribus de Israel en toda la Biblia. En primer lugar aparece la tribu de Judá, como sería lógico para quien tiene claro de donde viene el Mesías según las profecías del AT. Después viene la tribu de Rubén, que siendo hermano mayor de Judá no prevaleció. Por otra parte no aparece la tribu de Dan [16] que en otros listados sí aparece, y sí aparece la de Manasés, que en otros listados no aparece. Y después, la parte más extra?a, si se recuerda que las tribus de Israel están asociadas a los 12 hijos de Jacob, y que este tuvo sus doce hijos a partir de varias esposas: dos esclavas y dos no esclavas. Por lo general, uno esperaría, como de hecho sucede en los otros listados, que primero se enlisten los hijos de las esposas no esclavas, y por último los de las esclavas. En el listado del Apocalipsis, después de mencionar a Judá y Rubén, se enlistan primero las tribus de los hijos de las esclavas y al último el resto. [17]<br>  <br>  La Bestia y su número [editar]<br>  <br>  (Ap 13) Este es uno de los símbolos más famosos heredados del libro del Apocalipsis. El número seiscientos sesenta y seis se suele identificar con el Diablo (aunque aquí el Dragón del Apocalipsis es más representativo del mismo) o con el Anticristo.<br>  <br>  En el Apocalipsis sin embargo, únicamente se menciona esta cifra una vez (Ap 13:18), para decir que es el número de una de las Bestias que sirven al Dragón (y después se le asocia con la marca de la Bestia que llevarían todos aquellos que concuerden con el Dragón y las Bestias). Hay que recordar primero que el significado del número 6 es de imperfección (por faltarle una unidad para la perfección del número 7), y el número 666 representaría entonces una imperfección llevada hasta el extremo.<br>  <br>  Hay autores que, buscando identificar el número 666 con un personaje histórico de la época en que fue escrito el libro, intentan encontrar un juego numérico (conocido como gematría) con las letras del alfabeto griego (idioma en que fue escrito el libro) que pudiera dar la equivalencia para reconocer con este número a la principal Bestia del Apocalipsis. Estos juegos eran comunes a la época de la escritura del Apocalipsis, y se han encontrado vestigios de ellos también en otros escritos. Se asigna a cada letra (alfa, beta, gamma, ..., psi, omega) un número: las primeras del 1 al 10 (excepto el 6), luego de diez en diez hasta el 80, luego el 100 y de cien en cien hasta el 800. Una palabra o frase conocida tenía entonces un número asociado al sumar las cifras equivalentes a cada letra; el inverso de este juego consiste en dar un número (como es el caso del 666 del Apocalipsis) y tratar de identificar qué palabra o frase cumple también con estas características. Siguiendo este juego numérico, se puede llegar a concluir que el número representaría a Domiciano, que persiguió a los cristianos en la época de la escritura del Apocalipsis, o en general a los Césares romanos que se autoproclamaban dioses y que exigían a sus súbditos que así fueran adoradas sus estatuas. (Prévost 2001: 45-49)<br>  <br>  Algunas investigaciones también concluyen que el número 666 dado en este pasaje del Apocalipsis es erróneo, ya que existen algunas versiones del libro que datan del siglo II o III y que tienen como número de la Bestia al seiscientos dieciséis (y con el cual a través de los mismos juegos numéricos se podría relacionar a varios Césares romanos, por ejemplo Calígula, emperador romano caracterizado por su crueldad). (Prévost, 2001: 46,48)<br>  <br>  Igualmente que con otros símbolos del Apocalipsis, hay muchas otras interpretaciones que identifican a la Bestia con personajes de distinta índole a lo largo de la historia (y que a través de otros juegos ingeniosos reconocen al 666 apocalíptico con ellos). Hay incluso interpretaciones que identifican al 666 con fechas. En los últimos a?os han surgido interpretaciones, que cada vez ha ido ganando más adeptos, que identifican el 666, no con una persona ni un ser vivo, sino con un objeto, como por ejemplo el Internet. En contra de estas teorías, cabe aducir que el libro del Apocalipsis especifica que el número 666 se refiere "a un número de hombre", no a una fecha o cosa: "Aquí hay sabiduría: El que tiene entendimiento, cuente el número de la bestia, pues es número de hombre. Y su número es seiscientos sesenta y seis" (Ap 13:18).<br>  Véase también: Marca de la bestia#El 666 y su identificación con Internet<br>  <br>  La primera Bestia y los Dos Testigos [editar]<br>  <br>      Otros manejan la posibilidad de identificar a la Bestia a la que históricamente se referiría el autor del Apocalipsis, con el emperador Nerón, que para la época de la redacción del libro, aún dejaría un recuerdo de las torturas y persecuciones de su época. Tomando la frase 'Nerón César', en hebreo, considerando únicamente las consonantes y tomando números de acuerdo a una numeración del alfabeto hebreo, similar a la anterior, la suma daría de nuevo el famoso número 666. [3]<br>  <br>      Dentro del libro del Apocalipsis se menciona que una primera Bestia mata a dos Testigos de Dios en una ciudad (los cuales por cierto luego de muertos de todas maneras siguen hablando) (Ap 11). La descripción de dos testigos va de acuerdo con la ley judía que establece que sólo se acepta el testimonio de dos testigos. Algunos han querido reconocer en estos dos Testigos a los apóstoles Pedro y Pablo, muertos durante la época de Nerón. Sin embargo, en el Apocalipsis no se reconoce que esta primera Bestia sea la misma que la del número 666.<br>  <br>      Para (Hahn, 2001), los dos testigos representan al profeta Elías y a Moisés, personajes en quienes a su vez se personificaría toda la Ley y los Profetas del AT.<br>  <br>  Juan recibe el Apocalipsis de Hans Memling<br>  Juan recibe el Apocalipsis de Hans Memling<br>  <br>  Babilonia y la prostituta [editar]<br>  Artículo principal: Prostituta de Babilonia<br>  <br>  (Ap 17) Para Prévost (2001: 32,124), en este símbolo podría verse la alusión política que en la época de la escritura del libro, el autor haría de sus enemigos:<br>  <br>  Antes de nada, debe recordarse que para los judíos la ciudad de Babilonia representa el exilio, luego de que los babilonios exiliaron a la élite de la sociedad judía de Jerusalén en al a?o 587 adC. Igualmente, significa para ellos la perversión de las costumbres judías, que se fueron mezclando con elementos de idolatría en esa ciudad, pecado fuertemente condenado por ellos. Así pues, Babilonia representa tanto el poder dominador extranjero, como la idolatría.<br>  <br>  Por eso en el Apocalipsis (igual que en otros libros del NT), Babilonia se suele identificar (siguiendo la línea de estas mismas investigaciones) con la Roma imperial que perseguía a los cristianos y que les exigía idolatrar al César como un dios. De hecho en el Apocalipsis, en la descripción de Babilonia con sus siete montes, podría reconocerse a la ciudad de Roma. La prostituta del Apocalipsis tendría entonces el mismo significado de perversión, idolatría y desenfreno característicos de la alta sociedad romana de ese entonces.<br>  <br>  Por otra parte, otros identifican a Babilonia con la Jerusalén de los judíos (que igualmente tiene siete montes), y que contrasta fuertemente con la Nueva Jerusalén del final del libro. (Por ejemplo (Hahn, 2001), que centra gran parte de su interpretación de las catástrofes del Apocalipsis en una analogía con la caída de Jerusalén en el a?o 70, y también [4])<br>  <br>  <br>  Existen muchas otras interpretaciones sobre la identidad de esta ciudad calificada de perversa, desde el papado católico, hasta una pléyade de ciudades y personalidades según se han presentado a lo largo de la historia.<br>  <br>  La Mujer vestida de sol y el Ni?o [editar]<br>  <br>  (Ap 12) La ... mujer revestida del sol, la luna bajos sus pies y en la cabeza una corona de doce estrellas aparece en el Apocalipsis como la que engendra al Ni?o que el Dragón quiere combatir. Este ni?o es 'raptado' al cielo para después reinar, así que el Dragón se vuelca a combatir contra la Mujer y luego contra el resto de su decendencia.<br>  <br>  Para Prévost (2001: 108), la clave para reconocer a la Mujer se encuentra primero en reconocer al Ni?o. Desde una perspectiva que considera al Apocalipsis como completamente cristocéntrico, se puede interpretar entonces que el Ni?o representaría efectivamente a Cristo. [18]<br>  <br>  Desde una perspectiva de la mariología, se vería en esta Mujer un símbolo de la Virgen María. Sin embargo, son muchos los grupos cristianos (de diversas Iglesias, incluidos algunos católicos), que interpretan en este símbolo al pueblo de Dios, que antes del nacimiento de Jesús representaría al Israel fiel [19], y después a los cristianos. Incluso la postura marianista, no dejando atrás el hecho de que la Mujer sería efectivamente María, lo hace siempre desde la perspectiva eclesiológica, de comunidad. (Prévost 2001: 107-108)<br>  <br>  Para algunas corrientes protestantes el ni?o representaría a una sección minoritaria de la Iglesia que sería arrebatada al cielo antes de que comiencen los juicios del Apocalipsis (Ap 12:5), mientras que la gran mayoría de la cristiandad se quedaría en la tierra a sufrir la persecución, y ellos serían el resto de sus hijos (Ap 12:17).<br>  <br>  La Nueva Jerusalén [editar]<br>  <br>  (Ap 21-22) Este símbolo, presente en los últimos dos capítulos del Apocalipsis, se encuentra para muchos dentro de los mejores descritos, detallados y bellos del Nuevo Testamento. Con una triple recurrencia, el autor habla de la salvación de Dios al final de los tiempos.<br>  <br>      * Primero con la nueva Jerusalén propiamente dicha, que desciende del cielo a la Tierra. (Ap 21:1-8)<br>      * Después con las bodas del Cordero y su Esposa (la Iglesia). (Ap 21:9-27)<br>      * Por último con una visión que recuerda a los primeros capítulos del Génesis (el primer libro en la Biblia), hablando de ríos y árboles que dan fruto eterno. [20] (Ap 22:1-5)<br>  <br>  Para Prévost (Prévost, 2001: 116), esta parte (junto con el capítulo 20) es la única que en realidad tendría características escatológicas, mientras que el resto sería sólo un reflejo de los conflictos que la comunidad cristiana del autor estarían viviendo en su época y de la esperanza puesta en Dios a través de Cristo muerto y resucitado en que esos conflictos no prevalecerían y también serían vencidos tarde o temprano. [21]<br>  <br>  Hay otra curiosidad relativa tanto a la nueva Jerusalén (que simboliza a la ciudad santa) y a Babilonia (que simboliza a la ciudad perversa): en Ap 18 aparece un lamento por la Babilonia destruida; en Ap 21 aparece la descripción de la nueva Jerusalén. Se puede notar que ambos pasajes son paralelos e inversos, es decir, que las descripciones de lamentación y de sentido negativo dadas a Babilonia, aparecen revertidas, en sentido de gozo y alegría para Jerusalén. (Prévost 2001: 117-119)<br>  <br>  Nota [editar]<br>  <br>     1. ↑ Aunque diversos pasajes de otros libros del NT también pueden pertenecer a este género, sólo el Apocalipsis en su totalidad se considera en esta clasificación.<br>     2. ↑ Varios historiadores piensan que precisamente esto causó gran parte de las persecuciones, pues en el fondo, para los romanos, en ese gesto podría verse una actitud de rebeldía política contra Roma.<br>     3. ↑ Prévost (2001), además de presentar el análisis de ciertos pasajes particulares del Apocalipsis, se dedica sobre todo a plantear el análisis global del libro con base en cinco claves de lectura que tienen su símil con los puntos anteriormente expuestos: una clave cristológica (que se relaciona con centrar la lectura del libro en Cristo como personaje protagonista del mismo), una profética (que se relaciona con el contexto histórico del libro), una simbólica (sobre la interpretación de los numerosos símbolos que aparecen en el libro), una apocalíptica (que se relaciona con el género literario) y una evangélica (o del mensaje central del libro).<br>     4. ↑ El autor escribe el Apocalipsis como una interpretación de la historia a la luz de un acontecimiento concreto ya sucedido: la muerte y resurrección de Jesucristo, a diferencia del resto de la literatura apocalíptica, que suele interpretar la historia a la luz de una intervención divina por venir, no de una ya sucedida, es decir, mientras que para la literatura apocalíptica la batalla entre los eones viejo y nuevo está por venir, producto de una intervención divina, en el Apocalipsis la batalla ya se dio (y de hecho el eón nuevo ya comenzó) con la intervención de Dios al resucitar a Jesús.<br>     5. ↑ De quien se dice ya en el primer versículo del libro: "Revelación de Jesucristo", frase que semánticamente puede tener cualquiera de dos significados (o incluso ambos): que es una revelación proveniente de Jesucristo, y que el autor identificado como Juan solamente transcribió, o que es una revelación cuyo tema principal es Jesucristo (Prévost, 2001:14).<br>     6. ↑ Ya sea como si el autor hubiera escrito el libro y sus profecías se hubieran cumplido casi de inmediato (a manera de predicciones), o como si el autor hubiera escrito el libro basándose en eventos que ya habían ocurrido y que estaban ocurriendo al momento de escribirlo (a manera de una escritura en "código" de los hechos actuales para el autor, muy probablemente para dar un mensaje más allá del predictivo a sus lectores).<br>     7. ↑ Algunas variantes de esta escuela la mezclan con la futurista, viendo la historia de la Iglesia como un cumplimiento de profecías "predictivas" que estarían escritas dentro del libro.<br>     8. ↑ Probablemente localizadas en Asia Menor en la actual Turquía, donde el problema causado por la divinización al César fue crítico para los cristianos. Es probable que los problemas que se mencionan en esta sección hayan sucedido en realidad, sin embargo la misma estructura de la sección también puede interpretarse como un artificio in crescendo de las exhortaciones y amonestaciones (Prévost 2001: 84). Si se toma en cuenta el simbolismo del número 7, esta sección se puede interpretar como un mensaje para la Iglesia entera, y no sólo para comunidades específicas.<br>     9. ↑ Nótese como el orden de aparición de los enemigos (Dragón, Bestias, Prostituta) es el mismo pero inverso al orden en que son vencidos (Prostituta, Bestias, Dragón). (Prévost, 2001: 112; Vanni, 1982: 71)<br>    10. ↑ Puede tratarse del Evangelio. Según Vanni (Vanni, 1982:61) se trata simplemente de la Palabra de Dios. Según L?pple (L?pple, 1970) se trata de una anticipación del evangelio de San Juan.<br>    11. ↑ El Arca de la Alianza se había perdido desde la conquista de Jerusalén por los babilonios. Una leyenda decía que el profeta Jeremías la escondió en una cueva del monte Sinaí y que volvería a ser vista cuando Dios interviniera de manera definitiva en favor de su pueblo (II Mac 2,4-8). Según Vanni (1982:63-64) este pasaje del Apocalipsis hace alusión precisamente a esta leyenda.<br>    12. ↑ Aún hay dudas sobre la época en que fue escrito el evangelio de Juan, que podría incluso ser posterior al Apocalipsis, por lo que los cuatro Vivientes no podrían ser los evangelistas.<br>    13. ↑ Se puede notar que 3 (número de Dios) + 4 (número de la Creación) = 7.<br>    14. ↑ Prévost (Prévost, 2001: 95-96) identifica este libro con los escritos del Antiguo Testamento, de acuerdo a la interpretación cristiana de que es Jesús el que le da sentido y plenitud a las promesas veterotestamentarias. Otros simplemente interpretan este libro con el papel de Dios en la historia, ya que desde la visión cristiana (y judía también) Dios es el autor y director de la historia humana, y el Mesías viene a darle plenitud y sentido.<br>    15. ↑ Las coronas en el Apocalipsis sólo se les dan a los fieles al Cordero.<br>    16. ↑ Probablemente debido a la mala fama que la región de Dan tenía de darse a la idolatría.<br>    17. ↑ Tal vez dando a entender que incluso al antiguo Israel le toca también participar del orden nuevo del mundo que en la visión cristiana Jesús viene a instaurar con el Reino de Dios que anuncia e instaura.<br>    18. ↑ Para Prévost (2001: 110) el nacimiento del ni?o no representaría necesariamente el comienzo de la vida terrenal de Jesús, sino tal vez su muerte en la cruz (aludiendo al título dado a Cristo de primogénito de entre los muertos de Ap 1:5), y su rapto sería su resurrección.<br>    19. ↑ El llamado peque?o resto que mencionan varios profetas del AT (Is 4:2-6;10:20-22;11:10-16;28:5-6;46:3; Jr 6:9;31:7;50:4-6;51:19; Ez 6:8; Am 3:12;5:15; Sof 3:9-13; Mi 2:12;4:6-7;5:2-7;7:18; Zac 14:2).<br>    20. ↑ Sólo que esta vez ningún árbol está prohibido a nadie, al contrario de algunos árboles descritos en el Génesis (los árboles del conocimiento del bien y el mal y el de la vida eterna).<br>    21. ↑ Aún así, en su totalidad, el libro es considerado profético en el sentido amplio del término, por incluir también una interpretación desde Dios de las realidades que el autor habría vivido en su época y que bien interpretadas pueden seguir dando un mensaje actual a los lectores de cualquier época.<br>  <br>  Véase también [editar]<br>  <br>  Relacionados directamente<br>  <br>      * Cordero de Dios, título dado a Cristo y que prevalece como su título principal en el Apocalipsis<br>      * Cielo (religión)<br>      * Juicio Final<br>      * Parusía, o la Segunda Venida de Cristo<br>      * Armagedón, lugar en el que se desarrolla una de las batallas descritas en el Apocalipsis, comúnmente asociado con el evento del fin del mundo<br>      * Abaddon, nombre de uno de los ángeles mencionados en el Apocalipsis<br>      * Marca de la Bestia, sobre el hecho de que el número 666 se usa como marca para aquellos que se alían con la segunda Bestia del Apocalipsis<br>      * Anticristo, personaje neotestamentario comúnmente asociado con la segunda Bestia del Apocalipsis<br>      * Escatología cristiana, rama de la teología que dedica su estudio a las realidades últimas<br>      * Apocalíptico (género literario), género literario relacionado con la literatura Apocalíptica<br>  <br>  Arte<br>  <br>      * Pantocrátor<br>      * Tetramorfos<br>  <br>      Pintura<br>  <br>          * Los cuatro jinetes del Apocalipsis, obra del alemán Alberto Durero<br>          * Los cuatro jinetes del Apocalipsis, obra del alemán Peter von Cornelius<br>          * Políptico de Gante, guardado en la ciudad de Gante, Flandes, Bélgica, retablo del flamenco Jan van Eyck<br>          * El Castillo de Angers en Francia protege hoy la Tapicería del Apocalipsis<br>  <br>      Cine<br>  <br>          * El séptimo sello, película del sueco Ingmar Bergman<br>          * El día de la Bestia, película del espa?ol álex de la Iglesia<br>  <br>      Literatura<br>  <br>          * Apocalipsis Bamberg, guardado en la ciudad de Bamberg, Alemania, manuscrito medieval que contiene una copia del libro del Apocalipsis<br>          * Descubrimientos de todos los secretos del Apocalipsis de San Juan, por dos tratados: uno que busca y prueba la verdadera interpretación, y otro que aplica al texto esta interpretación parafrásticamente e históricamente, del matemático escocés John Napier<br>          * Beato de Liébana, monje espa?ol (del reino de Asturias) autor de los Comentarios al Apocalipsis a partir de los cuales se originaron los Beatos<br>          * Les trafiques, obra del francés Teodoro Agrippa de Aubigné<br>          * El nombre de la rosa, novela del italiano Umberto Eco<br>          * Cien a?os de soledad, novela del colombiano Gabriel García Márquez<br>  <br>      Música<br>  <br>          * Visionen (nach der Apokalypse des Hl.

No en un templo, no en un padre, Rabino, o guía espiritual, en ellos solo puede escuchar sus experiencia o la sabiduría son simplemente humanos como nosotros algunos con valores que nos guiaran y otros con falencias como la de cualquier humano, adorar a uno de ellos como si fueran sagrados, para mi es equivocar el camino, tampoco creo en un Dios castigador, que si no tienes fe en el iras al infierno, no, Dios es amor y si no crees en el simplemente te pierdes los beneficios de conocerlo, pero no por ello serás castigado.<br>  Por eso tenemos libre albedrío, para disfrutar de la libertad de cree o no en lo que cada uno siente.<br>  Un abrazo<br>  Ferchus|`|scvKT3L2aa	Hasta el momento (porque antes solo hacia lo que se me daba la gana creeme) ahora, con la meditaciòn, el ayuno y cierta catarsis hacia el mundo exterior, estoy valga la redundancia, exteriorizando ciertos preceptos del budismo, hacia mis semejantes. salù|`|4xmjjIpKaa	Dios te Bendiga.<br>  La forma de reflejar mis creencias no es decirlas con mi boca o el platicarlas de persona en persona o no es con una banda que dice Cristiano,(yo, soy Cristiano) y la forma en que yo lo reflejo es en mi forma de actuar, fijate que en la sociedad en la que vivo el hecho de no beber es motivo para dudar de la sexualidad de una persona, y en la Biblia esta claramente que no hay que hembriagarse con vino. otra es que hay que andar con muchas mujeres, cuando en la Biblia dice claramente que no hay que codiciar a la mujer de tu projimo y que hay que serle fiel a su esposa, y en fin muchas cosas mas...

AA10704524	El que más me gusta es solo un versículo dice: " más El (Jesús) hizo como que iba más lejos. Más ellos (los discípulos) le obligaron a quedarse, diciendo: quédate con nosotros, por que se hace tarde, y el día ya ha declinado. Entró pues a quedarse con ellos" (Luc. 24:29).<br>  Imáginate esa escena, Jesús en los últimos días de su ministerio, teniendo cosas que hacer y sus discípulos con otra cosa en la mente. El deseaba seguir caminando, quizá para predicar, sin embago sus discípulos le obligaron diciendole que se quedara.  Imagino el amor tan grande de Jesús para quedarse con ellos, que le habían seguido con tanto amor.<br>  Eso fue antes, imáginate ahora que no tiene que trasladarse a pie o en asno sobre las ciudades, ahora que no hay nada que lo detenga se mueve como sea por los clamores de sus hijos,  mandando ángeles y ayuda a quienes claman a EL.<br>  Simplemente llena mi alma.<br>  Saludos|`|a93f5f2a8e0f81ec61ac0912a2c7fb4eaa	Génesis 1:1 <br>          En el principio creó Dios los cielos y la Tierra. <br>  Génesis 1:2 <br>            Y la tierra estaba desordenada y vacía, y las tinieblas <br>            estaban sobre la faz del abismo, y el Espíritu de Dios se <br>            movía sobre la faz de las aguas.<br>  Los dos primeros versículos me encanta ya que forman la primera mentira de la Biblia. Ya el primer versículo entra en contradicción no sólo con lo que sucedió en realidad, sino también con lo que dice la misma Biblia.   Cuando la Biblia dice "En el principio Dios creó los cielos y la Tierra" se supone que al crear los cielos los creó completos, el Sol, la Luna, las estrellas y los astros debían estar allí desde el principio. Pero sabemos que no es cierto, ni el Sol, ni la Tierra ni la Luna estaban en los cielos primitivos, habrían de pasar muchos miles de millones de a?os antes de que apareciera el Sol.<br>  Cualquier lector de la Biblia, por inculto que sea, se da cuenta que en su primer versículo la Biblia miente, aun así los cristianos y la jerarquía eclesiástica insisten en que esa es la palabra de algun dios. Mienten y saben que mienten, pero no les importa seguir mintiendo.|`|ebce41bde92ad748ab50a5e182fce419aa	Habacuc y yo somos muy unidos...hhehe.<br>  <br>  Cuidate.|`|jNtuIqMaaa	Me fascina un relato bíblico que está en Marcos 3: 1:-5 donde Jesús desea curar a un hombre con la mano seca en día sábado, pero las personas no veían eso con buenos ojos, entonces Jesús los quiso hacer razonar apelando a sus corazones, pero al mostrarse TODOS insensibles con el dolor del prójimo Jesús los miró con indignación, mientras que en su interior estaba muy dolido por la insensibilidad de los corazones de ellos.<br>  Este relato me toca muy de cerca, porque yo también, por fuera soy re duro y de carácter fuerte, pero por dentro soy muy sensible, y me contrista la insensibilidad de los humanos para con el prójimo (aún hasta con los animalitos o la naturaleza).<br>  Realmente es uno de mis preferidos, y lo uso mucho con mis estudiantes de la Biblia para que recapaciten y abran más su sensibilidad sobre todo con quienes penden de un hilo y aún luchan.<br>  Muchas gracias mi apreciada Dorle por tu hermosa pregunta, te estimo demasiado (como a una mamá amiga), al igual que un muchachito, que espero que mejore pronto.<br>  Saludos y buana semana<br>  MAU|`|43648cf006b95937c2c648db8f23b11daa	El éxodo.<br>  Pues si se toma como una metáfora sobre el andar por la vida, resulta maravilloso.|`|551a8fbfdcb12d3597fc8e85b9226014aa	A mi me gusta este relato porque es aqui donde el dios de los cristianos muestra su verdadera naturaleza "misericordiosa" y "compasiva"<br>  <br>  NUMEROS 31 - Venganza de Israel contra Madián<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  1 Jehová habló a Moisés, diciendo: <br>  2 Haz la venganza de los hijos de Israel contra los madianitas; después serás recogido a tu pueblo. <br>  3 Entonces Moisés habló al pueblo, diciendo: Armaos algunos de vosotros para la guerra, y vayan contra Madián y hagan la venganza de Jehová en Madián.<br>  4 Mil de cada tribu de todas las tribus de los hijos de Israel, enviaréis a la guerra. <br>  5 Así fueron dados de los millares de Israel, mil por cada tribu, doce mil en pie de guerra. <br>  6 Y Moisés los envió a la guerra; mil de cada tribu envió; y Finees hijo del sacerdote Eleazar fue a la guerra con los<br>  vasos del santuario, y con las trompetas en su mano para tocar. <br>  7 Y pelearon contra Madián, como Jehová lo mandó a Moisés, y mataron a todo varón. <br>  8 Mataron también, entre los muertos de ellos, a los reyes de Madián, Evi, Requem, Zur, Hur y Reba, cinco reyes de Madián; también a Balaam hijo de Beor mataron a espada. <br>  9 Y los hijos de Israel llevaron cautivas a las mujeres de los<br>  madianitas, a sus ni?os, y todas sus bestias y todos sus ganados; y arrebataron todos sus bienes,<br>  10 e incendiaron todas sus ciudades, aldeas y habitaciones.<br>  11 Y tomaron todo el despojo, y todo el botín, así de hombres como de bestias. <br>  12 Y trajeron a Moisés y al sacerdote Eleazar, y a la<br>  congregación de los hijos de Israel, los cautivos y el botín y los despojos al campamento, en los llanos de Moab, que están junto al Jordán frente a Jericó.<br>  13 Y salieron Moisés y el sacerdote Eleazar, y todos los príncipes de la congregación, a recibirlos<br>  fuera del campamento. <br>  14 Y se enojó Moisés contra los capitanes del ejército, contra los jefes de millares y de centenas que volvían de la guerra, <br>  15 y les dijo Moisés: ?Por qué habéis dejado con<br>  vida a todas las mujeres? <br>  16 He aquí, por consejo de Balaam ellas fueron causa de que los hijos de Israel prevaricasen contra Jehová en lo tocante a Baal-peor, por lo que hubo mortandad en la<br>  congregación de Jehová. <br>  17 MATAD, PUES, AHORA A TODOS LOS VARONES DE ENTRE LOS NI?OS; MATAD TAMBIéN A TODA MUJER QUE HAYA CONOCIDO VARóN CARNALMENTE. <br>  18 Pero a todas las ni?as entre las mujeres, que no hayan conocido varón, las dejaréis con vida. <br>  19 Y vosotros, cualquiera que haya<br>  dado muerte a persona, y cualquiera que haya tocado muerto, permaneced fuera del campamento siete días, y os purificaréis al tercer día y al séptimo, vosotros y vuestros cautivos. <br>  20 Asimismo purificaréis todo vestido, y toda prenda de pieles, y toda obra de pelo de cabra, y todo utensilio de<br>  madera.|`|7d1a07fbde543e7b06f0dfd884f7a003aa	Ruth, me da esperanza , me alienta a seguir adelante no separandome de mi suegra, (aunque ella no me demuestre que me quiera)<br>  Amo, y soy amada por un Dios que es todo poderoso y tan caballeroso el como Booz que le dió la orden a sus trabajadores de que le dieran a Ruth su porción y no la molestaran ............Asi me tiene El.

KRCafqfFaa	TE FELICITO REALISTA????  Eres muy valiente al hacer estas preguntas aun sabiendo lo que se te viene encima, pero recuerda "antes eran piedras".  Dios nos creó con el más puro amor, pero Adan y Eva DESOBEDECIERON ignorando la autoridad del Se?or y como buen Padre castigó la desobediencia, pero como tambien es justo dijo que si por un hombre había entrado el pecado al mundo, por un hombre habría de salir y como tambien es cumplidor de su palabra así fué.<br>  áNIMO AMIGA eres un oasis????|`|88c46eacdb397d9b517bef0e6006c38faa	VISIóN LITERALISTA SUPERFICIAL: DESOBEDIENCIA<br>  <br>  Lo irritó la desobediencia. Como si todo el mal del mundo se debiera al afán de desobedecer a D--s. "no se coman las margaritas". Los humanos seríamos maleducados y esa descortesía sería el pecado original.<br>  <br>  PRIMERA ALTERNATIVA: SOBERBIA<br>  <br>  Por querer ser como D--ses. Por intentar algo que nos superaba, y la desobediencia solamente fue un medio. No asumir nuestras limitaciones sería el pecado original<br>  <br>  SEGUNDA ALTERNATIVA: PEREZA<br>  <br>  Cuando a Adán le pregunta D--s por qué lo hizo, él culpa a Eva, y Eva culpa a la serpiente. El pecado ilustrado aquí es la pereza, en el sentido de no querer responsabilizarnos de nuestras propias decisiones. "Lo hice porque eso dice la Biblia, o mi pastor, o el Papa".<br>  <br>  TERCERA ALTERNATIVA: ASCENSO Y NO CAíDA<br>  <br>  En la lectura de esta historia, en la tradición rabínica no hay ningún pecado original, ni tampoco en la tradición musulmana. Pablo hace un comentario que ha sido trágicamente malinterpretado, pero realmente fue San Agustín de Hipona quien inventó la teoría del pecado original como caída, y luiego la iglesia cristiana medieval lo endilgó a la sexualidad.<br>  <br>  El gran filólosofo y teólogo Baruch Spinoza considera que este relato nos habla más bien de un ascenso y no de una caída: Comer el fruto del árbol del conocimiento del bien y del mal marca un ascenso desde el reino animal, pues los animales no conocen el bien y el mal. Somos como dioses gracias a la curiosidad y el valor de Adán y Eva.

Tendrán la sabiduría de la ciencia del bien y del mal"?<br>  Así perdieron la inocencia, la pureza del alma, condiciones necesarias para ver el rostro de Dios<br>  .<br>  Y porqué esto hizo enojar tanto a Dios?<br>  Porque Adán y Eva, al igual que todos nosotros somos nada más que un "porotito" o un grano de arena frente al inmenso mar de Dios, pensaron que podían ser igual a Dios. <br>  Fuera de absurda y ridícula posición, esta actitud además de peligrosa es ofensiva. Vea porqué:<br>  Usted, madre, cómo se sentiría si su hijo de 6 a?os le dice un día: "mamá, tú ya no eres necesaria en la casa, yo puedo manejar totalmente la casa, la comida, las ropas, el aseo, las cuentas, etc, etc. No te necesito más".<br>  Seguramente su primera reacción será de reirse, pero viendo que ésto es en serio como segunda medida intentará explicarle a su hijo que eso no es posible, pero el ni?o no cambia su actitud, además se muestra ofensivo.  <br>  No indica ésta acción una falta total de amor hacia usted. Por lo tanto, ingratitud, falta de respeto, sin consideración, etc, etc.?<br>  Viendo todo esto, no será normal que usted se enoje y tome medidas disciplinárias contra su hijo?<br>  <br>  Ese es el peor pecado que hasta hoy día mucha gente comete.

Me tienen que rendir pleitesía, debo tener privilégios, etc.<br>  <br>  Muchos se creen tan inteligentes que hasta se dan el lujo de negar la existencia de Dios. Dicen: todo lo que se pueda ver, oir, sentir, tocar, medir, es real y verdadero. El resto es pura fantasía o ilusión religiosa.<br>  Dicen, yo no creo ni necesito de un Dios.

Dios les había dado un jardín de Edén para que lo cultivaran , extendieran por toda la tierra, tuvieran hijos y además la sujeción de toda la raza animal. Adán conocía lo que era la muerte ya que lo veía en los animales, entonces no estaba ni él ni Eva en ignorancia de las consecuencias que traería la desobediencia. Pero no hicieron caso y tiraron por la borda todos los arreglos de vida en felicidad que Jehová Dios les había programado. Es debido a toda esta actitud que se cumple Génesis 3:15 que dice "?Y pondré enemistad entre ti y la mujer, y entre tu descendencia y la descendencia de ella. él te magullará en la cabeza y tú le magullarás en el talón”<br>   A fin de comprender la importancia de la profecía, examinemos sus diversos elementos. El destinatario del mensaje de Génesis 3:15 es la Serpiente: no?el humilde animal, sino el personaje que se valió de él como instrumento( Satanás ,Revelación 12:9.) “La mujer” no?es Eva, sino la organización celestial de Jehová, la madre de sus siervos ungidos con espíritu en la Tierra. (Gálatas 4:26.) La “descendencia” de la Serpiente es la descendencia, o prole, de Satanás, formada por demonios, hombres y organizaciones humanas que manifiestan características como las de él y muestran enemistad a la “descendencia” de la mujer. (Juan 15:19; 17:15.) La “descendencia” de la mujer es principalmente Jesucristo, quien fue ungido con espíritu santo en 29?E.C.<br>  Por eso toda la felicidad que Dios había puesto en la primera creación humana tuvo que tener la intervención y sacrificio en muerte de Jesús para pagar por el error de Adán. Ahora sí podría concretarse el propósito de Dios ya que la vida de Jesús compraba la desobediencia de Adán y daba la oportunidad a la raza humana obediente a Dios de poder llegar a vivir en la tierra convirtiéndola en un paraiso.|`|bd54dcb420d093e9f8f167e1c7a5be0eaa	Porque se revelaron en contra de su autoridad y le desobedecieron al comer la fruta del árbol de la ciencia del bien y del mal el cual les habia sido prohibido.

Se usaba mucho peinarse a la Farra Fawcet, con el pelo esponjado y peinado escrupulosamente hacia atrás. Estaban de moda los ángeles de Charlie, veíamos el Chavo del Ocho, escuchábamos música Pop, me encantaba Queen. Usábamos faldas muy largas y con grandes aberturas laterales...Las computadoras no eran tan populares como ahora, empezaba la red de información, pero solo pocos la conocían y la usaban. Las pantallas de las computadoras tenían fondo negro y las letras eran verdes o blancas, usábamos procesadore como el Chi Writer, e impresoras de cinta y con papeles que eran hojas pegaditas unas con otras...Jiji, que chistoso ahora lucen tan anticuadas...<br>  Ah y los discos eran disketes grandotes. Eran todavía muy populares las máquinas de escribir... Usábamos grabadoras con cassetes, estaban todavía de moda los Long Plays, los tocadiscos...

La cosa es que con el tiempo comenzó a hacer sentido ya que el tiempo o energía que un sacerdote le dedicaría a una familia se lo dedica a Dios y a los fieles, y si son hombres con un alto nivel de espiritualidad deberían tener la suficiente voluntad como para no tener sexo. A un seminarista antes de ordenarse se le da un a?o libre fuera del seminario para que decida si realmente quiere llevar una vida sacerdotal, quienes deciden ordenarse saben lo que implica y quienes no lo logran deberían renunciar al sacerdocio. Personalmente creo que el celibato debería ser opcional, pero para que esto suceda se necesitan antes muchos cambios dentro de la iglesia|`|D8xyWJKgaa	Ohhhh Dios,estas bromiando verdad??? no creo que sea en serio tu pregunta.|`|EKmheW8raa	genial.|`|lWb3jp2uaa	YA ES UN TEMA DE MUCHA DISCUSIONES  Y ADEMAS YA UD SABE LA RESPUESTA ,,,,,, QUE QUIERE MEDIR LAS RESPUESTAS O GANARSE LOS  PUNTOS....YO NUNCA HE ESTADO DE ACUERDO QUE LOS CURAS SE CASTREN ,,,,,,Y LAS MONJAS TAMNBIEN ,,,,,,,, SI DIOS NOS PERMITIO TENER LOS ORGANOS SEXUALES COMPLETOS PARA USARLOS .........

Pedirles respeto a los políticos es demasiado, no les importa respetar a nadie. Ellos están para enga?ar y confundir a la gente. Seguramente hablás del ministro de Educación  que dijo que a él lo habían votado los que pensaban. La próxima vez hay que tener en claro, que él es un intolerante y sectario. Después habla de Derechos Humanos!!! Es un hombre contradictorio como todo el gabinete al que él pertenece, encabezado por el presidente. Se hacen los irracionales para cambiarles la verdad a la gente que los escucha. Es que ellos hablan para los que están más indefensos y que son producto de las políticas ancestrales que vienen desarrollando estos personajes siniestros, que tanto da?o han hecho y hacen a la patria.<br>  No son  patriotas, son oportunistas que usan el poder para figurar, perpetuarse y salvarse económicamente.

De no estar en contacto con ningún organismo, es decir, es una familia en desgracia, desamparada, enviaría un  equipo de PDVSA, de la Alcaldía, o de la Gobernación del estado o provincia.

A pesar de eso, si cabe preguntarse porque estos indigenas adoraban el sol y la luna, pero por otro lado no presentaban la codicia de los europeos hacia las riquezas.

Hipólito Reyes Larios:-<br>   "Hijo mio, no te olvides que las culturas mesoamericanas a pesar de sus grandes diferencias sobre todo geográficas, tenían algo en común, y esto es su religión, acuerdate que toltecas, aztecas y mayas hablaron de conocer a un hombre blanco que llego a visitarlos pero no sabian de donde venia, que este hombre fue muy bueno con todos y que les ense?o artes y oficios que ellos no conocian, por eso los indigenas lo interpretaron como que era un hijo de los dioses a este hombre extra?o que lo mismo lo conocieron los mayas que los aztecas como ?como si estaban muy alejados en el tiempo y la distancia estos reinos! los mayas lo conocieron como Kukulcan y los aztecas como Quetzalcoatl en ambos casos significa serpiente emplumada.... quizas la teoria de los mormones no ande muy lejos de la realidad, yo mismo soy obispo y tengo mis dudas teologicas, que dios te bendiga hijito mio".<br>  <br>  Ahora uno es un obispo catolico Mons Hipolito Reyes Larios; el otro es un descendiente de los nativos americanos.<br>  uno es Catollico y estudia la biblia; el otro es como dije decendiente de los indigenas americanos y lo que dijiste le hizo recordar las leyendas de sus antepasados.<br>  <br>  Ahora quieres mas muestras; ahora escucha a apostata de Geoba:- "Bueno, soy Catolico y tengo entendido que en Mexico existen cruces que se adoraban antes de la llegada de los espanoles, y tambien que el pez representaba a un ser humano (emblema de cristo). La cultura Chacay tiene varias cruces....<br>  <br>  En Mexico, existe unas piramides que se llaman Teotihuacan (ciudad de los dioses), en latin Teo, significa Dios, y dentro de su lenguaje hay mas palabras que comienzas con la raiz TEO (DIOS), teocalli,( casa de Dios,) etc. <br>  <br>  Los indigenas mexicanos esperaban la llegada del dios Quetzalcoatl (perdonen mi desconocimiento, pero soy ciudadano americano) y fue cuando confundieron con la llegada de los espa?oles a su dios, la profecia se referia a un hombre blanco barbado que regresaria nuevamente mas alla de los mares...<br>  <br>  --------------------<br>  <br>  <br>  tambien existen cruces que se veneran en el norte de Mexico y el sur de USA, que datan desde antes de la llegada de los espanoles <br>  <br>  Fuente (s):<br>  <br>  Aclaro, antes fui jeovista (o como se escriba) durante 20 a?os, pero mis estudios me llevaron a esto, y tambien se me hizo muy interesante esta analogia. <br>  <br>  Ahora algunas muestra de nuestro desconocimiento de la historia.<br>  <br>  Primeramente veamos La Biblia (JUAN 10 :16), empecemos con algo conocido: Cristo Dijo y -" TAMBIéN  TENGO OTRAS OVEJAS QUE NO SON DE ESTE REDIL; AQUéLLAS TAMBIéN DEBO TRAER, Y OIRAN MI VOS; Y HABRá UN REBA?O Y UN PASTOR".<br>  <br>  Analisemosla; dice que hay otra ovejas que no son de ese redil ?de que redil esta hablando si esta hablando a sus apostoles? o sea al redil de lo que lo seguian en en el antiguo continente; ahora  dice que hay otras ovejas ?de que redil son?. <br>  <br>  Muchos dicen que son los Gentiles pero a los gentiles les empezo a predicar Saulo o como lo llamo Cristo despues Pablo.<br>  Otros dicen que son las 10 tribus que faltan. que esto puede ser factible .Pero eran 12 las tribus de Israel 10 estan perdidas para el conocimiento Humano, una de esas doce  son los Judios a los cuales él le predicaba, o sea falta una tribu de Israel que es la Tribu de Jose; donde estaban.<br>  Si recuerdas en la epoca del Rey Sedequias en el Antiguo Testamento en EL libro de Cronicas Dice que Muchos se fueron a tierras lejanas y el Libro de Mormón dice que en la epoca del Rey Sedequias, algunos de la tribu de Jose viajaron por el desierto a las muchas aguas.<br>   O sea ahora estan completas las 12 tribus , lo que podemos concluir solo con una escritura que en América estaba la tribu de José y Cristo tenia que venir a ellos para que haya un pastor y un reba?o.<br>  <br>  Ahora pruebas físicas:<br>  <br>  a) En Bolivia: en una cuiudad boliviana hay un templo que habla de un Dios barbudo de tez blanca, que prometio volver, en una de las paredes de ese templo hay un retrato en piedra que habla de este Dios, y da una similitud a un rostro de un ser blanco barbudo, que bajaba de lo cielos.<br>   <br>  b) En Perú: hay en Cuzco muchos lugares de leyendas escritas en las paredes que hablan de un Dios Blanco y Barbudo que los visito y les ense?o.<br>  <br>  Los anteriores hablande la civilizacion Inca<br>  <br>  c) En el Templo de Quetzacoalt en Mexico habla de esa serpiente alada que les ense?o y que bajo de los cielos.<br>  <br>  d)En Mexico: recordando la llegada de Cortez a los Indigenas Americanos en Mexico, ellos lo recibieron como a un Dios blanco que habia Prometido volver, lo que los conquistadores aprovecharon para, culturizar según lo que decian ellos eran los salvajes<br>  <br>  e)Alli en Mexico se cultiva un Algodón que según dicen lo que saben de telas es un algodón hibrido del antiguo mundo que data de antes de la llegada de los espa?oles. ?Como llego ese algodon aqui a América antes de la llegada de los Espa?oles?<br>  <br>  f) En las leyendas Indigenas en Guatemala; en Honduras, en Argentina; en Chile; los indigenas en sus reservaciones hablan de un Dios Blanco y Barbado que los visito, les ense?o la verdad y les dijo que las vivieran.<br>  <br>  Ahora que mas prubas necesitas. y esto no es una explicación magica como dices tu.<br>  <br>  Y lo que quisiera aclarar es que uno en esta vida esta para vivir por fe aunque aveces puede lograr un conocimiento casi perfecto de algunas cosas y lo niega por que no quiere aceptar la realidad.<br>  <br>  Solo tu debes tomar tus deciciones y conclusiones.<br>  Espero que te ayude y que como ves no soy solo yo el que te contesto sobre los indigenas Americanos y de La visita de Cristo a Las Américas sino un miembro de la iglesia Catolica, además un Obispo Catolico, y un Nativo de Los Indigenas Americanos, son Muchos los testimonios que tienes no solo de personas sino de monumentos, leyendas, y escritos.

5685fb60981b7c82de735ca632559cc3aa	Hola Guerriera:<br>  <br>  Precisamente el viernes pasado estuve dando una clase acerca de la autoestima a los jóvenes de mi iglesia. Sentí en mi  corazón hacerlo, y me di cuenta de que Dios tenía un propósito con eso. Les hice varias preguntas, entre ellas precisamente esta, "?Qué ves cuando te miras en el espejo?". Quería hacerles ver que tenemos que comenzar a mirarnos como nos mira Dios. Que muchas de las cosas negativas que pensamos acerca de nosotros mismos equivalen a una distorsión de la realidad. Les di el ejemplo también de David y Goliat. Me enfoqué en que David miraba al ejército de Israel como el Escuadrón del Dios de Israel. Ellos estaban temblando frente a ese gigante, ninguno se atrevía a responder al desafío de aquel gigante, mas sin embargo David, los llamó de esa manera, porque realmente los miraba más allá de sus limitaciones y de su cobardía, como lo que realmente eran, el ejército de Dios. Cuando David quiso ir a luchar contra el gigante, Saúl lo miró de diferente manera y le dijo que no era posible que lo hiciera pues no era hombre de guerra. David dijo que sí podía, jajaja, su Dios ya lo había entrenado para la batalla con leones y osos a los cuales David se enfrentó. Ni siquiera se inmutó al encontrarse frente a frente con el gigante, el gigante lo vio que era hermoso, muchacho y de buen parecer y lo menospreció, pero David sabía quien era: un hijo de Dios. <br>  <br>  La clase fue una bendición para mi vida y para aquellos jóvenes; en especial para uno de ellos que decía con tristeza:"yo no puedo subir mis notas." Yo le dije: "tú sí puedes, nunca dejes que nadie te diga que tú no puedes, ni siquiera te oigas a tí mismo. Pídele a Dios sabiduría, y él te la dará." Pude ver una media sonrisa en sus labios, sé que se sintió muy bien de escuchar eso, porque lo necesitaba. Dios sabía que lo necesitábamos todos. <br>  <br>  ?Qué veo realmente cuando me miro al espejo? Veo a una hija de Dios, veo a una heredera del Reino de Dios...no siempre es fácil la batalla interna contra los malos pensamientos, la frustración, las heridas que quedan por sanar, tantas cosas que se agolpan en la mente, pero sí es posible. Como dice la canción de Marcela Gándara: "Dame tus ojos, quiero ver..." Yo quiero verme como Dios me ve, ?o es que acaso él no llama las cosas que no son como si fuesen? <br>  <br>  Gracias por tu pregunta. ?Me encantó! :)<br>  <br>  Suerte en la búsqueda de tus respuestas.|`|228d7f818e104c629d360beb687302daaa	Piel cruda.<br>  diría yoda:<br>  "Somo seres luminosos, no esta piel cruda"<br>  ?<br>  <a href="http://younglinkdany.spaces.live.com" rel="nofollow">http://younglinkdany.spaces.live.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.spookybug.com/origins/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.spookybug.com/origins/index.h...</a>|`|7ceaa0a4c063a0b7acf2d17e8a9ed2e4aa	cual espejo? el normal el envase de afuera el espiritual lo bello que nos han dado|`|ElvOG5W3aa	eso es algo que solo lo hago en la ma?ana antes de venirme a trabajar y solo por unos segundos pues casi nunca tengo tiempo asi que te dire que no tengo mucho tiempo de remirarme, no mas me fijo que tenga el cabello bien peinado y la ropa me quede bien.|`|1sOkZC2oaa	A una mina que se banca la vida, la disfruta y estrena cada día, una pasión diferente y pretenciosa.<br>  Cari?os.|`|5375959a35ad0fe458f343335280eaacaa	hola veo a un ser humano lleno de defectos y virtudes, con muchos dones dados por Dios y con una fortaleza muy grande para modificar mis faltas y a aprender a ser humilde cada día mas.|`|5afc71a306fd40d3f1155f26f9476c5baa	veo que me tengo que depilar, que hacer una limpieza de cutis.<br>  pero a veces veo a quien tengo detrás.?.?|`|7d8d467c23f140cf79a7086399881f76aa	Me doy cuenta de mis virtudes y al ver mis defectos intento remediarlos...|`|D4tSjXxbaa	* Veo a un Guerrero vencedor que por mas dura que sea la prueba no claudica y el espejo es mi confidente mi amigo intimo al que le confió las cosas y le predico la mayoría de mis mensajes *<br>  <br>  What Up Baby Girl,  blessing.|`|DDrHKfOZaa	UN VARON DE DIOS AGRADECIDO Y ENTREGADO A LA CAUSA DE CRISTO<br>  <br>  <br>  ALGUIEN MUY PRIVILEGIADO POR PARTE DE DIOS UN ESCOGIDO PARA SALVACION NO POR MERITOS HUMANOS SINO POR PURA MISERICORDIA DE DIOS|`|SDHvDNGJaa	Una mujer preocupada por vivir lo mejor posible...|`|VDq2cMinaa	Que no me rasuré porque se me hizo tarde y que me quedó mal el peinado también.

Pienso que me salvé de ser navajeada por el que no alcanzó a subir, pero mis u?as se voltearon todas hacia atrás y me sangraban,  espero le haya quedado la espalda peor a ese chico.

XZtXI3RZaa	NUNCA te pegues con nadie. Lo único que vas a lograr si ganas es que tengan renconr y ganas de venguanza, y si pierdes es llevarte 2 ostias.<br>  <br>  Mira, la gente, sobre todo cuanto más peque?o de edad, son muy manipulables. Si se meten con tigo hazles un favor. Así de simple. Cuando necesiten ayuda ayudales, aunque sea esa misma persona la que se metió con tigo un par de minutos antes. Esto puede ablandar hasta al más fuerte. Si no logras que te respete, por lo menos lograrás que alguien si lo haga, sobre todo los profesores si te muestras buena persona.<br>  <br>  Si te sigue sin respetar, se muy serio, no borde, serio. A él no le hables y con el resto de personas, incluido sus amigos se simpático. Es mucho más fácil que te hagas amigo de ellos cuando están solos. Ahí tienes que hacer que les necesitas (de algún modo), y si te hace el favor  se MUY simpático con él. Con esto no vas a lograr que él te respete, pero es solo el comienzo...<br>  <br>  Después, si el que se mete con tigo (suele siempre haber un cabecilla) vuelve a hacerlo, el resto participará en menor grado, ya que tienes algo de afinidad con ellos. Entonces se sentirá algo solo y querrá hacerse amigo tuyo. Ahí tienes 2 opciones: si te cae bien, hazte amigo suyo; si te cae mal, haz las paces con él, pero se serio, tu confianza tiene que ganarsela.<br>  <br>  A partir de este punto, habrás notado que se dio la vuelta la tortilla y tienes la sartén porel mando. Que n ose te suba a la cabeza, ya que si quieres, dado que tienes la imagen de bueno con los profesores y algo de afinidad con sus amigos, puedes hacerle mucho da?o. Si llegas a esto te pondrías a su nivel y no habrías logrado nada, pues sus amigos se pondrán de parte de él y los profesores te verán como malo sin darte el apoyo incondicional.<br>  <br>  Con esto puedes no solo quitarte un problema, sino lograr grandes amigos. Sin embargo, si despues de todo le odias con todas tus ganas, siempre puedes hacerle mucho da?o, pero asegurate de que no sea físico, pues nunca lograrás nada, y que no se note que le odias.<br>  <br>  En conclusión, con perspicacia y la cabeza fría puedes llegar a lo que quieras. NUNCA pierdas los papeles, siempre templanza y verás que el que tiene realmente el poder de joderle eres tú, pues tienes ya las razones para hacerlo.<br>  <br>  Xauu|`|523956a924d71293e6df15da2e6ab1a7aa	Primero para que te respeten debes respetarte a ti mismo, me ha pasado sufrir discriminación en el colegio y uno llega a sentir que ya no vale la pena imponerse, pues te equivocas.<br>  <br>  Aqui te dejo una frase que a mi me ha ayudado.<br>  <br>      "Si tú no te agachas, nadie se te subirá encima" <br>  <br>          Martin Luther King|`|5MBgqv5maa	mira siempre vas a encontrar gente así debes tomarlo con calma y date valor y sientete orgulloso de tu origen  y siempre q alguien te ridiculice la mejor arma crótalos en la misma forma observalos bien y fíjate cuales son son sus defectos y responde atacando con la misma forma ya veras que muchas veces se sentirán también incómodos|`|62337305b90e2c8841422d21f1b9b185aa	Lo q yo diría es q aumentes tu autoestima, analizáte, mírate al espejo y aceptate como eres,no tienes ningun defecto, eres como eres y eres tu quién debe poner los límites.

Y los que realmente te quieren,  ellos siempre te apoyaran en todos tus emprendimientos y eso eso es realmente lo que vale!!!!|`|73eeef0d7d795ef67a92df1696b54140aa	Oye va en serio eso??

Es porque el hijo de Dios no podía nacer de un acto "impuro" como lo es el sexo, o porque fue la única forma de que Dios tuviera un hijo, porque imagínate que la biblia dijera que Dios bajó y... ves, ni decirlo puedo. Yo creo que una cosa no tiene mucho que ver con la otra, el tema de la abstinencia como método de control natal surgió precisamente cuando se crearon los anticonceptivos porque antes era literalmente el único método... me parece que también se permite el famoso método del ritmo y es que la lógica detras de esto es ue el uso de anticonceptivos está interfiriendo con el trabajo de Dios que es el único con el poder de decidir sobre la vida|`|73eeef0d7d795ef67a92df1696b54140aa	Fácil: Porque no era virgen|`|1eb262b5c67b9cfee272cf7df764269daa	Estás en un error.

Te digo, la abstinencia no tiene nada de malo, pero para llevarla a cavo necesita de LOS DOS O SEA DE LA PAREJA, porque si no hay problemas. Una vez que estas de novio se hace cuesta arriba si los dos no sienten igual. Y en el matrimonio es casi imposible usarlo como método anticonceptivo, y mas si estas soltero a los 30. Todos deberíamos conocer las opciones que tenemos, y decidir desde allí. Los métodos naturales no son fáciles de ense?ar a personas que no han ido a la escuela por ejemplo.

Dios esta en cada uno de nosotros, no en la iglesia mas bonita o mas cara.

Si creer en la virginidad de María es parte de tu fe, entonces sigue adelante, pero no hay explicacion lógica para los hechos divinos, por lo menos no las hay para nosotros simples humanos.

1caa3a3b43f38b232282a964c299fb5eaa	Anochecer, el crepúsculo, el ocaso del día, "o sol por" como se dice en mi lugar de origen. Cuando el sol baja del cielo hasta que se pierde en el horizonte atlántico y momentos después también, dejando un rastro de luz reflexionada por todo lo que se antepone a dichos haces, llenándolo todo de colores tenues, ese es el momento del día en el que todo parece tan bonito, da igual si hay nubes o si esta lloviendo, si es invierno o es oto?o, da igual, da lo mismo. Solo me identifico con la luz, el color, de mar, de tierra y de sol.

Se empezó a diferenciar de otras lenguas romances tras la caída del Imperio romano, con las invasiones bárbaras del siglo V. Se empezó a utilizar en documentos escritos a partir del siglo IX y, a partir del siglo XV, empezó a ser una lengua madura con bastante literatura.<br>  <br>  Es hablado en: Angola, Antillas Neerlandesas, Brasil, Cabo Verde, Guayana Francesa, Guinea Bissau,Guyana, India, Macao, Mozambique, Namibia, Portugal, Santo Tomé y Príncipe, Sudáfrica, Surinam, Timor Oriental, por cerca de 230 millones de personas.<br>  <br>  Saludos!|`|Fi4E8vj5aa	El espa?ol es la lengua mas dificil de hablar por todas sus cosas|`|SDHvDNGJaa	No, creo que tu apreciación es un poco desubicada.

Y gracias a esa ventaja uno puede comunicarse con más personas y por consiguiente uno puede viajar a más lugares ya que  el aprendizaje no se hace tan difícil (digo . . . , en comparanción con otros idiomas).

zJ9lxwoGaa	En el a?o 399 a C, los se?ores Meleto (poeta), Licón ( orador) y Anito ( no te rías, va con acento en la "a") que era mercader y político, denuncian a Sócrates acusándolo de corromper a la juventud, de negar a los dioses patrios y de introducir nuevos seres demónicos.  la pena pedida es la muerte.<br>  En lineas generales por eso es condenado.  No puedo ahora darte más detalles.<br>  <br>  DANI QUERIDO:  si yo no fuera una bestia con este aparato, te diría qué sucede, pero como lo soy, no sé qué responderte.

Feliz fin de semana!|`|uDRZ3wNWaa	hola, en realidad no fue sentenciado por esto. se sabe que sócrates fue un ciudadano  que respetaba las leyes y colaboraba con la ciudad, participando incluso en la política. y sin embargo, la misma atenas  lo condena a muerte por motivos poco claros. hay quienes dicen que el principal fue que  Anito, su principal acusador,  un rico curtidor, simplemente sentia un odio personal hacia Sócrates, pues éste le había recriminado en público educar a su hijo sólo para ser un curtidor como él. los otros dos acusadores- Meleto, un oscuro poeta , y Licón, un orador ampuloso- no parecian tener argumentos serios contra Sócrates, y se dice que eran simples comparsas de Anito, incluso comprados por éste. la famosa frase la dijo en ocasion de visitar el oráculo, cuando éste le dijo que era el hombre más sabio, Sócrates se limito a responder que nosabiendo nada no podia ense?ar nada, y que reconocer nuestra propia ignorancia es el primer paso hacia el entendimiento y la sabiduria. espero te sean de ayuda estos datos.saludos???????????

Nuestros países y específicamene sus gobernantes son muy dados a copiar todo menos lo bueno.( y hablo en todo el sentido de la palabra), no hay suficientes recursos para una educación de calidad, todo lo queremos regalado y sin hacer el menor sacrificio (incluyo a heterosexuales y homosexuales). <br>  Somos dados a ver la paja en el ojo ajeno, pero no en el propio.  Se habla de marchas de orgullo gay, pero no se concientiza al gay para asumir con dignidad su homosexualidad, y esas son verdades que vivimos día a día.  Veo también como entre nosotros los gays, permitimos y participamos de chistes discriminatorios, no solo para gays sino para mujeres.<br>  El problema radica entonces, en que la educación no está cumpliendo con un objetivo, socializar.

Tratar de hacer entrar en razón a tu mamá y no sentirrte mal porque ella se ponga sensible.. no querer hacerla llorar. <br>  <br>  Pedile para hablar de algo que te preocupa y aclarale que respetás sus posturas religiosas, que simplemente ese mismo Dios que da respuestas a cosas complejas, también puede ayudar a superar situaciones simples. <br>  <br>  Explicale que lastimosamente esos costos están por encima de lo que ustedes pueden pagar. Dale solamente información, no opinión, ya que lo segundo es lo que la haría llorar (es decir, no le digas cosas como eso que dijiste "al parecer "ofrenda" por llamarles, te cobran la oracion o cancion q pidas..."<br>  <br>  Evidentemente ella tiene una necesidad espiritual que busca satisfacer a través de ese método. Ofrecele alternativas  como ir regularmente a una iglesia y hacerse de un grupo de amigos allí, involucrarse en actividades misioneras (el servicio a otros en sí es una gran fuente de satisfacción), visitar orfanatos, etc (eso también le daría perspectiva sobre sus propios problemas). <br>  <br>  El punto que le querés hacer entender, hablándole en su idioma, es que si ella está por un lado pidiendo bendiciones a Dios, no puede estar causando un da?o al mismo tiempo. Es una contradicción. Si es una situación financiera delicada, ella tiene que entender que a Dios no le gusta que hagamos las cosas de forma egoísta, sin pensar si nuestras acciones tienen efectos negativos en los demás, a pesar de las buenas intenciones. <br>  <br>  La bendición de Dios siempre está atada a su justicia. Si ella pretende bendición, a ella le toca hacer bien las cosas, y no causar una peque?a injusticia que definitivamente no forma parte de lo que le agrada a Dios. <br>  <br>  Saludos!|`|7de6302249b9c77cc8fabb395db8183faa	Si ella está recurriendo a las llamadas para pedir oración, es que algo debe estarle ocurriendo, trata de ver que es lo que la atormenta o que problema tiene.

(Heb 4:14-16; Ef 3:12.) No?se acercan con temor de ser condenados (Ro 8:33,?34), pero mantienen el temor piadoso y la reverencia que merece tal acercamiento a Dios, “el Juez de todos”. (Heb 12:18-24, 28,?29.)<br>  <br>  El modo cristiano de acercarse a Dios exige sacrificios y ofrendas de índole espiritual. (1Pe 2:4,?5; Heb 13:15; Ro 12:1.) La Biblia dice que tanto los templos materiales como el oro, la plata y las imágenes de piedra no?son de ningún beneficio para acercarse al Dios verdadero. (Hch 7:47-50; 17:24-29; compárese con Ef 2:20-22.) Los amigos del mundo son enemigos de Dios; él se opone a los altivos, pero los humildes que tienen ‘manos limpias’ y ‘un corazón puro’ pueden ‘acercarse a Dios, y él se acercará a ellos’. (Snt 4:4-8.)<br>  El ser humano ha de tener fe en Dios y en que él es “remunerador de los que le buscan solícitamente” (Heb 11:6), acercándose a él en la “plena seguridad de la fe”. (Heb 10:22, 38,?39.) Es esencial que todos reconozcamos nuestra condición pecaminosa, y si una persona ha cometido pecados graves, que ‘ablande el rostro de Jehová’ (1Sa 13:12; Da 9:13), ablandando primero su propio corazón con arrepentimiento, humildad y contrición sinceros. (2Cr 34:26-28; Sl 51:16,?17; 119:58.) Entonces, es posible que Dios se deje rogar, le otorgue perdón y le oiga con favor (2Re 13:4; 2Cr 7:13,?14; 33:10-13; Snt 4:8-10); de ese modo ya no?volverá a sentir que Dios ha ‘obstruido el acceso a él mismo con una masa de nubes, para que no?pase la oración’. (Lam 3:40-44.) Aunque quizás Dios no?retire por completo su oído, no?obstante, si la persona no?sigue su consejo, sus oraciones pueden ser “estorbadas”. (1Pe 3:7.) Los que buscan perdón deben perdonar a otros. (Mt 6:14,?15; Mr 11:25; Lu 11:4.)<br>  muestrales estos textos para que te entienda y asi veras que si ella es humilde y capta el mensaje no volvera a llamar a esos pastores mentirosos que solo robar a la gente saben y que ademas DIOS NO LOS ESCUCHA.|`|dpRAQXW0aa	No seas tan incongruente y respeta los gustos de tu madre, ?o qué? ?No es un mandamiento de tu religión "Honrarás a tu padre y a tu madre?

Chau,que Dios te bendiga.|`|OIcIqvOUaa	Bueno, la Biblia no nos da información precisa acerca de este asunto. Así que debemos hacer un peque?o razonamiento para esbozar una respuesta. La Biblia dice que en el cielo moran personas que han muerto y han resucitado. Estas personas poseen cuerpos glorificados. En 1 Corintios 15:35, Pablo hace una pregunta interesante. Dice así: “Pero dirá alguno: ?Cómo resucitarán los muertos? ?Con qué cuerpo vendrán?”<br>  <br>  Lo que resta del pasaje bíblico es la respuesta a esta pregunta. Note lo que dice una parte de la respuesta. 1 Corintios 15:42-44 “Así también es la resurrección de los muertos. Se siembra en corrupción, resucitará en incorrupción. Se siembra en deshonra, resucitará en gloria; se siembra en debilidad, resucitará en poder. Se siembra cuerpo animal, resucitará cuerpo espiritual. Hay cuerpo animal, y hay cuerpo espiritual.”<br>  <br>  Los cuerpos resucitados serán incorruptibles, gloriosos, poderosos y espirituales. Todo esto nos hace pensar en plenitud absoluta. Si alguien murió siendo viejo y estando gravemente enfermo, quizá con su cuerpo deforme por la enfermedad, una vez que resucite tendrá un cuerpo en plenitud. Libre de vejez, libre de enfermedad. Un cuerpo vigoroso, poderoso y espiritual. Es como haber regresado en el tiempo.<br>  <br>  Si esto es posible ?Por qué no va a ser posible que alguien que muere siendo ni?o, cuando resucite sea avanzado en el tiempo hasta tener un cuerpo en absoluta plenitud? Yo sé que no se puede ser dogmático en esto, pero hasta donde yo puedo entender, en el cielo no habrá ni?os ni viejos, sino solo personas en su máxima plenitud por la eternidad.|`|SDHvDNGJaa	No lo se, solo se que la idea de un cielo es atractiva, alentadora y puede guiar tu conducta durante toda la vida.<br>  Saludos!|`|kdYpMg1taa	al cementerio|`|KCBGnSXiaa	Hola: A mi mejor entender,al cielo llegaran los escogidos,no en un cuerpo,pues el cuerpo pertenece al polvo y al polvo ira; sino sus almas.<br>   Entonces,todo sera uniforme,en orden.No habrá<br>  tiempo ni espacio.Los unos serán los otros.Y todas las almas estarán reunidas para cantar y alabar el Santo Nombre de Dios.

Este ser era descrito como un animal blanco con cuerpo de caballo, barba de chivo, patas de ciervo y cola de jabalío de león , con un cuerno espiral en su frente que crecía recto hacia delante. El cuerno era blanco en la base, rojo en la punta y ***** en el medio. Sus ojos eran azules.

UEjNttguaa	Eduardme. Tú pregunta es profunda a pesar de lo infantil que parece. Hay muchos elementos por considerar. Uno de ellos es que es necesario ver que las cosas no se han creado así como ací, pués todo en el Universo tiene un orden perfecto, que también existe en el microuniverso. Nuestros cuerpos son una maravilla de perfección y no son así por pura suerte. Hay una mente maestra, que algunos llaman Dios, otros Naturaleza, etc...Basta con saber algo de las leyes no terrenas para darse cuenta del poder creador de esa mente superior. Hay que reconocer que en casos de urgencia, de cualquier tipo, nos volvemos a ese Dios para pedir.|`|59e45f8a5e39c6dbbd90d09e810322f9aa	En primer lugar debo decirte que <br>  EL HOMBRE CREO A DIOS del mismo modo que lo hizo con la ciencia y la filosofía.<br>  DIOS es un producto cultural surgido como hipótesis primitiva para dar explicación de los fenómenos<br>  Hipótesis que como tal hoy está superada por mas que nunca falte quien la recicle<br>  DIOS, es una hipótesis que la ciencia no necesita y como es una creación humana, UN PRODUCTO CULTURAL, hecho a imagen y semejanza del hombre, tiene los mismos defectos y virtudes que su creador, de manera que,<br>   a mi modo de ver, LOS QUE TENEMOS QUE HACER ALGO POR LOS NI?OS, ALGO CONTRA LOS CORRUPTOS etc, somos los creadores de DIOS, porque DIOS como producto humano que se aloja en las cabezas de quienes creen, HACE Y ES COMO SU CREADOR, HACE Y ES COMO EL HOMBRE MISMO QUE LO CREO.<br>  Yo particularmente prescindo de la idea de DIOS como ordenador de mis sentimientos y mi interioridad, <br>  no considero necesaria la idea de DIOS, pero se que existe en la cabeza de los que creen<br>  NO EXISTE EN MI CABEZA , pero si en la de otros muchos<br>  y esta es la diferencia de quien cree y quien no cree<br>  El que cree tiene mucha dificultad para aceptar que alguien no crea y mucho menos que piense que <br>  EL HOMBRE CREO A DIOS A SU IMAGEN Y SEMEJANZA.|`|AyCLRkf4aa	En principio debo decirte que Dios hizo al hombre libre por completo.<br>  Esa libertad le permite hacer tanto el bien como el mal.<br>  El elige. <br>  Segun la fé catolica si elige hacer el bien salva su alma. si no...<br>  Segun otras creencias volverá a reencarnar tantas veces hasta que aprenda la lección.<br>  Si esa ayuda que mencionas es porque ves que las personas "malas" estan mejor posicionadas en la vida que los chicos de Africa por ejemplo <br>  es simplemente un problema humano, y no divino.<br>  Esa libertad hace que un gobernante someta a la miseria a una nación y nadie lo castigue.

A esta vida hemos venido por algo, tal vez vos debas aprender sobre esa libertad que te he mencionado.|`|d55fb2af816c14ea8d8456a86945eb7daa	Creo en Dios en forma simbolica como camino a seguir como espiritualidad y como filosofia, no digo que haya un solo Dios hay otras culturas que creen en otra deidad y no por eso estan condenadas o son profanas el fin de la fe es mantener el alma sana pero se ha distorsionado a tal grado que se fanatiza hasta las consecuencias|`|de55b83afbd105d6e80bc93831b9c116aa	Claro mi pana... Creo en Dios como una fuerza maravillosa que mueve todo nuestro universo, visto desde todo los puntos de vista como uno solo pero con distintos nombres. Recuerda que el problema no es Dios sino sus representantes aquí en la tierra, que con su nombre hacen lo que les da la gana y se creen igual que él (Ejemplo... El Papa..) que tuvo el descaro de venir a nuestra América latina justificando el genocidio que se cometió con nuestros aborígenes tildándolo de evangelización. Además si él es lo mas parecido a Dios aquí en la tierra, por que no anda como anduvo Jesús en su estadía aquí en la tierra????|`|uMDnDk9Uaa	Creo en Dios por una sencilla razón: porque creo.<br>  no hay argumento que pueda darte. Es una sensación, un sentimiento. algo fuerte que hay dentro mío que me dice que hay un Dios grande, infinito, bueno, protector, buen padre. <br>  Si buscas más razones, sólo podés encontrarlas en la Teología o la filosofía, por ejemplo.<br>  Creo también que con su infinito amor no pudo habernos hecho regalo más grande que la libertad.<br>  Libertad para elegir entre el bien y el mal; el ahora y el por siempre; la conciencia y el dinero.<br>  Creés que ayuda a los malos ya que son los que  "aparentan" estar bien?<br>  Acaso pensaste que la gente que pasa hambre en el mundo; la que muere a mano de los malos y tantos otros son porque Dios lo quiere?<br>  Entonces, qué lugar le das a la libertad que nos otorga. Y si no nos diese libertad, no podría llamarle Dios, debería llamarle tirano.<br>  La mayoría de la gente que sufre, lo hace por decisiones tomadas por otros hombres que tienen libertad para decidir. Lo peor es que deciden por todos.<br>  Pero esto no me hace dudar de su existencia ya que a quien más haya recibido, más se le exigirá.<br>  No soy una ferviente católica. Practico la religión a mi modo. Rezo el rosario a mi propia guisa y me invento mis propias oraciones.<br>  También me custiono la FORMA en que Dios existe, el modo en que podría darse la Trinidad y tantas otras cosas que para muchos pueden resultar blasfemas.<br>  Pero Dios me dió cerebro e inteligencia para que los utilice!!!<br>  Pero JAMAS me he cuestionado su existencia. No puedo. Es algo que mi ser sabe.<br>  No importa cómo le llamen otros: energía, Yahvé, Cosmos, Naturaleza, Alá, Oxalá... si es Dios de Amor y Concordia... estamos hablando del mismo pero en distinta lengua!<br>  A una misma chica, un hombre la ve maravillosamente hermosa, otro la ve linda, otro la piensa sólo aceptable, para otros es puro huesos, otro la ve gordita. Para un enanito es gigante y para un basquetbolista es bajita... pero es la misma!!!<br>  <br>  Incluso puedes muy bien seguir sin creer.

6oGnDB6laa	Hola morenita<br>  <br>  Con el nombre LA LLORONA, e inmortalizada por una novela, una película y varias canciones,  es una leyenda mexicana del Imperio, según la cual un joven pudiente se enamoró de la hermosa hija de un campesino y hasta gozaron la cama.<br>  <br>  Le prometió matrimonio: que no dejara de ir tal día de tal mes para tal iglesia vestida de novia, para su matrimonio.<br>  <br>  La cosa es que ese  día-mes la joven fue a la iglesia con la aterradora noticia que había una boda, la de su novio con su flamante y aristocrática novia, y a él se le había pasado el otro matrimonio o simplemente la enga?ó.<br>  <br>  Desde entonces no se la volvió a ver, pero al tiempo, viniendo por donde ella llegó ese día, vieron aparecer el fantasma de una mujer vestida de novia llorando por el amor que la enga?ó. <br>  <br>  OJO: he resumido lo irresumible sin contar variaciones.<br>  <br>  La otra llorona es la de Aguascalientes de México, mujer joven y hermosa aristócrática, casada con un buen hombre mayor pero sin dinero.  Ella se llamaba ′Marisa López de Figueroa.  Tuvieron 4 hijos.  El esposo enfermó y murió como es de rigor pero se llevó la llave de la despensa donde estaba su dinero.<br>  <br>  La chica empezó a vender todo para poder comer ella y sus hijos.  Al no haber más, se llevó a los 4 ni?os al río y los aventó, donde murieron.  Luego se lanzó ella.  Los 5 cadáveres aparecieron luego. <br>  <br>  Marisa se aparece a medianoche en un carruaje fantasma llamando a sus hijos, y se pierde rumbo al Río Pirules donde ocurrió la  desgracia.<br>  <br>  Pero debo decirte que la Llorona, con otras variantes también existe en el resto de América y con otros escenarios y motivos.<br>  <br>  En mi país, Panamá, hay dos distintas y se cree que de aquí radiaron todas las historias que luego se aclimataron según cada región colonial.<br>  <br>  Está la Tepesa, y está la Tuli-vieja.<br>  <br>  La Tepesa era una hermosa criolla que le gustaba bailar en los pueblos de las provincias centrales de Panamá, y támbién el sexo. En dos ocasiones quedó encinta pero segúía en las mismas.  Siempre quería que otros le cuidaran los ni?os hasta un día que habían fiestas patronales y nadie se los quiso cuidar.  Era época de lluvia y su casa estaba relativamente cerca de la rivera de un río.<br>  <br>  Cuando vieron que empezaba a llover en el pueblo, ella se preocupó porque había dejado a los ni?os solos y dormidos en la casa por querer bailar y enamorar.  Al llegar al sitio vio con horror que ya no estaba la casa.  Y creyó escuchar a los ni?os gritar, pero corriente arriba.  Loca, se  tiró al agua y empezó a nadar hacia arriba mientras su cabello, vestido y piel quedaron hechos trizas, y nadie volvió a verla.<br>  <br>  Al a?o y con otra crecida, empezaron a ver un espectro que salía del río caminando hacia adelante con los pies torcidos hacia atrás, gritando y llorando MIS HIJOS, COMO ME PESA HABERLOS  PERDIDO.  La gente cuenta que la  primera vez que apareció se escuchó desde el cielo una voz que decía "Te pesa y te pesará", de donde viene el nombre TEPESA.<br>  <br>  La Tuli-vieja, como también se le conoce a la Tepesa, es otra cosa, indígena de los Dorasces, donde invocan al espíritu femenino de la selva para hacer hombres a los ni?os recién desarrollándose.  La invocan, la emborrachan, la hacen tener sexo con los ni?os, la atan, la golpean y le arrancan secretos mágicos, dejándola ir luego.  Ese es el rito de la Claridá, y luego la Tuli-vieja (mama-vieja) se va llorando por los golpes.<br>  <br>  ?Me das estrellas y tal vez la mejor respuesta?

Ok, supongamos que ignoramos al Dios musulman y a su verdadero profeta, Mahoma. O que ignoramos a Buda el Iluminado y la busqueda del Nirvana.<br>  <br>  No, bajo ningun concepto Dios quiere o deja de querer algo. Las ideas de Dios son siempre las mismas, el tiempo no corre para Dios (no quiero reemplazar la palabra Dios por él, porque seria decir que es masculino) sino que Es en su instante interminable, el Ahora "eterno".<br>  <br>   Asi que no toma decisiones al vuelo ni cambia de parecer. Pensar asi es de lo mas infantil. Su plan es perfecto desde el comienzo, sin falla alguna, para eso es Omnipotente, o no? Que si uds fuesen Omnipotentes harian un plan que saben que va a fracasar? O se sorprenderian si matan a Jesus? Ya sabía que asi sucederia, asi lo planeo, y asi fué.<br>  <br>  Lo que Dios siente por nosotros (y por cualquier otra cosa, y hasta por "ninguna" cosa) es Amor.

5tn3eLRmaa	El día de acción de gracias o "Thanksgiving day" Es una tradición norteamericana que comenzó con los colonos ingleses quienes eran nuevos en esas tierras y daban gracias a Dios por la nueva tierra que les dió y por las cocechas que les traían.<br>  <br>  En esa época consistía en reunirse todos como un pueblo invitando a los Indios Chippewa por única vez en el a?o para comer con los colonos en la misma mesa y compartir el fruto de la tierra que pertenecía a los 2 pueblos.<br>  <br>  El due?o de casa corta el pavo por que es la representación (en casa) de lo que en esa época fué el jefe religioso (protestante) de esa comunidad inglesa.<br>  Esta tradición nació como una muestra religiosa de "saber compartir el pan de la mesa con tu prógimo"que eran los índios, y es un pavo por que se le consideraba la carne más limpia y pura en esos tiempos (como en a?o nuevo).<br>  <br>  Esta celebración se realiza el cuarto Jueves de Noviembre en todo Norteamérica (USA y Canadá), pues como ya sabes, son paises formados en su totalidad por inmigrantes que se iniciaron con comunidades colonas pioneras como la que inició esta tradición.|`|zrBbPHK9aa	Se celebra el cuarto Jueves de Noviembre (en USA).

Parecía que la escalera descansaba sobre la tierra, donde yacía Jacob, solo, desamparado y abandonado por los hombres. Arriba, en el cielo, estaba Jehová. Proclamándose a sí mismo a Jacob como el Dios de sus padres, no sólo le confirmó todas las promesas hechas a sus mayores -la posesión de Canaán, una descendencia numerosa y una bendición para todos los hombres (caps. 12: 2, 3; 13: 14-17; 15: 5, 7, 16; 17: 2-6, 16; 17: 8; 18: 18; 22: 17, 18; 26: 3, 4, 24)- sino que también le concedió protección en su viaje y un retorno seguro al hogar.

QUTZD4VRaa	Para empezar, te diré que no ofende quien pregunta de buena fe y respeto, como tú haces.<br>  <br>  A tu pregunta, respondo lo siguiente:<br>  En primer lugar, yo soy católico, aunque, después de leer mi respuesta, lo dudes. No soy de los que obedecen ni dicen amen, sino un católico muy critico porque soy libre y no me dejo "colonizar". Sobre mí no manda nadie, ni me arrodillo ante nadie, nada más que ante  Dios, que es el único ante quien tengo que responder, el día que el quiera, de mis actos. No me gustan los "intermediarios". Los acepto cuando me hablan de Dios, de Jesús de Nazaret, porque tengo necesidad de saber. Acepto las opiniones e ideas religiosas  de todo el mundo, aunque no las comparta.<br>  <br>  Pasando a tu pregunta, te diré:<br>  Según lo que entiendas por "religión"<br>  Si te refieres a que cada vez hay menos "católicos", por ejemplo, tienes toda la razón. Las cifras son verdaderamente alarmantes. En las iglesias o templos apenas se ve gente joven y los poco jóvenes que van, cuando alcanzan una determinada edad, dejan de ir, se van.<br>  En Alemania, por ejemplo, en pocos a?os, han bajado en tres millones menos de fieles católicos.<br>  En Espa?a la Iglesia Católica, que es la mía, tiene un ***** futuro porque, como antes te decía, no hay apenas jóvenes, lo que significa, que el futuro es muy incierto.<br>  Ahora bien, si entendemos la "religión" en sentido, no oficial, sino amplio de la palabra, la gente joven está, en general, muy comprometida con acciones sociales en favor de los mas pobres, de los mas necesitados. Me refiero  concretamente al éxito que están teniendo determinadas ONG′s, donde muchos jóvenes trabajan guiados por su amor y su espíritu de solidaridad hacia los demás.<br>  De alguna manera ?no es esto también una "religión"? ?No es esto lo que predicaba Jesús de Nazaret?<br>  Ten en cuenta que hay cristianos -católicos-  que viven como si fueran ateos y ateos que viven como si fueran cristianos.<br>  Por lo tanto, a mi, como católico que soy, no me importa la etiqueta o el calificativo  "oficial" sino el servicio del hombre en favor de los demás, la ayuda al necesitado, el trabajar por la paz, por erradicar el hambre, la injusticia social.<br>  Los jóvenes se han ido de la Iglesia porque la Iglesia no quiere "renovarse", porque está en manos de una gerontocracia oficialista, sin ideas, ritual, ansiosa de poder, y preocupada únicamente por ascender en su "carrera".<br>  Nuestros sacerdotes, obispos, cardenales y papa son una autentica rémora para esta renovacion. Carecen de la más mínima capacidad de auto-crítica porque la culpa de todo esto la tenemos los feligreses, los padres...<br>  Si yo te contara algunas interioridades de los "intermediarios"...., de su "vida privada".... verías que lo del "tomate" es una tonteria de chiquillos comparado con estas anecdotas.<br>  El lema de la Iglesia, a los jóvenes es éste: O TOMAS LO QUE HAY O LO DEJAS.<br>  Se han apoderado de la voz de Dios, de la voluntad de Dios y se han erigido en sus "intermediarios". Dios es lo que ellos dicen y nada más.Ellos son la única, exclusiva y verdadera Voz de Dios.<br>  ?No dice San Pablo que el Espíritu fluye sobre todos?<br>  Pues como el Espíritu no coincida con su opinión es el diablo quien te ha hablado. Y no hay más.<br>  Las ceremonias se han convertido en un verdadero aburrimiento. No hay ideas para renovar la liturgia y hacerla más participativa, más alegre, más jovial, más comprometida, más evangelica, más activa.<br>  Hoy dia, el único compromiso que tiene un católico es ir a misa los domingos y echar unas monedas en el cepillo. Con eso ya estas salvado y eres considerado un buen católico.<br>  Es verdaderamente escandaloso, por ejemplo,  la interpretación que se hizo en Espa?a cuando el Concilio Vaticano II hablaba de la "participación activade los fieles en la liturgia". Los obispos espa?oles -que dicho sea de paso fueron de los pocos que se opusieron al Concilio y trataron de ejercer toda su influencia para que no tuviera el más mínimo éxito-  enseguida dictaminaron que esa participación había que entenderla como "participación desde el silencio".<br>  ?Qué majaderia!<br>  ?Nos toman por tontos, por incultos, por ni?os de ense?anza primaria?<br>  ?Dónde están los miles de jóvenes que rodeaban al Papa en sus venidas a Espa?a?<br>  Todo era una patra?a y una mentira meticulasamente organizada.<br>  Sé que en la Conferencia Episcopal espa?ola se decía: "Que ningún joven se quede sin ir a ver al Papa por causa de no tener dinero". Esto es totalmente cierto. Y muchos jóvenes aprovecharon la ocasión para viajar gratis o medio gratis y pasar uno o dos días de fiesta, a costa de la Conferencia Episcopal.<br>  ?Qué enga?o! Y los jóvenes han respondido a los jerarcas no yendo a misa ni pìsando las iglesias. Y por cuatro que van, creen que van miles y miles, como hace poco oí en la TV.<br>  ?Qué descaro y poca vergüenza tienen algunos obispos!<br>  Y alardean de que el 80% de los padres pide la clase de religión para sus hijos. ?Para qué, si ni siquiera los mismos padres pisan la iglesia y saben, sobradamente, que una vez hecha la primera comunion no van a pisar más el templo hasta el dia de la boda?<br>  ?Cuanta hipocresía!<br>  Es necesaria, pues, una "eclesiogénesis" urgente o habrá que empezar a cerrar templos y dejarlos solamente para que sirvan de marco arquitectonico para las fotografias de las bodas, los bautizos y los entierros.<br>  Y los pocos feligreses que van, la mayoria son autómatas, mentes teledirigidas, sin preparación ni formación teológica alguna y que al menor ataque, como este, saldrán escupiendo culebras y mandándome a la hoguera por ser "anatema", palabra preferida, por cierto,  del Concilio de Trento y en el que algunos, la mayoria, siguen inmersos.<br>  No hacen falta estadisticas. Observa un domingo cualquiera, en cualquier iglesia, cuántos jovenes acuden a misa, y comprenderás el futuro que tiene la Iglesia Catolica en Espa?a. ?Desgraciadamente, por culpa de sus jerarcas!<br>  <br>  Un saludo cordial.|`|HVqQmBZhaa	los que se  ban son los que  no estan firmes en la palabra y quieren ber respuestas instantaneas   y mas que todo ponen su mirada en las personas  y disen no si este es asi mejor me boy enbes de desir  oye esta persona esta mal   boy a ayudarlo    ;;;pero mejor lo jusgan  y se ban ellos   la mirada ...la fe /  la confianza   debemos de ponerla en Dios no en el hombre   /////////////////////////y los que no buscan de Dios es porque  no ay sufisientes creyentes con balor y esforzados que les hablen de  la palabra de Dios    y otros porque satanas los tiene en sus manos y creen que lo que el mundo les ofrese esta padre  pero se equibocan ya que  satanas les cobra el doble  les tiene una listita guardada    y te cobra   pero  no debemos ser cobardes   la biblia dise  que solo los balientes arrebatan el reino de Dios   pero los cobardes  huyen    ...........espero   seas de los que arrebatan el reino de Dios   bendisiones ....|`|OegbhriUaa	el dinero el consumo y el individualismo van ganando por goleada|`|d1787407674b162123d06943749b9312aa	No, de ninguna manera, pero no te ofendas por mi respuesta, por favor,  eso si aqui en YR habra unos 40 que no tienen idea de si creer en una religion o no, que es otra cosa que creer en DIOS, bueno supongo que multiplicados por unos 5o para ser exacyos seran unos 2000 internautas que creen que la religion esta en baja, comparados con los 8,000'000,000 de creyentes en cualquiera de las religiones, no es para creer que la religion este en baja, bueno esta es una estadistica lo mas real posible, mucha suerte, pero seria interesante que tu hagas tu propia estadistica  REAL, estamos?.|`|ZQq6sooWaa	yo no tengo estadistica pero creo que el problema de la mayoria de la religiones es que cada vez estan mas apartados de lo que esla vida real y solo triunfan en aquellos paises mas subdesarrollados|`|f003111dc574d6b1c67c5c186c8882dfaa	la gente esta cansada de la corrupcion que hay en ciertas religiones <br>  <br>  y ademas esta cansada que le mientan en la cara <br>  <br>  de eso si que esta cansada<br>  <br>  con respecto a las estadisticas las religiones minoritarias en el mundo son las de origen occidental <br>  <br>  aunque pienso que es cuestion de depuracion tambien ya que si la iglesia catolica se volviera del pueblo para el puebo con gente joben y incorruptible pienso que seria un resucitar de la catolica . con respecto a la protestante y hay interes muy oscuros de indole militar economio y territorial y eso no es religion sino otra cosa que no tiene nada que ver con el pueblo .|`|0580623b36ba1d22bba81e05acb0ac21aa	Aunque aun desconosco estas estadisticas, creo que tienes toda la razon...... <br>  <br>  satanas es muy astuto y trata de hacernos creer que la presencia de Dios no existe..... es tan astuto que muchos le creemos y nos permitimos alejarnos de Dios...... <br>  <br>  Es curioso no ? entre mas vamos creciendo mas frios nos sentimos a la prescencia de Dios, por que sera? sera que hay alguien trabajando duro para enfriarnos? y su equipo es bastante grande! <br>  <br>  Pero nunca mas grande y mas poderoso que el Amor, el Amor de DIOS!|`|7KJHONNxaa	Puede ser, por el motivo de que muchas son falsas y debilitan la fé de los creyentes que, confundidos, abandonan la búsqueda de la verdadera iglesia de Dios|`|SDHvDNGJaa	No lo se, la humanidad atraviesa por una etapa de desaliento generalizado y de falta de fe.<br>  Saludos!|`|kdYpMg1taa	quizas
J33X1levaa	Hola, pues mira a mi parecer la oscuridad uno podria decir que es ausencia de luz, pero uno ha escuchado que el ***** es el color que absorbe todo el espectro luminico, en otras palabras la oscuridad es "luz atrapada", en el ser humano yo lo veo de la siguiente forma:<br>  Imaginate a alguien que tiene mucha impaciencia, su impaciencia le hace errar y andar en osuridad, se le escucharia frecuentemente despues de un episodio de impaciencia: Ah es que no sabia, ah es que no me di cuenta etc osea "no vio", pero si esa persona se propone a observarse, a descubrirse y detallito de impaciencia descubierto a examinarlo, reflexionarlo y finalmente eliminarlo... en su momento, gradualmente "ve" o "sabe" como actuar con paciencia, diciendolo de otra manera el mismo a llevado luz a una parte de su psicologia que andaba en tinieblas, si este personaje era el mas impaciente del planeta ahora se convirtio en el mas paciente del planeta, al mismo nivel que se tiene oscuridad a ese nivel se tiene luz si previamente se ha rescatado la luz de las tinieblas...<br>  Es muy curioso que en diversa literatura religiosa se coloca a las tinieblas o al caos como la materia prima para que surga la creación. <br>  Chao Saludos|`|85f3cd2e81939dc2f2894ed2365ce78eaa	ahora ya se porque estoy apagado jajajajajaja|`|IOMFCrxAaa	no es porque me da la luz que proyecto sombras y por eso me pinto los ojos jajaja|`|OEJ36yC2aa	Si tienes sombras es porque algo obstruye el paso de la luz.

7c8db887f2a32a168624377c8bb6a6abaa	Este título, que procede del griego Kjri·stós, es equivalente al hebreo Ma·schí·aj, “Mesías; Ungido”. (Compárese con Mt 2:4, nota.) La voz “Cristo” no?es un apelativo que sirva para distinguir al Se?or Jesús de otros que tengan el mismo nombre; más bien, es un título oficial.  ) Sin embargo, cuando Jesús nació, todavía no?era el Ungido o Cristo. Al predecir su nacimiento, el ángel le dijo a José: “Tienes que ponerle por nombre Jesús” (Mt 1:21), pero a los pastores que estaban cerca de Belén, les anunció, refiriéndose al papel futuro de Jesús: “Les ha nacido hoy un Salvador, que es Cristo el Se?or”, es decir, “que ha de ser Cristo el Se?or”. (Lu 2:11)  El nombre personal de Jesús seguido del título Cristo dirige la atención a la persona de Jesús y a su calidad de Ungido de Dios. Jesús llegó a ser Cristo cuando tenía alrededor de treinta a?os, fue bautizado en agua y ungido con el espíritu de Dios, que se hizo visible en la forma de una paloma que descendió sobre él. (Mt 3:13-17.)  Por otro lado, cuando el título se coloca delante del nombre y se dice “Cristo Jesús”, en lugar de “Jesucristo”, se destaca el cargo que ocupa Jesús, más bien que aquel que lo desempe?a, como cuando se dice ‘el rey David’ o ‘el gobernador Zorobabel’. Recuerda la posición oficial singular de Jesús como el Ungido de Dios, una posición de honor que no?comparte con sus seguidores ungidos. Solo el amado Hijo de Jehová recibe el título de “Cristo Jesús”.|`|38c6d8e59dcccbaf12ae1c9b5aac839faa	Creo que nadie ha dicho que esa palabra griega, Christós (Cristo), significa en espa?ol simple, embarrado. O sea, un ungido es un embarrado, alguien al que se le unta algo, como aceite o cajeta o algo así.<br>  <br>  Así que, sí: Jesús es un embarrado.|`|453c4f95614bac80cc5c3735da845025aa	mesias<br>  o ungido|`|yRmwe9D0aa	ungido. es su apodo, porque equivale al hebreo "mesías".|`|SDHvDNGJaa	La palabra Cristo proviene del latín ?christus? y éste del griego ?christós?, la pronunciación actual se debe al hecho de carecer el latín del sonido jota, a su vez, es una traducción del hebreo ?meshiah? (en espa?ol, "mesías"), que significa 'ungido'.<br>  <br>  Jesús Cristo de Agia Sophia, Estambul, (siglo XII)Título calificativo que los judíos aplicaban a sus sacerdotes, reyes, y profetas, ya que éstos debían ser ungidos en el nombre de Dios para consagrarse a su labor. Los seguidores de Jesús de Nazaret también le aplicaron este título a su líder, llamándole Cristo Jesús o Jesucristo. Con el tiempo, Cristo se convirtió en otro de los nombres propios de Jesús.<br>  <br>  Saludos!|`|25374ab90ba36dc44d3663ebad01a706aa	Ya te dierron la traduccion de la palabra Cristo, pero lo que no te han dicho es una parte de la historia que te falta....<br>  Cuando el Arcangel Gabriel anunció a María le dijo: Tendras un hijo, y le llamarás Jesús.<br>  No dijo nada de cristos , ni nada de nada más.<br>  Cuando Nació el ni?o, ella le puso ese nombre y el ni?o se fue educando y creciendo y preparandose para la gran labor que le esperaba...<br>  De echo se dice que la parte de la biblia que no habla de Jesus , es porque anduvo por todo el planeta , e inclusive vino a América.<br>  Pues bien, Cuando él comenzó a desarrollar su mision, asumió el nombre de CRISTO, es por eso que le llaman JESUCRISTO.<br>  Una comparacion:<br>  Suponte que tienes una hija que le pones de nombre Roberta, pues ella crece y estudia y luego se hace doctora, pues dejará de llamarse Roberta, sino, LA DOCTORA ROBERTA<br>  <br>  Bendiciones <br>  Shaddi<br>  shaddi09@yahoo.com<br>  <a href="http://shaddi09.hi5.com" rel="nofollow">http://shaddi09.hi5.com</a>|`|9Cde4uWLaa	las traducciones hebreas dicen que cristo (jristo)<br>  el mesias o el ungido!<br>  pero esos hebreos y sus traducciones: mujer joven= virgen<br>  etc.|`|WDfeMllGaa	es una palabra hebrea,  "mesías"|`|f5488bdd5a517db2217298435a2a0043aa	YA TE DIJERON<br>  DIOS ES BUENO!!<br>  <br>  CRISTO VIENE PREPARATE!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  BENDICIONES!!
25374ab90ba36dc44d3663ebad01a706aa	Te voy a poner un caso bien similar, alo mejor logro transmitirte el concepto:<br>  Crishna es uno de los cristos que han venido al mundo y como tal, no hay imagen verdadera.<br>  Cada cultura representa a los cristos según lo comprendan, por ejemplo cuando Jesucristo vino al mundo y anduvo por este continente (América) que solo habian indios lampi?os de taparabo y vieron un hombre vestido con tunicas y con barbas, se quedaron asombrados y no sabian como representarloya que era de una raza bien diferente a nuestros indios y los mayas lo representaron como Quetzalcoatl, que es la serpiente emplumada, y si te fijas bien la serpiente emplumada no es otra cosa que un dragón y el dragon es simbolo de china. Esto es para que veas que todo se relaciona.<br>  Jesucristo prometió volver , como lo promete en la biblia, y cuando los espa?oles vinieron a América, se les parecieron mucho a Jesús y por eso nustros indios se confundieron y corrieron a adorarlos y los consideraban dioses, FUE QUE SE CONFUNDIERON.<br>  Crishna realmente existió, como mago te lo puedo asegurar y prueba de ello es el libro sagrado de la India que es el Bhaga Bhaguita, Crishna es uno de los cristos que ha venido a este mundo y cada vez que viene un cristo es a mostrarnos algo diferente.<br>  Cada imagen es una representacion de algo, NO ES LA FOTO.<br>  El color azul es la fuerza, los seis brazos son las habilidades que debemos tener, cada cosa tiene un gran significado.<br>  <br>  Bendiciones <br>  Shaddi<br>  shaddi09@yahoo.com<br>  <a href="http://shaddi09.hi5.com" rel="nofollow">http://shaddi09.hi5.com</a>|`|N9apEpfwaa	deberías de respetar las demás religiones si quieres que te respeten la tuya|`|SDHvDNGJaa	No se, me quedo atenta a las respuestas que te den.

La única forma en la que se le vé con más de dos brazos es en aquella que demuestra su forma universal.  Es azul pues su piel se dice que fué tomada de los cielos y su aspecto andrógino tiene que ver con el significado de su nombre: Generalmente Atractivo.  Debes confundirlo con otras deidades, generalmente en el mundo occidental se presenta con seis extremidades superiores, pero en la religión en si se manifiestan en dos o cuatro brazos.  <br>  Se creé que fué una de las nueve reencarnaciones de Dios, la novena fué Jesús.

Desde la más diminuta bacteria hasta la más gigantesca estrella del firmamento, todo en esta vida nace, crece y muere. Pero realmente nada muere sino que trasciende y evoluciona a otro estado de energía. Tu buena madre tuvo que abandonar su cuerpo por causa de un accidente infortunado, pero su verdadera esencia sigue evolucionando en el derrotero que Dios le tiene se?alado. Ella sigue latente en la cuarta dimensión y debe permanecer allí un tiempo mientras comprende la realidad de lo acontecido y luego proseguirá su aproximación hacia el Supremo. Ya no la puedes ver, pero debes tener la certeza de que ella permanece a tu lado, radiándote su luz maternal y prodigándote toda sus bendiciones. Yo lo creo así, a tan sólo cinco meses de haber perdido a mi padre y después de haber llorado mucho, ahora lo invoco permanentemente con un amor celestial y con la certeza de saber que siempre me escucha y me ayuda. Tu madre no ha muerto...ella ha trascendido al cielo porque Dios quería entregarle su premio, en la misma forma en que algún día, nos lo va a entregar a cada uno de nosotros. Por eso debemos luchar cada día para honrar con nuestros actos a quienes nos dieron la vida y hacernos con ello acreedores al premio que nos tiene reservado el Supremo.<br>  <br>  Fraternal saludo,<br>  <br>  Mauricio Bernal Restrepo.<br>  Bogotá, Colombia.|`|EjX7MFZWaa	esw ley de vida ver morir a los padres. por lo menos tu tendras un bonito recuerdo|`|y9obyqLkaa	Con tigo todos nos solidarisamos...<br>  La vida sigue y ella esta en el reino de los cielos.. piensa en q tu madre ahora no kiere verte triste asiq se feliz|`|LpCscucsaa	creo que es lamentable que los periódicos hagan circo del dolor humano, no debes recordar lo que en ellos has leído, mas bien recuerda como te hablaba y que te decía, si puedes, escribe sus consejos y las charlas que tenían, con los anos esos escritos se volverán un tesoro de gran valor.<br>  el tiempo mitiga el dolor pero en ocaciones hace olvidar cosas valiosas|`|SDHvDNGJaa	Lo siento mucho, mucho, espero que pronto encuentres resignación a tu pena y tu gran pérdida.<br>  Saludos!|`|f0H39HS8aa	Estoy seguro que tu madre te va a ayudar desde el cielo en los próximos a?os.

Algo que no podías esperar... Todavía no has reaccionado a su muerte... Posiblemente, cuando pase el momento de su entierro, rompas a llorar... Cuando en verdad sientas su ausencia.

Y mírate, eres un buen hombre. Honrála con mantener su labor... sigue siendo un buen hombre, y continúa tu vida... Porque su hora llegó, y a tí aún te queda mucho camino por andar. Pasarás una temporada mal, y nunca podrás borrar el recuerdo de éste día.

Además yo tampoco lloré, ni en hospital, ni en el entierro... me sentí avergonzado por mi falta de lágrimas, pero con el tiempo comprendí lo que ocurría: no me estaba dando cuenta de lo que pasaba. No te quiero preocupar más de lo que estás, pero estate preparado porque el verdadero dolor te vendrá con el tiempo, cuando vayas creciendo, avanzando por el camino de la vida, y no puedas compartir con tu madre tantas cosas bonitas que te van a suceder. <br>  <br>  Y tampoco va a estar cuando necesites ese apoyo y consuelo que solo una madre puede dar. Mucha fuerza, amigo, tienes que ser muy fuerte. Recuerda los buenos consejos que tu madre te dió, actúa siempre como si ella estuviera viéndote y haz que se sienta orgullosa de ti. <br>  <br>  Un fuerte abrazo. <br>  <br>  P.D.

Ponte en manos del ser supremo en el que creas, hazlo con mucha fe y verás que te ayudará. Existe una teoría que dice que esas personas que mueren de una forma tan dolorosa, trágica  y repentina, son mártires que ofrecen su vida para nuestra salvación. No sé si creas en Dios y creas eso, pero Yo estoy convencida de que la gente que se nos adelanta de esas formas está en el más allá para "echarnos una mano", para que reaccionemos en nuestra forma de actuar y de sentir la vida. Todo duelo lleva su proceso y sus etapas: negación, coraje, llanto, etc. Puedes buscar ayuda con algún TANATóLOGO, también hay un libro de Martha Alicia Chávez que habla acerca de las pérdidas y los duelos. Trata de seguir adelante, llora si quieres llorar, cuestiona a Dios, si quieres, pero ponte en sus manos. ánimo...|`|jAZnKSKgaa	Mira mi amigo, solo te dire que en estos momentos el unico que te ayudara a soportar tan lamentable perdida es nuestro Se?or Jesucristo, el es la respuesta a lo que buscas, no es necesario asistir a una iglesia, solo pidele de corazon en el nombre de Jesus, el te escucha y solo desea que le pidas ayuda, el te la brindara y luego sabras que no estas solo en estos momentos, el esta contigo y ahora mas que antes, cuidate y que Dios te de fortaleza y fuerzas pues la vida continua, todo lo podemos en Cristo, que nos fortalece; recibe un fuerte abrazo y apreton de manos en la distancia.

En 1920 fundó Self Realization Fellowship (su pág. de internet es www.yogananda-srf.org) y tiene comentarios sobre el Nuevo testamento que revelan que Jesucristo conocía el yoga.<br>  Como dato curioso, te comento que en México, donde yo vivo, el yoga se considera para la mayoría de la gente,  un ejercicio físico, y existen numerosas academias en donde se imparte, al igual que el karate y otras disciplinas orientales. Así, se desnaturaliza al yoga, concediéndole como única virtud el ser un arte de relajación... <br>  Por eso es tan difícil encontrar un verdadero gurú.|`|glUaJS9taa	mira los ke practican eso para mi podra ser relajante pero la verda hay otras maneras menos pateticas  para relajarse.<br>  aparte eso ke dicen ke hasta el espiritu descansa. <br>  pues creo ke es puro pedo por ke el spiritu no descansara hasta encontrar la salvacion y esa la encuentra en Jesucristo. y no haciendo posisciones extra?as e incomodas.|`|32ad95b5833e10bdb704b0a039dedbaaaa	No conozco NADA.|`|VTBrFZr9aa	Con todo respeto fans de las culturas y religiones orientales, estas son formas de cultura y mescla de religiones que están condenadas al infierno por que si no sabes un requicito  para poder salvarse es creer en El se?or Jesús, y como no creo que lo conozcan se irán al infierno, por lo mismo hay misioneros cristianos que hacen esta labor tan ardua de Evangelizar ya es poco el tiempo el juicio del Se?or se acerca arrepiente te y no juegues con el fuego del infierno no creas las mentiras del acusador que te las pone muy interesantes así como el gancho de pescar, Dios te bendice???|`|12818bea70131ce407f0f03925074c88aa	nada ni me intereza+|`|b79e18925ff921b70afd26fb79e8f8e4aa	hola aunque lo|`|1hcu0FYLaa	Todo eso no son "iniciaciones sagradas"  Creí que te referías a cultos mitraicos y de la triple diosa de la luna...<br>  Hay que verrrrrr|`|4CzMWVKSaa	mmmm|`|SDHvDNGJaa	Gracias, admiro la capacidad de manifestar el amor a través de la preocupación por dar placer y brindar placer compartido a tu pareja.

Por ejemplo vos podès pararte a observar un arbol detenidamente y vas a allar en el cosas que nunca pensaste encontrar pero ojo tu mente te puede jugar malas pasadas. Esto te puede convertir en un seguidor del culto del arbol porque solo te maravillo lo que tiene cuando sin embargo no te pusiste a ver màs allà de ello de quien pudo a ver decidido porque tenia que nacer y crecer asì el arbòl que tanto te gusta es logico que no nos pusimos en esa tarea y asì que sacamos el maximo provecho de las gentilezas que tiene el arbòl de sus frutos de sus facultades curativas pero otra vez nos olvidamos de de quien dispuso que tuviera tantos dones. Asi pasa con los de otras religiones porque han sido mal informados se crean de actos y de creencias distorsionadas de la verdad y de la realidad. cuando leas un libro de estos miralo desde otra perspectiva y vas a encontrar los errores en cambio la biblia porque se que tal vez la cuestionaras mirala desde donde quieras siempre te dirà la verdad y por lo tanto te dolerà. Pero tranquilo es solo un dolor de aceptacion no de rechazo. Asì que aprovechà tu tiempo en lo que de verdad te puede ayudar y no lo desperdicìes màs.

Una de las formas de activarlo es atraves de la meditacion,  pero tambien se activa durante el climax sexual, por ello es  tan importante el Tantra,  CUANDO EL ACTO SEXUAL CONLLEVA AMOR  ENTRE LOS MIEMBROS DE LA PAREJA se obtine el resultado optimo,  ya que  se considera que la  sensacion, la emocion etc que se experimenta es la mas cercano a estar ante la presencia del creador. El Libro Kama  Sutra si bien en Occidente se lo ha tomado como una guia de posturas sexuales para  alimentar el morbo, es en realidad una guia sagrada para obtener mayor placer y feliciadad sexxual en elacto sagrado  cuando dos personas se unen en una solo, cuando la dualidad de la creacion se concierte en una.

25c84a27b7d1638791ef021bac94b101aa	Es cierto. Hay por lo menos dos textos en la Biblia que así lo demuestran:<br>  <br>  (Salmo 147:4) - Está contando el número de las estrellas; a todas las llama por sus nombres.<br>  <br>  (Isaías 40:26) - Levanten los ojos a lo alto y vean. ?Quién ha creado estas cosas? Es Aquel que saca el ejército de ellas aun por número, todas las cuales él llama aun por nombre. Debido a la abundancia de energía dinámica, porque él también es vigoroso en poder, ninguna de ellas falta.|`|4a1f6ef585616ec94027b1ebf86be4f9aa	si Isaias 40:26|`|M3V39s13aa	EN LA BIBLIA NO SE MENCIONA QUE DIOS LLAME A TODAS LAS ESTRELLAS POR SU NOMBRE PERO EL SABE COMO LE HEMOS PUESTO A CADA ESTRELLA|`|e229c16357b417bf09555477ee1a4938aa	oooo muy buena pregunta ya q yo tampoco se espero q haya alguien q la sepa contestar correctamente. salu2 ?_?|`|5NsaP4AWaa	A todas ?|`|BtzP8nsPaa	Isaías, profeta de Dios, escribe al pueblo judío, los exhorta a confiar en un  Dios único, Omnisciente, Omnipresente y Todopoderoso y los anima a mantenerse fieles a El.<br>  <br>  Las estrellas eran objetos de adoración para muchos pueblos (la astrología se dedica a eso). El culto a las estrellas no tenía razón de ser para un israelita quien sabía que las estrellas habían sido creadas por Dios y dependían de él.<br>  <br>  Con quién compararán a Dios?  <br>  No lo entendieron desde la fundación del mundo?<br>  El reina sobre la bóveda de la tierra.<br>  Alcen los ojos y miren a los cielos: Quien ha creado todo esto?  El que ordena la multitud de estrellas una por una y llama a cada una por su nombre.<br>  Es tan grande su poder  y tan poderosa su fuerza que no falta ninguna de ellas <br>  (Is. 40:26)<br>  Es creador de todo, eterno, no se cansa ni se fatiga y su inteligencia es insondable.... <br>  <br>  Los adoradores de las estrellas al levantar sus ojos al cielo ven los astros, pero no ven más allá de ellos ( Deut. 4:19). <br>  También dentro de los hebreos había quienes practicaban estas cosas (Jer.19:13) y esto es considerado abominación a los ojos de Dios y trae desgracia al pueblo (por su infidelidad con Dios) <br>  Dios, el Creador, en cambio conoce una por una a sus estrellas y como un general saca a su ejercito y lo cuenta (pasa revista) también lo hará con ellas cuando llegue el día. Ni una faltará.  <br>  El rey David hace similar referencia : “El Se~nor reconstruye a Jerusalén, reúne a los exhiliados de Israel; restaura a los abatidos y cubre con vendas sus heridas . El determina el numero de estrellas y les pone nombre (Salmo 147:2-4)<br>  <br>  Dios conoce a su pueblo. Nos conoce en forma personal.<br>  Eso significa.<br>  Y nos puso nombre desde antes de nacer (Jeremías 1:5)<br>  <br>  "Poner nombre" significa que nos dió un destino, un motivo por el cual existimos..., cada nombre en la Biblia tiene un significado especial. Poner nombre es dar significado a la persona que lleva el nombre.<br>  <br>  Somos hijos de la Promesa que Dios hizo a Abraham (Gen.15:5 ) ( Gen 22:17) (Gen 26:4)<br>  "Mira al Cielo y cuenta las estrellas. Así de numerosa será tu descendencia!"<br>  "Te bendeciré en gran manera y multiplicare tu descendencia como las estrellas del cielo y como la arena del mar." <br>  "Por medio de tu descendencia todas las naciones de la tierra serán bendecidas".<br>  <br>  Por medio de Jesucristo esta promesa, originariamente solo destinada al pueblo de los descendientes de Abraham se hace extensiva a los pueblos de otros orígenes llamados gentiles.|`|W0iUtpQtaa	mmm si la verdad la Biblia es el libro mas sabio, y si las llama por su nombre porque me imagino que cuando juega el Bar?a ya sabe como llamar a Ronaldinho, Eto'o, Messi y Henry...|`|EpfxNhUcaa	Si los nombres de las estrellas son de Dios, mas los de la tierra son del hombre <br>  Genesis <br>  2:20 Y puso Adán nombre a toda bestia y ave de los cielos y a todo ganado del campo; mas para Adán no se halló ayuda idónea para él.|`|SDHvDNGJaa	No lo se realista, pero si se que pone todas las situaciones en su lugar, tarde o temprano.

Siempre me haces meditar... pido disculpas si mis respuestas a veces son largas :D. <br>  <br>  Dios es ante todo la energía que promueve la vida y la creación, Dios es crear, Dios es la energía que transforma y revitaliza el cosmos, por tanto Dios es misterio, y no creo que las religiones, en su intento de cohartarlo en un templo, en una estatua o en miles de oraciones, lo alcancen. Mas sí hay algo que auna al hombre con Dios, con la fuerza divina: es la fé. Dios es la misma imaginación, es la voluntad de sentir, de creer y crear, de superarse, de trascender. Dios es trascendencia, no me lo imagino físico, para nada, porque es un ente como tu lo dices: espiritual. <br>  <br>  Ciertamente los místicos y los artistas tienen estos encuentros con la Divinidad, la Trascendencia, sus experiencias son sublimes, porque se unen a Dios, de manera que se convierten los dos entes, en uno. No creo que en vano mundo de someridades, de falta de fé, de falta de autenticidad, se pueda experimentar ese placer y yo me ubico, porque no tengo un nivel espiritual óptimo. Dios, es curioso, es un milagro porque Dios es sentir, es transformar, es amor, es vivir, es también morir ?por qué no?, es trascender... Dios es la voz que te agita, sin verla, es la luz que te ilumina, sin notarla, es la caricia del viento, que te arrastra, sin tener conciencia de ella... Dios es todo y para cada quién distinto.|`|5NsaP4AWaa	espiritualmente es imposible inmaginarlo ! saludos !|`|Jb8i2sMzaa	Hola!<br>  No puedo imaginarme a Dios como algo fisico como lo ense?an en los dibujos animados.<br>  Dios es algo que no podemos ver pero lo podemos sentir, porque Dios es la escencia misma del amor, es un espiritú invisible que vive en la región espiritual.

Límpiense las manos, pecadores, y purifiquen su corazón, indecisos.<br>  saludos<br>  <br>  Kid Motita|`|a71a745341a1ff0bcc0475fa38bf6389aa	Esta información encontré sobre la explicación del texto de Ezequiel 33:17-19 que solicitabas.<br>  <br>  Esto es lo que Jehová le dice a Ezequiel acerca de ellos: “Y los hijos de tu pueblo han dicho: ‘El camino de Jehová no está ajustado bien,’ pero, en cuanto a ellos, es el camino de ellos el que no está ajustado bien.” (Ezequiel 33:17) Entonces Jehová procede a aclarar la rectitud de su camino al tratar con su pueblo al tiempo de ejecutar juicio, a?adiendo:<br>  “Cuando alguien justo se vuelve de su justicia y realmente hace injusticia, también tiene que morir por ellos. Y cuando alguien inicuo se vuelve de su iniquidad y verdaderamente ejecuta derecho y justicia, será por causa de ellos que realmente seguirá viviendo.”—Ezequiel 33:18, 19.<br>  Lo que vale con Jehová es cómo termina una persona, no la clase de persona, buena o mala, que fuera en el pasado. Si en el día que Jehová tiene para ejecutar juicio se encuentra que una persona que en otro tiempo era justa se ha vuelto a la iniquidad y ha continuado en ella, entonces tiene que imponérsele la pena del pecado.<br>  <br>  Sin embargo, si en la llegada del día de juicio de Jehová se encuentra que una persona que en otro tiempo era inicua se ha arrepentido y se ha vuelto a lo que es correcto a los ojos de Jehová y ha continuado en este proceder, se le perdonará de ser ejecutada como galardón por arrepentirse, reformarse y adherirse a la justicia. Jehová dice que no se complace en la muerte por ejecución del inicuo. Se deleita en el arrepentimiento y reforma de los inicuos, porque eso significa que puede perdonarlos y dejar que sigan viviendo en justicia para alabanza de Jehová. Cuando Jehová castiga o remunera a una persona según lo que es en el día de ejecutar juicio en armonía con las normas divinas en cuanto a lo correcto y lo incorrecto, no hay nada ajustado mal acerca de eso, ?verdad? Por consiguiente en la venidera “tribulación grande” no podemos esperar que nuestro derrotero pasado, si es simple pagarse de la propia rectitud, valga para nosotros.<br>  <br>  Y a continuación te doy información sobre Isaías 55:6-9<br>  En los tiempos de Isaías se hizo la exhortación: “Busquen a Jehová mientras pueda ser hallado. Clamen a él mientras resulte estar cerca” (Isaías 55:6). En nuestros días, tales palabras son aplicables tanto al Israel de Dios como a la creciente gran muchedumbre. La bendición de Jehová no es incondicional ni su invitación seguirá vigente para siempre. Es ahora cuando debe buscarse el favor divino. Cuando llegue el momento se?alado por Jehová para ejecutar su sentencia, será demasiado tarde. De ahí que Isaías diga: “Deje el inicuo su camino, y el hombre da?ino sus pensamientos; y regrese a Jehová, quien tendrá misericordia de él, y a nuestro Dios, porque él perdonará en gran manera” (Isaías 55:7).<br>  La oración “regrese a Jehová” implica que los que necesitan arrepentirse disfrutaban anteriormente de una buena relación con Dios. La expresión nos recuerda que muchos aspectos de esta profecía de Isaías tuvieron su primer cumplimiento en los judíos cautivos en Babilonia. Siglos antes, los antepasados de estos expresaron así su resolución de ser obedientes a Jehová: “Es inconcebible, por nuestra parte, dejar a Jehová para servir a otros dioses” (Josué 24:16). Pero la historia muestra que lo “inconcebible” sucedió, y muchas veces. Si el pueblo de Dios está exiliado en Babilonia, es por su falta de fe.<br>  ?Qué les sucederá si se arrepienten? Mediante Isaías, Jehová promete que “perdonará en gran manera” y a?ade: “Porque los pensamientos de ustedes no son mis pensamientos, ni son mis caminos los caminos de ustedes [...]. Porque como los cielos son más altos que la tierra, así mis caminos son más altos que los caminos de ustedes, y mis pensamientos que los pensamientos de ustedes” (Isaías 55:8, 9). Jehová es perfecto, y sus pensamientos y caminos son inalcanzablemente altos. Su misericordia, por ejemplo, es de tal magnitud que el hombre no puede aspirar a igualarla. Pensemos en lo siguiente: cuando nosotros perdonamos a nuestro semejante, se trata de un pecador que perdona a otro pecador, y reconocemos que antes o después necesitaremos que otro ser humano nos perdone a nosotros (Mateo 6:12). Jehová, en cambio, aunque nunca necesita que lo perdonen, perdona “en gran manera”. él es verdaderamente un Dios de gran bondad amorosa. Y en su misericordia, abre las compuertas de los cielos para derramar bendiciones sobre los que regresan a él de todo corazón (Malaquías 3:10).<br>  <br>  Considero que para poder vivir en un mundo justo es imprescindible ser obedientes a Dios y poner en práctica lo que nos indicaron los textos mencionados.

El sencillamente asistir a los servicios religiosos de manera formalista no puede tomar el lugar de dicha relación. Pero tenemos que ejercer cuidado. ?Por qué? En el primer siglo, había quienes creían que estaban en buena relación con Dios, pero Jesús mostró que estaban muy equivocados (Juan 8:41-44). El apóstol Pablo escribió acerca de ciertas personas que evidentemente eran celosas en su fe y que obviamente pensaban que estaban en buena relación con Dios, pero que no comprendían lo que realmente se requería para tener la aprobación de Dios. (Rom. 10:2-4.)<br>  <br>    ?Podríamos nosotros estar en buena relación personal con Dios si tratáramos sus mandamientos como de poca importancia?

WNZXFSq1aa	En efecto es el Salmo 139 allí se describe, pero el objetivo es aprender que Jehová nos conoce plenamente y de el nada ni nadie se puede esconder,  pues el que algo esté oculto no impide que Dios lo observe. A este respecto, David dijo: “Porque tú mismo produjiste mis ri?ones; me tuviste cubierto en resguardo en el vientre de mi madre. Te elogiaré porque de manera que inspira temor estoy maravillosamente hecho. Tus obras son maravillosas, como muy bien percibe mi alma. Mis huesos no estuvieron escondidos de ti cuando fui hecho en secreto, cuando fui tejido en las partes más bajas de la tierra. Tus ojos vieron hasta mi embrión, y en tu libro todas sus partes estaban escritas, respecto a los días en que fueron formadas [las partes corporales] y todavía no había una [parte corporal definida] entre ellas”. (Salmo 139:13-16.)<br>  <br>  Jehová Dios, quien sabe lo que sentimos en lo más recóndito, produjo los ri?ones de David. Los ri?ones, situados muy dentro del cuerpo, están entre los órganos más ocultos e inaccesibles, pero Dios puede verlos. Hasta puede ver lo que hay en el vientre o la matriz de una madre. ?Jehová puede examinar el embrión en desarrollo! El tan solo pensar en lo maravillosamente que fue formado en la matriz impulsó a David a alabar a su Hacedor. Parece que el salmista se refirió a la matriz maternal con la expresión “las partes más bajas de la tierra”. Allí, ocultos a la vista humana, pero visibles a Dios, se entretejen los huesos, tendones, músculos, nervios y vasos sanguíneos de un bebé.<br>  <br>  Antes de que las partes del cuerpo de David se hubieran definido en la matriz de su madre, Dios sabía qué apariencia presentaría David. ?Por qué? Porque el desarrollo del embrión seguía un dise?o específico, como en obediencia a instrucciones escritas en un libro. ?Cómo ilustra esto la sabiduría de Jehová, y el hecho de que puede ver hasta cosas ocultas! Esto también debe ayudarnos a comprender que Dios creó a la raza humana y es responsable del maravilloso proceso reproductivo que ha dado a cada uno de nosotros su existencia<br>  <br>  saludos<br>  Kid Motita.|`|SDHvDNGJaa	No, no lo conozco, me quedo para conocerlo...|`|UB7wIx0Aaa	hola realista,quiero compartis algo,esto lo tengo en la portada de mi blog:<br>  Carta del Padre..<br>  Mi hijo:<br>  Puede que tu no me conozcas, pero Yo conozco todo sobre ti. <br>  Salmos 139:1 Yo se cuando te sientas y cuanto te levantas.... <br>  Salmos 139:2 Todos tus caminos me son conocidos.... <br>  139:3 Aún todos los pelos de tu cabeza están contados.... <br>  Mateo 10:29-31 Porque tu has sido hecho a mi imagen.. ...<br>  Génesis 1:27 En mi tu vives, te mueves, eres ... <br>  Hechos. 17:28 Porque tu eres mi descendencia.... <br>  Hechos 17:28 Te conocí aún antes de que fueras concebido.... <br>  Jeremías 1:4-5 Yo te escogí cuando planee la creación.... <br>  Efesios 1:11-12 Tu no fuiste un error, porque todos tus días están escritos en mi libro. <br>  Salmos 139: 15-16 Yo he determinado el tiempo exacto de tu nacimiento y donde vivirías ... <br>  Hechos 17:26 Tu has sido creado de forma maravillosa... <br>  Salmos 139:14 Yo te forme en el vientre de tu madre... <br>  Salmos 139: Yo te saqué del vientre de tu madre el día que naciste...<br>  Salmos 71:6 Yo he sido mal representado por aquellos que no me conocen.... <br>  Juan 8: Yo no estoy enojado y distante, Soy la manifestación perfecta del amor....Y es mi deseo gasta mi amor en ti simplemente, porque tu eres mi hijo y yo tu padre....Te ofrezco mucho mas de lo que tu padre terrenal te pudiera ofrecerPorque Yo Soy el Padre PerfectoCada dádiva que tu recibes viene de mis manos....Porque Yo Soy tu proveedor quien suple tus necesidades... <br>  Mateo 6:31 El plan que tengo para tu futuro está lleno de esperanzas.

Por ejemplo, es verdaderamente milagrosa la manera como nos formamos en el vientre materno. Un famoso gerontólogo escribió: “Tras realizar los milagros que nos llevan de la concepción al nacimiento, y luego a la madurez sexual y a la vida adulta, la naturaleza optó por no idear lo que pudiera parecer un mecanismo más sencillo que mantuviera la continuidad de esos milagros para siempre”. Efectivamente, en vista de nuestra maravillosa constitución, no podemos menos que preguntarnos: “?Por qué tenemos que morir?”.<br>  Hace miles de a?os el escritor bíblico David meditó sobre esos mismos milagros, aunque no podía ver lo que sucedía en el interior de la matriz, como hacen los científicos modernos. David se maravilló de su propia formación cuando, según él mismo escribió, se le tuvo ‘cubierto en resguardo en el vientre de su madre’. En aquel tiempo, dijo, ‘se produjeron sus ri?ones’. También habló de la formación de sus “huesos” cuando dijo: “Fui hecho en secreto”. Luego se refirió a “mi embrión”, y comentó sobre él: “Todas sus partes estaban escritas” (Salmo 139:13-16).<br>  Es obvio que no había ningún plan literal escrito para la formación de David en la matriz de su madre. Pero cuando este meditó sobre la formación de sus “ri?ones”, sus “huesos” y las demás partes de su cuerpo, le pareció como si su desarrollo hubiera seguido un plan, que todo estaba, por decirlo así, “escrito”. Era como si la célula fertilizada dentro de su madre contuviera una gran biblioteca con instrucciones detalladas sobre el desarrollo de un bebé, y estas complejas instrucciones se transfirieran a cada nueva célula en formación. Por ello, la revista Science World dice metafóricamente que ‘cada célula del embrión en desarrollo tiene un armario entero de planos’.<br>  ?Se ha parado usted alguna vez a pensar en el maravilloso funcionamiento de nuestro cuerpo? El biólogo Jared Diamond observó: “Reponemos las células que revisten el interior del intestino una vez cada pocos días; las que revisten el interior de la vejiga de la orina, una vez cada dos meses, y los glóbulos rojos de la sangre, una vez cada cuatro meses”. Y concluyó: “La naturaleza nos desarma y nos vuelve a armar todos los días”. ?Qué significa esto en realidad? Quiere decir que sin importar los a?os que vivamos, ya sean ocho, ochenta u ochocientos, nuestro cuerpo físico se mantiene joven. Un científico calculó en una ocasión: “En un a?o, aproximadamente el noventa y ocho por ciento de los átomos de nuestro cuerpo son reemplazados por otros que tomamos del aire, el alimento y la bebida”. Como cantó David, ‘estamos maravillosamente hechos’ (Salmo 139:14).<br>  La estructura del cuerpo humano llevó a un afamado gerontólogo a la siguiente conclusión: “No está claro por qué tiene que envejecer”. Así parece que, en realidad, deberíamos vivir para siempre. Y esa es la razón por la que el hombre intenta alcanzar esta meta mediante la tecnología. No hace mucho que el doctor Alvin Silverstein escribió confiado en su libro La conquista de la vida: “Iremos averiguando la esencia de la vida. Comprenderemos [...] cómo envejece un adulto”. ?Con qué consecuencias? él predijo: “No habrá ya ‘viejos’, pues los conocimientos que nos permitirán vencer a la muerte nos aportarán al mismo tiempo una eterna juventud”. En vista de la investigación científica moderna sobre la constitución humana, ?debe parecer inverosímil la idea de la vida eterna?<br>  ?Se ha apercibido de que vivir para siempre es un deseo humano natural? Un médico escribió en un periódico alemán: “El sue?o de la vida eterna es probablemente tan antiguo como la humanidad”. Según The New Encyclop?dia Britannica, los antiguos pueblos europeos creían que “la gente merecedora viviría para siempre en una sala reluciente con techo de oro”. ?Y cuánto no ha hecho el hombre por satisfacer ese deseo innato de vida eterna!<br>  Bueno, la vida eterna está reservada para los que sean obedientes y fieles a Dios. A tal fin Jesús expresó en Juan 17:3 “Esto significa la vida eterna, el adquirir conocimiento de ti el Dios verdadera y de aquél a quién tu enviasteis, Jesucristo”|`|R42mYURYaa	"Pecador soy desde el vientre de mi madre" aunque no estoy seguro que sea un salmo.

KtWLhab6aa	Perdona que mi respuesta no coincida con la de todos los demás, y espero que no me la quiten hasta que la puedas leer. Mi trabajo de psicóloga me hace estar todas las tardes con ni?os con toda clase de malformaciones: mielomeningocele, síndrome de alcoholismo fetal, causas genéticas varias........<br>  Mi marido es médico y también se dedica a estos ni?os, sobre todo a los recién nacidos. Si no tuviésemos estudios de éstos no avanzaríamos ni en medicina ni en psicología. Este estudio es durísimo, pero nos ayuda a incrementar las posibilidades de estas personas y ayudar a que no vuelvan a ocurrir.

Perfeccionar "el redoble" es un camino laaaaaaargo para el que no sirve ningún atajo.................además de todo esto, los hombres nos acostumbraron a ser "notas de adornos" así que se acepten la realidad y vayan a estudiar en  la escuela de Cheff para que hagan algo por la patria.................Saludos a todos.|`|sh4HJ73waa	Perdón la pregunta que te voy a hacer pero:<br>  <br>  ?ese fue un chiste?<br>  <br>  Si lo fue pues ja ja pero sinceramente no me hizo gracia.<br>  <br>  Si no te has dado cuenta también hay hombre que cocinan, de hecho hay unos que cocinan tan bien y que son profesionales, o sea, que dedican su vida a la cocina.<br>  <br>  Se hacen llamar Chefs.|`|0d9f875f99896081abd50e2c619df1b2aa	Y los hombres tambien...ja ja ja ja ja <br>  buena esa.

Si te arriesgas a prestársela a tus amigos, deberías limitar el paso a las alcobas, a la biblioteca y a los sitios donde tengas mobiliario lujoso (si es ese tu estilo de vida), ubícalos en un lugar donde no tengan que ingresar a tu casa si es posible en un jardín, donde pueden hacer una parrillada, juegos al aire libre, disfrutar de la brisa, de la noche. Si es de día pídeles que alquilen un toldo con unas mesas y así te ahorras muchos problemas. Si vives en un departamento, diles que no, porque es tu responsabilidad ante el edificio todo lo que hagan los invitados en la susodicha fiesta. <br>  Por último si se da lo de la fiesta, diles que traigan ellos la comida, la bebida y los platos y vasos desechables.

5I5ipORzaa	Tienes toda la razón, más aún teniendo en cuenta que el terrible genocidio de Hiroshima y Nagasaki significó el comienzo de la Guerra fría y la carrera armamentisata demencial que ha convertido al planeta en una bomba de tiempo. Por supuesto que los amos de la guerra miden los objetivos logrados en función del resultado y no del costo en vidas..a dicho costo lo llaman cinicamente "da?os colaterales".Durante la segunda guerra mundial, parece ser que la impunidad estaba justificada  por el objetivo supemo de ganar la guerra a los tiranos nazis y sus aliados, cualquiera fuera el método utilizado. Tiendo más a pensar, que la deformada mentalidad yanqui, encontró el campo experimental perfecto para probar con éxito su maldito invento destructor de vidas, amparado por las potencias obsecuentes del resto de Occidente y marcando el principio de su hegemonía política y militar en el planeta..cualquier método es válido para ellos cuando se trata de mantener su posición de poder...Y que me perdonen los que piensen que estoy loco, muchos piensan igual que yo, pues creo firmemente que los atentados de las Torres Gemelas surgieron de alguna oficina de la CIA o del Pentágono, como estrategia para sembrar el miedo  al terrorismo entre la población, generando así las condiciones y los consensos populares que justificaran su posterior invasión a Irak, cuyo único objetivo era apropiarse de su economía e instalar un centro de poder que los direccionara hacia Oriente medio y Próximo|`|0ca491c78bded56d87b3fe8feee60125aa	Bueno,   tal vez,   porque lo  de las torres es mas reciente...<br>  y por nuestra cercania a los Estados Unidos....<br>  <br>  Adios....|`|NjULAhVOaa	Nada más Hiroshima...

Ambos eventos cambiaron la perspectiva del ser humano y ambos tiene gran importancia, la diferencia simplemente son 50 a?os.<br>  <br>  Espero haberte ayudado.<br>  <br>  Saludos|`|99d0d031b03cfb6aec58f6e3466a203caa	6/8/1945 Hiroshima<br>  8/8/1945 Nagasaki<br>  el 7/8/1945, las noticias de los diarios en japón sobre la bomba no ocupaba más espacio que el que yo le voy a dedicar a esta respuesta, pero estaba lleno sobre la ceremonia (preparación) del casamiento de la hija del Emperador, solo al otro día se tomó conciencia de lo que realmente había ocurrido.<br>  No podemos culpar a nadie por lo que nosotros mismos hacemos, no les informamos a nuestros hijos de lo que pasó hace tantos a?os, los periódicas, radio y televisión apenas si lo comentan, pero el morbo si vende, las imágenes del 11/9 las vemos por todos lados y circulan en internet.<br>  Es poco noticia ver a sobrevivientes de aquello que ni siquiera se puede nombrar, tan grande es el desastre, destrucción y dolor que generó una bomba.<br>  Por los muertos y los sobrevivientes, una flor.|`|G1YX1NQ1aa	nada|`|H8GphBZ6aa	Creo que hace bien recordar Hiroshima y Nagasaki como un TERRIBLE ERROR que no debe volver a producirse.
