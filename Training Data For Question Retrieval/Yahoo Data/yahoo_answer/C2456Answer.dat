It is an amazing read with a touch of everything in it from love to war but you could be waiting a long time for the final book. Robert Jordan died last year, there is a statement that he dictated the final book but as yet I know of no publishing date.<br>  <br>  Still one of the greatest Fantasy Series ever though.|`|vSTtAfOWaa	Well I am currently working on the second book in the Inkheart series and it is quite good. <br>  Also Maximum Ride. Those books were very good!<br>  And the Percy Jackson books. They are a bit childish but I think they were still very enjoyable. They were VERY fascinating!<br>  I would strongly suggest those. <br>  And also the Princess Diary books are pretty good as well.|`|9M6UrsYTaa	im reading book one of a series of books.

(lol). Rather than listing whatever I like, I will attempt to address your question, so:-<br>  Three suggestions.<br>  First, Guy Gavriel Kay. he is EXACTLY the man for you right now, start with The Fionavar Tapestry trilogy then move on to Tigana and A Song for Arbonne. His works later than those still have kick, but are lesser. You can thank me for this later!<br>  Secondly, Garth Nix's "Abhorsen" trilogy, a stunning set with everything you could want, trust me.<br>  Thirdly - the wild card. The "Falco" series, by Lindsey Davies. These are historical fiction featuring a detective in the Roman empire during the first century AD - but a LOT better than it sounds! There must be 20 or so by now, the first couple are a bit clunky but then they just get better and better.<br>  Enjoy Steve.|`|PWPLrUFZaa	If you want a good book series then you should try Neal Stephenson's Baroque Trilogy:<br>  1. Quicksilver.<br>  2. The Confusion.<br>  3. The System Of The World.<br>  <br>  I loved these books, they took ages to read and when i'd finished I felt like reading them all over again, which if you've read LOTR then you will know that feeling.<br>  These are not fantasy however, instead they are literature masquerading as a rollicking adventure story featuring such luminaries as Issac Newtown, Leibniz, Louis XIV, Pepys, Wren, Henry Morgan (the pirate), John Churchill (Lord Marlborough) and many, many more.<br>  I can't recommend them highly enough and as the title of the last book implies, it might even teach you something about the world we live in and who and why they designed "The System" we live in today.<br>  Definitely not dull!!|`|bM9Y79wHaa	Northern Lights (Made into a movie called The Golden Compass) By Philip Pullman<br>  <br>  The Davinci Code by Dan brown<br>  <br>  The Sight and Fire Bringer by David Clement Davies<br>  <br>  The Alchemyst by Michael Scott<br>  <br>  Skulduggery Pleasant series by Derek Landy<br>  <br>  Power of Five series by Anthony Horowitz (His Alex Rider series is quite good too.<br>  <br>  And finally... THE BEST SERIES ON MY LIST....<br>  <br>  THE MAXIMUM RIDE series. They are such great books. They are about these six kids (Fang, Max, Iggy, Gasman, Nudge, and Angel) who are very different from normal kids... They have wings and can fly. Genetically engineered to be like that they are on the run from the evil scientists who want to re-capture them and possibly kill them. Oh, and they also have to save the world in their spare time.<br>  <br>  It's a very funny series and there is also some romance in them... Between the main character Max (Who is, BTW, a girl) and Fang. <br>  <br>  READ THEM!!!!!!!!!!<br>  Here's the order<br>  1. The Angel experiment<br>  2. School's out forever<br>  3.

I  am now really addicted to Terry Pratchett's 'Disc world' series.  There are around 20+ books.  It is a series aimed at adults inspite of any deceptive appearances, although it does appeal to many ages.  It is full of imagination, fantasy, storylines, and is laced with a dry wit, as well as more obvious humour.<br>  I really didn't think it would be my taste but it's a series of page turners.

After all, they go to school, sparkle in the sun, and are vegetarians. <br>  <br>  Really and truly, Dead Perfect is my favorite vampire romance. It has the traditional vampires. I like Twilight because it's a series and it didn't end after 400 pages.|`|W0qNkROpaa	It's entertaining.  It may not be up there with the classics in terms of quality, but I found it entertaining.

wTkvkWscaa	Well, I'm not sure if this counts, but I'll share an excerpt from The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath. When I read this, I was almost a little shocked at how well I could relate. I had to read it about three or four times. It's long, so...I apologize.<br>  <br>  "I saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story.  From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckoned and winked.  One fig was a husband and a happy home and children, and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a brilliant professor, and another fig was Ee Gee, the amazing editor, and another fig was Europe and Africa and South America, and another fig was Constantin and Socrates and Attila and a pack of other lovers with queer names and offbeat professions, and another fig was an Olympic lady crew champion, and beyond and above these figs were many more figs I couldn't quite make out.  I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn't make up my mind which of the figs I would choose.  I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet."|`|AA11635487	1.

This topic is my personal fascination (as I'm sure my Avatar name implies).<br>  <br>  There is Happiness The Mood, which is fickle and fleeting. Usually it is the feeling of satisfaction when one achieves or receives desirable things outside of one's self. For example: material things, other people's recognition and validation, vindication, social status, monetary standing, drinking, drugging, eating, etc. This happiness passes when our fascination with those external things fades and then we seek more to fulfill ourselves again. <br>  <br>  Then there is Internal Happiness. This is better described as a pervasive sense of contentment, serenity, peace, and joy. This comes about when you learn to accept, appreciate, enjoy, and--ultimately--love things as they are. It is about learning to love and respect yourself as you are, love and respect others as they are, and to love and respect the world/universe/reality as it is. Not an easy feat, especially for those who feel they must acquire *things* to be happy rather than searching for and tapping the source of true happiness: the self.|`|Hh9sRoZMaa	Anything that you want to protect.

wTkvkWscaa	Okay, I think I understand your question...<br>  <br>  The movie 1408 is based of a short story by Stephen King of the same name. You can find this short story in "Everything's Eventual", which is a collection of 14 short stories written by, obviously, Stephen King.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped...|`|ceBTTCPwaa	"1408" is the second in the audiobook collection titled Blood and Smoke, by Stephen King, released in 1999. In 2002, it was reprinted in written form as the twelfth story in the compilation Everything's Eventual: 14 Dark Tales. In the introduction to the story, King says that "1408" is his version of what he calls the "Ghostly Room at the Inn", his term for the theme of haunted hotel or motel rooms in horror fiction. He originally wrote the first few pages as part of an appendix for his non-fiction book, On Writing, to be used as an example of how a story changes from one draft document to the next. King also noted how the numbers of the title add up to the supposedly unlucky number 13.

A traditional sonnet has fourteen lines in iambic pentameter and a regular rhyme scheme. Sonnets also feature a “turn” somewhere in the middle, where the poem takes a new direction or changes its argument in some way. This change can be subtle or really obvious. Although we English-speaking folks would love to take credit fort this amazing form, it was actually developed by the Italians and didn’t arrive in England until the 16th century.<br>  <br>  Sonnet 116 is a good example.

y8bFwXZEaa	There's no such thing as "instinct" or "instinctive" intelligence.<br>  <br>  Our brains are hard-wired to begin processing information upon the trauma of birth. We are subjected to noises, lights, scents, the taste of our own mouths without any amniotic fluid in them, and of course the feel of other humans touching us.<br>  <br>  Our brains must begin sorting all this out. The fact that some people do it better than others, gaining intelligence faster than others, may be due to at least two things:<br>  <br>  1) their hard wiring is superior, just as some have inferior hard wiring and end up being retarded. In this way, superior intelligence would appear--to people who don't understand the concept of sensations-to-percepts-to-concepts--to be "instinctual," when in fact it is simply better biology.<br>  <br>  2) a better environment and/or better nurturing can supplement this process of sensations-to-percepts-to-concepts. If you are given a lot of loving help, say by your mother, you can read before you begin school, as I was. I remember being taught to read--on my mother's lap.<br>  <br>  How many children get that today?<br>  <br>  Nutrition and mental stimuli, both environmental in nature, also play a part.<br>  <br>  "Instinct" is what tells a newborn calf, foal, or giraffe to stand up immediately. "Instinct" is what tells that newborn where its mother's teats are. <br>  <br>  Humans have no instincts. Their minds must develop, and as they do, the hard wiring causes them to conceive--sub consciously, of course--that they might be able to make the same sounds as their parents and siblings and therefore be understood. The hard wiring does the same thing with the ideas of crawling, standing, feeding one's self, etc. The only role nature plays in this is to get the hard wiring done properly and keep it working.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, some individuals have faulty hard-wiring and we call them "special needs." Those who's hard wiring is superior to most we call "genius."|`|wLwNIxPpaa	the experts say that intellectual success is one part nature and one part nurture.

Most people hate us as a result, even though it is not our fault that we were born with this distinct advantage.|`|uvAjFW8Yaa	Oh yes they can.

hJP9y6kjaa	You have to do a few things.<br>  <br>  First, set your pickup switch to the bridge pickup. This is normally the default for chunky rhythms in rock and metal.<br>  <br>  Can you read tab? You're going to want to play a power chord, it loos like this:<br>  <br>  D -----------  -3-2-------<br>  A -2-2-3-5-  -1-0-3-2--<br>  E -0-0-1-3-- ------1-0---<br>  <br>  These are the bottom three strings of the guitar, the number indicates what fret you're pressing down on, and a 0 means you strum it, but don't fret that string. Usually I use my index finger (pointer finger) for the lower note and my ring finger for the higher note.<br>  <br>  Dial up some distortion. If you strum the chord, it will sound good, but not chunky, not yet. You'll need to palm-mute.<br>  <br>  Rest your palm against the bridge of the guitar - you'll want the fleshy part of your palm to just barely touch the strings, an event amount on each string. Too much palm-muting makes the chord sound "dead" (dampens it too much) and too little won't sound chunky.<br>  <br>  The thing that many guitarists don't focus on is left-hand technique, though - when you strum you should use *both* hands to control the duration of the chord - for a short, quick chord stab you'll want to lift your fingers off the frets just a little bit so the notes don't ring out, this kills the string vibration and cuts the chord short.  Not off the strings, but the frets, if you catch my meaning.<br>  <br>  So... you can do this with any note, any chord, it's just that power chords are the most common. Practice your palm-muting on every string, with single notes at first, then chords later on. It takes some time to learn how to play it well - you can't palm-mute very much on higher strings, as even a little bit too much will kill the note completely, etc.<br>  <br>  When you do palm-mute and do stuff like this, only play the notes that you want to ring out - don't *strum* the guitar, only play the 1-3 strings that you want to sound. Use your left hand to mute the other strings so they don't ring out, by resting it over those strings that you want muffled.<br>  <br>  There are a lot of little things that go into making a palm-mute sound *good*.... just about anybody can palm-mute, with enough practice, but doing it well takes some effort.<br>  <br>  Good luck - keep practicing!<br>  <br>  You can youtube "palm muting" for videos, too, if this was confusing.<br>  <br>  <br>  Saul|`|oM7zA7Jhaa	Heres a simple answer for you, not a long drawn out one ^^^. Rest the side of your hand on the bridge, and halfway on the strings enough to mute them. Then hit any power chord, or the most common, leaving the fattest string open and the next to the fattest string on the second fret, this gives you the deepest crunch chug you can do. Turn your bass up all the way and your treble up all the way and turn the mid down all the way, turn the amp to 11 and crunch!!!!!!!!|`|MmBuqilCaa	Find a good place that will teach you how to play the simple stuff first or maybe a friend on two to learn how to jam with.

Even the Open Source Inkscape if you are into Vector Drawing.<br>  <br>  What matters is that HTML displays jpegs, gifs and pngs most easily.  Further, jpegs have a smaller file size but they are a lossy format while gifs and pngs are what is known as lossless -- so you can rescale them larger without loss of clarity.<br>  <br>  If you are doing this for someone else, the file format still matters more than the program you use to create it, so talk to them then grab a program which creates the format you want to use, and you will find you have a LOT of choices.

Acting is one of these professions (like an artist) that you can just fall into even as a child so technically education is not a requirement.  However, most serious and talented actors have gone to acting school and studied various methods to become as good at their craft as they can.  Just don't expect to be famous - most people who are professional actors are lucky to play a maid or something on a major tv show.  Out of the millions of people who are struggling actors all over the world - only a tiny handfull ever makes it to hollywood - so have a really good back up plan.  I was a thetre design major in college, for costume design, so I was friends w/ a lot of actors.  It's very hard to find jobs in that profession so most of them just gave up trying after some failed auditions and got regular jobs.  I hope youre really good looking and thin - cause there aren't a lot of casting calls for fatties and ugs!  But if you're serious about this go on craigslist.com and start looking for casting calls and definitely move to New York if you're not alredy there.  You can do some theatre work there and there are plenty of opportunities to get into a film as an extra since so many movies and shows film in New York.  LA is good too but it really is just crawling w/ actors - every waitrss has a hed shot and is waiting for a big break.

KADDz1EPaa	The extreme fragmentation of feuds among the heirs, the conflict between the papacy and the German Empire. The decay of the ideals of chivalry, the failure of the Crusades, the birth of the free Italian communes.<br>  by the historian|`|NYU37jfGaa	In 'Life in a Medieval Village' Frances and Joseph Gies write:<br>  <br>  Evolving in medieval Europe over a lengthy period and imported to England by the Normans, feudalism united the European elite in a mutual-aid society.  A lord granted land to a vassal in return fo rmilitary and other services: lord and vassal swore reciprocal oaths, of protection by the lord, loyalty by the vassal; the vassal received as fief or fee a conditional gift of land, to "hold" and draw revenue from.  Older historians, including Marx, generally use the term feudalism for the whole medieval social order, a peasant society dominated by a military, land-owning aristocracy.  Modern usage generally restricts the word to the network of vassal-lord relations among the aristocracy.  The system governing the peasant's relation to the lord, the economic foundation of medieval society, is usually designated the "manorial system".  Feudalism meant much to the lord, little to the peasant.<br>  <br>  The relationships embodied in the feudal and manorial systems were simple enough in theory: In the manorial system, peasants labored for lord in return for land of his own: in the feudal system, lord held lands from king or overlord in return for supplying soldiers on demand.  In practice the relationships were never so simple and grew more complicated over time. All kinds of social variations dveloped, and both peasant labor service and knightly military service were increasingly converted into money payments.'|`|hBHHB8Kxaa	You need 500 food and 100 gold to advance to the feudal age (Figures may not be historically accurate) I would reccomend building sum malitia as soon as you get to that reach that age. Remember to conserve your food for the next age. XD

Great musings here and a superb final couplet!|`|dQmFoRRiaa	Not a sonnet but an ode to the riddle of introspection, made all the more poignant by the recognition that life has gone on -- seasons have passed -- and introspection has not carried the narrator forward; she is literally and figuratively in the same place.  Your line 'What could have been had fallen to the seasons' seems on the one hand accurate because all things do so, yet on the other less than fully revealing because those things had more properly fallen to the (perhaps unconscious) choice of introspective orientation.  This is a consciousness at once self-aware ad self-denying, an interesting semantic opposition.  Formally, the poem breaks from iambic pentameter just enough to add some texture to its phonology.  A generally strong write, but one that has the potential to be even better.|`|ikMOb6gcaa	This is both one of the best I've seen from you and one of my favorites.<br>  <br>  It reminds me of a poem in C.S.

ceBTTCPwaa	El filibusterismo (lit. Spanish for "The Filibustering"), also known by its English alternate title The Reign of Greed, is the second novel written by Philippine national hero José Rizal. It is the sequel to Noli Me Tangere and like the first book, was written in Spanish. Rizal began the work in October 1887 while practicing medicine in Calamba. In London (1888), he made several changes to the plot and revised a number of chapters. Rizal continued to work on his manuscript while in Paris, Madrid, and Brussels, finally completing it on March 29, 1891 in Biarritz. It was published the same year in Ghent.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Filibusterismo" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Filibust...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.viloria.com/elfilibusterismo" rel="nofollow">http://www.viloria.com/elfilibusterismo</a> : El filibusterismo Chapter Summaries (Multimedia chapter summaries in English) <br>  <br>  <a href="http://el-fili.web1000.com/" rel="nofollow">http://el-fili.web1000.com/</a> : El filibusterismo (Summaries and study guide questions in Filipino)|`|AHEFXgE7aa	Here you go,<br>  <br>  Kabanata XXVII<br>  Ang Prayle at ang Estudyante<br>  <br>  Buod<br>  <br>  Si Isagani ay ipinatawag ni Padre Fernandez na isang katedratiko. Labis na iginagalang ito ng binata.<br>  <br>  Ayon sa pari narinig nito si Isagani sa pagtatalumpati ng binata. Itinata-nong ng kura kung kasama si Isagani sa hapunan. Pinuri rin ang pagkakaroon ni Isagani ng paninindigan . Pinaupo ang binata. Nguni’t nanatiling nakatayo si Isagni. Patuloy na nagsalita ang pari. May mga dalawang libong estudyante na raw ang naturuan niya o sinikap niyang turuang mabuti at karamiha’y pumupula at lumalalos sa mga prayle nguni’t walang makapagsalita nang tapatan o harapan.<br>  <br>  Ayon kay Isagani ay di kasalanan iyon na kabataan na pag nagsalita laban sa maykapangyarihan ay kaagad nang sinasabing pilibustero at alam ng pai ang ibinubunga ng gayong paratang. “Baliw ang sino mang magsabi nang malakas sa kanyang iniisip sapagka’t siya’y magtitiis ng pag-uusig,” ani Isagani.<br>  <br>  Sinabi ng prayle na di niya inuusig si Isagani at malaya itong nakapagsasalita ng anuman sa kanyang klase. Sa halip ay paborito pa niya si Isagani.<br>  <br>  Pangiting nagpasalamat ang binata. Sinabi niyang itinatangi rin niya ang katedratiko. “Nguni’t di tayo maguusap dito ng ukol sa ating sarili kaya’t ipinakikiusap ko sa aking katedratiko na ibahin na ang paksa.”<br>  <br>  Maaari raw si Padre Fernandez ay gayon nga nguni’t di raw gaya ng katedratiko ang ibang prayleng Domoniko. At tiniyak ni Isagani ang mga sakit sa pagtuturo ng mga prayle. “Binabawasan hangga’t maaari ang pagbibigay ng mga kaalaman sa pagpatay sa sigla at sigasig ng magaaral. Walang inihahasiksa amin kundi mga kaisipang luma, mga lisyang simulaing kasalungat ng pagkakasulong. Parang mga bilanggong gobyerno ang mga estudyante. Salat na salat ang mga ito sa natututuhan tulad ng pagkasalat ng bilanggo sa pagkaing inirarasyon ng nakasubasta sa pagpapakain”. At sinabi ni Isagani na parang may sabuwatan ang pamahalaan at ang mga Pilipino upang manatili sa kamangmangan ang mga ito.<br>  <br>  Napakagat-labi si Padre Fernandez. Sinabi nitong lampas na sa guhit ng pag-uusap ang mga paratang ni Isagani.<br>  <br>  “Hindi, Padre,” ganti ni Isagani. “Ang mga prayle sa lahat ng orden ay naging mga kontratista ng karunungan at sila ang nagsasabi mismo na kami ay hindi nararapat matuto pagka’t baling araw ay magpapahayag kami ng paglaya. Ito’y pagtanggi na ang bilanggo ay pakanin pa upang di na makalabas sa bilangguan. Ang kalayaan ay katambal ng tao at, gayundin, ng talino at katarungan. Ang pagtanggi ng mga prayle na maging amin iyan ang dahilan ng kawalan naming ng kasiyahan”.<br>  <br>  “Ang karunungan ay hindi ipinagkakaloob kundi sa karapat-dapat lamang,” anang Pari. “Ipagkaloob iyan sa mga walang tibay ng loob at kapos sa wastong asal ay taliwas sa layunin niyon”.<br>  <br>  Tinutulan ito ni Isagani. Hindi raw totoo iyon. “Kung ano kami ay kayo ang may gawa. Ang bayang inaalipin ay natutong magkunwari; ang paghaharian ay lumikha ng mga alipin. Ipagpalagay natin, kahit di totoo, na ang mga estudyante ay mgawalang dakilang asal at katibayanng loob. Sino ang may kasalanan? Kami o kayong nagturo sa amin sa loob ng may tatlong siglo? Kung pagkatapos ng panahong iyon ay walang nayari ang manggagawa ng palayok kundi mga sira siya’y napakatanga marahil.”<br>  <br>  “O masama at marumi ang putik na ginagamit?”<br>  <br>  “Kung gayo’y higit pang napakahangal gayong alam na palang masama at marumi ang putik ay bakit nagpapatuloy pa sa pagsasayang ng panahon, at di lamang hangal, kundi manlilinlang at magnanakaw pa dahil alam nang walang ibubunga ang ginagawa niya’y patuloy pa sa pagtangap kabayaran….. at di lamang hangal , mandaraya at magnanakaw kundi isa pang talipandas dahil ayaw nilang subukin ang kakayahan ng iba sa paggawa ng magiging kapakipakinabang.”<br>  <br>  Nakilala ni Padre Fernandez ang kanyang kagipitan. Noon lamang siya nakaranas niyon—pagkatalo sa isang estudyanteng Pilipino lamang. Anang kura: “Kinapopootan ng bayan ang sundalo na dumakip at hindi ang hukom na nagpanaog ng hatol na pagkabilanggo… Kami’y napapagitna sa dalawang sibat sa inyo at sa pamahalaan . Kung ano ang utos sa amin ay siya naming sinusunod. Ang nag-uutos sa pagpapaputok ay masasabung siya na ring naglalagay ng balas a kanyon”.<br>  <br>  Pinulaan ni Isagani ang pagtatago ni Padre Fernandez sa likod ng pamahalaan. Nangatwiran ang katedratiko. “Ang ibig kong sabihi’y may mga batas na mabuti ang layon nguni’t masama ang ibinubunga. Upang maiwasan ang isang pagdaraya ay nagpapatibay ng maraming panugpo na pinaglalaruan lamang ng mga mamamayan. Maglagda kayo ng isang batas, kahit sa Espanya, at pag-aralan ng mga tao kung paano ito madaraya. Nguni’t nalalayo tayo tayo sa paksa… Kaya sasabihin kong ang masamang ugali ninyo ay di dapat isisi sa amin ni sa Pamahalaan kundi sa masamang pagkakatatag n gaming kapisanan. Ang naghahangad magpatotoo ng lahat ay wala isa mang napatutunayan. Ang mga kapisanan ay nawalan ng pg-iingatdahil sa umaapaw na kasaganaan”.<br>  <br>  “Opo, may pumipilit na sila’y mag-aral.

ceBTTCPwaa	Lorna Doone: A Romance of Exmoor is a novel by Richard Doddridge Blackmore. Blackmore experienced difficulty in finding a publisher, and the novel was first published anonymously in 1869, in a limited three-volume edition of just 500 copies, of which only 300 sold. The following year it was republished in an inexpensive one volume and became a huge critical and financial success. It has never been out of print.<br>  <br>  The work, as Blackmore claims, relied on a "phonogogic" style for his characters' speech, which emphasized their accent and manner of forming words. Blackmore spent most of his consideration in crafting Lorna Doone, as with his other novels, on his characters' dialogue, and wanted to realistically emphasise not only accent but to capture the tone and manner in which sentences and thoughts are formed by different levels of people who would live in the Doone Valley.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/Lorna_Doone" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/Lorna_Doone</a> : Includes Lorna Doone; A Romance of Exmoor overview, about the author, character analysis, setting, techniques, social concerns, themes, literary precedents, adaptations, key questions, and ideas for reports and papers.

The whole opening sounded very intriguing, Forks sounded like an eery ghost town, falling in love with a vampire sounded like heart-break, and even the writing at the beginning seemed to lure me. I was less than halfway through, however, when I was tired of it all. I had walked through that same boring classroom a thousand times, batted eyeleashes at Edward a 4, 5978 gazillion x 3,6580 quatrillion, washed dishes with Charlie more than I could count, and was only slightly relieved when action started to pick up towards the end. My final thoughts: Great beginning, great ending, buts its the middle that I would have been delighted to cut out with a very large pair of scissors.<br>  <br>  Besides, what author in their right mind, would refuse to finish a series simply because their feelings were hurt. So as Stephenie continues to rake in the loads of cash, shes content to leave her readers unsatisfied, with all the loose ends hanging. Thats a cop out, if you ask me. And why... because some trusted friend leaked her draft onto the internet and she heard that the fans didn't like it....ooooh, poor little Mormon girl.|`|ssSFKcriaa	New Moon, though I haven't finished Breaking Dawn.I'm on page 489.<br>  I'm not really sure what team I'm on-I love Edward, but by the end of Eclipse I felt like Jacob would be a better person for Bella.I guess I like them both for different reasons, and maybe I get annoyed with how Bella describes Edward(He's so godlike beautiful, he's mine for the rest of eternity, I don't have to share him with anybody else) That just gets really annoying!|`|3SHu2eEiaa	hmmmmmm......hard question..

I was very sad that Edward had left and it seemed like Jacob was just trying to take advantage of the opportunity.

Humans become hosts for these invaders, their minds taken over while their bodies remain intact and continue their lives apparently unchanged. Most of humanity has succumbed.<br>  <br>  When Melanie, one of the few remaining "wild" humans is captured, she is certain it is her end. Wanderer, the invading "soul" who has been given Melanie's body, was warned about the challenges of living inside a human: the overwhelming emotions, the glut of senses, the too vivid memories. But there was one difficulty Wanderer didn't expect: the former tenant of her body refusing to relinquish possession of her mind.<br>  <br>  Wanderer probes Melanie's thoughts, hoping to discover the whereabouts of the remaining human resistance. Instead, Melanie fills Wanderer's mind with visions of the man Melanie loves—Jared, a human who still lives in hiding. Unable to separate herself from her body's desires, Wanderer begins to yearn for a man she has been tasked with exposing. When outside forces make Wanderer and Melanie unwilling allies, they set off on a dangerous and uncertain search for the man they both love.<br>  <br>  And also you can read an excerpt of The Host on her site too: <a href="http://www.stepheniemeyer.com/pdf/thehost_chapter4.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.stepheniemeyer.com/pdf/thehos...</a>|`|dlmVTt18aa	Yes it was just as good I loved it!

It was accepted by the people and in fact it was a controversy after the world wars whether Germans complied to the Jewish slaughter and were therefore criminals and accomplices.

KADDz1EPaa	Under Hadrian (r. 117-138 CE.) the Roman Empire reached its acme of prosperity. The Emperor, himself a man of remarkable and varied genius, although not always of just and even temperament, seemed anxious to conceal the real despotism of his government by the enlightened use of his power. No new conquests were made, but many internal reforms were executed. Hadrian also was a great traveler, and spent much of his reign going up and down his vast empire, heaping benefits upon the communities with which he sojourned.<br>  <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  In many places where he visited the frontiers, which were not separated from the Barbarians by rivers, Hadrian raised a kind of wall, by driving into the ground great piles. He set up a king over the Germans, and he quenched the seditious movements of the Moors, for which deed the Senate ordered thanksgivings to the Gods. A single interview was sufficient for Hadrian to stop a war with the Parthians that seemed to threaten. Then he sailed by way of Asia and the Islands to Achaia; and after the example of Hercules and Philip he was admitted to the Eleusinian mysteries. He bestowed many benefits upon the Athenians and presided at their games. It was noticed in Achaia, that though many persons with swords assisted at the religious ceremonies, nevertheless none of the suite of Hadrian came armed. He passed next into Sicily, where he ascended Mt. Aetna to see the sun rise, which seems there to form a bow of variegated colors. Next he went to Rome, and thence to Africa, where he heaped benefactions upon the province. Never did a Prince traverse over the Empire with such celerity!|`|BTk2yLqbaa	Generally Hadrian was respected  by the bulk of the people of the Roman Empire. He had considerable interest in architecture and in the culture of Greece. His military reforms pleased the soldiers. There were some  exceptions, however. Early in Hadrian's reign, when he decided to withdraw from Trajan's eastern conquests, a few Roman generals--Celsus, Palma and Ningrinus--considered the order unwise and cowardly. Hadrian's rule began with a purge of such enemies which no doubt led some to fear him. Later, there was a worse disturbance, in Judaea. Late in the emperor's reign, in 132, the Jews revolted under bar Kochba. They may have seized Jerusalem. The rebellion wasn't fully crushed for three years, and the loss of life was vast. It wouldn't be surprising if the emperor was feared in the East for the last years of his reign, which ended in 138.|`|yONm5l5laa	I could be wrong, but I think he was kind of respected.  He wasn't a fierce warrior, and as a matter of fact he had a pretty unremarkable reign, except for expanding his territory (into Britain and the north, I believe), which is why he was respected. If I'm correct he was a pretty peaceful leader.|`|hBHHB8Kxaa	Both, he was fespected!

1rhL8wlwaa	'lo there :) Please don't see my answer as harsh nor rude, I respect your opinion above mine, but I do want to show you how I see twilight as you did ask, so here you go ;p<br>  <br>  Lets see, allot of this is to do with the amount of people who love it, and how extremely they love it, its the same with harry potter "haters", the more people go on about how great harry potter is, the more they disdain it. And the same with Twilight. Particularly the way you girls flip for Edward Cullen (hehe, jealously flashes in every boys eyes ^^), that's odd as he's fictional, and again, it increases dislike for the book by those who all ready don't like it, and increases it for those who do.<br>  <br>  So, the first reason is: if we dislike it a little, our dis-likeness increases as other people start to like it more and more. Why is this? Don't look at me, there's just an inverse reletion ship I guess.<br>  <br>  Secondly, and now I'm going to go into my point-of-view, so bear with me: The romance is just a little *too* perfect, at least, that's what I found.<br>  Everything is just perfect, it all fits into place, take "The Complete Roderick" so many loose ends, annoying, yes, but it's more believable. Twilight Doesn't have that, it's unbeliveable, sure sure, it's fantasy, but when I say "unbeliveable" I mean, the characters behave as you could predict, nothing is just random, etc etc<br>  <br>  As for how well written it was, I can't say I found it engaging, in fact, I was bored out of my mind, surem it was a little tense in some places, but if I had had something better to do at 3am in the morning, I would have put the first book down without a second thought, it just didn't grip me.<br>  <br>  Sorry, for my rant, anyway, hope it's made sense to you reading it, thanks.<br>  <br>  also I'm a science-ficiton fan anyway. ^^|`|ZG6DeAzPaa	As far as being a piece of literature... it is not very good. That doesn't mean Meyer cannot tell a good story. It is not the kind of story that will appeal to most men. It is a little... shallow. It is basically a romance novel for young girls, without any of the sex. <br>  <br>  All that being said, I read all of them and saw the movie. I enjoyed the series, but like I said, it isn't a great piece of literature. <br>  <br>  If twilight were a TV show it would be like a soap opera... the actors aren't very good, but sometimes you can get really wrapped up in it. <br>  <br>  A lot of people are not going to like it because it is making a TON of money when it arguably doesn't deserve to. <br>  <br>  Most people will recognize it as a positive thing overall, because it is getting some kids to read who may not have before.|`|PymVygFraa	Whoa, I love your screen name thing =D<br>  Sun vs Eclipse<br>  Love itt ?<br>  Yeah you can probably tell I'm pro Twilight. (Y)<br>  I enjoy it, and I don't see how it does any harm, and why people would get so angry that I like it.<br>  Okay so the literature isn't great, but that just makes it an easy read, and we like that once in a while right?<br>  =D<br>  xx|`|aVqzz5wAaa	It is an interesting story idea, but Stephanie Meyer ruined it for everyone because she can not right well. She made what could be a great series into a corny, ridiculous joke.<br>  <br>  Also, Edward did not "get Bella pregnant"- it was both their faults.|`|2LXwQc7Yaa	i like the idea and the idea was kinda original kinda like Angel. The characters had flaws which is good. But god bella talk to damn much about how much she loved edward but she was scared.i know nothing simple but my god it would bore me to death. so you know i couldnt even finish the frist book.|`|7z5MOpoeaa	Bella has no personality. Edward is verbally abusive. Stephanie Myer writes like a fourteen year old. The romance is too "safe," I really don't see any passion in it. And, as someone commented on above, the more people that love it, the more I seem to loathe it.|`|knKVjOE6aa	I don't say I hate it I haven't read it but what I've glimpsed at it was in first person I'm not really a fan of first person books and I just don't like the human-vampire romance thing.|`|MZagCrTSaa	The writing is awful. Stephenie Meyer writes like a 14 year old with a big word thrown in every couple of pages. And she repeats the same phrases over and over again...   the one about Edward's "smoldering" eyes and lets not forget 'chagrin'.  The whole book is basically just Edward and Bella proliferating their love for each other, until right at the end when SM decides she better throw some crap in.<br>  <br>  Edward... the man of every girls dreams?  We're talking about a stalker who watches her sleep, won't let her drive or see her friends, get's his sister to kidnap her and even offers up Jacob's stud services...  How is that romantic?<br>  <br>  Bella is supposed to be this average girl with flaws, yet every guy in the school seems to find her attractive.  Plus, all she does is whine.  Whines when Edward goes.  Whines when he comes back.  Whines when she can't see Jacob.  Whines when she can't have sex...  whine, whine, whine!<br>  <br>  The whole series was just painful.|`|yLkU8crqaa	With a plot that's so low I could see it if i had eyes own my feet and characters with near no personable traits, they pretty much suck.

w7USF5wDaa	The book you're looking for is Lucifer by Michael Cordy.  <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Lucifer-Michael-Cordy/dp/0552148822" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.co.uk/Lucifer-Michael-...</a><br>  <br>  Your confusion over the title was probably caused by the fact that Mr. Cordy has written several other books with titles along the lines of The Lazarus Code, namely The Messiah Code, The Crime Code and (oddly enough) The Lucifer Code.  I say oddly enough because although The Lucifer Code seems to be thematically related to the book you read, it doesn't appear to be a true sequel.  Odd.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.  Cheers.

gW0nD5cEaa	I wonder if you mean the 'Gilded Age'. That was the late 1800's and early 1900, after the Civil War, but I don't know the exact time, possibly up until World War I. It was the time of the Industrial Revolution when American industry was growing fast. Yes, people like John D Rockefeller, Andrew Carnegie and others were among the first millionaires.<br>  <br>  Railroads were what oil is today, anybody who owned a railroad was very rich. Rockefeller got rich from oil, he pretty much owned most of the oil when cars and other gasoline powered engines started being used.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure what Rockefeller's attitude toward the poor was, he was said to give out dimes to poor kids or something. But it was a time when people were beginning to have a social conscious. While there were many who looked down on the poor, there was starting to be more concern for the poor, the immigrants, etc. <br>  <br>  "The American Dream' was probably starting to take hold. But many were very poor.<br>  <br>  You'd be better off to look it up in a library or on line, I don't know exactly where. It is a very complicated time in history, like most times in history.

fWxtrZ2Faa	Well, first off, from birth we're not all the same, genetics makes all of us unique and different from each other. Secondly, we are each in different environments, the places we grow up, our parents, the people we meet and the things to which we are exposed. All of this makes each and everyone of us different and that could be the cause (it's not an excuse, mind you, but it could be a cause) of brutality, greed, selfishness, etc. and it's debatable whether these things could also be affected by your genetic code (like "natural born murderers"), but personally I doubt it. I do think that people choose to be the way they are, either consciously or subconsciously; but yes, anyone can change and people do change. Many believe that you never change, but that's untrue and that I know for a fact.|`|WlfHteC7aa	have you read the giver? well in the book jonas is the main character and he practically drives himself crazy after he heard that at one point in time everybody was unique and special in thier own way. Everyone strives to be different in life, to not be the same as everyone one else. That's what colleges look for: that special thing you do, that uniqueness that sets you apart from eveyother person who wants that scholarship. Well if we were all the same there wouldn't be a winners or losers. Everything would be pointless, would have no meaning, and people would not find love. When people look for love, they look for that one special person that is different, that one in a millon person. If everyone were the same we would not find love.....|`|Eecmxr49aa	Two words: Nature and Nurture.<br>  <br>  We inherit traits from our parents, so in a way we already have attributes from the moment we were formed in the womb. When we go out into the world, we are influenced by the environment and the people we mingle with. If all of us are born with the same genetic attributes, each of us are still going to be subjected to different experiences, and so all of us will still be different from one another. The same scenario still holds true if we have it the other way around. <br>  <br>  And to be philosophical about it, life is not worth living if we are all the same. If everybody shows love and respect for one another, how are we going to appreciate these virtues? How can we appreciate love if everybody loves one another in the first place? And how do we appreciate beauty if there's no contrast to it? <br>  <br>  And yes, we can change. But it's not easy as it sounds. Each of us are habit-forming organisms, precipitated by genetics and the set of stimuli that resulted to what we are today. If an attribute is deeply ingrained in an individual, it can be changed by psychotherapy, long-term commitment and a life-changing experience. <br>  <br>  But I am glad we are all unique.

We do have all different skills and talent to show the work of our master.  To prove that GOD does really exist.  Nobody can do or make like humans.

I'd be careful, though, of abstract terms like "chilled" and "cold" because even though everyone knows what those feel like, they tend to be a little trite by themselves. Instead of telling us how it was, show us. How does it feel? What does it look like? Smell like? Taste like? Stay rooted in the five senses and steer clear of abstractions. Good luck!

qienEkR9aa	How to Publish a Book: Approaching Publishers<br>  <br>  Don't write the book yet. If you don't find a taker, you don't want to have wasted your time writing an unsaleable book. And if a publisher does express an interest, he might want to make suggestions about the way you write the book - perhaps a different kind of treatment from the one you originally envisaged, or a format to fit an existing list. If you'd already written the whole book, you would have to do an extensive rewrite.<br>  <br>  Preparing a Proposal<br>  <br>  Make an outline of the whole book.<br>  <br>     1. Set down your title. The publisher might want to change it, but for the purposes of the proposal you need a working title. Make it as snappy as you can. Raising Funds for Charity is more effective than Organising Successful Events to Raise Money for Charitable Projects. It would fit the spine of the book better, too.<br>     2. Write down the first chapter heading, and set out underneath it, briefly, all the points you'll deal with in that chapter.<br>     3. List all your chapters in this way, then juggle them into a logical sequence. This will give you the skeleton of your book, the bones on which you'll build the meat.<br>     4. Type the outline neatly in single spacing, like a letter - this is a document, not a working typescript. Indicate the proposed overall length of the book (its 'extent'). If illustrations are appropriate, say whether or not you can supply them. The publisher will advise you if he prefers to make arrangements for illustrations himself.<br>  <br>  On a separate sheet of paper, type out:<br>  <br>      * A short, concise explanation of the book's proposed purpose and area of interest.<br>      * Why you believe there's a need for it.<br>      * What market you see for it.<br>      * What competition there is.<br>      * Why you believe your book will be better.<br>  <br>  Approaching a Publisher<br>  <br>  Look through the publishers listed in the Writers' & Artists' Yearbook and The Writer'sHandbook and list those who specify an interest in the kind of book you plan.<br>  <br>  Next, check with Booktrust to see what other books on your topic are currently on the market, and if any are due to be published in the near future.<br>  <br>  Decide which publisher looks like the best prospect. Find out the name of the editor responsible for the type of book you want to offer, either by looking on their website or by ringing the switchboard. If the operator doesn't know, ask to be put through to the editorial department for non-fiction books. Ask there for the appropriate name, and check the spelling. Don't try to discuss the book on the phone unless you are specifically asked to do so - all you want is the right name so your proposal will reach the right person.|`|XxtVwslraa	You don't invest money in your book. Agents and publishers invest in you. Definitely worth it if you stick to it. How much you make depends on how much you sell. There's no way to determine it.<br>  This site has a step by step process on publishing and such.|`|gAWWyDLhaa	First, write your book.<br>  <br>  Edit your book several times to make it the best it can be, type it in proper manuscript form (visit <a href="http://www.writersdigest.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.writersdigest.com</a> to find out what is needed), consider joining a local writer's group to get feedback from other would-be writers, and get it proofread by someone who knows what they are doing (don't rely just on spellcheck). Edit it some more.<br>  <br>  There are a tiny number of publishers that accept unsolicited manuscripts (those that don't go through a literary agent), so getting an agent first is a really good idea.<br>  <br>  At the library or bookstore is Guide to Literary Agents, published by Writer's Digest, or Bowker's Literary Marketplace (or visit <a href="http://www.agentquery.com)." rel="nofollow">http://www.agentquery.com).</a> Look for agents that specialize in your genre, and are looking for new clients. Read, and follow, their submission guidelines. In those books will be something about writing a query letter, which is what you send to the agent, first. It's part synopsis of your book, and part explanation as to why your book deserves to be published. You have only that one-page letter to wow the agent, so take the time to make it a good one. Expect the whole process to take lots of time, and expect many rejections. When you are accepted by an agent, they will send your book to publishers, not you. The whole process is free, except for postage, until your book is bought by a publisher. That is when the agent gets their cut (usually 15%) of the money which would go to you.<br>  <br>  If you decide to self-publish, then you will pay (potentially up to a couple of thousand dollars, depending on which publisher you choose). Also, the marketing of your book is up to you. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|ahjqc9Ifaa	someone, I have some bad news. Unless you have either professional training and practice in relationship counseling, or have a relationship which survived some sort of truly extraordinary stress (think Loreena Bobbitt), the odds are strong that real publishers won't consider your book, no matter how good it is--unless you come up with a twist or gimmick which makes it marketable.<br>  <br>  That leaves self-publishing through a vanity press, which will cost you somewhere between $600 and $1500. You'll sell very few books, probably about 50, nearly all to friends, colleagues, and family. Marketing the book will be difficult unless you spend a substantial amount for advertising--more than you're likely to make through increased sales. In the end, you'll probably make no profit but have a net loss.<br>  <br>  So I recommend you visit the relationship and self-help section at the biggest bookstore where you live and see what gimmicks others are using, then brainstorm the hell out of your work and try for a real publisher.
94MyeH19aa	I play guitar not drums, but I'm fairly sure it's the same for all instruments, learn basics that can be used in any song first, I think they're called rudiments on drums, just simplish beats that you can incorporate into a song. and on guitar, piano, saxophone and stuff we use scales, same thing. It might be fun learning other songs but if you want to do something new you can't, John Bonham didn't learn Moby Dick from learning someone else's song. And no sh*t you want to be better than you are, but you cant just say 'i want to be good' you should work out what you want to be able to do, learn one technique at a time and you can add them all together as you go. And to memorise an entire song, sort of picture it in your head, think "this part is all snare, this part is all the drums to my right, this part is like the first part but with a crash on every 4th beat.... something like that.<br>  <br>  some songs that sound like they've got good rhthyms in them<br>  <br>  I got you - Split Enz<br>  Smells Like Teen Spirit, Marijuana - Nirvana<br>  Paradise City - Guns N Roses<br>  Fire it Up - Black Label Society<br>  Back in Black, Highway to Hell - ACDC<br>  Motley Crue - Dr. Feelgood<br>  Bloodline - Slayer<br>  <br>  I dunno if they're good to play or not but they've all got solid kind of rhythms and not fills all over the place|`|HfxE7SEwaa	A good song to just practice to is a song like 7 Nation Army, by the white stripes. Mr. Crowley is also a challenge, but not too hard.|`|d72a8e15b90497f4f828744386c193a2aa	Okay, so here is a little enlightenment from a long time professional drummer. I realize it is a little off subject from your question, but it is the secret to being a great drummer. There are basically two parts to playing drums. The first is keeping a solid groove and the second is your fills, licks, whatever you want to call them. The biggest mistake new drummers make is wanting to learn all of the cool, fast licks they hear someone like Joey Jordinson play. This is a HUGE mistake. You have to walk before you run. I can't tell you how many drummers like this I have come up against in auditions. They can throw down these killer licks but can't lay down a groove worth a crap. These guys never get the gig. Concentrate on playing a solid, air-tight beat and don't worry too much about your fills for now. Some great music to practice to for this is AC/DC. Their music just has a rock solid groove without too much fancy stuff. I know it may get a little boring and may feel you need to play something more challenging, but I'm telling you the guy that can lay down the groove will get the gig every time. Drums are not a lead instrument, they are the glue that holds the band together. Just remember this and you will go far. The zen of drumming is this, it's all about making the band sound and look good, not making yourself look good.

aOy01jFEaa	A soul (psyche in ancient greek) is a form of energy that living beings possess and that maybe survives on even after death. I think the concept of death is also an end of physical life of a living  creature. That mortals live and die. Although we may all know that an energy form such as a soul never perishes even if the body has already left the physical plane.<br>  The soul is an energy that lives on even after physical death. So its possibility of the presence of its own realm could be existing as another form of life after death.<br>  The paranormal world as so much well known connections between realms of our world and of the others. Mysteriously convincing although, still many skeptics are placing bounderies due to scientific principles that justify validity of proven facts beyond it.<br>  <br>  The life after death is actually reffering to the living soul (energy) that never perish from physical death. That particular realm may also unfold after life on earth.|`|bxlYleZkaa	If you think I am going to spend all this time and money being here just to go away and leave it to someone else you have another think coming!|`|gASz3hDWaa	Lazarus was dead, so he was not in the afterlife. Jesus brought him back to life by the miracle of God.<br>  <br>  The afterlife belief comes from heathen beliefs such as the ancient Egyptians that believed the soul departed after death from the body that was integrated into christendom.<br>  The Bible talks of a resurrection of people on the Day of Jehovah that will be on the earth. Where the ones that were once sick will be healed, the lame will walk and the blind will see and the mute will sing praise.<br>  <br>  Isaiah 35:5,6<br>  At that time the eyes of the blind ones will be opened, and the very ears of the deaf ones will be unstopped.?At that time the lame one will climb up just as a stag does, and the tongue of the speechless one will cry out in gladness. For in the wilderness waters will have burst out, and torrents in the desert plain.<br>  <br>  John 5:28-29<br>  Do not marvel at this, because the hour is coming in which all those in the memorial tombs will hear his voice and come out, those who did good things to a resurrection of life, those who practiced vile things to a resurrection of judgment.<br>  <br>  Matthew 5:5<br>  “Happy are the mild-tempered ones, since they will inherit the earth."<br>  <br>  Psalm 37:11<br>  But the meek ones themselves will possess the earth, And they will indeed find their exquisite delight in the abundance of peace.|`|gkoOThQAaa	If you were nothing before you came to life, absolutely nothing and God created you from the nothingness you were, don't you think he is capable of bringing you back from the ashes you will be??|`|i7iQmSgIaa	Yup,third time here,and looking forward to the next,if there  is one.First time-Adolf Hitler,second time -Pol Pot,and now Tony Blair!|`|trMsK86jaa	mono-dimensionally, no.|`|j8iLwnWsaa	You can't at this stage say yes or no. Odds are stacked up against us that this reality that we perceive isn't a true reality. If that's too hard to comprehend, just think of The Matrix; that's a prime example. We wouldn't know any different if we were all really hooked up into some kind of super simulator, so therefore there may very well be life after death if you take into account that the mind cannot accurately determine what is truly real and what is not. I guess it just takes some creative thought to imagine all sorts of possibilities as to why it could be true. You can't prove or disprove it, that's the bottom line. The same goes for the existence of a God.|`|ePt4qPxNaa	No, because the ones, that have died for a little time ( like their heart stops beating for 5 minutes and then the doctors gets their heart beating again) never said that they saw heaven,hell, god or whatever while they were dead, they saw nothing, they felt like sleeping. And you don't feel anything while sleeping(unless you get a dream), so there can't be a life after death.<br>  <br>  But a possible thing is that you might have a dream which you might think will be a life but you won't remember anything at your real life. And you die in your dream exactly the time your brain rottens or something, but which might seem another 50 years to you. That is the only possible way to have an "afterlife". Maybe even many afterlives, as you die again in your dream and have another one and so on...|`|pYj8KZUNaa	we must not see death as the end of life but as a new beginning, we do not know were the road goes but we seem to give it direction anyway. As for religion, each one has a different interpretation of what does or does not happen when we 'die.'<br>  <br>  "I can only show you the door, you alone must walk through it"|`|AA11219693	A simplistic logic informs me that if there is life before death then the possibility of life to be after death cannot be ruled out, and neither can be made into a certainty by any common methods of thoughts, ridden with doubt. The uncertainty therefore looms about the question of life and death. And what is the meaning of life? The answer depends upon how do you believe in life: a chance existence, or a continuum of realities, beyond conditions of life and death as we understand them. <br>  <br>  We could say that there is no life after death, but we are never certain, and neither can we believe without doubt the there is another life waiting on the other side of the line. So, what shall we do? What belief shall we choose to live by? How would we haul our troubled mind out of this torturous sense of certainty overcastting shadows on everything they we do life?  What would be better for us to believe: a life without any chance of continuation, a life eventually conquerable by death, or a life overcoming death? I think death is for life, and in a strange way all for living, and no the other way round, i.e. life is not for death and dying.<br>  <br>  I think death is for life, and in a strange way all for living, and no the other way round, i.e. life is not for death and dying. I therefore believe all thoughts of death are meant to serve the purpose of enhancing life that is here and now, and any concerns or fears of related to them irrational and immature if not for this very purpose.|`|fAjJnfN9aa	It can depend on whether you are a monist or a dualist.

If yes, then you need to warm-up your feet and ankles really intensively. dehydration can be causing this or poor warm-up regime.

shVgCizBaa	One way or another, the Greeks used the mythic interaction (conflict, rivalry) between Zeus and Prometheus as a means of delineating the human condition and defining human society as intermediate between the animal kingdom and the heavenly one. The myth accounts for our status and condition: neither bestial nor divine. The two primary sources seem to take contradictory approaches: HESIOD shows why we lost intimacy (equality?) with the gods; AESCHYLUS demonstrates our advancement from animal-like witlessness. The earlier (most explicitly in the Works and Days) explains why we no longer live in a golden age of 'care-less' enjoyment; the second, why we have succeeded in exploiting and fulfilling our potential for advanced civilization. The first tells us why we have declined to our present condition; the second why we have risen to it.<br>  <br>  HESIOD seems to have humans initially enjoying a state of ambiguous intimacy with the gods. But under Prometheus' sponsorship / advocacy / benefaction we learn that Zeus' wisdom defies trickery and competition. The attempt to subvert Zeus' powers / prerogatives / will ends in increased pain and loss of privilege. Hereafter, human life is full of evils--some invisible, others visible but concealed under desirable, good appearances. Pandora is then analogous to the sacrificial offerings we use to communicate with the gods, and therefore our just desert.<br>  <br>  Henceforth, we live under necessity--the necessity of working, cooking, marrying, reproducing, and dying. In marriage and work, we have to plant seeds and to labor in order to make a living (from the soil) and to ensure the continuation of the race. Every birth / growth presupposes a prior burial of the seed, every life presumes death, all abundance comes from toil, all human life is lived under the condition of Pandora (and the necessity of constant replenishment). [Similarly, the dynamic in the biblical Genesis narrative is that of humankind seeking repeatedly to break down boundaries between Heaven and Earth--usurping God's privileges first in the garden, then ambigously before the flood (ch. 6), and finally with the Tower of Babel (ch. 11)]<br>  <br>  Of course, Hesiod's gloomy, but real, conditions of human life are ameliorated simultaneously by the beneficent order of Zeus' Olympian regime, as that order is suggested at the end of the poem by the names and significances of his offspring and by his distribution of honors and responsibilities among his extended family members. The human condition experiences a complementary 'double' shift in the course of the Theogony: it becomes more troubled and laborious and, simultaneously, more ordered and regulated. The poem 'creates' our neediness, and then it 'fulfills' our needs. It gives us the children of Night, but also the children of Zeus (and also those of Nereus and Oceanus, including the nurturing Hecate).<br>  <br>  AESCHYLUS, on the other hand, has us totally 'clueless' to begin with, but enjoying the benefits of advanced technology, the advantages of the liberal arts and sciences, at the end. Yet we (like Adam and Eve, like Oedipus) must also suffer the possible or likely consequences of this almost limitless pursuit of knowledge. The 'down side' of our progress is that the arrogant (Prometheus) bring about their own destruction. Plundering the privileges and treasures of the gods (playing 'God') may not bring happiness and security, but instead world-threatening catastrophe. Lacking foreknowledge (Prometheus' 'theft' from us), we hope for progress and improved conditions, but we have to accept the consequences we can no longer foresee.<br>  <br>  Thus, both versions of the Prometheus myth address the human condition in relationship to POTENTIAL (lost or gained) and LIMITS--and difficulty we may have accepting and living with the limitations of our human nature.<br>  <br>  [This is also one of far-shooting Apollo's functions in the pantheon--the power to know and to limit knowledge!--to power to excel and to limit excellence--the power to be vigorously young and to limit vigor and youth--to inspire godlikeness, and frustrate it--to encourage arete and enforce sophrosyne--the power to impress. . . from a distance!]<br>  <br>  And HOPE is an ambiguous element in both versions--a 'blessed illusion,' as I think J.P. Vernant calls it in a well-known article on Prometheus--an article which I am summarizing at this point. Hope is what makes it possible for us to live out our ambiguous lives. Prior to Prometheus, in the golden age (perhaps) we had no reason for hope since we lived like the gods. We were 'hope-free; we possessed everything we might hope for. In a totally evil, irremediable age, we would likewise have no use for hope and would be 'hope-less' like beasts. But because of the benefaction of Prometheus and since we cannot foresee exactly how tomorrow will turn out, we HOPE. The myth's structural polarities might look something like this:<a href="http://web.grinnell.edu/courses/cls/s05/cls242-01/Promethe.html" rel="nofollow">http://web.grinnell.edu/courses/cls/s05/...</a>|`|1hvrQYWiaa	Prometheus stole the secret of fire from the Gods and gave it to man. Zeus punished him by chaining him to a rock in Hades - every day, an eagle would come and feast on Prometheus' liver. Overnight, Prometheus' liver would always grow back, thus readying him for the same agony the next day.|`|ElAANkM9aa	Prometheus, one of the Titans in Greek mythology, was the god of fire. A master craftsman considered the wisest of his race, he was credited with the creation of humans and with giving them fire and various types of skills and knowledge. His name means "forethought."<br>  <br>  Prometheus was the son of the Titan Iapetus and of either the sea nymph Clymene or the goddess Themis. Atlas* and Epimetheus ("afterthought") were his brothers; Hesione, daughter of the Titan Oceanus, was his wife.<br>  <br>  Titan one of a family of giants who ruled the earth until overthrown by the Greek gods of Olympus<br>  <br>  nymph minor goddess of nature, usually represented as young and beautiful<br>  <br>  When Zeus* and the other Olympian gods rebelled against the Titans, Prometheus sided with the gods and thus won their favor. He held Zeus's aching head so that Hephaestus (Vulcan)* could split it open and release the goddess Athena*. To show her gratitude, Athena taught Prometheus astronomy, mathematics, architecture, navigation, metalworking, writing, and other useful skills. He later passed this knowledge on to humans.<br>  <br>  Champion of Humankind. Prometheus created humans by shaping lumps of clay into small figures resembling the gods. Athena admired these figures and breathed on them, giving them life. Zeus disliked the creatures, but he could not uncreate them. He did, however, confine them to the earth and denied them immortality. Prometheus felt sorry for humans, so he gave them fire and taught them various arts and skills.<br>  <br>  Prometheus was given the task of determining how sacrifices were to be made to the gods. He cut up a bull and divided it into two portions. One contained the animal's flesh and skin, but they were concealed beneath the bull's stomach, the least appetizing part of the animal. The other consisted of the bones, wrapped in a rich layer of fat. Prometheus then asked Zeus to choose a portion for himself, leaving the other for humans. Fooled by the outward appearance of the portions, Zeus chose the one containing the bones and fat. Prometheus thus ensured that humans got the best meat.<br>  <br>  Angered by this trick, Zeus punished humans by withholding fire from them so that they would have to live in cold and darkness and eat meat raw. Prometheus promptly went to Olympus*, stole a spark of fire from Hephaestus, and carried it back to humans. When Zeus discovered what Prometheus had done, he swore revenge. He ordered Hephaestus to create a woman from clay, and he had the winds breathe life into her. Athena and other goddesses clothed the woman, whose name was Pandora.<br>  <br>  immortality ability to live forever<br>  <br>  Zeus sent Pandora as a gift to Prometheus's brother Epimetheus, who married her despite warnings from Prometheus not to accept any gift from Zeus. Pandora brought with her a box containing evil, disease, poverty, war, and other troubles. When Pandora opened the box, she released these sorrows into the world, and Zeus thus gained his revenge on humankind.<br>  <br>  In Greek mythology, Prometheus was a wise craftsman who taught humans many useful skills, including navigation, writing, and architecture. Here, Prometheus gives fire to man.<br>  In Greek mythology, Prometheus was a wise craftsman who taught humans many useful skills, including navigation, writing, and architecture. Here, Prometheus gives fire to man.<br>  <br>  *See Names and Places at the end of this volume for further information.<br>  <br>  Prometheus's Punishment. To punish Prometheus, Zeus chained the god to a rock on a mountain peak. Every day an eagle tore at Prometheus's body and ate his liver, and every night the liver grew back. Because Prometheus was immortal, he could not die. But he suffered endlessly.<br>  <br>  Prometheus remained chained and in agony for thousands of years. The other gods begged Zeus to show mercy, but he refused. Finally, Zeus offered Prometheus freedom if he would reveal a secret that only he knew. Prometheus told Zeus that the sea nymph Thetis would bear a son who would become greater than his father. This was important information. Both Zeus and his brother Poseidon* desired Thetis, but they arranged for her to marry a mortal so that her son would not pose a challenge to their power.<br>  <br>  Zeus sent Hercules to shoot the eagle that tormented Prometheus and to break the chains that bound him. After his years of suffering, Prometheus was free. To reward Hercules for his help, Prometheus advised him how to obtain the golden Apples of Hesperides, one of the 12 labors the famous hero had to accomplish.

Nevertheless we can't operate without assumptions. For example when I get up in the morning, I assume that the floor is going to be exactly where it was yesterday as I get out of bed. (I would take ages if I had to check every assumption as I moved from my bed to the breakfast table.) However assumptions are not infallible. If I see a man on the other side of the road raising his hand, I could assume he's going to hit the person next to him.

An example of this would be when you are getting on a train and start to observe the variety of people riding it and start assuming you know what there story is.

5ny3mhJTaa	Athelstan was the first king of all England, and Alfred the Great's grandson. He reigned between 925 and 939. A distinguished and courageous soldier, he pushed the boundaries of the kingdom to the furthest extent they had yet reached.<br>  <br>  In 927 he took York from the Danes, and forced the submission of King Constantine of Scotland and of the northern kings. All five of the Welsh kings agreed to pay a huge annual tribute. He also eliminated opposition in Cornwall. In 937, at the battle of Brunanburh, Athelstan led a force drawn from Britain, and defeated an invasion made by the king of Scotland, in alliance with the Welsh and Danes, from Dublin.<br>  <br>  Under Athelstan, law codes strengthened royal control over his large kingdom; currency was regulated to control silver's weight and to penalise fraudsters; buying and selling was largely confined to the burhs, encouraging town life; and areas of settlement in the Midlands and Danish towns were consolidated into shires. Overseas, Athelstan built alliances by marrying off four of his half sisters to various rulers in western Europe.<br>  <br>  He was also a great collector of works of art and religious relics, which he gave away to many of his followers and churches in order to gain their support. He died in 939 at the height of his powers, and was buried in Malmesbury Abbey.

gW0nD5cEaa	No, there is no way to say "I'm sorry" for such atrocities as lynching. The important thing is to prevent racists from ever getting that kind of power again. There will always be killers, there will always be racists, but we can not allow that kind of thinking and actions to take over ever again, so there is institutional racism and even murder.<br>  <br>  But it is like 'apologizing' to the Native Americans for taking their lands, or Germans 'apologizing' to Jewish people for the holocaust, sometimes there is no way to say "I'm sorry" for something that horrible.|`|UY2MJtfGaa	No.|`|HXgeesBqaa	The U.S. didn't actually lynch anyone.

sAK1Ghcvaa	Acting is a craft. The very best actors have studied their craft. If you are serious about doing this as a career, you absolutely need to get experience. The best agents want people who are not only talented but, experienced, and who show commitment. College experience is great but don't count out community theatre, regional theatre, etc. The important thing is to get out there and do it.<br>  <br>  Auditions are a separate subject. You can get professional auditions without an agent but it is more difficult. Local auditions are where you should start. Good luck to you...

Where is my White History Month?  My White Pride March?<br>  <br>  In high school I was a straight A student, living in a poor neighborhood with a poor family. My Dad was a veteran. And we were White. I couldnt get a damn scholarship to save my life, not even five bucks worth.  All... ALL... scholarships were given to the "underprivileged" minorities who obviously didnt already "have it made". Not that I regret serving my country, but I was quite literally forced to pick between a shiit job and the military. And only the military gave me money for college.<br>  <br>  Its not fair to compete against statistical facts which bias policy instead of just having a fair policy and have individuals compete against one another on an individual basis.  When people earn their keep based solely on merit and some races naturally are placed at a disadvantage... thats not racist. Thats a fact of their genetic being. Id rather have a White doctor who struggled to survive medical school with all that was against him... instead of a black doctor who was handed a medical degree just to keep up appearances in our society.<br>  <br>  <br>  =====<br>  <br>  If youre arguing with me, then you are wrong<br>  <br>  I never said that anyone is "elite". Nor did I suggest that any one race or group be privileged over others.<br>  <br>  What I said, quite explicitly in fact, was that we each should be treated on an individual basis.<br>  <br>  Regardless of the statistics that happen to emerge that appear racially biased.<br>  <br>  No policy should be implemented which forces our society to balance out naturally occurring statistical trends... contrary to biology.  It should only happen if its a social stereotype, not a biological fact of nature.<br>  <br>  Doing so will only deprive those who are worthy and deserving of their desires in life.<br>  <br>  Yes, we should be treated equally under law. And equally socially as well. I never said otherwise.<br>  <br>  But society and government should not step in to force a bias that is undeserved and contrary to ones individual capacity.<br>  <br>  Such policies are in themselves prejudiced.  They are racially based, stereotype-motivated... and only serve to reinforce a prejudice... and seed animosity and resentment.  <br>  <br>  If a minority "needs" a policy enforced by law in order for demographics to "equalize"... then government is demonstrating how less capable they really are, by proving the stereotype exists.<br>  <br>  ====<br>  <br>  In regards to those who will endure temporary discomfort.<br>  <br>  They are self-sacrificial.

Perhaps a virtue, perhaps not.<br>  <br>  Self-sacrificial... to a minor degree... not to the point of martyrdom, though.<br>  <br>  Those who wont fight, actively, and even die for their cause must not actually be that into it.  How much can you believe in something if you wont die for it?<br>  <br>  At what point does an act become self-sacrificial? Enduring a little discomfort in order to win privilege over in the long run seems more selfish to me... long term planning for what is bound to be self-serving.  Thats what "self-sacrifice short of martyrdom" is.|`|d60812b54bd94ed9b890bbc6003e6400aa	Absolutely!  Anyone unwilling to forgo temporary comforts for the long-term goal is selfish to the point of self-sabotage, and that's just sad.<br>  <br>  It's such a prevalent attitude these days, it's thrust the entire world's economy into chaos.  So many are spending money they don't have and can't ever hope to pay back, rather than living within their means (and being grateful for that) and saving for the things they want, that everybody (even those of us without an over-inflated sense of entitlement) is paying for it.<br>  <br>  Having a goal, even an emotional or spiritual one, requires work and self-discipline.  Part of self-discipline is a willingness to sacrifice temporary discomforts for the long-term gain of comforts.

If you are not willing to forgo some comfort now, you will not be able to make progress in anything you do.  The Rosa Parks example is a sound one, and it also applies to lots of apparently trivial details from our daily lives.  Nobody wants to do the washing up, but we just have to do it!  As Goethe said, "Everybody wants to grow, but nobody wants to change".|`|aZUszuqLaa	You once told me to always be true to myself.  It stuck with me.  I'm sure Rosa Parks felt the same way.

We always get what we "ask" for, however, it may not be what we think we want.

shVgCizBaa	In 1915, the second Klan was founded. It grew rapidly in a period of postwar social tensions. After World War I, many Americans coped with booming growth rates in major cities, where numerous waves of immigrants from southern and eastern Europe and the Great Migration of Southern blacks and whites were being absorbed. After World War I, labor tensions rose as veterans tried to reenter the work force. In reaction to these new groups of immigrants and migrants, the second KKK preached racism, anti-Catholicism, anti-Communism, nativism, and anti-Semitism. Some local groups took part in lynchings, attacks on private houses and public property, and other violent activities. Members used ceremonial cross burning to intimidate victims and demonstrate its power. Murders and violence by the Klan were most numerous in the South, which had a tradition of lawlessness.[4]<br>  <br>  The film The Birth of a Nation and the sensationalized newspaper coverage of the trial, conviction and lynching of Leo Frank of Georgia sparked the Klan's revival. The second Klan was a formal fraternal organization, with a national and state structure. At its peak in the mid-1920s, the organization included about 15% of the nation's eligible population, approximately 4–5 million men.[5] Internal divisions and external opposition brought about a sharp decline in membership, which had dropped to about 30,000 by 1930, and the Klan's popularity fell further during the Great Depression and World War II The second Klan rose in response to urbanization and industrialization, massive immigration from eastern and southern Europe, the Great Migration of African Americans to the North, and the migration of African Americans and whites from rural areas to Southern cities. The Klan grew most rapidly in cities which had high growth rates between 1910 and 1930, such as Detroit, Memphis, Dayton, Atlanta, Dallas, and Houston.[50]<br>  <br>  Its growth was also affected by mobilization for World War I and postwar tensions, especially in the cities where strangers came up against each other more often. Southern whites resented the arming of black soldiers. Black veterans did not want to go back to second class status.[51]<br>  <br>  This Klan modeled itself after other fraternal organizations created in the early decades of the 20th century. Organizers signed up hundreds of new members, who paid initiation fees and bought KKK costumes. The organizer kept half the money and sent the rest to state or national officials. When the organizer was done with an area, he organized a huge rally, often with burning crosses and perhaps presented a Bible to a local Protestant minister. He then left town with the money. The local units operated like many fraternal organizations and occasionally brought in speakers. State and national officials had little or no control over the locals and rarely attempted to forge political activist groups.[citation needed] Stanley Horn, a Southern historian sympathetic to the first Klan, was careful in an oral interview to distinguish it from the later "spurious Ku Klux organization which was in ill-repute — and, of course, had no connection whatsoever with the Klan of Reconstruction days".[52]<br>  <br>   <br>  An illustration from The Clansman: "Take dat f'um yo equal—"The accumulating social tensions that resulted from rapid change were sparked by events in 1915:<br>  <br>  The film The Birth of a Nation was released, mythologizing and glorifying the first Klan. <br>  Leo Frank, a Jewish man accused of the rape and murder of a young white girl named Mary Phagan, was tried, convicted and lynched near Atlanta against a backdrop of media frenzy. <br>  The second Ku Klux Klan was founded in Atlanta with a new anti-immigrant, anti-Catholic, and anti-Semitic agenda. The bulk of the founders were from an Atlanta-area organization calling itself the Knights of Mary Phagan that had organized around the Frank trial. The new organization emulated the fictionalized version of the Klan presented in The Birth of a Nation. <br>  Director D. W. Griffith's The Birth of a Nation glorified the original Klan. His film was based on the book and play The Clansman and the book The Leopard's Spots, both by Thomas Dixon. Dixon said his purpose was "to revolutionize northern sentiment by a presentation of history that would transform every man in my audience into a good Democrat!" The film created a nationwide Klan craze. At the official premier in Atlanta, members of the Klan rode up and down the street in front of the theater.[53]<br>  <br>  Much of the modern Klan's iconography, including the standardized white costume and the lighted cross, are derived from the film. Its imagery was based on Dixon's romanticized concept of old Scotland, as portrayed in the novels and poetry of Sir Walter Scott. The film's influence and popularity were enhanced by a widely reported endorsement by historian and U.S. President Woodrow Wilson.<br>  <br>   <br>  President WilsonThe Birth of a Nation included extensive quotations from Woodrow Wilson's His|`|3sGkmzOYaa	You dont need help you want someone to do your homework, either look in your book or google.|`|rVPrhd26aa	during the prohibition of the 20's dumb hicks got so bored being sober without their moonshine that they would take sheets and pretend to be ghosts. their goal was to scare out all the African Italian and Irish  Americans.

5ny3mhJTaa	The word "democracy," as well as the concept it represents, can be traced back to the area surrounding the Mediterranean Sea. The beginnings of democracy can be credited to the Greeks of the sixth century BC. The word comes from two Greek words: demos, meaning "the people," and kratein, meaning "to rule." These two words are joined together to form democracy, literally meaning "rule by the people" (Pious). The Greek system of government was perhaps closer to a true democracy or rule by the people than any other in history. The Greeks viewed dictatorship as the worst possible form of government, so their government evolved as the exact opposite. Their civilization was broken down into small city-states (never more than 10,000 citizens), and all the men voted on all issues of government. There were no representatives in the Greek system of government. Instead, they ruled themselves directly; each man was a life long member of the decision making body. This was almost a total democracy except for the fact that women and slaves (over 50% of the population) were not considered citizens and were not allowed to vote. Despite this, no other civilization has come as close to democracy as its creators, the Greeks, and many later civilizations have incorporated this Greek idea as part of the foundation for their government (Lee; Lefebvre).<br>  <br>  Ideas of democracy similar to that of the Greeks were used by the Romans, though not to the same extent. The Roman Empire (509-27 BC) took some of their governmental ideals from the Greeks. Their government was a representative democracy, which had representatives from the nobility in the Senate and representatives from the commoners in the Assembly. Governmental power was divided between these two branches and they voted on various issues. Many Roman political thinkers were fond of democracy. The Roman Statesman, Cicero was one. Cicero suggested that all people have certain rights that should be preserved. He and other political philosophers of the time taught that governmental and political power should come from the people (Lefebvre; Lee). After the trend of democracy was started by the Greeks and carried on by the Romans, it has been seen in many later governmental systems throughout history.<br>  <br>  Democracy in the Middle Ages<br>  <br>  Though democracy was not directly instituted in the Middle Ages, many democratic ideas were prevalent throughout the period. Because Christianity, which taught that men were created equal in the eyes of God, was deeply ingrained into the society of the Middle Ages, the democratic idea of equality was understood by many of the people. The Middle Ages, however, utilized another form of government, which was developed during this period called feudalism. Feudalism stressed that all people have certain rights and developed a system of courts to defend these rights. From these courts came the modern day judicial branch of the American government along with many of the ideas such as kings councils, assemblies and eventually parliamentary systems (Sanford 20-27).<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Democracy in England <br>  <br>  In 1215 AD, the Magna Carta opened the door to a more democratic system in England. Nobles forced King John to sign this "Great Charter" that created the English "Parliament", or law-making body, and stated that the written laws held a higher power than the king, thereby limiting the power of the Royal family and giving some of that power to the people. Later, the Petition of Right (1628) stipulated that the King could no longer tax without parliament’s permission and the Bill of Rights (1689) provided freedom of speech and banned cruel or unusual punishment. These strengthened Parliament further and gave the people more right to express themselves. Though these reforms did not make England a true democracy in any sense, they did incorporate democratic ideals, which would later be used to form the government of the United States (Lefebvre; Pious). <br>  also try this site<a href="http://greek-history.suite101.com/article.cfm/athenian_democracy" rel="nofollow">http://greek-history.suite101.com/articl...</a>|`|550e4912823fee98e745442e7bdab33faa	1.

2CdBWZLIaa	Unfortunately, the number of megapixels is useful only as a marketing gimmick to get people to buy a camera that they don't need and which might actually be inferior to a camera with a lower pixel count. It's a useful figure only in combination with the sensor's overall size. A 14-megapixel point-and-shoot will have such tiny pixels that they will be fighting each other over the few photons that enter the chamber. The result is lots of noise in the final image and terrible low light performance. This, of course, renders moot any discussion of resolution. You will actually get a better image from a six-megapixel DSLR sensor than a 14-megapixel point and shoot.<br>  <br>  So, if your camera is a DSLR, the answer is that you can blow it up to display in Grand Central Station (as long as viewed from a distance).

ceBTTCPwaa	Heart of Darkness is a novella written by Polish-born writer Joseph Conrad. Before its 1902 publication, it appeared as a three-part series (1899) in Blackwood's Magazine. It is widely regarded as a significant work of English literature and part of the Western canon.<br>  <br>  The story details an incident when Marlow, an Englishman, took a foreign assignment as a ferry-boat captain, employed by a Belgian trading company. Although the river is never specifically named, readers may assume it is the Congo River, in the Congo Free State, a private colony of King Leopold II. Marlow is employed to transport ivory downriver; however, his more pressing assignment is to return Kurtz, another ivory trader, to civilization in a cover up. Kurtz has a reputation throughout the region.<br>  <br>  This highly symbolic story is actually a story within a story, or frame narrative. It follows Marlow as he recounts, from dusk through to late night, his adventure into the Congo to a group of men aboard a ship anchored in the Thames Estuary.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/Heart_of_Darknes..." rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/Heart_of_Darknes...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/notes/hod/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/notes/hod/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/heart/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/heart/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN..." rel="nofollow">http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.novelguide.com/heartofdarknes..." rel="nofollow">http://www.novelguide.com/heartofdarknes...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk..." rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T..." rel="nofollow">http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr..." rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/H..." rel="nofollow">http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/H...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://summarycentral.tripod.com/heartof..." rel="nofollow">http://summarycentral.tripod.com/heartof...</a>

Crusades were also called against heretics (the Albigensian Crusade, 1209–29) and various rivals of the popes, and the Fourth Crusade (1202–04) was diverted against the Byzantine Empire. Crusading declined rapidly during the 16th century with the advent of the Protestant Reformation and the decline of papal authority. The Crusades constitute a controversial chapter in the history of Christianity, and their excesses have been the subject of centuries of historiography. Historians have also concentrated on the role the Crusades played in the expansion of medieval Europe and its institutions, and the notion of “crusading” has been transformed from a religio-military campaign into a modern metaphor for zealous and demanding struggles to advance the good (“crusades for”) and to oppose perceived evil (“crusades against”).|`|62xF9GScaa	The influence that the Papacy held over Europeans diminished with the rise of the individual Nation states.

Already, however, the term crusade was also being used for other expeditions, sanctioned by the pope, against heathens and heretics. Albert the Bear and Henry the Lion led (1147) a crusade against the Wends in NE Germany; Hermann von Salza in 1226 received crusading privileges for the Teutonic Knights against the Prussians; the pope proclaimed (1228) a crusade against Emperor Frederick II; and several crusades were fought against the Albigenses and the Hussites (see Hussite Wars).<br>  <br>  War against the Turks remained the chief problem of Eastern Europe for centuries after 1291. Campaigns akin to crusades were those of John Hunyadi, John of Austria (d. 1578), and John III of Poland. In their consequences, the crusades in Europe were as important as those in the Holy Land. However, although the Crusades in the Holy Land failed in their chief purpose, they exercised an incalculable influence on Western civilization by bringing the West into closer contact with new modes of living and thinking, by stimulating commerce, by giving fresh impetus to literature and invention, and by increasing geographical knowledge. The crusading period advanced the development of national monarchies in Europe, because secular leaders deprived the pope of the power of decision in what was to have been the highest Christian enterprise.<br>  <br>  In the Levant the Crusades left a lasting imprint, not least on the Byzantine Empire, which was disastrously weakened. Physical reminders of the Crusades remain in the monumental castles built by the Crusaders, such as that of Al Karak. The chief material beneficiaries of the Crusades were Venice and the other great Mediterranean ports.<br>  <br>  Bibliography<br>  Outstanding among eyewitness acounts are those of William of Tyre, Richard of Devizes, Geoffroi de Villehardouin, Jean de Joinville, Anna Comnena, Fulcher of Chartres, and Nicetas Acominatus.<br>  <br>  The chief collection of sources is Recueil des historiens des croisades (ed. by the Académie des Inscriptions et Belle-Lettres, 16 vol., 1841-1906).

Their objectives were to check the spread of Islam, to retake control of the Holy Land, to conquer pagan areas, and to recapture formerly Christian territories. The Crusades were seen by many of their participants as a means of redemption and expiation for sins. Between 1095, when the First Crusade was launched by Pope Urban II at the Council of Clermont, and 1291, when the Latin Christians were finally expelled from their kingdom in Syria, there were numerous expeditions to the Holy Land, to Spain, and even to the Baltic; the Crusades continued for several centuries after 1291, usually as military campaigns intended to halt or slow the advance of Muslim power or to conquer pagan areas. The Crusaders initially enjoyed success, founding a Christian state in Palestine and Syria, but the continued growth of Islamic states ultimately reversed those gains. By the 14th century the Ottoman Turks had established themselves in the Balkans and would penetrate deeper into Europe despite repeated efforts to repulse them. Crusades were also called against heretics (the Albigensian Crusade, 1209–29) and various rivals of the popes, and the Fourth Crusade (1202–04) was diverted against the Byzantine Empire. Crusading declined rapidly during the 16th century with the advent of the Protestant Reformation and the decline of papal authority. The Crusades constitute a controversial chapter in the history of Christianity, and their excesses have been the subject of centuries of historiography. Historians have also concentrated on the role the Crusades played in the expansion of medieval Europe and its institutions, and the notion of “crusading” has been transformed from a religio-military campaign into a modern metaphor for zealous and demanding struggles to advance the good (“crusades for”) and to oppose perceived evil (“crusades against”).<a href="http://www.reference.com/browse/Crusades?jss=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.reference.com/browse/Crusades...</a>|`|KADDz1EPaa	The Crusades have ended after the last enterprise of Richard the Lion, who after conquering San Giovanni d'Acri, resigned to conquer Jerusalem.<br>  by the fustigador

ec43934173ad5427d59f2e37d17eaff9aa	I believe that if your positive - positive things will happen to you and for you. I've watched the secret DVD and found it to be inspirational and certainly see how law of Attraction can work for you and in your favor. To me the DVD was a bit vague in some areas, if you pretend that your driving your red sports car and thinking about it every day I don't think it will magically appear. But i do believe that if your act and think that you have one and day dream about what you want then you will motivate yourself to getting what you want, you will begin to create solutions to finding what you want, when opportunities present themselves you will be able to recognize these opportunities and more importantly not hesitate to act. The secret is about conditioning yourselves to make the changes necessary to obtain what your after. To Quote " What ever the mind can conceive and believe can achieve." Check out "How to get from Where You Are to Where You What to Be" by Jack Canfield. He was featured on the Sercet Video and is the Author of the Chicken Soup For the Soul Books.

eYF4QSBqaa	BEST<br>  1.  Harry Potter by J.K. Rowling - nothing to say - they're just amazing!!!!!!!!!<br>  2.  A Great and Terrible Beauty trilogy by Libba Bray - Historical fiction combined with fantasy; very well told story.<br>  3.  The Luxe series - possibly my favorite Historical Fiction - kinda like a soap opera :)<br>  4.  Twilight - I know, pathetic but they're addicting<br>  5.  Angels and Demons by Dan Brown - bad writing but great plot line, better than The Da Vinci Code<br>  6.  Change of Heart by Jodi Picoult - incredible writing and very relatable, sad plot<br>  7.  Wicked by Gregory Maguire - A bit dull in parts, but good theme idea and some of the best fantasy writing (besides Harry Potter) I've ever read<br>  8.  Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen - possibly THE most romantic book I've ever read and incredible literature.<br>  9.  Ugglies series by Scott Westerfeld - the only books by him I like, but very good and fun science fiction<br>  10.  Tiger, Tiger by Lynne Reid Banks<br>  <br>  WORST<br>  1.  Darby by Jonathon Scott Fuqua - takes place around the Civil War, pathetic plot, bad writing I couldn't even finish it<br>  2.  Birdwing by Rafe Martin - OK, not THAT bad but it got so dull it wasn't worth the read<br>  3.  Stop Pretending by Sonya Sones - everyone loves this verse book but I thought it was pointless and stupid (even though it was sad)<br>  4.  The Not So Star Spangled Life of Sunita Sen by Mitali Perkins - I thought I would like this book because it's about this girl from India, but it was written so poorly I couldn't keep going.<br>  5.  Leven Thumps - ARGH!!!  Where to begin...<br>  6.  Glass by Ellen Hopkins - I liked the first book, Crank, but this one was so depressing and repetitive I gave up.<br>  7.  The Horse and His Boy by C.S. Lewis - I love the first two books in the Narnia series, but THAHB I just could not get into.<br>  8.  Tell-Tale Heart by Edgar Allen Poe (if that counts) - It was incredible writing, but quite honestly freaked me out!!!<br>  9.  A Series of Unfortunate Events by Lemony Snicket - I read them all and they were depressing, not well written (sorry if I keep dwelling on that) and repetitive.<br>  <br>  Um, I can't really think of any more that I hate.

I find these stories intreguing.<br>  3)Anna Karenina by Leo Tolstoy-I love the passion, and for the same reasons as The Awakening<br>  4) The Hours by Michael Cunningham- The movie is great too. An incredible look into the lives of three women, and it was written by a man!<br>  5)The Harry Potter Series by J.K. Rowling- I've been reading them since I was 7 and have read each one over 20 times. They are my sick-day books.<br>  6) East of Eden by John Steinbeck- I really like Myth and Biblical allusion and I love the character of Cathy<br>  7)Paradise Lost by John Milton- Again, because of the Biblical stuff and because it causes the reader to sympathyze with Satan. Also because it's where much of western culture's ideas of religion and Biblical connotations come from.<br>  8) The Perks of Being a Wall Flower by Stephen Chbosky- I read it when I was 12 and it touched me so much that now I read it every time I get depressed to make myself feel better.<br>  9) One Hundred Years of Solitude- The best magical realism novel ever.<br>  10) Equus by Peter Shaffer- It's a play, but I like books about obsession and worship and what it can drive people to do.<br>  11) The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne- I know that's 11, not 10 but I couldn't leave it out. Again, for the adultury thing.<br>  <br>  Least Faves:<br>  1) Twilight Series by Stephenie Meyer- I don't like her writing. Bella has no personality. Edward is verbally abusive.<br>  2) Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austin- I don't like that she goes with Darcy at the end. I don't think Elizabeth is strong enough and I really don'e like any of Austin's writing.<br>  3) Wide Sargasso Sea by jean Rhys- Not a huge fan of Jane Eyre to begin with and I find this spin off from Bertha's pov boring.<br>  4)Bury My Heart on Wounded Knee by Dee Brown- Again, boring. <br>  5) Black Elk Speaks by John G. Neihardt - Boring. Although I've heard it's alot better if you're high.<br>  6) The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain- Not a fan of Twain.<br>  7) Call of the Wild by Jack London- I guess I'm really not into "boy books."<br>  <br>  That's all I have. I enjoy most books so I can't think of any more that I really didn't like.|`|2LXwQc7Yaa	Favorite books: All the books in the dresden files.

It's all in there.<br>  3. The Phantom of the Opera by Gaston Leroux--Beautiful, heartbreaking gothic romance. Not much like the famous musical. Much more horror, less romance.<br>  4. The Giver by Lois Lowry--A very powerful message, really made me think.<br>  5. Farenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury--Got me out of my comfort zone, really got me pondering society<br>  6. The Astonishing Life of Octavian Nothing by M.T. Anderson--Beautifully written, world-shattering<br>  7. Oliver Twist by Charles Dickens--Charming at times, terrifying at others, wonderful always<br>  8. The Pearl by John Steinbeck--A metaphor-lover's paradise, so much to think about, so much to ponder<br>  9. Collection of Poems by Edgar Allan Poe (if that counts as a book)--hauntingly amazing, mesmerizing, astonishing.<br>  10. You Don't Know Me by David Klass--Sad plot, hilarious book. Had me laughing so hard I couldn't NOT put it in here.<br>  <br>  Least Favorite Books:<br>  1. Twilight--Yes, I'm sorry. I just didn't like it, ok? Idk if you do, but if you do, that's fine by me. I just don't. For the reasons often stated by haters.<br>  2. New Moon<br>  3. Eclipse<br>  4. Breaking Dawn<br>  5. Pride and Prejudice--I know! That was unexpected. Another user on here put it best when she said, "It's like a 19th century version of Gossip Girl." Plus, I hate Austen's writing style.<br>  6. Peeps by Scott Westerfield--I don't know why. I liked his other books. This one just kind of turned me off from the beginning.<br>  7. The Cradle Will Fall by Mary Higgins Clark--A lot of people love this book, but I don't. XD I found it extremely boring and predictable because you knew who the murderer was from the beginning. And I hated the main character. By the end I was sincerely hoping she would die. :P<br>  8. Searching for Candlestick Park by Peg Kehret--Now, this book is wonderful when you're about eight years old. But when you have to read it for school in seventh grade? Not so much.<br>  <br>  I can't think of any more books right now that I really don't like.

SQkdULOlaa	"Forgive". The character Beloved is a manifestation of Sethe's psyche, due to her sufferance over the years as a black and a slave. As she and the other characters undergo much torment over the years, Beloved comes to her and it is only with Beloved that Sethe's past comes back to haunt her. Beloved's presence forces her to confront her past and to come to terms with it. At the end of the novel when Beloved disappears, Paul D helps Sethe to realise that her best thing is herself, and in that Sethe finally forgives herself. <br>  <br>  This novel confronts the idea of morality. Was Sethe morally wrong in killing her children? Sethe had no choice but to put her favourite things in the place where no one can reach and harm them, which was the nether world. Was it wrong for a mother to protect her children in this way? One questions the definition of morality when we read this novel. And later when the memories return to haunt Sethe, she has to ultimately come to terms with it and forgive herself. Only when she forgives herself does the novel come to a complete resolution.|`|AF8mfXQZaa	Beloved. Because it's in the title, and should be in the book as well.

The Klu Klux Klan was a Part of the Failure, however, It was only a Part.  Reconstruction was, in Theory, a Very Good Idea, however, It was Executed Very Poorly @ Times.  The Freed Slaves' Rights Weren't Legally Established & Protected (This Includes Voting Rights).  Though the Freed Slaves (@ Least the Men) were Granted Citizenship & the Right to Vote Under the 14th & 15th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, Federal, State & Local (esp. in the South) Didn't Follow Suit.  In Fact, as the Former Slaveholders & Other Racist WhitesTook Back Their State & Local Governments, They Pased Laws Prohibiting the Freed Slaves from Exercising Their Newly Won Freedom.  The Former Slaveholders also Hired the Freed Slaves as Sharecroppers, Which Proved to @ Least as Bad as Slavery; as Slaves, They were (Theoretically) Supposed to be Treated @ Least Somewhat Fairly.  As Sharecroppers, They were, in Essence, Slaves Again.  The Federal Government Failed in Many Ways, too.  Presidents Andrew Johnson, Ulysses S. Grant & Rutherford B. Hayes, Along w/ Congress (BOTH House & Senate) & the U.S. Supreme Court, Failed to Protect the Freed Slaves or Reign in the Former Slaveholders' & Other Racist Whites' Terrorism (Including, iif Not esp., the KKK).  Once Reconstruction was Declared Completed/Accomplished, the Former Slaves were, Essentially, Forgotten & the "Jim Crow" Laws (the Aforementioned Prohibitions Against the Blacks) Became the Rule of the Day.
1hvrQYWiaa	The New Model Army DID NOT live off the land; it was (at least in theory, and certainly after 1650) regularly paid, and had a properly organized supply train.The Articles of War that governed discipline in the New Model Army were strictly enforced and generally adhered to.<br>   While there were no doubt individual cases of  his soldiers being upset with Cromwell, he was an extremely popular commander - indeed his political power was based almost entirely on army support. The only thing I can think of was service in the Irish campaign of 1649. The rank and file was extremely unwilling to serve in the campaign, and those regiments that did go were selected by lot at Cromwell's suggestion.<br>   <br>  Note about Drogheda: 17th century warfare in western Europe was governed by a clearly defined and widely accepted set of rules. One of these was that, when attacking a town or other fortified position, once the attackers had made a practicable breach in the defences, the defenders were asked to surrender on reasonable terms (usually allowing them to march away to safety). If they refused, thus forcing the attackers to take the position by storm, the defenders were not entitled to quarter and the town was subject to sack if the assault proved successful. This is what happened at Drogheda and Wexford during Cromwell's Irish campaign|`|fcf427fccc8fa8230c38f4b869207e8aaa	he wasn't keen on letting them rape and plunder everything in sight- something which was a "traditional right" of many armies. This meant keeping an army was cheaper (they fed off the land) but there was only ruin and destruction left after the army passed.<br>  <br>  Of course this does not apply in the case of towns taken by storm- eg the famous case of Drogheda where no prisoners were taken

KHSOVxViaa	The initial discovery confirmed the existence of the town which was previously thought to be a myth.<br>  <br>  Subsequent archaeological and historical investigation (including Egyptian and Hittite) has revealed much more.  As well as the inner city walls, remains extensive outer walls have been found, suggesting a large city.<br>  <br>  There are indications that Troy was the capital of a kingdom which grew wealthy and powerful because of its control of the trade to the Black Sea.  This made it a magnet for rivals and raiders, such as the Hittites and ancient Greeks.|`|gW0nD5cEaa	I think Troy had been considered a myth, a legend and most historians did not think it had been real.

While some parts of the story are still considered clearly fiction (the role of the gods, 10 year siege, and perhaps the horse itself) it opens up the possibility that people like Paris, Agamemnon, Hector, Achilles, Ajax and Odysseus may have actually been real people and their names had been passed down in the stories for centuries.<br>  <br>  With this people went back and studied the ancient greek literature in a new light, rather than looking at it as just a load of interesting but made up stories. maybe they were all based on real events and real people, the stories would over time have changed to include the gods etc but fundamentally the story may have been true, maybe a King called Odysseus did take 10 years to get home and maybe a Hector and an Achilles did fight at the gates of Troy over 3000 years ago.

Believe me, the supply far exceeds demand. You need to come up with a compelling reason for them to take you on. More than just you "really want it."|`|Ahud6tPZaa	An agent will not hire you if you don't have professional experience and/or training - although training is usually the overriding factor.<br>  <br>  And remember, you don't hire an agent. An agent hires you, based upon whether they can market you successfully enough to earn commission from your jobs. Of course, that's not all that's required. Many agents don't touch people who don't have professional training.<br>  <br>  If you want to be an extra, all you need is to be able to follow instructions and keep quiet between takes. But if you seriously want to act, don't do extra work. Despite what some people may say, extra work is not acting. Extra work is like being a sheep in a field, you do what you're told to do - there's no talent involved, not even in those improvised conversations in a scene - because no-one hears the conversation anyway. Believe me, some extras I've worked with have been close to braindead...

hd2uNljsaa	It "chronicles" the reign of King David in Israel. It begins by tracing David's royal lineage back through Abraham to Adam, and then it tells David's story in the context of God's covenant with the Jewish nation. It gives a detailed description of the building of the Temple in Jerusalem, the bringing of the Ark, and the roles God assigned to each of the 12 Tribes of Israel. There's a lot of military history, including the battle with the Philistines. <br>  <br>  It shows God's love for and faithfulness to His people. It ends with King David's death, and 2nd Chronicles picks up with the reign of King Solomon.
iNXqiDIYaa	not sure exactly what you want here<br>  <br>  the first part of Chronicles I is effectively just a genealogical list<br>  <br>  the second part describes the reign of King David but written in the style to present moral and religious truths rather than being merely historical - the tone is a bit like modern day evangelists
dE0vtX2eaa	guy called evan (cameo in bruce almighty) is a cold hearted person in goverment. He moves with his wife n three boys to a richer suburb as he has gotten a job promotion (to senate?). There, weird things start happening. and eventually, he meets god who tells him to build an ark. Similar to the story of noahs ark. After many thoughts against it, he finnaly decides to fulfill gods wishes. His family even leave him, but decide to return. Everyone thinks that he is crazy. There isnt even any rain. However, due to bad construction plans (ignored on purpose by a crooked senator), a dam cracks open and the water floods the city. The group of people watching evan and his Ark, quickly jump on board. The ark has also been filled with animals, they get swept away and end up by the capitol building, where Evan accuses the governor of endangering peoples lives. He is arrested. We assume that there were no casualties during the flood, even though they were really probable. The movie ends with God meeting Evan when he is on a family hiking trip that he keeps putting off. With a dog that they met earlier in the film. God reveals that<br>  Ark stands for<br>  Act of<br>  Random<br>  Kindness<br>  and thats how the movie ends

uec7RIhbaa	you're thinking of lady jane grey the ill-fated nine day queen.  catherine parr was henry the VIII's 6th and final wife and she survived him, therefore becoming dowager queen when he died. henry died in 1547 and catherine parr was in her thirties.<br>  <br>  lady jane grey was a young, fiercely protestant girl, a grand neice to henry VIII.  on his deathbed the fanatic protestant edward, terrified of leaving the kingdom of england to his staunchly roman catholic sister mary, (illegally) changed his father's will to make Jane grey the heir to his realm upon his death.  this was encouraged and possibly devised (although not, contrary to popular opinion, demanded or forced) by the earl of northumberland, john dudley, who was also lord protector at the time and had married jane to his son in the hopes of such an outcome.  he planned to rule through jane as regent until she came of age and (being a woman) he thought he would ever be able to influence and control her, effectively creating him king and the "power behind the throne".  however the plot fell apart and just nine days after accepting the crown to "save" england from a return to the catholic faith, Jane was imprisoned in the tower of london (she never actually left the tower after her "coronation") and later beheaded at the reluctant command of queen mary.  This occurred in the year 1553. <br>  <br>   remember in such times when girls were married as young as 12 and children grew up fast (or not at all) it was easy indeed to have a 16 year old girl crowned queen - especially following the reign of a boy who had become king at just nine and died only 6 years later having never actually come of age.|`|UhAHaOWFaa	She married king Henry 8th.|`|AA10128644	Catherine Parr was the only one married to Henry VIII who lived. She was his last wife.   Anne Bolyn and Catherine Howard were beheaded.<br>  <br>  You may be getting confused with Lady Jane Grey who was the Queen of England for 9 days.  She was a distant cousin of Henry VIII's son Edward,  who became King at his father's death.  Edward didn't live very long and he named Lady Jane grey to become Queen after him.  Bloody Mary had her beheaded so she could become Queen.|`|M5HyStReaa	As others have said, Catherine Parr was the last wife to Henry VIII. She married Edward VI's uncle Thomas Seymour after Henry's death and died in childbirth<br>  <br>  Lady Jane Grey reigned for 9 nine days. She was the eldest granddaughter of Mary-Rose Tudor (Henry VIII's youngest sister)<br>  <br>  Edward VI was under 16 during his rule so there was a protector assigned to actually rule - first his Uncle Edward Seymour and after his execution for treason John Dudley, Duke of Northumberland became Lord Protector.<br>  <br>  When it became obvious that Edward VI was dying, John Dudley married one of his sons to Jane Grey and when Edward died, seized the throne in her name. His argument was that Edward VI's sister Mary was Catholic and illegitimate and therefore couldn't succeed, and other sister Elizabeth was also illegitimate. The descendents from Henry VIII's elder sister were Scottish and therefore not in the country at the time.<br>  <br>  The rebellion against the legal heir, Catholic Mary, failed as the people regarded her as the rightful heir leading to John Dudley's execution and Jane Grey's imprisonment within 9 days in 1553.|`|lErNxNWVaa	They say that Catherine Parr was a very smart woman.  She could speak several languages, she was a fabulous administrator and kept the house in good order, thus the palace, thus the kingdom.  She was fortunate that she married Henry at a time when his family was established, he was older, infirm, his verility and libido was down and Henry was happy to be able to rely on someone as an able companion rather than look on his wife as someone who must produce an heir.   I think if I was to want to meet any of Henry's wives, I would like to meet her.  She was a good queen.|`|9dcvN2KFaa	She married the King|`|w76QCpggaa	Catherine Parr was the 6th wife of Henry VIII.

0LgpcOBDaa	It's amazing how people lack the curious bug and can not think outside the box on things.<br>  <br>  Enlarging lenses DO make good camera lenses and them saying they won't work have their heads so far up their tushes they won't see daylight for a long time.<br>  <br>  If you had a Speed Graphic 4x5 camera you would NOT need a shutter because there is a 4x5 focal plane shutter built in..! And, if they knew 4x5 equipment they would know that for many, you buy the lens and shutter assembly, separate.<br>  <br>  Enlarging lenses are noted for their - FLAT FIELDS.. I have adapters for my Nikon Bellows that allow me to put enlarger lenses on it (they have what is called a Leica Thread) and are excellent for extreme macro work.<br>  <br>  As to which lens or size, well size will be easy, you will want a lens that equals the diagonal measurements of a 4x5 film, or about 150mm and up..<br>  <br>  As in regular camera lenses, the quality of the lens = the quality of the pictures. However, if you recognize some brand names and go to used equipment stores and Pawn Shops you may get a gonga... only because darkrooms and equipment for them are slip sliding away and some can be had for a song.<br>  <br>  Some good names to look for are - In no order of greatness..<br>  <br>  Nikon<br>  Fuji<br>  Rodenstock<br>  Schneider<br>  Leica<br>  Minolta<br>  Kodak<br>  Etc.. There are many, but there are many not so good.<br>  <br>  Try this for fun, it's what I do a lot. Find a box of single weight F surface enlarging paper. Under a safe light, cut the paper into 4x5 pieces and load your film holders. The paper has a ASA - ISO of around 2 to 4. Very slow. Take pictures and develop as you normally would in Dektol, then stop bath, then fix. Wash well.<br>  <br>  While the paper negative is still damp, lay flat on a flat bed scanner, image side down, gently rubbing any air bubbles out, and scan as a BW image. Convert the negative image to a positive one, do any hocus pokus you want to correct a few things, then print on your printer.<br>  <br>  The paper, being Orthochromatic (does not see red) will give your images a - old world look - not seen today because all BW films now are Panchromatic (sees all colors) and could be a curious thing to people looking at them. Plus, the price of 4x5 film is outrageous and the paper negatives are really dirt cheap.<br>  <br>  They DO make BW paper that is for printing color negs and this paper does see all colors like Tri-x film, but in BW. You would have to handle this paper in the dark and develop it in the dark because a red light would fog it. When scanned, you again have a image to play with and no darkroom or enlarger needed.<br>  <br>  Enjoy. Experiment. Have fun..<br>  <br>  Bob - Tucson|`|7Srd7Pliaa	Most enlarger lenses are inexpensive, so you just need to worry about the image circle.  Typically, 150mm lenses provide just enough image circle to cover 4x5; although, you may not be able to use any movements.  You can get a longer focal length, which will give you a bigger image circle.<br>  <br>  The biggest difference between an enlarging lens and the normal taking lens is how the optics are optimized.  The taking lens is optimized to project a 3 dimensional world on to a 2 dimensional sheet of film.  The enlarging lens is optimized to project a 2 dimensional sheet of film on to a 2 dimensional sheet of paper.  You may see a bit of pincushion distortion with 3 dimensional objects.<br>  <br>  You will have to get someone like S.K. Grimes to mount the enlarging lens on to a standard shutter.  The issue has to do with machining an adapter.  The enlarging lenses are designed to screw into lens boards on an enlarger, which are different than your standard Copal shutter sizes.|`|yWloDrF8aa	It is not recommended to use enlarging lenses as a substitute for camera lenses as the optical properties of each type are totally different due to each of them being designed for their own specific purpose. The lack of a shutter is an obvious disadvantage unless you intend using long exposures with the aid of a lens cap.<br>  While enlarging lenses of 150mm and above may function with a 5x4 camera enlarging lenses less than that wont cover the whole of the 5x4 format as their covering power is designed for formats smaller than 5x4.<br>  If you are serious about using a 5x4 camera properly please use the appropriate lenses intended for the camera and forget about attempting dubious shortcuts.|`|AA11260610	none of them...<br>  enlarger lenses don't come with a shutter... therefore you cant control your exposure times on the view camera
hJP9y6kjaa	Well, there's a slight different between a good guitar player (ie, a good musician) and a good performer (someone who can work the crowd).    A good musician plays well with others - they're flexible, have decent command of their instrument (whatever it may be), are willing to try new things and challenge themselves, are always striving to further their craft, and have at least some passion for music.    A good performer is charismatic, attention-grabbing to some degree, and distinctive - someone you can identify or identify with, someone who you think could be your friend, or someone who you would just love to hang out with. Someone who is just "one of the guys" or someone who is totally larger than life.    I'm a decent musician (within my realm of expertise, I think, although I'm no professional), but I'm only a so-so performer. I have a hard time consistently making eye contact and interacting with the crowd. I tend to get lost in the music, and really get into my performance - I love to play with my eyes closed, since it intensifies the feeling of the music coursing through me... and for the guitar players in the audience, it gives them something to be like "daaaang"... *evil grin*    I guess you could say that I tend to play for other musicians more than just "people". It's something that I need to work on, but I've also never been the front man - I've always been a supporting role (ie rhythm guitar or bassist).    I dunno... maybe I am making some kind of an impact when I play... but I don't get any feedback from people, so either I'm not connecting consistently or I'm completely failing as a performer. =)      I have mixed feelings about people like me... sometimes I do think they're a little stuck up, I guess, when I see them playing. If a player leans back and closes their eyes and rips some fat isht, then yeah, I'm probably more like "dang, I like being in that place" more than "what a douche", but it can go both ways. I personally like it when everyone has fun. I'm not fun - I'm a little too crazy, I use music as my catharsis a lot of the time (when I'm doing a rock gig, at least! arrgh - get the demons out! get 'em out! *grin*).

I listen to lots of metal, so for me, a "good guitarist" is someone who has lots of technical skill with the instrument. A "good guitarist" is not always the same as a "good musician". A "good musician" is someone who can make music that is diverse, innovative, and can be enjoyed. A person may be a good guitarist but not a good musician and vice versa. I know of lots of players that might be very good at writing great music, but not so great at playing their instrument, I would usually refer to them as good musicians rather than good guitarists. There are also plenty of people that can shred up the fretboard, but cant write good music for their lives. A person can be any combination of these.    A good example of both would be Emppu Vuorinen of the band Nightwish. He has the ability to play extremely technical guitar pieces (although he often doesn't), but he usually writes slower, more melodic pieces that can be enjoyed by everyone. He is a good guitarist, and a good musician.     A good performer is a totally different story... a good performer doesn't need to be a guitarist at all. Saul pretty much covered the "good performer" bit.|`|AM33tqYAaa	no ego,   not just standing there, but running like a maniac on the stage, you gotta have passion in your music, you have good chemistry with the other band members, you fire up the crowd, you inspire people.|`|whg557P5aa	I would make occasional contact with the audience, so keep their attention.
kZVjyOufaa	My Granny was born 1906, in Hamburg, germany. Her parents did not have much money, but her mum would sew very nice clothes for her children. My Granny had to take good care of her things, though, and not go into the playground with her good dresses .. she was smacked once for soiling her patent-leather shoes.. They had a cat, and already indoors-toilets in their apartment. My Granny was an exellent gymnast, sports for everyone had been introduced in germany at that time. You didn't go abroad for summer holidays, though. Maybe you'd visit an aunt. She had to wear an apron over her dress and her brother wore a sailor suit with shorts, as you'd only start wearing long pants/dresses after you turned fourteen or fifteen. They had crayons for drawing and drew and cut out hundreds of clothes foe cut-out-paper dolls. Not much pocket money, if any.. Children played on the streets, when the war was on, all children of her street played a massive war-game together. The mums would make costumes, for little soldiers of all ranks. My Granny was a very small red-cross nurse. Children in germany did not usually work. they would have household chores, though. If you grew up on a farm, times might be a bit harder, there wer so called Kartoffel-Ferien, Poatoe-Holidays, time off school, so the kids could help with the harvest. Girls wore dresses, unless for sports, boys wore suits with shorts. Lace-up-boots. Long wollen stockings and a girdle thing in winter, even for boys, in germany, I believe the english knees froze.. Coal ovens. hildren would play, though, and there ewere outings with the parents on weekends or holidays, depending on your parents of course, as it does today. I reckon they sang much more, and played round games and games on the streets, which are now forgotten. In school you stood up, when the teacher entered class, the little ones would still learn the abc on slates, later exercisebooks and pencil, then dip-pen and ink. If you went on to highschool, and learned greek and latin, you'd get a fountain pen. Not too many co-ed schools in towns, in the country, boys and girls might sit apart in the same room of the little village schools. Rich country people might have a tutor for their kids and home-schooling. My Granny's parents divorced, which was much rarer, than today, but obviously it did happen. <br>  She went to see her dad at weekends, but not on such a regular basis. Food was expensive, and wouldn't be wasted. People cooked at home and you basically ate, what was on the table, they didn't have meat eveyday. Stews, potatoes.. Soups, with vegetables and stuff. Having a bicycle was something special, and not everybody could afford it. What was normal, though, was to play a musical instrument, so if you had several children, one would play the piano, one the violin, and then they could play together. Piano was by far the most common for a long time, but around then I believe the guitar started to become great, and it became fashion for youngsters to don hiking boots,  leave the cities behind and go hiking, boys and girls together even, and sing along, in different interweaving melodies even, I dont know the english name for it, to one of them strumming the guitar. Children didn't have too many toys, unless the parents had money, so you might only have one or two dolls, and you and your mum would makle the clothes for them. Some people were so poor, their daughter didn't even have one.. For boys it would have been tin soldiers, war toys, wooden railways. Sure there were board games, cards, puzzles, building blocks . Teddy bears were invented around the time, I think. Smacking and beating your kids for  was quite the norm, pulling ears, telling them to be ashamed of themselves and everything, but not every parent was a sadist and there were people who even then did not hit their kids. Siblings would fight, also bodily, they were not totally restrained and well behaved all the times. Children would be noisy. But usually your parents could make you stop. There were already some Zoos in the big cities, the odd circus, I reckon. Those occasions were damn special. Once my Gran stood on the balcony of her aunt, with all her family, waving as the procession with the german emperor passed on the street. Actually, there were quite a few people around, who did not go to church, even though they still built churches and those weren't as empty as today in some parts. I think, this is probably enough for this time.. Would like to know more myself. Perhaps this helps a little, cheerio!|`|lmT3zXa9aa	Before the Great Depression there were little or no child labor laws in the United States.  Children were frequently sent out to work by the time they reached 10 years old, and they worked in factories, mines, logging, farming, etc.  If there was employment then odds were you would find children doing tasks that by today's standards would be considered extremely dangerous.  Legislation to regulate child labor had been attempted several times during the very early 1900s, but it wasn't until the passage of the Fair Labor Standards Act in 1938 that child labor came under regulation, and the motivation to get children out of the workforce was to provide employment for adults who couldn't find work due to the poor economy.  <br>  Obviously, if you are going to work then you aren't going to school so many children in these early days only had a very limited exposure to schooling. <br>  Since the country was largely agrarian at this time, many children were growing up in rural farm communities.|`|c136c061470995f88a8560ed010a00bbaa	No radio, no TV, very few cars, loads of horse, the place stank, it's why the car got so popular so quickly.

In America, all kids could have a public education, but even in some middle class families, if the family was large, an older girl might be taken out of school as young as 14 to help her mother care for the younger children and do housework. In the poorest families, child labor laws either were non-existent or were ignored if a family could get a little more money by having a kid work in a factory or something (Much like in parts of the 3rd world today)<br>  <br>  For wealthy kids it would have been different. Many were tutored at home, and then sent off to boarding schools. Rich parents often thought the kids did not belong at home or something. They had a lot of material things, but maybe not a lot of affection and nurturing and that is why a lot of wealthy people in those days seemed cold and detached. <br>  <br>  There were probably some in the middle who were not a lot different than later generations, went to school, played baseball, acted like kids; but probably were spanked more often and things like that. "Spare the rod, spoil the child' was often taken very literally.|`|Y4RS35M7aa	They were beaten frequently and severely.  <br>  <br>  The saying was "Spare the rod and spoil the child."

The United States Senate did not ratify the Treaty of Versailles imposed by its Allies on the defeated Central Powers; instead, the United States chose to pursue unilateralism, if not isolationism.[65] The aftershock of Russia's October Revolution resulted in real fears of communism in the United States, leading to a three-year Red Scare and the U.S. lost 675,000 people to the Spanish flu pandemic in 1918.[66]<br>  <br>   <br>  Prohibition agents destroying barrels of alcohol in Chicago, 1921In 1920, the manufacture, sale, import and export of alcohol was prohibited by the Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Prohibition encouraged illegal breweries and dealers to make substantial amounts of money selling drugs illegally. The Prohibition ended in 1933, a failure. Additionally, the KKK re-formed during that decade and gathered nearly 4.5 million members by 1924, and the U.S. government passed the Immigration Act of 1924 restricting foreign immigration.[67] The 1920s were also known as the Roaring Twenties, due to the great economic prosperity during this period.

The boom was fueled by a rise in debt and an inflated stock market. The Hawley-Smoot Tariff, the Wall Street Crash of 1929, the Dust Bowl, and the ensuing Great Depression led to government efforts to restart the economy and help its victims with Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal. The recovery was rapid in all areas except unemployment, which remained fairly high until 1940.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_United_States" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_...</a>

Psychologists, philosophers, and medical doctors are a few groups among many who have taken an interest in studying the systematic development of human speech. The 1950s were a revolutionary time for the field, with many different theories emerging to answer the great mystery, yet the true cause still remains an enigma. This paper will discuss two theories of language acquisition, one from Ludwig Wittgenstein, a late 19th Century Austrian philosopher, and the psychological model of the behaviorists as was developed by B.F. Skinner in the 1950s. Thesis<br>  <br>  The primacy of both Wittgenstein’s and Skinner’s theories is of language acquisition as it occurs within the social context. According to both, meaning is found in such a context, and language is then the association of the terms and the objects, with a large part of basic speech development resting on training. Language then, is no different than any other behavior—according to Wittgenstein it is learned through certain games ("language-games") that are like those that children play in other realms of life, while behaviorist theory contends essentially the same thing, with external reinforcement motivating speech production. However, neither model addresses the biological aspects of language acquisition, which serves to disregard a large amount of scientific evidence that finds biology to be of at least equal importance. Hence, the following discussion will compare Wittgenstein’s theory to the behaviorist model in order to illustrate that both fail to address the biological aspects of language acquisition and therefore do not fully explain the phenomenon.<br>  <br>  <br>  Ludwig Wittgenstein’s Meaning as Use<br>  <br>  Ludwig Wittgenstein was born in 1889 to wealthy Austrian family in Vienna. He studied engineering in Austria, then went to Manchester in 1911 to study the design of airplane propellers and engines. He then studied mathematics and logic under Bertrand Russell until serving in the Austrian Army in World War I, where he wrote his major piece, Tractatus, in which he (originally being an analytic philosopher) thought he solved all philosophical problems. He gradually began to question his own assertions in the piece, and then later went back to school and live in great simplicity, refusing the fortune left to him by his father, and refusing to publish anything else. He did, however, dictate notes to his students who published them under the title Philosophical Investigations in 1951 (Roger Whitson’s biographical information, class notes). It is in the second piece that Wittgenstein moves away from the idea of fixed, unchanging meanings to the idea that meaning is constantly in flux due to the fact that it is found within the social context, with all meaning thus being public. It is here that language acquisition is examined, with Wittgenstein’s argument resting on the latter premise of public meaning to conclude that his idea of "language-games" are actually the driving force behind the acquisition of language. In other words, Wittgenstein basis his ideas on the framework that language is acquired by children learning different "language games" in which they learn to associate objects with meaning, and that those meanings are common to all, rather than something internalized. Hence, children learn language as they learn any other game, with the words all gaining meaning from the culture around them. This section will take a step-by-step approach to Wittgenstein’s argument, working through his basic premise and assumptions, as well as the complexities involved, while discussing any flaws occur in the text.<br>  <br>  Wittgenstein’s Philosophical Investigations (found in Andrea Nye’s Philosophy of Language: The Big Questions), begins with a quote from Augustine’s Confessions which commences his argument concerning how human beings acquire language. According to Augustine, by watching his elders speak of an object and then turn to it, he was able to memorize and thus reference each particular object. When he was then able to pronounciate, he had a working knowledge of the language. Wittgenstein states that "in this picture of language we find the roots of the following idea: Every word has a meaning. This meaning is correlated with the word. It is the object for which the word stands" (Nye, 86). However, he doesn’t find that this quasi-empiricist view encompasses the entire realm of language acquisition--he feels that Augustine is merely thinking of nouns and does not take into consideration other types of words, which may not be accounted for in his description. Thus, Wittgenstein gives many examples to illustrate his point that this is not the whole of language. His first example is of a man going to the shopkeeper for apples. The man walks in with a slip marked ‘five red apples,’ asks f|`|B7abZOTJaa	Not a lot.

Personally, if I was planning to jump out in front of galloping race horse I would assume I was in grave danger of being hit by a horse or horses and being trampled and therefore, at the very least, of being seriously injured. As Davison's intention was to draw public attention to her cause, the headlines would be more glaring if she were to be killed. The whole thing was caught on film as well - people were more likely to watch footage of someone being hit and killed by the King's horse than someone just running across the racetrack safely to the other side.

I have seen people get ripped apart in national meetings and in print because they misinterpret the sources.|`|iNXYi2kaaa	it would help because many of the original documents in history where wrote in latin and many greek works require decoding because they where quiet the intelligent people as you would already know :).... so knowing latin/greek would be a good idea|`|FeY6muUVaa	Yes, it is imperative that you learn Latin, Greek; Anglo-Saxon; Norman French, and possibly, Old Norse.<br>  <br>  Without these attributes, on cannot read and decrypt medieval manuscripts.<br>  <br>  I was very lucky, in that I had the benefit of a classical education that included languages such as Latin and Greek, but I had classes for Anglo-Saxon and Norman French.<br>  <br>  Best of luck with your studies.<br>  Dr Antony (historian)|`|L3SVAJd4aa	As someone said, it's the ability to speak another language as much as it is to read it. I doubt your university will expect you to go to Europe and begin speaking to the immediately just because you're getting a PHD, however a basic language such as Latin is extremely helpful. If you've already done at least two years in a foreign language, especially one that you're field of focus revolves around, the hardest part is done. <br>  <br>  I don't do well in language either because I have a hard time pronouncing words, but the ability to read French and Gaelic has done a great deal for my research for papers. Translations available, but not for all original texts, which is going to be very important for your dissertation in Ancient History. Good luck. :)|`|nQVM3ry4aa	In europe, the answer to your question would be a definite Yes. You cannot do scientific research on historical sources when you can't read them im their original language.At my former university, ancient greek and latin are required to even get a degree in ancient history.Do not forget that a number of historical sources have not been translated at all and probably never will be, such as a large part of roman and greek inscriptions.(Take for example major collections of source material like the "Inscriptiones Graecae" and the "Inscriptiones Latinae Selectae", which don't give any translations to the inscriptions published therein).Also, the authors of relevant scientific literature often take it for granted their readers understand those two languages.<br>  <br>  I do not know about the specific requirements in other countries, but I guess they would be pretty much the same.|`|550e4912823fee98e745442e7bdab33faa	It helps. At least you should be able to read the original texts.|`|kJ4g1vujaa	I have a degree in Ancient History and I couldn't progress any further because my Latin wasn't good enough to read the original sources.<br>  <br>  I learnt all my history in translation but got told there was no point in going further without hammering the languages - which meant starting Ancient Greek at the ripe old age of 21 when public schoolboys had been doing it since 13.<br>  <br>  Latin isn't hard to learn but if it really is beyond you possibly archaeology would be a better option for you.<br>  <br>  I graduated 15 years ago though things may have changed.

HORACAnlaa	"Why" questions generally are more fundamental in seeking the truth about the universe. "Why" when asked about reality is trying to find the essence and/or nature of an aspect of reality or all of reality, itself. "When" and "Who" questions are generally secondary questions in both philosophy and science. The order of importance generally changes when dealing with specific events. The investigation of a murder, since it's an event, starts with "When" and the primary question to be answered is "Who", with "Why" coming up last. To sum up, "why" questions generally deal the essence of things while generally "when" and "who" questions deal with events.|`|trMsK86jaa	Because in order to know the why, you need to know the when, who, how and what.|`|123cb0f60a65c8151ec27e589a993e7faa	Dont really know.<br>  <br>   But....karl Popper taught to beware of these general-type questions...<br>   ..especially as so-called philosophy,both taught and general,is nothing but un-critical gossip and "icon-worship(e.g. wikipedia)" and the like.|`|onTIKM8iaa	when or who is a measure of accuracy, relating to the sciences. philosophy is interested in why it happens, thus the why.

ElAANkM9aa	Among those who helped design the Great Seal of the United States the following are known to have been Masons: Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, William Churchill Houston, and William Barton. Whether they drew heavily upon Freemasonry in this work it is impossible to assert but when an informed Mason examines the Great Seal here is what he sees:<br>  <br>  Great Seal Obverse On the obverse is an eagle whose dexter wing has thirty- two feathers, the number of ordinary degrees in Scottish Rite Freemasonry. The sinister wing has thirty-three feathers, the additional feather corresponding to the Thirty-Third Degree of the same Rite conferred for outstanding Masonic service. The tail feathers number nine, the number of degrees in the Chapter, Council, and Commandery of the York Rite of Freemasonry. Scottish Rite Masonry had its origin in France; the York Rite is sometimes called the American Rite; the eagle thus clothed represents the union of French and American Masons in the struggle for Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity. The total number of feathers in the two wings is sixty-five which, by gematria, is the value of the Hebrew phrase YAM YAWCHOD (together in unity). This phrase appears in Psalm 133 as follows: "Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity," and is used in the ritual of the first degree of Freemasonry. The glory above the eagle's head is divided into twenty-four equal parts and reminds the observer of the Mason's gauge which is also divided into twenty-four equal parts and is emblematic of the service he is obligated to perform. The five pointed stars remind him of the Masonic Blazing Star and the five points of fellowship. The arrangement of the stars in the constellation to form overlapping equilateral triangles and the Star of David calls to the Mason's mind King David's dream of building a Temple, to his God, the Companions who rebuilt a desecrated Temple, and the finding of the Word that was lost. The gold, silver, and azure colors represent the sun, moon, and Worshipful Master, the first that rules the day, the second, the night, and the third, the lodge. While silver, connected with the letter Gimel or G and being surrounded on an azure ground by a golden glory, reminds the Mason of the letter G, a most conspicuous furnishing of a proper lodge room. The shield on the eagle's breast affirms by its colors, valor (red), purity (white), and justice (blue), and reminds the Mason of the cardinal virtues. The value of these colors, by gematria, is 103, the value of the phrase EHBEN HA-ADAM (the stone of Adam) and suggests the perfect ashlar, or squared stone, of Freemasonry. One hundred and three is also the value of the noun BONAIM, a Rabbinical word signifying "builders, Masons." Thus the national colors spell out, by gematria, the name of the fraternity. The scroll in the eagle's beak, bearing the words E PLURIBUS UNUM (of many one) reminds him also of the unity which has made brothers of many.<br>  <br>  The Great Seal On the reverse, is the All Seeing Eye within a triangle surrounded by a golden glory. Besides the obvious Masonic significance of this design, it has a cabalistic value of seventy plus three plus two hundred, equaling two hundred and seventy-three which is the value of the phrase EHBEN MOSU HABONIM (the stone which the builders refused) familiar to all Royal Arch Masons. It is also the value of the Hebrew proper noun HIRAM ABIFF, the architect of Solomon's Temple and the principal character of the legend used in the Master Mason degree. The triangle is isosceles, formed by two right triangles having sides of five, twelve, and thirteen units in length, illustrating the 47th Problem of Euclid. The triangle also represents the capstone of the unfinished pyramid and reminds the Mason of the immortality of the soul and that in eternity he will complete the capstone of his earthly labors according to the designs on the trestle-board of the Supreme Architect of the Universe. The unfinished pyramid cannot fail to remind him of the unfinished condition of the Temple when tragedy struck down its Master architect.<br>  <br>  The blaze of glory found on either side of the Great Seal cannot fail to remind the Mason of the Great Light in Masonry which is the rule and guide to faith and practice and without which no Masonic lodge can exist. It reminds him that only more light can dispel the pall of ignorance in which he stumbles until he enters the Celestial Lodge where all light is given.|`|4qT0TfMZaa	Those who go on about these nonsensical ideas are the same sort who wear tinfoil hats to protect themselves from "electronic mind control" and who see black helicopters where normal people see mosquitoes.  You can safely go about your business and not fret over the Great Seal.  There is no such thing as a "New World Order"...|`|Y4RS35M7aa	For those whom have never looked, on the $1 bill, are some symbols.  One is a pyramid with an all-seeing eye on the top where the capstone (which is missing) should be.  Above the pyramid, rather floating in space are the words "Annuit Coeptis" (He [nods] approves at our undertaking) At the bottom of the pyramid are the Latin words "Novus Ordo Seculorum" which may, or may not mean "The New World Order" (or the New Order of the Ages/Centuries/Forever).  <br>  <br>  The question is ,"Why would the founding fathers put those words on the Great Seal of the United States?"<br>  <br>  I think that if you manipulate anything enough, then it will yield what you wish.  Someone once said that if you take an infinite number of monkeys banging on an infinite numbr of keyboards, then eventually, they will type out the complete works of Shakespaeare.  That, too, is manipulation of facts.  <br>  <br>  The designer(s) of the seal wanted it to look fancy, so they put a bunch of Latin on it.  remember "The Wizard of OZ?"  Scarecrow's diploma had a bunch of Latin on it, too.  It looks and sounds impressive.|`|rTmYpDTPaa	I think these theories are highly overrated to say the least. As you point out, there are scores of possibilities as to how a 6-point star can make words using the letters on the seal. But what of it? There is absolutely no historical basis to support the idea that the Star of David, be it inside of a circle or not, is connected to the devil. There is also no use of or symbolic meaning attributed to the Star of David within Freemasonry.<br>  As for the motto, understand that Latin is nearly devoid of conjunctions and prepositions, and too that any one Latin word is a root word for any number of English words. What that means is accurate translation from Latin to English requires a context, (as in being within a larger paragraph) something a motto lacks. To that end, there are at least a dozen translations of the motto that can range from the sinister to the silly, and there is no way to support any ONE being more or less accurate or correct than the others. <br>  Regarding the symbols used, nothing there is purely Masonic in origin or use. Masonry uses symbols that were commonplace during the time it was first organized, most of which predate the fraternity and can be seen used within many cultures, some of which were still unknown at that time. So at the time the Great Seal was designed, the symbols used would have been quite familiar to just about everybody in the US and Europe, regardless of their knowledge, association, or opinion of Freemasonry. <br>  <br>  Sky', I love your answer, clearly a lot of effort went into it and it is really beautiful in how it explains use of symbolism... I actually kinda wish it were true! But, alas, historical fact debunks the foundation on which it is built. <br>  The committee on which Franklin and Jefferson sat was only one of at least 3 that were charged the task of designing the Great Seal. (Jefferson BTW, not a Mason.) The design by Franklin's committee was rejected, the committee that submitted the approved design had no Freemasons on it.<br>  Scottish Rite Masonry was a very young organization at the time, virtually unknown outside of France and considered illegitimate by most other Masons who did know of it. The degree system for which the Scottish Rite is known, (4th-33rd) did not yet exist, and was not created until almost 100 years after the Great Seal was designed.<br>  York Rite Masonry did not yet exist as such, at the time what would eventually become York Rite was still a part of regular Masonry, but was only a part of Masonry in some English and US Lodges. Masonry was quite divided at the time, comprising various rival organizations that did not recognize each other as legitimate. This was not resolved until the 1820's.<br>  Finally, all of that numerology stuff, it's all opinion and theory, like the Latin translation, any number of "researchers" can come up with different formulas and find different meanings and references "hidden" in shapes and numeric combinations. Who is to say who is right. Legitimate Freemasonry by and large sees this kind of practice as superstition, and asserts no value or legitimacy in any kind of numerology be it symbolic, religious, or otherwise. Sorry, I know better and I ain't buyin' it.
d52fc51560cdca8ba7c7f408a2a6d505aa	Charles Dickens was a master story teller. Every book of his is a master piece.

More than ever before, I find his Victorian wisdom relevant, his acute observations striking, and his style delightful, and in no other Dickens book have I felt these to be more evident than in Hard Times. Although I appreciate the heroic proportions of David Copperfield and Oliver Twist (I regret to say that I read Little Dorrit too long ago at too tender an age for it to have made much of an impression on me), I can't quite rid myself of the feeling of detachedness which flaws my experience of those two admirable works.

NiuYkbGMaa	Carnegie's contributions to American society are both good and bad. He was a ruthless business man who played companies off on one another so efficiently that he could determine the price structure of the entire steel industry without regard to what others were doing. He fought against the Unions and blacklisted any union workers or organizers. He did introduce new methods in making steel that were beneficial to industry and the economic health of the nation. He was also progressive in many ways. He organized his companies in the corporate structure that is copied even today. Investors could buy ownership into his companies and the risk was limited by the number of investors. No one would lose everything. He made the corporation's legal liability limited to the assets of the corporation and not to the assets of the stockholders. He also donated libraries to various towns and cities that could not afford them.|`|BJERgbM5aa	In his time, Mr. Carnegie was known as a robber barron!  They and their ilk formed what we now call monopolies.  Each monopoly controlled a specific product, nationally and sometimes globally.  This control on an industry allowed each barron to name his own price or otherwise hold the produce back.  Of course, if we're talking tooth-picks, then the monopoly is worthless.  But products like Iron & Steel, which Carnegie controlled with his monopoly, he literally controlled the growth of a nation and in the process became a multi-millionaire many times over.  To a lesser extent, the robber barron impact is still felt today.  Many anti-monopoly laws are in effect to stem this practice.  Our government, as well as many others, are always on the alert for unfair business practices which can lead to monoplizing an industry.  The days of the robber-barron are certainly gone, but surely not forgotten.  Good question.  Hope I helped.|`|RWEyZZXWaa	Thanks to his basing his milling and manufacturing operations in Pittsburgh for Carnegie Steel; which was sold to J.P.

UKGPj6Emaa	I grew up in that period and could never see that he was much of an influence at all, tho he certainly was a media sensation. A little of it was his talent and a lot of it was the talking in verse and his boastfulness, especially the arrogant and oft-repeated line "I am the greatest!" Of course, the draft dodging became a national issue.    As a boxer, he couldn't hold a candle to earlier fighters like Joe Louis and Rocky Marciano. Clay's "scientific style" of fighting (his "float like a butterfly, sting like a bee" approach) consisted largely of dancing around outside the range of his opponents' fists until they wore themselves out. And most of his opponents were no-talent bums anyway (including Liston; this was in the day when pro-boxing was largely run by Frankie Carbo and the Mob, the fix was in and even minor thugs like Liston could become the World Heavyweight champ).    I wouldn't pick a fight with Ali and do feel sorry for him in more recent years for his physical condition but he was never an influence to me or anyone I can recall from the time. I was opposed to the Vietnam War too early on and missed that party myself but I just lucked out there. I knew many who felt the same way about the war but went over there and fought anyhow and some didn't make it back. To most of us back then Cassius Clay, a.k.a. Muhammad Ali, was just an overrated boxer and a rich draft dodger. I hated the thought of his returning to the sport or reclaiming his title and a lot of others felt the same way at the time.|`|Jzr8UmFKaa	"He was pretty and he couldnt possibly be beat"
FCgF4G7Raa	He is not celebrating war.  He is honoring those that gave the ultimate sacrifice in war.    "Blow out, you bugles, over the rich Dead!"    By commanding the bugles to blow "over the rich Dead", Brooke is commanding that a tribute of honor be given to those that gave their lives in war.    "  Theres none of these so lonely and poor of old,"    He describes those who have died as perhaps having been lonely or poor in life.    "  But, dying, has made us rarer gifts than gold."    In lines 2 and 3, he's saying, "No matter how lonely or poor they might have been in life, they are rich in death."  He says they are rich, not because of what they have, but because of what they have given.  By giving their lives in war, they gave "us" (meaning those they died for) gifts rarer (more precious) than gold.    "These laid the world away; poured out the red  "Sweet wine of youth; gave up the years to be  "  Of work and joy, and that unhoped serene,  "  That men call age; and those who would have been,  "Their sons, they gave, their immortality."    Here, Brooke lists things that the Dead sacrificed:    the world    their blood    the future years they would have had to spend in work and joy    the serenity of old age    the opportunity of having their own children    "  Blow, bugles, blow! They brought us, for our dearth,  "    Holiness, lacked so long, and Love, and Pain.  "  Honour has come back, as a king, to earth,  "      And paid his subjects with a royal wage;  "    And Nobleness walks in our ways again;  "      And we have come into our heritage."    Here, he lists what they gave by their sacrifice:    Holiness    Love and Pain (these symbolize the ups and downs of life, meaning that they preserved, for those they died for, the chance to experience these things)    Honor, and the good things, or royal wage, that come with it, described by the words "nobility" and "heritage"    "  These hearts were woven of human joys and cares  "Washed marvellously with sorrow, swift to mirth.  "  The years had given them kindness. Dawn was theirs,  "And sunset, and the colours of the earth.  "  These had seen movement and heard music; known  "Slumber and waking; loved; gone proudly friended;  "  Felt the quick stir of wonder; sat alone;  "Touched flowers and furs and cheeks. All this is ended."    Here, Brooke talks about the kinds of experiences they had while they lived, showing that in those things they were just like everyone else.  The difference being that, for them, "all this," or the experience of life, "is ended."    "  There are waters blown by changing winds to laughter"    In the final stanza, Brooke uses imagery to describe the general result on their society of the sacrifice they made.  The changing winds are the changing of the season of war to a happier season, or one of "laughter".    "  And lit by the rich skies, all day. And after,"    The "rich skies" reflecting in (or lighting) the water has many meanings, but the general idea is partially that now that the storm (or war) that was in the sky is past, things below (in everyday life) are better (lit).  This line also begins the metaphor of day and night, which also has several meanings, including a continuation of the cycle of life, but which essentially boil down to:  Day = Rejoicing of the living, or happiness for future possibilities assured for the living by the sacrifices of the dead  Night = somber and reverent feelings of the living for the dead    "Frost, with a gesture, stays the waves that dance  "  And wandering loveliness. He leaves a white  "Unbroken glory, a gathered radiance,  "  A width, a shining peace, under the night."    Here, Brooke uses the idea of Frost to symbolize two things: the warriors' death and the beauty of what resulted from it.  That the Frost "stays the waves that dance" means that their sacrifice inspires somber and reverent feelings.  The "white unbroken glory", "gathered radiance", and "shining peace" that the Frost leaves refer to the honor discussed earlier.    I hope this was helpful.|`|U4JEgNPNaa	The Dead  Rupert Brooke    Blow out, you bugles, over the rich Dead!   There's none of these so lonely and poor of old,   But, dying, has made us rarer gifts than gold.   These laid the world away; poured out the red   Sweet wine of youth; gave up the years to be   Of work and joy, and that unhoped serene,   That men call age; and those who would have been,   Their sons, they gave, their immortality.

IV. THE DEAD    These hearts were woven of human joys and cares,   Washed marvellously with sorrow, swift to mirth.   The years had given them kindness. Dawn was theirs,   And sunset, and the colours of the earth.   These had seen movement, and heard music; known   Slumber and waking; loved; gone proudly friended;   Felt the quick stir of wonder; sat alone;   Touched flowers and furs and cheeks. All this is ended.    There are waters blown by changing winds to laughter   And lit by the rich skies, all day. And after,   Frost, with a gesture, stays the waves that dance   And wandering loveliness. He leaves a white   Unbroken glory, a gathered radiance,   A width, a shining peace, under the night    --------------------------------------...

OjQxKGC0aa	Come up with a character who personifies that, someone who tries to play everyone around him or her, someone who thinks he or she can. It could be a character like Gordon Gekko from from the movie "Wall Street" or like Becky Sharp from the book "Vanity Fair." A schemer. A manipulator. Counter that character with one with scruples, one who isn't trying to rule the world, one who is trying to do the right thing.

To them, it's the best thing since sliced bread - a completely immature story suited to their age group which is being presented to them as mature. I mean, have you ever met a twelve year old who DIDN'T think they were "really mature for their age"? Now they have proof. High school students, some of whom are actually over a hundred years old, thinking and behaving exactly the way they dream of behaving.

iNXqiDIYaa	this is the best i can do for you<br>  <br>  With a dodge ball soaring toward her head, time slows as Tessa considers all of the trivial things floating through her mind; an Ashlee Simpson song, the wedgie she has from her gym shorts, and the color of the dodge ball. But the final thought she must consider is the question she needs to answer—if only she could remember it. At 16, Tessa finds herself in heaven taking a journey through past events in her life while she wavers in and out of consciousness in the hospital. Written in verse, her recollections span her earliest memories as a toddler to her most recent memories leading up to the gym-class accident. Tessa's witty and honest voice tells the story of a girl who struggles to make friends, maintain family relationships, and to be honest with herself. Before she can return from where the accident has taken her, she must face the reality of her life and her role in creating that reality. However, what Tessa discovers is a truth that is far more optimistic and promising than she gave herself credit for. Tessa's journey and authentic voice is one that readers will appreciate. Her tendency to turn a blind eye to the good in others and herself is a trait that many teens have in common. What makes this novel unique is its ability to bring the character to this realization without being preachy or condescending.

But we were sending equipment, ships, planes, etc to England under the Lend-Lease Law. <br>  <br>  If Germany had beaten England down and invaded, the next step could have been to attack the British Commonwealth including Canada. If they had, they could have attacked the US from bases in Canada. Even if that did not happen, other than Sweden and Switzerland (for a time, and they had not respected the neutrality of Belgium and other countries), Nazis and Fascists would have controlled Europe. There is no way of knowing if America could have gotten in the war and beaten Hitler by itself.\<br>  <br>  Because the British prevailed despite nearly constant air raids and other attacks, they held on and after America got in the war in Europe, Britain, the US, the free French and others were able to beat Italy, which was less of a factor and defeated a year or so before Germany, then of course launch D-Day, go on to invade Germany and win the war.|`|Y4RS35M7aa	It was supposed to be the 'softening up' of England prior to invasion.  The Kreigsmarine (German Navy) needed the sky clear of the RAF (Royal Air Force) in order to sail an invasion fleet and land an army.

Others, use the concept of "Heaven" for the same goal.<br>  The Eastern Philosophies, Believe not only in the physical realm, but the spiritual realm as well, co-existing side by side.

The child is lost and gone forever.<br>  Instead of fighting for the right to kill people that don't believe as I do, I would rather spend my time telling you to live as if every moment counts, that all that you do, is all you will be known for.<br>  Love the ones around you, raise up children of honor, care for those that cannot care for themselves.

When we would feel one thing, we don't.  The present is incomprehensible in light of the past.  And yet, it has been its undeniable result.    For me, the most incisive point is the double meaning of the powerful final stanza as it comes after the revelations of the preceding one.

Make sure your gallery shows your best stuff (or have a seperate folder for your so-so's). And then you can always choose to advertise your page to non-subscribers. You buy-off a certain amount of link-throughs, which can be very helpful. You can find this option somewhere on your profile near the subscription options.|`|PskIimJZaa	Comment on people's pages and art. But, don't spam! Say helpful or very complementary things.

Obviously, when they get there, they'll only stay if they like what they see, so, only upload your shots that are beyond amazing! Things even you say "Wow!" to. Also, unfortunately, you've got to find your own little..... theme, I guess. The photographers I watch have this: One does very urban and skateboard portraits, one does experimental portraits, one works with bright colors, etc. They're all sort of themed. They don't look like random snap shots and people like to see that!    I, myself, do bright colored, select focus shots.

Make a start.<br>  'The journey of a 1000 miles begins with the first step' (Lao Tse)|`|ifeoAZwFaa	Well you asked what I thought about the  quote so I am going to tell you.<br>  <br>  It is important to be yourself and find your talents and skills. Now why is it important to be yourself?  It is important to be yourself because in being yourself there is no conflict between you and the environment.  When anyone is born, we are constantly taught to fit into the environment and to be something other than what we are.  We are taught to be nice, polite, to believe in Christ, to be in ALlah, to believe in Yahweh, to be courteous to others, to be successful which is to say to get a good job and make a better living than your parents.  You should get good grades.  What I am saying is that you are told to be something other than what you are.  When you are told to be something and you accept that, it means the denial of what you are.  To deny what you are is to be lost, confused and  to live in conflict with the environment because you will constant measure yourself to the standards of society.  Do you see that?  So, "If you let peoples perception of you dictate your behavior, you will never grow as a person" is correct. To grow as a person means to die to cultural influences which means you don't let societies norms to dictate action.  Growth is the denial of environmental influences.  To deny environmental influences means that you are aware of the influences of society and how those influences impact you and others.  Which means you grow by negation (wierd isnt it?).  You grow because you do not let the influences dictate action and that awareness brings about a wholeness to life because in that awareness, there is learning, there is learning without the past dictating what should be and what shouldnt be.  It is a movement from the known to the unknown.  It is that action out of awareness is being and that beingness is what you are.  <br>  When the quote says, "But if you leave yourself open to experience despite what others think, then you will learn and grow and when you grow and mature then you can rub there smug little earing wearing noses in it" is partially true.  <br>  Leaving yourself open is true in that you have to be aware of things and there is nothing wrong with trying things but experience is not a indicator to growth.  It just means you know more things but what good is  that knowledge if that knowledge does not help you to live sanely and lucid?  Can knowledge help you to live sane and lucid in the world? Obviously not because there are many well educated intelligent people in the world yet, they still find life difficult to deal with and have given there advise to others (well meaning) to offer comfort but that offer has created still conflict within people.  In addition, why does one feel to be rub their maturity in others faces?  Is that a sign of maturity or are you playing the ideas of the environment to be something great in the world which is to be successful, well talked about, and accepted by other?  Is that the sign of maturity?  Become aware of your internal movements of self to see the abusurdity of this action.

xdCeBxY4aa	There is  great irony in this part of the novel.

yOK32PM9aa	Yes and no!  I would rather have scholars than martyrs around, as they are a sign of peace and ease, rather than persecution and intolerance.  And generally they have the sense to stay alive, whereas any fool with faith can martyr themselves if they try hard enough.  But anyone's blood is holy, in a sense, and is more precious than ink.  Let's knock over all the inkwells before we kill anyone for what they believe!|`|k0Ewe7mCaa	Some would say so. The scholar knows what he is writing, therefore the odds of it being correct are very high.|`|q3OLSnvqaa	I find it interesting that this is in fact an Islamic saying, discuss|`|XuUMXQ8Naa	Dunno but its easier to write with!|`|c0525648e7f1a8cbba7c650f4cec06ceaa	No because martyrs are made into saints, martrology is the study of saints.  Also blood contains life force which is holy.  However the pen is mightier than the sword.  Writings can inspire millions with ideals.  They can kill a martyr but they can't kill an idea.  Ink in itself isn't holier, but the meanings of the words can be holy.  Martryrs  can inspire humanitarian or spiritual movements, and in the case of saints and avatars their blood is even holier than ours.  However scriptures can make people holy if they are used properly, which doesn't mean logical analysis but an installation of wisdom and higher understanding that can transform us.  We can't equate ink and blood with pacifism and activism because most martyrs are pacifists.  Do they still make ink from squids?  If ink was got from a saintly squid would the writing be holy?|`|7959WbC2aa	I think that Anna reinforces the power of the ink of the scholar. We would not know that martyrs were precious without the ink of the Bible, the ink of the scholar. A martyr not recorded would be both localized and short-lived in memory. So, while the martyrs act might be of the holiest nature, they are dependent on the scholar to make that act known over time and to all. The scholar on the other hand has no need of martyrs for his points to be made. So, I think with the martyrs being dependent and the scholars independent, I will lean to the ink of the scholar.|`|AA11219693	In matters like these one cannot be decisive on one’s own account. I think one should seek light from the high sources, the light of the truth that enlightens scholars enabling them to wage war against falsehood, injustice and ignorance, the same truth that inspires and motivates martyrs enabling them in their sense of right and wrong in this world. What really matters is what is worthier in the eyes of God. This is not for any human being to judge.<br>  <br>  I take the scriptures to be such sources the light of the truth that have definitively, and most clearly, guided, directed, sanctified and enhanced human thought, human mind, human sense of right and wrong, enabling us all to seek to better lives, and sacrifice whatever we have as our best for the sake of truth, for the causes of peace. <br>  <br>  We can understand that the scripture are meant for life, life in its most elaborate sense. The scriptures are meant for a life of righteousness. They are meant for us to make us realise the true value and worth of our own being. They are aimed to raise mankind from its lowly origins to restore it to its essential glory. Then for the purpose of life sacrifices had to be made involving both body and the mind, as the human history informs us. The concept of holiness, you mention, is first and foremost a concept attributed to good life, as without a good life, as a prelude or preamble, nothing could be holy, neither the blood nor the ink. <br>  <br>  In the light of my limited knowledge and understanding of the words of scriptures, I would say that the ink of a scholar would be more desirable, as for its life enhancing quality, and worthy in the eyes of the Lord, however, the blood of a martyr might be just as endearing. I believe the true merits of human actions is for Almighty God to judge, for God is the ‘Master of the day of judgement’ – Al Quran<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/quran/001.qmt.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/...</a>|`|c8828614b563cd3de41253b6a9e40991aa	The blood of the martyrs is precious in God's sight, according to the Bible. It cries out to God from the dust for justice. However, the Bible also states that "there is no end to the making of books" and that too much study is bad for you because you become self-centred and wise in your own conceit.<br>  <br>  The blood of the martyrs is the seed of growth of the Church.|`|trMsK86jaa	If the ink is being applied to the pages of a bible, i do believe that ink could indeed be considered more holy than the blood of a martyr.<br>  <br>  At least, that's christianity for you.|`|AA11894640	There's no comparison...both are equal if holy!<br>  <br>  Is this another take on 'pen being mightier than the sword'???<br>  <br>  When diplomacy fails,  one is forced to use force,  to get desired results...|`|gf7XoXD0aa	In this cruel world, there's no more place for the martyrs.<br>  Shoot the martyrs. lol<br>  <br>  Scholar rule.<br>  Knowledge is power.|`|eezP5wQ2aa	...yes...<br>  ...the scholar can use the blood of the martyr in a negative light...|`|1l74hQL3aa	Shakespeares wisdom says ;<br>  <br>  The pen is mightier than the sword.<br>  <br>  With writing your views you are accepted by 'consent' the reader has a free choice to accept or deny what you have written.- life is given a chance to flourish - peacefully<br>  <br>  The actions of a martyr is expressing views by 'coercion' and force if you dont not agree with a martyr then death will follow - the end of life. The short sighted view of the martyr is;<br>  <br>  'If life is worth living for, it must be worth dying for'<br>  <br>  the scholar appreciates that if life is worth living then it should be passed on to future generation - but by consent|`|EQQFisd8aa	I wouldn't agree with the statement.Neither of the two are holy. Why because its one's practice which matters not what some one writes. If you choose to believe that, by touching the bones of the martyr,you will get healed,so it will be,even if these bones are exchanged with a sinner's you will still get healed-because you have faith and by faith you will get healed and not the bones healing you. <br>  And if a scholar wrote a matra for you to chant believing that all that you want will come to you,and if you do it with faith, you will obtain it. <br>  <br>  So all in all, its you the individual and your faith that is important and not the other way round.<br>  Meaning that, we choose to be who we are.<br>  <br>  Thanks for asking dear|`|uvAjFW8Yaa	No they are equal in being 'holy'.<br>  A martyr demonstrates how nothing in the physical world matters anymore when you have achieved true enlightenment.<br>  Truly inspired scholars give us the pieces of the jigsaw of true enlightenment - we need to put all the pieces together in order to gain insight.<br>  Just two of the facets on the beautiful dazzling gem of enlightenment.|`|inuFojTiaa	Well that depends. First you would have to find ink of the scholar and measure its Holiness. That would be an easy part. Do you know how difficult it is to get license to torture somebody and take his blood? And where would you get holy detector? It is only available in Vatican. So I say screw it. It doesn't mater. If you have ink write, and if you have blood of the martyr... well there is this group of us and you could join us. You would have to get your own rope though.|`|B4YlBDzhaa	Yes, without the scribing of ideals-holy-text(s), the martyr would often be misinformed what he is to die for...and more importantly why he is to die in the way he chooses to do so... for Holiness or otherwise...<br>  <br>  Agreed!|`|552bb6623a8e1faf525514a408566028aa	I really don't have the slightest hint about the holliness of the ink, but I am sure one can live with a scholarship and die on the cross...<br>  <br>   Ciao...John-John.-|`|4288f055d814cff011235e29d2735f63aa	Depends on what the scholar wrote and what did the martyr die for.|`|ssK4oJi9aa	it depends on the situation. no general statement of this nature can be applicable in all cases. becoming a martyr could be holy or just plain stupid. you have to take the specific circumstances of each case into consideration.|`|bxlYleZkaa	Mostly it would depend on what the martyr wrote and the scholar died for, or perhaps the other way around.

I think the subject isn't particularly interesting but you can find a good niche with the book if you focus on the collectors and on their back stories. By highlighting what makes them tick and their idiosyncrasies I think the story can be charming and entertaining. You may what to self-publish it at first though and get it out through the niche market, start a blog with weekly updates of the different collectors you interview and showcase, tell the collectors what you are doing so they can get the word out to their friends about your blog, eventually, when you have enough source material you can be able to create your book and publish it yourself. I don't know if a major publishing company will pay for the rights for this kind of story, that's why I recommend you try publishing it yourself first. However, the concept is sound and I think it can be a delight if you focus on the right things. Good luck!

Read, and follow, their submission guidelines. In those books will be something about writing a query letter, which is what you send to the agent, first. It's part synopsis of your book, and part explanation as to why your book deserves to be published. You have only that one-page letter to wow the agent, so take the time to make it a good one. Expect the whole process to take lots of time, and expect many rejections. When you are accepted by an agent, they will send your book to publishers, not you. The whole process is free, except for postage, until your book is bought by a publisher. That is when the agent gets their cut (usually 15%) of the money which would go to you.<br>  <br>  This assumes that you have already edited your story many times to make it the best it can be, typed it in proper manuscript format (visit <a href="http://www.writersdigest.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.writersdigest.com</a> to find out what is needed), considered joining a writer's group to get feedback from other would-be writers, and gotten it proofread by someone who knows what they are doing (don't rely just on spellcheck).<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AF8mfXQZaa	that's impossible.<br>  <br>  or you can kill a loan shark and get his money.

onTIKM8iaa	My time? I am born and raised in the heartlands, the oldest estate in Singapore. It is often regarded as the 'poor man's district' a few years ago, but now it has regained it's original pride. My time was of jumping about in public playgrounds, peeing on my grandpa's shoulder when he was carrying me, running through the markets and almost causing chaos, ordering the same noodles from the same stall at the same time three times a week...<br>  <br>  It was a small area. I always found it amazing that I could spend my first 4 or 5 years of my life so happily in that area. Then I moved to a newly set up district. True, everything was new and clean, but the community spirit was no longer there. At the old district, everyone knew each other, even the ancestry and family history. They knew where one worked, and where on ached when it rains. This new place did not feature this.<br>  <br>  When I was 10 (I remember this age clearly), my Grandfather died. I went to stay at his flat for the whole period of his wake, about 5 days. His casket lay on the top of a 'mountain' (to Singaporean standards anyway). This mountain was where I spend most of my childhood. It was there when I learned the ways of life, how to mix in with children I did not know, why I must go to school instead of play all day and how should I manage bullies.<br>  <br>  This was the first time in many years I looked back on my past life and missed it. I went back to the same store again, going back to the same playgrounds bla bla bla.<br>  <br>  I may not have answered the question as you want it, but this is how Singapore was during my time.|`|AA11586960	My first time in Singapore was very much a colonial island loved the people and was based a Tengah with the RAF full of the old shop houses ever were was in English Used to teach the RSAF during courses in the UK was there again 2 years later Orchard road had been cleaned up covers over the Storm Drains then went back in in 1970 and singapore was a modern City loved the new shopping centers and the grand hotels <br>  <br>  and love the people i found them to be Honest Kind and very friendly <br>  <br>  my last time in singapore for a week was in 1985 and by this time Restorations had been completed on some of the old colonial Buildings <br>  <br>  for me it is the ideal place to unwind and relax and every trip i remember old mates with a tiger in the Raffles and a visit to the WW2 war graves cemetery|`|q6phm94caa	My time was 1964.<br>  Singapore in 1964 was a bustling oriental city full of life. A few modern high rise office buildings but mostly the remains of the prewar timber built city and hastily built post-war cement and concrete. The traffic was chaotic, caused mostly by the tricycle rickshaws jostling for position against the delivery trucks, buses, and Holden saloon cars, all in a road system void of markings, lights, or traffic directions of any description.<br>  The Raffles Hotel was already in a state of decline and the best place to dine western style was the Goodwood Hotel. Better still were the multitude of small restaurants and pavement stalls selling the best that malayan, indonesian, chinese, and south east asian cooking had to offer. Britain still had a Naval Base at Woodlands and to prove it HMS Triumph was moored midstream. <br>  The romantic centre for young Singaporeans was the Jardine Steps where you could sit and watch the lights twinkling across the harbour, listen to the comings and goings of the harbour ferries, and smell the sweet aroma of the Shell Oil refinery on Pulla Bukom.<br>  And in 1964 Bugis Street was still there, so everyone new how to tell the boys from the girls.|`|ZB9zkbxxaa	My time's now<br>  <br>  A free port centred on the southern part of Singapore island, it so dominates the island that the republic is now commonly considered a city-state. Known as the Garden City for its many parks and tree-lined streets, it offers glimpses into the cultures brought to it by immigrants from all parts of Asia. Traditionally founded by a Shrivijayan prince, it was an important Malay city in the 13th century. Destroyed by the Javanese in the 14th century, it was refounded by Stamford Raffles of the British East India Company in 1819. It became the capital of the Straits Settlements in 1833 and developed as a port and naval base; today it is one of the world's great commercial centres. Its thriving banking, insurance, and brokerage firms make it the chief trading and financial centre of Southeast Asia. It is home to the National University of Singapore (1980).

24c92661915a4582662b691cb05dc0baaa	These days many directors are more open to casting people of different ethnic backgrounds than those the parts were originally written for. It'd fairly commonplace to see even Shakespeare done with a mixed cast, including parents and children whose races are different. It simply means that you shouldn't assume that because of your race you would not be considered for certain roles. <br>  <br>  It can also mean in a particular case that a director is afraid actors will see what the show is, assume there are no good roles if you aren't African American, and then there won't be a good mix of actors to choose from for smaller non-African American roles.|`|0dU50gc9aa	i think when situations like this come up it really comes down to the actor personally and what their mentality to auditioning is period. you have to be strong period to audition b/c there is such a strong chance of rejection. when put into a position where you're auditioning against the traditional casting, it's an even greater gap to jump. but this can also make it easier. reposition your thinking into making it a challenge for yourself. the odds are against you, true, but if you nail it, then they may reconsider all traditions. plus you may have a director who wants to take it in a different direction. or they're scared that the turn out won't be what they need. sometimes auditions are as random as taking a bunch of pieces, putting them in one bag, and see which ones fit together the best out of what showed up; whether it's who looks better together or who auditioned the best or who is more reliable...only the director or the person casting truly knows what happens but so many factors effect their final decision. see what happens when you start thinking about it too much. <br>  <br>  so to answer your question...yes they mean it. otherwise they wouldn't have said it. that being said, it doesn't guarentee you or anyone else anything. it just means they are potentially going to cast outside the box. regardless, this just means you have one more opporutnity where there might have been none so just do a rockin job!
QW0Fhg3Laa	I found this on wikipedia, <br>     "The book is made up mainly of striking, simple images, like colors. Death associates the death of others by a certain colour depending on the sky. Hans Hubermann's eyes are described as being made of silver, which look right into you, and is often referred to by the way he plays the accordion. Rosa Hubermann is said to have a cardboard complexion with a wardrobe figure and elasticy hair. Max Vandenburg has hair like feathers (or twigs when it isn't washed). Rudy Steiner has lemon coloured hair. Liesel herself is characterised through words rather than imagery, perhaps reflecting her love of words and earning her the title "the book thief"."<br>  <br>  I remember it being said at the end of the book that when Liesel kissed Rudy, she saw the sky as a 'silver afternoon'. I'm not sure what silver represents, but being that her poppa was always a caring man, and that she saw a silver sky when kissing Rudy (on a not-so-happy occasion,) perhaps silver is the color of love. In the beginning when Liesel's brother dies on the train, death depicts the scene of white imagery--everything covered in snow and ice. It's like he's comparing the cold of death with the snow. And perhaps here white has something to do with the innocence of the young soul? (White is often associated with purity.) <br>  In one of the beginning chapters titled, 'The Flag' death even describes the three colors he associates most with Liesel. Them being white, red and black. He also associates black in a later chapter with the sky when the pilot crashes and dies in town. Perhaps black stands for sadness. (Her life after all is composed of many sad events.) White for innocence or purity, she is a pure soul. And Red? I'm not so sure of red. Though he does reference red in his chapter, "Arrival on Himmel Street". <br>  <br>  "That last time.<br>  That red sky...<br>  How does a book thief end up kneeling and howling and flanked by a man-made heap of ridiculous, greasy, cooked-up rubble?" (Pg. 19)<br>  <br>  Rudy had lemon-colored hair. It was stated a million times over. Though there were many blonde-haired blue eyed germans, only Rudy was mentioned as the lemon-haired boy. He always seemed to me to epitomize childhood. He was carefree. (As far as being laid-back, as children are free spirits,) he was imaginative, he was caring, he was sensitive....Perhaps lemon-yellow encompasses these traits. His hair is even mentioned in the end of the book.<br>  <br>  It was such a wonderful book :) <br>  I miss the characters.

shVgCizBaa	do u think the war of 1812 was a war of independence, maritime rights? or expansionism?I think it was about maritime rights,trade restrictions introduced by Britain to impede American trade with France,a threat to British maritime supremacy --------------------------------------On  June 18, the United States declared war on Britain. The war had many causes, but at the center of the conflict was Britain's ongoing war with Napoleon’s France. The British, said Jon Latimer in 2007, had only one goal: "Britain's sole objective throughout the period was the defeat of France."  If America helped France, then America had to be damaged until she stopped, or "Britain was prepared to go to any lengths to deny neutral trade with France." Latimer concludes, "All this British activity seriously angered Americans." [9] Trade tensions<br>  The British were engaged in war with the First French Empire and did not wish to allow the Americans to trade with France, regardless of their theoretical neutral rights to do so. As Horsman explains, "If possible, England wished to avoid war with America, but not to the extent of allowing her to hinder the British war effort against France. Moreover… a large section of influential British opinion, both in the government and in the country, thought that America presented a threat to British maritime supremacy."[10]The War of 1812, between the United States of America and the British Empire (particularly Great Britain and British North America), was fought from 1812 to 1815.<br>  <br>  There were several immediate stated causes for the U.S. declaration of war. First, a series of trade restrictions introduced by Britain to impede American trade with France, a country with which Britain was at war; the U.S. contested these restrictions as illegal under international law.[3] Second, the impressment (forced recruitment) of U.S. citizens into the Royal Navy. Third, the alleged British military support for American Indians who were offering armed resistance to the United States.[4]<br>  <br>  The war was fought in three major theatres: on the oceans, where the warships and privateers of both sides preyed on each other's merchant shipping; along the American coast, which was blockaded with increasing severity by the British, who also mounted large-scale raids in the later stages of the war; and on the long frontier, running along the Great Lakes and Saint Lawrence River, which divided the U.S. from Upper Canada (now the province of Ontario) and Lower Canada (now the province of Quebec). The United States could directly attack British territory and armies only in this last theatre. During the course of the war, both the Americans and British launched invasions of each other's territory across this frontier, most of which were unsuccessful or gained only temporary success. At the end of the war, the British held parts of Maine and some outposts in the sparsely populated West while the Americans held Canadian territory near Detroit, but all occupied territories were restored at the end of the war.<br>  <br>  In 1813, the Americans gained one of their main goals by breaking a confederation of Native American tribes. By taking control of Lake Erie, they cut them off from British aid, and Tecumseh, the Indian leader, was killed at the Battle of the Thames. While some Natives continued to fight alongside British troops, they subsequently did so only as individual tribes or groups of warriors and where they were directly supplied and armed by British agents.<br>  <br>  After two years of warfare, the major causes of the war had disappeared. Neither side had any reason to continue or any chance of gaining a decisive success which would compel their opponents to cede territory or advantageous peace terms. As a result of this stalemate, the two nations signed the Treaty of Ghent on 24 December 1814. News of the peace treaty took two months to reach the U.S., during which fighting continued. In this interim, the Americans won a major victory at the Battle of New Orleans.<br>  <br>  In the United States, battles such as New Orleans and the earlier successful defence of Baltimore (which inspired the lyrics of the U.S. national anthem, The Star-Spangled Banner) produced a sense of euphoria over a "second war of independence" against Britain. It ushered in an "Era of Good Feelings," in which the partisan animosity that had once verged on treason practically vanished. Canada also emerged from the war with a heightened sense of national feeling and solidarity. This was later expressed as the "Militia Myth," the notion that locally recruited militia rather than British regular troops bore the major burden of the fighting in Canada and the adjoining parts of the United States. Britain, which had regarded the war as a sideshow to the Napoleonic Wars raging in Europe, was less affected by the fighting; its government and people subsequently welcomed an era of peaceful relations with the United States.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_1812" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_1812</a>|`|AA11586960	it was US expansionism caused by the British blockades by the Royal navy<br>  <br>  it was the First time the USA went to war and lost they wanted to remove the British from North America and hoped the french and the indians would support them but the population of what is called canada decided to Stay british and the the US army was on the Run chased out of washington where the British burnt down as many Government buildings as possible <br>  <br>  it was a total loss to the USA the never gained anything and the Generosity of the winners gave back all the Real estate gained in the war the USA was negotiating peace in Gent and signed a peace agreement before the British met Jackson so technically the war was over weeks before and the Original reason for the war was not resolved|`|gW0nD5cEaa	The British still thought they could force American sailors into their navy; and also when they invaded they burned down the White House and other places in Washington DC, so they could have taken over again and made America into a colony again, so I guess it could be for independence. Also Maritime rights, to stop them from taking our sailors. Beyond that, I'm not sure. Britain was the most powerful country in the world at the time and the upstart nation of the United States was not exactly a world power.|`|1hvrQYWiaa	Definitely an attempt at expansionism by USA - a war party in Congress urged the conquest of Canada, seeing it as an ideal time as Britain was busy fighting the Napoleonic Wars. War was declared on 19 June 1812 under the pretext of defending the doctrine of "Freedom of the Seas" and a 3 pronged invasion of Canada was immediately put into action - hardly the place to enforce "Freedom of the Seas". Additionally, the French attacked American ships and impressed their sailors into naval service (as the British did), but there was no declaration of war against France...|`|Y4RS35M7aa	As I was growing up in the 60s, we were taught that the War of 1812 was the 'second half' of the Revolutionary War.  England was trying to..re-take the colonies.  I think that that is rubbish.  England would lose a war in America once France intervened again, so why were we fighting? <br>  <br>  I think that maritime rights were part of it.  The mighty Royal Navy could pretty much do as they pleased, as long as the French weren't around, and stopping American shipping was easy to do.  Claiming American sailors were British deserters was easy, too.  Many were!  <br>  <br>  It may have been the dying gasps of British rule on America's Eastern Seaboard, or it may have been England's way of putting America in it's place, but the fact is that America lost most of that war.  Sure, the naval war on the Great Lakes was an American victory, but Washington City was burned by the Redcoats!  Andy Jackson won the Battle of New Orleans, but Washington City was burned by the Redcoats!|`|IKCxj9gHaa	The war was primarily about trade and America taking an opportunist attitude to grabbing land off Canada while the British had their hands full in Europe fighting the French.<br>  <br>  Much has been made of the Royal Navy stopping American ships and impressing the American sailors into the Royal navy, however the situation was that the men they took were in fact British deserters from the Royal Navy in the first place. RN ships would dock in a port and if an American ship was there, they would desert their Royal Navy ship and join the crew of the American ship. Royal Navy crew were wanted by ships captains as they were considered the best trained and most experienced and as such were offered high rates of pay and better working conditions. Once a Royal navy deserter had signed his name on the Captains book and become a crewman on an American ship, he was automatically given American citizenship. this lead to claims the navy was kidnapping US citizens to work for the Royal Navy when in fact all the Navy was doing was taking back their own runaway staff. (Although knowing the navy they almost certainly took a few proper americans with them)<br>  <br>  The reason for the war and the reason the Navy were stopping American ships in the first place was actually because the British Royal navy was blockading most of mainland Europe to stop French trading internationally. (much like the period of time between the two Iraq wars when nato ships stopped ships coming in and out of Iraq and inspected them for weapons etc) The Americans still traded with France and the rest of mainland europe and as such their ships were often stopped and the contents inspected. while the navy was onboard the American crew would be checked to see if there were any ex-Royal navy men there (The Royal Navy men were usually easy to find as they would have many tattoos and often scars on their backs from being flogged, flogging did not happen in the US navy and the American crewmen did not have the British crewmens superstisions about Tattoos so usually didn't have any)<br>  <br>  The fact that the Americans were being stopped from trading with Europe by the British was the main cause of the war, the Americans in the North East were still trading with Britain and really did not want any war in an ironic twist of fate the Rebels of the Revolution turned into the Loyalists of 1812. During the war the towns along the new england coast still maintained a steady trade with England, even selling them timber for their ships and Iron for their cannons, Even after the Royal Navy arrived and blockaded the ports English ships were still allowed though and continued to trade The southern states were more pro-war due in part to the fact they had the new recently purchased non-English states/colonies in their ranks (The battle of New Orleans being a prime example with much of the American Militia being made up of Former French colonists in Lousiana)<br>  <br>  There is no mistaking the fact that the war was close to becoming becoming a major victory for the anglo canadians, the peace terms imposed on the Americans could have been very harse, at the end of the war british and Canadian forces held large parts of north east America, their navy had arrived in massive force and could block any port in america and land large armies anywhere they pleased along the eastern seaboard. While the Americans had an excellent navy with superbly made ships crewed by very competent and couragous men, their navy was tiny compared to the British one, the largest American Ship had 40-50 guns the largest British ships would have 90-100, and they had over a hundred of these monsters plus a further 500 ships of smaller sizes.<br>  <br>  Thankfully for all concerned the British had just finished an 18 year war with the French and were more concerned with getting out of America and using the hard won peace to expand their empire. as such the peace terms were very generous to the USA, all sides finally sat down and agreed a border between the USA and Canada, which still remains to this day, and as a thank you for the support of the people of the ports of the north eastern sea board they allowed them fishing rights in the st lawerence river which was a great help as at the time fishing stocks of the coast of New England were shrinking.<br>  <br>  The main thing for America was the fact that this was a lesson learnt, thanks to the confidence gained from the war of Independance the US had been thinking it was strong enough to deal as equals with the European super powers of the time. the War was a wake up call for them, (they could not take on the British alone and no other European country was willing or able to help them) they were simply not strong enough in manpower or financial muscle to compete. And the war had shown there was a fault line between northern and southern states that was already opening. As such America stopped trying to get involved in European affairs and instead started to look to themselves, within 20 years

ScaAyzKHaa	Because the point of studying history is not to change the past, but to make better choices in the future. Dates are less important than 'why?' You need to know why something happened much more than you need to know when (although knowing when helps to keep it straight).|`|zakIuo91aa	your ot the only one. i think about it so often.|`|PgFYPZg2aa	I think its something like those who do not study the mistakes of the past are doomed to repeat them, something crazy like that.|`|gW0nD5cEaa	I always liked history, and people, including my sister always argued you can't do anything with it, she's good in math, I'm not. But I just like it, I can't explain why. <br>  <br>  But I don't remember having to learn a lot of dates, except like July 4, 1776 or Dec. 7 1941, or something like that. I don't remember numbers very well, so if I had to learn dates I would have had trouble. But I like knowing what went on. And remember, every news broadcast in a way is history. <br>  <br>  No offense to teachers, but it also could have to do with who is teaching you. My Mom had a great interest in history and got me interested to some extent before I actually had it in school. But my first actual history teacher (we had other history before, but she just taught social studies) in the 7th and 8th grades, was great. She made it fun and even let kids kind of do "Tonight SHow" type jokes (Clean, of course, it was a Catholic school) sometime, imagining how comedians would have talked about the issues of different times. Only on occasion, of course, not most of the time. That helped bring humor into it, it was not all dry and boring. In high school I had other teachers who were not that good, and if I did not like history they would not have helped.|`|shVgCizBaa	The study of history is very useful because  leaders of the world learn not to repeat the errors of the past ,to understand the present and to planify the future. .In the past the main factors were economy and personal powers.Presently the economy has collapsed,a lot of money has been injected.During the Great Depression not enough money was injected.This resulted in a long depression|`|onTIKM8iaa	the study of history is not to change the past, it is to learn from the past and make sure it does not happen again. <br>  <br>  ps. you probably aren't the only one, but those who agree with you would not be likely to be in this section|`|xzhJ0lWfaa	cause we would not repeat the same mistakes..but it will be impossible cause people in France, great britain, U.S , DON NOT APOLOGIES FOR THE IMPERIALISM AND COLONIALISM|`|6YuktLyNaa	You shouldn't look at history as dates you have to remember and that you can't change it.  History are the experiences that the human race has gone through in the past.  The present will become history when enough time passes, but does it make today irrevelant to the future? Nope, it will be studied by people in the future when they look at what we did right and wrong.  It's also nice to know what kind of world we live in because lifestyle changes dramatically as time goes on and living in a different time is just as radical if not more than living in a different location.|`|ZYCRkgawaa	I would like to think you don't NOT like history, you just don't have teachers who have helped you connect to it. Education is aimed at dates, names, and places because they can be tested.<br>  <br>  History is more than that. It is love stories, struggles for fame and power, different cultures, castles, and battles and royalty. SO much more than dates. <br>  <br>  Try some historical novels or romances to get you interested. Ask your school or city librarian for suggestions appropriate for your age--not too young, not too graphic. Once you get hooked on the stories, the dates will make more sense as you learn how it all relates.<br>  <br>  Try a biography of Marie Antoinette, Cleopatra, Queen Elizabeth I, Harriet Tubman, Dolly Madison, or any other famous woman.<br>  <br>  You may find that you love the insider info even if you hate memorizing for the test.|`|tVOzjukaaa	There is a difference between hating history, and hating history class. It is unfortunate that some history classes simply feed you names, places, and dates without meaning. The real purpose of studying history....or math, or science, or language, or literature....is to learn about our world using various perspectives and approaches to understand it. We can provide a context for our own lives through the study of history, and can come to have a deeper appreciation for the events in our present world today. And it's not just about mistakes. History gives a more complete world view in general. I hope that you will someday find a way to derive more meaning from history than your current classes offer. Good luck!|`|L3SVAJd4aa	Some people study history, like myself, because we love learning about other people from other times, simply put. It's not supposed to be torture in school, but how can you go about life not knowing how your country was founded at the very least? I highly doubt you're the only one who hates learning about history, just as I am the not the only one who hated PE.|`|zlQo7WMoaa	Well, to be honest. History is my favorite subject in school.|`|vUvxicTKaa	NO I DONT LIKE HISTORY EITHER AND GUESS WAT IM IN MY HISTORY CLASS NOW I HAVE TO RESEARCH THE RENAISSANCE JUNK|`|KHSOVxViaa	No, but many people find it fascinating!<br>  <br>  I suspect that most people who hate history do so because their teachers are boring and/or the aspect of history being taught just doesn't interest them.<br>  <br>  I agree with you about dates - it's the sequences that matter.  What caused what.  Who came after whom, what they did and why.  The dates are just details that you can look up if necessary - it's the understanding of what went on that matters.  I really don't know why so many education systems make people memorise dates rather than understand sequences and reasons.<br>  <br>  Because history is a vast subject, there is a huge amount of aspects to it.  Many stories to be told. Different things appeal to different people.<br>  <br>  It's easy to understand that some people might find gripping the story of a battle that swings on a knife edge, where each side has so much to win or lose.  The sort of thing that makes an excellent movie, keeping people on the edge of their seats.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, those people might find deathly dull the statistical analysis of the use of a type of plough in a province, even though it might have great importance.  However, there's always somebody who will find even that interesting!<br>  <br>  Horses for courses.<br>  <br>  History does have significance as it makes us better understand our place in the world; how we got where we are, and how we might deal with particular problems.  It can teach us valuable lessons, though too often we choose to forget and make similar mistakes again.<br>  <br>  If you think of us as just existing at a small moment in a huge swathe of time, if gives us a better sense about where are ancestors were in the grand scheme of things, and maybe about where we're going.  It encourages us to take a step back, and see present-day details in a bigger perspective.  From that can come wiser decisions and maybe a better world.<br>  <br>  BTW my favourite history book reads a bit like an adventure novel: "The History of the Conquest of the Incas" by John Hemming.  Gripping stuff!

KHSOVxViaa	There were several.  At the time of independence, UK, Portugal and France.<br>  <br>  Early European influence was by commercial companies, though often backed up by state resources.  The earliest Europeans to exert any territorial control were the Portuguese.  They were followed by the Netherlands, France and the UK (England before Union).  Colonies were gained and lost, wars fought, deals done, and eventually the British East India Company gained most of the subcontinent.  After a major rebellion, the Company's sovereignty was transferred to the British Government.  British India became a colony.<br>  <br>  At the time of Indian independence, most of India was controlled by the UK, Portugal had Goa and a smattering of smaller enclaves, and France had the town of Pondicherry.

If something is not tangible in any manner than it can not necessarily exist.|`|f3bb70dee35ef28e84fcc054691669dbaa	You are forgetting we don't just see with our eyes, we see with our brains.  Our brains will fill in missing information or even create something that is not even there.  You can also can look at something and it won't register that it is there, how many time you overlook something.    From a movie in the past.  "Your eyes can deceive you, don't trust them"    When there is a lot of information that needs to be process our brains will drop most of what we believe is the least important.    Through out our busy life we also are not aware what is around us.    You don't think the idea, of angels and demons come from the minds of people and that idea create what we perceive as a metaphysical world?   Or the idea of how gravity works or the end of the universe or even "evolution of life" is taught, effects what we think? Thus, effects what we see.    So, I guess what I'm saying is we as humans are missing the majority of what is around us and also create things that's not there.|`|AA10122247	This is an amazing observation! LOL I always wondered what it would be like if we could actually see all the radio waves, x-rays, & magnetic wavelengths. It would be so overwhelming that you couldnt see into the distance to see a far away object or the stars. Not to mention that the blue sky we see is only a refraction of the all the water on the planet surface. Without that we would see an amazing purple hue with moving magnetic rings in the sky during the day.   On the part of Demons, ghosts, & metaphysical beings we would be in absolute fear for our mortality knowing that we could be hurt by them or become one of them. Imagine burying your relative and running into their ghost a few days later. Forget about it! It would be only amazing because you would probably see the light projected from our physical beings.  And you could tell Good from Evil without any misjudgment.   If you took away the light and we were in total darkness that made normal people sightless, and you still had the power to see even all the stuff they couldnt see, I think it would be a bit scary but very interesting.

Or the roar of a waterfall when it dries up?  Of course the life can just stop.  What happens to the light when you flip the switch on a light bulb?  What happens to the dance when everyone sits down?  To the parade when everyone goes home?  Just because a living thing or non living thing can produce an effect, doesn't mean the effect lives on independently of the thing that produces it - when we die, it appears that we just stop.  No one who's died has ever been heard from again, so ... it could be they all get transported to a pub in Dun Loughaire, but there's not much evidence of it.|`|yUHh1Q8Qaa	The fact you insist on is that a human being is both a physical body and a physical something else that survives death (energy)      Granting the above, the answer is obvious. The energy that survives death goes the same way as the light that coursed through the light bulb that is now extinguished or the energy that contracted the muscle fiber that is now at rest.    But, if that energy is in fact what makes us living beings. then light bulbs and computers are just as alive as we are.  Do you believe that also?|`|5RbXr7Wjaa	Good question and good use of physics to make a point. But honestly, who knows? I myself am agnostic, a portion of me believes there is no 'life inside me' and that I am simply what I am. The other side would hope that the 'life inside me', or the spirit or soul or etc., does transcend this existence and enter a spiritual world.|`|I6D7xdcVaa	If you have ever lived, then you know that we cant know that.|`|849d6b13631f1ba99a0c1e7655b40d5faa	There is no answer for what "actually" happens, but the possibility exists, that the energy contained in our atoms is recycled by the universe.    Our consciousness is not necessarily transferred or contained within that energy, as that consciousness or awareness is not only based on our limited ability to understand the relationship between that energy and our perception, but is also based on the manifestation of that perception.  Therefore, consciousness is only useful in this plane of existence.  The overall stream of energy has no use for the poorly translated awareness of the universe, as that energy is in fact the only true element of the universe.    That's difficult to get your head around, I know.  But consider, that each of our cells has the ability to learn and remember it's experiences within this environment, as do all single celled organisms.  Then consider that, our bodies are simply a community of some 5 trillion cells, all sharing that learned information.  That learned information makes up consciousness.  The "I" that you refer to, when you describe your hand, or foot, or your body as a whole, (i.e. my hand.  Who is "my"?), is actually the collective awareness of your cellular community.    When death occurs, that cellular awareness is broken up, and therefore, so is your consciousness.|`|nXIm9Oqvaa	That's exactly what I've been wondering for the past hour...Ahah...|`|LWpUjTHmaa	Scientifically energy cannot be destroyed, if you speak scientifically, you can argue that after a person die, theres a change inside his body on his organs that render his body useless and therefore unable to think, unable to have its own mind, unable to live. Once the brain is rendered you're  no longer able to supply for the electricity going through your brain and so it stops you from thinking. By stopping your brain it shuts off your conscious and becomes death.

45SWXnq1aa	I love Zadie Smith at the moment; she's got to be up there. Try White Teeth for something that's easy to read yet incredibly well-written; it's both hilarious and deeply poignant, and always, always a page-turner.    Other than that - John Irving's The World According To Garp will always have a special place in my heart. Like White Teeth, it's funny and moving in turns, and Garp is one of the most likable characters I've ever had the good fortune to come across.    Anyone looking to improve their standards of reading should, I think, try Ian McEwan, if you haven't already. Enduring Love or Atonement are my favourites - you might remember the film of Atonement, which wasn't a patch on the book. For one thing, it made it seem 'lovey dovey', which it absolutely isn't; it's incredibly hard-hitting and really, very sad. McEwan's a fabulous writer and the prose just leaps off the page.    The Secret History by Donna Tartt is another favourite; apparently, when it was first released in the early Nineties, people were literally walking down the street reading it - and I can see why! Despite it being 400+ pages, I finished it in a couple of days because I just couldn't put it down. It's full of murder, intrigue and beautifully-crafted characters, and just like all the others I've mentioned, is so easy to read it just flies by.    The Catcher in the Rye certainly ticks most of the boxes you asked for; it's certainly meaning-filled, there's a definite unique and interesting style to it...I refuse to give it a thorough recommendation, because personally I loathed it, but I believe I'm in the minority, so it might be worth at least flicking through next time you're in a bookshop to see if it catches your fancy.    All those are contemporary novels; but if you haven't already, I'd definitely suggest reading some of the 'classics'. Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre is one of my favourites; again, it's a love story, but it's certainly not 'lovey dovey' in the traditional sense - or, if that's too conventional for your tastes, what about Wuthering Heights by Charlotte's sister Emily? All those windy moors...and Cathy and Heathcliff - two of the most compelling, least likable heroes in fiction -  having a strange, symbiotic, quasi-incestuous relationship that couldn't be more different from the 'traditional' romance. Then there's Dickens - Oliver Twist is my particular favourite, though I do also rather like Great Expectations, and you can never deny the brilliance of A Christmas Carol - and Oscar Wilde's A Picture of Dorian Grey is amazingly louche and decadent, much like I imagine the man himself to have been.    I hope you pick up at least one of these at some point, even if my recommendations aren't the cause, since they're all great books. Let me know how it goes - and most of all, keep reading! =)|`|uq1GXvSdaa	John Case has some interesting books  and Harry Potter series is good to.|`|0NcRUSCoaa	"Out" by Natsuo Kirino.

So I'd recommend anything by Frederick Forsythe (The Day of the Jackal, especially). Among my favourites are the Quiller books by Adam Hall (Quiller is an agent who is far more interesting that Bond).   The Sherlock Holmes stories by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle are, quite frankly, superb. While Doyle's plots are sometimes a little light, the writing is excellent. In the same vein, G K Chesterton's Father Brown stories display a good command of the written language. And for good old-fashioned adventure the Richard Hannay stories by John Buchan take some beating (The 39 Steps, Greenmantle, etc).  I thoroughly enjoyed The Bourne Identity by Robert Ludlum (beats the film hands down, and I enjoyed the film).  These are in no way lovey-dovey, horrific, or childish.  I'd avoid like the plague Harry Potter and Twilight books. They, clearly, are not for you.|`|UzJBYk5zaa	Jane Austen is romantic, but her books are much more than just cheap love stories. Start with Pride and Prejudice if you can. It will definitely help your vocabulary.     You could also try Charlotte and Emily Bronte, and Virginia Woolf. It's just what came to mind, hope it helps :)     EDIT - I have to agree with Cailean. Sherlock is well written with a good sense of humor.|`|mxtWuadraa	To be honest, as soon as I read this question, various classical novels started popping up in my head! They are hard to read, (I mean you really do have to pay attention!) but they really do test your analytical skills. I recently read Tess of the D'Urbervilles (I was forced to for my GCSE's) and although I found it unbelievably depressing to start off with, it really stretched me, and I actually ended up enjoying it loads! I love to analyse various techniques the authors have used in classical novels, and this book held loads of subtle metaphors.     You can also try books like 'To Kill a Mockingbird', 'Jane Eyre', maybe the Lord of the Rings trilogy (but I suggest you read the Hobbit first.. it's such a great book!!) 'A Pack of Lies' by Geraldine Macgaughren (sorry can't spell her surname!!) is amazing, one of my favourite books! Really it's a book of short stories, but they're all told by an eccentric bloke who turns up (called MCC Berkshire) and it has so much room for thought! It is a childs book, but it's a fantastic one, and tbh, I wouldn't count it as a kiddies book.     If you want to go more fantasy, why don't you try some Terry Pratchett books? The Colour of Magic is awsome.. it made me laugh sooo many times!! and his new one, Nation, is really good too!!!     There is another book you might like, although I don't even know whether it's sold anywhere.. I picked it up in an old second hand book shop yearrs ago.. Journey to the Center of the Earth by Jules Verne. It probably is still for sale! It's a bit more sciency (not science fiction!) but it's really coool at the same time. There are some really amazing bits.     Also (I know, this list just keeps going on!!!) You could try the Inheritance Trilogy (by Christopher Paolini). They're better known by their individual names (Eragon, Eldest and Brisingr) and are simply fantastic! Although a bit on the saga side, so you'll need to read one after the other because otherwise you'll forget what happens (I'm rereading Eragon and Eldest before I start on Brisingr!).     Good luck on your expansion, and I hope i helped!!!

Khaled Hosseini's The Kite Runner is an excellent read as well, he has a great writtign style which is full of imagery.    if you're looking for something very complex and very different, another good one is Ayn Rand's Anthem--the language is not very colorful, but its still an amazing novel.

I think a lot of my  favourite authors are covered by the other contributors ie, the bronte sisters books and any jane austen which are not what i would call lovey dovey, they are satirical and quite funny. If you like suspense then both jonathon and faye kellerman are excellent reads. as is lee childs. some of tess gerritson, surgeon and apprentice are creepy.  if you like science fiction/fantasy try david gemmell or anne mccaffrey and  david eddings,  I also like robin hobb, alan dean foster, and craig shaw gardener writes very  amusing science fantasy. could i also suggest you try biographies.

KL8cqbC0aa	It is a cool idea and i like the suspense you could build in the first paragraph. The story line is good to.    But:  I think that revealing the the whole story in the first sentence is silly, instead you could describe how the character is confused by what he is seeing. You could describe the characters fear.  And then after the suspense and tension builds, you tell your reader what he is seeing     And yes, I do think that suddenly switching from third person to second person. It won't flow.    Also stories in second person are really annoying to read, and confusing. I wouyld stick to first and third person perspective.|`|yMRY5cgxaa	check out this site it is very helpful|`|SSmM05guaa	One tip: Don't give up. This is most likely to get you an A if you give it a lot of thought.|`|SMrSII2eaa	If you're looking for how to write a story, I'll give you some tips.  First things first- expect a lot from your self.  Later find a good topic/that'll attract whoever you are aiming for.  It could be a real life situation or a dream that you had that you fell in love with and didn't want to forget so soon. Start somewhere in your story that you are able to. (i.e. if you have a dream about a man who dies but comes back to life), jump in right there and then you can work before/after/middle in that. Just get your basic idea down first. Make time to write every single day. Some day's you'll have to force yourself to and only get a few sentences down. Other days you can get atleast a chapter down. Start writing in a notebook where it's easy to find your ideas and easy to change your story. Later work on typing it in WORD. Save it onto a jumpdrive or a hardrive just incase your computer were to crash and you lost everything. That takes me back to my first point- write in a notebook, too. Once you have your story typed/written get someone whom you really trust to give you constructive critism. Read back through it and tie up any loose ends. Now here's the fun part :) Name your book if you haven't already done so. Be silly and think of a cover you think will draw people into reading it. Take it to several publishers and see what they have to say.Either they'll as for more or they will send you packing. It's a dog for a dog world, the writing business. Good luck.   Some tips:  -Keep two notebooks to write character names in and plots and then one for your actual story.  -NEVER post ANY of your ideas on the internet. They'll be in some one else's hands in a heart beat.   -While your writing, don't think about the fame and glory you may get from your book. You will never get it done.  -If your first book doesn't get published, it's okay to be upset for a little while but don't put writing on the back burner. Continue with your story to make it better or start with a new writing project.  -It's going to be stressful but just hang im there.  -Most importantly just have fun writing. Let your brain wonder... turn on your active imagination.    Hope I helped you,  Madison H.
nxShNcWfaa	Well honestly i would of loved to either be a dancer or an ice skater.  Originally i was brilliant at gymnastics, my teacher (who herself had won medals n stuff) said i was very good and she was ready to put me in a competition however i had an accident wen i was 11, i broke my arm badly n damaged the muscles in my arm, when it healed the teacher said she would no longer tutor me.    I was crushed so my mum took me to an ice skating rink and i had a talent for that too and mum agreed to pay for private tution as we had just come into a bit of money but dad thought it was a waste of time and wouldnt drive me to the rink each week.    Then wen i was 12 a friends sister started a dance class which i then started going with her, for the next few years i got pretty good at it but then my knee collapsed in, i had low cartalidge (i think that was wat the doc said?) in my knees so i gave up dance.    Now i do art which i love, i'm just waiting for summat to stop me from this lol.    My mum always said i was artistic in many different ways, she always said i'd end up doing something that i could express myself with and everytime something stops me from doing one thing i find another way to express myself lol.

Here is another example: If i can divide a distance in 1/2 an infinite amount of times, then at what distance does the bullet stop being a distance away from the target and actually hit it?    Zeno of Elea was a Greek philosopher who told the tale of Achilles and the Tortoise and their race. Because Achilles could run twice as fast as the tortoise he gave the tortoise a head start. However, when Achilles reaches the tortoise's starting point the tortoise has moved ahead by half the distance of its lead. Then by the time Achilles reaches that point the tortoise has moved on half the distance again .... and so on. The logical conclusion being that Achilles never catches up with the tortoise!    It is a paradox and there is no mathematical solution as yet.     Infinitesimally small is a concept that has proved itself useful time and time again. But you can't divide by 0 and you can't divide by infinity because it is not a number.    Of course whatever the philosophical mathematics predicts we know it is faulty or limited because we know the bullet will hit the target and Achilles will catch the tortoise. Thus the theory has been disproved by contradiction.    The paradox and its contradiction through practical experience shows us that mathematical descriptions of nature etc. are models and have there limitations. Sometimes these descriptions can last thousands of years before they are shown to be inadequate.     Back to the paradox. The logic is faulty because it assumes that you can continue dividing distance again and again and again. Modern theories of physics tell us that this is not the case. There is such a thing as the smallest distance possible known as a Plank length. So the bullet is at one end of this Plank length and then it is at the other.    With the aforemention infomation in mind there is not enough information to conclusivly tell what state the light will be in at noon.|`|AA11635601	First rate question!  Bravo.    Each flip is either the last flip or it is not.  If it is not, then forget it.    If it is, then it cannot be because there is yet another flip coming.    Thus the switch cannot be resolved into either position and the question is unanswerable.|`|R5mmX9Woaa	yes, and you must be a pretty fast flipper.|`|Fa6yfvl4aa	I'd say off only because infinite light switches the light will blow. But if this is hypothetical with no limit to the physical capabilities of the switch, the light, and the switcher you'll never get to noon because there are infinite switches in there.|`|f3bb70dee35ef28e84fcc054691669dbaa	The switch would be open or closed. It's the light that is on or off.  The final outcome will never truly end just like there is not true end to the decimal equivalent of 1/3    If you like this kind of thinking you should look into fractals.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal|`|392a91e32207acc30c423125f639d22aaa	As we approach noon, cutting forever finer to the actual time, the light remains on.  This works much like the rectified AC current, switching at 60 Hz - or much much faster in this case.    The state of the light however is uncertain until the actual time when the person decides what he/she wants, on or off.
ZwECcnh1aa	I find myself longing for the simple life. That doesnt just include having a stress free life in the country. It also means being free from desire, competition, jealousy, drama and just about everything else that is a part of everyday life in todays world. I dont know if its possible. You have to learn to disconnect from society in many ways. To ignore the need for praise from co workers, the need to keep up with the Jones's. Lots of things people pursue without even realizing the deeper reason behind it.|`|iJR6qAV9aa	Your world is only as complicated as you make it.  Don't wish things better make them better.

Okay, I get what "simple" you are talking about now.     The capitalistic world you live in is not for you. It requires for you to eat, sleep, dream, and desire work and money. It makes you need shelter, television, computers, internet and so much more. If you want to enjoy these pleasures without effort, then the capitalistic society is not for you.     Perhaps communism?|`|T4CZbRsSaa	as simple as it can be as complex as it needs to be... take steps to simplify life... live humbly... be a ski bum, or a surf bum or some such for awhile.... after a time maybe just maybe we'll miss that more complex life...

Its a great book because it is very descriptive and it describes the locations excellently. All of the unbelievable technology described in this book is factual. This book is also action packed and extremely hard to put down. Its a bit of a tough read if you have a limited vocabulary or a lack of knowledge on Roman art and architecture.

Mig6O93Naa	Separate it by punctuation.  Full thoughts are finished at periods. Commas, semicolons and colons indicate there is more to the idea that was begun at the start of the sentence. Forget the way the lines are written and write them out as sentences in prose rather than as they are in verse.  It should help.
LO4Lf7zcaa	Read it in this order then  1. Sense and Sensiblity  2. Emma  3. Persuasion  4. Mansfield Park  5. Northanger Abbey  6. Pride and Predjudice|`|Bim31Zoaaa	I have read 4 out of the 7, and of the four, this is the order I liked them best (though I don't think I've read a book of hers I didn't like).    1. Pride and Prejudice (this is also my favorite book that I've ever read)    2. Sense and Sensibility    3. Emma (I have to admit this is maybe one of her books where I really didn't like the protagonist. For my own reasons, of course. Don't let this deter you from reading it or influence you into disliking Emma, too.)    4. Mansfield Park    I've been meaning to read her others: Persuasion (which I have a feeling is going to be my second favorite, displacing Sense and Sensibility), Northanger Abbey, and her unfinished Lady Susan.    Happy reading!|`|AA10992255	sense and sensibility|`|cpepmfD9aa	Pride and Prejudice|`|WqkFJ2Pgaa	I'd read the best one first, because Jane Austin's writing is kind of dense for us 21st century readers, and if you save the best for last, you might not get there!

It will get you hooked on Austen's novels and like someone else said, they are tough to get through so mind as well start with the best.

I guess I didn't like it that much.|`|uX09rPGlaa	I think Pride & Prejudice is the best, then Sense & Sensibility, Persuasion, Emma, Northanger Abbey and Mansfield Park.

If you can find clothes that look cute on you, then be satisfied. Wear baby doll or maternity shirts if your stomach or muffin top fat is too apparent. I gained 15 pounds and started wearing maternity baby doll shirts and i have been getting compliments of looking like i  have lost weight!!! i never leave the house without make up as well. That is not that bad of an  issue. its a preference. Do not be worried you will not get married. You have plenty of time. with marriage comes a lot of stress and unselfishness. Being 17, do not worry yet.

When you put marriage on a pedestal its bound to disappoint you.  Look around you.  Marriage isn't all that its cracked up to be I can assure you.  If it were there wouldn't be so many divorces.    As for being self-conscious, its normal at your age.  Its also a waste of time and worse, its holding you back.    Don't worry about what other people think of you.  Truth is, most people (especially teens) are so worried about themselves that they pay much less attention to you than you'd even guess.  Try spending more time trying to achieve something rather than trying to conform to what you guess other people expect of you.    One thing about make-up.  One of the messages it communicates is that the person wearing a lot of makeup needs a lot of makeup to cover their own insecurity.  Often as not, makeup makes a person less attractive for this very reason.    One thing about boys.  They will often pay particular attention to a made-up girl because  they see the make-up as insecurity, a weakness that they may be able to exploit for sex.  Its also a weakness that they will despise in you in the long run.|`|F5v5Qme0aa	You are a product of the warped views of our media today. You're obsessed because you want to look like the girl in the magazine... well guess what? Even they don't look like that!  They airbrush them to perfection - so you're chasing something that doesn't exist.      Now, once you get yourself to a place where you realize that we are not all a perfect size 1, decide on a healthy size for you and stay there. Notice I say SIZE not WEIGHT cuz our weight fluxuates naturally.      Stretchmarks can be removed naturally http://www.docshop.com/education/dermato... so if you excercise them regularly, there is no reason you can't have great legs.      I used to be like you and always had to have makeup on to feel "pretty".  But I realized that makeup really only makes us look "made up"... it can't make us prettier. I slowly started eliminating products; first foundation, then no more eyeshadow, eventaully I even stopped using mascara (I couldn't leave the house without mascara!).  Even though I work in a law office and have to look polished and professional. today my morning makeup is blush and a litte lip gloss. When I want to "step it up" I do my full makeup and get lots of "ahh's" from my co-workers... it's cool!    As far as getting married, that is completely up to you.  We attract the things we give our energy to, so if that is what you dwell on every day, you are sure to create that reality for yourself.  Of course, you could just as easily create the opposite, that's called the "law of attraction"  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_b1GKGWJb...   :-D
SMrSII2eaa	When I clicked on the link, it only gave me the prologue. But, I wouldn't suggest "I'm not a girl, not yet a woman" only because that's a name of a song. By Brittany Spears. Haha. But, from the Prologue I gathered that there is a girl out in the rain searching for her... lost mother and maybe she's going to have to take care of the siblings? That's what I gather from your chosen title and the Prologue. Maybe something like...   "So.Be.It." Showing she's going to have to endure the situation.  "Rain on me." A simile and because she's actually standing in the rain.  "Pretty Lady" Idk why That just came to mind haha  "Tap tap tap" As in the rain falling.   Give me the plot of the story and maybe I can help you.  Good Prologue by the way :)  EDIT- Oh I see now. Lol. I think it's very good but I only skimmed through it. I love your details.  Maybe,   "So. Be. It."  "Endurance"  "Through the painted on face"  EDIT- If you have a scene in the book that you really like, such as "Why do you care?" or "he loves me" you could always put the title as..  "Why?"  "Care"  "Why do you care?"  "Loves me"  Something like that.  Hope your story turns out good- Who knows we just might see it on the shelf at Barnes and Nobels ;)  MAdison
AA10729675	I believe it was Mr. John H.  Fahey, Chairman of the HOLC at its very beginning.  I googled it, and so can you!  But I am no sure yet.
AA10729675	It is Bonaparte, not Bonepart.    And it is better for you to google it.  There is too much to say about Napoleon.  And it is enough with the British denigrating him.  He was a great man.  It is discrimination to mock him because he was small physically.  And it is stupid.    Of course he was patriotic, he made France a super-power at the time.  He made it rich again.  He encourage people from the crowd to become rich.  He was the saviour of France, that's for sure, and that made the British fearful, and jealous.
162603d72ddcf3279ac7690bc9b8ba0daa	In Doctor Away your flash is too bright, and it appears to have been shot on auto.  Using a longer shutter speed would have given you more background detail.  Dialing back the flash compensation would make the lighting less harsh and make the subject more in keeping with the feeling of the image.    Bones was my favorite.  Lovely tree with a great shape, although the composition is centered and the light was less than ideal.  On uniformly overcast days, with the light grey or featureless white sky, you might plan to either convert to B&W or compose your shots not to include much sky.  I think the tree would look better as B&W.    Overcast light is great for macros and portraits, though.    There are many on-line resources for photographers who want to learn more.  You might visit your local bookstore or library for books on basic photography and also areas of special interest to you.  Evidently you like portraiture.  Bryan Peterson has a great book on portraits as well as "Understanding Exposure", which should be on every photographer's shelf.  Keep learning and shooting and best wishes!|`|5b82f419fb3ca3c7a38de9e85c94b189aa	I liked of photos...are greats...

So there is no bad photography in the world of art, unless you can see the wires or something, ha ha. Just look for different ways to see things. A flower looks nice, but if you change the lighting, angle, contrast or distance, then you are making the most of what you see and what your viewers see. Same with structures, people, landscape. Exercise some versatility and have an imagination, fame will come. Your photography is good, always look for something in everything and you will be amazed at what you see.|`|E855dvZdaa	WOW they are really good already.    Remember to carefully look at your composition. A photo can be divided into 6 rectangle pieces. Where the lines cross can be your focus points, that is the most basic focus points for composition. In "Throwing snowballs at me" the composition seems a little weird, although the core photo is good. Remember the exact focus point is usually not in the middle. Look at photo's in magazines like the Times to see how professionals position stuff.    I love that all your photo's has personality You have talent!!|`|GNGzJ1pAaa	You had me intrigued.

Ue9CVPU1aa	There is no true answers...    What is the Differant between Good or Evil... u don't even know...    If there r thiefs in the world u know why they exist... ( it depends on their circumstance) their hunger...They will grind ur bone to make their bread...    u know why their r generous people, they have been through tough times and decide they will do good deeds in the world...  (basically religion)    Religion teaches u the purity of Good and Evil...    and it teaches u how to be enlightneed... and god's true follower...    Sometimes we can't even tell the difference between Evil or Good...    Because we r differant in the morning and differeant in the evening... We can't make up our mind... ( We live in an illusion, in which everything is artifical... like beauty at one point of time it just worn out...  Like if we r evil then we convert and turn to our Good selves...    So basically this is a concept of existance in which we are judgemental...)|`|U4V6TkZEaa	Some of both.        Please pull my finger. Some evil needs to be let out.|`|WhUV9k6Jaa	Both and neither.  Humans are selfish.  When your interests are in accord with the selfish desires of others you label them good.  When their interests contradict yours you call them evil.  It's all relative.|`|k1W70RHFaa	Good and evil are simply abstract concepts held in the human mind; they don't really exist.    Humans seek good, whether for themselves or for others almost always.      Thieves steal because it is good for them. Firefighers put out fires because its good for society.    No one does things because they're "bad" in their viewpoint.|`|cxVmq2kraa	Neither nor one of each other.  Humans are just around us.  We do what we think we want and ignore that something else is influencing that. I am not preaching anything about religion but I do believe that humans are only the smaller out come of something that is more knowledgeable and swift then us.  We must learn to respect everything, for better or for worse.|`|I6D7xdcVaa	Neither for they are non existent.

I don't think it's a simple either/or question.|`|vYyIpxo9aa	Humans are born good, and innocent but human nature catches up with them.|`|T5p5EBIhaa	humans are good look at it this way there are people who think your bad or hate you but there are people who love you alot so some people are bad for some people and some people are good for some people did this help ?|`|d1VNbI4paa	According to the ancient Chinese philosophy of Legalism, yes, we are all evil by nature. Followers of Legalism believe that strict punishments and rules need to be applied, or else society would tear itself apart. But I personally believe that we are good by nature, though we are inclined to do bad things because they are often in our immediate best interest. When somebody hits you, yo automatically want to hit them back. Getting even, right? But then why guilt after you do something bad? Usually, after we do something considered shameful, we always get this feeling of regret. That leads me to believe that deep down, we do know what's right, and when we do the opposite, we get this terrible feeling. So, maybe it's not as cut and dry as your making it. We're some good, and some evil.    Hope that helped. : )|`|lcXBO7Smaa	I'd say naturally evil, as everything we do in life is to please ourselves(think about it) Things that we do good usually either don't inconvenience us, or simply benefit someone else at the same time. However, I do believe there are many charitable people who simply are so just because it helps them feel better about what thev've done in life, which can be considered selfish. There are many people who do good not out of need of moral or physical gain, but those people are most likely in the vast minority.|`|2Ko12Elfaa	I don't know.  If you were invisible, would you do things that are good, or would you do things that are evil?  And even then... why?
amcqJkWhaa	My friend says her sister is really great at art, but she often crumbles up her art and throws it in the trash... so, my friend, she often takes it out of the trash and keeps it. ^^    Even if you throw away your art, it's not the end of your art. It is still practice. And, you might even take it from the trash bin again, should you want to. Don't beat yourself up over it.     I'm guessing that you're under some emotional pressure, so, ah, well I guess you want to find some relief, right? Make some effort to word things around differently, or think about pleasant things, in order to give yourself some relief and stuff. Some relief... emotionally. More to do with feeling good than right or wrong, because some things are more about opinion than fact...|`|f49baYxqaa	happens to me all the time. i don't throw my art away though i just decide no to finish it. i don't know if it's that i get bored of the same piece or that i'm a perfectionist like everyone says. people tell me that i'm a great artist and i've even won some contests but it still happens a lot...i'm still trying to fix this problem(kindda hard though)|`|50ec31d764bf5a50cfcd956d3a93d955aa	It's called perfectionism. You're just a perfectionist. There's nothing wrong with that. It's what puts people to the top of their field.|`|v9iwbbCmaa	Most artists are perfectionists and wrestle  with their own picky "inner critics"! But they LEARN to use that critical insight for improving. They also learn to make the critic SHUT UP, at least sometimes. DO NOT THROW YOUR WORK AWAY just because your own critic says so.   Maybe put it aside and look at it in a few days.  Good luck with learning to live with Critic.  Maybe give him/her a name. Acknowledge the good points your critic makes, ignore the total put-downs. Talk with other artists about this. You will find that you are not alone with your inner critic. We all learn to live with our own unwelcome friend.  Pat S.

ULitp0PWaa	Its not all being flexible. That's only one half of it. Yes, you must make sure you can put your nose between your legs when you are doing a pike on the ground and make sure you can lay down when in your straddle on the ground. Make sure you point your toes even when you are stretching (muscle memory. The more you stretch with your toes pointed, the more likely you are to point your toes when you are actually jumping).     The other half of having good jumps is... well... conditioning =). I know, I know, nobody likes it, but you know what they say "no pain, no gain". One thing you can do to get your toe touches higher is to     1) Sit in a straddle  2) Place your right hand behind your right leg and your left hand in front of your right leg (like you are about down to your right leg)  3) Without leaning back, lift your legs off of the ground and make little circles in the air with your feet. Do five first, then four, then three etc    I must warn you, it hurts a lot. Do that everyday and that should make your jumps higher.    Another thing you can do is take two washcloths and set them side by side on a hardwood floor (or tile or anything like that) and put your feet on them. Try to separate and snap your legs together while sliding the washcloths with your feet (you will need to hold onto something). This hurts a lot! But it helps =)    For your pikes, you will need to work your core. Its all based on your abs there. Lots of sit-ups, crunches etc to help you out. Eventually you will have very nice jumps, but you have to stay consistant.  Good Luck =)    ?|`|4scMHGGvaa	Your splits are what you need to work on. Also lunges are really good to do. The more you stretch the easier it will become.|`|VSCYTZ38aa	You can stretch for the jump by sitting on the floor with your legs strait out in front of you and touching your toes. And a good way to practice any jump is have a friend stand behind you with their hands on your waist and help you jump so you can have more stability while you try to get your legs right.|`|HeAFlwFeaa	for a pike put your legs out in front of you together and lean foward to stretch|`|RC2aQBkgaa	Well for a pike try to practice on a trampoline so you can get higher when you jump on ground and the feel of getting high. But what really helped me with toe touches especially was stand on one leg and bring the other leg up to your side as far as you can and for as long as you can. Another great remedy is sit down and get in a stradel. Then lift yourself up with your hands in front of your crotch, and move you toes in circles. It will make you a lot stronger.|`|iJR6qAV9aa	Its not really that difficult i was a gymnast for   half my life and... i can do some pretty amazing  things not to brag. I could do a pick when i was 8  years old ;P Haha ...you just need to be more  flexible try doing splits hold them down for like 2  minutes do it every day. You can try jumping in  place...uhm other ideas would be a trampoline  if you have one or now a way you can get onto one.  Also you can go off the diving board and try doing  pikes until you get better. Taking gymnastic  classes is always a good idea. For this. Try touching  your toes while standing up and sitting down  as you are in a pike position just hold for 20 seconds  or so...i wish you luck|`|wZNMlmglaa	you can do slpits alot or strech your legs|`|zQsFvgUHaa	yes there is a way..  sit down and put your feet out in front of you  but put them together..  grab the balls of your feet and pull.  have someone sit on you.it will hurt but it will help.    and a toe touch usually middle split helps..  but also sit in a straddle and go down toward the middle.  until your nose touches the floor     and another would be to wear weights around your ankles  while conditioning your jump. that way after you take the weights  off your feet will feel light. and you'll jump higher and it will be easier    hope this helps=D  if you need anything else about cheer   message me at cglash91@yahoo.com  because i know all about cheer leading

The book begins with the wry and surprising "Mortals," in which a journalist is fired for writing the obituary of a man who proves to be very much alive. Other strong stories include "Flyboys," about an uneasy trio of youthful friends, and "The Chain," in which a man's desire for revenge after his daughter is attacked by a dog begets a cycle of violence with unforeseen consequences

Soap and water cleans acrylic. Turpentine cleans oil paint.   ps: DON'T let acrylic paint dry on clothes you like.  pps: Too lazy to clean brushes now?

k8AcVixTaa	You will need:    Developing trays for paper, developing tanks to develop film, a good timer, tongs, funnels, misc storage bottles, film developing reels for the size of negatives you plan to shoot, photo paper, contrast filters, safelights, a big tub to put the wet prints into while washing them, something to hang them from when drying, a paper easel for under the enlarger, a paper cutter marked so you can see it easily under a safelight, a darkroom thermometer.    These are the basic items needed.  I am sure I am leaving something out.  Brand names aren't necessary.  Any of these items are made by generic companies.  A good Graylab or Durst timer would be good.  You use it to time film develop as well as timing exposure of the photo paper and turns on and off you safelight as well.      Ilford makes the better polycontrast filters for multigrade papers.  If you have purchased an enlarger with a color head then you don't need them as you will be able to dial in the color needed.    Film development tanks - I have always liked the plastic Petersen Tanks.  I never got the hang of the stainless steel reels and always managed to kink my film with those.      Glad to see someone asking an intelligent question here.  Feel free to email me if you have other darkroom questions.|`|Efd1G2loaa	Question: What format are you using? Color or black and white? I ask this because the larger the format, you will need different equipment than you would for say, 35mm film; this goes for if you're developing color or black and white. Regardless, all you need to get started are some basic tools and equipment. I will just fill you in on black and white, though.    To get started, you will need a developing tank. If you use 35mm or 120/220 film, you can use reels. If you're using 4x5" or larger, you'll need a tank or trays. To dry the film, you'll need film clips to allow the negatives to dry. As far as chemicals go, you'll need a developer, fixer, and photo flo, as well as a water stop bath and a readily available source of clean water; like a sink.     When printing, you'll need a few more things. You already have an enlarger, and hopefully, it has a lens. You'll also need a timer, a safelight, an easel, enlarging paper, and developing trays. As far as chemicals are concerned, you'll need another developer and fixer, as well as a source of water. You can use the same fixer as you use with the developing process, but you'll need a different developer.

hQ95u9OLaa	It is, as I read in a Newsweek article, years ago, one of the great questions of Western literature. I believe that Adela was certainly not raped, that she was overcome by the mystery that is India. To a White, who does not belong there, India is a dangerous beast. And the innocent Adela finds that she cannot comprehend it. Mr Fielding and Dr Aziz are representative of Western and Indian culture respectively and at the end when they renew their tentative friendship we are to see that as a sign that there may yet be hope for white and dark to respect each other.
GLS7vgAdaa	Whoa! Slow down and breathe!! Everything will be just fine. I'm sure you're not the first beginner dancer to have been placed into these Intermediate classes. Have faith that the school probably knows what they're doing, even if you don't.     I'm going to break these 3 styles down for you as best and as simply as i can. this is not to scare you, just to inform u so you're not completely clueless on your first day. By the way, from my experience, Intermediate often times does mean "beginner" but the pace in which you learn is a little more progressive.     Ballet: The number one thing i'm sure you'll be learning is the different ballet positions...1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th...That means the different basic ways of standing, either doing warm-up excercises or learning steps and combinations. You'll then learn the different barre excercises. That's that big pipe-looking thing attached to the back wall. These exercises help you warm up slowly and safely while you're working on flexibility and control. Pay attention to these exercises. They help greatly no matter what kind of dance you're doing.     Modern: Modern is a pretty free style that focuses on self-expression and interpretation. I'm sorry, I've never really liked modern and haven't studied it greatly but you might be taught things like counter weight and balance where you'll work with a partner. Don't worry, I'm sure there are going to be plenty of people in your class who are as clueless as you about this. Either you love modern or you just don't.    Tap: My favorite! You'll start by warming up and strengthening your ankles which is key to being a good tap dancer. The basic steps that everyone learns in the first couple of weeks are "shuffles, falaps, ball changes." This might sound intimidating to you but please don't let it! I have no doubt in my mind that you've probably done all three of these things in everyday life without even realizing it. That's the cool thing about tap. You'll catch yourself making sounds with your feet one day outside of class and then it occurs to you that you've been tap dancing your whole life!     Above all, I want you to go into these classes with an open mind. Trust that the teachers put you there for a good reason and just let go and HAVE FUN!!!!|`|3Y9hsHunaa	Wow that's great! Dance is so much fun, I'm sure you'll love it!      Let's start with ballet. It's all about precise movement, grace, and balence. You'll warm up on the barre (the bar things along the walls). For almost EVERYTHING in ballet you will need to know the 5 ballet positions. An easy way to learn them before class is from the link below. Also on barre, a mistake that most beginners make is when they do plies (bending both of your legs from any of the positions) they stick their bottoms out very far. What you'll want to imagine is sliding your back down a wall while tucking your buns under. After barre you will most likely do combinations and accross the floors.     Next is modern. Modern is a very different type of dance. You will probably be barefoot. A big part of modern is balence. The movement in modern is different for each teacher but it always reminds me of yoga.     Time for tap! Tap always remember: Tap = Rhythm. Whatever you do in tap will always be to produce a specific sound. Tap may be confusing at first, but once you get it, it will be cake.      So relax! Take a deep breath, point your toes, and most importantly: have fun! I hope this helps and I wish you the best of luck!
fVT5gbwNaa	I actually just finished Peak and I loved it! Unfortunately, as far as I know, there is no movie. The book just recently came out, it's not possible that a movie of it could have already come out.

g8kIjpwSaa	You've got your tolerances backwards. If you, for example, use the paint bucket to fill a white background (say...around the outline of a person), your going to fill whatever color the pixel is that you first click. If you click a pure white area it wont fill to the edge of your person because at the edge the pure white starts getting dark. Your "tolerance" lets you tell photoshop how much you want it to tolerate any pixels that are outside that area of pure white. The higher the tolerance, the more it will start to fill in areas that aren't as light as you originally clicked.    Now that I have that out of the way, let me say that the paint bucket is worthless. It's a tool that hung around from the old old versions of photoshop. There are a ton of more efficient and accurate ways to fill a picture depending on what you're trying to accomplish. If I had a little more information I might be able to give you more. Sorry....but good luck :)|`|peFtORvUaa	zero tolerance=no tolerence|`|SALWkdUvaa	The pain bucket will stop filling when the color you've selected to fill has changes.     As you mentioned, increasing the tolerance controls that. If fiddling with that doesn't do what you want, first select the magic wand tool ("w") and click the same way as if you wanted to fill the area. It will select a certain area, then holding "****" you can click on more places close to the border of what you had already selected until the expansion reached the place you wanted. When you are satisfied with how much you have selected (the area to be painted over) you can select the color you would have used to fill in with the pain bucket and press Alt+Backspace to fill the selected area with that color.    Alternatively, just fill as much with the pain bucket as you can and then switch to a brush and fill in the rest manually.

C77c0OE2aa	Like many others I jumped on the digital bandwagon a few years ago and basically put away film for a long while. I had a VERY large investment in a Canon 1Ds and several L lenses. Know what I did in 2007? SOLD IT ALL!!!, and I don't regret it a bit. I still have my old Canon D60 digital SLR for when I really need the convenience, but the money I got from all the 1Ds and lenses payed for a beautiful, like new Mamiya medium format camera with 3 fantastic prime lenses. Almost overnight, the joy and art of photography came back to me. Like you, I was sick to death of feeling like nothing more than a moronic participant in an electronic video game instead of a PHOTOGRAPHER.     My only suggestion to you is that if you are using 35mm film, make the step up to medium or large format. The Mamiya 645 AF handles and performs much like a 35mm SLR. Another great camera is the Pentax 645N. The Mamiya 7II will give you the even larger 6 x 7 cm size negative in the relatively compact rangefinder body. Then of course there is the terrific Mamiya RB and RZ models, the Hasselblads, Bronicas, etc., but they are larger and bulky.     Film is NOT dead, and will not be for a long, long time to come, if ever. I see film becoming a niche market for the "art" crowd. I can fully understand the need and advantages of digital for commercial purposes, but, to me, film is like steak compared to a digital McDonald's hamburger.    steve|`|MG6TyR4Uaa	Then go back to film. If you still love it, shoot it. The industry is moving to digital and certain kinds of film are becoming harder and harder to come by but you can still get some.     I myself prefer shooting digital as opposed to my old SLR. Yes it's a different look and yes it take some getting used to. But I prefer it.     Shoot what you like. Just be prepared to have a few stumbling blocks set in front of you as far as technology and film availability is concerned.|`|Efd1G2loaa	I'm not sick of digital photography. That is, I don't hate it or anything; just more so this digital mentality it has sprung up. But, I did get tired of using it. I got tired of using digital because I did not like the look* of shooting with slide film all the time. I did not like the  easily blown highlights and short latitude of the medium. That's why I use a 4x5" camera for all of my photography nowadays.There are many others like you. If you prefer the quality of the 35mm, stick with that. Despite what some believe, film is readily available; especially if you go to the larger photo stores, like B&H Photo.|`|3mAgM405aa	I agree with you wholeheartedly that film is the ultimate commercial way to go since most major publications such as National Geographics still require color slide submissions and any prints larger than A6 must be from film.    Good luck!|`|KNN4a8uYaa	I'm all film.  I've set up a darkroom in the basement.  To me, especially when it comes to black and white, the darkroom is far more enjoyable.  There's something about seeing something you've labored over throughout composing, exposing, developing, and printing slowly show up in the developer bath that is about as close to magic that I've ever experienced.    Is that feeling of accomplishment that keeps me coming back to film, and will likely keep me coming back again and again.  The textures in the paper look like you can feel them, ya know?    Digital has its place, of course, but for my money, film is my friend.

Mccandless' desire to be closer to nature and escape from our materialistic society are something we can all learn from.

If he likes Sci-Fi stuff, I've heard that "Journey to the Center of the Earth" is a great book. In fact, a guy friend of mine who professes to hate reading loves this book. It's the only one he'll read for fun.    You can also try some Stephen King ("It," "The Green Mile") if he's generally into horror, some Chuck Palahniuk ("Fight Club") if he likes action and philosophy, and maybe even some Dan Brown ("The DaVinci Code," "Angels and Demons") if he likes history and/or religion.

Just choose either TV (Shutter Priority) or Manual Mode and use the command dial (L or R) to raise or lower the shutter speed.    Obviously, you should be using a tripod.|`|VMVW3E7Aaa	Sounds like you would really benefit from attending a class and reading a few books on photography.    I checked the specs on your camera, and yes, you have both manual and TV mode, both of which would be useful in this case.    You have a maximum shutter speed of 15 seconds, which will be plenty enough for the light trail shots.    Set it to a long shutter speed, make sure to use a tripod and experiment some more. Those shots are actually quite easy to do, and without an example, it is impossible to know where you're going wrong.
1404d9070bb3e8dbdfa989926c402b0eaa	"The Broken Blade" by William Durbin  [Pierre is the French Canadian boy]  http://www.amazon.com/Broken-Blade-Willi...  "Grade 5-8. Pierre, 13, is the son of a voyager, one of the French-Canadian canoemen who plied the fur trade in Canada during the last two centuries. When his father severely injures himself in a wood-chopping accident, Pierre signs on with his father's company in order to keep the family from poverty. The bulk of the novel is structured around the boy's first canoe trip to the wilderness outpost of Grand Portage. Along the way, he faces many challenges and has great adventures. He grows in physical strength and matures both mentally and spiritually. In short, he becomes a man. The combination of historical fiction set in 1800 with a coming-of-age tale works well here. Pierre's companions on his journey are a rowdy, disreputable lot, but they pull together when they must. There is the requisite bully whose respect Pierre must earn and a good-natured boss who has faith in him. The drowning of one of the boatmen sobers the crew and brings home to Pierre the very real dangers they face. The work is grueling and the food monotonous, but the men enjoy a rough camaraderie and savor the natural beauty that surrounds them."|`|23e3dea617bdd51768967a227fc656a1aa	The only thing that came to mind were Tom Sawyer or Huckleberry Finn.

AA11918249	Hello:<br>  <br>  Postmodernism is the merging/simultaneous acceptance of multiple ideas/philosophies...in architecture for example or people who are Mormon also believing in Hindu religions ideas.  This covers metaphysics.  <br>  <br>  Physics is sort of a universal language that transcends beliefs in that it uses math and observation to measure the world around us.  Really the only way I can think of someone thinking physics is relative and that say angels move the planets in the heavens is an equally valid notion of reality...which is kinda crazy.  <br>  <br>  Relativity is another way of saying perspective...if you are next to an object it will look different than if you are looking at it from 50 meters away and several meters above it.  <br>  <br>  I hope this helps<br>  <br>  Rev Phil

BDeNFIddaa	Well basically she's famous for writing this semi auto-biography novel,  The Bell Jar, about an intelligent woman who has a break down. And the same year she commited suicide herself.     Her poems were also mainly confessional (which is mainly why she's given so much credit) and she gave descriptions of mental illness, like in "Ariel", "Tulips" and "Daddy". She also wrote a load of journals which were published after her death. She married a guy called Ted Hughes who published a load of her work after she died.|`|a5DreRfOaa	Sylvia Plath was a famous American poet--here's an article on her from St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture. Good luck with your research. Her writing is dark...Amy        Also known as: Victoria Lucas, Sylvia Plath Hughes      Birth: 1932   Death: 1963   Source: St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture. 5 vols. St. James Press, 2000.   Updated: 11/02/2006       TABLE OF CONTENTS  Biographical Essay  Further Readings  Source Citation  Updates      BIOGRAPHICAL ESSAY  Author Sylvia Plath's association with death and madness stemmed from her confessional poetry, her novel The Bell Jar, and the facts of her life, but most of all from the cult of readers--many of them teenage girls--that formed after her suicide. Plath's stormy marriage to poet Ted Hughes was a matter for the literary tabloids, and her work was taken up by scholars as evidence of a troubled soul oppressed by sexist times. Her poems--most particularly those published posthumously in Ariel--are an enduring proof of her very real talent.    Plath was born in Boston, Massachusetts, on October 27, 1932. Her father, a college professor and expert on bees, died when she was eight. She was a good student, and published her first short story in the magazine Seventeen when she was just a teenager.    In 1950, Plath entered Smith College on a scholarship. She already had an impressive list of publications, and while at Smith she wrote over four hundred poems. She spent some time in New York as a "guest editor" at Mademoiselle; when she returned home, she attempted suicide by swallowing sleeping pills. Afterward, she received electroshock and psychotherapy in a mental hospital. (Plath used much of this experience for her autobiographical novel The Bell Jar, published pseudonymously in England in 1963 under the name Victoria Lucas. Plath's mother, Aurelia, fought against American publication; the book was not published in the United States until 1970.)    Plath graduated from Smith in 1955 and won a Fulbright scholarship to study at Cambridge, England, where she met poet Ted Hughes. The story of their tempestuous first meeting is now mythic in literary circles: he stole her hair band; she bit his cheek. They were married in 1956.    In June of 1957, Plath attended Robert Lowell's poetry class at Boston University, where she met the poet Anne Sexton; the three of them would later be considered the foci of the intensely personal "confessional school" of poetry. In 1959, Plath and Hughes moved to England. The following year, when she was 28, her first book of poetry, The Colossus and Other Poems, was published.    Plath and Hughes separated later that year, when Hughes left Plath for another woman. Plath spent that winter with their two children, Frieda and Nicholas, in a small London flat, waking up at four a.m. in order to write before the children arose. This was a very productive period for her; she wrote almost a poem a day. On February 11, 1963, just days after the publication of The Bell Jar, Plath killed herself with kitchen gas.    Ted Hughes became Plath's literary executor. He brought her collection of poetry, Ariel, to publication in 1965. Among the "scorching" poems in Ariel is Plath's most famous poem, "Daddy," along with "Death and Co." and "Lady Lazarus" ("Dying / Is an art, like everything else. / I do it exceptionally well. // I do it so it feels like hell. / I do it so it feels real. / I guess you could say I've a call"). Other posthumous publications included Crossing the Water, Winter Trees, and, in 1981, The Collected Poems, edited by Hughes, which won the Pulitzer Prize for poetry.    For feminist scholars, Plath was a talented, brilliant woman done wrong by men and the times. If she had lived in a later era, they ask, would her story have unfolded the same way? Was she a victim of the 1950s ideal of woman as housewife and mother, wedged into a domestic role inappropriate for someone with her skills? Anne Sexton and Sylvia Plath are usually mentioned in the same literary breath--both were women, confessional poets, and suicides; Sexton's poem "Sylvia's Death" discusses their mutual preoccupation with the subjects of death and desire.    After her death, Plath achieved iconic status as a "madwoman" poet. For some cultural critics, she was the epitome of the silenced woman. Hughes had total control over her literary estate, and may have exerted that control to protect his own image; he destroyed at least one journal and censored many other pieces. Many Plath fans had a deep hatred for Hughes, and called him a betrayer, even a murderer. Although her gravestone was inscribed "Sylvia Plath Hughes," it has been repeatedly defaced to read just "Sylvia Plath."    Years after her death, Plath remained a literary presence. In 1996, About Sylvia: Poems was published, containing works by Diane Ackerman, John Berryman, Rachel Hadas, Robert Lowell, Anne Sexton, and Richard Wilbur. Ted Hughes, British poet laureate, broke his silence on Plath soo

adb664d56b3f4661b9ab411cf1e96218aa	I bought a 4.5-octave marimba on ebay for $800 just before Christmas.  It's a practice marimba, so it's not on wheels and the resonators are made of heavy-duty cardboard.  But the bars are rosewood and the exact size of a real marimba.      The seller is "stg68".  They are hand crafted marimbas that he sells brand new on ebay.  We are very pleased with ours.  It's working perfectly for my daughter to practice on at home.    I know, a marimba is not the same as a xylophone.  Xylophones have bars that are all the same width.  Marimbas have varying widths.  But it's a place to start looking.    There are places to rent them, but they're hard to come by even there.  We were put on a waiting list.  And the rent is about $65/month. So, I searched high and low for one.   This seller on ebay is offering the best deal around.    I hope that helps.|`|7VpDEkC6aa	You are freaking dreaming!!  4 octave xylophones cost over 4 grand.

HP even has more universal appeal, reaching millions from all walks of life.  The majority of Twilight fans are girls, usually younger ones who live vicariously through Bella.  Twilight is just your every day forbidden love story that's been glammed up with vampires and werewolves.  Harry Potter explores the love that exists not only between a man and a woman, but between friends, a mother and her child, a godfather and his godson.     And it's pretty immature to hate on others just because they prefer one series over another.  How old are you guys, twelve?  Oh wait, you probably are.  My bad.|`|dSFZHrLJaa	Definitely Twilight. Harry Potter is OK I guess, but it has too much "I am friendless" and "everyone knows my name" and "I hate being me!".   Its just not my thing.

(i guess you couldn't really fit the whole thing though.)  twists and turns are what make books good.  make sure the plot is really interesting.  good luck!|`|Fex51ntIaa	Got anything shorter?|`|yZRcdzcAaa	that sounds very cool, and very intense, but i have 2 things    becareful with names being too similar, or too complicated. for example, Jack and Jimmy are close and it might confuse readers sometimes trying to remember who's who.    also, try not to dwell too much on Jack and Rhea in hiding. you have a great plot and a great world, but make sure you stay in that world instead of in their personal life, which might get boring (i know i personally wouldn't like that as much)    anyways, good luck! hope it goes well

FoMwdqJVaa	In which country?  In England they were called either 'Royal Trumpeter' or 'Royal Court Trumpeter.'   In Italy they were called Heralds and Royal Court Trumpeters.    For those who study and re-enact the English Renaissance, a Herald is not a Trumpeter.  Heralds are members of the College of Arms who are responsible for genealogical research to establish rights to patents of nobility, and maintain the official records of the grants of Coats of Arms. A detailed account of English Heralds can be found here.    In Italy it was very different.  In addition to their functions in sounding fanfares for ceremonial purposes, they acted as heralds, announcing public ceremonies, making official proclamations, and announcing jousts.  Italian court trumpeters acted as negotiators for the release of prisoners of war or political prisoners as they were regarded as officials of the royal court.  In legal documents they were referred to as Heralds.  It is probably from this historical fact that today; many regard all renaissance trumpeters as heralds.    In order to be a trumpeter, you had to come from a well-to-do family where an education could be provided. But using the term musician with respect to a trumpeter in the Elizabethan period is not really fashionable. The trumpet was just starting to be accepted as a musical instrument. The trumpet was originally just a "noise maker" used to arouse fear and get the rapid attention of the public. A group of out of tune trumpets, blowing simultaneously would definitely get the attention of the enemy and could turn the tide in a battle. A single trumpet was a signalling device. Also, it is during this period that trumpets are being manufactured to closer tolerances between individual instruments. They were now in tune with each other. In the period we portray, the trumpet has evolved more into a musical instrument because they are manufactured to a musical standard, to ensure harmonious compatibility with other musical instruments of the   period.
p5wkOii3aa	Media would be whatever material you used to create your piece. If it was a painting, you could put acrylic on canvas, for example.    Since you are a photographer, you could provide some details such as type of film, exposure, etc.    Size is self explanatory.    Running theme would apply to your whole portfolio. If the photograph fits with any themes you may have in your portfolio, put a single word or short phrase to explain. Just be sure you are consistent, so if another piece follows the theme you use the same word or phrase. I would put both the size and running them if both apply.

Z3vKuGQLaa	Well depending on what type of dance you like you can always meet people. I'm into hip hop dancing and also like to learn on my own. So I started going to breakdance competition and meeting new people and became close friends with a few people and they have free practice spots. So I would just go practice with my friends crew who let's everybody do their own thing but if you see something you want to learn they will help you out. Now I go to my b/f martial arts studio but it was fun for the time but wanted a place closer but still practice with them every now and then. Another suggestion is going to a gym and practice in the aerobics room inbetween classes I also did that for awhile.|`|7dtuvfcnaa	try downloading  hip hop dance  routine routines off the internet.  that way you dont have to worry about class and you can learn on your own.  just go to   http://chopperdanceblog.com/choppers-dan...|`|4scMHGGvaa	Not one dance school will let you do what you want.  If you want to coreograph something on your own ask for a solo and pick your own song and find a time slot to make it up on your own.

fWq4GcnSaa	That's fine if you don't like the storyline, but you don't need to rant. Although I know you clarified that you did include questions...So here are my answers : )     "1. Why is James Patterson devoting a book of a great series to Global Warming?"  >Well... Because he wants to?? Because global warming is an important issue that not many people, especiallly kids Max's age, whom the series is geared towards, are aware of. Why would Stephenie Meyer write about a sparkling vampire?    " Its just the most idiotic thing I could possibly think of to continue the series. To me, it just seems that he's trying to push his political viewpoint on to his readers."  >Well, that's fine, if that's your opinion. But climate change and global warming are not 'political viewpoints,' they are proven facts. Honestly, nothing negative can come of a book series that might teach kids to respect the earth a little more.    "2. Are the future Maximum Ride books going to be about all this stupid "saving the planet captain green" stuff? Because if it is, I'm out."   >Yes, I have heard that MR will be a 12 part series. I am sure at least some of the future books will deal with the subject of global warming. If you're "out," well, that's your decision. James Patterson earned $50 million from June 2007 to June 2008 alone; I don't think your allegiance will really matter all that much.    "3. WHY exactly is James Patterson creating books about mankind's destruction of the world?"  >I think you already asked that question... Again, why not? It's an important, real- life issue. Why did JK Rowling write about a boy who travels to a magical castle to live with wizards? Those books have sold more than 400 million copies. And there are plenty of other books that deal with "mankind's destruction of the world" that have been hugely successful and influential.    I can understand if you don't like the new direction the stories have taken, but I find it admirable that Patterson uses his fame to educate young readers in a fun and action-filled way about global warming. That's not about 'political viewpoints,' but about, as you so succinctly put, all that "stupid saving the planet captain green stuff." It's great that Patterson might be sacrificing some readers such as yourself (and therefore some money) who refuse to believe in global warming in favor of educating a few about the dangers of climate change.     Short answer....If you don't like the books, no one is forcing you to read them. Feel free to stop at any time.|`|Tx8JHmDvaa	i feel exactly the same. i read the fourth book and i was disappointed. i was hoping for something explosive and amazing but nope, global warming.    1. i think he did it to inform the reader that the threat is there. i feel its kind of stupid because global warming has nothing to do with the rest of the series. i think he was pushing his view onto the reader.    2.yes, its about global stinking warming. i think the books have turned eco-friendly. what happened to the mad scientist stuff? i was really looking forward to that. Patterson totally ruined the books!!!! i was hoping for something AMAZING but nope, global warming.     3. I think it has something to do with the apocalypse. just kidding, i don;t really know.|`|vYAgIMLdaa	Thanks for your opinion. Google James Patterson and you will get links to his publisher where you can rant all you want to him directly.  Maybe not everyone shares your ideas. Other than a rant, what is the purpose here? It would have been shorter (for us) and faster (for you) had you just looked it up yourself instead of venting.
sQsl1r5Yaa	The definition of a pilgrim is someone who journeys to a distant land.  The Puritans were Christians who wanted to worship according to their beliefs but the government in England often dragged them to jail for their religious practices.  Thus, they sought to go to America to be free to worship without fear of jail.  Those on the Mayflower were Puritan pilgrims.     noun 1. a person who journeys, esp. a long distance, to some sacred place as an act of religious devotion: pilgrims to the Holy Land.    2. a traveler or wanderer, esp. in a foreign place.   3. an original settler in a region.   4. (initial capital letter) one of the band of Puritans who founded the colony of Plymouth, Mass., in 1620.   5. a newcomer to a region or place, esp. to the western U.S.|`|W2YtVUqKaa	...they can be the same puritan is just a religious sect and pilgrim is just a type of people.     you know you can say like a black christian  or a  puritan pilgrim|`|G0XIQespaa	Thats a good question. Puritan is actually a religion. They are a sect of christianity that believed that everyone should be as morally pure as possible. The "Pilgrims" were puritans that were ostracized from Europe, so they came to America.

cxVmq2kraa	There is no such thing as beauty.  There never was & never will be.  There is confidence but in a sense that is fake. In fact confidence is faked.  So no we are not more attractive or ugly.  I do not believe that you can so easily group every person into two such polar opposites.  There are those who act beautiful and act like they are wonderful which does rub off on others, but being honest with yourself, did you believe their act?|`|YmtNel5haa	that is subjective..  beauty is in the eye of the beholder.  Some people think that they are much more beautiful than they are and some people don't know how much beauty they possess.|`|n2fniR4Gaa	it depends on confidence of course. if a person is very confident then they most likely think better of themselves. hypocrites are the best at fooling themselves. but non confidence people think worse of themselves. this is why people are annorexic.|`|T8G0wOXQaa	Because people lie to themselves and tell white lies to everyone around them.
fcf427fccc8fa8230c38f4b869207e8aaa	I think you have it all wrong.    The big stick was not the US- it was the Navy.    The idea was that the US would be a friend to everyone (speak softly) but have enough strength (big stick) to make any bully think twice before it would cross the US    Hence the Fleet building programme and the round the world cruise of the "great white fleet". This was a friendly visit- but left no doubts that real power was available - if it was ever needed    The US was never really imperialistic- otherwise it would have never left the Phillipines (and half of China). But Roosevelt never intended it to be the equivalent of Russia in 1905- seemingly a giant but unable to fight off a much smaller (but agressive) attacker|`|sQsl1r5Yaa	One is assuming the USA has or had an imperialistic attitude.  I don't.  I interpret the quote as meaning that a person, state, or nation should not embroil themselves into the affairs of others and should keep a low profile, but if attacked, they should be ready to retaliate with more force than the attacker.|`|AA10729675	Speak softly means show yourself as a savior.  Carry the big stick means strike hard while showing yourself a savior.  A little like an iron hand in a velvet glove.  Isn't it terrible?  Isn't it hypocrite?
AA10729675	Terrible.  Absolutely terrible.  Some died in silk factories.  They were small and with their tiny bodies they could go into the machines where adults could not go.  They worked almost everyday, all day long, would arrive at the age of 10, 11, and just die, exhausted.  Others were blowing into glass to make glasses and cups.  At a certain age (same as above) they just could not breathe any longer and would die, exhausted.  Some worked in coal mines and would die from mine accidents, or from exhaustion.  The less miserable were those who would sell things with the supervision of a rough, ruthless adults: at least they could walk, breathe, and be fed.  some could outgrow their poverty and be comfortable.  some would very early tutor rich people's children.  This is what J.J. Rousseau did.  He was in castles and well fed.  he had proper garments, and he could meet rich people, which he did, and he went on becoming famous.  How many Rousseau do you count?  He was an exception.  The other really had a miserable life.  Some were just servants, and they worked hard and were not properly dressed in winter times.    All those children were copiously beaten for the least mistake: no one would protect them.  If they had parents, those parents were tough people, also beaten, so it was like a granted thing to beat children.
0xfVyxxIaa	The Russian revolution began with the February revolution of 2nd March 1917, when the Duma assumed control in Petrograd forcing a abdication of the Tsar and enacting an emergency provisional government. Although a common misconception is that the revolution began with the October revolution on the 7th November 1917 when the Bolsheviks seized power.  Also recognise that they're named for the previous month as prior to the formation of the USSR, Russia still used the Julian calendar so the 7th of November was the 25th of October for contemporary Russians.    When the revolution ended is a 'grey' matter. The answer being sought might be the 7th of November with the October revolution, or it could be June 1923 which is recognised as the end of the resulting Russian civil war.|`|kuA09bzVaa	October, 1917 the ending date would be rather nebulous, because Marx and Engles saw revolution as an ongoing event, constantly making it better.|`|dZbtnZRTaa	started in 1917 when the bosheviks overthrew the tsar and killed his entire family...  i'm not sure when it ended but i know that lenin died in 1925 and stalin became the dictator till the 1950s

Her writing is very simple and readers do not have to do much thinking in order to get the gist of the story.  3) She suffers from said-bookism (google it).  4) The characters are all mary/gary-sues.  5) Bella was annoying: she pissed me off.  6) Edward is too controlling.  7) The book was not original: vampires are way over-used in romance novels.  8) It was totally cliched (starts with new girl meets hot boy, ends with the going to the prom!)|`|p880qn3Eaa	i like twilight because i found it a good book with a quirky topic  i did not become super obsessed, thank gawd, but i didn't like the books after that because when i read them they sounded like something she threw together so fangirls wouldn't bite off her hands|`|kFnzYrrnaa	I'm not to big into romance novels and vampire books, especially mixed together, but Twilight really hooked my in. I think it was because of two things. The first being that Stephanie Meyer took the whole vampire romance trashy crap genre and make it fun, realistic, and engaging. And I was also really able to connect with the characters. I was able to put myself in the story and become a part of Bella and Edward's fight for love. There are flaws of course, but over all it was one of the most exciting and fun pieces of literature I've ever read. I have read a ton of books from every kind of writer and style and I don't think a book has to be complicated and written in a certain way to make it a really good book. What makes it a good book is its ability to ebgage to reader and dish out a fulfilling story line. And just because it cause on like a wild-fire does not make it 'over-rated'. All it means is that it was able to get a whole bunch of kids to read.|`|N17nXKagaa	Ok. i am the same way. i think "y is evry body obseeed with it" i thought the book was realy good and all but im not gunna sit sit here and say OMG!

The objects either with their shapes, arrangements or with names on them turned just at the right angle and blocked just by the right things to display only one or two letters will spell out your name.    For example if your name is Nicole maybe you have Nike sneakers on the left and one sneaker lies on the side and the other one is half-covered by socks or a gym bag but the letter "N" is visible. Then your ipod could be laying next to them and the body of it will make the base of the "i" and the headphones will curl on top of it to form the dot. Then a poster, a TV/computer screen, dvd cases, etc. can spell the rest.

vkzkXWfzaa	Av is my standard setting as I can control depth of field. I use it for 80% of my pics and even some of my studio shots, you just have to watch the EV setting. I tend to use Manual in my studio as I know exactly what the light levels are, and a few test shots soon get exposure spot on.  What Mode do you usually use?    Noise Ninja and all noise reduction programs work by selective blurring of the image, they are great for newspaper type resolutions, but have never worked well enough for me for high quality large prints.    If you shot in Jpeg theres not much hope as you're going to have to remap the pixels in the file too far, being only 8bit they will fall to pieces. If you shot in Raw then by Photoshopping in 16bit mode you can get alot of detail out of the files without losing the smooth tones.    To be honest I would hold my hand up, admit my mistake and ask them for another chance, particularly as you're doing it for free. Turning out rubbish pictures will not help you build a reputation for your studio which is all important. Time to bite the bullet, we've all done it.
