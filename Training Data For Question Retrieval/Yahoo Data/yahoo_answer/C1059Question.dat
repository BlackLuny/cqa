20090225124616AAxh7r0	Sports;Football (Soccer);Mexican Football (Soccer)	What's one thing that annoys you while watching a football match?	Is there anything annoying to you?    For me, it's when I'm trying to watch Champions League, take this for example: Yesterday I was watching the Atletico VS. Porto game, and we know that the Arsenal VS. Roma and Inter Milan VS. Manchester United was going to come on after Atletico VS. Porto, right? It annoys me when the commentators start telling the scores of the other games in the middle of the game you are watching, as they are commentating this game. That is the most annoying thing to me, it took the fun out of watching the other 2 games when I already knew the score. I know they pass the scores of the other games at half-time, but I change the channel or press pause until the game is back on, but the thing that annoys me is when they say the scores of the other games when you know they will come on later.       What about you? And another question, is there anything weird you do or don't do during you're watching a game?

Look at King Kong Bundy he wasn't that great of a worker or talent yet people say he was a good wrestler in the ring.Andre couldn't speak English well either.   When Andre the giant was wrestling everyone loved the man and he wasn't that much of the wrestler from the matches I watched of him when I was younger.Big John Stud was the another big guy that people seemed to like pretty good and all he was not much of wrestler in terms of technical.Andre for sure wasn't good at interviews when he first started and for most part his entire career.   I know for a fact people like the big show and khalia could and would squash those guys in 2 minutes because they could wrestle longer matches take more and harder bumps than those guys ever did.

20090128093302AAP52TA	Sports;Wrestling	Why is it so hard for WWE fans to apreciate TNA?	I am a fan of both WWE and TNA      TNA was created for a reason to give wrestling fans an alternative from WWE mainstream scripted wrestling. Everyone should be enititled to have an alternative.      It is like saying that you can't have Pepsi without Coco Cola or a McDonald's without Burger King.      Why is so hard to accept TNA it seems like WWE fans avoid TNA like Dracula avoiding the sun.      I love TNA because it is different and they give good opportunites to young talent and their women. Realistically speaking if AJ Styles came to the WWE he would probably be in the mid card status.      I know is hard for WWE fans to realize but that is the way WWE works. Again i am a fan of WWE but people just realize and apreciate what TNA is doing ever since WCW and ECW's collapse.

20090128093121AA1jPvU	Sports;Basketball	Would the NBA be better off retracting? ?	There are currently a lot of horrible teams int he league and in the East the last 2 playoff spots are held by sub .500 teams. I am certain David Stern will fix it so those clubs get to 41-42 wins by beating up even worse teams playing D-Leaguers downs the stretch.      So Should the NBa simply eliminate a few teams to make things more competitive and put more talent into all the remaining franchises?      Washington 9-35. Just retract this group of misfits   Oklahoma City 10-35. Who needs basketball in OKC and why should we care with a record like this? Durant deserves better.   LA Clippers 10-34. LA is The Lake Show. This team has no reason to exist but to provide W's for their opponents.   Sacramento 10-36. Sacramento is a waste of a franchise. The city is dead and this team died 5 years ago. Move them to Vegas or retract them.   Golden State 14-31. Possibly in need of retraction but with all the other West teams going bye-bye this team might get better with the influx of talent and you can't argue ith such a large city like San Fran needing a team.   Indiana 17-28. No names on this bunch of creaps. Indiana is a College state time to get rid of this mess.   Toronto 10-28. No one wants to go to Canada or play there time to stop this experiment. Chris Bosh deserves to play for a contender and get some exposure.   Charlotte 19-26 The Hornets didn't work in Carolina. It like Indiana is college territory even the Great Jordan can't do much for this franchise (most would say he's part of the problem). Time to retract.      We'd be left with a much more competetive league. Sure marginal clubs lie: New Jersey, New York, Milwaukee, Chicago, Dallas, Minnesota and others might drop a few more games but they'd also benefite from a richer talent pool and draft pool helping them turn around quicker.       Thoughts?

It has been partially successful in that I found a station that could do it.

I tried writing to a local radio personality asking him to tell listeners to support my cause; I do not know if this has worked yet.  I really want to do this because I do not have cable or satellite television service at home despite the switch from analog to digital television in the near future.

20090128100621AABNpGi	Sports;Tennis	Tips to make varsity?	I am a freshman in high school. This makes it difficult to become varsity. I don’t want to be on junior varsity. It sucks. No matter what sport, my school loses when it comes to JV teams. Football, soccer, tennis, basketball AND baseball. We mostly suck, so its varsity or nothing. I really want to make varsity.       I signed up for tennis two days ago. I wasn’t in high school last year, so i couldn’t be on the team till this year. When i got to the sign up, i was the first person there. My name is first on the list. Second sign up, was also a freshman. AND it was someone i know. Now, we are friends AND rivals at tennis. Everyone else was seniors, juniors and a few sophomores mixed in. Total, there were about 45 sign ups. Probably 30 of them are serious. Only about 5 freshmen signed up. THIS MAKES THE PRESSURE EVEN WORSE. This is why I’m asking for help.      What are some tips to spice up my game? I have WONDERFUL ball control. I land 85% of my shots where i intend to place them. My serves are light, making it easy to return. My agility is average. I mostly use my reflexes when i watch the ball. This usually gets me to where i need to go.       I guess my question is.....what are ways to improve my serves and shots? Mainly power, but also, what is something i can do to throw off my opponent?      I use topspin and backspin. I have an amateurish kick-serve. I am working to perfect this.       Help is greatly appreciated.

If playing well against Celtic increases a players value immediately, does that mean Kenny Miller was worth ￡8 or ￡10 million after the 4-2 game ?      Fact is, 100,000 would appear to be a fair price for Flood in today's over-inflated market.  The minute he signs for Celtic, he will become the 2nd best player in Europe, (after Brown, of course).        Can you imagine the ridicule if Rangers bought him ?

This leads me to the opinion that Kuzy was some horrible person in the past..like Hitler, or Sadam, or a past day Fidel Castro. This happens to Kuzy all the time, and as the BRILLIANT Bud Collins stated "Kuzy always finds a way to lose,"   Why must the world hate her?   What did she DO?

They both can play defense, I'll give the edge to Ariza though, he hustles more than Outlaw, but I'll say Outlaw is a better shot blocker.      Offensively it's not even close, Outlaw is a way better offensive player than Ariza.      So who'd you rather pick?

20090225132113AAvP4h9	Sports;Football (Soccer);UEFA Champions League	Is there any actual "English" pride in the "English" clubs?	What I mean is that if you look at the Real Madrid v Liverpool game there are loads of Madrid fans waving Spanish flags.  they also have the Spanish emblem sewn on their kits.  When you watch Barcelona at home in two weeks time there will be lots of Spanish flags flying there too.      However, I saw no English flags flying in the Arsenal game at home yesterday and I can't see any in the Chelsea game either.        I can only assume then that we don't value our clubs the same way that other countries value theirs - is that because we have too many foreign players and managers compared with the Spanish teams and is the lack of flag flying evidence of us destroying our national identity within the game?

20090128111629AA1nDda	Sports;Swimming & Diving	Loosing weight as a swimmer?	I'm a highschool swimmer, and this is my first year, i do other sports aswell though.     We are coming to the end of the end of the season in about a month and I want to make the best of it.    I'm 5'5 131lbs, I haven't lost or gained any weight during the season, and to be honest based on my frame i could stand to loose 10lbs, just to get leaner, toned (especailly around my lower stomach and sides). I know that i've gained muscle, and i don't want to loose that but i do want to loose the fat which i know i have.    I swim 5 days a week for around 90 min, what else should i be doing now to get the last 10-15lbs off. Its not a health issue, i just want to be in top physical fitness(improve my speed too).    Food wise, i don't drink soda, and we never have chips/ junk snacks in the house.   I often run into the delema of time and after school and practice i come home starving and eat somthing that is easy(big bowl of ramen noodles, progresso soups). Breaksfast is usualy not the usual breakfast foods, ceral doesn't hold me till lunch and the high sugar content in the morning doesn't sit well with me so i have leftovers or some random stuff.    I hate dieting, but what should i try and do? I can't really get more excercise as i'm already walking to school, swimming, and riding horses...i just want this bit of chunkiness off.

Theres speed ropes which I don't really know how good they are, as 1) they're just pvc rubber, 2) all the different brands look the same so how would I know which one to get      Also there are convential leather roped, skipping ropes; but are these better or worse for training with?

20090128140725AAp0dOn	Sports;Outdoor Recreation;Other - Outdoor Recreation	Which airsoft gun should I get?	I previously posted a question similar to this one but made some errors and don't know how to edit it. I have narrowed my choices down to 3 choices, echo 1 ak 74u, echo 1 g36c, echo 1 p90. I love the way the 74u looks but it's a CYMA and they don't have the best reputation for durability (the gears are known for stripping). The g36c is tried and tested as the most durable, but i kinda don't like the way it looks. The p90 is new so it hasn't had many tests run on it so we don't know about the durability and it has the intimidation factor of a cattle prod, but it comes with 2 mags and a speed loader (=$40). Please help me choose because the gun I get is going to stay stock for at least another 6 months before I can really get enough money to upgrade it so it has to last for at least 2 years

But the question still stands.      As you know, in the 80s and 90s wrestling was great. Storylines were fresh, never repetitive, and best of all, the fans didn't know the behind the scenes stuff.      Now the business is exposed to every detail. All of you "wrestling fans" and more like wrestling analysts. All you guys do is analyze!      And I understand! There is absolutely NO suspension of disbelief anymore! You people know the behind the scenes stuff, how the moves are done, how storylines are decided, etc... Its inpossible to watch without thinking about the pushes, the faces, and the heels.      Pro wrestling is now a shallow sport. So my suggestion is, guys...Let's treasure our childhood memories watching. Let's treasure as kids, being scared of the Undertaker, idolizing DX, imitating those moves with out little brothers.      Let's look back and remember, but stop wasting our time watching. So what do you say, guys?      Is there any truth to what I'm trying to say?

Okay so I basically had a really heated debate with about 15 people, and we searched for the official rules but had no luck. Was wondering if anyone could help me out. We understand that it is probably 1 in a trillion    odds but what would happen if the steelers and the cardinals could not make the superbowl? Or even if 1 team couldn't. (due to natural disaster, accident, DQ, or something). Would they replace the team and hold the superbowl? would the game be cancled? Would they hold a comperable game but not call it the superbowl? Basically this argument came from a friend claiming that it is not impossible for the Miami dolphins to win the superbowl, it is just highly unlikely. (they would be many teams down the line) so bascially my question is, is it IMPOSSIBLE or highly IMPROBABLE that the miami dolphins could make the superbowl?       Please no "that would never happen" answers as we understand that, it's just a silly arguement that we can't find proof for.

The saints only had one good drive against the skins all game, the giants only scored 16 and that was in the first half, the cowboys couldn't move the ball on us except for two drives they had, the cardinals were really the only team we had trouble getting off the field, but even then they only scored 17.  So what do you think?

I don't get it....people continue to preach that Benoit did not do it, that he had "roid rage", or that he needs to be remembered for his 22 years of greatness rather than the fact that he is a murderer.      Has anyone realized that given the fact that this is a high profile death, and the fact that an entire family was involved, the investigators would make DAMN SURE that they had full knowledge of what happened.  They have the murder weapons, they know how and when the crimes were committed, and regardless of what you may think, the fact remains that he MURDERED his family.      As for "roid rage".  if this were the case, the murders would have happened in a span of minutes, not over the course of several hours.  The actions taken were calculated and deliberate and not a spontanious attack.      If you choose to honor a murderer, so be it...      However, the 22 years of great entertainment he provided to fans across the world cannot make up for the heinous crimes he comitted.

20080516042452AAZ93pA	Sports;Football (Soccer);Other - Soccer	Est-ce vrai que Nasri a insulté les journalistes de "vils rectums" ????	Je suis tombé par hasard, pendant que je surfais sur internet en quête d'actualité footballistique, quand je suiis tombé sur une pluie d'infos concernant Nasri qui a insulté les journalistes de Canal+ et les photographes après avoir marqué un but !         Des insultes du style: "bande de vils rectums", "faisez l'amour à vos mamans" (et non faites...), "bande d'invertis en chaleur".      Je suis quand même choqué. Ce sont les médias qui ont bati son statut de futur grand joueur et qui font qu'actuellement il est largement surévalué... Et il refuse la critique.      Il est descendu dans mon estime, ? y est sa tête s'est gonflée.
