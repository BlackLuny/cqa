20090309170731AAY3Vwt	Games & Recreation;Gambling	Can you suggest some really wild ideas for a loser penalty?	My GF & I were talking with our best friends, also bf &gf and the conversation turned to the athletic ability of guys and girls.  After a lot of debate it was decided that we would in effect create our own biathlon (running and swimming) guys vs. girls.  One girl and one guy would run a two mile course and then the other guy and girl would swim four laps in the college pool.  The winner is the team that finishes first but the girls will get a 30 second head start at the beginning of the road race.  If the girls win the race then the guys will do whatever they tell us to do and if the guys win the girls will do whatever we tell them to for one weekend beginning on a Friday and ending on Sunday evening.  What we agreed to do is post the terms of the bet here and ask for ideas for penalties for both the guys and the girls.  What we want are penalties that make it very obvious that the losers are paying penalties to that end with the exception that no one gets hurt and the penalty does not break the law anything goes.        In case anyone is thinking of things to do outdoors we live in the south and the weather is already in the 80s.
