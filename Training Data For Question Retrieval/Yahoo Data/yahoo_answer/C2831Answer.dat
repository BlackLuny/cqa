I put it on 3 cheese bread.|`|cxNLOPHNaa	I live really close to a Panera. I usually get the Turkey-Artichoke Panini, or the Chicken Caesar if I want a sandwich.<br>  <br>  But lately I've been a fan of their Caesar Salad. Also their famous Broccoli Cheddar Soup.<br>  <br>  If I'm up early enough... Their Spinach-Artichoke Baked Egg Souffle is a treat!|`|AA11684189	I love love LOVE their Chicken Frontega panini! & their bagels are delicious too! i love the french toast and the cinnamon crunch bagels.|`|XbRc9Hdaaa	Hell yeah, I love the smokehouse turkey.

AA10975447	I've been to a few shows at Jerry's in downtown Bakersfield. Most notably, I saw Weezer and Nerf Herder there in ... 1999? I've seen others, but it's been a while. Still, the place stays the same.<br>  <br>  Are you local to Bakersfield? Or are you traveling from another city outside of Kern County? If you're thinking of going up from say... LA, then don't bother. There are better venues about. Jerry's is a locals hangout, and it's the best scene you'll find in Bakersfield. But compared to other towns, it really blows. With that said, I have a deep affection for Jerry's because it's my hometown scene.<br>  <br>  1. Don't eat the pizza. It's cardboard. And don't drink the beer -- it's piss!<br>  2. The shows are all in the basement. The basement is small. It's great for hanging out with friends watching local bands (probably your friends' bands -- I know I go to see my friends' bands!)<br>  3. Just be careful. Be smart about locking the car and walking where it's safely lit.

Rib Eye :)|`|f696776b941b55b420115b639c09c57aaa	I'm not big on steak but when I want a good steak, and more importantly good sides, I head for Izzy's in the Marina.  Old school bar with great steaks and creamed spinach that would steal Popye from his canned stuff.<br>  <br>  Ruth Chris and Morton's are way over priced, Harris while good is stoggy and I'll take a pass in general on prime rib.|`|AA10667849	mortons is the very best
