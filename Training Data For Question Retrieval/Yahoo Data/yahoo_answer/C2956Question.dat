20090308040254AAPZGx8	Environment;Global Warming	What do you make of this graph?	 http://maps.grida.no/go/graphic/trends-i...       I found this very interesting. You always hear about how more energy in the system will increase the frequency of natural disasters. I have always been a little skeptical of this point, although it makes sense, due to lack of evidence. This is the first little piece of evidence i have seen. Obviously as population and recording of data increases there will be more disasters recorded but its interesting seeing floods and cyclones increasing relative to earthquake .Just wanted to know what everybody thinks of it???

We must save the river as it is the heart line . We must cooperate with  GANGA Action Plan committee . We must close the creamatoriums in the ghats of Ganga . We must stop industries polluting ganga . we must stop all religious activities where flowers are throen into ganga . we must stop burning candles and throwing them on ganga as population explosion is resulting into pouring of tons and tons of pollutants being poured into ganga .
20090308044858AA54kfZ	Environment;Conservation	Suggestions on Endangered Species?	Okay. So I'm doing an MUN debate and my topic is Endangered Species, so can anybody help me think of more suggestions or ideas on how to improve my resolution? So far I've got:         Committee: Environment & Ecological   Question of: Endangered Species   Submitted by: USA   Co-Submitted by:          Defines an ‘endangered specie’ as an organism with a rapidly decreasing species or are being threatened by altered predation or environmental patterns;      Reminding all countries that examples of extinct species include: the Dodo, the Balinese Tiger, the Golden Toad, the Sea-Cow, the Irish Deer and countless others;      Deeply disturbed by the fact that approximately 35 to 100 species of plants, insects & animals become extinct on a daily basis;      Strongly Regrets all extinct species which had the potential to assist humanity in such ways as finding cures to diseases such as cancer;      1: Calls on all countries to have stricter laws and legislation concerning endangered species   a) Such laws should include sections particular to actions such as: hunting/fishing, pesticides & poisonous chemicals, deforestation.      2: Stresses the importance of minimising and, in due course, eliminating all causes of extinction      3: Requests that all countries set up committees regarding the conservation of endangered species      4: Further Requests that all countries encourage breeding programmes in their nation’s zoos         All useful suggestions appreciated. :)

20090308074022AAMOXUA	Environment;Green Living	About      green fields?	Is there people out there who are as concerned as myself, about all the green fields that are being covered in housing, and roads. the UK  has let the whole world come into this Country, and in doing that all the green spaces are being filled with concrete. As regards our Countryside it will soon be non-existent,Future generations will never know what wild flowers are or see a green field. The thought is  horrendous, ans surely something has to be done to stop the rot.
20090308055939AAgQwcW	Environment;Conservation	Do you have problems with your local wildlife?	I live in a major city now, but when I lived in rural Washington, there was some type of predator in the vicinity that would take chickens, spook the horse, steal food and certain types of beverage if left unattended outdoors, and (I think) tip over the cattle.  I never got a good look at the thing, but one night I heard a chicken squawk and looked out the window just in time to see a big furry thing walking on two legs as it disappeared into the forest.  Black bears are common in the region, so that was probably it.

20090308052444AA5Yvub	Environment;Other - Environment	Will we perish, and do we deserve to perish?	Since humans are the sole cause of over population, consumption, pollution, the wiping out of animal and plant species at an incredible rate.    Basically it seems to me that we are on the verge of catastrophy, and its all our own fault. Instead of looking after this world that we are only apart of, but have the power to destroy or maintain, we choose to be blind that we are actually killing everything and that will include ourselves by the end of it.   What do you think??

20090308082824AAZiUbI	Environment;Other - Environment	Is there any chance we will ever go back to the old daylight savings time?	I absolutely hate the new 8/4 month daylight savings time nonsense. 8 months of short days and 4 months of long days is absolutely ridiculous. What was wrong with the old 6/6 month schedule? I HATE these short days. It feels like 6:30 in the evening when it's really 10:00 and you can't get anything done. Why did Bush have to screw with this? Is there a chance we will ever revert back?

When it is known that volcanoes are the greatest influence on our climate than anything else. (apart from the sun).    Look what mount Saint Helen's effected    There are at the present time over 30 active volcanoes.   Water is the biggest green house gas mix that with the sulphur dioxide   from volcanoes and watch the planet dissolve.

I just heard about those water bottles that have filters in them and i'm confused about how good of filters they would be. for instance if you used them out in the woods with water from a creek. what sort of things would get through. i'm not sure if these water bottles seem to be more for water you get from water fountains for sinks than for out-doors. some are ultra filtered and can filter some viruses and bacteria so i'm just not sure. if you can help, thanks
