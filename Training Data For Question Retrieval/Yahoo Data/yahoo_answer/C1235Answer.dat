FtbMinELaa	haha, you're lucky I was on this for another questions, so u get a quick reply.<br>  <br>  ok, so the radius is 7, so the height is 3.5. Calculate the volume of the cone.<br>  <br>  pi*r^2 *height.<br>  49*pi*3.5. You get 171.5 pi is the volume. <br>  <br>  Divide 171.5 by 7 (the radius) and you get how many minutes it takes for the radius to grow one meter. (6.125 minutes). But you want how fast the radius is growing. So simple 1/6.125= 8/49m/min. I'll leave the transfering of the unit pi to you.<br>  <br>  Goodluck!

GASTNilgaa	For all k except k = 29.<br>  <br>  Several ways to look at it.<br>  <br>  Four vectors form a basis of R^4 when the matrix M that has those vectors as rows is invertible.  So you put those vectors as rows of a 4x4 matrix and evaluate the determinant of that matrix as a function of k.  You get k - 29.  A matrix is invertible when its determinant is nonzero, so that matrix is invertible when k isn't 29.  That's one way.<br>  <br>  Another way to look at it: four vectors form a basis of R^4 when the matrix M that has those vectors as rows can be row-reduced (that is, changed by elementary row operations) to an upper triangular one with all nonzero entries down the diagonal.  The point is that this matrix is already almost completely row-reduced.  To reduce it all the way, replace the last row with<br>  <br>  [the last row] - 2*[the first row] - 3*[the second] - 4*[the third].<br>  <br>  When you have done this the last row is<br>  <br>  [0 0 0 k-29].<br>  <br>  If k is 29 you get a row of zeros here, showing that the matrix is not invertible.  For any other k, you get a matrix that has been row-reduced to one with nonzero entries down the diagonal.  That's another way of looking at it.<br>  <br>  I hope that one of these ways was helpful.

2CxS8Jqjaa	Lets define a few things first.  There are a lot of P's in this problem so I'm going to label the variables as follows:<br>  <br>  P = Profit<br>  N = # of Peanuts produced<br>  Z = # of Pretzels produced<br>  <br>  1.  The equation that governs profit is the number of peanuts produced multiplied by the profit per case of peanut plus the number of pretzels produced multiplied by the profit per case of pretzels.  Mathematically:<br>  <br>  P = N*40 + Z*55<br>  <br>  2.  The first equation to write is the one that governs the machine hours.  The machine hours is given by the number of peanuts produced multiplied by the time to produce them plus the number of pretzels produced multiplied by the time to produce them and must be less than or equal to 150.  Mathematically:<br>  <br>  2*N + 6*Z <= 150<br>  <br>  Similarly with the Man hours:<br>  <br>  5*N + 4*Z <= 155<br>  <br>  3.  Now graph these two inequalities on a set of Z/N axes as shown in the below link (yes that is paint...).  The easiest way to do this is to start with one equation, set Z=0 and find N, then plot that point. Next, set N=0 and find Z and plot that point.  Then connect the two points.  Repeat for second eqn.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://i571.photobucket.com/albums/ss155/mordieth/graph.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i571.photobucket.com/albums/ss155...</a><br>  <br>  You are not interested in negative values, so two of your bounds are going to be the positive N and the positive Z axes.  You also need both of the constraining equations from part 2 to be true, and these occur in the yellow portion of the graph. (The two triangles that are white represent areas where one constraint or the other is true.. in case you were curious.)  <br>  <br>  Now you need to test the four intersection points of the yellow polygon you created.   These are in the format (N,Z) and are (0,0) (0,25) (15,20) and (31,0).  You will find a maximum (and minimum) at one of these points.  <br>  <br>  So plug these four points into your Profit equation and see which one gives you the highest profit.  It should come out to 1700 (if I did everything correctly) and results from making 20 cases of pretzels and 15 cases of peanuts per day.  Hope this helps and you can PM me if you have any questions

axKQq9nXaa	Since man has been with elephants they have been hunted.  Even as far back as woolly mammoths.  Of course I would not consider that really poaching.<br>  <br>  Poaching is more defined as taking something against the law.  Thus they have only been "poached" since the world starting protecting their habitat and individual species.<br>  <br>  As far as being illegal right now... yes and no.  Overall they are still protected but there are certain areas where it is legal and there are times when numbers reach to high and a cull is issued and people can obtain permits.  There are also private hunting ranches that you can hunt within too.  It does cost a pretty penny and the are a mess of rules and regulations around it, but it can be done.<br>  <br>  With the quote...<br>  <br>  Bull hooks are used on captive elephants (most are dulled) but that is because unlike other captive species keepers/handlers are IN with the elephants.  No one goes in with apes, thus no tools are used.  With your horse example, correct bull hooks are not used on horses but whips are.  If you are going to single out the use of bull hooks you cannot make it sound like the elephants are the only species that are being "picked on" because it is far from the truth.<br>  <br>  With the second part...  I would take out the word "poachers" because again, it is only poaching when it is done against the law and those laws have not been around for "thousands" of years.  I would change "poachers" to "hunters".|`|hHjfoKEHaa	Elephant poaching has been around since the B.C's. Don't know the exact number of years. Ivory trade was made illegal in 1989. Poaching itself is also illegal. <br>  Both male and female elephants were poached not just "mother elephants". <br>  in fact, that statement is only true in the case of african elephants. With african elephants, both sexes have tusks, but with indian elephants only males have tusks.

It's a gross misinterpretation of what the Mayans were talking about.  The Mayans had some astronomical calculations of things and had everything broken down into eras.  Even today, our scientists don't really understand exactly what or even how they were calculating it.  In that way, they were actually more advanced then we are now.  However, the current Era is the Era that the Mayans basically went extinct in.  Not much has been found on what the next Era is supposed to be, so people just assume that it's supposed to be the "end of times".<br>  <br>  Now the Nostradamus people are jumping on the bandwagon saying that he predicted 12-12-12 to be the end of the world also.  However, Nostradamus has yet to predict an even prior to it actually happening to date.

Our sun is firmly implanted in the outter wing of the MilkyWay Galaxy and it moves WITH the Galaxy, not AGAINST or WITHIN our Galaxy.

Think about it, how the heck can we be moving our position in a galaxy that is hundreds of thousands of lightyears across and contains billions if not trillions of stars, but yet the constillations in the sky have not changed for thousands of years.  This theory is completely bogus.|`|17d2136cb28b3dcd96bfa98507022f5eaa	False.

"Planet X" and "Nibiru" simply don't exist. The Mayan calendar ends a cycle, but there were no predictions of the end of the world. The Sun doesn't line up with the galactic centre; it's 6 degrees off.

5c73173687a1f12a04793789493e8989aa	Your proof is almost correct. There is an error when you attempt to negate ( ~(7|x) ^ ~(7|y) ). The negation is (7|x) OR (7|y)  (see DeMorgan's Law).<br>  <br>  In any proof by contradiction, you assume the opposite of what you wish to prove, then you must find an instance where x and ~x are true. In this case, you showed that your assumption (that there exist x, y such that 3x + 5y = 47, but 7 divides x or 7 divides y) implies that 7|47. In general, it is fine to stop here. But if you really want to be rigorous, you have to say that ~(7|47) as well. So then, you have 7|47 and ~(7|47), which is a contradiction. And, therefore, your original claim must have been true.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps to shed some light on the method.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  <br>  You've written it differently in your original post: (3x + 5y = 47) --> ( ~(7|x) [[[ ^ ]]] ~(7|y) )<br>  <br>  In your explanation you wrote: <br>  (3x + 5y = 47) --> ( ~(7|x) [[[ v ]]]~(7|y) ) [claim].<br>  <br>  So maybe you only wrote it incorrectly (I triple-bracketed the error). No problem.<br>  <br>  EDIT(2):<br>  <br>  To show that ~(7|47) just do a simple computation. Try to divide 47 by 7. You will see that it does not work (i.e. you won't get an integer).<br>  <br>  EDIT(3):<br>  <br>  ~(7|47) is a fact independent from your original claim - it is not what you are trying to prove, so it is okay to use it.

Now, here we are 40 years later and we have not been back since the early 1970s.  Not only that, but we seem to have "forgotten" how to do it.  Those NASA engineers were in their 30s and 40s back in 1969...today they are in their 70s and 80s.<br>  <br>  My point?  My point is a simple one.  We've all be conned by the so-called enlightened ones.  The ones that suggested that parents should not be parents to their children...but rather, "their buddies".  We've also become so politically correct that the population is hypersensitive to anything that might be mistaken as racist, sexist, gay bashing, whatever.<br>  <br>  I believe that the entire conter-culture movement of the 1960s and 1970 has bred a society today where we are stuck in a self-created "dark age".  Young people no longer want to spend hours learning how to play the guitar...they would rather play a video game called "guitar hero" that requires the least amount of effort for the most satisfaction.  Or, for that matter, they don't want to venture into the wilderness and learn skills to keep them alive.  Instead, they would rather play video games that show the wilderness.<br>  <br>  We are very much stuck in a rut.  At least Western civilization is at the moment.  Meanwhile, the Chinese and Indians are busy building rockets with plans to again send men to the moon...and further.

XZatdDHjaa	The empirical formula is the simplest set of subscripts for a particular compound. For example, a disaccharide has a general formula: C12-H24-O12. This means that there are 12 carbon atoms, 24 hydrogen atoms and 12 oxygen atoms per disaccharide molecule. However, the numbers 12, 24, and 12 can all be divided by 12 to become 1, 2, and 1. So, the empirical formula for a disaccharide is: C1-H2-O1 (which is also the general formula for carbohydrates).<br>  <br>  Examples:<br>  <br>  A3-B12 ---> divide by 3, empirical becomes: A1-B4<br>  C3-D1-E4 ---> cannot be reduced, already empirical<br>  F2-G3-H6 ---> cannot be reduced, already empirical<br>  <br>  Remember, to find the empirical formula, all the subscripts must divide by the same number (greatest common factor).

6D9cWlbcaa	The mitotic metaphase can be distinguished from the metaphase I of meiosis as no pairing of homolog chromosomes occurs in mitosis; this is not necessary, even not suitable for the mitotic process (why?). Further, homolog chromosomes separate during metaphase I of meiosis, whereas during mitosis and metaphase II the separating structures are the chromatides. The difference between the separation in mitosis and metaphase II (meiosis) is that halfing of the number of chromosomes has preceeded meiosis II, in contrast to mitosis. Also the meiotic products are genetically diverse with respect to their parent and among each other. This is not the case in mitosis! <br>  <br>  <br>  Both Mitosis and Meiosis are mechanisms that describe cell division. <br>  The difference is particularly noticeable when one looks at the DNA in the cell's nucleus: After Mitosis, each of the daughter cells will have exactly the same DNA strands, while after Meiosis each daughter cell will only have half of the DNA strands. (Sometimes the division is not exactly half/half, but that is not important for this answer) <br>  <br>  Because Meiosis only has half the information that the parent cell had, the cell is (as far as we know) unable to reproduce by itself. The reason for Meiosis is for reproduction of a multi-cellular organism. One daughter cell (from the male of the species) will try to find a compatible daughter cell (from the female of the species) and fertilize it. This then becomes and embryo and the specie has successfully reproduced.

AA11606721	The way an organism evolves changes the way it can evolve - not everything is possible. We are mammals. The only truly flying mammals are bats. The largest bat in the world may have a wingspread as wide as a man is tall but they only weigh about 3 or 4 pounds - about the same as a human brain.<br>  <br>  Beyond the physical improbability of a human-sized flying mammal, we've diverged from the evolutionary possibility of flight so much that it's next to impossible.|`|7KJcMpl9aa	Sure, why not?<br>  <br>  Evolution is supposed to be random, isn't it?|`|91bhiXTVaa	No, or infinitesimally small chance of it.<br>  <br>  Humans have evolved as generalist omnivores using intelligence as the single most important selective factor influencing our survival.  The opposable thumb capable of manipulating tools and upright stance allowing us to use our hands for something besides walking, are the next two most important characters of Hominid evolution.<br>  <br>  The Harpy Eagle has evolved not only as an avian predator but as a specialist in maneuvering in the jungle canopy.  It has shorter, stronger wings than soaring eagles like the Golden Eagle to allow it to fly between the jungle trees, and it's claws are supposed to be as large as bear claws to kill it's prey quickly.<br>  <br>  So in order to fly like a harpy eagle, humans would have to evolve:<br>  <br>  1) Hollow bones, like in birds.<br>  <br>  2) The hands would have to be lost, the fingers and thumbs fusing like the wings of a bird (remember, you said fly like an eagle, not fly like a bat).<br>  <br>  3) Feathers.<br>  <br>  4) Loss of unimportant body mass.  Birds need to be lightweight to fly.  So human legs would have to become stick thin like storks or small, short and muscular like a harpy eagle.  The mouth would loose teeth as too heavy and we'd grow beaks.  <br>  <br>  and most likely<br>  <br>  5) Loss of brain mass.  Remember, we're talking about serious weight reduction to allow flight.  Our large brains weigh a lot.  For the manuverability of the Harpy eagle, we'd have to lose that.<br>  <br>  So human flight on a par with the harpy eagle would depend on a series of mutations that are not simply unlikely (like growing feathers) but are TOTALLY OPPOSITE of the selection in favor of manual dexterity and intelligence that are the strong point of our species.  And we'd have to find a way to survive each reversal of loosing our hands and brain and other features.<br>  <br>  I'm afraid that flight on a par with the harpy eagle would be unlikely even if we were to develop science-fiction level of genetically engineering ourselves, if we wanted to keep enough intelligence to be recognizably human.|`|BeTD0wY7aa	the answer is technically yes.<br>  <br>  but keep in mind it would take probably millions and millions of years. <br>  <br>  there would need to be some kind of evolutionary pressure in the environment that would lead to us developing in that direction. usually flight tends to start with gliding or something similar.|`|xsOE77mxaa	There are many chances, many people say that evolution of a human being may not end , so humans may fly in the future.<br>  <br>  It will not look good, but we can fly as super-man.|`|YHmr7nvsaa	No.|`|PVA6eCx7aa	Very few individuals of a species ever become fossils.  So truly, we dont know that much organisms morphological history.  How do you know we didnt breifly already evolve flight and loose it again?

How many different frequencies are on your fire radio?  There's fire, police, ambulance, aircraft, television, telephone, hospital, walkie-talkie, etc.  There's radar, satellites, etc.  There's city noise, traffic noise, construction noise.  There is short wave radios, FM, AM, UHF, VHF.  You can pick up cell phones on your TV.  So, you can't really say it is a separate phenomenon.|`|F6IOLf3Aaa	There are a number of possibilities:<br>  <br>  1. classified technology exists that permits both voice, music, and special effects sounds to be injected directly onto audio cassette tape as it moves past the heads in a tape recorder.  This is just one aspect of this kind of classified technology, the full range and scope of it is far broader, far broader.<br>  <br>  2. In any high impedance circuit where you may have high signal levels from broadcast stations or communication gear, modulated RF energy can accumulate around any high input impedance device such as an FET amplifier, or poorly ground network, and create a demodulation effect.  This demodulated information may get picked up by the FET amplifier, amplified, and fed to the record (or playback heads) head in the tape recorder.  It will appear on the tape during playback as bits and pieces of poorly understood sound information (maybe like an AM radio station sighal fading in and out).  You will not pick up stable reliable voice, music, or special effect sounds in this manner.<br>  <br>  There are probably other indirect methods for achieving this effect but only alternative 1 provides a solid method for recording reliable sounds, voice, and music over any given period of time.<br>  <br>  Do not ask me how this classified technology works.  No one is certain.  It appears to allow RF, sound, even visual holograms to be projected through portals in space-time.  I have actually had audio cassette recordings "edited" right there on the machine by this classified technology, while the machine was still recording.  That only hence at the full capacity and scope of this classified technology.<br>  <br>  This classified technology possesses the capacity to emulate the full range of effects we commonly associate with the ghost phenomenon.<br>  <br>  See: FREEDOM<br>  <a href="http://www.freedomfchs.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.freedomfchs.com/</a><br>  <br>  Hearing Sensatins in Electric Fields<br>  <a href="http://homepages.tesco.net/~John.Dawes2/extract.htm" rel="nofollow">http://homepages.tesco.net/~John.Dawes2/...</a><br>  <br>  Air Force Research Lab ...<br>  <a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x4vw83_air-force-research-labs-directed-en_news" rel="nofollow">http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x4vw83_...</a>|`|YIy9yu4qaa	Like you said, its caused by the paredolia effect, which is the same thing people hear when they play records backwards and hear satanic messages.

Typically there is no voice heard to the people present at the recording but after playing back the tapes there are sometimes strange voice recordings.<br>  <br>  <br>  what we do is explain what a recorder is<br>  *Please speak loudly into the device with the red dot on it, it helps us hear your voice.*<br>  <br>  - we usually record for like 15 - 20 mins. a session and give about 15- 40 secs in between each question we ask :)<br>  It takes time for them to reply, their voice isn’t as quick as ours in replying.<br>  <br>  <br>  Ask Questions with a digital recorder like :<br>  1. Is any one here.<br>  2. Is there any one who would like to make their presence known?<br>  3. Can you give us a sign your here.<br>  4. Can you give us a sign your here by making a noise or moving some thing.<br>  5. What is your age or how old are you?<br>  6. What year is it or do you know what year it is?<br>  7.

Please let us know what we can do.<br>  <br>  after you do that with the E.V.P.s i have programs where i can analyze them for you :) you can email me privately again for this just attach them....<br>  <br>  What EVP will we consider and/or present?  Type A & B are obviously the cleanest, clearest, and most important types to consider.  However, we will consider all unexplainable EVP important and worthy of presentation.  Type C EVP will be given the least amount of weight, but even if we can’t clearly determine what has been recorded, the client has the right to be shown any piece of evidence, regardless of how minute.  Typically, we need more than one person agreeing that we have a genuine EVP in order for them to be valid; however, if only one person hears something, but they are certain of what they’re hearing, we will present it to the client as a possible EVP and tell them nothing of what we think we hear.  If they independently come up with the same conclusion as our investigator, we will determine it to be genuine and of importance.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Ryan ~Paranormal Investigator/Researcher~<br>  teamhuntingevidenceofparanormal@yahoo....<br>  Email me for further questions :)

AA11081868	Oligotrophic lakes suggest that there are little nutrients to sustain life.I think you're assuming that biological production equals plant life. Think about lakes producing biological marine life. If you consider that fish breath oxygen through their gills, a lake without marine animals would have high levels of oxygen. Lakes with an abundance of marine life would have lower levels of oxygen.
ifKD7P20aa	There are different feeding methods in prokaryotes, and not all prokaryotes are photosynthetic or produces oxygen, such as chlostridium botrulinum, pylorobus fumarii, they are both chemoheterotrophs. The byproduct of prokaryotes is not only O2, it can also be ammonia, nitrogen sulfide, and other inorganic compounds. THus the high level of production does not neccessarily imply high level of oxygen, because there are other organisms that produce by products|`|6D9cWlbcaa	An oligotrophic lake is a lake with low primary productivity, the result of low nutrient content. These lakes have low algal production, and consequently, often have very clear waters, with high drinking-water quality. The bottom waters of such lakes typically have ample oxygen; thus, such lakes often support many fish species, like lake trout, which require cold, well-oxygenated waters. The oxygen content is likely to be higher in deep lakes, owing to their larger hypolimnetic volume.<br>  <br>  Ecologists use the term oligotrophic to distinguish unproductive lakes, characterised by nutrient deficiency, from productive, eutrophic lakes, with an ample or excessive nutrient supply. Oligotrophic lakes are most common in cold regions underlain by resistant igneous rocks (especially granitic bedrock).
FQvoUtwDaa	According to the drug information handbook, it says to avoid or limit alcohol use because lactic acidosis may be increased and it may cause hypoglycemia. It also states that patients taking metformin must be instructed to avoid excessive acute or chronic alcohol use. So while you're taking it, you can't drink *excessively*. Whether it's okay to get drunk every once in a while depends on what you mean by getting drunk. In my opinion, having a shot or two of alcohol would be okay, but I would not get sloshed out of my mind to the point where I get sick or pass out. That could cause serious problems with lactic acidosis then since that happens anyway with drinking, and--since you're taking the metformin--you now have an even greater chance of that happening. So then to answer your question, you could die if you drink excessively once in a while or have a chronic alcohol habit while you're taking metformin.

m4guclgYaa	For simplicity, consider a simple "rock" such as sandstone.  How large will this lump of sandstone have to be for gravity to pull it into a spherical shape?<br>  <br>  The property of interest is compressive strength, or the  point at which the rock crushes under pressure.  For soft sandstone, this pressure is about 5 Mpa, or about 725 pounds per square inch.<br>  <br>  The density of sandstone is about 2.0 - 2.5 grams per cubic centimeter, and there are about 454 grams per pound, so one pound of  the lightest sandstone would have a volume of 227 cubic centimeters, or 13.85 cubic inches.  One pound of sandstone would be a cube with each edge 2.4 inches.  The surface area of each face of this sandstone cube will have an area of 2.4 X 2.4 = 5.76 square inches.  Therefore on the surface of the earth, a one pound cube of sandstone setting on a sandstone surface will exhibit a pressure of 1 pound per 5.76 square inches, 0.174 pounds per square inch.<br>  <br>  Since the compressive strength of sandstone is 725 psi and earths gravity only exherts 0.174 psi, it is obvious earths gravity is not enough to pull solid sandstone into a spherical shape, so the sandstone lump would need to be greater in size than the earth.<br>  <br>  In order to exert a force of 725 psi, we need 725/0.174 = 4167 times the gravitational pull of the earth.<br>  <br>  Gravitational pull on earth is about 9.8 m/s^2 so to crush the sandstone the gravitational force would need to be 4197 x 9.8 = 40837 m/s^2.<br>  <br>  From physics, surface gravity g = (4/3)(pi)Gpr where<br>  pi = 3.14<br>  G = 10^-11 m^3/(kg.s^2)<br>  p = density in kg/m^3  (2.0 g/cm^3 = 2000 kg/m^3)<br>  r = radius in meters<br>  <br>  then r = (3/4)(g) / ( (pi)(G)(p) ) = (0.75)(40837) / [ (3.14)(10^-11)(2000) ]<br>  <br>  r = 487 billion meters = 487 million km, or about 300 million miles.<br>  <br>  In order for teh forces of gravity to pull a lump of sandstone into a perfectly spherical shape, that lump would have to be about 600 million miles across.<br>  <br>  Bear in mind there are still mountains on earth, so the earth is not perfectly round - gravity has not pulled the earth into a sphere.  The earth is spherical because it has a liquid core over which the surface has solidified and become formed by other geological and astronomical influences.|`|3f49d1173ab44657705ae3106bb11dc6aa	The size of a drop of water - a small drop of water - really small.<br>  <br>  You are right - it depends on the material.|`|17d2136cb28b3dcd96bfa98507022f5eaa	Roughly 900 kilometres in diameter.

To do that you simply multiply volume (in liters) by the concentration (in molarity) and then divide by the stoichiometric coefficient of each reagent.  In this case, the coefficients for both reagents are 1.<br>  <br>  For question b just use the equation C1V1=C2V2.  Here C1 and V1 represent the concentration and volume of the first reagent before mixing, and C2 and V2 represent the volume and concentration of the first reagent after mixing.  V2 is just the sum of the individual reagent volumes, so you can solve C2 = C1V1/V2<br>  <br>  For question c, the solution is a buffer because it contains a conjugate acid/base pair.  Conjugate acid/base pairs remain in equilibrium, so if an acid is added to the solution it will react with the base in the buffer solution, which will cause the equilibrium to shift but the pH of the solution will be essentially constant.<br>  <br>  For question d use the equation:<br>  <br>  pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])<br>  <br>  Here [A-] is the concentration of the conjugate base  and [HA] is the concentration of the acid.  The equation for Ka is:<br>  <br>  Ka = [H+][A-]/[HA]<br>  <br>  Where [H+] is concentration of hydrogen ions, and I believe that pKa is the log of that equation.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

In other words, all the times they could take are going to be centered around a certain number, like they said about "somewhere in the middle, like 1/2 an hour".  Only it wouldn't be half an hour.  It's much more likely that people went into the mall at intervals that are about equal to the amount of time you'll be waiting.  Let's just go with the assumption that a shopper will spend an hour in the mall.<br>  <br>  If you think about the probability of someone walking out, you have to factor in the number of parking places (16), meaning that you're 16 times more likely to have someone walk out in your case than if you were waiting on one parking place.  So, then, let's consider one parking place.  If you were waiting for one parking place, what would be a good guess for how long you'd have to wait (in other words, all of the values would be closer to what number?).  I'm thinking in that case it would be 30 minutes, don't you?  So then, if you're now 16 times more likely to have someone walk out, then you have to divide that 30 minutes by 16, which I'm will give you a little less than 2 minutes.  If you were waiting for 2 parking places, it would be twice that time, which would be a little less than 4 minutes.  Hope that helps.|`|99b7ae1fb72aa05004ef4ed601b5c09aaa	factor in the probabilty aspect of the question.  your chances of getting the parking spot are increased by 16 times (one for each space)

If the parents are both Ff then 1/4 of their offspring will be FF, 1/2 will be Ff, and 1/4 will be ff.  That means that 1/4 of their children will have the recessive (no freckles) phenotype.

They ask, "how sure are you?"  And you answer "I'm 95% sure."  Well think of it that way, but in terms of statistics.  Obviously, being 95% sure of something sounds better than being 90%.  And being 100% sure sounds the best!  Unfortunately, that's not always the case in statistics.<br>  <br>  Let's say that there's a TV show and they want to know what are the ages of its viewers so they can sell advertising slots that target that demographic.  The mean for this show is 30, after a random sample of of 10,000 people that were polled and watched the show.  However, this show has a very wide appeal, some people that are as old as 83 watched it and a few 13 year olds watched it as well.  Sure, the MEAN was 30, but what's the range.<br>  <br>  Basically what a 90% confidence is asking for a range between that would include 90% of the population.  So, say that 90% of all those that surveyed would fall between ages 24 - 34.

The other two are possible, yielding the solutions given.  The last piece of information doesn't matter:  "The three digit number is greater than 44."  I'm not going to assume what, if any, was the (typographical?) error here.  It is likely something which precludes 242, as it is the smaller value, but one never knows...You have had superfluous data in a previous lock question.|`|AA12132248	_ _ _<br>  <br>  The tens and ones digit must be 1 and 8, 2 and 4, 4 and 2, or 8 and 1 respectively.

So we have<br>  <br>  _ 4 2 or _ 8 1<br>  <br>  Then the hundreds digit is the positive difference of the ones digit and the tens digit. So we have<br>  <br>  2 4 2 or 7 8 1<br>  <br>  I presume "The three digit number is greater than 44." was a typo, and 44 should be something like 244 instead, so I'd say the answer is 781.

I am not convinced those were northern lights.  I think lights from the ground were reflecting off of small ice crystals in the form of plates - which cause 'pillars' of light - similar to the way you see a line of 'moonlight' reflected off the waves of a pond or ocean.  In the morning and evenings, you can often see a 'sun pillar' - a red pillar of light extending above the sun - which is the result of the sun's light reflecting off of ice crystals.<br>  <br>  Nonetheless, I have seen pillars of light extending hundreds of feet aboveground-light sources from ice crystals near the ground - a surreal sight indeed!  However, I have never witnessed a display like last night - which I think were ground-source lights reflecting off of ice crystals high above the ground.  <br>  <br>  I checked www.spaceweather.com and they did NOT report a geomagnetic disturbance last night.  |`|QTznh8Ibaa	I can't say for certain but I'm almost certain that we were seeing the Northern Lights.

SUxniVOqaa	Hi.<br>  I don′t think anybody will be interested in helping you with all these problems. When you need help you should ask 2-3 questions and ask that whoever answers gives you step by step explanation of what they are doing.

kc9mn9Raaa	An important cause of osteoporosis is a lack of calcium early in life. Adults need 1,200 to 1,500 milligrams per day. To get this much calcium from food isn't easy. You'd need to drink four to five 8-ounce glasses of low-fat milk each day, or eat several full servings of yogurt, cheese or broccoli (all foods high in calcium).<br>  <br>  Yogurt's most recent claim to fame is because of bacteria added into it (Lactobacillus acidophilus or Bifidobacterium) or (Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus). Yogurt has PROBIOTICS and they are thought to be beneficial to the health of our intestinal tracts, boosting the body's immunity, fighting some cancers and for preventing osteoporosis as well as improving lactose intolerance and milk allergies. Probiotics are able to survive the harsh environment of the stomach and make their way to the intestinal tract where they serve as friendly bacteria to help keep a balance between the other kinds of bacteria that live there. Even more amazing, this friendly bacteria helps the body break down foods, synthesize vitamins and process hormones such as estrogen. They may even help in the treatment of ulcers, colon cancer and vaginal yeast infections.<br>  <br>  Studies have shown that this alliance actually does help with digestion and decreased infections. For people with lactose intolerance, yogurt produces lactase to help break down the sugars found in dairy products. These folks find that they usually can digest yogurt without the discomforts of gas and bloating that they might experience with other dairy products. This is good news, especially since yogurt is a good source of protein, calcium and B vitamins!|`|EDjKCt0baa	Yogurt actually helps treat and prevent osteoporosis because it contains calcium for building bone density. Some brands regulate digestion because they contain live bacteria that produce hormones that tell your body how and when to use the bathroom.|`|hUYaaXBvaa	yogurt does not cause osteoporosis at all, if anything the calcium would help.<br>  some yogurts, supposedly activia can regulate digestion.<br>  <br>  here its called 'bifida regularis'<br>  <a href="http://www.activia.us.com/healthcare.asp#" rel="nofollow">http://www.activia.us.com/healthcare.asp...</a>|`|ViZyM2AUaa	I don't think yogurt could cause osteoporosis... That is caused from essentially a lack of calcium, and yogurt has calcium...<br>  <br>  <br>  Yogurt improves digestion because it has "active cultures," or bacteria that are good for your digestive system.

I suggest drawing it out and using Soh Cah Toa.  If you need more hints here let me know.<br>  *The ball's velocity in the x-direction will never change, so once you solve for how long the ball is in the air, you can use this knowledge to solve for the total range of the cannon with this equation: x=v*t<br>  *To solve for the ball's time in the air, treat it like it was shot directly upward at the y-velocity and will accelerate downward with a constant acceleration equal to g (-9.81 m/s^2)<br>  use the equation: <br>  x=initial position+(initial velocity*time) +(0.5acceleration*time^2)<br>  0=10+ (y-velocity*t)-(0.5g*t^2)<br>  Now, you have to use the quadratic equation to solve for t... choose the answer that makes sense (one will probably be negative or really big) and plug in to the equation I gave you for x-position, and you are good to go!!!

How metaphysical.|`|mlxaZbz8aa	wind occurs when there is a difference in air pressure. it is the movement of air from an area of high pressure to an area of low pressure. <br>  <br>  for example, the ground is heated up. the air above the ground rises and forms an area of low pressure above the ground. air rushers in the fill this space as wind. <br>  <br>  there is also such a thing as land breeze and sea breeze.<br>  <br>   land breeze occurs at night. the land loses heat faster than the sea, hence, an area of hight pressure occurs above the land. the sea loses heat slower, hence, there is an area of low pressure over the sea. air rushes in from the land to fill the space with low pressure. this air gets heated up and rises and the whole process is repeated. this forms a land breeze. <br>  <br>  the sea breeze occurs in the day. in the day, the ground gains heat faster than the land. hence, an area of low pressure is created above the ground. the sea gains heat slower than the land. hence, an area of high pressure occurs above the sea. air above the sea rushes in the fill the area above the land. as it gets heated up, it rises and the whole process occurs again. this is called a sea breeze. |`|pTUFrJmYaa	Wind is simply air that moves as a result of changing atmospheric pressures.

AA11824362	The mantle is like a plastic, and is able to deal with stresses by allowing flow in its minerals. Divergent zones are areas of upwelling mantle that decompresses when pressures drop near the surface of the Earth, thus forming lava. Earthquakes occurring below 700 km have to do with subduction of oceanic crust, possibly due to phase changes in minerals and the volume differences in the new minerals.<br>  If I heard an earthquake occurred at 300 km, I would think there must have been a lot of felsic material (clays, sands, etc.) in the subducting slab. The first mineral realignment is near 400 km, where olivine assumes the spinel structure, so this earthquake is not due to mafic rocks.
AA12139405	Here is the prediction method.<br>  Methods for prediction of earthquakes & Tsunami<br>  Even though it is difficult to predict, the following methods may help.<br>  .<br>  1. Seismic gape: - The earthquake at a particular place may occur for every fixed gape of time. By knowing the past records of the quakes affected at that place may help to decide when the earthquake is next due.<br>  2. Planet position.: - When the stress is accumulated at the tectonic plate boundary and the same time if the position of more than 2 planets comes in a straight line this may help to accelerate the earthquakes. There fore the full moon days and new moon days are more vulnerable days for earthquakes. Some time this method fails why? Think of a sick patient. New moon and full moon days are dangerous for only sick patents. These days will not affect the healthy people. The same way if there is no accumulated stress at the tectonic plate boundaries no need to worry about the planet positions.<br>  3. Sun rays falling method: - If you observe the position of the sun rays falling on our wall at a particular time on all days it should form an angular infinity symbol. If there is any deviation in its path it means that there is some difference in height of the earth. That means some strain noticed at that place. Somebody claims that they can predict the place of epicenter by observing this. The laser beam measuring method of earth height from satellite also will help.<br>  4. MDCB:- Chinese scientist claims that they can predict up to 60 % accuracy by sensing electro magnetic rays.<br>  5. Cloud forming: - Few hours to a few days before the occurrence of earthquakes a cloud reader claims that he has noticed a peculiar mosaic type of formation .We may also notice some lightening in the sky. <br>  6. By sound :- A professor from Ajmeer University claims that he was able to hear a low frequency noise under 125 meter depth in a bore well. The same thing was reported by one Mr. Nair that he heard some roaring noise under the earth one week before the occurrence of earthquake in Gujarat.<br>  7. By frequency of waves :-  Mr Richter Allen of Berkley University claims that he can decide the magnitude of earthquake just  4 seconds after observing the frequency of the primary wave. Present method needs the full seismographic picture to find the real magnitude that too from as many places as possible to have fairly accurate results. His claim has got some truth because when there is a slip of bigger tectonic plate the frequency of quake will be less. If a small tectonic plate slips the frequency of the waves will be more. <br>  8. There are several changes in nature and in the behaviors of animals and birds can be observed before an earthquake and Tsunami. The water level in well may change. Stay away from beaches if you sense earthquake waves. The Tsunami may attack long after the shaking is stopped. I wrote several articles on these subjects.  <br>  Have one simple earthquake alarm installed in your house. <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  .

By contrast, the parasympathetic system is "rest and digest" and emphasizes those aspects of your body associated with calmness and homeostasis. <br>  <br>  At the cellular levels, the two signal with different neurotransmitters. Preganglionic neurons in both the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems secrete the neurotransmitter acetylcholine onto nicotinic receptors. From there, neurons of the sympathetic system secrete norepinephrine onto noradrenergic receptors. In the parasympathetic system, neurons secrete acetylcholine onto muscarinic receptors.|`|vGC9hk7Zaa	sympathetic system is always crying and complaining and stuff, but PARAsympathetic is merciless, just pillaging and killing and destroying everything in its path.|`|Mr4DFAVkaa	The sympathetic system causes the "fight or flight" response - dilated pupils, decreased digestion, increased alertness, etc. The parasympathetic system is the "rest and digest" system, activated when there is no impending threat.

Note also that e^(i*k*2*pi) = 1, so 22*e^(i*(pi/n + k*2*pi)) = 22*e^(i*pi/n)*e^(i*k*2*pi) = 22*e^(i*pi/n).<br>  <br>  Then you can convert it back to cartesian using Euler's identity given above.

In adolescents your bones are still growing and forming so your adult face shape probably does look different than your teen face. No correlation between stress and facial features.

cZgCCjA4aa	Hola, El sistema inmunológico está formado por un conjunto de mecanismos que protegen a un organismo de infecciones por medio de la identificación y eliminación de agentes patógenos. Debido a que los patógenos abarcan desde virus hasta gusanos parásitos intestinales, esta tarea es extremadamente compleja y las amenazas deben ser detectadas con absoluta especificidad distinguiendo los patógenos de las células y tejidos normales del organismo. A ello hay que sumar la capacidad evolutiva de los patógenos que les permite crear formas de evitar la detección por el sistema inmunológico e infectar al organismo huésped.<br>  <br>  Para protegerse, los organismos vivos han desarrollado varios mecanismos para reconocer y neutralizar patógenos. Incluso organismos unicelulares simples —como las bacterias— poseen un sistema de enzimas que las protegen contra infecciones virales. Otros mecanismos inmunológicos básicos evolucionaron en las antiguas células eucariotas y permanecen hoy en sus descendientes modernos: plantas, peces, reptiles e insectos.|`|TnY3akHNaa	simplemente la de proteger el cuerpo de agentes externos que podrian causarle males(como por ejemplo virus, bacterias, germenes,etc)<br>  para ello tiene un sistema que es el de los globulos blancos, que atacan al microbio matandolo|`|jnxp7QLmaa	Sistema inmunológico, también llamado sistema inmune, es el sistema corporal cuya función primordial consiste en destruir los agentes patógenos que encuentra. Cualquier agente considerado extra?o por un sistema inmunológico se denomina antígeno. La responsabilidad del sistema inmunológico es enorme y debe presentar una gran diversidad, con objeto de reaccionar de forma adecuada con los miles de antígenos, patógenos potenciales diferentes, que pueden invadir el cuerpo. Aún no se conocen en su totalidad los mecanismos fisiológicos complejos implicados en el sistema inmunológico, pero la investigación médica continúa desentra?ándolos.<br>  <br>  Componentes<br>  El sistema inmunológico consta de seis componentes principales, tres de los cuales son diferentes tipos de células, y los otros tres, proteínas solubles. Estos seis componentes pueden encontrarse en la sangre de diferentes formas.<br>  <br>  Células <br>  <br>  Las tres categorías de células inmunológicas son granulocitos, monocitos/macrófagos y linfocitos. Los granulocitos son las células con núcleo más abundantes en la sangre. Estas células fagocitan (ingieren) los antígenos que penetran en el cuerpo, sobre todo si estos antígenos han sido recubiertos en la sangre por inmunoglobulinas o por proteínas del sistema del complemento (descrito más adelante bajo el epígrafe proteínas). Una vez ingeridos, los antígenos suelen ser destruidos por las potentes enzimas de los granulocitos.<br>  <br>  Los monocitos constituyen un peque?o porcentaje de la totalidad de las células sanguíneas; cuando se encuentran localizados en los tejidos, fuera de la circulación sanguínea, experimentan cambios físicos y morfológicos, y reciben el nombre de macrófagos. Al igual que los granulocitos, los monocitos también ingieren sustancias extra?as, interaccionan con las inmunoglobulinas y con las proteínas del complemento, y contienen enzimas potentes dentro de su citoplasma. Sin embargo, los monocitos alteran además los antígenos, haciendo que la respuesta inmune del tercer tipo de células inmunológicas, los linfocitos, sea más fácil y más eficaz.<br>  <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  En algunos aspectos, los linfocitos son las células más importantes del sistema inmunológico. Existen dos tipos principales de linfocitos: los linfocitos B y los linfocitos T. Los primeros son responsables de la inmunidad humoral o serológica; es decir, los linfocitos B y sus descendientes directos, que reciben el nombre de células plasmáticas, son las células responsables de la producción de unos componentes del suero de la sangre, denominados inmunoglobulinas (véase más adelante). Los linfocitos T son responsables de la inmunidad celular; es decir, atacan y destruyen directamente a los antígenos. Estas células también amplifican o suprimen la respuesta inmunológica global, regulando a los otros componentes del sistema inmunológico, y segregan gran variedad de citoquinas (véase más adelante). Los linfocitos T constituyen el 70% de todos los linfocitos. Tanto los linfocitos T como los linfocitos B tienen la capacidad de recordar, desde el punto de vista bioquímico, una exposición previa a un antígeno específico, de manera que si la exposición es repetida puede producirse una destrucción más eficaz del antígeno.<br>  <br>  Proteínas <br>  <br>  Los tres tipos de proteínas que forman parte del sistema inmunológico, y se encuentran disueltas en el suero (la porción líquida de la sangre), son las inmunoglobulinas, las citoquinas y las proteínas del complemento. Hay miles de clases diferentes de inmunoglobulinas, que reciben el nombre de anticuerpos; cada una de ellas se combina de manera exacta con un tipo específico de antígeno y contribuye a su eliminación. Esta inmensa diversidad es la característica principal del sistema inmunológico en conjunto.<br>  <br>  Las citoquinas son compuestos solubles, responsables en gran parte de la regulación de la respuesta inmunológica. Si son segregadas por los linfocitos, reciben el nombre de linfoquinas; si son segregadas por los monocitos, se denominan monoquinas. Algunas citoquinas amplifican o incrementan una respuesta inmunológica que está en curso, otras hacen que las células proliferen, y otras pueden suprimir una respuesta inmunológica en funcionamiento. El sistema inmunológico, al igual que otros sistemas corporales, debe ser regulado de esta forma, de modo que el sistema esté activo cuando sea necesario, pero que no lo esté de una manera patológica.<br>  <br>  Las proteínas del complemento forman una familia de compuestos que, junto con las inmunoglobulinas, actúan para propiciar una respuesta inmunológica adecuada. Una vez que un anticuerpo se une específicamente a su antígeno, las proteínas del complemento pueden unirse al complejo formado de esta forma, y facilitan que las células inmunológicas lleven a cabo la fagocitosis.|`|mENQvwOFaa	es revisar proteger e inmunizar (como dice su nombre) el torrente sanguineo eliminando asi cuerpo y materias extra?as que podrias ser da?inas si tienes un sistema inmunologico bajo, te enfermaras muy facilmente

bfXm8t1Iaa	The mole is a two-sided concept. On the one hand, it's 6.02X10^23 atoms, molecules or whatever. On the other hand, the mole is *defined* to be the atomic mass or molecular mass of a substance, expressed in units of grams/mol. Look closely at some simple examples--like H2 and He--to prove to yourself that this makes sense. <br>  <br>  I'm assuming that expressions like "X 1024 atoms" mean "X 10^24 atoms", where the 24 is a power of 10.<br>  <br>  1. True. One mole of N2 contains 6.02X10^23 molecules, and twice that many nitrogen atoms. <br>  <br>  2. Both of these quantities satisfy the definition of mole. Therefore they each contain 6.02X10^-23 molecules. <br>  <br>  3. True. For each of the given quantities, we're talking about half a mole of Cl2. 
qtuaCHetaa	nctarheelsboy11,<br>  <br>  One mole of N2 weighs 28.02 grams and contains 1.20 x E24 atoms.<br>  ***TRUE -- atomic weight of nitrogen is 14.01 g/mole, and there are two atoms per molecule.  Since there are two atoms per molecule, multiply that time 6.0 x 10^23 to get atoms per molecule.<br>  <br>  A sample of H2 weighing 1.01 g has the same number of molecules as 35.45 grams of Cl2. <br>  ***TRUE; that would be one-half mole of hydrogen molecule (1.01 g/atom x 2 atoms/molecule), so one-half moles of chlorine molecule (also two atoms per molecule) would be (35.45 x 2)/2 = 35.45.<br>  <br>  The mass of 3.01 x E23 molecules of chlorine is 17.72 grams. <br>  ***FALSE; since chlorine is diatomic, 3.01 x 10^23 molecules is 6.02 x 10^23 atoms, which weigh 35.45 grams.<br>  <br>  The mass of 3.01 x 1023 atoms of hydrogen is the same as 1.50 x E 23 molecules of hydrogen.<br>  ***FALSE, BUT ALMOST TRUE; since there are two hydrogen atoms per molecule of hydrogen, 1.50 x 10^23 x 2 = 3.00 x 10^23 molecules of hydrogen.<br>  <br>  One mole of Cl2 and one mole of CO have the same number of atoms.  <br>  ***TRUE -- both are diatomic (have two atoms per molecule)<br>  <br>  One molecule of N2 weighs 2.32 x E-23 grams. <br>  ***FALSE -- they calculated the mass of one nitrogen ***atom***.  One molecule of nitrogen gas has two atoms of nitrogen, which totals 28.02 g/mole.  Divide that by 6.02 x 10^23, and you get 4.65 x 10^-23 grams per molecule.<br>  <br>  Hope that helped!

RO7c0pyEaa	Hmm...I don't have a way of knowing what kind of angles you're talking about, but I'll try to help anyways.<br>  <br>  First of all, you have to know the measure of the angles. I'm assuming that in each of your examples, angle 1 is adjacent to angle 2 (they share a side). If this is the case, find out what the measure of the big angle they form is. Then add together the measures of both angles to make an equation (ie: 4x+2x-6=...) If they don't give you the angle measures, here are some common ones: Right angles are 90 degrees, straight angles (a straight line) is 180.<br>  <br>  If the two angles are vertical angles, then its different (Think of the letter X. Look at the angles formed on top and on the bottom; these are vertical angles.) Vertical angles are congruent, so put the measure of each angle on a different side of an equation (for example, the first problem would be:<br>  4x=2x-6). Now use algebra to solve for x, and from there figure out the measure of each angle. HOpe this helps :)|`|CPcYVMJvaa	I have no idea what you're supposed to do in this problem.

10bb153a928c9693ebec1b2660853526aa	Well first, remember the order of operations. Here's a refresher on that:<br>  <br>  1. Simplify all operations inside parentheses.<br>  2. Simplify all exponents, working from left to right.<br>  3. Perform all multiplications and divisions, working from left to right.<br>  4. Perform all additions and subtractions, working from left to right.<br>  <br>  So, we have:<br>  (t^4+5t^3-t^2+8t-10) - (t^4+t^3+2t^2+4t-7)<br>  <br>  I put ^ instead of "to the #rd/th". That's pretty standard notation, if you need to write stuff online. :)<br>  <br>  Parentheses first. Let's work on this left one, here:<br>  <br>  (t^4+5t^3-t^2+8t-10)<br>  <br>  Okay, exponent's next. Well, we don't know what t is, so we can't figure that out. Moving on. Multiplications and divisions, next. None of those... Ah-ha, additions and subtractions, from left to right. Well, we've got some of those, don't we? Problem is, we've got a few different kinds of t's going on, here. We've got a t^4, a t^3, a t^2 and a plain ol' t. So, because those are different kinds of t's, we can't combine any of them, really. Then we've got a random 10, which we can't add or subtract to anything, yet, so ... we can't really do much in this parenthesis can we? If someone gave you what t equals, we could do a lot more. :)<br>  <br>  Moving on to the other side:<br>  <br>  - (t^4+t^3+2t^2+4t-7)<br>  <br>  Important! Remember what sign is in front of the parenthesis. You'll distribute that sign to everything in there. So, this parenthesis becomes:<br>  <br>  - t^4 - t^3 - 2t^2 - 4t + 7<br>  <br>  Again, since we don't know what t equals, we can't simplify those exponents. And there's no multiplication or division going on, so nothing to do there. But there is addition and subtraction. Let's look at these. There's a t^4, a t^3, a t^2, and a plain ol' t, just like in the other parenthesis. On its own, we can't do anything. But let's try sticking them together:<br>  <br>  t^4 + 5t^3 - t^2 + 8t - 10 - t^4 - t^3 - 2t^2 - 4t + 7<br>  <br>  Ah-ha! We have some common t's to combine! Let's put them side-by-side so we can see this easier:<br>  <br>  t^4 - t^4 + 5t^3 - t^3 - t^2 - 2t^2 + 8t - 4t - 10 + 7<br>  <br>  A t^4 and a -t^4 will make... ooo, nothing. They cancel each other out. All right, moving on. <br>  <br>  A 5t^3 and a -t^3 will make 4t^3. (5 t^3s minus one t^3 will give you 4 t^3s. :)) <br>  <br>  A -t^2 with a -2t^2, now that's a bit trickier. Pretend if a t doesn't have anything in front of it, that it's a 1. So we're saying, -1 minus -2, or -1 - -2. That's actually -1 + 2 (since two negatives is a positive), so we'll come up with 1. 1t^2, or just t^2.<br>  <br>  8t - 4t, that's 4t.<br>  <br>  -10 + 7, that's -3.<br>  <br>  So, together, it's all 0 + 4t^3 + t^2 + 4t - 3. If you have a number for what t equals, now's a great time to plug that in and see what this is all about! <br>  <br>  I hope I helped. Math is tough!|`|aea09dd2f1cdb10023223ef9ddd26306aa	10t^5 + 55t^4 - 15t^3 + 90t^2 - 180t + 70<br>  <br>  <br>  (Romy is not correct if you're asking for coefficients, not exponents)|`|UjACMxhEaa	(t4+5t^3 -t2+8t-10) -(t4+t3+2t^2+4t-7)<br>  t^4 + 5t^3 - t^2 + 8t - 10 - t^4 - t^3 - 2t^2 - 4t + 7<br>  0t^4 + 4t^3 - 3t^2 - 4t - 3<br>  <br>  4t^3 - 3t^2 - 4t - 3

Also, astronomers study the motions of objects in space to see where there is material that might be moving as if a black hole were affecting it. So far, evidence had been found for the existence of black holes in the centers of several large galaxies, and in binary star systems (where two stars orbit each other). |`|XFlldtPXaa	They locate them based on the activities of nearby stars or other bodies. If they're getting sucked into oblivion, there's a pretty good chance you've found yourself a black hole...|`|bb5e3162f4c207ab157801f357f83c36aa	Black holes are not invisible----the gas falling into them becomes extremely hot and emits copious radiation at all wavelenghts.|`|H3oF4iCjaa	i'm a black hole lol|`|PvsxorTOaa	ummm school work are well 
08b3a8bf504aa92096843fccc4c02cb6aa	Yes it is.  If n equaled 2, then you are saying that 2 is equal to itself.  That's called the reflexive identity.<br>  <br>  4n + 6 - 2n = 2(n+3)<br>  2n + 6 = 2n + 6<br>  2n = 2n<br>  n = n<br>  <br>  So for any value of n, as long as the same value is used on each side, the equation is true.|`|W8C4MKsFaa	that just means that n can be equal to ANYTHING and it would still satisfy the equation.  n could be pi.... n could be 982.... it could be 43^115... anything.  it would always be true.<br>  <br>  n could be equal to a variable too.  like if you had a more difficult equation and came up with something like <br>  <br>  n=z<br>  <br>  that would be fine too.  what you come up with is what you get.  it doesnt mean you did it wrong.|`|401e0b603e98257a6483b0111f39f2c3aa	Yes, that would mean that ANY value of n will make that equation true.<br>  <br>  Try plugging in a few n's and you will see they all work.|`|HwlBgOEraa	yeah the answer is no answer, teachers try to trick you. i just tried this problem and got the same ting.|`|aPKW0ljVaa	subtract the n and zero equals zero<br>  <br>  lets see<br>  i think n=0|`|2LZbzvY3aa	n = 0 here<br>   or any other value you'd like!!!|`|nWUjy3ltaa	When you simplify an equation to something like n = n, this means that the equation is true for all real numbers.  That is, any number is a solution to the equation.<br>  <br>  Let's pick a number: 1.<br>  <br>  4(1) + 6 - 2(1) = 2(1 + 3)<br>  4 + 6 - 2 = 2(4)<br>  8 = 8<br>  <br>  So 1 is a solution.  Let's try 2:<br>  4(2) + 6 - 2(2) = 2(2 + 3)<br>  8 + 6 - 4 = 2(5)<br>  10 = 10<br>  <br>  No matter what number you try, it will always work!  This type of equation is called an identity.  Once you simplify your equation to something like n = n, you should answer that the solution is "all real numbers" or "the set of all real numbers."|`|snTIrYHSaa	4n+6-2n=2(n+3)<br>  4n+6-2n=2n+6<br>  Technically it would be 0=0, right?<br>  Depending on what chapter it's called, i think its a word you use, like infinite, or equal, or something.

Humans have a highly developed brain, capable of abstract reasoning, language, introspection, problem solving and emotion. This mental capability, combined with an erect body carriage that frees the forelimbs (arms) for manipulating objects, has allowed humans to make far greater use of tools than any other species.

SvmZlLdaaa	Anacondas do exist, yes, but the film is riddled with inaccuracy. The snakes in the film are far too large, and move far too fast - in reality, the green anaconda can reach 10 metres in length and weigh 550lb (the yellow anaconda, a separate species, is much smaller), and is largely aquatic. On land they are too large to move fast - you could easily outdistance one walking, never mind running. The snakes in the film are also shown eating people, swallowing them whilst they are still alive and doing so in about a minute. In reality, even the largest snakes in the world cannot swallow a normally-sized adult human - the width of our shoulders makes it impossible (though there are records of reticulated pythons, which reach the same length as anacondas but are much lighter, eating children and even very small adults). Snakes never begin swallowing until certain their prey is dead - if it was still alive it could struggle and injure the snake - and it takes them well over an hour to swallow large prey. Also, the film states that anacondas have heat pits, which they do not. It is a completely ridiculous film. If you must watch it, take it with a massive pinch of salt, and don't believe anything it tells you. Movies in general are not a good source of information about the natural world.|`|SWxnbKyyaa	Anacondas exist but not as shown in films...they are heavily bodied and movement is extremely slow...they kill their prey only by ambush..they hide themselves and slowly catch hold of their unwary prey and lunge into a set of coils to suffocate...this I think you should be knowing...what is shown in films are in total contrast to what you see in wild-life channels...they show anaconda just moving in rocket speed and coiling as when it wants....first of all an anaconda feeds once in a few months depending on prey size it captures...unlike pythons ,anacondas grow very slowly....to grow that long(as shown in the movie)...well even 100years  old anaconda cannot achieve that...swallowing is not an easy job..it takes hours to do that....so the interval to kill and swallow two people (although there is no record of constrictors swallowing fully grown adults) should be precisely  very long and it becomes very vulnerable during the swallowing part.....anacondas although they are the largest snake they are definitely not the longest(the reticulated python is the longest growing upto a maximum length of 30ft)...|`|7yVL08Whaa	Green anacondas grow upto 30 feet in length and they are the heaviest snakes in the world. But the credit of being the longest snake in the world goes to South-Asia's most reputed Reticulated Python.

They can grow as big around as a grown man and have been known to reach 33 feet and 500 pounds on rare occasions. The average anaconda gets to about 20 feet long and can weigh about 235 pounds.  That's downright huge!  Movies tend to exaggerate, and Anaconda the movie did exaggerate.  But you can Google "anaconda snake images" to get a better look at these huge snakes.

Time 1 (T1) is an extra-dimensional object that contains all possible permutations of time - an eternal "now". Time 2 (T2) is where consciousness intersects with T1.

For example, I am on my 15th re-reading of the Elegant Universe by Brian Greene.  The first half of the book is simply amazing, but the second half tends to cause cranial drip from my ears.  I mean, "space tearing flop transitions" -- come ON Mr. Greene, WHAT are you smoking and can I have some?<br>  <br>  Neverthless, any string theorist will tell you that they don't care so much if superstring theory is proven right, they find the math so beautiful it is an art form to them.  Moreover, string theory brings about some VERY interesting concepts.  One is that size doesn't matter (you guys paying attention? lol).  That the physics of a reciprocal size of the universe (1/13.7 billion LY) will yield the same results.  And that there doesn't have to be an actual "beginning" when you parse time down to as small a sliver as the Planck "Era."  Many wonderful ideas come out of hyperdimensional space, and I agree, they are beautiful concepts even if I don't understand the math, which is an understatement to say the least.  Amazing stuff.  But then, we are not "missing" the extra dimensions.  They are curled up very small, smaller than the Planck length (Google it please, I can't do exponential notation with this crummy wordprocessing software that Yahoo Answers proffers).  What made our 3 physical dimensions unfurl along with the 4th dimension of time is an amazing theoretical treatise.  I would recommend The Elegant Universe and the sequel, The Fabric of the Cosmos, to anybody that thinks humans are limited to accept that goddiddit.|`|AA11562077	I'm intrigued by the apparently multidimensional nature of time, both in the sense of internal and external perceptions. [The philosophical and scientific viewpoints, if you like.]<br>  <br>  There's the age-old questions about 'deja vu" and what seem to be undeniable psychic abilities in some individuals. TV's "Psychic Detectives" can be particularly surprising -- including to the police who you see become 'converts' in some of the episodes.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, my present 'Dada' about physics is this apparent paradox that I've talked about before.  I'm no Stephen Hawking, that's for sure, and ideas about 26 different, or "Folded Dimensions" -- both are beyond my ken.<br>  <br>  But still, just as Galileo was able through simple observation to postulate that the Earth did indeed revolve around the Sun (which led to dire consequences for him!), today's observational data in astronomy point to a radical departure about how I should think about Time/Space.<br>  <br>  Looking toward the limits of the ever-expanding Universe, we look back in time. The earliest events, monstrous Quasars and so on are close to that time when we observe the beginning of the Universe itself.  But what is beyond?  Modern theory is in practical unison about the Big Bang -- and that unanimity is something that almost always points to the maturity of any given science, once generalized superstition is past.  The point is that the 'Singularity' is an integral part of the Big Bang hypothesis.  If such an event occurred - it (the Singularity) is what we will eventually see if we look far enough into space -- far enough back in time.  A tiny (perhaps even "dimension-less") and incredibly dense object; it is at limit of Time as we know it.<br>  <br>  The intriguing thing that occurs to me is that we look "toward" this same 'event', or infinitely small object -- NO MATTER WHICH DIRECTION WE LOOK FROM THE EARTH.  This implies to me a generalized curvature of Space/Time, just as did Columbus' assumption that he could reach India by sailing West, rather than East.  We are dealing with a curvature of 3-dimensional space here, though, and a dismissal of what our perception of even local Space/Time is, in the same way that Columbus's assumption eliminated the generally accepted belief that the Earth was flat.  <br>  <br>  I think then, that our conceptions of Space/Time (including Einstein's!), are in great part founded on empirical experience and perception only -- and are perhaps not "True" at all in a larger sense, no matter how useful our measurements may be locally or in our immediate vicinity.  It's pretty easy to see how gravity necessitates at least 4 Euclidean dimensions.  After all, gravity does not just work "Down" in space, does it?  So 4-D Hyperspheres (gravitational fields around any body in space) are an everyday reality, even if we have no way of seeing them.<br>  <br>  It's interesting, too, to consider that if a "graviton" exists (as some say it does), then the transfer of this particle from one body to another apparently ignores Einstein's "Universal Speed Limit" of 186,000 miles/sec. For instance, if the Sun were to somehow move 100 miles to one side relative to the Earth, I doubt it would take 8 seconds for the effect of that to be felt here!  On a less catastrophic scale, it seems to me that the "missing" element of the Unified Theory -- the (Relatively!) tiny force of gravity -- may hold the key to defeating the apparently insurmountable problem of interstellar travel -- and perhaps to travel across Time itself. <br>  <br>  Perhaps the eventual perfect marriage of science and philosophy will prove to be as mysterious and fulfilling as that between man and woman.  You might even say that our proud philosophy has reached the stage where it is almost willing to humbly go down on one knee and propose.  Imagine the children they would have!

AA11513203	No, that's not what evolution is.<br>  <br>  Evolution is the concept that species change over time.   That's it.<br>  <br>  One of the consequences of that simple idea is that over a *LOT* of time, species can experience a *LOT* of change.    <br>  <br>  Coupled with isolation between species, that means that two populations can evolve (change) to be so genetically different from each other, that the members of the two populations are no longer able to interbreed.   At that point they are separate *species* ... forever separate *branches* in evolution.<br>  <br>  And that is why two species can have a common ancestor.    <br>  <br>  Over a LOT of time, there can be a LOT of branching ... so many, many different species can have a common ancestor.<br>  <br>  It is not a fundamental requirement of evolution that every living thing has a common ancestor.   For example, it would be perfectly compatible with evolution that just all primates have a common ancestor, or perhaps all mammals, or perhaps all animals ... and that animals could have a completely different common ancestor from, say plants, and another one for fungi, and another one for bacteria, etc.   But we have found enough evidence in the DNA of all living things that scientists are now fairly certain that all living organisms share the same ancestor.<br>  <br>  So again, this is not a *FUNDAMENTAL* part of evolution ... it is just one of its possible consequences ... and the evidence in the DNA seems to confirm it.<br>  <br>  In other words, your question is a bit like asking "Am I right in saying that gravity is the theory that the planets orbit the sun?" ... Then answer is no that is not the theory of gravity, but it is one of its consequences.|`|Heonb5DDaa	Close, in biology, evolution is change in the inherited traits of a population of organisms from one generation to the next.  Evolution says nothing about man coming from a monkey. Evolution does not even speak, directly, to how life was created, it only suggests that over millions and millions of years, organisms changed due to genetic changes.  The origin of life is only a precursor to evolution.   Because evolution takes place, evolutionary scientist theorize that all life has a common ancestor.
Ftkr9jqYaa	Water conservation ideas:<br>  <br>  The goals of water conservation efforts include:<br>  <br>  Sustainability - To ensure availability for future generations, the withdrawal of fresh water from an ecosystem should not exceed its natural replacement rate.<br>  <br>  Energy conservation - Water pumping, delivery, and wastewater treatment facilities consume a significant amount of energy. In some regions of the world (for example, California).<br>  <br>  Habitat conservation - Minimizing human water use helps to preserve fresh water habitats for local wildlife and migrating waterfowl, as well as reducing the need to build new dams and other water diversion infrastructure. <br>  <br>  Water-saving technology for the home includes:<br>  <br>  Low-flow shower heads (sometimes called energy-efficient shower heads as they also use less energy, due to less water being heated).<br>  <br>  Low-flush toilets, composting toilets and waterless urinals, which can have a dramatic impact in the developed world, as conventional<br>  <br>  Western toilets use large volumes of water.<br>  <br>  Faucet aerators, which break water flow into fine droplets to maintain "wetting effectiveness" while using less water. As a bonus, they reduce splashing while washing hands and dishes.<br>  <br>  Wastewater reuse or recycling systems, allowing:  (1) Reuse of graywater for flushing toilets or for the garden, and (2) Recycling of wastewater through purification at a water treatment plant.<br>  <br>  Waterless car wash<br>  <br>  Rainwater harvesting<br>  <br>  For crop irrigation, optimal water efficiency means minimizing losses due to evaporation or runoff. An Evaporation pan can be used to determine how much water is required to irrigate the land. Flood irrigation, the oldest and most common type, is often very uneven in distribution, as parts of a field may receive excess water in order to deliver sufficient quantities to other parts. Overhead irrigation, using center-pivot or lateral-moving sprinklers, gives a much more equal and controlled distribution pattern, but in extremely dry conditions, much of the water may evaporate before it reaches the ground. Drip irrigation is the most expensive and least-used type, but offers the best results in delivering water to plant roots with minimal losses.<br>  <br>  As changing irrigation systems can be a costly undertaking, conservation efforts often concentrate on maximizing the efficiency of the existing system. This may include chiseling compacted soils, creating furrow dikes to prevent runoff, and using soil moisture and rainfall sensors to optimize irrigation schedules.<br>  <br>  Recharge pits, which capture rainwater and runoff and use it to recharge ground water supplies. This helps in the formation of ground water wells etc. and eventually reduces soil erosion caused due to running water.<br>  <br>  1.  Any beneficial reduction in water loss, waste, or use; <br>  <br>  2.  A reduction in water use accomplished by implementation of water conservation or water efficiency measures; or, <br>  <br>  3.  Improved water management practices that reduce or enhance the beneficial use of water.  A water conservation measure is an action, behavioral change, device, technology, or improved design or process implemented to reduce water loss, waste, or use. Water efficiency is a tool of water conservation. That results in more efficient water use and thus reduces water demand. The value and cost-effectiveness of a water efficiency measure must be evaluated in relation to its effects on the use and cost of other natural resources (e.g. energy or chemicals).<br>  <br>  Water efficiency can be defined as the accomplishment of a function, task, process, or result with the minimal amount of water feasible, or an indicator of the relationships between the amount of water needed for a specific purpose and the amount of water used, occupied or delivered.

PqktefHyaa	Passion for symmetry<br>  <br>  The fact that our world does not behave perfectly symmetrically is due to deviations from symmetry at the microscopic level.<br>  <br>  As early as 1960, Yoichiro Nambu formulated his mathematical description of spontaneous broken symmetry in elementary particle physics. Spontaneous broken symmetry conceals nature's order under an apparently jumbled surface. It has proved to be extremely useful, and Nambu's theories permeate the Standard Model of elementary particle physics. The Model unifies the smallest building blocks of all matter and three of nature's four forces in one single theory.<br>  <br>  The spontaneous broken symmetries that Nambu studied, differ from the broken symmetries described by Makoto Kobayashi and Toshihide Maskawa. These spontaneous occurrences seem to have existed in nature since the very beginning of the universe and came as a complete surprise when they first appeared in particle experiments in 1964. It is only in recent years that scientists have come to fully confirm the explanations that Kobayashi and Maskawa made in 1972. It is for this work that they are now awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics. They explained broken symmetry within the framework of the Standard Model, but required that the Model be extended to three families of quarks. These predicted, hypothetical new quarks have recently appeared in physics experiments. As late as 2001, the two particle detectors BaBar at Stanford, USA and Belle at Tsukuba, Japan, both detected broken symmetries independently of each other. The results were exactly as Kobayashi and Maskawa had predicted almost three decades earlier.<br>  <br>  A hitherto unexplained broken symmetry of the same kind lies behind the very origin of the cosmos in the Big Bang some 14 billion years ago. If equal amounts of matter and antimatter were created, they ought to have annihilated each other. But this did not happen, there was a tiny deviation of one extra particle of matter for every 10 billion antimatter particles. It is this broken symmetry that seems to have caused our cosmos to survive. The question of how this exactly happened still remains unanswered. Perhaps the new particle accelerator LHC at CERN in Geneva will unravel some of the mysteries that continue to puzzle us.|`|xGkew2y3aa	Yoichiro Nambu, Makoto Kobayashi and Toshihide Maskawa<br>  <br>  <a href="http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2008/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physi...</a>

Tiph3lQcaa	There is always confusion when we are talking about the time of specific events, especially when they occur at great distances. I think it is accurate to say that the burst occurred in September as measured in the Earth reference frame. There is absolutely no way that we could have seen it or experienced it in any way any earlier. If you say it occurred 12.2 billion years ago, then you are referring to time in a different reference frame, one that is attached to a distant galaxy. <br>  <br>  Even when describing events that occur across the street, there is a very small difference in the time as perceived by the observer vs the time as experienced at the event. As long as it is understood by all people reading the article, I think it makes sense.<br>  <br>  Cerbphan - I must disagree with your disagreement, on a friendly basis of course. You are thinking that time is absolute; that it is the same everywhere and that it is based on some master reference. Relativity theory indicates that this is not the case. I fully understand what you are saying, and I guess it makes sense your way also, but I would not fault the writers unless they simply did not understand this issue - which is certainly possible. The point is, you observe things occurring in your reference frame. If they are occurring across the street, you do not say they occurred a nanosecond ago. They occurred when you saw them occur - now. If you start talking about "lookback" time, then you must admit that all the stars and galaxies are not where they appear to be. That may be technically true within millions of other reference frames, but in our frame we don't calculate the motions of all celestial objects and try to figure out where they are today based on when the light left and which way they were moving. We describe them as being where we observe them. Otherwise, you rapidly get lost in backtracking different velocity vectors - simply to change your reference frame to some arbitrary master frame which does not exist, but somehow shows where everything is "now."<br>  <br>  Time is not absolute. It is relative, and the passage of time can only be measured within your reference frame as compared to others. Events which are simultaneous within one frame (e.g. the clicking of a stopwatch and the observation of an event at a finite distance) are not simultaneous in any other frame that is moving relative to the original frame. That's what Einstein said, and he was right.<br>  <br>  I still understand what you mean, but what they said was not wrong, it was just easy to misunderstand.|`|nuhi9H6paa	It was determined that the huge gamma-ray burst occurred 12.2 billion light years away.That is in LIGHT YEARS not 12.2 billion years.<br>  The dictionary defines light year as the distance that light travels in a vacuum in 1 year which equals 5.88 trillion miles.

74952ed678a6ad90560f5a699c221b7caa	Bek may be right, but, to me, the "mean lifetime" is the lifetime observed from the stationary frame.  After all, there are no observers I know of who can ride along on a muon.      In which case T is the dialated period for decay = 2.2E-6 sec or the mean lifetime as observed from the stationary frame and no further transformation is needed to account for v = .95c.    In which case, as Bek likes to say, just plug and chug without the transformation.  That is N(t = T) = N0 e^-1 so after t = 1 mean lifetime N(t = T) = 0.367879441 N0 or about 1/3 of the original number of muons.    As these little guys are going v = .95c, it takes one on average t = L/.95c seconds = ? to travel 3 meters, where L = 3.0 km and c ~ 300E3 kps.  Plug into N(t = L/.95c) = N0 e^(L/.95cT) to find how many of the N0 starting number remain after going L = 3 meters on average.|`|92f97d29e3d55f3219cc25dfabd347c7aa	The muon lifetime gets dilated according to a stationary observer:  observed lifetime = proper lifetime * gamma  = t0 / sqrt (1 - (v/c)^2)    The time to travel a distance d is simply:  t = distance / speed    Then you can plug that flight time and the observed dilated lifetime into the exponential decay formula they give you:    N = N0 * exp (- (d/v) / (t0 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2) )  = N0 * exp (-d sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2) / (v t0) )

In part (a), to determine f(x+h) you replace (x) with (x+h) wherever it shows up in the function.    So, for f(x) = 4x -1, f(x+h) = 4(x+h) -1.    (a) f(x+h) - f(x)    = 4(x+h)  - 1 - (4x - 1)    = 4h    (b) take the result from (a) and divide it by h, giving you 4.    You shouldn't be getting an actual integer answer for any of these questions.     Part (b) looks close to the definition of a derivative, which is formally defined as    lim        f(x+h) - f(x) / h  h ->0 .    I mention this because your answer for part (b), 4, is the derivative of your original function f(x).|`|5wzrvHymaa	a)  4(x+h) - 1 - (4x - 1)       4x +4h - 1 - 4x +1       4h (your answer)    b)  4(x +h) -1 - (4x -1) / h       4x +4h -1 - 4x +1 / h       4h / h       4 (your answer)

TL1Jkqunaa	The only thing a compass does is indicate the north magnetic pole.  Different compasses use different methods to count off the different directions but the whole while the needle still and only shows north.  You use pointers to aim in any direction and then count off or read the degrees the direction you are pointing  toward is away from north.  SOme compasses will mark the angle turned in degrees, some in quadrants or directions, north, northeast, east and so on.  <br>  <br>  It sounds as if you teacher is trying to repeat something she does not really understand or in which she has no experience.

aeonmRR2aa	Galvanic cells require 2 metals.  In a copper-zinc cell, the copper plates out and the zinc is eaten (Cu2+ + Zn → Cu + Zn2+).  Zinc ions never become uncharged zinc metal in a normal battery, always the reverse, since Zinc has high oxidation energy.  You'd have to pair it with something super-reactive like magnesium or sodium to make the zinc ions turn into metal.<br>  <br>  Electrons flow from the zinc (which becomes Zn2+) to the Copper through the wire.  To balance the charge, ions flow through the salt bridge - positive ions go from the zinc side to the copper side, and some negative ions go the other way.  So you have an electrical current through the wire and a chemical current through the bridge.<br>  <br>  Eventually, yes, the ions in the salt bridge would be pushed out to one side or the other (potassium goes to copper side, chlorine mostly stays put but some would go to the zinc side), and then the two sides of the cell would become contaminated once zinc starts going through the salt bridge to the copper side.<br>  <br>  In a hydrogen half-cell it's a lot more confusing so just consider the copper-zinc version.

However, in a galvanic cell, a salt bridge lets ions flow between the electrolytes in the oxidation side and those in the reduction side of the cell, so that balance in charge is maintained between them, whilst they are kept separate.

The number of phenotypes produced for a given trait depends on how many genes control that trait. <br>  <br>  Genotype determines phenotype.  However, since animals have two copies (alleles) of each gene (one from their mother and one from their father) and since many genes may be involved in determining a single phenotypic trait, it is gene expression that actually determines phenotype.  The affect of gene expression on phenotype is generally thought of as being either additive or non-additive.  Additive gene action occurs when the phenotypic effect of one gene adds to the phenotypic effect of another gene.  The other gene may be the other allele of the first gene or may be some other gene in genome of the animal.  When the gene expression is non-additive, the phenotypic expression of one gene doesn't necessarily add to the phenotypic expression of another gene.|`|mZcdC90Uaa	Let's say you have big Y for yellow and y for green. if you have a pea plant that gives Yy and combine another that has yy you will get either Yy, Yy,yy, or yy that is the gentotype and phenotype is the look of your outcome the Yy is going to give you a yellow offspring while yy is going to give you green offspring.

AA10921456	Water does not expand when it freezes - as water is cooled to 4.1 C is contracts like any other liquid, from 4.1 to 0C it expands and from zero down contracts. So when water freezes in a pipe at two points any liquid trapped between these points which is still going from 4.1 to 0C will expand and put pressure on the pipe.

HTmj2BXDaa	Hawaii is right.  The difference between rough and smooth surfaces is the difference in the number and height/depth of the bumps.  Even a "smooth" surface has microscopic hills and valleys.  Even a microscopically flat surface has atomic hills and valleys.  Two smooth surfaces can have much more real surface contact than two rough surfaces but it is a little more complicated than just smoothness/roughness.  The hardness of the surface is also a big factor.  If the two smooth surfaces are very hard (so the peaks do not get mashed down under the contact force), then the amount of real surface contact may not go up very much.  If the two surfaces are soft and/or the atoms/molecules on the surfaces are "receptive" to each other, the two objects may bond together and become one object.|`|FqQs0ZTMaa	Hey, just to clarify something here: You need to separate between the friction coefficient μ, and the friction force (let's call it R). <br>  <br>  R is (the weight the object inflicts perpendicular to the floor) x (the friction coefficient of the surface, μ). <br>  <br>  The larger surface the weight is spread on, the less the friction force will be (which is why you get a better grip with racing bikes than off-road bikes on sealed roads). However it is μ (the friction coefficient) which tells you how "smooth" or "rough" the surface is.|`|pv6ElKdRaa	There can be a lot of friction on a smooth surface - like when you fall and slide on a basketball court - because more of the object (in this case - your skin) is in contact with the surface.|`|PGvxouUzaa	isnt the opposite applied|`|VkwrVPQHaa	It's not.

ArKT9O7Maa	Neurons are the single most important thing in the body.  They transmit electrical impulses using the ions Na+ (a positive sodium ion) and a potassium ion (i cannot recall whether it is positive or negative, but i know there is one).  These are coded messages just like all language, but can most easily be compared to binary or Morse code.  The different lengths of impulses, as well as how powerful they are, affect how your brain translates it into something you understand in you little conscious mind (Only a small percentage of the brain is used for independent sentient thought it humans, the rest is subconsciously used for the five senses and muscle control).

dGN8YoEQaa	From this website: <a href="http://elasmodiver.com/shark_senses.htm" rel="nofollow">http://elasmodiver.com/shark_senses.htm</a><br>  <br>  Smell:<br>  <br>  The olfactory ability in sharks is well known, although the idea that sharks are able to detect and follow a drop of blood diluted in the ocean over many miles is an exaggeration.  <br>  <br>  Sharks possess a pair of nares, nostril-like holes that are located just under the leading edge of the snout. Each nare is divided by a nasal flap into two openings. Water is channeled into the incurrent aperture and having passed over the olfactory lamellae exits the olfactory sac through the excurrent aperture. The olfactory lamellae are a series of folds on the interior surface of the olfactory sac which increase the surface area giving the shark more opportunity to register smells. Odors passing over the olfactory lamellae stimulate the cilia-like endings of neuro-sensory cells. What actually happens is, dissolved molecules transported along in the water column bind to receptor cells which then send a signal to the brain. This is referred to as a chemosensory function.<br>  <br>  Sharks have olfactory bulbs which are anterior extensions of the large olfactory lobe in the fore-brain that lead directly into the olfactory sacs. fibers in the olfactory bulb continue directly into the olfactory tract. With such advanced hardware it is not surprising that sharks are able to detect fish extracts in concentrations lower than 1 part in 10 billion!<br>  <br>  Once a shark picks up a scent trail it swims up the trail moving its head from side to side (which is its natural swimming motion). As its snout passes backwards and forwards through the scent trail it is able to determine the direction from which the odor is emanating. If the scent is lost or if the slick is too wide to use for navigation, the shark may swim forward in an exaggerated S pattern until it can pick up the direction again.<br>  <br>  The nares are completely seperate from the mouth and throat and therefore do not aid at all in respiration. In order to detect odors, sedentary species are able to pump water over the nares whilst resting on the sea floor. Not all sharks require a highly developed olfactory system. Whilst sense of smell may be the prime hunting tool for an Oceanic whitetip shark swimming along in the featureless ocean, an angel shark laying in wait for a meal is primarily a visual predator and consequently its olfactory sense is not so finely tuned. However, odor detection is not only used in hunting. Sharks and rays produce pheromones which signal their reproductive state to potential mates and smell may also be used in navigation.<br>  <br>  Oceanic whitetip sharks have been seen with their snouts out of the water supposedly sniffing the air. This may allow them to detect odors over far greater distances than would be possible under water.   <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  Electroreception is discussed in the above website as well and it helps them identify prey but is independent of smell.|`|2e53e0edd43c14c6df942d701151ec61aa	You better do better research than this.<br>  <br>  The common conception is that sharks are rapidly attracted to blood in the water and will go into a feeding frenzy. Sharks are attracted to offal so something in cut up flesh attracts them. But more amazing is their ability to detect changes in electrical fields which helps them sense prey. That sensitivity is astronishing.

Ftkr9jqYaa	There are two families of EFAs: ω-3 (or omega-3 or n?3) and ω-6 (omega-6, n?6). Fats from each of these families are essential, as the body can convert one omega-3 to another omega-3, as well as one omega-6 to another omega-6, but cannot create an omega-3 from omega-6 or saturated fats; nor can an omega-6 be created from an omega-3 or saturated fats.<br>  <br>  The essential fatty acids start with the short chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (SC-PUFA):<br>  <br>  (1) ω-3 fatty acids: <br>  α-LINOLENIC ACID or ALA (18:3) <br>  <br>  (2) ω-6 fatty acids: <br>  LINOLEIC ACID or LA (18:2) <br>  <br>  The above two fatty acids cannot be synthesised by humans, as humans lack the desaturase enzymes required for their production.  They could be said to be the two essential fatty acids.<br>  <br>  They form the starting point for the creation of longer and more desaturated fatty acids, which are also referred to as long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA):<br>  <br>  (A) ω-3 fatty acids:<br>  <br>  eicosapentaenoic acid or EPA (20:5) <br>  docosahexaenoic acid or DHA (22:6) <br>  <br>  (B) ω-6 fatty acids: <br>  <br>  gamma-linolenic acid or GLA (18:3) <br>  dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid or DGLA (20:3) <br>  arachidonic acid or AA (20:4) <br>  <br>  ω-9 fatty acids are not essential in humans, because humans generally possess all the enzymes required for their synthesis. Exceptions do occur in older people or people with a liver problem that do not completely produce a sufficient amount, and hence many supplement companies market Omega 3-6-9 blends.  Thus, ω-9 fatty acids could be characterized as semi-essential, as could the LC-PUFAs listed in groups (A) and (B) above, such as EPA and DHA.

JJCSEe3Taa	Sicle cell anemia is a genetic disorder in which your red blood cells are a sickle shape instead of a round shape. This reduces oxygen supplies to organs and muscles.    Haemophilia is when blood clotting is inefficient. In severe cases if you get a cut it may take days or weaks for you to stop bleeding however the bleeding is not as intense.|`|CYtMRC4eaa	Sickle cell anemia is an autosomal recessive trait which causesa variation in the 6th amino acid in one of the hemoglobin polypeptides. Under certain circumstances, the hemoglobin crystallizes, causing the erythrocyte to take on a "sickle" shape;  this is very painful.  In the homozygous  condition, it is frequently fatal.    Hemophilia is sometimes called "bleeder's" disease, because one or more of the 7 or 8 complex reactions that cause blood to clot are not functioning correctly.  The most common form is a sex-linked condition.  These days, hemophilia can usually be controlled by the addition of the missing  or non-functioning factors.  Hemophilia is extremely rare in women...|`|X4EBNoNUaa	Classical sickle cell anemia is a mutation in the beta chains of hemoglobin..wherein a polar amino acid (glutamic acid ) is exchanged for a non-polar amino acid leucine. The resultant section of the chain is more non-polar and has a sticky patch which causes hemoglobin to polymerize in spar shaped elongated structures. This causes deformation of the RBC to a sickle shape..it cannot elongate properly to "fit " through small vessels and the hemoglobin does not undergo the Bohr Effect very well ..which means it cannot bind nor release oxygen efficiently. The mutation developed evolutionarily to prevent invasion of the RBC by the malaria organism. Royal family hemophilia is caused by a genetic deficiency of factor 8. Factor eight in the intrinsic blood clotting pathway is converted to factor 8a which acts to anchor and stabilize the 10ase complex that is necessary for activating prothrombin to thrombin ( thrombin acts on fibrin in the presence of platelets, phospholipids, and calcium to form the soft clot, and thrombin activates factor 13 to 13a which crosslinks the soft clot to make a hard clot. So lack of factor 8 results in a weak and destabilized 10ase which which results in an interference with blood clotting|`|046668252b7d273d3a4a3a6908a8607daa	Haemophilia- very simply, the blood lacks a component needed to help it clot meaning that if the person is cut or injured then they bleed uncontrollably.    Sickle cell anaemia- blood cells are 'c' shaped instead of being shaped like donoughts with no holes (which is what a healthy person's blood cells look like). This causes them to be sticky and stick together causing pain and problems when they block blood vessels, meaning the person is in 'sickle cell crisis'.|`|AA11531880	Sickle cell anemia is when as mutation causes blood cells to be created in a sicle shape, instead of round, not allowing them to carry oxygen through the body, resulting in health problems.

The cells are sickle shaped (like a crescent) instead of round, greatly reducing their space for oxygen.    Hemophilia is a disease that keeps blood from being able to clot. In other words, if you get a cut your blood does not thicken around the cut and you can bleed to death if not treated.    Hope that helps!

9Wi2eNInaa	It depends on the water speed coming from your penstock (hose?)    Pelto wheels do well in low volume but high "head" (High water pressure conditions)    Reaction turbines ,like the Kaplan work best with high volumes and low head conditions.  See the following link to figure out which is the best turbine for you  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_turbi...    I am going to assume you are using city water pressure coming out of a hose for your water force. That pressure is somewhere in the 80 pounds per square inch pressure zone. This would be considered low volume and fairly high pressure, so a Pelton style wheel would be the most efficient    The whole idea of your pelton wheel design is to make your water deflect 180 degrees if possible. The more the water reverses itself the more power you extract from the water.    If you didn't let the pelton wheel move, the water sprayed on the curved "spoons" would just spray the water virtually right back at the source of the spray.    But to generate power the pelton wheel does turn and as it turns it absorbs the moving energy of that water as the water's momentum is being reversed.     The most power you will get out of the pelton is the point where you spray the water at the spoons and instead of the water reversing direction on the spoons it falls down vertically because the moving pelton blade has absorbed all the energy from the moving water.    So what you have to do is figure out the optimum load on your pelton wheel. If you put a generator on the pelton wheel , put a variable resistor there and then measure the maximum voltage output and current you get from your generator.    Like I said, if you put to much load by using to big of a generator, the water being sprayed on the pelton wheel will just reverse it's direction and you won't get the maximum power from the water.    You have to vary the load until you find that optimum power production point    By the way, gears don't make more power, in fact they take away power from the friction of turning them.     Make all your power production come from the angle of your pelton spoons and the diameter of the wheel, and the fine tuning of the load you put on it    By the way again, table spoons make  actually make fairly good pelton blades (make a plywood round circle and glue the spoons to the plywood. calculate how many spoons you need with say a 12 inch wood circle (maybe 12 tablespoons) or so)    The other thing is the generator you use. You want a generator that develops maximum power at a rather low RPM , otherwise you will have to gear up the pelton wheel to get the appropriate RPM's of your generator. If your generator develops full current at 500 RPM's then you have to gear up your pelton wheel to get that 500 rpm's. Usually the smaller the diameter of the pelton wheel , the faster the rpm's. Try to avoid gears at any cost, they use up to much power    Another idea, but you will need gears , is to use the back wheel off of a 20" bmx bike and duct tape the spoons every 5" or so (even spacing what ever that may be) all around the perimeter of the wheel (remove rubber tire of course) . put the chain around the biggest sprocket and attach a small sprocket to your generator. You have to figure out your own gear ration , depending on what your generator needs for max power. Spray the water as close to perpendicular to the spoon surface as possible, and get the nozzle as close to the spoon as possible. Figure it out as the water turns one spoon and ends at the base that the next spoon on the circle is right there to begin taking the new force. In other words, don't have big gaps between your spoons, because your spoons are what make the power    Pu a plastic shroud around your pelton wheel , because you will get a ton of water spray|`|xMfkVm39aa	you could research the topic. my thoughts would be that the turbine generates more electricity either through higher rotational velocities or more torque applied to the wheel. you could set up a series of gears to maximize velocity or torque

OEj4EZu5aa	This is what I think (disclaimer: I am not sure if these are right!):    For the addition one:    AB = VT, and the property states "A = B". So A = AB and B = VT. Now C can be either CD or XY, as they are equal. Plug these into the a + c = b + c equation, and you get:    AB + CD = VT + CD.     For the subtraction one:    Same idea. RS + TP = RS + MN. So you are adding something to the RS each time and getting the same answer. This means that TP = MN. Again, the property states "If a = b". a = TP, b = MN. C will be the left over variables, RS. So plug it into the a - c = b - c equation, and you get:    TP - RS = MN - RS    Hope I helped.

159af8323864a89fbd6da78461d571f4aa	Usually they are caused by plate tectonics.  The plates are moving and it builds up strain which is suddenly released in an earthquake.  Volcanoes and other things can cause earthquakes.|`|Gnfc4wRlaa	An earthquake is the shaking of the ground caused by an abrupt shift of rock along a fracture in the Earth, called a fault. Within seconds, an earthquake releases stress that has slowly accumulated within the rock, sometimes over hundreds of years.  The device used to record them is a seismograph.    The Richter magnitude of an earthquake is determined from the logarithm of the amplitude of waves recorded by seismographs.  Because of the logarithmic basis of the scale, each whole number increase in magnitude represents a tenfold increase in measured amplitude; in terms of energy, each whole number increase corresponds to an increase of about 31.6 times the amount of energy released.    Richter Value  Type       Effect  Less than 2.0  Micro     Micro-earthquakes, not felt.  2.0-2.9       Minor     Generally not felt, but recorded.  3.0-3.9            Minor      Often felt, but rarely causes damage.  4.0-4.9       Light     Noticeable shaking of indoor items, rattling      ------------------------------------nois... Significant damage unlikely.  5.0-5.9      Moderate  Major damage to poorly constructed buildings over small regions. Slight damage to well-designed buildings.  6.0-6.9       Strong     Can be destructive in areas up to about 160   ------------------------------------km (100 mi) across in populated areas.  7.0-7.9       Major     Can cause serious damage over larger areas.  8.0-8.9       Great     Can cause serious damage in areas several hundred miles across.  9.0-9.9            Great      Devastating in areas several thousand miles across.  10.0+        Epic     Never recorded      Plate tectonics confirms that there are four types of seismic zones. The first follows the line of midocean ridges. Activity is low, and it occurs at very shallow depths. The point is that the lithosphere is very thin and weak at these boundaries, so the strain cannot build up enough to cause large earthquakes. Associated with this type of seismicity is the volcanic activity along the axis of the ridges (for example, Iceland, Azores, Tristan da Cunha).    The second type of earthquake associated with plate tectonics is the shallow-focus event unaccompanied by volcanic activity. The San Andreas fault is a good example of this, so is the Anatolian fault in Northern Turkey. In these faults, two mature plates are scraping by one another. The friction between the plates can be so great that very large strains can build up before they are periodically relieved by large earthquakes. Nevertheless, activity does not always occur along the entire length of the fault during any one earthquake. For instance, the 1906 San Francisco event was caused by breakage only along the northern end of the San Andreas fault.    The third type of earthquake is related to the collision of oceanic and continental plates. One plate is thrust or subducted under the other plate so that a deep ocean trench is produced. In the Philippines, ocean trenches are associated with curved volcanic island arcs on the landward plate, for example the Java trench. Along the Peru - Chile trench, the Nazca plate is being subducted under the South American plate which responds by crumpling to form the Andes. This type of earthquake can be shallow, intermediate, or deep, according to its location on the downgoing lithospheric slab. Such inclined planes of earthquakes are know as Benioff zones.    The fourth type of seismic zone occurs along the boundaries of continental plates. Typical of this is the broad swath of seismicity from Burma to the Mediterranean, crossing the Himalayas, Iran, Turkey, to Gilbraltar. Within this zone, shallow earthquakes are associated with high mountain ranges where intense compression is taking place. Intermediate- and deep-focus earthquakes also occur and are known in the Himalayas and in the Caucasus. The interiors of continental plates are very complex, much more so than island arcs. For instance, we do not yet know the full relationship of the Alps or the East African rift system to the broad picture of plate tectonics.

The organs of the gastrointestinal tract include the mouth, pharynx, oesophagus, stomach, small intestine and large intestine. The accessory organs include the teeth, tongue, salivary glands, gallbladder, liver and pancreas. <br>  <br>  Mouth<br>  Food is ingested into the gastrointestinal tract through the mouth, or oral cavity. Associated accessory organs such as the teeth, tongue and salivary glands begin the processes of mechanical and chemical digestion through mastication. The mouth also begins the propulsive process of swallowing.<br>  <br>  Pharynx<br>  From the mouth, food is passed into the oropharynx and then to the laryngopharynx. Sequential contractions of the muscles in the wall of the gastrointestinal tract create a peristaltic wave, squeezing the food into the oesophagus.<br>  <br>  Oesophagus<br>  Contraction of the muscular wall of the oesophagus creates a peristaltic wave which continues to propel the food along the gastrointestinal tract and into the stomach.<br>  <br>  Stomach<br>  The stomach acts as a temporary storage site for food where chemical digestion of proteins begins, and food is converted into chyme. Mechanical digestion is also carried out as peristaltic waves mix the food with gastric juice. A few fat soluble substances are also absorbed through the lining of the stomach into the blood stream.<br>  <br>  Small Intestine<br>  The small intestine is the body’s main digestive organ, where digestion is completed and virtually all the absorption of the digestion products into the blood stream occurs. Mechanical digestion and propulsion of the food through the gastrointestinal tract is achieved by the alternate contraction of the smooth muscles of the small intestine wall. Enzymes conveyed via ducts from the pancreas, liver and gallbladder (accessory organs), together with enzymes secreted from the cells lining the small intestine function to chemically digest the food. The soluble digestion products are taken up into the blood stream by passive and active mechanisms.<br>  <br>  Large Intestine<br>  The large intestine functions to absorb water from the indigestible food residues in its lumen, and then remove the semi-solid faces from the body through defecation. Faces are propelled through large intestine via peristaltic waves, mass movements and haustral churning. Defecation is a reflex action which is triggered by rectal distension.|`|HxXduL1maa	The digestive tract, alimentary canal, or gastrointestinal tract, is a mucous-lined tube that runs from the mouth to the anus.

4fWZL4TRaa	It is not really possible to use the motor directly. Although you can try to use capacitors to produce the other phases, the voltage isn't there, and the motor would be seriously derated. Don't go there.<br>  <br>  You didn't mention the motor power. The single phase supply, limited to 240 x 15A perhaps, is under 5 HP. Whatever the motor rating is in HP or KW (mechanical output), the supply is about 20% more to allow for motor losses (efficiency).<br>  <br>  The most likely device you can get if there is sufficient supply is a single phase to three phase VFD (electronic motor speed controller). This is like an inverter. You buy one that uses the single phase supply to produce a three phase supply of appropriate voltage and frequency to run the motor. You have to allow another 20% for losses. Allowing for motor losses and inverter losses, the mechanical rating is 60-70% of the power needed. This means that from a single phase supply of 3600W you might expect to run a 3 HP motor (2.4kW mechanical output). This is really the best choice, as the controller probably gives a lot of other functions, including a programmed start-up.<br>  <br>  There are also rotary inverters of various types (similar to a motor and generator). Some combine the motor and three phase generator. If it was me I would go for the VFD.<br>  <br>  Another solution that may be cheaper if it is possible is a new single phase motor. It may or may not have the starting torque, is physically bigger, and runs rougher. You will be limited to about 5 HP size maximum.<br>  <br>  About power rating, it is possible the motor is bigger than required for some reason.

nuhi9H6paa	There are a lot of rumors, weak though they might be, to predict that we're all going to die in 2012. Doomsayers whom manipulate the facts about these scientific studies often have a book to sell or some other gimmick. They know that by instilling fear upon the public they can achieve notoriety and financial profit! <br>  <br>  However, there's one significant fact that the 2012 doomsayers all seem to forget: Despite all the various 2012-ish predictions for the end of the world, there are far more stories of apocalypse with different dates. For example, popular interpretations of Nostradamus found predictions for the end of the world in July of 1999, December of 1999, June of 2002, and October of 2005. It's also been said that his writings could mean the dead will rise from their graves in either 2000, 2007, or the year 7000. Nostradamus never said anything about 2012. <br>  <br>  A number of Bible scholars found firm scriptural evidence that the Rapture would happen in October of 2005. Thousands of Koreans gave away all their money and possessions in preparation for the Rapture on October 28, 1992. Even Sir Isaac Newton made a calculation based on scripture that showed the Rapture could not happen before 2060. Some Jewish scholars place the "end of days" via Armageddon in the year 2240. I couldn't find 2012 mentioned in any of these stories.<br>  <br>  In fact, James Randi's magnum opus publication An Encyclopedia of Claims, Frauds, and Hoaxes of the Occult and Supernatural lists 44 distinct end of the world predictions that all came and went unfulfilled. <br>  <br>  There is no astronomical indication of the existence of another large planet in the inner solar system. Look at Jupiter. Literally! It's about ten times the diameter of the Earth, and it's on average about 750 million kilometers (450 million miles) away. It is easily visible to the naked eye, and in fact is usually the fourth or fifth brightest object in the sky.<br>  <br>  Yet, for Planet X to be here in less then a decade, it can't be farther than a billion or so kilometers away. Even at that distance, it would be one of the brightest objects in the sky. Even if it were too faint to be seen with the naked eye, it would still be seen easily.

Satanists and many pagan cultures from every corner of the world all throughout history have celebrated this like the Sumerians, Babylonians, Cherokee, Hopi, Chinese I-Ching (confirmed by Terence McKenna), Mayans (Pacal Votan; Chilam Balam of Tizimin, Mani, Chumayel; Jaguar Prophet), Egyptians, Celts, etc. This evil event is called "the abomination that causes desolation" that will be set up in the Jewish Temple's Holy of Holies when the antichrist is imbued with the spirit of satan himself.

OXsRXLx1aa	Each copper atom has 12 nearby neighbors. It's crystal structure is Cubic which is one of the densest atomic crystalline structures existing. This limits the distance between the atoms and allows for very easy electron sharing between them.<br>  <br>  PVC is a polymer, and most polymers have no crystalline structure being a random mess of long molecules that are simply mixed together to form a slightly elastic compound.<br>  <br>  Cation is a positively charged molecule, so saying that the copper atoms turn slightly cationic when they are sharing electrons probably isn't a poor saying. I'm sure it could be more correct scientifically but it seems to be sound (makes sense) to me. It's not so much the size of the atoms as the space between them. Subatomic forces are quite minuscule compared to other effects, but if you have done research of your own and found reputable sources that say large atoms are better for transferring electrons (note: not neutrons such as a Uranium atom would be good at donating ;)  ) then go for it.|`|PvVs4VIzaa	I think you miss out the energy band structure part, which the band gap within metal is relatively small compare to insulator like PVC.

hR5XChWmaa	Don't worry you will not die but consequences vary from individuals and you are experiencing the side effects. Your body is just tring to get rid of the toxins and to flush them out so vomiting as unpleasant as it is, its actually a very good sign. You may also be in shock from your actions which are leading to other side effects. Its going to take some time for your body to recover. I know of many people who have tried to overdose on a lot more and didn't die having said that your actions where wrong and each individuals body reacts differently to things. There are often no symptoms in the first 24 hours following overdose, although there may be mild nausea and vomiting. In a large overdose liver function deteriorates leading to jaundice, confusion, and loss of consciousness. Death is rare but when it occurs it is due to liver failure. Any patient should be considered at risk of severe liver damage if he/she has ingested more than 150mg paracetamol/kg body weight, or, in adults, more than 12g (24 standard tablets), whichever is the smaller.Please go and see the hospital just to make sure that the pills have left your bloodstream and not poisoned your blood. I had a friend who took five of them with caffeine and a glass of wine and when she went hospital they were not helpful leaving her alone for hours, then after so long taking a blood test and making her wait hours again and then dismissed her with no feedback but your fine and she had to make her own way home with a taxi but the main thing is to go and reassure yourself that all is completely fine.<br>  If things have led to this act of despair try talking to someone and get well soon.

Many well known poisons are salts of heavy metals like mercury and silver; these denature the protein strands wherever they touch them. The common first aid antidote for swallowing a heavy-metal poison is to drink milk. The poison then acts on the protein of the milk rather than on the protein sites and tissues of the mouth, esophagus, and stomach.

UFteXlqwaa	Nobody knows and that's scary enough, isn't it?<br>  <br>  But what do you mean by: rises six degrees Celsius? The average temperature on earth is today 15 C. If it rises six degrees, it is then 21 C. But how about the distribution?<br>  <br>  You see, we measure the temperature at sea level. But it falls with an average of 0.65 C per 100 meters. At the top of the troposphere, the temperature is perhaps -50 C. Will that also increase by six degrees? If so, why?<br>  <br>  At the equator, the top of the troposphere, called the tropopause, is about twice the altitude than over the poles. That is because warmer air is less dense and you need more of it to have an equal pressure.<br>  <br>  If the surface temperature increases, there will be more moisture in the air. Right above the sea, the air is 100 percent saturated and contains, at 15 C, about 13 grams of water per cubic meter. If the temperature increases, there will be more water in the air. But as that warm moist air rises, it cools down and form clouds that increases the albedo of the earth: sunlight is being reflected.<br>  <br>  How would that increase of temperature affect our climates? We try to answer that with models but the truth is; we don't have proper models because we haven't experienced this before or, at least, not in a way that was recordable.<br>  <br>  Some predict more storms, more droughts, more ... everything. Perhaps but ... can we trust that? Let me give you an example:<br>  <br>  The global warming we can observe now is not even. Mostly it is detected over the north pole, then some over the south pole, but the temperature at the equator remains constant.<br>  <br>  One probable reason is that it is then northern hemisphere that releases most of the CO2 and that, with the Coriolis effect, moves toward the pole.<br>  <br>  But storms in the winter are caused by the great difference between the equator and the pole that is then very cold. Storms are not cause by temperature but by the difference of temperature between two air masses.<br>  <br>  If the north pole warms up but not the equator, it would mean lesser strorms, right?<br>  <br>  I agree that the global warming is scary but the doomsday prophets often are those who do climatic research and, like any researchers, they need funds. And money is what make the world to go round and print the tabloid newspapers.|`|UsToYasiaa	it will be hotter.especially on the countries lying near the equator
vPI1hVGUaa	The Aloe plant is quite an easy plant to grow and care for. It requires well-drained sandy soil and shouldn't be placed in direct sunlight. Moderate light is sufficient. If the plant is a pot plan then you should ensure that the plant is completely dry before watering again. Too much water will do more harm than good! <br>  <br>  Growing Aloe Vera<br>  Light - Most Aloe species make excellent house plants when they are given enough light. If they are grown outdoors in warm climates, they should be planted in full sun, or light shade. Potted Aloes benefit from spending the summer outdoors. Because Aloe plants consist of mostly water, they are extremely sensitive to frost.<br>  <br>  Soil - The soil should be sandy, moderately fertile, and drain well. Aloes have roots that are shallow and spread so when it is time to repot them pick a wide pot, they are better than deep ones. Fertilize yearly, in the spring with a half strength, bloom type fertilizer (10-40-10). Do not over fertilize. New plants may also be grown from seed or propagated from the offsets around the base of mature plants.<br>  <br>  Water - Established plants will survive a drought quite well. During the winter months, the plant will become somewhat dormant, and utilize very little moisture. During this period watering should be minimal. During the summer months, the soil should be completely soaked, but then be allowed to dry again before giving the plant a cup or two of water.|`|41519dcd613e198147ae134a0f6e6e78aa	Aloevera is flowering these days.

4qvrm5xQaa	Your proposed course of action is the only solution, because the process cannot be reversed when the action of viscosity is considered.<br>  <br>  Rigid container means the volume of the gas does not change.  Perfectly insulated means that neither heat nor mass can enter or leave the container.<br>  <br>  Assume the gas is initially "at rest" in the container.  The paddle wheel simply adds kinetic energy to the gas via the introduction of a net swirling motion to the gas.<br>  <br>  In order for the gas to return to its original state of rest, the KE that was added must be removed.  But all subsequent processes are subject to the action of viscosity.<br>  <br>  The action of viscosity against the sidewalls of the container alone will eventually cause the fluid motion to stop.  Like friction, the loss of KE can be accounted for by a rise in the temperature of the gas.  Because everything is perfectly insulated, there is no way to remove that additional heat from the gas.<br>  <br>  Moving the paddle introduces more KE to the gas.  Cooling the container doesn't matter because of the insulation.  Trying to having the gas push on the paddle doesn't matter because the gas swirls all the way to the motionless sidewalls of the container far from the paddle, and that where viscosity will do its thing.|`|FQiqtP33aa	In case of Adiabatic process there is no exchange of energy.<br>  <br>  But as you are rotating the stirrer how are u doing it ? is it done by any external means. if it is then u are giving external energy.

KHeR3hGIaa	From A to B, the PE (potential energy, elastic energy) stored in the rope is zero.  (The rope isn't tight yet.)<br>  <br>  Starting at B, the PE in the rope starts increasing.  Assuming that the rope is a perfect spring (which is probably a good approximation until it starts reaching the limits of it's stretchyness), the PE is proportional to the distance between B and the person at the end of the rope.<br>  <br>  So, at C there's a significant amount of PE stored in the rope, and at D there's over twice what is stored at C (assuming that your drawing is to scale.)  And then when the person goes back to C, there's the same amount of PE stored as there was the first time he passed C.<br>  <br>  If you were to graph the PE vs time, it would be zero for a while, then start increasing, reach a maximum, then go down to a non-zero value where it stays.

xIisVcLTaa	Probably the best place to start this discussion would be the De Broglie relationship, which says lambda = h/p<br>  <br>  or in English, the wavelength (lambda) of matter is equal to: Planck's constant (h) over the momentum (p).<br>  <br>  If we think about this, a small "particle" such as a proton or electron has a tiny momentum, so a reasonably large wavelength. <br>  <br>  However, a macroscopic object has much more momentum and therefore an extremely small wavelength.

(give or take a 2pi)<br>  <br>  Planck's constant (h) is VERY small, so the minimum uncertainties in momentum and position which the equation mandates are SMALL in absolute terms.  For macroscopic bodies (like you, me and the dog), these uncertainties are absolutely insignificant in percentage terms.  However for particles, these uncertainties can form a significant fraction of the actual values of these parameters (ie. p and X).

Gmvldblraa	Only the light from lasers is coherent. It means that the stream of photons that constitute a beam of light have their vibrations all in step with each other. Think of a series of sine waves. If the waves all move up at the same time, they will also move down at the same time - they are in step, they are coherent.<br>  Light from the Sun, light from a light bulb, consists of photons that are not in step. <br>  Coherence can be forced on very weak beams of light by letting photons through a single slit, whereupon the light diffracts outwards and if then passed through twin slits will form two coherent beams which can then form a regular interference pattern. And its forming interference patterns that  you want coherent light for.

tv2e834uaa	DDT is a very effective poison that was used as an insecticide. It is persistent, that means it doesn't breakdown easily. DDT used 50 years ago still shows up in soil samples and in animal tissues. In food chains the chemical was accumulated as you went up the chain. Birds that ate contaminated insects were contaminated, and creatures that ate them were in turn infused with DDT. The DDT had numerous harmful effects on organisms like thin shells in bird eggs so the eggs broke before they hatched. In food chains it accumulates so that animals higher on the food chain tend to have greater concentrations of the chemical in their tissues.|`|CjJKUMl8aa	It's a synthetic pesticides.

Men with fertilty problems are often advised to wear loose boxers x|`|AA10854273	Some discoveries made early in the present century2 have awakened a genuinely scientific interest in the question of sex determination and control. For the last two decades biologists have been attacking the problem with greater energy and with increased prospects of success. By varying the conditions of nutrition, moisture, and other factors, they have been able to control to a limited extent the sex of some of the lower animals. During this period of investigation there have appeared in Science some two dozen notes, articles, and book-reviews dealing with the subject.<br>  <br>  The war, too, has brought the question into the foreground. A newspaper despatch from London in November, 1920, calls attention to the higher percentage of male babies since the war and goes on to say: "The doctors of England are discussing the peculiar manner in which nature is replacing the immense wastage of men during the war." There is, of course, a well-established popular notion about the increase in the number of boys during critical periods. It has been pointed out that a distinct increase in proportion of male babies has taken place among primitive peoples in times of stress and famine, or when tribes are in danger of extermination, as in the case of the head-hunting Dyaks of Borneo.<br>  <br>  The research work of modern biologists gives more than a passing interest to the views of the ancients on sex determination. Aside from this, greater contemporary interest in folklore would justify an investigation of the notions of the Greeks and Romans.<br>  <br>  p63 In antiquity the custom of ancestor worship, the perpetuation of which required a son, since the daughter went off into another gens,a was, perhaps, the strongest reason that led parents to long for male children. There was the additional consideration that the boy was a much more likely means of support for old age. The arrival of a boy was so much more welcome than that of a girl, and the natural desire of expectant parents to answer in advance the question of the sex of the coming child was so strong, that a search was made for indications of sex, and even for means to control it.<br>  <br>  There was a common view that the male offspring comes from the right side of the male and the female from the left side,4 and that the embryo developed in the right side of the uterus was male while that in the left side was female. Only when there was an alteration in the course of nature did exceptions to this rule occur. If during intercourse the right or left testis was tied up, the result was, according to some philosophers, male or female offspring respectively7. Empedocles asserted that heat gave rise to males and cold to females. "Hence it is, as histories acquaint us, that the first men had their original from the earth in the eastern and southern parts, and the first females in the northern parts thereof. Parmenides is of opinion perfectly contrarient. He affirms that men first sprouted out of the northern earth, for their bodies are more dense; women out of the southern, for theirs are more rare and fine.<br>  <br>  Democritus of Abdera opposed Empedocles' view, and said that sex depended on the parent whose semen it was that predominated . He maintained that the parts which are common to both sexes are engendered indifferently by one or the other, but the peculiar parts by the sex that is more prevalent . Hippon said that the compact and strong sperm produced one sex and the more fluid and weaker the other,and that if the spermatic faculty be more effectual the male is generated; if the nutritive element predominates, the female is generated. Hippocrates speaks in somewhat similar vein. He holds that there is both male and female semen, and that when females are born the stronger element is overpowered by the abundance of weaker, and vice versa, that the birth of males is due to the overpowering of the weaker element .13 The condition of the menses may also prove a factor, according to Hippocrates .<br>  <br>  Aristotle thus summarizes a long discussion of his own views: "If, then, the male element prevails, it draws the female element into itself; but if it is prevailed over, it changes into the opposite or is destroyed.<br>  <br>   He makes other interesting comments: "For more females are produced by the young and by those verging on old age than by those in the prime of life; in the former the vital heat is not yet perfect, in the latter it is failing. And those of a moister and more feminine state of body are more wont to beget females, and a liquid semen causes this more than a thicker; now all these characteristics come from a deficiency in natural heat.<br>  <br>  "Again, more males are born if copulation takes place when north than when south winds are blowing. For in the latter case the animals produce more secretion, and too much secretion is hard to concoct; hence the semen of the males is more liquid, and so is the discharge of the catamenia".<br>  <br>  Plants have certain properties by which they cause the conception of one sex or the other. The male plant of the parthenion ensures the conception of male children, the female plant of females, but only if immediately after conception its juice is drunk in raisin-wine and the leaves are eaten cooked in olive oil and salt, or raw in vinegar. The lower part of the stem of the satyrion promotes the conception of male issue, the upper or smaller part of female . Female offspring will result from taking thelygonon in drink, male by taking arsenogonon. If before the evening meal, a man and a woman take three oboli of the seed of crataegonon in three cyathi of water forty days before the convention of their issue, the child will be of the male sex  If males eat the larger portions of the roots of cynosorchis or orchis, they will be parents of boys; if females eat the smaller parts, girls will result. The female phyllon plant ensures the conception of issue of the same sex, while the male plant, differing only in its seed, brings about male issue . When a drink made from the crushed leaves of the female plant of the linozostis is taken and an application of them is made to the genitals after purgation, the conception of females is ensured, while males result from similar treatment of the male plant .<br>  <br>  The flesh of certain parts of animals has magical properties in ensuring the conception of male children. If, about the time of conception, a woman eats roasted veal with aristolochia,b she will bring forth a male child . When immediately after conception a woman eats cocks' testes, she becomes pregnant with a male child . The eating of a hare's womb in one's food is supposed to effect the conception of males, a result also accomplished by eating the testicles of rabbits. Smearing the body with goose grease and with resin from the terebinth tree for two days results in male offspring if intercourse takes place on the next day.<br>  <br>  A woman could beget a male child if, prior to coition, she bound her right foot with a white fillet of a child, but a black ribbon on her left foot would cause the conception of a female. If parsley is placed upon the head of a pregnant woman without her knowledge, the sex of her unborn child will be that of the first person she addresses.<br>  <br>  Some amusing instructions are given in Hippocrates, De Steril.Take some milk, mix flour with it, form a paste, and bake it on a slow fire. If it is consumed by the fire, a male will result: if it cracks and splits, a female. Again, one may take milk and pour some of it on leaves. If it condenses, it means a male; if it runs, a female.<br>  <br>  Cold waters cause the birth of females . On the tenth day after conception headache, mistiness before the eyes, distaste for food and a rising stomach are indications of the conception of a male child. A woman with a male child has a better color and the movement in the womb is felt on the fortieth day.There are opposite signs in the case of the female child and the first movement is felt on the ninetieth day . Moschion says that the child is male if it moves in the womb soon after conception and vigorously, otherwise it is female. If the breasts of a pregnant woman are turned up, she will bear a male child; if they are turned down, female offspring will result . The swelling of the right breast means a boy, of the left, a girl,24 according to Moschion .<br>  <br>  Julia Augusta, when pregnant in her early youth by Tiberius Caesar, was particularly desirous that her offspring should be a son and accordingly employed a method of divination which was much in use among young women. She carried an egg in her bosom, taking care, whenever she was obliged to put it down, to give it to her nurse to keep warm in her bosom in order that the temperature might be maintained. It is stated that this method was reliable.<br>  <br>  Although male children were preferred by human beings, farmers and shepherds naturally felt greater jubilation at the arrival of female animals. For beasts, too, there was considerable lore of sex determination. If sheep submit to the males when north winds are blowing, they are apt to bear males, says Aristotle (H. A. 573B 37); if when south winds are blowing, females.26 Shepherds were not slow to take advantage of this fact and as they wanted breeders they admitted rams to the sheep during the prevalence of south winds (Ael. 7.27). Aristotle's p68words are true of the bull (Geopon. 17.6) and, in fact, of animals in general (Geopon. 18.3).c<br>  <br>  If the right testicle of a ram is tied up, he will generate females only; if the left, males (Pl. 8.188).27 The same thing occurs in the case of the bull (Geopon. 17.6) and indeed with almost all cattle (Colum. 6.28). If the cow has conceived a male, the bull descends from the cow more to the right, if a female, to the left (Varr. R. R. 2.5.13).28 The mare is the only animal which after being covered runs facing the north or the south, according to whether she has conceived a male of female (P

A7Z0mmO1aa	The word bearing has been misused, abused and overused like no tomorrow, in navigation. There are many definitions and reference points. But for the sake of our problem and simplicity, we can assume that we are talking about true bearing. This means, that the angle is in reference to geometric north pole.<br>  <br>  So, the direction of motion makes an angle given by the bearing with respect to the geometric north south line. If the ship is pointing north, it will be 0 degrees and increasing clockwise until 359.99.. degrees. Hope that gives a basic idea.<br>  <br>  For our problem, let's take the north to be the Y axis, and east to be X-axis. And assume that the ship starts at O (0,0) for the sake of simplicity.<br>  <br>  So, the first line makes 140 degrees wrt Y-axis, or makes 50 degress wrt X-axis and is in the fourth quadrant. Now, you can draw the first line, say OA.<br>  Co-ordinates of A: <br>  xa = 95 sin(140) = 95 sin(40) = 61.06km<br>  ya = 95cos(140) = - 95cos(40) = -72.77km<br>  <br>  Now, the next leg goes from A to B, having angle of 260 wrt Y axis, or having 80 degrees wrt -Y axis:<br>  Co-ordinates of B:<br>  xb = xa +102*sin(260) = xa - 102*sin(80) = 61.06 - 100.45= - 39.39km<br>  yb = ya + 102*cos(260) = ya - 102*cos(80) =-72.77 -17.71 = -90.48km<br>  So, B is in the third quadrant.<br>  Return journey is from B to O, BO will have bearing in the first quadrant (If you draw a line from B to O and extend it beyond the origin, you will note the angle lies in the first quadrant)<br>  <br>  Length of journey L= sqrt(xb ^2  + yb^2) =  98.68 km <== Ans<br>  <br>  Let T(theta) be the bearing, yb = L cos , xb = L sinT<br>  tan T = xb/yb = 39.39/90.48 <br>  T = 23.52 degrees. <== Answer<br>  <br>  <br>  NOTE: The other answer is beautiful, except he made a mistake in the final part, since bearing is measured wrt Y axis, the y = L cos beta, and x = L sin beta :)|`|NrvrH4zQaa	Assume the ship starts at (0,0).  The bearings given are relative to north (0°); 90° is east, 180° is south, and 270° is west.  These are different and backwards from the system normally used for cartesian coordinates.<br>  <br>  So, 140° bearing is to the southeast, 50° south of east.  The 95km leg takes the ship to point (95 cos (50°), -95 sin (50°)), or (61.065, -72.774).  Call this point A.<br>  <br>  The next leg to the west takes the ship to a point RELATIVE TO POINT A (-102 cos (10°), -102 sin (10°)), or (-100.450, -17.712), relative to A, or (61.065-100.450,-72.774-17.712) relative to the origin (-39.385, -90.486).  This is point B.<br>  <br>  Now get back to the origin.  That route is northeasterly such that:<br>  39.385 = L cos β and 90.486 = L sin β.  Solve for L and β.<br>  <br>  L = 39.385/cos β ; 90.486 = 39.385 sin β/cos β = tan β<br>  tan β = 90.486/39.385 = 2.297;  β = 66.5° and L = 98.770 km
X6BrtJ9eaa	I guess the most simple explanation is that engineering is the practical appliance of science - you can study chemical engineering, biological engineering, etc. Science degrees tend to be more about pure science in the subject area chosen|`|ifBmd8lYaa	A “pure scientist” would be someone who discovers knowledge without regard for what it’s for.<br>  <br>  A “pure engineer” would be someone who couldn’t care less about where or why something is true as long as it does something useful.<br>  <br>  In real life, most practitioners fall somewhere in between and some even lean towards the other end.  On the scientific end some discoveries / creations take decades to have value beyond pure knowledge, either because no one sees a use for it “yet” or it’s impossible to make now or just costs way too much.  Like Einstein’s theories.  This can be true for engineering research as well, but in general, they focus more on the shorter term “profit” from it.<br>  <br>  Another take on it can be that a scientist leans more toward the actual physical or conceptual “nature” of something.  But an engineer leans more toward “ideas” made up by man.  For example, a scientist can discover electricity.  But and engineer may “discover” the computer.  Mother nature has no evidence that a computer should exist (although electricity always existed)…but a computer only does because of man.<br>  <br>  Some subjects account for this difference and some not.

tBMxNaPTaa	You'll have to know the drop factor for the tubing that you will be using. In other words, for a particular tubing set-up, how many drops must fall into the drip chamber to equal 1 cc?  (All drops are not created equal).<br>  In your particular problem, you have to infuse 500 cc over 3 hours, which =  167 cc per hour (500 / 3).<br>  Now, for example, if the tubing delivers 15 drops (gtts) for each cc that is infused, then you will need to deliver 2,495 gtts per hour (167 x 15); but since you are not going to stand there for an hour and make sure that 2, 495 gtts fall into the drip chamber over a 60 minute period, you'll need to figure out how many gtts should fall in one minute = 2,495 / 60 = 42 gtts per minute. You're safe in  most cases if you watch for 30 seconds, in which case you would want to see 21 gtts fall into the drip chamber.

HwdI7hVvaa	I think you are asking about series. Example you gave is about arithmetic series. You also have geometric and harmonic series.<br>  A)Arithmetic series.<br>  In this the difference of two consecutive terms is a constant.<br>  Example: 1+2+3+4....<br>  Take difference of consecutive terms.<br>  2 - 1 = 1<br>  3 - 2 = 1<br>  And so on. The difference of any two consecutive terms is 1. <br>  Another example: 1 + 4 + 7 + 10 + 13 + ...<br>  Difference of consecutive terms.<br>  4 - 1 = 3<br>  7 - 4 = 3<br>  10 - 7 = 3<br>  And so on. The difference of any two consecutive terms is 3. <br>  <br>  For arithmetic series remember the following formulas:-<br>  L = a + (n-1)*d<br>  S = (n/2) * [2a + (n-1)*d]<br>  Here<br>  a = first term of the series<br>  L = nth term of the series (note:for first term n=1)<br>  d = the difference of two consecutive terms. This is called as common difference.<br>  S = sum of n terms of the series<br>  <br>  B) Geometric series:-<br>  The ratio of consecutive terms is constant.<br>  Example: 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 ...<br>  Ratio of consecutive terms:<br>  2/1 = 2<br>  4/2 = 2<br>  8/4 = 2<br>  And so on. Here the ratio of any two consecutive terms is 2.<br>  This is called common ratio.<br>  Remember following formulas:-<br>  1) L = a * r^(n-1) (not: ^ means power)<br>  S = a * [(r^n  -  1)/(r - 1)]<br>  Here<br>  L = nth term<br>  a = first term<br>  r = common ratio<br>  S = sum of n terms<br>  <br>  Also remember the following formula:-<br>  If there are infinite numbers in a geometric series and if |r| < 1, then<br>  sum of series = a/(1 - r)<br>  <br>  C) Harmonic series<br>  If in a series you take the reciprocal of every term and if the result is a arithmetic series, then the original series is harmonic.<br>  Example: 1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/5 and so on<br>  To find nth term of a harmonic series, take reciprocals of all terms of the series. You will get arithmetic series. Find nth term of the arithmetic series. Then take reciprocal of that nth term. You will get nth term of harmonic series.<br>  There is no standard formula for finding the sum of a harmonic series.|`|MPkEvXs0aa	Sum of first n numbers = n(n+1)/2 <br>  <br>                                     = 58(58+1)/2<br>  <br>                                      = 29 * 59<br>  <br>                                      =1711

de3ItS1Gaa	To find the domain of the problem, you just find x's that won't make the function undefined. In the case of fractions, anything that makes the denominator zero would make the problem undefined. <br>  <br>  So for (5x-3)/(x^2 - 6x), find what makes x^2 - 6x = 0 and those numbers would not be part of the domain. For the first one, the domain can be anything except x = 0 or 6.<br>  <br>  For the second problem, you can't have a square root of a negative number but anything zero or above is okay. So -4 minus what makes 0? So x = -4. And any number less than -4 would make the function increase because double negative makes positive numbers. So domain is negative infinity to -4.|`|dvkNgjQ3aa	1) x ≠ 0 or x ≠ 6<br>  2) x < -4
