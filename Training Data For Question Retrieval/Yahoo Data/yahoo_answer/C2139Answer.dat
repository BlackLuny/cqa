CC461Vf3aa	Hi there,    I don't know what type of stuff you're talking about because I did not recognize the websites you mentioned. If you're interested in games, dvds, music etc, try www.play.com. Prices are very low and shipping is very fast. I am Maltese as well and I never had any problems with them.|`|SX8z9Zg0aa	The truth is you won't be able to use the sites because they, even the few that will let you sign up, won't have any offers available for people in Malta.  Sorry bud.

gGZz2EGyaa	Stars received on your profile means the amount of stars you were given on the questions you have asked.  If someone found your question interesting/liked it/whatever then they clicked on the interesting button underneath your question.  The stars do not gain you points in anyway its just a recognition of your question.

f648d819360400a2bc4cdbaaf23d417daa	Yes, it's called "yahoogroup" there are many groups you can join or you can even have your own yahoogroup. You can leave it open to anyone joining and them writing what they want about your group. OR you can make it private by invitation only. Anything someone write or comments on has to go through YOU first, if you approve or disapprove you have the controls to decide. It's pretty cool with many handy things for my group to use. We have calendar reminders of meetings, we have photo albums. The best part it's all FREE.

Thus, you can share images with your friends and family.    All you do is upload the image you want of the inauguration and then use the image tool on the left side.  Select the image you want of you and insert it.

Don't open mail from anyone you don't know.  Even opening one of these emails opens the floodgates for other scam artists to start sending you mail.

f202428f23f47abf8c99a259c26fc13eaa	That is not a choice you can make.<br>  Yahoo is in total control of the Trash folder. They empty it randomly---(that means whenever they want)----and we can't change it or stop it.<br>  <br>  Trash is for TRASH-----not for storage.<br>  Make personal folders and use them for storage.|`|AA11910058	One method would be to 'move' the email you want to save and create a new folder for it.  Other than that, I don't know how to extend the period to hold trash mail.

2f739e8b2a5530e501bad3e76a9cb2f7aa	Nobody that answered your last question is likely to see this posting. Postings are not 'linked' or 'threaded' like on a Forum or chat site.<br>  <br>  You can return to your ORIGINAL question (click your avatar or name, click the 'My Questions' tab and choose the question) and post there, using the PENCIL (edit) feature under the question.<br>  <br>  However, bear in mind that 'calling out' people by name on this site, posting insults, etc., is NOT allowed and can and will cause such posting to be reported and removed as violations, with loss of points.
f202428f23f47abf8c99a259c26fc13eaa	Not all Yahoo users can use the "Auto Complete" feature (as described by Lynn). It depends on your choice of browsers.<br>  <br>  So in that case----try this:<br>  With Classic Mail:<br>  >Click on Compose or forward.<br>  >Click directly on the word TO and your mailing list of contacts opens.<br>  >Check each name (address) you want to send to and then click the "insert checked contacts" tab.<br>  <br>  With the All New Mail:<br>  >Click on New or forward.<br>  >Click on TO to open your mailing list<br>  >Click on one name (address), and then press and hold the "ctrl" while clicking on the others<br>  >Click OK.|`|AA11910058	Once you have entered your contact's emails, yahoo automatically enters their email address when you type any of the letters of the address in the send to bar.  I always give them a handle that I can remember...Like DougandDiane so that when I enter the letter 'd', their address and anyone else's that has a 'd' in it shows up.  You merely select the one you want from that list.
jKfV6DoOaa	It sounds like Yahoo! has some problems with their Yahoo!Messenger right now. If your contacts are all gone all of a sudden then it has nothing to do with your messenger on your computer. All your personal information and contacts are stored with Yahoo itself and not on your computer. <br>  I guess you will have to wait until Yahoo fixes their problem. You should be able to sign into your Yahoo!Mail account. Go there to help and let Yahoo! know about your problem so they can work on it. I hope all your contacts are back soon and that you Messenger works soon too. I know how frustrating that situation can be. Good Luck! :o)))

rnW8h3vCaa	same problem =(|`|6qsTmMQaaa	You have to activate your 360 profile. To do that, go to your Yahoo! Answers profile, and then click on the button that says "My 360 profile" in blue letters. It is to the right of your ID. Once you set up the profile, you can click on the button that reads "Edit Personal Photos". That takes you to a page, where you can upload an image you wish to use as your primary photo. After you have added the image, you can set it as your primary. Then, go to your Yahoo! Answers profile, and then click the button that reads "Edit My Info". You will see three boxes down near the bottom toolbar on the page, and the middle one reads "Use my Yahoo! 360 Picture". Check the circle next to it, and then scroll down and save your profile. It will take a short period of time for the picture to process, so be patient. Hope this helped! Good luck!

Answers have the ability to hand out stars to questions, a star signifies that the user found your question Interesting/thought-provoking/ intelligent or wanted to look back at it for future reference.

Stars Do not bring any perks for the questioner, no points are exchanged for stars, they are solely there for marking a question as ''Interesting''|`|AA11510511	If a person finds your question interesting, then they can click a star next to your question.    You can have numerous stars per question.

Different things seem to work for different people.

F0h2iFWsaa	level 2 starts at 250 points.  level 3 starts at 1,000 points.  you have 95.    All you get here is points - - no prizes, no certificates, no cash.    All levels can pick a best answer to questions they ask and can vote for best answer on others' undecided questions.  Once you hit level 2 & get the ability to 'rate', the only difference in the levels is the daily limits on questions, answers, comments, votes, etc.    Levels 2 and up can 'rate' the answers of other Y!A users.  Rating = giving Thumbs Up & Down to express your opinion of other peoples' answers. No points are involved (unless a best answer has TUs, then they get 1 point for each TU up to 50) in rating, and thumbs do not determine the Best Answer selection.    Hints:     answer your limit of questions each day (2 points each)  get an answer selected as best answer (10 points each)  pick a best answer for your question (3 points)  vote your limit of unresolved questions each day (1 point each)  you also get a point a day for signing in    each question costs 5 points, so ask sparingly    :o)     http://answers.yahoo.c om/info/scoring_system;_ylt=Aplad92Pq_Fl...|`|niivsTVxaa	You Join Yahoo! Answers and are automatically given 100 points to get you started, it takes 250 points to reach Level 2, which means if you don't ask any questions then you only need to accumulate 150 points yourself before reaching level 2.    It doesn't take long to Reach Level 2 if you use up your daily quotas and refrain from asking questions, it should take on average 2-3 days:    Day 1:  Signing up = 100 Points.  Vote on 20 Unresolved questions = 20 Points.  Answer 20 Questions = 40 Points.    Day 2:  Vote on 20 unresolved questions = 20 Points.  Answer 20 Questions = 40 Points.    Day 3:  Vote on 10 unresolved Questions = 10 Points.  Answer 10 questions = 20 points.    NOTE: You may progress onto Level 2 even faster if you receive any Best Answers, as each one is worth 10 points.  --------------------------------------...  Level 3 requires 1,000 points, and you get to it just the same way as you did to get to level 2, it just takes longer.    NOTE: Yahoo!

e1th6AQiaa	It's possible that someone hacked your account and changed your password.  You should be able to check "forgot password" and if you have provided a back up email (recommended) then yahoo will send you an email to the back up email that you may have provided (hopefully) when you signed up for your yahoo account.   They will send you a link in the back up email so that you can follow the link, answer a security question or 2, and reset your password.   If you didn't provide a back up email when you signed up to yahoo, then you should be able to contact yahoo through the help form. Explain in detail what is going on with your account and give them an alternate email to contact you in.   Yahoo can and will delete your account if you have used it inappropriately (spamming, harassing, etc). But I think they would suspend your account 1st or give you a warning. Not sure on that. But they can delete accounts if you have violated any terms you agreed not to do when signing up.  Hope this helps. And good luck.

C6jFigESaa	Hey Spotter 888    I have already looked into this matter, and below are the results.       1.  In order to keep the TC badge, you must accumulate 200 + points weekly in a particular category    2. In order to keep the badge, you must achieve exactly 20 BAs ( Best Answer) within the 3 week span in a particular category.    3. You must be on level 2 and up in order to be given the TC bage.     EDIT: As for those who accumulate so many points within a week: well, that would be hard for me to judge.       I hope this is the information you are seeking.|`|04d06dfa9bbbb62672382e390353acbfaa	You need to consistently answer and get voted best answer in one category. I assume people manage this by naturally knowing a lot about one particular thing and answering every question that comes up in that category.     If you answer a lot of questions in many categories, you won't get a top contributor badge because your knowledge is too broad (which I think is a little unfair.)     People who have a lot of time (or type and read really fast) will eventually answer enough questions well enough in one category to become top contributors.|`|t2M1kXY4aa	1.  There are no absolutes but if you answer approximately 45 - 60 questions in a month and maintain a Best Answer rating of 10% or more in that category, you'll most likely be awarded a badge.  You needn't ask any questions in that category.    2.  The number of points TOTAL have nothing to do with TC designation.  It's the level of activity within a particular CATEGORY (or 2 or 3) that determines whether someone gets and keeps a TC badge.    3.  You may be right.  (Not naming any names, though).|`|QCPddhlUaa	Hi Spotter 888,    Yahoo! purposely keeps the formula to become a Top Contributor a secret. However, through my own "research" and what other resourceful users of this site have told me, I can tell you that the 10% of best answers "law" is not correct! There is NO such rule that says that - it's just an estimate! Also, there is no rule that says you have to answer 50 questions a week or get 20 best answers a month - these are all just speculations.     What you should do is continue to remain active on this site. Keep giving good answers and STAY IN ONE CATEGORY! Some people spread themselves out too thin - they go in any random category.     Vote yourself for Best Answer on questions you've answered that are in voting- this is NOT cheating, and it's perfectly fine to do so.     Just as important, it may take more than one week for you to become a TC. For most users, it's taken 2 to 3 weeks. For some, it's taken a month or so. If you continue to give your full input on this site, you will surely get results.     You can lose the badge if you don't remain active and maintain your best answers.    The best way to get the TC badge is by following these steps:    - Answer about 40 to 50 questions a week [This means that you can answer about 6 to 8 questions a day.]    - Aim for 5 to 6 best answers a week.    - Try to get 200 points by the end of each week.    - Vote for yourself on questions in voting.    - Give clear, concise, and qualified answers.    - Use proper spelling and grammar.    - Be polite with your answers.    - Get to the point with your answers.    - Answer questions that don't have many answers. This increases your chance of getting chosen as best answer.    - Don't answer questions that can get reported.    - Don't give answers that could get reported.    - Learn from the other answerers. When you learn new information from the other experts, use it in your future answers. [But please do not copy their actual answer. That will just end up in getting reported.]    - Most importantly, keep in mind that it's not about the orange badge, but rather, the opportunity for you to share your knowledge and experience with other users on the site.     To emphasize upon your questions that I may not have answered fully,     - There is no set amount of questions/answers/points that must be accumulated in a particular category in order to earn the badge.     - Users with 5000+ points without the badge probably don't participate on a regular basis, don't stick to one category, or do not get many best answers.     - Users that have 200T+ participate on a regular basis, get many best answers, have been using the site for a long time, etc. to get the points. There are rarely those who have multiple accounts to vote them as the best answer.    If you're looking to become a Top Contributor, I wish you the best of luck :)|`|eb4a10b7d0c7b16ef422f23a98ba67beaa	"A "Top Contributor" is a member of the Yahoo Answers community who has shown that they are knowledgeable in a certain category. Each user can be a top contributor in a maximum three categories.  You earn it or lose it depending on your recent participation in a certain section.  The more positively you contribute, the more chance there is that you will get a TC badge. Just like featured users or category leaders, it's another way to give credit to community members."    The TC badge is awarded on the number of questions answered and best answers received by the user in a particular week, in a particular category.    It is rumoured that you need at least a 10 percent best answers in your chosen category to get a TC badge although the actual percentage and the number of answers is Yahoo's secret.   All you see and read on the subject is speculation, rumour, assumption and guesswork.    A user who is on the leader board may or may not have a TC badge, the criteria is measured on weekly participation in a particular category (number of answers and % of best answers in the category).    The easiest way to get a TC badge is to concentrate on one category where many questions are asked and hope to get some best answers.    The Polls and Surveys and Jokes and Riddles categories do not have Top Contributors.    If you have contributed enough to meet Yahoo's criteria, the orange badge will appear below your avatar on Monday morning.    It can disappear just as easily on Monday morning, if you don't keep answering questions in your chosen category.

Just set the camera a bit lower than your face, lean forward a bit to where your face is level with the camera, and take the picture.

Right click on the picture and copy the URL link and paste it when you ask a question. If you want large size images then click 'All sizes' above the photo and paste the 'Grab the photo's URL'     You could also use these websites: -  http://photobucket.com/  http://fotopic.net/  http://www.snapfish.com  http://www.tinypic.com    ?Photo bucket links may cause Error 999 when you try to upload a picture.

I've also noticed these same crappy spellers are trying to whore their writing skills with the "What do you think of my short story" questions in B&A, and the excerpt they have in the extra information section has so many spelling mistakes, and looks like a third-grader effort.  Never mind that, why are these people putting whole excerpts of stories on Answers, when they could post their missives on a writing website, and post the link.  Or give us brief explanations about what the story is about with important plot info.  These are the people who claim they want to writers when they grow up, and it's obvious they (some of them, anyway) can't write or spell properly.  This has got to be a joke, and as an aspiring writer, it's a downright insult to my intellegence!<br>  <br>  But if they ARE genuine, then I'd just ignore them, or click on "Report Answer."  I don't think such a thing is allowed on here.  I typically look over the spelling mistakes meant to be typos.  I think these critics claim to have perfect spelling and mechanics, and expect others to be the same.

apcRdPhIaa	Try out this blog to get some tips on increasing your Flickr views.|`|bWSekg47aa	Flickr is a social networking group built around photo sharing.  If you want people to visit your photostream and comment on your photos, then you need to cultivate relationships.  <br>  <br>  Try commenting on photos that have been posted to groups, photos on the Explore page, and photos that your contacts have posted.  Keep your comments positive--no one will respond favorably if you only slam their work.  If you want to offer criticism, please do so in a constructive way.<br>  <br>  Also, you can post your photos to groups to maximize their visibility.  There are some groups that require you to leave comments on photos in the group pool.  If you post to these groups, make sure you follow the commenting rules or else you will develop a bad reputation. <br>  <br>  Finally, take and post creative and unique photos.  People will often comment about the creativity of composition, lighting and subject of photos. Keep these things in mind while you are photographing.

To Fix the problem,    Start > Control Panel > Administrative Tool > dbl-click Services    Scroll down to Protected Storage:  1. dbl-click > Change Startup Type to Automatic  2. right-click > Restart     This is a common problem with Win-XP. Also, can be corrected by installing the correct service pack.

However, even if you deleted your whole account, any resolved questions or answers to resolved questions you had on Y! Answers would STILL remain (only your PROFILE on Y! Answers will be deleted.) http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/edit/ch...    You can simply stop using Y! Answers with that account to keep it for use in other services of Yahoo!.    To DELETE your whole Yahoo! Account (including Y! Answers profile), this page tells you about it: http://help.yahoo.com/l/uk/yahoo/mail/or...    Here is the DELETION PAGE itself: https://edit.yahoo.com/config/delete_use...    Be careful, as this will remove your whole account and all the information in it, so read all the warnings, as you will not be able to reactivate or recover it after the account has been deleted. You are always welcome to sign up again for a new account.

Different things seem to work for different people. It's causing attachments to not show, 999 errors where it won't let you do a particular action and some people cannot send receive delete or move mail.

This way if you mess things up even worse, you can go back to old config.    To your question:    Open up Outlook Express, choose Tools-> Options -> General  On the bottom, make Outlook Express the default email application    If you need to get your old messages from Outlook, go to:  File -> Import -> Messages     and choose Microsoft Outlook    You should be on your way.|`|xl2isudZaa	it sounds like u must have installed ms office  the easiest way I found is to delete msoutlook altogether leaving only outlook express  if u don't want to do that go to the control panel under default programs and make outlook express as the default program this will open express by default for all file types that it can open (email extensions) right now msoutlook must be set as the default program so change it or delete it  good luck 2u  email me if u need more help  cya

2f739e8b2a5530e501bad3e76a9cb2f7aa	Sorry, but those photos are gone. Yahoo gave us MONTHS of warnings, lots of emails and plenty of chances to move our photos to another site. If you did not do that, then all those photos were deleted after they finally closed down the Yahoo Photo site.
yuHV59Yhaa	More details please.|`|m7Y10ojiaa	Alright then..?|`|e1th6AQiaa	You can't "change" anything about your email address.  For example if your email is "donald_duck@yahoo.com" you can not change it.     You can go to your account and create other identities that you can use for posting in forums, groups or different yahoo things. But you can't change anything about the actual email address.    You can delete the yahoo account for the email you want to change and create a new account with the email you want (if it is available).    To create other identities for other yahoo services, go to your account, it will ask you again for your password. Then on the screen that shows you information, click to create a new alias. I think you can make more than one. Just remember to click save.    Then if you are in any yahoo groups, etc. and wish to post in a forum, you can choose one of your alias names to use instead of your email.    Hope this helps.

tqAEoOAdaa	If you got an E-mail saying that your account was suspended then that's the end of it. You'll have to convince the Yahoo team that you are a committed user to restore your account. Suspended accounts are very rare to get back but you can try your luck. Don't hold your breath; give it a try    Also had you received violation notices so far?? If Yes, then probably that's the case. Make sure you follow the guidelines carefully from now, lest it might happen again. You could appeal to Yahoo using this form (http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/answers... )    You could also E-mail to Yahoo and ask them if you've any clarifications to make about your account y_answrs_team@yahoo.com or answers-abuse@cc.yahoo-inc.com    Here are some tips to appeal Suspensions:-   http://suggestions.yahoo.com/detail/?pro...

ca9800e875bb4c0b4dbd33a8358d5eefaa	The new yahoo mail does have a way to view a photo or a group of photos in a small view. You may not have the latest plugins. If you use IE click on Tools then Windows Update. That usually works.  If that does not work use Yahoo or Google to find free downloads of Flash Player, Shockwave. Quicktime and Java. The browser Firefox works well for most of us from www.firefox.com

xl2isudZaa	POP3 is an internet-based standard for retrieval of e-mail by a user from an e-mail server. POP stands for Post Office Protocol. The "3" means it is the third revision of the standard; POP1 and POP2 were made obsolete by POP3, which has been popular for many years now.  The primary competitor to POP3 is IMAP: Internet Message Access Protocol. IMAP is a more flexible, modern protocol when compared to POP3, and is designed more toward an always-on network connection to the mail server. IMAP servers retain messages on the server by default, and allow the user to organize their mail into folders. While POP3 clients allow for folder-based organization as well, separating messages into folders on the server has a definite advantage for users that may need to access their e-mail remotely.   also see   http://www.tech-faq.com/pop3.shtml

If you want to create a unique avatar (and you don't have one already) then you need to get a Yahoo! 360(follow this link) http://360.yahoo.com once you have that.....    On your 360 page, select *My Page* at the top right hand side.    Select *Edit Personal Photos* on the left hand side(this will take you to the photo upload page).    Select Browse(this will allow you to choose from the pictures you have saved to your computers harddrive),select which one you wish to use as your avatar by clicking on it and select open(the picture you use MUST be in JPEG format and less than 5MB) scroll down to the bottom of the page and select save.    If you have uploaded more than one picture(you can have up to 4) you will have to then re-select edit personal photos,choose the one you wish to be your avatar and set it as the primary photo and then scroll down and save.    Now you need to go to your Answers profile page http://answers.yahoo.com/my/my;_ylt=AtnV...    Select Edit My Info on your profile page.There are 3 photo boxes there,underneath the middle one click Use my Yahoo! 360 picture.Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click Preview.    On the new page that has just opened for you (Edit My Profile Preview) scroll down to the bottom and click OK    That's it you have changed the picture you display,it may take a little while for the new avatar to show (sometimes it is instantaneous,but more often than not it takes a day or two) =)

zDQIPFH2aa	There is no exact number, since accounts are reviewed individually. One major TOS violation will get you suspended immediately with no warning. Many minor violations over a year will not get you suspended, but those same violations in a couple of days will. YA has always said that EACH violation is a warning your account is under review and the next violation may be the one that puts you over the top.     Suspensions are forever, unless you can convince them they made a mistake in applying the rules and that you didn't violate the rules.|`|PUgvxOltaa	whatever that yahoo worker feels like doing when they violate you.

Just move them from the memory card to the hard drive to keep them in one convenient place.      This is easy to do.

Serious breaches of the Terms of Service would perhaps only require the one violation !!!

You can vote for undecided questions at Level 1, even your own, but you need to be on Level 2 to rate answers (thumb up /down).    The best way to gain points is to answer and vote to your limit each day, whatever level you are on.    Visit each day - 1 point  Answer to your limit each day - 2 points each answer - 20 questions - 40 points  Hope for some best answers - 10 points each best answer plus 1 point for every thumbs up (maximum 50 points)  Vote to your limit each day - 1 point each vote - 20 votes - 20 points  If you ask a question, -5 points, pick a best answer, you get 3 points back.|`|F0h2iFWsaa	Answer & vote your daily limits - - don't ask questions.    level 2 starts at 250 points - you have 133.    All levels can pick a best answer to questions they ask and can vote for best answer on others' undecided questions.  Once you hit level 2 & get the ability to 'rate', the only difference in the levels is the daily limits on questions, answers, comments, votes, etc.    Levels 2 and up can 'rate' the answers of other Y!A users.  Rating = giving Thumbs Up & Down to express your opinion of other peoples' answers. No points are involved (unless a best answer has TUs, then they get 1 point for each TU up to 50) in rating, and thumbs do not determine the Best Answer selection.    Hints:     answer your limit of questions each day (2 points each)  get an answer selected as best answer (10 points each)  pick a best answer for your question (3 points)  vote your limit of unresolved questions each day (1 point each)  you also get a point a day for signing in    each question costs 5 points, so ask sparingly    :o)     http://answers.yahoo.c om/info/scoring_system;_ylt=Aplad92Pq_Fl...|`|7nGwou8uaa	get more points.

7149XmBqaa	It gives Joe Goober something to do.  On the sixth thumbs down an answer receives, it is hidden or removed, forgot which, and you get an extra point for each thumbs up if you are chosen as best answer.  The thumbs down do not count against you when chosen as best answer.  Joe Goober just hates, that's all.

That is why there is a voting system. If you actually do not know the answer how can you pick the best answer?    Extreme example:  What is the capital of France?   You receive 3 answers, London, Paris, and Rome.  If you really have no idea of the correct answer how do you pick one other than doing the research yourself? Allowing a vote will maybe narrow it down.    ? ??l???q ?|`|uu1IUxAkaa	Because they don't like the answers they get so they leave it alone.

Unscrupulous thieves have sent you this email and they are trying to part you from your hard earned cash.

Sin embargo, hay buenas preguntas o preguntas sinceras, que la gente responde con toda su buena intencin de ayudar.  Hay quienes preguntan para no tener que investigar .  Otras preguntas son verdaderamente interesantes, pero en el poco tiempo que llevo entrando aqu, no veo que buenas preguntas con respuestas queden por decirlo as, archivados en algn sitio para poder recurrir a ellas en caso de duda, y temo que tal vez se repitan las mismas preguntas de cuando en cuando, pasado un tiempo.  Creo debera haber otra "carpeta" o seccin o as, como la de Preguntas resueltas, que se refiriera a Preguntas realmente buenas con algunas respuestas igualmente buenas, a modo de consulta, pues creo que la seccin Preguntas resueltas caducan pasado un tiempo.  De todos modos, me he dado cuenta de que sto de preguntar, responder, y leer el resto de preguntas y respuestas, entretiene bastante.  He visto de todo, gente completamente inculta, y alguna persona que otra realmente preparada con un nivel bastante aceptable, por no decir elevado, culturalmente e intelectualmente hablando.  Realmente hay preguntas y respuestas para todos los gustos, y de todos o casi todos los temas imaginables.

Te aconsejo que si no hubo faltas de respeto, ni agresividad, ni algo similar. Si solamente la ruptura fue motivada por malos entendidos y no porque existiera una tercera persona, claro que l puede volver a buscarte, ahora bien, eres tu quien tienes que valorar si l te merece, tu eres quien tienes que analizar si l te gusta lo suficiente y si es as pues adelante.

There's no separate inbox for Y! Answers.  When the person opens the email, there's a link in the email asking him/her if he/she wishes to reply (the link will take the person to a Y! Answers' page where they can reply to your message).

kYi5wpUJaa	Just like in level 29, you've got to find homophones (words that sound the same but mean different things). Each line contains one homophone. Figure out what each one is and then write them down in a list.

Or, you can hide Q&A by clicking "Edit My Info" next to your avatar on the Profile page, then change settings under PRIVACY.|`|hJAtgbb8aa	You can delete it if the question is open.<br>  Unfortunately, once a question is resolved, it belongs to Yahoo! Answers.<br>  A user can only delete his/her question when the question is open.<br>  If it has entered the voting stage, or it has been resolved by the questioner or the community (as in the best answer has been chosen) that question will be a part of Yahoo! Answers' property.<br>  So no one can delete that question, except the Yahoo!

Once a question is in 'voting' or has been resolved via a Best Answer being chosen, the question belongs to Y!A and is in their database forever (or until they start archiving old Q&As anyway).<br>  <br>  To delete your question while it's still open, go to the question page, pass your mouse over the pencil icon in the toolbar below your question, and click Delete Question.<br>  <br>  :o)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/answers/ask/ask-76322.html">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/answers...</a>

eb4a10b7d0c7b16ef422f23a98ba67beaa	None whatsoever, apart from allowing the multiple account holder to gain points more quickly. They were originally intended to show approval or disapproval of other user's answers. <br>  I don't think that is true anymore when you constantly see perfectly reasonable answers being thumbed down and the IDK type getting thumbs up.<br>  Thumbs down don't matter, they don't cost you anything. <br>  They are supposed to be an indication of what another user, who you don't know, thought of your answer. <br>  Thumbs up are the same, it's worth one point for each thumb, but only if your answer is picked as best, if your answer isn't picked as best, a thumb up is just as worthless as a thumb down.|`|SOxdyWQOaa	no just away for people to show if they like your answer|`|FIL4vngsaa	Yes they do serve a purpose - <br>  Check this out;<br>  <a href="http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/info/scoring_system;_ylt=AtF07CaSrYYHvjnf4DAEKTRhOhh.;_ylv=3">http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/info/scoring...</a>|`|URZeQfQCaa	No, it just shows that one or two people agree or disagree.

b54d93db511477e3231a19a1adb0c354aa	well, idk really what Jesus did to change Palestine back in the day, but to change the world...? <br>  Jesus gave ppl a way to Heaven to be with Him if we only accept it, until then, we were all doomed to hell, and now we have a choice. sometimes we choose to go to hell rather than just loving Him so much that we surrender our lives to Him. He loved us so much that He would rather die than to ever live without us, but we are so blinded by other world religons, that we can't even see that. He loves YOU!

gP11453Waa	Probably there are many answers to this question, but a common technique for this one is that senders (especially of spam or other commercial email) will often intentionally put in a weird sending date on theirs so that it will show up at the beginning of a typical inbox.  Just for fun sometime, reset your computer clock to something way off, even to another year in the future, send yourself or a friend an email, and then see what happens.  Right now, for example, I have three from a "Free Money for College" offer that are dated July 15, 2036.<br>  <br>  However, you will not see a wrong date on the email you sent, since the answer from linuleb7 is correct about the time being in the hosting server.  There are ways around that, though, that many of the spammers and scammers have used.|`|8b006ad2547d67b6ee6de41af44054b9aa	The time displayed in an email is not the time it was sent in the sender's time zone. It is the current time in the time zone where the internet hosting server is located.
