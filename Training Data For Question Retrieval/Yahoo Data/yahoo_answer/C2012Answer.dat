AA10925546	Well, I got one about 2 months ago.  I've lost about 8 lbs, but it's not just from the Wii Fit.  Like any other game, it gets old after a while-  you can do all sorts of things with it, but the cool thing is how it charts your weight loss or gain and it gives you fitness tips. <br>  <br>  I'm positive my balance and coordination are better now, after using the balancing games.  But, like I said-  you have to continue using it.  I don't find the jogging in place very exciting at all but I do like the Step programs.  It even has a program where you can step in place while watching TV.  The wii remote has a little speaker and it holds the beat for you while you watch tv or a movie...sort of a cool feature. <br>  <br>  I think if you use that for 15 minutes per day and combine it with a regular workout, you might see an improvement over what you could do with a workout alone.   I find that it doesn't motivate me to use it more often, though.|`|Y4s4Om38aa	I have it and love it.  Havent had it long enough or been consistant enought to have lost weight but it is fun.  If weight is the only reason you want to get it, you might want to think about how well you can stick to it......like any excersize program, it only works if you are consistant with it.   Couple of the cardio do really give you a workout once you unlock the longer times...10 minute advanced hulahoop is hard if trying to get a high spin count.....wish the step program got more advanced.....but the freestep is cool.  Balance games are a lot of fun, but wont lose weight doing though.  However, my balance has greatly improved in the time ive had it.  How it keeps track of weight is very nice for a workout program.  Am hoping they come out with more exercise programs that fully utilize it, like with a more advanced cardio step program.  Other exercise programs out that are "wii fit compatable" really only use it to weigh in.....dont untilize it in playing.....and that just makes it a $90 scale|`|tv3Mwm10aa	I have one and i love it. It works too. But if that's the only reason your going to buy it then don't. Just go get a training tape. it works about the same.|`|PjlAty2Paa	love it!!<br>  <br>  worth every cent. my aim is to lose  weight which i am. it is fun motivates you too|`|N9nJWYa5aa	Nintendo have sold literally millions of Wii Fit bundles (Wii Fit game, and balance board).  Does it work, yes provided you use it, it's a great START towards getting fit, but you have to build it into a regular routine.  Did I lose any weight, no, but then that's not my goal, and anyway it's only a small part of my fitness regime.<br>  <br>  The only person that can get you fitter and slimmer is you.  But if you have determination then Wii Fit is a great tool, and fun too!<br>  <br>  You could also try "My Personal Trainer" (MPT), if you up the difficulty to a sensible level, and use the on screen tutorial when you need it, it'll burn far more calories than the Wii Fit ever can.  MPT is like having a whole shelf full of fitness DVDs.|`|17b959544fe5d0f04baabb39f366b6f5aa	I haven't tried it yet.  The game and the accessories cost almost $100 total.  It is not as effective as working out with weights and running.
bo54Lw59aa	If the first is a camera, and the second is an editing program.  Should be.
AyTe2YY9aa	You should be able to open up the top part of the wii. You need to plug in the mat there.|`|GODp5htoaa	Lol i was so shocked when i found that little thing on top i thought id broken it :)

IxoBFCpTaa	? My friend says that you cannot have a song more than 3 MB on it. So the solution would be to use the Computer to make the files smaller.
ndQkhqZeaa	If your phone was turned off for nonpayment the only thing on your bill should be the past balance and the early termination fees.<br>  <br>  When you sign up for a contract you usually get a phone at a discount based on having service for 2 years. If you do not honor that contract, you pay the original price for the phone.<br>  <br>  You should call them, the collections department will work with to to waive the fees if you make a payment.
6ts5esy8aa	same here except our bill is ova 200 a month
sPQBluKEaa	no, it will not be activated when it is sent to your house. there should be a number in the box that you get it in to call and get the phone activated. you have to authorize the last four digits of your social security number and such. this is so that no one can take it while it is being mailed to your house.|`|KKKtKaMOaa	ya it's so simple you just call this 1 800 number right at the front of the book which isn't that hard then just say what you want to someone on a phone.  it's not impossible

RNzoIUz2aa	you are committing fraud. and the phone's esn number will be blacklisted|`|ndQkhqZeaa	Saying your phone was stolen does not cancel your contract. You would be required to get a new phone.<br>  <br>  Some companies have a maintenance plan where you can put a contract on hold for a few months. It extends your contract. So saying you don't have the cash for a new phone won't help either.|`|T38lIQ8Gaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  You'll be investigated for insurance fraud and fined a large sum of money. Basically.<br>  <br>  Good Luck with that.|`|FDgarm4Zaa	no they wont charge you, but why would you say its stolen when your giong to keep it ? thats lying.
RNzoIUz2aa	No its not too sensitive. there was a firmware upgrade released I believe.<br>  Don't tell me, I already know whats coming down the pike for verizon.<br>  I personally would never buy a samsung phone
7abc8a12212468a52586c2c62d6edd72aa	Shut off the phone,then turn it back on,you should be OK,mine has done that too a couple of times,this one is V3a,which replaced my v3c,the v3c did not once do this in the 2 years I had,do not know why this happens,but when it happens again I 'm going to Alltel and ask them to check the phone.<br>  <br>  ,I did have the problem I mentioned and turning the phone off,then on worked,since it did not for you,the only thing I can suggest is take it in.|`|nnN4QDgkaa	OK my friend had a razor and when the screen goes white its trash dude if your warranty isn't expired yet go to the store and the and the person behind the repair center will either give you a new phone or you will have to buy a new one OK if you need help email me

If no top ups have been made the free texts apply the month after you've made the necessary top ups.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps =)|`|YWjB85I0aa	You need to wait ATLEAST 48 hours for the 300 free texts to come through. i have same problem,<br>  usually coms through within 12 hours for me.|`|GcLx2LU6aa	Ring 450

6EbDYWNEaa	I don't think there is such a web site. I know there are a lot of "reverse look up" sites. I use them a lot when I get a call that I do not know. For cell phones all they can find is the "home" tower for that phone number and sometimes the service provider. Only a service provider can tell you the name and address of a cell phone though. Land lines are the only phone numbers that you publicly and freely have access to that sort of information, and only then if the information is published in a phone book.<br>  <br>  Sorry.|`|7l3gvv8Gaa	go to inf. on the comp.or go to trace,-type the word in yahoo,& go from there.|`|eta0c25yaa	I dont think they have a site like that. It's kinda stalking the person. Unless they have a chip in the phone that parents can track their kids where they are going.

noU2uKEoaa	It seems quite a complex situation. You are correct in saying that the sim serial number is unique, however the fact your sim is in the N73 does not prove ownership of the phone.<br>  The easiest way to resolve this is to provide the IMEI. Now I know you do not have this but there may be a way to obtain the IMEI.<br>  You do not say if you were recently using the N73 and if so with which sim.<br>  Assuming you were using the "3" sim card you should contact "3" customer services. I know from experience of working for  another network that there are systems available that will allow the IMEI to be found from recent call activity or mobile internet use.<br>  The IMEI of course will be the one relating to the device the sim card was in at the time.<br>  If you do contact customer services you need to be aware that they will  have validation procedures in place and you will have to pass their validation procedure before specific information can be released.<br>  I hope this is of some use.|`|0PQdeKzaaa	Hi Vashist as you've got a genuine complaint here if you follow the link what i put up for you it will take you to ofcom obudsman & if you put the complaint into them they should get it sorted for you !<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.telecomsadvice.org.uk" rel="nofollow">http://www.telecomsadvice.org.uk</a><br>  <br>  hope this helps you with you with your problem & goodluck ... sly

Always check with your phone plan rep.
MeeJWmGtaa	Fact: you can find craploads of reviews and features all by yourself on the web.
KQL3tqS7aa	I'm not too familiar with Verizon's phones, but I do know that you should shy away from brand new phones.  Usually when phones come out, the glitches in the software are not worked out yet, leading to frustration when you have to go in to get software updates!
KQL3tqS7aa	Usually the prepaid plans have lower minutes/prices per month that you can add unlimited texting onto.  However, sometimes the prepaid plans are not the most cost effective if you use your phone alot to talk.  For example, a company's lowest "contract type" price plan would be 300 minutes for $29.99/month, but you would need to add unl. text for an additional $14.95/month.....the same company's prepaid plans start at 100 minutes for $25.00/month plus the $14.95/month for unlimited texting.  Another idea to get the better pricing for the plan is some companies  will allow you to get month-to-month service if you use a phone you already own as long as it's compatible with that specific carrier. Doing that would eliminate the early termination fee, but allow you to get the more cost effective pricing on your minutes.|`|536c8794da305b4e63d43045420c28b5aa	www.mywirelessrep.com/audreylynch<br>  <br>  No Deposits Required, No Credit Check, in the Verizon Network (nation's most reliable network)<br>  <br>  They offer everything from free phones to PDA's. <br>  Best deal for the service and buck

qQxRDl59aa	Yes, it for sending and receiving text OUTSIDE of AT&T (i.e.-Verizon, T-Moble, Sprint, etc.) I think it's free if you send text to AT&T customers.<br>  <br>  If you text a lot, I would consider changing your text plan. I have AT&T and I have the unlimited texting. It's only $20 dollars a month and it's worth it.|`|a8hbGnlOaa	yes|`|AqkQfryzaa	Nope just sending
IxoBFCpTaa	? Contact your carrier and tell them about the issue; they should have all passwords. I have never heard of a lock code.

YiY9Yd2Jaa	You aren't quite clear, but I gather that not only are the images gone from your computer but from the card as well.<br>  <br>  They can be recovered from the card - even if you have reformatted it using software - as long as you have not taken more photos over the top of the deleted images. <br>  <br>  If the card is a Sandisk, it will have come with a small disk with recovery software on it. Just run that and follow instruction. With a hundred and fifty images, it might take a couple of hours to complete. If you don't have a recovery disk, I would suggest going and buying a second Sandisk card to obtain the software. It is some of the most effective software around for recovering lost images. <br>  <br>  Good Luck...|`|AA10276489	Go to Samsung website and ask them.|`|b8e3dd68b7fdbbbac6132e0c73015651aa	just unplugging it shouldn't delete the photos, but may have stopped you from getting 'access' to them.

I searched online and at a BestBuy store for information and comparisons. A plasma gives you a clearer picture quality.  Plus, currently they seem to be a little less expensive, depending on the size and brand. A con would be that a plasma get hotter quicker and it wastes more energy. An lcd is more energy efficient. It also has less glare if you are in a better lit room. You can check several websites for such information. This information was also passed on to me by a tech guy that I know.

RyvKws7Laa	50" Plasma - Samsung PN50A550, Samsung PN50A650, Panasonic Viera TH-50PZ800, or Panasonic Viera TH-50PZ85.<br>  <br>  46" Plasma - Panasonic Viera TH-46PZ850 or Panasonic Viera TH-46PZ80.<br>  <br>  42" Plasma - Panasonic Viera TH-42PX80 and Samsung PN42A450.<br>  <br>  52" LCD - Samsung LN52A650, Sony Bravia KDL-52XBR6, or Toshiba Regza 52XV545.<br>  <br>  46" LCD - Samsung LN46A550 or Sony Bravia KDL-46Z4100.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't call any of those cheap, but they're not like cutting edge $4,000-$5,000 either.  They're more in the $1500-$2200 kind of range I think.  So I would call that affordable, but one person's affordable isn't necessarily another's so here's hoping that works for you.<br>  <br>  As for Plasma vs LCD, at 50", you will see the advantages of going Plasma from a normal viewing distance (6ft-9ft).  LCD fanboys can say what they like, but just go and look at a wall of 50 TVs mixed between the two and your eye will gravitate towards the Plasmas.  They are just better picture quality.<br>  <br>  Plasma have better contrast and better blacks.  Their colors are at a higher gamut and closer to true colors.  The colors also tend to have a bit more 'pop' to them.  That's not a good vs bad issue, just personal preference.  Also, while we're talking personal preference, Plasma TVs are a bit softer in SD (think major motion pictures).<br>  <br>  Plasmas do need to be conditioned though.  For the first 100-200 hours of operation keep the brightness and contrast (picture) settings cranked way down.  Then optimize and enjoy.  Plasmas are glass panels though, so glare can be an issue if you have a bright room that you can't control the ambient light (can't close blinds and can't turn off lights).<br>  <br>  LCDs are the everyman HDTV.  They are cost effective.  They are thinner and lighter.  On the whole they tend to draw less power than Plasmas (though the better Plasmas are giving LCDs a run for their money).  Plasmas are sharper in SD (think the evening news) and have slightly more muted colors (both of these are personal preference though, not good vs bad). <br>  <br>  LCDs have problems with fast motion.  They have latency issues with being able to refresh their images.  So you can get motion blur.  This is a ghost trail behind the fast moving object.  120Hz and 240Hz options on LCDs are helping to deal with this.  But you do pay a price premium for that.  On Plasmas this is not an issue, their refresh rate is nearly instantaneous (like CRTs and DLPs).  So if you see a refresh rate for a Plasma, don't try and match it spec vs spec against an LCD, we're talking 2 way different technologies here.<br>  <br>  LCDs are a matte finish.  They will hold up better in rooms with uncontrollable ambient light.|`|Ur9JAyd2aa	i have panasonic th-50pz80 its brillant plasma if you want to live football etc..then its plsma but if you to play computer games then lcd but try this website www.hotukdeals.com try costco had specail offer 50 inch with 5 year guarantee ￡770.. also selfriges|`|usIma0vIaa	Plasma HD TV click here<br>  <a href="http://www.sears.com/shc/s/p_10153_12605_05771643000P?adCell=A3http://www.repairfaq.org/sam/tvfaq.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.sears.com/shc/s/p_10153_12605...</a>|`|C56B5jvgaa	lcd<br>  plasma gas chambers go.|`|zL5yC2p2aa	At present if you have the money to spend, to get one of the best quality tvs out there, then plasma still wins compared with LCD...<br>  If you're looking for a bargain then go with an LCD...<br>  Top of the range brands include Sony, Samsung, Pioneer etc.<br>  These come at a price though...<br>  <br>  Honestly, I would purchase either a Hitachi or a Toshiba as they're quite cheap and use the same screen as Sony, just their own frame ;)|`|gUBzQtejaa	Personally I like the plasma better.

C7rV71Cjaa	Get a Wii. You get all the Wii exclusives plus a whole new experience you can only get with a Wii. You already have a PS3 which is a lot like the 360 and most games for the 360 come out on the PS3. The only games you would really miss out on are Halo, Gears of War, and a few others.<br>  <br>  Wow, the guy right below me is a big 360 fanboy. I hardly think No More Heroes, RE4, CoD WAW, Cursed Mountain, Manhunt 2, Fatal Frame, Madworld, and The House of the Dead Overkill were made for five year olds. And what makes you automatically assume I don't own a 360? You are correct but surely you can't have expected me to never have played it. I have played it tons of times whether it be my uncle's or a friend's I have played it and it hasn't got the same feel as the Wii. Tell me how do you feel about paying $50 for Xbox Live? How do you feel about buying a Wireless Internet Adapter for $100? How do you feel about the company you worship having to shell out millions of dollars just for a game to come out on their system? How do you feel about getting the Red Rings of Death? How do you feel about having nearly every game you have come out on the PS3? How do you feel knowing that the 360 only focuses on bloody shooters and not its other games like Viva Pinata and Banjo Kazooie? How do you feel knowing that half of the games that are on the 360 are on the PC? How do you feel knowing that Nintendo will always be one step ahead in gaming and that they will always have something new while the Xbox will die when the originality dies? You are terribly biased and that has caused you to fail to take a look at the Wii and what it offers to gamers. Exclusives, new way to play, old systems games on it, opens its self up to people besides gamers, and the fact knowing that it was made by the greatest gaming company out there: Nintendo. So before you say the 360 is better at everything, think for a sec, and maybe your answer won't be as you expected.|`|xwEPYEqSaa	The Wii, 360 has a smaller game lineup than PS3 and all the good games are already on PS3 so I say you get Wii. It has many good games like:<br>  Super Smash Bros<br>  Metroid Prime 3<br>  Mario Galaxy <br>  Resident Evil 4|`|6aWhKl1Laa	You should probably get the 360. I own both a PS3 and a Wii and I never play the Wii. There are some games on it that I like, but mostly crap comes to the Wii. I would enjoy a 360 more because of the games it has, and the overall playability. Sometimes Wii controls get confusing and don't work. The 360 also has graphics far superior to the Wii and it's online network is outstanding. <br>  And I don't know about you, but I have a lot more friends that own 360's and it would be nice to play with them sometimes.|`|3sWRv9xEaa	XBOX 360 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...<br>  <br>  Anyone who has an Xbox and a wii will take the xbox anyday <br>  none of these people have xboxes so they dont know sh!t<br>  <br>  Xbox360 is 100 times better....wii get old after a short while, unless your like 5 dont get it|`|RxLgqYzkaa	If I were you I would choose a Wii because they currently have more games coming out for it and better features on it too.

You won't find any more fun in the motion controls becuase it will get tiring. Also, after you get past super-smash bros. brawl, super mario galaxy, Mario Kart wii, and The legend of Zelda the system will get boring because Nintendo (if it follows suit from the last systems) will stop making great games and wait until they come up with another similar console.|`|QnGCpZFqaa	IMO<br>  If you want to a bunch of generic FPS play mainly online, 360 for sure.. But then again you have to pay for it.<br>  Wii has tons of hidden gems if you can find them, it has a bit of a broken online play but it getting better.<br>  Wii doesn't play dvds but you got a PS3 so that's not a factor.<br>  360 is basically the same as PS3 but its really up to you and what your looking for.<br>  <br>  These are the kind of questions that make FanBoys mad.|`|hwaTOBL7aa	Wii because, the the ps3 is basically a remake of the Xbox 360 and you already have a ps3 so get the Wii for a whole new experience.|`|9IV7LK7Eaa	i have a 360 and a wii. the wii has some amazing games.. just so much crap and shovel ware comes on it. :@<br>  the 360 is better for hardcore gamers... and cause you have a ps3 i  presume you are, so get the 360|`|KAQxmFZIaa	get a wii im using the internet on the wii now|`|PbhC7eonaa	xbox 360, unless youll have someone to always play with then go with a wii,but the xbox 360 is awesome especially when you get xbox live|`|pudI9ig5aa	Wii.

n3fGgrnuaa	The ONLY way for your iPod Touch to be on the INTERNET is to be connected to a WiFi (wireless internet).  You can download and "app" that will tell you where the FREE WIFI is in your area.  Starbucks has WiFi, many coffee shops advertise FREE WIFI so you can go there to buy coffee or hang out.<br>  <br>  I THINK WHAT YOU ARE SAYING IS:<br>  There is a store/shop/??? that broadcasts WiFi for you to use.  <br>  <br>  The only thing you need to do to KEEP that connection EVERY TIME YOU GO THERE is to choose it the first time and (if needed) the password.<br>  The next time you go to this store your Touch will:<br>  - ask you if you want to join xxxxxx (if it's a free connection) OR<br>  - automatically connect<br>  <br>  Either way, it will remember your settings and passwords (if needed) so you don't need to remember the IP address!<br>  <br>  Hope this answers your questions!|`|ATC7hmDFaa	what are u asking? what ipod is it? if its not itouch you cant go on the internet.|`|mk3gFkCJaa	Ipod touches allow you to go onto the internet but only if you have a wireless internet connection at home.

Search up "Bose QuietComfort", they are the best.|`|99hfFssXaa	well iPod earphones do work if you turn up a bit (like 2/3 or 3/4 of the way up) but in-ear earphones work much better to cancel out external sound|`|bcb5bce7aeb5e5a747203a085360538baa	no you will be able to hear it just fine
YiY9Yd2Jaa	If you can't develop enthusiasm for photography with a P&S then it is very likely that having a camera that is harder to use will not make matters better. DSLRs can certainly take better images under many conditions than a P&S but they require a better understanding of photography, plus they need several lenses - and many lenses cost more than the camera itself. The lenses that come in DSLR kits are often of lesser quality than the lenses on P&S cameras like the one you already have. To get professional results, you need a professional standard of lenses.<br>  <br>  You have recognised in yourself that you have previously wasted investment in technology - that is good. You are very likely to do the same again, based on your phrasing of the question. You don't fall in love with a camera, you fall in love with photography. Then you upgrade your camera as you reach the limits of the camera you already have.<br>  <br>  If for instance, you started rollerblading but was not really keen,  going out and buying a two thousand dollar pair of rollerblades would not make you keener - would it?<br>  <br>  Think it though. <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|a9398092706b68241341a0195af9943eaa	If you don't change your ways with photography you will still get blurry photos with a $5000- DSLR. You must read owner's manual and understand it. I suggest borrow a book from local library on the Basics of Photography. Even with point and shoots, no major camera company is going to manufacture cameras that produce blurry photos.<br>   I see you started Yahoo ans on my birthday, Mar 14, same B'day as Einstein and Billy Crystal. Go Yankees? I use to see Ford and Berra play in the Bronx many yrs ago.|`|sR3gcvubaa	Consider the size-DSLR's are NOT small. And the lenses are an addition to carry.  My DSLR, Nikon D40, doens't get used a lot, but when I need it I want a good, dependable camera to know I'm going the get the shots I want and need.  You do have to be careful and know your camera or you will end up with blurry shots.  You can master the p and s's and still have blurry slr photos.  Just do your homework and take lots of practice photos in all different lighting.  I am not sorry I got mine, in fact I really like it, but it does have its limitations because of its size.|`|55orqX2yaa	I love my DSLR, but not all people do, some of the things that you should consider is the over all size, and weight of the camera, plus if you plan on taking pictures of far away objects, you will probity need a second or even third lens.  So, if you do not like the weight at the store, it will be very cumbersome when you are shooting.  As for the focus, it will help a little because of the reduction in shutter lag, but other way you will have to be willing to use the manuel settings.|`|AA10722993	You may have a crummy camera, or you may just not know how to use your point & shoot.   Have you taken the time to read the manual that came with it?   Have you practiced using the many settings on the camera?  If not, it's no wonder you are getting bad pictures and don't enjoy the camera you have. <br>  <br>  If you get a DSLR, you will need to really study the manual so you understand how to use it.   Of course, you can leave it set on Auto, and use it like a point & shoot, but then you are defeating the purpose of having a DSLR.  <br>  <br>  I would suggest you go to a good camera store  like Ritz or Wolf, and talk to a knowledgeable salesperson.    Look at some cameras in your price range, and ask lots of questions.  See if you like the size and what it will do.  See how easy it is to go through the menu, and work the controls.  <br>  <br>  Remember that you will need to buy a good camera bag that will hold your camera and at least 2 lenses.   Also a UV filter to protect each lens that you have.  Possibly an extra battery and a couple of memory cards.<br>  <br>  A DSLR will give you great pictures, but not if you don't take the time to learn how to use it properly.  Good luck!|`|QxIhMHwAaa	I got my first dSLR this past December. I too had a point and shoot that I was totally disgusted with. I wasn't disgusted because of bad shots, but because I knew there was a lot more and better quality that I could be getting. I did a lot of research into cameras and ended up purchasing the Nikon D300. I could have gone with a "lesser" camera such as the D60 or 80, but I knew I would always be thinking "what if?" if I didn't get the 300. I LOVE MY CAMERA. <br>  <br>  It has been a decent learning curve, but for me, that is part of the fun. Although this is an advanced amateur/beginner pro camera, I'm really getting into photography and this camera is user-friendly enough for someone who is really willing to learn more. The only "problem" is that it is not a small camera...it's rather massive actually, but it is extremely sturdy. That doesn't bother me though...I'm rather proud as I take out my new "baby" and go to town practicing my shots and learning to take better and better photos.

wI95yTgLaa	Since it knows there is a signal from your wireless router, then it will probably ask for a security password. This password was given when you chose the security setting (security setting will say something like WEP (WEP is required for DS Wifi access) or WPA-TSK) for the router. Go to the router's registration website(if you haven't yet; register, it is required for online access) log in your password for your router. Look at the security setting on your router and type the password for it in. If that doesn't work you might want to unplug the router for a few minutes and plug it back in. If that doesn't work change your security settings and password. If that doesn't work call the router company or wii company/website. I hope this helped. :)|`|QnGCpZFqaa	You probably have to enter your password|`|VcAH6KUHaa	iv'e had that SAME problem. well, first get close enough to a router so it can find the access point to your router.

57480649613941c1fb8c81765ddf29f2aa	I believe that you should still be able to go through Microsoft for RROD.<br>  They give you three years to get repairs for RROD. Your receceipt would have a purchase date & a date is a date no matter what store you buy it from. Plus there's also the date that is on the back of the unit, which might be what they look at. It would still be a somewhat recent model dated no later than October of 2008, which would still give you until October of 2011.<br>  I'd say go ahead and buy it!|`|VNRbDlxNaa	Buy a xbox 360 i love mine it rocks.|`|QYlCApOFaa	From what I understand, the new xbox 360 is not supposed to get RROD.<br>  Even if it does, it's a cheap fix, so it may be worth it either way depending on how much you can pick up the system for.
1c56d6640f8046a9cd43f450d0c344a0aa	Ideally you would use any 75ohm digital coax cable. This is pretty much any video cable or digital coax cable. These cables are all the same whether they are made for component video, composite video or digital coaxial audio. Audio RCA cables are supposed to be 50 ohm cables and are therefore not ideal, but generally work, for digital coaxial applications as well.<br>  <br>  So, in short, yes go ahead and use any old RCA cable you have laying around.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind though that games, unless you have a sound card capable of Dolby digital live or DTS connect, will not output sound in surround sound via the digital connection. In addition, if you paid for an expensive sound card, using the digital coax connection will bypass almost all processing that you paid for.

AA12268061	Through the past few years, I have had the opportunity to use most of the major phones.  They are not all alike and the services are very different.  T-mobile is great in georgia but is terrible in alabama and especially in the mountains.  It does cut out as much and the service is excellent.  However, if the signal is bad it don't work.  My best recommendation is to ask to use each one on a month trial, I know they offer the service.  So you can use it and see if the signal is good in the areas you go or whether you have some dead spots.  For some reason, my greatest need for a phone is always in a dead spot.  <br>  <br>  Good luck.  Oh by the way, don't go over your minutes.  It can get very expensive.|`|a02e953ff27ebb1921f1e59c24f766f6aa	The great thing about T-Mobile is their sim card technology.

Cingular will give you the subsidy code if you meet the followong requirements<br>  You are a current customer for at least 90 days and you account is in good standing<br>  The phone was purchased though Cingular under contract or you paid full price<br>  If you meet those requirements, call again!! Call the after hours tech support number. Tell them you will be travelling overseas and you will be using a local sim card. They will then submit for the subsidy code and you should have it for free in about 1 week.<br>  If you dont meet those requirements, you can pay to have it unlocked through companys like GSM Liberty<br>  <a href="http://www.gsmliberty.net/shop/motorola-l7-slvr-imei-unlock-p-114.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.gsmliberty.net/shop/motorola-...</a><br>  Again, if you meet the requirements through Cingular, call again after 9pm eastern time to the after hours tech support, general customer service sometimes has no clue about unlocking.

YiY9Yd2Jaa	It is an older camera - released in August 2007 so it is unlikely to have a touch screen - they are fairly recent innovations, also the camera doesn't have a very good reputation for quality images. There were quite a few bad reviews of it. Lastly, the price that Amazon is asking is about double the prices that I just found with a quick Google search. At Christmas they were selling at around US $150.00. The current version of the S5xxx range, the S52c is a much better camera and is available through camera stores at better than the price Amazon wants for the S51.<br>  <br>  You might also look at some of the Panasonic or Sony range - they have some very good cameras that exceed Nikon specifications for similar prices. Sony make most of the Nikon sensors for Nikon cameras.|`|A9AkM8CDaa	I don't think the version (Nikon Coolpix S51) in the link you provided is a touch-screen.<br>  <br>  However, the Nikon Coolpix S60 is a touchcreen<br>  <a href="http://www.target.com/Nikon-Coolpix-10-0MP-Screen-Digital/dp/B001DO2XGQ" rel="nofollow">http://www.target.com/Nikon-Coolpix-10-0...</a>

RyvKws7Laa	The Panasonic is slightly better in overall picture because of a slight viewing angle superiority.  But if you're able to look the TV straight on and never need to be able to see it off to either side, then they are essentially even, right down the middle.  You're not going to get a major advantage going one way or the other.  For LCD I might slightly lean towards Samsung, because they are top dogs in LCDs in general, but between those two models you list its brutally tough to really pick a clear "winner."<br>  <br>  The other option, possibly in the same price range is the Sony Bravia KDL-32XBR6.  It has about the same viewing angle as the Samsung (so also inferior to the Panasonic).  But it has a 4th HDMI input (might be useful depending on how many devices you eventually want to stick into the thing).<br>  <br>  If you want to save some money you can nearly hold the picture quality of the others above with the Sony Bravia KDL-32L4000.  Again with the viewing angle score as the ones just mentioned.  Its quite a bit cheaper though.  Its only 720p though, but at 32" you'd have to be insanely close to the TV to really notice 1080p, and even then good luck seeing the difference (its pretty sketchy on a TV of that size).|`|XumFHbn8aa	Samsung! is best LCD TV & best price for you!<br>  Let Compare :<br>  Panasonic Viera TC-32LZ800 32-Inch <br>  Price: $857.74 Free Shipping  <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Viera-TC-32LZ800-32-Inch-1080p/dp/B0014CQE5S/ref=tonyreview-20?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&qid=1235785835&sr=1-1" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Viera-TC...</a><br>  So expensive and not popular<br>  <br>  Samsung LN32A550 32-Inch<br>  Price: $749.00 Free Shipping<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-LN32A550-32-Inch-1080p-HDTV/dp/B00141AYM8/ref=tonyreview-20?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&qid=1235786023&sr=1-1#" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-LN32A550-3...</a><br>  <br>  if you want to save more than 2 items please visit<br>  Samsung LN32A450 32-Inch <br>  Price: $545.00 Free Shipping <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-LN32A450-32-Inch-720p-HDTV/dp/B00141AYIC/ref=tonyreview-20?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&qid=1235786165&sr=1-1" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-LN32A450-3...</a><br>  <br>  I have no regrets about buying Sumsung 32in Television.

Because I was on a smaller budget, I had to get a cheaper brand.  Personally, I researched a lot of televisions. I also went to a lot of electronics departments and compared. Both of the sets you mention, I did compare. As far as picture quality and sound, I thought Samsung was the best one of all. Plus, a lot of the newer Samsung models now have built in surround sound and volume control. I was gonna get the 32", but I guess I sacrificed quality for something bigger. I hope I don't regret it that much!

I57hJ9njaa	Well if you're not counting games, both systems are a little different. The PS3 is better in terms of new technology, but only slightly so. Blu-Ray allows better graphics and in a sense you save money, but the PS3 is newer and there are probably still bugs that need to be patched. I actually enjoy the XBOX 360 a lot and it's hard to decide which one is actually "better" without accounting for the games being made for it.|`|381e3207230460fe8521d523304a91a6aa	It's the game exclusives that makes 1 console better than the other.

N2rntAqvaa	There is a *rumor* that the 80GB PS3 will cost 300$ instead of 400$ in April.  Not many people know about the 160GB.  But don't be afraid just because Sony would deny it, because just like the other guy said, why would a company tell the public about a price drop?  They want as many people as they can get to buy the PS3 for an expensive price.  Sony has lost a lot of money from the PS3, because it was very expensive in the beginning (VERY expensive) and it is still expensive now.  They can't lose more money, so the estimated time for them to get SOME money from customers until they can drop the prices is until April.<br>  <br>  Start saving up as soon as you can.  Hope you get enough money!!|`|0AUTZt5Aaa	There are rumours of it dropping to $300 for the 80GB and $400 for the 160GB in April 2009.<br>  <br>  Start saving!|`|vs3vz6lIaa	well people have been saying it will drop and a couple of months or more but i herd in like April or May it will have a 100 dollar drop which will have many buying the PS3 hope this was your best answer o and that will make the 80GB one go to 299-220 it will range and i think the best one to get is the 80GB one|`|mb3ooc3uaa	Its all rumors and speculation, but sites are saying a $100 price drop sometime between now and June. With a majority saying it will happen in April. Some guy in Sony denied it, but he denied the last price cut before it happened as well. Why would you say yes, in 2 months we will have a price cut. Then people who were gonna buy it would just wait and Sony lose more money.|`|KTzBMxSeaa	unfortunately, the price will drop to "poor college student" level when the ps FOUR comes out.  probably sometime around 2011/2012

You can read the voltage at the source, it is the same throughout the system. I have no clue what your "little voltage detector" is or how you are setting it off, just crawling around in the attic.

mK3XsYEIaa	On the front of the Wii, between the reset button and the eject disk button, there is a lttle door. Open this and you will find a memory card slot and a little red button that says "sync". You will find a button like this one on the back of the Wiimote where you put the batteries at. While the Wii is on, press the red button on the Wii while pressing the red button on the Wii mote. This will sync up your Wiimote to the Wii. This way, you can just turn on the Wiimote and it will automatically be connected with the Wii. You can do this with all of the Wiimotes and which ever Wiimote you turn on first will be the first player, the second one on will be second player and so on and so forth.|`|uctxzjIIaa	I've seen this happen a few times for some reason (in my case, one remote got stuck always being Player 2).<br>  <br>  The best way to fix it is to turn on your Wii, and then hold the red Synch button on the system for at least 15 seconds.

YiY9Yd2Jaa	This year things are a little different. After the first quarter (end of March) as companies are reporting the lowest profit in decades, they will begin price discounting to move stock and generate cash flow before the end of financial year (June) annual reports are due. I would strongly suggest waiting another couple of months to avoid paying far too much and kicking yourself when you see heavily discounted pricing. <br>  <br>  This has to happen, in a recession or depression - however you regard it, people stop buying all but essential things - and bargains. If companies want to keep trading, they need to be offering bargains. Already car companies are offering thousands of dollars off new prices in an effort to keep trading. This will spread to all consumer electronics - including cameras.|`|0AqkCOWIaa	I got my D40 from amazon for around $470, now, you can get the D40 in a kit for around $430. You don't save much quite frankly. This might sound ironic, but the prices will actually go up. Look at the Rebel XTI, it price has in fact gone up since the XSI has been out. In short, just get the camera now, it's not going to be considerably less expensive in the summer.|`|1jFG5h1iaa	Last summer I purchased the D60. I paid around $650 with a 18-55mm VR kit. That was a pretty good deal. The other day I was looking at what I would've saved if I had waited but prices have not gone down at all. I think it would be worth it to buy now and if you would've saved $15 then that's great. But the truth is the longer you wait to buy a camera, the cheaper it gets because the technology gets older and older. If it was me I would just buy it now. Good luck.|`|XumFHbn8aa	Please waiting another couple of months ...<br>  but today amazon.com offer the best price and no shipping cost . if you don't want to wait you can reviews on many camera for your budget!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Digital-SLRs-Cameras-Photo/b/ref=tonyreview-20?ie=UTF8&node=3017941&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=center-5&pf_rd_r=0WBM36S1F6SWNBD5E7Y0&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=463959351&pf_rd_i=515382011" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Digital-SLRs-Camer...</a><br>  <br>  i hope that help..

kgTPnjhkaa	it is not legal to:<br>  burn gamedisks such as the wii that you wanted or burn<br>  Download MP3's off of Kazaa (or other file-'sharing' programs like lime wire) from CDs that you do not personally own... regardless of whether or not you burn them to a CD. And yes... we all do it anyway. Interesting discussion topic here, I'm sure.<br>  Burn copies of CDs that you own for any purpose other than backup. If you burn a copy of a great CD you own in order to give it to a friend, you've just violated copyright law! Yay! <br>  <br>  The question here isn't whether it's illegal to burn CDs or download MP3s... the question is whether you care. I'm not going to make a value judgment in here and tell you that burning and downloading is an issue that is clear-cut, black-and-white, etc.... because I do not believe that it is. <br>  BTW, the law that restricts this sort of behaviour (burning and downloading) is Title 17 of United States code.... otherwise known as "Copyright Law". Go to www.copyright.gov for more info.|`|bhSb6SBaaa	You probably wouldn't go to jail but it would be considered destruction of someones property.

They will, however, sue you for possibly more than few thousand dollars per game you downloaded/burned.|`|oZgDxBTGaa	No you won't go.

Once the card opens it looks like another drive in the directory structure and you simply drag and drop the images to wherever you want them. The images will be inside a directory on the card, sometime two levels down. <br>  <br>  You need to be careful about letting a windows computer load and display the images directly from the card if you want to still be able to review them on the camera. Sometimes there are some small changes made to the file by the the windows app that prevents some cameras from recognising the images again.|`|nQ7G1nBVaa	I put the card in the card reader and let the Camera and scanner wizard copy them

I got my sidekick from that site and all I had to do was fill in my zipcode.  A sidekick is pretty neat also, you can communicate with your friends online through instant messaging and also you can talk to them with like a phone.  You should def get one from that site, its totally worth it.

AA10031269	I'd go with the Sanyo M1, Hands Down! I have had many phones, I've been with Sprint for over 7 years and have owned at least 21 different phones from them, and Sanyo has ALWAYS had the best build quality, and usability. Plus they take a beating with no problem. My second fav. is Samsung M610 (it lacks a few features of the Sanyo, but is much slimmer). I am leaving my Samsung A-920 for the M1, and my wife is leaving an A-900 (blade) for the M610. My M1 is ordered already, can't wait to get it after all the reviews and research. Good luck.

6EYNp9e0aa	As far as i know you cant transfer DVDs to a Creative Zen Vision:M without downloading or buying some-kind of software. I own a Creative Zen Vision:M and I have transferred many DVDs to my ZVM flawlessly with a program called 'Pocket DVD Wizard' it does cost about $25 but i personally think its worth it. it has a very simple user interface and you just pop the DVD in and it will rip the DVD to .avi format and then u load that movie file from your desktop that will be labeled 'dvdfull' to your Creative Zen Vision:M....you can get a free trial download from www.pocketdvdwizard.com<br>  <br>  <br>  There is another way of converting a DVD to .avi format with two free programs called: DVD Decrypter and AutoGK but you have to be very computer inclined to be able to do this without screwing something up. There is a step by step guide on how to do this at this link...<a href="http://www.anythingbutipod.com/archives/2006/03/zen-vision-m-dvd-ripping-guide.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.anythingbutipod.com/archives/...</a><br>  If you insist on not paying anything for this conversion software you can try this method but it is much more time consuming and i find it rather confusing.

If you have the movies on DVD, you would have to rip them and take off the protection with DVD Shrink, which you can find by searching the internet. So, order of things to do:<br>  <br>  1. Use DVD Shrink to convert DVD to ".iso" image<br>  <br>  2. Use video converter to convert to MPEG.<br>  <br>  3. Delete old files except MPEG<br>  <br>  4. Load movie onto Zen!|`|2329cac66612027d0e57de0c97a37df4aa	if you don't want to buy the software download it on creative website. first you need to convert dvd to mpeg then transfer it to your player using the software provided on your product
a5cbaf692279e2b3a7875d0373d1ee70aa	Pixel shifting is essentially what it sounds like. The pixels move around very slightly, so they don't remain in the place for an extended period of time thus causing burn in. This technology is in a lot of plasma's but they all call it something else. LG has this technology and they call it the "Orbiter" mode.<br>  <br>  LG uses what they call an ISM (Image Sticking Minimization) method. For normal usage (when you are not watching 4:3 or one channel for a long time) you can leave the ISM at normal. If you think that you have burnin on your screen you can switch to the whitewash mode and leave it there till the burnin clears. When you are playing video games or you are going to be on one channel for a long time (4hrs +) you can use the "orbiter" mode where the image will move slightly every two minutes. There is also an inversion mode to remove colour fading on the screen.<br>  <br>  However, if you use your plasma smartly you can avoid image burn in. That means, you dont watch the CNBC stock ticker for 12 hours a day. If this is what you are buying a tv for then an LCD will work better. Plasma is much better for normal viewing than an LCD. Everything looks good in HD. I have three TV's, two plasma (one LG) and one LCD and I love my plasma's<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|448f6da7073d5b651b60dce3abd1c108aa	I have a cheap 2 yr old plasma with major problems and a new LCD.

6891b4980923a3e04163e759b1ff7410aa	It's not that hard. My fiance has a band and they record their own music. They have a four input recorder which they plug the instruments and mics into. They play and record the songs on a tape. Then he hooks the recorder up to the computer and transfers it onto the computer. From there he uses a program to mix the sound and fix it up. Then he simply burns the whole thing on a CD. He seems to have no problems doing it this way, but you have to have the money for the equipment!|`|4zWcdvo1aa	What do you want to record? What do you want to spend?  If you just want to make a quick recording, use the Windows sound recorder and plug your mic into your sound card.  Audacity is a free recording program you can download.  <br>  <br>  If you want to record/mix a few tracks you may want to look at PG Musics Powertracks, it rates with the big name programs for only 50. They also have a program called 'band in a box' you type in the chords and it generates a full backing band for you.   Get yourself a audio interface for your computer like a Audiophile 2496($100)also a small mixer, microphone (Shure SM57 or 58) and set of headphones to get started.<br>  <br>  Once you've recorded you can easily burn to CD.<br>  <br>  hope this helps.
c6e62a921410961b12b5404c17236bf1aa	Yes.<br>  You are running into the dreaded "Macromedia" copy protection device.  God only knows how they managed to create such an animal, but it works!  Your image quality during copying looks fine as you record, but when you play the copy back the image falls apart miserably, right?  OR EVEN WORSE...your DVD burner is flashing a message telling you that you can't copy that VHS tape.  The way to get around the first problem (poor image quality) is to run your VCR through the Zima Copymaster or similar video enhancer.  This strengthens the signal so that the recorder will capture the image better.  If you're getting a message saying you can't copy the tape, that is a much more difficult situation and I have not found a way around that one apart from setting up a video camera and copying it by filming the TV screen as you play the movie.(Not very good quality but better than nothing.)<br>  <br>  Good luck and I hope this helps!  <br>  <br>  I only submit this info in an effort to assist you in making your own personal back-up copy of copyrighted material which is not intended for redistribution or resale.  I personally honor copyright laws and stand behind them and encourage you to do the same.  We as consumers pay only a tiny fraction of the cost that goes into a movie production in order to have a copy for our own personal use and I believe the price is a bargain considering all the talented personnel and hard work that goes into movie production.|`|KDVWvmrFaa	afterdawn.com<br>  i believe theres sum hacking and modding involved though|`|ePYk7cPUaa	Macrovision is a form of copy protection, in which fake AGC signals are embedded in the video signal in the VBI(Vertical Blanking Interval).<br>  <br>  In a nutshell, it works by confusing the recording VCR into thinking that the picture is too bright, then too dark.<br>  <br>  All modern VCR's(and indeed, DVD-recorders) use what is called an AGC - Automatic Gain Control.<br>  <br>  One of the main purposes of this thing, is to control the overall brightness of the picture.<br>  <br>  What Macrovision does, is to tell the AGC at one instant, that the picture is very dark, when it actually isn't.<br>  The AGC therefore tries to compensate, by applying automatic increase in brightness, which results in the picture on the screen actually almost vanishing into a bright white.<br>  <br>  A couple of seconds later, the Macrovision tells the AGC that the picture is now too bright, and the AGC tries to compensate by drastically lowering the brightness, when it in fact, is just fine.  This results in the picture then fading from the bright white, into an almost negative image, with very dark colour, and no brightness at all.<br>  <br>  In most cases, the drop into the dark area is so severe, that the rest of the video processing circuit inside the VCR loses it vertical-lock on the picture frame, and the picture rolls vertically on the screen.<br>  <br>  Most TV's don't have this AGC, so they tend to simply ignore the Macrovision in the VBI part of the video signal.<br>  <br>  This is not to say that TV's are immune - lots of modern TV's show evidence of bad colour and green-pastel type dis-colouration in the top half of the frame, but most people tend to just ignore it.<br>  <br>  Technically, Macrovision should not exist within the video signal, which is why some TV's have a hard time trying to cope.<br>  <br>  Many very old VCR's and TV's ignore the Macrovision completely, as neither the VCR nor the TV have an AGC circuit, which is why copy-protected VHS tapes can usually be copied using a very old VCR as the recoding device.<br>  <br>  There are devices which can correct the VBI information, and make coping possible, but these are strictly illegal(as they circumvent official copy-protection technology), and if you are found to have used one of these by the powers that be, the lawyers will be calling on you!!!<br>  :p
SXoXedgOaa	Yes, you can.<br>  If you have no red connector then you have a mono VCR, no stereo.<br>  You can mixyour mono (white) signal to both stereo channels with the DVD authoring software or you can use the other channel for your own things, whatever you like. The possibilities are endless.|`|7ca44a3727786e789f15a19554574c39aa	Yes, as long as they aren't in stereo.

Dfr6uA91aa	There are two different programming languages the TI-84+ calculator can run. One is TI-Basic, the other is Z80 Assembly.<br>  <br>  TI-Basic is the simplest and easiest to learn, but since it is an interpreted language it can be quite slow and is very weak. Most math-related programs are written in TI-Basic, as well as some games. However, there cannot be anything too advanced, as TI-Basic is simply not capable of that.<br>  TI-Basic programs can be made right on the calculator, using the built-in program editor accessible via [Prgm] > New. You can also program on the computer using software such as TI-GraphLink or TI-ProgramEditor, then transferring the file to your calculator.<br>  <br>  As far as I know, most of the software were created on the Windows platform, but there have also been Mac ports of TI-Connect and GraphLink. So while there it may work on a Mac, there might not be as much support available.<br>  <br>  Z80 Assembly is the lowest level programming language for the Z80 processor, the chip that powers the TI-84+. While it is much faster and advanced than TI-Basic, it is ridiculously difficult to learn. I definitely recommend having prior programming experience before attempting to learn Z80 Assembly, else it will be overwhelming. Z80 Assembly allows higher functions not normally accessible in TI-Basic; pretty much anything to do with the processor at a low-level. <br>  More advanced games such as Mario, Phoenix, etc are written in Z80 Assembly, and they are usually programmed on the computer, compiled, converted to a .8xp file, then transferred to the calculator. However, assembly programs are increasing that allow Asm programming on the calculator instead, but this is generally not a good idea for beginners because if even one small error occurs, it could permanently crash the calculator.<br>  <br>  As for using MirageOS, TI-Basic files can be read by MirageOS if the first line begins with another colon. For example:<br>  ::"MyPrgm<br>  ://code here<br>  This TI-Basic program would now appear in MirageOS, with a description of "MyPrgm".<br>  <br>  In assembly, a special header must be written in order for the program to be read by MirageOS, and is much more complicated.<br>  <br>  All-in-all, I would recommend learning TI-Basic first to get the gist of things. Then, after you've mastered it, start picking up assembly. Good luck.

16be70a6930dbf796981595e45bf88f6aa	i think you would go to MENU then go down to TOOLS, after that click on VOICE MEMO then click the NEW button.  it should say something like PLEASE RECORD AT THE TONE. when your done just click DONE.  at least that's how mine works.  hoped it helped.  p.s. make sure you hold the phone close to the speaker of the radio.  and try not to move the phone around because then when you play it back it will get loud then quiet then loud then quiet.  and make sure you record it louder than usual because it will play back softer.  it may take you a couple of tries to get it just the way you want it.  but even if you get the timing perfect, its still not going to come in perfectly clear, but it should come in pretty understandable.|`|44332dbfb6690b0d3565d73afcd5417faa	HI, you can go to 3gforfree.com and you should be able to get free ringtones depending on your service, or go to mixxer.com, find the song that you liked on the radio and have it sent to your phone as a ringtone
YzjMIHrUaa	the new one (5) is really good there are many new layouts and things you couldnt do with the other i recomend upgrading :) and yes you can make a playlist and searching for songs is sooo much easier. If you put your curson over the search it will have an x in the box to stop the search|`|DWBN7wDbaa	I have been using P2P programs for over 5 years now, and I highly suggest not using limewire. I can also say that WinMX is still by far the best one out of all of them. The original owners gave up on WinMX, and the community came together and got it back up. And now it has more features than before.<br>  <br>  Unlike Limewire, WinMX protects you from the RIAA/MPAA by blocking them from even getting on the network, it removes all fake files from your search results so you never get fake files, and it's fast and easy to use and NO SPYWARE!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.patchwinmx.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.patchwinmx.com</a>|`|l23ttRePaa	I wouldn't recommend Limewire to anyone. Be very, very careful as I speak from first hand experience when I let you know that my nephew was on my computer and was downloading some crap from that site that put a gigantic virus in it and nearly destroyed my whole system.<br>  <br>  Luckily, my son is a computer technician and he saved the majority of it for me but I lost a lot as well. He also said that if my idiotic nephew had told someone when he saw it happening that he could have been able to save more. <br>  <br>  Later my nephew told me that it started spreading like wildfire and he was afraid to tell anyone....GEESH...<br>  <br>  Hope this helped somewhat ... have a great day.
tKWwZpOAaa	its probably the camera, but try to use a low ISO and dont shoot things with high contrast or toward bright lights.|`|3dzuYTC5aa	Make sure all your setting are on medium.... like it its a 1,2,3,4,5 choose a 3. if its a -2,-1,0,1,2 then choose 0.

LKiVXEcCaa	fallout 3 just has a couple things most games dont. You can switch from 1st person shooter style or to 3rd person like gta IV. Also the map is huge and fully free range, basiclly you can do whatever whenever. You can choose to be good or bad, its set in post apocalipse, you kill super mutants, raiders, slave traders, mutated animals, etc.Because the game is so free range you can do the main quest or walkaround find area's and do different 'mini' quests. All in all its pretty bad @ss|`|4Pk6VNftaa	It's a great game. <br>  <br>  If you're familiar with the first two Fallout games, it should already be clear why you'd want to buy the game.  If you have a Gametap subscription, you can play the first two games there, or you can find them in the store for like $10.  You don't need to have played them to enjoy Fallout3 though.<br>  <br>  The Fallout games take place after a nuclear war wipes out everything.  Your character is the descendant of people who took refuge in a bomb shelter before the bombs fell.  However, some situation has arisen and now you need to venture into the outside world.<br>  <br>  The world of Fallout is a mixture of the grim reality of a post-apocalyptic world mixed with some macabre humor and over-the-top violence (exploding headshots.)  <br>  <br>  The game itself is a RPG.  Your character has various stats and skills that you use to work through the game.  Depending on how you design your character, how you resolve various problems may differ.  If your character is good at talking and negotiation, you might be able to avoid combat, for instance.  On the other hand, if you make your character big, strong and stupid, combat will be easier for you but people probably won't talk to you much.<br>  <br>  Combat itself is mostly realtime.  You can pause the action to issue a command, like using an item.  Attacking allows you to choose your shot.  A head shot will do more damage but is harder to hit.  Also some critters don't respond like you'd think they would after being shot in the head...<br>  <br>  The game world is fairly open allowing you to choose whether you're going to follow the main story quests, or just go off on your.  This also gives you lots of replayability.|`|45f16ecdf3512cfd43cf659533ee6503aa	This game is only second (in my book) to Mass Effect... Totally worth every penny you pay for it, it lasts a LONG time, and is a very long game.  They also are coming out with alot of DLC for it, so the way I figure, this game will be in your xbox for a long time.<br>  <br>  I had a hard time getting used to the controls, but after that, everything is smooth as butter.  If you liked Oblivion, you will LOVE this.|`|F5lCFvqeaa	I usually don't play RPGs, but I did like Fallout 3.  Just don't go into it thinking like it's a shooter.  The game requires talking to other characters, if you really want to accomplish anything, so it can get slow at times.<br>  <br>  It can be a little boring at first, if you don't usually play RPGs.  But, the story does pick up.
Ty6vGEj9aa	Buy a touch. :P Just kidding.<br>  <br>  Perhaps try asking your family? One of them might have found it, if you live with any. If you have a little bro, that would be my first stop. Those things are jelous little suckers. Under objects, small or big. Maybe you were recently at a friends house? Try calling him/her. You may just have dropped it so try visiting a police station, or whatever you go to for place when you lose something. I hope you find it soon, so you don't have to compromise to my first suggestion. Or worse--nothing at all.
RpCwfcRzaa	Yes you can. If you look under your hard drive in the system section, you can see that the full saved game is separate from the game progress saves. You can delete the full save without hurting the progress saves.|`|NSWG8T1Qaa	Alternatively, you can also delete the game content (but not the savegames, downloads etc.) by using the same method you used to install the game to HDD.<br>  <br>  i.e. pop game disc in, go to My Xbox, press Y for 'Game Details'.  This is where you normally install game to HDD.  However, now it presents you with an option to 'Delete form Hard Drive'.  Rest assured that this ONLY deletes the copied disc data stored on HDD, and will not tamper with savegames etc.

cfdaa128dfa2a07a157aa79c35d7f3abaa	The ~ means alternating current (AC).  The plus or minus is the tolerance, meaning that it is okay if the power varies that much.  So it can vary 10% or in this case 23 volts.  So anywhere from 207 - 253 volts is acceptable.  The 50Hz is the frequency of the alternating current; the number of times the polarity switches back and forth per second.  The 21 mA is 21 milliamps, or 0.021 amps.  VA means volts times amps or volt amps, so that is basically the input wattage (technically, there is a difference because of the sine waves of AC and RMS, but we don't need to go there).  The 4.8 VA part is the input wattage.  They got the 4.8 figure from multiplying the 230 volts with the 0.021 amps (and rounding).<br>  <br>  You are right that the output wattage is 1.3135 watts.  That is obtained my multiplying 3.7 volts by the output current of .355 amps (355 mA, must convert the units).<br>  <br>  Yes, it is correct to base your answer only on the output.  How much the transformer requires is irrelevant to what the phone requires.  The input parameters could have been for the US, 120V~±5%/60Hz/40mA/4.8VA.  The output parameters could have been made the same as what you gave, even in that case.|`|AA10675415	230V~±10% = 230 volts give or take 10 percent "this is A.C."<br>  50Hz = 50 Hertz<br>  21mA = 21 Milli-Amps<br>  4.8VA = 4.8 Volts ?

bC5OAfs5aa	The best way is to transfer all old music on your iPod back to your computer and iTunes. In this case, all songs/videos are on your iTunes library that you can syn with whenever you wish to without deleting any files.<br>  For a better transfer, you can use Tansee iPod Transfer<br>  <a href="http://gutensoft.com/Utilities/Tansee-iPod-Transfer.htm" rel="nofollow">http://gutensoft.com/Utilities/Tansee-iP...</a><br>  It ensures proven easy and secure transfer<br>  <br>  With just a few simple clicks, it will help you transfer all songs and videos (both purchased and non-purchased) on my iPod back to your computer completely and safely, then you can add those files into iTunes library effortlessly. <br>  It even has step-by-step guide.<br>  <br>  You can also search more at <a href="http://www.ask.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.ask.com</a><br>  Best luck!|`|UyI0Bdmpaa	Well... You can only add one music library being yours family members etc. Each itunes has a library so if you like music in that library go ahead import it to your ipod. But if you want to sync your ipod to some one else library it will delete the music in your ipod and exchange it for your friends library.. in other words, you can only have one library in your ipod at a time so there's no; oh I like the music in my library and my friends library, so let me mix it up... and when you have new music in your library that you don't have in your ipod, plug in your ipod click on the device(ipod) then go to the little tab that says "music" and click the little check in boxes for the songs you want.
d6WMmjn7aa	Call at&t customer service. They're able to take facts, and use logic and reason when it comes to contracts. Despite the fact that everyone thinks at&t is the big bad telephone company, they're usually willing to work with customers. Having worked there before, they stressed doing everything possible to make sure the customer leaves happy. However, if you signed a contract, then you signed a contract. The only way you get month to month is by being an employee, or having a contract that's up which you haven't re-signed.|`|1oj4aamaaa	You can probably get out of it, but expect to pay some sort of penalty or fee.|`|e871c3bc7828a54588e8b88635cfba63aa	Have you tried asking for another phone on your contract?
44qG7oUdaa	Hey there<br>  <br>  maybe this is what you are looking for|`|Y4s4Om38aa	Depends on a lot of factors.....assuming its used, not new....that would bring it down.  Look into what the demand for it is right  now.....can judge that by if it is going for rediculous prices on other ebay auctions.  Also would depend on the game assortment.  If they are games that if someone would like one game they would most likely like all of them, then you might get more.  If someone is veiwing half the games to be  "throw away" games that they dont care about, you likely wouldnt get as much.<br>  <br>  Also, you might want to look into what wiis by themselfs and game lots by themselfs are going for.  Might be able to get more selling the wii and extra remote with the wii sports and then selling the games seperately as 1 or 2 lots including the zapper with a game that uses it.  <br>  <br>  Id say best way to figure, between 60-90% of face value of a new wii and remote for a used wii, higher if demand for wiis is still high....lower end if it is not and someone wanting a wii paying less.   Could maybe assume 50-75% of new cost of games, depending on game and interest.   And with ebay, can always end up getting lucky and getting someone that really wants it, and doesnt care if they overpay.  There is also always the chance if you put it up for auction at the wrong time that it goes for a very low amount......would at least start it at the minimum you are willing to sell it for to prevent that.|`|6Q3vDpccaa	It depends on the games but probably around ￡220 - ￡270.<br>  <br>  That breaks down as:<br>  Wii - ￡120<br>  Controllers - ￡50<br>  Games - ￡50 to ￡100|`|rduVctOraa	I got all of my info from here
4Pk6VNftaa	DLC you buy is locked to both the profile that bought it, and the console that it was downloaded to.<br>  <br>  Say you used your profile on your home console to download the DLC for Fallout 3.  This means any profile on that console can also use the DLC in their game of Fallout 3.  The profile doesn't even have to be on Live.<br>  <br>  However, if you go over to a friend's house, and recreate your profile there, you can redownload and use the Fallout 3 DLC - but only if you are logged into live.  No other account on that console can use the DLC unless they also paid for it.<br>  <br>  Microsoft provides a utility on their xbox360 website that lets you change which is your primary console, which is useful if you end up having to replace your 360 for some reason.|`|5d3857ef7e838b0d10440e9b9f7eb802aa	It depends.<br>  <br>  If uve used ur account to share stuff with other consoles, then yes, u need to use ur xbox live profile to play it.<br>  <br>  If u havent actually shared stuff that u bought, with friends, etc. then ull be fine. It should work fine on ur offline profile.<br>  <br>  <br>  Xbox Live locks the content to the profile only if other live profiles get it from that profile.<br>  So if u havent, then its fine.

6GIrW5eWaa	review the set list for both games decide which one you want by that. As the other responder stated there is no story line so your not missing anything there. One advantage 2 has over 1 is that you don't have to have a second person to have a band so you can get further in a career on 2 over 1. The other thing that you can do is borrow a friends copy of 1 if you have anyone that has it and import (for a small fee) the songs from 1 over to 2. Some insight to the game and a couple of opinions as well. I would get 2 if I were you.<br>  <br>  And definately the instuments for 2 are much better than 1, wireless vs wired hands down 2 wins there|`|RpCwfcRzaa	I'd go with Rock Band 2. Since it's a music game, you won't be missing anything like a story line by not playing 1 and the instruments for the second one are much better.

e8e0e4cc6750f11d7eebfe0f3af8eb0daa	It shouldn't blow up on you.  Most fuses are rated at more than the device requires.  Sometimes up to 50% more.  A device with a 10 amp fuse may only draw 5 amps in normal use.  The difference between a 6 amp and a 6.3 amp is almost pointless to worry about.  It certainly shouldn't hurt anything to try it.  Just make sure that the original fuse isn't something like a "slow blow".  This means it takes a while for it to open.  This allows for a higher starting current when the device is turned on but it will still open at the required over-current.  <br>  The only problem I see with this is that the 6.3 amp fuse may be a special size and a standard fuse might not fit.  In that case you'll have to find a repair shop to buy a replacement for the original fuse.|`|OlAIfxmkaa	The fuse in a TV prevents the TV from using too much electricity and damaging some of the internal components. If a fuse is rated for 6.3 then that means the the absolute maximum amount of current it can handle is about 6.3. If your TV blows a 6 amp fuse then something might be wrong with your TV.

6qsTmMQaaa	Unfortunately, you are unable to take songs from your iPod and put them back onto your computer. I've tried numerous times, and have failed each time, so I've given up hope on that. The only way to remove a song you don't want on your iPod is to delete them. However, if you want to transfer them to a compact disc, you might be able to make a playlist in your iPod, and transfer the songs to a disc from there. However, don't hold me accountable if that doesn't work, as I do not know for sure whether that will work or not.

b8tgCAQJaa	Sandisk is the premier brand when it comes to SD cards but you pay a higher price, as you've found.<br>  <br>  Consider that the Sandisk cards may have a longer lifespan and be more reliable, which is a major plus point if you're going to be using the camera to take pictures of sentimental value.<br>  <br>  The question you need to ask is: "what is the hassle/cost to me if I end up losing all of the pictures on this card". If the answer is "very little", go for the cheapest brand you can find, if it's "a lot", go for Sandisk.|`|1jFG5h1iaa	I would highly recommend buying two 4gb cards instead of one 8. This way if one breaks then you will have another one. There is really no difference between a really expensive memory card and a not so expensive one. One might be better but there's no reason why the cheaper one wouldn't do just as good of a job. If it was be I would get two of the 4gb cheaper cards. Also if you go to Staples or something then they should have a pack of two 4gb cards. That's where I got my two 4gb cards.

Set the converter to 3gp and convert the video. Once it downloads to your computer you can put in on your card and on your phone. I've done it before. Be aware, however, that you wont be able to send the videos to other phones from your phone (most likely) because the files are so big.<br>  <br>  hope that helped<br>  <br>  by the way make sure your phone has a micro sd card slot before you buy one.

Ils prennent souvent l'occident pour modèle ou base de comparaison.<br>  Ex : Il a fallut attendre que Takeshi Kitano soit reconnu comme un génie du cinéma par l'Occident pour que les Japonais osent revendiquer son talent et son originalité en tant que spécificité japonaise.

m4MpYXvdaa	Each wireless carrier was given guidelines that if people WANTED to have their cell phone numbers listed, that the cell phone company should allow their customers this as an option.  <br>  <br>  Of course an announcement went out saying this, and people freaked out and read this information backward..  Like "Oh my god they are going to make cell phone numbers listed?"<br>  <br>  So here's the deal, call your wireless company and ask them if they sell or release their cell phone records for public listings.  ( Most of them will say NO they don't do that, they would loose to many customers.)<br>  <br>  But if you WANT your number to be out their listed, you can go to hundreds of websites where you can personally post your cell phone info, so that it will appear it listings to the public.  Most of these internet companies will sell these lists to any sales companies who want them.<br>  <br>  In my experience managing hundreds of cell phone accounts, the only public listing problems I've found is where someone posted somebody else's info because they were being malicious, or the number belonged to someone else before and they did it, or the person who registered to a website and posted their number to the list - thought it was for friends to text message them or some other weird thing, and they didn't realize that it was a website to publicize your cell number.<br>  <br>  As far as do not call lists, why stick your phone number on any list?

Perchè è molto simile alla Play3 ma costa molto meno|`|iiSOXTeXaa	Play station 3 grafica perfetta e buoni giochi...|`|ivKtEfx2aa	playstation 3 , grafica imbattibile e prezzo buono|`|rCnrmWmHaa	ALLLORA IO SONE DEL PARERE KE PER ADESSO LA MIGLIORE E LA PS3 PERKè DI GRAFICA è STUPENDA è CARINA ANKE DA VEDERE E CI SI DIVERTE UN SACCO...MA ANKE LA XBOX 360 NN SKERZA INFATTI HA MOLTI PIù GIOCHI ANKE SE DI GRAFICA SECONDO ME NN è COME LA PS3.UNICO DIFETTO DELLA PS3 è IL COSTO CMQ SE NN SEI POVERELLO TE LA CONSIGLIO.INVECE SE VUOI RISPARMIARE UN PO COMPRA LA XBOX 360..|`|4fdc09c3b29e12c5e44153ce6adeb242aa	Playstation 2 xchè ha una buona grafica e sopratutto puoi giocare anche con i cd originali della 1..secondo me è la migliore come qualità-prezzo|`|ab9c173cca5e9554b4374ba08d19e59daa	La PlayStation 3 ma anche la Wii.|`|J9HRL9Wpaa	penso la wii, xkè puoi fare molte cs e anke la grafica è carina, ma nn perfetta|`|b30z5MGaaa	ogni console ha dei punti di forza e debolezza...<br>  <br>  la play 3 forse sarebbe la migliore, ma il prezzo è ancora abb alto...<br>  <br>  l'xbox 360 forse è la soluzione di mezzo, ma nn raggiunge la play 3 come grafica, specie se quest'ultima è abbinata a un televisore HD<br>  <br>  infine in casa nintendo si piange un pò... però l'idea che è alla base del WII nn è da sottovalutare... secondo me il futuro è rendere i giochi più interattivi e coinvolgenti, sempre più vicini alla realtà virtuale... la WII è il primo passo, spero ne seguano altri...|`|f920c8D3aa	dipende da che giocatore sei te se sei un giocatore che gioca molto in casa con dei bei giochi anche da solo ti consiglio o la ps3 o la xbox 360 invece se hai molti amici  potresti prendere la  wii   che è molto adatta per giocare in compagnia , se invece sei uno che viaggia molto ti consiglio la psp oppure nintendo ds <br>  Ciao!!|`|oGH6mifEaa	senza dubbio plastation 3...ci puoi fa tantissime cose e inoltre ha una grafica impeccabile....unico difetto è che pesa un po...
YOFnmkZ5aa	Non è facile rispondere a questa domanda, io lavoro in un'azienda che ripara gli lcd e ti posso dire che la "ricetta" è top-secret ma qualcosa si conosce;<br>  Sostanza organica (steroidi) particolarmente trattata con altre sostanze chimiche.<br>  So per certo che è dannosa per ingestione e anche per contatto cutaneo.<br>  Per quanto riguarda il plasma so solo il gas per il rosso; Neon.
