Unless I miss my guess, you don't check the oil when you fill up. I'm not picking on you, most people don't. Your engine is toast. It quit on the highway, and would start and then quit again.

The relay box is usually located under the hood, and in your case you need to look for the one that is with a fusebox.  The underside of the lid shows a schematic identifying which fuse or relay is for each particular circuit, and just remove and replace the offender.

Perhap you have a bad switch there or the headlight part of it. That is the best I can do without running some test. It not the mechanic that make the big bucks. It is the shop that has the service. It is the olny job I know that you will make the same no matter were you are in the country. You pay small part for the training and years to gain the skills. So they can fix you vehicle fast to save you money. <br>  You have a problem with your tail lights. If you would start change out parts in it. This could rum hundren or thousand of dollars. Play with the wrong wire could cost you $1500.00 if it set off an air bag. If you are to close to it. It could kill you on the spot. Today vehicle are not like the vehicle grow up with. <br>  Take it to a shop and get the cost in writing. Go to several shops. Do the same. There're specialilce shop that only do vehicle wireing. They will be your best place to go. Most shops have seem this problem. They do it every day. Some dealerships will send the vehicle out to these shop. It cost thousands of dollars per year to keep up books in wiring yearly.

zruhNGKbaa	Whatever you can Pay cash for. <br>  <br>  The best possible car for you to buy is one that you can pay cash for. Period. It is less expensive to maintain and repair a used vehicle than it is to make payments and pay interest on a new one.  <br>  <br>  And by all means never ever Fleece (Lease) any vehicle for personal use – the actual costs are far higher than that of financing and at the end of the lease you will have nothing – except the likely hood of a massive over mileage charge and excessive wear and damage charges.  <br>  <br>  Even worse than a fleece are the “Buy Here – Pay Here” lots which will give you a nice low weekly payment on a car they are selling for usually twice the fair market value at an interest rate that would make any loan shark smile, on a note that will enslave you for the next 5 years at least on a car which is almost guaranteed to die in 2 years or less! <br>  <br>  It is far more cost effective to purchase and maintain a used vehicle and save the difference for a newer and nicer vehicle a couple of years down the road.  An older vehicle will also save you money in the form of lower insurance costs too! <br>  <br>  Avoid the clutches of the predatory lenders – Buy Cash, Pay Cash.

RbsRpcIyaa	Yep, you're right... my first inclination was to throw out: "Get a job!"<br>  <br>  However, that aside, offer to sign a contract with these stipulations (or similar ones):<br>  <br>  1) You will work during the summer and turn over the funds to your parents toward insurance.<br>  2) Your grades will not drop one iota. No grades, no car.<br>  3) You will turn over the vehicle if you get any moving violations.<br>  4) You will volunteer on the weekends at a food bank or local shelter.<br>  <br>  Sound strict? Sure, it does. However, if you live up to this, you will earn more than the car. You'll always have their respect and the respect of your kids later on (what a story to tell them when they come asking for wheels... "Ya know, Junior, what I had to do in order to get my first car?"). <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|c22cd3bc80b769e97ac9ae2bc60d368eaa	Whine.  Pout.  Force them to send you to private school.

Yes, get a job and get it yourself.  Stop playing the martyr and telling us all the "scarifices" you've made by not going to a private school.  Your sibling rivalry is really the issue here.  <br>  <br>  You say that money is "rarely an issue:" which means that occasionally it is.  Have you watched the news or read a newspaper in the last year?  People are losing jobs and pensions they thought they would have their entire life.  People are seeing entire retirement funds vaporize.  Perhaps when mommy and daddy enrolled your siblings in that "pricey private school" this financial crisis wasn;t even a blip on the horizon.  But its in all of our faces every day.  <br>  <br>  So - be considerate.  recognize that if your parents are like any of the millions of us worried about our financial future, now is not the time to get pissy because you arent getting your new toy.  Show them that you will help out by getting a part time job, saving, and getting it yourself.
E0j6mhqhaa	Sounds to me that the fuel flow is restricted and the reason it runs for 5 minutes is because that's how long it takes to burn up the fuel in the float bowls.  Try breaking loose the float bowl drain screws, tighten them up, run the bike until it quits and immediately unscrew the drain screws.  You'll immediately know if the bowls are full of fuel or not.  If not, remove the fuel petcock from the tank and see if the screen is gummed up.  Something else to check is the petcock itself.  If it's a vacuum operated petcock, make sure the vacuum hose isn't leaking and that you have it attached to the vacuum nipple on the carb and not the vent nipple on the other carb.|`|1ca078fb6ac9d1741007da931ca6cd16aa	I too think that it's running the carb bowls dry, and I think the problem is in the petcock.

It has a strainer and it may be clogged.
F6YPGh9Raa	sounds to me like the cooling system which could be anything there, i'd start cheapest and work your way up........so first check to make sure your fan belt isn't broken then go with the hoses, check for water leaks, even a small drip, while there make sure your cooling fan comes on, this often goes out!......next i'd move to the radiator cap......an old radiator cap could be leaking pressure, also check/change your thermostat, if your water level is full, and the water is circulating while the engine is on, then your thermo is fine, if not then your radiator may be clogged, mineral deposits cause abrasion inside the unit, so it may have to be removed, taken in and flushed.....if you are actually getting hot air, maybe your heater/air conditioner pump/motor went out! check for any other water leakage under the carriage of the vehicle.......if that doesn't take care of the problem, then you now have pumps and gaskets to content with....check your tail pipe for dripping water and condensation, this could signal your head gasket being blown, or your head could even be warped, this and pumps i'd take to a reliable mechanic!<br>  good luck!?|`|54wgMlSFaa	thats where nissan failed.the AC coller is behind the radiator and thats why it blows hot.youre thermostat (nissan claims) is prone to failure.you should have it replaced once a year so you dont have these problems.and it also sounds like something major wrong with the rough idling.take it to a DEALER and have a diagnostic test ran on it.the should be under 75 bucks.it pays to have the test done at a dealer because they have a tool that tells them what is wrong in even the slightest way.|`|yzZchHHTaa	Sounds like the IAC is bad and causing it to rev to 3000 RPM.  Get to a garage and quick before you blow the motor.  Not a Jiffy Lube, a real garage.|`|cn0ALwwLaa	Ok, it sounds as though your car is overheating. That would be the most logical reason why it would go to the "H; at idle. That is your temperature gauge. If it has done that repeatedly, your Head Gasket -may- be blown. I know bewildering things happen.<br>  <br>  My car, a 95 Escort, did that after installing a new Distributor Coil. Possible Cause would be the spark plug wire being off Cylinder #3... it overheated, yeah, tried to start and run and it struggled for a minute once before giving out, because the wire stayed off Cylinder #3. My engine just got hot,no head gasket blown. Fixing Ignition timing (if the Fuel Filter doesnt do it) will solve my problem.<br>  <br>  Perhaps your Idle is going crazy because it is overheating. If it does not go back down, it is amiracle the car doesnt stal out due to overheated. And if that is an aluminum monobloc Engine (not sure, you have an early XTerra, not bad,) it may have suffered damage.<br>  <br>  I believe my Escort did like my Jetta and survuved an EXTREME overheat, one time, and was fine .Beautiful thing, just insanely chancey.<br>  <br>  Go get that checked out, you have a cooling problem at the least.|`|iJM4Zbhxaa	it could be a bad thermostat, or a problem with the cooling system, either way it warrants taking it to a good mechanic, personally i trust the dealership but some places like meineke or pep boys do great work, Estimated cost is hard to tell without actually taking a look but set aside a couple hundred bucks just in case. I would get it checked out soon the more you wait the more it may cost you in the end.|`|w5BjzqH1aa	If the needle is on the H then car is over heated. May be out of water in the system. I sound like you have avery sick car. Real to lay down on the side of the road. The water just don"t get out of the system for no reason. It could be a bad T-stat that control the temp of the water. A radialor cap. Or just not look and checking thing out. Running it on the H or any were in the red. Will damage the engine. Hopeful you have not run it that way long. It you have then you are looking at getting the head redone or replaced. That is big buck out of the pocket for that engine. Or you may hap to replace the engine. I would not drive it until it is properly checked out ny a mechanic. Check the water leveler before you drive it.|`|7f3559ac6e13d1f4904fbf38bd395141aa	Sounds like you are overheating the engine.  Take it in ASAP.  May be out of coolant.  Don't take it to jiffy lube though.  Not very reputable.
9SgD78JIaa	To cut through all the bull and mumbojumbo everyone is saying, the higher the octane, the less knocking and detonation.

By state law they have to state what detergents they have in their gas, IF they even have any.|`|TEJoVBnOaa	It depends on your car.  Some cars run better with a higher octane gas.

Now because the water pump is driven by the timing belt, it makes sense to replace it at the same time.  The belt will be around $60 and the pump is almost $90 from the dealer.  The labour is the shops door rate times the 3.6...

If the people who keep telling you multiple times without knowing your car's history, then they either have a personal agenda or just repeating what others have said to them.<br>  <br>  If you've had your timing belt replaced within the last 90,000 you should still be fine.  If you haven't had a timing belt replacement for over 100,000 miles, consider having it replaced.<br>  <br>  A new timing belt could cost you about $50 from your local auto parts store.  A new tensioner could cost you around $20.  So that would be about $130 for just the labor if the total cost starts at $199.<br>  <br>  Although I did the labor to replace my own timing belt for free, I would think $130 is still high...more like $50 - $100 would be reasonable.<br>  <br>  If you would like to read how a timing belt is replaced, you can learn here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.hondacivicrepairs.com/timing_belt.asp?q=Changing%20the%20Timing%20Belt%20-%20Honda%20Civic&id=26" rel="nofollow">http://www.hondacivicrepairs.com/timing_...</a><br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|BOYPkan9aa	hondas are kinda weird, if the timing belt breaks due to old age, your valves will hit your pistons, and then you will need a new engine.

Some people are really against them? Yes, maybe probably because they would like that luxury and can't afford it.<br>  Truth be told there are alot of companies that have private aircraft that are used exactly for the purpose they are intended.<br>  The company I fly for is a great example. We do 90% + business and 10%- pleasure. <br>  Each one of our 3 jets average 800 hours per year. If you put in the time lost and the headache from dealing with the airlines the airplanes are paid for already!<br>  Used in their proper manner they are tax deductible to an extent. But enough about that. <br>  Back to your original question:<br>  <br>  A business jet is no harder on the environment than large aircraft, they both have turbo jet engines and both burn Jet A. <br>  Military aircraft are on the same level, they burn Jet fuel too.<br>  Food for thought, anything that expells exhaust in the form of GAS, other than irons, steam engines, etc. is contributing to the bad air in the world.

A great deal of business travel involves trips that could be replaced by things like video- or teleconferences, or e-mail, or other means of interaction. And, of course, travel for pleasure is always voluntary and unnecessary, even though it might be pleasant.<br>  <br>  If people only traveled when they had to, most air travel today would vanish, and the environment would profit in consequence.  There's no reason to try to stop necessary air travel, as that's only a fraction of the total.<br>  <br>  Likewise for automobile, ship, and rail travel.|`|S4soZUFCaa	Private jets burn a shitload of fuel, and when you divide jetfuel/people, it amounts to like 200 times the amount to fly commercial.|`|L1cBV8qQaa	We'll Mr. Al Bore, I mean Al Gore owns a coupple, so I guess since Mr. Save the enviroment (and don't forget to elect me) has one, you can too.|`|82wXvW3baa	Well, they consume less fuel than big passenger jets and put out less exhaust.

No.<br>  <br>  Do they still get to the destination like everyone else? Yep.<br>  <br>  I've flown commercial, private, and military cargo.<br>  <br>  A plane is a plane. If it somehow strokes your ego to spend a shitload of money on a personal jet....that's fine. Don't cry to me when you spend all your money on fuel, and go bankrupt.<br>  <br>  I would also contend, that it makes very little sense for a lot of these business owners that their companies are going under...that they still think they need a business jet. I would think, that if they truly cared about their company and employees, they'd cut costs, including personal indulgences. <br>  <br>  But what do I know?

In a way, that gives the Mustang an edge in availability, because you can get it in 6 cylinder or 8. A Mustang GT 'might' have a tough race with a 350z, but IMO here the GT has an edge called torque. Check out the torque numbers and I think you'll find the GT is ahead.

rZuxtNl9aa	I think you just lose points, but I'm from New Hampshire, and we don't have to parallel park here. Good luck, I'm taking my test next Friday!|`|zruhNGKbaa	Driving Exam<br>  <br>  The basic handling portion of the test is inherently flawed - in real life no one cares if you go back and forth 3 times to get properly positioned in a parallel parking spot, and they do care if you jump the curb or hit another vehicle, in the parallel parking part of the test, simply back into the area defined by the cones and stop and beep - do not even try to position properly!  You will get one fault point for being out of the lines - but you will get one fault point for each time you maneuver beyond one backing move, one stop and one forward move and one stop.  NOT very realistic!  Most people who fail the test during the basic control portion fail by racking up points trying to actually get properly positioned! <br>  <br>  Many people who fail during the driving portion do so because they fail to come to a complete stop before any portion of the vehicle crosses: A) The painted Stop Line or Painted Crosswalk line. or<br>  B) An imaginary line crossing the road perpendicular to the Stop Sign.<br>  You must come to a complete and total stop within 5 feet before that point and look both directions before proceeding, if when stopped at the correct location you do not have a clear view in both directions of the intersecting road - and at MOST intersections this will be the case! - then after the complete stop, you may inch forward while continuing to scan in both directions until you CAN see clearly in both directions. If at any point you observe conflicting traffic on the crossing street you must stop again and wait for the traffic to clear, if when you reach the point where you can see clearly in both directions and there is no conflicting traffic you may then accelerate smoothly through the intersection or perform any specified turn as the instructor has previously directed. <br>  <br>  Make exaggerated turns of your head when you look each direction and when you check your mirrors before any turn or lane change so the examiner can tell that you are making the required visual checks. <br>  <br>  Keep your speed within 3 mph below to 1 mph above the posted speed limit unless conditions require a slower speed, the examiner wants to see that you can operate the car at the posted speeds and accelerate at reasonable rates and slow and brake in a smooth and reasonable manner. The best practice for this is to approach a stop sign at the legal speed and attempt to apply the brake at a moderate pressure which will bring the car to a stop within a few feet of the stop sign without noticeably varying the brake pedal pressure! It will take quite a bit of practice but it is a good driving technique to develop.  <br>    <br>  <br>  While not all examiners are exactly equal in their interpretation of exactly at what point you have committed a "violation" during the road driving part of the test,  each examiner is testing every candidate driver to the exact same state mandated procedure with the same number of  possible faults or errors permissible in the basic handling portion and in the road driving portion of the test.  <br>  <br>  You may find this difficult to believe but examiners really do not care if you pass or fail ( they get paid either way ) but they care passionately about safe driving and hold all candidates to the same high standard to assure that all licensed drivers do know how to drive safely! <br>  <br>  <br>  Drive Safely!
GgIjOhWeaa	As many that needs to make a left turn. I don't think there is a set limit seeing how there could be more then 50 people that needs to make a left turn at the same time. Your lights normally work well enough that makes it to like 10 vehicles at a time. Just remember to use your turn single if your outside the turn lane.|`|31Ttgqlbaa	As many as possible until the light turns red or the green arrow turns into a yellow arrow that disappears after a few seconds. Normally 2 cars can make it through on a yellow arrow, maybe 3.<br>  <br>  Cars are allowed to wait in the intersection if the light is green (without an arrow) and if the light turns red, cars that are already in the intersection have the right of way. This way more people would be able to make the left turn if more people waited in the intersection at a green light. <br>  <br>  Green arrows have a set number of seconds before turning into a yellow arrow. Each intersection is different, sometimes the green arrow last 5 seconds, sometimes it last 10 seconds. Normally it takes one second per car to turn, so if its a 10 second arrow 10 cars should be able to turn and when the light turns yellow, 2-3 more can turn for a total of 12-13 cars, but since some people are slow at turning, maybe around 11 cars would be more accurate.<br>  <br>  Also, some turning lanes have sensors that tricker a green arrow. So, if a car comes, a green arrow will show. If there are no cars in the turn lane, the traffic light will skip that cycle. If there's only a few cars in the turn lane, the green arrow won't last long; it may time out and turn yellow after 3 seconds of no car to turn. That's why if you're a distance away, the light always changes before you get to the intersection. If there's a line of cars to turn left, the green arrow will last a max of 10 or 15 seconds depending on the intersection.|`|HQrMEkm0aa	All cars are allowed to make left or right turns.|`|zruhNGKbaa	As many as can proceed safely through the intersection until the light turns Amber - at which point in time,  if you have not crossed the stop line with any part of your vehicle you must stop and wait for the next Left turn cycle.|`|AA12339318	Every car made for road use should be equipped to make a left turn.<br>  <br>  Every single one of them, no exceptions.

El equipamiento es el adecuado (Cristales seguros y espejos eléctricos). El espacio es razonable para este auto, te puedes ir de fin de semana con tus amigos y sus maletas sin problemas. No es tan económico como un Chevy o un Tsuru, pero da buen rendimiento (9-10 Km/l en ciudad y 15-17 Km/l en carretera). En 55000 Km el auto jamás me ha dejado tirado ni ha dado mayor lata que la normal (cambios de aceite, ajuste de frenos). Eso si, los servicios son ligeramente más caros que el promedio. Para el uso diario te lo recomiendo ampliamente. El ST es un auto extraordinario, acelera brutal (Claro, nada que ver con el RX-7 TT) y se maneja de forma sublime, es sencillo manejarlo, pero debes tener la conciencia de que traes un auto que en un instante va arriba de 150 km/h. Es cómodo para viajes cortos, pero los asientos cansan luego de un rato, también te sirve para un paseo de fin de semana y tiene un espacio adecuado para cuatro personas. El sonido es excelente y el equipamiento es completisimo (Equipo eléctrico, quemacocos, luces de xenon, etc). Podría recomendartelo de auto de diario pero la marcha es un poco dura y las llantas de 18" pueden sufrir con nuestros caminos, como auto capricho pues no es tan atractivo o personal como un Mustang o un MX-5 pero es más práctico.<br>  En lo personal te recomiendo que busques que necesitas en un auto, si lo vas a usar diario, si llevas a tu familia o amigos con frecuencia, si requieres que gaste poco combustible, al final esos requerimientos te haran escoger el auto que te acomode mejor. Ahora, muchas veces nos encaprichamos con un auto y tal vez valga la pena adaptar tus necesidades al auto con el que estas apasionado. En ambos casos siempre debes tener en cuenta cual es tu presupuesto y buscar algo acorde a ello.|`|10f58449cb7aa52a5ec6deb73c0d05d0aa	Actualmente tengo una camioneta Murano de Nissan, te la recomiendo, es totalmente automática y con los interiores muy cómodos, gasta poca gasolina en comparación a otras camionetas y es muy estable en carretera y manejarla en la ciudad te da la sensación de que vas volando porque no se siente. <br>  <br>  Extraordinaria!!

The car should be good for a 150K to 250K, A lot has to do with how it was cared for. I would want to know about the money and the car is to old (I think) to get a report on it and even most sources that give a value stop at 10 years and this car is 12 years old. Go to kelly Blue book and see what a 10 year old would sell for and check to see how much the reduce the price by  for mileage. also look and see what the difference is between a 9 year old car and a 10 year old car double that amount and subtract it from the price of a 10 year old car and it should give you a fair value for the car.<br>  <br>  <br>  Addendum :  This car has not just sat around as the first answer has said it has been driven about 8,000 a year and that is 2/3 the national average I have two 2008 vehicles and they do less in a year but they are treat like they were gold so was this one|`|c11fee07c98ac2e271f2ab5acd400781aa	Well I don't agree with the first person, a car that isn't driven a lot isn't the worst thing...I mean how could it? 30k in 10 months is a lot dude...but eh its a honda...those cars last.<br>  -------------<br>  <br>  Good question, but this is the place to learn those things.<br>  <br>  You know all those rubbery seals, gaskets, et al in a vehicle?<br>  <br>  Well, they don't get lubed up with a car that has been sitting around.  <br>  <br>  A car with a healthy work out is better.<br>  <br>  So know you know if you find some 1983 Chevy Corvette with 200 actual miles on it on Craigslist, you know better and will pass on it.<br>  <br>  (Yes, I know the story behind '83 Corvettes before anyone starts scratching their heads...)|`|dOSKS7zqaa	Well I don't agree with the first person, a car that isn't driven a lot isn't the worst thing...I mean how could it? 30k in 10 months is a lot dude...but eh its a honda...those cars last.|`|yjvv5bDjaa	excellent question!<br>  <br>  i'd be more concerned with the 88k person.

The Italian term, 'Gran Turismo Omologato', means Grand Touring class production vehicle, homologated for racing. The name came to mean a large, high-performance sports car comfortable enough for long trips or 'touring', as opposed to the smaller, less comfortable 2-seater 'true' sports car. Among the Stealth/GTO/3000GT family of cars, all of the DOHC models (both turbos and non-turbos) are in the racing class, 'GTO'. The SOHC models are in the class, 'GT'.|`|7a1a4586cbdfad0a780847164818434aaa	It's an abbreviation for the Italian phrase "gran turisimo omolagato", in English, Grand Touring Homologated.<br>  <br>  In the 60s factories were building just a few very special cars and racing them in Grand Touring classes.

Ferrari took a street car they made and souped it up for racing calling it the Ferrari GTO. They only made 39, but got away with it. Some were actually sold for street use. They cost about $25,000, a lot of money in those days but still a bargain. These days they go for millions of dollars when they are sold (rarely).<br>  <br>  Pontiac simply ripped off the name.

AA11891788	There are 2 programs that are widely used among mechanics. They are AllData and Mitchell on Demand. We use AllData but I have heard they are both very good. The "flat rate" info Is part of both programs. They list warranty rates and standard flat rates. Both also have websites that I think you can get a trial disc from. There is a monthly cost for both programs. AllData is around $180 a month and well worth it. I don't know how much Mitchell on Demand is.|`|17f43d581f03d5d74492a3ffd7b6a9ccaa	Yes there are actual books that will show flat rate but I'm not exactly sure what the books are called. There is an automotive program called ALL DATA that has a ton of information about almost every car. And it actually has the flat rate for repairs also. The Tech school I went to used ALL DATA and I found it very useful.

Si te pasas de esa presiòn el auto rebota mucho y puedes da?ar la suspensiòn. Siempre debes de revisar el correcto inflado ya que si esta poco inflada la parte media de las llantas no toca el suelo como debe de ser y si esta sobreinflada las partes laterales no tocan el suelo como debe de ser, lo que te provoca en ambos casos que el desgaste de la llanta se irregular y mas ràpido.|`|mldudgwtaa	En la informacion que viene en el costado de la llanta viene el limite de inflado maximo, de esa presion puedes inflar 10 lbs. menos|`|511de820aaed2c7c63f309bad2dc0740aa	30, yo tengo una mini van y mi esposo me dice q son 40, así q para un carro liviano son 30|`|09cbfa888611675511614be02874ad74aa	Depende del ring, y su capacidad de almacenamiento de aire(LA LLANTA)|`|2642d2334c203fe33d0deec1faa5ff48aa	Para ciudad le pondria unas 32 libras, para que no le cueste trabajo avanzar, y en carretera si voy a menejar mucho tiempo las calibraria a 26-28PSI, ya que con el calor del asfalto la presion en la llanta aumenta.<br>  <br>  Suerte!!!|`|YlnKpSIRaa	Normalmente son de 28 a 30.

The documentation fee covers the temporary plate, title application, etc. <br>  <br>  If you have sales tax in your state you will also have to pay for that when it comes time to go register it, or you can have the sales tax included in your monthly payment if you are financing and the dealership will just cut you a check for the amount.|`|AlvKbEHOaa	at my dealership (connecticut) it is $293.80 for a Dealer Doc. fee, 6% sales tax, and registration is about $180 if you are getting new plates.

Also don't forget your insurance will go up.  Good luck!
AA10262051	yes some states will report non payment of a ticket to your home state. so when you to get a new registration or anything they will tell you you have a ticket that needs to be paid, by then after fines ans so on could add a few hundred bucks. also depending on what the ticket is for and state laws if u get pulled over again in penn they can actually hold you till its cleared up.|`|f2dc7c47627cbc54589cf654e8ba7d03aa	pay it unless u will never go to PA ever again...they only contact maryland for a moving violation|`|a11750087e1ac57ed6db82820d0ded65aa	a ticket is a ticket it doesnt matter where your car is registered at

7fd28f52af7b66b97310920f8c346b80aa	Personalmente ho sempre avuto motori a benzina, perché se non si fanno almeno 20000 Km all'anno i diesel non convengono.  E poi il benzina lo puoi utilizzare tra i 1000 e i 7000 giri, i diesel moderni venno bene tra i 2000 e i 4000.  Sotto e sopra sono morti.  <br>  Spesso ho la sensazione che la grande diffusione del diesel sia dovuto a un malinteso "effetto pompa".  E' vero che il pieno costa di meno (e lo fai meno spesso), ma tra i costi di acquisto, di assicurazione ,e soprattutto di MANUTENZIONE (!!!!) i diesel moderni sono un debito che ammortizzi a fatica, puzzano comunque e sono fragilini.  E questo peggiorerà in modo pesante con l'arrivo dell'euro 5 e (peggio ancora) 6, limiti per i quali i benzina sono già abbastanza pronti.  I diesel non ce la fanno.|`|a46de5c97f3b5c77a906c4e807e985aaaa	il diesel lo preferisco perche in caso di incidente grave,è piu difficile che prenda fuoco.<br>  Anche la rottura de manicotti è meno pericolosa|`|2569e53a225da1b74b8f59c141a40a35aa	DIESEL si risparmia e fai più km|`|YsUoXZr2aa	diesel a vita!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|d80e8a7ee9a85bb305272aaa98a4f20daa	Diesel per una berlina di lusso o per auto grandi.<br>  Benzina per le auto tipo NIssan Silvia, Skyline, Eclipse e così via.|`|sLZou9I1aa	diesel perchè consuma meno|`|AiHlyR8raa	preferisco il metano inquina meno e puoi girare liberamente. ciao|`|GdpQ8axqaa	la benzina mi sta simpa|`|Kiq9itZ4aa	preferisco il diesel xke volendo corri anke cn quello e costa meno . .  perdi 1 po nello scatto però . .  nn si può avere tt dalla vita|`|LFSGjVQ4aa	Il Diesel perchè il motore dura molto più a lungo.|`|LdIYHd78aa	dipende dall' uso che serve.....<br>  BENZINA: l' auto costa meno(a parità di motore e cv) l' assicurazione costa circa il 15% in meno e i tagliandi anche se piu' frequenti del diesel costano meno.

This would not give sufficient power to the starter but it is taking all the power available to try to start and the alarm thinks that it has been disconnected while in the active phase and therefore goes into alarm mode.<br>  <br>  Does the clock, if fitted, reset also?|`|a58uXYrYaa	What you need to do is check the sounder solenoid attached to the main computer for the alarm systems.  This is usually underneath the dash.  If this is a factory installed alarm, then it will be 4 inches from the right of the steering column under the dash.  You'll see about 30 wires going to it, you are looking for the rainbow striped wire- this is the one that sends the signal to the starter to deactivate it.  Check to make sure that there's nothing wrong with that wire.  Once verified and/or fixed, you should be good to go.  If that doesn't work, then check the visual systems computer about 8 inches from the main alarm computer.  This is the one that scans the road while you are driving- this indirectly communicates with the sounder solenoid to promote healthy activity.  On the visual systems computer, there will be an RF (radio frequency) attachment via a thin black wire that connects the two.  Take a phillips head screwdriver, take that off and disconnect that black wire.  Open it up and check for any foreign predators and/or unusual activity.  You may need to get this replaced.  Once verified, hook it back up the opposite way (this reverses the polarity and promotes better communication).  You should be good to do now.|`|A33kTOkzaa	if it cranks over but doesn't fire, it would sound like the battery is dead / dying.  if the red light is the immobiliser, then get it checked out.  could be the battery in the key, could be more sinister

Have the cooling system examined (or check it yourself for leaks, proper fan and thermostat operation, etc) and then have it flushed and re-filled.<br>  <br>  Edit: "Down convert"? Now, I've heard it all...I just never really noticed that engineering feat in my  396 cu. in. / 375 HP '70 Chevelle (stock) that I bought while I was in the Navy in '74. Guess ya' learn something everyday.|`|a58uXYrYaa	You have too new of a car.  Get something from the 70's.  All of the cars built in the 70's down-convert the octane rating to 72.  So if you put 87 octane gasoline in your car, it will down-convert it to 72 octane.  This saves on gasoline, plus the car runs MUCH cooler since the molecular weight isn't as much as the 87-octane gas.|`|gI26Luvqaa	what level of fuel octane are you running?
