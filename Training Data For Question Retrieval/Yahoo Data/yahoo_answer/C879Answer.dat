I was able to buy a house with zero down in early 2006 - 5 yrs after my Chap 7 BK was discharged.    Definitely won;t be that easy anymore - no more Zero down mortgages - especially for people coming out of BK|`|8yQYmxVOaa	You will need downpayment closing costs, perfect credit after your BK and have to wait at least 3 years before even being considered. Look at it this way if you borrowed someone 100K and they stiffed you but a year later asked to do it again would you?|`|AWSmknxLaa	no problem as long as you have 100% cash.    You will not be able to get a loan for 6-8 years.|`|yh2hr3Vfaa	No. Chapter 13 will definately ruin your credit for 5-8 years so you won't be able to get a loan and the purpose of bankrupsy is to restructure debits and clean up your credit. Not shirk off your debits to buy a new home.|`|UeLigNB0aa	The guidelines for FHA loans allow you to obtain a mortgage after 12 months in a chapter 13 bk with the permission of the trustee. If the bk has been discharged you should be ok as long as you have re-established your credit and have a clean payment history since the bk.  You will also need to pass all of the other requirements/guidelines for an FHA loan.

ex7aYexuaa	Lucky you, Minnesota is one of the most tenant-friendly states in the U.S.  The best idea is to speak with your landlord and explain the situation. It's probably better, however, to emphasize your reason being the pregnancy, not so much the roommate you don't like (you chose to live with her and lots of people have roommates they don't like so your landlord probably doesn't want to hear about it.)  Say that it's important for you to be with the baby's father while you're pregnant.  Maybe the landlord even has another apartment he'd offer for you and the father.|`|FVFxE6owaa	It is not your landlord's fault that you do not get along with your roommate.  You can try to talk to your landlord, but really he or she is entitled to the rent money for the duration of the lease.  If your landlord does let you out early, expect some hefty fees.|`|Uu7BeMF2aa	I'm sorry to hear that.     There probably would not be "huge amounts of trouble", but I suggest that you explain the situation to your landlord.  You may be asked to continue paying rent for the remaining months or maybe he/she can work out a deal like lose the last month's deposit or something like that.    If you think that by bringing this to your landlord will cause your roommate to be even more aggressive and possibly be a threat to you and your baby, then look at the possibility of staying at friend's or family member - somewhere safe while you work this out, and if you need to go back for your stuff, don't go alone.|`|AA10045620	You either have to find someone over to move in until May or pay the balance of your rent until May.  If not, the landlord would take you to court, and you would not win.  You would be responsible for the rent, court costs and attorney fees.  This will also show up on all of your background checks.|`|Mm3vSHfNaa	The best way is if you can find someone else to take over the lease. Short of that, you might ask the landlord, if you explain the situation he might be willing to move the lease over to the roommate's name.    Good luck, and good luck with the baby!
Mm3vSHfNaa	Just fill in all zeros, and tell them in the notes that you would be happy to give it to them when you fill out the tax paperwork after they offer you a job and you accept, but not until then.
pOHVhVqgaa	A secure credit card or a small furniture account. We have a furniture place where I live that gives easy credit and low monthly payments that works great for credit as long as you make payments on time. And secure credit cards are a sure thing since you have to put money on it in order to use it. Its a long hard process but once you get good credit its worth it.|`|0yqQg9CXaa	Do you have a checking account in good standing for the past 6 months?  Ask them for a visa card - easiest to get this way.  Secured card at your bank is another option.  But keep trying - store cards, gas cards.  Pay in full each month for 800+ scores.  /

DshFTbcsaa	depends on how many computers you want to buy. I'm guessing it would be pricey though. Gamming computers are not cheap and you'll need a lot of them, plus a place to rent, plus you'll need to buy every piece of software a ton of times for each computer. There would be a high start up cost for sure|`|ragIbMXYaa	I guess you would need quite a lot    as    new consoles, games and technology are always coming out.

NExIpyWRaa	These banks you name are doing EXACTLY as they were chartered to do under the Federal Reserve Act of 1913. I strongly suggest you read or listen to The Creature From Jekyll Island and learn about the banking cartel and why these bailouts are happeing. As for closing your account, I wouldnt do that but you must be aware that once you put money in a bank it no longer belongs to you, it belongs to the bank for them to do with as they please. FDR said it best. "t is possible that when the banks resume a very few people who have not recovered from their fear may again begin withdrawals. Let me make it clear to you that the banks will take care of all needs except of course the hysterical demands of hoarders.....Remember that the essential accomplishment of the new legislation is that it makes it possible for banks more readily to convert their assets into cash than was the case before. More liberal provision has been made for banks to borrow on these assets at the reserve banks and more liberal provision has also been made for issuing currency on the security of these good assets. This currency is not fiat currency. It is issued only on adequate security, and every good bank has an abundance of such security.....We had a bad banking situation. Some of our bankers had shown themselves either incompetent or dishonest in their handling of the peoples funds. They had used the money entrusted to them in speculations and unwise loans.....I do not promise you that every bank will be reopened or that individual losses will not be suffered."    30 Days later of course 41% of everyones savings was conficated by FDR. I strongly suggest you listen to the first Fireside Chat by FDR and listen carefully. I dont keep money in banks especially since they are paying no interest.|`|49740c9daeea677fc86801fb2b3f41deaa	Blame congress for this mess, they are the ones screwing us all over.|`|DiFtgsZEaa	How sad.

jX2nJsalaa	redit repair workd fine to fix my credit. They disputed and removed lots of bad items from my credit report. I used this service - freecreditreport.sinfree.net|`|2N6oTOLQaa	If you have NO credit history, then these items have not been reported on your credit report. You should start building credit with a low-limit credit card. If you have to, you can get a secured credit card first, just make sure you switch to a regular card as soon as you can.     If these items are actually on your credit report, then all you can do is pay them. This won't remove them but paying a past due bill is better than letting it go unpaid (in terms of credit rating). As time goes on these items will have less and less impact on your credit. They drop off completely 7 years after the last date of activity on the account.|`|g9qiRBviaa	Well, assuming you do have a credit history (since you expressed confusion that you're being told you don't), first you need to get a copy of your credit report (you can get one free each 12 months from the three major reporting companies) and find any errors at all. Call the companies they pertain to and request that the errors get fixed.     Follow up with a letter reiterating your request. If they don't get on the stick, call them back once a week to get a status. You NEED to get whatever issues you have there cleared up (you say you're showing "no credit history"--that's got to be wrong).    Next, get on payment plans with your debtors. Call them. Suggest how much you can send. Whatever you do, DO NOT send in a larger amount "initially" because many collection agencies and even just your debtors may decide that's your regular monthly payment, and refuse to negotiate further with you on it.    Good luck!|`|AA10698792	Work on paying off your bills with cash and then get a pre-paid credit card.  Just about anyone can get one because you have to put the money on the card up front and you can't spend more than is on the card, but it differs from a debit card in that there is still interest accrued on balances and transactions and payments on it count toward your credit history.    You can find information on pre-paid cards here: http://www.credit.com/products/credit_ca...    or check to see if your bank offers them.
KKCaLGOEaa	FYI I was trying to answer your question before but an error would prevent me.  Maybe that's why I'm the only one here.    So since I got in, here's my answer:    Well this is a lovely surprise, I happen to be an INFP/INFJ who is just starting to think of going into Human Resources. There's a lot of different positions HR, where you may be in charge of hiring, job training, company finances, or even take a managerial role. There's a lot of options within HR because it's an ever-changing field, and it may be different in times like these when people aren't hiring.    For me as a fellow INFP I am thinking of going into more hiring people for the right job and maintaining positive relationships in the workforce type of job. I like reading about personality types and taking all kinds of those tests on the net when I'm absolutely bored out of my mind, so I thought maybe I could figure out where other people fit for a living and help them out. But no managerial stuff for me. I'm also shy and I'm also quite selective like they say an INFP/INFJ is, but despite that I get along with everybody and everybody kind of likes me (or at least I think so). Being an INFP or an ESTJ isn't all that is to us, so if that's what we want to do then we should do it. We shouldn't plan our life around a theory of who we might be. Or at least that's how I see things.    Best of luck!
Qqz0H2hEaa	If it was not in your name at all then letting it go to foreclosure would not hurt your credit.  There is always a chance that someone else will out bid you and you would not get your dad's home.  If this was a reverse mortgage or another mortgage without recourse then the unpaid balance would not be held against your dad's estate.  Otherwise any shortfall in payoff at foreclosure would be owed by your dad's estate (if any).    I don't think the bank would try and prevent you from buying it unless your name was the same as his and they got confused.|`|AA11206283	uh...problem is you can't foreclose a dead man.    have to work thru the intestate estate, property will probably have to be sold to satisfy the mortgage, and anyone who wants to bid on it can.|`|kPWGVeWhaa	maybe.    but the bank may want to "short sell" it.|`|yHl7RIuOaa	Well there is certainly no guarantee you will be the buyer. Is that a big deal?    Also is there any money or other assets in estate?  If so it may be used to pay off debt. Dieing does not get you out of loan obligations.    If he was essentially bankrupt then yeah let it go to foreclosure. But again you may not be the buyer.  Home will be listed for sale on mls and anyone may put in an offer.
49740c9daeea677fc86801fb2b3f41deaa	If you are selling to the students ice cream (like the ice cream guy sells from a van) always go over well.    If you are selling to adults you need to look at what you can get cheap.   For instance, my daughters school has access to a grower that supplies trees to farmers.   They get the trees very cheap and can sell them for far less then retail, so they end up selling several hundred because the deal is really good.|`|REC4YgOuaa	condoms|`|bLsWEpDFaa	candy!

Maybe you could sell fruits like apples, which you sold somewhere nearby from a farmer?   You could also "create" a special sandwich and sell it - if you even have a special sauce on this sandwich it would be your creation.
X8iNQRnYaa	Ask lenders for agreement to delete this items from your credit report when paying them. I recommend to get such agreement thru credit repair agency, for example this one - creditreport.imess.net|`|LzPhdri5aa	They've changed the formula.    I recommend picking one card, funneling some expenses through it and paying it off at the end of each month.|`|8yQYmxVOaa	If you did not get a pay to delete contract in writing they will remain on your report from the date of the last transaction to late to change that if you did not get those agreements in writing|`|Mm3vSHfNaa	You can contact the three credit bureaus and notify them, but it probably won't make much difference because they only thing they really use is the reports from the credit card companies.     Your score will just start magically going up, you'll love it, and you don't have to do a thing.    If the cards do not have an annual fee, you should keep them open because it will help your score that you have credit available and unused. They love it when you have credit and don't use it.    Way to go on paying them off!!!|`|blzFIxcUaa	You shouldn't have cleared the balances.    It looks better for credit if you can prove that you are reliable and make your payments on time every month.
pOHVhVqgaa	Well I would suggest disputing them with the credit bureaus and sometimes it works and they will remove it but then sometimes you get the butts and they wont remove anything until the 7 years even if you paid it, but try because some companies may have changed their policies since the debt and maybe they don't report anymore, they may even not respond to the credit bureau within the 30 days they are given and then they have to take it off anyway, there is ways to do it just keep at it and keep disputing them. If you have anymore questions on how then e-mail or message me, I dusputed all mine and got it cleaned up without having to pay anyone hundreds of dollars and I got my first house 3 months ago!|`|cLtzGveRaa	Yes, you will have to wait for it to fall off... but make sure it falls off when it is supposed to... ie: 7 years after delinquincy, not 7 years from today.    However, you can start the repair process now.  Get a secured credit card, never charge more than 10 to 20 percent of the available credit, and pay it off every month.    Take out a small installment loan, using the funds as security - lock them into a savings investment of some sort - say $1000 should do it.  Make the payments over two years.|`|X8iNQRnYaa	Ask lenders for agreement to delete this items from your credit report when paying them. I recommend to get such agreement thru credit repair agency, for example this one - creditreport.imess.net|`|ek8gDEaMaa	It is a difficult process that may best be left to the professionals.  Simple credit repair could clear many of these and an authorized user tradeline program would give you atleast 1 positive item on your bureau.  Both of these would help boost your score.

If you will be driving their car, their insurance will go up. Even if you get your own car their rate will probably go up. Typically, the driver with the worst or shortest driving record will be paired with the car most expensive to insure within their household. If you drive a Volvo but your dad drives a Ferrari, you will be attached to the ferrari even if you never drive it. As far as the license/permit debate goes, as soon as you start driving you need to be insured. It's at that point your parents rate would change.|`|pposouLYaa	You can compare how the insurance quotes would change, for example here - autoinsurance.undonet.com|`|wp1W4G4Saa	not if u get ur permit...if u have license and will be driving ur parents car then yes.
QVDJSHzjaa	Everyone always thinks like this:    If only I made a little more money, then I'd be happier.  If only I made a little more money, then I could save some.    Sorry, I don't buy it.  I've been bankrupt and I've had some money in savings during my lifetime.  Happiness and comfort are relative.    If you want to live comfortably, watch your spending instead of your income.  Pay yourself first... put something (anything really) into a savings account for rainy days.  Also put something (as much as you can) into a retirement vehicle (401k with your employer, IRA, etc.).    You want happiness, spend a little less.  Do you really need something so much that you must borrow money (credit cards) to have it?  Take an attitude that credit cards are evil.  You will end up happier my friend.|`|AA11064536	There are too many factors that go into that calculation.    Basically, what lifestyle do you want to live?  You are the only one that can answer that question.    Is it just you or are you married?  Significant other?  Children?    Do you want to own a place to live or rent?  How big?  How luxurious?  North or south?  Near a big city or way far away?    Do you like eating bean and rice or steak every so often?      Are you prepared to deal with inflation?  Food, clothing, gas, heating bills etc will all rise.    There will also be insurance bills, car, homeowners, health insurance, etc.    There will also be taxes (income, sales taxes etc.) and other fees like car titles etc.    Sit down with a big notebook and make a list of the things that you buy and what they cost.  Make out a budget and then look for places to live where you can stay within that budget.    Good Luck|`|EjhE3mOSaa	They've done research on this topic before.   I heard if you live in cities or suburbs you need around 80,000 per person to live comfortably. (Thats after tax).  If you live around like Kansas you can pull it off with less than 20,000 per person.

5SgBAgwVaa	Wow, I love the answers to this one!  First, money-laundering is highly illegal.  If you/your parents get caught, it's back to the old country or rotting in jail in this one.      It really depends on the amount of cash they've stashed.  I personally would go see a really slick tax attorney and ask his advice. DO NOT try to open up accounts all over the city.  This is called "structuring" and banks are hip to this.  Does the name Eliot Spitzer ring a bell?  Also, don't bet that if you are under $9500 you will be safe.  Any pattern of deposits will raise a red flag.    So if you really want to be legal, see the lawyer, pay the IRS and go on your merry way.|`|0yqQg9CXaa	A bank has to report any money transfers over 10K to the goverment.  You could try to set up different checking accounts all over your city with 9,500 balances in them.

Zuj3urrYaa	I feel you completely! My mother has taken hundreds of dollars from me over the years and wont admit to it or pay me back. When I was 8, she went into my piggy bank and took the $200 I had gotten from all my family members for my birthday. When I found out, and told her about it, she twisted it around to say that I took the money from her drawer and that as punishment, she spent it on shoes for HERSELF. I did no such thing. <br>  But anyway, the only thing you can really do is hide the money really well. Have one of your adult relatives go with you to the bank and open a savings account and make deposits without her knowing. I had to do that. Give the cash to a relative and have THEM make the deposit for you without telling your mom. And/or lie about what you have if/ when she asks. I live by myself now but I still have to do that because my mom is nosy and the biggest mooch you will ever meet. Lies and deception are really the only way to hide something from her. She is your mother and your business is her business too so I suggest doing everything you can to keep her out of it.<br>  Oh and btw, if she ever asks to borrow money- say you dont have any. The hundreds of dollars my mom owes me is from mostly borrowed money she has no intention of ever paying back. If I remind her about it, she says I have an attitude and am micromanaging her and as a result of my inquisitiveness- I wont get my money back. Or she tells me that she never borrowed the money in the first place and Im just trying to be an extortionist. choose your words carefully|`|RsdAevQUaa	well she is part of your family and family's need to help each other. i agree if she did take it she should pay you back full price but you still have a lot of time to earn money. hide your money somewhere no one can find it so only you know where it is. that way there is less of a chance someone could take some from it. hope this helps!|`|s7SFytmvaa	put your money in a safer place and you won't have to deal with a theif, if that's what you want us to say.|`|pcGgavNtaa	Sounds like your mom is tight for cash.  Maybe you could offer to help her with it.  If you do not trust your mother ask your grandad to take you to the bank and open an account.  Dont keep much $$ in the house.  Hide it best you can.  Take to bank quick.  <br>  Don't sue your mom.
yJ3GpnXAaa	I've just searched for  'Britannia FirstSaver' and the results suggest that it's a children's saving account.    If that's so, then sorry, you're too young to open a PayPal account - you have to be at least 18 (the same goes for eBay, as well).    No, this doesn't answer you question in the way you hope, but you have to be of an age to accept legal responsibility to use both PayPal and eBay.

AA10796264	Like the other users said, you could get a secured credit card; however, you really want to stay away from credit cards period!  They are bad news; if you ever have hard times, they will pursue you relentlessly and even sue you if you can't pay.  Like someone else said, get a debit card with a VISA/Mastercard logo.  There's no need to even have a credit card if you do this.  I will never have another credit card after all I've been through with the different companies.  By the way, Capital One is the worst.  They'll give you a card easily enough, but if you ever get behind, they will not work with you and won't settle out for a lesser amount to close the account.  They also like to sue.  This is how they pay for their expensive TV commercials.  This is just my experience with them.  Keep your life less complicated and just stay away from credit cards altogether.|`|0oRxclohaa	Absolute best way is with secured cards!  Usually once you get approved for one, as long as you don't go crazy with it, within a few months you'll be able to get unsecured cards, although for your first 1 or 2 there will probably be an annual fee.  If you are a student, look into student cards, which usually don't have annual fees, and you don't have to secure them, but they have a little higher interest rates.  <br>  <br>  If you want to find the best way to start, Google "credit cards" and you'll find a couple of sights that will help you find the best card for you to get started with.  Be patient, give it time, you'll get there.|`|pcGgavNtaa	Those doctor bills will be hurting your credit for about 7 years. How much are they? If they are just a thousand or so you might try to make arrangements to get them paid off. When paid off ask the hospital/doctor to write letter to the credit bureaus stating that you paid them off. Get copy of letter for your records. <br>  Paying hose note on time will help your credit score. <br>  Try to change spending habits and cut your budget by $200 a month. Put that $200 in saving account. As you build up that account you can get a prepaid credit card. Say for $500 limit. As you charge things you pay it off. The bank knows they have the cash in case you do not pay.  It will help build up your score.  Keep saving the $200 a month, it is a good way to build up an emergency fund. Having a house there is always an emergency that needs to be fixed. <br>  Use credit only when you have to.  Pay cash when you can. Do not have the "I have to have this now" attitude. Save for things.|`|i1OvDcegaa	there are a couple of ways you could start building credit, you could get a small personal loan which you might need a cosigner or the best way will be getting a credit cards, you could get a credit card and use it for your every day expenses but make sure you pay in full at the end of the month that way it will show pay in full everytime the credit card company reports to the credit beuros. At the begining you will only be approved for the lower end credit cards but once you build credit in about 6-9 months you should be able to apply for a better card with better benefits such as free miles or cash back. Check out www.fastcardapprovals.com or fastcreditcardapprovals.com and go under bad credit section and you will find a few choices. Unless you are a student then apply for a student credit card this cards have no annual fee and lower rates. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.fastcardapprovals.com/Bad-Cre..." rel="nofollow">http://www.fastcardapprovals.com/Bad-Cre...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://fastcreditcardapprovals.com/" rel="nofollow">http://fastcreditcardapprovals.com/</a>|`|AA10795096	you can get a high interest rate credit card and probably have to pay a fee an annual fee ($29-$59 usually) it will probably have a lower balance.  Do that to establish a good credit history. check with capitol one.     Not sure about the medical bills.  good luck!|`|7fd132c8e19f30fb871f59749b631970aa	You may have to do a secured loan or get a secured credit card.  I did mine through my credit union.  I have also read that department store cards and gas cards are a good way to build credit.  You may get a low credit limit, but over time you'll receive increases.|`|fHTvjaYtaa	You can get a secured card....you send them $300 or so...they keep your money in an account...you charge and pay your bill on time.  Good luck on the doctor bills.  You might try to send them small payments and see if that keeps them off your back.|`|SK2gGFoyaa	You can't get "rid" of things on your credit report unless they are mistakes so look closely at them. Try applying for an easy credit card like Orchard, Capital One or HSBC. To be honest you don't need a credit card... get a debit card with visa/mc logo or a secured card. Why do you have the need to pay interest and annual fees??? If you have a home, you don't need to go further in debt. Most people build credit for homes and cars not for credit cards. You're in a good spot paying cash for what you want. Why blow it???
pcGgavNtaa	Are you saying you want to go to your bank that has your credit card and offer them say $800 for the $1,000 you owe them?  I don't think they will do that. <br>  It will hurt your credit.  This is the problem with the world today. Let me get all I can and the tell the bank/mortgage co that I can pay that and try to pay less or walk away from it. If you borrow money pay it back.<br>  Now that is the key part. Borrow as little money as possible. Don't charge things. It will only get you in trouble. Live on 80% of what you make. Save 10% and give 10% to your church or charity.  Pay cash when you can. Pay off debts early. <br>  What type of character do you have? Would you want someone to borrow $1,000 from you and just give you back $800?  <br>  Do the right thing.
pcGgavNtaa	Are you just making the minimum payment on the loan?  When I got out of college I had a student loan.  Each month I would pay an additional amount.  In the memo section of check I would write $50 towards principal only.   Also on the payment slips there should be a place to put the extra payments.  Remember the extra payment pays in two ways.  It cuts down the principal owed next month but will also increase the amount that the regular payment pays down the debt next month. Each month that amount will grow thereby paying the loan off faster. <br>  Keep making the payments on time and the extra as this builds good credit scores.|`|VXJq3nHNaa	ARE YOU LOOKING FOR A LEGITIMATE ONLINE LOAN FIRM....<br>   <br>  <br>    THEN WE ARE THE SOLUTION TO YOUR CAUSE..<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  CHARLES LUGGARD MACRO FINANCE INT PLC, a specialist in the offering of loans in British pounds sterling, us dollars, Japanese yen, Singapore Dollar, India Rupee, Euro, South Africa Rand ETC..<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  WE OFFERS LOANS TO ALL ELIGIBLE BORROWER AT THEIR LOCAL COUNTRY CURRENCIES..<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  WHEN IT COMES TO GENUINE ONLINE LOAN FIRM, THEN CHARLES LUGGARD MACRO FINANCE PLC, IS THE ANSWER TO YOUR PROBLEMS...<br>  <br>  CONTACT US on charlesluggardmacrofinance@gmail.com NOW AND SEE A DIFFERENCE....<br>  <br>  <br>  YOUR SINCERELY<br>  SIR CHARLES LUGGARD<br>            C.E.O<br>  CHARLES LUGGARD MACRO FINANCE INT PLC

SI02JOQ4aa	That sounds high to be honest - especially for Ealing.<br>  <br>  I think you should aim for 35% to 40% unless there are exceptional circumstances.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|49d798aae69c40cbf0926ebc21291224aa	Well, 50% spent on rent and bills is not that much to a Londoner.<br>  <br>  My take-home pay is ￡1,640 per month.  My rent includes all bills (the only additional I pay is for my mobile) and this is ￡700 per month (in a share house).<br>  <br>  So, it's not unusual to those of us who don't earn much.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, you seem to have a relatively high salary so you shouldn't need to spend such a high percentage on rent.  It depends on your situation - I mean, if you have a family then obviously you need a bigger property which will cost more.  But if you're single then you can definitely find somewhere cheaper.<br>  <br>  Also, are you including transportation costs into your calculations?  I live very centrally so have minimal transport costs, which is why I don't mind paying so much rent.  But Ealing is in Zone 3 so if you're working in the centre of London, then you're going to spend a lot on travel.  Plus there is the inconvenience of spending a lot of time travelling.  To be honest, I wouldn't pay that amount to live in Ealing - but I would pay it to live in somewhere like the nicer parts of SE1.
U7nj9Kg4aa	If it's $2,000 that you still owe her, just pay that and nothing more.<br>  <br>  Her bankruptcy is not your problem.<br>  <br>  And personally, I wouldn't put yourself in an over tough position to pay it back either.  You need to make sure that you can eat too.  Pay her back as much as you possibly can to help her out, but don't put your self in debt or turmoil over this.|`|UDxL7lPqaa	If you owe her $2000, you should pay her $2000.  Her bankruptcy doesn't change that.|`|Pjm9pg7iaa	You are not legally responsible for anything. I think your Aunt will understand your difficult position..|`|9tmqL7DSaa	You owe her the remaining balance left owed on what she purchased for you plus interest.<br>  <br>  I see no  reason to ever have a credit card, it's just a method banks use to charge a higher interest rate than they can on a conventional loan.  Do you realize that 21 per cent means 21 cents added to every dollar?  That's ridiculous.  It's like going to a gas station and saying, I don't think 3.75 is enough to pay for gas, I'm going to pay them 21 more cents or 2.10 added to every 10 dollar purchase.<br>  <br>  That's what happened to your credit and now hers.  If you don't have the cash for it right now, you don't need it.  If you really want it, save up for it.  It sounds too simple but it works.|`|pcGgavNtaa	Well one way you could do it is to look at all the things she is putting down under the bankruptcy and see the total value. Whatever your portion of that total value is the percentage you could give her for her total legal bill. <br>  But in reality apparently she was not paying down your furniture with the cash you were giving her. If she was she would not have to put that credit card as part of the bankruptcy.  <br>  I would not give her more than $100 total.  <br>  Work on getting your credit restored. |`|Bbu1KbPNaa	Really the right thing to do would have been to ask her to keep that debt out of bankruptcy and continue to make the payments.   That's possible -  My Dad declared bankruptcy because of a lawsuit judgment and he paid every other thing he owed except that judgment (which was later overturned on appeal).<br>  <br>  That also would have helped HER by showing future credit givers that she paid back something.  Morally you should still pay Wells Fargo.  Your aunt didn't lend you any money, Wells Fargo did.  She isn't owed a dime, Wells Fargo is!  If she's going to be using the money to pay back the insurance company, then pay her.  Otherwise, no.<br>  <br>  That said, if you want to help your aunt out because she's helped you out in the past, that's up to you.  But you didn't cause her bankruptcy, she did.   If you were paying all along then you were helping her credit, not causing her bankruptcy.<br>  <br>  If she were to sue you she would lose.  No doubt about it.  If you'd like her to see some money call Judge Judy, People's Court or one of those.  They pay an appearance fee, which you could give her if you want, as she  wouldn't be awarded a penny (based on what you told us here).<br>  <br>  And don't worry about your couches being repossessed - if your aunt's bankruptcy went through those debts are discharged.  They can't come after them.<br>  <br>  <br>  But you don't owe her any money.<br>  <br>  Of course I am not a lawyer, so please don't consider this legal advice.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|VhYrR9Ekaa	My guess is, they're going to repo that furniture, unless you can get that balance paid off first.

1cFUXQuRaa	Agree. the main reason is mainly cash flow related or profit related. The company do not have enough cash flow to actually stock the items. Reason probably because the items is not FAST MOVING or the manufacturer doesn't provide them with incentives to stock the items (some manufacturer provide wide discount on high volume purchases to their retailers).<br>  <br>  Cheers...|`|SI02JOQ4aa	For example - A small manufacturing company may keep a low stock of component parts to improve cash flow, because they would not have money tied-up in the stockroom waiting for customer orders to be placed. They would order the components required and use them right away to fullfil the order.
pcGgavNtaa	Look at any way that you could cut extra $$ from your budget.  Does everyone have cell phones?  Eliminate the house phone. Do you eat out?  Cook at home. Buying clothes, cigarettes, alcohol, etc. All of these things are extras/wasteful spending. <br>  Really look at things differently. I know you are 15 and want everything now, but you need to wait till things get better and you can contribute. As soon as you can try to get a part-time job. Keep some money for yourself, but use some of the money to buy things that are "needed" around the house. Food, milk, cleaning supplies, pay for the light bill one month, etc.  It will teach your responsibility, how hard it is to earn money, and how not to be wasteful.<br>  I am impressed that at 15 you want to help. Give mom big hugs and tell her how proud you are of her. That will be big too. |`|4Rr1NPxmaa	I worked at a nursing home as a CNA for 3 years and made more than anyone in my class.

It can be a difficult job for some people, but you seem like a caring kid, so I don't think you'd have many issues with it.  Some places you have to be 16 to work as a CNA, but it's worth looking into and it builds good character. If that's not for you, you can always pray. It can't hurt.|`|422baec93c2e09175c8e2ab1b0c51d3baa	Well,<br>  you could baby sit, shovel snow to make money<br>  do extra chores around the house to help out and make it a less stressful environment<br>  <br>  you could get a part time job on the weekends or after school sacking groceries or something like that. maybe give your parent's the money or some of the money (you should save a little for yourself atleast!)<br>  <br>  maybe let them know you dont need a whole lot for christmas this year and that you understand they are having a hard time.<br>  <br>  clip coupons<br>  sell any items around the house you no longer need or want... my husband and i made almost $3000 this year selling our dvd collection on ebay.|`|b6af7ede8594d3d67b95189dc22ea850aa	If at all possible, stop using credit cards all together and make a plan to start paying them down - minimum at least plus any other amount you can apply.  If you could get a part time job it sounds like it would be appreciated by your mom.<br>  Learning to live on less for a while is not easy, but it makes you worry lots less.

SI02JOQ4aa	Yes, but you may need to have some previous policy nimbers as back-up info.<br>  <br>  You can always say you were driving on a friends policy during the gaps.<br>  <br>  The bare facts are that you have not made a claim in x number of years, so you are entitled to the relevant bonus.
pcGgavNtaa	Were you on his policy before you got your policy?  Is either one listed as the primary insurance?  Example - Your policy is your primary insurance and his policy is your secondary and visa versa for him. Your policy would pay first for your and then his.  His policy would pay first for him and then yours if you have him listed.  <br>  If either of you do not have the other listed then only the policy in which you are listed as a policy holder will pay. <br>  Hope that makes sense. |`|AA11536773	It often goes by what they call the Birthday Rule. Whomever's birthday falls first in the year - regardless of who is older - holds the primary insurance. <br>  <br>  If your birthday is July and your husband is April, he'd have the primary plan and yours would be secondary. <br>  <br>  To be absolutely sure - contact both insurance plans and ask them if Coordination of Benefits (called C.O.B for short goes) by the Birthday Rule. <br>  <br>  Also - once you determine primary and secondary payors, make sure each plan knows their place. Otherwise, you'll have hassles whenever you seek medical care because each plan will point to the other and say "that one is responsible", leaving YOU with the headaches of sorting it out - if the providers don't have you pay the bill first. |`|ca0384d2a0191ea24cc9147b0bac4833aa	It is called Coordination of Benefits and you can look up your specific state rules.<br>  <br>  In general, the one making the claim will use their insurance coverage first before using the other spouse's coverage.<br>  <br>  |`|AA12148901	Based on the Department of insurance, you will always be primary on your own policy and secondary on one that you are a dependent under as long as your policy is through active employment.  If you retire or on cobra, and your spouse is still working his/her insurance would be primary.  <br>  If you have children on both plans, most policies go by the birthday rule, the birthday falling first in the year by month and day.  If you happen to have the same birthday it is gender rule and male pays first (some plans use gender instead of birthday but very rare).<br>  <br>  One thing you that may stick out is if one of the plans is 'non duplicating' this means that if they are secondary and the primary paid the same or more than what they would have the secondary won't pay anything.  Again this is rare, but is more likely than the gender rule. <br>  Example of this:<br>  Plan A pays 90% of allowed amount Plan B pays 80% of allowed amount, so plan B would not pay anything as their payment would not be more than the primary.<br>  If they don't have this written into the contract it would pay like so:<br>  Plan A pays 90% of allowed amount and Plan B will pay what the primary states is your responsibility (given all deductibles are met and there is no copay on the secondary).

My advice would be to first get your own and deduct it from your next month's rent. Provide the owner with a COPY of your receipt along with a CERTIFIED letter explaining you took the initiative to provide your own alarms since it was a safety hazard and violation of the Chicago Landlord Tenant Ordinance. Make sure you didn't sign a move-in checklist saying the apartment included a smoke & carbon monoxide detector. IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU NOTIFY THE LANDLORD IN WRITING!!!!!! PROVIDE A COPY OF THE RECEIPT AND YOU WILL BE GOOD TO GO. Menards have smoke detectors on sale pack of 2 for $15 and a carbon monoxide detector will be roughly $30-45. |`|pcGgavNtaa	While you are deciding what to do you are running the risk of dying in a fire. Go buy a couple of them from Wal-Mart or Home Depot or Menard's.  Might cost you about $45 for 3.  Buy batteries for them and put them in.  It is well worth it. How much is your life worth.  Don't think for one second that you would wake up from all the smoke. You won't.  You will die from carbon monoxide poisoning before that. |`|Tyq8OYm1aa	Contact the city building dept. to determine if current codes require them.  if so, ask the landlord (in writing) to install them.

fB12eqsWaa	Previous answer, nice try, but…. Oh dear<br>  <br>  Burning down your house because you can’t afford the repayments, how will that help?<br>  Even assuming you can get away with it (which is unlikely, fire services are very adept at spotting arson), the purchase price of a house (especially in the UK where NU operates) is nearly all about the land, not the building which is what is insured (land doesn’t burn).<br>  As a (real life) example say a house in London worth ￡400k burns down, the insurance will only pay out the rebuilding cost of around ￡100k, not ￡400k and anyway if you borrowed ￡300k to buy it… you still owe ￡300k burning it down won’t get you out of the debt <br>  <br>  It’s not like dumping your car in the docks, claiming it was stolen and collecting the insurance to pay off your car loan!  Anyway if people are that desperate they are more likely just to let the mortgage company repossess the house than burn it down!<br>  <br>  Committing suicide because of debt?  Unfortunately this does happen, whether in a credit crunch or not, but the sad truth is most people stop paying the premiums (because they have no money) before they get to that stage… no premium… no claim. I know that sounds heartless, and trust me I’m really not, but that is the fact of the matter.<br>  <br>  Anyway to be quite honest, compared to a major hurricane, earthquake or terrorist attack, claims like those add up to peanuts.<br>  <br>  Anyway to answer your question, Will the current crisis hurt insurers… yes and no.<br>  <br>  In the short term, they may lose on<br>  <br>  - Investment income:  AVIVA (of which NU is a part) made ￡10bn in investment income last year, about 25% of its gross income. If the economy slows and/or interest rates drop investment income goes down.<br>  <br>  - Premium income: economy slows down premium income slows, business look for ways to reduce costs, they take bigger excesses (deductibles in the US), maybe shut down some branches/ factories/ warehouses… shops sell less so they hold/order less stock. Less stock means less transport, fewer sales means less Extended Warranty. People take fewer holidays. Fewer holidays… less travel INS and so on and so forth.<br>  <br>  - Claims: not ‘personal lines’ stuff as above (which is a fairly minor deal really), but surety claims … investment guarantees, (It was this type of insurance that caused AIG all its woes) mortgages etc.<br>  <br>  In the long term they may gain through<br>  <br>   - Capital: Insurance is currently going through a ‘soft market’ phase; very simply put this means there is a lot of capital floating around the insurance market. As with any market supply and demand says when supply is high prices are low. As the credit crunch kicks in available capital is likely to decrease (all insurers borrow money one way or another) and consequently prices (premiums) will rise.<br>  <br>   - Acquisitions: The next year or two could be a nice time to buy other businesses. For example AIG have already said they’ll be looking to sell off at least some of their empire. Well reserved and financed groups like AVIVA are well placed to takes advantage and may get a business for a lot less than it would have cost even 6 months ago.<br>  <br>  Sorry it’s a bit of a tome… but hope it gave you some ideas.|`|pcGgavNtaa	Insurance companies could actually lose during this poor economic time. The reason that is so is because people become desperate during this time and do things that they normally will not do. <br>  Say a person is behind in the mortgage payments, but has 40% equity in the house.  They can't sell the house so they burn it down to collect the insurance money. The company pays on something that they normally would not have to pay out on. <br>  A person looses their job, they loose their house, looses just about everything they have worked for. He sees no way out and commits suicide (if after first 2 years of policy).  The insurance company pays out on his life insurance policy. This may have been a policy they would either never paid out on (he let it lapse) or they would have collected more premium.  <br>  So yes during these times insurance companies can loose.

pcGgavNtaa	Capital gains are monies you earn, but not from a job.  Capital gains are from increase values in stocks, properties etc.  The difference between what you paid and what you sold the asset for is the capital gain. That is taxed at 15% now.  Now that Mr. Obama is going to be the next president that rate will probably go up to 20 - 28%.  |`|Z9e6XQYzaa	It mostly has to do with stocks and bonds.  If you buy stocks or bonds and they are not protected in a 401k or other retirement vehicle then when the value goes up you have to claim the difference as a profit and pay capital gains, which presently is 15%.  the same thing would apply to investment real estate or in the sale of a home if the money is not put back into another home.<br>  <br>  If you are rich you could put all of your money into the stock market and the money you make would only be taxed at 15%, much less than what most of us pay in taxes.|`|AA10419793	This is something from days gone by when you bought something; for instance-stock; for a dollar and sold it for two dollars making a profit.  This was processed on a Sch D and you paid taxes on the profit.  However, things have changed as now we buy stock and sell if for less; a loss.  The nice thing is that this loss can be taken against other income that will reduce your tax bite.  Democrat policy has been to increase taxes to provide more freebies for those who don't want to work so this means that your income taxes will have to be increased to make up for the losses you are taking selling stock or property or whatever.  What you work for will have to be redistributed to those who don't work now that osambinbama has been elected.  Bon Apetite!!!

Now just hope no one from the other two jobs comes and gets a job at the restaurant you are now working at. <br>  If the boss can't trust you to tell the truth on an application how can he expect you to be telling the truth when there is $200 missing?  |`|EPaYoJaiaa	Assuming makes an *** out of u and me.<br>  You assumed wrong.

EGEOOZLXaa	How to build good credit: Buy something that maxes out your credit line, and pay it off immediately.  They'll up your credit line.  Do it over and over to the maximum of your line, and pay it off.  You'll get a higher and higher credit line.  Never buy something if you can't pay it off the very next pay day. That's the key.<br>  <br>  p.s. The reason for this is easy. The credit card companies don't make any money off of you if you pay it off immediately, so they up your credit line to get their hooks in you.|`|wabppWo8aa	Use it to buy things you need to buy anyway (food, gas,etc.) and then pay the balance off when the bill comes.<br>  <br>  Then once in a while, let the balance carry for a few months.  Example:  Buy something for $60, then pay $20 per month (or whatever the minimum will allow, but always pay a few dollars more than the minimum so they can't say that you ONLY pay the minimum) and pay it off in 2-4 billing cycles.  Like pay $24 per month till it's paid for.<br>  <br>  This shows that you are able to pay for something over several months and it will make you an attractive credit card customer.  You'll then get offers for cards with great rates, if your card does not already have a great rate.|`|pcGgavNtaa	Use it only when you have the money in the bank to pay for what ever it is you just purchased. You might take a couple of months to pay it off (2-3).  Then buy something else when you have the cash.<br>  Do not use it when you do not have the cash. Be careful when the cc company tries to up your credit line. It is tempting to go ahead and use it up to the limit. <br>  Use it to build your credit so you can buy a home. But then again buy what you can afford, do not stretch yourself beyond what you can afford. |`|e4596390515e8d11a71ef13fed732cc9aa	Use it for whatever you want as long as you pay it off the entire time each time.  Showing that your charging and then paying it off will build GOOD credit.<br>  <br>  One key point to remember is to never charge something if you didnt physically have the money on hand.  A credit card is something that some people take advantage of when they want something they cant afford.|`|cPhZKATTaa	Use it sparingly, and pay it off completely before it is overdue.|`|yfLm7myUaa	You just have to use it and pay if off in full every month and your credit score will shoot up.|`|AA12255861	Cut it up and close that account.!!!!

Keep paying what you are supposed to be paying and over time your credit will build |`|U7nj9Kg4aa	Try to spend on the credit card on a regular basis to show that you can handle the debt.  Every once in a while rack it up all the way and then pay it off right away (never charge more than you can afford to pay off before the interest kicks in.  This will show that the credit limit is easily within your budget to pay off on a regular basis.<br>  <br>  Here are some other ways to help build a good credit history.<br>  <br>  1) Establish a checking and savings account: Lenders see bank accounts as a sign of stability.<br>  <br>  2) Do you have any monthly bills that you can establish in your name? Do you have a cell phone that is in your parents name that you can perhaps switch to yours jointly? Paying bills on time shows that you can handle making payments on a regular basis and you are responsible in that manor.<br>  <br>  3) Use someone elses good credit to improve your own: Set up a joint debt with a parent or someone with good credit. That way you get approved and then work your butt off to pay it off as soon as possible. This will help boost your credit rating as well.<br>  <br>  4) Apply got a credit card: IT's the simpliest form of credit to get. If you can't get a regular credit card, ask for a secured credit card. A secured credit card is where you give them $500 for a deposit and they give you a $500 limit on your card to make sure they get paid. After you've shown that you can handle the debt request a regular card and get your deposit back. A secured card witll help give you a credit score as well. USe your credit card on a regular basis, whether you need to or not, just make sure you pay it off before the interest kicks in.<br>  <br>  5) Get a store credit card: Again, very easy to get.<br>  <br>  6) after you've used your credit card for a little while, try to get the smallest loan possible, like a $3000 loan or something, where it will have monthly payments. Pay it off faster than the scheduled payments, but not right away in one big lump sum.|`|AA12034021	Use it to pay for necessities, that you would have to pay for anyway, like food at the grocery store.<br>  <br>  The big problem with credit cards is, because you don't actually see the cash flowing out of your wallet, or how much money is left, people tend to spend more when using credit cards.  So don't use them for impulse purchases.|`|W30MOowuaa	Make payments on time each month, do not go over your credit limit.  Pay the total balance each month.

Its highest ever value was just a little under 7000.

The list of companies leaving (or even returning) is endless.|`|SI02JOQ4aa	The FTSE is usually pronounced "footsie" and stands for the Financial Times Share Index. The Financial Times being the leading business publication in the UK.<br>  <br>  They have a system of measuring the top 100 companies in the UK and publishing if the share prices in these companies are rising or falling.<br>  <br>  The 100 companies are split across all sectors - like banks, mining, hotels, oil etc etc - so that they give a fair indication of how trading is going.<br>  <br>  So, in bad times the share prices will be falling and "the footsie is down 80 points today" and in good times the opposite happens.<br>  <br>  How they award the points to each company is complicated - but it has used the same method over many decades, so you can measure the footsie today with the footsie 5 years ago.<br>  <br>  Twice a year, they refresh the list of the top 100 and some companies drop out and are replaced - so that the index is always reflective of the top 100 business companies in the UK.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.

It will make you stand out in all the interviews and if you stand out in the bosses mind then you will make the "cut"!  Remember to let the interviewer get the questions out before you answer, get to the interview about 10 minutes before you are supposed to be there, take your time on your answers, do not chew gum, always look them in the eyes, shake their hand when you get there and when you leave and always make a follow up call or email to the interviewer to let them know you appreciated their time and look forward to working with them in the near future. Good luck.|`|pcGgavNtaa	Clean shirt and dockers type slacks.  Shirt can be either polo or button down.  Tuck in your shirt and wear a belt.  Do NOT wear your pants down off your butt.  Look sharp and you will make a good impression.  Comb your hair and shave (if you do).  <br>  When interviewing look the person in the eye when talking to him/her. Do not mumble.  When asked a question wait for a second or two before you answer.  Gives you time to get your mind fully in gear.  Give good complete answers.  Ask questions about what you might be doing and what type of training you will be getting.  This shows interest in the job. <br>  When you get the job (not if) Work hard, show up on time, don't whine, do what you are told and you will excel in the job.

If you are in real estate sales, I wouldn't drive anything older than 3-4 years. <br>  <br>  I hate car payments too. I suggest that you do upgrade your cars if you think it will have an impact on your appearance and ultimately your success, but don't make payments. Go with the cars you have right now and take the $300/month that you would be spending on payments and save it. After you have a few thousand dollars, upgrade to a respectable used car with no body damage. Keep saving the $300/month, and when you have a few thousand more, sell the car and upgrade again. You'll be driving something fairly new in no time, but without the obligation of car payments. |`|XMxf8BGSaa	I have done outside sales before. Before you jump into a new vehicle make sure the job is gonna pay you well first. If its commision based work a couple of months and make sure ends are being met . I hate having a car payment.

I would fix what you have and wait until your probationary period with the company is up , just to make sure you have stability and they are going to keep you around! GOOD LUCK|`|AA11626425	Here is the simple answer - if you need or wear a suit to work - you need to upgrade.

It's one option.<br>  <br>  I think a lot of outside sales is based on an image.  People want to do business with those that are successful -- or portray themselves as successful.  It shows as a bad corporate image to pull up to a client you want to do big business with in some fixer-upper kind of car.  You are representing the company as well as yourself and you want to make a strong impression as your relationship with your client is what is going to make you the sale.<br>  <br>  If you can afford the $300 then I say do that.  It will go against what you really want to do but should pay off as you won't have to worry about any repairs or body work and it will also make a stronger impression with your potential customers.|`|pcGgavNtaa	The tough thing is going to be if you take someone out to lunch or something of that nature.  Some places you might be able to drive up to the side of the building or not be noticed as to what you drive.  <br>  I would think that you might want to start looking at a more dependable, fuel efficient car.  Selling one of the other cars and taking that money to make the down payment on it plus what you can save up in the next say 6 months should keep payments low.  <br>  Driving up in a BMW/Mercedes etc could look arrogant so that can work in reverse.  The car is not the person.  Make sure you are dresses appropriately and make a good presentation.  Do you believe in what you will be selling?  That would be key for me. 
49d798aae69c40cbf0926ebc21291224aa	That's correct - it isn't legally allowed.<br>  <br>  Employment law states that after so many hours, you must be allowed a lunch break.  Whilst it doesn't matter when this break is taken, what is important is that it isn't at either end of the day.  The point is, you cannot be rested, and therefore complete your duties to a satisfactory standard, if you've worked the entire day without a break.<br>  <br>  Some employers may allow this, but the law certainly doesn't permit it.<br>  <br>  However, you say that she is returning from maternity leave.  The law in the UK does require that all employers *consider* requests for flexible working hours from parents.  Note that consider is not the same as "agree to" - they may consider it and then say no.  So, for example, your daughter could ask to have her hours reduced by five hours per week so that she can leave one hour earlier each day (assuming she normally works a five-day week).  Of course, her salary would then be pro-rated accordingly.|`|IBFlHjsdaa	Federal laws require you to have a lunch break if you work more than 6 hours.<br>  Sorry, cannot be done.  <br>  <br>  My crew did it all the time, work through lunch, then leave early, but get paid the full day.

Her budget could be cut, extras reduced, etc so that she could stay at home.  <br>  She will only get one chance to be home with the baby.  Don't listen to the crap that the people at childcare love the child, the child needs interaction with other children to socialize, etc. There is nothing better than mom being at home with child. Then she will not have to skip lunch but be able to enjoy it with her child.  Strained peas and all!!

Having a huge house payment is not fun.  I have seen people with big houses and nothing in it because they can't afford furniture.  Here is a good rule of thumb for a house payment.<br>  1. Only get a payment that is no more then 25% of your take home pay per month. So in your case I am guessing that $60,000 is before tax so you would be around the 25% tax bracket so $15,000 goes to uncle sam.  That leaves $45,000 take home per year.  Divide that by 12 months and your net monthly take home would be $3,750.00 then 25% of that would be around $950.00 a month for a house payment.  <br>  2.  Get a max 15 year FIXED rate mortgage.<br>  Be careful going to the bank and letting them tell you how much you qualify for.  There job is to sell you money and they want you to take out as much as you can and still be low risk of them. <br>  By my calculation a $115,000 mortgage on a 15 year term at 6.25% would cost around $986 a month (before tax's and insurance) If you stick around that price then you are will with in your means and will have money left to save for retirement and purchases. |`|92nq9wZVaa	When applying for a home loan your credit report will be reviewed and you may be required to provide a number of other details, including: Employment and income records, Tax Returns for the last few years List of assets, List of liabilities and what you owe, Your budget showing monthly living expenses so that you can demonstrate an ability to pay.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.worldbestloans.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.worldbestloans.com/</a><br>  <br>  With this information you and your lender will be able to determine the kind of home loan and size of the right mortgage for you.

However, depending on the carrier you may be able to extend the lifetime max for very little additional premium. I have been a health agent for 15 years and chances are  that if you have medical expenses in excess of $1 million, you would not survive the accident/illness in question anyway.<br>  <br>  Having said all of that however, you may want to seek a reinsurer who will come in and accept risk for any medical bills in excess of one million. The premium should be next to nothing, and for obvious reasons.<br>  <br>  In my opinion you have ample coverage. My only suggestion would be to see if your policy has an aggregate. ( a per sickness/accident limit) you could have a one million lifetime max, but you may have a per illness/accident cap of only say $250,000 for example....this is important to know.   <br>  <br>  Also in response to Kay's comment....NEVER rely on insurance from your employer.

Termination, job change, etc. An individually owned plan is yours as long as you pay the premium, and gives you much more control and freedom. what would happen if you worked for a company who offered health insurance, but then you had a heart attack or got diabetes? Then you would be FORCED to stay at that job just to have coverage. Whereas if you had a private plan your job would not be slave to your benefits, etc. You need to look into an HSA (Health Savings Account) which will not only save you monthly premiums but also assist you in paying less taxes AND saving for retirment.|`|DSLlioPcaa	For your current status, it's a standard. When you begin to work, hopefully your employer has a good group insurance policy to offer you without having you to contribute to the insurance premium.|`|pcGgavNtaa	For now, unless you have some kind of major illness or you are involved in a severe accident.  I am 49 years old and I have not even spent 1/4 of that (my insurance carriers have not) on medical issues. If you are normal healthy male it will be fine.

Call Panda Express tomorrow and ask to speak to the general manager. If she is not there ask for her name and when she will be in. Don't speak to anyone else about it because they are not the ones that look at applications.<br>  <br>  If you speak to the general manager say "Hi my name is .... i am just calling because i submitted an application and i am just calling to make sure that you recieved it and to find out your hiring process"<br>  <br>  Usually since you got her/him on the spot they will set up an interview right away or atleast explain the situation to you so you are not left waiting around.<br>  <br>  Goodluck!!

iaugc41aaa	The legal position is this - there is no legal requirement to have a tenancy agreement for a basic residential tenancy, but it is crazy not to have one.  The real purpose of the document is to set out the rights and responsibilities of each party - that way, there is less likely to be a dispute.<br>  <br>  The absence of a written agreement in the UK means that the law will imply certain things as being in existence.  And that means that you will be treated as an Assured Shorthold Tenant, which means that your landlord has to give you 2 months Notice to Quit to bring your tenancy to an end.  And even then you can only be evicted if there is a court order.<br>  <br>  The fact that you live rent free is not particularly relevant.  The law would treat the AST as having different conditions.  The "payment" that you make is your services in keeping the property secure and acting as a live-in caretaker.|`|Y8kjVeLyaa	It would be very hard for them to get you out at all actually....with no agreement you are within your rights to stay put till you find somewhere else...the law actually favours the tenant.|`|SI02JOQ4aa	In the absence of a formal agreement, they only have to give you "reasonable" notice, which is hard to define.<br>  <br>  If you pay your rent monthly and adjudicator would probably settle on one month.

Angeline G has an Obese head. |`|RfjMX7N9aa	<br>  <br>  <br>  Here are the errors in your hypothesis’<br>  <br>  1) You said "and wouldn't mind paying extra taxes" okay, there is a spot on the IRS form where it states you can give more money, why should it be mandatory? <br>  2) Taking from “rich cry babies’  how does that make poor people better off? If you take from the rich and give to the poor, then my definition the poor become the rich and the cycle repeats itself.<br>  3) Also, what makes people poor, usually its their life style, for example I have an employee, a young black women that complains she doesn’t have enough money. She makes 60K a year. How can this be that she is always broke, 3 kids 2 different fathers and no husband. <br>  4) Finally, its not your money, its not the government’s money its MY money, I earned it, not you not Barak Obama. I went out and got a BA and MBA and now working on my DBA and guess what I am paying for it myself. No one is giving me anything, not my parents, not the government and certainly not a lazy liberal like you.  You get what you earn!  <br>  <br>  The sad truth is that you want government to take care of you, everything for free, don’t work watch MTV and play xbox360 smoke dope all day long. The real trouble is that you can not grasp a simple concept, For  rich people when the taxes are too high the just don’t work, they don’t have to since they already their house, and their car, its already paid off. If rich people don’t work  then they don’t  pay taxes, but wait where does the money come from, guess who, that’s right the middle class, but wait if the middle class can’t afford and they don’t buy it, so where does the tax money come from then, well I’ll be darn the poor. (ps. This in not speculation it’s a fact, look up France and millionaire problem they had where the taxes were 50% and all of the rich people left Monaco).  <br>  <br>  I know you don’t get this, its all good, once I post this you will call me names, but the fact is that every democracy before ours has fail, and I quote ‘A democracy will continue to exist up until the time that voters discover they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public treasury.’<-- Google it<br>  |`|pcGgavNtaa	One thing most of you are forgetting is who puts the money into the system so the workers can work.  If the employer pays higher taxes then he has less to work with and thereby can't put it into growing the business and hiring ungreatful employees. <br>  In today's maketplace most people I see do not want to work. They want to get paid for doing nothing. They think they are entitled to more $$.  Many of the "rich" business people you are talking about started out poor. They just had the drive and inititive to start their own business and to grow the economy. Most people have to be told when to come to work and when to take a break and when to go home.  God forbid you ask them to work over time or do something that is not their typical job. <br>  I have grown a company from 3 people and $300,000 in sales to over 30 people and $1,600,000. I treat my employees very well. I have had less than 2% turnover in the past 5 years.  I pay more taxes than all the employees combined why should I have to pay even more?  <br>  80% of taxes in the US are paid by 10% of the workers. 90% is paid by 1%.  Not only do i pay more income taxes, but I also pay more property taxes, more sales taxes and contribute to the economy more than any of my employees. I took the risk so why should I not get the benefit of the increase in sales. <br>  Trust me.  Accountants will look for more ways to shelter money. Paying taxes is something that "EVERYONE" should do. <br>  You talk about going out and getting a loan, ha, good luck with that. Oh that is right Mr. Obama is going to take my extra taxes and give it to you. Well if you could not and did not do it before he was president then you will probably not do it now that he is.

sr7jX2wYaa	They may not have more info than you gave, but once they turn it to a collections agency They will find you. I agree they were trying to add unnecessary charges  to your bill. depending on the #  of stitches I would think $200 is reasonable payment. It will go on your credit rating if you do not pay it though.|`|7aueTuAXaa	First of all, if you and your friends aren't doctors, you can't know for sure that you didn't need the stitches.  As for the tetanus shot, if it has been a couple of years since you had one, and you have an injury, it is usually recommended that you get another one.<br>  <br>  By having your name and cell phone number, they will be able to get any information they need about you.  <br>  <br>  If you don't pay the bill, it will be turned over to a collection agency and they will call and ask you to make arrangements to pay off the bill.  If you still don't pay it off, it will be a bad mark on your credit record and they may use legal means to get you to pay the bill.  |`|y2ZukikXaa	Is your question of whether you are in fact stealing or just whether you'd be caught?|`|AV3YACAZaa	They'd put you into collections and it would ruin your credit for the rest of your life...trust me they wouldn't let you leave if they didn't have enough information to do that.<br>  <br>  Regardless of the fact that you thought you didn't need the services, you had them done.

So you owe the money...no reason you should steal.|`|Mf8b7w1Xaa	They can request information from your cell phone company. Government can actually demand request for this information.

dPLkNRNuaa	It all depends on the company you work for. Some companies are good to work for and some are not.<br>  <br>  An office claims rep is an inside insurance adjuster. It can be a good job. The pay is generally pretty fair. And there is mobility with in the insurance industry. You can start as an OCR - maybe move into a field position.<br>  <br>  If it turns out that you are working for one of the bad companies -- then join your local claims association - when you speak to adjusters at other companies and they seem friendly, ask them about their company- what's it like to work for. You will get an idea of how the good companies are and who the bad ones are.<br>  <br>  I started out at one of the bad ones. But sucked it up for 2 years - got some good experience and was able to get on with a much better company. I stayed with them a while and then moved back home to another state and ended up getting on with a great company. I plan on being here until I die or retire - which ever comes first. <br>  <br>  In general, the worst companies to work for are going to have the highest turn over rate. Which means, they are the easiest ones to find jobs with. But again - if you end up with one of those - make sure you learn everything you can - get some good experience and try to get on with a better company.<br>  <br>  (I know the ones I consider bad to work for - but I'm not going to post any names on a public board).<br>  <br>  In general - claims is a challenging job. You have to be self motivated - be able to think on your feet - be organized. You have a chance to help people when they really need it. But quite frequently - they take their frustrations out on you. No matter what they say - remember - it's not personal. <br>  <br>  You can earn a decent living working in claims. Many claims people are the primary income in their family. But it is not an easy job. |`|F66hnqlIaa	You know when I started this job for work comp I wasn't sure about it. However there are some people who are good at it and some who hate the job more.<br>  <br>  This job deals with alot of angry people at times, depending on what field. But these people can be nasty people who think the insurance company is out to get them. You got to have thick skin to do this kind of job. Also be good at multitasking. <br>  <br>  This job can be stressful at times and it's hard not to think about whats going on each time. However I really think this job can also test your patience with people. Not everybody can do this job, I've heard that this job can burn people out in 3 years, however a job is a job and the pay has been pretty good compared to what other jobs offered right now.<br>  <br>  I would do this...try the job for a year and see how you like it. If you don't like it by 6 months look for another job but keep your job until you find something within the company or outside. This way you have a job.

This way, their cost of money is much less than a "stock" carrier (mutuals do not have to pay dividends on the stock nor are they answerable to the public), which allows them more funds for YOUR training...<br>  <br>  Put in your time then get out of claims...Trust me on this.  (Bottom line, it's a     s.h.i.t.t.y.    job.|`|pcGgavNtaa	Unfortunately it is probably one of the most thankless jobs there is. <br>  If you pay out on a claim the insured thinks you should not have paid out that much (GL or workers comp).  Your loss ratio goes up and you look bad to the company. Also the payout may not be what the person was hoping to get.<br>  If you do not pay out on a claim the insurance company is happy and the insured is happy, but the person that was injured is not happy.

0yqQg9CXaa	I love credit cards.  I have never paid a penny interest in 10 years.  You just have to make sure you pay in full each and every month.<br>  <br>  A cash advances is a VERY bad idea.  <br>  If you have invested since 10, why not take some of the profits from your investments?<br>  <br>  You can get 0 apr on balance transfers.  As far as I know all cash advances have instant interest which is always higher than normal apr.<br>  <br>  Credit cards are not for borrowing money, they are for using and paying off.  Keep in mind rich people never pay interest, that's why they are rich.<br>  .|`|1f34cb08ac2251c3afe6fe04a9dfbc46aa	using a cash advance to invest is possibly the dumbest thing you can do with a credit card.  most cash advance rates are north of 20%, which means you'd have a pretty high hurdle rate.<br>  <br>  don't invest using borrowed money.  if you want more money to invest, then get a job and put your paycheck into your brokerage account.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  most cards that offer "0% for 12 months" or whatever don't mean for cash advances.  most are only for purchases or balances transfers.|`|83rz9t5iaa	My tip is to not go into debt. Me(19) and my husband(24) dont have debt and it is amazing! you might think that it will just be a 2000 dollar credit then it will be i want these jeans then well i really like that stereo than next thing you know you racked up 5000 in debt. We pay cash for everything and it is great not oweing people money. if you did get a credit card do a little math first. The average credit card has an intrest rate of 11% and is compounded monthly. If you pay 50 dollars a month to pay that off it will take you 50 months equalling 2500 dollars. Why not save the cash up and save yourself 500 dollars of intrest?|`|pcGgavNtaa	Don't do it.  Save the money, work two jobs, anything but a credit card. Learn delayed gratification. Don't be a buy it now person.  Pay $$$ for stuff.  <br>  Getting a credit card can be the worst thing you will ever do. |`|9yYFOjaqaa	Do not take a cash advance.  They charge you around 20% APR, plus a cash advance fee, which may be 3% up front.  This gets costly quick.  It is a HORRIBLE method to get cash for investing.  Go to a bank and get a loan.

He hasn't even taken office yet.<br>  <br>  Even if he follows through on his campaign promise, it would likely be at least 1-2 years (minimum - likely longer) before such a plan took effect.<br>  <br>  There would need to be planning and development.  Congress would need to approve whatever was being proposed.  And then there would likely be a substantially long implementation period.<br>  <br>  You're not looking at something that could happen any time soon.  (If it happens during this Presidential term at all.)|`|RNqRnG86aa	From the Obama / Biden web site:<br>  <br>  Q. How much will it cost us taxpayers?<br>  <br>  A.

It will cost trillions of $$ because the government can't run anything right. You will be told what benefits and or operations you can have because the government will be deciding whether you are worth saving. Oh and when they tell you that you can have that operation wait in line for about 3 years to get it. By then you will be dead so then the next person will get to step up on line. 
qWytoOMmaa	The question really is, why did they put you in the new position that you were doing before?  And until you understand that it will be very hard to make a decision.  <br>  <br>  For example, if the decision to was made simply because they need your expertise and skills and don't have another solution, then ask what they are doing to remedy this, and when they expect to have it solved.  Let them know that you are very interested in contining to be challenged, and that this position doesn't really challenge you in signifigantly<br>  <br>  If however, you ask the same question, and the answer is more vague, and there seems to be no end date or strategy to get you back to where you were, then that is a potiential red flag.  There are some pretty tough questions that need to be asked if you find yourself in this position:<br>  <br>  -Is there anything else that I can do that will challenge me while this situation is being solved?<br>  <br>  -What feedback can you give me regarding my performance in the short time I've been here.  What do you see me needing to do to continue to add value?<br>  <br>  -What can I do to help in solving this current situation?<br>  <br>  All of these questions are designed to help your employer know you are very intersted in doing the best possible job, and finding out if there is an underlying problem that you may not be aware of.  That's why they are tough.<br>  <br>  These are just suggestions - there are many other possibilities depending on the dynamics at play (company culture, economic situation of the company, etc.)<br>  |`|pcGgavNtaa	Do your job to the best of your ability. Work hard, take on extra responsibility, don't complain or whine, be on time, stay a little later. The company will see your hard work and move you along to a higher position. Don't be a cry baby and quit because you got moved. You are the new kid on the block. Not sure if you have noticed, but getting a new job could be tough. |`|TEevHtiAaa	oh dude.. this sucks. I hate it when employers lie!!! <br>  stay there for another 2 months maybe, so total of 3 and see if things improve, maybe they are telling the truth and it is temporary? at the same time keep a lookout for other jobs, and hey if one comes along with what you want, better position and pay, go for it! good luck.|`|tX57rwksaa	 Hi ! in these times of depression if you have any job at all that pays the rent and keeps you well fed, you keep it and get on with it. When you read the fact that employers are shedding labour to survive there is going to be a lot of making three people do the work of five and this change of position will continue in all sectors. Just think again and carry on.   
93bb2649f329b412f6562a3a76a57633aa	Interest accumulates and you are charged a late fee.  In addition, your minimum payment the second month is twice what it would normally be.  The card issuer COULD sue you, but they won't.  It is simply not worth the effort until you are at least a few months late.|`|YB9hxefFaa	You usually get an over due fee and a lot of annoying phone calls. It could affect your credit rating also, be carefull of that.|`|bf6d71eb12786b8c9eedfbe98244a8f4aa	Well the creditors can report the delinquent account to the credit reporting agency that can show on the report up to 7 years.<br>  Even one missed payment. <br>  <br>  If you continue to not pay month to month, They can turn the account over to a collection agency which also would have a right to report a 2nd account listing to the credit reoprt within the 7 years of the original listing.<br>  <br>  They could file law suit and obtain judgment against you, yet another tradeline listing that can show on the credit report 7 years from the file date... and if you live in a state that allows for judgments being re-newed, that can be another judgment listing for 7 years from file date.<br>  <br>  As fa as not paying one month the fee's for late payment double. Best just to pay it all if you can at the time its supposed to be paid.<br>  |`|TEFfCt3Saa	Go see your local banker they have many ways they can help The main requirement is sincerity. The main thing is act now. The credit card company can stick you for late fees. if the fees put you over your limit they can add that to your balance then on top of all this they can add interest only to be repeat over and over again till you get it paid down. Also cut the card up in little pieces. Credit card companies don't want you to pay them off they want to hold you for life.|`|pcGgavNtaa	Look at your budget. Try to cut any wasteful spending out. You should be able to find about $200.  Use that to pay on the credit card. Work on trying to pay more than the minimum. If you pay only the minimum you will be paying for about 20 years on that card.  <br>  May hurt your credit minimally if you only do it once. Work on getting that balance down as much as possible. |`|SwFz1bAmaa	You will get some HUGE finance charges heaped on top of your already huge finance charges.<br>  <br>  The credit card companies are in business to charge FINANCE CHARGES.. they don't really care if you pay it off or not... they will JUST CHARGE YOU MORE... plus you will also have to pay LATE CHARGES.<br>  <br>  If you are that much in debt... you are going under financially.. and you can't even wipe out the credit card debt by taking bankruptcy thanks to George Bush... you sill owe the credit card companies.. SO YOU ARE STUCK.|`|pavbeFVDaa	don't just not pay, call the companies talk to a supervisor if you have to, sometimes you can work a deal with them that they won't raise your interest rates, if it's only one month on your credit report it won't make much of a difference. make sure you let them know that you will be paying next month, remember your are in charge of the situation. if you take first step and contact them first they are usually a little more likely to work with you.|`|sKd6mncZaa	In the UK each credit card company will record with 1 or multiple credit reference agencies (Experian, Equifax, Call Credit) the number 1 for the corresponding credit account on your credit file.<br>  <br>  Every month you missed consequtively will increase this so the 2nd month missed a 2 will be recorded.  When you pay on time it will set back to 0.<br>  <br>  It is unlikely if you have a good credit history that a couple of 1's on your file will have any effect but if this forms into a pattern of behaviour then it will certainly effect you.<br>  <br>  Nornally after 6 missed payments and the credit card company trying to contact you they will put your account in Default and if you still don't pay they will issue you with a court notice.<br>  <br>  Any records like this on your credit file will disappear after 6 years including the 1 month missed|`|A1ftqRH4aa	You will get hit with a late charge - probably $35 or so.  If you are close to your credit  limit, you will probably be pushed over the limit with the late fee and the next months interest.  At that point you will be hit with an overlimit fee - probably another $35 or so.  If your account goes over 30 days late, it will be reported as such to the credit reporting agencies.  in addition, the cc company may increase your interest rate.  With 'Universal Default' all of your credit cards could rate-jack you.<br>  <br>  When your next bill comes, the minimum will be at least double the norm plus the fees to put you back under the limit on the card.  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>

fB12eqsWaa	No there isn't, companies have to display copies of required insurances like Employers liability insurance etc somewhere in the building, but that's it. <br>  <br>  In my experience they usually hang them on staff notice boards, other than that it's a private matter between the company and the insurer.|`|pcGgavNtaa	No it is a private business matter so there is no registry. 
gHzQdp6Xaa	At your age it may be good to learn the ropes of an agency to get to know selling techniques, and how to build you client base. It also may be important to develop industry relationships.  Once more experienced become independent and work with an agency as independent to ensure you are at a top contract level with various carriers. this way you will get top commission, as well as have access to better products. |`|pcGgavNtaa	is this what you want to do?  If so it would be good experience. If you want to work in the insurance industry it is good to know what the agent goes through. <br>  If you are thinking about going into sales it is good see what a cut throat business it is. <br>  Insurance is mostly about relationships. Take care of your customers and stay in contact with them. <br>  Learn all you can. 
pDSlV0Jnaa	It is perfectly normal and acceptable to ask what the position's work schedule would be.

Once you get the job you can ask how many hours they are expecting out of you.<br>  <br>  It can be negotiable.|`|pcGgavNtaa	Are you applying for a full-time job or a part-time job?  If you are applying for a full-time job then you will be required to work in that job for say about 40 hours a week. Overtime will be a bonus!  I say bonus because many people are getting laid off right now so take it and put the $$$ in the bank.  Work hard at this position and the boss will look at you for the next promotion.  
pcGgavNtaa	If you call them you can almost guarantee that you will not get the job. If they hire you before the end of the week you need to call the other company and let them know you will not be coming in on Monday. <br>  If the second company does not make a decision by the end of this week then go to work for the other company. |`|L3hc9EOiaa	emplyers these days show no compassion or consideration for employees, so say nothing, if the better job comes off then take it, otherwise go to the first one you got, if the other one then calls, take it but let the first one know that the job you have been offered had been tabled before you interviewed for them and was your first preference, so as not to burn your bridges totally|`|AA10777253	Call them IMMEDIATELY!! You have a bird in one hand but the other one is not in the bush. You have nothing to lose by calling the potential employer and explaining that you have a current offer and wondered if they have made a decision about you yet. That's perfectly acceptable and is not pushy. See what they come back with. <br>  <br>  -- Liam
pcGgavNtaa	You are going to have to do that for a while until you get some experience.

My sister's boyfriend works with them and is doing pretty good. 
zH7KZJEZaa	Youve obviously got a lot of dedication into this job. You need to sit down with the manager and explain how you think you deserve better for all the hard work you have put in, you could have put far less work in and still be earning almost the same. You should be getting a significant extra because these 'raises' arent doing you any good, the problem is the raising is because he/she would have to increase your wage anyway, which is unfair and may seem nice at the time but youre only earning what you SHOULD have been earning if without the raise.<br>  <br>  If you genuinely feel you deserve better explain how you should be earning more than the other workers. Good luck, and dont slack and forget about this, you might as well give it a go and what comes from it can only be good.|`|PdxMOlcaaa	Well you have asked before and gotten what you want.

It sounds like you are being paid fairly. An ice cream shop is considered a "starter job" and while some pay more to people like managers, they usually pay minimum wage up to a dollar over minimum wage to employees, even long time employees. If you feel like your time and hard work is worth more money, then it's time to look for another job at another place, maybe even a manager position since you now have experience under your belt.

OAKuDqXXaa	The number of deductions does not really matter.  You can put zero and it will be fine.  The deductions just determines how much they take out of your paycheck for income tax.  The more deductions you have, the more they take out.  But in the end, it all works out so you will be paying the same amount for your yearly income tax; it just seems like less of a hit to your wallet if you have more deductions, since that money goes toward your income tax.|`|AA11284831	Claiming 0 withholding allowances will result in the highest amount of tax being withheld.  However if your income is very low there may still not be any Federal income tax withheld.  As a non-dependent, if your income is less than $8,950 for 2008 you would not have any Federal income tax liability so there would be no need to have any tax withheld.<br>  <br>  A single person can usually safely claim 2 allowances without running a risk of owing much at filing time.  That will usually result in just about break-even at filing time, usually within $100 either way.  If you want to be sure that you won't owe, just claim 1 allowance.  If you claim 0, too much tax will be withheld.  You'd get that back when you filed, but your paychecks will be smaller all year long so that really makes no sense at all.

AHyDHombaa	From what I have heard, there are a lot of people having problems with their NY State Refunds this year.  As most have already said, Direct Deposit is supposed to be faster than receiving a paper check, but there are some that have been waiting four or five weeks for their refunds.<br>  <br>  If you entered your bank account information incorrectly, that could cause a delay, but if that was the case, you should have already received an update on the T & F website that said your refund has been processed. <br>  <br>  As for me, I filed my NYS Tax Return on 1/24/2009 and for a while the only info I would get on the Taxation and Finance website was that they had received and were processing my return, but no other information was available.<br>  <br>  I wound up calling the NYS Dept. of T & F hot-line after two weeks had passed, but all I received was an automated recording that basically said that they were not answering any questions about refund statuses this year. ????<br>  <br>  However two days after that, I checked the website again and they had me scheduled for a deposit on 2/11/2009. All in all, the refund took a little over two weeks to arrive, but like I said, there are others I've seen on Y!A that have been waiting for NY returns for almost five weeks. Unfortunately for us taxpayers they seem to be exceptionally slow this year.<br>  <br>  Good luck, you can try calling the NYS Dept. of Taxation and Finance, but I think you'd be wasting your breath.  They're extremely reluctant to answer ANY questions this year about refunds.  Just sit tight I guess...  It's got to come eventually.|`|iU4Q2GOdaa	i efiled on like the 19th, and got my direct deposit almost 2 weeks ago.... so maybe check the status of your refund on the irs website!|`|zwlt1QWDaa	Wow! wouldn't that be ironic????

So hiring US workers are more expensive and they usually want benefits as well. Hiring workers in countries with looser labor laws means that the Companies can pay less for more, such as China and India.
DAMZKbpDaa	Your bank policy is apparently they don't permit deposits in accounts not in the check's name. It was returned to IRS, and they will mail a check.|`|cIheKVRmaa	If the refund is in another person besides the banking account holders name, then yes, many banks will return the refund. We always make sure people call the bank, to let them now someone else is getting a refund from the IRS deposited. Banks are concerned about fraud. That means your son will receive a mailed check in about 2-6 weeks.|`|CP8X3X4raa	Means that your name was NOT on the refund check and the IRS will not release funds to someone other than the name on the check. OR your bank realized the names did not match. It might take a while to figure it out. That was not a good idea. He should have just gotten a check and cashed it or you maybe you should open up a savings account for him. Avoid issues like this in the future. Good luck|`|PkCTYMbnaa	You shouldve checked with your bank  or checked this site there have been plenty asking about this same subject. Most banks will reject the check if the persons name is not on the account. That is for their protection in case a matter should arise where someone claims they did not receive their money.

You should be prepared to present evidence that you tried to correct the problem before you quit.<br>  <br>  Examples of qualifying reasons are:<br>  <br>      * You were laid off due to lack of work.<br>      * You are still working but the employer reduced your hours. (Your reduction in hours must not be the result of a disciplinary action.)<br>      * You were fired without work-related misconduct. Examples of misconduct are a violation of company policy; violation of law; neglect or mismanagement of your position; or failure to perform your work acceptably if you are capable of doing so.<br>      * You quit your job for a good well-documented work-related or medical reason. TWC may rule good cause if the work situation would cause a person who truly wants to keep the job to leave it.<br>            o Examples of possible good cause are unsafe working conditions or a significant change in hiring agreement, or not receiving payment for your work.<br>            o Examples of medical reasons are quitting on your doctor's advice, or quitting to care for a minor child, or quitting to care for a terminally ill spouse if there is no alternative care provider.<br>      * You quit to protect yourself from family violence or stalking, evidenced by an active or recently issued protective order, a police record documenting family violence or stalking directed against you, or medical documentation of family violence against you.<br>  <br>  <br>  That's from the TWC website.  Sounds like he may qualify.  Good luck!|`|LCqiO7O3aa	It sounds like he paid in long enough and he should try anyway.<br>  Good Luck.

ee63beadde43c1c4370dcd700471caebaa	Most medical sales careers will require a degree. If you have several years of sales experience they may give you consideration. Having a college degree is almost mandatory with most companies who are looking for good sales people. My suggestion is to contact some of the surgical instrument companies and talk with them. If I were you and didn't want to go to college then I would emphasize my sales ability and accomplishments. Tell them how much you were able to increase sales or share of market in your previous sales positions. I would talk more about how you are self motivated and have a lot of energy. Tell them that you know how to work a sales territory and how good you are at closing sales. I would not lie to them but talk more about your strengths than weaknesses. I would probably not mention the lack of a degree unless they mention it. More than likely the will ask about it. In fact, you will probably have your education listed on your resume. Good luck.|`|W8R6g5hEaa	I have some of these companies have training programs. I heard through a friend that we did a couple weeks session and he was out on the field in offices. I work in a medical environment, They seem to hire attractive people to push the sales of there products from the drug companies. But if doctors do use it they just don't. Our newest policy is not to accept any gifts or forms of advertising.

uV54p794aa	Feel safe? Usually the pople you are taking care of are really ill, so I really wouldn't worry. Always carry a cell phone & make sure someone always knows where you are.. gl!|`|29ZL58Xjaa	A good suggestion is to go through an agency like Nurses Next Door, We Care, or some of the larger recognized companies. They will generally know what the customer is like, and what risks you would have as a RN in their homes. I would do this to be safe. A lot of these companies will run criminal record checks on the patients and their families etc.  I would not trust something like Craigslist or something like that, in which you wouldn't know them from a bar of soap.
nYnZr8AMaa	Since you are under 18, then you are not required to pay into the Canada Pension Plan, and because your income level is below the basic personal exemption, you will not have to pay any income taxes either.  You are not technically required to file a return in this situation but you should do so anyway so that you can get a refund for any tax your employer may have withheld from your pay cheques.  <br>  <br>  Have a look at your final pay statement (or T4 slip if you have received it already) and see if any income tax was deducted from your pay during the year.  By filing a return, you should be able to get all of this tax back.<br>  <br>  This will be a very simple return to complete.  You should be able to do it yourself.  If you are having difficulty, ask a friend or relative with experience completing tax returns to help.  <br>  <br>  See below for a link to the 2008 tax forms.|`|xMqgB2GDaa	If you make any income, and had taxes withheld, you'll want to file to get that money back to you in the form of a refund.<br>  <br>  If it wasn't withheld, you still need to file and report that income, but it is unlikely you will owe anything. The minimum for not reporting is $2800 I believe. <br>  <br>  But even under 18, if you made money, you still need to report it.|`|MqNTKXlKaa	No, you don't owe taxes.  In Canada, you are not taxed on your first $9600 that you earn.<br>  <br>  When you don't owe the government money, there is no penalty for not filing taxes.  <br>  <br>  You should always file a tax return, even if you are under 18.  Even though you are too young to qualify for certain credits, you will accumulate RRSP deduction room for when you are earning money. <br>  <br>  The best part is that if your employer deducted any tax from your cheques (they should have) you will get every penny back.<br>  <br>  If you don't know how to file your taxes, H&R Block will do them for you for $29.95, and anyone over 15 can now walk out of their offices with a cheque/debit card with their refund.

4TkzoZThaa	They care more about paralegal certificates.  Initially the bigger firms will want a 4 year degree plus a paralegal certificate from an ABA approved program.  The first can be avoided through gaining experience, but usually not the second.  Paralegal jobs are more plentiful right now because the firms are giving more associate work to paralegals to cut costs.  It does make the job much more demanding however.  Overall money will vary greatly based on location.    I have a 4 year degree but no paralegal certificate.  I am currently an evening law student so that might have filled in the gaps.  I work as a jr. paralegal at a litigation boutique in Texas and make 45 plus benefits and bonuses.  But it all depends on where you live.|`|AA10200229	I'm a student in an Associates Paralegal program, and they are quite in demand. I don't think you'll have any problem getting a job once you graduate. Contrary to what that idiot above me (and many others) say, it is not that important for your school's program to be ABA (American Bar Association) approved. It's nice and all, but ultimately doesn't mean that much and is just something for the school to brag about a little and use to try and get more students. My school's program is not ABA approved and the director of the program gets more calls from employers requesting paralegals than he has students available to meet with the prospective employers. Experience is good too. I don't have any experience in the legal field as of yet, but part of the requirements of the program I'm in involves doing an internship, so something like that will give you experience. Don't worry, you won't have any problems getting a job!
e9c3e42d64ceb58add3e61412e049096aa	No, you cannot get that clue report.   Any insurer that subscribes to clue, isn't supposed to release the actual report to you.  THEY can see it, and ask you questions . . .  but they aren't supposed to give you a copy.
Y2VsqIO7aa	You took the college degree because you know you're good at it. But it's not what your heart truly desires. If you want to be a pilot, then plan on how you could achieve this dream. Your work experiences could be your advantage. Why not try working on the Air Force as a programmer or on any job related to your course and abilities? You might not be a pilot soon but at least you're near your dream of being in the air force. You'd know more about it. Do good and be your best while you're on the job. Then, if you gain enough money or get lucky enough for a scholarship then  pursue it.

Are you suggesting we rely on the government to take care of all our needs and assign our jobs? I think that's called Communism and it doesn't work. What's your plan for how this 'moneyless society' would work?<br>  <br>  Why are you making a point of identifying yourself as a mad white woman?

kGJND4lYaa	First,you are asking this in Taxes/Canada yet you mention "SS number" which means you are in the US.<br>  <br>  Second, you ARE NOT self-employed or a contractor as defined by tax law:<br>  <a href="http://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/article/0,,id=99921,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/arti...</a><br>  <br>  You earn wages, and as such should have taxes deducted from your paycheck. If your employer does not do this, he is responsible for paying taxes, social security, and medicare out of his own pocket.<br>  <br>  Whether he pays cash or not, he NEEDS to file a W-2 form for you and give you copies for you to file your tax return.<br>  <br>  Please understand that what you are doing is illegal and can cost you your citizenship. One of the criteria for citizenship is for "good moral character" in the 5 years preceeding the naturalization. Paying income taxes is most definitely part of "good moral character".<br>  <br>  That said, I do not believe USCIS has access to your tax records. I may be wrong. But why risk it all? If they catch you in a lie, it's game over for you.

VAI6MtPIaa	Try babysitting! Ask people around your neighborhood if they need a babysitter or people in your family that have children.     Also, writing to a company will almost ensure you won't get a job. Try going to the location and asking for a job application. Try McDonalds or something that you know will be easy to get into. You might not be able to work on the front-line but you could wash dishes.|`|EX1GjjJCaa	You're not even 16 yet. You need to enjoy your youth while you can.     Once you start working you're going to be working for the rest of your life.  Just remember that. You don't need to buy people birthday presents at your age. Get a card and call it good.    Best case scenario, work for a few months, save up a lot of money, and take your senior year off work wise.    I did that. I worked for a couple of months, saved up a few grand the beginning of my junior year, and took the next year and a half off.

Start modeling. Go on modeling web communities like modelmayhem.com or onemodelplace.com, set up a profile, and it's a good way to get some paid photoshoots.     You can start pet-sitting or baby-sitting.    Start by volunteering at a hospital and sometimes they'll hire you after 3-6 months.     Try applying at Restaurants that are kid-friendly and don't serve alcohol! Or amusement parks.     Fast food joints will hire ANYBODY. Go and apply there. I've had friends that worked at McDonald's and Burger King when they were 15-16 years old.     Also, cleaning houses for family/friends/neighbors. $25 per toilet ;) hehe|`|SRo6mw9Faa	black market.|`|nKosOzuVaa	Buy items from a thrift shop and sell them on eBay & Amazon. Offer to babysit for your parents friends & neighbors who have young children. Offer you services for a fee to help out family members (such as your grandparents) tell them you are looking to earn money and you wonder if they have any jobs could do. Look for a part time waitress job after school.|`|buUTakKAaa	why are you writing to multiple companies????    why don't you just go to the mall or somewhere and interview for a job?    much more can be done in person than through the internet or phone......|`|VjV7W6qLaa	survey spot  imboxdollars  or any other surveys|`|pZDiLVtwaa	I make 5 cents for ever email I read from inboxdollars.com.

The same with 16.  You will probably have to work part-time in fast-food or retail (WHICH IS NOTHING TO BE ASHAMED OF).  My RICH cousins (and I mean "rich"!) all worked at McDonald's as teens for the experience and to learn the value of a dollar.  There's no real way for a teen to make money without a job because they are too young to gamble and too young to invest in the stock market, lol!  You could do some odd jobs like babysitting, dog walking, and yard work or housecleaning.  Put some ads up.   Another suggestion is to sell some stuff that you don't want anymore or that you don't really need or use on e-bay!  You may have to be 18 to do that though so you may have to ask an older friend or relative to help you out with that.  The same goes with possibly advertising on "Craigs List" for babysitting and stuff.  Realistically, your best bet to make SURE THING money is just to work part-time (even if it's just 12 hrs. a week) at some place like McDonald's or do some babysitting (although it's usually weekend nights which I know teens hate!).  GOOD LUCK!|`|N55mlTaLaa	i understand your situation, as i one went through it too. well i guess, what you can try doing is to sell your unwanted items online?

Many people will pay to have their pets exercised. Ironing is another, we have had someone do our family ironing for twenty odd years, often it's a teenage girl.  Keep trying, you'll find a way.|`|CttXccd1aa	Some people here has given great ideas (and some other people have been utterly disgusting). I will summarize here alonside some of my own:    - Apply to McD or other similar companies Don't write to them, just go to the mall and ask to speak to the manager. Have your resum or at least a personal sata sheet ready to leave with them. If they haven't any vacancies, maybe they can direct you to someone who does.  - Let your family and friends know that you are looking for a job. Remind them at every occasion. Maybe some second uncle with a small company could do with an errand girl or needs a temp to help archive old papers.  - Sell your old/unwanted stuff on Ebay  - Ditto but do a garage sale  - Babysit/dogsit  - Walk dogs (a very popular job in my country, btw)  - Rake leaves or mow lawns  - Wash cars  - Sell Avon or some other brand - I did this at 16, I could not be an avonlady myself as a minor, but I sold for my best friend's mum, I got my commision and she had more units sold. (you will also get products cheaper, which you can use as birthday presents)  - Sign up for some online site that pays you for answering surveys or completing tasks. Try www.mturk.com, I did 12 bucks last month (but do not trust any such sites that require you to instal a program in your PC).  - Are you good at cooking? Bake cakes for kiddies b-days (or present your friends with a nice cake for theirs)  - Are you particularly good at one subject in school? Give remedial lessons to younger kids (you can advertise this at your school notice board)  - Are you good at English? offer to correct classmates reports.  - Help your mum/dad with some domestic task that they hate to do or that they're allways putting off for a small fee.   - Can you sew (knit/tat/etc.)? offer to do some minor mendings like shortening trousers. Also a handy skill for giving hand-made presents.    Naturally you can (and probably will have to) resort to more than one of these to make a decent amout. Remember not to take too much up though - school's first!|`|WEkdoJlLaa	prostitution, crime, stock market.  ...get a job.    EDIT: OR GET A LEMON STAND !!! LEMON STANDS will solve all your problems !!

qBCGH52haa	Since you already have the space and it sounds like very little additional needs to be done, creating your own business sounds like a good idea.  Things to look out for:    Zoning - since you will now be commercial, you will probably need a zoning variance.  There may be issues with parking, etc.  Check with the local zoning board.    Health/Sanitation - Not sure how far you want to go with this - are you just hosting the wedding or the reception also.  If you are doing the whole thing, you will need to be inspected for health (food service).  Also, think about the possibility of liquor service and the incumbent liability (serving a guest who later has a car accident).  Also bathrooms (you will probably need a certain amount per guest).    Of course you will need the requisite business licenses, possibly entertainment license, possible music license (royalties should be paid if music is used).    For some of this, you might want to partner with a few caterers who can set up that part of the occasion (take some of the burden off you).  Also, wedding planners are a good source of referrals.|`|0u6qy9Uuaa	you would have to check with local zoning laws|`|TpMvr1pyaa	go to the US small biz admin's web site. find a free [?] biz plan  and download it.    fill it in [change data as applicable]    within that you will build in writiing what is already in your mind!

0cd7030137d609db5865ec5a97d51d70aa	I entered the world of advertising because I enjoy writing. I saw advertising as a field where I could apply my creative aptitude in lots of different ways and learn about new things.    In my world, it's never the same day twice. One moment I will be working on a radio commercial for a dairy client, and the next I'm working on a direct mail campaign for a bank. So, there is a lot of variety in what I am doing and what I am learning about.    Working in my field has also provided me the opportunity to travel. My production schedules have taken me to New York, Chicago, LA and most other major cities in the country. (In fact, I've been to every city with either a Major League Baseball or NFL team.)    My career choice has also provided me a very comfortable standard of living. I am good at what I do and earn a nice income on account of it.    I take pride in my work. Working in advertising is not about making up lies in order to get someone to buy a product or service. It's about empowering consumers to make thoughtful, intelligent purchasing decisions. Of course, in order to do that, you first have to get their attention, and that's where the challenge of being a creative person comes in. And it is because of THAT challenge that I most love my job.
f01ff94a2400891b63aaf4d21aa2eff6aa	Under the Income Tax Act, a HUF is treated as a separate entity for the purpose of assessment.  Since the HUF is a separate entity, it can earn income from all the income heads except income from salary.   The HUF can claim Rs 1,00,000 deduction under Section 80C, when it files its ITR.    You can also claim Rs 1,00,000 deduction under Section 80C, when you file your ITR as an individual to declare your income.|`|pzMhpsDeaa	Hi,    I was looking into my insurance a couple of months ago.
