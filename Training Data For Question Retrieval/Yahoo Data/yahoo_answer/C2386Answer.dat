7ZX3Ibz4aa	1.  Fort Whoop-Up was the nickname given to a whiskey trading post, officially Fort Hamilton, near what is now Lethbridge, Alberta    2.  Major General Sir Samuel Benfield Steele,  (5 January 1849  30 January 1919) was a distinguished soldier and famous member of the North-West Mounted Police.  He came from a military background and joined the militia.  In 1873 he became the thrid person sworn in to the newly formed NWMP.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Steele  This is the site that shows all of his contributions during his time in the NWMP    3.Whoop-it-up is derived from what was known as "Fort Whoop-Up" (officially known as Fort Hamilton in Alberta, Canada), which received this nickname because it was a whiskey trading post in the late 1800s. Although the sale of whiskey was then outlawed, Fort Hamilton had "whoop-up bandits" who sold "whoop-up bug juice," a highly prized alcohol spiked with ginger, molasses, red pepper and colored with black chewing tobacco. The hangovers must have been horrific.     Macleod and Colonel French are too vague to answer.  Not sure what you are looking for.    Good luck.|`|v0GwTTsVaa	Fort Whoop-Up was the nickname given to a whiskey trading post, officially Fort Hamilton, near what is now Lethbridge, Alberta.

1UsdeqwRaa	Brunel Uni being in London will mean a lot of expense.  Living and socialising in the London area is VERY costly.  Great for theatres, etc, but costly!    Exeter Uni is a good Uni, living in the area is not nearly as expensive.  There are a lot of places to visit and explore Dartmoor, Exmoor, places in Devon and Cornwall, surfing.    Exeter also offers a lot of support for student from other countries, whereas in London you can be seen as just another "tourist".    As far as educational levels, go online and compare their prospectuses.|`|1b40b411fde105efac034d33b5f3fdeeaa	I would recommend Exeter Uni, and its not true that there are no shops/night life etc.  why not visit both unis open days and see what you think?|`|xR0tvF02aa	ha brunel ? Thats laughable. brunel is the most obvious uni in the whole london it is known for its hardcore party nights. I know lots of people that go brunel and they are always those bait people (faces that you keep seeing around) that live in east or south london. Its not a bad uni but it is very lively as most of the students spend their live going out rather than lectures. btw there are loads of black ppl there.( im black myslv so no 1 say im being racist) However exeter is a gr8 uni .

O4oCqaKkaa	Precipitation starts in the cloud as snow. As it falls, it may travel through a layer of air that has a temperature greater than 32 F (0 C). This layer melts the snow into rain. If the temperature at ground level is below freezing, then the water may refreeze in the air, and we get sleet. Or, if the layer of sub-freezing air at ground level is thin, the precipitation falls as rain but then freezes once it touches a freezing object on the ground.|`|262016589c2b056459386b15672dd2c8aa	33 to 36 degrees.|`|4kglXFzLaa	Though no "official" criteria exist for the term, it is not used when any accumulation of snow on the ground takes place. It is often used when the temperature of the ground surface is above 0C , preventing accumulation from occurring even if the air temperature is marginally below 0 C; but even then the falling precipitation must generally be something other than consisting exclusively of snow.    So the answer your looking for is roughly 0C or 32F, but not really useful.
Iwk92vqyaa	My take on it:    'As is - At this time the views and knowledge of experts at GE C&I have no platform. There is no catch-and-share of such resources, leaving them volatile. Knowledge is not well-defined or documented. References are needed.'    'Desired - A new concept, to provide controlled and increased, well maintained knowledge sharing. It can be a resource used by all. Such shared knowledge can be stored and so made available to other users in the long run.'     [Actually, what you have here isn't bad. I only tried to take out any repetition. Am not sure whether you wanted 'As Is' AND 'Desired' or just the second one.]    If you want them combined, perhaps:    'Currently the knowledge and views of experts at GE C&I are volatile. The process of shared knowledge and references for it are not well-defined or documented. What is needed is provision of a shared, controlled and maintained platform for them. Shared knowledge can be stored and made available for other users. It can be a great repository for reference in the long run.'

2646a4e9d6d4e936660d70ff922397f3aa	Most majors require some math, it is just a matter of what the focus of the math will be.  Most UCs (other than Berkeley, Riverside, and this year for the first time, Irvine) don't offer undergraduate business at all.      I've been a business faculty member for 30 years and am now a business school Dean.  Yes, you will need some math in business (and a little in your economics classes), but it is not tremendously hard math.  The most you will need will be basic calculus, and if the highest you can handle now is algebra2, you can take that, after which you will be able to handle calculus.  Don't assume you can't do it; you just need the tools with which to do it.  One of the joys of learning is finding that you can do something which you never realized you could do.  You need to try to be able to do that.    I do notice one thing, though.  You are talking about getting into MBA programs.  If you already plan to get an MBA, why study business as an undergrad student too?  The MBA is really designed for students who studied something else as an undergrad (although it is probably easier if you did something with a technical element to it, because otherwise the math required for the MBA (usually calculus is a prerequisite) will be even harder for you 8 or 9 years from now, when you have forgotten everything you learned in high school!

TY6Geyjkaa	Two answers-  For the worrying - yes you overworry. You need to see a counselor, psychologist, or therapist for this or it will affect you the rest of your life. If you are a goal oriented person (and you sound like it, in spite of the dwelling), then take concrete action to overcome this challenge. If you really do feel like hurting yourself, call a help line. That's what they are there for. Don't feel bad - you're sure not the only person that feels this way. 1800 (784-2433) is one line you can call.    For the grade - make your plan. Talk to the instructor and ask him or her what you can do to improve your grade. Find out exactly what the test material or assignments that you need to study will be. Most schools have free or low cost tutoring services, so go there also.     Also, if you have a church or religion, this may also be a good time to reaffirm your faith. And either way, remember - it's the times of challenge in our lives that show our character. You can do it.

Its a realization to bring our society into the golden successive world. In that case, most of us do not have this characters that need to be grown internally. Most of us have enough time to manage our own life. But them, willing to sacrifice anything to make their dreams into reality. For that we need to salute them.

4ab2ea36c0069d71d94055356c32ea00aa	If your PC is shutting down, it could be a few things.    First thing I would do is check to make sure your computer has enough ventilation.  Is it in a place where it can dispense of heat easily?  Many computers simply overheat if they're in a bad spot and the fans are not working properly (something else to check).  When they're close to overheating, they shut off rather than overheat.    Next thing to do is run both a virus scan and an malware scan.  The best malware scan I have seen is Spybot's Search and Destroy.  You can google it and find it.    If everything there checks out, you'll want to open the computer and see if anything is loose.  I recently opened up a computer at work that was having the same problem and it was simply that the RAM was not secure.  Do this only if you know what you're doing.  You don't want to fry the motherboard.    If that all seems OK, it's likely a hardware problem.  You'd have to diagnose what hardware is bad.  This can be done more effectively by someone who has more computer knowledge.|`|ugRN86bYaa	Maybe it has a virus. You need to post this question in the pc section.

on6dC4A8aa	It doesn't pay very much considering all the work that must be done outside of school & teacher's own money that must be spent--I'm a teacher and have to buy supplies out of my own pocket (supplies for science experiments, classroom decorations, art supplies, etc), along with constantly contributing for pizza parties, ice cream parties, end-of-year-presents for the students, etc. (I work at a private school and teachers are also required to drive on field trips and pay for their own gas, parking, and the cost of admission!).      Especially in the field of science and math, people with those skills can make a lot more money in other professions.    And people don't really factor in how time-consuming the job is--your work hours are not confined to just the school day.  There is a LOT of paperwork that has to be done outside of school (at schools where I've taught, teachers end up spending their planning bells in parent conferences and subbing for other teachers who are absent). Most teachers stay after school a lot for tutoring or detentions. And teachers don't really get summers off because I've always spent mine taking more classes or attending seminars. You don't really even get a lunch break because you're monitoring the students in the cafeteria.  You also have to be super-careful about your behavior and the way you dress even outside of work because you are setting an example and never know who you're going to run into.    And to top it all off, you are held accountable for all students' test scores--I do think there should be accountability for teachers, but there are too many variables there...if there is no motivation/support coming from the student's home environment, there's not always a lot you can do for EVERY student...you can lead a horse to water, but students should bear SOME responsibility for their own test scores, too. AND if you get a 7th grade student who is on a 2nd grade reading level, you can get them to make a lot of progress, but they're not necessarily going to instantly go up to a 7th grade reading level in one year, no matter how much time you spend with them.    I may sound bitter--don't get me wrong, I LOVE being in the classroom and actually teaching, and having a positive impact on students' lives. But there is a lot of other BS that goes along with it that I could do without...for some people, it's just not worth it.|`|ssK4oJi9aa	primary and secondary school teaching involves more work, more administrative procedural grunt work, more stress, and less pay than teaching in colleges and universities where there is less work, less oversight, less accountability, and mucho dinero.|`|y39iNwFjaa	Because it's an impossible job to do well due to the indiscipline in schools nowadays.

I also have worked in many districts and some of them have treated me very poorly, there is no way I would stay in a school/district like that because there are many others just a short drive away.  I work in a county that pays me half, yes half!! of what the county next to me pays.  I worked in that other county for 3 years. They treated me nice and I loved it...but the drive was killing me.  For every 8 days of work I was in my car for 24 hours.  So I switched back....but not to the county I came from orig. because they had been cruel to me.

In the districts which are recognized for high achievement year after year, there's no shortage of highly qualified applicants.    What's different about those districts? Most have few impoverished students but are middle class or above. Most are either highly homogenous or quite mixed in terms of race and ethnicity, no middle ground. Most of the students come from homes where education is valued; in fact, many people in the district live there precisely because of the good schools, even though they could live better in nearby communities. And last, they seriously pay, even at entry level.|`|TqWXXZ34aa	Doing well in school does NOT reflect one's ability in the classroom.  Teachers are born, not made.    Hiring procedures favor one's attractiveness, ability to throw together a good portfolio, and impress.  Again, all of that has nothing to do with teaching.  Teaching has more to do with managing and inspiring children (of any age) to pay attention, and be interested in the material.  Learning must be fun.  No child (any age) can learn without listening.  Getting them to be quiet is where most fail.  I've seen all kinds of scholarly teachers teach a class with absolutely no one listening.  I've seen kids play with games in their laps, talk/text on cellphones, send notes, draw, etc..  Administrators aren't knowlegable themselves about classroom management, or the material taught- they tend to favor those who are young, attractive, and pleasing to their requests.    There are few rewards, especially for not doing it well, and so the cycle continues....on and on.  Poor teachers, few learners, who then enter the workforce and can't read or write.  It's one of the most difficult, complicated, mind-boggling, underpaid jobs on the planet.|`|noS6QxSAaa	PAY!!!!!  When people learn that paying teachers low salaries isn't helping anything, maybe we will be able to get some good teachers in high school and below.  A second thing is the support of principals, etc. in discipline, students these days are so.......I can't even think of a word for it, but we have students jumping on teachers and seriously hurting and injuring them.  Teachers need more support in everything when it comes to salary, money for their classrooms, and having the   support/backup from faculty, staff, and personnel.   Higher education/university teachers pay is a lot more and they do not have to put up with unorderly students on top of the fact university students are more motivated because they are paying and they are more mature and older.  This problem really is an EPIDEMIC, sadly. I know so many who would make good teachers refuse to do it because of all of the reasons stated, I even had a change of heart for a while.  Hope this answers your question...........in our communities we should all come together to help solve these problems, every little bit counts!|`|89410198c6ea3e47643711774dc3a670aa	Probably a combination of low pay, long hours and no respect from students and parents makes it difficult to retain good teachers.
W3CEYkebaa	Most schools have an attendance policy. If you miss so many days out of the class, the teacher and school can in some cases kick you out of your classes, and remove any federal or state aid that your received.  Also, for some federal aids, you might have to pay it back.    However, I think all schools do have exemption guidelines for unusual or extreme circumstances such as family illness. What you would need to do is go talk to your advisor/counselors for admissions and financial aid  and do an appeal. During that appeal, make sure you discuss your current family issue. Sometimes, they require documents such as notarized statements from knowing indivuduals such as the doctor, lawyer, etc. Or ask for you to bring in medical bills to support the claim.     However, depending on how many days you missed, and how many times a week that class is schedule, it might be too late to even catch up. So way your optoins and talk with your school.
FmYkUfIDaa	Hi,  Clearly the fact that you have an Exam on Monday matters little to you and you just can't motivate yourself to put in some study-time.    When we have a choice to do something or to do nothing, and we choose the latter, we have made a choice and must be prepared to accept the consequences.    I'm just wondering how it would be if your Mom made a similar type of statement such as: "I cannot find myself cooking any meals today."    In life, there will be days when many people feel as you do, however, when the going gets tough, the tough get going. Like a journey of a thousand miles, it all begins with the first step.     Your first step is to say, "I need to do this for me."    You really need to get real because the study you should be doing is not for someone else, it is for your benefit and another building block in your future.    Just place a sign above your study area - "I am doing this work as an investment in my future." Perhaps you can think of something more positive yourself.    You are worth the effort - aren't you?|`|SkyCof72aa	study with someone, that's the best cure|`|NJMGZ6TRaa	are you a private candidate?

KPHZmcQuaa	Well, first I'd argue that there's more than one standard involved in the transmission of a digital signal.  The FCC has broadband jurisdiction over satellite broadcasts and eCommerce regulations.  Ever since the inception of the Office of Homeland Security, which falls under the legislative authority of the FCC anything that poses even a remote threat to National Security can be de-privatized.    About the GSM standardization:  I'm sure you're right about the standards certification over the *equipment*, but an FCC license is required for all GMS Transmission *providers*, and provider standards are revocable under FCC regulations. Only transmissions that that fall under an ISM bands (Industrial Scientific Medical) are exempt.   Since GMS service contracts typically extend for 5 years of less, every renewal becomes automatically subject to FCC regulatory control. How this is actually quantified, let alone implemented I have no clue. But as I said, everything changed after 9/11 and the OHS was formed, and of the God knows how many 3am drunken slurs against Bush I've made in the past year have been caught in the filters on somebody's site scraper.       Anyway, to get back to your question, a homologation can regulate both land, space and frequency, even if it's powerless to enforce them.  Look an Microsoft & the WC3.  I still can't make a hello world web page look the same in IE & Firefox, and forget about Safari.      However, this does not dispute your issue with Wiktionary's definition; in no way would I ever attest to any internet based reference, let alone one that allows its users to flag & edit anything they disagree with.      But thank God, for *that*, eh?    Cheers!  ~e

uO7Yd0Vgaa	You already memorized the periodic table, right? H, He, Li, Be, B, C, N, O, F, etc.    For each element in the series you add another proton, and also and a neutron or two, more or less. The varying number of neutrons give rise to isotopes, only some of which are stable. In an un-ionized atom there are the same number of electrons as protons.    The mass number is the sum of protons and neutrons.    The shells are 2, 8,  etc. For Li, two electrons are in the innermost shell. Additional electrons are in the next shell.     All that stuff is in your textbook. Notice how I've not given you the full answer.    There is a lot more interesting stuff to learn about Li. What happens if you drop it in water? And how is it used in medicine? What is its density? Is it the least-dense metal? The least-dense solid? Is it poisonous?|`|VRZ3tcEBaa	i did this in school and it took me ages to pick it up i cant really remember much but i know that when you arrange the electrons into shells each layer can only have so many electrons in each layer and the most you can have in one layer is 8|`|60088dbbb7ee04713c7034a097e0f69baa	1. 7    2.

Protons and neutrons weigh roughly 1 amu. electrons you can assume have no mass since its so small.      The   of protons an atom has is equal to its atomic number.    1] If a lithium atom weighs 7 it'd have 4 neutrons.      7-3(lithium's atomic number) = 4    2] Since there are 3 protons there are 3 electrons to neutralize the charge.   The first shell can accommodate 2 electrons.  So the first shell would be filled and it'd have 1 electron in the next shell.

oREeytpfaa	Physical Hazards, and their Adverse Health Effects  Although you will have heard or read a great deal about the environmental consequences of global warming, man will probably be affected through famine, or war long before the health of the population as a whole is harmed to a serious degree by the temperature change. However increasing extremes of temperature, as a result of climatic change, could result in increased mortality even in temperate climates.    Important issues concerning physical hazards include those relating to health effects of electromagnetic radiation and ionising radiation. If one excludes the occupational environment, then noise and other physical hazards may present a nuisance to many inhabitants, and impair general well being. Environmental noise does not usually contribute to deafness but notable exceptions may include noisy discotheques and "personal stereos".      Electromagnetic radiation ranges from low frequency,relatively low energy, radiation such as radio and microwaves through to infra red, visible light, ultraviolet, X-rays and gamma rays. These last as well as other forms of radioactivity such as high energy subatomic particles (e.g. electrons - Beta rays) can cause intracellular ionisation and are therefore called ionising radiation. Exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation carries a increased risk of skin cancer such as melanoma, and of cataracts which are to an extent exposure related. Some pollutants such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) used as refrigerants or in aerosol propellants or in the manufacture of certain plastics can damage the "ozone layer" in the higher atmosphere (stratosphere) and thus allow more UV light to reach us, and harm us directly. Ultraviolet light may also cause harm indirectly by contributing to an increase in ozone in the troposphere (the air we breathe) - see below under chemical hazards, or elsewhere in connection with air quality.      Radioactivity is associated with an exposure dependent risk of some cancers notably leukaemia. Contrary to popular belief however, most radiation to which the average person is exposed is natural in origin, and, of the man made sources, medical diagnosis and treatment is on average the largest source to the individual. A very important issue is the extent to which radon gas arising from certain rock types beneath dwellings can contribute to cancer risk. According to some estimates it could result in a few thousand cancer deaths per year in the U.K. (but still probably less than one twentieth of the cancer deaths alone caused by tobacco smoking).      Ionising radiation from the nuclear industry and from fallout from detonations contributes less than 1% of the annual average dose to inhabitants of the U.K. The explanation for leukaemia clusters around nuclear power plants is not yet resolved. Similar clustering can occur in other parts of the country. The effect of viral infections associated with population shifts may be important but requires further study.      Non ionising electrical, magnetic or electromagnetic fields are an increasing focus of attention. The scientific evidence of adverse health effects from general environmental exposure to these fields is "not proven". If there are adverse effects yet to be proven, the risk is probably likely to be very small.           --------------------------------------...    Chemical Hazards, and their Adverse Health Effects  If one includes tobacco smoke as an environmental hazard then it probably represents the single biggest known airborne chemical risk to health, whether measured in terms of death rates or ill-health (from lung cancer, other lung disease such as chronic bronchitis and emphysema, and disease of the heart, especially, and of blood vessels and other parts of the body). To a much lesser degree of risk, these adverse effects apply to non-smokers exposed passively to sidestream tobacco smoke.    General airborne pollution arises from a variety of causes but can usefully be subdivided into pollution from combustion or from other sources. The image shows the silhouette of a power station - an important source of airborne products of combustion.      Combustion of coal and other solid fuels can produce smoke (containing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons - PAH) and sulphur dioxide besides other agents such as those also produced by:      Combustion of liquid petroleum products which can generate carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen and other agents. Industry and incineration can generate a wide range of products of combustion such as oxides of sulphur and nitrogen, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, dioxins etc. Combustion of any fossil fuel generates varying amounts of particulate matter. It also adds to the environmental burden of carbon dioxide - an important "green house" gas but in these low concentrations it does not affect human health directly. Combustion of fuel can also generate hazardous substances in other

HBK9aIhxaa	The differences between viruses and bacteria are numerous. Viruses are the smallest and simplest life form known. They are 10 to 100 times smaller than bacteria. The biggest difference between viruses and bacteria is that viruses must have a living host - like a plant or animal - to multiply, while most bacteria can grow on non-living surfaces.    Also, unlike bacteria, which attack the body like soldiers mounting a pitched battle, viruses are guerilla fighters. They don't attack so much as infiltrate. They literally invade human cells and turn the cell's genetic material from its normal function to producing the virus itself.    In addition, bacteria carry all the machinery needed for their growth and multiplication, while viruses carry mainly information - for example, DNA or RNA, packaged in a protein and/or membranous coat. Viruses harness the host cell's machinery to reproduce. In a sense, viruses are not truly "living," but are essentially information (DNA or RNA) that float around until they encounter a suitable living host.|`|y39iNwFjaa	a bacterial infection can be treated by anti-biotics a viral one can't  What are viruses?     Viruses are too small to be seen by the naked eye. They can't multiply on their own, so they have to invade a 'host' cell and take over its machinery in order to be able to make more virus particles.     Viruses consist of genetic materials (DNA or RNA) surrounded by a protective coat of protein. They are capable of latching onto cells and getting inside them.     The cells of the mucous membranes, such as those lining the respiratory passages that we breathe through, are particularly open to virus attacks because they are not covered by protective skin.     What are bacteria?     Bacteria are organisms made up of just one cell. They are capable of multiplying by themselves, as they have the power to divide. Their shapes vary, and doctors use these characteristics to separate them into groups.     Bacteria exist everywhere, inside and on our bodies. Most of them are completely harmless and some of them are very useful. But some bacteria can cause diseases, either because they end up in the wrong place in the body, or simply because they are 'designed' to invade us.|`|3d1XRIzkaa	The difference is the method of reproduction.

CfjxKLHDaa	From Wikipedia:    Money is anything that is generally accepted as payment for goods and services and repayment of debts.  The main uses of money are as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, and a store of value.  Some authors explicitly require money to be a standard of deferred payment. The dominant form of money is currency.    Money is used as an intermediary for trade, in order to avoid the inefficiencies of a barter system, which are sometimes referred to as the 'double coincidence of wants problem'. Such usage is termed a medium of exchange.    I hope this helps.|`|bibIAhN9aa	do you mean the functions of money?

The reason is that graduate schools get their reputations in part from the diversity of their student bodies - a top school will have students from the best universities all over the world, while a lesser school may have to rely on its own graduates to get students.  Furthermore, it is likely that more Rutgers students would apply to Rutgers than would students from another school, lowering the odds that any one Rutgers student would get in.  Rutgers would rather put together a class consisting of one Rutgers graduate, one Harvard Graduate, and one Vanderbilt graduate than one consisting of three Rutgers graduates.

2d645e9d5ec6fa2246e37423933cedb5aa	I think this is how you do it. I haven't done these types of equations in a long time.<br>  <br>  First you need to take the first equation and get Y by itself.<br>  <br>  2x + y = -92<br>  -2x          -2x<br>  y= -92 - 2x<br>  <br>  Then put that answer for y info y in the second equation.<br>  <br>  2x + 2 (-92 - 2x) = -98<br>  2x - 184 -4x = -98<br>         +184           +184<br>  2x - 4x = 86<br>  -2x = 86<br>  /-2        /-2<br>  x=-43<br>  <br>  Then to figure out what y is you can put in the vaule of x and figure out what y is. Either equation will work, I am using the first equation.<br>  <br>  2(-43) + y = -92<br>  -86 + y = -92<br>  +86          +86<br>  y= -6<br>  <br>  So the answers should be Y=-6 and X=-43|`|68190623a60d4531a0091e470f89e242aa	To use the substitution method, you want to isolate one of the variables in one of the equations.  Looks like it will be easiest to isolate y in the first equation.  Subtract 2x from each side and you get:<br>  y= -2x - 92<br>  Use that to replace the y in the second equation:<br>  2x + 2(-2x-92) = -98<br>  <br>  Now it is easy to solve this equation for x.|`|15978cdbaf5d1aae0aed5ddf64616646aa	y=6<br>  x=43|`|35715861e0f1a32354dd2b2335141bfeaa	So you have:<br>  2x+y=-92<br>  2x+2y=-98<br>  <br>  so if you solve the first for y=-2x-92 then you can plug that into the second equation to make it 2x + 2(-2x-92)=-98<br>  <br>  so -2x-184=-98<br>  -2x=86<br>  x=-43<br>  y=-6|`|883b83bd29ad4747fc3f8f596d104b19aa	y=92-2x<br>  <br>  so<br>  2x-4x+2(92)=-98<br>  <br>  you can put it in a calculator from there|`|9525dbe15da78e07eab6afa1082d99c4aa	Just pick either variable and solve for it (for example, y in the top problem):<br>  y=2x-92<br>  Then you substitute it for the Y in the other problem (being careful to distribute what's in parenthesis before anything else):<br>  2x+2(2x-92)=-98|`|981b77a0cc5f0a733c4bee4f16177936aa	Solve either equation for one of the variables (I suggest solving the first equation for y).

AA11770802	Public Law 107 -110, which is more commonly known as "No Child Left Behind" is a law that President Bush put into effect in 2001 that states that all states have to make standards and then test their children to make sure that they are learning those standards. The law also states that each year, more and more children have to pass the tests, until in 2014 when ALL children will be passing. Every year that schools dont raise the number of students who pass the tests in all of 48 different subgroups, the school is labeled as "failing" and will be greatly penalized.    For most people the name of the law, and the idea that all children are expected to pass the tests sounds like a wonderful idea. In reality there are good things that are part of the law, but they are either overshadowed by the bad things, or the way the the law is implemented. For example, part of the law is mandatory help for children who are not on grade level. Access to remedial tutoring is mandatory for children who are not making the grade. That is a good point. Sadly, the law doesnt allow for the funds and time to do this, so many schools are now taking time out of their day to have the teachers teach the tutoring classes, which means that now there is less time for the teachers to teach the core curriculum. Subjects like history, science, social studies and geography which aren't tested have all but disappeared from most schools.    Whats even more frustrating is that the more a school fails, the more sanctions are placed on it. You will hear some people state that failing schools get money thrown at them and it may appear as that to the outside eye, but in reality it is a curse, not a blessing. You see that money comes with ridiculously strong ties. Failing schools are forced to use scripted programs. The extra money they receive is only for these programs and for people to ensure that the program is being followed exactly. What's worse, that the programs are "normed" in middle class all white schools. They don't take into account the special needs of low income, second language, minority students who are the ones primarily in the "failing" schools.    You might say to yourself, Well, if the school is failing, who cares about their ethnic background, it is because the teachers dont know how to teach and so giving them a script to follow will ensure that some form of decent education is getting to the children. I would agree, if that was truly the case, but you see there are many reasons why schools are failing and often it has more to do with problems outside the school than inside.    Now before you write me off as someone who is just making excuses, I need to state that I do believe that most, if not all, children can learn. The problem is that they are different, and have different needs. As a teacher I need to be able to adapt my curriculum for those needs. For example, I teach in an extremely poor area. Many of my children do not have beds. They dont even have mattresses or pajamas. So when we read a story about a child putting on his pajamas and going to bed, unless I pre-teach, (go over what a bed and pajamas are befor reading the text), my students wont understand the story. Yet the scripted program does not allow for this. If I am pre-teaching and one of the coaches comes into my classroom, I will be written up for non-compliance with the core curriculum.    I could go on, but YA won't let me. They keep on cutting off my posts, so let me conclude with this...    The bottom line is that yes we do need to make sure that all our children are learning to the highest degree possible, but NCLB is not the way to do it.|`|tDZMJue9aa	it can be a bad thing..as a parent of two kids one in middle school the other a high school senior, this is my take on the entire deal. most states  now have a test you have to pass for specific grades..like 8th to go to 9th...now that sounds ok...but in reality the teachers teach specific things on that test all year long the entire year is in preparation of that test therefore there are a lot of things that never get taught, the reason teachers do this is . if too many kids fail the school and the teacher get a  bad report. so basically what this means is  you  have kids that may know all about africa and not a damn thing about the geography of the united states because that years test may be about africa...|`|TdIbrGYYaa	It's all a financial thing.  Nothing, I don't think will happen with the program.

Like, cutting school hours, lowering teachers pay... Like they are paid alot anyways, and reducing class and merging more students into one class.  With the Children Left Behind program it's all about the financial ring same as with the schools.  Try not to worry until we know for sure and then we will have to all go and kick some butt with our congress and City officials and make out points.  Ugh.... like the economy isn't bad enough and then they have to go and mess with our kids and their futures.  Nothing makes me more mad.

Being that you did not yet finish your High School work, I can certainly see your Mom's reasoning.    As a professor, I can also see where a usual 16 year old is too immature to have in the class. (And from how you are saying school is boring, it sounds like you are one of them).    It is, ultimately, an issue of whether or not you will benefit from the advanced classes you will be taking. If you are not prepared and developed enough to take them, it's just a waste of time.    Plus, college courses offer much more independence and require work. That work may interfere with your High School work and you might not do quite as well.    I guess you could take a course or two and see if it all works for you. But it would be a much smarter idea to put more effort into your HS classes, and take AP classes instead.|`|RuHB2Jxoaa	you should have your confidence to gain a good experience.  there is no problem as you are 16yrs old and want to goto   community college.

Its just like going to high school, just in a different building for half of the day.     Plus, its the best jumpstart to get into college once you graduate from high school. You'll already have some college, so you won't have to take those courses over, which really helps financially.    However, if your mom really doesn't want you go to, you could take some AP courses instead. These are college courses that you take in high school.|`|TqWXXZ34aa	Do it.

I think in a health profession not being able to communicate well is a problem as people who are ill, are in pain and need someone easy to communicate with.    Maybe you should to a communications course, then apply for the health course after that.    However I would take advice before starting a course, as you might be wasting your time, they need to see you as "fit and suitable for the profession" so no matter what grades you get you might be wasting your time, if they see you as not suitable.  You could ask for the criteria for admission to courses and then maybe ask someone in recruitment that specialises in the health sector about your situation, you don't want to do all your studies then find no one will employ you.    On the other hand, a hospice or hospital for people with similar problems to you that you have overcome, might be delighted to employ you.    I would do some serious research and ask people.  Ask them if you can quote them or use them as a reference to back up your side.    Good luck.  Oh and see every knock back as an opportunity this might lead to you getting so into your rights that you study law and it would pay more !! or something.

(give a short data bit here on how many people are considered to be homeless in (whatever country) and what it means to be "homeless".  Then, proceed by indicating precisely what your coalition will do to end homelessness, such as:  * More access to health care.  * More access to education.  * Decreased risk of suffering from violence and abuse.  * More programs to increase suitability for employment.  * More access to banking services to save money.  * More access to communications technology, such as  telephones and the internet.    These are only guidelines and suggestions, certainly you can tweak it a little to suit your needs.      Good luck!|`|YoZZDqq9aa	Thank you all for showing how much you care by coming tonight.

But if you're asking about negative love, it could be obsessive love, like a stalker or an abusive person would have towards someone.  I also believe in 'tough love' so a love that controls the other in hopes of saving them from themselves and/or from making wrong choices would be the opposite of tough love in my opinion.|`|X4mOkDrTaa	- I love yoiu|`|03197d0adb4db1884913abddeebcc5c8aa	The answer is "I do not love you."    There are many alternatives to the verb "To love" of which "Hate" is only one. Love is only a description of a feeling  Other feelings that come to mind include "Admire, Loath, Adore, Despise, etc.."  To chose "Hate" or another word instead of "Love" only replaces it with a word for a different feeling.    The opposite of "To love" is "Not to love" or " To not love."    Likewise, the opposite of "In" is  not "OUT."   The opposite of "IN" is "Not in."   Etc., etc..|`|p2RS6nzxaa	the answer is "i dont hate you"|`|uTtwiEcLaa	Actually the negative form is when you say "I love you" but yet you don't have enough courage to fight for it, in this case "I love you" itself becomes the worst form, which hurts forever if you really are not strong enough to move on.|`|856f7a83dce6d6abc2fa9644cb8e19beaa	"I don't care."

Find the academic honesty policy at your University, print it out, and tell your friend no, if they get pissy, show them the policy so they can see what'll happen if you get caught cheating. Seriously you don't wanna do that.    Here's an exert of the honesty policy at my school:    "...If the student is found in violation of the Honesty Code and the penalty is anything except suspension or expulsion, the form does not become a part of the student's permanent record or transcript. Instead, it is retained by the Dean of Students.    If the student is found in violation of the Honesty Code and the penalty is suspension or expulsion, the record becomes part of the student's permanent academic file and the notation of "Disciplinary Suspension" or "Disciplinary Expulsion" is placed on the transcript. In the case of suspension, the notation will be removed at the conclusion of the specified suspension period at the written request of the student. In the case of expulsion, the entry is noted permanently...."

Before you go on with your plans, take a little time to think what you will do with music in terms of a career. Are you going to absolutely love playing in a symphony for a living? Are you willing to put up with the hardships of auditions and job seeking? Find out about the kinds of competition you will face.     I am not trying to rain on your parade or anything, but I know that the music business is hard and competitive. You have to be truly talented, have passion for music and the determination to succeed. You have to understand that it isn't just music, but a career you are discussing.|`|oQrnizuwaa	yes, definately. if you want to do it then  go ahead   good luck :)|`|cRYEID18aa	You can achieve whatever you want in life all you have to do is put your mind to it.|`|cC9KqQrAaa	dont give up on anything you want to do. the important thing is that you have something that you are passionate about.

EBrgRBT3aa	Please refer to the link below for further info on alloys:    Introduction    Sci-Tech Encyclopedia: Alloy    A metal product containing two or more elements (1) as a solid solution, (2) as an intermetallic compound, or (3) as a mixture of metallic phases. Alloys are frequently described on the basis of their technical applications. They may also be categorized and described on the basis of compositional groups. For example, See also Beryllium alloys; Iron alloys.    Except for native copper and gold, the first metals of technological importance were alloys. Bronze, an alloy of copper and tin, is appreciably harder than copper. This quality made bronze so important an alloy that it left a permanent imprint on the civilization of several millennia ago now known as the Bronze Age. Today the tens of thousands of alloys involve almost every metallic element of the periodic table.    Alloys are used because they have specific properties or production characteristics that are more attractive than those of the pure, elemental metals. For example, some alloys possess high strength; others have low melting points; others are refractory with high melting temperatures; some are especially resistant to corrosion; and others have desirable magnetic, thermal, or electrical properties. These characteristics arise from both the internal and the electronic structure of the alloy. An alloy is usually harder than a pure metal and may have a much lower conductivity.    ANSWER|`|f01jXc8naa	When two or more metals are mixed together when they are in liquid state (melted), the outcome is called an Alloy!        Brass is an alloy of silver and copper  Tin is an alloy of iron and zinc  Lead is an alloy of brass and tin    They are all used for different purposes

Check it out.|`|JTRVVzhXaa	Asking what the Wall means is like asking for a brief explanation of what makes Hamlet a brilliant play. It's possible to summarize the work in one sentence, but the true meaning lies in the depth and complexities of the work.    The short answer: sit back, relax and listen to the album.    The shorter longer answer: the Wall is about the golden mean and realizing that what you do affects others just as much as the things that are done to you; it's about being an individual but not to the point of personal and social alienation; it's about how a person can be so consumed with hatred that he becomes the very thing he hates; it's about the danger of making gods of men; it's about the importance of communication, the void of excess, the fullness of the little moments; and above all, it's about personal, communal and social responsibility.

My guess is that you could easily get admitted to a Masters' degree program on the strength of your undergraduate degree, since you would require one to be admitted to one of their Post Graduate Diploma programs. Whether completion of the aforementioned PG Diploma in question will yield you any credit towards your Masters' degree is something that can be best answered by a career counselor at Cavendish College who would hopefully also help you with the exact amount of credit that would transfer, if any.

It seems pointless to make a class a requirement, and then don't provide it to the students at least once a year.    However, if you mean do they have to offer at the main campus? No, they do not.  At the college I went to, they have different campuses spread out in a 60 mile radius. So while most of the classes are offered on the main campus, some required classes were only offered in the neighboring campus. Which sometimes makes sense because for some majors, better enviroment to learn might be the next county over.

But you might want to include this on your Statement of Purpose(SoP) so that you wouldn't have to face any embarrassing questions on this issue during the personal interview, if any.    MBAs do that all the time, I mean go back to school to learn more, but they join for one of those accelerated management development programmes(MDP) for working executives which can hopefully be completed in about 6 months as opposed to one year for a regular, full-time MBA, which I believe would be the standard duration for a foreign B-school MBA programme.|`|6HyIkR7Caa	You can always apply for MBA or management program abroad even after completing your MBA from India. there is a link http://www.gei-india.com/ for Global education initiatives India. they will be able to help you with all your queries. contact them all the best..|`|W3CEYkebaa	From reading the gmat website, looks like it's a global test.

Aenp9qUEaa	Figurative Language  Whenever you describe something by comparing it with something else, you are using figurative language. Any language that goes beyond the literal meaning of words in order to furnish new effects or fresh insights into an idea or a subject. The most common figures of speech are simile, metaphor, and alliteration.    Imagery    Language that appeals to the senses. Descriptions of people or objects stated in terms of our senses.    Simile  A figure of speech which involves a direct comparison between two unlike things, usually with the words like or as. Example: The muscles on his brawny arms are strong as iron bands.    Metaphor  A figure of speech which involves an implied comparison between two relatively unlike things using a form of be. The comparison is not announced by like or as. Example: The road was a ribbon of moonlight.    Alliteration  Repeated consonant sounds occurring at the beginning of words or within words. Alliteration is used to create melody, establish mood, call attention to important words, and point out similarities and contrasts. Example: wide-eyed and wondering while we wait for others to waken.    Personification  A figure of speech which gives the qualities of a person to an animal, an object, or an idea. It is a comparison which the author uses to show something in an entirely new light, to communicate a certain feeling or attitude towards it and to control the way a reader perceives it. Example: a brave handsome brute fell with a creaking rending cry--the author is giving a tree human qualities.    Onomatopoeia  The use of words that mimic sounds. They appeal to our sense of hearing and they help bring a description to life. A string of syllables the author has made up to represent the way a sound really sounds. Example: Caarackle!    Hyperbole  An exaggerated statement used to heighten effect. It is not used to mislead the reader, but to emphasize a point. Example: Shes said so on several million occasions    Idioms    Language specific expressions: http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/    Need more Help?  http://www.kidskonnect.com/content/view/...  http://www.frostfriends.org/figurative.h...    Good lucK!!!!|`|O4oCqaKkaa	Whenever you describe something by comparing it with something else, you are using figurative language.|`|oREeytpfaa	Figurative Language  Classical and traditional linguistics by some counts identified more than two hundred and fifty different figures of speech. More recently, some have reduced the list to more manageable proportions; others have claimed to be able to classify all figurative language as either metaphor or metonymy.    Easier definition- Figurative language or speech contains images. The writer or speaker describes something through the use of unusual comparisons, for effect, interest, and to make things clearer. The result of using this technique is the creation of interesting images.    Harder definition - Figurative language is not intended to be interpreted in a literal sense. Appealing to the imagination, figurative language provides new ways of looking at the world. It always makes use of a comparison between different things. Figurative language compares two things that are different in enough ways so that their similarities, when pointed out, are interesting, unique and/or surprising.    It has been customary to characterize lit as the antonym(not similar) of figurative as if the two are in dialectical opposition. But this view is not sustainable. Each semiotic niche within a culture will reach agreement about the usual or actual meaning of words in common use. This will not be fixed but will change over time. Hence, for example, the original definition of wicked referred to behaviour that was immoral or sinful, but in some subcultures, the word now carries connotations of positive approval. So, when the audience begins to decode the incoming message, the literal meaning of the whole will be the one using the commonly-used meaning for each word. Word-for-word translation between two languages won't translate the understanding of the original. The full system of interpretation requires the application of a complex set of rules to place the provisional meanings allocated to the individual words into a full context in which all the available information, linguistic and nonlinguistic, will be applied to determine where the final translation will sit on the spectrum of meaning from literal to figurative.    Cognitive linguistics, in particular, may ultimately declare all distinction between literal and figurative language irrelevant. Gilles Fauconnier and Mark Turner say    What gets called literal meaning is only a plausible default in minimally specified contexts. It is not clear that the notion "literal meaning" plays any privileged role in the on-line construction of meaning.(Fauconnier and Turner, p. 64)   The "literal meaning" is not a special form of meaning, as demonstrated by the example above; it is only the meaning the reader is most likely to assign to a word or phrase if he or she knows nothing about the context in which it is to be used.    One example is the popular usage of the word "literally" itself. As in "I was literally caught with my pants down", "literally" is usually an example of hyperbole. While using "literally" in that way may seem a gross error, it has literary precedent, appearing in the works of such writers as Sir Walter Scott, Dickens, Charlotte Bront?, Thomas Hardy, and Henry James. The usage is now widespread. Other, more intuitive choices, such as "metaphorically", might seem to diminish, rather than emphasize, the point of the story, and are therefore avoided.[          A simile is a figure of speech comparing two unlike things, often introduced with the word "like" or "as".[1] Even though similes and metaphors are both forms of comparison, similes allow the two ideas to remain distinct in spite of their similarities, whereas metaphors seek to equate two ideas despite their differences. For instance, a simile that compares a person with a bullet would go as follows: "John was a record-setting runner and as fast as a speeding bullet." A metaphor might read something like, "John was a record-setting runner. That speeding bullet could zip past you without you even knowing he was there."    A mnemonic for a simile is that "a simile is similar or alike."    Similes have been widely used in literature for their expressiveness as a figure of speech:    Curley was flopping like a fish on a line.[2]   The very mist on the Essex marshes was like a gauzy and radiant fabric.[3]   Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world like a Colossus.[4]             Metaphor (from the Greek language: Meaning "transfer") is language that directly compares seemingly unrelated subjects. It is a figure of speech that compares two or more things not using like or as. In the simplest case, this takes the form: "The [first subject] is a [second subject]." More generally, a metaphor is a rhetorical trope that describes a first subject as being or equal to a second object in some way. Thus, the first subject can be economically described because implicit and explicit attributes from the second subject are used to enhance the description of the first. This device is known for usage in literature, esp

If the larynx is bigger then generally the person will have a deeper voice. Yes men tend to have a larger larynx then women, though not always the case.

HtWjBxl5aa	An almanac is basically a "once-a-year encyclopedia" which details only the events which occurred (or will occur) during that year.    A yearbook is generally academic in nature, a simple collection of students faces, school programs, clubs, activities, etc.    Finally, an encyclopedia is a reference book.  It generally contains only the "most notable" information, but gathers that information for countless places.    For example: if you were looking to find out what day of year 2011 would have the most sun, you'd probably need an almanac.  If you wanted to find out who was voted Class Clown at Washington High School you'd use a yearbook.  And if you wanted to know who killed Lincoln you'd be best off in an encyclopedia.

O4oCqaKkaa	Martin Luther King, Jr., (January 15, 1929-April 4, 1968) was born Michael Luther King, Jr., but later had his name changed to Martin. His grandfather began the family's long tenure as pastors of the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, serving from 1914 to 1931; his father has served from then until the present, and from 1960 until his death Martin Luther acted as co-pastor. Martin Luther attended segregated public schools in Georgia, graduating from high school at the age of fifteen; he received the B. A. degree in 1948 from Morehouse College, a distinguished ***** institution of Atlanta from which both his father and grandfather had graduated. After three years of theological study at Crozer Theological Seminary in Pennsylvania where he was elected president of a predominantly white senior class, he was awarded the B.D. in 1951. With a fellowship won at Crozer, he enrolled in graduate studies at Boston University, completing his residence for the doctorate in 1953 and receiving the degree in 1955. In Boston he met and married Coretta Scott, a young woman of uncommon intellectual and artistic attainments. Two sons and two daughters were born into the family.    In 1954, Martin Luther King became pastor of the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama. Always a strong worker for civil rights for members of his race, King was, by this time, a member of the executive committee of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the leading organization of its kind in the nation. He was ready, then, early in December, 1955, to accept the leadership of the first great ***** nonviolent demonstration of contemporary times in the United States, the bus boycott described by Gunnar Jahn in his presentation speech in honor of the laureate. The boycott lasted 382 days. On December 21, 1956, after the Supreme Court of the United States had declared unconstitutional the laws requiring segregation on buses, Negroes and whites rode the buses as equals. During these days of boycott, King was arrested, his home was bombed, he was subjected to personal abuse, but at the same time he emerged as a ***** leader of the first rank.    In 1957 he was elected president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, an organization formed to provide new leadership for the now burgeoning civil rights movement. The ideals for this organization he took from Christianity; its operational techniques from Gandhi. In the eleven-year period between 1957 and 1968, King traveled over six million miles and spoke over twenty-five hundred times, appearing wherever there was injustice, protest, and action; and meanwhile he wrote five books as well as numerous articles. In these years, he led a massive protest in Birmingham, Alabama, that caught the attention of the entire world, providing what he called a coalition of conscience. and inspiring his "Letter from a Birmingham Jail", a manifesto of the ***** revolution; he planned the drives in Alabama for the registration of Negroes as voters; he directed the peaceful march on Washington, D.C., of 250,000 people to whom he delivered his address, "l Have a Dream", he conferred with President John F. Kennedy and campaigned for President Lyndon B. Johnson; he was arrested upwards of twenty times and assaulted at least four times; he was awarded five honorary degrees; was named Man of the Year by Time magazine in 1963; and became not only the symbolic leader of American blacks but also a world figure.    At the age of thirty-five, Martin Luther King, Jr., was the youngest man to have received the Nobel Peace Prize. When notified of his selection, he announced that he would turn over the prize money of $54,123 to the furtherance of the civil rights movement.    On the evening of April 4, 1968, while standing on the balcony of his motel room in Memphis, Tennessee, where he was to lead a protest march in sympathy with striking garbage workers of that city, he was assassinated.|`|1f944e23d84bc1ff43ee93ad66a40f2eaa	He was a minister of his own church (I forget where) and then he left to co-pastor a church with his father in Atlanta I think it was. That way he could also have more time for civil rights things.

Qpy2KQBuaa	Dont settle for this. There is reimbursement differences for student's with disabilities and this may be a part of this. Also, private schools aren't as prepared as publics (due to regulation) on what it means to set up an IEP (Individualized Education Plan) for students and their success.    Get an outside tester to administer (get referral from your doctor) and then take those results in. If they cant accomodate your child, MOVE them to a school that can. THIS is important to their success.|`|EzLsBHZdaa	Private schools have different rules governing testing for and serving special education needs.  Go to the public school your daughter would attend if she wasn't in private school and talk to them about getting her tested.  Public schools administer tests using trained professionals - psychologists to administer IQ tests, special education teachers to to administer academic tests and behavior analysis.  Your situation highlights a problem with private schools compared to public schools.  In a public school she probably would have been tested in first or second grade.  If your daughter does indeed have a learning disability, she has lost the opportunity to learn the subject matter all these years.|`|dBpmyIduaa	The best thing that you can do for your daughter is to get her in public school.  Private schools are not required through federal law to evaluate for learning disabilities or to implement and maintain IEP's.  Public schools on the other hand have many regulations that they must abide by when evaluating and maintaining services for children with disabilities.  This is not to say that private schools are not good, they are just not always equipped to educate children with disabilities.  Good Luck!|`|eWssw4kfaa	The following letter that I wrote to my local newspaper earlier this week about the derogatory statement those clowns made about the "Special Education Culture" might give you some clues to why your daughter's principal does not want to test your daughter for a learning disability:       The paper made the statement that "Funding cuts don't necessarily mean education suffers", yet; this paper asked the question "Is it really necessary that so many school dollars go to special ed?" Why the contradiction here? Do you really expect me to believe that this newspaper is for equal education of all students? I will tell everyone, like I told Governor Kaine last spring when the state tried to cut special education then, I know that it is hard to comprehend but it is true when I say that "The learning disabled can actually do more in life than scrub filthy toilet for a living." Albert Einstein is living proof.     The paper also doubts that one in six children who attend school has a disability. According to the United States Census Bureau, approximately 18% of the citizens residing in the United States have some forms of a disability. With approximately 18% of Americans having some form of disability, cutting the funding for special education could potentially deny almost one child in five of an equal education. Where is the justice here?     Instead of encouraging the school system to decrease funding for special education, the media should encourage the school system to want to help all students regardless of disability. The best way to eliminate the student's need for special education is to help the student want to learn and not force them out all because everyone believes that trying to teach the disabled "Is a waste of time and money." You just might be surprised what the disabled can actually learn to do.      -----  I highly doubt my letter get printed in the paper because those clowns don't like to admit when they are wrong and what they said made everyone who has a learning disability, including myself, look very stupid and incompetent.|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	Possibly because your child might be eligible for private schooling elsewhere...ie: a non religious school.    In this day and age, parochial schools really have a hard time of it.  But if your child is special needs, the school district doesn't have to pay for religious education. Were you to move your child, that's one less paid tuition.    I had my child checked out by a non-partisan source, and it made all the difference.    Good luck!|`|f55619778e2c4f36156e3d1508aa6431aa	Private schools are not required to serve kids with disabilities so they usually don't evaluate them neither.  I also never heard of one person doing an LD evaluation like with your principal.   It usually involves a team of educational  specialists.   Unless your child attends a private school that specializes in helping kids with learning disabilities then most private schools can be really tough for kids with learning disabilities.   Public schools have a lot more education services because federal law requires them to.   That makes a big difference.    Call your local public school and ask if your child can be evaluated there and still be able to attend the private school she is at now.   Perhaps a resource teacher ( a special education teacher who tutors small groups of children for a short time each day) can visit the private school and work with your child for a little while everyday.   That may not be allowed since she is not enrolled in public school but it couldn't hurt to call and ask.   Where I live the school district allow these types of visits to private schools with Speech Therapists but not with resource teachers.   The reason is because there are plenty of kids in the public school who need extra help in Resource room so they have first priority.   The number of public school kids in need of Speech Therapy is a lot smaller so Speech Therapists do have the time to visit nearby private schools to help students in need of Speech  therapy services there.    Resource room teachers are way too busy to visit with private school kids.   I've also known parents who pulled their child out of private school and into public school for this very reason.   We don't have any private schools that specialize in learning disabilities in my community so that is not even an option.   It's not even about how much money you can spend on your child's education but where can your child with LD receive the best education.   In most cases that would be your local public school.      BTW,  What is a school coach??   When I think of coach, I think of sports but that doesn't make sense with your question.   What does sports have to do with learning disabilities?|`|eGW4X9pgaa	probably to avoid having you take your money to a school where they have better programs if she does turn out to have a disability ...|`|AA10119874	That's the difference between public schools and private.|`|PnlgLBcwaa	Are you in teh US-    a catholic school can not test for LD (tehy don't have teh financing or resources)--but should be aware that they need to refer you to teh public school.    generally-students in any private school or homeschool-are leigibel for public school services and activities (sports, band, etc)    generally pediatricians do NOT tst for LD-it is done by educational pyschologits-most pediatricians are incompetant whenit comes to LD-not even knowing when to refere a specialist.    teh catholic school pronciapl may just me ignorant-or they may be afraid taht they will lose a student (and tuition) if she qualifies for specil ed    I had a couple friends with dyslexia who wnet to catholic school-and received supplemental services from teh school district after school hours    FYI-    public schools normally test for LD-not specifically dyslexia, dyscalcuia, etc....only some eductaional pyschologiuts test for SPECIFIC LD--the school may jsut say-suspected dyslexia    the catholic school does not have to provide any acommodatyions at all(they might-but when I went to catholic school-they didn't-just yelled at kids for not keeping up)--and the public school cannot provide assistance at the catholic school|`|AA12022384	Often schools are unwilling to officially test children as when a child has been diagnosed with a learning difficulty the school are obliged by law to provide extra help in the form of special educational teachers etc.  This comes out of the school budget and some schools try to avoid spending this extra money.    I was persuaded to put off for a year having my son tested for dyslexia and it was a serious mistake on my part.  During that time he became more and more frustrated and unhappy being convinced he must be stupid and getting no where with his work, it was a totally wasted year.    The day I was able to explain to my son that he was not stupid but dyslexic was probably the most important day in his school life.  He finally could understand why he was having problems and then with the correct help he soon caught up with his peers.    Insist that the school have the test done by a professional,  take no excuses, stand your ground. Find out exactly what the school have to do and go along with this knowledge and insist they do so.    If your school do not have to do this as some are suggesting you should consider finding another school for your child.    Good luck.

O4oCqaKkaa	Born on a distant plantation that she barely remembers, Sethe is the child of an African-born slave woman whose name she never knew. As a young teenager she was brought to Sweet Home, where she took a man named Halle Suggs for her husband. She had four children, pregnant with the fourth when she fled Sweet Home on foot and alone. When schoolteacher, the brutal master at Sweet Home, tracked her down, Sethe attempted to kill her children rather than see them returned to slavery. Sethe has a troubled relationship with her own past, often not willing to speak about it but obsessively reliving it in her own head. She has a mass of scars on her back that resemble a tree.     Beloved is the ghost of Sethe's third child, murdered to protect her from schoolteacher. Her real name is never known. She is the embodiment not only of the baby's ghost but also the legacy of slavery. She represents the power of the past to intrude into the present.

My answer would be maybe, with a lot of work.|`|yywRjouyaa	When you say crossed eyed I am assuming you are talking about strabismus where one eye seems to turn in or out and does not point straight ahead.   So the answer is no. What happens is because your 2 eyes are not focusing directly at the same object your brain will suppress one. Sometimes the brain will alternate which one it suppresses and during that transition the persons vision might jump causing momentarily double vision, cause the reader to skip lines or loose their place. Also because the brain suppresses an eye the reader is only tracking (moving their eyes from left to right) with one eye. This causes constant eye strain and fatigue.   During reading your eyes also make what are called fixations and saccades. People with strabismus usually overshoot or undershoot these movements because the eyes do not know how to work together (binocular vision).  As far as the dyslexia I am going to go out on a limb here and say that it is not even really dyslexia but rather the vision problem that is causing the problems. Which is often called "dyseidetic dyslexics" which is the inability toability to recognize and remember how letter and whole-word configurations look.This is because the two eyes are not working in unison and the persons visual perception is extremely skewed.     Pavevision.org has a lot of info on this and some suggestions for treatment such as surgery to correct the eyes and vision therapy to retrain the eyes and get them to work together.

fMU93DkIaa	Yes you can apply with a Psychology degree.    But they only have a PhD program. (Most of the top graduate schools do not have masters programs)  You do not need a masters to start PhD program--you'll get it along the way.  That being said, it will be difficult to get into MIT's PhD program.  You might want to get a masters somewhere else first, and then apply to their PhD program.    When looking for Masters and PhD programs, you should be looking at the profiles of professors you would want to study under.    Like:  http://web.mit.edu/linguistics/people/fa...  What is their specialty? What is their current research?  Read their past research.  You'll be spending a lot of time with that person so you'll want to like them...    Good luck!:    Their website says:  "Applicants should demonstrate in their application materials some knowledge and understanding of the subject matter of linguistics. Nonetheless, in evaluating applications, the department gives less weight to technical preparation in linguistics than to overall scientific promise. Consequently, though most successful applicants have studied some linguistics (formally or informally) before coming to MIT, applicants are not required to have taken any particular set of courses or to have been trained in any particular discipline, but must demonstrate the ability to engage in serious study of complex subject matter."|`|UxooffHZaa	Yep.

zgTsCicNaa	The broad rule is that the -ize forms are standard in the US, but that -ise ones are now usual in Britain and the Commonwealth in all but formal writing. For example, all British newspapers use the -ise forms; so do most magazines and most non-academic books published in the UK. However, some British publishers insist on the -ize forms (Oxford University Press especially), as do many academic journals and a few other publications (the SF magazine Interzone comes to mind). Most British dictionaries quote both forms, but  despite common usage  put the -ize form first.    The original form, taken from Greek via Latin, is -ize. Thats the justification for continuing to spell words that way (it helps that we say the ending with a z sound). American English standardised on the -ize ending when it was universal. However, French verbs from the same Latin and Greek sources all settled on the s form and this has been a powerful influence on British English. The change by publishers in the UK has happened comparatively recently, only beginning about a century ago (much too recently to influence American spelling), though you can find occasional examples of the -ise form in texts going back to the seventeenth century.    I like the -ise forms myself, in part because being British I was brought up to spell them that way, but also because then I dont have to remember the exceptions. There are some verbs that must be spelled with -ise because the ending is a compound one, part of a larger word, and isnt an example of the suffix. An example is compromise, where the ending is -mise, from Latin missum, something sent or placed. Some other examples spelled -ise are verbs formed from nouns that have the s in the stem, such as advertise or televise.    At the risk of sounding like a style guide, but in the hope you may find them useful for reference, these are the words always spelled in -ise, whatever your local rule about the rest: advertise, advise, apprise, chastise, circumcise, comprise, compromise, demise, despise, devise, disfranchise, enfranchise, enterprise, excise, exercise, improvise, incise, premise, revise, supervise, surmise, surprise, televise    ?|`|18f4aeb76a3e8aee506482a962921d26aa	We don't.

However it seems that even when people say they will do one thing they do another and that is why the situation has spiralled out of control. The jews from my understanding where given a bit of land that no one wanted until recently and now the blood is being shed because of the differences. I myself am an Atheist. The reason for that is because all I can see that religion does is drive a stake between people and cause conflict. I know I am only skimming the surface here but at the end of the day we would be so much better off without faiths of any religion.|`|64f1b88825b292a751bffc216f38edbaaa	half the aforementioned race are buying politicians and power  hence America stays on the side line   the other half are the CEOS of banks robbing the country of taxes (which they then use part of to bribe/buy the politicians with)  + paying themselves billions of share holders money or running fraudulent scams~check the surnames of the main players.|`|g0YNQdL2aa	I think the Israelis went over the top and used the Hamas Terrorists as an excuse to destroy as much as they could get away with.

5HTylrjGaa	Neuroscience is a biological science degree, focusing on the biological structure of the brain, it's function, it's malfunction, and how changes in these things affect behavior.    Psychology is a social science degree, focusing on various theories and viewpoints for behavior.    There is a branch of psychology, called biological psychology, that is very similar to neuroscience.    With a bachelor's in neuroscience, you can't be much. Same with a bachelor's in psychology. You can be a counselor or something equivalent. With a masters in either, you can either be a neurologist or a psychologist. A neurologist would be someone you consult if you have a structural problem with the brain or an injury..etc. A psychologist would be someone you consult if you need therapy or have a mental disorder.    If you get a med degree, you can be a brain surgeon or a clinical neurologist, or you can be a psychiatrist. The difference with these and a neurologist/psychologist is that they are legally allowed to not only diagnose illness, but to also prescribe treatment for it.|`|EDwlTWLwaa	neuroscience is more physiological, focuses on the entire nervous system   psychology focuses more on thought processes & is mostly restricted to the brain itself  neuroscience would be less likely to deal with mental disorders etc  they are very different

zgTsCicNaa	What does "greatest" mean?    Probably the best definition would be the "most defining of who we are today", something that dramatically changed the life of all humanity, and I will be referring only to inventions and not to discoveries such as the fire or the wheel.    10 - The Telescope - It proved for the first time that the Earth is nothing more than a round piece of rock in the giant pond of space and not the center of anything, much less the universe. many people didn't agree then, and they still don't agree now.    9 - The Computer - Many people have the deepest, richest, most diverse, and rewarding relationship with their computer. It plays games with them, tells them jokes, plays music to them, it does the taxes, and sometimes it' even used to work.     8 - The Television - Wherever a TV is on, it draws attention like no other piece of furniture. It can be source of amusement, knowledge, or, if misused, of violence and almost self-inflicted psychiatric disorders    7 - The Automobile - Once cars were invented, roads were improved. Once roads were improved, cities developed suburbs and expanded, because people could now live in the country, yet work in the city. Furthermore, as cars grew popular, the oil industry boomed. Oil became a key to power and wealth, and one of the major factors for political and economic conflicts in many parts of the world.     6 - The Use of Electricity - Electricity was never really invented. It existed all along, but humans only invented the means of generating this force and distributing it to individual buildings. The invention was made by Edison, who siglehandedly turned electricity into a commercial application and his Pearl Street station was the world's first electric power station. Now, anyone throughout most of the world can tap into the grid to power everything from light bulbs to computers. Actually, the human beings could be considered as feeding on electricity, besides organic products.    5 - The Telephone - many people imagined a form of telephony, even long before it was actually invented. This wonder of modern technology allows anyone to talk to anyone anywhere at any given moment, even without physically seing the person, or even knowing ho he/she is.    4 - Antibiotics - Most people actually died of infectious diseases, a few centuries ago. The plague that broke out in 1347, killed almost half of Europe's population in nearly two years. When diseases such as smallpox reached North America, they reduced the indigenous population by about 90 percent within a century. As late as 1800, the leading cause of death in the western hemisphere was tuberculosis. Almost no one ever died of old age back in the day, probably the main reason why elders were revered.    3 - The Printing Press - This may seem unimportant, but it truly is. Gutenberg's press, with its movable type, started the idea of publishing oral knowledge or multiplying exissting, hand-written books. This may actually be the reason why so many people turned their backs on Christianity, putting a Bible in the hands of anybody who wanted one. The Church no longer possessed the absolute truth, and thus the independently thinking individual emerged as the key unit of society. In the longer term, publishing universalized literacy.    2 - The Mechanical Clock - Time was actually a measure of events before the timepiece was invented, the main one being the Sun crossing the sky. No universal time actually existed, only a local one. That meant that once you agreed to meet someone at sunset, you had to clearly state where that was, because the Sun is always setting somewhere. And of course, what clocks made possible, they soon made necessary. In a clock-driven world, most of us are now either "on time," "ahead of schedule," or "running late."    1 - The Toilet - You can half all you can, but then try this experiment. Try to imagine New York, Paris or Tokyo without toilets. It's impossible. The modern city were made possible by man's ability to bring clean water in densely populated spaces and to remove the waste. Without toilets and plumbing any tall building would be impossible. Remove apartment buildings, office towers, and dense city centers from your picture of the world and you have to change the whole rest of your picture too, because the implications keep rippling.    Of course, this top isn't an absolute one, and anyone could argue its classification, but, in fact, it all comes down to how important is this or that invention to a specific individual, and how it influences his way of perceiving the world.     ?|`|aIjX0S1uaa	c o n  d o m|`|54tW840Oaa	DVR|`|fqZniU4qaa	Antiseptic.

vVd8yFdIaa	I applaud the fact that you are giving your future career some serious thought.  But please don't give in to the pressure that some misguided adults apply.  It is good to *think about* and to research a career.  But the truth is that you're likely to change your mind multiple times.  Your question itself says that this career "suddenly" popped into you head.  The same is likely to happen for many others--not just before you find a career but after, as well.  So...sure, take a psychology course if your school offers it.  But the key to most career success is to do VERY well in all coursework in essential areas--language, math, history, etc.  Continue to keep your eyes open for appealing careers, but don't figure that you must make a final decision any time soon.|`|AHEFXgE7aa	Psychology so you can understand what they are thinking.

O4oCqaKkaa	Antagonist-Opposing force in a fictional story. This is not necessarily a character. It is something that works against the Protagonist, that is all.    Protagonist-The driving force of the plot, this is a character, and can be the narrator if it is first person, a friend of the narrator or someone the narrator knows, or if it's third person, anyone from some random person that an interesting event happens to or a general hero. This is the main character in the story, protagonists are not just "good guys," despite having pro in the name. They can and are villains too.     A Foil- a character that works opposite to the protagonist, but they are not always against, though they can be. To understand this what a foil is and does, think Sherlock Holmes and Watson.     Half an hour???  A boy and his girlfried go into a bar. They get set upon by two bullies. The boy's best mate helps him out and the all live happily ever after.|`|YrdUWtSCaa	Welp, let's see...  Protagonist: The main character   Antagonist: Character who opposes the protagonist  Foil: Character that provides a contrast to the protagonist    Maybe a situation at work or school.  Look around you and observe the people around you...  Incorporate something from your life:   Many times, when one is at loss for ideas, a simple incident from ones own life would help to shape a short story! For example, an inspirational short story idea can be based about an incident that has inspired in real life.     Stop being realistic in every approach and sit back and relax. Let the creative juices flow and your imagination run wild. For example, it could be a scary short story and you need to transport yourself to a different world. A creative imaginative streak would surely be helpful to make it as interesting as possible.

It is believed that he was en route to the Soviet Union in a Japanese plane when it crashed in Taiwan, burning him fatally. However, his body was never recovered, and many theories have been put forward concerning his possible survival. One such claim is that Bose actually died in Siberia, while in Soviet captivity. Several committees have been set up by the Government of India to probe into this matter.    In May 1956, a four-man Indian team (known as the Shah Nawaz Committee) visited Japan to probe the circumstances of Bose's alleged death. The Indian government did not then request assistance from the government of Taiwan in the matter, citing their lack of diplomatic relations with Taiwan.    However, the Inquiry Commission under Justice Mukherjee, which investigated the Bose disappearance mystery in the period 1999-2005, did approach the Taiwanese government, and obtained information from the Taiwan Government that no plane carrying Bose had ever crashed in Taipei.The Mukherjee Commission also received a report originating from the US State Department, supporting the claim of the Taiwan Government that no such air crash took place during that time frame.    The Justice Mukherjee Commission of Inquiry submitted its report to the Indian Government on November 8, 2005. The report was tabled in Parliament on May 17, 2006. The probe said in its report that Bose did not die in the plane crash and the ashes at the Renkoji Temple are not his. However, the Indian Government rejected the findings of the Commission.

EBrgRBT3aa	(180406)    In 1803, Thomas Jefferson commissioned Capt. Meriwether Lewis and Lt. William Clark to explore what is now the northwest United States. The Louisiana Purchase later the same year altered the character of the planned expedition from an exploration of French territory to a first glimpse of lands that, in the view of many contemporaries, were essential to maintaining the agrarian, republican character of the nation.    The party of nearly thirty menincluding Lewis and Clark, three sergeants, twentytwo enlisted men, volunteers, interpreters, and Clark's slavedeparted St. Louis in May 1804 heading up the Missouri River. They wintered at the present site of Bismarck, North Dakota, where they acquired a guide and translator, the Shoshone woman Sacagawea. In spring 1805, they continued to the headwaters of the Missouri River, struggled across the Continental Divide, and headed west along the Salmon, Snake, and Columbia Rivers to the Pacific. They returned to St. Louis the following year.    Their exploration revealed both the absence of a trans continental water route and a wealth of information, including detailed maps of their route, the earliest descriptions of Plains Indian culture, and observations of the environment. Until the development of the railroad and steamboat, however, the region they had explored remained a furtrapping ground and repository for removed Indians.    ANSWER
ucF2xy6Aaa	Mom MUST be involved in your financial aid. Sorry. Unless you get married, REAL QUICK. You have to either be:   - Married  - Over 24  - Have kids you support  - In the military  - An orphan or ward of the court until age 18    If you are not any of those things, then you need mom to be supportive of you to go to college. There IS something called a "dependency override", but thats for kids who lived with their grandparents or aunts/uncles their whole life.

VELnLnIKaa	sparknotes.com thank me later|`|nE9BaUWIaa	You know Juliet might have been only 14. So when he says light he could mean she was light weight as a sylph, or radiant too.|`|YrdUWtSCaa	The Theme of Light  Scholar Caroline Spurgen once wrote, "The dominating image [in Romeo and Juliet] is light, every form and manifestation of it" (Shakespeare's Imagery, 310). When Romeo initially sees Juliet, he compares her immediately to the brilliant light of the torches and tapers that illuminate Capulet's great hall: " O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!" (I.V.46). Juliet is the light that frees him from the darkness of his perpetual melancholia. In the famous balcony scene Romeo associates Juliet with sunlight, "It is the east and Juliet is the sun!" (II.ii.3), daylight, "The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars/As daylight doth a lamp" (II.ii.20-1), and the light emanating from angels, "O speak again bright angel" (II.ii.26). In turn, Juliet compares their new-found love to lightening (II.ii.120), primarily to stress the speed at which their romance is moving, but also to suggest that, as the lightening is a glorious break in the blackness of the night sky, so too is their love a flash of wondrous luminance in an otherwise dark world -- a world where her every action is controlled by those around her. When the Nurse does not arrive fast enough with news about Romeo, Juliet laments that love's heralds should be thoughts "Which ten times faster glides than the sun's beams/Driving back shadows over lowering hills" (II.v.4-5). Here, the heralds of love that will bring comforting news about her darling are compared to the magical and reassuring rays of sun that drive away unwanted shadows. Juliet also equates Romeo and the bond that they share with radiant light. In a common play on words, she begs Romeo to "not impute this yielding to light love/Which the dark night hath so discovered" (II.ii.105-6), again comparing their mutual feelings of love to bright and comforting light . Having no fear of the darkness, Juliet proclaims that night can   Take [Romeo] and cut him out into little stars,   And he will make the face of heaven so fine   That all the world will be in love with night   And pay no worship to the garrish sun. (III.ii.23-6)     Here Romeo, transformed into shimmering immortality, becomes the very definition of light, outshining the sun itself. However, despite all the aforementioned positive references to light in the play, it ultimately takes on a negative role, forcing the lovers to part at dawn:  Romeo. It was the lark, the herald of the morn,   No nightingale. Look, love, what envious streaks   Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east.   Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day   Stands tiptoe on the misty mountaintops.   I must be gone and live, or stay and die. (III.V.6-11)     From this point on, darkness becomes the central motif. Romeo exclaims: "More light and light: more dark and dark our woes!" (III.v.36). And, as Peter Quennell writes, "...the beauty and brevity of love itself -- that 'brief light', doomed to quick extinction, celebrated in Catullus' famous lyric -- are set off by the 'perpetual darkness' of ancient Capulets' sepulchral vault" (Shakespeare: A Biography,150). The final indication that darkness has triumphed over light comes from The Prince: "A glooming peace this morning with it brings/The sun for sorrow will not show his head" (V.III.304-5). There are several other examples one could cite, and, despite Shakespeare's masterful poetic styling, many critics argue that these continual references to light are overkill, illustrative of Shakespeare at his most immature stage of writing.
O4oCqaKkaa	It set's up the identity of the characters involved in the play and what the play will be about.    Paris, Veronas most-eligible-bachelor, asks Lord Capulet if he can marry Capulets thirteen-year-old daughter, Juliet.     Capulet says that his daughters a little young  better wait until shes fifteen. But he says Paris can talk to his daughter at the annual Capulet bash that theyre holding tonight at his house.     Capulet gives one of his servants a list of people to invite to the party. Unfortunately, the servant cant read. The illiterate servant decides to look for some people who can read.     Romeo and Benvolio come in, still arguing about Rosaline.    The Capulets servant asks them to read the guest list for the party. Surprise, surprise, Rosalines on the list.    Romeo and Benvolio decide to crash the Capulet party. Romeo wants to see Rosaline and Benvolio wants to convince Romeo that shes not so special.

On a real IQ test, a score of 137 would put you in the top 0.2% of the country (2 in 1000 people) but they would have told you that, so either you're just here to brag or you took an internet IQ test.  Internet IQ tests are not accurate - they don't agree with the real ones (a real one can not be taken online) and they give everyone high scores.  Just look at the last 1000 times this was asked - if only 2 in 1000 people score above 130, how come more than 1000 in 2000 people on yahoo score that high?  Because they're taking fake tests.|`|c6v8veJgaa	Yep, you're smart.  The average is around 100. Einstein's IQ was over 160|`|2VFR5AKHaa	i got that score its good :)

yb76RzQQaa	I know EXACTLY how you feel.     First and foremost, I think the best advice I can give you is that, despite what others may say, it does matter which school you go to.    Secondly, don't go into a school just because your best bud is going there. You can always stay in touch, and make new friends at the same time.     Don't be too hard on yourself, think about it like this, you're not the ONLY freshman student, are you?     High school when your going through it, is almost the same for everyone.. There will be ups and downs, even lefts and rights.. but don't take the social part of it too seriously..     And don't worry I didn't have very good study habits either.. I'm a crammer.. but I made it..     Remember, there's no shame in asking questions in class.. you may not be the only one confused on it, the other people may just be too shy to ask.. (I've always been a bit loose with my tongue.. not necessarily a good quality about me all the time)..     Take care, good luck, and hope this helped!|`|AoLS7XXTaa	im in high school, But school my self at home. Im an only child and i live with my Dad. So he cant drive me too school.

You just need to think about your future. Pick the school you really like the most, don't think about where are your friends going, you can always meet them outside the school.    If you are stressed, well, as soon as you start classes you should start studying until you feel you are going to do just fine. If you know you have bad study habits, well, then change them! Go to all your classes, take notes, read your notes always the same day at night, do all your assignments and you will be fine.|`|6MHuI3NXaa	i went to a technal school called bcit...  i went because my best guy friend and my best  friend were going but in the end i knew it wasnt  good for me to be at the school because i was failing   almost everything.... dont go some where because your  friends are going. go because you want to be there.  and im a freshman in high school the movies, they   make high look scary but its really not.  however being high school is like discovering who you  are. your ARE going to try new things that wont always make your  parents happy.... all you need to do is watch who you hang out with.|`|02Rrrz47aa	freshman year sucks...its the hardest year you will face in High school...sometimes you need to break away from your friends to do what is best for you.    all of my friends went on to Catholic high schools, but I went to public high school because I wanted to play hockey...it was there I had the best times of my life! do what you WANT to do|`|pQE5eZcqaa	Don' worry  because when you are there it all seems a pointless worry    calm  relax  drink water  and think    :)|`|vghY5lbFaa	go to public school, avoid drama, avoid idiots

IXuYZvcMaa	The key to getting good grades in Mathematics is Practice.  Recent studies show that children who practice mathematics at least 1 hour a day showed great improvements in their grades.    I can also say this for myself. From the time i began to practice Mathematics in my spare time, i noticed a steady improvement in my grades.|`|c8I9oxq0aa	A really good way in planning your approach to boost your grade is by looking at the syllabus. If you were given one, which you should have if not ask for one, look for the part that explains how much of what goes towards your grade. For example, in my class tests are worth 30% of your grade. Whatever holds the most percentage on, you should focus on. Which means you need to not just do the problems but understand the concepts as well, whether it be through tutoring or extra practice on your own.|`|ZT9VPNzBaa	Does your teacher allow you to retake quizzes/tests? If so, do so.     If not, get start on studying what you're learning right now and do better. If I were you, I would be dedicated to understand math and spend every waking minute to learn.|`|4Gt3ZVqsaa	Study harder for tests but do not cram.    Ask your teacher for help.    Do extra practice on problems from the text or whatever.|`|GUvw17PSaa	ur not dumb, stay after with the teacher and then study or have some of your friends help you|`|L0j9urloaa	You're not dumb. In fact, you're rather intelligent for asking for help.    Okay.    1. Always do your homework! As dull as it sounds, it isn't too hard and it can boost your grade by a long shot! If the homework is graded, put as much effort into it as possible! An easy way to motivate yourself to do well is to reward yourself for a job well done.    2. Always participate in class! It's easy as pie and can seriously raise your grade! You can set a Reward System for participation as well, as most don't usually enjoy participating.    3. Bring your textbook home the day (or, for a few days before the quiz or test if needed) before a test or quiz and review to make sure you know the procedures. Or, if there's a website that you know and trust - preferably recommended by the school - use that! Just remember what you need to review, and do accurate self-check quizzes online if possible.    4. Projects aren't that hard, are they? Always put a lot of effort into projects and hand them in on time, and if you have an oral presentation, remember that confidence builds grades!     5. Remember your books! You don't want to suffer an unprepared.     Good luck!|`|WVyaBzcdaa	you're not dumb, just go for extra help, or get a friend to tutor you.

4IIkmaMZaa	HOPE THIS HELPS U:    1 . Who am I ?  The gross body which is composed of the seven humours (dhatus), I am not; the five cognitive sense organs, viz. the senses of hearing, touch, sight, taste, and smell, which apprehend their respective objects, viz. sound, touch, colour, taste, and odour, I am not; the five cognitive sense-organs, viz. the organs of speech, locomotion, grasping, excretion, and procreation, which have as their respective functions speaking, moving, grasping, excreting, and enjoying, I am not; the five vital airs, prana, etc., which perform respectively the five functions of in-breathing, etc., I am not; even the mind which thinks, I am not; the nescience too, which is endowed only with the residual impressions of objects, and in which there are no objects and no functioning's, I am not.  2. If I am none of these, then who am I?  After negating all of the above-mentioned as 'not this', 'not this', that Awareness which alone remains - that I am.  3. What is the nature of Awareness?  The nature of Awareness is existence-consciousness-bliss  4. When will the realization of the Self be gained?  When the world which is what-is-seen has been removed, there will be realization of the Self which is the seer.  5. Will there not be realization of the Self even while the world is there (taken as real)?  There will not be.  6. Why?  The seer and the object seen are like the rope and the snake. Just as the knowledge of the rope which is the substrate will not arise unless the false knowledge of the illusory serpent goes, so the realization of the Self which is the substrate will not be gained unless the belief that the world is real is removed.  7. When will the world which is the object seen be removed?  When the mind, which is the cause of all cognition's and of all actions, becomes quiescent, the world will disappear.  8. What is the nature of the mind?  What is called 'mind' is a wondrous power residing in the Self. It causes all thoughts to arise. Apart from thoughts, there is no such thing as mind. Therefore, thought is the nature of mind. Apart from thoughts, there is no independent entity called the world. In deep sleep there are no thoughts, and there is no world. In the states of waking and dream, there are thoughts, and there is a world also. Just as the spider emits the thread (of the web) out of itself and again withdraws it into itself, likewise the mind projects the world out of itself and again resolves it into itself. When the mind comes out of the Self, the world appears. Therefore, when the world appears (to be real), the Self does not appear; and when the Self appears (shines) the world does not appear. When one persistently inquires into the nature of the mind, the mind will end leaving the Self (as the residue). What is referred to as the Self is the Atman. The mind always exists only in dependence on something gross; it cannot stay alone. It is the mind that is called the subtle body or the soul (jiva).  9. What is the path of inquiry for understanding the nature of the mind?  That which rises as 'I' in this body is the mind. If one inquires as to where in the body the thought 'I' rises first, one would discover that it rises in the heart. That is the place of the mind's origin. Even if one thinks constantly 'I' 'I', one will be led to that place. Of all the thoughts that arise in the mind, the 'I' thought is the first. It is only after the rise of this that the other thoughts arise. It is after the appearance of the first personal pronoun that the second and third personal pronouns appear; without the first personal pronoun there will not be the second and third.  10. How will the mind become quiescent?  By the inquiry 'Who am I?'. The thought 'who am I?' will destroy all other thoughts, and like the stick used for stirring the burning pyre, it will itself in the end get destroyed. Then, there will arise Self-realization.  11. What is the means for constantly holding on to the thought 'Who am I?'  When other thoughts arise, one should not pursue them, but should inquire: 'To whom do they arise?' It does not matter how many thoughts arise. As each thought arises, one should inquire with diligence, "To whom has this thought arisen?". The answer that would emerge would be "To me". Thereupon if one inquires "Who am I?", the mind will go back to its source; and the thought that arose will become quiescent. With repeated practice in this manner, the mind will develop the skill to stay in its source. When the mind that is subtle goes out through the brain and the sense-organs, the gross names and forms appear; when it stays in the heart, the names and forms disappear. Not letting the mind go out, but retaining it in the Heart is what is called "inwardness" (antar-mukha). Letting the mind go out of the Heart is known as "externalisation" (bahir-mukha). Thus, when the mind stays in the Heart, the 'I' which is the source of all thoughts will go, and the Self which ever exists will shine.

QPwrLdUxaa	I was away last year and wanted to go home for a good portion of my time abroad at first. But I was determined to stick it  out(because if I didn't I couldn't continue my course back home lol) and, although I didn't imagine it ever would, it DID get better and by the time it was time to come home, I didn't really want to :p.     I think at first it's just hard to adapt to life in another country, you're constantly thinking about back home, your family/friends and what you're missing out on back there. But you should try to embrace the place your in, whever it is. I'm sure there's a lot to see/and do there (and if not there then nearby then other parts of the country). Get a guide book and get out there, and make sure you're always near the internet- so that you're not totally cut off from back home.    However, look ahead to how much time you have left there.

O4oCqaKkaa	x * (x+2)=80  x^2+2x-80 =0  (x+10)(x-8)=0    x=8 or -10    lengths are 8ft and 10ft|`|a01a4c7fa42d359ddf53eaa686c7f84faa	Let x be the width.  Then the length is (x + 2).  The area formula for a rectangle is this:    A = L?W.    Now plug in x for W and (x + 2) for L to get this:    A = x (x + 2)  A = x2 + 2x     Now set the area equal to 80 square feet, and move the constant to the right side of the equation.    80 = x2 + 2x  0 = x2 + 2x - 80.    The equation above factors into this:    0 = (x + 10)(x - 8).    Now set each of the factors above equal to 0 and solve for x:    x + 10 = 0 ----> x = -10  x - 8 = 0 ----> x = 8.    We reject x = -10 because a physical length can't be negative.  So x = 8, and x + 2 = 8 + 2 = 10.    The dimensions of the rectangle are width = 8 feet and length = 10 feet.|`|N8DC9foaaa	To do this, we need to set up two equations:    Since Area = length * width, then 80 = LW    They also told us that the length is 2 feet more then the width would be L = w + 2    We can put w + 2 in for L and get:    80 = (w + 2)w    When we distribute that it will be w^2 + 2w = 80    Subtract 80 from both sides -     w^2 + 2w - 80 = 0    You need to factor this equation -     (w - 8)(w - 10).    This will give you the two dimensions - 8 and 10. :)    Hope that helps!
WwCBomTMaa	Sadly, that is the misconception. People assume that since someone is homeschooled that they don't know how to interact with other people. My daughter is homeschooled but I have her enrolled in a local home link program where she gets interaction with other homeschooled children twice a week. Your husband should talk to that persons superior and tell them that he felt he was discriminated against.       To linuleb 7: Just wanted you to know that you have very narrow values. Some people that are homeschooled are done so because their children are too smart for simple, basic, standard education, and they simply are not challenged enough in public schools. And you are right about those that homeschool rejecting society's common values. If I can keep my child away from sex, drugs, foul language, and violence then I will, because that is what society's common values are.    And no I am not religious. I just want the best education for my child. And I don't want her to have to worry about peer pressure. Even the best of kids can be pressured.|`|fdd19f6be025884e97942d805edfbe1daa	Maybe they didn't like him and decided to simply use the home schooling as an excuse to not say "we don't like something about him."    Or if it's legit, maybe they just feel he's missing some valuable ability to relate to normal people or indeed teenagers - who cause a lot of crime these days - on that basis.|`|8b006ad2547d67b6ee6de41af44054b9aa	That makes a lot of sense to me. First parents who decide to homeschool their children obviously do so because they reject society's common values. It is likely he is of the same mind. Next children need to be exposed to multiple influences and to live a variety of experiences to forge their personalities. He lacked that needed exposition for several years. Though he might have succeeded in getting good grades, he is now tainted by a one-track mind personality. Please don't be offended by my cold-headed analysis. Reflect on it.  After re-reading those answers, I wish to apologize to anyone who was offended by my answer. I may be the one who's one-track-minded as my only knowledge about home-schooling relates to parents who do so for religious reasons. I wrote my answer in that light without mentionning it and perhaps, knowing this, would any of you find it less offensive if it doesn't apply to you. So sorry again, no offense intended.  ***  Thanks to you all people who reacted to my point of view. I am now more knowledgeable about proponents of home-schooling than I was and I feel that's an enrichment to my general culture.  To Jenn L: after reflecting more on your case, I must retract. If you qualify sex, drugs violence and foul langage to be "society's common values", you are indeed what most people call a religious fanatic. The full scope of my original answer applies to you and my apologies did not extend to you. I will grant you though that these are your kids, you know them better than anyone else and if you expect them to make the wrong choices should you unleash them, you are probably doing what is best for them.|`|U9pnPXnpaa	It's a form of discrimination.   I think that he needs to take it to some Human Rights group or something.|`|bCi8BCBBaa	It sounds like discrimination, but remember that in hiring, an employer can base their decisions on criteria they choose other than race or gender. An interview is always subjective, and if it doesn't go well, for whatever reason, they will use another reason to disqualify an applicant.  The tests are used as a bar and hiring decisions are made on other factors as well. They may not feel that the mission trips were equivalent to having grown up in the ghetto.  That's the kind of criteria that there isn't much you can do about. Often police departments are looking for cadets who have lived and grown up in those areas, feeling that they understand the community and mentality best. They can give extra weight to cadets who speak a second language that is needed in the community.  If he had grown up in a very wealthy community, they might say the same thing.      I'm not saying what happened is right, just what I think the hiring commission is perhaps thinking.  I wouldn't give up if I were your husband.  I would apply to other departments.  What one department is looking for could be quite different that another.   Keep on trying!|`|LsAArkUyaa	I think either they were just looking for an excuse or someone on the board has a prejudice against homeschooling.  Their reason makes no sense what so ever, especially given the "life experience" examples you have given.|`|9fsBstvDaa	What about another area? Have you contacted an attorney? Did they give him hope for re qualifying at a later date? It could also be that they are unsure of one of any personality qerks. I do not know that you will ever know. He could go to school for law enforcement on his own. I know this is disappointing. Remember every thing happens for a reason and some times we can't see the bigger picture.|`|YQOT68xFaa	That sounds like discrimination. Is there somewhere else he can apply? Or maybe someone a bit higher up the chain of command he can discuss this with?     "Please don't be offended by my cold-headed analysis. Reflect on it."    I did, and you are mistaken. I was homeschooled growing up, as was my husband. People very often assume that homeschooled kids are sheltered, ignorant, socially awkward, etc. Some are, but certainly not the majority! Most homeschooled kids I know turn out just fine. They're more than capable of thriving in social situations and academically they are often ahead of their peers. Just an FYI from someone on the other side of the fence.  : )

If you are living in halls, probably earplugs, its not nice in that way cuz the walls are so thin and students have a tendancy to be load at ALL hours, even if you have an exam!    You will need plenty of washing up sponges and liquid as thats something lots of people forget. I forgot a baking tray aswell, thats always good for things like pizza and chips and stuff.     Lots of wine glasses get broken so get lots of cheap ones.    Most people spend around 100-150 on books in their first month so save some money for those. They are usually essential.     Take some wine and beers so you can make friends with flatmates straight away and get on their side.     Highlighters and lots of filing folders are useful. but my dictaphone is a great purchase, get a good one so if you are very busy you can do other work in your lecture whilst recording then listen to it later.     I have a slow cooker in my room and thats really useful, it was only 7.99 and its enough for two people, its great for when you want curries or stews.

c26d7e95660baedb57bcbaaf575a6619aa	The funding rules are complicated and rather crazy:    If you have had funding for one HNC then you won't get funding for another HNC or the first year of a university degree    But ironically if you have completed a four year degree then you can get funding for another four year undergraduate degree    So yes you will have to pay for the course but my advise would be to go straight to university as an HNC may allow you to get into the second year of a relevant degree.    Actually having a second HNC is pretty pointless. It will look useless on a CV. You should be aiming for a higher qualification now, whether it be an HND or a degree.

bGlZ8I2iaa	A predictable result when bureaucrats set 'Government Standards' for anything: The incentive to excel disappears. In general, the minimum to meet the standard is all that is applied. When it is compounded with monetary incentives, the goal becomes, "What can I do to deliver the least and receive the most?" This has happened with education and the incentive has become to 'teach to the test' and get 'the numbers' up with little or no regard to the quality of education. The kids met the gov't regs, passed the required tests and therefore' got 'educated'. Some teachers still teach...others have thrown up their hands and quit out of the frustration of not being 'allowed' to.|`|aqto0hJTaa	Those tests are designed to assess how well the state curriculum has been taught.

I say out with the test scores because that's just going to get the teachers teaching the kids how to pass the tests rather than actually teaching them things they need to know in life. i know this is what they are doing because its how they are right now "teaching" my children in elementary school. The administration is more concerned with test scores so they can get new books than they are with actually teaching the kids, even if some have to share a book or the books are a little out dated. When I was a kid our history books ended with Kennedy as prez and Reagan was the current man in office. The teacher filled in the gaps. This was not the best way to go but its better than what they're doing now.   Actually the DO teach kids how to write checks and stuff. I personally feel its up to the parents to teach things like how to shop. I do agree, however, that we have to pay more attention to what the kids actually know versus what test scores represent because it is getting more and more obvious because it is getting more and more TRUE that the test scores are not an accurate representation of a child's education in this country anymore.

"Its" is a possessive word.     As in the first use here: "Its meaning is not that it's wrong, just out of place in your sentence." Second use is a contraction meaning 'it is.' See?    ADD: With either 'suffer' or 'suffers,' you're (you are) still referring to the word "you."  2nd ADD:   2nd thought... has to be 'suffers' to match singular use: 'you.'

Read the book while you listen to the CD. If this helps, you may want to read either out loud or by whispering to yourself. Some people are auditory processors, so visual processing alone is hard.    If you had ADHD, you would have trouble in more things than reading.

If you have add it is very easy to get off task when you read.  To be an active read means that you plan before your read, take notes while you read and review your notes.  If you are reading for a class you may want to develop questions about the text.  You can ask your teacher what you need to answer.      Another way of active reading is to keep a journal or log of what you read.  If you find that you wonder after reading 5 pages, then you should write down what you learned from your reading after every 5 pages.  This should help you to stay focused.  If you are reading a college text you might want to highlight text as you read but be careful.  Not everything needs to be highlighted.  Highlight the main ideas only.  Good luck

The definitive symptom is anxieties. Neurotic tendencies are common and may manifest themselves as depression, acute or chronic anxiety, obsessive-compulsive tendencies, phobias, and even personality disorders, such as borderline personality disorder or obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. It has perhaps been most simply defined as a "poor ability to adapt to one's environment, an inability to change one's life patterns, and the inability to develop a richer, more complex, more satisfying personality."

AA10176626	"Disney College" is a program that is offered to those who are selected as Disney interns. To be accepted into the internship program, you need to have graduated high school (or GED) and completed at least one full semester of college.    Disney interns train as a "Cast Member" in any number of different departments all over the park. Some of these involve direct contact with park visitors, while other opportunities involve more of the "behind the scenes" work that goes into making the Disney magic.    While training at Disney, interns have the opportunity to take advantage of the Disney College, which offers all kinds of courses - some of which are accredited by the American Council on Education for college credit (however, you would have to check with your home college or university to see if they will accept these courses for transfer credits).    These credit courses include things like:    Advanced hospitality management  Corporate Analysis  Corporate Communications  Human Resource Management and  Organizational Leadership    The College also offers "professional development courses" in areas like engineering, finance, security, and entertainment production.    The list goes on - a College attendee can select skill development courses in resume writing, stress management and financial planning.    So yes, there are any number of opportunities that will be available to you. The question of whether or not you will be able to transfer these courses for credit and perhaps the more important question of where you will find the time to take advantage of all of these opportunities on top of your internship responsibilities - ah, now that's up to you and your own unique situation.    But there are indeed many opportunities to take advantage of the learning experiences, and nearly all of these experiences translate to life outside of Disney. These experiences can help you get a job in any number of places after you complete your degree.    Good luck - I hope this helped you.

i5ZNMHR9aa	Consolidation loans often reduce the size of the monthly payment by extending the term of the loan beyond the 10-year repayment plan that is standard with federal loans. Depending on the loan amount, the term of the loan can be extended from 12 to 30 years. (10 years for less than $7,500; 12 years for $7,500 to $10,000; 15 years for $10,000 to $20,000; 20 years for $20,000 to $40,000; 25 years for $40,000 to $60,000; and 30 years for $60,000 and above.) The reduced monthly payment may make the loan easier to repay for some borrowers. However, by extending the term of a loan the total amount of interest paid is increased.    http://loan-house.we.bs/loanconsolidatio...    In certain circumstances (for example, when one or more of the loans was being repaid in less than 10 years because of minimum payment requirements), a consolidation loan may decrease the monthly payment without extending the overall loan term beyond 10 years. In effect, the shorter-term loan is being extended to 10 years. The total amount of interest paid will increase unless you continue to make the same monthly payment as before, in which case the total amount of interest paid will decrease.     http://loan--house.blogspot.com/2008/03/...    The interest rate on consolidation loans is the weighted average of the interest rates on the loans being consolidated, rounded up to the nearest 1/8 of a percent and capped at 8.25%.|`|ucF2xy6Aaa	Yes, until the NSLDS (National Student Loan .... ) says that your loans are in "paying" status, they can garnish your wages and use your tax refund to pay it too.

The headteacher or selection panel will decide whether the applicant's qualifications and experience are appropriate for the post or for the school.   I taught in both primary and secondary schools and I have known many teachers who have done the same.  It is possibly easier for a primary teacher to teach secondary pupils if (s)he has the subject knowledge as good primary teachers understand teaching and learning.|`|56aae78e821fccc8bfcd71a99569cf29aa	Qualified teacher status in the UK is just that, you are a qualified teacher.  It may seem bizarre, but you are qualified to teach in any school.  However, someone whose training was primary will find it difficult to convince a secondary interview panel that they have the skills to tech in the other sector.  To switch, a teacher would probably have to do extra training or arrange unpaid experience in the new sector.  Have a look through www.tda.gov.uk

t9jcDBakaa	Powerpoint CAN be a great learning resource, but if you rely on it too much the students will lose interest.  Advantages:  -It is great for kids to have a visual/auditory range so as to suffice for different types of learners.  -Different effects such as animations and videos as well as sound tracks make lessons more interesting.  -Powerpoints are clear and easy to read from the back of the class, much better than writing on a board.  However, there are some disadvantages, depending, of course, on how you use it.  -If you have large chunks of text then students will read it (or not!!), they won't listen to YOU. Try to use as little text as possible, maybe just images/diagrams/quotes/animations if you want them to listen to you.  -Don't forget it is important to to physical activities for learning, role-plays and such. Powerpoint is better than just talking/ just writing stuff down - but a variety of lessons is necessary.  -Make sure you ask questions reasonably often. I know that at school it is pretty easy to just drop off during a lesson where there is no obligation to do anything.  -Oh, and don't over do it with loads of colours and animations or it will look like a five-year-old got over excited with their new toy.  I'm sure you'll use it right, and if you do then it really can be a great learning resource.    Hope this helps.|`|zXIhB8Ycaa	only inasmuch as you don't read word for word from the PP.

However, it is technologically new; people assume that it must therefore be better. To be fair, it can save time handing papers out and saves trees and sometimes can work with active features not as easily available to users of overhead projectors. And if you don't want people to take home physical evidence, there may be an advantage. However, I'm still not completely sold on it.|`|gYfvCkRPaa	I teach college part-time.    I use Powerpoint quite a bit.   The advantages are being able to carry a set of lecture aids on a 'thumb-drive' in your pocket. You can also modify the aids just about any time you need to. Also, you don't get ink or chalk on yourself writing on a board.    The only disadvantage, and it's a small one, is having to change from slide to slide. But hey, you'd have to do that with paper notes, or the old-fashioned overhead slides.    Overall, Powerpoint is a great tool.

DISADVANTAGES:  *Can be distracting, people may focus on powerpoint and not what your saying.  *If you concentrate on it for too long you may fall asleep (I know because I did in university today)  *Expensive for pupils who want to use it, I paid 250 for mine as part of an Office package...I didn't even need most of the components.|`|bMYw17ORaa	really good.    there is nothing negative about it.|`|A5ZQmmW1aa	Advantages:  Easy to use  Can update slides easier than OHP slides  Students like it & keeps their attention longer  Can use mixed media with it  Gives a nervous teacher something to "do" so they aren't just standing in front of the class  Can be used in most places  Easy to make copies of slides as handouts    Disadvantages:  People make too many slides so it get tedious  Some colours e.g. lots of red or colours on a black background make eyes tired  Can be tempted to spend too long preparing slides because want to include animations, change colours etc

V0MnnWQwaa	One that does not produce its own shows.    It 'receives' visiting shows.    Producing theaters produce their own shows.|`|Vn7PqHM3aa	To present a show, you need both a theatre company and an actual theatre (venue). Sometimes a theatre will put on it's own show if it has it's own actors/actresses or a 'company in residence.' This is a producing theatre. Usually if a theatre is producing it means that the only shows it will put on are it's own. A receiving theatre (or presenting theatre), hires in another theatre company to present the show. So the theatre simply provides the venue. This is what happens when a show is touring - they just arrive at the receiving theatre for one night only and the theatre hosts them. In this case, the profit the show makes is split between the theatre venue and the touring company.   I know this as I work at a theatre!   Hope this helps

CQfjzPCgaa	A lot depends on your topic, of course.  But as in any academic paper, you need a strong, clear thesis at the end of your introduction paragraph.  Then you need to gather supporting information in the body of your paper.  First, you should write a skeleton outline of where you're going.  If you were doing a paper on bats, for example:    I. Intro  II. Environment/Habitat  III. Structural Anatomy  IV. Food/Nutrition  V. Impact on Ecostystem  (. . . etc.)  VI. Conclusion    Each of those points would be a separate paragraph, the first sentence of which would introduce the topic (i.e. your topic sentence).  The conclusion should restate your thesis (using different words) and draw everything to a close.      Paper anxiety is psychological.  It's all in your head.  Just approach the paper matter-of-factly and you'll do great.|`|HNSHwnJ8aa	Easy peasy.  Do you know how to write a paper?  Good.

dxlNwGuWaa	The traditonal route is to apply via the General Teacher Training Registry. you can apply online, and the fee is 15.  It pretty much the same as UCAS-you pick your top 6 places you would like to study, in order of preference, and work down the list depending whether you get accepted or rejected.  You have quite a lenghty application to fill out and you need an outstanding personal statement explaining why you want to do the course.  The course you take is a PGCE-post graduate certificate in education.  This is a year full time, and 2 years part time, of which you are eligible for a student loan, and a bursary paid for by the government.  As it implies, you ideally need a degree in a specific subject to apply (so you can specialise) however, if you have lengthy experience in a certain industry sector, you may be able to apply on those grounds.  Its also a good idea to get some real life experience of working with children, this will help loads on your application.  Primary applications fill up very early so you need to get your application in by latest November for Sept 2010 start.  It is normally too late to apply for the 2009 intake, however the GTTR website will tell you if any institutes have any places left.    Good luck!

This is common practice in academia and as you say, there are many professors who will use research assistants to help with this. (I am a research assistant at a University in the UK).    However, those academics who do use research assistants should really be acknowledging their input.

All of the classes you'll be taking for any kind of medicine will be far more advanced than any AP classes, so it doesn't really matter now which ones you take, just take as many as you can, and try and take some other types of classes as well (calculus ab and bc, physics, english, art, etc) because those will be required for any major you choose.

Time to go or Time to go and have a good time -- means that you must leave now, or you must leave now and go out and do something fun.

AA10176626	Shadow:    There is a bit of a Catch-22 that affects all young people when they first venture into the credit world. You can't borrow until you establish credit, and you can't establish credit until you have already borrowed. Getting around this obstacle requires a bit of homework and planning.    First of all, you need to understand how credit works. If I'm going to lend you several thousand dollars, I need more than just your promise that you're going to pay me back. What I would really like to see are "letters of recommendation" - and that's what your credit history really is.    Every entry in your credit report is either a "letter of recommendation", or a "danger! danger! warning! stay away!" from one of your previous lenders. If you have a "good" credit history, that means that you have borrowed money before, and always paid it back on time. If you have a bad credit history, it means that some of the creditors in your past haven't always had a good experience with you.    I'm guessing that your problem is that you have no credit history - and that's nothing to be embarrassed about, because that's how everyone starts out.    Unfortunately, though, when you have no credit history, it means that very few lenders are willing to start you out with a risky, high dollar loan. If you need to borrow a large sum of money (as in this case, when you would like a car loan of several thousand dollars), you will probably need to rely on either a "cosigner", or a special lending program designed to work with first-time borrowers in your situation.    When a lender asks for a cosigner, they're simply telling you something like: "We're sorry, but you can not qualify for this loan on your own. However, if you can bring us another responsible person who would satisfy our lending criteria, we might be able to work out a deal where that other person becomes the guarantor of your debt.". Now that's not really something that I would highly recommend to your cosigner, but if you can find someone who trusts you like that, you may be able to qualify for a car loan by offering a cosigner.    As I've also indicated, some lenders have special programs for first time car buyers. Trust me, they're well aware that most young people have little or no credit history. These programs usually have all kinds of special requirements, like, for example, that you're a college student, or perhaps even a college graduate. What's going on there is that the lenders have identified certain characteristics that seem to go with good repayment histories. College students (and this is just one example) are more likely to be good borrowers than other young people who have elected not to attend college.    There is something else very important to keep in mind - your credit history is only one part of the loan analysis. Even if you had the most spectacular credit in the world, you will not be approved for a loan that you can not afford to repay. As part of the application process, the lender will require documentation of your income, and they'll request information about your other monthly obligations. If you don't earn enough to afford the car, you will not qualify for the loan.    Suppose, for example, that the loan you want will require a monthly payment of $300. Your monthly income (after taxes) is $1500, but you also have a $750 rent, and a cable bill, and an electric bill, and your car insurance bill, and your gas, and your food, and your...you get the picture. When the lender sits down and looks at all your bills, they get more than a little nervous that you're not earning enough to pay all those bills AND the car loan, too. You would be rejected for that loan.    If you're going to qualify for a car loan, you'll need to sit down and figure out what you can afford. If you have little or no income, there's no chance you'll be approved for a loan - you have to be making more than enough to pay all your bills. You will also have to look around and ask about first time buyer programs that might be available to you, and worst comes to worst, you may have to start talking to family about the possibility of cosigning your loan for you. An acceptable cosigner is someone who is quite comfortable paying their own bills - if your friend has his own bill problems, he/she is not going to be accepted as a cosigner by the lender.    I hope this information helped you. Good luck!
HHOw5KHcaa	Music is a form of art and a way to relax when I am tired at night. It  is not my favorite thing to do, but i like to listen to some groups. There are many types of music: we have hip-hop, rap, techno, jazz and others. Music represents a universal language connection.  By some observation, the role that music takes in a teenager's life can be determined. For example, in a survey taken recently to determine the role of music in their lives, the listening habits of 60.000 teenagers were examined. The results showed that 72% of teenagers listen to music while they are doing chores. 23% of which like to listen to Hip-Hop/Rap type music.    For my part, I listen to music only when I'm in bed and I don't like to listen to Hip-Hop or Rap because I don't like the style or the lyrics. My favorite style of music is Rock and Punk. I Iisten to music whenever I can. It gives me the sensation to discover a new world. There's no other type of music that gives me this feeling.My father encourages to take interest in orther artists or bands, but it is hard to since most of those he suggests I know very little of because they are no longer alive ( like The Beattles).    From my point of view, music is a source of pleasure, it allows you to relax after a long day. Stress and the tensions of daily life can be forgotten...and almost instantly, your day is brighter.  ______________________________________...  A few comments:  watch your tenses. When you start something speaking in first person (using "I" or "me") you should keep that the same throughout. Don't go back and forth between "I" and "we".   Also, always take a little time to organize your thoughts. Decide the point you're trying to make and write them in order. You went back and forth a lot between what you thought and what was fact. Some things were not relevant to what you were talking about.  But don't worry. You are off to good start. Just keep at it. Learning another language is hard. Especially the grammar part of it.  Bonne chance!! Je esperer que cet aide (I'm sure I could use some help too? :~)  )
g09x06Zpaa	Well, I'm not going to be of any help on this.    But consider that I play violent, graphic and bloody video games. I play war games and fighting games. I'm a female age 18 if it helps, and I've been playing video games since early childhood.    I'm not violent in the least. I'd never think of hurting anyone, and I'm always compelled to help people, anyone who comes in contact with me I have to help. I'm an atheist, so no 'God Factor'.    I think that parents like to blame outside sources for their children's problems. 'I obviously didn't screw up, it must have been those -games-I let him play' is something I can hear a parents say very easily. A parent would never admit he/she raised their kid wrong, or didn't instill them with the values they would have liked. So they blame it on 'new' outside forces.     Also consider that not all violent children or teens play or played video games. Could the influence of social, or setting etc have been the cause of behavioral problems? What kind of friends did a person with behavioral problem have?    For that matter, how do we define a behavioral problem? And when the people who wrote that definition are dead, and the term is obsolete, will it be considered a problem in future generations? (i.e I've grown up with video games and computers, so the people who objected to them were silly because I've always had them in my life. It would be normal to see more techonology in the future.

rupIlSpDaa	When the short fellow enters the elevator on the 20th floor, he pushes the GROUND FLOOR button which is the lowest button on the pannel of buttons.

So when he presses the button on the elevator to go down to the ground floor,  he can easily reach the lowest button- which is the ground floor.      When he needs to go back to his apartment due to his height. His arms are only long enough to reach the 10 th button on the elevator. The 20 th floor button is to high. So he has to get out at the 10th  floor and walk the rest of the way.      In reality this wouldn't happen as if he lives on the 20 th floor and has to summon the elevator to that floor, somebody else  would probably summon the elevator to the 20 th floor as well.       But telling the person the guy is short on the outset gives away the twist of the riddle. The person should have to guess he is a midget or short. This is why everyone has got the answer, as you have given it us.

zzqmbA19aa	Yes, they track all IP's, but the tracking is done automatically in case of legal problems like threats.  But if you are using different emails to ask questions about their programs, they are much more likely to look at the email then the IP.  Most of the people looking at questions are not computer savy enough to even know what an IP is.     You don't have to worry about asking too many questions though, they are used to lots of questions.  Also questions are what college is for.  Use one email and just ask.|`|7XIyslo5aa	Yeah, they'll be able to see it was the same person.

unpWgKDyaa	That is a difficult question to answer... Each person varies as to how much time he or she needs to spend studying for the GRE. You need to set a realistic goal for yourself. Look at the GRE requirements for the programs you are applying to, take a few practice tests, and from that information you can then get an idea as to what score you will be shooting for on the GRE.    Study until you feel ready, whether that be 1 week or 5 months. Just because someone that you know had to study for 3 months straight, does not mean that you will need to (you will have different goals and test-taking ability than that individual).    I studied for 2 months (fairly consistently) and scored a 1260 (670 V + 590 Q)...

4KtPFzz5aa	After the American Civil War most states in the South passed anti-African American legislation. These became known as Jim Crow laws. This included laws that discriminated against African Americans with concern to attendance in public schools and the use of facilities such as restaurants, theaters, hotels, cinemas and public baths. Trains and buses were also segregated and in many states marriage between whites and African American people.   In the early 1950s the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People concentrated on bringing an end to segregation on buses and trains. In 1952 segregation on inter-state railways was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. This was followed in 1954 by a similar judgment concerning inter-state buses. However, states in the Deep South continued their own policy of transport segregation. This usually involved whites sitting in the front and blacks sitting nearest to the front had to give up their seats to any whites that were standing.     African American people who disobeyed the state's transport segregation policies were arrested and fined. In 1956 African Americans, led by Martin Luther King and Rosa Parks, organised the successful Montgomery Bus Boycott.     Transport segregation continued in some parts of the Deep South, so in 1961, a civil rights group, the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) began to organize Freedom Rides. After three days of training in non-violent techniques, black and white volunteers sat next to each other as they travelled through the Deep South. On their journeys they also campaigned against other forms of racial discrimination. They sat together, in segregated restaurants, lunch counters and hotels. This was especially effective when it concerned large companies who, fearing boycotts in the North, began to desegregate their businesses.     In 1964, President, Lyndon Baines Johnson, managed to persuade Congress to pass the Civil Rights Act. This made racial discrimination in public places, such as theaters, restaurants and hotels, illegal. It also required employers to provide equal employment opportunities. Projects involving federal funds could now be cut off if there was evidence of discriminated based on colour, race or national origin.   http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USA...

U66CDN2Taa	Wait.    Universities have notoriously slow personnel processes and it's not uncommon to have to wait for several weeks before receiving official confirmation that you have, or have not, got the job. There is often more than one department involved in recruiting to Universities, and this tends to slow the process down a little too. In the University I work in, I have come across several members of staff who had to wait four to six weeks after their interview before receiving confirmation.    However, if you have heard nothing in another week or so, contact the personnel department and politely enquire as to the progress of your application.    Good luck with the job.

AA10176626	Amy:    This is a very common source of confusion, but the answer is actually quite clear.    The term "dependent" is used in both the financial aid system and the tax system, but the uses of the term have absolutely nothing to do with each other. For financial aid purposes, it does not matter if the student is claimed as a dependent on anyone's taxes.     The use of the term "dependent" or "dependency classification" in financial aid refers to one of the underlying premises of the financial aid system - and that is, that the student and the student's parents are expected to be primarily responsible for the cost of higher education. However, when a student reaches a certain age, the government no longer expects mom and dad to be responsible for their expenses - I mean, how would you like it if the government insisted that you had to buy your 48-year old daughter a college education?    The question is "How old should the student be before we decide that mom and dad have no responsibility for paying for college?", and when they sat down to write the financial aid laws, they decided that a reasonable age would be "24".     Until a child is 24 years of age, the federal government expects the parents to contribute to the cost of their college education.    It doesn't matter if the child works, it doesn't matter if the child is an income tax dependent, it doesn't matter if the child lives with you, and honestly, it doesn't matter if you had a huge falling out, and you haven't spoken to each other in 5 years. The issue is not "are you helping?", the issue is "You're expected to help."    Now, there are other exceptions - children who have gone off and gotten married are "on their own". Children who have kids of their own are "on their own" (assuming they are supporting those kids). Children who have joined the military are "on their own". But unless your daughter fits within one of those special categories, the government expects YOU to contribute to the cost of her college education, until she turns 24.    What does that mean? It means that the financial aid application, the FAFSA, is used to figure out what you can reasonably be expected to contribute - that's why you will need to put your financial information on there, as well as your daughter's. The fact that she is working means that she can contribute money of her own, but that doesn't have any effect on what you will be expected to contribute. It just means that between you and her, that together you will be better able to foot some of those college costs.    So the answer is - you need to provide both of your incomes and asset information on the FAFSA, and that would be true no matter how you treated her on your tax return, and regardless of whether or not she works. When she turns 24 or gets married or joins the military or has kids, that's when she'll fill out the FAFSA on her own.    Good luck, I hope this helped.|`|cV4tAnY2aa	Hers and yours.|`|pANpZ3vaaa	If you claim her, she has to use your income.|`|Tt2pFEqFaa	Even though it is totally unfair, students have to use their parents income on the Fafsa until they are 24, no matter what. It stinks big time.|`|Aq0QQnxeaa	we need a little more info, how old is she and what year will she be in college? Is she Married? Was she in the army?    If she is still in her undergraduate and is under 24, not married, not in the army then she will have to include both hers and your financial information because she is still your dependent.     She will get financial aid she just won't be as likely to get grants which she doesn't have to pay back. She will get loans which you do have to pay back after she either finishes school or drops out (not saying that she will drop out). She can still apply for scholarships which she also doesn't have to pay back.     If you go on the FAFSA website it explains things pretty clearly. If you still have questions her schools financial aid center can help direct you.  I hope this helps :)    If this is your first time filling it out she will also need to complete a few various other items like entrance counseling. I suggest you both sit down together with your tax information and fill it out together.|`|8jtnB7riaa	Your statement is just a bit confusing so I want to make the tax thing clear.    If you claim your daughter as an exemption on your taxes, she CANNOT claim herself as an exemption on her own taxes.    As far as fafsa is concerned, on the 09-10 fafsa the question is: were you born before Jan 1, 1986?  If she cannot answer yes to this question, she will need to use your 2008 federal income tax information.

d30b72b041e52c8507426d6910c4cd72aa	The answer will depend on your state and its education system.    Some states have very good public education and the private schools tend to be for the more snobbish or kids with troubles that need more specialized care than public schools can provide.   The private schools in these states are not necessarily better than the public schools, but a different learning environment.    Other states (like mine) have a very poor education system.   Here the private schools tend to be a much better education than the public schools.    I will not send my child to a public school in this state.  The public schools are very poorly run.  The privates schools also have parents that are very interested and involved in the child's education, or they would not be paying 20K a year for it.   The private schools here also tend to have less discipline issues than the other local school.       Many parents in both types of states will also send their kids to private schools according to their religions - Catholics, Jew, Muslim etc.|`|SLFt8eHEaa	There's a slight problem with the answer above in that he appears to be talking about the American school system which is completely different to our system!    Here is the UK you're right in that private schools are ones which you pay to attend.  As a result, they tend to be better funded and therefore do, in principle, tend to offer better education.  They also offer better facilities, e.g. because they have more money they can afford to have better sports equiptment, etc.  However, because the only people who can really afford private schooling are wealthy, they tend to be full of middle class kids who sometimes don't necessarily live in the 'real world'.  For example, I was once laughed at by a kid from a private school because I had a Saturday job in Sainsbury's; they were so sheltered they didn't realise that some people actually had to work!

654c7643984cd6b3f7f0f00356056e81aa	Nanotechnology is THE wave of the future in your field! Nanotech-nology, which is sometimes shortened to "Nanotech", refers to a field whose theme is the control of matter on an atomic and molecular scale. Generally nanotechnology deals with structures of the size 100 nanometers or smaller, and involves developing materials or devices within that size.    Manufactured products are made from atoms. The properties of those products depend on how those atoms are arranged. If we rearrange the atoms in coal we can make diamond. If we rearrange the atoms in sand (and add a few other trace elements) we can make computer chips. If we rearrange the atoms in dirt, water and air we can make potatoes.     Todays manufacturing methods are very crude at the molecular level. Casting, grinding, milling and even lithography move atoms in great thundering statistical herds. It's like trying to make things out of LEGO blocks with boxing gloves on your hands. Yes, you can push the LEGO blocks into great heaps and pile them up, but you can't really snap them together the way you'd like.     In the future, nanotechnology will let us take off the boxing gloves. We'll be able to snap together the fundamental building blocks of nature easily, inexpensively and in most of the ways permitted by the laws of physics. This will be essential if we are to continue the revolution in computer hardware beyond about the next decade, and will also let us fabricate an entire new generation of products that are cleaner, stronger, lighter, and more precise.

TNtKPR3Oaa	Interesting topic, and very controversial. To get to your point, ask yourself some questions. You chose this topic for a reason, what do you want to know?  Write down your questions before going to the interview. What to ask depends on whom you are asking. Is this a pro or anti public person? Is this an adoption agency person? Someone who works in government? Tailor your questions toward the person's expertise. I wish I could give you more direction, but I would need more information from you.  Please feel free to write for more help.  Good luck,  Mrs. G  Retired HS English teacher
2d8a30b9f6641151f5c5048773c2626caa	Hello, so I wonder if this question is because you have a class assignment or because you are starting the process of applying for the Peace Corps?  The title is not so important--you should focus on the reasons why you would like to join the Peace Corps, your motivations, your desires, what you hope to learn about yourself, what you hope to bring to the community you serve, and your desire to provide whatever help and assistance you can.  If you really want some titles, look to the motto--"The toughest job you will ever love" or something like "How I hope to change the world one community at a time"    Good luck!

8ekoa6szaa	From Wikipedia:    "The Roosevelt Corollary was a substantial amendment to the Monroe Doctrine by U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt in 1904. Roosevelt's extension of the Monroe Doctrine asserted the right of the United States to intervene to stabilize the economic affairs of small states in the Caribbean and Central America if they were unable to pay their international debts. The alternative was intervention by European powers, especially Britain and Germany, which loaned money to the countries that did not repay. The catalyst of the new policy was Germany's aggressiveness in the Venezuela affair of 1902-03."|`|L0cr3eMmaa	Roosevelt issued the Roosevelt Corollary, because he wanted to show Europe that the United States is the "overseer" of the Western Hemisphere.        The Roosevelt Corollary was written in response to a problem the Dominican Republic had with Europe. The Dominican Republic was in debt with some countries in Europe. The countries in Europe were going to force the Dominican Republic to pay up. So the United States tells Europe that they will get them their money.       The Dominican Republic didn't like the United States coming into their country and demanding them to pay Europe's debt. This made the "Bad Neighbor Policy"          This also goes with Roosevelt's foreign policy which is called "Big Stick Diplomacy."

1Q9ldcWSaa	There are two formulas you can use:    1.  i^(m) = i*m, where:    i^(m) = nominal annual interest rate compounded m times per year  i = effective interest rate for 1/M OF A YEAR  m = number of times that interest is compounded per year    Remember that i is over 1/m of a year.    Example:    Suppose that the effective interest rate for 1 month is 3%.  Then the nominal annual interest rate is i^(12) = .03*12 = .36, or 36% compounded monthly.    2.  i^(m) = m* [(1+i)^(1/m) - 1]    ^(m) = nominal annual interest rate compounded m times per year  m = number of compounding periods per year  i = ANNUAL effective interest rate (as a decimal between 0 and 1, not a number)    Remember that i is over 1 year.    Example:    Suppose you're given that the effective annual interest rate is 20%.  Then the nominal annual interest rate compounded quarterly is i^(4) = 4*[(1+.2)^(1/4) - 1] = .1865, or 18.65% compounded quarterly.

yywRjouyaa	Hello  Here are the links for schools listyed by state for PT programs.   http://www.apta.org/AM/Template.cfm?sect...  And here are PTA programs.   http://www.apta.org/AM/Template.cfm?sect...    PT requires a Masters degree and PTA requires an associate degrees. Both types most likely will require you to take some pre-requisite classes and then apply to the schools program. Schools usually accept a limited amount of students into the program each year. So your best bet is to look at the links and see what schools are near you and see about applying to that particular program.|`|W1tx1p2iaa	I agree with Queen's links.  However, only 15 programs in the US offer an MS PT or MPT.  These are being phased out.  Currently the DPT is the standard.  IT 3 years on top of a BS or 6 years with a 3 plus 3 program.

1kOIXVHoaa	In many places you only have to do 'school' on 180 days a year, whether at home or at school, so you and your mum may well be legally entitled to take six months off straight in any twelve month period.     That's not to mention officially recognised concepts such as unschooling and deschooling - at a rate of one month for every year you previously spent in school; presumably you did spend more than six years in school??    Perhaps you ought to start by talking to your mum and finding out what she understands by 'homeschooling' and, if the two of you differ in your beliefs, see if the two of you can't come to some sort of a compromise which satisfies you both.    Alternatively you do not actually need your mum to teach you anything in order to homeschool successfully; my siblings and I teach ourselves and so far all of us that are old enough have been accepted into our first choice universities. You could try getting some books from the library or take a look at the numerous free resources on the web and free tutoring websites; also take a look at community groups and organisations, neighbours, youth groups, other relatives etc.    Lastly maybe your mum understands that homeschooling does not have to bear any relation to what goes in conventional schools; maybe the two of you simply have formed different views and expectations about what it means to homeschool.|`|cpmiJQyIaa	You would have to report her to the authorities.  That is the only way you would be able to return to school.  It is a violation of federal law for a child to be kept from an education unless you are over the age of sixteen if I remember correctly.|`|b5ecvoTnaa	hm... I'm going to have to go with the first person who answered. You should be being educated. It seems that your mom isn't doing much better of a job than her teachers. If not, you should look at homeschooling yourself. Try online schools. You work at your own pace and some even have live teachers you can talk to.|`|O0P6HNVBaa	"Deschooling"? Does she even know how to teach? I think you should report it. wow... Some of these answers are so bad. You have every right to go back to school.|`|r18PoGJiaa	You need to let your mother know that she can be in some serious trouble for this. As a parent she is responsible for your education as long as you are still considered a minor.  She won't let you go back to school yet wont homeschool you either?   This is considered neglect and the authorities wont take this lightly.|`|WwCBomTMaa	Check out www.highschoolonline.com. They have a list of schools that you could go to online if your mother isn't willing to teach you. It is possible that she doesn't know how to teach you, yet doesn't want you to go back to school with the abuse. Just talk to your mom about doing homeschooling on your own. That way you both win.|`|LsAArkUyaa	Perhaps your mother is giving you time to deschool and recover from the horrible experience you had in public school.  Have you asked her why she isn't doing any schooling?  Has she given you the means for you to take charge of your own education, but you aren't taking the initiative?|`|9HRkwzruaa	She may be "deschooling" you, which is a transition time to let you adjust to being home.  Many students, especially those who have had a bad situation at school, require this time.  Homeschooling can be a big adjustment.    Have you asked her why she hasn't taught you, or let her know that you're ready for academic work?  Honestly, I don't know that I'd let you go back to school either, with what happened...but you do need to communicate with her and be open.    Your question doesn't really state this, so I'm going to ask...have you requested school by whining or badgering your mom with "I wanna go back to school"?  Or have you told her honestly that you're ready for more of a challenge and feel that you'd get better instruction at school?  Your attitude while asking often has a big influence on whether she says "yes" or "no".    Have a sit-down with your mom and see what's really going on.  I bet the two of you can come to a good solution if you really talk about it.|`|Qxh1kPLfaa	I agree with the other person who mentioned "deschooling".    It is suggested that students who have had negative institutional experiences take a month off for every year they have been in institutional school.  This is so they have time to mentally overcome all the negative and prepare for the positives of learning.  If you are to the point where you want to learn, tell you mom you are interested in a certain subject or theme.

It sounds as if in order to sustain a belief in beautiful princesses and happy endings we have to ignore the fact that ballerinas *do* get broken, though there is always another one to take her place, and the broken ballerina is forgotten as if she never existed. Sort of like we have to relive that what is in the box doesn't show the harsh realities and one day we have to grow up, close that child's box, and surrender pretty fantasies.

Also, I would put the "aka's" in between the first and last name to make it flow better.

dINfAO02aa	I'd do it on Lincoln! And notice that his decisions play a very important roll in our president today: Barack Obama! Connect the future and the past! Give a life story and tell in depth what he did for African American rights, because now it is more important than ever. Connect Barack Obama's speeches to Lincoln's, back in the day. It is often tradition that African American Speakers use and quote Lincoln's speeches. Like Barack Obama's inaugerational speech, he quoted Lincoln many times! So do it on Lincoln, but add on what he did for the African Americans considering who Mr. Prez is right now!|`|7EPLQzueaa	Can I say that Slasher needs to be banned from here.

That quote means about what your question does. |`|457ANaUdaa	A scientists would have a very experimental approach and scientific mind requiring laws and data along with past research and several tests on their hypothesis.
