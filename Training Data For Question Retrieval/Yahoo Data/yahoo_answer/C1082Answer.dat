QMYNU9uNaa	You should check out Torrid! They carry Dereon and Apple Bottom jeans in that size, they also have shirts and accessories by those brands as well.|`|IbnknlP4aa	Try checking it at zappos, endless or shiekhshoes.    http://www.celebrityclothingline.com/bra...|`|hoEJ3winaa	Dereon should b in dillards but not sure in kids 14 but u probly will fit into juniours 0 and applebottom are at Jcpenny thats the last place I saw them. Goodluck
ZHf8mIitaa	Yes, it's geared towards women in their 20s-30s. It's "business casual" clothing.    And it's not junior's sizing. But unless you're ridiculously tiny, you can fit into misses clothing.|`|KHptQgrcaa	well somethings are buisness wear but i buy cute casual clothes there all the time hope this helps|`|bL3rzrEYaa	Older women? No.  I am 22, and I do not consider myself old, and I wear their clothes.  However, it is more business-type clothing, but I have always worked at a bank so it's perfect for me. I don't buy their jeans, but everything else I like there.  If you are looking for a more sophisticated look, great place to shop. They have great sales also. Can be a little expensive, but I love their stuff.
ew0FaElzaa	They say black is slimming so I would go with darker colors. Try not grab anything too tight, but you also don't want things too loose either. Find something that shows the shape but not the weight. Try and stray away from really light colors as they highlight your figure. Another thing you can go for is a girdle. This will help shape your body in tighter and more fashionable clothes while hiding that "extra" weight. It will also give great defining to your body and no one will even know you gained weight, if anything they will think you lost weight!  Good luck and I hope this has helped.|`|vwoqIUR6aa	wear more loose fitted things to hide it. buy some new clothes if need be that are tailored to your new shape-nothing too loose or too fitted though.|`|EXZcnYeFaa	well, i am a freshman in university.. and i think im starting to gain weight too =/ so.. i definitely try to stay away from bright clothes.. black is the way to go (Y) . you could still continue to wear cute skinny jeans with boots or flats, but i think the top should not be form fitting at all.. cute baby doll tops are nice and n big bold prints can hide the weight.. also, i recommend you buying a stretchable undergarment to form your body.. (http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/ABPub/2... ) .. it really makes a difference :) anyways hope i helped :)
UspK4SQBaa	A consignment shop like Plato's Closet.|`|Irr5ftN7aa	Ebay. I've made a lot of extra $$ (and then re-spent the profits on more clothes lol) selling stuff from my closet. It's quite time-consuming, but you get more $$ for higher-quality clothes than you would if you consigned it, since those stores take a large portion of your profit.|`|UJUEn2GZaa	goodwill|`|XbRc2yOOaa	umm have you tried plato's closet|`|loG7TrLMaa	www.kijiji.com|`|mHGvAc9kaa	plato's closet      Srry I can't Spell|`|r3syoIIgaa	ebay.|`|UV6K1mqtaa	You can go to consignment stores, but you do not get a lot of money for your clothes.

If you want money, I would try eBay.|`|PGZGDmCyaa	depends where you live...  unless your talking about online...   but then you would have to ship your clothes.. so idk how much money you would actually make|`|R6tdHob2aa	platoes|`|Dimi8By2aa	Plato's Closet gives you pretty decent money for your clothes, and they have some pretty cute stuff there too.|`|7BWEbeYbaa	ebay|`|YCVCZE0Iaa	Buffalo Exchange.

You can buy a box at the store, and they don't check your ID at a salon, so you can use any method, depending how much money you have to spend.|`|ZEmSSsjUaa	Yes.|`|nIjxloUgaa	ye|`|zR0Dcdevaa	It might get your parents pissed, but it's not illegal.    It's not permanent, like a tattoo, so it's not against the law.|`|GoluIRIAaa	Yeah its legal as long as you weren't like a little kid and asking for them to do it without your parents permission.|`|c6Cw7DqRaa	Whoa.. you're making it seem like a felony!|`|XR3SPPCVaa	Yeah.... it's legal. But I wouldn't do it if it would disappoint your mom. If she's against it, there is a reason for it. She loves you and she's just looking out for you. But yes, you can go into a parlor and get your hair dyed. You should really bring your mom with you, let it be a daughter/mother type experience, especially if it's your first time. You'll always remember it and the day will be special because you spent it with someone special. Talk to her about it....  Good luck!|`|k7xC3jleaa	uless your under 10 years old you can do whatever you want to your hair|`|l89OAs6qaa	as long as you payed for it.  it doesnt matter to them.|`|c9awUXaqaa	YEAH...|`|ojD5SmA9aa	it depends on age and if you do it your self|`|MxLJw2f7aa	yes|`|487UHd8uaa	yes a garden must b present to get any type of chemical to you hair i know  I'm a hairstyles
eMZthQnKaa	sugar and lemon is a good exfoliater, Put that on and then wash it off, after that put on noxema. You can find this at cvs or walgreens, mostly in common drugstores. Put that on, and keep doing this everyday!!|`|tuKY5Q7Waa	Check with your doctor and ask him about a medicine called Decutan (or anything based on Isotretinoin) they  tend to work miracles within the first week (there is no fast solution for zits/acne). However not everyone is capable of taking it apparently, not too sure why though.    The side effects that I experienced were: dry lips (solved by using chap sticks) and possible nose bleeds. The nose bleeds should be gone by the 2nd week at the most.    You can't actually get this without a prescription since the dosage that will be prescribed to you will depend on your weight if I'm not mistaken.|`|MxdOSmKUaa	Girl, acne takes MONTHS/YEARS to get rid of. NOTHING and I mean absolutely NOTHING will get rid of acne within 1-2 days. It's cause by genes and hormones, and you can't fix them within days. It's impossible.    Just drink a lot of water[ 8 glasses], and wash your back with an acne back scrub.|`|zYdi5UeIaa	wash your face every day two time and use zit cream 2 times a day it might not take two day but some will be removed|`|TiUfiuEoaa	apply proactive or benzoyl peroxide 2.5 or cream that contains or salicylic acid its very effective for acne and pimples  drink 8-10 glasses of water  Crush mint leaves to extract the juices. Apply the juice to your face every night. This acne home remedy also the tooth paste works too. To remove the redness apply the eye drops which reduces the redness I think its called Visine it instantly removes the redness.  apply ice to your face regularly it closes the pores so that would definitely reduce the acne breakout  check this site to find out how to get rid of pimples and its mark , it has good home remedies hope this http://cashsunshine.blogspot.com/search/...|`|yaq7oaH6aa	Sorry, but it's the only skin you've got, and you're stuck with it.

YhZZiV3Maa	First, let me educate you on the different colors there are and what they mean.  Anything ending in 00 means there is no pink in the foundation hue.  02 is for olive and 04 are for skin types with pink hues.    If you have pink in your neck, most likely 104 is your color.  However, if you can visibly see a foundation line on your jaw line next to your neck, chances are it is too dark.  However!  If you are using more than a bb-size for each area on your face (your neck, nose, cheeks, etc.) then you are using too much and it will look too dark.    If you are using bb-size and it still looks too dark, chances are you don't have any pink hues in your skin tone.    This is what I suggest.  Call your consultant and ask her for her to give you samples of the liquid foundation 100 and 105, since there are only 3 in the 100's to chose from.  Take them home and use and make the determination which one best suits you.    If none of the three work out and they are still too dark, then chances are you are a .5 in the Mineral Creme-to-Powder foundations.  Ask for a sample of this as well.    Hope you and your consultant can find the right shade.

ddWyRjmVaa	e-mail me|`|IfKz9cpDaa	Probably becasue of the weather. It's cold. So u gotta take care of it. Put some lotions on. It's gonna take a while to make a clean face.|`|TdrbKzagaa	try using something natural like these lotions, they really help my extremely dry skin. i use the chocolaty strawberries one, and i love it!|`|SO6ISnGWaa	maybe its too cold there...    its very sunny hot here!!...    lotion will do...|`|idhcqr5Daa	Avoid the use of tap water when cleansing dry skin. The deposits are too drying on the skin. Use mineral water to freshen your face.   Apply a spray of mineral water on your skin misted on with a plant sprayer every morning and pat your skin dry.   Cleanse your dry skin regularly. Make sure your skin gets extra careful protection. Washing dry skin with soap and water not only removes grime but also the natural oils protecting the skin. A moisturizer increases the water content of the outer layers of the skin and gives it a soft, moist look.   Use non detergent, neutral-pH products to cleanse your skin. Avoid using any commercial soap. And always touch your face gently. Double-cleanse with a cream, leaving a light, thin trace of it on the skin after the second cleansing.   Follow a bath or a shower with a mild application of baby oil. Massage your face with home-made nourishing cream every night before retiring. Be generous with the cream in the areas surrounding the eyes where tiny lines and crows feet are born.   Avoid coming in contact with highly alkaline soaps and detergents like washing soaps and powders which contain highly alkaline and drying ingredients.   Moisten with water, then apply a thin film of air-excluding moisturizer, this will restore the suppleness of the dry skin.   Don't put any heavy creams on the thin skin directly surrounding your eyes, as they will cause the skin to puff up, a process which can lead to sagging skin eventually. Instead use specifically formulated eye cream or gel.   Beauty Mask for Dry Skin (mix the ingredients thoroughly and use as a mask):   1 egg   1 teaspoon of honey,   1/2 teaspoon of olive oil   few drops of rose water   Night Moisturizing   After you clean and tone your skin, apply a splash of water or a water-misting. Pat almost dry with a soft towel, then smooth moisturizer from bosom to hairline. Allow five minutes for immediate absorption (cover your face and throat with warm washcloths to hasten penetration), then blot off any excess moisturizer with a tissue.   Men can skip the toner but should moisturize the delicate skin around the eye area.   Day Moisturizing   Apply a touch of your natural moisturizer over the freshly cleansed, toned, and dampened skin on your throat, cheeks, and around your eyes. Men should follow a two-step process. Apply moisturizer immediately after shaving. Wait ten minutes. Then moisturize again.   Once a week, take a milk bath. It will nourish and smoothen your skin. Warm your bath water and put in 250 gram of powdered milk, half tablespoon of almond oil and a few drops of your favorite perfume. Then just lie in it and let your mind wander while the wholesome foam works wonders on your dry skin.Never use hot water when cleansing dry skin.   Don't use a washcloth because a rough texture can irritate    x0x0_LEi|`|zYdi5UeIaa	you need to use alot of lotion because it is getting cold out and used the one from target that has the dry skin type

GIqACtxvaa	I have the same exact eye color and also tried Almay in the shades recommended for green and hazel without any luck.  I have tried just about every product out there and these I think are among the best for our eye color.    MAC's eye shadow in the shade -   TRAX   Loreal HIP eye shadow in the shade - Charisma     MAC's TRAX is by far my favorite eyeshadow on the market.  It is a shade of purple with specs of gold and brown in it which is perfect for our eye color.  It applies nicely and really stays put all day.  I cant say enough about it its AMAZING.   Oh yea, I wear a brown eye liner with it.     You really should stick to the purple family because it is the color that really makes green eyes POP.  Lots of Luck and really, try TRAX you will love it.|`|jjo5siKBaa	yellow colors, purples, you can try the almay intense eye color collection, browns and pinks. my eyes are similar in color and that's what i do to make my eyes stand out|`|Rb1bwBC7aa	i use blue/greeen eyeliner...(i have hazel eyes) since i have been using blue/green eyeliner guys have been staring at me alot more and been noticing me alot =)|`|9tMT4SQUaa	Both Almay and CoverGirl have products that best enhance your eye color.    Just simply go to the store and buy the products that have Hazel or Green on them, and they should work just fine!|`|3ea345aeac09b62e0de45c06218d2058aa	Use teal, Greens, Reds, golds, and fun colored eye liner.|`|qgimQqhmaa	they have this new mascara out... i think its from covergirl? well it has like metallic stuff in it that makes whatever eye color you have stand out. i havent tried it yet but i heard its good.|`|PWkWptVuaa	Either wear white or black, green or gold eyeliner/eyeshadow.  Should bring them out real well.|`|wXloRCegaa	In order to get the green or hazel aspect of your eyes to pop, you should try wearing various purple shades. The contrast in color to your eyes will make them seem more dramatic. If you want your eyes to stand out but look more natural, you may want to try warmer mocha brown shades or warm colors with slight orange undertones. Basic eyeshadow colors for green eyes would be earth tones with slight hints of gold, taupe colors, mocha browns, and lavender-purple shades. Since most green and hazel eyes has a variety of flecks, feel free to experiment with these colors so you can find the perfect one for your eyes.    Keep in mind that you should have fun with your eyeshadow and it shouldn't be a bothersome process. A general rule of thumb with eyeshadow is to first compliment your eye color and then it shouldn't contrast your clothing. In other words, don't wear a purple based eyeshadow on your blue eyes while you are wearing a coral toned shirt. You should try to keep your clothing and eyeshadow in the same or color family, or at least a complimentary family. And finally, remember that sometimes less is more. Don't add 5 layers of green eyeshadow on your brown eyes, thinking that it will make them look fabulous. Often times a slight hint of color is all your eyes need to really pop and look mesmerizing.

9tMT4SQUaa	I have big blue eyes and long lashes, too!    Sometimes I use pale pink eyeshadow, and then a brownish, darker color toward the outer edges of my eyelids.    It makes them POP!|`|ZftI0W4Eaa	smokey eyes. Line the lid of your eyes with eyeliner (right up close to your lashes) and then gradually fade from black to dark grey to light grey eyeshadow :)|`|Z6ZJTj8laa	dusty grey eye shadow should set your eyes off, you can get different coloured mascara too from some manufacturers.|`|xKCkPN8jaa	Try playing up some bright colours!|`|SJLgRqgSaa	try copper or golden eyeshaow  do smokey eyes  get denim blue eyeliner and use that  just wear mascara by itself xx|`|hj952SLyaa	I would recommend that you use blues and white your eyes will really stand out|`|GyKkb3ezaa	Shades of blue will help make those big blue eyes pop! Try a darker blue right above the eyelid and in the crease of the eye a lighter blue. You can also try a darker blue in the inner corner of your eye and as you work your way outwards try a lighter blue. When completed take your thumb and blend the colors together. You can also take a white shimmery shadow right below the eyebrow to make your eyes look ever larger and awake. Also you can place light shimmery shadow in the corner of your eyes.     Other colors that look great with big blue eyes is brown, golds, and light greens. A smokey eye is also always a plus because darker shadows make lighter eyes appear even brighter.|`|N53oHiwNaa	try a coppery brown or gold :) it looks amazing with blue eyes but still looks natural ..hope that helped
NBkpOgIgaa	I used to dye my hair all the time and straighten it when it was still wet!  Its fine to straighten your hair after you dye it.   Its probably not to healthy for your hair, just make sure you condition the ends a lot.|`|bNcL4RfZaa	It will be fine.  I always straighten my hair even after colouring.|`|qrfJ0ffiaa	I always straighten my hair after colouring and it doesnt destroy the colour, it makes it sleek and shiney!!|`|eG5W05Pbaa	yea jst use heat protection spray|`|xKCkPN8jaa	The colour would stay just be careful cuz it can dry your hair out like crazy! Try using heat defense products from s-factor which you can buy at trade secrets.     hope that helps :)|`|qNHMcRL4aa	it might come off on your straighteners if its a bit damp but it wont do any harm.  deends if u used permenant or semi permenant.|`|32E32V1paa	It's okay to straighten it.   But the color probably just wont last as long as it usually would.  Make sure to color it every 4-6 weeks, if you want it to stay that color.|`|Z3pQ0Teuaa	Yep, just make sure you have a heat protectant for your fresh hair :)      Oh and another tip, they say to hold off as long as you can initially after dying your hair dark or red to retain as much color as possible :)|`|7tyRW6oIaa	no the color won't come out, that would only happen if you washed it right away, so make sure to wait AT LEAST three days before you wash your hair! the dye won't come out tho wen you straighten it.|`|czAbrzcUaa	You can straighten it.|`|dxeb0BfBaa	It would be OK to straighten it but I always advise people use heat defence/protection spray whether their hair is coloured or not. Washing your hair & blow drying or heat styling can cause colour to fade but you should never recolour your hair, instead a good way to freshen up your colour is to use a wash-in semi permanent colour every 2-3 weeks depending on how often you wash your hair (wash-in colours usually last 6-8 washes). If you have to mix the colour with a developer then it will damage the hair structure so you never let it touch the same part of your hair twice. Once you have your desired shade, only recolour the roots every 6-8weeks, never the ends. Contrary to popular belief, washing your hair straight after colouring doesnt fade it either. Once the colour has penetrated the hair shaft it will not wash out but it may fade with time.|`|NzLaEKEgaa	Hi! I coloured my hair two days ago with a permanent haircolour, and I straighten my hair very often and the colour does NOT come out. It is good to protect the hair before you straighten it though, which I am sure you already know ;) just use a leave in conditioner before using your hair iron or use some heat protecting serum, I only use a leave-in conditioner. The colour does not fade at all, but maybe it depends on which kind of hair dye you have used, permanent or a hair dye that lasts for a few weeks only.     Hope I helped!   Many huggies

xhz1kWroaa	I think you should go with the silver flats... white flats would look too "matchy" with the top.  It may make it sort of corny.  I think you should put your hair up in a nice, high pony and maybe wear a silver head band along with that.  that would look soo cute!  Good luck.|`|AjFA8qIxaa	I don't know where you're going so i'm giving you options that would all look nice, k.    First its either silver flats and silver accesories or white flats ( minus the legwarmers please) and white accesories.  Personally i would go with white flats as you have the white top and you have more options on the color of your accessories.    If you go to a club for example or a night out gold flats ( not sparkly , u have to go for a subtle tone) and gold jewellery would look awesome.    Heels would look sexier, if you wanna be comfortable,go with short wide heels. Hot, but you walk like in a sneaker :)     You can wear you hair down if you wanna look cute and pretty  and up if you wanna look more sophisticated ( a loose sexy updo)   Also don't over accessorize it will make you look cheap instead of the glamorous your going for :)   Have fun!|`|icTmbLjfaa	Silver heels and accessories, wear your hair down with loose curls and put on some nice sweet perfume.

qOKFuXfLaa	some people do get sick ... but it's very rare    products made in China are most likely to cause sickness|`|3OTE1t5eaa	Anything is possible when it comes to the chemical make up of a product. A lot of beauty products have chemicals that aren't good for your health in them but a lot of those chemicals are what lead to the results we buy them to achieve.  There's also the cases where there are bad things in them, but not enough to really do much harm to u. Whether a chemical will harm u also can depend on how much is used in the product and how it was manufactured along with how it reacts to other chemicals used in the product. Just know there's usually a healthier form of it. I'd say if u really want to know what's in products u use and if they can have any harmful effects is to google some of the ingredients.|`|Z0GfGZtJaa	Most of those products have been tested on animals to screen out the carcinogenics.  But as they say    "Anything is possible"|`|sHUnctqIaa	In the last year there's been a big controversy about Parabens in cosmetics and there cancer causing ability's. Parabens are a chemical used is Cosmetics and skin care to stabilize the product. However, the chemical composition of Parabens is similar to that of estrogen, and when applied to the same place over and over again can cause cells to mutate. This holds especially true if you are ingesting the paraben or putting it near a mucas membrane or open skin. A great example would be shaving your underarms then applying deodorant which often contains parabens. The Parabens are absorbed into the tissue and mutate. This is a theory however, and is yet to be prov-en absolutely true. It is spurred on by the presence of parabens in cancerous tumors. Here's a few sites to check out if you want to know more.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parabens  http://www.thegoodhuman.com/2007/06/21/w...|`|d7RxeNJbaa	visit me at:  cancerfighting-way2success.blogspot.co...

eGmVFUAPaa	why would you take ear clip off?  Why hold the damn thing when you can just clip it to your ear.

Na7aCxUgaa	Hi Devon     It has been my Experience  that a bra for a women is a very personal thing  They are very far from one size fits all  .I am thinking you should just let her pick it out ! Offer to take her to the store she can pick it out and you can pay for it . Be prepared to spend at least 3 - 4 hours for her to pick it out .  Steve|`|mIMsvE7Aaa	ok not sure as it says yahoo above and not yahoo uk where you live as to how good my advice will be,firstly do you know her size? Also bear in mind that you do not always take the same size in all bra's depends on style and fit,but i would say a push up bra would be good,if the dress isn't srapless then get a bra with straps,maybe with padding but at least one that says push up or gives cleavage or plunge,make sure the niddle is low and narrow or it will show when dress is on,and make sure tops of cups aren't too high or this will show too,if you sadi maybe what dress she is or may wear this with it may help,also style and colour of dress,if you can figure a bit of this out if you keep your answer on and add this you may get even better answers,hope any of what i've said may help.|`|MVsQ2xjIaa	print the picture of the dress and bring it to the Victoria Secret's sales girl and they will tell you what they have :)  That way you can actually touch the fabrics, pick the color you want according to how much you want to spend etc and they will be able to explain to you the "effect" of each different model

G68l0Zviaa	Not too light but i reccomend.... Dark brown Or Dark Blue.    Dark blue may sound rediculous but my hiar use to be dark blue i died it but im a scene and it looks very SCENEish so if u dont like scene things plz dont attempt !|`|vXx3mXZIaa	i would suggest not to take it too light, with a short style. it also depends on your style. some people don't like black hair, some do. i have short hair and i have just dyed it reddish black. it really suits the style. but that's similar to what you have now by the sound of it. personally i'd go either black, or light brown. hope this helps :)

Take the wand and do a thin line of concealer from the inner corner of the eye out to right before the far end. Pat (Never rub) the concealer into the skin. To cover dark purple circles, use one that is Yellow based (any of the "warm" concealers).|`|zPFclJznaa	embracing them is the only thing you can do...|`|aB2zSt6Vaa	You need something with a greenish tint to outweigh the bluish and purple coloring that makes your eyes look like that.

LZuLpEZvaa	Personally I think the third one looks great. I don't know what you look like obviously, but the third picture is much more stylish and fun.

jw72N1moaa	Your hair cut is really nice at the moment, I like how you have had your layers cut. I'm not really sure the red works to be really honest.    I think that asymmetric cuts are great if you want an edgier style. Why not get one side of you hair cut up just above your collar bone, and let the other side of your hair hang longer. It's such an interesting cut. Add in some choppy layers (like what you have) to the back and sides to create texture and edge to your hair. Get a sweeping side fringe cut in as well.    I think for colour you shouldn't go too dark. Maybe dye your hair either a dirty blonde colour or mousey brown. Adding a flash of colour would make your hair look mysterious. I would advise you don't get the colour all the way through your hair. Keep it minimal as it looks a lot more interesting.     If you do get the cut I suggested, dying the underneath of the long section of your hair would be best, and you can lead the colour up into your fringe. Why not try a blue colour to match your eyes? Purple would look good if you decide to dye your hair lighter, blue would look better with darker hair.    I personally think the cut would suit you, and I really hope you like the idea. Dye is down to personal choice, but don't go too dark otherwise you will look quite washed out :)    Hope it helps you x|`|AA11314349	my favorite eighties hairstyle shaved except for the bangs and 2 different colours... worn by liz on degrassi (the original one) now you would really be different.  http://www.menvafan.net/annat/tv/Liz.png|`|FOsd9DP6aa	Get really short layers at the top of your hair and dye it dark brown or black. Then get some coloured extensions, you know the streaks of colour? & get a full set of extensions in the same colour you dye it.|`|fzAaPFelaa	I would leave the cut the same, or if not make it a little more spkey on top. I would also dye the hair dark black, and where your neck is, put some platinume blonde or pink in the back. That would look cute. Hope that helps.|`|wUAUKlKkaa	what about really light highlights and dark dark brown lowlights.  might be nice to have all one length.  or, my friend has hers all one colour (brown) and a very blond streak under her parting on one side and it looks really good.|`|3f8HVRGRaa	Oh, dear.    That red really clashes with your (I'm assuming) natural hair. Really. It's loud and abrasive and doesn't look good. I'd go for a dark and warm brown.    And, that cut? Scene hair is a passing fad and thank God. Too many girls have this hair and it's nothing unique or pretty or special. If you don't mind going short, I'd suggest and mid-neck length bob. The bobs that are shorter in the back but get longer as they come to the front.That would look really nice with a brown color.

Has all ur questions answered and excellent tips.|`|r5oL56xCaa	one thing to remember:    LESS IS MORE|`|GO7tZtPxaa	My best tip that I could ever offer is to Highlight- under the eyes and around the nose- not enough women do this. The best stuff to use is Touche eclait but this is expensive, there are far cheaper versions that are just as effective!!    Smokey eyes are difficult and can end up looking like youve been punched, try blending black eyeliner in the top of your eyelid and underneath- but only half way or it'll be to much!!|`|7o5cEqzaaa	make sure u always blend & that the shades of the colours u use suit ur skin tone.    for a smokey eye, this is how i do mine:  1. Use a light (skin toned) colour all over the eye- lashes to brow.  2. Use a black pencil eyeliner and line above the top lashes- doesnt matter too much if its a bit messy.  3. Use a cotton bud with a dark eyeshadow on it and go over the eyeliner- making it smudgy.  4. Line under the bottom lashes with a pencil eyeliner and smudge using a clean cotton bud/smudging pen.  5. Use a middle toned eyeshadow (an in-between colour of the ones using) and go over the lid of your eye and just up to the brow bone or just above the crease- which ever you like better.  6. Blend or smudge the middle colour upwards into the lighter colour- just the top edge of the middle colour so you still have colour on your lid.  7. Use mascara- and dont forget eyelash curler first- apply mascara to the bottom aswell-if you want.|`|r4i7xPnMaa	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCnJ8B0Ay...  This is the easiest smokey eye tutorial I've found so far. All you need is one eyeshadow (gray, brown, purple, black, whichever color you intend on using) a tube of mascara, and a blending brush. Eyeliner is optional, but it will make the look a lot more dramatic.    And now some tips:  If you're using liquid eyeliner (for a SUPER dramatic look), I've found that I get the best application if I make a very light line on my eyelid with a pencil eyeliner first, and then go back over it with the liquid. It's a lot easier to trace a pre-existing line than it is to do it freehand.  If you want your lip color to be a little bit more nude, dab a (teeny tiny) bit of concealer on your lips first.  Do your eye makeup first, that way any eyeshadow fallout can be wiped away without you having to worry about disturbing your foundation/blush.    Hope this helps!

fvre0o9laa	The "big names" in home patterns are:  http://www.simplicity.com  http://www.mccall.com  http://www.butterick.com  http://www.voguepatterns.com  but there are a number of other smaller companies out there, some of which produce very good patterns -- e.g., http://www.burda.com or http://kwiksew.com    There are a lot more pattern companies linked at: http://sewing.about.com/od/patternsproje... and reviews of many patterns at http://www.patternreview.com    If you know what you want, sketch it out and show it to the person who's going to be sewing for you.  S/he may know of patterns that can be easily adapted.  Or if you want to go hunting through the pattern books or online for yourself, look not just at the "special occasion dresses" but also at the regular dress sections of the catalog.  It's very little trouble to shorten or lengthen a skirt, for instance... or even graft a different skirt onto a top, in most instances.|`|SbIkiNd6aa	maybe try this?  http://www.ehow.com/how_2305056_design-p...|`|CaEVHO32aa	google it...

It's the ingredients in the antiperspirant (aluminum) that clogs up the pores to prevent sweat from being released. toothpaste will only irritate your skin and run, making a mess on your clothes.    Well...you can also try botox. getting an injection can stop the nerves from sending signals to the sweat glands that make sweat.

UyHLvhloaa	It's art. It's their way of life and way to express themselves, it's a hobby that makes them millions. Each outrageouse outfit is made specifically for that show, and each show has themes, and when people watch them it give them money. Those designers ton down those outfits but keeping the theme/feel of their collection, and then people buy the pieces and mix them with whatever they want. The outfits in shows are over the top, but when they make the collection it's toned down..basically. Also, it looks wild because of the way they perfectly, yet strangly, place A LOT of big pieces together in one outfit. Hope this helpes |`|mhvb9eFkaa	My wife and I have talked about this before and neither of us can understand it either. lol   I think it is just another way for them to show they have way more money than sense!  ;-)|`|vsjCVgtjaa	poor looser you are so stupid go to salvation army then|`|8baNHf6Saa	the type of runway shows you're describing sounds like haute couture. these are the extreme shows which usually influence what will be in fashion next season. for example, if in one of these shows a huge designer featured a lot of women dressed as men; the season after that would feature many smaller less dramatic designers with masculine tailoring.     it is art. of course. very influential art.|`|JACkBYeKaa	i really don't know either.

AA11100368	You can wear it, you can wear anything you want to an interview, just the out come might be affected.  Something to keep in mind:  Sears tends to be geared toward older people as it is an older chain.  This affects your interview in one way.  You will probably have someone much older than you conducting the interview.  Regardless of it being a male or female interviewer, conservative tends to be the way to go. It suggests a more professional mindset.  I only say this because the shirt has a lower cut neckline, and if you are more heavy chested than the model, you may want to consider that cleavage tends to be a problem in a professional environment.  Another problem you might run into is that, if the interviewer is a man and you are wearing something he finds enticing, you may start a new career with attention you would rather not attract.  Purely personal opinion: From a conservative vs racy aspect, if it fits you like it does on the model,  go for it. I think it is a great top and you should feel proud to wear it wherever you like. Black pants and black heels would be find for any interview.    Best tip: Be yourself they know when you are trying too hard to be what they're lookin for.  I didn't get a job for this reason and then my next interview, I was hired on the spot because I acted like myself.|`|rgXM57HYaa	Sure! Why not LOL  Hope everything goes great!|`|l3hvKFMXaa	yep wear it to interview then take it off and make sure ur lungs are healthy and you have a great mouth|`|iw0slAK9aa	yess it sunds beautiiful n the shirt iis really pretttyy        just remeberr * the 1st impression is worth it all *|`|GBEgFS19aa	yeah you should totally wear that  and just remember NEVER wear jeans.  just be professional and don't acceppt any food or drink.|`|5V1f3kldaa	Be confidant and brave.  look your interviewie in the eyes and speak clearly.... if you believe in yourself then they will too.      I think that the shirt is great..not to dressy or casual.      Good Luck with your job hunt!|`|fzAaPFelaa	I think anything fashionable, not too much cleavage with some black, would be suitable for an interview. And i think what you wore is fine. IT really doesnt matter how you dress, as long as you nailed the interview.     Take Care.|`|1wQgeBwSaa	This top is perfect for an interview for at least where I work in an office.  In being a previous adult educator I always told my students that the attitude to have is to think that they are loosing out by not hiring you.  This generally works in keeping you composed and confident.  Good luck !|`|ZmU6ZNhBaa	Yeah it looks really nyc!! Good Luck!|`|o298GAKcaa	yes that would be nice you will look smart act calm not to nervous|`|8RCEWgzqaa	i think that would look really nice =)     just remember to make eye contact and give a good hand shake.

GOOD LUCK!|`|xGDkGuIxaa	what? you're wearing a shirt from macy's to an interview at sears?!  jk.  but basically don't feel bad about BSing some stuff, like, oh i love working with people.. trust me, after working in retail, you won't.|`|KGHDv7VGaa	Yes your outfit is perfect, but if your not comfortable in heels don't wear them. A nice pair of comfortable black flats will be just as good. Comfortable is the key. Answer all questions they ask, as you think they would want to hear - but be honest. For example if your going to be a cashier at Sears during the interview make yourself out to be the most trustworthy best damn cashier there is!    Good Luck!|`|LVJMdy5faa	yes it is very cute and appropriate. a tip i guess would be is don't be rude and be your self! good luck hope you get the job!|`|yLxuHxHbaa	Sure, that outfit looks great for an interview.    My Tips for getting the job:    - Know your strengths and weakness  - Bring a copy of your resume, just in case  - Arrive at least 15 minutes early  - Always look the interviewer in the eyes  - Smile  - Since its your interview is at Sears, make sure and say your always   aiming for 100% customer satisfaction    See the link below it has 50 most commonly asked questions in an interview. Hope it helps. Good luck!|`|6nOMv6aLaa	A prospective employer wants to see that you are interested and willing to do what needs to be done. At a department store, they will expect you to be dressing up nicely, so that looks smart and not overly business.    Don't sit until the interviewer sits down or asks you to sit. Don't slouch, sit upright and slightly forwards (shows you are interested). Look the interviewer in the eye when they look at you and ask you questions. Don't be afraid to take a second to answer a question if you need to think about it (you don't want to just blurt the first thing that comes out of your mouth). Find a way to make negatives into positives ("I sometimes work too hard..." although, you should never ever lie if something doesn't apply to you, the interviewer has experience and will see right through it). Be honest and don't worry about being nervous, this is probably your first job and they will know that (and they will probably understand because everyone must start somewhere!).    Good luck! and be sure to smile!|`|0s0oVnngaa	Yeah! It is great to were to an interview. It's Sears though, it may be a little to dressy. Go to Sears this week before the interview and ask some people who work there what they wore to their interview. It's a good outfit. If you want to go above and beyond, I would were something that is from Sears. It makes them think: Gosh, she went through all that trouble just to get this job. Oh, smile a lot; but not a fake smile. It's amazing there doing job interviews in this economy. Make sure your teeth are clean and smell nice. Once you work there you'll most likely be asked to were Sears clothing. Good Luck!!!!!!!!!! :)    P.S. It's good that your not one of those lazy kids who expect there parents to always give them money!|`|i3CtK5Ibaa	i think that would be fine to wear =]|`|sDHxandWaa	Looks professional enough to me|`|iXt3erseaa	Yes - looks great!

Tip: have a firm handshake.|`|b3fcDem4aa	Hey, well just make sure that you cant see any cleavage when wearing the shirt.  If there is no cleavage, this outifit is completely appropriate! It sounds cute too.  Good luck at the interview!|`|8RV2Z4lzaa	wow that looks great and very appropriate at ur interview u should make sure u have ur reseme n many other certificates that uv earned ova the years tell them every expierience uv ever had with the topics they ask u even the simple things count    GOOD LUCK|`|a6a5ee67f2bc70e723086b11422d4c3daa	thats a great interview outfit|`|LCzUfKG3aa	very appropriate|`|zPFclJznaa	its sears! they dont care!|`|77NzfiVkaa	That is good to wear.

My best tip is to relax the interview is not hard at all and they basically want your honest answers. The questions are standard interview questions i.e. Why did you choose to work at Sears? Are you good working with people? etc.|`|6xHOa3tJaa	yes my tip is be on time don't wear to much makeup|`|bAmpR3Exaa	yes that would be finee. (:  and cuteee|`|JLmUdJwpaa	mhmm very pretty :)|`|NEQcHaF8aa	sure unless you are planning on being the manager then a nice pantsuit would be nice|`|9dr0BZIbaa	Although I personally would wear a skirt with tights, I think that the outfit is a very classy look.  So, don't be worried about your style because it looks great.  As for the job, I think you should just be yourself.  They want to know your thoughts and interests, so be natural.|`|EgbIYBehaa	Yeah its really cute!|`|JSMAZdLAaa	I think that looks like a good outfit|`|Eo4PngmAaa	i think that would be perfect for a job interview.  my best tip is say ur really into house furniture and be yourself and make sure you be honest!:)

It's classy and put-together.|`|RFCcWPliaa	E. If I were you, though, I'd add some jewelry or colored shoes or something to let them know that you have even the slightest bit of personality.

You could also try putting the blouse under the blazer. You could do that with the skirt or pants.

Good luck|`|3fnKYTGyaa	These outfits are a little too sexy for an interview. The white button down is really thin and fitted and the little vest isn't right either. The most appropriate one is E. You could probably add a colored shirt underneath to liven it up but it is the only one that is appropriate for an interview.|`|vn739fgfaa	I would say C!!  E is very nice but all black is more suitable for a funeral than a job interview, C is well put together and classy.|`|b3fcDem4aa	A and E are the best ones.

AA11311675	Hazel eyes are already easy to fall in love with but using splashes of makeup colors can make your eyes even sultrier. Pick up eye shadows in shades such as lavender, deep mauves, pinks, plums and eggplant. These colors work well with hazel eyes to make them appear more vibrant and aliveno one will be able to look away. To create a more dramatic look, apply a deep/darker shade to your crease, using a slightly upward and outward motion. For a lighter, everyday appearance, throw some shimmer onto your lids to make your whole look shine.|`|s0TiTrd3aa	http://www1.istockphoto.com/file_thumbvi...    http://www.hollywood-celebrity-pictures....    http://images.teamsugar.com/files/upl1/1...    mostly, greens and browns are good for a natural-looking hazel eye, but if you really want to play up your makeup, go for blues and purples.|`|oojO4WAraa	Almay makes two sets of eyemakeup "Bring out the Hazel" and "Play up the Hazel".

You don't need to overdo it with other stuff. You're lucky to have such a beautiful eye color.|`|yENww2b0aa	use a eyeliner on your water line (black)

g3bMrOYzaa	My salon that I go to does makeup, so try a local salon :) Hope I helped!|`|6jXuUCdraa	sephora does it for free, but they'll pester you like crazy to buy their products whole doing it
r4i7xPnMaa	If you have oily skin, dream matte mousse probably isn't your best bet. Because of all the other things you put on your skin beforehand (which are all fantastic things to wear! Good for you!), your makeup is kind of melting off of you.    I suggest picking up a decent concealer (such as L'Oreal True Match, because it comes in tons of different shades) to cover up any blemishes and maybe trying out a powder foundation. Your moisturizer will give the powder something to stick to, so you should be able to get pretty long-lasting coverage. I believe Almay makes a Clear Complexion powder foundation that is non-comedogenic, which means it won't clog pores. I know that the clear complexion line also has acne fighting ingredients. If Almay isn't your cup of tea, maybe try a mineral powder. I believe L'Oreal or Maybelline both make one. If you have a Rite Aid or CVS near you, try going there. I know Rite Aid will give you a full refund on any cosmetics you happen to return, so you'll be able to try something new if my suggestions don't work out.    Good luck!|`|XNMw2hpraa	See if it's your makeup. Go without makeup for a day. Then try a non-mousse based product instead and see if that helps.  I've heard of Proactive doing that because sometimes your skin dries out really badly. Try leaving on your moisturizer (Oil of Olay oil-free is really good) before you put on your makeup to absorb into your pores. Maybe then your makeup will go on better.  If not, maybe a pore cleansing scrub would remove buildup.   Good luck.|`|Cha4lyL9aa	First of all, Cleansing ur face day n Night will help. Secondly, remember noones looks that close to ur face that they can see ur pores.  But the first thing to use is oil free moisturiser, then cover up for spots, then a foundation suitable for ur skin type, then a press powder.   Make sure u rub in the foundation in well.   Hope this helps|`|H57vwVT2aa	Wow i wish i knew so much about what looked natural on my skin when i was only 13. R u sure that what u r using is the best? It sounds like it is being caked on which is why you can see it, thick makeup settles into your pores. Have you tried any mineral based products? The matte mouse is pretty thick. You are probably applying too much foundation. If you are using a moisturizer then you should not have skin that is flaking off. Otherwise it could be some kind of skin disorder like eczema or something. Maybe go see a dermatologist if you think ur makeup or the way you apply the makeup is not the problem. Good luck.|`|XXGF0hzYaa	make sure you blend it in smoothly. if you leave some parts just there it will get crusty.   or, you could not wear too detailed makeup;   since ur only thirteen years old,   try a subtle eyeliner, mascara, or lip gloss.  those shouldnt crust.|`|VHtY62Jcaa	Maybe you just need to find a better moisturizer,  Also, I've tried that dream matte mousse & it tends to make people look like they have caked on their makeup.  Try a mineral powder instead. If you go to www.everdayminerals.com you can get a free kit of three bases, a cheek color, & concealer. You just pay for s&h which is under $4:)|`|s4psKJrPaa	try mineral powder makeup! i use it and i love it! i use loreal, its rlly good!    mine? http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...|`|IlaCVXC1aa	that happens to me too just on my forehead.  So I mix my foundation with some moisturizer and apply it to the problem spot.  Put less makeup on that spot because the makeup makes it more obvious.  You also might want to go a few days without makeup and just wear moisturizer to even out your skin.  It way be irritated from wearing makeup all the time. Also make sure you wash your face every night and don't sleep with your makeup on.

7It1K9ijaa	That wasn't very smart.  but, I am not here to lecture you on that.  Clean it 2 to 3 times a day with sea salt soaks.  Make sure the water is lukewarm.|`|faj6WSL8aa	Keep it like dry after showering.  gently rub the corner of the Towel around the holes. Clean with salty water a few times a day, like after showering.  Don't use rubbing alcohol on it, and if it starts to become infected use some neosporin on it.|`|HiuZs5G5aa	Yeah, maybe it will get infected and be a really big problem. Hope that doesn't happen but it could, especially since you did it at your house.|`|6jXuUCdraa	use sea salt to clean it twice a day for a couple of months|`|0fe649625e33ad80a6e3582e8d51f5d2aa	ouch... u shouldve got it done at a tattoo place... cuz they would tell u wat to do after piercing it... but ya it can get infected... but if u use rubbing alchohol or some type of cream... im sure nothing will go wrong. :)|`|MienlIH0aa	you have to rinse it out 2-3 times a day so that means get in the shower and rinse out the hole  it can get infected reallly easy so you have to be careful!
ZBr08VQLaa	umm depends on the shirt u wear but if u can see it u can wear like a white tank top under!|`|eDP3YU5Laa	Yeah.|`|nIflCWKOaa	I have both of those, and they only show when i wear super thin shirts, or a white tank, not so much actual thicker tees.|`|9iphkDSTaa	Yes, you would, if you were wearing a white or beige shirt.    Anything darker than white or beige.. then no.|`|H57vwVT2aa	Any colored bra can be seen though a plain white t-shirt or any shirt with thin material. Thats why people wear camis under stuff so the material is thicker and less transparent. So id imagine you would be fine unless ur wearing a super thin shirt of white t-shirt. And in that case just throw something on under.|`|UA6mt9ESaa	depeneds on what shirt if its like a teeshirt well no but a tight shirt mabey|`|mDt03eXIaa	So cute! Depending on how thick your shirt is (and what color it is)  you might be able to see it... However it's not a super bright color, so I don't think it would be really noticeable. If you're really worried about your bra showing, buy one that's nude colored or just wear a little tank top underneath.

Put your head as close to your toes as you can.  Next, kick your stronger leg over, stretching your leg out, and staying tight will help you.  You'll need to push through your shoulders.  Also go here: http://www.wikihow.com/Do-a-Backbend-Kic...  It'll help.  Good luck to you!  I'm a level 8 gymnast, and I have some experience.   But why did you put this in this section??|`|CFNozZM8aa	Haha believe me I've been there.    So get into your back bend.  It doesn't matter which leg goes first, just whichever one you feel more comfortable with.  Now, kick that leg up and over.  Imagine your kick goes in a sort of rainbow shape and your body follows.  It's all in the momentum.  Once you feel yourself starting to flip over to handstand position, lift the second leg up and it will follow the first one.  You don't really have to worry about the second leg--it just kind of happens.  The main thing is to get enough momentum in your first kick to flip yourself over.    Good luck!
AA12306671	Lucky 7,             Everyone has the same problem during the wintertimes, hun. I'ts merely because the wheather is cold and dry. So our feet do get this way. With mine, what I do is use certain kinds of body wash for my feet during the shower, and while I'm in there I make sure to use my scrubber to get all the dead skin off of my heels as muc as possible while I'm in the shower so it goes down the drain, instead of all over my bathroom rugs. Then, once I'm out of the shower I use those (they look like a wide thick medal cheese grader, with a handle) and little tiny holes in the medal. I'll take a bunch of lotion and just glob up my feet, and begin (as if your filing your nails) start filing my heels. If you have corns you have to really be careful with those however! Get your corn medicine over the counter and put it on after you've filed off all of the dead skin around them. Then take and rub in as much lotion as possible. Then if you need more rub more on your feet. Then like every night thereafter take and rub more lotion on both feet glob it on. Then put socks on over them. You will wake up after about a week of doing this, with nice pedicured looking feet. That is once you clip your toe nails nice and even anyways. Okay I sure do hope I helped you in some way! Good Luck hun!! Oh by the way the thicker the lotion the better, and they do have "Man-Lotion" too for you guys. Or you can even get some like vaseline on those days when you know your just going to be kicking your feet up with some really old slippers you dont care about or else take an old rag and wipe it off when you need to get up enough to slip on those slippers and then  try to put more on, if you know like your going down for a nap or something. Vaseline heals so fast!! I used to put it on my kid when they had scabs, so they'd heal faster and so they wouldn't pick their scabs, so they wouldn't scar. You can also use honey for dry skin or owy's. Cut's or abrasions. And the like. But, it's to sticky like vaseline is.  Well vaseline isn't sticky just gooey..So, remember the thicker the better with the lotions, and vaseline is Fabulous for helping as well,you just have to remember to keep a rag handy when using that and dont put your feet just anywhere without having some rag underneath them also while using vaseline. Okay "Good Luck to you!!!" Smile!!!|`|BsGXHLB5aa	I agree with Monica.  I also do this after bathing.  It has really helped my feet.|`|8afcce307d873a5ec05e82bd377fada8aa	First thing, go to a salon and they will sort it out. They can soak and scrape off all the hard skin. I had it done to me once and it was brilliant! My feet have been better ever since.    Theres a thing you can buy - it's called Newton's Foot therapy Chiropody sponge - its the best pumice stone I've ever used. You just use it with soap (like Dove soap)  and gently rub the hard skin, and then dry and moisturise your feet. My feet are really soft because of it! I swear by it.    http://www.allcures.com/shared/product.a...|`|jF1xH89Caa	Book an appointment for a pedicure that includes a paraffin wax dip.

9e0b3eb053495521ed772cef2058be0faa	6 gauge is fine. I often pierce with a 8 gauge needle with an immediate stretch up to 6 gauge. I wouldn't go any larger to start. You won't loose any tissue with an 8 gauge needle.     In fact, I will be doing the same with my own lobes for a second set of piercings in a few weeks.    For help with stretching:  http://www.articlefit.com/Guide-to-Stret...|`|AaYEgDwWaa	hahaha Dude you want to go to a 00 or a 1/2 and you think a 6g is big.. it's not Im at a 0g now and I really like the size I wanted to go to a 00 or 716  but I might stay at a 0 lol     and anyway, you can get your ears punced with a 6 gauge, it's safe if you take care of it and clean it, I do not recomend you get it pieced right at a 6 gauge, I say get your ears pieced at a 14 gauge at least then go from there     I was at a Noraml size ear ring post which was 18g then I when to a   16g,then a 14, then a 12(smallet gauge jewerly) then a 10g, 8g,6,4,2,0g which is what im at now :) I want to got two more sizes bigger not sure yet though lol
zdMlBTATaa	EW first of all wth do u both have the same hair?? yes i think you should pis* him off more so he can cut it?..second of all, i feel sorry for him..why does he want his hair styled like a girls??  There are deff some weird ppl on this earth..|`|c0uwtsJ5aa	Maybe hes still really embarressed about the fact hes in love/has a gf|`|IuM7rz5Daa	links dont work|`|ohw7oGhhaa	u proably embarrased him...my girl would never play with my hair in front fo my boy|`|pppCE90Naa	you don't have to take that you need to stand up for yourself and say you are not the boss of me
7N7aEE73aa	i had the same problem and then i got this lotion called intensive rescue clinical therapy by vaseline its also unscented i tried a lot of different lotions and most of them broke out my face but this was awesome i just put a pea size amount on my face at night and in about less than a week my dry skin was gonee but i think your dry skin will need more time to heal than just a week|`|Is3pmbbKaa	lotion.|`|MtoIxY6Qaa	i would maybe try a different moisturizer. it could be the one you are using. after a couple of days if your condidtion worsens, i would go see your doctor. he can help, or he can give you a referral to go see a dermatologist.|`|y2X1j7cAaa	oo on your face thats not good i wish i could give you advice but if i was you ask your doc or dermitalogist
XyOsRQvgaa	no, why would i be? i'm sure if i told my friends i was getting extensions they'd go out and get some with me, not look down at me for having fake hair. there's nothing to be ashamed of.|`|7DJkwzKDaa	if i wore them...yes.
91S2vGlAaa	It really doesnt matter which side you get it on.  But if you have a side bang on the left.  You should get your lip pierced on the right.  Vice Versa.  So it balances.  Personally I think you should get a stud first. :]  Also, I think you should just get one lip piercing for now.  Because it would be alot of work to take care of two lip piercings.  Good luck.|`|mDt03eXIaa	First off, I just need to say that lip piercings look really trashy. So if you're going to do it, get a small stud, definitely not a ring. As for the sideyou want it on, just choose which side you'd think it would look best on. If you have side bangs, usually the side your hair parts on looks best.
oOVAbKPmaa	I " Googled " this and discovered that a woman by the name of Kate Lindsay is the designer. If you wanna learn more for yourself, you can do the same...
I6zQeNGzaa	No, Olive oil only moisturizes the hair which prevents breakage and split ends.   If you want increased hair growth take vitamins.|`|AR4pxyRJaa	I know that it makes your hair stronger and smoother but i dont no if it actually increase the hair growth
4TNJcyaqaa	First ones are ok if you are a stripper. Second ones are very nice. I have a pair almost like them with the bow and everything but why are you so interested in womens boots glen?

8YXEeGtlaa	tote|`|oHO0XOQVaa	Backpack, simple and not pretentious in any way, convenient, better for posture/spine over a long period of time.|`|jeDtvychaa	tote, but i wish i had a denim back pack|`|3L9bRmOqaa	When I am not at work, I carry a aatchel.  At work, I always carry a tote.|`|WqI4rCrhaa	I like totes. Coach hand has a medium signature tote that is great for school- very fashion fwd AND practical|`|RzvSo2yUaa	none it's a chiara bag.
jGqZdS2xaa	Well they are both girly but it depends on what kind of bag you want. Coach is more common but Juicy is more rare and casual. Here are my faves of both brands.    http://www.coach.com/content/product.asp...    http://www.juicycouture.com/shoponline/h...    Hope this Helps! |`|jlHCuOSraa	well i love juicy couture and coach is ok but lots of people have coach so if you want to be different i prefer juicy and there really cute but with couch they have a bigger selection of purses...but i say juicy!!!!|`|lI7m7eO7aa	i   Juicy all the way babyy!|`|Cc8ICAXnaa	I'd say Juicy Couture. It's more girly. A little more funky too. I personally don't really like the Coach pattern either.   Betsey Johnson also has some really cute handbags.

oHO0XOQVaa	Definitely a very unique item, you have to have an above average sense of fashion to pull that off.  Like it. Not something to be worn everyday.|`|mzIfJIQVaa	uh not my style...|`|CVQa88Ujaa	This item belongs on the runway not in public.  I don't care for this outfit put some people need to realize what you see on runways shows doesn't neccessarily mean you can wear it in everyday life.  This is a runway item|`|eJrRals7aa	its really cute but i dont like the fur cuffs|`|WSziasfMaa	Its cute, but I think it will get dated pretty quickly.  With that in mind, the price they are asking is outrageous!|`|g5KuIO76aa	not my style, its a little out there....|`|gs8MSMs3aa	its cute, unique|`|O7xYvttsaa	its pretty gaudy, but i guess if it's your style and you can pull it off, then go for it...|`|3dUm2BZIaa	oh my goodness!  that is about THE cutest jacket i've ever seen.  you have to buy it!!  i love you're sence of style!
mAZi1eH7aa	Keep it or grow it longer. The best choices.|`|u7o75zipaa	Your hairstyle is great, I wouldn't change it too much.  You could lighten your hair, I think you'd look great with bright blonde hair.   If you wanted to get something a bit funky, add a streak of bright purple. It looks awesome in blonde hair.  If you've seen the OC, and you've seen Olivia Wilde's character, Alex, you'll know what I mean.  http://www.derok.net/derok/images/entert...  There's a pic of it, but it doesn't look that good there. You can see how the colours go though.|`|1oGBByMIaa	go for it|`|P94EeBvmaa	ur pretty keep ur bangs how they r|`|pbsMWtsdaa	From a guy, I really like your hair the way it is, cute.|`|u4Px5H7Yaa	ur hot|`|cxVmq2kraa	Get full bangs :)|`|hTr1dpTiaa	Your hairstyle is great, but I would dye it more of a light to chocolate brown. It would suit your skin tone better.|`|GPtAQXZPaa	I really have no idea sorry i am a guy but you look very cute the way you are!|`|YWQdsoOMaa	get your hair dyed red with blonde streaks|`|WjEETkWQaa	AFRO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

But yeah i think it would be a cute outfit! =)  You can get some from Hottopic or Somethingg !|`|Z8TDYoQqaa	wear black leggings. black goes with everything.  i suggest you wear heels not boots
r9Vcb9Nraa	Yeah I agree with LoverBoy ^.  I think the best thing in a girl is her personality- that's very important.   Physical features are fine to have. (Sweet eyes)|`|ICTqyQaraa	i hate how you guys check us out but never bother to approach us. best thing are usually the physical features
mDt03eXIaa	I think it's called dermablend makeup. It's waterproof and is used to cover big scars and that sort of thing. I don't know how much it is, but it's worth looking into, I've heard it's great.   If it's almost blended, you could just leave it, it'll probably be dim in there anyway, so it's probably not going to be super noticeable. You;re totally right, nobody's perfect and people should accept you, scars and all, but, remember that all the other Miller girls are likely going to be looking flawless, and if it's something that you;re going to feel self consious about, better off just covering it up. Don't wear panyhose, though. Wear body makeup.
govCVZySaa	I know I've already said the exact same thing on the other question that you posted about the same topic, but here it is again in case you missed the other answer I posted:    I once gave myself some bad layers, and I suggest that you mix all of the layers together. Ya know, like you can even them out a little bit. You could cut parts of the layers in between the levels at a variety of shortness. I hope you understand what I mean. Basically, you can try to blend the layers together to make them less noticeable until they grow out. Good luck!!!|`|iHqcToCaaa	i use wax!|`|heCSHJ13aa	well your username is "emo angel" so I'm thinking that very choppy noticeable layers would actual work even if thats not what you were aiming for.    Look at all the mad rad hair pics. All the scene kids are doing choppy hair that looks like a five year old did it..|`|WkqagpZmaa	well if you want to get a shorter haircut, it sort of depends on your face shape.  but if you go to a hair stylist, they can probably make the layers blend more without taking off too much length.
y5EQiY1Paa	get purple!  i got a purple one and it has stayed in for a long time.  lighter colors like pink fade faster so it depends on how long you want it for|`|JyAUAbsjaa	dark copper red
49740c9daeea677fc86801fb2b3f41deaa	I saw this one at Burlington Coat Factory, for less.    The ones there were real, I have no idea about this one.
igOi7JClaa	wear some skinny jeans! or leggings with a long shirt with a belt..like this...http://images.search.yahoo.com/images/vi...    and another one could be like a shirt with jeans..some cool sneakers..and then like a peace sign necklace...like thishttp://www.polyvore.com/cgi/img-thing?.o...    or wear a shirt and jeans with a scarf..http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yRnRullX5jQ/SK...|`|l9havFTaaa	i know what you mean you could put a nice color shirt under and get some jewelry that goes with the color of the shirt that you have under.And you could wear some nice jeans good luck : )
BsMkp3nPaa	i like it the way you have it in the middle pic. no matter what, keep it long.|`|kA7GEKf7aa	You look fine as is.
HXijJqKmaa	http://www.wetseal.com/catalog/product.j... is all i could find|`|avlVHXDCaa	well you can get it off the intrent  or like at a shoe store or boots store|`|uoMahrymaa	yuk no
KLUppCfyaa	http://i601.photobucket.com/albums/tt99/...    http://i292.photobucket.com/albums/mm40/...|`|yE4dpN2Caa	braid the bits of hair back into a hair tie leave the rest down maybe?  Or braid the front to make a hairband out of your own hair like in this picture http://d.yimg.com/au.yimg.com/util/anysi... try adding things like make a daisy chain and wrap it around a messy bun. It can look really pretty!|`|MTa0p6qzaa	I have a few great ones you could try... hairdos are my hobby, so I hope you enjoy the blog!!!
xGWZ5DfIaa	ye u should but keep it straight|`|RrBdmpa1aa	It would be perfect especially because you have a very articulate kind of a face and it would stand out its gorgeous! good luck|`|7gntdi0uaa	NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!! NOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!! NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!|`|FzKkLF0raa	yes...i think it would look nice:)|`|TRrTunqvaa	i do think it would look nice. and youre like really pretty!|`|AA10641440	First of all, you don't dye hair.  You dye eggs, and you color  hair.  I think your hair will look great a tad bit darker than the picture. It will compliment your complexion and brighten your eyes.
s737Pyzkaa	people see you the same as they see you in a mirror.  i think pictures make people look different sometimes      def mirror.|`|Jqg7Hvfiaa	The mirror is up close, photos have filters and are at a distance.        Stand a few feet away from the mirror, there you go.|`|YuPNVX9maa	sometimes, we subconsciously fix the things we don't like about ourselves. For example, I don't like my ears. When I look at myself in the mirror, though, my brain fixes my ears and makes them look less pointy to myself. Because of this, photos are always pretty accurate.
boqwvEvUaa	i'm about your size, and pacsun jeans fit best for me. hollister is also a good fit, and i also have a pair of size 14 slim abercrombie kids jeans, so you can try them too ;)|`|xM5bwK50aa	lol I have the same problem! I find that Bluenotes and Garage have styles that sit fairly low and are the perfect length. Actually, I found that petite sizes at Walmart fit perfectly (they are a bit higher than the ones at Bluenotes and Garage). Don't ask the sales associates for them; they don't have a petite section so they'll have no idea what you're asking for, but they DO have some petite sizes mixed in with the others. They are great and I wear them all the time.|`|4j6vNSFkaa	you sound like you have my type of body.  haha but i find that pacsun jeans fit me the best. hollister also fits good.|`|XzLUA7ataa	Carefully take your measurements and then visit the website for Lands End (www.landsend.com), or telephone them for help.  They find a pair to fit you, or they'll make them for you.
SMsprdMfaa	I would say not to use chemicals on your hair.Why don't you go for some home remedies. Egg whites, lemon juice, oil massages, reducing stress and diet changes can reduce hair fall and make it healthier. You can find more cheap, effective and natural home remedies for hair loss as well as for healthy hair at http://www.wellnesstalk.org/hairfall.htm...|`|RSDmLgXDaa	use a heat resistance spray or buy them they are prtty cheap|`|kknSPYxKaa	Use a heat protector.  You can't really notice that the heat protector is working when you use it, but the kind I use sure does make your hair soft.  I use VO5 Heat Defence plus conditioning spray and 24 HR anit- frizz.  Great stuff, and the smell is amazing.  I got it for $3 at Wal- Mart about a month ago, and remember, a little goes a long way with any heat protector.|`|HRvPoQzKaa	Even if you use heat protectors, your hair is STILL gonna be damaged.    The best thing to do is NOT straighten it.|`|Y39y6vayaa	im not sure if there is a really good way. i would say::    use a shampoo that changes your hair. idk how to explain it. but sun silk has some stuff. there is like different shampoos depending on what you want. i will give you the link in a sec.   http://www.gethairapy.com/products.php  this is the product i was talking about!! ^^  go to the purple one that is called straight to perfection.

You look very beautiful on the photo as well.|`|58WCrqe1aa	No. The other one would though.|`|FSpL3s1raa	Yes I think you would look good blond.  I think it would be an improvement.  I personally would have a professional bleach it really light blond. I don't mind the damage that bleach does because I think it gives hair volume (maybe I'm a weirdo).  It would also look cute to get a lot of golden highlights.  Have fun!|`|VHi7Kaokaa	noooooo. your eyebrows are way to dark  i know alot of people with natural dark hair and they dyed it blonde.  it looks terrible, leave your hair how it is, its gorgeous!|`|35PQUYqraa	nooooooooooooo|`|NKE6Apz9aa	you should dye it blonde underneath your hair. but remember once you dye it you have to keep dyeing it or the top of your head will be one color and the rest of it will be a different color.|`|GNPCDSSsaa	i think you should get blonde hilights!!!

Like i dont know how to explain it. But it's that bump, with the rest of the hair just wear it down. I really like that. :)|`|iHSj8iUNaa	I no this will look good do a choco brown then get a fade down from chin under length!!!!!|`|ADmvf3FJaa	Although I can't see your pict, just by what you said, i would advice you to layer your hair. That way, when you cheer your hair will bounce and have that preppy look also, if you tie up your hair, you will have the layered shape and it will look really nice.  Plus you could add some highlights to your hair, brown is such a nice colour, just add some other brownish, gold tones.
kSFhItzkaa	well they might tell you not to wear up-do's because you're going to have to pin the cap on to the side of the hair or something but  use something simple and elegant though|`|NWH4pySHaa	http://www.seventeen.com/archive/hair-sk...

JyAUAbsjaa	Your hair is beautiful, but if I were you I would add some layers and face framing along with a side swept bang|`|4KOuL7mZaa	hmmm i would go a little short like maybe to your shoulders and then flip it out. that would be really cute!|`|OtDfY391aa	I would get some layers and a side fringer (aka bangs or somthing?)  keep the length, it's better like that.  That's wht I'm trying to get my hair like, needs to grow tho :(    Oh well, Good Luck x
er2H1gQ1aa	Could you dress as like a rap cowboy?  Like a cowboy hat and boots, but with lots of bling and baggy pants or something like a rapper.    An ugly sweater should be easy to find.  Search in your parent's closet.  If that fails check out a thrift store and buy the ugliest one you can find for cheap!  Shouldn't be hard.      For underwater day you should wear swimming flippers and a snorkel!  Walk around all day like you're swimming!    Should be lots of fun!!|`|nXah8a5uaa	for the country/rap day: like cowboy boots, jeans, and a plaid shirt..or really baggy jeans and a bandanna?  ugly sweater day: idk haha, an ugly sweater.  underwater day: full scuba gear =)  stoplight: well i don't know what are you?    oh and mardi gras beads are always good|`|2mbELVTOaa	You can have    1.Crazy hair day  2.twins day  3.backwards day  4.theme days(70's day,beach day,)  5.character day     hope I helped.

Necklace...  http://shop.nordstrom.com/S/3012089?Cate...    Bag...  http://shop.nordstrom.com/S/3001977/0~23...   (In any color!!)|`|OxwWclcmaa	It's very pretty. That would make a great outfit but I don't think I would wear it to the prom? For mine I had a floor length gown. I'd want something really stunning and not in black, a different bold colour maybe. But that outfit looks great too if that's what would suit you|`|WSziasfMaa	Its really pretty, but I don't know if its formal enough for the prom.|`|KjF0p72naa	Looks great if you go to the club (not recommended) but not for prom!    Go for formal-black tie|`|M1vcUoo5aa	its gorgeous!|`|ucZOCMyAaa	I hate it. it's horrible. The bottom needs to be hugging the legs, it just looks like she went shopping at the goodwill and that is the only size they had.|`|58xXEE6Faa	i would take you to prom in that!|`|praNSGXhaa	i LOVE it!!!! its soooo pretty!!! i like the shoes too!!! :D|`|sGa0dahuaa	ahh it's alright, the shoes are adorable (pricey)  the dress is more for going clubbing.|`|34K0QIzTaa	its pretty!! and short!!|`|tv5YpG8saa	It's cute, but for prom, I think you should wear something more poofy, but that's just me|`|0AQF8pnKaa	the shoes are perfect for the prom, make sure you don't fall down when you dance in them though, the heels are like towers!  however, the dress seems a little too casual, it would be better for a winter formal or something. i would suggest getting a dress a little longer and maybe even floor length, those are the more prom like dresses.|`|eJrRals7aa	i like it, its really cute, but im not sure if it is formal enough for prom|`|2ja54L20aa	As a general rule of thumb, do not wear jersey to prom. I know that basically all prom dresses are basically incredibly tacky, but keep looking. The Louboutins are killerrssss. If you/your parent's credit card can honestly afford them :))) go for those.   but as for the bcbg dress, keep looookingggg. it's more of a homecoming dress.
jUGuElKlaa	The second, fourth and fifth work best for your face (round faces look best under square sunglasses).  Purple seems to work for most asian girls I know.|`|wbkzpYhRaa	You want rectangular glasses to offset and flatter your face.
4j6vNSFkaa	i loveeee scarfs!  i like to wear them with just a solid colored long sleeve shirt. rue 21 has really cute scarfs and so does pacsun.  and uggs would look great!|`|yWJrGv9naa	if i have a rele bright scarf, with a nice unique pattern i wear it with a black, gray, or wht shirt, so the scarf pops out... i like pairing them with cardigans and turtle necks, but thats just me :P|`|YGMlocIVaa	i would suggest you to wear scarves with a simple plane shirt, so the scarf can stand out in the outfit  =D|`|KWl605JTaa	my favorite outfit with a scarf:  plain white tee, scarf, and dark skinny jeans.  for the shoes, converse, or flats.    another outfit you could do is a long sleeve v neck with the scarf, and some skinnys|`|XPfM5Bhwaa	like a plain solid color short with pants and one of those scarfs    super cute|`|jmHnf7wHaa	You can wear scarves with tank tops jackets it almost looks good with ne thing!
WSziasfMaa	Go to a professional at a salon who is trained to get the desired results of clients.|`|UNspaI3vaa	no no get a brownish hair color with orange highlights or just find the color at target and do it your self not that hard|`|wsQwfKn4aa	Use sun in. (available at wal mart, very cheap). Buy about 3 bottles. Just saturate your hair and let it air dry. Keep a close eye on the color. Then saturate and let dry again and again until it reaches exactly the right shade.
3pcwIUBlaa	it might grow back thicker because when you get a haircut, your hair grows back thicker. im not sure but try going to a few beauty websites to make sure before you do it|`|yqKi9l9laa	it would grow back thicker and darker. just like any other body hair. i would just bleach it so its hardly visible!
846222d773f0bef684c3038836729b6caa	My brother had this issue    1. exfoliate - exfoliate regularly! By removing the top layer of dead epidermis cells, you will make your skin appear smoother & get pores clean.  you need to be using a soap that is sent free (this can cause breakouts) but in addition, use a great scrub that has salt, sugar or ground nutshell. If this isnt economically an option, my dermatologist said "nothing safely exfoliates better than a 100% cotton white t-shirt!" this would be easy to use on your back! And you wont over scrub!    2. lay off the lotion - for a week see if your body can just deal with being clean and oil free to heal the acne you have     3. Go to bed clean- you skin needs rest just like your brain does! Better to shower and get into nice clean sleeping clothes and bed to heal~ If you can sleep without a shirt, even better your skin can breathe!    4. dont over use chemicals - these will still be around if the first few things dont work out. Try to go natural! If your back doesnt want to cooperate THEN try over the counter acne creams and meds. Anything with 2% salicylic acid will cure most acne.. and is available in any grocery store in most acne products!    good luck!|`|mMvEEZ3oaa	if you use a backpack switch to a side bag and if your a guy when then try not to use it to much    DO NOT SCRATCH OR PICK WHATEVER YOU DO TRUST ME I KNOW!!    drink lots of water|`|5nfqY9T7aa	Neutrogena has a soap for that.  If it's very little, I'm sure you can use the same spot-treatments you use on your face.|`|O3i7zJB2aa	There is something called benzoyl peroxide you can buy it at the chemist. It comes in either 2.5, 5 or 10% concentration. You rub it in til you can't see it any more. It might sting a bit at first, but after a couple of days of using it you will see a difference.|`|d0B3geJNaa	got off the steriods. lol jk  if you are a big sweater then there isnt much you can do. if you dont sweat a lot them there is a cream.|`|STSsThW7aa	Well this might sound crazy and against the dermatologists, but I used to have back acne, I popped them all, and unlike the face, they didn't come back. I use Olay body wash, and my back is silky smooth. Maybe you should try a non-comedogonic moisturizer if it's terrible! Good luck! (:|`|S730dpLfaa	Read this blog before taking any action, your answer is right here:  http://finallyigotridofacne.wordpress.co...  Thanks to this blog, it helped me a lot to find the best method.  Hope this helps|`|eMFwMQGHaa	Haha, backne.
E4pXTZ5Naa	That's a brand made exclusively for JCPenney. You can try their catalog or website. If you do find it on there, go into the store and have an associate order it for you as they will waive the shipping and override the price to the sale that they are having on their Genna De Rossi handbags in the store at that time.
3yacqUltaa	The orange Cover girl Lash Blast. It has a ton of bristles on the brush and it comes out with perfect lashes, no clumps at all!

You can usually get cheap testers to try out but they all work great on me :)      you could also go to your local store./ cosmetics store and ask one of the assistants if she can advise you. they're usually very happy to and you usually get free testers :) and your makeup applied professionally      hope this helps  x|`|IzRk1mZQaa	I have NO lashes and I have tried everything, even paying $40 a tube for mascara at department stores, and by total freak accident I tried Maybelline Waterproof Great Lash, and I will never use anything else!!!!|`|puVdvis2aa	i prefer to use the Cover Girl PROfessional... but that's just me... it works best with my eyelashes... it makes them look fuller and longer and more natural. sure it is a little spendy, but it works beautifully!    good luck on your search!|`|ueE47t8saa	Avon super zoom. you can only buy it online or in a catalouge.. i would put my life onn it    youravon.com/kyrstenshedd|`|3ec28def142fbd75510736434c5eb960aa	Dior show is the Best, go try it|`|HLMzKR53aa	mac "zoom"    its only about $12. i love it|`|w9FoIUFXaa	I like Great Lash.

It gives lashes length. Comes in different colors, too.|`|3rFEsXBlaa	I like 3 of them.  The cheapest is Maybelline Collasal Volume Express Mascara.  Then I like Clinique High Impact Mascara.

I love all kinds of makeup but I had to choose just one type of makeup to wear, I would choose mascara if it was avon super zoom|`|vQohjt3iaa	I use Almay(:|`|64b5ddb91a78f9cb5f26f04d8b418497aa	if you are looking for volume and length i most definitely recommend:     Maybelline New York XXL Extensions     im looking down at my tube of it right now! it has sides 1 and 2, first the white then the black. apply the white for volume and thickness and the black for the color and length. and what i like most about it is it doesnt get chunky, and it actually lasts all day! compared to other mascaras that clump up, ware off and get limpy in a few hours :( I LOVE THIS STUFF I KNOW YOU WILL TOO!|`|xQwmHlU6aa	Loreal telescopic is awesome..best I've ever used..EVER!..maybelline great lash is also good and a classic (its the one with the pink and green bottle) both are available at stores like walgreens,wallmart,cvs and rite aid..|`|AA12062811	The orange Cover girl Lash Blast one....  and the pink and green bottle Maybelline...|`|1TDpp6ioaa	extreme black Lash Maxxx from Rimmel (the pink and black tube) once you have the hang of the brush it provides realllllly long lashes and if you build on it with more mascara then you will get volume too :D it's my fave mascara and i have never used another one since. (ps, no clots with this mascara cos of it's comb like brush)
zQrEhWAKaa	looks like you will be fine for the dance. The only thing that i could say is to drink lots of water because it actually helps your skin to be nicer|`|jGqZdS2xaa	Well it sounds like you are already set! And I know you dont want comments about the tanning salon but tanning is sooo expensive! If you have been doing it that much anyway then you should be tan,and to make sure you stay tan then you can buy self tanner. Its like $6 and its called Olay Touch of Sun Lotion.    Hope this helps!

3dUm2BZIaa	my advice:  do it yourself!    that way it is customized the way YOU want it and you don't have to spend money on it.  also, it would be really fun and creative and i doubt nobody else would have anything like that:)    you can buy fabric paint at local art store and you can also reuse the paint to splatter something else.    have fun!!:)

I6zQeNGzaa	Olive oil is tough to get out once it's soaked into the hair.   I would recommend shampooing .|`|5ta5yyWSaa	You need to wash out olive oil very thoroughly and more than once. It will attract dirt and pollutants and look greasy which is far worse than using non organic shampoo.|`|ee74f3aa67efefa8e49e21be6f4ec61faa	Okay, think about it.....you are putting OIL on your hair.  Your hair is going to be very oily and greasy.  If you just rinse, even if you rinse well, you are still going to have oily-greasy hair.  You have to shampoo or you are going to end up with a greasy-oily mess!|`|HnTpvVEEaa	you have to rinse the olive oil out with shampoo you have to do this because if you dont your hair will be greasy! although olive oil treatments are great for your hair keep it up!!

X2lesqhRaa	Heres a few tips...  1:Wash your scalp with conditioner, do not use shampoo.You can conditioner wash once or twice a week.  2: Never ever brush your hair, A wide comb or your hands are fine Just steer clear of all brushes.  3:Give your hair time to adjust. It takes 2-4 weeks for your hair to adjust to the no shampoo. It may even look worse at first. Hair is a long-term project and it may take a couple weeks for it to regain its health after being stripped of moisture for years by shampoo  4:Do the final rinse of your hair with cool or cold water. This will decrease frizz and add shine. Leave some conditioner in your hair, especially in dry sections like the ends. It is fine to run your fingers through your hair gently, but do not comb your hair after this point.  5: It's ok to use some products. Look for ones with no alcohol. Use them while your hair is wet only. Dont overload. Steer clear of as many chemicals as you can, try organic substances.  6:Get your hair thinned at a good solan. get layered haircuts. Ask the stylist for tips.  7:My favorite and most effectful. Hair oil you can find it in various international stores. If you only shop at department stores look for baby oil, will work just as good.  8:Use heat protecters before flat ironing wont damage at all and keep the frizz away.  9:Braid your hair before you sleep will keep the frizz away  10:Just tye it back, its a great times for a new style, but only if it looks good on you.  11: If you can find any, it'll be awesome. Frizz-ease (Its part of the John Frieda collection)  12: Dont be too afraid of volume Some people would kill for curly, volumized hair.  13: Suggested brands Chi and Bedhead  You can get all of this in a very reasonable price. Chi and bedhead are american brands, but I'm sure you can find some there. If not, use sunsilk!!!|`|sOYUCM1vaa	I had frizzy, boofy hair too. I used all sorts of moisturizers, including Joico and whilst these were no doubt nourishing for my hair THEY DID NOT STRAIGHTEN IT FLAT. I wanted smooth and sleek. The only thing that actually really, really will do this is GHD straightening irons. Most reputable hairdressers have them. Or look on e-bay, as they have them too!  In Australia they retail for about $250.00 They should last a long time. Dry your hair off after your shower, with your hair dryer. Face the nozzle in a downwards angle while your drying (this all helps to create the 'flater' outcome). Then, section of and straighten with the GHD's. I know it's a bit tedious, but it will de-frizz your hair! You'll get used to it and become quicker at doing your own hair. I would've classed my old hair as 'problem hair' as no product alone would give me the results I wanted...even though the shop assistant said it would. My hair is thick and long, easily past my shoulders and it now takes me 40 minutes from wet to finish. After that, the GHD's will hold the flattness for 4 days, when you can wash it again. Just remember though, once you wet it, you have to GHD again.
N7mgfDxnaa	bootcut!|`|oHO0XOQVaa	Straight or bootcut. Definitely not skinny or flare.|`|lNDKI4Yfaa	Dark-rinse straight or bootcut jeans would balance out your full hips.    Try these? Or some similar to these:    http://www.ae.com/web/browse/product.jsp...    http://www.ae.com/web/browse/product.jsp...|`|ilaAcjGvaa	flared jeans aren't very flattering. on a pear shape, too tight of skinny jeans won't look good because it cuts off at your anckle becaues its too small to go any longer which makes your legs look shorter and bigger. a mix between skinny jeans and straight are perfect. also dark wash jeans make your butt and legs look smaller. :)|`|CiBq4WfZaa	i would say you wear a straight leg jean or a boot cut jean
N7OQhGDsaa	this is what i would wear;    leather leggins with an altered old school band tee a leather jacket and layered chain necklaces with a pair of grey boots.    as for makeup;  i would do smokey-ish eye but try to still keep it natural looking.    and hair;  tease and make it look messy     optional;  huge bold sunglasses      hope i helped.  :)|`|CvBJ3RKPaa	. . .and they say American education doesn't do its job!

N7OQhGDsaa	uhm, i dont think it matters where you get your lip pierced since it equally hurts on either left right or middle.    but apparently it doesnt hurt at all.  :)

The t-shirt should have designs on it(i think) and wear ballet flats or a low show (no heels) hmmm i guess it doesn't matter what color pink..just don't wear a red or pink top (too matchy) your hair if long: half ponytail, just down( curl it or straighten it) side ponytail.... if medium then pigtails, half ponytail, ponytail(side) leave it down and curl or straighten it...short: clip it back, style it in a way that complements you face, straighten it
yENww2b0aa	i work in a salon myself and thread al the time..the best way to reduce pain is havin a shower or a bath prior to threading as ur pores will open reducing pain.make sure your beauty therapist applies a soothing gel before threading..good luck.
GC37jW6Gaa	I like Hollister better.  Firstly: The prices are much better than A&F  Secondly: The stuff is the exact same as A&F except with a different logo. They are owned by the same company.  Thirdly: The atmosphere in the store is better. The live feed to Huntington beach, the laid back surfer feel, and how when you walk into the store you don't feel bad because the workers don't stare you down just because they don't think you are as pretty as them. The employess are always nicer to me there.    I also prefer to shop at abercrombie kids because again, the exact same stuff, better prices and the employees are way nicer.|`|NpJk2Heraa	Abercrombie....but then again hollister cause they have more stuf to chose and their stuff goes on sale first...|`|x0gquSCsaa	i like hollister better but like they are both owned by the same company|`|ZoJqQD9zaa	hollister|`|RotTGeNiaa	Neither.  But if u have top choose between the two then probably not hollister because they are welll they sell for WAAAAY to much.  I mean one hoodie is like 60 bucks!|`|3d4cfee2d6c183eded131290f960d689aa	neither.|`|tre5A9w9aa	neither. they sell expensive clothes that can be bad quality(like the destroyed jeans). i perfer pac sun and delias because they are semi resonable|`|LiOOF1Plaa	Abercrombie has been around for over 100 years....Hollister has been around for what- three years? I predict you will find Hollister stuff in thrift shops soon......just wait for this trendy brand(Hollister) to go cheap...|`|jSOq81bzaa	if ur looking for cheap clothes go to ur local food depot or u can go to the homeless shelter and get them for free|`|sWYYm2Qxaa	they're both meh..too preppy...bit if i had to pick it would be hollister because its like the same clothing, just cheaper :)    please answer mine if you can :) http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...|`|KzicHA3Yaa	i like hollister better. :]]|`|lK6S5cGSaa	Hollister=Cheaper  Abercrombie-Overrated|`|c3adf6eebebb43dc6a353232fb6a25d9aa	Both are owned by the same company, but Abercrombie has been around longer. Hollister was opened to show their competition (American Eagle & Aeropostale) that they can open a cheaper store & still do better business. So, Hollister is cheaper, but Abercrombie is better, imho. :)|`|b2694fb134bd99af7c220f1712c86d2daa	i love both .|`|4j6vNSFkaa	they are good stores but both have high prices.|`|aPdKEKyeaa	i personally like abercrombie better because they have some rele cute stuff  but hollister is a tad cheaper  sooooo....yea =]|`|g5KuIO76aa	hollisters cheaper, but i prefer designer clothes|`|tGe1wMyjaa	Well i think that both stores are preppy and bad.......both are expensive but i would choose Ambercrombie because itshas cute clothes for low prices. Alot of them are preppy! Hope I helped...a bit?|`|2wZcWe98aa	Well there owned by the same company.  But personally Hollister.  But i guess it all depends on how old you are and such.  Most younger kids like abercrombie, then once you get like a little older most like Hollister, then switch to abercrombie & fitch :]
S1KINm2Paa	Change the pants to some dark wash skinny jeans. Because uggs look fabulous with dark was skinny jeans! : ) And change your shirt more to a blouse. Don't wear just a tank top. Maybe something like this?    http://www.hollisterco.com/webapp/wcs/st...    OR    http://www.ae.com/web/browse/product.jsp...|`|984bfc60ae0a13ac2b2ae06e4e42f640aa	If you want to look unindividual, then wear as much hollister as possible.|`|Azengymsaa	I would never wear hollister.
JyAUAbsjaa	Sally Beauty Supply sells them|`|4j6vNSFkaa	Go to Ulta|`|2oN7WrVKaa	This one is great, but also quite expensive.  Its really tiny!  3/4 of an inch!  http://www.misikko.com/chi-volumizing-ir...|`|lpR9XLYbaa	Well yeah..just try ebay for cheaper. The smallest size available is 6 inches long. But if that's too small, key in either '1" flat iron' or '3/4" flat iron on ebay.
SnTF9otLaa	Sedu works wonders for my hair and my hair is VERY thick and VERY curly but after i straighten it with the sedu stuff it's very silky and light feeling. Lol it's such a coincidence because i just used it like to days ago on my hair and then you ask a question Lol but everyone noticed the difference because it's the change is so dramatic  ~AtL's FiNeSt|`|DlMsJPwUaa	I dont own either but Paul Miotchell is supposed to be really good for your hair and Sedus make it soft and perfect looking.
heCSHJ13aa	I hope someone on here really does have one for you....but I've never heard of a hairspray with all that good stuff (wtf, there SHOULD be one though). a big ingredient in hairspray is alcohol which dries out your hair a ton, but I have heard there are alcohol free hairsprays, so if you can't find one with vitamins and protein, then I'd say at least try using an alcohol free one.     Hemp is an amazing material and can pretty much be made into anything, even hair products.

41ac7d9d52a54e7a6b648bd7d6d7d8ffaa	Selecting different styling and cuts is fun to learn.  When you get     old enough for college it is not a bad experience to have in your     brief.  Modelling lets you see that wigs, and kid health temporary     colors are not toxic and fun to try.  Though it is your hair so keep it     in the pro direction with quality advice.  This is an area that true     investment is involved and not available from services.  No one     except old school health expertise and true friend concerns will give     you free advise. If you have need to dress up, do not worry about     when.  As you mature you hopefully will have great friends and add     personal grooming upgrades.|`|RQiUz4adaa	i think it is a good idea. I have the same hair type as you and I have side bangs. It also depends on your face shape but most people look good with them. I usually just straighten my bangs and not the rest of my hair. It reduces the amount of work you have to do. I think you should totally go for it and if you don't like them they will grow out.|`|aQ8utQOeaa	It would probably be hard to style with your hair type but it is possible.|`|DjQrJH8baa	it kind of depends on your face shape and forehead size|`|4j6vNSFkaa	if you straighten your hair enough it usually thins it out. and i dont know it all depends on what shape face you have also.  and sometimes side bangs dont always work with all people, they dont go over far enough.|`|8IYZvLLjaa	You should get them.

ADkusTVXaa	Here's some good ideas;;    Things you need:    ? Curling Iron  ? Brush  ? Hairspray  ? Blow Dryer  ? Shampoo  ? Conditioner  ? Bobby Pins  ? Hair Protection Products (Optional)    Steps:    1. Hop in the shower and wash your hair completely.    2. Find a blow dryer and blow dry your hair completely.    3. Turn on the curling iron, and while you are waiting you can brush your hair.    4. Take a curling iron and begin to curl your hair. Hold it at the ends of your hair for about 20-45 seconds each.    5. Once your done curling your hair, take your bangs and then part your hair to the left.    6. Spray a finishing coat of hairspray around areas of your hair to keep it in place.    7. Make sure to turn off your curling iron and then you are done! Enjoy.    or...    Things you need:    ? Shampoo  ? Conditioner  ? Blow Dryer  ? Straightener  ? Heat-protecting/anti-frizz serum  ? Brush  ? Comb  ? One Elastic    Steps:    1. Go ahead and wash your hair with shampoo and conditioner if you haven't already. When you're rinsing out your conditioner, it helps if you use a wide-tooth comb and comb your hair while rinsing.    2. Before blow drying your hair, make sure you put in a heat protector or anti-frizz serum in your hair to make it more manageable. Blow dry your hair so that there is no dampness to it.    3. Brush your hair. After blow drying it, straighten your hair so that it has a slight curve under at the ends. You can achieve this with the brush or by curving your straightener then brushing under at the ends.    4. Take the top part of your hair, brush it and pull it back. Put it up high with an elastic, and you're done! You can spray it with hairspray if you like, but it doesn't really matter with this 'do. If you have any bangs, make sure you push them to the front|`|WGzJUSefaa	Check out this site!

njhKtCTKaa	Could be alot of things, i have naturally curly hair, so my whole head does it, plus i live in Louisiana, so that adds to the problem.  Do you dye your hair much, that could have something to do with it, as far as layering if your hair is naturally curly, i would def recommend it, its one of the better looks for curly or frizzy hair, but dont get the layers too short.  I usually style my hair by putting all my products in it, then letting it air dry, have to stay away from hair dryers, and try not using a brush too much, use picks, or thick combs, it really helps.      Good luck hun ;)|`|x92eQyvraa	all i can say is that straightners dont work

heCSHJ13aa	It doesn't really work without the sun. I'm sure ppl think the citric acid will help the color get a lil more blonde but it won't without the sun.    You'll probably get ppl saying to use "sun in" which you spray in your hair and can just blow dry (or go in the sun) after spraying it on your hair but pleeease don't use it because it's awful for your hair when you want to dye it later down the road.|`|PhYRiW7iaa	the only way i know of is when you have blonde hair you cut a lemon in half and rub it on your hair and it makes it blonder but i always went into the sun afterwards so idk if it will work without|`|AA10641440	You don't.

FSpL3s1raa	I have heard of AA before, not necessarily paired with a 40 though.  I think there are some misconceptions about how the whole cup-size thing works.  Of course B is bigger than A and C is bigger than B, etc., but there is a huge difference between a 32AA and a 40AA.  So while AA might suggest very small breasts, it might still make sense for your breasts to be fairly large and still be considered AA, because of the 40 part.    I have pretty average sized breasts for my thin frame (looking at me you would probably estimate a "small or average B"), so I have always shopped for 32 B or 34 B bras, but they never really fit me correctly.  Finally, when I was bra shopping braless, in a tube top, a Victoria's Secret employee insisted that I let her help me.  She suggested I try a 32 C.  I was sure it would not fit because I would never describe my breasts as C cups.  But sure enough, it did.     If I were you, I would let a Victoria's Secret employee help you find a good fitting bra.  It's worth the time and money. :)|`|AiNaL4jVaa	i have heard of AA but u have to go to a special store to get them.  I wear a 30A and im like medium sized so AA is probably about right.

Seems kind of childish.    -Yellow  Well, I'm usually obsessed over yellow, but that yellow is a bit dull and it wouldn't be anything somebody would notice, it would just make you look kind of boring.    -Dark blue  I would go with this one. It's classy, and I find it the most mature of those colors. Since it's a navy-ish color, it'll most likely go with any color.

The orange brand color. It will give the best effect to flips. Try it, it's great. It's usually at any store, especially Wal-mart, Target. Any kind of grocery store, and department store, or malls. Plus, try the shampoo and conditioner.    I hope this helps. I had the same problem, but then when my mother bought it for me, I stopped having my problem, and I was satisfied.
1LGUGjHuaa	Yes they are, they have been around for a bit now but you can still buy them or update ones you already own with spring/summer pieces. A high waist skirt with a floral blouse tucked in is a key look for this season, or try a feminine soft lace. remember if you wear high waist you must tuck your top in! And to keep it bang on trend don't be afraid of colour! Bright clashing girly colours were all over the catwalk, especially with designers like Luella. Bright oranges, pinks and lilacs are all key this season, so any of those colours will work in a skirt. If a bright orange skirt is a bit too bold for you then I recommend you try some brightly coloured tights. Any colour will work with a dark coloured skirt and as its still a little cold outside, you'll keep those legs warm as well as looking fashionable!|`|pC2jGRKraa	High waisted came in about couple of years back, this season its only really acceptable with block colours.|`|GWfl2elyaa	As for my research, 70's fashion is one of the prior fashion this year and high waisted skirts is included on 70's fashion. Maybe try to mix and match and be careful on the color combination.|`|TtOCh3JSaa	Yes and so are chunky waist belts. The more 80s looking the better.|`|jX4Byb6Eaa	yes, they've BEEN in fashion. i wish that denim skirts would make a come back|`|VHQ7l1fMaa	yes.|`|IPRVpsnAaa	I think so, but some mags say no, but i think they r, atleast Im going to make them in!!!! :-)|`|HKNbWjtOaa	i hope so, my wardrobe's full of them!|`|HVu5YGQuaa	they were never in fashion|`|ro3X9fs3aa	yes they are|`|SuD5CjGraa	of course they are. they will be more popular in 2012.|`|boqwvEvUaa	yes, but make sure you have the body shape to pull them off before you try wearing them ;)
81ocas2Baa	i'd go realllly dark brown so its almost black but not quite.  dont bleach it because it turns this awful yellow color that doesnt suit anyone. but personally i like your hair in the first picture, you're cute ;)|`|ANf5FzTXaa	I think it would be better if natural. God gave you what you have and be satisfied with it and be thankful. Mine is black and before i like blonde hair but i realized that this is exactly me^_^.|`|XWk7TDYTaa	i like natural guys, dont dye it at all.|`|tPIerWh6aa	i'd go with brown
W50zzBQoaa	what you need to do is go to a salon and ask them to styale your hair. THIN IT OUT ALOT. and then layer it. if you get a lot of layers and thin in out it wont do that. then straighten it for the day and use some hair serum before and after starightening your hair. it'll make a huuuuugggge difference.and if by doing this your hair wont be as voluminous as you want then you can tease it (back comb it) and then hair spray it.        your hair will look awsome
IPRVpsnAaa	I'd wear brown pants, and a white shirt. 4 shoes id wear mayb some of those riding boot things, and a colorful purse/clutch  -OR-  Id wear brown pants white shirt, and black flats or silver or gold (up 2 u) and a colorful purse/clutch    ALWAYS WEAR A BRIGHT CLUTCH WITH ANY OUTFIT YOU WEAR ONLY NETURAL COLORS!!!|`|Ijej3WJsaa	i never wear black and brown but that's just me. i'd wear a plain white shirt.|`|koX1ymC0aa	eww NEVER wear brown and black|`|AA11482835	Don't listen to what anybody tells you, black does NOT go with every color. Black goes with certain shades of every color but not every one.    If you can, the best colors to wear with brown are white and pale pink.|`|SHdrYV0Naa	a nice pink top and brown pants would look really good on you, and would very much work with your hair color too|`|De0p3aP9aa	off white perhaps?|`|GquZxt5iaa	Wear white.
IP8vzLuBaa	Most websites ask you if you have a gift when you are check out,  If they don't ask, check to see if they have any way to email someone from the company to ask how to use it or a phone number to ask.  Good luck.|`|M1vcUoo5aa	well i guess check out then ..|`|pGF6Xdghaa	JUST GO TO THE  WEBSITE AND WHEN YOU CHECK OUT IT SHOULD ASK FOR YOUR METHOD OF PAYMENT...  SO BUY THE CLOTHES IN YOUR ONLINE CART AND THEN THERE SHOULD BE LIKE A CHECKOUT BUTTON..  : )|`|hcupLFCVaa	I would assume that when you go to checkout there will be an option that you either select or check saying that you have a gift card.  Otherwise, you may just have to type in the numbers as if you were using a regular credit card.|`|u5gMcEALaa	when you go to check out you type in the code on the back of the card, just like a credit card! I hope that helps!|`|QyypUfuMaa	i think that you have to have everything in your bag first. then when you put the payment you put the code for your gift cards :]    have fun shoppingg :]]]
sHUnctqIaa	My husband has the same problem, his skin is very sensitive and creams don't help. The day he shaves, I save the coffee filter from our morning pot of coffee and roll it up and wrap it in a paper towel (wet grounds and all) and stick it in the fridge or freezer. After he shaves he puts it on his face like a compress, the cool temperature and the caffeine from the coffee sooth his skin and take away any pain or redness. He does this for about 15 minutes then rinses his face with cold water.     To prep your skin to handle the shave better, wash morning and night with a cream cleanser, use an exfoliating scrub 2-3 times a week and put on a men's face lotion every morning. Doing this will help your skin adjust to the shave, and should prevent any pains. Be sure to use a face lotion again after you shave.
OcHJtS2Naa	I think you'd look good with the piercing that goes on your top lip.  I think it might be called the monroe or something but I could be totally off!

rkoxkAPDaa	TJ Maxx is an overstock store. If they get overstock from say, Dillards, then yeah they will have Ed Hardy sunglasses. Usually their sunglasses are unimpressive. I'd wait for a sale at Dillards. I got Ralph Lauren's for $22. Gonga.|`|4j6vNSFkaa	some might.  but ive never seen them.|`|yql9cGBtaa	nope they just sell the shirts from what i've seen

HHyny0JSaa	Any piercing can be rejected, even if you've been pierced before with no problems.Usually with lip piercings you tend to see posts, but even if you have a ring it just sounds like the jewelry is moving through your skin. It may be red and hurt because you keep touching it. You should avoid touching a new piercing as much as possible with the exception of cleaning it. You should always be able to feel the back of the jewelry on your lip, if you cant then it might be inside your lip and then you have a problem. When you are first pierced they will put in a larger piece of jewelry because of swelling. After the initial healing is done you can go back in and have it changed down to a smaller ring that will hug your lip more and not move around as much. But if you ever have any doubt or questions about your piercing you should go back to the place you had it done as soon as possible and have them take a look at it. In the meantime... quit playing with it.The more you touch it, the more you risk infection and scarring
UHpqcG9Vaa	more like a poser. seriously i know your still a kid and you don't understand what labels are. just stop labeling yourself! you are yourself. how the hell should we know what you are? because of your style? emo? do you cut yourself? do you listen to goth or rock music? do you like being preppy? why do people make these lables exit? am i made out of wax? dude! be yourself.
aCCUQQu4aa	Facebook is a little more adult, and you can choose what apps you would like to see when going to a contacts page. My opinion?  Facebook, hands down.  It is a lot cleaner looking and easier to keep track of events.  Myspace just has too many adds.|`|i1T8yKhpaa	myspace:)|`|huHOpRLLaa	well it depends what your friends have i guess  i only know like 20 ppl on facebook and i have like 400 friends on myspace  but i personally like myspace better  u should have one anyway  = )|`|UnMLa6r8aa	i think that facebook is better than myspace because only people you know can see your information. Well in myspace you can set your profile as private also. In myspace, you probably will get random friend request and random messages like hey cutie how old are you lol.  i personally prefer facebook.|`|yo30g3pPaa	I havw 1200 friends.  Myspace is better because you can make your profile cute, there are more people.|`|u4Px5H7Yaa	i think myspace is better but maybe thats cuz im in high school..i may want a facebook when i get into college|`|vul3KPyuaa	its not|`|esJpBtEdaa	facebook=wayyy betterrrr|`|zhrGiQsKaa	both are retarded. i used to go on myspace every SINGLE day, but now i haven't been on it for over a year. I guess i would prefer myspace.|`|wMJYscXtaa	you can make your profile different from everyone elses. it kinda shows who you are. i like it better personally|`|rTwsdq6kaa	face book sucks. you can't play any music on there..|`|WqI4rCrhaa	MySpace is so much better than FaceBook- it's much more lively and personable.  When you see MySpace pages, the nine friends you're talking about are that users "top friends." You can display any number of your best friends on your page if you want to and all your other friends can be viewed through a link below their pictures.    MySpace is easier to manage, and much better than facebook.  You can personalize everything so your page better reflects you- and it has every application that facebook does and more.  I have both b/c a few of my friends only have facebook.  Otherwise I wouldn't bother with facebook at all.|`|QNhyowIKaa	facebook is waaaaaaaaaaaaaay better than myspace will ever be !|`|4rNMmoSpaa	I personally like Facebook better than Myspace.  With Facebook, you can find people you may know quite easily.  Facebook has better safety features than Myspace.  You can add applications, join groups, post photos and videos, you can become a fan of your favourite bands, actor, electronic, or item.  You can write on friend's "walls" on their profile, comment on their photos, send them a message to their inbox, chat with them on Facebook Chat, and so many more things.  Some applications even allow you to interact with your friends.  You can also post what you're doing that instant with your status.|`|mRam0J1Laa	I beleive facebook is better. It has many more applications then anyother website.    http://clkuk.tradedoubler.com/click?p=28...    http://www.domesticutilities.com    http://obamavsosama.co.uk|`|XP36zr63aa	theres more apps and things on facebook. and you cant really decorate your page as nice as myspace. you can meet a lot more people on facebook i think.|`|lGclixPuaa	When you first get a facebook, it's hard to figure out what to do and it's boring. But then after a while, it gets WAYYYYY better than myspace. After facebook, myspace seems stupid. I even cancelled my myspace because i loved facebook so much. get one!|`|WKkyriIZaa	Myspace is considerably a LOT more dangerous than Facebook, and i have a facebook, i think its a lot funner than myspace, and, you get to keep your privacy :)|`|EvbOCoCvaa	I like myspace better. maybe those people only add people they are really good friends with or something. Myspace is funer and i think its a lot less complicated than facebook.  You should just get one. and if you dont like it then just delete it.    PS . who cares if you dont have like 1,000 friends.... they are all fake anyways.|`|erblIkbDaa	facebook is simpler and easier to use.|`|e56f34b226a134831834a176960b7128aa	on myspace you can decorate your page and do all the stuff facebook has.    I think facebook is a little more safer though. I like facebook because it does not have those stupid spam things and you know each person. (shows which school they go to , full name, and other stuff)  I have not encountered one spam thing on facebook. no person/   facebook is easy to navigate and you can chat easily, message easily, write on people's walls easily. It also has a whole lot of fun games that i always play and its like Pet Society. You make one pet and it stays the same forever. not like a cheap game that forgets your pets name and stuff. Anyways,  about the friends. Many people have facebooks and many people have myspaces. I have about 100 on my myspace and about 100 on facebook. Because i like to delete all the people i don't know. or don't really talk to.    Myspace is kinnda fun if your into adding songs on your page and if you like to change your page, you'll love it. I have gotten really good with myspace layouts and i don't even go to those myspace layout sites. I can make my own. (haha not to brag, but lots of my friends are always saying, 'Argh! your myspace page is so cool and you really know how to use it')  so myspace and facebook are fun. For there own reasons.|`|bWwgOx0Gaa	Myspace is much better than Facebook.  Facebook tracks everything you do online, whether you opt out or not.  Even when you're not signed into Facebook, they watch what you're doing and sell that information to advertising companies.  Why do you think Facebook has a "My Favorite Things" (or whatever it's called) applet?  So they can find out who likes what the most and market to you in that way.  If you HAVE to use Facebook, please find a "beacon" blocker.  This stops them from tacking you online.  You can read more about MySpace vs Facebook here:    http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/05/27/mys...    You can read a LOT about how Facebook watches everything you do here:    http://community.ca.com/blogs/securityad...    You can find a firefox plugin to stop Facebook from tracking you here:    https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox...    Good luck!
lHpR2Kcvaa	OMG, girl, "x" for everything!!! I wish I had a high metabolism like you and could eat withot worrying about my weight!!!!!!!! You are friggin' lucky! You can fit into all of thsoe clothings.|`|gjDcdTcDaa	-i bet in pant you are size 1 i am!|`|9KHwzAfHaa	I don't think you will fit into American eagle, hollister or forever 21 pants but you might fit in aeropostale ones though and most likely you will fit in abercrombie kids pants. For shirts it really depends if you are flat or not but you can probably find a shirt that fits you in all of these except in extra small. I know what your saying about how  people think your anorexic one of my friends is really skinny but eats a lot too.|`|2mWjyFXFaa	ok, my cousin too is like you...but after her 21 age...she become fatter and fatter, it seems all the things she ate just comes out of her belly. i don't know.   but when we were young all the food and staff she ate, we always shared and i become the fat one....but after some years...don't know what happened... i do dance a lot and i still do i love dancing...but i don't know what happened to her metabolism cause she's really big and huge. and now its worrying her to much. and so i asked her to join me do the dancing.....what am saying is maybe because you are still young you have that fast metabolism it is in your genes. just be careful to eat when you reached the age of 18 and up....  God bless you...

57DG5xC1aa	Go to a tanning salon that has a stand up bed. They give a natural looking tan (no dark spots on your back and bum!). Before you tan, make sure you moisurize OR get the tanning lotions the salon sells. As for your acne, I reeeeally recommend Clean and Clear Dual Action Moisturizer http://www.manekineko.us/catalog/images/... It worked wonders on my acne. Just rub it on after you wash your face.|`|aiBzKyjlaa	spray tan, or the tanning creams, tanning with UV rays will make your acne worse and its bad for your skin.|`|yFuuvutTaa	Spray tan or tanning cream/lotion. Do not go to a tanning booth, it's bad for your skin and can eventually give you skin cancer. Hope i helped:]|`|AA11970098	i've tried spray tans and tanning creams and I hate them they never look right.  I would go to a tanning bed once in a while not all the time!!

Hope this helps.

yo0qnedIaa	I like it, but I think I would know more if I had a photo.    If short hair doesnt work for you, go with the hair that goes to about your eyes. (kind of like emo or scene hair length.but it doesnt have to be that type of style.) I personally LOVE the mess hair style. Like Rob Pattinsons, his hair is awesome. The "I just rolled out of bed and I don't give a **** what it looks like" is an awesome look.

AA11024148	part off the section to be twisted.  lay a chopstick on your head in the direction you want the twist to go.  wrap the hair around the chopstick one time super tightly.  take out the chopstick and keep wrapping the hair in the direction you want it to go.  keep your hands close to your head and use enough product to keep it twisting but not too much so it separates.

It works well (still a pain, but much better than those lint rollers).  Also, I make sure not to wash fleece with anything that has a lot of dog fur stuck to it or else the fleece seems to attract it.  Good luck!|`|AA10559135	You can use dish washing gloves, like the yellow ones.  Put them on, and rub the hair off of the coat.

I guess because Shorts are more comfortable maybe..|`|4c7QomPoaa	They're not all that comfortable.  It's the dead of winter and if you're in a skirt you end up with horribly chapped legs if you're outside long.  You have to shave unless you're into the au natural look.  As for mini's, anyone who wears anything larger than a size 0 looks like crap in them.|`|2qrYzex1aa	i wear proper length skirts. i know it's sad, what the world is becoming|`|wluJx79taa	its winter.  but i wear minis, leggings && uggs.  -I don't know what other excuses are..|`|AA11530601	they do! if you go out on a thur, fri or sat night, 99 % of girls are wearing skirts. I used to be made to wear hideous skirts as a child and my mum used to dress me up like a little doll in lacy pink dresses, and as such, I dont think I have worn a skirt or dress for over 8 yrs (except for my cousings wedding). To me, wearing one is like remembering that I didnt used to have a choice in the matter. They dont keep you as warm as trousers anyway - I dont think its just feminism, where i live in the Uk its freezing until about july anyway and gets cold again in September so now we are allowed to wear trousers, I think most opt for them out of practicality, not some kind of rebellion against gender stereotypes.

QEnUbtcYaa	I've done it, and known guys who do it themselves. I've just got to say, I had a dear and gorgeous friend who was completely straight but easily looked better in a dress and heels then any girl i've ever met.

FQ81VQvtaa	I actually love your hair!  There's a girl in my Latin class that has hair similar to yours  She puts her bangs up in a poof but tilted to the side kinda?  Hard to explain, but It looks amazing.    But don't brush your hair that much, just when necessary  Because It'll pull out those curls and make it into a giant foof  And for gym I'd use a soft scrunchie   One that won't dent your hair and put it into a bun  Then the rest of the day leave it down and show off your pretty curls[:|`|vcWuPlOyaa	Put it into a nice neat bun or ponytail,then after your gym class go to you school bathroom and untie it and comb it out.|`|fHRgmJdNaa	Okay so what I do on gym days is I comb all my hair back while its still wet and i put it in a high, tight ponytail (which is a super cute look if you make it get super curly in the ponytail part.  i have curly hair so i know what its like in gym!) after gym, make sure you have some bobby pins or cute hair clips or a headband and hair ties, and just kinda put it and pin it back.   Hope I helped! :D  |`|YEK4dIuGaa	im not sure how to keep it from messing up  but to fix it after class  i would bring hair ties  so you can do a ponytail or pigtails  and also a headband  really good for quick fixes!  :D|`|yPTUG6uNaa	Hai carol, head band will help.... nice hair :P|`|xhnhyAybaa	I would suggest putting your hair up with bobby pins into a messy bun.

As for leggings I would hope that any guy would find leggings sexy on a chick. Chicks wearing running leggings for workouts can also tease guys as well lol. However, isn't there a rule that says "wearing leggings just as pants isn't a wise thing to do?" If you can pull it off like Sienna Miller, then go for it!

pmrKsxHTaa	Lots and lots of protein in your diet.  Also, make sure you trim your hair every 4-6 weeks.  Good moisturizing conditioners make a HUGE difference because they open the pores in your hair and allow them to expand.  I would strongly recommend Redken All Soft.  I bleach my hair every 6 weeks and Redken keeps it looking healthy, and you cannot tell its ever seen a chemical.  To sucessfully moisturize your hair, you need to soak your hair in VERY warm water, and then apply the conditioner (if your hair tends to get greasy, only apply it on the tips).  Allow the conditioner to soak in for at least 2 minutes before rinsing it out.  Try to rinse your hair in cold water because it will seal the vitamins in your hair.  Also, brush your hair out before bed every night if you can.  Good luck!|`|xv3opX9Maa	vitamins and drink tons of water   ( =|`|1r05fktRaa	not that know of|`|819sWJJtaa	my friend said braids make it grown longer.   i am not sure about that though.   it's worth a try.|`|0JAYAuVXaa	Nothing you can really do I mean when I get a hair cut my hair will be very long by the 5th day|`|Zp4fCCKjaa	eat healthy,  :)  their might be some conditioners also|`|cjG7Z1UCaa	um like the first person said vitamins but to be more spicific(UGH i cant spell lol) vitamin A like in carrots and dark green veggies and u should use this shampoo called mane-n-tails|`|nGMyPvcJaa	i've heard that the shampoo & conditioner mane and tail works.  i've never tried it.  check it out for yourself, though.  go to straightarrowinc.com.  good luck!

If you don't use a blow dryer, let it dry on it's own.  You could also put your hair in a bun and just let it dry like that.|`|fnI25H4naa	Uae mouse for your hair !   all you have to do is get a little bit of mouse in ur hands ,   then scrunch ur hair with it and hold for 2 min !!!  and yes mouse dose stay !  hope it helps !!!  go to this website at the bottom

LCcW7KSsaa	It is cute but Hollister is a very safe store that pretty much has the same things every year. The only new thing I think they have had inyears are skinny jeans. Anyway, they will probably have another one just like this next year and since Winter season is pretty much over, you can probably find one on eBay for $50 or less. This is also the same style that Aeropostale, which may not be as "name brand" but WAY more cheap has.

It coats your hair in plastics so that's why it seems smooth and silky. If you use it for too long, you will have so much build up you will not be able to color or perm or straighten your hair.   Try Matrix Sleek Look shampoo and conditioner for smoothness.|`|iHub3X6Gaa	http://www.hennahut.com/henna_shampoo

If it is something that has been persistent, you might want to see a dermatologist who could recommend antibiotics such as tetracycline to clear it up. That works from the inside of your body out, helping to clear up anything under the skin's surface that might be causing excessive breakouts. Topical treatments that aren't prescribed only get to the surface, and not to the underlying problem.    Hope this helps!!!|`|cgmBEvHIaa	proactive

I really love both styles a lot. I think naturally curly is the best, but maybe you can straighten it once a week for a different look. Another thing is that straightening your hair everyday (or even every other day) will damage your hair and make it very dry. Maybe straighten it when you are going somewhere different for the week, like to dinner or a night out with friends. My hair is pretty similar to yours, and it takes a lot to straighten it perfectly. So I just learned to love my curls!

2U27BgmKaa	I have fine hair, and I find that there are certain things you can do to make your hair APPEAR thicker and other things to can do to MAKE you hair thicker. I not have about normal thickness and I'm loving it! Here are some tips:  - Don't wash your hair everyday. Wash it every other day and use a dry shampoo on the in between days.  - Use a thickening spray and a leave in conditioner. I use T3 Thickening Spray and Ojon leave in conditioner.  - Do a weekly treatment. I use Ojon Restorative Treatment, but to get thicker hair at a cheaper price, use coconut oil. If your use the oil, you may want to do this twice a week at first. Saturate your hair with coconut oil and put a shower cap on. Leave in for 15-30 minutes then wash out. It makes your hair shiny and super thick. It may take two or three times to feel the difference but you will feel one.  - Eat healthy. Eat lots of fruits, veggies, and nuts. If you are going to eat meats, try to go for fish instead of red meats. That way you will be getting the protein you need and that fats that will make your hair and skin look wonderful.  - Fluff your hair as you are blow drying it and make sure to use a bit of hairspray or root lifter at you scalp to give you a full look.  Good luck!|`|Qzx8CAkoaa	Tigi bedhead superstar  for thick massive hair it is a pink tube shampoo love it it works for me.|`|kQnEvrIRaa	I think you should eat good quality protein like eggs (the whites have the protein) and avoid acidy foods and drinks like pop.

c1bd86e2bd968c5f9a7007f8c99605c7aa	As a redhead-I'd say if you're not born with it then you shouldn't try it because red dye usually backfires.    what you should do is dye all your hair a chocolate brown with slight auburn undertowns-this will bring out your eyes and make your complextion more striking.    if you're having doubts then don't do it, I'm sure you're beautiful the way you are.|`|64b5ddb91a78f9cb5f26f04d8b418497aa	im not a red headed fan whatsoever, very few people can pull it off.  if you are a "hot" red head, lucky you be very happy. however, DIED red on dark brown hair, is gorgeous :) im thinking about doin the same thing..!|`|RhksiPacaa	dye ur hair black and have pink highlights it will be awesome

2oN7WrVKaa	Even if you still had your piercing you would feel that bump.  Theres just a hole in your ear, and the scar tissue is probably filled inside.  Its nothing to worry about!    DO NOT it yourself, getting an infection on your lips could cause you to have them deformed for the rest of your life.  Self piercings are usually not sterilized correctly.  Go get it done with a parent professionally.  And if your parents arent letting you get it done, then what makes you think they wont make you take it out as soon as you do it?|`|HvHBF8glaa	Don't do it yourself!|`|EtCkoHX5aa	absolutely NOT true.  don't do it yourself.  you could get a serious infection, and end up losing your lip.|`|FDBJs1lOaa	It is definitely not true that if you leave a fake piercing in for a really long time that it will do it itself. Lip piercing is an extreme body piercing and should only be done by a professional piercer, no matter how bad you want it.  Lip piercings that are done with just a random needle from someone who does not know what they're doing can result in an extreme infection as well as being paralyzed.

hLdIO43Xaa	I'm not sure about the shampoo!    but...  There are lots of ways that we damage our hair every day. Nearly anything that you do to style your hair can cause damage, and the key is finding the right balance to keep your hair looking healthy.    Things we all do every day:  ? Shampooing  ? Blowdrying  ? Brushing and back-combing  ? Curling or flat-ironing  ? Exposing hair to humidity  ? Altering structure or color of the hair through perms and coloring/bleaching  ? Poor nutrition  ? Sun and Chlorine exposure    Within the hair shaft itself, damage really affects the cuticle first. As the cuticle is damaged and pulls away from the other layers, the shaft breaks easily. The cuticle also won't lie flat, which creates hiding places for water (hair is harder to dry), and doesn't reflect light as well so you lose shine. In addition to the changes within the cuticle, the keratin throughout the hair shaft (which is also held together by many types of chemical and charge-based bonds) starts to pull apart as these bonds are broken.    Prevention  Now that we know how the hair is damaged, what can be done to prevent hair from being damaged?  ? Avoid heat such as hair dryers, curling irons and such. If you must use them (like I do), then use the lowest heat setting that you can and use them as infrequently as you can. Is it really that important to have perfectly blown out hair while you work in the garden on Saturday morning?  ? Avoid stretching the hair shaft by only using wide tooth combs on your wet hair  ? Avoid chemically altering your hair through perms and coloring (though honestly, who can do that?)  ? Avoid chemicals such as chlorine, salt water, etc.  ? Use UV protection for prolonged sun exposure (My favorite product for the hair is by Frederic Fekkai and I reviewed it back in May  ? Get regular trims. Cutting off those split ends will help to prevent them from splitting further up the hair shaft    Fixing it!  I'm not sure that anything truly "fixes" these trouble spots, short of cutting them off. While that isn't always possible, there are some temporary fixes such as those "deep" conditioners, look for ones with proteins (I describe this all in my description of shampoo and conditioner), as the proteins can fill in the gaps in the cuticle and improve the strength of the hair.    When all else fails, Fake it!  Faking healthy hair is incredibly easy! You can hide damaged hair with a hair style (a pony tail, updo, etc) or with product. A shine product, especially one with silicone will create the illusion of healthy, shiny hair. My favorite shine product is the Frederic Fekkai Glossing Sheer Shine Mist, because it is so incredibly easy to use. Simply spritz on this mist with a few pumps, run your hands over your hair and the application is perfect!|`|nuISzHFRaa	I would say go to your local salon, or one nearby with experience and ask them. Usually they can tell you the best shampoo, and might be able to do something there to help.|`|D35S61Dnaa	the best is not to do anything to your hair at all. Especially bleaching it.
cBuYvBy2aa	I do it before I go to bed so I can sleep in for like an extra 10 minutes and I won't have to worry about running around like a chicken in the morning.

SKtQSElAaa	Most likely.  I have medium brown hair with natural blonde highlights.  When I tan my hair turns mostly blonde.  I once tried dying my hair all dark brown to avoid it from turning blonde....didn't work.      You could try wrapping a towel around or something around your head/hair so it isn't exposed to the rays.|`|3sCrTA1Raa	no  unless  you added  lemon juice.  but that dries  out your hair.
N5sfCg87aa	You could get a bob or something. Go here for some ideas http://stylish-haircuts.blogspot.com/ . And you can add some color, get highlights. Like brown, black, bleach Blonde, or if your bold pink, blue, green, white, you could even get it frosted on the bottom.

hLdIO43Xaa	I know, acne is a pain!  The best investment is to go to the dermatologist.   Though it may be pricey, it'll be worth it instead of going through all those different acne products trying to find one that works for your skin! We have differently chemical levels in our bodies so a product that works for your friend may not necessarily work for you!  So take that trip to the dermatologist instead of going through the shelves at walmart!   They'll diagnose your problem (maybe its not just acne but also skin issues) and prescribe you or reccommend you a certain product to use!  Good luck!    And don't sweat it, because everybody has to go through the stage of acne :P|`|EtCkoHX5aa	hmmm.....try a face peel!?|`|y5EQiY1Paa	go to a dermatologist. they can look at it and per-scribe you a medicine to help get rid of it.  i had a few acne scars too and this is what i did. and now they're all gone:)|`|d8mDPfjgaa	Proactive  or  acneclear

Do it straight after a shower.  Your pores will still be open, so it won't hurt as much.   :)|`|PpwhwEDhaa	Go get your eyebrows done professionally-threading or waxing. Then from that point on pluck them yourself. You MUST have a strong Magnifying mirror. All you have to do is stick to the same shape the professional gave you. Just constantly clean up the new hair growth.|`|k8veKLdlaa	Look around to see what kind of brow you want and maybe try that out. What ever you do don't shave them i know it sounds crazy but one of my friends tried not good! if you are really that scared get them waxed. well i think just like legs the hair might grow back bushier or prickly. i think you could use ice to reduce the pain. but GOOD LUCK!|`|0W0JwfAcaa	WHY dont u try the middle-eastern way Threading it gives u a perfect shape and its cheap    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F37Sl1c7B...

acfd7907edce364d509ad8e43b8f4f0faa	What color is your hair right now? Purple and blue hair dye are going to show up much better on a lighter shade of hair. If your hair is darker, you can add blonde streaks to your hair and then dye the blonde streaks purple or blue. (Or both) You can always just dye your entire hair purple or blue. It will appear brighter on lighter hair and more subtle on darker hair shades.  http://th01.deviantart.com/fs17/300W/f/2...  http://k41.pbase.com/g6/71/720771/2/6922...  http://farm1.static.flickr.com/218/46587...  http://www.wigsalon.com/img/full/envy-hm...|`|AA11539581	Dear I know you and I think you should do a purple peek-a-boo and then dye your tips the blue instead of the purple.  but you hair still looks cute now.  =)|`|AA10451072	Throw it out the window and go buy some brunette dye?|`|n8Q18dE6aa	ha.    i just dyed the front of my hair purple.  :)    but... don't use the blue... it will turn like sea-foam green.      try putting purple in your bangs or do a strip or two on underneath your hair.     :)|`|8iQFdkIhaa	dont use it. u should use more natural colors.|`|ADWIWx5Baa	Coon tails =)  http://i33.piczo.com/view/4/b/t/k/d/r/z/...  or put the color underneath your hair..(leave out the black though)  http://i82.photobucket.com/albums/j246/c...|`|XxR36ICHaa	throw away the blue... and do a little (I mean a LITTLE) purple spot, about 2 inches wide on one side, but under some hair still.... so it's like hiding a little

rUMlDAINaa	First of all: do not pierce your own tongue.  There are professionals who are far more experienced than yourself; they are also able to better position themselves to find the right spot on your tongue to piece.  See the following quote:  "The arteries of the tongue are derived from the lingual, a branch of the external carotid (see Arteries), while the veins from the tongue return the blood, by one or more veins on each side, into the internal jugular vein (see Veins)."    Arteries pump far more blood than veins - and if you puncture your artery (anywhere on your body), that is where the huge spray comes and stopping the bleeding is difficult, even with professional help (think about your cartoid artery in your neck, your femoral artery in your thigh - you can bleed out in minutes if you gash those open).    Finally, there is a high risk of infection in this site - the human mouth is absolutely filthy.  You will need strong antiseptic mouthwash (I think I used pharmaceutical grade because listerine has too much alcohol in it).    The amount of swelling depends upon the person. Soft food, cold foods are best, at least for the first few days. And constantly washing your mouth out is a must.    Finally, something a lot of folks don't think about is how the barbell can chip your teeth if you chomp on it or inadvertently rub the barbell across your teeth. It happened to 2 friends of mine, after years of having their tongue rings - it wasn't a "novice" mistake.    As for not having  your mom notice... well, my mom noticed mine after I'd had it for months, when I was talking and she saw it in my profile - not even straight on. And even screwier, I had a metal post with a clear ball - the woman saw it - she must have x-ray vision.    Tongue rings aren't going anywhere for awhile, so don't feel like you have to be impetuous with this decision. Find a professional with some health certifications in his/her piercing parlor.  Take a friend with you, make sure you ask a lot of questions and get answers.      Oh, and good luck!  :)|`|eDP3YU5Laa	Why would you want that?!?!  on the news they showed a 16  year old got paralized because he got  a tongue piercing and  it hit on of his nerves|`|RA2afpeRaa	well if your still young than you shouldnt get your tongue pierced cause their is a vein in your tongue that is pretty important and it is still growing sooo yea but you should totally get your bell button pierced i thank thats would be awesome.|`|9TE9lOKBaa	Are you stupid?  Why on earth would you pierce your own tongue?!  Do you realize how dangerous that is?  Just wait a couple of years until your 18.  Patience.|`|iCHxt81haa	dont pierce it yourself...too much risk.   if you get it done, eat yogurt that helps a lot with swelling..thats what the guy that pierced mine said.   the culture in yogurt helps with the healing.|`|b996bdcf34d088f7d764a720874eabe3aa	OH MY GOODNESS!!! Do not pierce your tongue yourself. There is a major vein in your tongue, that if you hit it you can die very quickly! I had my tongue professional pierced when I was 18 and it was the dumbest thing I ever did. I still have a scar on my tongue from it, and when you get older its not very appealing, I actually lost a promotion because of it. If you want a piercing go with something that can be hidden, something that wont damage your teeth.|`|A4M7z4BHaa	you cant peirce your own tounge... if you tried you'd hit a major vein and die. :[] as for your mom.. try to explain to her that only you'll see it or something|`|EE1f7yNmaa	i suggest you dont do it yourself considering to hide it from her you would basically have to not let her see your mouth. oh and the fact that most people tend to mess up their own piercings and its not so fun when its infected.    lmao and i know plenty of people that pierced their own tongues and pretty much anything else you can think of. yeah none of them died =P.|`|uOUmBQS6aa	lol hahahahahahahahaha dont do it its weird and a turn off to guys if you dont like boy friends go ahead dont say i didnt warn you
9LDGmQ4Aaa	I've never had problems walking in heels, but all I can say is that you should keep practicing. Try putting one foot in front of the other. Look straight forward, make sure your posture is straight. If you can't walk in the heels before the dance, wear cute flats or get kitten heels. Oh, and I heard from somewhere that it may help if you take something and scrape the bottoms of the heels so that they're not so slippery. Hope that helped...|`|Gburbcuiaa	Put some soda on the bottom and walk up and down your driveway to scrape up the bottoms so you don't slip as much. Keep practicing and if you fall...you can always play the ditzy "I'm so clutzy!!" and cling to his arm. You can always take them off at the dance.

The one with braces should not leave their mouth open like that.|`|l22Neymmaa	Not at all. its a really bad picture. people with my braces should mostley smile with mouth closed|`|59xjQCLIaa	its ok, cute|`|eC8GMMxUaa	brace face-mouth close.  and its too close up.    The girl on the left is gorgeous!|`|KIRB5G0Waa	if her mouth was closed. she's at an angle that makes her mouth look huge. but if it was from a different angle, yeah. The girl on the left reminds me of brittney in the womanizer video..|`|KTl9iJMGaa	I don't think so...not that she's not pretty it's just a bad pic.
j04tfWjKaa	Yes. Just go down with the curling iron but dont do all strands
dXDroPtfaa	Eventually, the chemicals will damage your hair and you get terrible splits ends++Damage. If you have pretty much straight hair already-I would skip this step. You still have to touch up your chemically straightened hair..So there isn't much of a point..If your hair is already thin then oh boy, definitely don't get it chemically straightened. At first it will look pretty and soft. But in the long run it worsens.    Hope this helps;|`|d2NW4GwCaa	Uhm, I've done it before and my hairrr is just fineee. Go for it, it honestly doesn't do anything. Hope i helped:)  |`|unQrPeTDaa	If you use chemicals just for the ends, your hair would probably just fall out. :/ For your ends you can just use a heat protector before you flat iron it and you should be good to go without chemicals and that fried feeling.|`|7fGG81bfaa	no|`|Ky60icf3aa	I wouldn't just for the ends. I use a straightener, plus I have my hair chemically straightened. I use a type of cream so that it won't fry my hair. Maybe try one of those, so that your hair doesn't get fried.
rTkaT7czaa	I always go with a dress for parties. A music genre theme... hmm... I would go with techno music because you can just look very crisp.   Try a very plain fitted white dress with either really high black heels or wedges in solid black. For your hair I would do a slick back pony tail. Paint your nails black and wear some rounded square bangles in black or white.   As far as makeup goes I would go with a very clean and slightly plain look- for example liquid eyeliner on top and bottom but only mascara on the top lashes. I would just wear some lip balm, not colored. For eyeshadow you are going to want to do black but don't go above the crease of your eye.   Please keep in mind that this is an extreme example of how you could do it, take it as far as you feel comfortable!   Hope I have helped a little and that you have a splendid time at the party!|`|RzeYy8dTaa	A dress a  will be prefect not to fancy but a little sassy.
fBAzdVVSaa	I think that purple is ok. If your eyes are blue, black always looks the best. also charcoal or gray. If your eyes or more green i like brown. It really brings out the eyes. Hope this helps.|`|jCWAYgaMaa	From the pics, what you're doing looks great.   Plum and brown are wonderful for blue eyes especially, and green too.   I usually avoid wearing the same color shirt (or dress, or whatever) as my eyeliner. Some people like to get matchy- matchy with their makeup, but I don't, LOL,I think that it just neutralizes the effect the eyeliner was supposed to have.   If you like both, there's no reason you can't alternate between the two- that's what I do.|`|FhOL7UUZaa	Your eyes are definitely both blue and green, just like mine!  For blue, golds and browns work best.  And for green, rich shades of purple like plum and burgundy, and even bright purples.  Even pink can work if it's not too light (whitish colors can make eyes appear darker)|`|ipaMI2Woaa	Purple looks awesome with green eyes!  Brown eyeshadow usually brings out blue eyes, so maybe Brown eyeliner will work too. If not, plain black brings out blues too:)|`|zDqlHcGSaa	Purple would look great!!! You could also try Gray, Black, or one of those "combined" pencils with an irrediscent green/blue/silver mixture. I think that would really bring out your eyes. You might also try lining your top lid with white and bottom with black or vice-versa.|`|Q2MTQxZoaa	grayish or dark brown|`|GIqACtxvaa	Dark Brown for sure.  It will make the blue in your eyes POP|`|ZvLmuCiOaa	black always looks good  now. if you want your eyes to look bluer then make it brown eyeliner. but black is always pretty|`|V3zx1Fm2aa	I am a make-up artist and I suggest using purple eyeliner and/or purple mascara.  Purple will bring out the color of your eyes and make it more noticable.|`|AUB37xlyaa	I say charcoal, jet black, or brown!
gv7oIHXmaa	Get curl rollers (yes, those things your mom had to use to curl her hair, and preferably ones larger in diameter), and before you blow dry your hair, place the curlers at the base of your roots, but do not curl them, just wrap the top part of your hair (don't make an entire loop, either). That should give your hair some body:]|`|ujeSLqxAaa	I suggest looking into different hair products, techniques for thin or flat hair.  Here is a link below to all the posts on my blog having to do with how to get volume including some videos.|`|0xgVNOsaaa	use volumizing shampoo and conditioner, like body boost from Garnier,  *there is this really awesome stuff from Pantene, i forget wat its called but it like makes your hair full and stuff.  *use that stuff then blowdry your hair up like with the dryer with the air coming out onto the ceiling ish...does that make sence?  *if yu can tease it a little,  *hairspray will help a little too
r4tpMuhDaa	They're called wayfarers. you can get them at some stores like spencer's and sometimes hot topic. you can probably find them if you go to the mall and just look around at the people selling sunglasses from carts or you can just order some online easy|`|NL3lEg27aa	These look like the picture : http://www.fredflare.com/customer/produc...    ^^They have them in black and brown as well as bright colors.|`|DeRRNCvnaa	They are at     Wetseal     and    Icing    No I am not guessing, I have seen them there. I acutally bought them!
DmPDt4aDaa	woah!! it looks just like ray. maybe it is..|`|cR8UZdi1aa	Yeah, it must be. He's such a nerd!!!
r59A7V9Zaa	Overalls!    I know they're not the most "in-style" things but I have a pair and my friends say that they look really cute on me. If you have the right figure, they can be adorable! and noticeable!|`|LlEC2x5Faa	i like knitted berets : D  ooo and get yourself a nice pair of jeans. I personally like acid washed and the ripped ones... and they dont have to be skinny jeans either
HasE11Wfaa	i work at a law firm and must wear what you are talking about on a daily basis.  I think as long as you stay away from heels that are too high and dresses that are too short, you'll be okay.      My heels are never taller than 5 inches and my dresses are never shorter than about 2 inches from my crotch.  I have seen a younger associate where platforms and a very very tight dress that was shorter than my shortest dress.  I think that's a bit too far.  I also think you can get away with it if you tend to be tall and slender.  I'm about 5"11 and 120lbs.  I usually stand about 6' 1 to 6' 3" in my work heels so many women and men tend to treat me with faux authority rather than think I'm sluty.  Good luck on your situation|`|XnekCBj7aa	Maybe a little. But you would look good.
gOOxQKNAaa	As long as you don't look top-heavy and are comfortable with more attention and stares from guys, then it's fine. You can also try layering to play down your chest. Gratuitous cleavage is very un-classy so I'm glad you're going in the right direction!|`|KM8uZ4fVaa	Something offends everyone; if you try not to offend it's a lost cause. Wear what YOU like.|`|d9ONMUpBaa	as a fellow big boob girl, i say, SHOW THEM PUPPIES OFF GIRL! be proud of what your mama gave ya! boobs are they key to getting whatever you want, whenever you want. the boys will be like DAYUMMM and th e girls will be like ohh i'm jealous.  make sure you get a good bra that supports them so that they don't flatten out under tight tops.|`|3c57UA3Yaa	On a heavy set person. Baggier is not necessarily more flattering. makes them look like they're wearing a tent.     I think tailored/fitted is much much betta        **Got interrupted..answer to  the rest of your q:    For you, it's better to have your clothes be fitted as well. If they're skin tight and show off your boobs..whether you like it or not that's going to send the message: "look at my boobs".So it's best to stay with tailored to give you shape but not have it cling to your boobs.    P.S.  It's not "vulgar" to wear tight clothes.You are wearing clothes. it's vulgar to show too much skin.think :streetwalker..that's vulgar.|`|RC2aQBkgaa	it's okay but it can give guys the wrong message, depending on what it looks like. If there's no cleavage or they don't buldge out to the point to make guys drooling, I guess your fine. But I think it looks pretty trampy/trashy to wear too tight or too low shirts.|`|MZWdvdEwaa	Tight tops and low cuts aren't made for big boobs.  It doesn't flatter them, Instead it looks like you are putting them out there. Otherwise making you look like a slut.    That's the brightside about having b's, I can wear whatever I feel like.    :)|`|LhHAkqGiaa	Guys will say yes, ha.    I think that it's a little bit gross, but it really depends on how big they are. And if you wear the right size bra so they aren't jiggling around all over the place.|`|GLEGh4N0aa	there are going to be people who think you look vulgar no matter what you wear. just wear whatever you feel good in! :)|`|fUhosu5Raa	I think you should wear whatever you like i am also skinny and i wear tight revealing clothes.. i dont let peoples opinions bother me... you wear what your comfortable in... and always shake what your mama gave ya|`|BWPtZkIDaa	i think its ok 2 wear tight clothes  i hav pretty large boobs and i wear tight clothes  as long as u  dont act all sleezy|`|SRFfaKbCaa	Being a Top heavy women myself..I hate loose clothing only because I like my girls to feel like they're not flapping around ..BUT I hate looking trashy too so I wait the tight top but wear a nice blazer,zippered hoodie,leather jacket ect to go over it and only show my neck ;-) the girls are in there holdered and I'm not looking like something I'm not|`|Ir51Eb0Kaa	I think clothing should be fitted, but not too tight.|`|vMcdZvW5aa	cleavage and big boobs is a great thing|`|MjUentmjaa	dont wear it if it doesnt look good|`|im9HVuWfaa	I think that I may not think that everything a person wears is flattering, but I admire people who dress for themselves, and not for strangers who want to put arbitrary rules on the fashion choices of other people.  You decide what you want to wear.  If you think something looks "vulgar" on you, don't wear it.|`|fSJn0gQLaa	I think you'd look fine in it, but you might get attention you might not want from the opposite sex. Me personally I love seeing a petite women with nice breasts showing them off... they are natural and beautiful so show them off.|`|kUfiQkgdaa	I don't think it would be vulgar in less you got ill fitting tops that showed your breasts. Other than that I think you sould be fine.|`|n606G2A8aa	Heya! I would try some V-neck shirts, that have some pretty frailly things going down the V part of the shirt If you know what I mean. Show some clevage off, but do it in a way that the whole shirt is not tight, let it be a comfortable fit. You don't want to look like a bar fly- lol.|`|bPd1RsxDaa	I am not offended lol.  I am shaped the same way.  I am most comfortable and feel sexier wearing tops that are made looser at the top and tighter at the bottom.  Occasionally, I will wear a top made the opposite way, flowy at the bottom and just snug at the bust line.  I would feel out of place wearing anything that was too tight across the bust line because it makes my boobs look "saggy" and unflattering.  I love scoop necklines, too.  They actually make my body look great without being too trashy.  From one large-breasted lady to another, I hope this helps :)|`|6f8ZKDJ4aa	Tight bras.|`|3sCrTA1Raa	agree.  i think loose  clothing on people  that are fat not skin tight.|`|8G1eYEsZaa	if you want to show you have breast you can but it realy lookes trashy!!!!!!!!!!!!!
iMVMPL9waa	Ask the guys at http://www.fanelaki.com  They will reply you immediately with your design on a t-shirt so you know how it looks!
A2byxpHDaa	8-10 glasses a day washes out "toxins" there for clearer skin :)  hope i helped|`|l22Neymmaa	I don't know what drinking water has to to with dry skin, thats what lotion is for. But you are supposed to drink 8 cups of water a day.|`|Zh7QcGLtaa	Your supposed to be drinking 8cups of water a day. That will make sure your skin is fully mosturized and stays looking PERFECT! I know it makes my skin look amazing!|`|fcf32c63c9c132f2f8fc2514207b35c2aa	Drinking water is very important.  Drink as much as you want so that you are never thirsty, If 6 glasses is suffice for you then don't force yourself to drink more, you may drink more or less depending on conditions such as temperature, activity and humidity.    The biggest concern about hydration and your skin is that water tends to evaporate.  The best way to prevent this is to apply petroleum jelly  on your wet skin (face, arms, legs..etc) liberally after a shower or bath and then remove the excess vaseline with a towel.  If done correctly it should not feel greasy. Your skin will be softer and more beautiful.
2dtyiFcLaa	i'd recommend buying a two liter bottle and just filling every morning and drinking it trough the day :) Don't forget to hydrate your face that's also very important :) GOOD LUCK (works for me :) had very sensitive and VERY dry skin)|`|J8lnNUakaa	FDA said 1 pint a day no more no less and not all at once empty a pint jug and put it in the fridge & drank it thew out the day. hope I helped|`|fqnmZ23taa	8 + bottles of water every day. I used to have dry skin and now its much better.|`|tp61e25Eaa	Just drink as you need to. Do not over do it, I'll explain. A few years ago a woman was in a radio contest to try to win a wii for her son. It was called "Hold your wee for wii" or something. She died from water intoxication. Too much of anything is a bad thing. I believe that she flushed out the necessary electrolytes needed for her body to function.
zb0vZXZfaa	ive used it and i love it, try it. dont get a big thing of it tho, just go to ur dermatologist and get the sample ones to try at first, then if u like what it does for YOU, get the bottle
FcNOkHquaa	Go to your local jewlery store and see if they have anything similar....  Check ebay.    /m|`|i1T8yKhpaa	idk but i like her makeup|`|HYw0YE7Gaa	claires|`|6FhK1MrNaa	idk   its really cute i want one too|`|LXxxAzIqaa	Whoa that was a mole on her chin?! I never knew that..|`|uiVEaxjqaa	try hottopic or Spencer's or you might just want to find an ear ring that looks like that it stays in you would just have to be a little bit more careful with it so it doesn't fall out but i used to keep an earring in mine.|`|KKx8Mb63aa	Try piercing shops or jewelery shops.  It's just a flower stud.|`|MrdLh0Zsaa	This may sound weird at first, but try Ebay. They sell really neat new un-used body jewelry.
S730dpLfaa	WARNING! read this blog before taking any action  http://ihateblackheads.wordpress.com  Thanks to this blog, it helped me a lot to find the best method.  Hope this helps|`|S88wOtSkaa	continue using the face wash, and get a good moisturizer. i use cetaphil. its a little expensive, like 10$ a bottle but it wont irritate your face, my dermatoligist actually recomended it because i have sensative skin like you. you should also exfoliate, that will help with the blackheads and excess dry skin. aveeno apricot scrub is what i use its like 4$ a bottle. good luck!|`|HE558QgXaa	I recommend the Neutrogena Wave. It makes your skin soft and moisturized while it cleans your skin. It gets really deep and does an awesome job|`|ao5CeroVaa	nichole its emilee or lily my new nickname get better face wash|`|4lqwMnhJaa	I would not recommend Clean and Clear. It really dries out the skin. I would recommend ProActiv or an oil-free cleanser from Neutrogena or Dove. Also, don't use a lot of toner because that really dries out the skin. On big pimples, dab a little toothpaste overnight. Good luck :)
p0Xw8hLZaa	you are average.  With all the sports, I'm guessing you have more muscle then fat?  Maybe? Just keep up with the sports, eat healthier, get a lot of sleep, and do some work outs/exercises each day to come down to a 0 but it will take some time.  Be patient!!  I play field hockey and track and I workout each day unless I have a sport that day for a few hours.  I lost almost 10 pounds and am now 5'9" and 121 and a size 1 but I used to be a size three.  Good luck!!!|`|Zp4fCCKjaa	you're like perfect!  almost exactly the same as me.  seriously almost no one is a size zero.|`|4Ww4TVulaa	If your a size 3 and weight 125 then you are skinny so don't worry, their are some people who wear triple that size.

I think you are fine for your height and weight. If you want to loose weight though, just promise me you won't become anorexic or anything. Eat healthier and burn more calories then you take in.

I would go with a simple stud earring with your hair down! that would be cute.|`|SEUg7HIXaa	I think a pair of colored flats (not black) and a pair of black footless tights would look good with that.

Not too many accessories though because it's a pretty flashy dress.|`|ngyieY6laa	red shoes  no tights  fine jewelry that matches the shoes  purse (red)|`|k7xC3jleaa	bright colored flats or heals  and a long silver necklace

Fuwihp6laa	It really depends on your shape, and your own comfort levels. Some women are up to wearing highlighter colored jeans, whereas others are more comfortable with their neutral colors      If you're up for a little oomph, but don't want to take a huge risk, or make yourself uncomfortable, you should try colored jeans in deep rich tones. Such as deep, dark; maroons, purples, blues, greys, reds, pinks, browns etc.    If you're up for the confident bombastic, sparky edge, try bright reds, pinks, yellows, blues, etc.    I suggest you go shopping, and try on as many different colors as you can, you will automatically feel sexy in the jean that makes you look and feel the best. You can take a best friend for advice, but sometimes you may feel their opinions aren't the same as yours. In that case, always remember, if you like it, you will make whatever you're wearing sexy.     Good luck darling!|`|fMPyLqW4aa	I think they are soon to be out but I think a dark color is a nice choice.|`|2OYyljWEaa	They're alright, but not my favorite.|`|73ee354f7bf2027a3e2d3c971ceb8834aa	I like colored skinny jeans.

And there outstanding and bold without focusing all the attention on YOU. :]|`|d2NW4GwCaa	Mistake. It's okay to have some colors such as pink, blue, green, purple stuff likeee that. But stick to denim, red, gray, black, white, basic colors. Cause I bought to manny loud colors, and when i try to look normal it doesn't work cause my skinnys don't match most of my shirts, and i have a lot of shirts over 50!  Gooddd luckkk|`|Rpp53LbHaa	Any coloured jeans is anything but subtle.    If u wanna go colourful, and different, try something like an unique shirt.    atleast tat'll prevent u from being pointed and laughed at|`|y42BSHGjaa	I like them as long as they're worn with a black or white shirt, usually.

If I were you I'd wear a spaghetti strap white a-line with a bold necklace, dark-wash super skinny jeans and either converse or heels.|`|uMseesTAaa	Leggings would be easier to move around in then tight skinny jeans would. I would go with the leggings|`|fMPyLqW4aa	Leggings.|`|58xXEE6Faa	leggings. i wish i could dance with you haha|`|kogfFMgmaa	um does it matter that its a "wild teen party" what does it have to do with ur pants seriously|`|BxAPrXlzaa	uh... you would want to go to a party with innapropriate behavior, why?  anyways, i would advise leggings since they would be more comfortable moving your legs and butt around. if you wore the tight skinny jeans it might get uncomfortable to bend over and stuff|`|V2IJHt94aa	IF your jeans are cool wear them.|`|1KHfd3F9aa	lol wild teen party leggings are always the best for grinding but make sure you wear a tunic with it. ppl are starting to wear leggings with shirt and it looks really bad|`|FQuuztpQaa	Wear jeans that fit nice & have a good color, & that you can move, all those 3 = banger banger time.|`|QcZpWf44aa	leggings =)|`|3KPPtupLaa	either, leggings allow for more flexibility though...and if this really is gonna be that wild of a party then it probably won't matter because you might not be wearig either by the end of it....|`|xT8Sk426aa	Neither. You sound 12.|`|eDEX8TUVaa	def leggings... trust me i kno^__^|`|5wAk1Ctkaa	leggings and atleast ull be comfy and cute at the same time|`|YuUQpOv1aa	Leggings I suppose, more flexible for dancing..|`|0U53vlhEaa	Skinny Jeans!|`|o4LBt2QVaa	deff jeans. its safe. but unless you match up the leggings with a super cute dress.|`|yLY8B4scaa	if your a teen that likes to party and dance like me, you should know the answer to this honey.
JzgzvPxvaa	ive never heard of anything but ive learned that hydrogen peroxide mixed with hair dye toner makes your skin white for a short period of time
3kRnw3eNaa	You are pretty. Maybe wear some make up. Eyeliner foundation mascara.|`|z3uUtr33aa	i don't know, you look so different in all your pictures and from what i can really tell your kind of weird looking and not in a bad way. your very different looking but i think different makes you sound mental or something so let's just go with unique looking haha. anyways... i think i seen a lot of freckles on your face so you might wanna start wearing concealer to cover it up a bit and really i'd just like to see you with makeup and a new hairstyle, maybe with bangs? idk if that's your style but it'll look really cute on you. good luck with your new look hun!
b62681034bacc61343278767e0140c09aa	I am about to tell you Something really cool. Well You might not know its cool. But it is.   you can get t shirt transfers at walmart in the stationary area for about 6.00 you get maybe 5 or 6? anyways you buy the awesome shirt, hat, underwear, or ummmm napkin of your choice. Then you can take any image, or in this case you would simply open up Word or whatever program you use and write out the words you desire, choose font, color and size. put the paper in the printer, under printing options choose to mirror or invert image- especially important for words, cut around words, iron on to shirt and wala personalized awesome shirt for pretty much the cost of the shirt. ALSO if you want, you can add an image of  "S J" to your shirt, apron, napkin, shorts, whatever. Sweet huh? I think so!|`|YYAu9lFDaa	go to cafepress.com|`|zPFclJznaa	go to zazzle.com and make a customized one!|`|PSvc3sLdaa	San Jose, California, USA|`|938df05f7e46c8b204de6d111a903edcaa	you could make it your self    zazzle.com    customink.com|`|EsaFg8eaaa	You can have one made for you online.

lzZDTM9saa	http://www.ae.com  http://www.aeropostale.com  http://www.delias.com  http://www.alloy.com|`|G5pPaXAlaa	hollister sucksss.|`|hLdIO43Xaa	Definitely go to American Eagle or Charlotte Russe!  They have so many more sizes, esp. AE, plus they have lots of different washes and styles but the same general look as Hollister!    Everyone at my school wears AE or Hollister :]    I hope I helped! good luck!|`|ZQWEgFZ2aa	American Eagle seems like the only store that has many different sizes. Hollister and Abercrombie lean toward tall and skinny people.
gaQzqBb2aa	i know grace, she doesn't have a penis!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...  you r such a beeyotch.  GAWD.....................................|`|1cJJ2PfGaa	Just ask her, lol, nicely though!  And if it turns out to be her pad or something, tell her some better ones to get :P|`|AA11611176	Ask her!|`|aV0QmAOtaa	invite her swimming or shopping and try on clothes with her. or just sneak peek her in the girl's locker room or gym class. haha.|`|luZso4I9aa	see if he/she goesto the guys or girls loo|`|KWV6ZtBsaa	its not your buisness  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|7DJkwzKDaa	you must be bi...  who looks at that part of a girl!? xD  & why do you care hahaaa.|`|zECK1Shdaa	ask her|`|xgui1LAFaa	hahahahahhahahahahahahaha..... hahahahaa diiiiiiiiike|`|RfQnfYbqaa	ha ha!!|`|z1gUsqzHaa	AHAHAHAHAHA.  Sometimes people get awkward bulges in their jeans.  Or it could be a maxi-pad or something.|`|AA10420187	You can ask her or you can just mind your own business|`|k4DxnbMCaa	If it doesn't matter, there's no use in finding it out and then pointing it out. It will just be embarrassing for them, and mean of you.|`|a243bdff28f8938b1553bc0befe479d8aa	sack tap, if she is in pain then she has one.|`|VFKn8Vqbaa	Simple answer : Its not you so don't worry about it.  Imagine if she does and she thinks about the people who think about her having one.  Imagine yourself in her position|`|AA12166585	Two ideas come to mind.    1. Kick her in the alleged man part. If your kick really wasn't that hard and she acts like it was the worst thing ever than she probably has a man part.    2. Try watching an adult film with the alleged man-woman. If you see some stirring in the crotch than that may be the man-woman fighting an erection. Erection is a sure sign of having a penis. If one adult film doesn't work, you may want to try another. You can never be sure of this person's sexuality.|`|fHRgmJdNaa	OK, its most likely her pad. I wear pads and I get this weird bulgey thing, and I'm like Sh*t! I don't want people to think I'm a dude. So its probably that, and she's probably self conscious about it, so don't worry. Why does it matter? If you had one, wouldn't you not want people to think you had one?? You'd be very embarrassed. And maybe if she does she can't get a surgery yet or something. Just don't worry.|`|sp89XfT4aa	Ask her.|`|y3jRbaTQaa	WOAHHHHH    maybe its her pad.  LOL       WOAHHHH|`|z6qIZRFFaa	hahaha wow...well if you had gym together, and you were changing, then you could sneak a peak. or you could just ask her lol|`|i98X99Q8aa	Do you honestly think so??? Well don't ask her!!! wow.... ummm idk how to answer this.
oOZyl5BNaa	Okay well white, black and gray look good on like every skin color. But personally I would think a teal or turquoise on you would look great! Also, if you like pink... try a peachy shade... it looks really good with light brown hair! Don't wear brown though!! there will be too much brown!|`|rU1UyOAlaa	black  blue|`|O0S189PQaa	id say plum is a nice color
6nqSyISTaa	Oh - not to well, sorry. I used to have it but when i used it it left a big red rash scar thing on me - not to mention that the pain was killer!   I suggest returning it befor you open it.    Hope this helps.|`|LXxxAzIqaa	do you mean an epilator?  http://www.amazon.co.uk/Philips-HP6408-0...    yeah they work
nvo1zwrSaa	Yeah, I hate panty lines because they look trashy and weird..usually people stare too!    I wear thongs, but make sure they don't show because thats usually a sign of a slutty girl...well your a guy but still :)|`|58xXEE6Faa	haha you wear tights? im a guy to and i want tights!! what do you wear them with? i wear under armour with my skinny jeans but thats different i guess.|`|puIXFcCcaa	you should try thongs, that's what I did, and, after awhile, once you get used to them, they're really comfortable.|`|4793dc3cd4fd80d46ddf53b18e344fabaa	I buy no line underwear from Victoria's Secret. I doubt you will find anything there though. You could sure try.|`|d36Qi7jLaa	You should try Barelythere Invisible Look bikini panties.  They fit a guy great and no pantie lines.
zW4c2dyVaa	They have really great sales. You could get more than 10 for 200$. All of their stuff is really nice at low prices. You could get about 13-15 shirts. Good luck hun.|`|RI9itLSRaa	You can definitely find at least 10 for $200 (:  They have amazing sales all the time!|`|9Iykkiuzaa	About 20.|`|oqcqpmEOaa	like a millon there stuff is so cheap|`|xqoc4poWaa	most likey 10-13 for 200bucks  and like 13-16 for 240bucks  have fun! (:|`|GykCnbR7aa	at least 15|`|lOguMWVGaa	u will get more then 10 if they r on sale but dont spend ur $$$$ all at the same time buy it when they have good sales and u save a lot of money so then u can buy their shoes too instead of just tops
QcZpWf44aa	yeah but you most likley would have to get 00 in slim sizes|`|9D3i9s5eaa	yea you won't fit in them|`|92fyzJkcaa	amercan eagle-no  hollister-no  a&f kids yes.|`|om0zcFigaa	omg how would i know?|`|UnGThZYGaa	only one way to find out... you goota try 'em out.... (unless u want to do a bunch of calculations and whatnot....)|`|iWHv7j4Baa	You never know until you try! Try a short 00 and see if they work. I know the sizes there run kind of small.|`|01b9743a0b503849c2b30b5f6efcca49aa	the only way to fit in them is to try them on|`|AA10286634	You really should get tested for systemic problems (thyroid)|`|7nrhPCf0aa	you can fit into abercrombie kids because they're pants are cut for freakishly small people. not the other stores though, sucks for you|`|KcvinDvgaa	probably, but it also depends on your height.  Some nice places to find decent jeans for height and weight are:    +pac sun  +wet seal    Good luck! :D|`|jrfUS1mqaa	no you wont fit them yet.|`|UzqYQf0Jaa	don't worry i don't think your  anorexic im 80 and 13 so i no what you mean;) i do fit American eagle tops but i don't think about the pants so i don't no about you and the other stores but its always a good idea to try!|`|p3zydhsKaa	Yes, you can...and y not go try a pair on at the store next time you go to the mall???|`|2chpkWtiaa	Haha, nope you definitely wouldn't fit into those yet hon. Maybe wait a couple years or so. You should be atleast a size 3 in stitches jeans to fit into those stores.|`|U3laZTONaa	wow!!!! u have a fast metabolism!!!!!! i wish i had that!!!!    anyways yes totally you could fit in those jeans!!! go for it!!!! thay are cute!!|`|QlbaXYeLaa	yeah. ..I would say try their 00. ..If they are a little big buy a belt. ..     I love Hollister Jeans. ..They fit me perfect!  Go to the store and try them on first ..you can also ask someone to help you find a good fit.|`|UqvGKax1aa	just go try them on, each store is different so it's hard to tell if they will fit you.|`|73ee354f7bf2027a3e2d3c971ceb8834aa	You may fit in Abercrombie kids, but don't even bother trying Hollister or AE. I'm 92lbs and I STILL don't fi in them lol. I know what you mean about the metabolism, it sucks. Try going to Kohls and looking for the brand called Angels. They're the only jeans that fit me. I'm a 1/3 in them so you may be able to wear the 0s.|`|Z69OX0Gxaa	no, just keep wearing toddler-sized clothes

1LcSsHpzaa	take a razor and skim down your hair...i highly suggest to not do it at home since it could come out really crappy since your not a professional hair stylist...no offense. you might really regret doing it, so just to be wise, don't cut your hair yourself. i've done if before, and trust me, it wasn't a pretty sight. i had to go to the hair dresser the next day and she looked at my hair like i had snakes coming out of it.|`|FNzninfGaa	Now see by my definition, that's crap hair in that picture. Go to a different stylist and bring the picture with you this time to make sure you get what you want. I specifically tell my stylist how far above my shoulders I want my hair to come, whether I want my face framed or not, and how severe I want the angle of my cut to be. the result, every time, is the cut and length I wanted because that's exactly what I asked for.|`|3yEnot8Laa	idk....... go to the hair cuttery and show them your pic then they'll do it!!!! fo show|`|34K0QIzTaa	ok well.......start w/ the bob......make sure the line in the back is straight.....then go 1/2 an inch above it and take a third of ur hhair and cut! then do that again      then in the front.....give ur self a face frame, by taking ur hair in the front, and then chopping layers! i can't really explain on this.....but just gooo to a hairsylist!|`|AA11156937	I'm a hairstylist and that cut needs to get it professionally done with a razor NOT a scissor.  Make sure you let your hairsylist know ... some of them do not carry a razor (DON'T go to them.)|`|JbUfC9d0aa	I'm no hair cutter, but print the picture out and show a hairstylist that...|`|64b5ddb91a78f9cb5f26f04d8b418497aa	recommend that you get it done professionally! this is one of those haircuts that is adorable if pulled off correctly, but could be awful if messed up. so make sure its done right good luck!
SMsprdMfaa	I would say not to use chemicals on your hair.Why don't you go for some home remedies. Egg whites, lemon juice, oil massages, reducing stress and diet changes can reduce hair fall and make it healthier. You can find more cheap, effective and natural home remedies for hair loss as well as for healthy hair at http://www.wellnesstalk.org/hairfall.htm...

K5HsBuBgaa	Get layers!
dUHq4B4qaa	First you should do some research on your own. Google has some interesting sites. Anything from "ear gauging" to "flesh tunnels" will work.    The sizes can get confusing sometimes. This is a gauge chart: http://jewelry.about.com/cs/identifyjewe...  I'm going to guess that yours is either at a 20 or an 18. Choosing how big you go is entirely your desicion.     You might want to buy some tapers (ex. http://www.bodyjewelleryworld.co.uk/ESst... They make it so you can comfortably and safely go up from size to size. I didn't buy any until I got to 00 but I was really dumb about gauging my ears. The best advice would be to take it slow. Alot of the time people get excited and try to gauge at a rate that is too fast. If you're not careful and give each size enough time to heal you can cause damage like "blowouts", where the flesh is pushed out of the back or front due to gauging too fast, or microtears in your piercing. You need to keep them clean with soap and hydrogen peroxide. Most of all, be careful.     Here are some helpful websites:  http://www.bmezine.com/pierce/01-ear/A51...  http://www.arka-shop.co.uk/acatalog/ear-...  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stretching_...    Good luck and be safe!  Email me if you want more info or have any questions :)  moonsun5001@yahoo.com|`|s4iVl04raa	When I gauged my ears, I started off small with a tapered plug and worked my way up. Since you have your ears pierced with what I'm guessing was a piercing gun, since it's from the hairdressers, you probably have a 14g or 16g hole. You have the choice to either go to a professional piercing parlor and have them gauge your ears for you, sometimes jumping larger sizes in one sitting (it can be painful). If you really do just want a small one, I suggest doing it yourself gradually. You can purchase tapered plugs online here - http://www.bodyartforms.com/products.asp... . If you don't like their selection, google search "tapered plugs". To use them, they basically explain themselves. Just insert the plug in your ear like a normal earring and push it in to the widest section to stretch your ear. It'll be a little tight and uncomfortable for a while, but it goes away. Just keep your ears clean with normal ear cleaning products or rubbing alcohol. But, really I would recommend you go to a tattoo/piercing place or order online  sea salt spray like "h20cean sea salt aftercare spray" ( http://www.bodyartforms.com/productdetai... ) or another brand of the same stuff. Sea salt spray works the best! Start with a 12g, and work your way down to the size you want. (10g, 8g, etc). Good luck!    And ps, don't listen to these other people...Body Mods ARE sexy! :)|`|e2HW9iQ5aa	One of the stupidest things someone can do to themselves. Body mutilation is NOT sexy...|`|6f8ZKDJ4aa	You should think more about it before you do because a peircing like that will always be permanant and you don't want to wear an ear ring over it every day for the rest of your life would you. That's because your ear would look to weird without the ring.|`|TpJbtJCfaa	TURN OFF ALERT|`|elPLFotOaa	those are retarded.like pretty much for every girl its a turn off.so make sure you are sure before you do anything.|`|xwG6e7IQaa	Honest to god...I gaged my ear when I was 16...I took a 10 penny nail and shoved it through my ear making a regular 14-16 gage earring hole go to a size 6 gage...it was painful but I like a little pain from time to time...lol.  Use a tapering gage...no coloring...|`|ZX0dXmVkaa	they are called gages..and go to a professional piercer.|`|9lCulhIsaa	If you want a small one then you should get a small one. But no matter what it is gross. eww|`|LlMS9NsSaa	Ear Gauges.|`|NNmDDo39aa	ow.|`|4S6V4sb4aa	First off,, WHY,, bro thats nasty|`|gLEODIVdaa	ew that is gross|`|yT3ZNEROaa	The posts of your earrings are measured in gauges.  Over time you increase the gauge in your ear.  I think the smaller the number the larger the gauge.  You wear it for six weeks then squeeze in a larger one.  It takes time, and remember it irreversible.|`|oAyI70W5aa	they are called ear gauges.  so there are sizes. and you have to start with the smalles one which is a 12  and leave it for a week. then you get the other size which is a 9 and you leave that for a week. and then just progress to the size you want. start with lead shots.  here's a link of the sizes:  http://www.deltagearinc.com/ShotgunFacts...    but if you start with a 4 or something wayyyy big like that (way compared to normal piercing) it will bleed andd hurt ALOT.    :)      answermineplease  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|bAYVSfdJaa	All of these answers make me want to cry.  You got it right - stretching is the process, a gauge is a unit of measurement, and "gauging" is not a word.     Tunnels (aka plugs) are a type of jewelry, and I believe I've seen the smallest plugs at around 14g (the size of bellybutton piercings), but honestly, they just look like a stick with rubber bands on the ends to me.     I really can't give you much advice, other than do a lot of research on this & make sure you're well educated on stretching before you begin doing it.  And know that sometimes it is permanent, so if you don't like it, you're pretty much SOL.  Good luck.    Oh, and you can stretch yourself if you have some sort of idea of what you're doing,a professional isn't always necessary.|`|AlV10Equaa	ew|`|Wvj6o1XZaa	They're called gauges or plugs, and you should start out with size 16 bellybutton rings and work your way into smaller sizes.|`|WQjDQgB9aa	Plugs?|`|Ujb6P4gMaa	You have to start small and than you can go bigger but you shouldn't go that big because they never go back and when you get older it will not look as good.|`|Q0xB1aAXaa	Gauging your ear.  That's what its called.  Well, You have  21 gauge apparently.  Let it heal, if you want a Small one,  but you can still tell its stretched;  Go for a 6 or 4 gauge.  Cos if you don't like it; take it out and it will go back to normal size.|`|OGxC17M7aa	Go for it    My mate went from normal to a 6mm in one hit, dont do that lol, but i think 6MM-10MM is alright for a small size, my mates at 30MM now lol|`|fsGfQALoaa	Here's the thing...  Girls think it's gross...  Job interviewers don't like it...  It's there for life...  Don't do it.  If you must, try a 16g to start with then move up REALLY slowly...  16g is the highest you can really go and still not wear something in it without looking ridiculous...  Then again...  Having something in it looks ridiculous as well, but it looks even more ridiculous to have a huge hole in your ear and nothing holding it open...|`|CprHRUgHaa	The term of stretching out your ears are called Gaging, the lower you go the smaller the hole. For instance a size 16 is the size of a thick needle. However if you get like a size 1 it's about the size of a half dollar (if you live in the U.S.). If I'm not mistaken I believe everyone has to start out with a relatively small hole like 10 then gradually work your way to a larger hole by stretching it. Hope this helps!
xoXkHOVsaa	I wouldn't take it to school.  You don't really need it there at that age.    But for going out with your friends or shopping it would be fine.|`|RI9itLSRaa	You don't need to carry it to school, I'm assuming you still use a book bag so theres no need to carry it (:    You can always use it when you go out with your friends, to the movies or the mall or whatever!|`|KjF0p72naa	I didn't carry a purse till high school girl! Leave it at home if you don't want to wear it. If they like it so much, tell them to get one!|`|lNDKI4Yfaa	A Betsey Johnson or Betsyville?  If it's Betseyville, I don't see a problem with it.  However, if it makes you feel self-conscious -- obviously, others think it's great-- and you don't feel comfortable wearing it, then just carry a simple tote.    But IMO, a bag that gorgeous shouldn't be hidden--it should be shown off. :]|`|WqI4rCrhaa	Wear it girl! Betsey Johnson is very popular right now and not for old people! She's very colorful and young at heart.  You're not too young to carry a purse.  You're at an age when you'll need to start carrying one if you don't already.  There are lots of fun/not so fun things you'll have to carry around. From a lint roller to lip gloss.... Your pockets are only so big!  Carrying a Betsey Johnson would be a very cool thing for an 11yr old to do. ;-)|`|IIxAnsWdaa	you should totally carry it its your purse you like it you should wear it .   betsey johnson purse are cute i think its right for your age|`|8d6BxvGmaa	oooh get one of those giraffe purses or vera bradley|`|QCzVBHwNaa	i think you should because:  1st your gonna start wearing them when you get into high school  2nd you should be a trend setter and be the first on wearing a purse and i bet your friends will copy you and other girls too.|`|PGJKLZCVaa	A purse is in! more and more people are carrying a purse, and the big ones are whats in fashion right now. so carry one. they are cute! i love purses.|`|Ww2KnsvKaa	If u like it than who cares what other people would think.

Especially since your sister gave it to you. It's special and she would want you to use it.    You think you're too young to carry around a purse when i've used a purse since 4th grade, and was confident every step of the day :]    Really, carry it. I'm young and have about 30 purses. They're not for older women, they are merely a way of topping off an outfit or even pulling one together.|`|B06MKPbfaa	its ok to bring a purse to school when your 11 if you feel weird you just need to get use to having a purse

CJ3OsEO9aa	head and shoulders should do the trick.  or you could go to a supermarket or wherever sells different shampoo and look for one that says Anti Dandruff. There is different brands so one of them might work better for you.  I really suggest you use head and shoulders though|`|KjF0p72naa	Start to use Head and Shoulders or Selsan Blue shampoo with conditioner. Keeping your scalp healthy is key in this area.|`|HvSwCAqZaa	get head's and shoulders. it helps with dandruff- try it :]|`|nuISzHFRaa	Head and shoulders can take care of that. When you first start using it you will probably notice more dandruff than before, but that is because it is working all your dandruff out of your hair and moisturizing your scalp. After a couple of days you should see a difference.

iCHxt81haa	the discharge is normal. its just healing. now if it is hurting i would say it would be infected...but i think its fine..if you are still unsure about it you should go to where you got it pierced and ask them or if you didnt get it done somewhere go to a local piercing place and ask, they will be happy to help.|`|LhHAkqGiaa	It sounds like it.    Anything coming out of it that isn't normal is probably bad.|`|HvHBF8glaa	It's posible.|`|4ralMhFGaa	when i got mine done, mine had a discharge and it didnt hurt. then, after like a month and a half or two months it got crusty around it. then like 5-6 months later i cant even tell its there. so thats just a time frame ish thing.|`|5bde15709483c28deedecc65456b59a2aa	I've had mine pierced for years.  For about the first 6 - 8 months, it had little pockets of fluid that would ooze as i was cleaning or if the ring was moved.  Its normal as long as it doesn't hurt.  Just keep cleaning it and good luck.
7MKmxkjlaa	OMG i wish i had your hair !  i love the curly!!   9 !|`|HFQUMXvOaa	straight.  the wavy picture is kind of weird so i cant really see you. curly is a bit too fancy, maybe for formal gatherings.    you're pretty dont worry about it|`|jpbychDAaa	Straight hair definitely. I'm not seeing the Miley Cyrus comparison at all.   You're alright, but in a young-looking way. I'd go for more neutral shades with make-up, wear some jewelry and scarves, and maybe tweeze the brows a bit.  Best of luck! |`|kay9DFbdaa	yes i think you are, and curly looked best, or straight.    8|`|KEnfIzlEaa	first off miley and shaliene ain't ugly.

You're as lovely as you treat others and show kindness and manners to even the ones you don't like.|`|hsuMPDn9aa	You look absolutely nothing like miley Cyrus she is way prettier. Sorry but you posted so you asked for it. The second pic serves no purpose. You are not pretty I'm sorry but you're average. I would rate you a 5|`|1aSrTpbhaa	Aww honey you're better looking than Miley and more natural looking. She wears so much makeup, how would you ever know what she really looks like?  As for the hair, curly all the way.  I think curls are very attractive on most people and it gives you more volume than the straight hair.  Just ignore those haters, they're just jealous, as always.|`|jD27byGJaa	curly! you are way prettier than miley.|`|ADWIWx5Baa	Your hair looks really  pretty wavy  Your cute =)  8/10|`|tgVDf0Qmaa	i like curly the best and u look nothing like miley cyrus. ur a little above average and shes like average i guess.

AA12129117	Since your skirt is black ur lucky u can wear an type of shirt you want, best to go wit the brightest shirt in your closet or a bright color that accents your skin tone, i recomend a bright red, with red bead necklace and earings and a black shinny head band or a red head band, i prefer the black shiny one. oh and what color shoes are you wearing, if they are black thats ok must be flats! but if they are a different color than ur gona have to match it with ur accesories|`|AA11560249	u should wear a cap sleeve white ruffled shirt (maybe in silk)|`|PxfFBsMQaa	Wear a tight pink shirt or tight bright coloured shirt ..short sleve.|`|pqholNyqaa	lime green, flashy.|`|bBSAFsrhaa	you could just wear a singlet or a tank with it|`|PzbRJrTKaa	like a all plain color short sleeve shirt.|`|rAAHHYEWaa	i say a hot pink|`|FZ0sKgvzaa	i'd go for the classic white button up with it tucked in.. a fitted button up.. or like a bright color...|`|TSrPbjt3aa	a sleeve-less yellow top will a flurry collar|`|mszwZgoDaa	any colour tank top.  tucked into the skirt.|`|YTjpH9P1aa	Stupidest question ever. Why waste your points on this use less question?|`|AN98KWr3aa	I'd go with either a lime green, yellow or baby blue coloured tight shirt. With a skirt like that, it's a good choice. Unless it's too 'hardcore', you could try wearing a collar scar (Not sure what they're called, but those really short scarves that just go around your neck and tie in the front).|`|7iQYBYiiaa	You can basically wear anything with this skirt. Wear a bright, striking color to contrast the black. It would look lovely :]
jxRooBhUaa	nope. because they specialize in piercing with gun.  you can get ears or nose done in claires and stuff.    but you need to go to a parlor for eyebrow piercings.
lUyNM5uiaa	First of all, if you have a flat chest.... then you have a flat chest...    I wear a size 32A bra..... (I THINK THATS THE FLATTEST YOU CAN GO) And... if you don't believe me... ok whatever but I'm not putting up a picture or anything..... so just believe me.     Just trying to make yourself look like you have larger breasts is just putting yourself down. I do not stuff my bras or use push-ups. I flaunt my style.    It's okay to be flat chested, a lot of guys find it more attractive anyways. Look at those runway models and Keira Knightley.... THEY ARE GORGEOUS AND THEY HAVE NO BOOBS!|`|yhgRaBPXaa	he sounds really immature, and I wouldnt pay it any attention. Some guys say things like that because they are insecure about themselves and it makes them feel better to put others down. But, fyi, Victoria's Secret has some amazing bras that give a lot of fullness!|`|HFQUMXvOaa	heyy he jocked my poem!  i sent that to alll my friends:)  maybe he was joking and if he wasnt who cares!  im flat chested too i dont mind|`|jpbychDAaa	Well, if you don't think you're flat, I wouldn't listen to the 'perv.' A guy will call a girl fat for jokes even if she isn't fat, and a guy will call a girl flat even if she isn't flat.   If you really are worried, though, just buy a good push-up bra. You'd be surprised at how much of a noticeable difference there is.  Best of luck! |`|2EvkFausaa	There's really nothing you can do, and BTW, that poem is damn hilarious!!

cCUoSaYOaa	I looked at Walgreens, Sally's and the "As Seen on TV" store at my mall and none of them carried it.  I live in Los Angeles county.    I ordered them from the "Big Happie Hair" website and got them in 2 weeks.  They work really well.  If you can wait, I'm sure they will have them at these stores.  The box they came in was small.  Good luck!|`|3d9n1xQjaa	Its advertized on tv only, as of now but give it a month or two and you will find it at a Walgreens, or WalMart
CxriEMyjaa	no only if its leave in conditioner and it would saw it on the front!  i love john frieda! good choice!! i smells good!
yyDvNEJ8aa	you can always go to a good stylist and ask them their opinion about how they think your hair will turn out.  i use this shampoo called Mane n Tail. Its for unmanageable hair, and it makes it stronger and grow faster. its been proven. so you can always try that.
4AnOHrAPaa	Okay, can you be a little more specific/ Is there a look you're going for?How long is your hair? Do you like curls or what? need more info.
N5sfCg87aa	You should go to a stylist to get it done. My friend, Dylan, try to do his highlights by himself with dye from hot topic and it turned out awful.  He had to go to a salon because he could not fix it. But the stylist that did it fixed it, his name is Chris,  and got it the way Dylan wanted it. Now he always go back to Chris to get his hair done. Or if you must then buy good white dye and have a friend with some hair talent do it, after you look it up online. Good luck.|`|CtHi5L78aa	well i wouldnt do the white like in that picture or you are going to look like a skunk. but  i would do i pretty light blonde that would look alot better but yeah bleach and i would go to sallys you can get a kit for like eight dollars, good luck|`|b43c053e3ac43caf8628f3280701c547aa	Highlight peroxide kit    with hair toner...

Just need to make sure you feel good.  Shaving is probably the easiest|`|yhgRaBPXaa	get rid of it!|`|iRCBiPgZaa	shave it|`|HiuZs5G5aa	im a guy  and for me i don't care, but you bf maybe another story. personally i think if i guy is grossed out by it he is just immature, cause its a natural body thing. anyway, im not saying shaving isn't good, that is very nice too. but like they said, do what makes you comfortable.|`|5ZKqU2sIaa	Go and get it waxed because if you shave it you risk getting razor bumps and down there it hurts so bad!|`|nt1a0fMcaa	shave it all off evan around ur anus, sounds awful but theres nothing more embarrasin than been told to shave. trust me i know lol

FCWq1v6oaa	Almost everyone can see the paranormal.  If you think paranormal as in an ESP sort of thing then no, that comes with the brain and thought process.  Your question is kind of weird, which i love.  You can see ghosts, I have, it's nothing with you.  If you don't believe your senses aren't as sharp, so if you don't believe in ghosts, chances are you won't see anything.|`|JLmUdJwpaa	maybeee|`|z8GbX4LXaa	oooo wow   u got dat from dat movie|`|bKCHoz4caa	Have you seen The Eye!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|MksOlZaVaa	Hmm, I don't know, but that'd be cool! (And creepy)      Have you watched The Eye?|`|hs1Ah1Faaa	There is a possibility!   But i think a lot is of your mind set and mental and spiritual awareness.|`|URLq6zIDaa	watch the eye.
uS07WAwcaa	Here are some ideas:  Skinny jeans with a cute colorful belt boots a tank top and cute vest  Sundress with a cardigan and belt (over the cardigan)  Cute casual dress with leggings and pretty flats with a scarf :)  I hope that helps :]|`|AA10462002	Who cares??? IT's bowling...    just be comfy
URLq6zIDaa	sounds good, just make sure the sweater isnt too baggy, and i would probably go without the scarf. the point of auditions is to see your body shape and if it works, and not to dress up with accessories. Most all castings I go to they want it way simple, and normally in heels...|`|Zp4fCCKjaa	i like it it's simple,maybe the scark shouldn't have a pattern,just one color like black.  dark jeans are good.  the cardiga should be a little oversized.      ....  and SIZE ONE.....SKINNY!!!  xoxoxox|`|tnoyKjJ1aa	to me it seems a little boring and common.. you might want to add something with color that way you will stand out.. and bright colors tend to put people in a good mood|`|l1VA4W6kaa	I think it is good, but if it is not very formal, if it is like a serious audition, i would dress up a little more.|`|ucZOCMyAaa	good, but ditch the scarf.|`|3KPPtupLaa	the outfit is cute but i would make the scarf a different color:  http://www.wetseal.com/catalog/product.j...    it doesnt have to be that one exactly..but it would be cute if it had some color because the outfit has a little too much black...also make the tanktop a colored one too..all the outfit needs is  a little more color..lol|`|hfLA5Edxaa	I think it looks simple and chic. Because for an audition they want you to look simple and nice not coulerful and crazy.
uS07WAwcaa	im thinking shaggy side bangs :)|`|IsngcqVAaa	you can do front bangs with short hair.  or  side bangs with shaggy or layered hair.
DuPAkdkxaa	huh?

6nqSyISTaa	1) Go get it cut at a salon - ask them to thin it out a lot.  2) Buy a straightner - get nice ones for less at Target.  3) Take a shower and use Herbal Essences "Pin Straight" Shampoo & Conditioner  4) Apply some conditoiner spray (look in Seventeen magazine for great products)  5) Blow dry, then straighten at 325 degrees or higher. Be careful not to burn yourself - it hurts!    Hope this helps.|`|YJCG2kn1aa	get a straightener that will work good for ur haair  chi or somethingg|`|TiFgKM87aa	garnier it works it controls frizz makes hair wavy and grows 10xs stonger and thicker i use it and its really good and no need to pin down frizz|`|d2NW4GwCaa	Well the only reaaal way is to thin it, but if you really don't want to. Then try really hard to straighten it toooo the best of your abilityyy. And at least get choppy layers. AT first i didn't wannna get my hair chopped and thinned, but then i was like whatever. and i did it and it looks greatt. so yeahhh.  :)  Good luck
iJlqUY4jaa	semi formal. wear some black dress pants and a nice blouse or top. no jeans
hfLA5Edxaa	Ohh don't worry about what other people think i love to experiment so i wear pretty crazy things to school sometimes. People just don't get high fashion they only know fashion like hollister. Which i'm not saying is bad. But i'd make the scarf thinner.

Option 2: Mashed banana and oatmeal skin mask (homemade - The banana nourishes and moisturizes but it doesn't make your skin oily, I do it all the time and its great!)  Option 3: Dab a bit of lemon or lime juice on a breakout and leave overnight to dry out the zit.  Option 4: The good old toothpaste-on-the-zit-overnight trick. Some people claim that it works.

SEUg7HIXaa	You can have the buchal fat pads removed from your cheeks but as you age it will look awful because as you get older your face hollows out. Women pay thousands of dollars to have fat injected into their cheeks to look more youthful. Look into learning how to contour with makeup. It can accentuate the parts of your face you want.|`|AWQMgEjXaa	You have baby cheeks! A lady, girl, or teen should be comfortable with the way she looks. That is what makes you unique as a individual and you should capitalize on the distinct trait not try to hide it.

I suggest you put your hair in tiny little braids at night.    First you wash your hair, then you make tiny braids and use small rubberbands. Make the braids where ever you want it to be crimped. The bigger the kinks, the bigger the braids. SO if you want like tiny crimpings, make tiny braids.    And voila! You just saved $$!(:|`|ve0sWDThaa	go order it off conairs website.. or go to a beauty supply store..theres a whole bunch of plces to get a crimping iron.but i would just go to www.conair.com|`|FQ81VQvtaa	i love  http://beautychoice.com/
tvF86mRDaa	Don't do anything else yourself! Wait and see a colour specialist at your hairdressers/salon. They can usually do something to minimise what you've done or dye it all over in one colour. I wouldn't recommend home colouring as you've got no one to blame if it goes wrong and you should be trained to do it in the first place!|`|ocIsJXHGaa	there is a hair dye removal kit you can buy, it'll make your hair orange all over. you can dye your hair right after with your choice of color.|`|PeNTl6KOaa	colour it all back to ur normal brown hair then go to the hairdressers to get the blonde highlights    xx|`|ro3X9fs3aa	best thing you can do is to die ur hair one color ,best is brown to cover what u have done , dont ever experiment with ur hair again|`|9IWjCz7Gaa	ok u need to be specific. when ur hair had blonde highlights was that done by bleach or a tint?? if u dont know it'll be more tricky!  basically ur hair has gone blue/grey because it has no warmth in it. to replace it u need to dye it with a brown but with red undertones. however your roots are the complete opposite! so ud need an ash brown on the roots?! i really suggests you go to a good hair salon because otherwise you could loose or seriously damage your hair by dying it too much!and thats not worth it! just get it fixed and then never do it urself again... thats what i did!  also once its fixed, regularly use a conditioning oil to nourish and moisturise your hair as it will be dry from all the chemicals in the colour dyes.|`|sSlRzn2iaa	use john frida shampoo and get it re dyed at macs in london|`|UNrWM5omaa	hahahah  go to a salon and ask them to fix it, im sure they can|`|PjKJHNlYaa	try to leave it a couple of weeks if you can and just go back to your brown colour.|`|w1bgyng3aa	go see a professional.......but maybe try dying it back to a natural blonde  (makes sense)
koX1ymC0aa	whateva dress you find that you like whether it's long or short|`|bvnzv923aa	I'd wear a long one. It's the prom after all! People usually wear long dresses anyway, they have been for years. Do you really wanna have dated prom pictures? It's one of the only excuse in your life (except your wedding...) that you have to wear  your chilhood fantasy Princess dress!|`|rAeAtbQeaa	Long would be more formal, but pick which ever one you like.|`|BuRYBUmBaa	I think the longer dresses are more traditional but tbh if you wanna wear a shorter dress there is nothing stopping you. If you think you'd best suit a shorter dress then go for it. (:|`|igrdohopaa	Short but ew no not that one!|`|KJMNhiDxaa	i'm not even close to graduating, (3 and a half more years of high school!), but I know that when it comes time for me to go to prom, the longest i'm wearing is knee length. i hate those floor length dresses.
b2f5cc892d9a2ff6d43172b4bb022096aa	It's Winter,  and at least for me,  that always kicks up a storm of static electricity.   Like now even if I touch the car handle I get a little shock !  The dryer sheets are the most sensible, quick and easy way to go, until Mother Nature's balance gets restored.|`|AA11024148	get a humidifier. the air around you is too dry.  there aren't many products you can use that won't make your hair flat and nasty.|`|63fac70b06cbb446e789a7507026ce27aa	a combination of your shampoo and straightening could be causing it... i would recommend switching shampoo and pat your hair with those Bounce sheets that you put in the dryer for your laundry.. it really works!|`|twVyisGnaa	I don't know how to get rid of it, but the cause of it might be from something that you put your head on a lot.    VIVA LA RAZA!|`|CdRlOsnyaa	use a dryer sheet just tilt your head to the side and place the sheet in one hand and make sort of like a sandwitch with your hair haha like hand dryer sheet hair other hand and run from top to bottom.. also you could try this salon product called Bio Silk it works great and you will only have to apply it once untill you wash your hair again there is similar products like bio silk by paul mitchell they all work great but only use a dime size or smaller if your hair is thin or else you hair may appear greasy.. just put the bio silk in the palm of your hand rub hands together and then run your fingers through your hair|`|8cLLhDrfaa	straightening can do it.  take a little bit of lotion (any kind will do) and rub in in between your hands. then rub it over your hair. DONT USE TOO MUCH OR YOUR HAiR WiLL BE GREASY!|`|cObd7Mdqaa	The axact same thing happend to me until I found the perfect solution.  You know those dryer sheets people throw in the drying machine?  Run those over hair every couple hours and it takes the static right out..plus makes your hair smell good!|`|wDnP5b0Oaa	Use drier sheets on your hair and Treseme shampoo works wonders!
EA5IN1BQaa	Best thing is patients!  Get it trimmed on a regular basis, like every 6 weeks.  Only have a small amount cut, like half an inch.    I am growing my hair out and I find that washing it every second or third day helps keep it healthy and shinny.  Try not too straiten it often, only if your going out.  As for products, I dont know of any, just a deep conditioner once a week.  Keeping it healthy is probably a main thing in letting it grow long.|`|f9Cn5Y2xaa	well vitamins, vitimin b-complex, a and e!!!!  i know that prenatal ones grew mine but it could of been hormonal.    also infusium works, not getting split ends, use olive oil  at night on ends so hair wont split.    drink lots of water and eat healthy foods like frsh veggies n fruits.|`|Fm6QHfogaa	ok well i work at a jello factory and if u eat red jello ur hair will grow  longer.    oh im im not sure about this one but green jello makes it shinier.  :)
y7htnSs4aa	Well since its only semi formal you should just keep it kinda simple.  If your hair is curly then you should straighten it and maybe put a bump in the front like this     http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v24/fa...      If you hair straight hair then maybe you or your mom or your friend can put some loose curls in your hair like this     http://img2.timeinc.net/people/i/2007/st...|`|JNMVtR6raa	i had a style for my aunties wedding , it wasnt much but i liked it..  first i had my hair curled,   then the hairdresser got a few strands of curls   and clipped them together with slides at the back|`|63fac70b06cbb446e789a7507026ce27aa	depends on what type of dress you have!    i think curled hair is always classic and goes with most anything!
eO4y3m1maa	The trend right now for hipsters is sort of mixing vintage attire with a slim fitting sort of clothes. So alot of colors you wouldn't think that would match, prints that wouldn't normally match....there is a huge variety.    But skinny jeans, the shoelace is a good idea, tank top with maybe a vest? high top sneakers? flat shoes?     look on americanapparel.net or urbanoutfitters.com for ideas!
e1434520b7d6b7db2b483084c9ad434aaa	1. Try to find a stylist who knows how to work with curly hair. You can find reviews by region here: http://www.naturallycurly.com/curlsalons  2. Don't shampoo every day, since it's pretty drying. On the days that you don't shampoo massage conditioner into your scalp with your fingertips.  3. Comb conditioner through hair in the shower. (You're already doing that.) :)  4. Apply styling products to dripping wet hair. Scrunch or twirl hair to achieve desired shape. Use styling products suited for your hair type. Dont know yours? http://www.naturallycurly.com/hair-types  5. Scrunch out some moisture with linen, paper towels, or t-shirts instead of a normal terry cloth tower (makes it frizzy).  6. Add a little more gel and scrunch some more.  7. Air dry or use a diffuser with your blowdryer.  8. Don't touch (or brush!) your hair while its drying.  9. Once completely dry scrunch out any crunchy texture.    For hair type specific products check out these forums:  http://www.naturallycurly.com/curltalk/  There you can find others with the same hair type and try out some of their favorite products. I would recommend something, but I dont know your hair type. :)    Lastly, it has made my hair so much better since I started the curly girl method! I used to almost never wear it down (it was a frizz/poof ball), but now I have pretty, shiny curls. ~:) Its pretty radicalno sulfates (shampoo) or siliconesbut its so great for curly hair. Give it a shot and check it out:  http://www.wikihow.com/Follow-the-Curly-...  http://www.ylcf.org/gotcurl/ (outdated product recs!)    Some other great curly care sites:   http://www.youtube.com/user/jessicurl|`|f8a1395066a4e7dd0ff6d7f82d96ab35aa	Get a good brush like a denman and this will help define your curls when you detangle. Only detangle with a comb if you have straight hair.
tu7lIWSnaa	I think your hair is pretty the way it is.  Bleaching it and dying it make your hair brittle and dry, I would just leave it alone. Plus when you go blonde you have to keep up with the roots.|`|JNMVtR6raa	i think you shud stay brown, but add a few blonde streaks ,   thats what i did x|`|pVGROTKHaa	I'm sure it would look fine, but if you wanted to see what it looks like without any long term effects, try doing this in summer (or if it's warm and sunny where you live, then anytime). Take a shower, then while your hair is still wet, rub lemon juice into your hair and go outside for a while, as it dries. The sun will bring out blonde and it looks really nice. It darkens after you stop going outside all the time (winter) but this way you could see how it looks before you get it done.|`|L6FH285zaa	YESS! u would look so pretty blonde. im 14 and died my hair blonde once and my original hair color is like selena gomez. it was cool, but i died it back.|`|pZXdqXNQaa	i wouldnt i would go darker or a deep red!    i know what im talking about its my job to help people with ther hair and i honestly dont think it would suit you!    good luck!|`|V835xv3kaa	Light brown would look better and more natural.

Do not go blond.|`|yba3UWb6aa	Yeah, I think it would look pretty good on u.|`|Jqsn8UTRaa	not really hun, you should dye it black with a blond streak, or brown with a blond streak|`|4tHZunfUaa	Blonde would be okay  but,   red would look AMAZING on you!|`|wDnP5b0Oaa	Not too blonde. I have blonde hair (natural, never died it) and I hate it. If you want to do anything with your hair I would go a little darker or a hint of red. You are very pretty by the way!|`|f9Cn5Y2xaa	absolutely|`|h3t4Uewvaa	yeah go for it! you have a good complexion for like a ash/honey blonde  i used to be blonde until about 2 months ago & my skin tone & hair & eyes are the same as bella from twilights (:   so yeah go for it, but do it gradually by highlights  & get it done at a salon (:  the only bad things about it are is that you get roots, its expensive, and in the long run it really can damage your hair|`|9AUmp5jWaa	Your complexion is fair so you have to be very careful what color you use.  Professionally speaking, start with highlights.  You can do dark blonde low lights with a few light blonde highlights.  It looks more natural if you have more than one color in there.  Don't worry about the eyebrows, you are keeping your hair color (which is a great color) so you don't need to touch the brows.  Depending on where you live, it should cost you no more than $75.  First go to a salon and get a consultation, then decide if you want to do it.|`|fMbn7p83aa	you would probably be able to pull it off.  if you do, dont make it too light,  you should use the color "macadamia" by garnier nutriesse.  i have that and it looks great.  we also have the same eye color and it looks fine.  :)  blonde hair with dark eyes does NOT make you look sickly.  it's way better than with blue eyes ;)    anyway, blonde hair does wash you out some (you look less tan)  so you should use that jergens face moisturizer that makes your face tan :)      but if you decide not to go with blonde,   you should get dark brown. it would be gorgeous with your face  and your eyes    :D      but you could also leave it the same,  it looks beautiful.  NO HOMO :)|`|xJtbUV6Haa	Yea, you could pull i off. Good luck w/ the honors!|`|hVKYVJ89aa	it would be a dramatic change, but i think you should go for it, definitely  xo|`|WEhtWnl2aa	i THINK YOU'D LOOK BETTER WITH JUST SOME HIGHLIGHTS. YOUR EYES ARE VERY DARK FOR BLONDE HAIR IT MIGHT MAKE YOU LOOK SICKLY.|`|yg237qWSaa	I think you could,, but you'd look better with darker hair|`|DpK6P8cUaa	Yes, you can dye your hair, but I prefer a black on you. And you have beautiful flowing hair. And good luck with your honors. I hope you the best.    Your Welcome,  Victoria :)
iYL37RfPaa	Sorry love, but no matter what you use, it going to go orange,    Honestly the hairdressers is the best option,  i no you don't want to,  but it will be worth it, and it won't go orange!!    xo|`|sSlRzn2iaa	garnie hair dye is the best its natueal and good 4 ur hair or get it done at macs salon in london|`|cGK3c1A7aa	hairdressers is the only option if you don't want to mess up your hair|`|aVgXJmZsaa	I've been a hairdresser for 28 years. Believe me, you should go to a professional for that process. Coloring hair is alot more involved than most think. You could end up with several different colors if you don't know what your doing.
AA11024148	hard q to a.  there are several brands of perms.  there are even more ways to perm. you can perm on perm rods; vertical or horizontal or spiral. you can perm on rags, plastic forks, rollers, toilet paper holders - ANYTHING as long as it's not metal.  you can have a directional perm; body perm, thickening perm      really hard to tell without seeing and feeling it and knowing how much time you spend on it, what products you use etc.    go get a consultation

Sorry, I'm sure you're very nice though.|`|0LHw7Ve5aa	I think that it's WAY nicer spelt 'Caitlin'  Mm, I have a friend called Caitlin, she's gorgeous, pretty, funny and lovely, so I think of her  But when I see the name typed 'Kaitlyn' I think it's a bit trailer trashey|`|BpYwAwIOaa	I think of some one sporty and like tom boyish maybe ven latina or white.|`|u6HndVxaaa	for some reason i think of knitting..sorry that wasnt very helpful was it|`|p0Xw8hLZaa	the hockey goalie's name on my field hockey team =)    and she is an AMAZING goalie too!!|`|oXff24y0aa	lmao there's this fat girl in my class who is messed up and her name is kaitlyn,  so whenever i hear that name is reminds me of her =]|`|GBEgFS19aa	lol this is pretty weird. but when i hear 'kaitlyn'  it sorta reminds me of britney spears' sister  jaime lynn.. i guess its cuz of the 'ly' part :)|`|pG6hOnNkaa	My best friend :)|`|QeO8t3eCaa	i think nerd hha honestly. theres a lotta wierd kaitlyns lol.|`|ftmmWpqbaa	A dorky kind of person.. who's quite sweeet, but realllly shy.|`|ygELhfO6aa	I think of my friend Kaitlyn who I haven't talking to in forever...and if you say it out loud I think of this annoying girl in my science class...except she's Caitlyn.

ExAXPJrtaa	Lengthening shampoos don't actually lengthen your hair, they just protect your hair from damage so that it is able to grow longer. There aren't any Miracle growth products out there, there are just tips to keeping your hair healthy. Using hair protectors, conditioners, and giving your head massages so your follicles don't get clogged should all help.    Hair grows about a half inch a month.    Hope that helps :)|`|ocIsJXHGaa	my hair grows super fast, I think is because I wash it a lot. I don't use any chemical and I use suave for shampoo. It would probably take me 3 to 4 weeks for my bangs to grow that length.|`|4tHZunfUaa	I don think growth products will work  everything artificial is stupid    hmmm,,,  im not totally sure  its been REALLY long since i had bangs straight across  I have the sort of bangs that u want now  I Guess u should just let your hair grow then go to the salon and get long side bangs with layers =D

0EaA6IACaa	you definitelyyyyy want to wear clothes from the store because the managers want to see what you look like in them because thhats what we're selling.     wear a cute pair of jeans(doesn't have to be from A&F, but it helps), preferably the erin dark was skinny jeans from A&F since they are part of the "key look" you have to wear when you work there, and a navy, gray, or white shirt from A&F. whatever you do, do notttt wear black(we don't sell black clothing).    don't wear alot of makeup because abercrombie is all about the "natural look". if you wear any at all i would just wear mascara. if you want to wear eyeliner, use brown, it's not as harsh as black.    wear minimal jewelry, stick to studs in your ears if you have your ears pierced. don't wear anything too flashy.    and yes flip flops are ok because we have to wear them year round    good luck =]|`|pprrcLVhaa	just wera the shirt and jeans and be yourself|`|R7vwxGMmaa	I would wear something you would wear to work there.

Best Answer ?|`|5f4df7a0d6349251e2eb823b66ee0625aa	it doesn't hurt when you're getting it pierced it probably hurts a little more than the ears. the real pain is later on in the day when it kicks in, its like piercing you're ear cartilage.|`|jDk2ybrWaa	it feels just like getting your cartlidge pierced.  it dont hurt at all.  on a scale of 1-10.  i give it a 2.  the only thing that really hurts is when he has to pull the needle thru to get the jewerly in.|`|MxdOSmKUaa	Nope, doesn't hurt at all.  I'd rate it a 2.  It hurts less than an ear piercing.  But it actually depends on YOU.  Someone could say it doesn't hurt,  but it might hurt like a bxch to you.  Or someone might say it hurts a lot,  and you may not feel it.    I didn't feel it. at all. :]|`|xZW4XjnOaa	Not at ALL.  i got mine done three times b/c it kept getting infected. .  and it never hurt any of the times.  i was really nervouse the first time cuz i thought it would hurt really bad but when it was over i felt cheated cuz i got all nervous over nothing. lol.  to me getting my ears pierced was more painful.  so yea, not at all.|`|fna0OfuCaa	It didn't really hurt that bad when I got mine, I'd give it like a 1 on a scale of 1-10..

QMYNU9uNaa	They are both really good high quality brands. Juicy Couture is targeted towards younger girls, while Coach has styles that are young as well as more classic ones too. If you are looking for a fun, funky bag then I would recommend Juicy, but if you're looking for something with more of a classic touch then I would go with Coach.|`|bL3rzrEYaa	Coach. Definitely.

Definitely keep your hair curly for the pictures because straight hair can look flat on camera. For your makeup, go natural. A little foundation to hide flaws, a peachy or pink blush in the apples of your cheeks, a little brown eyeliner if you want&a neutral eyeshadow(:    Good luck!

Or in a ponytail, but actually it comes down to the shape of your face, if you have an oval face, you can get away with anything. I    If a round face stay away from width and bulky hairstyles at the side of the face shoot for height at the crown of the head.    If you have a long almost rectangular face then volume to the sides of your face.    If you have a heart shaped face go for a part on the side look.    If you have a square face softness around your face is ideal and layers are good, tapering at the neck and neckline are very flattering.

I don't like this at all the hat and the leggings, uggh, no sorry|`|3oGGTIHgaa	Yeah I would wear that|`|AVjUNU5waa	SOOO CUTE. maybe change the mat to a black one but it doesnt matter. that outfit is sooo cute. i would so wear that.|`|jeG9JECKaa	Yes its very cute, i think the colours go well but you might need some black shorts or a skirt over them leggings!|`|9NwZWBokaa	i love it! i wish i could dress up like that...doesn't really fit my shape though
fXUlPjSIaa	I think so too and predicted that last year. People are so concerned about skin cancer now they don't use tanning beds and sunbathe as often. Also the book Twilight probably made pale skin desirable again (even though I didn't like the book). Also people are becoming less superficial and fake. YAY FOR LOOKING NATURAL!!! I'm so glad it's happening, now I'll fit in because I have always liked both of those better.|`|RETXZzeiaa	well its good for me i guess. ive got pretty pale skin, dark brown hair, and 34B boobs.|`|Fu1emcF3aa	No.    Small boobs will never be more attractive than large boobs.

idhcqr5Daa	The best solution is to see a dermatologist. They know what they're doing. All they do is look at your acne and order some medicine for it then you must buy it and the acne disappears within a week.   After using any of the above-recommended acne medications (benzoyl peroxide, etc.), be sure to apply a gentle moisturizer over it in case you have sensitive skin.   Tinted moisturizer works well to cover pimples up, but this DOES NOT mean you have full sun protection.   Make sure all the products you use are non comedogenic or non acnedemic. This mean that it does not clog pores.   Use any daily wash acne treatment regularly in the morning and night. It is better to use brand names like Avon or Mary Kay since they have perfected their techniques over the years, and are sold worldwide for something.   Drink Water.   Stop the Spread of Acne - Apply acne medication about half an inch around the affected area to help keep the acne from spreading. Acne moves across the face from the nose to the ear, so you need to treat beyond the inflamed area. Most people make the mistake of treating only the pimples and not the outlying areas of skin. This is wrong.   Wash your pillowcase often and always use clean face towels. Dirty towels and pillowcases can harbor bacteria and germs that can make acne worse.   Put some baking soda into your cleanser to take out all the oil in your pores. Only do this 3 times a week.   Try to prevent over-exposure to sunlight. Over-exposure to sunlight can dry out the skin and cause breakouts. If you are out in the sunlight very often, use a suncreen, preferably spf 35+.   Sunburn increases the risk of skin cancer considerably!   Do not use too many different types of acne medication at the same time. It can cause more irritation and increase your acne.ex. dryness,painful to the touch, peeling...   Consult a doctor if your acne is open or bleeding.   Consider seeing a doctor as well if the acne has become cystic or highly inflamed. If you do not treat cystic acne there is a high chance of it scarring your face.   Benzoyl peroxide-based products usually bleach hair and fabrics. Be extremely careful using them around brightly colored or dark colored fabrics, as you can end up with ruined towels and shirts. (You may want to only use white towels and sheets while using these products).   Make sure you are not allergic to products/ingredients mentioned in this article before using them.   Be careful with what prescriptions you take! Some oral prescriptions, including Accutane and similar products, can cause irreversible liver damage. Talk to your doctor or dermatologist before taking them.   At the fitness center is where you can get tons of nasty acne; always wear gloves and use lotion.   Don't buy multi-step "active" style solutions. If you read the labels, they contain the same active ingredients that other over-the-counter acne medications contain: salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide, or sulfur.     x0x0_LEi|`|IfKz9cpDaa	Probably it's a acne. I have some to. Never touch it with your hands!  I'm not really sure about it but after washing your face u gotta put some lotions on. It's not gonna take a short time. It takes a while. Take really long. But if you keep take care of it everything will be fine ^^|`|LSrxN4Qnaa	get proactiv. my brother had really bad acne before but he used that and it went away. its pretty good
WYa3UY6Gaa	Well where I go they don't charge by the hour....Or if they do they don't....say they do lol...      $75 is way to cheap though.      They just charge by the amount of detail...size....    The cheapest tattoo I have was $60, and it was a name it only took like 10 min.|`|MsBoH20Iaa	You get what you pay for. I f you find someone cheap (50-100 an hour) make sure you see a lot of their work first. Not just the flash crap that hangs on the wall for any idiot that wanders in to choose from. Ask to see some original work.|`|om4Szik7aa	That really depends on where you go. I had mine done, at Nikki's in Charlotte NC, and it was around an hour and I paid $100. The tattoo is 6x4 inches, with many colors. I do not know what her prices are now, but I was very happy with her work, and will go back when I want another one. Here is her site: http://www.nikkistattoostudio.com/  My husband had one done for $30, it took 45 minutes, but he had a friend that was making a portfolio and so they got them cheap. but I also think sometimes it depends on the design.|`|9e0b3eb053495521ed772cef2058be0faa	I'm curious too. I pay $100/hr (canadian) for my artist and it's a steal. It's pretty standard pricing here, but he's way better than your standard artist.    The only people I've ever met that charge less are tattooing out of their living rooms. *shudder*|`|JafLyLYgaa	http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v242/m...    I got that from Timeless Tattoos in Atlanta. On peachtree industrial I think? Wasnt the largest shop, but they had good people there, and some amazing portrait/face artists.     That tattoo cost me 250, and I gave him a 50  dollar tip I believe. It was more expensive then most, but they had a very good reputation, and I drove almost 2 hours to get there. Ryan Knight did my tattoo. I went there knowing it was going to be more expensive. Atlanta has a LOT of bad tattoo places (ink wizards, ,good clean fun), those are 2 I think of off the top of my head.    Good luck!|`|Z5sKsrBFaa	I was always told good tattoos are not cheap and cheap tattoos are not good.|`|c398e7ae6f2789a3d3c5f715afc652a3aa	Mine was $89, took an hour, but mine was also a VERY simple design with only 3 colors.  It also helped that I had already drawn it myself and presented them with a colored pencil drawing of how I wanted the finished piece to look.  All they really had to do was make the stencil then do the piece.  This was at a shop in Ann Arbor, MI, that closed when the owner moved to Chicago.    Some artists will charge according to the amount of work that goes into the piece.  If it's simple, with few colors and no shading, you may not have to pay as much as you would for a piece with multiple colors and shading.  Remember, you're also paying for the ink and the needles used.    If I had a very detailed piece with a lot of shading which required them to also sketch it out and color the sketch, I would have definitely paid well over $130 per hour.    My next piece, which will be more detailed and have way more color and shading, I'm having done by my friend's artist who owns the Skin Kitchen in Des Moines, IA. He's wickedly expensive, and DsM is a 600-mile drive from me, but I've seen his work (he's also inked most members of Slipknot) and it's amazing...well worth the travel and the cost when I go to get it done.  I figure there's no such thing as "too expensive" or too far to travel if I want a tattoo that will look good since it'll be on me the rest of my life.  It'll cost me around $1000 by the time it's finished but it'll be worth it.     ETA: this guy charges about $200 per hour and he's worth every cent from what I've seen on my friends who've had work by him.    So if you want a really amazing piece, Skin Kitchen for sure.|`|UYnZtJ2daa	http://s8.photobucket.com/albums/a17/Ran...  This was done by Trevor at Falcon's Tattoo in Columbus, GA. I've never had anyone give me an actual "It's going to take this long so it will cost this much" figure...they always just charge me up front. I paid $200 for this tattoo (without tip) and it took almost two hours.     http://s8.photobucket.com/albums/a17/Ran...  And this guy was done at Ivory Tower Tattoo in Statesboro, GA...he took about an hour and a half and I paid $125.     http://s8.photobucket.com/albums/a17/Ran...  Was done by Falcon at Falcon's Tattoo in Columbus. (Says "imagine" at the bottom) Took no longer than 45 minutes and I paid $60...but I was a regular there.     Finally...  http://s8.photobucket.com/albums/a17/Ran...  Brian Pittman at Dandyland Tattoo (moved away and no longer working there) in San Antonio, TX. He worked kinda slow and it took about 3 and a half hours and I paid $280.     Yes, cheap tattoos are not always great tattoos. However, I have gotten pieces that were exactly what I want for a pretty fair price. Just because a place doesn't charge a lot of money doesn't mean they are automatically a bad place.    Honestly, it seems like you created this just to bash on people. Do you not have anything better to do? The picture does the tattoo no justice because it is impossible to take a picture of your own back. However, because the original artwork is very simple I wanted it to look that way. No one likes someone who thinks they are superior to others simply because of the tattoos they have. It's not a very good quality in a person.
04e17c3e8b1cb3d89e9637ab648c5be8aa	i wouldn't go out with him. he wanted your friend more and what if his feelings don't change for her? It would be awkward and you will always wonder if he is thinking about her. forget him. yuk.|`|itmO3yk2aa	honestly, the fact that he asked her out 8 times makes him sounds kind of pathetic.. idk, i wouldn't date him if i were in your shoes, but it's up to you really     is your best friend okay with it?    |`|2wrpp5qnaa	Okay, this might be a weird coincidence, but that happened to two of my BEST FRIENDS!!    So, my best friend that WASN'T the original girl that was asked out, finally got asked out by "Steve" and she said yes, even though he asked her friend many times and she said no. Anyways, right now, they are still together, TOTALLY in love, and the girl he originally liked does not have any harsh feelings!    Trust me, you only have one life to live, so make the best out of it.

I would always question his motives after that.  If your friend doesn't mind, then go out with him.  You don't have much too lose on just one date.  Be prepared though, just incase he's using you to get close to her.  I've seen that scenario play out before.  Good luck.|`|ITJxXhQ0aa	i would give it a chance..maybe he will stop liking her or realize she wont ever go out with him and then he will be all yours! looks dont matter..i say go for it!!|`|VegwUJiCaa	move on and dont wait for him  he's a fking flirter who likes both of u.|`|Fq7FHQ44aa	i think u should wait.. u dont want to be in any uncomfortable situation with ur best friend..|`|Wf04PCbjaa	personnally i wouldnt becuase i would always feel like the reject, liek the second choice. hes not such a great guy if he says that he likes you both then asks out ur friend...AGAIN!    im sur ethat he Is very nice, btu as afriend. not a BF.
VtPZmOC1aa	When doing highlights, always do them first then the cut.

I've used homemade masks before but they are a waste of time.    You can google and see all the positive comments about this stuff.  It is cheap, I got mine for $1.50.    What it does is make your face smooth like silk, and pulls all the bacteria and pore clogging matter out. Give it a try!|`|9F0iuuMYaa	Avocados!|`|tjuqgRlraa	I tottaly am in agreement with Illy's answer.  Sugar is definitely a good scrub for oily skin.|`|NiFjl37haa	this really works.i tried it after i got a nasty breakout and it cleared up in three days.    get a whole cucumber and peel it.  get an avocado and peel it.    then you put them in a food processor.but if you don't have one a blender works.apply it for 30min a day.    hope i helped.
c5anDswjaa	Weight has nothing to do with it! It all depends on your anatomy and whether it would accomidate a piercing.. You dont have to be skinny to get piercings!     If you do get it done, fair warning, its probably going to be very awkward for you when they tell you to drop your pants and underwear and lay down.. I had a 40 year old man with a beard do mine and it was just really weird having him less than a foot away from my cooter lol.. But its no big deal, just go for it! Im sure youll love it|`|9e0b3eb053495521ed772cef2058be0faa	How much you weigh shouldn't affect it too much, but your anatomy may not be suited for the piercing. Some women aren't - skinny and voluptuous.    The only way to know for sure is to have a consult with your piercer. If you can't do a VCH, many women are able to do a HCH.|`|zjBACeW3aa	Honestly, that piercing is unattractive on any girl.|`|GSbz9Zq4aa	Vch piercing????|`|5ZKqU2sIaa	what is VCH and why would you pierce it? LOL!|`|gQ63jsihaa	I don't think weight is a factor really when considering a piercing, it really just depends on the anatomy of the person. I got mine done about six months ago though it was a bit awkward for me because my piercer was really unprofessional. So the only thing I would be worried about would be finding a good facility to get it done. They're pretty easy to heal so you shouldn't have any trouble with healing afterward if your anatomy allows it.
CruxCjIraa	kinda snug but not wear they are leaving lines on your legs|`|dsnHhL4zaa	i'm assuming your a guy. where boxers it's less gay|`|oHO0XOQVaa	Snug as in touching your skin but not so tight that it leaves a mark on your legs.|`|AkGM8Weeaa	yeah you basically p oop in them like pull ups|`|1jlEwpu3aa	they should fit tight on the legs, and sorta around the crotch but as the day goes on they loosen up.

AhulHZ2daa	I am a makeup artist.    First off, unless the Olay moisturizer you are using is made for your face, then I wouldn't use it. Only use a moisturizer that is made for the sensitive skin of your face, making sure to pick one for your skin type: dry, oily, combo. I use Elizabeth Arden's Velva Moisture Film, it's about $8 at T.J.Maxx, and its a light moisturizer made for combination skin. If you have dry skin, use a rich moisturizer that is oil-free. Here are some good ones to try:  Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturizer Lotion ($24) -  http://sephora.com/browse/product.jhtml?...  or Sephora Brand FACE Moisturizer ($18) -  http://sephora.com/browse/product.jhtml?...  Also, make sure you are taking care of your skin and washing with a gentle foaming face wash made for dry skin.    Try using a primer. Rimmel makes a very cheap primer, and it's available at drug stores. Smashbox makes some of the best primers out there, but they come with a hefty $30+ price tag. Primers act as a barrier for your skin, they even out texture and fill in any holes. It will also help seal out the foundation, so it doesn't absorb into your skin and make your skin dry.    Your foundation seems to be the culprit of your problems! If you are using a powder foundation, I would throw it into a "summer" pile, and only break it out for when it's super hot outside and you need light, dry coverage to combat oilies and sweat. Dry skin needs a liquid or creme foundation, preferably one that contains moisturizing agents which is geared for people with dry skin. Here are some liquid foundations to try:  Cover Girl Advanced Radiance ($14):  http://www.covergirl.com/products/produc...  Sephora Brand Hydrating & Smoothing Foundation ($20):  http://sephora.com/browse/product.jhtml?...  Maybelline Pure Makeup ($5):  http://www.maybelline.com/Product/Face/F...  ...and here are some creme ones:  Covergirl Aquasmooth ($9):  http://www.covergirl.com/products/produc...  Mac Moistureblend ($29):  http://www.maccosmetics.com/product/spp....    If you find that even moisturizing foundations are making you dry, add some moisturizer to your foundation. Scoop out a little bit of liquid foundation on your hand, squeeze a few dots of moisturizer on top, and mix it with your foundation brush then apply immediately.    Hope this Helps! :)|`|D1AFV4ZXaa	that weird it should make it less dry|`|VOAyAhsSaa	It's your fonudation.  The olay moisturizers, while wonderful, have many risks.  You shouldn't be using them together.  If this is mkaing your face dry, then the problem is obvious:  Foundation is hard to keep on without it showing, so you need as little amount of barriers. Look at instructions, and it'll probably tell you to wash your face first. oils in your face, make-up, moisturizers, etc. make sure to change that.  Until a change is apparent, start steaming your face with a hot towel every night to moisturize. :)|`|gUUtGcbBaa	make sure you wash your face before you put on fundation and most importantly make sure your face is well rinsed because sometimes is the soap that makes your skin dries most pple forget that, but yea  make sure to rinse your face pretty well and then use the fundation.

Don't use a conditioner unless it's a very light one and/or your hair really needs it.   You are basically going to make 5 twists. One at the top front (centrally)and then two on each side, one above the other.   Make the top front one first. Divide the hair with a central parting. Then section off from the parting down to the ear on each side. Put those two sections together to make one front section. Tie back the rest of your hair into a rear ponytail - it will make it easier to create your first twist.   The twisting technique is rather like making a bun, except this is a very long, skinny one. Keep twisting your hair over and over very tightly until it eventually bends on itself. Then, continue twisting and winding the section of hair around itself, back towards your head. Secure it in the same way you do a bun, with a mini-scrunchie around the base.   You'll end up with a twisty, coil-like protrusion sticking out of the top of your head!   Now take out the back ponytail, divide your hair into two (vertically down the back of your head) and put one side into a bunch to keep it out of the way.   Divide the other side into two by drawing a line with your comb from your ear across your head horizontally to meet the vertical parting you've just made. Twist each section of hair as described above.   Take out the bunch on the other side, divide and twist as in previous step.   Now you should have five funny-looking twists sticking out of your head. Beleive me, it's worth it.   Leave for at least 6 hours or preferably over night.   In the morning take out the twists one by one, starting with the lower ones. Remove the band, untwist it a little and comb out your curls with a wide toothed comb.   When all twists are out, bend over and give it another careful comb (not too much). Spray with a strong hairspray. Flip your hair up and part it/arrange it. Then give it another good spray, lifting sections to really get a hold and volume.   At this stage it may look VERY big. This is good, it will settle and look great all day.     Use a fixing spritz as you twist or put mousse in your hair when you dry it to help fix the curl better.   Make sure your hair is absolutely dry before you start twisting. Your efforts will be wasted if your hair is at all damp.   Try to get each section the same thickness. This takes practise. Don't worry if they are different, it actually makes less difference than you might think.   When "wearing" your curls, avoid at all costs your enemies; rain, and even worse any form of dampness in the air. No saunas, steam rooms and if it's a foggy or very humid day, forget it.   Always carry a "quick-fix" remedy in case any of the above occur, such as a hair tie/clasp or spray and comb to back-comb it back to life.     The tightness can be uncomfortable and can also cause hair breakage. You can loosen the twist at the base a little to stop this. Just support your roots by pressing down on them, then gently pull and move the twist around until it all feels looser.         x0x0_LEi|`|04rQEJQfaa	i don't completely understand what your trying to say, because normally hair curlers don't make your hair dry, unless there the heated ones. But they have this new John Freida Frizz-Eazz line that has these two products: there's Straight answer and dream curls. My hair is naturally like huge and frizzy. When I use the Straight Answer one and squirt it into wet hair then blow dry it with my blow dryer with the thinner end on my hair is completely Straight! The Dream Curls is amazing!! I use it like every day, even if i want to straighten my hair, because it makes my big hair easier to work with. It just make your hair have completely perfect curls, its amazing. I just spray some all over my hair well its damp, and then either blow dry it on a extremely low heat and low power with a diffuser, or i just scrunch it with my hand (witch seems to work better) I totally recommend the dream curls spray if you want your hair to be like perfectly curly.|`|jWtp4Vwtaa	Have a shower at night and then sleep with your hair in a  messy bun.

They are so typical and overdone. You want to leave an impression on them that you're not just another girl.     Don't throw yourself out there, give them a little mystery. I think nice dark wash boot-cut jeans (they are flattering to everyone), a fitted v-neck top (there's a difference between fitted and tight. Don't over do it), a track jacket, and a pair of statement chucks or vans would look incredibly sexy, but not in a whore-ish way.     Remember, it's a basketball game, not a party or a beauty pageant. You want to look casual, approachable, and dressed appropriately. His friends will think that you're comfortable with what you have on, and it'll be easier for them to say, "Hey, the guys and I are watching Scrubs tonight, you can come if you want to" and not like, "Hey, sorry but we're going to go shoot some hoops tonight. We don't think you should come. You might break your heel or something."    Oh! Wear light make-up so they can see the real you and keep your hair off of your face. It'll look like you're totally confident, not like you have something to hide. And of course, always smile!|`|luEYdZ53aa	oh my gosh! tommarow im going to my bf's basketball game and meeting his friends like exact same situation!!!!!!!  ok so im wearing my Lucky Brand jeans and this one pink ed hardy tank that i just got with vans. when i was picking out my outfit i was trying to think casual....anyway good luck!|`|Et0IeGJ4aa	I would go for sneakers, light wash straight leg jeans that fit really well, a tank top with a half zipped up hoodie, and put your hair down.|`|AA11123061	be casual . be urself .     jeans a tee shirt and simple boots would be okay for a basketball game .|`|deLa3ldTaa	Skinny Jeans   with a cute top like something with designs on it maybe.   and some flats or converse.

Place a number of spoons in the freezer for about 30 minutes to an hour to allow it to absorb the cold. Use the backside of the spoon and place directly on the eyebags and dark circles for 2 minutes. Make use of the various angles of the spoon until the coolness is completely transferred on your face.   Another alternative would be to place ice cubes in a small basin of water until the temperature drops to freezing. Take a small towel then dip and wring completely in the ice cold water before directly placing over the eyes covering the problem areas. Repeat the process one or two more times.   Basic facial washing also improves overall condition. Wash your face immediately upon waking up using mild soap and cool water. Massage and soothe eyebags and dark circles carefully then rinse thoroughly.   sliced potato or cucumber over each eye for about 30 minutes. Chamomile, dill or rosemary compresses are effective alternative treatments as well.   Healthy eating habits and a sound exercise routine will keep your skin healthy and prevent formation of eyebags.  Eyebags may also develop through fluid retention so it may help to keep your head elevated during sleep and avoiding too much salt and fluids before bedtime.   Individuals should limit exposure to UV rays and sitting in front of the television or computer for too long. Smoking should also be reduced or stopped entirely since it can cause blood vessels to constrict limiting oxygen and blood supply to tissues.   Choice of food is another factor to consider since spicy foods are known to excite the nervous system. Focus more on healthy and natural food options rich in essential vitamins and minerals.     xoxo_LEi|`|652f1ace7d0e4554d654822f229e8c9daa	Try not to get more than 8 hours of sleep a day. Make sure you are eating properly and not stressing. Try placing cucumber under the eye for 10-15 mins. You can also get cream at drug store you can use..but takes 1-2 weeks before you notice a change in colour. For fast result use some cover up, that usually takes care of it .

Anyone who says you have a joker smile has got to be out of his/her mind. If you absolutely want to change something, I'd suggest the eyeliner.

I love your eyes, and I see why you want to accent them. Just a thinner line on top will do the trick =)|`|hOVzviFIaa	It is very black and very heavy. You may think it looks good, but it doesn't.

I have really dark stretch marks from having my son, I wish mine looked that light, but isn't it an expensive process to have the stretch marks faded by laser? =(
mFhMX9qRaa	no thats not much at all.  maybe if you want to you could go easier on the eye makeup (even though you dont wear that much)  you could use a skin tone eyeshadow all over the lid then apply the brown shadow in the outer corner of the eye a little.    i think you should show him this and show him how other people dont think that you wear that much makeup. it will also prove to him that you care what he thinks about you and that you take things into consideration even if you dont agree with him.|`|3uCRmoosaa	only foundation or powder can be too much if you cake it on. Test: About 20 min after you put on your make up rub your cheek with a tissue, if it still has ALOT on the tissue then you wear too much makeup!|`|VOAyAhsSaa	It is to someone who loves you.. They want to see you, not the stuff covering you. It's like seeing a really hot guy at the beach.. wearing a sweater.|`|GIqACtxvaa	No not at all, maybe try a brown eyeliner.  Black can be intense.

The darkness would contrast beautifully with your pale skin, also causing your blue eyes to come out more. Also, it depends on what your comfortable with.

It will most likely look great, but if you hate it you can always have it undone, or died back! Goodluck!|`|ro3X9fs3aa	if u dont tan u might look a little washed out :S

9cBLKOe8aa	No, I don't do anything to my toe nails but trim them in the winter. No one sees my toes and it gives me nails a chance to breath.|`|oOZyl5BNaa	no! in the winter i do them myself to save money.. but during the summer i go all out!|`|RTPVAyIyaa	No, but I paint them if I'm bored.    (:    There's no point. My feet are effed up anyway because when I was little my toe nail broke really bad and I had to but half of the nail off TWICE. It's all stupid now.    The other one's fine.|`|6ac013da2dceabac6383ebdee4f828c0aa	I get ingrown toenails so I have to have a professional pedicure every couple of months.  I do my feet myself in between though, and usually in the winter I don't bother with polish at all, unless I have a special occasion coming up.  This month, it's Valentine's Day and my 19th wedding anniversary, so I will be treating myself to a good pedicure in about 2 weeks.  :-)|`|Q8JeA1eNaa	Actually don't do pedicure cause your cuticles will much more grow up if you make pedicure them so you can buy a pusher cuticle.This better for your nails.|`|fMPyLqW4aa	No. I never get to show them off with flip flops or anything, so i just trim them and put a clear polish on there.

LaJn6jxJaa	I think that Nike's are better for wide feet and adidas are better for narrow feet.  They're both good quality in my opinion.|`|tpG1KBj4aa	nike b/c they can b for more then just soccor|`|llEdx8Q2aa	NIKE I like their styles better.|`|1sfYOZNbaa	nike has a much wider variety of types and styles|`|KXSwS1W0aa	Quality, adidas, for style nike, most people find adidas more comfortable, but nike has way more style.|`|04d20c09f63b884391e79aa5d60ecc94aa	i prefer nike as they have more styles but its your choice as it depends so what you like|`|SbIkiNd6aa	i think nike b/c they have more styles and lots of different colors.|`|DHjD4DW8aa	NIKE THEY HAVE WAY MORE STYLES|`|oWTXPtxwaa	It depends on what type of shoe you want, and for what.  Personally I would go for Nike, I like their shoes, and their recognized as athletic ((:|`|WEhtWnl2aa	I PREFER NIKE THEY ARE WIDER AND HAVE MORE INNER COMFORT AND SUPPORT.|`|CaEVHO32aa	nike|`|JRpD7Yu5aa	Depend whether you  would prefer shoes made by eight year old Koreans or eight year old Chinese.|`|QE06hxMGaa	Nike i find them more comfortable and i like the styles of some of them addias not so muchh|`|ifYOXajoaa	Nike, Because they are more comfortable, more verities     but I also like   Addidas they are cute. SOMETIMES!!    But i prefer Nikes they are way better!!!!|`|XMxf8BGSaa	Nike has style and thats all. SO if all you are going for is style then nike is fine. All nike is, is a marketing scheme! If you want quality then go for asics or mizzuno! Those are gonna be your best athletic shoes. Addidas is just another style brand as well. Maybe use them for basketball and thats all. same with nike!|`|EiWcberlaa	i actually like both, but id preffer nike's,  b/c they have better styles and the old school ones are legit,.|`|z4vyul5Kaa	I like Nike Dunks cause u can always find different colors  and styles and i feel they look better|`|n7FLnEQfaa	From my experience, nike...  To myself, they are more reliable and you can wear them for years..which covers for the extra price on shox :D  Good Luck|`|1493ba4d2afccb99fa48986b490234c0aa	I like them both they are my fave brands i would chose in the shop depending on style colour and price|`|omnFMR42aa	NIKES ARE WAY BETTER THEY LAST WAY LONGER THAN ADDIAS|`|AA10960806	I wear Adidas shoes as street shoes because they are comfortable and durable.    I wear Nike shoes for tennis because they are light.    Overall, I like Adidas better, but I'd wear either one for any type of shoe.|`|KA4aCu9Baa	I would have to say adidas, not only do they look cooler and cost less, they are way way more comfortable|`|QKwr4rkmaa	nike they have alot of styles and are very cute and athletic if your in a sport or like to jog.But they are not good if you have foot problems....|`|493lDnceaa	I say Nike because I have never had any kind of problems with them, but with Adidas my old pair started to fall apart and rub huge sore spots on my feet.
nRIsTdfIaa	Cold water "dries" the polish just to the touch... it's not completely dried and hardened, so it can still get funny finger-print ridges in it, but it won't smear onto clothes, etc.    Yes, the white used for French Manicure tips will work fine as a basecoat. Or you can try going to a beauty supply store (Sally's Beauty?). They often have a broader variety.|`|9dr0BZIbaa	Always make sure to put on a base coat to prevent staining the nails and to help the colour stay on.  This can be found in white, but clear coats are also available.  Ice water does help, but not completely.  Generally, nail polish takes 30 minutes to dry.  I suggest waiting the whole time before putting on a top coat, which seals the colour in.|`|4lqwMnhJaa	dipping your hands in cold water only makes it dry to the touch so you still have to be careful.    also, just get regular white nail polish for the base.|`|cObd7Mdqaa	humm idk..but if that worked..that would be awesome!      just bye regular white polish!|`|WEhtWnl2aa	i do this! dry to the touch you still need to be careful. but makes it faster.
493lDnceaa	Yes you can use as a mask. By the way, I use this stuff myself, and find it works great!
AA12048299	Also depends upon the type of foundation you're using. I found a powdered foundation like Bare Minerals worked much better than a creme for me. They have a great bronzer called 'warmth' that adds a nice amount of natural looking color. Plus it doesn't feel as if you're wearing a sticky mask.    I would suggest you go to a professional makeup artist, but most salons don't have truly educated make up artists, just an aesthetician who dabbles in make up. Best for you to use trial and error at home.     One more thing: check your make up in different lighting. For example, something that looks great at home in the bathroom will look positively invisble at night. And a too-heavy hand will really look gawdy in sunlight..|`|X8n4Qnkeaa	hmm is your foundation too light??    also BLUSH can be a girls best friend!! for a natural rosy look    :))|`|9dr0BZIbaa	Be sure to first have a healthy beauty regimen, which always makes you look great.  Wash your face every night with standard soap and toner, and cleanse your skin every few days.  When choosing the foundation, make sure to hold it up to your neck to find your prefect match.  To prepare for your transition of seasons, get one at your current skin tone and one darker, so that you can mix them when your skin colour is changing.  I also suggest adding a touch of highlighter to your foundation for an overall glow.  Also be sure to find a good concealer.  Get one that is one or two shades lighter than your skin tone, to make up for darkness in some areas (ex. under the eyes).  If you wish, you can dust some bronzer for a sun-kissed look.|`|SENut7Oeaa	try using a powder with a small amount of shimmer to it or i use morning grown lotion it makes my skin really soft and bright !!!|`|4u0U5YJyaa	Well that's unfortunate, mine makes me look gorgeous!|`|pWArTam4aa	Sun-kissed Look    Creating that 'just back from vacation' look is simple - even when the sun has gone down.    ~Break the foundation-first rule and start by applying concealer to any obvious blemishes.    ~Apply a little tinted moisturizer all over your face to give it a light sheen.    ~Take a tawny-brown or browny-pink and apply this very lightly to the apples of your cheeks, the tip of your nose, the tip of your chin, and around your hairline.    ~Apply a shadow with a little shimmer in it to your eyelids.  Good colors include golds, bronzes, browns, and beiges.  Apply brown or black mascara.    ~If you're a blonde or a redhead, define your brows.  Color on the face can make them disappear, so brush them lightly in the same shade or one tone darker than their natural color.    ~Apply a shade of lipstick just one tone darker than your natural lip color.  Now, brush over this lightly with a little frosted lipstick, shimmery pale shadow, or lip gloss to create a light, sheeny look.    Good luck!

It is a really nice foundation powder! I love it. I use it everyday. They usually have a shop in the nearest mall or something but you can order it online too. I absolutly LOVE it!!

You could possibly be applying the wrong shade and stuff, since maybe they don't suit your skin.  Or they could all individually, but not together as a combo.  Go online and watch make up videos or research your skin type and what works for you.  xx
YEd9Q5KZaa	You could just use hand cream. Put some on your hand, use a kleenex and there you go.|`|XNMw2hpraa	Pond's Cold Cream works really well on remover pad and q-tips for eye makeup remover. I have sensitive skin and it doesn't bother me. It gets all make up off, even eyeliner and mascara.

Better than most makeup removers in fact. :)  -Vaseline  -Baby wipes  -any sort of moisturizing cream  -oil (such as olive oil)  Really, anything oil-based probably works.  Don't be afraid to try these things out.  Sunscreen even worked for me!  Just make sure to wash off the excess "product" with water when the makeup has come off. :)  Hope I helped!
AA11101361	Yes.  If you wash your face when you get home, don't wash it again in the evening.  Too much washing strips your skin of it's natural oils.  Your skin gets desperate for the moisture it needs and goes into overproduction of oil, causing acne.|`|Cu0fPcdnaa	your are washing your face to much I recommend to wash it just one time because if  you wash it more your skin would get dry and wrinkle more faster I only wash my face in 1 time and people think I look more younger than my age .|`|fMPyLqW4aa	I would recommend only washing it 2 times. In the morning, and when you take a shower.|`|Q6x1gSlKaa	i would say two washes is enough. not only will it make your face produce more oils in the absence of the oils that your washing away to frequently, it will make you skin really dry, regardless of if you use mosterizer or not and it wil make you break out and make your skin peel.    just skip one wash. i'd say either the one at 3 or 10|`|OSF2WMQeaa	yeah it could

e1434520b7d6b7db2b483084c9ad434aaa	Long layers work very well with curls. The layers will help with drying and untangling time, and the hair will also hang better. However, do not get short layers as they will stick up and look funny. Don't let them thin your hair with razors either or it will look ratty at the ends as they grow out. If you want to find a stylist who knows how to work with curly hair you can find ratings by region here: http://www.naturallycurly.com/curlsalons    If you want to run out and pick products up locally, I recommend trying the following products:  - Drugstore: L'oreal out of bed weightless texturizer (black tub, use under gel), LA Looks or Herbal essences gels, Suave naturals or vo5 conditioners, L'oreal vive pro hydra gloss or nutri gloss for curly hair, red Cream of Nature shampoo  - Organic/specialty store (like whole foods): Giovanni Direct Leave in condish, G conditioners, G tea tree shampoo, Aubrey Organics Honeysuckle Rose or White Camellia Conditioners, AO B-5 Design gel  - ULTA: Devacurl products, Biosilk rock hard gelee, MOP-c curl defining cream (They also carry drugstore products and giovanni.)    These are all good things I have used, but be sure to tinker around with amounts and how you use any products. For hair type specific products check out these forums:  http://www.naturallycurly.com/curltalk/  There you can find others with the same hair type and try out some of their favorite products. However, the most popular ones are usually only available online.    Here are some basic tips for curly hair that you might find helpful:  *Don't shampoo every day.  *Comb conditioner through hair in the shower.  *Apply styling products to dripping wet hair. Scrunch or twirl hair to achieve desired shape.  *Use styling products suited for your hair type. Dont know yours? http://www.naturallycurly.com/hair-types  *Avoid terrycloth towels on hair; use linen, paper towels, or t-shirts instead.  *Air dry or use a diffuser with your blowdryer.  *Don't touch (or brush!) your hair while its drying.  *Once completely dry scrunch out any crunchy texture.    Lastly, it has made my hair so much better since I started the curly girl method! I used to almost never wear it down (it was a frizz/poof ball), but now I have pretty, shiny curls. ~:) Its pretty radicalno sulfates (shampoo) or siliconesbut its so great for curly hair. Give it a shot and check it out:  http://www.wikihow.com/Follow-the-Curly-...  http://www.ylcf.org/gotcurl/ (outdated product recs!)

Looks great and u will smell like a man's workplace.|`|1KVnuc7vaa	I have the same problem, but I'm 13.    I went to the stylist, she gave me anti frizz and mousse stuff to put on after you wash your hair. Don't get it too short, but what I did was get a nice noticeable side part with straight, nose length bangs that curve a little. then I got my hair about shoulder length, and then you put it in a cute half pony tail and voila! you'll look great!|`|bJ0rUlqdaa	i had the same problem i grew up my entire life with frizzy hair.i have now relaxed it with an oil relaxer it dries your hair out a little but after a few weeks its back to being soft it helps alot.and i would reccomend "infusium frizzease" apply it before you put any other products in your hair i have been using it for two years now and it works miracles..oh and take gel rub it in ur hands and run it through then take hair spray and scrunch your hair it makes the curls less frizzy=] and as for hair cuts DONT thin it out unless your ready to go to the salon EVERY 3 to 6 weeks to get it done again otherwise itll just look like an afro!haha|`|idhcqr5Daa	Condition your hair, massaging your scalp to get rid of build-up and excess oil. Shampoo your hair every other day, or best; only two days in a week. (shampooing every day dries out your hair)Once a week is best if you can. If you want to wash everyday, invest in a good conditioner.   Comb hair in shower while conditioner is still in. Never towel dry hair. Instead, air dry or diffuse.   Pour a dollop of liquid straightening serum and a smaller dollop of glossing serum into your hand and mix them together.   Apply the straightening-glossing serum mixture to sections of your hair. Twist each section around your fingers, hold for a few seconds, then release. Do this all over your head.   Turn your head down. Dry your hair with a blow-dryer with a diffuser attachment until your hair is completely dry.   Spray hair lightly with an anti-frizz spray.   Or... You can be sure to condition your hair thoroughly in the shower, combing through it with your fingers (not a comb). When you get out of the shower, put some leave-in conditioner or curl cream in it, followed by gel (don't worry, your hair will absorb a lot and prevent frizz--it won't get crusty unless you overload on the gel). Let air dry.   Diffusers have prongs to lift the hair as it is dried. If you want volume at the roots, buy a diffuser with the longest prongs you can find. These are most easily found at salons or beauty supply stores.   When blow-drying with a diffuser, gather large sections of hair into the cup of the diffuser and hold close to your head.   For extra volume at the roots, move the blow-dryer in a small circular motion while hair is cupped in the diffuser at the scalp.   Save money by using a straightening serum, which works wonderfully for blow-drying hair into ringlets or creating a straight style.   If you want to do something different (and you can stand to part with your long hair) consider this style: have long bangs, but cut the rest of your hair really short (like only an inch or two long). The really short part is too short to curl, and you can straighten your bangs if you want. If your hair is more wavy than curly, your bangs might look fine as is, though. This haircut is also really easy to wash and takes no time at all to style.   Only wash your hair once a day, every other day or every 2 days. That may sound gross to you, but as long as you take a shower and clean your body and put conditioner in it, it will look good and not be greasy.   Some good products are Pantene Pro-V for curly hair, Sun Silk for curly hair, John Frieda frizz ease for curly hair and Garnier curl and shine. Herbal Essences also has a new line for curly hair that works wonders!   Thick and wavy hair requires different care than straight. If you aren't willing to work with it, consider cutting it shorter. Keep in mind that shorter hair won't weigh itself down & may look "poofy" if cut too short.   Don't blow dry too closely to your head or frizz may occur!   Try a method that NaturallyCurly.com calls "plopping." Comb your hair in the shower, use your favorite product to scrunch your hair (make sure you REALLY scrunch all the way around). Lay a t-shirt flat on a chair, with the neck hole closest to you. Pile (or plop!) your hair on top of your head and lean upside down over the t-shirt. Fold the widest part of the t-shirt (not the neck) over your head/hair and secure it in place by tieing the sleaves together. Let your hair dry, or almost dry, plopped up on your head and your curls will be amazing!!   Don't brush your hair after it is dry, or you you will get really poofy bad hair that isn't straight, curly or wavy!   It is possible to burn yourself with a diffuser, so hold it an inch or two away from your scalp.   Do not get the spray in your eyes!         x0x0_LEi

Also professional eylash extentions.|`|PbykKE2oaa	You should go to a doctor.  My aunt had the same problem..she used to curl her eyelashes every day and at the end of the day they would just come down again.. Her eyelashes also grew straight down.   She thought it was just a cosmetic problem, but its actually an eye infection. You should go get it checked out before it turns into something much more seriously.
ZIq2IzOmaa	You may be overcleaning for your skin. If you are washing the area more than twice a day with soap, you are cleaning too much. Try cutting back to once a day at most. You can clean at other points durring the day with sea salt soaks if needed.     If you're not getting dry skin from cleaning, you may be having a reaction to your jewelry. Allergic reactions to nickel or other materials can produce red, burning, flaky skin. There is some nickel in regular 316L Surgical Steel so it is possible to have an allergy to it.     If reducing your cleaning doesn't improve the problem in a day or two OR you don't think that's the problem then it is time to visit your piercer. They should be able to ask you personalized questions to sort out the most likely cause and solution for your piercing.|`|MxdOSmKUaa	How many times are you cleaning it a day? You only clean it once in the morning, and once at night. Don't touch it without your hands being clean, and leave it alone.|`|8a2a91d64a774b8e3294c2cc6998db32aa	When you get a piercing, doesn't matter what kind, your are never to clean it with soap!!!! Some people even try to clean it with alcohol but that is also a bad idea because the alcohol kills the good bacteria that is suppose to heal your piercing, same goes for soap. Get Saline solution, it's super cheap, should be no more than three bucks and that will clean your piercing properly. Stop cleaning it with water and soap. Also, a certified piercer would tell you not to let your piercing come into a lot of contact with water anyway.|`|zYdi5UeIaa	how many time you clean it a day? well you schould clean it 3 to 4 times a day moring night afternoon|`|9e0b3eb053495521ed772cef2058be0faa	Stop using the soap. It dries out your piercing and the skin around it. It will also prolong the healing process.    Use only warm sea salt soaks. Mix 1/4 tsp sea salt with 8 oz warm water and soak for 10 minutes, 2-3 times per day.    For more info:  http://www.shopperarticles.com/Piercing-...|`|TEyzimuYaa	Yes.

6fPfKfLVaa	JUST WAX!!!  I used to shave too until I realized that it was a waste of time & never left my legs smooth for very long.  Because you have been shaving for so long tho, your hair is going to be super thick & coarse.  Not to mention all the ingrown hair (that is why ur legs get prickly after waxing).  You will have to wax a couple of times before you see a difference.  And you have to let the hair grow out as long as possible.  (Depending on hair growth - at least 1 1/2 month). (*Hopefully, you're not married/dating coz this will be a real buzz kill for your hubby/bf.*)    :(    And as for sensitive skin, I think waxing is the best method anyway rather than putting all those chemicals on it/shaving it everyday.|`|Ks3QlWMiaa	dont shave your legs  but wax it my mommy waxes it for me and   its so much better than shaving  your leg hair wont go away   but it will grow back slower   if you want your hair to go away forever   get it laser :)

f3vbrZdfaa	Some factors cause dark circles around eyes, such as heredity, lack of sleep, bone structure, sun exposure, medication, nutrition, hormonal changes in women.     Combat dark eye circles:    1. Drink nearly 10 glasses of water everyday  2. Ensure that you get good rest and adequate sleep  3. Eat vegetables and fruits rich in vitamin A.  4. Consume a nutritionally balanced diet  5. Apply slices of raw potato or cucumber over the eyelids for about 15 minutes.  6. Use topical creams that have Vitamin K derivatives.  7.

And it actually worked. People (even strangers) used to always tell me that I looked so tired all the time, even when i felt wide awake.      Now I look just as wide-awake as I feel.      Just goes to show, that natural remedies such as simple nutrition, work better than makeup and expensive eye creams ever could.

I say long because I'm used to military haircuts. ;)|`|9RqmSgFKaa	It looks a little Dorothy Hamill'ish circa the 1976 Winter Olympics.|`|N1DPWpAsaa	Not At All , Your Cute .

hNfg7oXeaa	Usually not. Your skin may be irritated or dry for a while, especially if you're using harsher products than you're used to.  Just moisturize and remember to use your products often even though they may irritate. It'll get better!|`|aQ8utQOeaa	Yes that can happen.  I have experienced that before.  Only use a little bit of the products when you first start out so that you can let you skin build up a tolerance to.  Also, remember to use a good moisturizer.|`|Y3Mxrh2uaa	it is not always true.. but, if you old skin care routine was working for you, there is no reason you should have changed it. it may take your skin a while to get use to this new routine|`|AA12343006	I've never heard this. But it makes sense because your skin needs to get used to the new skin routine. And it may act up a little before it gets used to it, or if it even gets used to it at all.|`|48oRO9lPaa	I guess it is possible if you have never been exposed to certain chemicals, but I would imagine that it shouldn't.|`|IYLlupdkaa	sometimes the new ingredients can br irritating to the skin causing inflammation or the pores purge causing a breakout-|`|fYTcFygUaa	i think not|`|MxdOSmKUaa	Yes. New products - New routine. Anything you use on your skin gets worse before it gets better.|`|ZHf8mIitaa	Yeah, most of the time your skin will get slightly red and dried out at first.    If you have anything stronger than that happen though, see your doctor and stop using the product ASAP.|`|YFLfaeAOaa	Honestly I've never heard of that, the point of skin care routines are to rid your pores of whatever is inside of them. The fact also is that everyone's body will react differently to all types of products. Personally, I wouldn't want to do it, but if you have witnesses or people that have used this product and are happy with it, then go for it.|`|DLbracM5aa	Yes, using some products will cause your skin to purge [which is sometimes a good thing] and this really is just getting the gunk out of your pores and bringing them to the surface. Once the purging face is over, [ it lasts about a week ] your skin will just keep getting better.

zDh2Qw9eaa	Do make up like normal, only glamorize it. Pretty colors that stand out, rosy cheeks. Play the eyes up, heavy eyeliner and mascara. Bold eyeshadow colors.     Then...smear the eyes. Make the eyeliner smudge out, and mascara somewhat runny under the eyes. Make it look as if they have been crying and/or rubbing at their eyes. If you want more control, take a smudge brush and smear the eyeliner down, and rub a faint layer of mascara under the eyes...like if you had gone to bed with mascara on and forgot to wash your face. Give her a bit of dark under eye circles.     Put on very red lipstick. Smear it out a bit as well. Just a bit to one side of the lips. Like she is rubbing at her lips without thinking. Make the tip of her nose rosy, as if she keeps blowing her nose.    What I would do, though, is keep the foundation on the rest of the face as perfect as possible. I would also keep the blush perfect as well, but a bold color. It would be a good contrast. One part of her is perfectly made up, the other part a disaster. I would also paint her nails a brilliant color, and then give them a more rugged look. As if she keeps biting them. Scrape a bit of paint off, like she has been picking at them.    That's just my idea, and the first thing that came to mind. I'm sure there are many great ideas! Sounds like a fun assignment.|`|fna0OfuCaa	Here are some sites that give you tips on how to make someone look beat up!    http://www.indymogul.com/backyard-fx/pos...    http://www.curbly.com/indymogul/posts/21...|`|VOAyAhsSaa	eye shadow under the eye.. black with a tint of blue to it. it'll be pretty.. and tired. make her foundation a little darker around the eyes and next to the lips. add small lines on the forehead in darker foundation, to create worry lines and stress creases. make the person stretch out their lips as far as they can, then take your own fingers, and stretch a part out. apply lipstick. do this to every part of the lip, to create tired, worn out lips. darken the ends of the eyelids, and add the tiniest hint of blush right underneath the nose. Then add mascara and blush in the usual places.. she'll look pretty.. pretty tired. :)|`|fYTcFygUaa	do good or as best you can then|`|H4pqDG09aa	you want to have very slight under eye circles. Paler than usual makeup. Maybe eye make up that is slightly...very slightly smudged. Her make up should be pretty, but look like she is too frazzled to do it like it should normally be. Make the makeup just a little "off"|`|0i8XxXG9aa	You need to get your complexion looking good, so use a good, but very natural looking foundation. Try blues, purples and pink-reds under your eyes to look like you're tired (sparingly of course) Leave lipstick off, or use a colour too pale for your complexion, and make it look like ou aren't wearing any.     -Even though you didnt mention hair, make sure it's in good condition, and then put it in a pony tail, a bti messy.     break a leg!

midmBgJJaa	The idea put forth by misogynists to justify their control is to claim they are "protecting" women and the female sex by insuring they won't be sexually targeted by other males. That way such control mechanisms appeal to women raised in the culture. Instead of a woman seeing herself as oppressed and unable to dress as she chooses without a goon from the religious police taking issue, she is raised to see the burqa as a sign of "modesty," "goodness," and sexual purity.    Examples:    The Burqa - Some Muslim men claim women should cover up their faces, bodies, and hair in loose clothing so men will not take advantage of them them and women can preserve their sexual chastity. "Protection from immorality" is another reason Saudi men cite why Saudi women can't drive and have to wear full black tarps in the middle of the f'ing desert.    Reality - Women are forced to wear tarp to stop them from being recognizable fully participating members of society and controlling their own sexuality. One woman in a burqa is not distinguishable from another. The misogynists' argument implies that men can't stop themselves from raping women and that their behavior (the rape) is dependent on how women dress, not what men choose.    Burqas - supported by misogynists and the supremely gullible apologists of radical Islam.    Foot binding is similarly misogynistic but different. It sprang up among courtesans and spread to wives as a status symbol, appealing to both vanity and a strange sexual image that men had of women unable to walk without help, dangling helplessly with feet that did not work. Modern parallels could be considered similar to the more extreme practices of Victorian waist training.    The bound foot:    http://library.thinkquest.org/J0111742/b...    Extreme wasp waist corsets:  http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/co...      Burqa:  http://www.spiegel.de/img/0,1020,766784,...    Try being recognized as an individual human when one "tarp" is indistinguishable from the next.|`|ojj5XKyBaa	No, not completely. But I guess if we (over?)simplify everything, yes, they're similar.    The bound feet of Chinese women catered to an emperor's whim and subjective aesthetic criteria. Ultimately it was a matter of power -- stemming from the decree of a patriarch and being passed on and established as a tradition. I believe this is more about vanity, yes. Whether it's about the vanity of women who espouse the standard of beauty established by a man, or it's more about the male gaze is debatable. I reckon both are in play.    Wearing the burqa and the hijab is more complicated. It's less about vanity than it is about following tradition and scriptures.   I once was shown a defense of this practice, written by a Muslim woman (I'll try to find it, I hope it's available because it presents a very different perspective and it's a interesting view which should be included in the discourse). The author of the piece stated that by wearing the  burqa and the hijab, a woman ceases to be defined in terms of the flesh. Thus, she may be known more for her mind and her heart. If I remember correctly, standards of modesty were also raised.    Certainly, in the eyes of other cultures, wearing such garments is oppressive and restricts individual freedom. However, opinions may vary among Muslim women themselves. As mentioned by one female Muslim contributor, wearing the garments is actually meant to protect women.    Other people can argue that those who actually approve of this practice may not be enlightened or worse, may have been brainwashed but ultimately it's their choice to feel what they feel about it. (We should be careful when we try to impose our own cultural standards on others.)    What I find oppressive perhaps is that women can't choose, then can't say no to wearing the garments when they do disapprove (of the practice).    Is it about male vanity? Perhaps in the sense that in some parts of the world, men still believe that women are objects to be owned and thus must follow their bidding. When that's the situation, dehumanization looms. But if it's just a matter of wholeheartedly following one's faith and tradition, it ceases to be about vanity, doesn't it?|`|wNwVSGzbaa	I can't speak for the binding of feet of Chinese women, but being a muslim I know that the burqa and hijab are not meant to limit a woman's liberty, but instead protect her.. I could go on and on but look for information on it yourself :-) btw, i dont think they spring from similar attitudes to women...I think Chinese women have their feet bound due to cultural preferences or whatever but the hijab is related to religious reasons   Take care :)|`|qQqC2cHIaa	Yes, they are all ways that men try to subjugate and control women. All restrict freedom of movement, freedom of expression, and freedom of choice.  Anything that restricts women in such extreme ways should be outlawed. Especially because there are no such  horrendous restrictions on men in these cultures.  And religion shouldn't be used as an excuse to restrict and prohibit a woman basic right to freedom of movement, expression and choice.|`|8e8f00fc5b9e9edb3247392086ec523faa	don't worry, be happy
O7KR3tgjaa	It depends on the makeup. If the foundation/concealer that you use is more oil-based, then it will make your pimple more red and often times make the white pus to actually show. Matte foundation is usually the worst. But some formulas actually dry up pimples and help them heal.     In your case, if you plan to use it occassionally, then it wouldn't be a problem. It's best if you use acne medication/gel and let it dry before you apply makeup. This way, the gel will help you clear out the pimple while the makeup covers up the reddened area.|`|eal4vU6Taa	no  but sometimes it can irritate your skin  it depends on what type of skin u have|`|A2fFu60gaa	yes!if u use it a lot

Way more comfortable. And pajamas are really cute IMO. It doesn't look like you're trying too hard to be sexy.
kclpa0Abaa	Most people, men & women, would say it is unattractive and tacky, or it is a cry out for attention generally.    In your case, not SO much that, because it's only two and it wouldn't show down the street. But bitches are bitches and bitches will hate occasionally.    I personally love' em and see nothing unfit, but that's me.    17 year old.|`|9e0b3eb053495521ed772cef2058be0faa	I think they look great as long as they are original and well done.

I have two music notes on my ear. No one has ever called it trashy. A lot of people have actually called it "cute".    If it's on your back, not very many people will see it (unless you run around topless), so not many people can form an opinion on it.    Besides, tattoos and piercings are becoming more and more common-place these days, so chances are low that anyone would think any less of you for the tattoo.    My suggestion, though, would to be to get a tattoo of something that actually means something to you, not something you just think is pretty.|`|YXXvhDLWaa	I'd rather see a girl with some big custom pieces than all those little "cute" tattoos. I'm a 36 year old female and I've already got two half sleeves, a butterfly on my back bigger than my hand and a small scorpion.

I have a tattoo of a flower on my back on the right side.  I want one more tattoo, but I am not sure of what yet.  I am like you...I don't like anything creepy or weird.  I like classy stuff.  I think that if you have one or two and are not too big or weird, that's fine.    I even asked my fiance just now who is sitting next to me what does he think about tattoos on a girl...His answer was SEXY...Specially on your back...Its HOT.|`|HcLQD1Hbaa	Im 15, i hate seeing girls with sleeves or whatever, or where like a whole limb is covered. if u dont go to crazy you'll be fine. remember though, there permanent so don't regret whatever you're getting|`|6SxVuHjNaa	I kinda think it`s hot but not everywhere I`m 18 years old|`|VOIqmXQCaa	i am a 19-year old female with very obvious tattoos (one behind my ear trailing to my neck and large matching pieces on my collar bones/chest...and a sleeve in process) and think that tattoos are sexy on women, just as long as they're not pointless, tasteless, or poorly done.    if you're going to get a tattoo, get something that you know you will want forever. think it through, give it time. don't do it on a whim or do something cliche'.  make sure you go to a good shop and get it done by an artist with a good reputation. ask your friends with tattoos that you like who did their work, or ask people you see on the street who have tattoos you like who did their work (if you're embarrassed, don't be! people like to hear that you like their tattoos too).    of course, there are negative things that come with tattoos as well. i've overheard small children ask their parents why i was allowed to use markers on my skin but they werent, or people ask if my tattoos are real, or why would i do that to my body, and an assortment of other things from funny to flat-out rude.  there are ignorant people everywhere, you can't stop it. just learn to laugh about it. yes, i've overheard very horrible things muttered about me in public or heard old-fashioned people say its "trashy".. but i've also heard five times that many people say that they love them, they're very unique, and even that they should be photographed for a magazine.     if you get a tattoo, get something that you wear proudly, keep your nose up and ignore the haters.|`|9kWIAMsDaa	i have 2 different flower tattoos and one on my foot. i don't think they are ugly or make me look trashy. they add to my appearance i think and they are really pretty to me. and meaningful in different ways. just make sure its something you care about and wont regret later. and don't worry what ppl think about you as long as you love it thats all that matters|`|e207987deddf27dc04449727b6aaafc4aa	Love them!  Its your body, do with it what you like!  Im 48, may be an old man, but still loving the tats!|`|jBTBMzPpaa	I think it's hot.|`|2m65BPiPaa	Well I love tattoos. Let me say in my experience, tattoos are addicting. I got an aztec tribal on my lower back. It was suppose to be small but then I thought what the hell, you only live once so i got it big. Then a year passed then I got one on the top of my back which is a 3-D cross with barbed wire wrapped around it with the lettering Only God Can Judge Me on the bottom of the cross. Then I went to go get to Spurs symbols on the back of each ear and not once have I got a bad comment from none of them. From what I hear guys like girls with tattoos just because of the fact that they can take a lil pain here and there. If you feel like you want one go for it. It's your body, enjoy it girl.  I have pics of you want to see them. Just let me know.|`|RmqN9dR8aa	Tattoos on girls are hot and cute. I think they look interesting. Try to find your style and go for it. Try some dragon design - maybe a lion with a dragon or some fantasy.

gv0xVBN4aa	a cold spoon, twist an eraser on it, bleching cream. any of those might work. good luck.|`|Y3Mxrh2uaa	im sorry but i don't think there is anything you can do to make it go away faster.... lol you can say its a bruise or just cover it up with concealer|`|fn1sKCT0aa	Step 1 Apply a cold compress immediately (although that may interrupt a moment of passion). Keep the compress on 20 minutes, off 20 minutes. The cold will constrict blood vessels and help keep the bruise (which is the essence of a hickey) from spreading.     Step 2 If the hickey lasts for more than 48 hours, apply wet, warm compresses to decrease any pain or swelling. Once the blood has stopped spreading around the bruise, apply heat, which dilates blood vessels and thus speeds up the sweeping away of blood cells. In most cases, moist heat is more effective than dry heat, because the moisture helps wick the heat beneath the skin.     Step 3 Apply concealer in a shade that's lighter than your natural skin color and discreet enough to fend off unwanted attention. If you can cover or tone down a hickey, it serves the same purpose as getting rid of it.     Step 4 Remember that if all else fails, nothing beats a turtleneck sweater - or a scarf in summer.|`|a2gbqlqTaa	to be honest with you...there are no "real" ways to make it go away faster. i guess the best way is to kinda just avoid it. my girlfriend said that it was a bruise from soccer. i mean you could try to verbally cover it up, it doesnt take that long to go away. no worries.|`|6qthfGxeaa	haha i don't know anyway besides just hiding it with makeup|`|N66WhR54aa	ohh girll it takes time! just cover it up with make up and wait it out. i hate when that happens haha|`|ElBIeRFNaa	my friend used to take a comb & run the teeth over the hickey.  not too hard, though.|`|UHc3Nvaqaa	Avoid feasting your eyes on handsome gentlemen like myself to prevent further ones.|`|qhSH2WZUaa	Trust me this will work for sure!! Get a lipstick cap or a wide marker cap and put it on top of the hickey. Twist the hickey again and again, even if it hurts!! Do this for about two min. At first the hickey will apprear to look worse and all red but once your blood leaves the area your neck, or wherever the hickey is, will look back to normal! If it doesnt completely go away the first time then try it a second time!Good luck.|`|CjyiOOXCaa	yeah makeup and wearing scaves and turtle necks lol|`|rTZDMk5Daa	hold an ice cube on the spot for a few minutes.|`|aV0QmAOtaa	here's a few things you can do:  - hold an ice cube on the spot for a few minutes.  - cover it up with concealer/foundation/makeup,etc.  - wear your hair down.  - wear a scarf (it IS winter after all ;)  - uh yeah, good luck :)|`|SHdrYV0Naa	you can not get rid of it fully but you can speed up the time it is there  hickeys are broken blood vessels so try some ice if it has been with in a couple hours from when you got it, if not use toothpaste yea i know gross but it really does help, make up is the worse as it tries to cover it up but really makes it look so much worse
5sLnSIoTaa	maybe get rid of the lip ring? also lighten the eye makeup a little bit. and i definitely think you could pull off a front bang. and keep the same color, its grrrreat!|`|sP3UtfJ1aa	well shorter hair usually makes people look older, and it also depends how u do ur make-up too darker eyes but not like ur going to the club but like classy kinda smokey eye. you style of clothing always says alot about u      hope it helps|`|M9wAOlk3aa	well who cares what people say you look fine   make the most of looking young dont wish it away   most women wish they looked younger   maybe you have a young voice|`|90ZaNZE4aa	there is nothing you can do    I am 20 people say I look 16|`|2wOmBTPyaa	I think you look older than 18 so i don't know lol    (:|`|By1DJAUOaa	no you look 18 years to me!!!!!|`|5NsgLFPRaa	Act your age  Dress your age  Be your age|`|erblIkbDaa	The lip ring makes you juvinial.|`|zFKULGWfaa	WHY?

Dont change for others, im sure there are guys that like you. :)  Oh and by the way you're not ugly at all. :)  Also when you're talking to a girl try bringing up subjects that you think they would wanna talk about. Well, of course this is what i would do if i were in you're shoes...|`|4r0Cyih5aa	Girl ya pretty! Just put some makeup on and feel pretty!

Make yourself confident|`|iNyJm0Vbaa	its ok. we all go thru that phase one time or another.   the best way is to just talk to random people. i used to be soooo shy, but  now, everyone thinks im popular!    just talking about a hw assignment is a huge step. you can go on wikihow on how tos for getting over shyness, and anything you want to know!!!  good luck!|`|gv0xVBN4aa	just wear some make-up tht compliments your face. you are a very pretty girl, just dont put yourself out there, guys like a challenge.|`|syu81nRXaa	first of all, i saw your pictures and you are beautiful. you shouldn't have to rely on cleavage to feel pretty. if you are in middle school, i understand that that is what gets guys attention because they have pretty much never seen boobs before, but once you get to high school they start seeing that there is more to a girl than her bod.     second of all, the reason people may seem uninterested is because they don't know how to handle a shy girl. if you aren't making eye contact at first, they probably think YOU are the one thats not interested. Everyone is self-conscious and deals with this stuff, so you kind of have to tell yourself it's not YOU, it's everyone.    don't put yourself down. remember the great conversations or fun times you have rather than the failures with guys because that happens to everyone all the time girl.
idhcqr5Daa	Choose your shade.Choose a bronzer. Since the purpose of a bronzer is to darken the complexion subtly, the one you choose will depend on your skin tone as well as how dramatic a change you're looking for. Generally, it should be only a few shades darker than your real skin tone. Test a little on the clean skin of your face to make sure it "warms" your skin tone without making it look fake.   If you have fair skin, look for a honey-colored bronzer; for a medium complexion, choose a rose-bronze or gold flecked bronzer; dark skin is best enhanced with a tawny or amber bronzer.   Pinker bronzers tend to suit blondes, while more orange bronzers tend to look better on brunettes. See Warnings.      A large, soft brush works best.Choose a wide, fluffy powder brush with a rounded top. If it's too small and stiff, it will give blotchy results. If you are going to spend money on a brush, choose sable. Generally natural fibres are best.      Applying powder.Apply base powder. Since oil or moisture on the skin can cause bronzer to streak, apply a small amount of powder first as a base. Don't apply any foundation because it can make your bronzer look "muddy." If your skin is dry, apply a sheer moisturizer evenly before applying the base powder, or consider using cream, stick or liquid bronzers instead.      Swirling the brush in bronzer.Swirl the brush evenly in the bronzer. A little is all that's needed. To ensure an even application, tap off any excess bronzer. You can also rub the brush in to a clean tissue to get rid off any excess.      Applying bronzer.Apply bronzer to the areas of the face the sun would naturally hit. Using very light strokes, first apply the bronzer to the top of the forehead, working down the nose and along the cheeks. Build up the color gradually, so you get exactly the shade you want. You could also try applying a small amount to the chin.      Check the bronzer in daylight. Make sure it's not too heavy. Look for streaks. If too much bronzer is applied, blend the bronzer down evenly with a cotton pad or apply a little more base powder. If it still doesn't look right, you will have to take some off and start again.   Wash brushes regularly to keep them clean and in good condition. Make-up artists often wash their brushes in warm water with washing-up liquid and conditioner.   Bronzer should only be applied to parts of the face which the sun would darken in summer - like the forehead, nose, and top of the cheeks.      I knew she ate too many carrots!The most common mistake made with bronzers is choosing one that looks too orange on the skin, which in turn looks artificial.   Don't blow on the brush to remove excess bronzer -- if a little moisture reaches the brush, it can cause streaks.   Avoid coppery lipstick or eyeshadow when you're wearing bronzer, or else you'll look too metallic.     x0x0_LEi|`|gUUtGcbBaa	you put it on your face so it wont look all the same color, or too pale, but dont over use it because sometimes pple use it too much and you can see the difference between your nek and face and it looks bad, unless you use it on your nek too, but i use it a little bit when i look pale.|`|ebebFFgHaa	bronze is mostly for your cheeks. you use it to define your cheeks. you can also put it all over your face to even it out but not too much.(:
8IfePMa3aa	How about an interest or activity you shared?|`|WLuEIwp5aa	What's the first thing you think of when you think of your dad?  Get a few ideas together that really represent what kind of person your dad was and what kind of relationship you two had and take them to a tattoo artist.  You'll be able to work out a really original, memorable, beautiful tattoo that way.    I don't think anybody here can give you the imagery you really want, or the kind of ideas that will really resonate with you.    Good luck finding something that you'll really love, I'm sure you can find something great with a little thought.|`|Cp6ACouDaa	Get a Daddys Girl tattoo.........

kclpa0Abaa	It sure is. That's a deal. And tip 15%.|`|JafLyLYgaa	albeit maybe a little more pricey then most...    http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v242/m...    Thats my back tattoo. Took around 2 hours. I paid 250 and gave him a 50 dollar tip. Maybe that'll give you a good idea.. It sounds too cheap, and I would be very wary. Call up and ask them how much they generally charge an hour to see what they say. Maybe you can figure out whats goin on (whether they were just baiting you with a cheap price, to tell you it will cost more later, or if its just a cheap place that should be avoided.. or  sometihng else I havent thought of)    good luck|`|UYnZtJ2daa	Honestly, $150 sounds way too cheap to be doing a huge back piece. I don't think you're being ripped off...I think you're going to a place that is charging unbelievably cheap and should probably be avoided. Not even the least detailed completely black wing taking up your back should even be that cheap.    Most artists charge around $75-100 an hour...|`|Z5sKsrBFaa	A good tattoo is not cheap and a cheap tattoo is not good.|`|WLuEIwp5aa	$150 for 1.5-2 hours is cheap, if you ask me.    The shop I go to isn't super expensive, but it's still $150 an hour.  If the art is good and you like the artist, you pay whatever they ask.  The only way to get ripped off is to go to a crap artist (anybody charging less than $100 is probably not great, by the way) and pay anything for any tattoo.    Tip around 20% if you're satisfied with the work, and tip more if you really love it and have the money.|`|rnNn9Ervaa	That price is alarmingly cheap. For 11 hours of work, I would expect at least 500 dollars. Where are you getting it done? That sounds quite shady, I'd go somewhere that charges a little more. For one hour of work I paid 100 dollars (and got an amazing tattoo that I'm proud of). Tattoos are permanent, and it sounds like someone's going to screw yours up. Try another place.

PK0doXNiaa	My advice to you... piecings make you ugly    stop it!!!|`|YNssCMkfaa	you are very retarded and goth and punk and probably emo and probably have to different shades of hair but if you want another piercing. psssss.bribe your parents.....ohhhh that Genius. wait i know! sneak to the local westfield. wait for the girl that is as dumb as you are to come out and you get piercing without your parent knowing. until the end.|`|mFhMX9qRaa	this is what worked for me:    i told her that if she doesnt let me do it, i will do it at a friends house with a needle by myself and that is very risky cuz i could use a dirty needle and whatever and have high risk of infecting myself... so she might as well take you to a professional and get it done properly.  also ... tell her once you turn 18 your gonna get it done anyways. so why not get it done now right?|`|bNlL6PrZaa	how old are you? i had that problem, but i was 18. so it basically came down to "i'm legal & you cant stop me." lol but it's your body and you should be able to do as you please. i have a friend that went through the same thing and basically negoicated; she would get all good grades and could then get her tounge peirced. it worked!   and btw, peircings are beautiful and unique. =)|`|b695nXB4aa	i have my nose my tongue 4 holes on both ears my bottom lip three times and my eye brow used to be done tell your mom it is better than a tattoo you can take out a piercing a tattoo is their to stay so a piercing is not a big deal that worked for me with my first piercing also if you get one don't get your eye brow they rip out easy and leave a nasty scare good luck.
DNLJwLZqaa	Dudee, way overdoing the question marks.    Just wear the shoes. they shouldn't look bad with shorts.  and then wear jeans too. it's really not that hot in the summer.|`|IQZxdghGaa	DCs? Vans? umm you know...|`|pihAW3t4aa	maybe like spring colored skinny jeans. with Nikes. or just anything that has spring colors.|`|bazaPXRZaa	they wint look too bad w. the shorts, at least the nike's. u could just wear jean, it not toooo hot in the summer. at least where i live (California). so if u think it looks okay to wear ur shoes and shorts do that or just wear jeans or get new shoes.
uDy6zyJPaa	There's a shampoo and conditioner called In(Fusion) I think?  It helps thicken hair.  I've used it before.|`|H4f2dXVLaa	you make it thicker.|`|4SyINs07aa	hair extensions|`|uzPfCdiPaa	I have heard to take the vitamin Biotin|`|H6uYThgjaa	hair extension is really your only option. you should also get your hair cut to eliminate layers. that emphasizes on the fact that your hair is thin. i wish i had thicker hair too, but it's all about genetics.
caQuTMDmaa	well, your friend is probably just looking out for you and trying to be helpful when she says this. I mean, wouldn't you want her to tell you you have brocolli in your teeth than have her not and let you walk out with it still on for the whole world to see? Probably not.   But there are some tips you could use to take her advice to heart and improve on it.   For one thing, you can try minimizing the products you are using. Maybe lose the looose powder b/c it can give the effect of flakiness if you have bumpy skin.   Anotrher thing, do you have the correct shade of foundation? It jsut might be that the color of it doesnt quite match and that is wat makes it noticeable - go to a department store and ask for a professioanl consultation - if it doesnt work out, you can get a full refund on your purchase - unlike when you take a chance and buy irrefundable products from the drug store  -A third point to make is whether you are applying the makeup in a good lighting zone- the best location to do your make up is in natural light. So avoid doing you makeup in the presence of the bright incandescent light of your bathroom light bulb, and instead, go to your window, bring a mirror with you, and do your makeup there. The natural, "sun" light, helps you see your skin in "real" light, unlike the airbrushed effect you think youre acheiving in the falsehood of the unnatural looking lightbulb light.     -finally, sometimes makeup just does worse than it does any good. If you have a lot of redness in your acne, cover it up with foundation and concealer; if you have  LOT of acne, then only use foundation and skip the concealer - the concealer has a really thick consistency to it and will only DRAW attention to the area.  As well, skip concealer if you have acne that is BUMPY or protruding - you can only conceal redness, but you cant do anything about texture - which is sad - but thats proabbly the best option.       i totallyu understand what uyour going through and it sucks having bad skin and wondering whether ppl are lookign at you or at your makeup, so just skip the whole heavymakeup thing ..you'll realize that in the end, it will end up looking better and wil do better for you skin..and eventaully, you will grow out of it :)|`|Vhq3GURQaa	Think, Tammy Faye.  Yes, you can get fooled. Follow your friends advice and see if anyone else comments. We see our flaws  in much harsher light then anyone else does.  Go to a good stores make up counter. They will offer ideas and may even do a mini makeover.|`|aV0QmAOtaa	Maybe you're not evening out the makeup all over your face, so there's blotches or different kinds of shades all over your face. I would skip the concealer and go for the liquid foundation and loose powder, maybe? The best thing to do is sit at home and take time to do your makeup. Try adding less amounts of something or try to do it without concealer or without this or that. Then take pictures after you do each one and compare them.|`|xT8Sk426aa	Listen to your friend. She isn't trying to hurt you, just help you.|`|VN2wyTnFaa	It might be because you're focusing too much on the acne and not really stepping back to look at the whole picture. Make sure you're doing your makeup in direct sunlight so that everything is even, it helps out a lot.
p9MqWNWWaa	ugh  the wet to dry straightners are worse that a clothes iron.  when your hair is wet and then you put a straightning iron onto the wet hair it burns your hair.  in the end result if you do this more than you should your hair will end up breaking and you won't beable to repair it until it grows out.  honestly the ghd is the best straightner I have ever used and its worth the money.|`|90TZw6NFaa	It wont fry your hair off, but it doesn't make it flat & pretty like your trying to.

It's more or less an open wound/skin abrasion right now and it's healing.  Keep it clean, and Vaseline will help keep it moisturized.|`|WLuEIwp5aa	Wash it gently a few times a day and keep it moist with something like A&D cream.  Don't put vaseline on it, it can clog up your pores and irritate it even more, leaving you with faded spots all over.

I read somewhere that some tattoo ink (not all) reacts with something in neosporin.|`|9kWIAMsDaa	nooo don't use Vaseline it takes the ink out, i have friends that do tattoos and they either use a&d ointment found at any grocery or drug store or unscented lotion!|`|fwfT8t4Yaa	Call your local tattoo studio and tell them you got a shonky job done interstate and ask if they have lotion they recommend to customers.  then go out and buy the lotion and apply it, don't pick it don't scratch it, then get a blood test for Hepatitis, because backyard jobs are notorious for blood born diseases.|`|NYB6epe5aa	Vaseline helps|`|V38GVBAuaa	Use Vaseline and do not irritate it any more. You may look stupid, but try not to run your arm against your sides a lot as you walk. Avoid too much contact.|`|aBQjm481aa	Tiger balm works. Vaseline, ice,|`|MsBoH20Iaa	Keep it clean , gently wash it with soap and water twice a day and keep it out of direct sunlight. Apply a THIN layer of Neosporin twice a day, too much will draw out the color. If it scabs at all,  resist the temptation to pick at it. Keep it moist with vaseline in between the washings and neosporin.
I9hAPIA3aa	I started losing hair at 16, so I can relate.  The easiest and most simple thing you can do is cut your hair really short to make the bald spot less conspicuous.  Although you might think that growing really long hair will cover it up, it generally just makes it more obvious.  Your other options are long, hard, expensive, iffy, and of dubious lasting effect.  Those options would be Rogaine (which I use), surgery, wigs, etc.  Rogaine might stop you from losing more hair, but you'll be lucky if you actually grow anything back.  It's the most (and maybe only) legit product of its kind on the market right now (and yes, I've tried other products, too).    Hope that helps!  If not, just embrace it and think of all the celebrities such as Bruce Willis, Michael Jordan, Samuel Jackson, etc. who are bald and look fine.
e1434520b7d6b7db2b483084c9ad434aaa	Just try it. The ONLY other way to wear you hair would be curly. (Well I guess you could try updos, maybe pigtails?) Someone once told me, "Flat iron your hair perfectly, you're happy for a day; stay curly, you're happy for life!" Curly hair can be a positive feature, instead of a burden. :) Lots of people have given advice already, but here's my $0.02 on curly hair.    If you want to run out and pick something up locally, I recommend trying the following products:  - Drugstore: L'oreal out of bed weightless texturizer (black tub, use under gel), LA Looks or Herbal essences gels, Suave naturals or vo5 conditioners, L'oreal vive pro hydra gloss or nutri gloss for curly hair, red Cream of Nature shampoo  - Organic/specialty store (like whole foods): Giovanni Direct Leave in condish, G conditioners, G tea tree shampoo, Aubrey Organics Honeysuckle Rose or White Camellia Conditioners, AO B-5 Design gel  - ULTA: Devacurl products, Biosilk rock hard gelee, MOP-c curl defining cream (They also carry drugstore products and giovanni.)    These are all good things I have used, but be sure to tinker around with amounts and how you use any products. For hair type specific products check out these forums:  http://www.naturallycurly.com/curltalk/  There you can find others with the same hair type and try out some of their favorite products. However, the most popular ones are usually only available online.    Here are some basic tips for curly hair that you might find helpful:  *Try to find a stylist who knows how to work with curly hair. You can find reviews by region here: http://www.naturallycurly.com/curlsalons  *Don't shampoo every day.  *Comb conditioner through hair in the shower.  *Apply styling products to dripping wet hair. Scrunch or twirl hair to achieve desired shape.  *Use styling products suited for your hair type. Dont know yours? http://www.naturallycurly.com/hair-types  *Avoid terrycloth towels on hair; use linen, paper towels, or t-shirts instead.  *Air dry or use a diffuser with your blowdryer.  *Don't touch (or brush!) your hair while its drying.  *Once completely dry scrunch out any crunchy texture.    Lastly, it has made my hair so much better since I started the curly girl method! I used to almost never wear it down (it was a frizz/poof ball), but now I have pretty, shiny curls. ~:) Its pretty radicalno sulfates (shampoo) or siliconesbut its so great for curly hair.

I have the same problem and people constantly tell me to get it chemically straightened.  Don't - it's a waste of your time and money. Plus you're too young for that.  My recommendation to you is to try different smoothing serums and gels.  They work for me to tame the curl into more of a pretty wave.  Otherwise scrunch it.  Good luck!|`|3BvRAGcQaa	I have curly hair too, but i've learned kind of just to embrace it and I've found great ways to make it look like a salon job. If you are just too tired of straightening it all the time you can go to a salon and have them chemically straighten it. Its like a perm, but reverse. the bad thing is it wears of and sometimes it doesn't always look that great.|`|G0JmZYMtaa	first, stay away of the flat iron. it frizzes up your hair and takes away natural moisture. Start to use a moisturizing shampoo. I would recomend "Ausie" Make sure to sleep with your hair down, and when you have the chance, wear your hair down. It's curly because it lacks moisture.|`|YPWBwF60aa	Well practise makes perfect.    I have naturally curly hair so I can totally feel your pain.  They say the grass is always greener.    What are you doing to straighten your hair?  Are you using a high end ceramic straightener?  I have experienced this myself.  The cheaper the iron, the less likely it will straighten your hair with excellent results.  I use a Chi brand ceramic straightener and I swear by it.  It cost me $250 and was worth every penny.    If you are already using an expensive straightener or you can't be bothered to straighten it every day you can speak with your hair stylist about getting a chemical straightening.  I understand that many salons offer this service but I can't say how awful it is for your hair.  I have personally never felt the need to go that far as my Chi does me wonders.    I hope that helps!    Cheers|`|Vrdw9gccaa	my hair is natually curly EXTREMELY curly. I didn't like it when I was your age either but now I learned many ways to handle it. If you want it straight you are going othave to striaghten it. There are chemical straighteners you can use but they wont make you hair perfectly striaght, just alittle bit.  If you want to beable to wear it down and curly you can use gel, mouse, and leave-in conditioner. My favorite is Leave-in conditioner becuase It is good for your hair.  Gel will keep your hair from frizzing and getting really puffy... I use that alot as well.    I don't really understand what you want done with you hair though can you explain it alittl emore?       I read above that soemone spent $250 on a Chi Hair striaghtener I got mine for $120... but I found one even better and surprisingly it was only $40 it's amazing if your interested let me know I can give you the name and everything|`|OjKSt6mYaa	Hey I live with it. I Found it's easy to just go with it. take it to your advantage. Curley hair can be really hot if you take good care of it. Straighteners normally only damage your hair and make it rough. So condition, shampoo, brush a lot. Make it healthy and smooth and You're in the league. Whenever I grow mine out, I do that and people really like it.    And yes, I'm straight. I'm just extremely hygienic.    Reply to added detail: Well, What you can do is straighten it till then. Mousse, anything. But once it's long enough then use above instructions :)|`|RYDFHGVgaa	www.naturallycurly.com is the place to go. It teaches you about your curly hair. I used to have frizzy ugly curly hair and soon I was in control on how my curls look and They look cute now. I used to straighten my hair too but now my hair looks good and it is easier than straitening.|`|uThfPuQAaa	I also have naturally curly hair (I'm half jewish), and it's too short to flat iron. I've had more Afro jokes than you can imagine. After years of reading web pages, asking professional stylists, and just trying products, I finally have a system that works perfect. My hair is in such good condition that I can wear it straight or curly, and it'll look good either way.    First off, curly hair requires way different care than straight hair does. Our hair is extremely dry compared to other hair types, so the first thing I can tell you is to stop using shampoo, and just scrub your scalp really well with your conditioner. Shampoo contains sulfates, which really strip hair of it's natural moisture. Just trust me on this.    Do not use any conditioner that contain Silicons, and your hair will not become sticky from doing this. If you (or your parents) don't want to spend money on expensive conditioner, then you can use the Suave Naturals conditioner, which you can find at Rite-Aid and most other places for about $2.99. If you can afford it, then my best recommendation would be Aveda's "Be Curly" conditioner. You can use the shampoo too, as it doesn't contain sulfates, but I personally only use the conditioner.     Your hair will always be naturally curly, but when it's in perfect health and well conditioned it won't have frizz or poof, just spirals and full, soft, curls and waves.     You also do not need to wash your hair every day, so you can straighten it less often. When your hair is in good condition, it will not loose it's straightness over night. My girlfriend and I both only straighten our hair once or twice a week.    Because I have short hair, I use this tool to straighten it: http://www.rsessiontools.com/rootcontrol... My girlfriend also uses it for touch ups to her long hair, and it's really great. Don't use it how they tell you - just use it like a hair brush but use slower motions, and it'll straighten a lot faster than a flat iron. It won't burn your scalp at all, but be careful not to burn your hands with it.    You also need a good heat protector that won't build up on your hair. The only one I can recommend is Aveda's Brilliant Damage Control. It's light and washes right out with water and conditioner.     Aveda Be Curly Conditioner: http://www.aveda.com/templates/products2...    Aveda Brilliant Damage Control:http://www.aveda.com/templates/products2...    Those are the *only* products you need. Once your hair is in good condition, it'll be able to stay straight for days using whatever flat iron you already have.    If you want to try a new flat iron, I recommend the Solia line. They're cheaper than Sedu, and I personally think they work better. You can find it here: http://www.folica.com/Solia_Tourmalin_d1...    That said, whatever flat iron you're using is probably fine for now. Good product and healthy hair is much more important.    Also, never use heat styling above 350 degrees, because this can actually deconstruct the chemistry of your hair, causing permanent damage. This will make it look worse curly and straight. 350 degrees can straighten anything just fine, so make that highest heat you ever use. Lower is better for your hair.    Good luck, and please give these suggestions a try. In a week or two, you'll see that I'm right about all this.|`|AA10025824	If it wasn't curly you'd end up curling it.|`|OpduZC3Eaa	I have naturally curly hair and I love it! I used to want straight hair but now I appreciate my curls. Curls are more exciting and have more body than straight hair. If you need some frizz control then I suggest to use shampoo and conditioner that specializes in moisture and then use a leave in conditioner. That will help keep the curls in there shape instead of the frizz. Learn to appreciate your hair, you could have none at all!|`|8pDblyCBaa	curly is way better. Straight is boring.

I guess you always want what you don't have but, really; curls are so gorgeous. I can't imagine not wanting them. I have lots of friends with curls, and I'm sooo envious.    Have you considered trying to own them instead of frying your hair? I have a friend (she's 22), and she works her curls by pinning them up sort of haphazardly and she always looks stunning.     If you really want to get rid of them (sob!), you could get a relaxant treatment at the salon. It'll soften your curls and at least make them wavy, if not straight.|`|2i1wVB47aa	curly hair is gorgeous, you can use john freida products to control the frizz and hold the curls in place.    also, you can tie bandannas or something around your head, to cover up the hair when you get into the show, so you dont HAVE to wash it every day and it keeps the steam and humidity from the shower from making it frizz.|`|57dcd8c9cd435a421ee284618e113a81aa	I know how you feel!

Don't damage your young precious hair with these products and irons for straightening!  Try frizz ease products to tame it, and put jewel barettes in it to hold it back, maybe.

For fast results, you must change your eating habits. And because you want fast results, you must make drastic changes. However, hunger will not be one of the solutions. Some prefer to have set menus to stick to, some people prefer rules. This contains a bit of both.   Breakfast Ideas: Toast with vegemite (unless you're not an Aussie, in which case: Try it, decide you hate it, read How to Enjoy Vegemite , try it again) or your favourite spread (preferably without butter, unless it's vegemite which is disgusting without butter.   Just to talk up vegemite a little more: It has almost no calories - 4 per tablespoon or something ridiculous like that.   So anyway: Toast with vegemite, a banana and coffee; cereal with skim milk and fruit; that kind of thing. Some can't wake up without coffee, and it's an appetite suppressant so thumbs up.   Lunch Ideas: At some schools, most people bring their lunch from home, of course, what it's like in other countries and schools vary, but do know that what you can bring from home will most likely always be better than what you can buy at any canteen/tuck shop/cafeteria.   Sandwich on wholegrain/wholewheat/multigrain bread - just as long as it's not that white crappolla - with cheese, ham or chicken, salad veggies (tomato, cucumber, lettuce, etc), mayo, tomato sauce (sounds weird but it actually tastes really great, don't dog it until you've tried it), salt and pepper; if you have access to boiling water you can bring those powdered soups in a thermos and a bread roll; dinner leftovers are always great.   Snack Ideas: carrot and fruit, natural yogurt and berries (you may need to add a tiny amount of sugar to this, depending on how sweet your yogurt is); a handful of nuts; veggies (like carrots, beans, snow peas) and low fat dip; i think you get the idea   Dinner Ideas: One idea is: 1/2 veggies, 1/4 protein, 1/4 carbs. If your parents make fatty foods for tea, only have a little and make yourself a salad as well. If you're cooking for yourself here's some easy ideas: pasta with tomato based sauce; quick soup (the powdered type you add hot water to) and bread; scrambled eggs; if you really can't be bothered, just make yourself a sandwich or heat up leftovers; eat baked beans cold from the can and have a bit of salad after. It really doesn't matter, just as long as you follow that basic rules mentioned below.   Rules:   Breakfast: carbs, fruit, dairy   Lunch: carbs, veggies, protein   Dinner: carbs, veggies   Snacks: fruit, veggies, dairy, protein   For each meal, make the veggies the main part, then the protein, then the carbs. dairy falls in somewhere there too.   A serve fits in the palm of your hand   3 serves of fruit per day   3 serves of dairy per day(milk, cheese, yogurt)   4-5 serves of carbs per day   Go crazy on the veggies. You can have pretty well as much as you want.   Don't cut anything out completely. Well, except fast food (Maccas, Hungries (aka Burger King), KFC. Some facts about them are: Maccas soft serves are made from pig fat. KFC chips are fried in lard. Those thick-shakes have pretty much no natural ingredients in them (except probably fat). It's all preservatives and additives, and lots of bad things. Read "Chew On This" or "Fast Food Nation." You'll never eat junk food again.   Having said that, restrict consumption of: sugary, chocolate dark may be a bit healthier, but it is best to avoid! Have it once a week instead and you'll probably enjoy it more as well as lose weight, Butter, oil, fried crap, ice cream, or potatoes (they contain a LOT of starch). Chips, biscuits, cake, juice, cordial, soft drinks, or sausages - at the end of the day, you know what is good for you and what isn't   listen to your body, it will tell you what it wants and when it wants you to stop packing in junk. or just when your full. don't eat out of boredom   Get off your butt and exercise: Fast weight loss will only be achieved with diet and exercise.   Plan your week: Have 3 days where you do intense exercise - like running or a class at the gym. The other 3 days do low intensity exercise like a long walk and, well, that's about it. The other day is your day off.   An exercise "session" should go for about 30 minutes to an hour. You should burn at the very least 300 calories in a high intensity workout session in 30 minutes. Any less and you're not working hard enough   You're working hard enough if you're sweating profusely, breathless (not the whole time, but a good part of the time), and when you're done you can scull water with no effort because you need it that badly.   Do some weight training. Muscles burn calories by just being there. The more muscles you have, the faster you'll lose weight.   Always, always stretch before, and after you exercise. It's bloody hard to lose weight when you're injured.   Get very good at saying no when people offer you food that will sabotage your weight loss     xoxo_LEi
IOxB1uU8aa	Overnight: Use toothpaste.  I'm telling you, it dries up the surface and the redness goes down.  During the day cover it up with a little concealer or foundation.  That should clear it up in no time :]|`|v0FlUan0aa	Use concealer. and wash your face at least twice a day. use pimple cream|`|DU9dx1Uzaa	Grap an aspirin, crush it, and put a few drops of lemon juice on the powder...Not too much though, put the paste on your finger and rub it on the pimple, let it dry and keep it on your pimple over night...By morning the redness should be gone and it will be nothing, but a white head, which you can squeeze and it won't hurt, just add a lil conceiler and it will be ok.    Good luck.|`|Kp9YusZIaa	pop the pimple to get the puss out if still red then u just have to wait it out|`|B8sIpr5naa	Before you sleep, put Neosporin and a small bandage on it. It may help reduce the size and redness by morning. Green concealer does a great job of canceling out red tones. I dab it on any redness in the morning, cover it with powder foundation, and it's gone!|`|idhcqr5Daa	Wash your face daily with a good face wash.   Pat face dry with a towel.   Look at a grocery store for a redness reducing product to put on your pimple.   Eye drops are made to remove redness in the eyes, but they work just as well on your pimples. Squirt at least three drops on your pimple.   Wait at least five minutes.   Put ice on the pimple.   Normal soap is fine, but you should really use specialized face wash if you have it.   Use an oil-free sunblock of SPF 15 or more everyday. It makes your skin softer and prevents the sun from making your pimple worse.   If you don't have eye drops around, you can use a fever reducing OTC drug like Ibuprofen. It reduces redness, hence the name. Just one of two pills does the trick and takes about the same time as the eye drops.   If you have bad acne it helps to go to a dermatologist who can prescribe you medication to take by mouth. The acne will disappear in a few months   Sudocrem works! It is used for nappy rash in babies, but does remove some redness! Just make sure you rub it in before you leave the house!   Wash your face first with hot water so that your pores open, thus allowing the face cleanser to clean better. Then before drying your face splash cold water onto your face to close your pores, preventing residue going into your pores.   Be very careful if you're going to take medication such as Ibuprofen to reduce redness, as Ibuprofen was not intended for that purpose. Always ask a doctor first.   Only attempt to pop a pimple if it has come to a head, and the pus is clearly visible from the surface    x0x0_LEi|`|XAYLOLIMaa	Ice can bring down swelling and redness.  Also, if you happen to have Visine, it works wonders on redness. Just dab a little on your pimple, and (like in your eyes) the red will disappear.  :]|`|3DHv7lGRaa	Put toothpaste on it.. it'll dry it up, as if you were to pop it.. it just makes it worse.|`|qXw9RqN1aa	I swear by toothpaste. It has yet to let me down.    Put a little bit of toothpaste on your pimple before you go to bed and wash your face in the morning. I always see it noticeably less red and swollen in just one night.    If you get proactive, the refining mask that comes with the set works wonders.

5wAk1Ctkaa	yes its best to go to a credible salon to get it done to be safe, but it still can cause damage to your hair with the chemicals, your best bet is to redye it a light color or wait til it grows out|`|hOVzviFIaa	Not back to your basic "virgin natural hair color" You can lighten it with bleach then color it to match your natural hair color, but it is near impossible to actually rid your hair of all processed colors|`|4SyINs07aa	i don't think so but the color will eventually fade. i think you can also use more dye over the other color to try to return the natural color.  if it is not completely permanent you can use dish washer soap and that will definitely get most of the color out of your hair|`|BWttPY1taa	ya just have to let your hair grow again in natural again, that is real natural

VHDLTFG2aa	yes....since you are straightening it alot (like i did) and you are teasing it alot(like i did) and you do it everyday(like i did) all the damage together will do a great deal of damage to your hair...the heat makes it unsoft and stiff and also dry and the teasing makes it ratty and hard to brush and get out...and when you do it every day it's gonna make your hair fall out...now that i stopped everytime i brush it my hair strands fall out...it's not like a huge chunck but it is enough for people to notice it when you wear a black shirt and you have blonde hair like me...so TRUST me don't do it every day not even once a week...it's bad|`|3sCrTA1Raa	yes  the  teasing  makes it  dry and brittle.  then if you dye it  a lot ifll cause your  hair to fall out. pretty bad|`|ADWIWx5Baa	You mean teasing it?

If it's short just spike it with gel.|`|zZ8kMeImaa	No, it damages your appearance.|`|FqcvXnybaa	YES! all that teasing, product, and straightening. have you ever felt some of their hair? feels like straw|`|zzPOffFtaa	It honestly really does.  The teasing pulls at your roots and it breaks your hair.    I can't say much cuz i've done it and I've dyed my hair lots so its kinda up to you. Just remember to use a repair shampoo    I say Long Term Relationship by herbal essences.  Its amazing, and repairs your hair very well.|`|R3NbFHqkaa	depends  if you color it and if you straighten it every day!  as long as when you tease it you dont super tangle it your hair shouldnt be damaged|`|ddf965c9d1b1218ffa9131a9a0da9e0caa	unless you use fake exensions - yes|`|CyWXSg5Jaa	YES! Teasing it tears your hair.
JafLyLYgaa	200, maybe 250? It's hard to tell, thats not a great picture.   That might not look too good with childbirth, but looks like a cool tattoo.     good luck!|`|uD1UFdRsaa	I think it's best if you go to the actually tattoo parlour and ask yourself. You'd get a better idea.|`|GSbz9Zq4aa	i think it depends how long it takes|`|7rD3uJzdaa	Counting on if you want it the same size? I would say roughly between $200-$300 ? Counting on how many hours it would take to do it? Hope my answer was helpful?|`|5ZKqU2sIaa	Probably $100-$150 But that is way cute though!|`|XXBhA532aa	Depends how big you want the letters? What style of writing? Want the letters colored in? What color?     These are a factor in the price.    Look at previous work the artist did, if you can come in while the artist is doing someone else's tattoo would be Great.

Do the same thing on other side.(while sitting) Put on both feet and grab on side/leg  with both hands to glide  fabric up leg to about knee. Do other side , then when at knees, pull one  or alternately slide up and gently  with both hands to crotch. or do one leg at a time. Then do mini squats to get the fabric up hips & around waist so the fabric does not puncture or snag. They should not be twisted or snagged! To remove take thumbs at back and  start at waite going down the bakcs of legs to heels to remove and there should be no snags, and then you can either wash or leave bunched up to put on easy next time only you will just put your feet in both bottom, and alternately pull up to do the squat thing so they fit at crotch without fabtic being stuck in between crotch and middle thigh.

CDuVY53Iaa	I know this problem well!    I just got this from my hairstylist and I LOVE it! It's Kenra Platinum Hot Spray. When you spray it on dried hair (only need a little) it feels like hair spray. Straighten your hair and it not only protects your hair from the extreme heat of the straightening iron, but it leaves my very frizzy hair very soft and manageable. It looks healthy now!    It's a little pricy but you will love it! Try it!    http://www.sleekhair.com/3312.html|`|22479221292188a6607f3f3cc2c2b5a1aa	Couple drops of biosilk works great!    BioSilk silk therapy serum, you can find it almost anywhere...|`|Ogh2zd7eaa	get to a beauty store and ask there.why do you use this straightener if your hair doesn't need it?|`|Et0IeGJ4aa	i would use a strighting hair spray and/or frizz control products. one of my friends has crazy frizzy hair and she uses frizz shampoo and conditioner and it helps or ruturn the strightner|`|VHDLTFG2aa	well if it is static electricity in the hair then take a laundry sheet and wipe it through ur hair....but with frizz look for a frizz serum at your local drug store and try it out...|`|zzPOffFtaa	I love the way asians hair feels and looks haha i think its beautiful.  Okay I think that you should use a de frizzer cream I use    http://images.buzzillions.com/images_pro...    then spray a heat protecting spray on your hair.  Wait about 30 seconds then straighten.  It works pretty well.  If not then take any body lotion you have and run it through your hair. Not to much so it won't look greasy but enough so it will all stay down :]|`|Co9I2OMSaa	My aunt works in a salon and she gave me great tips on straightening my hair.  You should put gel or mousse or some product in your hair before straightening, when you have wet hair.  Then straighten your hair, even as it is wet- it gives the best results.  Some people like clipping their hair up and working on one layer at a time, it gives fantastic results!  And make sure you work from the top to the bottom, and go relatively slow.  The product in your hair and the wetness should help in the frizzy/static your hair gets.|`|R3NbFHqkaa	depends on your shampoo and conditioner and if you straighten it right after you blow dry it  try showering and letting your hair dry half ways and hen blow drying it  and then wait a little and then Straighten it  try straightning serum  :D|`|9dQo0qGaaa	chi silk infusions  -target sells it =]|`|lqeQDRNnaa	hey hun well first use good shampoo and conditioner like redken     then simply blow dry your hair straight FIRST or let it air dry  but if yew blow dry it make sure to use hair products like serum leave in conditioners THERMAL HEAT SPRAY|`|lkkUh6eeaa	Well especially because it is cold there is more static in the air. You can spray a heat protectant with frizz-control or use a frizz control hairspray or something antifrizz. Make sure it's somethign durable. Hope i helped! :)
AA10090215	people who are calling her ugly are just jealous   she is pretty  make-up cant magically make you beautiful  there has to be something about you in the first place  I personally dont think shes absolutely amazing   but she is very pretty|`|sg0m6LBRaa	fudge yeah there is.  she's FAKE.  see the ugly face that cowers underneath all that makeup and fakeness.    and aishwarya rai is pretty but only with makeup. you can only say someone is beautiful when they are absolutely gorgeous without any fake hair/straightener/curler/makeup.|`|zmjAccMFaa	Her face is just a little scary looking.  Or maybe it is just all the makeup?|`|24Xy8qWtaa	She's way too fake looking and something about her eyes creeps me out.|`|zFKULGWfaa	She's a Model DAH|`|ZY2GT7edaa	you picked a weird pick of her. she doesn't look extremely attractive in that one, but i do think she is GORGEOUS|`|rj5KWEtcaa	she looks so plastic, people like that are making young girls so self conscious. she would probably look better without being caked in fake tan and foundation.|`|VegwUJiCaa	sexy|`|ZHf8mIitaa	She used to be cute when she was younger.

Modeling isn't about rolling out of bed and then getting straight onto the runway, so of course she's going to be a bit made up.|`|xLBlowmPaa	deng! i think shes sexy with or  without makeup (no homo)! but in thaat picture she should tone it down just a bit(:

My best friend actually worked for Clairol and when people would complain about their hair being dried out from coloring or styling tools they would recommend this conditioner! Its only like 4 bucks and if you leave it on for a few minutes you will feel a total difference. Also washes away clean without buildup and wont weigh your hair down. My hair is thin too and that is what I use.     You could also try Hask brand Placenta treatment for your hair. Sounds gross but most conditioners have it anyway. Its a packet that works like a mask on your hair. Does wonders!!! You can find it at most drug stores

qOKFuXfLaa	if you miss spots while cleaning your face while washing off the makeup, then yes, it will cause acne If you sleep with your makeup, you will most likely grow acne. If you do not use makeup remover to remove your makeup, you will probably get acne as well.     I do not like using foundation for that matter.|`|joiacDUdaa	Depends on if you use non-communigentic foundation or not... Other factors include on if you are using the proper skin type of foundation... for example if you have oily skin stick with oil-free products... Even using old dirty make-up sponges and brushes can contribute to getting acne with your make-up routine.  So, wash your brushes or replace every so often ditto for make-up sponges.... Washing your face every AM/PM and getting off all traces of make-up will help as well... Also, using the right products for your skin type...    good luck|`|SJLgRqgSaa	well yeah it does.    think about it like this your ment to clean your face daily to get rid of buildup of everyhting on your skin and makeup covers your skin all day long, which clogs the pores and dosent allow it to breathe, add this to pollution and your enviroment and boom, a recipe for bad skin.    however just make sure you clean your skin well and use facial masks every week!! xx|`|mhyL7Qw3aa	No it won't make you break out.|`|Z0GfGZtJaa	Acne and zits are not the same.

Start talking in school, and then maybe hang out outside of school and become friends. THen become BF/GF ! ! ! !

Because from there on you start talking, then you can randomly say hi in the halls or IM him.
VtPZmOC1aa	First if all, the red that you are trying to get will fade really fast.  So, unless she wants to dye her hair every 2 weeks, I would advise against it.  Having said that, I would use a level 6.  Level 7 will turn her blonde a pink color, and level 5 will look more like a dark red-brown.  I would go with a 20 or 30 volume developer to make sure you get the lift you need from the brown pieces.  Also, rinse WHILE you are taking foils out or it will stain the other parts of the hair.
WCNsmyZBaa	OOoohh Well u could tryy..  A curling iron , buut     instead of using the clamp thing just wrap it around the barrel ..    =\    Im making no sense ..

You could use a quarter inch curling iron and probably get that look after a while of working at it, but your best bet is probably to go with a crimper. I have one from Conair that works quite well, and if you change it up you can probably get a look close to the one in the picture.|`|D9ZT6kzXaa	Use a 1"-2" curling iron & don't use the clamp. If you do, it gives you tight ringlet-like curls, but if you don't it gives you pretty loose waves.

pVhQOAznaa	I take it you mean my turn ons/offs in regard to a girlfriend.  On: intelligence (above all), good taste in music (or at least passionate enough about the music they do like), a bit strange, good sense of humour, interesting dress sense (as in they dont dress just like every other twat), should generally have a vagina, pretty in an understated way (though looks are probably the least important thing in my eyes).    Off: vanity, stupidity, prejudice, ignorance, dullness, dislike music, act like everyone else, being classed as a normal, well adjusted human being.|`|E29aGtxdaa	aww eww dirtyyyy haha XD|`|3fnKYTGyaa	Turn on: great sense of humor.

I don't know about you, but most people think she is a beautiful girl and she is pale. Angelina Jolie is pretty pale too.    Honestly, I ised to get spray tans all the time because people made fun of me for being fair skinned, but now I realize they're just jealous.  When you're fair, you can always get tanner.

Look through any high fashion magazine, and you will notice all the models are pale. It's considered very beautiful all over the world. Being tanned is actually quite an old fashioned thing now, something of the 70s. The people who think you should get a spray tan are stuck in their little bubble of what they think is right.    Naturally I have a dark complexion, I tan very easily in the sun. However, I'm proud that at the moment I look pale.

I must have the same skin as you do, I avoid the sun for the same reasons. What I learned once I accepted the fact that I'm never going to tan is this: our skin looks unhealthy if we don't take good care of it. Drink lots of water, and make sure to exfoliate your body, not just your face, it helps keep your skintone all over even.|`|uC0xTgkeaa	of coarse! just embrase the fact that you're pale and use it to your advantage.|`|dFmZhtpvaa	absolutly it makes you very unique some ppl are very tanned and it is very sick pale is a very unique way of saying this is me and i will stay me....i'm very fair skinned as well i put makeup on my face and all i get is zits and then my arms and neck are all pale cause i put tanned foundation and blush. it is very pretty i personally think! ;)|`|QhfFndgiaa	of course! theres this one girl at my school who fake bakes all the time, & she bleaches her hair. she looks like a friggen oompa loompa & shes always made fun of!   ugh, i hate when people try to get skin cancer like that, it's discusting|`|RFCcWPliaa	I'm pale-skinned as well.

I am Irish and Italian and all i got was pale skin! None of that beautiful, tan olive skin that most Italians get. Pale skin will make you look young and holds the light well. If your features like eye lashes and brows are light in color, you may want to bolden them a bit with makeup or wear some blush, but don't worry about your skin tone. Spray tanning will look unnatural and is too expensive to keep up with, and real tanning will harm you!|`|LPilzLnZaa	HELL YEAAAAA!!!!  im like the most pale person at my school!!!  but if people judge you like that..... SCREW THEM!!!  pale is BE-U-TEE-FULL!!!!|`|zRZKdH1Zaa	I like pale skin better than tanned, actually.  So yes, pale IS beautiful, :)
BpxY1Tk1aa	Yes you can easily go red from any colour but black. But be warned, once it's in it's a nightmare to get out or colour over. As with black, it takes many sessions of bleaching to get it to a colour where the red won't show through to the colour your trying to achieve.  My younger sister has naturally red hair and I coloured (8washes) and cut it yesterday afternoon, however the colour wouldn't take and when I washed the colour from her hair there was almost no difference to when I started. I know it's different seeing as it's her natural colour, but red is a strong colour and if you haven't thought it through very much, I urge you to really consider if you want a reddish look in your hair for a time to come.|`|SHdrYV0Naa	best way is to talk to your hair dresser, he/she will always know best.  you will never go wrong with there answers.

I have the same problem as you, so I've gone through trying alot of make up brands & even tones. Right now I am using mineral power (by maybelline) & I do like it, but whenever I get the chance, I use my friends bare minerals which is amazinggg. It's about 60 Dollars, but they supply you with alot of things, like brushes & the perfect brush & you only have to use a little bit of make-up which is great for oily skin. The best part is, they send you TWO shades so you can get the perfect one for you - & maybe one will wind up darker than you & you can use it if you tan a little in the summer. I think even better than that though, is the fact that it's healthy for your skin & lasts all day.|`|7It1K9ijaa	I use Organic Wear, you can get it at your local CVS or Target. It gives good coverage and it's good for your skin.|`|XiOIBwbPaa	cover girl true blend, it doesn't make you look orange because theres a colour for all completions :).. you can get it really anywhere you can buy cover girl make-up.|`|XNMw2hpraa	Loreal True blends or Covergirl seem to be the best. I have really pale skin too. It's all about matching the shade. Your natural undertones are either pink or yellow. If they're pink and you wear the wrong shade, you turn orange. So try to find one for someone with pink undertones.|`|oAkGBiobaa	dude i am so pale its almost scary. anyway just get the lightest foundation that the store sells. thats wat i do and im not orange at all. oh i mostly go with covergrl by the way.|`|6jXuUCdraa	http://www.blog.makeupmoxie.com/2008/01/...      works great! :)    and very cheap as well. you can find it at your local drug store.|`|IPATFSAcaa	I cant use any kind of foundation because Im ghostly white. SO I use covergirl clean pressed powder in ivory and add water to it. It makes it sort of creamy and then I apply it with the little owder puff. But thats what I have to do for my stupid pale skin. Ugh|`|Eo4PngmAaa	i think you should try non-oiled foundation because it doesn't harm or makes ur skin turn orange and its nuetrugena and u can find it at walmart or target|`|9IDDxwoaaa	Well cover girl is great. They have many different colors to choose from. I never use foundation cause it does tend to leave an orangish color. Try using powder!|`|EwtCmQctaa	all foundations come in a variety of colours, i'm really pale and tend to use colours such as ivory, alabaster and porcelain.   test them on the inside of your wrist first  depending on what budget your on go for rimmel, mac or maybelline :D  make sure you wear a light dust of bronzer/blush so you dont look too pale!|`|W9VLXTfpaa	victorias secret has some good cream foundations of fair color.  Or in walmart there are some revlon, and maybelline.       What i do to make my skin not look oily or dry is:  I take a liquid foundation and a makeup pad with a powder foundation and mix it.  use the pad for the powder, apply the liquid to the face and rub it in.   that should help with the oily part.

qOKFuXfLaa	you should clean them every other day and deep clean them every week.    I don't use foundation much, but when I do, I wash it immediately after I apply it. I don't want to take my chances and break out|`|SJLgRqgSaa	once a week or you can get bacterica on it or get infections etc    get baby shampoo and gently wash it with that and thenleave it in water for a while and then it dry overnight!    also bourjois has a new foundation with a brush built in so you know!! xx|`|mhyL7Qw3aa	You should deep clean your brushes every week or every other week. All you need is a mild soap or a baby shampoo. All you do is wet it and apply your soap or shampoo on the brush. Then rub the brush up and down a couple of times to work the soap through. Then rinse until the water turns clear again. You might have to repeat one more time.  Lay flat on a towel and let dry over night.|`|CPZe3g74aa	every time you use it.    you can use soap and water, (warm water)    yeah, I hate it when it dosn't clean completly, i find seperating the bristles and really cleaning it thoroughly works.|`|kT7akcE6aa	It depends how often you use it.  If you use it everyday you should be cleaning it out around once a week, once a month at max.    Here's a youtube vid that shows how to properly cleanse your brushes without damaging them or making the hairs fall out http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0THVu8jNW...|`|3916f36babf2260a21d0a9cd8e5a3e64aa	You're supposed to wash your foundation brush after every single use because it gets moist and can harbor bacteria.  I wash all of my brushes in baby shampoo and let them air dry overnight.  You can get all the product out if you swish the brush is warm, soapy water and rinse thoroughly.  You might have to repeat this several times.  Just make sure you are very gentle.  It's a good idea to have a second foundation brush so you always have a clean one ready while the other one is drying out.|`|3Y3pPdl0aa	I would suggest once a week or once every 2 weeks!     Brushes like sponges carry bacteria and germs in addition to cleaning them I would suggest switching to a new brush every month as well. Because this is used on your face with open pores it's a great idea to keep the brush as fresh as possible to avoid and limit breakouts!|`|GIqACtxvaa	I clean my brushes monthly with hot soapy water and vinegar in a coffee sized cup.  The vinegar has natural anti-bacterial properties in it.  I use a dye and fragrance free liquid soap  from seventh generation.   Thuis is a very natural cleanser so it will not irritate your skin.     I allow my brushes to soak in the steaming hot solution for 10 min and then I rinse thouroughly.  Allow to dry completely before use.  There's no science in how to mix up the solution just like one drop of soap, enough to make some suds and equal parts water and vinegar.  Lots of luck!  :)

Hope that helps.|`|wXkalwglaa	ballet flats would look good :)    and about the color...i like the first one (white and gray) cuz the navy looks like a sailor...the red looks like santa...and the last one is too dark :p|`|8kfGyvlfaa	well if you are wearing grey leggings then i would go with either the white and grey or the black and grey    due to the length of the top, i would not wear heels...i would wear black boots or white boots.  black if you get black and grey  white if you get white and grey|`|DR4LYQBtaa	uh, the red one... and leggings are dumb.. but i love that top go with jeans or somthing.. and some flats would work|`|JdpVNgyxaa	Buy white / navy and then you can work the nautical look!    Some cute flats would work well with that, though sandals could look good too.  It's kinda of a summery look, so don't wear anything too statement-y    These in black and gold could work:  http://www.forever21.com/product.asp?cat...    Or go for a nautical edge with these:  http://www.forever21.com/product.asp?cat...|`|EA5IN1BQaa	Red Flats... they go with everything..|`|yPRhc6oWaa	get the blue and white top american eagle brand of shoes are cute and sold at payless there are some cute heels there there are not high heels but there comfy they have hot pink and black|`|QGb6SU1Iaa	some silver flats or maybe a simple silver heal...another cute thing would be s long silver necklace..maybe a bracelet too.|`|YWaUaPaSaa	black,silver,gray or white flats dont do chucks or vans|`|l0C8VbQdaa	A PAIR OF PINK FLATS        (IF YOUR A GIRLY KIND OF PERSON)  >.                                              A PAIR OF DARKISH GREY OR SILVER FLATS          (IF YOR A KIND OF PERSON THAT I CANT THINK OF RIGHT NOW.)

And I'm gonna guess you're pretty young. 13?|`|fmCPTzG2aa	yur pretty id give you a 10! no homo   and maybe 14-15 about my age  answer my ?  pleez it's the first and second jus click my icon!!!|`|OFNmZbPCaa	yeah. 9...very pretty! 15?|`|8UyUhlusaa	I give you an 8.5  You're very pretty, be proud of your naturalnesseses.|`|hDs9Yr8vaa	you are cute.  but you look like 14.|`|sO5KeGu8aa	yes.  7/10  12 years old    anyone wanna answer mine  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|HvH14U5baa	the last pic is pretty cute, but you dont need to ask people, because youre only pretty if you think so.|`|E7lLlutEaa	i think you're reallllllllllllllllllllllllly cute|`|zEDEK2eOaa	6..about age 15|`|DiKxWz7Faa	yeah ur really cute!!!!!!!  omg really.....  10  ~mabey 15 or 14
fTxpALvxaa	Very cute dress. A nice dressy, black, heeled boot(or a flat heeled boot since it will be snowy) that hits about 2 inches below the knee will look perfect!! And don't wear leggings, if you want to do stockings use a nude color so it doesn't look like you are wearing any.    A black, tailored jacket/trench would look great over it, even a black cardigan, so you aren't freezing your booty off.    Hope this helps! :)|`|XLhOUUDuaa	If your dress was longer the boots would work out for ya, but a nice pair of heels would work too!! :) leggings would look cute with a dress!!|`|CVQa88Ujaa	oh I know where this dress comes from unfortunately the companies that sell these off price dresses the dresses rip and tears and the sewing is poor.  I would recommend looking around for other dresses.  I don't like this dress , but I will tell you that this dress can be bought from some companies whole sale also or individually.  I don't have anything against off price dresses, but this companies that sell these dresses the quality is very poor.|`|iuQ2DBoyaa	well i don't much care for the dress, but if you wear WHITE leggings with it that will be okay. Wear heels not boots.|`|MFKgVsoAaa	i think it's cute as long as you have the body and the attitude for it. you have to have confidence! (not saying you don't). anyways, yes i think if you wear tights with it it will be ok, unless you choose to freeze your butt off instead. as for the shoes, it think heels would work better since the dress is more formal/fancy for just boots. i would wear black or silver. if you don't want heels, how about flats? go for a clean, shiny or at least well-kept pair so it's still formal enough to match the theme of the dress. plus, with flats you can get away with red, which will help you stand out in the crowd (red heels might be a bit too tacky with that specific dress). you can wear long, dangly silver earrings and put your hair up in a messy bun like this http://photos.weddingbycolor.com/p/000/0...  or  http://www.latest-hairstyles.com/blog/wp...  http://www.shawnasboutique.com/uploads/1...  hope i helped. have fun!!!

As for the first one, can't really tell, and second one looks like she's about 11... not very pretty, sorry.|`|8UyUhlusaa	Your friends have the coolest names EVER.  Esme look like an old fashioned type of beauty, really classic, from what I can see.    Faye is very wide eyes and has really cute features, she'll be really pretty when she's older.    Tallulah has like movie star looks. Seriously what a stunning girl!     Your friends are beautiful.|`|s3FWCRGxaa	they dont believe you bc they arent pretty.|`|6dp1bXdEaa	Esme- From the little that I can see, she is bonny, however it is hard to make her out.    Faye- Looks pretty from what I can see, however, she needs to take the tape off her mouth!    Tallulah- Absolutely gorgeous. Sort of, a young movie star look. Gonna be a stunner when she is older!    :]|`|Jd7SnU4Vaa	I think the last girl is pretty.
auUeI2Vnaa	If they have awesome hair, they must not be emo.|`|mqMhrmloaa	Burn your hair - you'll look so cool.|`|9F0iuuMYaa	If you like your hair keep it. So what if the guys have the "Emo" style hair. Don't change for them. Stay yourself.|`|TBRMH4hbaa	First of all, emo is a genre of music, not a type of person. You should do your hair how you like not to blend in with the group of people you hang out with. Go to www.photobucket.com and type in 'scene hair' and i'm sure you'll find that choppy, gross, generic scene kid look you seem to desire.|`|kAblN2YTaa	cut your hair so that its long in the front like over the eyes type of look and have it short in the back with it going towards the front on the sides and if you want put dye it black and put a neon streak in it...i would say purple ^-^
f8a1395066a4e7dd0ff6d7f82d96ab35aa	Olive oil should be used to seal in moisture and for hot oil treatments. You can add it to your conditioner, but I wouldn't use it in place of one.
Jvvbt85jaa	hmmm okay idk how to explain how to do this... if you want to definitely bleach your hair and use the dye... bleach your hair and... hm you know how your hair goes over itself? like you have your top layer and the layer that touches your neck? idk how to explain this... bleach your hair and have the area that surrounds your neck be turquoise... they're called 'pick a boo" streaks    kind of like this" (the bottom left picture):    http://www.haircutshairstyles.com/the_ne...    here's a better description:     http://www.hairfinder.com/hair2/peekaboo...      ehhh I hope that made at least a little bit of sense!|`|BFyDoyotaa	Leave it black on the outside, and underneath dye it electric blue. I think that would look really cool...!|`|tQGRJBYAaa	I like hair really long and black. Just grow it out.|`|361dd3949c69e539c3ee64de86ebc3a3aa	Get it done professionally... you can seriously damage your hair with bleach.  You can find some funky/punkish hair salons if you google your area salons.    I would recommend keeping it black with some bleach.  I'm not sure how turq would look..and it would quickly fade with washing it leaving your streaks bleached again, so you may want to forget about the turqoise.  I like something like this:  http://i150.photobucket.com/albums/s114/...  its like black with bleach on top, looks cool! and its different from the typical bleached streaks or tips.  Or you can do the opposite, black on top, bleach underneath.|`|TgqyCy2Qaa	leave it black. Black hair is cool|`|TBRMH4hbaa	Bleach the entire underneath, and then add turqoise streaks into it.|`|IPATFSAcaa	Bleach your whole hair but leave one strip black. My bff did this and it looks super cool. She always gets compliments on it. Don't use the turquoise right now. Save it for a time when your feeling super edgy.    Kelsey|`|JyAUAbsjaa	just bleach some strands and do the strands turquoise. That would look really cool. Leave the rest of your hair black.|`|4YZBPfhRaa	i honestly wouldn't bleach your hair if its black. thats going to be sooooo harsh on your hair. i'd keep it black, i think black hair is cutee :]
SJLgRqgSaa	pour chocolate sauce on them and make him lick it off  get him to rub baby oil on them xx|`|AA12370001	let me get my 2 points before this gets deleted!|`|7TuMvfraaa	titi f****|`|pFS2LZGKaa	motor boat|`|v1tHjJ3haa	this is a sick question ! ):|`|24Xy8qWtaa	LOL.. this related to beauty and style how?|`|pCcq9M5iaa	let him suck on em..|`|v3fYmkfJaa	Umm.. whipped cream && cherries then have him eat it off.

4DgEnlKZaa	You can wash it over and over again until it is the color you want. Also heat makes hair lighten up some, so after washing it, dry it with a hair dryer.|`|dxeb0BfBaa	When trying to strip colour from hair to lighten it I use Johnson's Baby Shampoo. It contains a lot of sulfates which strip colour. It may take a while but it is sure to work. I use it almost everyday on clients who want to go lighter.|`|4426e23fcbe713a62fb9a5df2196730aaa	head and shoulders is said to fade hair color. never done it but heard of it alot. so maybe you can try that|`|E7u4LYWuaa	There are a few ways....  1)dandruff shampoo! it works GREAT! i love it and you don't need any certain brand just whatever is around the house!   2) a drop of dawn in a sink full of water. soak it and rinse it out.   and last of all(at least that i know of)   3)Another temporary color! just get a medium or light brown and it will even it out.
tjNJAn75aa	Use a shine shampoo and conditioner. I love John Freida Brilliant Brunettes or they do they same range for blondes called Sheer blonde. THen use their shine shock serum before you blow dry it. Try to get it as straight as possible when blow drying your hair by using a  large paddle brush. Pull your hair taught with the brush and hold the blow dryer very close and aim downwards in the direction the hair goes. Using the blow dryer and brush will give a more natural look. Then go over it with GHD hair straighteners. I've tried then all and they are by far the best.|`|SMsprdMfaa	I would say not to use chemicals on your hair.Why don't you go for some home remedies. Egg whites, lemon juice, oil massages, reducing stress and diet changes can reduce hair fall and make it healthier. You can find more cheap, effective and natural home remedies for hair loss as well as for healthy hair at http://www.wellnesstalk.org/hairfall.htm...|`|OSD5by7Oaa	try The Wen product!|`|vnOz03Aaaa	try pantene. i love it and it feels healthy on your hair.|`|v7oDo99Maa	Shampoo with Pantene Frizz Control and then use a curling iron two times: once in the morning, once in the afternoon. That's what I do!|`|iNneJk47aa	http://productsthatwork.rare-boutique.co...|`|LZVc3Uwaaa	im not sure if this will help you or not but my wife also has curly hair naturally and the best product for her hair is aussie its sold right at wal-mart and give her hair a very nice shine and extremely soft.

kT7akcE6aa	Kind of.  I have blonde highlights over a T-Section of my hair (which means that they do the top, front, and sides, but not the back/underneath), and my hair looks naturally blonde.  However, the underside is still a light brown colour, which you can see in my lower layers.  If you got a full head of blonde highlights, I think it would be a good way to ease into it.  For me anyway, the first set I got weren't THAT bright blonde, but when I went back for a touchup it came out much blonder and I loved the results.    I get mine done with foil rather than a highlight rubber cap thing (my stylist told me I had too much hair to use the cap and it would hurt like a mother to try to hook the hair through that way), so I don't know if the results would be more or less intense if you went down the cap route instead.    But generally I have to say that getting highlights and building upon them is better than, say, just bleaching your whole head altogether.|`|jky64DZ8aa	My friend got hers done and she was brunette but probably darker than you, the hairdressers told her to do it in stages    if your hair is more light brown it should be easier    ask a hairdresser theyll know what to do but i assume you should gradually build it up, start with slightly lighter than you hair colour highlights and it will gradually all blend     hope that helps a bit x|`|qn1yxUelaa	get a dye|`|GKJEgidzaa	Go to the hair dresser for sure, you could get streaks... but it will never look natural, If you ask your hair dresser to do it in slices it will look more natural, and as your hair is light brown it will pretty much just look blonde with natural low lights.|`|VTNvHwCWaa	True. But get it done professionallyly because it is worth the money you spend!!! I tried all kinds of ways and finally had to chop most of my hair off. i love my new cut , but, i would have liked this advice, trust me.
fMPyLqW4aa	Leggins with OVERSIZED NEON tshirts. My friend was an 80's chick for halloween and she wore pink neon leggings with a big white neon orange shirt and srunchy gold flats with her hair in like a cheerleader ponytail.|`|zPFclJznaa	this link will tell you everything! even hair & makeup!      http://www.liketotally80s.com/80s-fashio...|`|9ionkBvuaa	hot pink skinnys.|`|wTjNJEr1aa	i would crimp your hair, and wear either bright colors or leather. i would also wear chunky earrings, bracelets, and necklaces|`|3JWWaOTNaa	okay well your lucky because the 60's/70's flare jeans, faded tees, look is going out and the skinny jeans, bright colors is coming back. although it's more scene, but whatever.   try washed out skinny jeans and like a hot pink cut up, off the shoulder sweat shirt.   don't forget the leg warmers!!!  (+++plus you got a quick fashion history lesson)|`|VHQ7l1fMaa	google:    Glamour Kills Clothing  Scene   Gabe Saporta  Hot Topic      :)|`|L3byzh3Gaa	Care Bear t-shirt, zuba pants, maybe skin tight jeans if you have them, some old L.A. Gear shoes. just wear a lite-bright, dress in old clothes from good will, im sure you'll find some good stuff there, bright windbreaker. tights and big socks, work out clothes.|`|jExNAyvxaa	bright skinnys retro glasses a cute logo tee black pumps with chunky heels(or just flats if u dont like heels)
geyX4iW2aa	yes|`|grklGFwBaa	Definately.  If i see a guy with a pink mohawk and a guy with brown slicked back hair, I'd trust the 2nd guys intelligence.|`|kAXWFW33aa	I think so...    I am a very intelligent girl and I was blessed with blond hair. Growing up friend  and people around me would make dumb blond comments as if they were the first to make the joke. After high school I was so fed up with these ridiculous comments I finally dyed my hair a dark color and have not and will not go back to my natural color. So yes I believe your hair color has a lot to do with how people see you.|`|61abfb3c27511166d19130fdd59840ffaa	Yes it does. Unfortunatly, society perceives Blondes (which I am) as being dumband also believes that people with un-natural hair colours and black hair isn't intelligent.|`|cfKXshe3aa	defintitley i am  a blonde and most people think i am a dumb blonde and i get straight A's and am in honors math class yaa sure i have my stupid moments but who doesnt? it has nothing to do with my hair color people judge way to hard and are quck to find something to put others down to make themselves feel better|`|0GmZMCRzaa	I definitely think that is true. Blondes and people with dyed hair seem to be thought of as stupid or ignorant. Its a common misconception but can be true to some extent :)    hope that helped you out.
b274bdcef529af1a95fd443e4e73d070aa	You just shave everything except an inch in width strip in the middle. It looks sexy :)|`|U0KCmsKXaa	All it means is shaving your nether regions into a strip.  No big deal.
SWTPNiPOaa	ummmm  i wouldnt suggest it  its cutte but for prom?  homecoming maybe  but prom?1?  prom dress is the dress- cinderella ball  gorgous lengthy, draping beautiful    not short "sexy" dresses- sooo homecoming  but try something drapy and cinderellay :)|`|EgbIYBehaa	Betsy Johnson|`|575e4541cfc1bb43bc656e10c8383c16aa	http://www.dillards.com/webapp/wcs/store...    this dress would be really cute
cYXvA3N2aa	A couple things i do are    1) Spray hairspray on a brush and brush it through      your hair it will tame the fly a way's.    2) Take a dryer sheet and rub it on your hair.    3) Avoid touching your hair because that makes it worse.|`|iFYDJyIZaa	Run a dryer sheet over it. It works perfectly, I promise.|`|XXGF0hzYaa	right after you straighten it, comb hair gel into it smoothly and blow dry. if its still frizzy, put a dab more.|`|T7HLKcFLaa	The best way to get rid of static electricity is to 'ground' yourself. Take off your socks as these make static when you walk on carpet.     Hats also make static electricity by rubbing on your hair. Usually rubbing something magnetic on your hair takes the charge away, but I usually just dab water onto mine. Not a lot, just a tiny bit, because otherwise you'll ruin your styling :P|`|Zyfm8vnnaa	you can get cream for your hair|`|b9qRAcbIaa	i get this sometimes if ive straightened my hair!    i just get my hands a bit wet and run them quickly over my hair and wait for it to dry naturally :D|`|jSlW86WCaa	I found that when I stopped straightening and spraying my hair for a few days, it got a little greasier (eww, I know) but didn't go static the next time I tried to straighten it.|`|btghmpQhaa	Get something such as Garnier Fuctis or Aussie to stop your frizzies. It should stop.
26b83612da17ca075f14a62fb1753da2aa	hate herr.  she does like a million different types of drugs no which is why she's so freakin skinny. i'm gonna guess and say 00 or 0|`|zPFclJznaa	who cares?|`|Y0O6971laa	4.  Who cares though?  She's ugly as a troll.  Her and Robert are made for each other.|`|QNhyowIKaa	probably a three, or five|`|3LFqKLvyaa	Why does it matter. To tell you the truth, that is kinda weird to ask.|`|yQn34zO7aa	i think a 2 or a 3|`|XZHx3v4Raa	she not the super skinny 2 so i would say 3-5|`|sCoZm4wkaa	maybe a 0|`|vn739fgfaa	I would say a 3, shes about my size and that is what I wear.|`|aROel4yzaa	I'm thinking a 0.  But who cares? She is fugly.|`|3m4YrL8qaa	probably a 2.  I don't think she's pretty though...|`|wBN8e6QLaa	i'd say a 0 if not a little bigger|`|H17FtEgKaa	probably a 0-2 either one|`|9iphkDSTaa	I would say either a 0 or a 1.    BUT as others have mentioned.. who the eff cares?|`|NBf5q2f5aa	probably 0|`|dwmq9kKnaa	Shes amazing... iwould say a 0-3 shes so tiny    best actress EVER!|`|i38bP1PNaa	ithink she is a size 3|`|6juV48RWaa	i think its a zero. she looks so awkward! ugh|`|Hs19BCy9aa	like a 2 shes a awful actress in my opinion|`|ANW2G4pQaa	Maybe a 2|`|8D8ck9pVaa	I dunno  but even though i dont think she is Bella  im not jealous enough to say shes an 'ugly troll'  jealousy is such a pathetic quality to have.
RTPVAyIyaa	Wait.    Your a guy.    Question mark?|`|yo30g3pPaa	It won't stain. But I recomend black nail polish XD|`|HiuZs5G5aa	yea you can do it. just wash with soap it should come off. no it shouldn't stain your nails.   also why do you even want to do this?|`|tnkLQkhKaa	it's does come off|`|9dr0BZIbaa	If you really want your nails black, I would suggest painting your nails black and remove it with a standard nail polish remover over colouring your nails.|`|6jXuUCdraa	yeah, you can but it will stain your nails a light tint of yellow.  you can get it of by washing your hands multiple times with hot water. it will probably fade in less than a day. or you could just use nail polish remover.|`|ioLaD0O2aa	no it wont stain and yes it comes off easily, me and my friend did that today and it came off of her nails like right away|`|qYsZQianaa	wash your hands with soap and water after. Not that difficult.|`|jSlW86WCaa	It comes of your nails but stains the skin around them for a few days.  Just don't try it ;P|`|QNhyowIKaa	yeah, it comes off within the next day.  you can wash it off, or use alchocol to get it off.  but its not good for your nails, but I usually do it anyways... haha.|`|RFCcWPliaa	you could, but it wouldn't come off. ever. you'd have to wait for your nails to grow out. then they'd look really stupid and be half-black half-natural. just get cheap nail polish.|`|0fe649625e33ad80a6e3582e8d51f5d2aa	haha lol... my friend colors her nails w/ black sharpie, too. yepp.... no harm in doing it. and yes it will come off. you can use alchohol or nail polish remover, and it wont stain your nails...but remember try not to get it anywhere else other than ur nails cuz it can come off easliy on ur nails but it'll be a lil harder to take it off when its on ur skin... and one more easier way.... u can always buy black nail polish...|`|EwtCmQctaa	sharpie doesnt come off easily at all!  just use black nail varnish  colouring your nails in with pens looks groce :/

zX80VRbmaa	You should do it as follows: Start by sitting down is easier.    1. Gather the leg of the hose down to the toe portion.  2. Place your foot into the hose.  3. Roll/pull the hose up to your knee  4. Repeat steps 1 to 3 with the other leg.  5. Stand up and roll/pull the hose, one leg at a time, up the thigh, till the crotch/gusset portion is where it is supposed to be.  If the fit is not comfy, roll down the hose and start over again.   6. Finally pull the panty portion up to your waist, once the crotch is fitted nicely.     With some practice, you should be able to put a pair on within 1 min.  Important thing is to get the pantyhose in the correct size for your height and weight.  Height is crucial as the length of the hose will affect the fit.  You do not want a hose that is too short/long or too loose fitting.  Pantyhose should fit like second skin, such that you are not even aware that you are wearing them.      Works for me.     http://pantyhose-legwear-fashion.blogspo...|`|pWArTam4aa	No, putting on pantyhose shouldn't take that long... You roll the leg up until it's short enough to simply slide your foot it.  Then you start to unroll the leggings and pull them up to about your mid-thigh.  Then you repeat with the other leg.  Once both sides are up at your thighs, pull them up to your waist / hips and adjust them.  Good luck!|`|ovgxECKsaa	Are you buying the correct size pantyhose?  If they are too small, they will be difficult to get on.  Measure your hips, note your true height and weight.  Look at the size chart on the back of the packaging, this should tell you with accuracy what size you need to get.  Properly sized hose should take only slightly longer to put on than a pair on knee socks.|`|19a6bfdb0fbe9d31ebb8c9044a8ced20aa	Yes, there is a technique. While holding it with both hands, scrunch one leg of the pantyhose all the way down to the toe and slip your foot in. One your foot is in, all you have to do is unroll the leg material and you're set! Just repeat on both sides.
Dyn8oLVxaa	i do all the time. u dip ur ends in bleach and make them as whtie as possible. then i put red in the tips.
hnhb119Laa	Definitely take Tylenol before, and follow the care directions after,but just make sure you do it a few days before you want to show him... in case you are still sore.|`|YuPNVX9maa	when you get your brazilian, just take a couple painkillers, like aspirin or even something stronger.|`|mDt03eXIaa	The week before your period apparently hurts more.. your skin is more sensitive or something. And if you've never waxed before, it does hurt like crazy haha... A 'true' brazillian doesn't take everything off, they leave a little patch at the top, so you should decide if you want a triangle or landing strip or what (or if you want it completely bare). If you;re really scared to wax you could always just shave it, too. it has the same effect.
LrVzkhl4aa	do a regular ponytail in the middle but before putting the elastic in, sorta push your hand on your head around the ponytail ad sorta like shift the top part up..  or, when the elastic is in just pull some of it up at the top|`|fzAaPFelaa	The best thing to do is start from the top of your hair and section pieces going in the direction from ear to ear. Leave a section in the front alone, go by section and tease them, with a comb and some hair spray, then once your done, pull the section from the front back and smooth it out into a pony tail. It wont work the first time, you just have to play with it! Hope that helps.|`|vzVsP4bkaa	okay, so i think you mean like this, except a little bit less dramatic... right?    http://bryandowning.com/wp-content/uploa...    if that's what you are looking for, then straighten your hair first. then pull it into a ponytail in the middle of the back of your head. then pull down your bangs or any hairs on the sides of your head. pull them straight up... backcomb them and pin!|`|cZ7E8Vhnaa	what i do is take a piece on top and push it forward and then clip the  hair so it stays up and maybe spray it with some hairspray for support then just pull the rest of your hair to the back of your head at the height you want it and make sure the ponytail is tight|`|plGuYnNDaa	You have to have a lot of volume in your hair. Wash it upside down with cold water with a volumizing shampoo and blow dry it. And straighten it if you need to. Once its ready the pull it back loose and then tighten it. If its not poofy enough for you then you can back comb the roots just a little bit to add volume on the top. Its also good to use a clip, it looks diffeent but gives the same idea.. hope this helps :):)|`|okH04Nhlaa	Hairspray sweetie|`|KlpYEkaqaa	tease your hair, take a comb, and take the part of hair that you want to be puffy and comb it backwards in a fast motion :]  hope this helps!|`|NSuilHx1aa	buy a wig|`|Helbseg6aa	Ha ha. Okay..once your ponytail is in the place you want it..  You part your ponytail horizontally, get the bottom half..part that vertically..  then you'll have 2 pieces of the bottom half of your ponytail.  You pull those apart..which pumps the top up.  It wouldn't hurt to tease the top before you put it up either.  Hope this helps,(:|`|VbCs0vGjaa	Check out the video link below.  Good demonstration    Use grips to hold it in place, and maybe hairspray)  Push it forward to make it higher(see the video)|`|qi7N1ouoaa	git a friend 2 help ya out.|`|fkhNtMl1aa	haha i was wondering this SAME exact thing!!  here's a great tutorial i found on youtube.

She really has some good tips and is great at explaining it while she's doing it. she also has great videos on other hair stuff too.   enjoy!! and good luck!!  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjOVA1Pjy...
e1434520b7d6b7db2b483084c9ad434aaa	There is a product called AG Re:coil that works well to enhance the curls.  When you style your hair you can try scrunching and then twirling individual curls around a finger. Also I would try blowdrying with a diffuser--that makes my hair a bit curlier.     Straightening the hair too much can cause it to lose its elasticity, thus making the hair limper and less curly. I bet if you cut back on the straightener and let the damaged stuff grow out, it would be curlier as well. :)    Some great curly care websites:  http://www.wikihow.com/Follow-the-Curly-...  http://www.ylcf.org/gotcurl/ (outdated product recs!)  http://www.naturallycurly.com/curltalk/  http://www.youtube.com/user/jessicurl  http://livecurlylivefree.com/home.htm    Hope this helps!|`|fyyzKKqpaa	Bobby pin it up in curls or ues curlers when it's wet. PUt curling gel/ mousse in to hold the curls.    http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|njhKtCTKaa	Your hair is gonna do what its gonna do, my hair is naturally curly, and when i say curly i mean curly, and its a nightmare sometimes.  But if you hair doesnt have alot of curl, or if its just kinda curly it isnt just gonna do it naturally, try wet rolling it, or maybe buying some curl boosting products, also try letting it air dry, dont use a blow dryer w/out a diffuser bc it tends to frizz curly or wavy hair and try using picks or combs, and not brushes.    Good luck ;)|`|r5oL56xCaa	get some of those really huge hair rollers, it makes really pretty curls, then put some mousse in it. adn a little hairspray.    i have the same issue
pZXdqXNQaa	ok i have 3 questions 4 you!  1) have you ever had colour on your hair before?  2)how dark is it now?  3)are you doing it yourself or a salon?    im a hairdresser trainee and will help but to tell you a way without damaging i need to know if its been colourd b4 an hw dark it is now!    yh you coluld juc bleach it out and then condition it alot but if you havent died you hair b4 theres no piont in damaging it like that!|`|RQiUz4adaa	You could try using a semi- permanent die, or make sure you use a die that is not hard on your hair, and make sure it comes with special conditioner to keep you hair healthy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
aoyVeq16aa	Well hopefully school is over for you for today.    I would rest and drink some tea and lots of water. Take an asprin for your head.    a heating bad will help for the chills and a cold wash cloth for the sweats.    If you feel sick in the morning, go to a doctor. You don't sound like you have the flu. Maybe just a bug or virus!      Feel better soon!|`|MIILkAR4aa	wow that's weird because that's the reason i didn't go to school today  take medicine and vitamin c|`|vMSzI5q4aa	maybe you are dehydrated, drink water and juices... but stay away from caffeine and candy sugars (for a little while at least!!)    then take a nap or somethin, stay home from school if it get's worse, but otherwise stay hydrated! Hot soup is always delish!!    Feel better =^_^=|`|UNV987Zoaa	lol ur not preg. but u prob hav the flu....or early symptoms...prob a bad case its on its way stay home from skool and go to the doctor|`|d9K5Utgdaa	u probably are sick   and wow big wow thnxs for not  doing wut ur not suppose to be doing|`|fPSIRTKiaa	could just be hormonal. at your age your hormones are changing and stabilizing, and can cause symptoms like this. if you are approaching the time of your period (it is good to keep a monthly record so you know when to expect it) this is more likely. for this you don;t ned to stay home from school.    since you don't have a fever, you are most probably not ill. keep an eye on your temperature. if your temperature changes, and you have a fever, you probably just have a virus of some kind. stay home from school tomorrow if you still feel sick.    if your temperature raises a little bit and you start to throw up, you might have food poisoning. if it is food poisoning you would know- you would throw up A LOT and have diarrhea. luckily this should only last for 12 hours. you should stay home from school and drink lots of water.    if there is no change in temperature it might also be a reaction to something you ate- food allergies often develop during adolescence. if it happens again keep a food diary and note what you ate and drank.     caffeine can also sometimes do this if you take too much, or other prescription medications such as adderall or ritalin.     if i were you i would drink a lot of water and see what happens. from what you described, it is not yet possible to tell what is bothering you. just wait it out and feel better!|`|JOJjZuREaa	all of the above perhaps|`|F57ep5jHaa	i think your perfectly fine, just something that if you feel too bad you should stay at home, but if your okay, it wouldn't be bad to go to school.|`|3d4cfee2d6c183eded131290f960d689aa	you might have a stomache flu  sounds like the symptonms. i just had it, and its going around like crazy at my school. if you dont feel better in the morning, id suggest staying at home for the day and resting. also, drink lots of fluids (water, juice, etc.)  i had something exactly like this, and many kids in my grade were sick with it and were at home.|`|16KUkMP0aa	I always get that when I have a cold. Might as well stay home, you don't wanna spread it. That's what I do (;
aoyVeq16aa	Sure you can.    Just wear panties when you do it!|`|XFRpiTAFaa	yea you can try them on. i tried one on there. But that just might be the one near me...|`|AA11159067	yes you are allowed to try the bathing suits on.
O0k4sieJaa	Brown is a good color! But for a girly girl pink purple would good too! But for a tomboy I think brown or blue... something like that! Which ever one you are it would nice to be diffrent and get a out of the blue color, that no one esle would think about getting. Try to get just people to know who u are! STAND OUT!! I got a pink. So you chose I just wanted to help!|`|pwC0bEmHaa	brown|`|5ofS2qQYaa	khaki works with more colors..    brown is just yuk    :)

mMvEEZ3oaa	it drys out your skin and tells your pores to create oil leading to more acne|`|FiEPUkiwaa	it actually dries out your skin even more, which leads to more oil production. which means more acne. maybe try cleansing your face in the morning and before you go to bed.   P.S.   what is the cleanser you use? lol|`|EL45UeUJaa	Im the same way about not getting pimples thing, since i don't have acne problems at all...but washing your face that many times really may damage, irritate and dry it out as well. I would say once in the morning, and at night at the most.|`|4769b530e02572d6a0c84645a6d398cfaa	You only need to do it twice a day, morning and night. Its okay to apply moisturizer, sunblock, & toners throughout the day but you dont need to wash it that much unless you live in a mine lol. Plus washing your face that much can dry your skin which will produce more oil which equals more acne...so that could be part of your problem. If you aboslutely need to wash your face that many times or else you'll go crazy you may have a certain type of OCD...|`|TRrTunqvaa	the more you cleanse, the more you wash away your bodys natural oils that it needs to prevent acne, so only wash once! and use a moisturizer. i like clean and clear dual action, because it has medicine in it.|`|700555eb20216ce9a45885ea0a5744ecaa	EVERBODY is different when it comes to your skin. Me personally I hardly ever wash my face because it takes away my oil in the pores leaving it open for dirt. When im in the shower i got the best results by using a wash clothe and water only 3 times a week. The other 4 days out of the week i use pure witch hazel on a cotton pad to cleanse my face. I am a male and i don't have to worry about makeup so i don't know if this will help you. I can say i am pimple free and my face looks amazing now.|`|nXNdjetCaa	ahh im not sure but it could dry out your face..and i think dry skin look worse then acne.|`|lIURL4Qkaa	It's okay, but actually over-washing your face can sometimes cause pimples and dry-ness, so try to stick to 1-2 a day.|`|Qvb3SEBhaa	it is bad, it can irritate your skin and make it really dry which can lead to breaking out even more.  It strips your skin's natural oils  stick with 2 times a day, once in the morning & once at night  doing it 3-4 times a day won't do that much, but make it worse|`|M8H5UYvVaa	i know how you feel i am very careful with my face, but i think that 3-4 times a day is a little bit much. it dries out your face so maybe you could wash it in the morning and night so it will stay clean but not dry out.
