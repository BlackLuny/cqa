20061229090103AAQ2UYW	Food & Drink;Non-Alcoholic Drinks	It's getting harder to find Diet Pesi with Lime in stores!  Why is this?  We love DPWL.?	My wife and I have been Diet Coke drinkers for years.  Then someone introduced me to DPWL.   I told my wife & she was skeptic, like me, at first.  I don't care for Diet Pepsi it has a strong after taste.  But the lime in the DP  took  that away.  We've been hooked ever since.  I have told everyone I know about Diet Pepsi With Lime.  (I was like a commercial.)  Then, every time we'd go to the store, they would be out.  First it was the 2 liter but we could still find the cans.  Now we can't hardly find even the cans.  Was this a seasonal trial thing.  I hope not!  This should have been marketed harder to compete with Coke.  My family has strong ties to Coke because my Grand Dad retired from  there.  Mentioning Pepsi was like a cuss word in our house.   I hope you don't make me go back to Coke.   I prefer Mt. Dew over Mello Yellow, Dr Pepper over Mr Pibb, ( before they went independent) but especially the Diet Pepsi With Lime over Diet Coke with or without Lime.

20090130200815AAKmSpa	Food & Drink;Cooking & Recipes	How do I make crude homemade vinegar for cleaning?	I've been trying to find information on how to make vinegar from the simplest possible ingredients. It's not intended for consumption, so it doesn't have to taste good or look clear; I use vinegar for most of my household cleaning, so I need a cheap, continuous, and eco-friendly supply. The more ingredients I can grow or gather the better.      I know I have to make alcohol first, so I guess my real question is: what is the simplest possible alcohol recipe?

20090130202401AAywOWI	Food & Drink;Vegetarian & Vegan	A question about vegetarianism?	I am moving toward becoming a complete vegetarian for philosophical and health reasons.  I'm comfortable with the decision, but there is one kind of oddball question that sticks in my mind: Most domestic animals owe their very existence, blighted though it may be, to the fact that people raise them for sale and consumption.  If we all became vegetarians, what would happen to these animals?  It's kind of a silly questions but I really wanted to hear some views on this.  Would they fade away unless they could adapt to life in the wild?  How many people would keep them as pets?  It's expensive.  I would miss the existence of sheep and pigs and calves and so on.  I can't imagine people in the US making way for cows in the cities as they do in India.  What do you think?
