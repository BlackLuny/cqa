20090227104042AASdH0k	Sports;Baseball	What's the deal with Bobby Abreu?	I'm a little puzzled by the lack of demand for Bobby Abreu during this off season. I realized he signed a 1 year $5 million dollar deal with the Angels, but it seems he should have been worth much more.  Just look at his resume;      He's shown great durability over the last 10 years by playing at least 150+ games each year for the last 10 years.   He reached 600+ AB's the last two years.   He's been right around 100 runs / 100 RBI's for the last 6 seasons.   He's averaged 20 HR / 20 SB over that last 6 seasons.   He's a career .300 hitter      So with the all of the accolades of being healthy, consistent, and very productive on the base paths it makes me wonder why more teams weren't going after him. Phillies were quick to trade him and Yankees weren't willing to resign him (cheap). So what wrong with this guy?

I can cluster my shots with good consistency at around 40-50 yards. I've never tried farther than that though, as none of the ranges around here are any larger than that. I was wondering if I'd be ok to go bow hunting though...I mean, how close do most people usually let their target get before even considering a shot? Thanks for any input.

20090227104944AAIioZW	Sports;Football (American)	I believe in the Detroit Lions?	i seriously do. I think they actually have potential to b a good team possibly great over the next few years. Next year, assuming they get Stafford i actually c them going 9-7 at best. Remember 2 years ago they were almost 10-6. BTW they were in almost every game this year. They will tie u and now that i think they have QB that can win the game, then mayb they can pull it off. Of course they're going to have to make a few moves in free agency but they don't have that far to go. Do not b surprised if Marvin Harrison actually decides to go to Detroit. He can help groom Calvin Johnson into becoming the great player he has potential to b. The only real problem i c with the lions is their TE, they can get one in the 2nd round mayb the first round if they don't go o-line at #20. CB which can definitely b addressed in FA. of course the O-line which can b fixed in the draft with some good picks. and the D-line which can b fixed in Free Agency. they actually remind me of the Cardinals a few years ago when they passed Ben Roethlisberger for Larry Fitzgerald. Lions passed on Quinn (probably a bust anyway) for Calvin Johnson. I'm not calling them the next cards but they have potential to do it. I don't think their safeties are terrible they jus had no support from the cornerbacks. Who's with me that 2-3 years from now the lions will b considered a pretty good wildcard team

If this guy joined LA you would all be singing his praises, hes still better than Fisher. The reason for the hate is the LA fans are scaredm and they should be. Point is there is no risk with the Marbury move, maybe it works out maybe it doesn't, but the LA fans are just scared of what a veteran point guard with skill (Not Cassel) can bring to the Celtics.

Well I was unable to attend last nights game. This is the first game I have missed in three seasons. The reason : Some under qualified construction crew was "trying " to install a new light pole up the street from my house. They ruptured a gas line which was then hit by a broken live wire. So . I had to park my car at a neighbors house a few blocks away and walk home after work. Them I was told I was not allowed to leave for my game. As the gas main has now three fires burning and everyone has to stay put. So very P O about missing my game.    So question: Have you ever missed a game , whether playing in or going to watch , because of a disaster of some kind? Hurricane, flood, train wreck etc? Just curious here .

You gotta love Max Kellerman for not only the boxing knowledge he knows but also the way he speaks his mind, it's comes straight from his heart.  I love the way Kellerman always tells it the way it is and holds nothing back no matter what anybody thinks.      For example a couple of weeks ago when J.M.Marquez fought Juan Diaz I recall hearing Max Kellerman say how the real hardcore boxing fans had J.M.Marquez winning both fights against Pacquiao and how J.M.Marquez has fought the tougher opponents in both Casamayor and Diaz unlike Pacquiao who has been fighting easy fights like David Diaz and a past his prime Oscar De La Hoya.  I mean you gotta love the truth coming from Max Kellerman at least I do anybody else feel him or what?      I know I am probably going to get a lot of hate comments since there are too many Pacquiao fans out there who know nothing about boxing.  Pacquiao fans know Pacman and that's it so please if your going to respond to my question make some comman sense by backing your answer with reasonable points not some stupid insulting words which you Pacquiao fans tend to do all the time (LOL)

20090309211637AAHRKaG	Sports;Cycling	10 Speed Schwinn Varsity?	I bought a vintage Schwinn road bike (I believe it's a varsity) and I want to do some maintenance on it. Foolishly I oiled it up with 3in1 oil which I heard is vegetable oil based and just gunked it up, besides the fact that I think I over oiled the chain. Not only that but I have been riding it in the city which includes rain, mud, snow, dirt, and pretty much all the other good stuff found in a grimy road.      So I have a few questions (hopefully you are patient!):      The chain is old and worn; can I repair the chain? I know I have to pop a rivet out, does this mean if I take it off it is junk, or can I put another rivet in? Would I just be better off getting a new chain?

20090309213723AA0vR0m	Sports;Wrestling	WWE Fake/Real Feelings(10 Points for a Good One)?	Ok, this is a question where it's not really a question. Just tell me what you think about WWE being Fake or Real and if it's scrippted.   This is what I feel:      Yes most of WWE is scripted, like the cutscenes with Randy Orton and Triple HHH, and Vikkie,BigShow,Edge, and John Cena. This I understand. Most likely that wasn't Randy's real house tonight, but, they both did get hurt. You may say most of it is fake, but is Getting thrown into a Shelf fake? Is Being Thrown into a Lamp and breaking it fake? Is being thrown at a Wall fake? And most of all, is being thrown through a Window fake? Yeah maybe he was perpared for it, but seriously, he was hurt and we can all see that. Just because he got up to complain to the cops doesn't mean he wasn't hurting. And like all these other matches. John Cena lifts up BigShow two SmackDowns ago and F-U's him. You could clearly see BigShow was slamed into the ring, and he wasn't prepared for it. The point is the winner of the match is pre-dettermined, but what actually happens in the match isn't.They just make sure the right person wins. When someone jumps from the Turnbuckle and lands on the other opponent, thats not fake. I mean your landing on your opponent and there crashing to the mat. I'm just saying the cutscenes are fake, but the fighting isn't. These people really do get hurt and people don't understand that. They think that they all go over the fight that there gonna do and learn everything they should do like doing rehearsels for a play. They learn who is going to win, and go and fight for real. And ayway's, no one can say that they haven't heard a slap or punch against someone, and then you see big red marks. Just another way to prove it's not all fake.   So to explain what I've said really quick, Scenes are Scrripted, Winners are Pre-Ditermied, But what happens in that ring, nobody knows.

I myself think that if Gio can keep the form he is in and starts getting more playing time he might just beat Vela and get the first goal in... but then again if Vela starts going in earlier in the games instead of the last 20-15 mins it will be vela... so you guys think of it really well and lets have good answers

20090310011444AACtrzk	Sports;Cricket	What is special about the cricket Sorority?	How exactly is this section different from the other sections? Recently I have been watching with a sense of depression users leaving the section.. sometimes on their own, sometimes enforced.  Users like Vassarama, Astrex, Roger, Kate, Angeâ€¦ the list is getting alarmingly long: Yesterday I heard MBTMâ€™s account has been suspended: even users like Mitch, Julia, Rehman, Predator etc are infrequent.   I have been to other sections but found them either like a gloomy cemetery or like the Victoria Terminus in Mumbai or the Grand Central.. nobody knows anybody.. â€¦everybody moving in circles.., too busy in answering qs that they donâ€™t have any time for personal inter actions or things  like that. But the cricket section is like a small village Railway Station where the passengers know each other, they share a cup of tea or a cigarette together, the boys and girls know each otherâ€¦â€¦ the occasional winks, the bohemia , the fights, the argumentsâ€¦.everything is here.   What can we do to keep this romantic character of the section?   A cricket q to go along with this: How many of the cricket section users are 40+ and how many 40-? I come in the former group.   And, to those who are itching to report this: please go ahead; two things could happen: either my account will withstand one more notice or it could get suspended: either one suits me. My right to express myself is more important to me than the tag of TC or the 8000 odd points.

I am considered a middle weight in the 15-17 yr old division. (150-169.9 lbs). My instructor said I should just say I'm 14 yrs old and fight in the 14 yrs old & under diviosion which is 130 lbs - 179.9 lbs. Thing is, isn't that kind of cheating? My other instructor says that he would rather fight at his own division and lose then fight at a division that you know you would win... but then told me it's ultimately up to me. Now they all hyped me up saying how I would win the gold and even offered to pay for me if I couldn't afford it... They say all these compliments to me like they don't see anybody beating me and all this. But all of these compliments are making me really nervous like I HAVE to win. :( Now if I compete in the 14 & under divious the possibility of me winning 1st place is likely. But if I do the 15- 17 yr old 150-169.9 lbs divious, I probably won't win. I mean what are the chance of me against a 17 yr old male who weighs 169 lbs?? How does that look for anyone who's done it??? What are my chances?      What should I do please help? :(

20090227121155AAc5Rwc	Sports;Golf	Help i think my scout masters a peedo!!!?	Hi, I'm abby, and I'm 14. I go to my local scout group in south Manchester most wednesday evenings and recently my Scout master has been acting so suspicious. We started talking about sex and relationships as part of our new enterprise and he had an erection, definatley but I thought hey, men get these regularly through the day and they can't always help it so I thought nothing of it. The next week  we were having a similar discusion about lesbian relationships and he had it again. So after about 5 minutes when we had a juice break my friend jamelia went into the store cupboard to get a basketball and when she entered he had his hand down his trousers and quickly whipped it out and shouted at her (I mean really shouted) to get out. So she went into the kitchen and about 2minutes later he came through  and apologized and said he just had things on his mind. Then he closed the door and looked her up and down and asked if her if she wanted to do anything for him or if he could do anything for her she said no quickly and walked out really fast she didn't know what to do, he asked me later that evening ifi wanted to do anything for him aswel!! He's never acted like this before and I've been going to scouts for over a year! Help!!    xxxxx

20090227141621AACrbzs	Sports;Winter Sports;Ice Skating	Knee pain from small jumps... exercises for stronger knees?	Hi All :)   I am taking adult learn to skate lessons and just started FS1 small jumps (waltz, half-flip). Lately my 30-minute exercises began to give me slight knee pains. Resting overnight does heal it but I am really afraid of developing bad knees.    As a teen I once had knee problems from jogging, which means for 2 years, simple 30 minutes of running or fast skating will bring about knee pains. I have recovered since then, but really don't want to get back to any kind of knee problem again.   I seriously love skating and would hope to pursue freestyle as long as I could. I am in mid-20s and I do wear elbow, knee pads and compression shorts for protection :)   Do you have any recommendations on building strong knees?    What warning signs should I watch for while skating freestyle?

It worked awesome for applying my cue tips. Got it at a auto store. Can't find it now and I tried installing a talisman tip on my players cue today with gorilla glue. But twice the tip came off. I have some cheap glue that cam with some tips from wal mart. I used it and surprising it did better than the G glue. But it also came off after a game. I let it set for 2 hours. I re did it again with the little white glue from wal mart and I am letting it set over night. I seen a glue online called tweedens. Also see one that says sets in 5 to 15 secomds and u can then jump right back into shooting pool.  So what's the best glue to use? I wanna be able to use some english,with a little power sometimes without the worry of my tip falling off. Thanks
