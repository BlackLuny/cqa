20090220135025AAmQN6G	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	80% of jobs being lost during the recession are held by men! Are feminists elated?	According to CNN, 80% of the people that have lost their jobs during the recession have been men. As a result, many men in relationships that have lost their jobs are now stay-at-home-dads (while looking for work) while the girlfriend/wife is the breadwinner.      Is this circumstance a feminist's dream come true?      Your thoughts.

He accused me Of cheating when i wasn’t.. he didn’t contact me till 2months and i told him 2 call me bk cos i was out.. he called me back and asked about my BF and said i don’t know. and he said hes not tryna get into my knickers he was just ring to see how i was doing and that hes got a girl and hes happy and that we can still be friends. I asked him why he didn’t contact me after we made up after the argument and he said i didn’t ring him and i wasn’t expecting him 2 do the same thing so obviously i know what that means. He said when he called me earlier i was with a guy and i could’ve told him instead. But I wasn’t with a guy. He then told me to look after myself and hanged up. Am soo heart broken it hurts so much.. Why did he have 2 come bk and finish me off telling me he’s got a girl.. i was finally moving on. I was loyal 2 this guy i never ever even looked at other guy when we were together.. Why did he treat me this way? What did i ever to him 4 him to be soo cruel. Am back to the broken heart again i was finally picking up myself and now he’s ruined it all 4 me all over again.
20090220134930AAmhT6c	Social Science;Psychology	How do I accept that fact that I am a horrible person and it will never change?	I've been called ugly by kids since I started kindergarten (now in 9th grade). I've lived in three different cities for school (one for elementary, one for middle and one for high). No matter what, I'm always made fun because of something about me. Even kids who didn't know me called me names. I remember a girl who used to call me ugly and dirty (I think because of my brown skin color) every time she saw me.      I did have friends in the first city I lived in, but when I started to get close to them, I moved away to another city (second). In the second city, the same thing happened: I made friends, but just when i started to get close to them, I moved away. Right now, I have no friends. I don't even remember how I made any of my friends.      My family isn't happy with the way I look or what I like.They hate my short hair (which I wish was much longer) and hate my taste in clothes (especially my mom). One of my grandmothers hates my love of the Disney Princesses (she thinks it's immature because I'm 14 and soon to be 15). She says I will never have pretty hair because I have artificial hair sewn in my head. My father wants nothing to do with me (deadbeat) and she says he's still a wonderful man, even when he plans to move to Pennsylvania (he says it's because he'll make more money. I think it's to avoid me and my mom). She and my father talk trash about my mom behind my back, thinking I don't know.      My mother also used to beat me with a belt when I misbehaved when I was younger, but she denies it, saying she never hit me. I know she did it. I completely remember every time she beat me (It really served no purpose. I always forgot what I did wrong in a few hours after the beating and just repeated it).      To put it simply, I hate myself. Obviously, something is wrong with me.

I need to use 4 television show episodes to illustrate traditional gender roles and non traditional gender roles (need two shows/episodes for each). Can anyone offer me any quick advice on which shows I might watch?        Additional info: Traditional gender roles would be boys doing "manly" things and girls doing "girly" things.  Non-traditional gender roles would be reversed.

This past week has pushed it to the limit though and my mom is talking about trying to put me on antidepressants. She doesn't trust me to go out with anyone anymore because I was sneaking around and talking to my ex-boyfriend whom she despises. I don't know what to do anymore, or how to become happy. I know I need to see a therapist - so don't tell me that. I'm just wondering what I can do to stop feeling like this, even just for tonight. I can't leave the house but it feels as if there's a dark cloud above me that follows me everywhere. Any suggestions?
20090220140009AAwsmyw	Social Science;Economics	Question about microeconomics...?	In long-run equilibium, all firms in the industry earn zero economic profit. Why is this true? All firms in perfectly competitive industries earn zero economic profic in the long run because:      a. barriers to entry and exit prevent firms from earning positive or negative economic profit.   b. if profit were positive, then firms would produce more, increasing price, and if profit were negative, then firms would produce less, dcreasind price.   c. firms are price takers, maximizing profit by producing where price equals averge cost.   d. if profit were positive, then firms would enter, decreasing price, and if profit were negative, then firms would exit, increasing price.   e. firms are price takers, maximizing profit by producing where price equals marginal cost.

20090220141217AAZGHe9	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Whats it mean when u have dreams that peoples eyes are turn blue?? people that u miss.... ?	well, i had a dream after my dog was killed that i was in the kitchen and she kept following me and then i was kinda freaked cuz she was a ghost but at the same time i wasnt afraid and i was accepting of her and then i turned around and i had a moment with her looking her right in the eyes, and they turned blue.          this was exactly a year ago.       i left this skool yesterday that i liked this guy at.    well i liked this guy like crazy big time a lot,    so, in the dream i met up w/an old friend, and i had a whole bag of different kinds of alcohol and i was goin nuts with it havin fun w/my old buddy, and i looked across the room to that boy i liked.. or like.. i dunno, and then when i looked, his eyes were blue. his eyes are brown. dark brown. and yes he is full of sh!!t. no im jk but anyways, his eyes were blue, like hers in the dream, and i remember thinkin in the dream- "maybe he ran outta his normal contacts or something or has blue contacts now.."      whats this mean when i have these dreams?? does it mean i miss them, or does it mean that i have some kinda problem w/them or WHAT, i mean is it me or is it a meaningful dream..??
20090220142152AAJkleo	Social Science;Psychology	Why doesn't people care about the environment...?	*********YOU WILL FIND THIS INTERESTING, I CAN ASSURE YOU:         It's so irritating, and it just drives me so insane that people don't care about what is happening. I mean, we're using up SO much coal and SO much oil, that at the end of 2010, we'll probably won't have anymore...   There are so many caring people out in the world, but don't get enough confidence to go up and talk about the life. I mean, people who believe God in different ways (religious perspectives), it just doesn't make sense. We were given this world specially for us in our solar system to treat it with respect, and not misuse the good things for bad. Like knives is for cooking, not for killing. I want to save this world, but people think "Well I'm not going to be alive when it ends, so I can't be bothered." We have kids who will have kids, and so on, so basically it will be our family that's been destroyed...   I just want the world to know that sometimes we need to care for our world. I mean, now, if you think about it, I just wish some electricity didn't get invented. Look at us; Credit crunch is hitting us and we can literally visually see that. So many shops closed down! And we have taxes, why? The use of electricity.      I mean, you think about it, we're criminals.. we really are... we're killing our planet. Why do people drive, and not walk to a 5 minute store? Why don't people turn off pointless electrical equipment, that we really don't need to use at the time? I hate it, and I have something to say about it. One of my to-do lists before I die, is to make a speech, maybe the whole world won't listen, but in public, so everyone could hear, so they could bring those camera's, and use them for something actually neccersary. Why are people so caring being the one fooled? There ARE nice people out there..      So if you think about it. We're all criminals. We can't all hurt my opinons, because they are NOT opinons ... they are facts - simple facts. I care about this world, and if people don't, what's the point in living if everyone knows our family will die? There's been one big bang, there's no reason for it to happen again. Everything happens more than once, then ends:    We have oil, more comes, but it will end.   We have coal, more comes, but it will end too.   We have the big bang, more will come, but it will end eventually, maybe later than sooner if we do something.      So get up from your seat now, and this is a command, not an option, and turn off a light (just ONE light) that you don't think is needed. I am telling you, more people who do it, it will REALLY help.            I want to save the world. So ask yourself a question, but answer it later, when you don't realise you actually answered yourself a question: Are you a criminal?      I mean, Are you killing our world? We make a team to kill the world, how about we make a team to save the world?         Thank you.

20090220142612AAvXURt	Social Science;Psychology	Is my life over? Do I have a future?	I have no life. I'm stuck in this neighborhood that might as well be a ghetto. I envy the hooligan across the street and his drug addict mother because they at least have a life.   I can't drive because of my anxiety. I have Asperger's Syndrome and OCD which I had to take medication for.    I also have acid reflux now and have to take Zantac twice a day. I am not taking my Zoloft and Risperdal because I do not want to take four medications a day. The only time when it is okay and normal to take four pills a day is when you're old or dying. I'm 20 years old despite living the life of an overprotected 12-year-old and feeling as jaded as a middle aged person. It's pathetic how the average 12-year-old could run circles around me socially.   I have a feeling that I'm going to be alone, unemployed and living with my parents for the rest of their lives. My parents will think that I'm a bigger failure and disappointment than they already do. I can't even keep a minimum wage job as I'm socially dense and my anxiety shakes me up to the point where I can't even concentrate on the simplest things.    I can't transfer to a school in a stimulating city because I have a crappy 2.8 GPA and my parents are too busy paying for the tuition of my sister's prestigious college. I'm not good at anything that will help me make money and have a lucrative career. I fail at math and science. Nothing I'm good at counts for anything.   I can't talk to my school counselor because they are only watchdogs who make sure that everyone that visits them is not the next Cho Seung Hui from Virginia Tech. When I told them about my intrusive, disturbing thoughts last summer, they shipped me off to the mental hospital where I ended up for over six hours. I was too scared to call my parents. I feared that they would either get mad at me or cry. I've never seen my mom cry before and I did not want this to be the first time.   My parents found out and all hell broke lose. After an agonizing search for a professional, we found a psychiatrist because the psychiatrist was the first person to take our insurance AND be able to write a letter to the school saying that I'm fine.   I'm tired of this crap. When is the next time I'm going to get hospitalized? I remember being forced to see a psychiatrist when I got into a fight in high school. What am I going to get diagnosed with next? Even my mother said I have caused problems since day one because I stopped talking at 18-months-old and did not speak again because of autism, how I was forced to go to a special ed.school throughout elementary school.   My mind is garbage and hell. I'm stuck in this bland, stifling town where the only stimulation is the fist fights that happen sometimes and how the thugs are so professional and advanced that they could dodge the cops minutes before they show up and never get arrested for their drugs and mini-riots when they do.   Sometimes I feel I'm too good for this, yet I feel that I deserve this and this is my place in the world. Is there anyway I can escape my situation?

It really didn't have much of a storyline, but one part stood out.  There was a red-headed man in my bathroom.  He moved the toilet set apparently facing the doorway in the middle.

20090220142927AAKii4o	Social Science;Economics	Few Economics Questions (macroeconomics)?	1) When bank notes were first invented, they were    a) a liability to the bearer.    b) an asset to the issuer.    c) convertible to gold on demand.    d) not convertible to any commodity.   I think it's either a or b.      2) Assets: Reserves $100, Loans $600; Total $700       Liabilities: Deposits $400, Net Worth $300; Total $700      The above info gives the initial balance sheet for Mini Bank. Mini Bank's balance sheet is such that it will make    a) no change in its lending.    b) you cannot predict what the bank will do from this balance sheet.    c) more loans.    d) fewer loans.   Since the assets are = to liabilities, I don't think there should be a change in its lending.      3) In the money market, if the interest rate exceeds the equilibrium interest, there is a surplus of money. How is the surplus eliminated?    a) The high interest rate increases the demand for money, eliminating the surplus.    b) People buy bonds to rid themselves of the surplus money, bidding up their price and pushing interest rates down.    c) The Federal Reserve will destroy currency, reducing the quantity of money.    d) Banks will lend out the surplus, lowering interest rates.   I think the answer might be d here.      -Thanks for any help.

This was a very very vivid dream to me and when I woke up I actually thought I had the same dream in two nights when I did'nt       Ok, it started with my sister and her husband at a store, I don't know why but there was a very small wheelchair and I seen a very small old man trying to get on it but he could'nt sit on it right so I helped him get on it then all of a sudden he disapeared. I did'nt think much of it then but then I seen a little boy walking past me and suddenly he disapeared. I was freaking out so they took me home but it was a home i've never been to and there was some of my family there, Anyways, I was calm at first but then I started seeing things like a line of small stuffed animals on the floor going outside and I freaked out, then I don't remember how many dead people i've seen but they were dead and I was the only one who could see them... I was terrified and I wanted them to stop!!! there was this little chinese girl that walked over and sat right infron tof my mother who was sitting down, then my eyes got big and I freaked out again and my sister grabbed her even though she could'nt see her and started hitting and slapping her and I yelled out "STOPP RIGHT NOW!!!" because she was crying and then whenever I seen a dead person appear, I would go crazy and yell and go into a ball, I mean I was scared.. and when I did ask them why they're here, all they could say is "Because I care" and I felt like I was schitzophrenic because no one was seeing what I was seeing and I was the only one going crazy and crying and yelling... I was alert and when I started looking in one direction for awhile, i'd go over there and either see a dead person and freak out, or freak out because they left a trail of something... and in my dream, I woke up from a dream and I was in my old house and I asked my mom if I was yelling in my sleep... and she said yes I said 'what are you doing here" in a low voice" then all of a sudden my sis and her husband comes through the door and there's another dead guy!!!!!!!!!! so I ran out to the car thinking of schitzophrenic and there were more dead people watching me       then I woke up       the dead people were'nt like zzombies or anything, they were regular people and there were ALOT of them... I am seriously afraid to move or look around :(       please help me with an explaination?
20090220144238AAY3ivc	Social Science;Psychology	Really messed up school presentation...crappy feeling?	I feel so bad, stupid, and embarrassed...we had a presentation today in spanish class where we would be recorded.  I was already nervous enough, but then the way the teacher picked who would go up first was to draw a name out of a hat.        With my luck it was, of course, me.  I completely panicked and was already tired and I forgot EVERYTHING I was going to say...I had a really good presentation planned out, too.      And to make everything worse, this presentation was worth 25 points out of a big project that would count as 3/4 of this quarter's grade...I was literally up there for like 20 seconds, and I think I would be lucky if I got 1 point.      All day I have been feeling so crappy and upset.  How can I make this go away?

I've always been a little shy, but over the past few years it's gotten to the point where I have almost no friends, and talk to almost no one at school.      I'm currently a Junior in Highschool, and I really want to be more outgoing and social and meet new friends, but I just... can't.   I never know what to say to people and I suck at small talk and even just looking people in the eyes.   I guess I have low self confidence.      How can I raise my self confidence and be less shy?

20090220150655AAs52Q7	Social Science;Psychology	How can I reveal my true self.?	First off, let me explain why this is so hard for me to do. I am a 22 y/o College Grad with a decent job and pretty much all the necessities in life (except a car), however I don't have a single person I could call a friend. I am a compulsive liar, and suffer from social anxiety disorder. With this colminates into is that I have a bunch of aquaintences but no one to confide in or share a more than surface level relationship with.       Everytime I meet someone new, I start this vicious circle of lies that result in me keeping them at face value out of fear that they'll find out the truth about me and look at me like some kind of evil freak of nature. I know it maybe hard to believe but it happens so naturally that even though I know it's wrong I do it anyway.       Simply my goal is to be confortable with who I am enough to not find it necessary to lie when meeting someone new, and to be able to reveal who I really am to the people I already know without them treating me like an outcast. I know it's a lofty goal and no single answer on this site is going to give me a complete life altering answer, but if anyone can at least offer any recondmendations it would be greatly appreciated.       (and no, god is not the answer i'm looking for. I talk to myself enough as it is).

20090220151554AAYIBh3	Social Science;Economics	Supply and Demand Question?	This question comes directly out of my book:      With current technology, suppose the profit-maximizing or loss-minimizing relationship between total revenue and total cost in producing product Z occurs when a firm's output is 400 units.  And realize that the lease-cost combo. of resources in producing 400 units of output of Z is 5 units of labor, 7 of land, 2 of capital and 1 of entrepreneurial ability, selling its prices at $20, 40, 60, 60 and 20 dollars.      If the firm can sell these 400 units at $2 per unit, will the firm continue to produce Z? Expanding or declining industry?

20090203042105AA6KmP6	Social Science;Psychology	I feel suicidal when I work.?	I try not to take on responsibilities. I don't like communicating with other people, but at the same time feel depressed when I don't. When I work I feel fine for the first couple of weeks, but after I little while I just wanna off myself even when I'm studying. I had to quit work because I hated every second of it although I only worked once a week. When I work or study I feel like everything is pointless. I also had to quit my studies for a half year course within 1 month. I have no idea what I want to to with my life as a career and feel most comfortable when I am by myself doing nothing. The people around me tell me that I'm going to get sick if I keep staying home doing nothing instead of working when I feel the complete opposite. I didn't feel like this when I was at school, but I didn't try very hard at school cos I thought it was also pointless. Sometimes I think I can't breath when I think about the future or about what I'm going to have to do so I try not to think about it. What the fk is wrong with me?
20090220154017AAVyLZF	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Drunken sex and date rape?	With date rape, the rapist is generally someone who knows that his or her victim would not consent to sex under any ordinary circumstance.  So, they arrange to get their victim extremely inebriated to the point that they have little or no control over their actions, and only then have sex with them.      Is there a relevant difference between this situation and someone trying to get someone else hammered with alcohol and then trying to have sex with them?      --      To de-abstract the problem: suppose there's a hot guy who's a committed virgin, perhaps by his religion, or perhaps for other extremely personally important commitment ("I won't have sex until my murdered grandfather has been brought to justice," or some other direly important commitment).      A woman is extremely infatuated by him and wants to have sex with him, understands his insistence on virginity, but unethically wants to try anyway.  She takes him to a bar for his 21st birthday, and buys him drink after drink, pressuring him to drink each one even after he's obviously past what's healthy.  Finally, when he's so drunk he's slipping in and out of consciousness, she takes him home, and persuades him rather easily to have sex.  When he wakes up, he's horrified, violated, humiliated, furious, and all other sorts of reasonable things.      Has she raped him?  Why or why not?

WELL thats all i had to say and Kate started bawling. and of course i looked like a bit*h and the only 2 people who saw things from my perspective, Abby and Karen were not in my next class. i was literally all alone and i got pulled out of class and so did Kate and we got talked to. it was the worst. we both apologized. i didnt mean it then, i did apologize months later and i meant it then.      **************************************...      later on me and Kate started talking and really became friends we talked every day over the summer but lately i dont know why but i really dont like her too much any more. i really dont know how to explain it. i just dont like her. i get bad vibes off her. its really hard to explain how i feel.      i dnt no wat to do anymore.      btw the part in between the ** are just a back story of me and kate lol.

Well, this is longgggggggggggggg!!!!! anyways, it starts off on the news they say it is a zombie attack and everyone should run for cover and hid and try to survive it. Well, i am with my family who is just oblivious to that idea and go about life as they usually do, especially when the city is on shut down. Then, i look out the window and see pitch black and zombies approaching. but where i live the house just illuminates the entire neighborhood with our lights and causes the zombies to attack us. But, i grab a random shot gun riffle, canned food, blankets and such and head into a place of protection, especially after thinking about it clearly. Then we shot off all the power in the house and we hide out. then we are attached and they beat down the door and i awoke. then the next night, the same thing happened, but instead, i'm doing something different, everyone change up the roles every time or something else. what does this mean.

20090220161609AAyjMlm	Social Science;Economics	Economics Confusion :(?	The Perez Lumber Company sells boards in a perfectly competitive market. The current marginal cost of boards at the current output of 445 board feet per month is $3.57 per board foot. The price of lumber is currently $3.57 per board foot, and the minimum possible average variable cost of producing lumber is $3.88 per board foot. If the firm wants to maximize profit(or minimize losses), it should      (a)   increase monthly output above 445 board feet.   (b)   shut down immediately.   (c)   decrease monthly output to 200 board feet.   (d)   continue producing at its current output level.      I'm not sure about the answer to this question because if the MC<AVC, shouldn't the company increase the number of boards they output, because with increasing the number of boards it would put the equilibrium point above the AVC curve and the AC. That's my reasoning behind it but I have no idea if I'm on the right track. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks :)

20090220164511AAsIzUJ	Social Science;Economics	Question for Economists:?	Take the scene in the latest batman movie where the Joker takes a GIANT pyramid of US cash dollars and just burned it.  Lets say for arguments sake some madman (cough stanford cough) does it repeatedly to the tune of a trillion dollars.  What would that do to the US economy since everyone makes such a big deal moaning about how printing more will just increase inflation because we all know no one is stupid enough to just destroy the sacred american dollar for no good reason.  and there is no accounting for this money because some firm is supposed to 'have it' but in reality it is up in smoke?  I hope you understand my question.

20081110140007AAqbI0M	Social Science;Psychology	I hate my life so bad, and it won't get better...?	Everyday I am always sad or angry. I hate the way I look. I hate my skin tone. I hate my nose. I hate my freckles. I hate my pale skin. I hate my puffy eyes. I had feeling uncomfortable in my own skin 24/7, and I hate my voice.      It's easy to say "Let me embrace what God gave me." but when you see so many people who are much better looking than you are, more athletic, and more intelligent, you lose hope (Which is what has happened to me). I don't want to live anymore, because each day brings anger and sadness. I can't stop it no matter what I do, because I will always hate who I am and what I look like.      I wouldn't classify this as a question, just a topic so I can garner help. Therapy didn't work, and I don't want to live anymore...

20090220151836AAWdbJ0	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	VERY scary nightmares! Any interpretations?	I have had these 2 nightmares both involving animals.      First one is I am in some sort of building with corridors with lots of glass paneled doors. There is lion and 2 black panthers that are following me down these corridors and I am closing the glass doors to stop them but they keep managing to get through and the point when I wake up (which is really suddenly like I sit right up in bed completely terrified) is when the lion is coming closer and closer to me and there are no more doors to stop him.      The 2nd one is I am in my bedroom and there is a pigeon in my room on the floor, the next thing it is on my bed on top of me. I can smell how dirty it is and the moment when i wake up is when the pigeon is on my face about to start pecking me. I woke up screaming and waving my arms around my face.       Can anyone suggest anything? i do have an intense fear of pigeons and sea gulls but I am unsure about the significance of the lion and black panthers?
20090220141902AAuGHi9	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Ladies, do you think she may like me?	There is a girl i met in my Ecology class. Before class before her friends showed up we just started talking to each other. We started talking about the class, about tests in general. I dont even remember how it came up but we ended up talking about my Sister.       I know at this stage we are just friends but do you think there is a chance she may be interested in me? From what i just told you is it possible to tell if she has a boyfriend?       The first conversation we had was about the weather. It was so hot. I was not expecting the weather to be like it was, and she noticied i was not wearing a shirt underneathe my hoody. She kind of laughed when she said this. I said i wish i was.         I noticed that during this conversation on wednesday she was smiling a little bit at me when we were talking.    Today i talked to her some more but not nearly as much as i would have liked. When she saw me she smiled at me. After class we went our own way.

The clearing was infested with red moustraps! I woke up my friends, and it started to snow. We tried to run home, but many of my friends were collapsing in the snow. I picked some up, and all around me I heard people screaming that we needed to keep going. It was strange because the sleepover we were having only consisted of about 5 people. Please tell me what this means!

20090220140728AA0wZIj	Social Science;Psychology	Can you have a bad/damaged brain but a good mind?	The reason i ask this, is because there are actually people with intelligent brains but bad minds etc... Arrogance,Greed,Immature      So in my opinion, it all has to do with the mind, i mean the Brain can't determine what your character is going to be right? There are smart people with damaged brains, so it means they had a good mind. Maybe this all has to do with the Law of Attraction too.   What are your thoughts?

20090220131104AAw74nP	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Help seeing if theres anything more to a dream about a crush?	I've heard that dreams are basically influenced by things you may experience during the day. At nighttime while sleeping, your mind "regurgitates" all this information back at you, while adding things in (though jumbled as it may be at times) through dreams.   BUT EITHER WAY,   I like seeing if theres anything to my dreams. :)      A few days ago I had a dream about a guy (that I have a crush on at the moment..).<--- that we'll call Alex.   I was laying on a couch with my head leaning on the side of it in a bright, white place and Alex was leaning against the wall next to the couch.   All of a sudden, he hovered over me & waved to which I waved back.   We started talking and well, eventually began dating. Throughout the whole dream we kept hugging & kissing as couples do.    Then my dream cut to a part where I was in my neighbor's front yard and Alex was there with another girl. (I'm guessing he was tutoring us for some quiz or something along those lines.)   He had written a weird math problem on the board (only thing I remember was x! in the problem.)   Then he started kissing the girl--in the dream I saw it as him "teaching" her, but I still felt jealous over it.   I was a bit ticked over it, and when I looked up a saw a shack in the middle of the yard. It was painted pink & had signs saying you could buy lotto tickets in there.   I looked around, but I couldn't find Alex or the girl around anywhere. From there, I walked into my neighbor's back yard & then woke up.      Ideas?

Do you ever notice how things go through your brain a few times before you properly think it?       It's like...I'm about to speak. I think about the sentence and form it in my head. I'll obviously think about it a few times before I say it.      This, however, happens to me when I'm thinking to myself. I can't think something without having already thought of the little parts of it beforehand. I can never surprise myself.      Do you know what I mean? Do you notice it or am I just strange?

20090220140241AA94Cxr	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Another dream question; interpret this one?	I just posted a question on a dream I kept having when I was younger and I figured if I asked one I might as well ask another. Okay, this isn't as frequent as the Eye one I just asked about but I had it like two night ago and was curious:   It starts off when I am right above this great mass of water just looking down. It's not myself, though, but not anyone else, either. I'm the wind, or the air. There's no sense of a body. I'm looking down at this water and there is this slow stream of what appears to be rain droplets flowing into it. As they flow, they make this high pitch noise. Suddenly I'm aware that everything is making a similar noise. All around me I see 'frequencies' that represent sound. I am aware that there are others inside my head (many of my dreams involve mind reading). We can hear each other, not in words so much but can sense one another's intentions and feelings. Then we look up at the sunset and it is the most vivid and beautiful thing as it melts into the water like running paints. The water turns a goregous shade of indigo and magenta. Then we're on a mountain and people are dancing together and singing happily. We cannot see their faces, but they are surrounded by big colorful halos and we recognize them by that.       ^^What's that mean? And I'm not on drugs. [x

20090220153653AAA7oFf	Social Science;Psychology	How Can You Stop Acting So Insane In School?	Well I'm like a whole different person in home if you see how I act in school. In school I act like I'm all fine and be really hyper and all and sometimes scream even... But in home I'm a totally different person. when I listen to my iPod whenever a sensitive lyric comes out or a sensitive song come out then I cry and can't stop... And I cry about everything that's going on in my life. I feel like committing suicide everyday, and so I tried to talk to my best friend who is really sweet. I told her at first I felt sick, she moved away from me a little and flinched. Then I told her that I was emotionally sick she said "oh." . I told her I felt so alone and left out and wanted to commit suicide and she said " you go to hell if you do that. You don't wanna go there do you?" but that wasn't the answer I was looking for. I needed help desperately... So I told her over and over again but when she said " I can't help you with that anymore. I told you what would happen when you commit suicide." and she went right back to talking to her other friend. So I went home and cried myself to sleep.... Like, if life was a big party then it feels like the party's over now. I don't want anyone to see my sensitive side so I act hyper and act like I'm the happiest person in the world. Then I come home and weep and cry. I feel safe and relieved when I'm around my "friends"... It looks like nothing can harm me. Then I come home. I lay down on my bed and tears ust roll down my cheeks and then the same thing happens again. I really wanna stop acting crazy in school as an excuse but I don't wanna let them see my true side. I don't wanna talk to anyone about my tre side and don't wanna let them know. The counselors repeat the same thing over and over again- be happy and stay positive. But how do you say positive when there's nothing to be happy about? so acting crazy in school became a habit- I actually begin to feel happy for bout a month. But then again I grew tired of everything and was so sick of everything... It's like I'm an atres that has to play a psycho when she just bsted out of rehab or whatever. So I decided that I need to stop right now. But I can't stop acting like that! When I just shut my mouth and be quiet my best friend didn't even notice that I was even there and kept talking with her friends. So I sent my aother best friend a message- and the next morning she came to me and hugged me and said it's alright. But it wasn't. Now I feel like I can't even control my life.    I'm always stressed about everything. I got bunch of hideous zit scars and small bump on my face that some people tease me about. Well only once in a while. And probably because of that I don't have a boyfriend. So how do you stop acting crazy? I need to stop it before the depression and the insanity takes my life over
20090220152328AAufJD6	Social Science;Psychology	Why is my husband telling the OW we are divorced, when we aren't?	We havent seen each other in almost 2 years and haven't spoken in over a year.      Although he filed for a divorce last year, he never finished or followed it up and made the necessary changes to his complaint to go through with it. So the judge dismissed it.      So why is he telling her we are divorced.....and why isn't he doing anything about it now if he wants one.      We also have two young children and they are with me. Child support was filed and I should be getting it anyday now.      Why didn't he finish his divorce and why would he tell this OW (who knew about me) that we are when we really aren't.      The OW keeps saying (found out from blog) that he is really divorced because my husband showed her the divorce decree, but it was a decree stating the judge dismissed the case, not granted the divorce.      I am planning to visit in the summer so I can take my kids to see his grandmother...should I let him know we're there...but I think his mom may tell him anyway.....

20090220151641AA2UtZT	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Why do people sometimes use the word "bachelor" to describe a divorced man?	I have come across a number of occasions where the word "bachelor", which of course means an unmarried man, is used to describe a divorced or sometimes even a widowed man.  There is an episode of The Simpsons where Homer leaves Marge and he goes to the apartments where Milhouse's dad lives - and the sign features the word "bachelor".        Why is the word being used to describe divorced men?  I also read in a recent book that Paul McCartney, his brother and their widowed father lived "a bachelor existence", as said by the writer.  Why apply the term "bachelor" to a man with two sons whose wife has died?
