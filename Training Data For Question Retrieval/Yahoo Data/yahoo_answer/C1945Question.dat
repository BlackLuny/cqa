Almost everytime my playstation tries to update the download stops at some point between 0% and 100% and just stays there for a few minutes. After that one of two things happens. There is either some error message or it says that I was dissconnected from the access point. I'm using a wireless Linksys Router WRT54G at my house and every test says that I have a type 2 connection with a 100% connection rating. SO everytime the message that says that I'm dissconnected from the access point comes on, my router crashes and I lose all networking/internet at my house. I have scouted a bunch of forums and have done all the things that have been suggested. I've opened up the ports that I was told to and created new IP for my PS. However, the problem keeps on persisting everytime I update and sometimes happens when I try to log onto to PSN too. Please help if you've had similar issues.

I've never understood why people argue about what system is better or what movie format is better. People are so passionate about Sony/Microsoft or Blu-Ray/HD-DVD and will argue until they turn blue about why it's better. Can somebody explain to me why this happens?       We all see that PS3 and XBOX 360 are great in their own ways, and we can all see that Blu-Ray and HD-DVD produce great images on our TV's, why do people get dangerously close to a heart attack just to yell about why something is better when it's clear that they are all good?
