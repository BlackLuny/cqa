I prune mine very low, to maybe 8" high, because they get too tall for me during the growing season anyway.  Climbing roses and once bloomers are different - prune them hard AFTER their first flush of bloom dies off, then take them as low as you want, or leave as much height as you want.  But on them at least thin out the branches and remove criss-crossing branches after the first bloom flush.  <br>  Fertilize roses with a slow-release Bloom-Booster fertilizer [one with the middle number, phosphorus, twice the 1st number, nitrogen, like 15-30-8, for example.]<br>  If your roses have not yet leafed out, treat them with a copper based fungicide combined with a dormant oil.  That will eliminate many insect eggs and fungus spores before the growing seasion begins.<br>  During the season, fastidiously clean up all fallen leaves and flower petals from the soil around your roses, all summer long.  The old dried leaves and flowers harbor diseases, insects and insect eggs.<br>  Use bright blue dixie cups coated with STP Oil Treatment to control thrips on your roses.  The color draws the thrips to the cups and they get stuck in the oily STP and die.  <br>  Corn meal, (chicken feed type, from a farm & feed store), spread as a mulch around the drip line of your rose bushes, may help control rose leaf fungi.  It seems to help on mine.

The driveway and house and patio probably need it at least once a year, sometimes more often than that.  Plus you can use it on your cars, gas grill or whatever needs cleaning.  I don't think I'd use it on a roof because it will definitely knock off the surface of the shingle and cause it to need replacing sooner, or at least it seems that way to me.  Pressure washers are very very powerful.  I use mine quite often around our house, they really come in handy.

YupMCYHlaa	Halogen bulbs are a variety of incandescent bulbs.  They have a filament, just like a regular old light bub.  They are made with special materials that allow them to burn brighter and last longer.<br>  <br>  Fluorescent bulbs work a different way.  A high voltage ionizes the gas inside a glass tube (mercury vapor), which generates ultra-violet light.  The inside of the glass tube is coated with phosphors which absorb the ultra-violet light and glow with visible light.<br>  <br>  Halogens can be bigger and produce more light but they are not nearly as efficient, they produce a lot more heat.  Fluorescents are more efficient, they produce less heat, plus the light is more spread out.  And by changing the chemical make up of the phosphor coating, they can get different spectrums  (spectra?) of light, so they can make them just with the frequencies that plants need.

You want to put just a slight bend in the pin, but not too much.  If the latch isn't engaging, you can adjust the strike plate or file it so the bolt catches properly.

zj91sSsuaa	The best way I've found to introduce any stain is to sand off the existing stain. <br>  This requires some work,but you can minimize the duration of time you spend by using an electric sander.<br>  If you haven't much experience with sanders go with a random orbital sander. <br>  Using a belt sander eats alot of wood in a big hurry and you can easily ruin a piece by creating steps in the surface without having some time spent on a belt sander. <br>  Stain, because it is a thin substance absorbs deep into the grain. <br>  This is the place you want to be if you intend to apply a lighter stain however. <br>  Start sanding with a course grit like 80-40 grit paper and when you reach the depth where stain no longer exists, switch to a finer grit of paper, like 100-150, then move to an even finer grit; 220- 400. <br>  Once you do that use an even finer grit on the end grain, this will give you consistent results in color with the surface color. <br>  Stain comes in different forms; paste,liquid. If using the liquid stain be sure to use a wood conditioner before applying the stain. <br>  This will allow the stain to penetrate more evenly, rather than soaking into the softer grain and lying on the harder grain.<br>  After this you can apply a clear coat. I like to apply three to five coats sanding between coats with a super fine grit to achieve a smooth finished surface.|`|MPX0f5jzaa	You strip it, sand it and apply a primer like you would anything else.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind though that it will still look like oak no matter how dark you stain it, the swirl is unmistakable.

If your using a shower pan , you need to remove the drywall and replace w/ a cement board. The cement board will need a vapor barrier in back of it 1 st.. All joints need to be taped w/ the cement  board tape and nothing else.. Using a 1/4 x 3/8 ths square notched trowel apply the LATEX or MODIFIED white thin set . The use of spacers or in this case I use a wedged spacer to keep all tiles level  and plumb at the edges.. Make sure you know where the high spot is on the place your starting so it won t goof you up..Now this sounds fairly straight forward but there a lot of little thing that are to numerous to mention here.. You ll need a wet saw to do all cuts.  So have one handy by renting one or borrowing one...If your going over a custom base where you have to put a liner in, that you may want to hire done.. But I will answer if you go thru my avatar , check my qualifications , and e mail me..

ee33b2a393b166491be1cc514e3f4156aa	I'd find a shower curtain that you love first with some of the blue in it, then choose another shade from it for paint and accessories.  A light brown or mocha would look good and so would gray, but I like greens and blues and whites for a bathroom.  The shade of green would depend on the blue; a celery, lime or sage would probably work.<br>  Here are some shower curtains that might inspire you:<br>  <a href="http://www.target.com/Fieldcrest-Luxury-Stripe-Shower-Curtain/dp/B001I9RNBG/qid=1236206099/ref=br_1_3/188-9850624-4211361?ie=UTF8&node=16305821&frombrowse=1&pricerange=&index=tgt-mf-mv&field-browse=16305821&rank=pmrank&rh=&page=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.target.com/Fieldcrest-Luxury-...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.target.com/Origins-Fabric-Shower-Curtain/dp/B0002TRRFA/qid=1236206156/ref=br_1_13/188-9850624-4211361?ie=UTF8&node=16305821&frombrowse=1&pricerange=&index=tgt-mf-mv&field-browse=16305821&rank=pmrank&rh=&page=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.target.com/Origins-Fabric-Sho...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.target.com/Denim-Stripes-Vinyl-Shower-Curtain/dp/B000S647E6/qid=1236206201/ref=br_1_12/188-9850624-4211361?ie=UTF8&node=16305821&frombrowse=1&pricerange=&index=tgt-mf-mv&field-browse=16305821&rank=pmrank&rh=&page=3" rel="nofollow">http://www.target.com/Denim-Stripes-Viny...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.target.com/Contemporary-Home-Dot-Shower-Curtain/dp/B00160GOAS/qid=1236206246/ref=br_1_12/188-9850624-4211361?ie=UTF8&node=16305821&frombrowse=1&pricerange=&index=tgt-mf-mv&field-browse=16305821&rank=pmrank&rh=&page=6" rel="nofollow">http://www.target.com/Contemporary-Home-...</a> (with light lime walls)<br>  <a href="http://www.shower-curtains.org/africanfloralshowercurtainandbathset.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.shower-curtains.org/africanfl...</a> (with sage green walls)<br>  <a href="http://www.overstock.com/Home-Garden/Blue-Stripes-Shower-Set/3545666/product.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.overstock.com/Home-Garden/Blu...</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.overstock.com/Home-Garden/Tempo-Linen-Shower-Curtain/3570873/product.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.overstock.com/Home-Garden/Tem...</a><br>  (with gray walls for the two above)<br>  <a href="http://www.overstock.com/Home-Garden/Royal-Court-Shower-Curtain/3816770/product.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.overstock.com/Home-Garden/Roy...</a> (with mocha walls)<br>  Hope this at least helped get you started on a color scheme.|`|wKuNswEjaa	what about wall quotes<br>  <br>  <a href="http://stores.shop.ebay.co.uk/2734-PAINTSHOP_QUOTABLES_W0QQ_fsubZ1080197018QQ_sidZ763628968QQ_trksidZp4634Q2ec0Q2em322" rel="nofollow">http://stores.shop.ebay.co.uk/2734-PAINT...</a><br>  <br>  or tile decals<br>  <br>  <a href="http://stores.shop.ebay.co.uk/2734-PAINTSHOP_FOR-TILES_W0QQ_fsubZ1067733018QQ_sidZ763628968QQ_trksidZp4634Q2ec0Q2em322" rel="nofollow">http://stores.shop.ebay.co.uk/2734-PAINT...</a>|`|9FBh8Mu0aa	Blue White and Black, or Blue White and Brown, or Blue Cream and Brown.|`|6f1d6bb560584bdbd9ef104f6b599c85aa	Check out this pic:  <a href="http://www.danielskitchenbath.com/Frameless%20shower%20door%20full.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.danielskitchenbath.com/Framel...</a><br>  It might give you an idea or two.|`|fNuMoHt7aa	You can paint the tiles with a special paint. you could also replace the vainty for about $100 if you do it yourself

36UDdHFzaa	I would suggest a hoover. I have one and LOVE (ok not that much) but I like it. :) <br>  <br>  I would also suggest renting a rug doctor to go over the entire house which is best at removing stains and dirt. I have found that the cleaners out there aren't as powerful as a rug doc. I found that it's more used for upkeep of the carpet. <br>  <br>  Get a cleaner which brush moves from front to back not "spinning". After I purchased my cleaner I read that the spinning ruins carpets over time b/c it spins out the twists in the carpet. <br>  <br>  "Steamers" are not necessarily heated. The one I bought only keeps the water as warm as what is put in. It doesn't actually warm it at all. I seen a few out there that do heat the water and keep it warm too. <br>  <br>  Good luck. Research a lot too! :)|`|ebJ02QZJaa	I like my Hoover.  It is 15 years old and has been used to clean all of my relatives houses as well as rentals that I own.

I think mine is about 10 or 12 yrs old & have had no problems with it. It is easy to fill, & empty. I think mine was a little over the $200 range though. A steam cleaner keeps the water heated while you are cleaning the carpet.

xXP91mYBaa	It depends on several things<br>  If it is a flexible boxspring and it is over 10 years old it needs to be replaced.<br>  Most mattresses today are designed to sit on a foundation or non flexible or semi flex boxspring. Putting them on an old flexible boxspring could be a bad thing. You will then lack the support the mattress needs. All these folks are telling you it supports the mattress and then tell you that you don't need it. Which is it folks? I question whether they are defining support properly.<br>  <br>  Mattress manufacturers disclose in their warranty (read one) that if you are not using it with their base they reserve the right to void warranty.<br>  <br>  Save money? Give up a 10 year warranty? That's up to you.<br>  Here is a blog on boxsprings.<br>  <a href="http://www.stlbeds.com/articles/2008/05/07/what-is-a-boxspring-and-what-does-it-really-do/" rel="nofollow">http://www.stlbeds.com/articles/2008/05/...</a>|`|TNwvuazEaa	Yes. Buy both. They're made for each other. You should buy them in combination. Putting a new mattress on an old box spring will look stupid because they will not match. Also, you have no idea if your old box spring was made to support the weight and stress points of your new mattress. Additionally, if you are buying a Queen size mattress or larger, your bed frame must have a center support beam. Get on your knees and look under your bed. If you only see the frame around the perimeter of the bed, this is insufficient for a queen size or larger mattress. It will void any mattress warranty.|`|JT4OSUPeaa	We just bought a new brand new bed a couple weeks ago. Mattresses are sooo expensive.

If it was mine I would try to fix it first.|`|AA10092387	Ok bud I will try to answer this question. <br>  <br>  First off you need to know that most washers today have some little bitty inserts in the inside of them that make them work.<br>  If it flew off then you lost them. One or all and the agitator will not work anymore. Call a repair shop or find a store that sells parts and see if you can find parts, remember use your model number and make of washer.<br>  It could be an easy problem to fix only if you can get the parts you need.

AA12384954	I can understand your problem.  Some of the dyes and inks they use today, even in magazines, really smell awful.  Some of them are responsible for headaches and migraines, so one wonders what is in them.  I am not sure of a correct answer but perhaps try a eucalyptus wool mix wash.

Sometimes it is just a matter of washing the garment several times. But if you want to expedite the process I recommend soaking the sweatshirt in a mixture of baking soda and water.

Then wash the hoodie as normal. Good luck and hope it helps!|`|BEYNzIfiaa	Try Febreze for pet smells. It gets a lot of weird smells out.

If it is attached to a wall, the wall will create a dry 'rain shadow', which is too dry for good growth, so you must plant it about 18 inches away, with the plant inclined towards the trellis with a cane to incourage it to grow that way, and tie it in as it grows, until it is established on the trellis.

I just refill a regular jumbo laundry container (the kind with the push-spigot on it) out of the 5 gallon bucket.  If you use the Duggar's borax recipe, it makes enough for two 5-gallon buckets.<br>  <br>  If you don't mind used containers, contact a professional painter and I imagine they'll give you all the 5-gallon buckets you want.  Can't beat free, either.  Those are better quality than the ones you can purchase to mix paint in, too.

d1805dca25d00374cb2c98883d99b807aa	Here is a video giving instructions on how to make a silk flower bouquet<br>  <a href="http://www.wonderhowto.com/how-to/video/how-to-make-silk-bridal-bouquets-232703/" rel="nofollow">http://www.wonderhowto.com/how-to/video/...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  How To Make A Silk Flower Bridal Bouquet<br>  Things You’ll Need:<br>  Silk flowers <br>  Filler flowers such as baby's breath <br>  Illusion veil material or ribbon <br>  1 Bouquet holder <br>  Floral tape <br>  Floral picks <br>  Silk fern leaves or eucalyptus leaves if desired <br>  <br>  <br>  Step1Go to the store and select your silk flowers. Here are some things to keep in mind. Most brides prefer white flowers but in photographs the flowers will be lost against the background of the white bridal gown. If you are using white then it would be a good idea to also put some leaves or pastel colored ribbon to match the colors of the bridal party. You can also choose to put some colored baby's breath in between the flowers, or stephanotis with a small pearl glued to the center, or even some colored illusion veiling material. <br>  Step2Put a drop of glue where the stem meets the foam in the holder. There are two kinds of bouquet holders, one has Styrofoam for the sturdier stems of silk flowers and the other uses a green florists foam. You can use either, however the florist foam will not hold the flowers well if you take them in and out for positioning because the stems will leave big holes in it. Styrofoam is more forgiving of your rearranging. Whichever you choose it may not be a bad idea to secure the stem to the foam with a drop or two of glue. Only do that once you're sure of flower placement. <br>  Step3Cut the stems of the flowers with wire cutters keeping in mind that the longer the stems are, the more flowers you will have to use to make the bouquet. Start with about 3 inches of stem. If you want a cascade shape you will leave the bottom flowers a few inches longer. Don't be afraid to cut them wrong. If they are too long you can always cut more, and if they are too short you can reattach the stem with the floral tape and no one will ever know the difference. <br>  Step4Place the silk flowers in the holder keeping in mind the shape you want to end up with. You will at this point have gaps between the flowers where you can see through to the foam. This is where your fillers come in. For baby's breath you can cut small bunches of it and wrap the wire from the floral pick around the stem parts and use the wooden pick to insert it into the foam. Add one piece of filler at a time till you achieve the effect you want. The main flowers should not be overlapping each other and the spaces in between covered with whatever fillers you are using. Pay attention to the sides all around the bouquet, unless there is filler there you will be able to see the foam from the side. Craft shops also have lace pieces that you can slip over the handle of the holder to cover those sides.|`|AA10520442	youtube.com has videos about everything.<br>  Just put "flower arranging" in the youtube search engine.
hWd50Lk8aa	Your best bet is to separate them this summer, not now.<br>  <br>  Keep it in full sun, outside if possible as long as the temp is above 45 degrees.<br>  <br>  You will have to wait at least 2 years after potting to see what you have. Make sure and place them in a big shallow pot. Soil needs to be 50% expanded shale, 50% landscape mix. Water should run out as fast as you pour it in. The idea is to get lots of air and water over roots.<br>  <br>  I have 3 very nice plants that I picked up after someone threw them away, so avoided  5 years of waiting.

d94f99ad1710d80ab4587d8db787acb3aa	Mike, granites great but you have to be able to pay the price.  There's acrylics/composites, but they're up there in price too.   Lowe's and Home Depot are retail and if you want a better price on solid surface or laminate you need to look up laminate or high pressure laminate suppliers in your phone books yellow pages or online (locally).  If you want to get quotes on solid surface, Corian, Fountainhead etc., call some local shops and get prices.  They'll come out and quote you.  You can also buy direct if you're a DIY'er and  go to <a href="http://nevamar.com" rel="nofollow">http://nevamar.com</a> or Formica and use there distributor locator toggles to find distributors near you.<br>  <br>  Now there are some stone/granite laminates that can be used to make great looking countertops. I like Nevamar and Formica brands best when wanting to implement a rock/stone look using laminate.  What else I do sometimes is inset an oak cutting board next to the stove or in the center island if applicable to elevate the laminate countertops looks and function.  It's easy to make these removable for cleaning cutting board insets to accent the kitchen.<br>  <br>  Mike Lonergan<br>  TradesProfessional, Inc.<br>  <a href="http://tradesprofessional.com" rel="nofollow">http://tradesprofessional.com</a>|`|AA10097817	Here is a GREAT article about all kinds of countertop surfaces...I personally have a quartz counter and I love it.

YBYnZlP8aa	By installing acoustical ceiling tiles on the wall you can reduce the noise level significantly. You will want to purchase 12" x 12" tiles from your local hardware store. Most of these tiles have a pre-fitted edge which makes lining them up simple. You may need to cut some of the tiles to get an exact fit. Use a utility knife and a straight edge (ruler) to make a precise cut. <br>  <br>  To reduce noise from one room to another, you will want to seal any cracks and air passages. Noise likes to escape through any opening. Electrical outlets are an opening cut directly into the wall. These outlets are a prime place to focus your efforts to reduce noise. Your hardware store should carry a product called Electrical Outlet Seals. These seals fit between your outlet and the plate.<br>  <br>  Sound Stop also makes tackable wall panels. These are easier to install and may be a good option for you.<br>  <br>  These quotes are from a detailed article on this subject:  How to Reduce Noise (Soundproofing), I'll post the link in sources.

A picture is worth a thousand words.|`|7nHuDxivaa	I don't think history is a bad theme, but it does kind of conflict with contemporary/modern design.<br>  <br>  As far as food at first you can keep it simple, appetizers or small plates are easier and you wouldn't need a full sized kitchen. You could have simple things like a gourmet olive tray with a few types of olives. A gourmet cheese and bread plate. Simple things that are easier to put together.  Most lounges have little or no food, or maybe just snacks on the bar like mixed nuts.<br>  <br>  Also if you want to simplify you could concentrate on having a great wine selection, beer selection, martinis, or cocktails. All of the above requires a huge fully stocked bar.<br>  <br>  You could also offer live music, lots of new indepent bands or djs would love a chance to play for little or no money.

The best thing you could do is ask for help... if you do the wrong thing, it could prevent anything from working.|`|N1ay8hzFaa	Have you tried nail polish remover?|`|e1da218fa360d619acec56b3218b6e6caa	Try this.  Ina  spray bottle put one cup of water, one cup of ammonia and one cup of dih soap.  Spray on the stains and let sit for at least 10 minutes.  This removed red nail polish from a gray carpet for me!  It was on the carpet for three months!|`|8ee4GOb9aa	That special water always works i forget the name or any stain remover and also laundry deturgent actually works the best

Those work very well and are awesome!|`|ANsznbWsaa	get one of those sponge mops or the clorox or swiffer wet mops.|`|e1da218fa360d619acec56b3218b6e6caa	Use a Swiffer!  But, do not use their refill pads.  Why?  You can use newborn baby diapers instead.  I buy a bag of newborn baby diapers from Target.  I get 50 for $5.99.  And they last me 8-10 weeks.  They are a lot cheaper and more absorbent!  I have three dogs and Swiffer is the best on my hardwood floors.|`|llgZaACPaa	You should regulate the floors so you can make sure it doesn't get dirty.

ixR3qfYdaa	Bugs stay in furniture, usually, you can't get them out easily. If you are bringing couches, etc. with you, then you are bringing the bugs. Unless you can wrap your furniture and cloth items in a bag and them bomb them, you can't kill them. It took 5 years to get my house un-infested by them|`|jPXjfn1iaa	Make sure before you enter your home, that you rub your feet really good on the outside ground, in case there are any eggs on your shoes. Also, check your boxes and bags, and make sure you don't see any cockroaches in there. I hope I helped! Just thinking of cockroaches makes me fell queasy!|`|46ee6d31d1c17f2488e9ebcae5664dfcaa	Use some foggers bait and spray. It is hard to get them out but as soon as you see one kill it. My parents had a bad time with that. I dont since the apartments I live in are clean and so are the people around me. You may be clean but others may not be so choose a new place wisely.|`|LYdC8bWzaa	Throw nuclear bombs at them.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Oh wait.

qNVP4Q1Saa	If you do not mortar the blocks then you are setting yourself up for disaster/ I have seen people make stand up walls of cinderblocks and if you lean against it you can know it over an dbreak an ankle or kill a small child or pet.  Otherwise you need to mortar all the joints.
MBh2X2qWaa	It sounds like the bonnet is leaking. This occurs when the handle is turned on or off after longs periods of not being used. Usually the handle has a screw in the center (or not) of it. This screw holds the handle onto the stem which in turn passes through the"bonnet. The bonnet usually is shaped with a wrench type nut around it so you can tighten it. After you tighten it this may make the handle harder to turn as you have just compressed the packing inside the bonnet to stop the leak. DO NOT use teflon tape on this fitting ( the bonnet) or it will leak more. If tightening the bonnet doesn't work you can repack it but it's usually less of a head ache to replace the shut valve all together. A remember, if this one leaks the other will soon to. So if you replace it, replace both, the hot and cold.|`|sevY8u56aa	How about Teflon tape..It is thin white tape that is put over threads to keep a connection from leaking..|`|k7hBT7MGaa	It is important to know from where the water is coming.  <br>  <br>  I'm going to assume it is from where the shaft for the handle goes through a nut into the faucet.   If so, you need to buy some faucet packing material. <br>  <br>  Shut off water for the house.   <br>  Remove the faucet handle.<br>  Remove the stem nut and packing nut.<br>  Remove the stem.<br>  Remove old packing material and clean the stem.<br>  Clean the inside of the faucet.<br>  Wrap new packing around the stem.<br>  Reassemble.<br>  <br>  If the leak is where the hose screws onto the faucet, replace the washer in the hose.  If the hose is damaged, replace the hose.|`|5IPZ7w2caa	Try the washer thing and if the faucet still leaks call a plumber.<br>  <br>  <br>  ..
ui7waO1haa	Well, fresh stains are the easiest to take out. "Set in" stains are way more challenging. Cleaning it right after you get a stain on your clothing, etc., is WAY easier! Some different methods to clean clothes: <br>  - Dry cleaning clothes. <br>  - Washing clothes with a washing machine and using a dryer to dry them. <br>  - Hand washing clothes and air drying them. <br>  - Washing them with an old-fashioned washing board and then air drying them.  <br>  <br>  Oil, coffee, ketchup, grape juice, tomato juice, and wine all stain HORRIBLY. However, if I had to choose one, I would choose the juices, wine, or the coffee. Hope that helped. Good luck on your project!|`|e1da218fa360d619acec56b3218b6e6caa	If you do not wash the stain out right away, it may not come out.  Or my not completely come out.  So, if you cannot wash the item right away, try this.  I have a homemade stain removal.  In a spray bottle put one cup of each :  dish washing soap, ammonia and water.  This mixture removes anything!  It removed three month old nail polish from a gray carpet.  The nail polish was red!|`|AA10097817	It's like writing with an erasable pen. The longer the ink stays on the paper, the harder it is to erase.<br>  <br>  1. tomato juice and ketchup are the same, for me the hardest - cold water and Fels Naptha soap, sometimes need more than one application<br>  2. oil - HOT water and Fels Naptha soap<br>  3. coffee - cold water and Fels Naptha soap<br>  4. red wine and grape juice are the same - hydrogen peroxide and salt|`|4z0Rk4Ddaa	What the difference is--if you spill something on your clothing and you rinse it out right away in stead of waiting.  Chances are you will get the stain out.  Now if you wait until it dries it is a lot harder to get out and you may never get it out which in turn will ruin your clothing.<br>  <br>  Washing by hand<br>  Dry Cleaning<br>  Using a Washing machine<br>  Using a Wash board<br>  Using a Wringer Washer<br>  <br>  Fresh food stain, caused from anything that you have eaten.<br>  Drink stains (coffee. tea, soda pop, juice) caused from anything that you have spilled on you while drinking.<br>  Blood,  <br>  smelly laundry stains,  <br>  body odor stains, caused from sweating<br>  grass, <br>  grease, <br>  oil,<br>  baby stains,<br>  pet stains.

AHZ7fgQHaa	If the thickness is the same, the plywood is far stronger because it's laminated with grain running in different directions.|`|fe73dc32e71ef5846abbf8e72834c313aa	Pine is generally a soft wood and does bend easily. Plywood is laminated as said before and is stronger.|`|GcWb7IRdaa	for what task|`|uvAKkoHyaa	The plywood.  I needed a long beam to span a room for a child's loft.  I decided it would be cheaper to fabricate my own than to buy oversize lumber.  I cut strips of plywood and laminated them into a beam.  It is astoundingly rigid.  I didn't expect it to be as impressively strong as it turned out to be.
AA11221077	Well, nobody needs a pool or a computer. Those are extras. If you can buy them, great, but you won't suffer without them. <br>  <br>  As for Grandma and Grandpa moving in, some of the siblings could share a room. My mother slept in a room with her four sisters for years. <br>  <br>  Now, the medicine can be a problem. If you can't afford medication, tell the dr. or contact the drug company.

ZAkQ7T0faa	Your furnace is not very efficient at all.  By the age of your furnace you would be lucky to be 75% efficient.  Where I live electricity is cheaper than gas.  The thing is it would take quite a few heaters to heat your whole house.  Maybe you could use both by turning down your thermostat.|`|ad5455b2eaa62e2475ecd39a9f4347b6aa	The age of your system does not necessarily mean it is terribly inefficient. The fact is that older systems were so well balanced to each home that they are often very efficient,Have it checked out and make sure it is in good working order. Set your thermostat and see what you've got. You might just be surprised!|`|ORpC0ghGaa	I want to say use it until it goes out, but it is always best to look into more energy efficient appliances (if you have the money).
