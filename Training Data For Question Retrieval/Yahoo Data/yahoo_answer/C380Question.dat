I live in Eastpointe, Michigan and have an unattached, 2 1/2 car garage made of cinder block with a concrete floor outside of my brick home.  I have lived here for 14 years and just last winter my garage started getting water coming in from the floor on one side.  Every time there was a thaw the water would come up all along the bottom side.  At one point the water covered half the garage and was approx. 2 inches deep at the one side.  Outside of the garage, on the side where the water comes up, is only 3 ft. from the property line and fence.  I put small rocks along this area next to the garage 14 years ago.  They are now under water as well.  My next door neighbor has been randomly adding soil to his backyard, due to dog digging and he had a pool that had left sunken areas.  I suspect his adding of soil has changed the pitch of his yard and now all the water is running right towards my garage.  I can build up the area next to the garage (the 3 ft. area) by adding soil over the rocks, but the concrete driveway runs right along the property line and it is under water about 10 ft. past the garage all along the fence line and in about 3 ft. into my property.  I know I must do something about this very soon, as it is only February and the garage has had water twice now for the 2nd year.  I am concerned that the foundation will crack or be destroyed when the water freezes up again.  Please tell me what I can possibly do?  Thanks so much for any advice you can give.

20090205071253AA1dI3z	Home & Garden;Other - Home & Garden	Are these normal emotions when buying a house?	We are buying a new house (settlement is at the end of the month) we sold our house to an investor because it needs a lot of work that we don't have time to put into it.      We (hubby and I) have a toddler with one on the way in a 700 sq ft house with only 2 bedrooms.  Its so tiny and we can't stand the house 94% of the time because of lack of room and the work needed done.      So we found a house that we were in love with.  Then hubby decided after about a day or two that he didn't like it for all the reasons we LOVED it (after talking to people at work and what not).  Then he decided to go with the house after all because it fits us perfectly right now and if anything we could always sell again in several years and get a better house.       Well now that we have the settlement date together and already put money down, he decided that he doesn't want to move period.  He thinks he's made a HUGE mistake and now were loosing our first house (witch has a lot of memories, I know) and he feels like were making a huge mistake.      I can't stand this tiny house, yes I love it but we need a bigger house we have NO SPACE NO ROOM NO NOTHING.  The new house is 4 times the size and its exactly what we need and like now.  But he changes his mind so much.        Are these feelings normal... does everybody feel this way when buying a house?

I'm on the market now and there's this nice loft style condo in which I like everything except the ceiling. It has horrible white boards with cracks and stuff.      I wonder what would be an approximate cost per sqr ft to get it replaced with boards that actually look like wood. The ceiling is tilted and is like 30ft at its highest point.

I don't know where they came from, but they are up all night fighting and God knows what. We can close in the bottom of the house so no more can get in, but there are a bunch of them under the house so we don't want to trap them.  Is there something we can spray to get rid of them? We just don't want them coming back.  They are HUGE.      Already called the Louisiana SPCA and left a message, I'm not expecting much from them.

We live on 12 1/2 acres of land and have to keep the gate closed most of the time because we also have 4 horses running around.  Its such a pain in the butt to have to get in and out of the car and open the gate (in the dirt, cause its on a dirt road), drive through & get out to close it again, then drive up to the house.  We have a lot of people coming in and out and they all have to do this.  Especially at night it's actually kind of scary cause there are no lights at the opening, lol.  Anyway, how much is an automatic gate opener?  Where you just push the button like a garage door opener?  And where can I find one??
20090205082514AAPrOlE	Home & Garden;Decorating & Remodeling	Granite or Wood top for the desk in kitchen?	Hi, I am remodeling my kitchen. I have selected the cabinets already. All I have is kitchen part, island and a DESK. The cabinets of kitchen and desk is same color and island is little darker. The granite for kitchen countertop and island is decided already which is Shivakashi gold. Now my question is, should I have the same granite top on desk or should I go for a wooden top? I am really confused here and need to let my people know in a day or two what I want there… of course the solid wood top is more expensive than granite but that not really the issue is. I like granite top and my husband wanted a wood top there. Will it be too much granite if I use it on the desk? Your answer will really be appreciated…

20090205082756AA5jPMF	Home & Garden;Decorating & Remodeling	I have Maroon tile, green sandstone sink, whitewashed oak vanity?	I want to paint my white walls a color that would work with my floor and vanity.   Removing border's an option, it's light & dark shades of maroon, green, & blue.  I have brushed nickle metals.   I've considered painting a faux silver finish using a light gray paint first then paint the silver in random swipes.  Lowes faux finish section has it and I've seen it on HGTV's website Rate My Space (but not with my colors).  It's an 8' x 8' room with a corner shower.  I have 6 tall narrow mirrors spaced a few inches apart that make it look bigger.  Not a huge amount of walls showing, like a bedroom for instance, so it wouldn't overwhelm me.     So, should I be adventurous with silver or do you have a coordinating color suggestion?

I live in an apartment with bed bugs and our apartment manager has had an exterminator come in and treat our home seven times already. After all them times I believe we still have them. The exterminator says he doesn't see anything anymore but I am still waking up with tiny itchy bumps on my hands. The bumps are a lot smaller than they used to be. So maybe they are something else but I don't know what. I am going crazy. Any help out there would really help.
