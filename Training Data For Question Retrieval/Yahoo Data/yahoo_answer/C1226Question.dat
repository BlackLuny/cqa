20090220171011AAAOMjC	Science & Mathematics;Physics	Kinetic energy of spring?	We usually ignore the kinetic energy of the moving coils of a spring, but let's try to get a reasonable approximation to this. Consider a spring of mass M, equilibrium length L0, and spring constant k. The work done to stretch or compress the spring by a distance L is 0.5kx^2, where x = L – L0.    (a) Consider a spring, as described above that has one end fixed and the other end moving with speed v. Assume that the speed of points along the length of the spring varies linearly with distance l from the fixed end. Assume also that the mass M of the spring is distributed uniformly along the length of the spring. Calculate the kinetic energy of the spring in terms of M and v.    (Hint: Divide the spring into pieces of length dl; find the speed of each piece in terms of l, v, and L; find the mass of each piece in terms of dl, M, and L; and integrate from 0 to L. The result is not 0.5Mv^2, since not all of the spring moves with the same speed.)          The attempt at a solution      v = (qL^2)/2, where q is the constant proportionality of v and l   m = (M^2)/(2 landa) ,where landa is the linear mass density      I'm not sure if my current workings are correct. And how to get rid of these constants?          Thanks!

How long does it take to attain this speed?      3. A loaf of bread weighs 10.9 N on earth. What would be its weight on mars where the acceleration due to gravity is 0.378 times that on the earth? What would its weight be in Neptune, where gravity 1.14 times than on earth?      4. A stuntman jumps from top of one building to the top of another 7.0m away. After a running start, he leaps at an angle of 34 degrees with respect to the flat roof while traveling at a speed of 28m/s to the next building which is 2.0m shorter than the first. How much time does it take to leap from the first building to the second? What is the vertical velocity just before he hits the top of the next building?

20090203081345AAKG1sc	Science & Mathematics;Physics	Simple physics question: Sound Intensity?	A loud speaker has a circular opening with a radius of 0.095 meters. The electrical power needed operate the speaker is 25.0 W. The average sound intensity at the opening is 17.5 W/m^2 . What percentage of the electrical power is converted by the speaker into sound power?      If it helps, this problem is taken from an algebra based physics text. Using the equation for uniform spherical radiation I found the sound power as follows.       I = P/A -----> P = IA = I*(4πr^2)      Therefore the sound power is      P = 17.5[4π (0.095)^2 ] = 1.98 W      Percentage of total sound power is      (1.98/25)*100 = 7.94%      The author says the percentage should be 1.98%.  Seems like he got the numbers mixed up. Any help is appreciated.

In an automatic clothes drier, a hollow cylinder moves the clothes on a vertical circle (radius r = 0.29 m), as the drawing shows. The appliance is designed so that the clothes tumble gently as they dry.

How many revolutions per second should the cylinder make in order that the clothes lose contact with the wall when  = 67.0°?      ok I used the formula tan(67)=v^2/(0.29(9.8))      so i get V= 2.59 and then I divide it by 2piR, but i get the wrong answer. what am i doing wrong?
