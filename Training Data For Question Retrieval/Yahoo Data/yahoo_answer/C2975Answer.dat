pnCOR1UVaa	CFL's use 1/4 the energy for the same amount of light. Quality bulbs will last up to 10 times longer. So, over the life of a bulb they are cheaper to use than incandescent bulbs. Yes, they contain mercury, but they are 100% recyclable and if they are disposed of properly the mercury will never be released into the environment. Occasionally one will break, but there is such a small amount of mercury that there is little risk, but you should ventilate the area and not use bare hands to clean up. Ugly is subjective, compared to a gas flame many thought the incandescent bulb was ugly as well. There are many light fixtures that hide the bulb completely. Most bulbs are made in China, incandescent, CFL's, other fluorescent, halogen and LED are made in China. You can find made in the USA brands for most types of bulbs, but that is a challenge even for incandescents.|`|FpYzxE90aa	Well, the CFC bulbs are a lot more efficient, maybe you don't see it on your electric bill because it is such a small difference compared to all of the rest of the things you run in your house, but it is proven they use less energy. They also do not waste much energy, the incandescent bulbs that you are talking about waste almost half of their energy to the heat that they release. Also if you do some research you will realize the mercury that is in these new bulbs is such a small amount it will not affect anything. You can say they do pollute the environment but the energy you waste with the incandescent bulbs is far more.|`|5TKEtXERaa	Here are some facts for you: <br>  <br>    If you get a kill-a-watt meter (a device that tells you exactly how much electricity an item consumes) and plug in a lamp with an incandescent bulb and then a cfl  bulb you will see for yourself that the cfl uses 75% less electricity. <br>  <br>    As for the mercury when you get your electricity if you are the majority of Americans you get it from a coal fired power plant this power plant emits many pollutants in the air one of which is mercury. By using cfl's that have around 4 mg of mercury you cause that plant to spew a fourth of the pollutants that you would have to with an incandescent, Also if the cfl is recycled unbroken the mercury in the cfl is never put in the environment.<br>  <br>    If you Absolutely want no mercury in your house go with the led option, but also get a programmable thermostat because the old fashioned thermostats have a mercury switch that has over 200 mgs of mercury in it (yes over 50X the cfl) and half of neon signs have mercury.<br>  <br>    As for the made in China part, the country as a whole is a little late on that a house that is all american made and only american products is near impossible today. I would check those bulbs to make sure they were US exclusive.<br>  <br>  For anyone like uncle dud here is a google search so you can see many kill-a-watt meters most of which you can get for about $20 -$30 and then you can see with your own eyes what will save you money (cfl & led) and what uses energy. <br>   <a href="http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&q=kill+a+watt+meter&gbv=2" rel="nofollow">http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&q=...</a>|`|2qQPBDlkaa	I love that argument....<br>  <br>  the savings in energy is important even if it is such a small amount that you dont' see it .. it adds up...<br>  <br>  the mercury is such a small amount it is insignificant...<br>  <br>  <br>  _____________________________<br>  <br>  and they don't recognize the hypocrisy of saying that pollutiing the earth with mercury doesn't count because it is a small amount.. while saving such a small amount of energy does count.. hmm HELLO the mercury adds up to.. they BOTH count!|`|t1zlbOURaa	Because part of indoctrinating you is to make you do something.

However, it appears present concerns could be justified as ice area is decreasing and possibly accelerating and now on the verge of breaking daily records.  It appears that unless the decrease quickly stabilizes we have now seen the maximum coverage of this winter season.<br>  <br>  This could be even more interesting <a href="http://nsidc.org/data/seaice_index/images//daily_images/S_timeseries.png" rel="nofollow">http://nsidc.org/data/seaice_index/image...</a>|`|aeVz0lrBaa	The data shows that there's still ice there and its still a huge amount and not showing any particular signs of having reached a tipping point.<br>  <br>  personally I think the biggest thing to have come from the NSIDC reporting error is that is wasn't scientists who brought the problem to the attention of the NSIDC.   I'm not claiming for one moment that Dr Meier and his team were ignoring the sudden drop in sea ice extent from around 16th Feb (errors will happen from time to time), but it's strange how such a large drop in sea ice over a day or 2 wasn't picked up on pretty much straight away ?  <br>  <br>  This, I feel is proof that although you may not have a science degree or a degree in climatology, or similar, you are still able to check data and make comments on a given subject (by way of questioning data if there's any doubt about its authenticity)<br>  <br>  Finally - warmers and skeptics should accept that errors will happen in data collection. I'm sure that this type of situation isn't the first and I'm certain it won't be the last.

Have a nice flight.|`|uFQFRdczaa	That depends whose climate models and projections you choose to believe.  If economic growth in China and India continue as they did in 1997-2007, we might be seeing temps at the high end of projections (4C over 100 years).  Still, for 50 years that's only about 2C warmer than now.  That kind of temperature increase won't kill anybody, as long as you drink plenty of fluids and head into the air conditioning during the hottest part of the day in the hottest part of summer.  The issue will be water for irrigation--a couple degrees warmer and the Sierra Nevada snowpack won't exist, and neither will southern California agriculture.  I'd avoid Death Valley, or anywhere drinking water is already hard to come by.  Oh, and also disease. We'll have Malaria move north if we're not careful.<br>  <br>  There are other people projecting we'll be in a new ice age, which would mean 6C colder--that prediction is usually tongue-in-cheek, meant as a backhanded slap to global warming theorists, but those models are out there too.  <br>  <br>  For my part, I'm sticking with the temperate zone.  I'm in Tennessee, during the ice age we had a climate similar to North Dakota, if we have all the projected warming we'll get a climate similar to southern Florida.

Even so Eastern Antarctica and the peninsula are showing signs of melting as is Greenland.<br>  Yes the world is "friggin big" but so is the volume of ice in Antarctica you are talking about a continent of 14,000,000 sq km (the U.S. is 9 million) it has an average ice thickness of 2km, in places it is over 4.5km thick the surface area of the Earth (water only) is ~316 mil sq km which is ~25 times the surface area of Antarctica.<br>  Simple rough math would tell you if you divide the 2km of ice thickness by that 25 you will get around 80m. Again no one is actually saying Antarctica is going to melt totally, but this shows that those like James E are just making up their maths. The above dimensions are available on wiki do the math yourself.<br>  The problem we face is much less than this but even a few feet of sea rise is going to be a big problem for coastal cities around the world.<br>  <br>  T/A: Sorry ice burgs and what they do are part of my job <br>  sea ice is surface sea water frozen it like the Arctic adds little to sea level, in Antarctica it can get up to 3-4 meters thick, an ice burg is 'calved' from a glacier which form on land, a fresh 'tabular' burg can be 100km long with 50 or 60 meters of ice above the water and ten times that below the water yes once they are in the water they displace it but ice burg calving is a continues process and in Eastern Antarctica it has been speeding up. As for this comment<br>  "For starters anyone who says that water expands when if warms must have flunked junior high science."<br>  Thermal expansion is a physical fact, the percentage is tiny but when you are talking about oceans km's deep, tiny can be a 6in to over a meter.<br>  <br>  Kepi: Also sorry but in relation to Antarctic glacial ice and your glass experiment, it only works if you fill the glass to the top with water first and then put ice cubes in, then see what happens, but have a towel ready.|`|Gr6Xe1gGaa	Not just Antarctica is melting all the ice caps in the world is melting very fast now.

We have to act now or by the year 2050 all the shore lines in the world will be flooded! If we keep up the global warming thing it gets worse and oceans will rise 2 inches a year that might sound a little, but remember it grows and gets worse.|`|qGpD9ntNaa	For starters anyone who says that water expands when if warms must have flunked junior high science. IT IS COMMON KNOWLEDGE that when water freezes it expands. its doesn't matter if it is salt water or fresh water they both expand when they freeze.  Go fill a plastic bottle to the top with salt water and put it in the freezer come back the next day and the bottle will have split or pooped the cap of the bottle. and the polar ice caps are floating ice caps which means that even they completely melt away the sea level will not rise AT ALL if anything the sea levels will go down. And they now say that it is the land based snow and ice that will flood the planet when it all melts. BUT 70% of the planet is water so that means that 30% is land now of that 30% lets say 10% (and that is a pretty high estimate) is snow and ice. That would mean that at the best this snow and ice would consist of 3% of the planet do you really think that would be enough water to flood the planet. And if the temperature goes up that much that would mean that more water would evaporate making the seal levels DROP more.<br>  <br>  The planet is not going to flood.<br>  <br>  EDIT The giant ice bergs that are breaking free from antartica are floating ice caps therfor they have all ready dispalced their weight in the water<br>  <br>  EDIT how can you use new orleans as a example of flooding caused from global warming. The city was built below sea level  the had to build leveis to keep the water out inorder to build the city<br>  <br>  Edit you all are actually saying that water does not expand when it freezes if it has salt in it. <br>  OK<br>  I always thought that water evaporated when it was heated up my bad <br>  <br>  EDIT<br>  and what about the other side of antartica where the ice is getting thicker and YES antartica is surounded by a floating ice shelve even though the continent it self is sitting on rock does't mean all the ice around it is.<br>  <br>  EDIT If you want to talk about facts how about the FACT that if you freeze 10 cups of water you will wind up with 11 cups of ice. So let multiply this if you freeze 10,000,000 gallons of water then wouldn't you have 11,000,000 gallons of ice. It is the water expanding when it freezes that makes the icebergs break away from the rest of the ice shelf. When liquid water seeps into the cracks in the ice and then freezes it forces the crack to grow and keeps doing this over and over until it breaks free. <br>  and water is at its greatest density at 4 °C which means that this is the largest it will get.

AA11500132	The idea traces back to Bhudist philosophy, specifically the <br>  Shamballa stories. <br>  ie the problems are caused by our mind, therefore we have the solution too.<br>  <br>  one version from the Kalachakra Tantra, 8th century AD, by Joanna Macy <a href="http://joannamacy.net/html/great.html" rel="nofollow">http://joannamacy.net/html/great.html</a> is:<br>  <br>  "There comes a time when all life on Earth is in danger. Great barbarian powers have arisen. Although these powers spend their wealth in preparations to annihilate one another, they have much in common: weapons of unfathomable destructive power, and technologies that lay waste our world. In this era, when the future of sentient life hangs by the frailest of threads, the kingdom of Shambhala emerges.<br>        You cannot go there, for it is not a place; it is not a geopolitical entity. It exists in the hearts and minds of the Shambhala warriors—that is the term Choegyal used, "warriors." Nor can you recognize a Shambhala warrior when you see her or him, for they wear no uniforms or insignia, and they carry no banners. They have no barricades on which to climb to threaten the enemy, or behind which they can hide to rest or regroup. They do not even have any home turf. Always they must move on the terrain of the barbarians themselves.<br>        Now the time comes when great courage—moral and physical courage—is required of the Shambhala warriors, for they must go into the very heart of the barbarian power, into the pits and pockets and citadels where the weapons are kept, to dismantle them. To dismantle weapons, in every sense of the word, they must go into the corridors of power where decisions are made.<br>        The Shambhala warriors have the courage to do this because they know that these weapons are manomaya. They are "mind-made." Made by the human mind, they can be unmade by the human mind. The Shambhala warriors know that the dangers threatening life on Earth are not visited upon us by any extraterrestrial power, satanic deities, or preordained evil fate. They arise from our own decisions, our own lifestyles, and our own relationships.<br>        So in this time, the Shambhala warriors go into training. When Choegyal said this, Joanna asked, "How do they train?" They train, he said, in the use of two weapons. "What weapons?" And he held up his hands in the way the Iamas hold the ritual objects of dorje and bell in the lama dance.<br>        The weapons are compassion and insight. Both are necessary, he said. You have to have compassion because it gives you the juice, the power, the passion to move. It means not to be afraid of the pain of the world. Then you can open to it, step forward, act. But that weapon by itself is not enough. It can burn you out, so you need the other—you need insight into the radical interdependence of all phenomena. With that wisdom you know that it is not a battle between "good guys" and "bad guys," because the line between good and evil runs through the landscape of every human heart. With insight into our profound inter-relatedness—our deep ecology—you know that actions undertaken with pure intent have repercussions throughout the web of life, beyond what you can measure or discern. By itself, that insight may appear too cool, too conceptual, to sustain you and keep you moving, so you need the heat of compassion. Together these two can sustain us as agents of wholesome change. They are gifts for us to claim now in the healing of our world."|`|15mbP1hqaa	First of all to be exact technology DESTOYS the environment.<br>  <br>  After that, we all agree that the technology could save WHAT LEFT.<br>  <br>  And indeed, certain "green" technologies are doing exactly this.

5c127f052b6bfa757d067568c8afa6c3aa	He is quite correct that current co2 levels are low. The problem here is he is probably reffering to a wide range of published sources rather than cherry picking only one data set like the Vostok ice core often cited by alarmists. <br>  <br>  The Vostok icecores show co2 levels so low at points it would have killed of plant life when we know that didnt happen, according to Jarowski, the Vostock ice core melted during shipment and then re-froze hence its un-reliable (water absorbs co2). Jarowski, 1992.<br>  <br>  Lets look at co2 levels from some other ice cores not often quoted by alarmists from the current interglacial:<br>  <br>  Coachman et al, 1956         200 - 2900ppm<br>  Scholander, 1961               100 - 2000ppm<br>  Matsuo & Miyake, 1966      280 - 2900ppm<br>  Neftel, 1982                       300 - 2350ppm<br>  Raynaud & Delmas, 1977   900 - 1800ppm<br>  Berner, 1978                      400 - 1200ppm<br>  Stauffer, 1981                    250 - 1000ppm<br>  <br>  Why didnt Al Gore use any of these in his film? Looking at the above papers, his comments are well justified.<br>  <br>  Beck, 2007 also shows 540ppm in 1820 and Beyer et. al., 2001 also shows co2 levels up to 550ppm at times. Callenders raw data (before values that didnt fit his hypothesis were removed- see Fonselius et. al., 1956) also supports Becks work. <br>  <br>  Go back further and during the Cambrian era co2 levels were around 7600ppm and during the end of the Ordovician and beginning of the Silurian eras co2 was around 4500ppm (12 times todays level) during the coldest period of the last 500,000,000 years. (Scotese & Berner, 2001)<br>  <br>  So you could conclude from the above papers that co2 is at least  at normal levels (i.e. its not at an unusually high level) and on a longer timescale it is at a low. The IPCC only look at information that supports their argument and hence most alarmists have only a narrow view on such matters such as historic co2 levels, it is the reason geologists are normally skeptics, they know co2 levels are not unusual as are temperatures and the rate of change.<br>  <br>  Claims life is unadapted to higher levels is outright rediculous(are there any serious scientific papers to support this view?), especially considering alot of studies show co2 levels are often higher than current. If co2 doubles to form 0.054% of the air we breathe compared to the current 0.038% does anyone seriously believe life will struggle because its not used to it? <br>  <br>  Co2 benefits plant growth and thus the entire food chain, they use co2 at 1000ppm in growing houses for faster and enhanced growth. Co2 levels would have to reach very high levels such as 10,000ppm before humans (and am guessing most animals) would notice the rise (it would make certain people slightly drowsy at these levels). Of course if it rose slowly over thousands of years to these levels, those better adapted to higher co2 levels would prevail through natural selection allowing life to adapt. Just like animals adapted to previous climate shifts.|`|34BQRUMqaa	Perhaps you should choose a source other than prisonplanet for your science information.  Here's a few other things (somehow missing from their report) Dr. Happer said: "I am not a climatologist ... The combustion of fossil fuels, coal, oil and natural gas, has contributed to the increase of CO2 in the atmosphere. And finally, increasing concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere will cause the earth’s surface to warm."<br>  <br>  Dr. Happer is a respected expert in spectroscopy, but his knowledge of climate science in no way is sufficient for him to somehow overrule several decades of peer reviewed scientific research by 1000's of practicing climate scientists from around the world.<br>  <br>  There were also 3 other people that testified the same day.  Care to guess how they testified?<br>  <br>  And as far as Gore firing him, that's the most ludicrous and silly propaganda I've ever heard.

Whatever...<br>  <br>  The IPCC and the AGW base their understanding of atmospheric CO2 based on ice cores.  Here is the problem, they don't account for the tremendous pressures of the ice as you drill deeper which can as you get deep down destroy CO2.  It doesn't account for liquid water which can traverse under glaciers even in frigid Antartica.  It doesn't account for the contamination of the core by drilling fluid.  It doesn't account for the fact that once drilled out the pressure is relieved and the ice actually explodes releasing who knows what?  No one knows how reliable the ice core data is because every grant to study this has been denied.  Do the governments of this world know something we don't, probably.  Also the IPCC disregards the last two hundred years of data.  Very convenient for them since the data shows the CO2 level to be much higher in the preindustrial period than they recognize.  Also, Co2 levels have been measured using instrumentation for the last two hundred years, this data disagrees with the IPCC but does agree with the last two hundreds years of ice core samples.<br>  <br>  You don't have to fudge the data if it's real.|`|NqGkbDetaa	Dana said:  "...  this is one physicist's opinion, which is in contradiction with the opinions of tens of thousands of other physicists."<br>  <br>  I'd like to see the list of names.

The history of earth shows that we are now at a time of much less CO2 than is normal.  Only someone with an obvious lack of education or someone with an agenda could possibly deny anything he said.  It is not like he made any wild claims.  He simply stated facts about the atmosphere based on evidence from geological studies.   No one with a science degree should have any problem with any of it.

The manufacturing process requires about 17.3 terawatts of electricity annually. Also, there is the energy and materials involved in packaging and transporting the toilet paper to households across the country.<br>  <br>  Toilet paper also constitutes a significant load on the city sewer systems, and water treatment plants. It is also often responsible for clogged pipes. In septic systems, the elimination of toilet paper would mean the septic tank would need to be emptied much less often. <br>  <br>  Basically, the huge industry of producing toilet paper could be eliminated through the use of bidets. Instead of using toilet paper, a bidet cleans your posterior using a jet of water.
