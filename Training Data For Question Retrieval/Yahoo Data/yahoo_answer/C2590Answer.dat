AsPiALOpaa	alexwpa4, Let me start out by saying I'm not mechanically inclined when it comes to auto repair. Last week I had some problems with my Pontiac Aztek and I wasn't sure how to fix them. I tried to search the web for help, but the procedures were way too difficult for my skills. I ended up going to the dealship for my repairs. The dealership tends to charge more than mom and pop repair shops, but they've seen all sorts of situations ( insurance problems, repair warranty issues, etc) and they seem to always find a way to help me. Maybe you can try calling auto repair shops in California to see if they can help you. <a href="http://www.autorepairshopreview.com/California-Repair-Shops.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.autorepairshopreview.com/Cali...</a>|`|CoArPsIGaa	As far as I know its all legal.   Some Chevrolet trucks have quadrasteer built on when you buy them.
WO68RZdIaa	No, not in CT or any of the other states is it legal to drive by yourself with only a learner's permit.<br>  <br>  If stopped you can be cited for driving without a license, kiss any chance of getting your license until you turn 18 (or even 21 in some states), have the car impounded & you will incur very expensive fines, fees, cost & points on your permit. Not what you want to see on your driving record before you even have your license.|`|CoArPsIGaa	As far as California goes you have to have some one 25 or older driving with you unless your parents sign a paper saying you can only drive to and from school and that's it.|`|5FBlKfQzaa	No. Don't try it, when you get busted. You aren't allowed to drive for a year and with fine! <br>  <br>  You have to have a licensed driver in the car with you|`|jYy6dDAZaa	No, it is a learners permit with no teacher or guide.|`|1165EaAhaa	no|`|31Ttgqlbaa	No, you need a license driver sitting beside you.
AA10788612	That would depend on the city you intend to use it in. Taxi's are heavily regulated.
qjEx8esgaa	because he thinks that you will eff it up and it will like crap i guess|`|556cc214a7493962346e6f458688b23baa	Stock paint is two- component epoxy type with a clear coat of the same kind of stuff over it.  Its very hard and most paint won't stick to it or have the deep shine.|`|FpT7x2VVaa	your dad is correct. and when you sell, original paint, even if worn a bit in places is better than a "paint-over".<br>  to do it correctly, you would need to bring the bike down to bare metal for the metal parts and then have the whole done professionally.|`|UON9xYvAaa	I'm affraid you need to listen to your dad. Stock paint is ALWAYS worth more, even if its done well, because its always what you like, not what the new owner may like.<br>  Also, to paint bike you'd need the paint (￡200-300) and a compresser and air gun, or another way, but still around another ￡200 so nearly ￡500 for tools, you'll be sanding and prepping and stripping for days, lots of hard work.<br>  Then, when your done (assuming you've got some skill painting it in the first place,) you need to sand again, final coat, then buy loads of clear laquer.......<br>  Phew!<br>  Leave the paint alone brother, just get some good shampoo and wax, give it some tlc...|`|I9WjPm7Caa	If YOU paint it it will look like crap, it will peel and it will bring down the resale value. Been there, done that, got the t-shirt to prove it. <br>  <br>  If you have it painted by a professional shop, they will sand it down to bare metal & plastic, paint it any way you like and put clear-coat over it. They will charge like hell, though. Resale value ... well, if you find a buyer who shares your esthetic tastes you may get a break, but you won't recoup the money you gave to the paint shop.<br>  <br>  If you want to personalise your bike in a reversible way, consider stickers instead.|`|CAPIITJFaa	if i see a painted bike i assume it has been wrecked, rule #1 never buy used bike with custom paint, most are actually custom paint jobs, many have been wrecked, buyer beware, it will lower resale value
5xxuKzXPaa	the computer will correct for the increased air supply, you might look into a few sensors though. in a NA engine, the computer looks at vacuum to calculate the amount of air needed. when you add a turbo that vacuum disappears and  pressure develops. this difference by it self will cause you  a head ache. in a 5 psi system i believe that the stock system can handle that much of a change as long as the computer knows what is going on.|`|1xkc6Ktmaa	Usually the computer can handle a little more air. If the computer can't it is usually due to the flow being higher than the airflow sensor can handle.
DFTB95BQaa	Mazda is the unknown gem of the auto industry. We are on our third one. A 3 this time. I don't know today's 6 but Mazdas are really very good cars. We had a 323 a while back that we gave to one of our sons with over 180,000 miles on it. 7 years later that car is still running...|`|bSDEQhozaa	No Mazda's are ****,<br>  buy a toyota, Honda or nissan there all good.?<br>  <br>  but stay away from mazda, Citroen, fiat and renault.:)|`|0qGsS5hJaa	fhhfjghfgjhf|`|lTnrjAXfaa	I personally have never owned one, but I know Mazda does manufacture, on their majority, good quality cars. And I've heard the Mazda 6 is indeed on par with its competition, the Camry, Accord, and Altima. So yes, it is a good car.|`|H7r2kcctaa	My dad has a Mazda6 and it's a great car. Definitely recommend looking into it.
UJJn1HeQaa	no.
U638GHIWaa	i will tell you this first i strongly suggest you take a motorcycle course such as ride with pride as i did. you will learn the best way to handle a bike in a safe manner . and it helps towards your insurance. im from newyork. i took the course in buffalo the fee is worth the certificate. plus when you pass the course you will get your license with the certificate just take it to dmv. they will issue you your license in a few days. plus a discount on your insurance.as to your question it dont matter which one you get first just be safe and ride with extreme caution.|`|CoArPsIGaa	No it doesn't matter which one you get first. In california you can be 15 and get or m1 license.
3NEf45Ncaa	hubcaps|`|Ibj3g2wfaa	Wheel Covers if they cover the whole rim, <br>  Hub Caps if they are smaller and leave some rim exposed.|`|ac227dd2eb3e39dd147d25a06099bebeaa	or center caps on alum. wheels|`|7aa811d41efd8b148b1813352fd326f3aa	wheel covers or hub caps|`|qXaihEiNaa	Do You Mean Alloys?<br>  there the fancy thing in the middle.
HIvDN7T0aa	Factory is best.<br>  <br>  If you can't get one, get a Wix or Napa Gold.<br>  <br>  Failing that, I'd go for a Mobil 1, K&N<br>  <br>  <br>  Fram would be the absolute last choice on my list.  I'd rather drain the dirty oil from a Toyota filter and re-use it than install a Fram filter.|`|DBcy7Jk3aa	factory toyota or fram but honestly if you use any filter and change your oil regualarly you wont have any problems.|`|q5VJM74Daa	A factory OEM one.  I THINK the part number is still 90915-YZZG1 or 90915-YZZD1.  When its something that cheap in price, always stick with OEM (At the dealer the oil filter will be no more than 5-6 bucks)<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!
U24VtSlZaa	It's one of three things:  lost compression, inadequate spark or fuel starvation.<br>  <br>  Starting with the easy stuff first:<br>  1.  Is the fuel fresh and free of water and debris?<br>  2.  Does the fuel line hold pressure?  After it dies, is the primer bulb still firm?  Does it restart easily?<br>  3.  Try pumping the primer bulb as you start to accelerate.  <br>  a.  If the bulb is collapsing (won't open back up after you squeeze it with the motor running), then you have an obstruction upstream of the bulb, or else a faulty bulb.<br>  b.  If doing that makes it run better, rebuild your fuel pump (kit about $10 on iboats.com, about 30 minutes labor).<br>  4.  Does the timer base (starboard side, under the flywheel, linked to the throttle bellcrank at the top)  move smoothly without sticking all the way to its stop when you advance the throttle?<br>  5.  When you advance the throttle, does the timer base start its motion *before* the throttle valve(s) start to open?<br>  6.  There's a plastic bushing linking the spark advance rod (the wire that pushes the timer base) to the throttle lever;  if it breaks it can cause funny symptoms.<br>  7.  Compression test:  On a motor of that vintage, look for PSI upwards of 110 (although some of the V-4's are low compression by design, might be in the 90's), but the difference between cylinders is more important than actual numbers.  If all the cylinders are 80, that's better than, say, 125, 125, 120 and 110.  If bad compression is causing your symptom, you'll have one with very very low compression.<br>  8.  Spark test (not a "spark plug" test) -- spark should jump a 7/16" gap on an inline tester (couple bucks at autozone) with a sharp blue spark.<br>  <br>  If all of the above checks out, then rebuild the carburetors.  If it fails one of the tests, ask for the next step in a new question.<br>  <br>  That's all I can tell you without knowing what horsepower motor we're talkin bout.<br>  <br>  Don't worry, that's a great motor, you'll have it up & running in no time.|`|iTj5NdH1aa	Make sure you are running good clean fresh fuel to this engine. Don't start tearing into it right away, always check the simple things like this first. Most engines I deal with have issues that come from bad fuel.|`|T93v5Urbaa	sounds like you to rebuild the carbs first
S4soZUFCaa	Beetle, Civic, Focus, Scion|`|XZcsn4qIaa	the best car jeep because that is what i am getting tomorrow|`|aaiPjDg0aa	Look up Jettas and the new beetles. I'm sure theres used ones out there!! :D|`|DoKXlLL3aa	Try going on Craig's List :)<br>  Or look in the paper for ads.|`|SHwuzsPyaa	since when were cars cute?
gjAZeRyfaa	Honda Civic<br>  Toyota Corolla<br>  Honda Fit<br>  Toyota Yaris<br>  Toyota Matrix|`|noUGE5Jmaa	Nissan Versa|`|0h9uzBkRaa	renult clio , a really nice car :) x
OgvkF5mvaa	Mobil 1 synthetic is MOtor oil not Auto tranny fluid<br>  or imnot understanding ur Q<br>  but its a good motor oil and so is Royal Purple thats wat i run on my civic|`|SOfbIOzUaa	Don't do it.<br>  Use ONLY Honda ATF<br>  <br>  I do use Mobil 1 synthetic motor oil in my engines. 0W30 in our 96 Accord and 0W20 in our 02 CR-V|`|5292abb319ba6bd0ffbcbc5bfe673ff0aa	Stick with the Honda fluid.
HUNOS1yUaa	You can't go wrong with a Honda Civic.  Fit is probably more of a subcompact.  Civic will cost more.  However, you can buy a used 2007 Civic for about $13,000.  Civics have great mileage (about 28 mpg), excellent braking, 5 star ratings for frontal crash (driver & passenger), side air bags and reliability that is tops in the industry.|`|AA10788612	The best of the best is the Honda Fit. Very compact, extremely reliable, & gets killer mpg's.
uDsACcFCaa	try to polish the glass using a glass polishing paste.<br>  <br>  if you want a homemade fix, try buffing it out using a mixture of three parts toothpaste and one part powdered baking soda. let it sit for 5 minutes and just rinse it off.|`|yaq7oaH6aa	No. Baking soda is softer than glass. <br>  It might remove dirt, not scratches.<br>  There are polishing compounds sold for the purpose.<br>  You need a very fine optical grade compound or you make it worse.<br>  Don't try to improvise.
3MTYGEbWaa	There's about four problems here:<br>  1) You are not 18 years old, which is required for a loan<br>  2) Even if you were 18, you would need a good credit score and good job<br>  3) No bank or loan company will provide a loan for that old of a car<br>  4) No bank will loan you more than 100% of a car's value, and I have to assume that $6000 for a 80's model car is WAY over priced<br>  <br>  In cases like this, it's usually the family that provides the loan. But make sure you aren't overpaying for that old car.|`|AA10788612	Banks don't give out loans for cars that old & that amount. There's no profit in it. And even though you say the car is nice, they won't.|`|AA11275863	Maybe at a buy here pay here lot.|`|c11fee07c98ac2e271f2ab5acd400781aa	Not a chance.<br>  <br>  The bank loan value on something that old is NOT $6,000.

AA11665535	i'm guessing the problem wasn't the brake sensor, but the wiring to it. I'd contact local ford dealer and see about getting a new "pigtail' and replace the part of the wiring that connects to that sensor.|`|teAtI3Itaa	bad brake light switch, or wires to it are breaking
Rwn0svq0aa	Sarah,<br>  <br>  It is a good car. Routine maintenance will make you a happy owner to a reliable car that will serve your purposes well into the 200,000 mile mark before major repairs will come into play.  It is more than adequate to manage whatever assignments related to your personal transportation to school.  A well maintained car will benefit you in the long run. Don't just drive the car. Have the tires balanced and rotated, making sure they are properly inflated. Change the oil in the car every 3-5,000 miles. Have the radiator fluid changed every 30,0000 miles and the same with the transmission fluid of any car and you will be a happy young lady.<br>  <br>  For your purposes, their is no "cons" to the car. It is a perfect car for a student. It is a keeper.  Good luck with your studies.|`|AA11252691	i have Mazda6 2.3L 2006, i got it new before 3 years and now done 100,000 km without any major faults except oil, breaks, tires, its a vgood cat reliable, no any cons tell now:-) go a head
IHM4rlh4aa	Even older Camrys can provide years of good service. Get the car checked out by someone who knows them before you buy.|`|RQzsmvfiaa	Being that you are asking this question, you obviously haven't heard about Camry's stellar reputation for reliability. How lucky can you be to know little about the car and still pick one of the most dependable cars on the planet? Your woman's intuiton most be guiding you.|`|HR0mXBFMaa	Of course toyotas are really reliable. i own a 97 toyota corolla and it has 130,000 km on it and hasnt broken down even once! so i would totally recommend the toyota camry!

I was assigned auto mechanics in school because I have mechanical Aptitude and inclination, and a prodigy at anything electrical.<br>  Upon completion, you will get a inspection certificate and Diploma. No what no one is going to explain to you is, when you go into this REAL WORLD, you may not get into a dealership, with air-conditioning, Excellent co-workers, you may end up working in a gas station with very cold conditions in winter, like as cold as it is outside, or as Hot as it is outside and you will have to deal with it. Hot engine diagnostics make it very hot in summer and depending on what you work on, you may Burn yourself badly, can you leave ? Well maybe, will you leave when you have two or more kids to feed at home and your working commission, yes, paid by the car, when finished, you get paid for the work on that car, even dealerships do this and exclusively. Only class (C) and (B) mechanics make hourly pay, not class (A) mechanics.<br>  I worked a 1 bay shop, a 2 bay shop, a 3 bay shop. We had very extreme conditions at this privately owned establishment. Ice cold, Very Hot summer. Mechanics throw tools aggressivley at each other, its not funny when a newby comes and takes a tool to borrow and gets hit in the face rendering him 25 stitches. All because he didnt get laid with his wife last-night. This is all I am about to disclose too you, good luck, this brings back way too many memories.|`|nm8IrW25aa	a lot of what jim has said is very true. I was lucky I got a start in a dealership and have only worked for dealers. I have delt alot of trainies fresh out of schools. The teachers all seem to tell the same lie " you will make 100k fixing cars". Let me tell you now you wont. <br>  Its a hard job. Long days and bad weather unless its 70 outside and you got lucky to get a car thats not just been driven 30 miles and is still hot.<br>  By the time your in your 30's your hands,neck and back will hert all day and all night.<br>  The general population of the planet will view you as no more then a crook tring to rip them off. Most of the rest will look down on you as low class uneducated drop out scum of the earth.<br>  The pay well that another issue. Most of us get paid on a flatrate scale. how flate rate works is simple you get a job that pays an hours labor and you finish it in 15 min you get paid for 1 hour of work. Now that sounds great till you look at the flip side. That same 1 hour job now took you 4 hours to complete, guess what you get paid.... thats right 1 hour labor.<br>  <br>  so now to awnser some of your other questions.<br>  <br>  Do auto mechanics make money:<br>  you ever go to a pawn shop and see all the snap on tools they have... gotta pay the bill some how and lately the local pawn shops seem to have more tools.  <br>  Starting out you will more then likely make less then 20k a year. <br>  your 3rd year you may make your way to 30k. <br>  There are some that earn 70,80,100k a year but we are few in numbers. and it gets harder and harder each year.<br>  mentally and physically demanding?<br>  Keeping up with new technology ,new diagnosis methods, service bullitins, service messages, recalls, labor time studies, and leagel practices is no easy task. The phsical side is even worse. The lifting, the bending, the weater, the poor lighting, all the pissed off people all the time (noone ever want to come see you, they have no choice).<br>  It will still be around as long as there is a car on the road. <br>  <br>  is it enjoyable?<br>  Well thats all a matter of opinion. Most of us love what we do. Where else can you play with fire, take apart other peoples stuff, and drive there cars and not wind up in jail for doing it. <br>  The best advise is to go to a few local shops and find the person with an engine in pices and ask him. Then decide for yourself what is right for you|`|CoArPsIGaa	Well this all depends on where you plan to work and if you plan to start your own buss.  Is it enjoyable.  Yes if you like getting dirty and if you like to do different things. Most times you will get different stuff to deal with everyday.     And well I would recomend becoming a desiel mechanic. It seems like desiel is going to be around longer.  After a while it will become a little physical and mentaly demanding it dempends on the tools you have and how long your gonna be workin.|`|xK1uq6vNaa	If you work for flatrate you must get fast enough to do as many repairs as possible. The lead mechanics in a dealership will pick all of the cherry jobs. You will end up with the more undesirable jobs until you get experience.Also at flatrate if no cars come in, you don't make any money. If you live in a well populated area that shouldn't be a problem. Learn to repair driveability problems, much cleaner work, also , working on imports pays more. The work is respectable. There are drunks in every line of work, don't let that stop you.

YLajQcFkaa	Before I get into this try turning the big nut CLOCKWISE to strengthen the safety clutch.  If it is turning and not making a popping noise,,,,<br>  <br>  Ok you have the pop up, I don't pay attention to the extremely rust prone years.  Like pre 1982.  I don't recall that they popped up but oh well.  Basically its the same but now you have to deal with the little catches that pull the headliner up with the sunroof. Really the sunroof motor is in the trunk?  I may be WAY WAY WAY off.  Peugeot does that not BMW that I recall.  But like I said I shun the old rusty year BMWs.  I would like to forget everything I learned 20 years ago about thoes years bmws<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Well its not actually a difficult sunroof since it does not have the pop up feature.  Basically you pop down the front of the headliner piece down and slide it back then there are 4 screws that hold the metal part to the car remove those and lift the sunroof off.  Remove the screws that cover the cables and clean them and lube them up with Vaseline. Good idea to get a new sunroof seal to reduce the chance of wind noise.  That should get ya going if the motor is still good. You may need to remove the motor access cover and give the big nut a turn clockwise to strengthen the safety clutch.|`|ESWqGNtiaa	its one of the servo's, take it to a mechanic|`|O9r3lP24aa	sounds like a servo or something.

f1zTpzjKaa	The answer to your primary question, unlike some answers given is yes.<br>  <br>  It is perfectly possible for someone to own a car and someone else insure it - This is perfectly normal, for example, lease cars are owned by the leasing company but are insured by the keeper.<br>  <br>  When you mention your mom putting it on an existing policy, this sounds harder.  There are very few companies that offer a single policy to cover more than one car and so this is unlikely to happen.<br>  <br>  More likely is that what you mean is that she will insure the car in her name with you as a named driver.  This is not legitimate.  It is called fronting and is fraud.  I would strongly recommend that if this is the case you seek insurance in your own name.  I am sure you know people who do insre in their parents name but be aware that the insurance industry disputes in court over a thousand claims a year because of fronting.<br>  <br>  In short, you don't have to be the owner of a car to insure it but you do need to be the main driver.|`|yaq7oaH6aa	If you live in the same household, yes, otherwise, no.<br>  Insurance goes with the Title to the car, and covers <br>  the owner.

Because hearing was difficult at best ,impossible more likely. Soloing marked the point to which this wass no longer necessary, as it was no longer needed so to speak, it became tradition that the instructor cut the back of the shirt off to celebrate the event.<br>  <br>  I am not aware of the "get drenched" tradition.
ac227dd2eb3e39dd147d25a06099bebeaa	honestly you should go to a auto paint store the ones here are indrustral finishes and ask for a brand called SEM its made for interior of cars also remember to use "lacqur thinner" or a wax and greese remover before you start painting also spend the extra cost for a can of "it's in a rattle or spraycan also by the quart or gallon" of stuff called bull dog its makes paint stick to plastic with out flaking or pealing which is what would happen if you dont use this promoter. but a semi flat black is what the factory would have sprayed and always looks great but also grey or silver is also a good color.

Also, 9 is called "niner." Other numbers are pronounced normally. Runways with double digit headings are referred to one number at a time. For example, LGA's runway 22 is called runway two-two, not twentytwo, and runway 31 is called three-one. Gate 9 in terminal C is labeled C9 and called "charlie niner" during radio communication. You should look up the NATO phonetic alphabet, lots of information in there.
Rwn0svq0aa	Mazda likes to say it's car has the "soul of a sports car". Mazda cars are known to have responsive engines with great handling characteristics. They are billed to have a sporty feel. A sports car would be the Mazda Mx5, a two seat rear wheel drive 2.0 liter engine package with a stick shift.  A Chevrolet Corvette is a sports car. A Mazda 6 has sports car flavor but thats about it.|`|yEt3ofnhaa	In my opinion the definition of sports car is what you think. Not was KKB or edmunds tell you. In my opinon though it is. That car is looks nice and handles well. You could call a Mercury Sable Wagon a sports car and get away with it. It is all about what you think.|`|AA11252691	comparing mazda6 to cars in the same category (camry, accord, sonata, altima, etc...) yes it is a sporty car, shorter gear ratio, sportier design exterior and interior, harder suspension system, sharp handling and road catching, so relatively mazda6 is a sport car...

DLDHx6lnaa	When it comes to mopeds and sub-50cc scooters, you don't have to worry about which one is good for learning in the same way that you do for motorcycles.  None of them will have too much power for you to handle, and they all have automatic transmission, which makes them universally easy to operate.  Choose one within your price range from a reliable company like Honda.  If you can, test drive it at a dealership to see if it is right for you; but again, most scooters are more of the "one size fits most" type than are motorcycles.<br>  <br>  Many things are the same between scooters and motorcycles.  Unfortunately, the scooter/moped industry has billed these machines as somehow safer than motorcycles because you can't go as fast, but you can be sure that 30mph is plenty quick to peel off your skin or get yourself killed in a crash.  Wear all of the same protective clothing that you would on a motorcycle, including a helmet and motorcycle jacket, pants, gloves, and boots.  The MSF offers one day classes for scooters in most states.  These courses are similar to those offered for motorcycles, except that you generally need to bring your own scooter.  Take one if it is available in your area, and if not try to learn from somebody who knows what they are doing before you take this (plenty dangerous) machine out on the road.

KbbL1Wemaa	Craigslist is your best bet I think.  Vehix.com also has some cheap local listings.  As far as what car I would recommend, I would definitely say either a Honda or a Toyota.  Honda's and Toyota's last forever, and they get great gas mileage, especially Hondas.  I would go for a Honda Civic, Honda Accord, or a Toyota Camry.  Plus, you can ususally find an older and used model of one of these around the $2000 range.  I'd just keep checking Craigslist on a daily basis.  <br>  <br>  Hope that helps!|`|FsT54qh1aa	You can try autotrader.com too. I would suggest getting yourself into a Toyota Corolla.

ojxfzv7Faa	It will only need more fixing as it gets older. It will soon start needing repairs that cost more than what your vehicle is worth, if it isn't at that point now. You're just dropping more money into something that isn't worth it. Go get your Subaru, it's very solid car brand. It'll be more expensive than a $3k repair at first, but you'll be getting a car that will handle your driving demands and probably won't need any repairs anytime soon.|`|4zZzZ30waa	Sell it if the car has MOT and tax.  3k is a lot of money for a car of 10years old with that Mileage.<br>  and with you travelling quite a lot change it, avoid the hassle and unnecessary stress and costs|`|1waQfvV0aa	id try to get a new car.. thats alot of miles. but i dont know alot about cars.

BAN3dRcAaa	I believe you are not getting the right code. Unplug the green connector and find the black single-wire connector under the dash by the steering column and by the ECM and TCM. It is sometimes a bit difficult to find as there is quite a lot of harness there that it sticks out of and only for a few inches. When plugged in it will give the correct code by flashing the "check engine" light. Once the repair is done and you want to clear the code, then plug the green in also and drive the car for a few blocks at forty mph or more and the flashing will go to a sustained and repeated four long flashes. Stop, unplug both the green and the black with the key off, restart, and there should be no more check-engine light.
2XusVa4jaa	I was a Saturn tech for 10 years. Contrary to what everybody says, they are great little cars! My daughter has a 96 SL 2 with 176,000 on it and it runs great! The best thing you can do is open your owners manual and go by the "Severe Maintenance Service Schedule". The thing the S Series cars were known for was burning oil. Due to lack of maintenance(oil changes), the oil control rings stick. 3 months or 3000 miles on your oil changes. Good Luck and enjoy your car!|`|HUluAQM3aa	Regular oil changes, every 3500 to 5000 miles.  USe a good quality oil.<br>  Follow the manufactures guidelines for regular maintenance.<br>  <br>  Rotate tires once a year.<br>  Air filter once a year.<br>  Inspect the drive belts and the engine coolant.<br>  Change engine coolant every three years.<br>  <br>  Under the hood is a white sticker with some guidelines for maintainace as well.<br>  <br>  There is not much to say really.  Modern cars do not require us to be under the hood that often|`|RiQA4Epraa	its a saturn, its not gonna last long<br>  <br>  and you dont need to change it every 3 months<br>  change it every 5,000/ 6months<br>  whichever comes first<br>  <br>  fuel filter, every 30k<br>  air filter, every 20k
crhJLuw5aa	The 2.2 engine has hydraulic lifters. It's not normal for ANY car with hydraulic lifters to have any valve noise at all. It may just need an oil change. If that doesn't do the trick. then you have a more serious problem.<br>  <br>  The valves are non-adjustable on your engine (and on almost ALL engines with hydraulic lifters), and it is NOT part of your routine maintenance schedule.|`|mQWn7NGaaa	i have had noisy valve lifters "kick" a knock sensor in the past. this causes the computor to retard the timing and you will lose performance.|`|5IvxBEr9aa	It's normal to an extent. You should hear it slightly, but it shouldn't be crazy loud.<br>  <br>  It's probably time to adjust your valve lash. It's very simple, and part of your cars routine maintenance.

L6MLYMkhaa	I'd sell your vehicle on AutoTrader.com.  That is a very great auto classified!  You can post pictures, list features, and <br>  probably get some good buyers. <br>  <br>  That's good that you are going to sell it privately (assuming that you are way upside down).  Try to find the value of your truck in  www.kellybluebook.com or www.edmund.com.  Compare the selling prices of your same make and model in your area, then come up with a for sale price of your vehicle.  The lower the miles, better the condition, the more buyers you'll attract.<br>  <br>  You can trade it in, but the dealership is going to have a field day with you, b/c they will take much less than the truck is worth, give you the car that you want (assuming lesser in cost), and dump the negative equity on top of the new loan of the lesser car.<br>  <br>  If you sell it private, you can get at least what it's worth, pay off the loan that you owe, and pay of the remainder of the loan.  Bam you're at square one.<br>  <br>  I also doubt you will find buyers for a truck given the gas prices.  I totally feel bad for the financial burden you have.  Sure you're not the only American with a gas guzzler wanting a cheaper vehicle.<br>  <br>  Then you have the option of refinancing your vehicle, that will maybe drop your payments down a bit.<br>  <br>  Remember, there are more than one way to skin a cat :-)<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you my dear|`|UJ2bDHeeaa	you can still sell it, but apply the proceeds to your balance.  you may have to pay any difference on your own as likely you owe more than the car will sell for.  if i were buying that car, i'd require to do all the paperwork at the bank that financed yoru car to ensure the title transfer is completed accurately, and the lien is fully satisfied.|`|jU0dGPzUaa	You can't. That's the thing. You need to pay all of your payments before you can sell it. If you sell it, the new owner would have to pay for your payments, which isn't fair.|`|51d9e39c71aaaed7424c9ac49e9069c5aa	Contact the lender. They'll give you all of the information that you need.|`|H7r2kcctaa	Try this: Don't buy things you can't afford. Follow this simple rule, and you'll never find yourself in this situation.|`|3MTYGEbWaa	If you still owe 6 years of payments, I can guarantee you are WAY upside down (owe more than the truck is worth). This means, you can't sell or trade it without having a big chunk of cash to pay off your existing loan. Dealers and loan companies no longer make loans for more than car is worth, so even if you bought a new less expensive car, your would have to make up your negative equity as a large down payment.|`|FsT54qh1aa	You contact your bank and let them know you plan to sell it because you can't keep up with payments. Then you have to find out the realistic blue book value for it.<br>  <br>  www.nada.com<br>  www.kbb.com<br>  <br>    Sell it private party (yourself), so you get the most money for it. If you still owe more than you can sell the car for, you have to figure out how to settle that with the bank. You can ask them to give you a small loan on the difference (what you will still owe), and you can make payments to them on it until the debt is settled.<br>     You can also take it to a dealership and trade down to a less expensive vehicle. They may be able to roll the amount you owe into the new loan. I wouldn't go that route though, because you would only get trade in value for the truck.
XQvWjkrSaa	This shouldn't be a problem as long as you keep it clean between steps.  If you are working in a garage, then it should be easy.

0ef20eb507f407a9440fce4b72145750aa	After the tow (I have no idea what that will cost) the mechanic will need to determine that is definitely the fuel pump.  With parts and labour (it shouldn't take more than 2 or 3 hrs) the bill shouldn't be more than $500 or $600 - still a pretty bad day for your wallet.  You should also hope there was no more damage done by having your car in and out of a ditch... nice roommate. (more sarcasm)|`|FsT54qh1aa	It really depends on the vehicle....but....assume at least 250-400 for the fuel pump itself...and 4 to 6 hours of labor if they actually have to drop the gas tank.

nD3gKvwOaa	Yes you need to have a regular license in order to get your motorcycle license. In order to take your motorcycle permit test you need to have a regular drivers license. Once you pass your motorcycle permit test you can ride a motorcycle during the day and with no passengers. Once you pass your riding test they will stamp your motorcycle permit and it will be used as a temporary license. You can now ride a motorcycle and drive a vehicle with no restrictions. PennDOT will follow up with you about how to renew your license to show the motorcycle designation on it.<br>  <br>  If you do not yet have a PA drivers license then you might be able to take the permit test for both at the same time, but im pretty sure you would have to take the normal permit test first because that covers all of the rules of the road.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped.

I covered our boat in fiberglass cloth and epoxied resin on the out side and sealed the inside with fiberglass resin on the inside, but we built this boat strong to withstand salt water use.<br>  <br>  on the bottom & sides we used international paints interlux primer as a base coat (two coats) followed by two coats of one part brightside polyurethane paint with light sanding between coats. We used two coats of paint on the inside of the boat.  Good results can be had when two people work together, one painting with a foam roller, the other following with a dry brush smoothing out the paint and preventing drips. We used two qts of bright side, and one coat of primer. <br>  <br>  Boat paint uk has info on painting on their web site. take a look at the FAQ section.  International paint has a good painting guide available.|`|cAMdBtFQaa	For occasional use I would go with just about any enamel which would be acceptable for outdoor use.  Also, I would use a primer coat to seal the wood.  Just be sure you touch up any dings during the year to keep it sealed.  For your boat size you are looking at a little over 196 sq ft of surface, that would put you in the 2 gallon range as I would put 2 coats on the bottom, good paints now are running about 25 to 35 per gallon with primer/sealer at about 15, you would be looking at around $100 depend on prices in your area and if you catch the stuff on sale or not.<br>  The first site is boat paint, the second is regular enamel paint from a hardware.  2 part paints and epoxies are around 200 to 280 a gallon from what I have seen, they work best on fiberglass and concrete.  If at all possible, get an oil based, it seals better, but that may be outdated.|`|GaMiPZ1Eaa	Certainly not the cheapest, but the best paint to use would be an epoxy paint/resin.  It would provide an incredibly strong outer shell to your boat.  Its about $50, and it comes in two parts which you need to mix.

More than likely the dealer has received some factory-to-dealer incentive money, which he is passing along to customers in the form of a price discount.|`|AA11914369	A gimmick to get you in to look at their cars.

32dffe7e0eba9eb2c4e6c9418ec99ba5aa	There are four forces involved in flight:<br>  <br>  Thrust is the force that pushes the airplane forward.  It is provided by the engines.<br>  <br>  Drag is the force that tries to slow the airplane down.  It comes from air resistance: as the plane moves through the air, it has to push the air out of the way, and the air resists this, which produces drag.  Some drag also comes from a reaction to lift (see below).<br>  <br>  Lift is the force that supports the airplane in the air.  It is provided by the wings.  As the wings move forward, they twist the air above them downwards, creating a large swath of downward-moving air behind them. It takes a lot of force to pull air downwards like this, and the force exerted by the wings to do this is countered by the resistance of the air to being pulled down—that resistance tends to push the plane upwards, providing lift.  Put more simply, the wings try to pull the air above them down, and so the air above the wings tries to pull the wings upward, and that keeps the wings (and the rest of the airplane) in the air.<br>  <br>  Finally, gravity is the force that tries to pull the airplane back down to the ground.  The wings produce lift that compensates for gravity to keep the plane flying.<br>  <br>  When drag is equal to thrust, the airplane flies at a constant speed. If drag exceeds thrust, the airplane slows down (as when the throttles are set to idle).  When thrust exceeds drag, the airplane accelerates (as when the throttles are set to full power).<br>  <br>  When lift is equal to gravity, the airplane flies at a constant altitude. When lift is greater than gravity (as during take-off), the airplane climbs. When gravity is greater than lift (as during landing), the airplane descends.|`|51d9e39c71aaaed7424c9ac49e9069c5aa	Take a sheet of typing or printing paper and hold it on two of the corners and let it flop down. Now blow air over the top of the paper between your fingers - the paper rises (!) upwards toward the air flow  because you have created a lower pressure on the top of the paper by blowing away the air that was there. <br>  This is exactly what an airplane wing does.|`|6b67548da9d1a58e2a0266faba9eac8aaa	1. Thrust is the force that moves the airplane forward.<br>  2. Drag opposes thrust.  It is the total of all air resistance of the airplane.  When Thrust and Drag are equal, the airplane is at a constant speed, not accelerating or decelerating.<br>  3. Lift is obviously the force that lifts the airplane.<br>  4. Gravity opposes lift.  When Lift and Gravity are equal, the airplane is<br>  at a constant altitude, not climbing or descending.<br>  The airplane flies because of the shape of it wings and the speed of the<br>  air across the wings.  The wing separates the airflow and the shape creates an "artificial" low pressure area above the wing.  The normal, <br>  higher pressure below the wing can then lift the wing (and airplane.)|`|6Bwejcxfaa	just pretend there was a plane in between the arrows<br>  <br>  <-------- Air resistance/drag  ^Lift takes it up^ ----------------->Thrust<br>                                           Weight pulls it down<br>  <br>  there must be a balance to go at a constant speed or an unbalanced force to accelerate or decelerate. to accelerate you must have the thrust force larger than the drag (air resistance force) and to slow down the Thrust needs to be less than the drag (air resistance) to go up, the lift needs to be greater than the weight and to go down the lift needs to be less than the weight.<br>  <br>  Hope i have helped and please correct me if i am wrong|`|QsOBvOSvaa	Up, down, left, right.

crhJLuw5aa	Lifter noise when cold is NOT normal for the Chevy V-6 engine. Also; this engine has hydraulic lifters, so there IS no lash in the valve train, and it's NOT part of a normal maintenance schedule. If the lifters ever go out of adjustment, it's almost always a sign of a bigger problem that won't be fixed by merely adjusting them.<br>  <br>  How long since you've changed your oil? If you let it go for too long it will start to break down and cause this problem, in which case; if you give it an oil change the problem will probably go away.|`|HUluAQM3aa	Unless you have a bad lifter you need to replace then the noise is typical.<br>  Cold oil, parts have contracted a bit results in elevated noise on start up.<br>  <br>  Make sure you are using the correct grade of oil is about the only sound advice I can offer.<br>  <br>  My Honda does the same thing for about 15 seconds during the cooler days of the year.|`|F4FCBEgzaa	Your 3.8 is a roller lifter motor. Although it's normal for the oil to drain from the system overnight, the lifters shouldn't drain that quickly. It sounds like your lifters might be getting tired and old or maybe just dirty. Change your oil with something lightweight (like 5w-30) & filter and add some Marvel Mystery Oil (or some other high detergent additive) to the crankcase per directions. This should help clean out any accumulated dirt/varnish in the lifters. Change them again after 1500 miles. If it helps, repeat and then go back to your normal oil change. If it doesn't help, you may have more serious problems with your lifters. Do not use motor honey or any additive to thicken the oil and quiet the noise until you have tried this method.|`|kdjc0F2Yaa	you might be on your way to more problems, but first i would try an additive... when changing oil substitute one quart of oil for some lucas oil additive, it will thicken the oil and lube better, or you may have carbon on the valves, use a fuel additive or buy a couple of tanks of premo gas, magor brands are better, bp, chevron, texeco..etc|`|5IvxBEr9aa	a little bit of valve ticking is normal upon warm up, but it shouldn't be very loud.

Using any other grade when premium is not available is alright. It says right in the manual.|`|PAceoX2oaa	If it's a turbocharged Eclipse, use ONLY premium unleaded gas. Using a lower octane than the car is designed for will result in detonation and knock, which can kill your power and over time destroy your engine.|`|3N0lANBKaa	4 cylinder uses Regular/Unleaded<br>  6 cylinder uses Premium/Supreme|`|uKr6TFxNaa	gasoline ore propane
5IvxBEr9aa	It's 100% fine to change from synthetic to conventional, but bad to change from conventional to synthetic.|`|FsT54qh1aa	Yes. Sometimes, people say it isn't the best idea to use synthetic oil on higher mileage engines that have used conventional oil for the course of its life because it affects engine seals and causes small leaks. I've never heard it the other way around though. You should be fine going back to conventional.|`|gebIjqnWaa	Basically you should not mix the oils but from oil change to oil change, it is okay because I do it all the time. Conventional oil won't give you as much protection as synthetic oil but in the proper viscosity and changed at the appropriate intervals any good oil will accomplish it's purpose. If you change to conventional oil use the same viscosity as synthetic.|`|wRJZk3k6aa	I am a mechanic and know for a fact their is no problems switching oils, it is all based on myths about switching from one to another.  Synthetic oil is actually made from normal oil and is further refined and modified and called synthetic.  But there is no problem between switching them.  A long time ago when they were truly synthetic oil it would cause a lot of issues with compatibility with each oil.  They would foam up when mixed and caused a lot of issues, but is now not the case.  And anything about switching oils in an older car is a myth, my 243,000 mileage car and 198,000 have been on synthetic for the last 8,000-24,000 miles with no problems at all.  Too many myths going around.

That's that metal box about 5" by 5". the one with the red pilot light button on it.<br>  <br>  When you're through working on it, take a mixture of 50% water and 50% dish soap, and slop it on all the places you loosened up. If you see any bubbles, you have a leak that MUST be fixed; unless of course you want to make the 6:00 news tonight.|`|uKr6TFxNaa	typically it means your thermocoupling is bad its the small cylinder object with wire on it directly over pilot light they get "burned out" easy to change if you are halfway handy dangerous to change if you dont know squat..get a repairman|`|3be70dec6db5e574a7f07a63a50ebe41aa	One of 3 things usually. <br>   The sensor that the pilot light hits is loose or bad.<br>   The thermostat isn't working.<br>   You have an exhaust fan that's not coming on, or an exhaust fan sensor that's bad.

Two completely different concerns.|`|ludSMGrgaa	You’ll need a new engine
RWjvcCYoaa	No. Most used car warranties cover only the drivetrain for a specific period. And only if the needed repair is due to mechanical and/or parts failure. It doesn't cover normal wear and tear items such as brakes.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind tire stores are notorious for upselling. Employees are trained to sell more than just tires. And it usually means bonus cash to the person who gets you to approve the additional services. Your brakes could very well be 50% worn, not 70%.|`|8GDBr2U9aa	Brakes are designed to wear out and warranties do not typically cover consumable items, like tires, belts, hoses and brakes.|`|FsT54qh1aa	No. You can't give a perfect percentage estimate on brake pad wear.

Just soak the hell out of the area with it, let it sit for 5 or 10 minutes....then blot it up. Keep repeating it until the stains are gone.|`|7L0zp7O6aa	I would try a good steam cleaner.

8f85dcd92e8f3f82943075a31b9dd135aa	First off, assess if the seat is safe to use. Why are the straps missing? Did you purchase it used? When a seat has been in a wreck, sometimes someone will cut the straps/remove to try and make sure no one else tries to use the seat again since its unsafe to use a seat after its been in a car accident.<br>  <br>  Is the seat less than 6 years old? Most car seats expire 6 years after date of manufacture and then need to be thrown away. <br>  <br>  If something bad just happened to the straps and you want new ones (like if they're badly stained) just contact the manufacturer (go to the Cosco website) and order new straps. You may need to call the customer service number to order them. you will need the serial number and model number and date of manufacture of the seat. It will be on a label on the seat.<br>  <br>  Search for Dorel Juvenile Products online, they make the Cosco seats.|`|wpgRMjgraa	Try this site it may help you.......<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.coscojuvenile.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.coscojuvenile.com/</a>

946109a893be7ef89b872c04100dd058aa	I think the dealer is right on the money. I have delivered 26'c/c boats with twin 250s on them! A single 200 to 250 would move you out o/k, and you will not be the fastest  but should move out well enough.|`|RjUhISEIaa	My suggestion would be to go with the max hp rating possible. Why? Resale value. Remember, you don't have to run her at full throttle but think of what is going to be said next.<br>  <br>  My 25' cuddy had a 454 ci/330 hp in her.

It tells you the maximum number of people the boat can carry, and the maximum horsepower the boat is designed for.<br>  <br>  A 24.5 walk around could easily handle a 250 horsepower outboard. I've seen 300s on 24 footers before, its not uncommon. Some will even have twins in the 200 horse range. <br>  <br>  A dealer would be crazy to overpower your boat by their own will. I work for a Mercury dealer, we would never do this because if an accident happened, there will be huge liability for us...<br>  <br>  I think a 250 horse would be the best match up.|`|nAzbLdBCaa	Depending on the specific boat, no less than 200HP.  I had a 24 with a` 188 HP I/O   and with full fuel it was just barely enough.  10 years later replaced it with a 230HP I/O and it ran great.  So, I 'd go with the 225 HP.   There's some nice deals out there now.  If you could afford to move up, now is the time.  Good Luck!|`|OWdYVnicaa	Sounds right on the money to me.<br>  As was said a 200 would be fine.<br>  the boat is most likely rated for about 300 hp<br>  <br>  I would go with the max rated, just my $.02|`|h8bHWSYxaa	I don't know!|`|4KvLIa6Saa	I have Always been max HP > I changed my mind here is a example> Our 28 white water center console> 8500lbs loaded> Had 2 -250 2 stroke yams> fast but if you lost 1 engine your at 10 knts coming in>And they drank so much fuel> We went to Suzuki 175 Hp 4 cylinders 4 stroke>With 6 people the boat come up on plain with <1> engine lifted completely out of the water and cruise at 30 mph on 1 engine not wide open> I know you won't believe it so go to Suzuki and see for yourself> The only fall back we lost 7mph so what still runs 48 Mph> You have to look at the tacks to see if the engines are running there so quiet you can't hear them> were pleased and the price was better than all the rest with 6 yrs warranty> You need to remember you need the weight of the large engine to balance the boat.

They wake up your neighbors, get you tickets, and make the motorcycle community look like a bunch of a**holes.<br>  <br>  Not running the stock pipe is understandable, on a performance standpoint, but just looking for the loudest pipe possible is irresponsible.  If you want to do that, go get a straight pipe with a megaphone on the end.  I know a couple of people that suffered hearing loss from loud pipes.  You will lose a lot of performance just going for loud, and you will look like you are using your bike as a feeble mating call.<br>  <br>  My personal opinion.|`|j2RFvzPHaa	<a href="http://www.rockymountainatv.com/categoryDetail.do?navType=category&navTitle=Exhaust&webCatId=18" rel="nofollow">http://www.rockymountainatv.com/category...</a><br>  <br>  go here!! go here!!<br>  seriously. im not sure how they will affect you price wise. i go there all the time though so i highly reccomend this catalog! there are other links on this page to other exausts,<br>  but they usually have anything!!|`|628354eb8f7435b3ae5db56f6ecf4b14aa	this is in responce to jims answer, I've been ridding my whole life and believe that "loud pipes save lives" motorcycles are not the most noticeable vehicles on the road, any extra attention we can get in traffic helps a ton safety wise|`|owpQPYGPaa	my favorite brand is 2 brothers had em on my honda F2 and now my 07 ZX6 R as for teh carbon fiber all that is is a wrap on the pipe normall so it doesnt effect sound|`|P8UAiCRraa	graves gp|`|fbxqLErlaa	So you want to make your bike extra loud?<br>  You desire to damage your hearing, add to riding fatigue, attract the attention of your local LEOs, keep you from hearing what is happening around you, and p!ss off other drivers?<br>  Do I have this right?<br>  Loud pipes lose rights!!<br>  When a fellow rider with loud pipes is riding near, they prevent ME from hearing what is happening around me.  I have a real problem with this!!<br>  Loud pipes do not create a bubble around you that keeps you safe.  <br>  Loud pipes do not save lives.

FsT54qh1aa	I would check the condition of your transmission fluid first. If it isn't even close to pink anymore it may be time to change it. If the color is good, the level may be slightly off. Using the transmission fluid dipstick, check the level and top it off if necessary. With that out of the way, if you still have the problem, you may be developing a transmission issue.|`|7L0zp7O6aa	Try replacing the fluid.  It's not that expensive to have done and helps with 90% od auto tranny problems.  If yu take it to a shop, it is guarantied you will be told you need expensive repairs so try the fluid.

They'll have records of your purchase.  <br>  <br>  If you aren't near the same dealer, any manufacturer dealer will most likely have access to some of your car's records (i.e., if you bought a Honda, go to any other Honda dealer).  Again, if it's within the time of the standard warranty, they are obligated to perform the repairs because they get paid back by the manufacturer.<br>  <br>  It's a little more complicated if you bought a used car.  In that case, you're best to go directly to the dealer you bought the car from, because most used car warranties are actually provided by a third-party insurance company, not the dealer or manufacturer.<br>  <br>  If you are unsure, you can always call ahead to the dealer to discuss it with a service technician, and they will tell you.

5aMDoJTAaa	Dear! not only in Karizma almost all models of self starter Motor Cycles it is better to use Kicker in the early-mornings to save battery power because it may take more than two trials if the climate is cold so with kicker and little bit of choke you can start the MC easily.

mzP5FmlMaa	First of all All the Taurus that we made didn't have carbourator on them they are fuel injected and in order to put gas in them you need to remove the hose covering the inlet, However you need to replace the filter for it may be bad then have the fuel rail cleaned or do it yourself use carburator cleaner for all that you do even putting it in the opening, just spray it in the opening but be careful. hope this helps.|`|wRJZk3k6aa	You sure you even have a carburetor on your ford tarus, it is a little too new to have one, I would expect fuel injected, also getting any old gas out of the tank, disconnect a fuel line and let the fuel pump remove all the gas itself.|`|AA10331789	A typical 91 Ford Taurus had a 3.0 Liter fuel injected push rod engine. Some models may have had a 3.8Liter fuel injected engine. Finally, there may have been an "SHO" performance engine car sold that was probably a Japanese engine (Yamaha DOHC) as you say. You may be able to download the owner's manual for the SHO model at the link below. But you will also need a repair manual from Haynes.

Other belts such as the serpentine belt that most cars have that runs from the alternator to the ac compressor to the power steering pump etc should be changed as needed. It's easy to check them. Take a look at the belt on both the smooth side and the underside. If you see cracking change it. It's that simple.
AA10788612	It's hard to say what a junk yard would give for it. It all depends on what they think it's worth to them. But if that Jeep has issues, I would eBay it a/ no reserve as a fixer upper. It should do better there. As far as fixing it, that would also depend on if the parts exceed the value of the Jeep. The $800 is a bit of a stretch. At best, $500 would probably what you'd end up selling it for. Just as well, it looks to be a lost cause unless you really know how to work on them. G'luck!

But, If you need to run more than 12 feet for the power, I would step up to 2 gauge. <br>  <br>  Your amp will only accept 4 gauge. If you do go bigger, you can always step it down with a distribution block or an AWG adapter.|`|tLilNlptaa	I would use 4 ga for power and ground|`|bADgVLswaa	I would use 6 gauge for the power wire and either 4 gauge ground wire or simply double ground (to avoid insufficient grounding problems). Make sure to clean off the grounding location (no paint, dirt, or other contaminants). Also, coat the ground connection with vaseline to avoid corrosion (just like on the battery). And I would get at least a 1.5 or 2 farad cap to avoid voltage drop when the bass hits.
mzyG3nODaa	You also should compare car insurance quotes for different cars before buying one, for example here - autoinsurance.noneto.com|`|YO1w7gpiaa	You will need to start with the money you have already saved, get on Craigslist or look in the newspaper, or network through your mechanic to find a used car, in good running condition, with low miles on the odometer ...you should be able to find one for $1500 to $3000.  Bring cash with you for the full price.<br>  Once you find a car, and drive it for a test-drive, make an agreement with the owner that YOUR mechanic will inspect the car and put it on the scope - (This will be your cost of $100-150 whether you buy the car or not.)  You will be given a written estimate of what repairs the car will soon need.  From this inspection you have something to base your judgment and decision of whether or not to buy this particular car.<br>  <br>  Some people do go to a dealership to purchase cars - there are extra charges you will have to pay, like dealer prep and handling.  Some dealerships will provide a short guarantee that the car does not currently need to be repaired/ others make no guarantee.  In my experience I've found most dealership used cars start their pricing somewhere between $5000 to $10000 and go up from there.<br>  <br>  Currently we are selling a Ford Tempo from the 1990's for $3,200.

d9ECb7N8aa	A BMW motorcycle is great, if you have a dealership near by (just in case)...<br>  <br>  The are great rides in my opinion. Very smooth and comfortable. My personal favorite is the R1200RT (I would get the K-model but valve adjustments are easier on the boxer motor). I almost bought a used one, but my wife found the VTX to be more comfortable as a passenger (I couldn't make up my mind between the BMW versus the VTX).<br>  <br>  I currently ride a cruiser-type bike (Honda VTX1800T), and I find it very comfortable with plenty of power.

d5c72dc4adab680a19c78052d440383daa	Are you getting rough idling, engine is stalling.. what's the deal?  I have '99 and when you open the hood, looking into the engine bay, look for the air filter box on the right, near the front.  Trace back the hose that looks like an accordian from the filter to the "other end."  That other end is the throttle body and you will need to "disconnect" the plastic hose from that metal body.  When you open it up, there will be a large opening, but if you look inside, there will be two smaller openings.  What you want to do is spray some "carb cleaner" or "throttle body cleaner" into that area, but don't over do it.  Spray in spurts, about five quick squirts.<br>  <br>  Then, put everything back together, run your engine a little bit and you should see some improvements.|`|UjhWIrJ1aa	Throttle body. It's where the air intake connects to the engine, don't have a picture for this, but honestly if you can't find it, don't try it. If it's an electronic throttle body, which it most likely is, and you mess it up, it's a very expensive repair. Not trying to be rude, just honest. If you still insist on doing it, there should be a piece of piping, coming from the air intake/filter box, connecting that to the top of the engine. Where that piping connects to, that's the throttle body. If you look into it, it should be a cylinder, with a metal flap in it. You want to spray around the metal flap, that will remove any dirt. Be extremely careful with this...
BzRsPE4daa	not exactly. tc stands for touring coupe and nothing stylistically resembles the toyota celica, other than the fact that its a smaller sportier coupe. in theory, the tc is toyota's replacement to the celica because the line was discontinued and is now the go-to option for an entry level sporty car. there are some borrowed parts from the celica, but a good deal of the internal structure is shares the exact same chasis as the toyota avensis and shares a good deal of its engine parts with the camry. if anything it seems like a more flattering version of the corolla. its sort of like saying the yaris is the new echo when in fact its an entirely new line of car that uses branded toyota parts. and by the way scion has rights to toyota because it is toyota|`|fvN18yvGaa	the celica is dead...although a good car its underpowered reputation was scrapped with the birth of scion...|`|kszkMlcXaa	no, they are not the same. the tc has almost nothing in common with the toyota celica. <br>  <br>  1) there is a sign below it because toyota owns scion<br>  2) there are a ton of cars that can look like another. sure they look similar but they did not base the design of the tc on the celica.<br>  3) the tc shares an exhaust system with the celica, so what? there are lots of cars that borrow other parts from different cars, but does that make them exactly the same? nope. for example, the tc has a camry engine. does that mean its exactly the same as a camry? nope. another example; mazda 3 and ford focus. they share many parts, including the engine. but does driving a mazda 3 mean that your driving a ford focus and vice versa? in terms of professional racing, then yes many people see the tc's introduction as a way of replacing the celica, but not in the subcompact sport category.

Answers (myself included) don't have any say in that discussion!<br>  <br>  That being said, yes, a 2004 Prius for $10500 sounds like a good deal, provided that it's in reasonable condition.<br>  <br>  Last comment: Another answer that you've received provided a link to an opinion piece claiming that the Prius is less environmentally sound than a Hummer.  Wrong.  That article (from a college newspaper) is based on "research" that has been widely discredited, and proven to be grossly biased and inaccurate.  Rather than give you a link to show that to you, I'll let you Google it yourself and see the dozens of sites that document it.  Search on terms like Prius, Hummer, and CNW Marketing Research (that's the name of the company that did the "research").|`|P8CBDLiKaa	I understand that the Prius needs a new battery after 5-6 years and they go for around $3,000, so maybe not such a good deal, but it would still beat paying for the gas in the Excursion, and is WAY better for the environment.|`|H8XpaaPDaa	LMAOO!!!<br>  <br>  don't get me wrong, i am a MAJOR tree hugger, but if miley cyrus said prius's were good, that would be enough to get me to NOT get a prius...<br>  <br>  <br>  if you want to do the enviornment a hand, get an electric car. or better yet, ride a bike or take public transport.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  btw, batteries in prius's last longer than 5-6 years. infact, the first gen prius's should still have their batteries working. and when they do come to the end of their life, they get recycled.|`|HR0mXBFMaa	i think thats a good deal. The battery is SUPPOSE to live for the life of the car but even if you do have to pay for a new battery its worth it in the long run because of the gas mileage! and toyotas are really reliable i'd go for it!

I completely understand that you don't want the Excursion though.  Those are very bad on gas and really not that practical. <br>  <br>  Honestly though, just because Miley Cyrus has a Prius doesn't mean it's that great.  Daddy probably paid for it and she heard that they were cool on Facebook or something, so she suddenly wanted it.  If all you are doing is going to school and back, then it will take YEARS longer to recoup the costs of paying for that car.  Something like a Ford Focus, Chevy Cavalier, or a Honda Civic would really be more economical because the gas is still GREAT and they are already probably thousands less.<br>  <br>  Here's an article I found awhile back about the Prius and its green factor...  <a href="http://clubs.ccsu.edu/Recorder/editorial/editorial_item.asp?NewsID=188" rel="nofollow">http://clubs.ccsu.edu/Recorder/editorial...</a>

It depends what gaskets blown or if it is a bigger problem.|`|AXNkmdbKaa	At the back of the trans a seal may do the trick and is relatively cheap.  Just remove the driveshaft and have at it.  If it needs the bushing then it is expensive and you will have to pull the trans I bet.  If it is at the front of the trans then you have to pull the transmission.  It will probably need a new torque convertor because the seal will have worn a groove in the torque convertor hub.  Or you could use a sleeve kit that is sold to save buying the convertor.  It works like a sleeve kit for the harmonic balancer which has exactly the same problems.  Either way, there is a lot of labor involved.  If the leak is not too bad try some Lucas seal restorer first.
AA10671693	if your just lookin for bass then ya all you need to get is the subwoofers you want along with an amp that matches them. If this is your first system i would suggest 2 12's somewhere around 600 to 800 watts a piece. This is pretty easy to find and there are a wide range of choices. If your looking for cheap then you can go with pyle...lightning audio...sony...etc but you get what you pay for...If you want to go crazy and blow windows...get pulled over constantly, and make passengers vomit(true story) then i would suggest kicker solobarics......your probably lost in what im telling you so if your just wanting something basic but not shitty and not to much i would go with a sub - amp combo that you see at circuit city...best buy...or even on ebay. MTX or Rockford Fosgate are good choices......if you have any questions id be happy 2 help you out.|`|claJjdbuaa	Well, I would suggest replacing your entire stock sound system if you want to be loud and bumpin. But of course this is going to cost some money. Give or take, you'll be spending somewhere around $1,000. Of course that depends on what you get. Could be more, could be less. Get it all professionally installed at a place that specializes in car audio (not Best Buy or anywhere like that, they charge way too much).<br>  <br>  You are first going to need to replace your CD player/headunit with an aftermarket headunit. I would then suggest replacing your door speakers and any other stock speakers that are in your Cobalt. You'll want to get some real nice aftermarket speakers to replace these as well as a decent amplifier to power them. The regular speakers should be the basis of your sound so don't try to be cheap with the door speakers. You'll probably get component speakers to replace these which normally consists of mid-range speakers and tweeters separately. If you want a lot of bass then you'll probably want a lot of mids and highs as well. Then, of course, you'll want your subwoofers and an amplifier to power them, and there's no point in having nice speakers if you're not going to get a nice amp to power them. As far as subwoofers go, I think Kickers are the best for the price. Two 12" Kicker CompVRs are fairly cheap and I personally don't think you'll find a better subwoofer for the price. If you really want to beat it down go for some Kicker Solobarics or L7s or something.<br>  <br>  I'm just trying to give you an idea to roll with. I think you should go to a car audio shop and listen to some speakers there and get advice from the people that work there. They'll probably be able to help you out a whole lot more than Yahoo Answers. Those people usually got a banging *** system in their cars, too. Have fun.|`|uDuwc7Yoaa	you won't need a ton of power to get it to sound good. for your regular 4 speakers in your car, an amp that's 50 watts per channel is going to be great for you. <br>  For a sub, if you get something that's ~250 watts or so in a good ported box you'll have a good sounding system.<br>  here are some suggestions<br>  front speakers<br>  <a href="http://www.sonicelectronix.com/item_8914_MB+Quart+EKA+113.html#" rel="nofollow">http://www.sonicelectronix.com/item_8914...</a><br>  rear speakers<br>  <a href="http://www.sonicelectronix.com/item_12185_MB+Quart+FTA+169.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sonicelectronix.com/item_1218...</a><br>  amp & kit<br>  <a href="http://www.sonicelectronix.com/item_9545_Crunch+PZi+550.5.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sonicelectronix.com/item_9545...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.sonicelectronix.com/item_16598_DEI+-+Directed+68105.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sonicelectronix.com/item_1659...</a><br>  subwoofer<br>  <a href="http://www.sonicelectronix.com/item_3877_Kicker+TC10+--+4+Ohm+10-+Comp+Vented+Truck+Enclosure+05TC10.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sonicelectronix.com/item_3877...</a><br>  cd player<br>  <a href="http://www.sonicelectronix.com/item_8299_Pioneer+DEH-P2900MP.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sonicelectronix.com/item_8299...</a><br>  all of that is about $500 and will get as loud as you'd want, but more importantly will sound great<br>  if you have the pioneer system that came stock with some cobalts, you can probably get by without replacing your front & rear speakers,  that'll save you some $, just make use of the crossover on a new amp.|`|tLilNlptaa	To get the basics, you will need a deck and speakers. Yes, subwoofers are for base, because they can pick up the low frequencies regular speakers can't. If you would want to add a sub, you will need the sub, amp for it, wiring kit, and the sub box.

It's not as quick as I'd like and tuning can be expensive.  However, with the relatively cheap additions of exhaust, filters and ECU, good power increases can be seen.  There are a few turbo conversions around, too, but if you want a car to tune for big power the VR6 is not really the way to go.  It cruises beautifully and has a much more muscular torque spread than smaller engined cars. The VR6 engine is very strong and does not give much trouble.  Also, it's a VW and is not made of cardboard like the Renault mentioned in another answer.|`|iRg1vyHcaa	I wouldn't bother. The VR6 is a horrendously slow car. 2.8 litre petrol engine and only 174bhp!! The Clio 172 is almost as powerful and just as fast with only a 2.0 litre engine. That just shows how much better VW could have done with the VR6.<br>  <br>  You'll also get hammered for insurance because they'll see the size of the engine and you'll be lucky to get 30mpg.<br>  <br>  If you're after something you can tune then go for the 1.8 litre Turbo engine used in slightly later VW/Audi/Seat/Skoda cars. In particular the Audi A3 Quattro if can afford it. The 1.8T is built to withstand 350bhp so you can go as far as you want with your tuning.<br>  <br>  EDIT - Just to clarify I'm not suggesting that you get a Renault of similar age to the VR6. It will crumble and die before your eyes. I was merely using the renault to show how badly VW messed up with the VR6 in relation to power to cc ratio. Go for the 1.8T VW engine in any car but preferably one with 4 wheel drive. The Octavia 1.8T 4x4 is one hell of an option. I've seen these with 400+bhp once modified and if you don't modify the exterior people will think you've got a bog standard family hatch.......until you hit the throttle and leave Scoobies and Evos standing.|`|AA11070360	GET ONE.

fl60KL8oaa	"... Even when I had my permit, I practiced in parking lots and stuff but it's way different when driving on actual streets..."<br>  <br>  Oh yeah!  On the streets you have to avoid all of the idiots.<br>  <br>  "...many car accidents nowadays and I definitely cannot be responsible for someone's life or injury. I once was in a car accident when my friend was driving... the police officers were so mean to us because it was our fault..."<br>  <br>  Your friends' fault, not yours.   And you are wrong about "many car accidents nowadays.  The accident rate, per registered vehicle and per millions of miles driven, has dropped dramatically over the past few decades. <br>  <br>  Your feeling not responsible enough to drive proves that you are.  It's a Catch-22.  If you feel inadaquate you take extra care and avoid accidents.  It is not until  you start feeling that you are responsible enough that you let your guard down and have an accident.<br>  <br>  "...I know people think I'm weird for not having a license but I think buses and walking are easier and safer...."<br>  <br>  mmmmm....  no.  on *average* a bus may be safer; but you are not average.  Not to mention that public transportation does not go everywhere and is on a limited schedule.   Walking is OK for upto a mile or so, but beyond that it takes too much time.<br>  <br>  Can you ride a bicycle?  A bicycle is the absolute most efficient means of transportation in terms of moving a person the furthest on the least energy.  It is also not capable of harming other people or vehicles to any great degree.<br>  <br>  If you can ride a bicycle you can also ride a motor bike or scooter.  Again you have less capability of inflicting damage upon others, but it gives you the convience of being able to travel anywhere you wish when you wish.<br>  <br>  Heh!

If you are nervous about driving but want to find yourself a good instructor that will build your confidence.

Be confident and sure and you'll be fine. <br>  <br>  As for the police, keep quiet until a lawyer is present.|`|6QIKdgDIaa	I believe that you should still get a license. It's okay to have fears, everybody does. <br>  You should get a license because what if one day, you somehow don't have a fear of driving anymore and you don't have a license? Or what if there is an emergency and you don't have a license that proves you're qualified to drive a car?<br>   In my opinion / advice I think you should still get a license, just in case, but get one and take a bus if you want to. If you do have to drive just drive more carefully and relax while you drive. Keep a clear mind and stay awake.|`|31Ttgqlbaa	I was scared when I started driving and now it's no big deal. A lot of people go through this fear of driving at first, but it always passes. If more people didn't drive for your reasons, there will be less accidents. Not that many teens would say, "I just feel like I'm not responsible enough to drive." Most people feel driving is a right when it's not, it's a privilege. At least you know accidents can happen (and there's always a cause by another driver or yourself) and you'll be more careful and a defensive driver when you do learn how to drive. As long you don't do anything aggressive that could cause an accident and watch and be prepared for what another driver may do, you'll be fine. And in case you make a mistake that causes an accident, that's why you have insurance.<br>  <br>  Try not to be scared while driving. That will make matters worst and you might not drive good.<br>  <br>  Go and find a driving school where you can learn to drive.|`|P8CBDLiKaa	Your feelings are not too unusual, but there are options to help you get over your fear and discomfort.  Start from scratch and take driving lessons from a reputable school.  Look for one that offers one-on-one training for nervous drivers with more emphasis on defensive driving techniques.<br>  <br>  Also, don't let one bad experience ruin it for you.  The ability to drive is important, but you can live without it.  Keep in mind that you can still walk and take public transit and just drive when you really need to.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

tBq6ZDZvaa	Okay hear is a reality check for you (no offense) but ANY transmission shop will only try to got you to pay as much money as possible to get your car fixed even if its something simple they will factor in the age of the car and the mileage and just say hay you need to get your transmission rebuilt. That's what happened to me with my car I had a slipping transmission and every place I brought it to said that it needed a total rebuild (given that the transmission had 168K on it at the time) but I knew that it was something simple so I finally got in touch with a friend of mine who knows somebody that owns a tranny shop and I got my tranny fixed for only 1,000 (total rebuild) I just had to pay for all the parts and I gave them like $400 for the labor but in all 1,000 is not bad I got new clutch packs new bearings and seals, pump and solenoids and all the upgrades. Mean while most other places wanted to charge me 2,000 to 2,600 and they only gave me a one year warranty or 10,000 miles. So my point is that you really need to do a good job of researching different tranny shops and stay away from Amco they are rip offs.

A court won't give you more than the car is worth either.|`|MmTe8W8uaa	You cannot force either the person or the insurance company to pay more than the value of your car.  The most that either of them is required to pay is either the cost to repair the car or the value of the car, whichever is LESS (of these two amounts).  However, if the amount that they are offering is less than the value of your car AND is less than the cost to repair it, then you can sue.|`|6EVNhcNLaa	You say you paid $3,800.00 for the vehicle but how long have had it. Are you taking into consideration that the vehicle has depreciated since you bought it. When insurance companies total a vehicle they pay between the retail and wholesale listings. The $1,700.00 offer from the insurance company if you want to keep the vehicle (I don;t know why you would want to), is the value of the vehicle ($2,500.00) less the salvage value ($800.00) = $1,700.00. You will also need to add the amount of the collision deductible you are required to pay. If nothing else, you can sue the other driver fo the amount of your deductible. If you want to email me I can explain further.

If you have a strong enough fan and it can increase the air pressure enough it should allow the engine more volume of air. The easiest way to do this would be to use a duct fan. Then the fan engine would warm up and warm up the intake air which would diminish the results of the higher PSI air.|`|yaq7oaH6aa	It could be 'strong enough'. It's a question of power and control.<br>  Control: Unless you match compressor speed to engine speed, <br>  you're constantly changing the over-all compression ratio.<br>   That causes all sorts of problems.<br>  Power: You have to drive that motor, and it's likely to be a larger <br>  extra load than your system is designed to handle. you'd need <br>  a larger alternator at a minmum.<br>  <br>  Short answer, Unless you know a lot about electrics, and are <br>  comfortable with engineering a pressure sensor regulated <br>  VFD drive, keeping all components cool enough to operate properly <br>  under that hood and the manifold pressure within 'spec', forget it.<br>  The mechanical losses from your belt drive are <br>  probably less than they would be in an electrical <br>  drive system.<br>  <br>  A lot of engineering went into what you've got.<br>  If it works, don't fix it.|`|lT4JTq9iaa	I have heard of something like what you describe, but it was a lame fan installed in the intake ducting and didn't create any boost, and it wasn't on a Stang.

fe7f5e169c58c4b7d96cbce63bcb83ffaa	Absolutely yes!<br>  <br>  There should be a brake switch trigger near the back end of the brake pedal - depress the pedal and see what moves when you do that.  The trigger will probably be a black cylinder with a wire coming out of it going up the frame.  Make sure the brake pedal actually depresses the little piston on this cylinder, and if it does appear to be mechanically working correctly, then check that wire - make sure its connector is plugged in correctly and the wires don't look frayed or cracked.  Sometimes unplugging and re-plugging a connector can get it working again (by cleaning off corrosion on the contacts inside).|`|U638GHIWaa	yes, the back brake light is suppose to light when you apply the rear brake. the brake switch located underneath the brake pedal should be a cylinder switch wich will need to be replaced.  should have no problems once replaced.|`|Kl54UI1Yaa	YES.

L7sgufRQaa	Once the cars are shipped from the manufacturer to the dealership they are usually stored on the lot. Some dealers have off site storage which is usually a fenced in secure area. <br>  <br>  The minute they are delivered and checked in the manufacturer keeps a running tally on how many days a vehicle has been on the lot.  This helps keep track of what vehicles are in demand and what vehicles will be delivered next.  It also helps the dealership itself determine what cars might be featured in their ads.   They will try to get rid of the ones that have been there the longest first.  (Dealers pay fees and insurance for each car on the lot so it's in their best interest to move them out quick.)<br>  <br>  Most cars only spend a few days or weeks on the lot but some can be there for several months.  I've even seen a year on a vehicle that wasn't in high demand.<br>  <br>  The vehicles get moved around a lot for various reasons.  One of the main reasons is to wash them so they look nice and new on the lot.  (this is true of used vehicles too.)  If they are noted to have any issues while being moved or washed, like a check engine light come on, or maybe a wiper blade is torn, they are sent taken into the service department and checked out and fixed if needed.  Any costs of repairs are not applied to a new vehicle, they are paid for by the dealerships sales department, cost of doin' business!<br>  <br>  Once a vehicle is purchased it goes to the service department for a Pre-Delivery Inspection.  They go over the manufactures set list of areas to check to make sure everything is in good working order on the vehicle before the purchaser takes delivery of their new car.<br>  <br>  Dealerships know people want their brand new car to look brand new so they take steps to keep them that way, like disposable car seat covers and floor mats.<br>  <br>  When you take delivery of the vehicle you should also be asked to look over the vehicle and sign a checklist that notes that everything is in good working order. <br>  <br>  I hope this answered your question.
