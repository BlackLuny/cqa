The fact is,that to finance this plan,Comrade Barack Obama will have borrow bank credit-which does not exist,except as electrons in a computer- from the private banking system,which has been owned and controlled by generations of financial psychopaths,whose sole objective is financial control of all the world's assets through its credit/debt system.One of the most prominent of the current generation of financial psychopathss,is Comrade David Rockefeller.Therefore,this $75 billion that Barak Obama borrows (which will be an electronic entry in a computer),will be added to an already unrepayable National Debt -as if it actually existed - and unrepayable interest will be added to an already unrepayable interest.Do you know who owes this unrepayable debt to the financial psychopaths, how it is to be repaid,and what the collateral security for the debt is?The debt is owed by every American who pays taxes, approximately 50 percent of taxes collected are aallocated to the servicing of this unrepayable debt,and the collateral security for the debt is America and all is assets,which includes all the assets of all citizens.However,you will not here Comrade Barack Obama,or any other quisling say this.Moreover,you can be sure that Comrade Rockefeller,or any of his cabal of psychopaths,who avoid taxes through tax exempt foundations,or Comrade Barack Obama,will not continue to drink from the public gravy trough,at the expense of all Americans who are unemployed,living in poverty,do not have access to adequate health care,are being evicted from their homes by greedy bankers,and so on.I have difficulty understanding why the American people continued to support a system that gives excessive power to one individual,and which gives rise to so much orruption.Sadly,the<br>  Australian people are not far from following the American example.|`|siwxWxa0aa	This will shock people but, that part of the bill I have some issues with. I am all for helping people with their needs, however, owning a home is a luxury, it isn't a need there are rentals and there is assistance for that.

That being said, I think many of us confuse want with need. It is very unfortunate that the previous administration once again dropped the ball choosing to put the economy on hold for this administration to deal with. They could have very easily addressed some of these things before we got to the point of having to push the bill through as a whole. <br>  <br>  Whats done though is done.

A Recession is defined as 2 consecutive quarters of decline in the GDP.  A depression is generally referred to as a really bad economic state, but there is no single identifying factor.  Generally people reserve the world Depression for a more severe and long lasting recession.  However, most people are misusing the term recession these days... worst of them are the media, politicians, and "economic experts".|`|28b037c9067df2ec28f25fbd2bab84e3aa	The traditional definition of a recession is two consecutive quarters of negative growth in the GDP.<br>  <br>  There's no equivalent definition for a depression, it's just considered to be an unusually deep and sustained recession,  In the past 100 years, we've only had one, but there's some chance that we're now moving into another.|`|de50d8fa52217e49871467e36a4ef389aa	a recession is characterized by two straight quarters of negative gdp or deflation. thats 6 months<br>   There is no exact definition of a depression but it is basically a very bad recession.|`|ZjHDdZ48aa	Uhh... depressions are like bad.... yeah... yeah...

xNsJqTgaaa	Fact is the event republicans are talking about isn't something Franks had the power to stop.  Franks combined with all the Republicans could at most delay it for 7 days.  After that; if the vote was on party lines, the legislation would have passed commitee and been put on schedule for debate and a vote, but you'll find that didn't really happen.  The Republicans just didn't push to get the legislation through.<br>  <br>  MORE IMPORTANT:<br>      There isn't anything I coulld find in the legislation that would have fixed the problem.  It wasn't bad legislation per se, but all it did was combine two departments that oversee these organizations, it didn't impose any new regulations that I could see, or do anything to change the way those organizations did business.  So I ask you, what would it have fixed at Fannie or Freddie?|`|2FA9qNHzaa	how can you defend ole frank and beans when he is the most vile, disgusting human on earth, oh, sorry. I forgot.

I think politics.  Because of the blatant deceit and outright lies used by all politicians for the sake of power and wealth.  With religion you have people who really believe in what they are saying, and feel that the are really "saving" you. Once elected, a politician will just ignore the people who elected them until the next election. The politician knows they are lying or misleading the people..|`|AA10818613	Religion is more of a farce because it's all make believe stuff for the weak minded.  Politics actually has a physical and real impact on people's lives and I don't consider that to be a farce.  Our country was founded on the principles of the Enlightenment and freedom to worship or not to worship as we please, unlike Europe at the time.<br>  <br>  duvvbran... I never said religion didn't have an impact on people's minds.  However, I would argue that that politics within religion and religious sects have more impact on people's lives than the religion or belief itself does.  The Catholic church has impacted people's lives throughout history in terms of torture, the inquisition, The murdering of jews and non believers and the murdering of people who continued the practices of Europes indiginous religions, the wars in the mideast that it started and the murders it performed against protestant's when they rose up against the Catholic church. Both Protestant churches and the Catholic church had their hands in helping to murder Jews in the Holocaust. And,the Catholics murdered thousands of people after deciding they were heretics.  But this was again, Church doctrine, in otherwords policies as in politics and power.  So once again, I prove my point with facts and you prove nothing.|`|BIQrsl4paa	Flip a coin.<br>  One is based in mysticism the other in fantasy.<br>  To coin a phrase,"The only thing wrong with politics, is politicians" and you could easily convert that phrase into something reflective of religion.|`|DmRWEgX1aa	Liberals.

9be66fc4a6ca5975f90f22d8c6576b38aa	Perhaps you should take a class in Economics?<br>  <br>  Economies don't work on your house or your mortgage. They work on revolution of money. That is... what happens to money and what money makes happen. It's waaaaaaaaaaaaaay far more complex than mortgages and honestly, has more to do with our society being STUPID and living on borrowed rather than saved money all the time. We have new cars every 2 years, 5 tv's in each house, iPhones, latest fashions, vacations to far away places and multiple computers in most our homes and most of that stuff is purchased on borrowed money, not money we currently have. <br>  <br>  That borrowed money is given to companies that produced this stuff. That then becomes REAL money that's paid to employees, owners, stockholders, taxes, etc. That money is then spent by all those people for their needs which goes to more companies and their employees, stockholders, owners, taxes, etc... thus, each dollar we spend becomes multiple dollars down the line.<br>  <br>  Now... remember how that "dollar" isn't actual? Remember that it's borrowed? That means the bank paid you to spend it and now it has to find money to pay its own bills even though it lent you the money. Sadly, they can't get money if they're not doing well (they can't lend it to people who won't pay back), but they can't do well without getting money (can't pay bills or salaries). That's the dead end we're in. The goverment is hoping that by giving them money at first it will stop that process.|`|69aae2afc5ec35c06042c874dc59e82faa	The answer to this is simple, so simple you probably won't believe me.<br>  <br>  The economic system is a scam, money is actually worthless, it's only backed by the people's belief that it is worth something.<br>  <br>  We're all playing a sick never ending game of monopoly, and a lot of us know it but they are too afraid to voice their opinions, and for good reason(cowardice),  because the rest of the people don't know and don't want to know, they just want to stay in the herd where it's "safe".|`|xNsJqTgaaa	The answer I'm about to give does not justify the spending, debate the economic theories, philosophy or history.  It just answers the question "How come this doesn't work for governments?"<br>  <br>  The answer is that it's a different kind of loan.  Mortgages and home equity loans are secured loans.  Loans to the government are unsecured, much like a signature loan.<br>  <br>  I can get a small signature loan at the bank based on my income and credit history.  That's the theory behind loans to the US gov't.  We have revenue based on taxes and a pretty darn good record of making payments on our debt.<br>  <br>  It's that simple.  Common sense, not so much, but there is something to it.|`|C2HHfun2aa	Very good point! <br>  <br>  Also I would like someone to show me a country who spent their way out of a recession.

He didn't have to<br>  <br>  But in recent years, the Republicans have realized that this isn't working for them.  As America gets more diverse the population of some minorities are growing faster than the general population, especially in some big, important swing states like Arizona, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida.  So starting with GHW Bush's second campaign, the GOP has made efforts to reach out to minorities--also in code words, because they risk cheesing off their base of intolerant Southern white males.  So far it hasn't worked well for them.  And they've shifted their angry intolerance towards new 'minorities' that are safer to attack--illegal immigrants and gays. Why do you think Republicans have made such a big deal about 'the gay agenda' in just the last few years?<br>  <br>  Well now they're really desperate.  So they hired a new chairman who 'just happens to be black'.  And he is making loud noises about the 'big tent'.<br>  <br>  In the 60s there was talk of left-handed handicapped lesbians. Well, Steele can't say lesbians. He can't say lesbians.  But 'midgets' are still a safe target.  He's afraid to say what the party is really thinking: "We are going to buff our image with Hispanics and Blacks."  Because he'd lose his base if he did that.  He might as well be a Democrat.

They accused him of just about every crime they could think of, including all the biggies--murder, drug dealing, rape, treason.  They kept repeating these lies over and over even long after they'd been completely discredited, adding new items to the laundry list all the time.<br>  <br>  Republicans feel that the White House just -belongs- to them.  When a Democrat wins the presidency, they feel they've been robbed.  They can't cooperate with a Democratic president because that would hand him a victory.  They can't agree with anything he wants or says because that would look like an endorsement.  So they reflexively criticize and obstruct.<br>  <br>  The Republicans want Obama to fail, and fail big-time.  They want things to get a lot worse in the US so they can blame all of it on Obama, and they can then get back into power.  That's all they care about, being in power so they can pursue their agenda.  They don't care what damage they do to the country.  They put party above country.<br>  <br>  Luckily, the Democrats now have the White House and majorities in both houses of Congress.  If Obama is competent and lucky enough to hold onto that, he can just work around the Republicans.  They have made themselves irrelevant.|`|ZzHE0lvtaa	Oh please, hypocrite.

He's spent nearly a million dollars in lawyers fees trying to avoid that very thing....doing anything and everything to prevent that document from becoming public (probably because it shows him entering hawaii by way of kenya as a newborn baby....and hence, not eligible to be president).<br>  <br>  The real kicker, of course is Obama's own grandmother is quite emphatic about her being present during his birth....in kenya.  The kenyan authorities currently keep her under armed guard to prevent her from talking any more to the media.<br>  <br>  Hell, there was some politicain from Kenya, just a couple weeks about talking about how proud he was that Obama was born in Kenya.

Now if you were working at a strip club or a bar owned by the local "suspected" drug dealer then you are in trouble.<br>  <br>  Now even if you get into the Police joining SWAT is a different business; S.W.A.T. is a special unit so you must earn it by meeting their own requirements.|`|AA10925759	It is actually a big plus be it a civilian, military or law enforcement job. It is way of thinking.<br>  <br>  As a bartender you learn about people and learn how to deal with all sorts. Rich, poor, people with attitude and those who are nice. It gives you insight personally and professionally. <br>  <br>  You also are one up on the person who just did whatever job before. You know how to multitask since so many things are going on in a bar. <br>  <br>  Of course knowing how to do that in any related field is the biggest key. <br>  <br>  I'm military but I am talking about something that is SWAT plus. I have always considered that my experience as a bartender beforehand is the reason that I have been a success at it.|`|R9zaR2mQaa	You gotta get your feet wet before you can dive in.  By that I mean you will have to put in your time on patrol to even be considered for a swat team.  A buddy with an agency close to me was a bartender through college and got hired on no problem.  <br>  <br>  He's kinda a genius though, had an impeccable record, a BS degree, and some awesome references.|`|XyXDs8vcaa	My former partner was a bartender up until he joined the Sheriff's Office about two years ago as a reserve officer.

Theres nothing wrong with bartenders i dont see why bartenders cant be SWAT.|`|FiefWUDGaa	Erm...bartending wouldn't effect your chances of joining S.W.A.T.<br>  <br>  Your idea of SWAT is a bit obscurred though. SWAT Officers are regular police officers that go to calls when SWAT is needed which is rare depending on what area you're in. Some of the bigger cities have SWAT warrant service which does nothing but serves warrants all day.<br>  <br>  Other than that - bartending is a job, it won't affect you becoming SWAT nor would it effect you becoming a Police Officer.|`|EgdR7cfTaa	there is nothing illegal about bartending....it really doesn't matter because you have to be hired as a regular patrol officer first and bartending won't keep you from that.  Once your a cop, your eligible to advance through the ranks or join any special units as long as you have the college education that some require.  SWAT is not one of them.|`|nCUhscAuaa	No this should not affect you.<br>  <br>  User Conor is wrong, it's true that some police deparment don't have a S.W.A.T team on-hold 24/7 but they still have a S.W.A.T. team, they are trained S.W.A.T. officers that do regular cop duties until their are needed, that's all. It seems Conor's idea of SWAT is a bit obscurred though.

The media controls the mind of the masses..|`|57ypEhWlaa	I didnt hear about the use of crack or other drugs so i can comment on that but the reason it is ok for him to go to a racist church is because generally when blacks form groups that put down whites it is not seen as racist, it is seen as being proud about your race.  When whites form the same groups it is seen as racist.  It is a double standard.<br>  btw, what does flame this question mean?<br>  <br>  additional--<br>  Now thats funny.  I am not an Obama supporter so I did not read his autobiography but if he did admit to using crack in it and the people on this page that act like they are huge Obama fans didnt even know that about him, that just goes to show how many people voted for him without knowing anything about him other then the color of his skin.  Expecially someone that has the word "obama" in there yahoo name and they dont have a clue about the guy.  Thats just so sad its funny. Its so obvious that people like this just wanted to be able to say they voted for the black guy that they didnt bother to do any research on him.|`|UBxKqdPwaa	Are you related to Karl Rove?

Bush’s presidency.<br>  <br>  It’s the biggest increase under any president in U.S history.<br>  <br>  On the day President Bush took office, the national debt stood at $5.727 trillion.

That’s a 71.9 percent increase on Mr. Bush’s watch.<br>  <br>  The bailout plan now pending in Congress could add hundreds of billions of dollars to the national debt – though President Bush said this morning he expects that over time, “much if not all” of the bailout money “will be paid back.”<br>  <br>  But the government is taking no chances. Buried deep in the hundred pages of bailout legislation is a provision that would raise the statutory ceiling on the national debt to $11.315 trillion. It’ll be the 7th time the debt limit has been raised during this administration.

The definition of an assault rifle is a below full rifle cartridge and the ability to be used either semi-automatic (one bullet fired per trigger pull)or  automatic (mean more then round fired per trigger pull); none of the weapons I own are assault rifles-some might look like assault rifle but a bunny rabbit disguised as a grizzly bear is not a grizzly bear.  His definition of assault rifle is basically every detachable magazine semi-automatic weapon made.  This includes my 22 caliber Ruger 10/22 and based on the definition in HR 45 could include my 1896 Model Mauser Pistol (C96); it does not have a detachable magazine but could be modified to accept one (the Germans did that during WW2 so it is possible to do).  The 2nd Amendment exists as stated in the writings of the framers of the Constitution to ensure the population has the means to resist the government if it becomes too tyrannical.  I put it simpler that the Second amendment exists to ensure the rest of them are not messed with so if it goes the rest will follow shortly.  More crimes and murders are committed with knives then assault rifles so why try to ban them for public safety; it appears a better crime fighter would be banning knives.  I am not much of an extremist on this and have no problem with background checks and not being allowed to buy a machine gun easily; I say easily because under federal law I can buy a full automatic machine gun legally and nothing talked about would change that just see no reason to spend the money they cost or the $400.00 fee to the government to do so.  The talk about national registration, requiring excessive insurance policies, making me legally liable if a thief steals it and uses it, mental health review/psychological evaluations and fees to the government that are not set at a guaranteed long term level not to interfere with those purchases or an excise tax of 120% of the value of the weapons and ammunition or components of ammunition I think it is nothing about registering, controlling or any thing but trying to backdoor the 2nd Amendment and ban ownership period.

Anyone with an elementary understanding of economics would understand not to invest $200,000 with an expected return of $25,000.|`|ofP7bbX7aa	You doubt the word of the Messiah, put $20 in a democrat's campaign box and say 3 hail Pelosis  and sin no more.|`|AA10818613	Actually your math is completely wrong.  The cost per job is less than $50,000.  And, it will have a multiplier effect that will stimulate more jobs at no cost.  A vast majority of these jobs as a result will be more like $40,000 a year jobs and many of them will be union jobs that will guarantee those working families a decent wage with benefits.  This in turn will help stimulate a multiplier effect by creating more jobs because these working families will spend their money and this is what creates demand.  Economists who are both liberal and conservative agree that this stimulus bill is the best way to jumpstart the economy.  Personally, I'm glad this is how my money will be spent.  It will remain in America and be spent on badly needed new schools and roads, bridges, internet super highway, healthcare.  It's about time our money is kept home and invested in our own country.  Even economist Mark Zandi, who worked for the John McCain campaign said this stimulus is a good start and a good bill.   The only problem with this bill is that it is too small.  Even Zandi, economists Krugman, Friedman (conservative), Baker, Nouri, Stiegliz and Galbraith are all saying the same thing.  Obama will have to have another stimulus bill within this year. Either that or congress will have to write more funding for infrastructure and stimulus into appropriations bills.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Not one job in this bill for stimulus is for maids and hotel workers.  Last time I looked Infrastructure = construction and skilled labor.  Last time I looked, maids and hotel workers didn't teach in schools.  Last time I looked maids and hotel workers didn't know how to set up large area networks for the internet.  Try again.  Try taking an economics 101 class in macroeconomics.  Or, perhaps you should read the stimulus package for yourself like I did to see exactly where this money will be spent.  I didn't see any hotels, convenience stores or restaurants listed at all.<br>  <br>  BTW, Tax cuts don't create any jobs.  They are the least effective in terms of creating jobs.  That's been proven over and over again.  Therefore, it's easy to say that they don't have much stimulus effect on the economy.  However, real projects including building highways, bridges, schools, high speed trains, mass transit, a new national energy grid that's updated and efficient, and a solid health care system does create jobs and stimulate the economy.<br>  <br>  I READ THE BILL AS I TOLD YOU.  IT'S YOU THAT NEEDS TO READ THE BILL BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT.  YOU KEEP PARROTING RUSH AND THE HERITAGE FOUNDATION.  YOU ARE CLUELESS.<br>  I've minored in economics dumba*s*s. There is no threat of inflation in this country right now.  We have a huge threat of deflation and it is already starting.  Deflation is a far worse cycle to break than inflation.  Please pull your head out.  You can complain all you want about this bill but the facts remain that the GOP have absolutely no ideas of their own that will actually work.  They are clueless and the do nothing, just say NO party.  People in this country are sick and tired of their attitudes and their greed.  We voted them out and we voted their failed policies out.<br>  <br>  Your GOP has no problem in investing in bombing and rebuilding Iraq but won't lift a finger to help our own country get out of this crisis.  they refuse to invest any money into our own country.|`|AA11086243	A. why do cons read the heritage foundation... and just magically assume every economist agrees? some economists think this could help... some do not... it's debated...

I hear a lot of people complaining... but no better ideas... consumer spending is dropping like a rock and how do you fight that? a huge portion of the nation doesn't pay enough in taxes to even be greatly impacted by a tax cut... they are losing their homes... losing their jobs...<br>  <br>  big bus has no motivation to expand, as no one is buying...<br>  <br>  and if you sit there and do nothing... people won't accept it.... and they will replace you... right or wrong...|`|217c8796b5373a65275202f935b6fcdbaa	Economist on both sides of the political isle state that this is absolutely the best way.<br>  <br>  Let's give it time and see how it works.

That way, the Dems in both houses can claim innocence when the states spend it on things other than jobs and job creation.<br>  I just wonder how the Dems are going to spin this against the GOP when it all hits the fan, seeing as how only 3 Republicans supported the legislation.<br>  I'm really looking forward to more of Pelosi's creative math.

XEaRdopnaa	Honestly, I was in a serious relationship with a marine about a year ago and i know their schedules are crazy and they can be really tired after a hard day of work.  But if you've ever been to the barracks, you know that they value their free time and they ALWAYS have at least a little bit of free time during the week.  I've seen some of them partying on weeknights! If he makes no effort to contact you then I do not think he's that into this relationship.  It's only 5 months into it and it sounds like he's already acting like he has you on a leash and you will be there for him regardless of his crappy excuses.  He could be seeing other girls as well, but you would not know about them, or he is not serious about this relationship.  <br>  <br>  Every girl deserves better than that.  You shouldn't have to wait around for your BOYFRIEND to call you.  Dump him and move on.  Trust me, you will be so happy if you do because you will find someone better who treats you right.|`|gDSJpRvTaa	The Blunt Truth...<br>  He just wants to get Laid...<br>  Start saying No and he will stop coming around...|`|QdzecSwdaa	When I was single and had a few girls that I "saw" I would typically use my military career as an excuse to not see them if I was busy, with another girl or just not really wanting to see her.  <br>  He just wants to see you when he is interested in getting laid, thats all, if your ok with that then fine....if not tell him to take a hike|`|sgEloO1Jaa	when you say very young you probably mean teenager still. he just got out of boot and AIT so he is thinking hes big time now and i asure you that your not the only girl he sees. hes young let him be young if he likes you he will come around. be the more mature person  and make him realize himself what hes missing.|`|XJdJ8iHaaa	Sounds like ur wasting ur time|`|n2oEhdZiaa	Just tell him you have emotional needs that his work responsibilities are not allowing him to meet and you need to find someone who has a more flexible schedule in order for you to be happy.|`|9be66fc4a6ca5975f90f22d8c6576b38aa	Truth?

We military folk pride ourselves on being able to accomplish anything and everything we set our minds to. Thus, if you were the thing he tried to accomplish, he'd make it happen.<br>  <br>  As it is, it sounds like he'd rather not have you around at all.

ZLLNnKgzaa	If you are a foreign national then go to your embassy and find out if any passports have been handed in.  I am from Zimbabwe and a while ago I lost my passport and unbelievably it was handed in at the embassy.  <br>  OR check if you have old photocopies of the lost passport for the number. <br>  OR failing that then the best option is to go and report the passport lost at any police station.  They will issue you with a police report.  It takes about 5minutes.  With this report you can then apply for a new one because you would not be required to enter the old passport number because you enclose the police report with the application.<br>  Hope that helps.|`|soUGSKJFaa	Forget your old passport. File  a new one with DFA, then they will see at their record that they have already issued your a passport. Tell them its lost, then they will tell you that they will only issue a new passport if you can present a Affidavit of loss, then ask from them, your passport's number, date and place of issue, etc. And usually there is a notary public within the vicinity for you to get a Affidavit of Loss. Give the details from DFA to the lawyer, tell them you want an affidavit of loss, then the lawyer will make you one, that's its, go back to DFA and file a new one.|`|DW5Eqc8vaa	Before I can assist you with ths matter<br>  <br>  I need to know what country this passport represents<br>  <br>  You should take you bc<br>  <br>  Birth Certificate, health card and any other id<br>  <br>  Driver license, sin cqrd, nexus card<br>  <br>  And apply for a new one|`|AA10258539	If you lost your passport abroad, then you should request for a replacement at your embassy.

If you lost it at home (your country), just go to the passport issuing office and have it replaced.<br>  <br>  The passport number is not needed as they will have your file. If you notice, when they issue a new one, it will have a different number. I suggest your report this immediately so they could cancel this before someone uses this fraudulently.<br>  <br>  Here is a link to how a lost passport can be replaced. Not sure if you are from this country. But good luck anyways.|`|WUYv4LkSaa	I would suggest that you contact the office that issued your passport, with all your proofs of id., and any receipts you may have from when you first got it.|`|kAuQugVKaa	You need to get new one:<br>  <a href="http://www.visahq.com/passport.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.visahq.com/passport.php</a><br>  good luck|`|F75klIL7aa	You should go DFA.
AA11494150	Check your paperwork. Medical expenses not covered by insurance are normally split.|`|BqXSymxjaa	Absolutely not, medical is separate. Support is for food, clothing, school etc... I would check out my child custody papers and see what it specifies about medical responsibility for the child. It should specify who is responsible for it.|`|kAwvPp0zaa	Support is a different matter, entirely, from medical expenses. Support is just that, supporting the kid's living expenses. Support is for rent/mortgage, lights, food, etc. Normal living expenses. <br>  <br>  Medical bills are a separate issue, which should have been addressed in the support order, too. If they have already been addressed, then the order is what it is. If they were not, then go back to family court and get the order in place. <br>  <br>  He does not automatically owe you $3,000. First, you have to prove that it is necessary. Secondly, you have to prove that he is liable. If he has to carry the health insurance, for instance, and he does, but insurance refuses to pay because it is cosmetic, then you are out of luck. If insurance deems it medically necessary, but he didn't buy the coverage, then you have a case against him. <br>  <br>  Your dentist is not the final word on medical necessity; he is trying to sell you $6000 worth of work, after all. You need more than one opinion.|`|NQGpw0x4aa	be happy you even get child support. when i was 12, my dad got my mom to sign a paper once he was laid off from work and that got him off the hook (despite about $250,000 in the bank). he owes her half of my medical bills, orthodontic work, wisdom teeth, education, and 6 years of support. she'll never see the $40,000 or so he owes her|`|g2JqGIOCaa	If the information you posted is correct, then you've answered it already.<br>  <br>  If the judgment for support states that it is separate, then the two of you must split it.  If not, then you should pay it since you are receiving "SUPPORT"...|`|0cfwrcx5aa	he's not giving you that money so you can get your nails done.<br>  <br>  <br>  its for the kid.  if he's paying you money, that money goes to wherever the kid needs it: clothes, food, medicine, etc.|`|5kRZ8RICaa	It all depends what you have agreed on in your divorce decree. If it says he has to pay a certain percentage of medical(if it falls under that category), then he pays that percentage of the bill. You can also take him to court again and again for whatever you want, if you please to do so. <br>  My suggestion is as fallows, if it's not in the decree then use something against him like, "i'll take you to court over this". You'd be surprised on how much leverage that alone can be. Or you can just reason with him, say that you just need the help and if you're paying this amount.. why can't he pay the other. <br>  Also, go speak with your attorney about it. He/she will be able to tell you everything you need to know.|`|AA11587241	Both of you have to pay the bill, split equally.

Unfortunately not all recruits are up to the task upon arrival. With so many people coming from so many different areas having so many different beliefs, it's hard to rely on doctrine to provide guidance in each and every situation. The term "mind games" is what's used to describe the different disciplinary or motivational techniques used by these drill sergeants as they try to accomplish their goal of training soldiers and usually those who are inept to survive in the military will call them such while those who can succeed will recognize them as training techniques used to do everything from build teams to enforce standards. As a former trainer of soldiers, it boils down to influencing, motivating and directing. The problem is scorn from those who couldn't hack it and the abuse of power and authority by those drill sergeants who crossed the line.|`|AA11896070	I have a boyfriend in military and other family members they say that they want to prove how tough you are in case of capture or just holding up under stress. They try to break you allot of the time, pushing you to the limit and playing  with your mind making you think you are nothing and seeing how you handle the situation. Mostly team work to how you work with a team if you mess up they have the whole team get punished for one person so that makes you think in your mind that your a loser even if your not.

So, he's charged with domestic violence. He hit her - she wants to recant her statement right? Yeah. I see that quite often with DV cases.<br>  <br>  Firstly, I've worked a LOT of DV cases and seen plenty of victims recant what they told police originally. I've also never seen a single person get charged for it. It is a crime, but it's rare that she'll get charged with it. As far as that goes, it's a low level misdemeanor that she might get a little probation time, maybe a couple of days in jail or more, or community service. It's right in the same ball park with perjury which I've only seen people serve 24 hours in jail for.<br>  <br>  Some D.A. offices have a "request to drop charges" form that she can fill out.

It is presumed that speed in excess of the posted speed limit is not reasonable and prudent (Veh C 22351), but that presumption can be overcome with contrary evidence.  There is also a maximum speed law, which makes it illegal to go over 65 mph (or 55 mph on a two lane undivided highway) unless otherwise posted.  (Veh C 22349.)  That is an absolute limit.|`|kH0IxFa9aa	They go by Absolute for legal court purposes.<br>  To presume, is like stating "I think he was going over 5 miles an hour" now does that make sense?<br>  Then if they don't have a radar gun, then it's presumed because not all radar guns are accurate.|`|9yoGMz3taa	I believe that is up to the police officers on patrol, moreso than California legislation.<br>  <br>  Some cops are more lenient than others.<br>  <br>  But, please do not drive more than 5 miles over the speed limit.

If you want to take out a loan, they charge you $150 to arrange the loan, plus whatever interest (say 14%), then on top of that they charge you $10 a month "management fee" on top of that.

y4yVmcOVaa	The most honest answer here is not very fulfilling: we don't know.  We don't have any good models of functioning communist states, so it's nearly impossible to say how well it would work. There are some pretty decent ideas out there though.<br>  <br>  First of all, the most basic difference between a communist society and a capitalist society is the values people hold.  Today we work because we need to make money to survive, in a communist state this would not be true.  In theory, we would work because it is the right thing to do. So possibly output would be at an all-time high because of the moral significance of working.<br>  <br>  Traditional economists have been quick to note that communism lacks competition, and therefore has no mechanism to increase productivity.  This is true. If a communist society ever develops, it will be interesting to see how they deal with this issue.<br>  <br>  Efficiency, not taking into account it's rate of change, would probably be higher.  Think of this: in our modern capitalist world there are often hundreds or thousands of companies producing similar if not identical goods (reasonable market substitutes).  In an economy with more planning, we would probably only have one company producing these goods.  Fewer man-hours get wasted since there are fewer companies, and efficiency will increase.<br>  <br>  Some proponents of planned economies suggest that if we all used our labor to it's maximum value and employed everyone on earth, we would each have to work only 4 hours a day to keep things exactly as they are now!|`|TxRRITveaa	No. Communism does not encourage improvement. Whether we like it or not the desire for profit is what drives productivity and improvement. Capitalism is not always perfect and has it's ups and downs. Communism does not reward achievement like capitalism does, thus there is no incentive to do better. Communism was conceived to eliminate class boundaries and make everyone equal. It only suceeds in making everyone equally poor.|`|sLEdPDkHaa	not really, i would not work hard if i knew i could not be fired and get paid  the same as someone working hes butt off|`|YupMCYHlaa	No, that is one of the drawbacks of communism is that it doesn't tend to constantly improve productivity as well as free-market capitalism.<br>  <br>  Now communism has failed just about wherever it's been tried.  Because every country where it's been tried has not had a previous tradition of democracy, so people ended up trading one group of tyrants for another.<br>  <br>  But in Marx's original view, communism is a centrally planned economy.  The govt. decides what is to be manufactured, how many, who gets paid what, etc.  There is no private entrepreneurship.  There is no competition between companies to develop a better or cheaper product.<br>  <br>  However real-world capitalism has its problems too.  Competition is self-defeating because where there is competition there are winners, and where there are clear winners there is no longer competition.  It takes a certain amount of government regulation for capitalism to work, for the govt. to move to insure continued competition.  When wealthy corporations have undue influence on the govt, as they do in the US, then capitalism doesn't work either.<br>  <br>  Socialism (including the sub-category of communism) leads to stability while capitalism builds wealth faster but leads to instability.  So in the US when capitalism crashes (as it's doing now) we move back towards socialism to regain stability.|`|AA12155794	No country is inclined to adopt communism.If it is ideal for productivity many countries would have accepted it.Only China has it violating all norms of humanity.The condition of workers there are horrible.|`|BpcgaJd4aa	Are you kidding?

Morris' claim is based on a misrepresentation of a provision of the bill that would appropriate $4.19 billion "for neighborhood stabilization activities related to emergency assistance for the redevelopment of abandoned and foreclosed homes as authorized under division B, title III of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008."""
55NKPb82aa	Living in a house is a lavish luxury. It is a luxury, not a right, having your own walls and yard, a garden, storage, all that room, redecorating as you want, etc. If you are having money problems, I feel like you have to sell your assets and come down one  level: the renters’ level. You can have a small box you pay rent for. If you cannot pay your mortgage, you need to either sell and then rent or you need to rent to someone while you move to a smaller space. <br>  <br>  But, home owners do not want to move into an apartment, that is beneath them. They like their large spacious houses and feel they deserve them. So, they are not objected to taking government welfare to keep them in their housing, yet they snub people in government housing projects or people who fight for rent control. Well, maybe rightly so, as they got the government to pay for their private houses, not some slummed out crappy housing project.|`|Ao3Fl3iSaa	Yes - but they also understand that the lack of personal responsibility also got us where we are now<br>  <br>  If anyone with a foreclosure should get bailed out, it should be the ones who were laid off and were making payments with a salary that would not have considered them a high risk.<br>  The high risk borrowers that should be helped should be the ones that picked the higher FIXED rate as oppose to the variable and were laid off. In this case, at least they were responsible.<br>  <br>  Why?<br>  While it's true that the predatory lenders went after the redline borrowers, no one FORCED the borrower to get the loan. The borrower took advantage of the low VARIABLE interest rate because most likely the fixed rate would've made the loan impossible to pay or they would have had to struggle to pay it and they didn't want to do so.<br>  In turn, the predatory lender was banking on this and probably figured that the redliners that went with the variable rate would most likely default.|`|xzSuXnvpaa	"Do conservatives understand that people being irresponsible has an impact on all of us?" Yes. The European trip that Pelosi and her Democrat Cronies are on, at tax payer expense, is VERY irresponsible.<br>  <br>  $200,000 just to fly to Italy; and course they will return to the US, there's another $200,000. What is the real value of that trip? None to the American tax payer. That's $400,000 that could have been used for feeding and clothing homeless. But that's okay, Pelosi got those 'precious' birth certificates of her grandparents.|`|2a9MLpZRaa	Oh I do, I realize how a person who runs a large company has a big impact when they act irresponsibly.  I'll do you one better.  You probably have someone in your life, in your town, at your school or your job that everyone thinks is a loser.  A person that most of them think they'd be better off without.  But I can honestly tell you that even that person has a profound effect on the dynamic of the people around them.  It's true things might be better, but that's an over simplification of the many possible variables.  And often people will jump to that because that's what THEY WANT to believe.  However, it is just as likely, that things would be worse off for everyone involved without that person around.  As Jesus himself said, that which you do for the least of my brothers, you do for me.|`|BIQrsl4paa	Yes, we do. That is why we are so concerned about people like Nancy Pelosi and all her cronies, who are planning to spend all of us into oblivion. <br>  Unfortunately, she doesn't see things that way, which seems to be why she is the first Speaker of the House to get her own private jet. <br>  Isn't it wonderful that your liberal Speaker is above flying with all the rest of the riff-raff, don't you just love how she can claim to be "just like you"?|`|QEYFU5Lvaa	Your question exposes one of the fundamental flaws in Conservative ideology, and one almost all Conservatives display.  They can't seem to get it into their heads that our society is essentially a long chain where everyone is a link, and if you get too many weaknesses in that chain it will break.  The fact is we are all linked together and what affects one person will ultimately affect all people. <br>  <br>  I agree that in normal circumstances we should let these businesses fail, and let these individuals lose their houses, but we aren't living in normal times.  Right now these failures are running rampant with no end in sight, and it is severely impacting "responsible" people at no fault of their own.  Conservatives want to let this trend continue while Liberals, economic experts, and common sense say it has to stop now.|`|acc06e32aa1b61885e803d0885de8de2aa	I understand irresponsibility can have an impact if large amounts of people mess up..but how are they or anyone else going to learn right from wrong if we just bail out every Tom, Dick and Harry ?<br>  <br>  People need to learn if you f*ck up you're screwed. Just like every corporation that got a bail out should have been allowed to fail.|`|ZRuJFoUIaa	Yes Republicans are fully aware that people being irresponsible has an impact on all of us, Which is exactly why, The Republican party is the party that advocates responsibility, While the liberal Democrats are against people being responsible for their actions, And quite often promote programs that exacerbate that behavior. I point to abortion and the handing out of condoms in school as prime examples. God bless.|`|0cfwrcx5aa	"ounce of prevention is better than a pound of cure"<br>  <br>  <br>  that is true, if we would have simply let banks say that joe and steve didnt make enough money to buy this property, none of this would have happened.<br>  <br>  but democrats decided that joe and steve should both get houses that they cant really afford (helping them at the start), and forced banks to lend them money.<br>  <br>  and now look at where it has gotten us.<br>  <br>  how backwards your logic is, young padawan.
xNsJqTgaaa	No, you won't.  Drug dealers get worse sentences than tax evaders in all 50 states.  Particularly drug dealers who are also convicted of assualt or domestic abuse(beating his girlfriend) and neglect(not paying support to the women who are on wellfare)  in some states, the 3 strikes law will put you away for life.<br>  <br>  While tax evaders generally don't get life sentences and they generally spend their time in minimum security facilities.<br>  <br>  Also, the fella was wrong about your tax bill, your net income would be 828k anually, a very taxable income.  <br>  <br>  Now think about your crime.  The basic tax rate of 35% means you skipped $289,800 a year for 20 year equalling 5.796 million dollars.  Or if you had a really good tax man, maybe you get a 10% tax rate for a total of 1.656 million....<br>  <br>  So your crime is stealing between 1.656 million to 5.796 million from the American people, that is quite a crime considering all that past Americans have sacrificed to give you the opportunities to make so much money.<br>  <br>  If you had just paid your taxes, how many cops could have been hired with that money to catch these drug dealers and put them away? So from a point of view, your crime may have been worse.  Everything depends on a certain point of view.  Didn't Obi Wan Kenobi say something like that?|`|AA10818613	Last time I looked, drug dealers don't list their occupation with the IRS or their income.  so your argument is extremely bogus.|`|xh5EuJlbaa	fail|`|X6RwSrJjaa	Your talking about the income tax?

It is illegal to lie on the forum, being that its a legal document. But no one is making you write out the document. The cases that the IRS file on people is of poor income families that cannot fight back, because the IRS seizes all their funds. And even then it is at a state level because the supreme court has labeled it unconstitutional. Here is how retarded it is, go to the IRS website and they have a sub-page directed to something along the lines of "BEWARE OF PEOPLE TELLING YOU DONT HAVE TO FILE A 10-40" And it gives the reasons that what I have just said as false.

And I don't think that there are too many drug dealers who bother with reporting their income.

9p2wQ21Aaa	Much more than your Imagination,|`|fO8sn3m4aa	Iran is very powerful compared to Iraq or Afghanistan. Prior to the invasion Afghanistan it was destroyed by a decade of war and had the lowest military budget in the world. Iraq was of course completely annihilated during gulf war one and had very little military infrastructure left.  Iran however is much larger than Iraq and, through a defense pact with Russia, has acquired advanced missile systems.  These missile system are far more advance than those possessed by the US. The US has sub-sonic cruise missiles, iran has Mach 3 anti-shipping missiles, the Moskit and the Onyx (super sunburn) the later of which is independently guided and is capable of sinking an Aircraft carrier (and designed to do this). These missiles are plasma stealth and impossible to defend against. During war games scenarios a virtual war with Iran resulted in the sinking of every US ship in the region. This left the only possible victory scenario to be a Nuclear strike. Iran possesses potent anti missile technology (more sophisticated than the patriot or arrow systems) known as the Tor M1 (and is trying to acquire the more advanced S300). This means nuclear delivery becomes difficult. A successful nuclear attack however would result in retaliation and its believed that the Iranians posses a large quantity of bio weapons as-well as sleeper agents world wide, the results of which would be devastating.<br>  <br>  Intercontinental missiles are only used to attack and Iran has repeatedly said it has no intention of attacking anyone.

JdOhkCPAaa	Honestly the media . It was literally full of misconceptions about Ron Pauls ideas and I see they worked here being many people called his ideas extreme . You had every republican candidate in the media spotlight except Paul . First it was Giuliani ,then Romney, then Huckabee and finally Mccain . Ron Paul who drew the most amount of money (from individuals not special interests like other candidates I might add) was completely ignored or degraded by the media . Now that they have a status quo candidate in the white house he is now a familiar face on CNN and Fox now .But I am sure if he were to run again in 2012 he would be relegated to non-existant once again .|`|ijDgKdcxaa	It would have been the first time I would have voted for a republican if they did!

Wouldn't that be sweet?  (just have different avatars of course)<br>  <br>  Anyway, people didn't nominate Ron Paul because they were skillfully misled by the mainstream media into believing that only McCain stood a chance against the opposition because of his wartime record.  They were made fools when they pledged their allegiance with a guy in which the MEDIA SELECTED FOR THEM.<br>  <br>  Not to mention that Ron Paul wasn't even invited to his own party's debate at one point.  This along with a ton of other evidence (every 'candidate' was a CFR member) proves that the elections were staged.  Giuliani?  I mean seriously....who the hell would EVER vote for that moron?  He's like Bush's retarded little brother.  Yet he was up there as a mere prop giggling and gooing like a little school girl at Ron Paul's revolutionary ideas.....it made me want to punch that bastard in his lisp.  Yes, I said 'lisp'.<br>  <br>  Don't forget....  All mainstream media is owned by 5 different companies (Time Warner, GE, Walt Disney, Viacom, and Newscorp) and all 5 have massive defense contracts with the government.  To allow Ron Paul to become president and make his massive proposed budget cuts (which would actually happen based on his record), it would be financially detrimental to all 5 companies.  So, they wanted to make sure their puppets remained happy with their 6 figure incomes as they continue to preach propaganda on the evening news in support for their governmental interests.|`|482oQASHaa	Romey M, Bush is a idiot<br>  <br>  The reason why  Republicans  did not nominate Ron Paul, is because  he is against what Bush, and Mccain stand for.. Paul had difference beliefs then the GOP. and then they was willing to do everything it took to block him out from the debates. everything Mccain said, about our economy Ron Paul would be against. it's too bad they are close minded. cause they will regret passing on him|`|aGNjZmyJaa	Because they thought Palin being a heartbeat from the Presidency was better.|`|vx9KtFqjaa	He is not a puppet?

He is very conservative, but I thought him honest and sincere and I liked a lot of his policies and ideas.  Of course, some things were extreme, but that is why this country has checks and balances.  Many people did not take him seriously, however, I really thought he would be a good choice for people who were tired of the same old machine running this country.  I am sick of the tired old  regular republicans and democrats.|`|XxUByikJaa	I am an older voting Democrat who has Republican friends . And honestly there is a big difference between the Neo Con Republican and the the Republican voter over all. Neo Cons are Not honest and they do put profit above Patriotism and Integrity .

I think Republicans should be careful who they nominate next time .<br>  This is only my opinion.|`|p5F2LtmNaa	If Ron Paul runs in 2012, he will have my vote!

I even had the opportunity to watch Saddam being hanged (via cell phone video). He got what he deserved.<br>  I, too agree with public executions. What I don't agree with, is the ban on "Cruel and Unusual Punishment". If the object of executions is to teach others what not to do, wouldn't "Cruel and Unusual" be a better deterrent than "Humane"?

ECegmuCRaa	first of all<br>  <br>  thanks for answering my military question earlier, my turn to return the favor.<br>  <br>  we haven't taken over because America is not a nation who busts down doors unless necessary ( or what is seen as necessary ) and i don't think UN would be happy with us if we decided to invade Mexico. And the reason we don't discuss becoming one nation is because we simply don't have the money in our economy right now, and even if we did look at the downside, more people to support in our nation, taxes would go up as sure as rice is white, and we have enough unemployment problems.... what is their job situation? <br>  <br>  hope i helped you as much as you helped me my friend <br>  <br>  thanks again|`|y4yVmcOVaa	I'm going to answer your questions out of order, but I will get to all of them.<br>  <br>  2.  Mexico's military is not very powerful, compared to the USA.  According to CIA Factbook,  Mexico's military has about 39% the manpower of the US military.  This does not take into account military spending or fungible power, like diplomatic or economic strength.<br>  <br>  1 and 3. It is debatable we would gain a lot of military strength from invading Mexico.  Although we would have more people that are eligible for military duty, our federal spending would have to increase to govern the new area. This would mean much less spending on defense per area.  <br>  <br>  Also, the US probably wouldn't see much benefit from taking over Mexico. Mexico does not have an abundance of resources we need.<br>  <br>  There is enormous cost involved in taking over even poorly defended countries with small areas: Mexico is somewhat large and has terrain suitable for guerrilla warfare.  <br>  <br>  5.  Joining nations is a different deal entirely.  The biggest reason why we don't do it? It's complicated, and doesn't produce many good results.  The US Federal government is designed to be inefficient, and so something as complicated and controversial as annexing another country would almost never get passed.<br>  <br>  Additional detail:<br>  <br>  It would probably not make us more powerful. In case the domestic issues weren't wasteful enough, globalization would make sure the rest of the world wouldn't play with us.|`|2OPaqkLcaa	Mexico has a lot of political corruption and drug cartels that have more control then the government.<br>  <br>  You don't invade a country just because they are not strong enough to defend themselves, and doing so would just create an Afghanistan right next door.<br>  <br>  The US has enough problems of its own with out taking on the myriad of problems Mexico faces.|`|AE7LFXUwaa	Would be disastrous because we would inherit all of Mexico's problems...the drug trade would likely run rampant through the states... and think of all those poor folks that would be on welfare...would suck our already depleted government dry...Mexico is controlled by crime families and the US border is their only obstacle from the states...even that doesnt completely stop them from kidnapping Americans...the Mexican military is weaker than the firepower of the drug cartels|`|8ivnzNi5aa	That may be coming, along with merging with Canada to form this "North American Union" we keep hearing about on sites like these.  As other posters have said, do you really want the rampant official corruption of Mexico in this country?  They make Chicago politicians look good by comparison.|`|6f8f287636470ac7d7b5c8f6a091fb57aa	the mexican army is weak but the drug cartels do have weapons and have been piling them up for quite some time
m3q6CIQMaa	House arrest just means you are monitored via an ankle bracelet.  You are not surrounded by cops....if they wanted to do that you would be in jail LOL.  The ankle bracelet is like a GPS.  The police station will be aware of your whereabouts and such.|`|a6j7Bu9daa	They get tagged usually around the ankle, if this is removed or the person goes out of range from the base unit in the house it alerts the police etc. People can also have curfues, if the person doesant come home by a certain time the police are notified. <br>  <br>  There was a program about them on tv in england, the amount of problems there are with them. People was saying they would rather go to prison than wear one because they were so unrealiable and the police where coming around not believing they were at home. That was a few years ago tho im sure they are alot better now|`|QX28VLtKaa	They put a ankle bracelet on you so they know if you leave your house!|`|91f68d84e5baee88c4ba91159a357ae4aa	To make sure you follow the rules you wear an electronic tag about the size of a fat digital watch.

iWLeHnlnaa	WOW! looks like the Anti's can't answer your question. And Stonecold didn't included any links, so how do we know he's not making it up?<br>  <br>  It's not only the cost and long drawn out process that leads many to come here illegally, it's the Visa Lottery, and this is something many forget. If these immigrant's families are already starving, or in danger, a father/husband is not going to wait around and put their family at risk.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://judiciary.house.gov/legacy/camarota042904.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://judiciary.house.gov/legacy/camaro...</a><br>  What’s Wrong With the Visa Lottery?<br>  <br>  The visa lottery is probably the strangest part of our immigration system. We actually run a system where people send in a postcard, which is now done electrically, and then names are drawn out of a hat, with 50,000 winners each year given permanent residence in the United States. The winners need not have even one family member in the United States, or any particular job skill that is supposed to be in need, nor is any compelling humanitarian reason required. All they need is the desire to come and some luck. There are many problems with the such a system, but five stand out: <br>  <br>  1) it is administratively burdensome; <br>  2) it encourages illegal immigration; <br>  3) it invites fraud; 4) it creates a great opportunity for terrorists; <br>  5) it serves no purpose.|`|tOBUxfYvaa	Your question is.....Do you think that people coming illegally to the USA can afford a visa? <br>  My answer is yes, they can. If they're able to afford a coyote, they can afford a visa. Besides that, if they have money for a coyote, they shouldn't be starving. They have money to feed themselves and their family so if they're using that money for a coyote rather than food, it tells us they aren't coming here "for a better life", they're coming for another reason.|`|oKU7tFWyaa	A lot cheaper than a coyote.<br>  <br>  Fees for Visa Services<br>  <br>  Coming to the U.S. Temporarily - Nonimmigrant Visa Services<br>  Coming to the U.S. Permanently - Immigrant Services<br>  Special Visa Services<br>  <br>  The following lists fees for visa application and other types of processing fees collected by Department of State.

zSABr7praa	My husband and I are not stationed in Japan, so I can't tell you which MOS would "land" you over there.  However, friends of ours are stationed there and I can share with you a little of their experience.  The Marine was an Artillery officer, and went from arty school at Fort Sill in OK to Okinawa.  He and his wife were given the opportunity to give their preference on where they'd like to be stationed, and their top choice was Okinawa (i'm not sure if enlisted Marine's have the opportunity to select preference, I could be wrong though!)<br>  <br>  As a married couple, they only had one car between them, and stored it at a storage facility in Dallas, Texas (free).  I imagine there are other places to store it, Dallas was just the closet to us in Oklahoma.<br>  <br>  As far as what there is to do, I couldn't really help you much, but from pictures, it looks beautiful.  My friend got a job teaching english to japanese children (with an entirely unrelated degree).  On their weekends together, they go sight seeing.<br>  <br>  Best of luck!!

Though, if you threw out the churchy stuff, and Law and Order stuff, you would be a decent Libertarian.|`|217c8796b5373a65275202f935b6fcdbaa	You sound Libratarian Ron Paul Supporter.|`|jV8GTDnqaa	You sound like a logical person which is what we need.  I support libertarians like you.|`|uvbSl7zYaa	Liberal yes, except for the gun control part. <br>  Civil liberties can not be held without some government control.  Otherwise we would have complete anarchy.  We need the military.  It is really the only part of our government that is needed under the Constitution.  Government organization of the military in necessary because of the size and scope of it, and our enemies.  It is foolish to believe that if we disbanded the military that we would be left alone.  We would be conquered in a heartbeat by the fastest nation to get here.  Everyone should be proud to join and be part of that military and the protection of our nation.  That is true patriotism, not deserting, that is selfish behavior.  <br>  So whether you consider yourself a liberal, or an anarchist is the real question.  I really don't think that even the Democrats would latch on to your beliefs.|`|2ieiGIhTaa	I don't know what your political affiliation is, but you clearly do not know the difference between a question and a rant.|`|ZOXoPgJbaa	you are more closely related to conservatives, but not neocons. <br>  Maybe you are a classic liberal, paleoconservative, Jeffersonian Republican, or even a libertarian.

AA12191521	I am a disabled person on SSDI and medicare. I'm also a disabled vet getting a VA pension and "free" healthcare at the VA Hospital. Now the free care at the VA is worth every penny I pay for it. You did note that its free so I pay nothing for it and that is ecactly what its worth. There's never a need to go inside a VA hospital. Just stop outsuide and smash your head against the wall for 10 years or until you get bored then go back home and die slowly and painfully in a dark closet. Its the same effect as going inside. But medicare is great even though it costs a little more. I can go to any doctor I need, the same year I needed him too. How's that for classy? Appointments in less than a year. Really its not a joke! Sure I have to pay 20% but I got my VA pension to cover that. So I'm doing ok now. And if the VA ever wants to take care of you, shoot them in the face. Those miserable bastards will destroy your life.|`|bfe4ad38e28ddda61b321173866c1f9aaa	Actually, they do have a form of the American dream.  They are being supported without having to work at anything because they are disabled.  The American dream is to have the individual through hard work, create his own success story.  Welfare, SSI, and other entitlement programs are only to support people who can not work and is suppose to cover just the basics.|`|IH6NrVNBaa	SSI recipients should consider themselves lucky that our government is willing to pay them for doing nothing.  Many of them are sucking money out of a system that they haven't paid a dime into.  The "pursuit of happiness" doesn't mean that the "american dream" has to be provided to you, at taxpayer expense.|`|2a9MLpZRaa	Well I look at it like this.  One of my hands is very clearly messed up, by all points and accounts I am disabled.  But because I've worked for a time during my adult life and went to college, SSA wants to fight it, so I have to  go get a physical from a  doctor that is priced well outside of my range to get the application process going.  SSA is just a way for the government to take money from people that they don't deserve.   Sure they say they're using it for some noble purpose but when the time comes to do what they say they're taking the money for, they don't do it.  And not just me, I've seen it happen case after case after case.

Ce dernier aura donc du mal à défendre le programme qui n'est pas exactement le sien. <br>  - Besancenot, Laguiller, Buffet et Bové : vont disperser les votes, mais pourraient aussi orienter les débats publics (radio, TV).<br>  - On pourra?t aussi avoir Chevènnement qui s'inscrive pour la bataille<br>  <br>  Au centre : <br>  L'UDF de Bayrou, qui a fait le pari risqué d'exister sans l'UMP, et qui tient le choc.

Je vois mal les électeurs de l'UDF aller en masse se reporter à gauche quand même.<br>  <br>  A droite : <br>  Aucun mystère à l'UMP, c'est Sarkozy qui ira (il dirige le Parti). Libéral au sens anglo-saxon du terme, il est déroutant car il virevolte entre les idées, avec un air de populisme qui pla?t, en France comme à l'étranger. <br>  MPF : de Villiers n'est pas mort, il se présente comme une alternative républicaine à Le Pen, mais ?a sent toujours aussi mauvais. Il a intégré dans ses rangs un petit nouveau qui recrute chez les jeunes et dépoussière le parti. Il va aussi fortement orienter les débats.<br>  FN : Le Pen est toujours là, et on sait qu'il n'a pas besoin d'être présent sur la scène politique pour engranger des voix. Je ne le vois pas au second tour.<br>  <br>  Au final : un second tour DSK/Sarkozy, et vu le rapport de force, c'est Sarkozy qui l'emporte car il va raffler un max de voix de Le Pen et de Villiers au second tour, voire dès le premier vu qu'il marche sur leurs plates-bandes.|`|6950d0427884b04df708f7558417be15aa	BOUTEFLIKA|`|78f58c825f62d5d03efbf02a2e6dbec0aa	segolene roal|`|a7a10046270847891ce4c8ff658f25deaa	aucun des prétendants plus ou moins prévu.<br>  Ils ne pensent qu'à leur petit bonheur personnel.

l4pVsxoraa	JTF2 is the Canadian equivalent of the British SAS.    There are many areas in which they are highly trained and well equipped.  Reconnaissance while behind enemy lines, counter terrorism, commando type operations.   All very hush hush and if you're not a member you really don't know all of what they do.  You can't just join the JTF2.  You must first join the Canadian Forces.  You expressed interest in being a medic with them.  That means that you'd have to be recruited in the Forces as a Medical Assistant (or medical doctor if you are one) go through basic and trades training and be posted to a unit.  JTF2 sends out calls for volunteers every couple of years or so.  Once your in the Forces and find out about the call for volunteers you put your name in and see what happens.<br>  <br>  Very tough and demanding physically and mentally.  Highly trained in many areas ranging from weapons knowledge to parachuting, scuba diving etc etc.

That was from 9/12/2001 all the way to late 2003, right around the time we were finding out that there were no WMDs in Iraq, and that Bush had been told that by every single intelligence agency looking into it (including CIA).

That is that you give him the benefit of the doubt, you support him when he does right, and only attack if he fails, and let it go if he realizes the mistake and fixes it.<br>  <br>  That is the standard that we held Bush to, he just refused to acknowledge his failure and even try to fix it; that is why he lost the approval rating.

Because the UK government does not regulate UK families in the kind of way (say) the Chinese government regulates families in China. The fundamental difference is in China the government is trying to tackle the terrible problem of overpopulation by restricting the number of children any family can have to two. In contrast in the UK, rightly or wrongly, we also have a very serious growing overpopulation problem, But far from the UK government trying to tackle it the united Conservative, Labour and Liberal parties seem to be doing everything in their power to exacerbate it. Such as by encouraging excessive immigration into UK even though the overwhelming majority of the UK population whatever way they vote in elections utterly disagree with. By giving incentives to mothers to have far more children than they can responsibly cope with. By glorification and rewarding of single parenthood, by evolving a benefit system ideally suited to encourage the workshy not to work and by otherwise also rewarding irresponsibility and stupidity wherever.|`|KDNWFuZWaa	From the minute a child is born you have to constantly go to check ups, even if there is nothing wrong and all is going well. Then by 1 year old they are trying to make every mother go back to work so the child can then get put into a care system,( where the lack of love is causing a society not to care) to be looked after by child minders, nursery workers etc. They keep notes on these children which follows them through out their lives. You have to constantly be seen to socialising your children (desensitising them to every different belief system other than your own). basically constant interference when in the majority of cases it is not necessary.<br>  They also have a wonderful way of paying single parents and families, so it is better for people to separate than to stay together, which then makes you wonder do they want poorer families not to succeed, by making them split up to get enough money to live, so in theory keeping the better standard of living just for the wealthier people.<br>  It is not so much regulation, more interference that this government does.

And insist that your manager takes the paycheck and accepts your dear apologises. You could try suing the manager, your employer and the HR manager but would that even work. Dont let someone else force you into saying you had quit when you dont want to do that. Ask for the suspenison to be delayed or something. Why dont you ask for a temporary suspenison or something.

There's also this little fact:<br>  <br>  The Alaska state constitution claims common heritage rights of ownership of oil and other minerals for the people of the state as a whole. Citizen dividend checks are distributed every year in Alaska out of the interest payments to an oil royalties deposit account called the Alaska Permanent Fund (APF) created in 1976 after oil was discovered on the North Slope. The APF is a public trust fund - a diversified stock, bond and real estate portfolio - into which are deposited the oil royalties received from the corporations which extract the oil from the lands of Alaska. The first citizen dividend check from the interest of the APF was issued in 1982 and was for $1000 per every person for everyone in Alaska who had resided in the state for at least one year. Annual citizen dividends have been issued every year since then, for a total of more than $23,000 per person. <br>  <br>  In 2003, each of the nearly 600,000 Alaska US citizens (residents of Alaska for at least one year) received a check for $1,107 from the APF. The total amount dispersed was $663.2 million. The $25 billion investment fund's core experienced stock market losses which led to the dividend's decline this past year compared to the several previous years. The amount was $433 less, a 28 percent drop from the 2002 pay out of $1,540, and a 44 percent decrease from the all-time high of $1,964 in year 2000. The amount changes based on a five-year average of APF investment income derived from the bonds, stock dividends, real estate and other investments. <br>  <br>  Alaska relies on oil for about 80 percent of its revenue and has no sales or income tax. Alaska state government is mandated to invest 25% of its oil revenue into the APF while the other 75% of oil royalty revenue is dispersed to other government funds to finance education, infrastructure and social services. If 100% of Alaska's oil royalties had been deposited into the APF, it is conceivable that the CD this year could have been about $4,400 or $17,600 for a family of four. But then there would have been no funds for roads, education and other public services and no funds available to run the state legislature - a libertarian dream fulfillment or a social and economic disaster, which one we will never know. If state services were to have been maintained while 100% of oil royalties were deposited in the APF, there would of course have been the need for income, sales and other taxes on wages and production. <br>  Source(s):<br>  <a href="http://www.earthrights.net/docs/oilrent...." rel="nofollow">http://www.earthrights.net/docs/oilrent....</a> <br>  <br>  Oil is just 1 of thousands of commodities, with all the thousands of commidities in your state why aren't you getting paid?<br>  <br>  With feds resources why can't feds pay 50 times better than Alaska?<br>  <br>  Kuwait pays this way $58,000 y no rent, utilities, phone, hospital bills<br>  Dubia pays this way<br>  Norway I've heard has a similar system<br>  I hear Nigeria is working on doing this<br>  <br>  HOW FAR WILL YOU, YOUR KIDS, AND GRANDCHILDREN GET LEFT BEHIND IN THE VERY NEAR FUTURE IF THE US DOES START A SYSTEM OF THIS KIND FOR THE US PEOPLE?<br>  <br>  ARE WE TO BE PAUPER THIRD CLASS WORLD CITIZENS WHEN YOUR GRANDCHILDREN START TO WORK?<br>  <br>  DO WE SLIDE FROM THE RICHEST NATION TO THE POOREST IN YOUR LIFETIME BECAUSE YOU LACK THE COURAGE, NERVE, OR BACKBONE TO TAKE ACTION NOW WHEN IT'S NEEDED?<br>  <br>  VOTE!

Y muchas veces nuestra primera reacción es rechazo, agresión, temor o desconcierto, lamentablemente muy pocas veces humor...<br>  Ejemplos:<br>  -De inicio por falta de vocabulario, alemanes trataban de ayudarme a comprender gritando sinónimos (su acento es muy "duro", y gritando lo refuerzan más)<br>  -Su forma tan directa de halar utilizando adjetivos duros: "Tienes una forma muy primitiva de trabajar, los cubiertos deben pulirse rápidamente o quedan manchas, yo lo hago"<br>  -Su forma de ofrecer ayuda: "La forma en que desea bajar la carreola es muy estúpida, le voy a ense?ar a hacerlo mejor".<br>  -Sin olvidar lo incómodo que es cuando en familia gustan de desvestirse en prescencia de uno cuando se hacen visitas familiares...<br>  <br>  Todos estos ejemplos que muestran actitudes positivas de parte de gente alemana, me causo de inició gastritis, pero gracias a mi marido (alemán), y por él, "contrui un puente" para adaptarme, una ayuda que no tienen muchos inmigrantes...|`|61e18955b479f7fd662f134914439989aa	Te apoyo, no soy nada racista pero sería bueno que tuvieran presente que si van a dejar el país, van a dejar también su cultura y todo...deberían prepararse mentalmente para ir aceptando otra cultura.

No hay nada mejor que la casa de uno.|`|AA11828295	Who said that ?|`|DIAKSsioaa	He leido a todos en sus comentarios, la situacion no es tan facil,  es obvio que al migrar a un pais tienes que adaptarte a sus reglas a una forma de vida, a unos beneficios y obligaciones que tu mismo elegiste. Pero tienes todo el derecho de elegir que respetas y a que te adaptas o mejor dicho que respetas y a lo que no te adaptas. El punto no es caer en el estereotipo de que los latinos que vienen son una bola de ignorantes, obreros o pachucos que solo vienen aqui tratandose de aislar. Aunque la mayoria de la poblacion latina que viene es de esa humilde condicion y carente de modales. Hay otra parte que vivimos aqui, con profesion y estudios a nivel maestria y doctorado, esa es mi condicion aqui y te puedo compartir que conozco muchas personas de origen latino e incluso europeas que somos respetuosas del modo de vida, leyes y costumbres norteamericanas, pero por encima de todo no olvidamos nuestros origenes, valores y la solidaridad que nos caracteriza. Desafortunadamente la solidaridad no es un valor de la sociedad norteamericana como tampoco lo es, el invertir tiempo en las personas llamese esposa e hijos o en generar una mejor calidad de vida y no hablo en terminos de dinero o consumo, que es lo que tienes aqui, hablo en disfrutar la vida y no solo vivir para trabajar y ser patriotero poniendo una bandera afuera de tu casa o usandola en la ropa interior. Te puedo decir en todo el tiempo que llevo aqui he conocido de todo , norteamericanos buena onda y otros conservadores y la caracteristica es la misma poca vinculacion en las relaciones, friamente con las posibilidades y el dinero. Vinculacion, afecto significa problemas, la gente no hace mas de lo que tiene que hacer, podria contarte muchas conductas que he observado donde practicamente la gente se lava las manos (dijera la tipica expresion) , donde los parametros son solo en relacion a cuanto tienes o cuanto me redituas. Adaptarse a eso para un latino o europeo es muy muy dificil. Yo creo que siempre y cuando respetes la forma de ser y el entorno en el que vives estas en todo tu derecho de elegir que hacer , con quien te juntas, que comer, a donde ir o como ser con tus verdaderos amigos y familia. Ahi nadie tiene derecho a decirte pierde tu identidad porque vives en mi pais. Yo no se si tu vivas aqui en USA o si has observado un poquito mas alla sobre la imposicion de una cultura, ojo con los norteamericanos, incluso en europa y otros lugares de latinoamerica se remiten a pedir solo hamburguesas... y a buscar starbucks por donde van.|`|NFQQOT1Iaa	Es una pena que un pais tan lindo sea bombardeado con costumbres y cultura inferior como lo es la mejicana.|`|QqTDnByVaa	Yo creo todos los immigrantes que viven en US. estan integrados a vivir y a trabajar aqui por lo tanto son libres de gozar de su cultura .tu te das cuenta cuantos immigrantes viven en  US, cuanto hayudan a que esta economia se mantengan a flote, cada persona immigrante a dado parte de su vida y su familia para mantener  a US. que fue fundado por immigrantes y esclavos , Yo creo que tienes  saber de cultura y la historia y la immigracion en US. para que tu te refieres  ideas sin fundamento|`|f37041135ac7ba0f643b90e148068b43aa	No es fácil hacer el duelo del exilio.<br>  Y cuando el país de recepción tiene características tan distintas al país del inmigrante, la cuestión es dramática.<br>  Me hizo gracia tu última afirmación: "Manten tu cultura, pero por favor no trates de imponerla en el resto del mundo".

Incluso , he estado en ceremonias para ciudadanos americanos y lo primero que se les dice es que "hoy te integras a nuestra sociedad americana, pero nucna te olvides de donde vienes , de donde procedes, donde naciste, de tu cultura o de quien eres..y habla con mucho orgullo de ello vayas a donde vaya o estes donde estes" a mi lo que no me gusta son los delincuentes que vienen hacer dano a USA ( y tmpoco me gusta el americano que hace dano a la gente de otros paises ) Con respeto a lo que has dicho de eso de los ninhos blancos.. eso solo se ve ene las familias ignorantes.. en las familias que no toman el tiempo de ensenarles espanol a sus hijos.<br>  <br>  No se trata de imponer nada, se trata de asimilar cada cultura aprender d esta d la misma manera que tu vas a aprender d la mia. Hay que saber muy bien de que se esta hablando cuando mencionas la palabra "integrarse" .<br>  <br>  Ojo: por el hecho de que vayas a otro pais no significa que te vas a olvidar de TU cultura, eso es algo que JAMAS se le podria pedir a una persona , ya que hay que respetar la cutura y la procedencia de las demas personas.<br>  <br>  Yo estoy muy de acuerdo que se luche no solo por conservar la cutura del pais este sea cual sea.. pero que tmb se luche por promover otras culturas por que estas nos pueden enriquecer como ser humano y nos ayuda a crecer en todos los aspectos de nuestras vidas.<br>  <br>  Otra cosa, no se por que dices que mayores de 8 anhos ( muy pocos ) se llegan a integrar en Estados Unidos.. estas equivocadisimo.. yo te puedo presentar a muchos amigos/as latinos,europeros,asiticos,indios que se han integrado muy bien a este pais. Y otra cosa, cuando dices eso de "negar su cultura" eso es muy cierto , hay muchas personas que niegan de donde son solo pro el miedo de ser rechazado ante los demas.. y esas son las consecuencias de la dichosa "integracion" como tu le llamas.<br>  <br>  Como he dicho aoyo fielmente la idea de que se "integren" siempre y cuando no se falte el respeto , se peuda convivir con las demas personas, y sobre todo no se les "OBLIGUE"  a una persona OLVIDARSE de donde vienen.<br>  <br>  Al leer tu post, siento qu eno hablas como si vivieras en Estados Unidos, pues todo lo que dices no tiene sentido y no es la realidad de lo que verdaderamente esta pasando.

The US would spend millions a year and the US government would get nothing hence them outlawing internet gambling. <br>  <br>  Other reasons are because there's no checks in place to check that the companies are performing morally. They can't check companies if they have set the game to never win or the percentage of winning is much lower than required.

He used a Winchester Model 70, the standard USMC issue sniper rifle for the time.<br>  <br>  The story about the .50 cal comes from a true incident which happened while he was on MP rotation.  He was posted in a bunker on a hilltop overlookind a rice paddy, and the assigned weapon for that position was a Mk 2 .50 cal machine gun.  Just for kicks, he mounted the scope from his sniper rifle on the upper receiver, and a short time later he saw a Vietnamese teenager wheeling a bicycle loaded down with AK-47s across the paddy dike.  Using the .50 cal and his scope, he fired off one round and blew off the front tire of the bike.  The kid was knocked flying, and when he got up he grabbed an AK and started shooting.  Since he was now officially a combatant, Hathcock took aim and fired another single round, killing the VC with a single shot.  The distance was measured out to be 2,500 feet, a record which stood until 2002 when a Canadian army team bested it.<br>  <br>  But for the record, he did NOT use the .50 cal as a regular sniper weapon.|`|1fd30eaf0be11306a507370fcb7dd557aa	modified Winchester Model 70 <br>  scope-mounted Browning M-2 .50 caliber machine gun

Las mujeres embarazadas llegaban solas al asilo para pobres, con el rostro cubierto y permanencia en celdas aisladas, aun en el momento del parto; ello con la anuencia de la Iglesia.<br>  <br>  Desde el Código de 1871 ya se contemplaban las atenuantes para el caso de aborto por móviles de honor, con una pena de dos a?os de prisión, regla seguida por el Código de 1929. En cuanto a la legislación penal federal, desde dicho código se sanciona el aborto consentido, procurado y sufrido.<br>  <br>  En su Artículo 569 definía: 'llámese aborto en derecho penal a la extracción del producto de la concepción y a su expulsión provocada por cualquier medio, sea cual fuere la época de la pre?ez, siempre que esto se haga sin necesidad. Cuando ha comenzado ya el octavo mes del embarazo, se le da también el nombre de parto prematuro artificial, pero se castiga con las mismas penas'.<br>  <br>  Cabe mencionar que en dicha legislación (1871) la conducta incriminada se definía a través de la maniobra abortiva, esto es, el acto de la extracción o expulsión provocada del producto. En tanto que en el Código federal vigente, lo que se incrimina es la consecuencia final, es decir, la muerte del producto, de donde se deriva la protección de la vida.<br>  <br>  Siglo XX<br>  <br>  El texto vigente corresponde al Código federal promulgado en 1931, donde establece que: 'Aborto es la muerte del producto de la concepción, en cualquier momento de la pre?ez', 'Al que hiciera abortar a una mujer se le aplicaran de uno a tres a?os de prisión, sea cual fuere el medio que empleare, siempre y cuando lo haga con el consentimiento de ella...'. ' Se impondrá de seis meses a un a?o de prisión a la madre que voluntariamente procure su aborto o consienta que otro la haga abortar, si concurren estas tres circunstancias', (artículos 329, 330 y 332, respectivamente).<br>  <br>  Hay que mencionar que aun cuando dicho Código ha influido decrecientemente en las legislaciones estatales del país, en la actualidad hay textos penales estatales que establecen excepciones de no punibilidad más amplias.<br>  <br>  Fue hasta 1972, durante la primera convivencia feminista, cuando más de 100 mujeres examinaron la legislación relacionada con el tema y discutieron sobre el control de la natalidad y los métodos anticonceptivos.<br>  <br>  Un a?o después, el gobierno presentó un proyecto para una nueva Ley General de Población; en el que se reconoce al aborto como un problema social. <br>  <br>  También reforma y adiciona varios artículos constitucionales, particularmente el cuarto que establece que el varón y la mujer son iguales ante la ley y que ''toda persona tiene el derecho a decidir de manera libre, responsable e informada sobre el número y espaciamiento de sus hijos''.<br>  <br>  En 1974 con las reformas de Luis Echeverría se incluye como garantía individual y con el fin de asegurar y reconocer la integración de la mujer al proceso político. De igual forma se insertan los dos párrafos de su pronunciamiento, en los que se dispone que toda persona tiene derecho a decidir, de manera libre, responsable e informada sobre el número y espaciamiento de sus hijos.<br>  <br>  Asimismo, se aprobó una nueva política demográfica en la que se tomó en consideración el importante papel de las mujeres en el desenvolvimiento colectivo del Estado moderno, consignando en un párrafo particular el derecho a la libre procreación como garantía personal.<br>  <br>  Movimiento de mujeres<br>  <br>  El Movimiento Nacional de Mujeres (MNM) inicia, en 1976, la primera Jornada Nacional sobre la Liberalización del Aborto, en la que sugirió que la interrupción del embarazo fuera libre y gratuita, con la voluntad y decisión de la mujer, y practicable en todas las instituciones de salud pública.<br>  <br>  Además, exigió ampliar la información sobre el uso de anticonceptivos, así como subsidios gubernamentales para la investigación científica de los mismos, a fin de no perjudicar la salud de las mujeres y evitar esterilizaciones forzosas.<br>  <br>  En su momento, la Secretaría de Gobernación, a través del Consejo Nacional de Población (Conapo), constituyó el Grupo Interdisciplinario para el Estudio del Aborto (GIEA), cuyos integrantes concluyeron quitar de la legislación mexicana actual toda sanción penal a las mujeres que por cualquier razón o circunstancia decidan abortar, así como a los médicos que lo practiquen (el aborto), cuando exista la voluntad expresa de la mujer.<br>  <br>  En 1977, luego de la segunda Jornada Nacional sobre la Liberalización del Aborto, convocada por la Coalición de Mujeres Feministas (CMF), las feministas presentaron a la Gran Comisión de la Cámara de Diputados el texto final de los trabajos, en el que rechazan el aborto como un medio de control natal y defendieron la maternidad voluntaria.<br>  <br>  Al a?o siguiente, diputadas de PRI denunciaron la existencia de ''la industria negra clandestina de abortos'', estimando las ganancias en 9 mil millones de pesos libres de impuestos; en tanto que los registros oficiales establecían que al a?o se efectuaban un millón de abortos.<br>  <br>  Es en este mismo a?o -1978- cuando nace, como asociación civil, el Comité Nacional Provida enarbolando 'la defensa de la vida'.<br>  <br>  Ante la imposibilidad de diálogo con las autoridades gubernamentales, las feministas intensificaron entonces sus actividades con protestas públicas, marchas y mítines.<br>  <br>  En protesta y como se?al de luto, en 1979 las feministas marcharon vestidas de ***** por todas las mujeres muertas al practicarse abortos clandestinos. <br>  <br>  El 10 de mayo de dicho a?o se instituyó el Día de la Maternidad Libre y Voluntaria.<br>  <br>  En el segundo semestre del 1980, las diputadas María Luisa Oteysa y Adriana Luna Parra enviaron una carta al presidente José López Portillo, en la que solicitaban que ''el aborto, aun como último recurso, constituye una solución a la que toda mujer tiene derecho, y que requiere de atención médica reconocida y capacitada... La penalización del aborto viola a todas luces el espíritu de nuestra Constitución''.<br>  <br>  Durante la sexta Jornada Nacional sobre la Liberalización del Aborto (o Jornada por el Aborto Libre y Gratuito), realizada en 1981, el Movimiento Nacional de Mujeres exigió a los legisladores respuesta a su propuesta de iniciativa de ley enviada a la Cámara de Diputados para que la interrupción del embarazo fuera libre y gratuita, con la voluntad y decisión de la mujer, y practicable en todas las instituciones de salud pública.<br>  <br>  Como candidato a la presidencia de la República, Miguel de la Madrid Hurtado se refirió a la despenalización del aborto; luego, ya como presidente, en la Reunión Nacional sobre la Mujer efectuada en 1982 en Colima, autorizó al Conapo para promover leyes más severas contra los violadores, así como la creación de un organismo que defendiera los derechos de las mujeres.<br>  <br>  Fue hasta el 3 de febrero de 1983 cuando se reformó el Artículo 4o. constitucional en México, quedando de la siguiente manera: 'El varón y la mujer son iguales ante la ley. Esta protegerá la organización y el desarrollo de la familia. Toda persona tiene derecho a decidir de manera libre, responsable e informada sobre el número y el espaciamiento de sus hijos.<br>  <br>  Un a?o después, en 1988, Comunicación Intercambio y Desarrollo Humano en América Latina (CIDHAL) y la Red Internacional por los Derechos Reproductivos de la Mujeres, lanzan una campa?a de denuncia de los altos índices de mortalidad materna ocasionados, fundamentalmente, por los abortos clandestinos. El 28 de mayo, se instituye el Día Mundial contra la Mortalidad Materna.<br>  <br>  Los grupos feministas discutieron en 1989 un nuevo anteproyecto de Código Penal para el Distrito Federal en materia de fuero común, y para toda la República en materia de fuero federal, sobre la despenalización del aborto, sin que prosperara.<br>  <br>  En Chiapas, el gobernador Patrocinio González Garrido promovió en octubre de 1990 la reforma al Artículo 136 del Código Penal para despenalizar el aborto por razones económicas, de planificación familiar, de común acuerdo con la pareja o en el caso de madres solteras, pero fue ''suspendida'' por las presiones de la Iglesia católica, Provida y el PAN.<br>  <br>  La Coordinadora Feminista del Distrito acuerda el 6 de enero de 1991 la formación de un frente amplio nacional por la maternidad libre y voluntaria, para pugnar por la despenalización del aborto.<br>  <br>  Para 1997, el Grupo de Información en Reproducción Elegida (GIRE) revela que en 21 de las 32 entidades federativas se ha legislado sobre el aborto. En general, las causales por las que no es punible el aborto son: cuando es producto de una violación, por peligro de muerte, razones eugenésicas, grave da?o a la salud de la madre, económicas e inseminación no deseada. Sin embargo, no hay homogeneidad en los códigos penales, que incorporan solamente algunas de ellas.<br>  <br>  Hoy<br>  <br>  Debido a que en México el aborto representa la cuarta causa de muerte de las mujeres en edad reproductiva, a principios de 2007 diputados del PRI, PRD y de la Coalición Socialdemócrata de la Asamblea Legislativa del Distrito Federal (ALDF) presentaron una iniciativa para ampliar las causales que despenalizan el aborto, misma que se está discutiendo en las comisiones de Justicia, Salud y Género, y se espera que para mediados del presente mes se presente al pleno para su aprobación.<br>  <br>  De igual forma, el perredista Pablo Gómez presentó en el Senado de la República una iniciativa de reformas de los artículos 330 y 332 del Código Penal Federal dentro del Título decimonoveno y su capítulo VI -aborto-. En tanto, en la Cámara de Diputados la legisladora Maricela Contreras Julián presentó la iniciativa con proyecto de decreto por el que se reforman y adicionan diversas disposiciones relacionadas con la despenalización del aborto.<br>  <br>  Como podras ver las reglas del juego no son claras todavia, tendremos que esperar que se presente lainiciativa al pleno para saber cual es la propuesta y que es lo que se aprueba de ella<br>  <br>  espero esta inf. sea de tu ayuda|`|Fw50y2iiaa	Yo creo que los abortos si se hacen  legales en mexico, se van a  abrir clinicas pribadas en especialozacion de abortos, aca en USA, hay muchas y eso hace que  sean cada vez mas baratos,NO creo que el imsss  o el isstte , los realicen.

Dried egg can damage exterior finishes and rotten eggs can become downright smelly. The sooner you get to the mess, the better.<br>  Instructions <br>  STEP 1: Hose off the area thoroughly as soon as you spot it. STEP 2: Remove excess egg and shells from house using a towel or rag. STEP 3: Use a solution of one-half white vinegar and one-half warm water if any sign of the stain remains. STEP 4: Soak a towel in the water/vinegar solution. STEP 5: Place the towel against affected area for 15-20 minutes. Prop it in place with a board or ladder if necessary. STEP 6: Remove the towel and rinse the area with a hose. STEP 7: If the stain remains, rent a pressure washer. Look under "Pressure Washing" in the Yellow Pages. STEP 8: Pressure wash the affected area, following instructions carefully. Generally, keep the stream at least a foot from the siding. Overall Tips & Warnings<br>  Since egg is protein, you can also try using an enzyme-containing detergent (most detergents contain enzymes, but check the ingredients to be sure.) Make a paste with cold water and apply to the egged area. Rinse thoroughly. <br>  You can hire a pressure washing company to do the job, but it will cost more than doing it yourself. <br>  Be sure to rent the proper pressure washer for your house's exterior.

But personally, i would say neither and join the MARINES..... thats what im in|`|AA11935624	Hello Lauren!  Choosing the U.S. Military Services is a smart move for a young person fresh out of high school.  I entered the U.S. Air Force when I was 19 years old back in 1961.  I served for 27 years and retired in 1989.  I, too, did check out the Navy thinking I wanted to be in Naval Aviation.  Back then the waiting list was at least 18 months. <br>  <br>  When I joined the Air Force I received my second choice of careers (Heavy Ground Radar Maintenance) and enjoyed it a great deal.  <br>  <br>  Basic Military Training (BMT) at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas is just fine.  The dorms are much better now then when I was there in the old wooden World War II barracks.  Those are all gone now!  <br>  <br>  Actually, the decision to select either the Navy or the Air Force rests with how "you" lean towards the two different missions of those services.  If you would like to be stationed on a ship for up to six months at sea off and on most of a four year enlistment then the Navy is for you.  <br>  <br>  If you are more partial to being stationed on a military base for about three years of your four year enlistment then maybe the Air Force is your best bet.  <br>  <br>  I would have to know more about your viewpoints on the Navy versus the Air Force.  Do you have any other family members or friends who served in the military?  What state are you currently residing in?  Sometimes many people in the landlocked states tend to join the Navy.  Not scientific but I met many Navy people for places like Kansas, the Dakotas, and midwest states (not to say that people from all states don't also join the Navy!).  What career fields in the Navy and Air Force have you been talking about with the recruiters?  <br>  <br>  What decisions have you made regarding going to college?  You know "if" you complete two years of junior college and earn an Associate's Degree the services will promote you, upon graduation from basic training, to pay grade E-3.  Read the recruiting literature on this.  Of course, after four years all the military services will award you 36 months (4 years worth) of college money for you to attend college after your discharge.  Some states, such as my state of Illinois, also have a state G.I. Bill for Education on top of the Montgomery G.I. Bill that military people qualify for.  If you stay in the military you can have almost all of your off-duty college tuition paid for my the military while you take night courses on base.  It's a lot easier to take night classes in the Air Force than on ship in the Navy, however.  <br>  <br>  I earned two Associate's Degrees and my Bachelor of Science Degree while in the Air Force.<br>  <br>  Anyway, there is certainly a much more to consider when deciding upon which miltiary service to join!  <br>  <br>  Don't rely upon the military comedy movies to tell you about the military.  All those goof-ups that we laugh at on the movie screen would not be tolerated on active duty!  Forget about "Private Benjamin" and "Stripes," although they are great funny movies.    <br>  <br>  PS:  We don't care what your high school track record is.  We care about your potential to serve!  <br>  <br>  PPS:  I'm editing my answer to address the subject of people being let go from the military - that is: early outs.  Congress determines how many people each of the military services can have on duty.  Often, it is easier to let people who are in their first term out early if they declare that they don't intend to reenlist.  Sometimes, due to advances in technology which always happens over the years some military fields become overage in personnel. Thus, it's necessary to retrain people into shortage career fields.  Sometimes, people who don't which to remain in the military are released early to trim down the forces.  The individual services can not be blamed for this.  The personnel strength of the military services is determined by Congress.<br>  <br>  Larry from Illinois<br>  SMSgt, USAF, Retired<br>  1961 - 1989|`|E832wFkeaa	US Navy.|`|bvQU9EoGaa	Sounds like you have already talked yourself into the Navy.

Tu madre ya debería estar en los EE UU, el tiempo de espera no es tan largo para la esposa y esposo de ciudadano, en cambio la petición para hijos es mas lenta. Además se te puede pedir que sometas otra solicitud y empezar de cero, se puede corregir pero requieres de un abogado de inmigración, no un notario publico. En tu ciudad (si resides en los EE UU o en la frontera de México) existen organizaciones que dan asesoría migratoria por una contribución económica mínima.

The Government the French installed in the South had no support among it's own people.

Seven times, President Johnson refused to allow execution of Operation Tiger Claw. It would have cut off all lines of communication between Hanoi and the south, at a cost of about 2,000 dead and wounded. Following the seventh veto, every ranking general of Marines and Navy admiral retired within thirty days of each other in mid-1967. After President Ford came to the Oval Office as a totally unelected President, the Congress "rolled" him and cut off all funding to South Vietnam in the Autumn of 1974. On April 25, 1975 the nation of South Vietnam ceased to exist. So much for "exit strategies".|`|bac0c08d67448ca69e882615d8e3b333aa	Very true, as failure is right around the corner in Iraq, don't blame George Bush, blame the American people for not supporting the effort, it's that plain and simple.

Las organizaciones religiosas suelen ser estructuras dogmáticas, autoritarias, machistas y jerárquicas tanto por su ideología, por su estructura interna, como por su actuación. Las sectas y las religiones constituyen una pieza esencial del Sistema, pues adoctrinan a la humanidad y consolidan el principio de autoridad. <br>  <br>  <br>  Las organizaciones religiosas transmiten las ideas de incapacidad humana y la sumisión que esa desvalorización conlleva. La misma idea de dios, de un ser creador del mundo que lo gobierna convenientemente desde un “lugar” trascendente o inmanente, según la necesidad, lleva implícita la justificación de todo lo que existe y la necesidad del dogma y de la autoridad.

Obviously its always going to be illegal, because you are not paying to see the movie, but the question is if it is morally right.  Here's the way I see it--if the movie has been on DVD more than 3 months then it is morally right to watch it on videohybrid.com.<br>  <br>  Why?  Because think about it: where would you get it otherwise? Answer: probably from the video rental store.  Now when you are renting a movie, are you directly giving money to the studios that created it? No.  All your money goes to the rental place, because they have paid for the movie with their own money which did go to the studios.  So if a movie has been out for more that 3 months, obviously the rental store is never going to buy more copies because not as many people are renting them anymore.  Now your money is not going to the studios at all, directly or indirectly, because no longer is the rental place involved with purchasing from the company.  So why would it be any different from watching on videohybrid.com?  The studio does not benefit from either solution, so your only "legal" option is to pay money to a place thats going to keep it all for themselves or watch for free.<br>  <br>  I think I'll take the free movie option thank you.<br>  <br>  Obviously there will be people who disagree with me, but I think there is enough logic in my theory that I can stick by it.|`|AA12021547	I'm not really sure..

Bush had a 90+ percent approval rating shortly after 9/11 and that approval has sunk to below 30 percent in just a few years. This trend would hint at a continuing downward slope. It seems that the more that the operations of the Bush Administration come to light, the less popular Bush becomes. I think people will become increasingly tired of the Iraq war (a war that Bush has no intention of ending) and his popularity will sink even further.|`|aXL79jHgaa	GWB will be remembered as a great leader by those who put him in power. Look what he has achieved. He has managed to single-handedly reinvigorate the military industrial complex which was suffering from peace and a lack of capital investment. He has very effectively redistributed the wealth of several countries, including his own, from the public to companies, and taken all that wasted money away from the environment, farmers, the middle class and the poor and given it to the Texan carpet baggers. What a great leader: who else could have achieved so much and be loved by so few.

As we see people of the same race kill each other too. Did you hear about the man in the S.U.V. who allegedly shot & killed his wife & children. Both appeared to be of the same race.<br>  <br>  Back to this story of lies, double life, and to much drama. Allegedly he cheated on his wife. The victim had a child with him already and they both created another child together even though he was still married to someone else (although I was not there to know the sequence of events). <br>  <br>  Then he allegedly murdered the close to term child and let the toddler witness it and be left unsupervised. So maybe everyone can learn to either keep pants zipped & hold an aspirin between the knees or put the children first. Children are being brought into this world & they did not choose to be left in this world w/o the love of mom & dad.

Fue uno de los líderes de la Revolución Cubana. En la década de los 60 se estableció con un peque?o grupo guerrillero en Bolivia donde fue capturado y ejecutado en forma clandestina por el Ejército Boliviano con la colaboración de la CIA. Tras su muerte se ha convertido en un símbolo de alcance mundial, para sus partidarios simboliza la lucha contra las injusticias sociales o de rebeldía y espíritu incorruptible, mientras que es visto por sus detractores como un asesino en masa y criminal, acusándolo además de una mala gestión como Ministro de Industria. El contorno de su rostro, obtenido a partir de una foto de Alberto Korda, es una de las imágenes más reproducidas del mundo. Nacimiento. Entre Ríos 480 (Rosario). Primer hogar por pocos días del Che Guevara. Habría nacido un mes antes.En casi todas las biografías de Ernesto Guevara se sostiene que nació por azar en la ciudad de Rosario (Santa Fe, Argentina) el 14 de junio de 1928. Sus padres vivían en Buenos Aires pero debido a que poseían una plantación de yerba mate en Caraguatay[3], Misiones, alternaban su estadía entre ambos lugares separados por más de 1.800 km de vía fluvial. Poco antes de nacer Ernesto, los padres decidieron volver a Buenos Aires con el fin de que el parto fuera adecuadamente asistido, utilizando para ello las líneas navieras que surcaban el río Paraná. Sin embargo el parto se adelantó y debieron descender en el puerto de Rosario donde nació Ernesto en el Hospital Centenario[4]. El ni?o fue inscripto al día siguiente con el nombre de Ernesto Guevara. Después de que la madre recibiera el alta, se instalaron por unos días en un apartamento ubicado en la calle Entre Ríos 480 (esquina con Urquiza) hasta que la madre y el ni?o estuvieron en condiciones de viajar a Buenos Aires.<br>  Contrariando la versión general, el biógrafo Jon Lee Anderson sostiene que el acta de nacimiento es falsa y que Ernesto Guevara nació el 14 de mayo de 1928, exactamente un mes antes. La razón habría sido la intención de los padres de ocultar que la madre ya se encontraba embarazada al momento de casarse, hecho del que hay certeza porque ha sido reconocido por el padre. Por ese motivo los Guevara se alejaron de Buenos Aires durante el embarazo y luego intencionalmente se dirigieron a Rosario, donde un médico amigo aceptó fraguar el certificado de nacimiento. Mural de Ricardo Carpani, en Rosario a pocas cuadras de dónde nacióLa versión de Anderson es sumamente creíble y le fue relatada por la también biógrafa de Guevara, Julia Constanla, a quien Celia de la Serna le contó personalmente la verdadera fecha de nacimiento de su hijo y las circunstancias de su embarazo prematrimonial[6]. Explica además el poco razonable traslado de la madre a Misiones estando embarazada y el extra?o descenso en Rosario. De ese modo, Ernesto Guevara fue siempre presentado como "sietemesino", término que históricamente era asimilado a "fruto de una relación prematrimonial, <br>  Los padres. Ernesto Guevara fue el mayor de los cinco hijos de Ernesto Guevara Lynch y Celia de la Serna. Ambos pertenecían a conocidas familias aristocráticas de clase alta. Su tatarabuelo paterno fue considerado el hombre más rico de Sudamérica, mientras que por el lado materno descendía de José de la Serna e Hinojosa, último virrey espa?ol en Lima [8]. Personalmente conformaron un hogar de menos poder económico, de clase media alta.<br>  Ernesto Guevara Lynch (1901-1987), el padre, tenía una vida desahogada gracias a las rentas que obtenía de la herencia recibida de sus padres[9]. Al nacer su hijo, acababa de comprar una importante plantación de yerba mate en Caraguatay, una zona rural de la provincia de Misiones, en el área de Montecarlo, 200 km. al norte de la capital Posadas, sobre el río Paraná. En aquellos tiempos los trabajadores de los yerbatales, conocidos como mensúes, estaban sometidos a un régimen prácticamente esclavo. La novela "El río oscuro", de Alfredo Varela, sobre la que se realizó la película Las aguas bajan turbias, está ambientada en el trabajo de los yerbatales de aquellos a?os.<br>  El padre del Che vivía en Buenos Aires pero se encargaba personalmente del yerbatal, que tenía el nombre de La Misionera y había sido comprado con parte de la herencia de su esposa[10]. También obtenía ingresos del Astillero Río de la Plata, propiedad de varios miembros de su familia; ubicado en San Fernando, se incendió en 1930. Nunca llegó a prosperar lo suficiente y terminó vendiendo el yerbatal en la década de 1940, para instalar una inmobiliaria y comprar una casa en Buenos Aires. En Córdoba instaló con un socio una empresa de construcción civil que quebró en 1947. En 1948 recibió otra importante herencia debido a la muerte de su madre, Ana Isabel Lynch Ortiz. Algunas biografías lo indican incorrectamente como ingeniero y de ideas socialistas. Se volvió a casar y tuvo tres hijos. En 1987 escribió un libro con el título "Mi hijo el Che". Celia de la Serna (n. 1906 ;18 de mayo de 1965), la madre, pertenecía a una tradicional familia aristocrática[11] de grandes estancieros bonaerenses. Su padre se suicidó cuando tenía dos a?os y su madre murió cuando tenía quince[12]. Quedó entonces al cuidado de su hermana Carmen y una tía. Perteneció a una generación de mujeres argentinas de clase alta progresistas que promovieron el feminismo, la libertad sexual y la autonomía de las mujeres, cuya más fiel representante fue Victoria Ocampo. Los padres de Ernesto se casaron el 10 de diciembre de 1927, cuando Celia se encontraba embarazada de tres meses. El hecho resultaba condenable para la moral de aquellos a?os, pero también indica una actitud poco conservadora por parte de sus padres y sobre todo por parte de su madre[13], quien pocos a?os antes había estado a punto de convertirse en monja[14]. En 1948 se separaron, aunque siguieron viviendo bajo el mismo techo; otra conducta inhabitual en la clase alta argentina, que conllevaba la marginación. En total tuvieron cinco hijos: <br>  Ernesto (1928-1967) <br>  Celia (n. 1929) <br>  Roberto (n. 1932) <br>  Ana María (n. 1934 - m. 1988) <br>  Juan Martín (n. 1943) Una característica de los padres de Ernesto que influyó considerablemente en su ni?ez y juventud, fueron su constantes mudanzas y traslados. Hasta dejar la Argentina definitivamente en 1953, la familia de Ernesto tuvo al menos 12 domicilios, en Buenos Aires, Caraguatay, San Isidro, Alta Gracia y Córdoba capital. Primeros a?os: entre Caraguatay y Buenos Aires. Ernesto Guevara empezando a caminar (1929).Los primeros a?os de Ernesto transcurrieron entre las casas que sus padres tenían en Buenos Aires y Caraguatay, yendo y viniendo en los vapores del río Paraná, según las necesidades de la producción yerbatera y el clima. Desde un primer momento Ernesto recibió de sus padres el sobrenombre de "Ernestito", para diferenciarlo del padre, y luego de "Teté", con los que le llamarían indistintamente su familia y amigos de la infancia. En Buenos Aires se instalaron en las zonas típicas de la clase alta: primero en el barrio de Palermo (Santa Fe y Guise), luego en el partido de San Isidro (calle Alem) y finalmente en el barrio de la Recoleta (Pe?a y Bustamante). Viviendo en San Isidro, a los dos a?os de edad tuvo el primer ataque de asma, enfermedad que padecería toda su vida y que llevaría a la familia a trasladarse a Córdoba. El padre siempre culpabilizaría a la madre por el asma de Ernesto, atribuyéndolo a una bronquitis agravada por la falta de atención de esta última una fría ma?ana mientras nadaba en el aristocrático Club Náutico San IsidrO. En Caraguatay (Misiones), los padres de Ernesto contrataron a una ni?era para su hijo: Carmen Arias, una gallega que viviría con la familia hasta 1937 y que fue quien le puso el sobrenombre de "Teté". Del yerbatal de sus padres y de su estancia en Misiones adquiriría el gusto por el mate, del que fue un apasionado toda su vida[25]. Debido a la seriedad y persistencia del asma que afectaba a Ernestito, la familia procuró buscar un lugar con un clima más apto. Siguiendo las recomendaciones de los médicos, decidieron mudarse a la provincia de Córdoba, un destino clásico de aquella época para las personas con afecciones respiratorias debido a sus condiciones climáticas y mayor altitud. Luego de pasar un tiempo en la misma ciudad de Córdoba, capital de la provincia, los Guevara Lynch se instalaron en Alta Gracia. Alta Gracia, Córdoba. Infancia y adolescencia, Provincia de Córdoba, en el centro de Argentina. Alta Gracia está 39 km al suroeste de la capitalErnesto Guevara vivió 17 a?os en Córdoba, desde 1930 hasta principios de 1947, abarcando gran parte de su infancia y toda la adolescencia. él mismo se consideraba cordobés[26] y hablaba con el característico "cantito" de los cordobeses[27], aunque luego en Cuba adoptaría un acento marcadamente cubano. En Alta Gracia cursó la escuela primaria y en la ciudad de Córdoba la secundaria. También allí tuvo sus primeras experiencias sexuales y formó su grupo de amigos, con los que más adelante compartiría sus primeras preocupaciones sociales y sus viajes por América Latina. Poco antes de volver a Buenos Aires, vivió también unos meses en Villa María. La familia tuvo varios domicilios en Alta Gracia, pero el principal de ellos fue Villa Nydia, en la zona de Villa Carlos Pellegrini, donde actualmente funciona el Museo Ernesto Che Guevara. Ernesto cursó sus estudios primarios en las escuelas públicas San Martín y Santiago de Liniers entre 1937 y 1941. Sus estudios secundarios los realizó entre 1942 y 1946 en el Colegio Nacional Dean Funes, ubicado en la ciudad de Córdoba, donde la familia terminó mudándose en 1943. El asma determinó en gran medida las características de la infancia de Ernesto Guevara. Los ataques eran constantes y de una severidad tal que lo llevaban incluso a quedar postrado días enteros. Limitó sus posibilidades de ir a la escuela, a la que recién ingresó en 1937 cuando tenía ocho a?os comenzando en segundo grado (salteando primero inferior y superior). Restringió sus posibilidades de hacer deporte, actividad que le apasionaba y que igualmente practicó aunque muchas veces sus amigos debían cargarlo para volver a su casa. Para combatir el asma estaba sujeto a constantes dietas y tratamientos médicos. Por otro lado su enfermedad lo hizo un extraordinario lector, un gran aficionado al ajedrez y generó en él un fuerte espíritu de disciplina y autocontrol. lta Gracia era una peque?a villa veraniega de la clase alta cordobesa ubicada en las primeras sierras a 39 km al suroeste de la ciudad de Córdoba, capital de la provincia del mismo nombre. Las sierras de Córdoba, por su clima seco y su altura, han sido tradicionalmente uno de los principales destinos turísticos del país, y el lugar por excelencia que buscaban las personas con afecciones respiratorias. Ernesto Guevara en el tradicional "burrito cordobés". Alta Gracia, (1933, 5 a?os)En su primera adolescencia Ernesto tuvo preferencia por libros de aventuras, como las luchas de Sandokán, de Emilio Salgari y, sobre todo, los viajes extraordinarios de Julio Verne, entre ellos Cinco semanas en globo, Viaje al centro de la Tierra, De la Tierra a la Luna, Veinte mil leguas de viaje submarino. A?os después, estando ya en Cuba pediría que le enviaran sus tres tomos encuadernados en cuero de las obras completas de Verne. Más adelante desarrolló el gusto por la poesía y la filosofía. Entre sus poetas preferidos se destacó Baudelaire, en especial su descarnada y polémica obra Las flores del mal, y luego Pablo Neruda, en particular sus poemas de amor. Fue un apasionado de la filosofía existencialista, lo que lo llevó a preferir las obras de Sartre, Kafka y Camus, y de las teorías psicológicas de Freud [29].Ernesto Guevara en Alta Gracia (1937, 9 a?os)Ernesto Guevara se destacó durante toda su infancia y adolescencia por su rebeldía. Sumamente travieso, con duras discusiones con sus padres y maestros, desali?ado al punto de ser llamado el Chancho Guevara (sobrenombre que adoptó gustosamente), ejecutando pruebas de gran riesgo personal, de muy mal carácter, muchas veces llegando a los golpes en las discusiones, realizando comentarios provocativos y escandalosos, buscando habitualmente defender la posición contraria de sus interlocutores.En aquellos a?os, Córdoba y Alta Gracia en particular recibieron una notable cantidad de refugiados republicanos de la Guerra Civil Espa?ola, y también alemanes vinculados a los nazis. El músico Manuel de Falla se había instalado en Alta Gracia y algunos de los mejores amigos de Ernesto, los hermanos González Aguilar, eran hijos de un alto jefe militar espa?ol republicano, también refugiado allí. Por otra parte algunas localidades cordobesas como La Cumbre, La Cumbrecita y Villa General Belgrano eran centros de refugiados alemanes con evidentes simpatías nazis. El padre de Ernesto llegó a organizar durante la Segunda Guerra Mundial un peque?o grupo para espiar las actividades nazis en Córdoba, en el que también participó Ernestito[30].En 1942 Ernesto Guevara inició sus estudios secundarios en la ciudad de Córdoba en el Colegio Dean Funes, ubicado en la esquina de Perú e Independencia, del barrio Pueyrredón. La ciudad de Córdoba, que por entonces contaba con unos 350.000 habitantes, comenzaba a sufrir transformaciones decisivas debido un notable proceso de industrialización por el que fue llamada la "Detroit Argentina"[31].Ernesto Guevara de vacaciones en Mar del Plata (ca. 1943, 15 a?os)Cursó sus estudios secundarios (1942-1946) en un momento de grandes cambios y transformaciones políticas en la Argentina. Entre 1943 y 1946 habría de surgir el peronismo que contó con un apoyo masivo de la clase obrera e inversamente un rechazo masivo de las clases media y alta. Los estudiantes fueron uno de los grupos que más activamente se movilizaron contra el peronismo naciente, bajo el lema de "no a la dictadura de las alpargatas"[32].<br>  Una vez en la escuela secundaria e instalado en Córdoba, la vida de Ernesto se hizo más pública. Contra lo que suelen decir algunas biografías, Ernesto Guevara no tuvo ninguna militancia política ni social en Córdoba (ni luego en Buenos Aires). él mismo lo dijo:No tuve preocupaciones sociales en mi adolescencia, ni participé en las luchas políticas o estudiantiles de Argentina.[33]Los padres de Ernesto y toda su familia, por supuesto, eran abiertamente antiperonistas, como lo era la gran mayoría de la clase media y la clase alta. Ernesto en cambio, nunca parece haber sostenido posiciones antiperonistas. Por el contrario, se sabe que la familia le atribuía sentimientos favorables al peronismo[34], que les recomendaba a las empleadas domésticas de su casa y de las casas de sus amigos que votaran al peronismo[35], y que sentía respeto por Perón a quien llamaba "el capo"[36]. A?os después, ya en plena Revolución Cubana, utilizó una de las palabras favoritas de Eva erón, "descamisados", para bautizar al grupo de novatos bajo su mando en la guerrilla[37], y poco antes, al enterarse del golpe militar que derrocó a Perón escribió en una carta a su madre:Ernesto Guevara, ca. 1945, 17 a?osTe confieso con toda sinceridad que la caída de Perón me amargó profundamente, no por él, por lo que significaba para toda América, pues mal que te pese y a pesar de la claudicación forzosa de los últimos tiempos, Argentina era el paladín de todos los que pensamos que el enemigo está en el norte.[38]<br>  Con respecto al Partido Comunista Argentino, Ernesto rechazó explícita y abiertamente su posición, en tanto "criticaba con dureza su sectarismo"[39].<br>  Si alguna ideología clara comenzaba a asomar en Ernesto Guevara, en los últimos a?os de su adolescencia, fue su posición antiimperialista y en particular su posición acérrimamente contraria al imperialismo norteamericano[40], una ideología con profundas raíces en la cultura política-social argentina. En este sentido, escandalizó a sus familiares y conocidos, cuando se opuso a que la Argentina le declarara la guerra a la Alemania nazi en 1945, sosteniendo que se realizaba por presión de EE.UU. y que debía mantenerse neutral[41].Simultáneamente en 1945, con 17 a?os, Ernesto demostró un gran interés por la filosofía y comenzó a escribir su propio diccionario filosófico, mientras descubría la literatura social latinoamericana, con exponentes como Jorge Icaza y Miguel Angel Asturias.Un hecho importante se produjo cuando en noviembre de 1943 su mejor amigo, Alberto Granado y otros estudiantes, fueron detenidos por la policía durante una manifestación estudiantil contra el gobierno. Ernesto y Tomás Granado iban a la cárcel a visitar a Alberto a diario. Contra todo lo esperado, cuando se organizó una gran marcha para reclamar la libertad de Alberto y los demás presos políticos, Ernesto no solo se negó a participar, sino que sostuvo que "la marcha era un gesto inútil y que solo conseguirían ?que los caguen a palos?, y que él solo iría si le daban un revólver"[42]. A fines de 1946 Ernesto terminó sus estudios secundarios. Ese mismo a?o obtuvo su primer empleo, junto a Alberto Granado, en el laboratorio de la Dirección de Vialidad de la Provincia de Córdoba. Poco después de recibirse fue enviado a la localidad de Villa María, 100 km al sur, a participar durante los siguientes meses en la construcción de un camino. En 1947 la familia Guevara Lynch-de la Serna sufrió un colapso. La empresa constructora de su padre quebró, y los Guevara decidieron separarse y mudarse a Buenos Aires. En mayo de ese a?o su abuela enfermó de muerte, lo que llevó a Ernesto a renunciar a su empleo y trasladarse a la capital argentina, donde permanecería luego del deceso de la anciana.<br>  Poco antes de partir, en Villa María, escribió el poema que se transcribe en el recuadro:Carlos "Calica" Ferrer[45]. Uno de sus primeros amigos. Comandante de la llamada Cuarta Columna. El Che Guevara en Sierra Maestra con su perro "Hombrito"La Segunda Columna (llamada luego ?Cuarta? para confundir al enemigo) estuvo integrada originalmente por cuatro pelotones a cargo de Juan Almeida, Ramiro Valdés, Ciro Redondo y Lalo Sardi?as. Posteriormente se integraría Camilo Cienfuegos, con quien establecería una estrecha amistad, reemplazando a Lalo Sardi?as como su segundo al mando. Guevara se distinguiría por integrar sus tropas con guajiros y ******, que constituían entonces el sector más marginado del país, en un tiempo que el racismo y la segregación racial aún era una fuerza poderosa, incluso entre los propios miembros del Movimiento 26 de Julio[73]. A los novatos que integraban la columna los bautizó "descamisados", la célebre palabra que Eva Perón utilizaba para dirigirse a los trabajadores argentinos, también despreciados con el término "cabecitas negras".  en 1963 del primer intento guerrillero del Che Guevara fuera de Cuba. El Che entraría en conflicto con los dirigentes del Movimiento 26 de Julio que actuaban en el llano. Estos lo consideraban un marxista extremista con demasiada influencia sobre Fidel Castro, y aquel los consideraba "derechistas" con una concepción tímida de la lucha y dispuestos a complacer a Estados Unidos.<br>  La ofensiva de Batista y la creación de la Columna No 8<br>  El Che y Camilo en el Museo de la Revolución de La HabanaEl 27 de febrero de 1958 Fidel Castro decidió ampliar las operaciones de la guerrilla creando tres nuevas columnas al mando de Juan Almeida, Raúl Castro y Camilo Cienfuegos, a quienes designó comandantes. Almeida debía actuar en la zona oriental de Sierra Maestra, Raúl Castro debía abrir un Segundo Frente e instalarse en la Sierra Cristal, al norte de Santiago. En abril Camilo Cienfuegos fue designado jefe militar de la zona comprendida entre la ciudades de Bayamo, Manzanillo y Las Tunas, mientras que Castro establecía su cuartel general en La Plata. El 7 de noviembre de 1966, día en que comienza su Diario de Bolivia, Ernesto Guevara se instaló en una zona monta?osa y selvática ubicada cerca del río ?ancahuazú, en el sudeste del país, donde las últimas estribaciones de la Cordillera de los Andes se unen con la región del Gran Chaco. El grupo guerrillero estable estaba integrado por 16 cubanos[123], entre ellos muchos de los hombres de su círculo íntimo, 26 bolivianos[124], 3 peruanos[125] y 2 argentinos[126]. En total 47 combatientes de los cuales Tania era la única mujer, aunque en el grupo de apoyo desempe?ó también un importante papel Loyola Guzmán quien resultó detenida y torturada. Tomaron el nombre de Ejército de Liberación Nacional de Bolivia (ELN) con secciones de apoyo en Argentina, Chile y Perú.<br>  El 11 de marzo de 1967 dos desertores fueron detenidos poniendo sobre aviso al gobierno, que, ese mismo día, solicitó la cooperación de Estados Unidos y organizó un sistema de inteligencia coordinado con Argentina, Brasil, Chile, Perú y Paraguay. El 23 de marzo comenzaron los enfrentamientos armados: el ELN copó una unidad militar y mató a siete soldados. Poco después dejaron el campamento para escapar del cerco que comenzó a formar el ejército boliviano. El 3 de abril Guevara dividió sus fuerzas, poniendo a Juan Acu?a Nu?ez (?Vilo?) al mando de la segunda columna. Ambos grupos se perdieron y no volverían a encontrarse. Su muerte última imagen del Che Guevara con vida, instantes antes de ser asesinado. A su lado el agente de la CIA Félix Rodríguez. La Higuera (Bolivia), 9 de octubre de 1967.En el combate de Quebrada del Yuro, Guevara fue herido de bala en su pierna izquierda, hecho prisionero junto con Simeón Cuba (?Willy?) y trasladado a La Higuera donde fueron recluidos en la escuela, en aulas separadas. Allí colocarían también los cadáveres de los guerrilleros muertos y también sería recluido al día siguiente, Juan Pablo Chang. Entre las pertenencias secuestradas por los militares estaba el Diario que el Che llevaba en Bolivia. El 9 de octubre por la ma?ana el gobierno de Bolivia anunció que Ernesto Guevara había muerto en combate el día anterior. Simultáneamente llegaron el coronel Joaquín Zenteno Anaya y el agente de la CIA Félix Rodríguez. Poco después del mediodía el presidente Barrientos dio la orden de asesinar al Che Guevara. Existen dudas y versiones contradictorias sobre el grado de apoyo que la decisión tuvo por parte de Estados Unidos[132], pero lo cierto es que, tal como está registrado en el propio informe secreto de Félix Rodríguez, la CIA estaba presente en el lugar. Fue el agente Rodríguez quien recibió la orden de fusilar a Guevara y quien la transmitió a los oficiales bolivianos, así como fue él también quien le comunicó al Che Guevara que sería fusilado[133]. Antes del fusilamiento Félix Rodríguez le interrogó y le sacó del aula para tomarle varias fotografías, las últimas en las que aparece con vida. El propio Rodríguez relata ese momento de este modo: Escuela de La Higuera, donde estuvo prisionero y fue asesinado el Che GuevaraSalí de la habitación, aquello estaba lleno de soldados afuera. Me dirigí al Sargento Terán que sabía que estaba siendo de ejecutor de todo eso. Le dije, sargento hay instrucciones de su gobierno de eliminar al prisionero. Me puse la mano al nivel de la barbilla. No le tire de aquí para arriba, tírele de aquí para abajo pues se supone que este hombre haya muerto de heridas en combate. Sí mi capitán, sí mi capitán dijo. Eran aproximadamente la una de la tarde de Bolivia. De ahí entonces me retire al lugar avanzado donde yo había fotografiado el diario y a la una y diez aproximadamente escuche una ráfaga peque?a.[134]. Poco antes Simeón Cuba y Juan Pablo Chang habían corrido la misma suerte. En 1977 la revista Paris Match entrevistó a Mario Terán quien relató del siguiente modo los últimos instantes del Che Guevara:Dudé 40 minutos antes de ejecutar la orden. Me fui a ver al coronel Pérez con la esperanza de que la hubiera anulado. Pero el coronel se puso furioso. Así es que fui. ése fue el peor momento de mi vida. Cuando llegué, el Che estaba sentado en un banco. Al verme dijo: ?Usted ha venido a matarme?. Yo me sentí cohibido y bajé la cabeza sin responder. ". Matrimonios e hijos.,  Aleida March, Camilo(h), Hilda (h), Che con Celia (h) en brazos y Aleida (h), 1963Ernesto Guevara se casó dos veces y tuvo seis hijos. Su primer matrimonio fue con Hilda Gadea[140] el 18 de agosto de 1955, en México. Hilda Gadea era una economista y dirigente peruana del APRA a quien Guevara conoció en Guatemala. Juntos tuvieron una hija: Hilda Beatriz Guevara Gadea (1956-1995), nacida el 15 de febrero de 1956. Ernesto Guevara se divorció de Hilda Gadea en 1959. Luego de la Revolución Cubana Hilda se radicó en Cuba donde desempe?ó altos cargos. Escribió un libro sobre su ex esposo con el título de Che Guevara: los a?os decisivos (México: Aguilar Editor, 1972). Había nacido en 1925 y falleció en La Habana en 1974. Su segundo matrimonio fue con Aleida March Torres (n. 1936) el 9 de junio de 1959, en La Habana. Aleida March era una militante cubana del Movimiento 26 de Julio de la provincia de Las Villas a quien Guevara conoció en 1958 cuando desarrollaba su ofensiva final sobre el régimen de Batista poco antes de la batalla de Santa Clara. Juntos tuvieron cuatro hijos: Aleida Guevara March, nacida el 17 de noviembre de 1960 Camilo Guevara March, nacido el 20 de mayo de 1962 , Celia Guevara March, nacida el 14 de junio de 1963 .Ernesto Guevara March, nacido el 24 de febrero de 1965 .También se?alan que Guevara fundó el sistema cubano de campos de trabajo, cuando estableció un campo de trabajo en Guanahacabibes para reeducar a los directores de empresas estatales considerados culpables de violaciones a la ?ética revolucionaria?[144]. Los opositores a la figura del Che Guevara también remarcan sus ideas comunistas, a las que consideran totalitarias, y la influencia que tuvo para que Cuba se adhiriera al comunismo y, durante la Guerra Fría, ingresara al bloque comunista conducido por la Unión Soviética. Sus detractores sostienen que sus adherentes han realizado una gran propaganda para presentarlo como un guerrero formidable, pero que en realidad fue un pobre estratega. Fundamentalmente sostienen que, atendiendo a los resultados, Guevara fracasó en la dirección de la economía cubana, ya que ?supervisó el cuasicolapso de la producción de azúcar, el fracaso de la industrialización y la introducción del racionamiento —todo esto en la que había sido una de las cuatro naciones latinoamericanas más exitosas desde antes de la dictadura de Batista La figura de Ernesto Guevara también ha sido críticada desde sectores radicales, principalmente anarquistas y libertarios civiles, considerándolo una persona autoritaria, cuya meta era la creación de un régimen de estado estalinista y burocrático.El Che Guevara en la cultura<br>  La figura de Ernesto Guevara ha sido motivo de una gran cantidad de obras artísticas, tanto en Cuba como en el resto del mundo. Sin duda alguna la más conocida es la canción Hasta siempre comandante, compuesta por Carlos Puebla, que se ha vuelto un clásico de la canción latinoamericana y en la que figuran los famosos versos del estribillo:|`|r9QChMEUaa	Ay estaba guapisimo, lastima.

I have talked to a lot of them and they said that it was easy to get hired cause they people are needed.

a0ea30926acdfeb82a6d6f9ca13bcc69aa	In about 20 years ALL of the baby boomers will be eligible for SS.  We know that we can't afford it as it is.  Either way, taxes will be raised  significantly.  Benefits will be reduced.  It should be obvious where this is heading.    If we get universal health care, it will be the same way in time.    There are plenty of people who are trying to get the option of privatizing Social Security passed.  This would give citizens a choice whether they want to give a portion of their income to the government to invest for retirement (Social Security) or to invest those dollars themselves.  So far, Republicans have been shot down every time on this issue.    Either way, we are still going to have to keep paying for the people who were promised SS and didn't save for their retirement.    Another option that some Democrats have suggested is to either seize a percentage or all of people's private retirement savings.  At one time, Hillary wanted a "one-time tax" on private retirement funds.    I wish that the government would simply get out of the retirement business.  Let each citizen be responsible for themselves.|`|58EydBwwaa	Have you noticed that the government doesn't give a tiny rat's *** about any of that? If anything we will begin paying significantly more, very very soon in order to finance the geriatric baby boomers.|`|fqCB7I8Gaa	They wont go bust as long as there are tax payers,  bronco.|`|mBt5VgtHaa	Your facts are wrong. If there is nothing done, the SS trust fund will be depleted in 2041. When that occurs, SS will still out SS at a reduced benefit. SS is not an investment; it is social insurance.

An awful lot of aging Labour party supporters (what we call grass roots old labour) who are carrying around a very socialist torch dedicated to the redistribution of wealth and are convinced we're all being betrayed by current governments.

I think that he really embarrassed Obama.  As it was being explained on the news this afternoon, the vetting process is to bring all this information to the surface before the person is nominated - that clearly did not happen, or they thought it would go away and not be a big thing.  Everyone is saying it was clearly Daschle who made the decision, but I would think that Obama had a say in it also.|`|EhoJ9mgsaa	Obama "absolutely" stood by his nomination of Daschle.

We don't know if Obama privately asked him to do so or if he himself realized his confirmation would be a problem.  Non-payment of taxes is a big issue.  It jeopardizes the public trust in those in top administrative positons.|`|33ppbrMJaa	I think Daschle had other reasons to withdraw. The tax problems have been corrected, paid for, and would have been excused by Congress had he continued.  But, adding to the problems is the fact that Tom Daschle's wife is a lobbyist.  Overall, he probably decided it was not worth what he would have put his family through.    Which is a shame, because Tom Daschle has been a decent, uncorrupted politician throughout his career. He is an expert on the subject of Health Care.   If his friend had not given him a gift of a limo and driver, he might even still be driving his old Pontiac. Because of the partisanship going on in Congress right now, with the Sore Losers throwing every obstacle they can think about in Obama's path, it is best that Dashchle resigned.    Now, we can watch the Republicans, who are suddenly posing as economic experts.  Too bad they didn't get more frugal about six years ago, before we were bogged down in debt.|`|1df791d612f017199aac2300a5a74908aa	No se quien es Tom Daschle, voy a investigar, par mi punto dae vsita estas es una pregunta para los que viven en EUA|`|b2efe4c24f079486fbaff579f92c1c00aa	He did appoint him and stood by him.  Obviously the vetting process is a bit different for the Dem's.  I heard the word vetted thousands of time when it came to Sarah Palin.  Obama needs to do a little better  when he picks his people.  It is a big issue with his tax deal.  You know he has an accountant do his taxes and they usually ask a lot of questions because they can be fined if they do not.  He knew what he was doing.

otYOxmnuaa	Amendments are created to protect civil liberties - an extension of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.    Current Issues:  1.  Gay-marriage:  The argument is not about marriage (at least for rational gays) -- it's about getting the same civil liberties afforded heteros when they get married/form a civil union.    So the issue is taken out of context and has turned into a religious "rights" issue rather than a state one.    So -- your amendment could afford homosexuals the same rights/protections/benefits as a hetero marriage affords in terms of State laws (not religious institutions).    -  One benefit in which they differ:  When a heterosexual marries a foreign national, that foreign national can become an American citizen.    When you're homosexual and you go to the courthouse for a civil union with a gay foreign national, you're not afforded American residency privileges w/o going through normal immigration channels (A long a tedious process).      An amendment would change that law -- affording gay people the practice of "marrying" foreign nationals and have that foreigner obtain American citizenship in the same process as heteros would pursue.|`|JXMVNEQoaa	that would be terrible, it would make our economy worse, make an amendment banning gay marriage or for all politicians to support our constitution and pass no laws infringing it|`|VKee6ARRaa	well it's not a gas amendment, but i would say make one up about a balanced budget, this would be really easy to do because there is an idea about it, and several states already have balanced budget amendments, so it'd be really easy to look it up and find details and info about  hope i helped you out|`|465585eaeb565271820ea6eaa2a5e0e3aa	Try one requiring a yearly IRS audit of all federal officials, elected and appointed, with a gross yearly income exceeding $150,000.00 a year|`|hnNyUuDQaa	an amendment to repeal the 21st amendment.

Too much government oversight-way too many government employees, too many fat cat benefits for those employees.

While home buyers were all to quick to get a piece of the American dream whether they could afford it or not. Loans started defaulting financial institutions were not able to sell off there bad securities and the market froze up.

If he pays thru the state, meaning if he pays it to the state and they send it to her, contact the district attorney for child support in your area. By law, once a year, he can request a review of his case. He can request it, not just the mom. A court date will be set and the judge will then review to see if he's paying too much. 2. If he pays it directly to her, meaning he personally writes a check to her or pays her cash, then he has to hire a lawyer and get the lawyer to get a court date for review set. In which case, he'll have to pay for said lawyer out of his own pocket. And if he's barely making ends meet, he'll probably find it real hard to do. If so, check if there's a legal aid office around....they might offer some help.

I do benefit from some socialistic concepts applied in our society. These being ideas like police departments, public schools, public roads and the like. However, while these can be considered benefits, I still pay for the use of these socialist concepts in the form of taxes. I have no problem supporting certain levels of socialism as they are necessary, but I draw the line at subsidizing the lifestyle of others who refuse to provide for themselves over the long term (unending welfare, national health, etc.).

(do i sound naive?)  but for most of them, i am cynical enough to believe that the means they employ are not always ethical or even honest.  wheeling and dealing can mean many things.  and a lot of those things are not even legal.    if there is change coming in america, and i sense there is, i think what everyday americans want is change at the top.  we are tired of working to pay our bills, and get what we can for our children, while corporate ceo's and elected officials reap huge salaries/benefit packages, pay lip service to civic duty and honor, and seemingly have little interest in what job they ought to be performing.    a lot of everyday citizens are getting very angry.  we are not sure who to blame:  bush, obama, greedy investment bankers, our congress...    when i heard the term "golden parachute" for the first time, that is when i got very angry.  yes, indeed, i want change!  not sure if it's obama's flavor of change or what...    it is as if these 'leaders', whom would should be able to look up to and respect, are playing some kind of reckless, amoral, huge-stakes Game, at the expense of taxpayers and investors.  and when things aren't going so well for them in the game, or they see that they will lose, they employ the golden parachutes...that they have robbed and swindled from us.      sadly, that is where i think most politicians make their fortunes by robbing and swindling.  to answer your question.|`|xagiOb80aa	Corruption and/or followed up by cashing in on their networking efforts|`|0YVDXvBOaa	Book deals, giving speeches, tax loopholes, big industry, you scratch my back I'll scratch yours, etc. Nothing new, the same way it is and has been across the entire planet.|`|NW1PfiVIaa	A lot of them go on speaking tours or write books.

AA11130603	The voters in this country believe that they only have two choices. Democrat or Republican. They apparently don't realize that there are some real good candidates on 3rd party tickets like Chuck Baldwin. If everyone did their homework and checked out these other candidates and voted for them , the Electoral College would have to go with the tide but that will never happen but I am still going to use my freedom to vote for who I feel has our country's best interest at heart rather than continue to throw our country to the wolves.

C4EGYiazaa	Mrs. McCain.<br>  <br>  The stories told to me by the Days involve more than wartime valor.<br>  <br>  For example, in 1991 Cindy McCain was visiting Mother Teresa's orphanage in Bangladesh when a dying infant was thrust into her hands. The orphanage could not provide the medical care needed to save her life, so Mrs. McCain brought the child home to America with her. She was met at the airport by her husband, who asked what all this was about.<br>  <br>  Mrs. McCain replied that the child desperately needed surgery and years of rehabilitation. "I hope she can stay with us," she told her husband. Mr. McCain agreed. Today that child is their teenage daughter Bridget.<br>  <br>  I was aware of this story. What I did not know, and what I learned from Doris, is that there was a second infant Mrs. McCain brought back. She ended up being adopted by a young McCain aide and his wife.<br>  <br>  "We were called at midnight by Cindy," Wes Gullett remembers, and "five days later we met our new daughter Nicki at the L.A. airport wearing the only clothing Cindy could find on the trip back, a 7-Up T-shirt she bought in the Bangkok airport." Today, Nicki is a high school sophomore. Mr. Gullett told me, "I never saw a hospital bill" for her care.<br>  <br>  A few, but not many, of the stories told to me by the Days have been written about, such as in Robert Timberg's 1996 book "A Nightingale's Song." But Mr. McCain rarely refers to them on the campaign trail. There is something admirable in his reticence, but he needs to overcome it.<br>  <br>  Private people like Mr. McCain are rare in politics for a reason. Candidates who are uncomfortable sharing their interior lives limit their appeal. But if Mr. McCain is to win the election this fall, he has to open up.<br>  <br>  Americans need to know about his vision for the nation's future, especially his policy positions and domestic reforms. They also need to learn about the moments in his life that shaped him. Mr. McCain cannot make this a biography-only campaign – but he can't afford to make it a biography-free campaign either. Unless he opens up more, many voters will never know the experiences of his life that show his character, integrity and essential decency.<br>  <br>  These qualities mattered in America's first president and will matter as Americans decide on their 44th president.<br>  <br>  Mr. Rove is the former senior adviser and deputy chief of staff to President George W. Bush.<br>  <br>  |`|YqaKgYQ9aa	McCain has a history of charity work and donating millions of dollars.

And you would think that we would have learned from pass mistakes with racism. White America better learn. What do you think is going to happen when they try to kill Obama.

It happened to be really easy due to the fact that they're a bunch of racist pigs and he has an Arabic middle name. Otherwise they'd have had to come up with another way to smear him, like maybe make fun of his weight/complexion/physical features/something equally as reflective on his political prowess.

This kind of tactic's been used before by both sides of the political spectrum to make the president or other politicians look worse.  Ann Coulter, for example, made a book recently on Obama and his wife, and whenever she brought him up she called him "B. Hussein Obama."  When asked why she did that, her response was "who cares? it's just a middle name, why does it matter?"  Well the question can be turned around.  If it doesn't matter, why are you bringing it up?

If it were not a smear they would not leave off his first name. Few people I know are called by their middle name. That is why we have first ones!    They want to equate him with being Muslim, which is not true. And even if he were, that is no worse than being Catholic!

QqxrVVnlaa	Reunification happened around 19 years ago. However, after WWII both West Germany and Japan, as defeated nations were not allowed to have large standing armies, navy's or air forces. Because they couldn't spend on arms they invested in industry; cars, electronics, communications, etc. While USSR, USA, GB, etc. spent billions on weapons for the cold war and proxy wars in Africa and Asia, the defeated nations could spend a higher percentage of their GDP on industry and commerce. That is why they became wealthy at a faster rate.|`|0704acd350dc509b1acb6896ab97e3d6aa	they are very organised and hard-working <br>  plus they make very good cars|`|HvXW7EEwaa	you are thinking of east Germany. west Germany was not Communist and was Always a power full economy. when the two halves were reunited there was a terrible slump in west Germany's economy. it virtually had to carry the weight of the two! even though it was not really geared up to. but the germans are a strong people. you should never under estimate their resolve.|`|t27SvIPbaa	Germany and Hitler was funded by George Bushes Father Prescott Bush, he was the director of a private bank that funded Germany before, during and after the war.  These bankers start all wars and then fund both sides of the war.<br>  When asking Western school children about the significance of Waterloo, the answer will be something along the lines of ‘the decisive battle between Napoleon and an English lead European coalition’. In fact, the future of the European continent was perceived to depend upon the battle of Waterloo. If Napoleon won, France would have been confirmed as the undisputed master of Europe. If Napoleon was beaten, England would have become the leading power in Europe and greatly expand its sphere of influence. <br>  What Western school children are not taught - for obvious reasons - is the much bigger story behind the official narrative, the story of one of the biggest frauds in human history. Nathan Rothschild, the head of the English branch of the Rothschild crime family, took advantage of his advance knowledge of the outcome of the battle by tricking the London Stock Exchange into believing that Napoleon had won. The resulting crash of the Exchange enabled Nathan Rothschild’s agents to buy the entire London stock market for a Penny in the Pound and seize control of the Bank of England.<br>  <br>  This shameless fraud was ruthlessly repeated in 1929. The private owners of the U.S. Federal Reserve, Rothschild subsidiaries J.P. Morgan, City Bank and Chase Manhattan Bank were awash with money earned by financing World War I. Using their market power, Rothschild’s agents first engineered an artificial boom in the stock market, tricking smaller banks and private investors into putting huge amounts of money into the stock market and then deliberately crashed it, enabling the Rothschild agents to buy most of the U.S. stock market. The ripple effect of the New York crash also enabled Rothschild agents in other countries, such as Germany, to buy local corporations at a fraction of their actual value.<br>  <br>  Eighty years later, it looks like our ruling psychopaths are at it again. They are systematically destroying trust in the U.S. dollar, causing holders of large amounts of green bags to sell them. At the same time, the Rothschild’s are preventing the European Central Bank from printing sufficient Euros for U.S. Dollar owners to exchange all of their holdings into Euros. That way Dollar owners are forced to buy gold instead, causing the gold price to explode.<br>  <br>  Simultaneously, the Rothschild’s are using their influence on the media sector to spread rumours of an imminent crash of the U.S. Dollar and international stock markets. As per usual, in the day and age of infowar, those rumours first started in the alternative Internet based media, only to spread into the mainstream business media. Last week’s ‘global stock and credit market warning’ of the Rothschild owned Royal Bank of Scotland means that the next Waterloo must be imminent. <br>  <br>  All it takes is a trigger such as a thwarted Israeli attack on Iran or the blocking of the Persian Gulf for oil transports, followed by a major stock sell-off by Rothschild agents. Once the world’s stock and credit markets have completely crashed, the price of an ounce of gold will be in the thousands, enabling the Rothschild’s and other owners of large gold holdings to buy the market for a fraction of their true value.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAH3AeFy0SY" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAH3AeFy0...</a>|`|ZuRjSHq2aa	BMW|`|C7zC8cIBaa	By selling us really nice cars|`|nQVM3ry4aa	Largest does not mean richest, germany has huge debts.As to why germany has europe's largest economy : it also has europe's largest population.|`|plcwObqWaa	Because they kept the grass-routes of the economy going, industry.<br>  <br>  @ Col.

fHTvjaYtaa	Ain't it the truth..........and now  four of his "chosen" have withdrawn cause they did not pay their Taxes........The FOX has taken up residence in our Hen House..............Sad.|`|AA12020119	I guess you don't remember that the first Bush had a few as well, one withdrawing.    Obama doesn't want to redistribute wealth (I find that most have no clue what this means). What he wants to do is stop stealing from the poor to give to the wealthy. The rich have had a "temporary" TAX-CUT for years. Taking that away, which is due to expire in 2010 anyway, is not raising your taxes. They are going back to the level they should have been!    Many who are hypocrites, who really fit the the definition, are those who seem to have a hard time with reality and would rather play games with the truth!    And no, Obama is not a hypocrite!|`|JjU6IdnDaa	Redistribution of wealth suggests that you are independently wealthy and in danger of your fortune being given to the poor and undeserving.      Guess again.  $350 Billion Dollars has been issued to special interests without oversight and accountability.  That is redistribution of wealth.  Only it is being allocated to the people who misused the funds initially.    Your children and grandchild are being enslaved by the debt created to bestow more wealth upon the "Leadership Class".  Pay attention before offering criticism of ideas that may protect you, your children and your grandchildren from poverty similar to the type that made the European immigrants come to the US.    You have no access to the hundreds of Billions of special interest dollars urgently distributed during the Presidency of George W. Bush.  Careful of the coffee.  It may be cool aid.    Teach your children Industrial and Technical Economics to make critical decisions for them self.  Do not rely on the press or public officials to explain what is best for you.  You know before anyone else what it requires to feed and shelter your loved ones.    Be careful of being caught up in the bash President Obama wagon.  The gentleman is among the best and brightest of this generation.  Integrity in government must be restored.  Special interests must be harnessed.    If you are that wealthy none of what is presently being discussed in Washington applies to you.  Remember even when gasoline was $5.00 per gallon you could afford it.  You own your own property, so there is no mortgage crisis for you.  In fact you don't even have to invest in the markeplace. Your finances are that secure.      Why do you care about potential redistribution of wealth?|`|5hxWSezPaa	Who better to redistribute???|`|2FsiTlb5aa	Do what I say Not What I Do is the best description of those Democrats.|`|sGpEe35Haa	He is from Chicago and that is ok.

This speaks more to the complexity of the tax code than the honesty of the nominees.  There was no intent to defraud the government of taxes due.    It does not show Obama as a hypocrite, it shows you as an exaggerating whiner.|`|85be78e04e9f820a7ce075e3e85248e8aa	i don't know kinda weird huh is it a coincidence|`|AdIrjmV7aa	Our President's name is Barack Obama.  I voted for him but he is making a mistake supporting white collar crime. If you cheated on your taxes by just $1 you would be thrown in prison for the rest of your life.  Not so in politics. Illegal bank activites who have been given bailout money have been overlooked.  Politians cheating on taxes have been overlooked. The auto industry has been allowed bailouts despite their inability to effectively manage their companies. Banks are laughing at the lack of controls over their spending.  The people of this country are being taken advantage of but they won't do anything about it.|`|AA10448956	Mr. Obama, I have a dream. I dream that one day, my son will be able to live in a free country, with out having to PAY FOR MISTAKES MADE BY THE GOVERNMENT THAT HE WAS TOO YOUNG TO VOTE FOR!!!    I have a dream that my son can one day open his own business WITHOUT HIS OWN GOVERNMENT TRYING TO OVER TAX HIM BECAUSE OF MISTAKES THEY MADE BEFORE HE WAS OLD ENOUGH TO VOTE.    I have a dream that one day, my son, who, guess what, wasn't old enough to vote, won't have to pay back $875,000,000,000 because his government was incompetent.|`|rttm1SLaaa	His "groupie worshipers"?  Since when were the tax increases designated towards a political point of view?  As far as I can recall, he wants to use that money to help people in the middle and lower classes, which, from waht I can remember, is a rather diverse group of political opinions.  And way to go, you can quote a talking point instead of actually arguing that people in his cabinet evaded taxes.  Here's the arguments against that whole tax evasion line:  1. The Geithner situation was way overblown. Why do you think he still got the nomination? It's because the taxes that everyone talked about were required of him to cover his employees, something he didn't know about when he was supposed to pay them. So they contacted him, and he paid those taxes. That's not tax evasion.  2. Daschle was the only other person who was accused of tax evasion (so I don't know what you mean by "all his cabinet nominees"), and the charges were so miniscule that people were writing them off in newspapers as they talked about them.  I have no idea why he decided to pass up his nomination, but he certainly would have been added to the cabinet had he stayed.|`|e19ukSO0aa	He doesn't want to raise taxes - he wants to cut them.

I just hate all those "-isms" as one who's been born and raised in the USSR    To one of the following posters: No, a modern Zionist is not one who hates Islamofascists because I hate them, too. And, by the way, I support Israel in its current attempt to wipe out Hamas. A modern Zionist is the one who supports writing blank checks to Israel no matter what. And this is where our problem begins. Yes, Israel is the only democracy in the region, no doubt about that. But to use is as an excuse for its occupation of the land that doesn't belong to Israel is the ultimate hypocracy. The Jewish settlers are very aggressive and violet toward Arabs, they want everybody to buy their "argument" that the land was given to them by... god. This is the ultimate BS (I, for instance, don't believe in god so, what am I gonna do with that???) and as long as their claim has any effect, the Arab-Jews conflict will not be resolved.    To "THELARGE17": are you hopelessly dumb? Or, rather, you have your own agenda. Zealots like you help illustrate the problem normal people have with the Israeli (and I said "Israeli", not "Jewish") lobby in the US: every time somebody critisizes Israel and/or its policies, he/she is immediately labeled as an antisemitist. Shame on you.|`|KAKXZw0Qaa	I don't' think so . But my biggest fear is that there really is no difference when it comes to politics at the top in Washington DC.  How ever I do like Obama and I do think he has the best intentions or our country.   The problem is that they all live privileged lives and are so out of touch. Obama did not grow up that way and I hope he remembers who and What America is and that is the every day American family.|`|3c91df9cab412a7ca4201cdaf64121e3aa	Wow.

Está separada de los otros continentes por las siguientes distancias: de Suramérica 1.000 km.; de áfrica, 3.600 km.; de Australia, 2.250 km.<br>  <br>  Para la descripción geográfica de la Antártida se utiliza, por convención, la teoría de los cuadrantes según la cual se divide el continente en Oriental y Occidental, tomando como punto de referencia los meridianos de Greenwich, el de los 90° este y el de los 90° oeste. La Antártida Oriental está compuesta por los cuadrantes australiano y africano y la Occidental por los suramericano y pacífico.<br>  <br>  El cuadrante suramericano se caracteriza por comprender la península Antártica y gran cantidad de islas, las más conocidas  son las arcadas, Georgias, Sandwich y Shetland del Sur. Están también las islas Biscoe, la Belgrano, y la más grande del Continente: laAlejandro 1. En el límite del nuestro cuadrante con el del Pacífico se encuentra la isla Pedro I<br>  <br>  Reclamaciones territoriales<br>  Las pretensiones de posesión sobre las tierras antárticas datan del siglo XIX y principios del XX. Sólo en el cuadrante suramericano existen grandes problemas por la superposición de pretensiones, en el resto la cuestión está mucho más clara y definida. Así, el cuadrante africano está todo pretendido por Noruega pero en forma longitudinal, el australiano por Australia y Nueva Zelanda, existe, como es natural por su carácter de ex potencia colonialista, una superposición francesa. En tanto, que el cuadrante Pacífico, salvo un peque?o sector por Nueva Zelanda, no está reclamado por nadie.<br>  <br>  El que si tiene problemas de reclamaciones territoriales es el cuadrante suramericanoen donde se superponen las pretensiones de Chile sobre parte del sector pretendido por Argentina y las pretensiones de Gran Breta?a que abarcan todo el sector argentino y casi todala reclamación chilena.<br>  <br>  Es obvio, y manifiesto a todas luces, que Argentina está en mejores condiciones que Chile y Gran Breta?a para hacer valer sus pretensiones antárticas. Su masa continental es la que está más cerca. Geológicamente existe una continuidad del continente en la penínsulaantártica. Sus posesiones son más antiguas, ya que desde 1904 ocupa en forma permanente,pública y pacífica los territorios antárticos que reclama para sí. Pero el éxito de los reclamos del reconocimiento territorial entre los Estados-nación soberanos que componen el derecho público internacional no se logra sólo con buenas razones e intenciones, sino sobre todo a través del poder persuasivo que se pueda acumular en la defensa del reclamo.<br>  <br>  <br>  Los títulos de soberanía de nuestro país sobre ese sector son múltiples, siendo los principales las siguientes: 1, continuidad geográfica y geológica, 2. herencia histórica de Espa?a, 3. actividades foqueras desde que éstas comenzaron en la región; 4. ocupación permanente de una estación científica que se mantiene desde comienzos de siglo hasta nuestros días: el Observatorio Meteorológico y Magnético de las Islas Orcadas del Sur, inaugurado en 1904; 5. instalación y mantenimiento de otras bases temporarias en la península antártica e islas adyacentes; también en la barrera de hielo de Filtchner, aparte de numerosos refugios en distintos puntos del sector; 6. trabajos de exploración, estudios científicos y cartográficos en forma continuada; 7. instalación y mantenimiento de faros y ayudas a la navegación; 8. tareas de rescate, auxilio o apoyo, tales como el salvamento a comienzos del siglo XX del eminente sabio explorador sueco Otto Nordenskj?ld y sus compa?eros, el rescate de un enfermo y un accidentado, ambos ingleses de la apartada estación de Fossil Bluff; 9. presencia argentina en tierra, mar y aire en todo el Sector, inclusive el mismo Polo Sur, alcanzado en tres oportunidades alternativamente por aviones navales y de la Fuerza Aérea y por la expedición terrestre de Ejército conocida como Operación 90.|`|G98Ah7Xlaa	Da pena ver el hato de ignorantes que responden esta pregunta.<br>  La Antártida no es de nadie.<br>  Nadie tiene derecho a reclamar ese territorio como propio.<br>  De hecho, en la porción que la Argentina se adjudica controlar, también lo hacen Chile y Gran Breta?a.<br>  <br>  Esa estupidez de ense?ar en la escuela que tenemos un millón de km2 en la Antártida parece un capítulo salido de "La razón de mi vida".<br>  <br>  Mejor sería que primero se ocupasen de desarrollar el país antes de andar reclamando territorios que no nos pertenecen.|`|KemuULM1aa	Con respecto a la Antártida existe un tratado internacional y allí se desprende que el sector antártico es patrimonio de la humanidad.

If evidence of tax evasion is available, no.  I'll get to why that doesn't apply to Geithner and Daschle on those specific questions.  2. The Geithner situation was way overblown. Why do you think he still got the nomination? It's because the taxes that everyone talked about were required of him to cover his employees, something he didn't know about when he was supposed to pay them. So they contacted him, and he paid those taxes. That's not tax evasion.  This is directly out of his testimony, and it's also the reason he was accepted.  3. Daschle was the only other person who was accused of tax evasion and the charges were so minuscule that people were writing them off in newspapers as they talked about them. I have no idea why he decided to pass up his nomination, but he certainly would have been added to the cabinet had he stayed.  I don't know why you'd pray about this, you obviously don't know exactly what he did, or for that matter why he withdrew.  "The Lord" confirmed nothing.  4. Give me other examples of dishonesty in his appointments.  Moreover, I would question you as to what possible candidates there are that have no dishonesty at all in their past.  These are politicians, deal with it.  Every previous administration has had some modicum of dishonesty in their ranks because it's unavoidable.  If you can disprove that, I'd be happy to read the argument.  5a. No, they shouldn't.  You're setting an insanely high standard.  How do you measure integrity?  How do you ensure that a person isn't lacking integrity in any way?  I don't know how you'd do this in the slightest.  5b. Where's the proven record?  These people are questioned on every aspect of their past.  Why do you suddenly believe that that's not good enough?  What's missing?    Edit: I looked it up. The taxes the Daschle "dodged" were literally paying medicare on his car, which doesn't even make sense. That's why people didn't care. That's why that wouldn't have been an issue at all.  Isn't it interesting, though, that when we look at the top 10 richest people in the U.S., they're paying, on average, 17% taxes, whereas the rest of us are paying more than double that?  Or how about how many corporations the country over don't pay taxes at all?

During the eight-year period covered by the report, 72 percent of foreign-owned corporations went at least one year without owing taxes, and the same was true for 55 percent of domestic corporations.|`|AA12089018	if I cheated on my taxes, I would have the IRS at my house right now.|`|grQoQUYGaa	Well, apparently Obama thinks so.|`|OFA2LAM5aa	Willfully cheating on your taxes is far different than making mistakes when doing your taxes.     The IRS determines that if it was just a mistake they ask for the money, interest and maybe some penalty.    If you willfully cheat on your taxes, which a lot fo people who support Republicans do this, than you are committing a crime.|`|iLkSVmSqaa	All politicians are crooks!!!!!!|`|d65d0f197c64d26de1e69f8246554c11aa	I understand that people have a right to be proved innocent or guilty of crimes, but committing a crime should bar you from holding a high level position. Regardless of whether failing to pay those taxes was a mistake or not, it was still a crime. We have the right to demand that our leadership be above reproach. Unfortunately our leaders do not seem to share this philosophy.|`|0YVDXvBOaa	Well, I think they need to be treated like anyone else. Do you think the IRS would let a regular citizen get away with "it was just sloppy, sorry I didn't realize I owed $120,000. Yeah right.|`|AdIrjmV7aa	Politians think they are more important than the average person. Think again on who you vote for.
4e2f1073cf0251b4d1fbbaf6e7744c56aa	Definitely Ron Paul! He wants to take out the troops out Iraq but he does not want to make them enemies! He wants to continue trade, travel, and diplomacy with other countries! We need to stay in good conditions with other countries! We can't have another war! Ron Paul wants to keep the peace yet still have availability to other countries! Boo Bacrack Obama!<br>  <br>  <br>  Go Ron Paul until the day I die!|`|cca7e2c40ff381e20859068dfa1e155caa	First of all, thank you for including Ron Paul in your list.  Shows you aren't a brain-washed American who lets the boob tube do your thinking.  <br>  <br>  McCain wants to keep us in Iraq.  More trillions of dollars being thrown away so that his buddies can have a good return on their oil.  Keep the tax breaks that are in place now?  Good idea for the rich!  He tends to forget that MOST of America is middle class.  Bush endorses McCain... need I say more?<br>  <br>  Ron Paul:  Once again, I praise you for your wording!  Common sense indeed!  Sadly, although it is called common sense, it is not so common.  Ron Paul knows that the war was a mistake!  Rumsfeld & Cheney staged that war and now we all have to pay for their terrible agenda.  Those men, along with Bush, scare me (but that's another subject).  Dr. Paul wants to bring our men and women home and bring all that poorly wasted money back to the US!  The war was a mistake!  Just think of what those trillions of dollars would do to our economy.  Oh, and by the way, our country is not in a recession; the media would have you believe that, but we are not.  Dr. Paul wants to open up free trade which would benefit us in so many areas, including healthcare which is a major campaign issue.  When there is competition, the prices go down!  It's plain and simple.  He also knows that our deficit is a huge problem.  He wants to wipe out the national debt and be done with it!  Genius!  The thing is that not many Americans know what a benefit that would be to us!  One more thing, NO MORE IRS!  Another fantastic idea!  It CAN be done!  Contstitutionally speaking, there is no need for the IRS.  Damn the man!   It is obvious, I hope, I am a Ron Paul supporter.  If you want an easy reference table, go on USA Today and go on their Candidate Match Game.  It gives you a side-to-side comparison-- very interesting. <br>  <br>  Obama:  You wrote "subsidize, subsidize, subsidize,"  that makes me think, "communist, communist, communist."  The complete opposite of Ron Paul.  When you subsidize, you are creating more equality.  Less competition = regulized prices.  In a free market, the economy flourishes!  When was the last time you heard positive economical news from Cuba?  To me, Barak is a communist. <br>  <br>  Clinton:  Ha!  More deficit!  She probably forgot that we should have gold behind the paper.  Socialism is not for America.  I just wish the nation would realize it.  National healthcare?  Really?  Just open up the free market and let the players have a chance!<br>  <br>  This is an excellent question.  I hope you find truth in Ron Paul.|`|o50YyW0Naa	OBAMA<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>   OBAMA 08

Palin's "folksy charm" simply masks the fact that she has no command of the facts and does not have the experience to run this country should McCain win and be unable to finish his term.

I didn't see one really winning over the other...it depends on what you believe on the issues.  The other thing is that Palin was counted 10 times skipping around a question and not giving an answer while Biden was only counted 6 times for doing so.  Also Palin had more answers incorrect than Biden when they did the fact check afterwords, so based on that material alone i would have to say Biden.|`|AA11486780	I thought it was more or less a tie.

There is also a lot of controversy surrounding the supply chain of this drug, it is grown and transported illegally and can often cause other problems such as illegal immigration and trafficking, which are derivative of the import process.|`|8ad6fQiNaa	It was illegalized in the 30's. I think it was 1932 exactly. The Surgeon General did a study on the effects of tobacco and cannabis on human subjects. The findings of the study showed that tobacco had no adverse effects on the subjects while cannabis made the subjects irrational. They became hysterical, breaking out into laughing fits and making them mentally unstable.       As we know tobacco ciggarettes do cause major health problems. Marijuana has since been studied and the previous results have been shown to be false. We can conclude and assume that there was either tampering or bribery involved, but we'll never know.       Following the results of the tests, the government started airing public service announcements decrying the evils of cannabis. The aggressive tactics have worked turning our society against the drug that George Washington used to grow.         It's hard to undo that many years of a prohobition of a substance. People keep trying though.|`|AA11828439	Try the site for NORML..|`|ciWdKcgeaa	almost everything you hear about marijuana is a lie.  it's illegal because of racism.|`|FvYqKZSMaa	In some states.Some allow a small amount or only in your own home.|`|AA11540917	because IF it was legal then..  all over the country people would have fabulous back yard marijuana gardens.  big plants loaded with sticky buds in about one out of twenty yards.  thus..  children would be able to get high quality marijuana as easy as picking fruit off a neighbors tree.|`|AA10756487	Like with many controlled substances nowadays, marijuana used to be legal in most countries. But once the government sees that marijuana or any other drug can be increasingly dangerous to society they decide to ban it. Marijuana has only started been used as a recreational drug predominantly in the mid-late 1900's. Same thing with LSD. Such things the government saw as problematic for society and did what they thought was best.   Things like alcohol and tobacco have been used recreationally for hundreds if not thousands of years and would be difficult to ban.   Like of course you say that marijuana is no more dangerous if not less dangerous than other substances that are currently legal and that is true.  I agree with you totally.  However, something that you may want to look at is a psychological term called foot-in-the-door phenomenon which states that if you start small and then the bid is increased then more things are likely to happen.  Case 1: The government legalizes marijuana and then people may persuade the government to legalize stronger drugs such as cocaine, heroine, etc.  Case 2: The government may want to protect us. If a person starts smoking marijauna, then may be more likely to try stronger drugs which may ultimatly ruin a person's life and even kill them.    While I agree with you that marijuana itself if no threat to us anymore than alcohol or tobacco cigarettes, it is the wider scope that needs to be looked at.|`|6d6cbb5a2b06e880fd999f1286785016aa	I think you summed it up.|`|YI8V5e36aa	Your right friend its all about the money... remember its not a war on drugs... its a war on your personal freedom!|`|AdIrjmV7aa	Marijana is not addictive but it is a mind altering drug.  Some politians will try and make it legal so they can control you while you are under the influence.
s5G91umgaa	No if you re-use stamp that has not been conspicuously embossed it will go through to address without problem because nobody will know. Most Royal Mail is sorted automatically, without human intervention, and the marking of the stamp should be part of that process. But sometimes the envelope does not get properly embossed by the system. But some mail has to be sorted by humans usually because envelope it is too badly addressed  for automated system, like failure to put post code under town or illegible handwriting, which all comes back to fact that humans make mistakes, especially when doing a monotonous job through the night..|`|ALxvsSWiaa	Ask all your aquaintances to affix the stamp in the middle of the letter.

Although the rate they are spotted is very low occasionally the internal investigation department (which started before the Peelers did) can sometimes send test items through if they suspect its happening a lot from a particular address.  I cant go into how its done but they do not open the package or interfere with it in anyway.<br>  <br>  Oh there are also some forgeries out there as well but don't use them as RM will charge the recepient the full cost of postage and a ￡1 handing fee.

My BF had two speeding tickets and needed to go driving classes. The recruiter would not let him swear in until he got that cleared up.

How do you pay for it? Are we going to get out of debt by borrowing more money? That is the real bottom line issue. We don't have it so we have 2 choices; borrow from the world or borrow from our future and either way there is more (a lot, a whole freakin' lot more) debt. <br>  <br>  Long-time financial observer and analyst Bob Chapman is dire in his assessment. Using Bank for International Settlements (BIS) figures, he cites a "quadrillion dollar (1000 trillion) powder keg waiting to blow’ and places this problem at the heart of the financial crisis." He thinks "catastrophic losses are inevitable."<br>  <br>  Subprime and mortgage debacles are a "side show" at around a few trillion in losses. The Treasury, Fed, and other smart Wall Street types know it. They’re terrified about potential losses that may (way) exceed the entire world’s GDP and obliterate the balance sheets of every major commercial bank and the Fed. Take down the entire world financial system and cause an unstoppable juggernaut of loss, insolvency, failure and bankruptcy. Resulting in world governments having to nationalize their financial systems and become bankers of last resort.<br>  <br>  If this happens, nations will be bankrupt. So will people.

How many people do you know in debt up to their eyes, but they complain about the government?   <br>  <br>  |`|74dfcb1be61ec91aea7144815438e380aa	no, we've already thrown more money their way than we should have. When wall street melted down, it didn't destroy any businesses or cost any jobs but immense value was lost and many commodities dropped in value as well. There is the thought that this is the economy's way of resetting itself and our meddling will cause more problems than the good it does. I don't know so I'm watching and waiting.|`|yuBuNoPDaa	Yes.

0d385aad146c6803ef040daf578c2c4faa	Yes, I have done my hw, and I have found that Chuck Baldwin is our only hope for any real change and substance in this election.  He discusses true policy, and doesn't hope between petty little "catchphrase" issues.  He is a true government scholar who quotes people like Locke and Hobbes, unlike the petty politicians who hop around from issue to issue, staying in the spotlight as long as they possibly can.<br>  <br>  I am convinced that if Baldwin was given the chance to debate just one with McCain and Obama, he would win this election.<br>  <br>  Don't settle for the lesser of two evils!  Vote Baldwin in 08 for a better America!

kgonf3jPaa	2003 (20th March) not 1993 Leitenant Colonel Tim Collins aka Nails    We go to liberate not to conquer. We will not fly our flags in their country. We are entering Iraq to free a people and the only flag which will be flown in that ancient land is their own. Show respect for them.     "There are some who are alive at this moment who will not be alive shortly. Those who do not wish to go on that journey, we will not send. As for the others I expect you to rock their world. Wipe them out if that is what they choose. But if you are ferocious in battle remember to be magnanimous in victory.     "Iraq is steeped in history. It is the site of the Garden of Eden, of the Great Flood and the birthplace of Abraham. Tread lightly there. You will see things that no man could pay to see and you will have to go a long way to find a more decent, generous and upright people than the Iraqis. You will be embarrassed by their hospitality even though they have nothing. Don't treat them as refugees for they are in their own country. Their children will be poor, in years to come they will know that the light of liberation in their lives was brought by you.     "If there are casualties of war then remember that when they woke up and got dressed in the morning they did not plan to die this day. Allow them dignity in death. Bury them properly and mark their graves.     "It is my foremost intention to bring every single one of you out alive but there may be people among us who will not see the end of this campaign. We will put them in their sleeping bags and send them back. There will be no time for sorrow.     "The enemy should be in no doubt that we are his nemesis and that we are bringing about his rightful destruction. There are many regional commanders who have stains on their souls and they are stoking the fires of hell for Saddam. He and his forces will be destroyed by this coalition for what they have done. As they die they will know their deeds have brought them to this place. Show them no pity.     "It is a big step to take another human life. It is not to be done lightly. I know of men who have taken life needlessly in other conflicts, I can assure you they live with the mark of Cain upon them. If someone surrenders to you then remember they have that right in international law and ensure that one day they go home to their family.     "The ones who wish to fight, well, we aim to please.     "If you harm the regiment or its history by over-enthusiasm in killing or in cowardice, know it is your family who will suffer. You will be shunned unless your conduct is of the highest for your deeds will follow you down through history. We will bring shame on neither our uniform or our nation.      It is not a question of if, it's a question of when. We know he has already devolved the decision to lower commanders, and that means he has already taken the decision himself. If we survive the first strike we will survive the attack.     "As for ourselves, let's bring everyone home and leave Iraq a better place for us having been there.     "Our business now is north."|`|AA11163314	There were no British troops in Iraq in 1993.

Tampoco creo que las mujeres deban salir a la calle envueltas en las sabanas donde durmieron toda la noche. Y como lo dije al principio mucho tiene que ver el hecho de con quien se junten... Pero eso es personal cada quien escoge a sus amistades.

El discurso es, de nuevo, el típico "la mujer violada tiene la culpa de lo que le pasa porque, de algún modo, provoca al agresor con su ropa, sus movimientos, bla, bla, bla", lo cual le quita toda responsabilidad al troglodita que no sabe hacerse cargo de sus instintos.<br>  <br>  Aun con la disculpa expresada hoy por los tarados en cuestión (los jerarcas de la Iglesia), no puede eliminarse la sandez mencionada. Sin embargo, si pudiéramos corregir lo dicho y expresarlo de forma inteligente, sería como sigue, y lo dejo a su entera disposición para que lo vapuleen o lo aplaudan, dependiendo de lo que les parezca:<br>  <br>  Las condiciones en que vivimos hoy en día coartan nuestras libertades. De esta manera, no podemos tener el coche que queramos porque nos lo roban o, peor aún, nos secuestran para pedir rescate, dado que si alguien tiene una buena camioneta, se presupone que hay dinero de por medio. En el caso del vestuario, no podemos salir a la calle con un reloj, unos tenis, o una prenda costosa, porque los amantes de lo ajeno nos lo quitarán, con mayores o menores dosis de violencia dependiendo de sus particulares inclinaciones. <br>  <br>  En el caso de las violaciones, el problema es social: nadie escapa a ellas, porque hay tantos gustos como degenerados andan sueltos en las calles. Así, hay quienes prefieren ni?as, mujeres de mediana edad, jóvenes de ambos sexos, ancianos y ancianas. ?Qué hacer? ?No salir a la calle? Pues nos moriremos de hambre entonces, porque un buen porcentaje debemos ganarnos el pan fuera de nuestra casa. La única solución a la vista parece ser tener un mínimo de precauciones: nadie coarta a las mujeres su derecho soberano de ponerse la ropa que quieran; empero, coincidirán conmigo en que es bastante peligroso salir con escote y minifalda, porque lo mismo se arriesgan a que un tarado las desnude con la vista, les meta mano, o se propase definitivamente. Es lo mismo con los autos: si puedo comprar tal o cual modelo, primero pienso si ello me convertirá en una víctima potencial de un robo o un secuestro. Al ser mi respuesta afirmativa (en las condiciones actuales, forzosamente lo es), elijo comprar un modelo no llamativo, y trato de no circular por zonas peligrosas de la ciudad en horarios inconvenientes... lo cual es casi imposible porque todas las zonas son peligrosas y todos los horarios inconvenientes, pero hago un esfuerzo.<br>  <br>  Se?ores, no hay vuelta de hoja: mientras las autoridades (del partido y del lugar que sean) no nos cuiden en la manera en que deben, nosotros debemos extremar nuestras precauciones para no convertirnos en estadística o en noticia, debemos dar menos oportunidades a los criminales... en suma, debemos hacer que el miedo que sentimos al salir a la calle nos haga precavidos. Una cosa es que la inseguridad nos rodee, y otra que nos pongamos en bandeja de plata para que seamos la siguiente víctima del delito.

That was the mantra in the 1950s and 1960s but special interests stopped it. Being an Alaskan she thought we would all remember that, but we are not as smart as she. She also thought that the Saudi who owned CNN, in having a great share of its stock Prince Alaweed would not curtail the news. And what the stations he owns in stock control did for him was turn it into a joke which those who do not understand repeated without realizing what it meant. It means independence from radical Islams who are controlling the price of oil. We also need to drill and drill now because not only does Alaska have oil but the Chinese are drilling 90 miles off the coast of Florida in international water while our special interest groups wont let us. That is crazy you think the Chinese will spill less off our shores than we would? And why should we give them oil off our shores and not drill it ourselves? It is international waters and we can't stop them but instead special interests stop us! We also have to develop alternative fuel but that will take 10 years and in those 10 years we MUST drill and stop sending US money to oil rich Barron's who have purchased our media as in CNN.<br>  <br>  Further, considering that Obama is being supported by Saudis I think the chances of getting blown up are higher with Obama in office than Palin|`|BwhDwUcKaa	Why do people fail to recognize the Obama is a JUNIOR Senator.

Why do people keep on thinking McCain will die soon. It is just as likely that Obama will get assassinated. We don't know when any of them are going to die. Secondly Bill Clinton was a Governor and ended up the President of the United states of America. |`|AA11130603	Palin is not running for President.

" buys this story" as you put it , well about 50/50, because if he only needed surgeries, and their was NO disability, than they probibly wouldnt have let him out.

Often the current vice president would be running for president, but there's no Cheney. You'd also normally have the sitting president assisting the campaign to some degree, but there's no Bush.<br>  <br>  As a result, they themselves have had to essentially campaign against the current administration despite it being their own party, and that's tough and unusual. I don't think the party and its various resources have entirely had it together. The recent economy and Bush's steep popularity decline have been problematic.|`|j4GjtuVQaa	McCain without Palin would be one of the better Democrat tickets ever.

Yes, he has the political and rhetorical skills to win the election, but he's completely unprepared to govern and his positions on the issues are significantly further left than the American public is aware (and comfortable with -- they just don't know him).|`|zrthZOCdaa	They are great, sincere, dont hang with terrorists, and dont lie about tax breaks, Democrats never cut taxes, they always increase them and on everyone.|`|6QOKsVaPaa	Demos already forgot about Bush Cheney I thought these were your whipping boys haha don't care about anything but a win don't ya..

587533eca4604b2d23fa382dc6204d59aa	The Guantanamo detainees are NOT charged with criminal offenses. They are being given the courtesy of POW treatment although they are unlawful combatants subject to summary execution.<br>  To bring them to U.S. Court is to tell the World OUR courts have criminal jurisdiction WORLD WIDE and that we can "arrest" anyone at any location on the globe, their lack of any violation of local law notwithstanding.<br>  When you are picked up on a battlefield you MIGHT get a status hearing if the circumstances of you being there are ambiguous. Otherwise, you get shot on the spot for fighting "without a flag" or you are accorded POW status if you WERE under one. POWs are NOT criminals. They are neither tried nor sentenced. They are simply held captive to keep them out of the remainder of the fight. It AMAZES me that so many people don't seem to grasp this concept and want the U.S. and I guess the rest of the World to treat captured soldiers as criminals.<br>  <br>  "Combatants" that fight under no country's flag have NO rights under the laws of ANY nation or international convention. It is by our grace that any of the Guantanamo detainees made it off the battle field alive. They are in FACT "unlawful combatants" under international conventions on land warfare and may be executed by the very hand that captures them right on the spot. The term "enemy combatants" gave them a certain color of legitimacy as it roughly equates to "enemy soldiers" who are accorded the sort of POW treatment they're in fact getting.<br>  <br>  Our legitimate choices are:<br>  1) Since we didn't kill them on the spot, treat them as if they're enemy soldiers. In other words, hold them indefinitely without trial until cessation of hostilities.<br>  2) Charge them with war crimes and execute the guilty.|`|bfe4ad38e28ddda61b321173866c1f9aaa	I think that most if not all are considered enemy combatants, they should be considered prisoners of war and not released until they can either proof their innocence or the war on terror is over.|`|z8kAKvGKaa	Once they enter American soil they are given the same rights you and I have for living here- big mistake if you ask me.  |`|2zGSdDvIaa	Using civl courts for t hose things is a capital mistake.<br>  <br>  We will pay for this mistake in american lives.<br>  <br>  I wish it were not true, but we will...|`|AA11433608	No- they are there for military crimes not civil crimes- therefore they should undergo military trials. There is a reason that civil and military laws are different- military is held to a different standard than civilians are.<br>  <br>  Asking this is like asking- Since the civilian courts are backed up and some of the military courts have room can we just try some civilian cases with the military? Wouldn't make sense to do that now would it?|`|zJTF5p9aaa	Military tribunals can only occur for combatants for an invading or enemy country. The people in Guantanamo are "enemy combatants" that fight under no country's flag. Therefore, under the constitution they have the right to habeus corpus. Military members are under the UCMJ, Uniform Code of Military Justice. Different entity, different circumstances for the detainees. |`|u5bct3cdaa	Jesus Christ. Military combatants.  Well let's see.

But they do need to bring those guys to trial. <br>  <br>  Just because they are being held it does not mean they are guilty.

Not so much for the cause they stand for but because of the color of their skin.  They are not white, therefore they shot be killed.|`|lHDff8Braa	You're comparing apples and armadillos.  Courts Martial are for soldiers who break military law.  Courts Martial proceedings are NOT used for prisoners of war.<br>  <br>  You can't have it neither way...either those people are prisoners of war, or they are not.  If they ARE, then they have the protections of the Geneva Conventions.  If they are NOT, then they are considered criminals and would have those protections, including the right to a fair trial.<br>  <br>  If they are neither POWs or criminals, then they should be freed immediately.  It is unconstitutional to imprison anyone, without charge.  There is no such thing as an "enemy combatant".  Bush thought that up to skirt Constitutional law, and thankfully the SCOTUS b**th-slapped him on it.|`|AA11163314	If they come to the US for trial then we will be faced with two choices:<br>  <br>  1)  Allow an Al Queda lawyer access to information concerning who our spies are and what our intelligence capabilities are via the 'discovery' process.<br>  <br>  2)  Withhold any evidence that was obtained via classified operations or classified technology and let the guy walk due to 'lack of evidence.'<br>  <br>  Another issue is that - in some cases - placing them on trial will be a War Crime.  We are allowed to detain persons we capture for the duration of hostilities - but not claim that fight us is a criminal offense.

On the first of these voyages he discovered that South America extended much further (the Indies). Vespucci's voyages became widely known in Europe after two accounts attributed to him were published between 1502 and 1504. In 1507, Martin Waldseemüller produced a world map on which he named the new continent America after Vespucci's first name, Amerigo. <br>  |`|Cee9mUDCaa	Well, it has to do with the explorer Amerigo Vespucci.

A convicted Communist, Eugene Debs was invited to meet with the president and he did.<br>  <br>  Though considered outrageous and liberal for its time, Republicans were responsible for those two historic events.<br>  <br>  Today, we see the Dems seeking so-called liberal policies.<br>  <br>  I do not see them too off base. But my philosophy is simple: both swings of the pendulum must be tempered by reality. That is extreme liberalism and extreme conservatism have their evils.<br>  <br>  I disagree with the Libs not on the issues of the day, but the solutions.<br>  <br>  Their view is that we must literally create government problems to solve social and in some cases, economic problems. As a conservative I have no scruple about giving assistance to the unemployed, the disabled, etc. But the limitation on assistance is that it is a benefit that itself is designed only to help the disadvantaged get back on their feet so that they are strong and can eventually stand on their own.<br>  <br>  The danger of Liberalism is the conversion of assistance benefits from just that, a temporary fix, to an entitlement program. This is the dividing line.<br>  <br>  This is America and in this country when people need help we help them. That is what we are all about and have been. <br>  <br>  But going from help to turning people into wards of the state is state-sponsored economic slavery. The more dependent people become upon the government, the less-likely it will be that they will pursue their lives in a constructive manner without government intervention.<br>  <br>  Likewise, I do not favor the government intervening in peoples' private lives, in their moral convictions or their personal decisions.<br>  <br>  In a sense, though a Republican and a conservative, I see nothing wrong with abortions, gay rights, or even gay marriage. To me those are not issues that the government has any clear choice in except in matters concerning commerce or children.<br>  <br>  To that end I think that this is the right course. But do I favor lifting certain bans on abortions that affect commerce and children, no I do not. <br>  <br>  Finally, I feel that the states have traditionally led the field in regulation of health, safety and welfare and to that end I do not support state bans on adult abortions, guns, or other matters which are local in nature. There are constitutional limitations on the exercise of those police powers and I think that is the extent to which only 1 branch of the government is involved: the Supreme Court.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, our greatest enemy is not liberalism. It is those forces both within and without the nation that seek to take away our rights and impose their will on our people without our consent.<br>  <br>  The second greatest enemy is fear. We may loathe all we want, but fear is not an option and failure is not defeat. Its only a detour on the road map to success.|`|JU3OwbD5aa	You are incredibly ignorant.

It was amazing that he could reproduce...although he did pass the "drunk gene" onto his daughters. He makes K-Fed look like a Nobel Prize winner. He could not find his rump in the dark, with a searchlight, a mirror, and both hands.He is the only person in the history of mankind to actually have his IQ increased by drug and alcohol abuse. He cannot pronounce a word with more than two syllables. He is only allowed to play with blunt scissors. He can, in his defense, point at passing trains and say, "Choo-Choo."

Why don't they have a right to choose who they want to commit their life too. That to me is disgusting. <br>  <br>  And things for the mention of Kristallnacht I didn't even realize the date. Most people don't even know what that is- sad isn't it! I guess it should not surprise me  since the public schools have become crap (I homeschool my children - believe me they know what it is). ;)|`|Ay5HrCTeaa	16,000 CA marriages still valid + Conneticut legalized same sex marriage today.<br>  Next to legalize it: Norway on January 1st.|`|9cpKYneZaa	It won't happen. If anything I would expect them to rampage through San Francisco and trash out Nancy Pelosi's home and businesses.|`|TKZ5tcV3aa	Guess what you gay pig.............you have been reported for abuse a second time.|`|zHQVlXd5aa	Don't be this way.  They have not committed any crime so they aren't going to jail.|`|bQLQdRBZaa	There's nothing "illegal" involved. The law (e.g. Proposition 8) simply means the relationships aren't recognized by the state.  Despite the hatred of the religious extremists, however, there's nothing illegal about the relationships, whether the state chooses to recognize them or not.
fQndlEOIaa	There isn't really a legal difference between "state" and "commonwealth."  Although Virginia, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Kentucky all call themselves "commonwealths," the relationship with, and governance of, the people is the same as with a state.<br>  <br>  The term "Commonwealth" comes from political theory (literally, "common" and "weal," which means "the public good.") At its most optimistic, this would mean that, as active and ongoing participants in their "common-weal," Virginians should enjoy a higher degree of sovereignty — and a higher degree of responsibliity for how good, virtuous and socially responsible their self-created government is.<br>  <br>  So, the terms "state" and "commonwealth" are largely distinctions without differences.  But Virginia has been using the term since 1776, and continues to do so.  So, technically it is the "Commonwealth" of Virginia, not the "State" of Virginia.
XkXxaDi3aa	It does in a basic sense, without it a place like california would rule and the big cities. <br>  But, I do think it's wrong that if you win by one vote in a state you get ALL the electoral votes. I think that you should get portions of the electoral votes depending on what the popular vote was in that state :]|`|xjcZkmpbaa	It still operates to give the smaller (less populous) states a greater say in the election. I live in Colorado, which has 9 electoral votes.  Since it's a "winner takes all" system under the electoral college, and since the election was fairly close according to the polls, the candidates spent significant time and money here, trying to tip the balance in their favor.  Without the electoral college, the most that any candidate could have expected by spending resources here, is to gain a small percentage advantage in the real numbers of actual voters here, which is relatively small.  Not worth their time and money.  All elections would be decided by California, New York, and a few other states and the concerns of voters in smaller states would be largely ignored.|`|SIKuOevVaa	Obama was not declared the winner until 8:00 Pacific Time, when California, Oregon, Washington and Hawaii closed.  That left Alaska as the only State still voting, and, let's face it, it was going to go Republican even if their dimwit Governor wasn't on the GOP ticket.  There are issues with the Electoral College, but this isn't one of them.|`|JufaTgT9aa	Not exactly.  It was actually established because the founding fathers didn't believe that the general population could be trusted to pick a president.  So they put in the electoral college to ensure that if the people elected someone completely unqualified to be president, they won't elect someone else.  <br>  <br>  .....If it works, the electoral college will vote in McCain.|`|74f74357f1e97881285bef9af7de548faa	not in it's present form they need to rethink the format from the present to one that will candidates to pay attention to every state <br>  <br>  How about this 50 states, Each state get four votes with a 3/4 majority needed (150 votes to win.|`|0440336faf3bbaada17aec78b1b564b2aa	It's definitely an antiquated idea.  |`|FKqtAhjraa	I think the electoral college is an outdated  system.

It is a country made up of member states. 3/4 of the states or 2/3 of Congress say otherwise it is what it is.<br>  <br>  I believe in the two prior elections it was eastern states too close to call decided the election and in several cases it was California that decided the election. <br>  <br>  |`|FkeMSxQDaa	Honestly, no. What it does is bases itself upon population of the certain region (in this case, state) and whatever the majority of the people vote for goes within that region. The flaw is on a national scale, even if 75% of the country votes for one side, it is STILL possible for the other side to win, because they won the larger areas. To me it doesnt make sense, but it is an opinion.|`|G7G9liR6aa	Yes it makes sense. It only works out that way because CA always goes blue. <br>  <br>  If we had a national popular election  there would be no campaigning. It would just be one infomercial after another, as TV is the only way to reach the entire country.|`|D6ytv2Bjaa	It all has to do with population.  The population creates these votes (I'm not entirely sure how they get the exact number of electoral votes that they get for each state), and they add 2 for the senators from the state.  |`|mhUalkf5aa	It did when it was concieved but now the system is outdated because <br>  you can win the popular vote and lose the election based on electoral votes. I think it should be abolished .|`|U23BIO3Laa	To me it makes perfect sense. Those states with larger amounts of people have more say as far as the number of electoral votes because they represent a greater percentage or the american people. In statistics class we called this weighted averages i believe|`|i2vISNWDaa	if you want your cndidate to only be campaigning in cali, texas, and new york <br>  <br>  then yes it makes alot of sence|`|4ZaAZgCgaa	The bigger states have more senators and representatives because they have a higher population.  I don't see how you think it doesn't make sense.  The reason we kne who would be president before the weststates finished voting was because we already knew which candidates would win them.|`|AA11313983	I understand the basic concept of the electoral college, but not the "winner take all" policy all but two states have.  Nowhere else will you see a 4% margin of victory described as a landslide.  Obama won, and my hat's off to him, but 4% is not a landslide.<br>  <br>  We might as well switch to a national winner take all.  That way, every President would win with a 100% margin of victory.|`|3M1R22zraa	If you vote against the majority in your state, you're vote is thrown away. Why does that not piss people off?<br>  <br>  And politicians only pander to the states with the most electoral votes anyway.  A few big states and it's over for the rest of the country.<br>  <br>  Each state, each person, should be counted as equal.<br>  <br>  |`|BUPiXrxVaa	totally<br>  <br>  It is based on population in an area, not land mass. The founding fathers were very smart and perceptive. The only thing that might make sense to change, would be to let each electoral vote count as a separate vote.|`|9HRkwzruaa	No, it doesn't.  It hasn't for decades.  It was a necessary compromise during the foundation years of our nation, but is now one of the most useless - and quite frankly damaging - institutions in our government.|`|dEWOYVeBaa	I was wondering that also. I think all states should be worth the same amount. It's not fair that California has 55 electorals always going towards Democratic. It's still popular-vote by state.
JyZI7vE6aa	Was there another burglar with him stealing property?<br>  <br>  If so, I'm thinking that it is "co-mentor" and that it means that they were advising each other on the best way to steal the property.<br>  <br>  This is just a guess.  <br>  <br>  Whew, this is going to be expensive for you.

He even advocated this while in the Illinois Senate.<br>  <br>  Obama is for gun control. Are you listening, hunters and folks who just want to protect their family in case their home is broken into?<br>  <br>  Obama approves of baby killing (abortion). He voted to lift the ban on partial-birth abortion.<br>  <br>  Obama has the former CEO and CFO of the failed Fannie Mae as financial advisors. They helped create this mess, and now they can tell him how to fix it?<br>  <br>  In 2005, when George Bush, John McCain and others were calling for tighter controls on lending institutions, Obama and others voted against it. Oh, and don't blame this mess on Bush. Bill Clinton, a Democrat, was the president who pushed for loaning to those whose credit was less than stellar.<br>  <br>  Obama says he is a Christian, but he has also said, "I will stand with the Muslims if the political winds shift in an ugly direction." (From his book "Audacity of Hope.") Do you know what the Muslim goal is? World rule and making conversion to Islam mandatory or be killed.

Plus he keeps talking about the "wealthy" he's had unlimited amount of cash to spend on his campaign-from wealthy people who under his plan will be taxed more-when do you think his plan will be up and running 2 years from now, 3? NEVER? That's why we're angry-we know nothing about a guy who's supposed to run our country except bad things...|`|bM7W27Ctaa	According to a text message that I received,  "pass the word to drink plenty of water because theres gonna b a lot of salty crackers."|`|7fcwpALpaa	Agree with Saracuda.|`|HwlBgOEraa	No, only time will.|`|564611842b49f5e66f48b5de01e3b249aa	God sent the races their separate ways at the Tower Of Babel, I don't think he can undo Gods will|`|13db40225fc025aff3b81b2609fc6918aa	Using the Black panthers as a security detail is a good start to race relations.<br>  Once again , I am amazed at how the Obama supporters want peace.8 years of Democratic bashing of the republicans and Bush,now we are ready for peace.Ha fat chance.Time for us to be the dissenting opinions and obstructive nature.Looks like 4 years more of gridlock |`|0KFGVrYuaa	He called his grandmother a typical white after she expressed fear of a panhandler who happened to be black.

A person upon true monotheism, who worships God alone without associating any partners with him. A Muslim is someone who Bears witness that None has the right to be worshipped but Allah, and Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. A Muslim can be of any background, race, country and gender.<br>  <br>  The Declaration of Faith in Islam. There is no Deity worthy of Worship except Allah and Muhammad is his Messenger. <br>  Islam is not a new message, it is indeed an old one. It is a message from Allah that was revealed to many Prophets before Prophet Muhammad . All the Prophets were ordered by God to submit to him and worship him alone. A message of "Tawheed", to single him out for worship and not associate any partners with him. So, all the Prophets, from Adam through to Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus and Muhammad were all followers of Islam. They are all Muslims.<br>  <br>  What Religion did Abraham Follow ? All the Prophet's Sent by God had the same Message. The Message of Islam, to worship One God without associating any partners with him. <br>  One and a half billion people (more than one fifth of the world's population) from a vast range of nationalities and cultures across the globe - from the southern Philippines to the western coast of Africa - are united by the common Islamic faith. Of these, about eighteen percent live in the Arab world. The world's largest Muslim community is in Indonesia, and substantial parts of Asia and much of Africa are Muslim, while significant minorities are to be found in what used to be called the Soviet Union, as well as China, North and South America, Europe and Oceania. For Muslims, Islam is both a religion and a complete way of life.|`|8tq0dfPFaa	A Muslim (Arabic: ????? pronounced Muslim, not Muzlim) is an adherent of the religion of Islam. The feminine form is Muslimah[1] (Arabic: ??????). Literally, the word means "one who submits (to God)". Muslim is the participle of the same verb of which Islām is the infinitive.[2] Muslims believe that there is only one God, translated in Arabic as Allāh. Muslims believe that Islam existed long before Muhammad and that the religion had evolved with time from the time of Adam until the time of Muhammad and was completed with the revelation of verse 3 of Surah al-Maeda:<br>  <br>      This day have I perfected your religion for you, completed My favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion.<br>  <br>  The Qur'an describes many Biblical prophets and messengers as Muslim: Adam, Noah (Arabic: Nuh), Moses (Arabic: Mūsā) and Jesus (Arabic: ?īsā) and his apostles. The Qur'ān states that these men were Muslims because they submitted to God, preached his message and upheld his values. Thus, in Surah 3:52 of the Qur'ān, Jesus’ disciples tell Jesus, "We believe in God; and you be our witness that we submit and obey (wa ashahadu bil-muslimūna)."<br>  <br>  Most Muslims consider making ritual prayer five times a day a religious duty (fard) (see the section on Ismā?īlīs below for exceptions); these five prayers are known as fajr, dhuhr, ?asr, maghrib and ?ishā'. There is also a special Friday prayer called jumu?ah. Currently, the number of Muslims is estimated to be 1.3 billion.<br>  <br>  <br>  Islam<br>  <br>  Most Muslims accept as a Muslim anyone who has publicly pronounced the Shahadah, which states, "There is no god except God and Muhammad is His Messenger."

Go to college and take some criminal justice classes.  Be a good boy and don't drink and drive in that time.
