a0ea30926acdfeb82a6d6f9ca13bcc69aa	Definitely worse.  When people say that we are raising the lower class up, what we're actually doing is lowering the middle class down.<br>  <br>  For example, Obama want to raise the minimum wage to $9.50 an hour in the next two years and index it to inflation.<br>  <a href="http://www.barackobama.com/issues/poverty/" rel="nofollow">http://www.barackobama.com/issues/povert...</a><br>  If he does it, some companies will lay off employees and some will have to raise their prices to compensate for the additional labor costs.  All those people who have worked their way up to $9.50 an hour will be back to making minimum wage because they won't get any raises.  Through their hard work, they've worked their way up for nothing.  An unskilled teenager starting his/her first job will make as much as them.<br>  <br>  With the huge spending bills that are being proposed, someone will have to pay.  In fact, all people who actually pay taxes will have to pay.<br>  <br>  More and more people will be dependent on the government to live.  As the dependent people increase, the responsibility to pay for them is on fewer and fewer people.  For example, the SCHIP bill covers people who make up to $70k and who are under 30 years old.  Social security pays for the care of those over 63.  What will happen to those who are between 30 and 63?  They'll be footing the bill for everyone else.  And we all know that the revenue from tobacco users is NOT going to cover the costs of SCHIP.|`|CbL4ybdLaa	More than likely, the same.|`|OiZBv8OVaa	its gonna get worse before it gets better.

The actual reason as to why many Black Americans don't refer to themselves as "African-Americans" is due to the notion that being a descendant of Africa is a badge of shame. The term "Black American" will only last so long; it will inevitably turn into "Brown American", due to the misconception amongst many Black individuals that Black is often connoted with malevolence and banality. Who knows where "Brown American" will lead to next.

azq1win0aa	I'm not trying to push anyone out of anything, but if you are defining the term Christian they aren't adhering to it. IF you think Mary is sinless then you are putting her on the same level as Jesus our redeemer and that is blasphemy. There aren't four parts to the trinity, there is a reason that we worship the father , son, and the holy spirit. IF you feel like you must confess to a priest then you aren't adhering to the Bible where it says to go to Jesus to wash away your sins, many inconsistencies like this concludes for me that catholics aren't Christian, I'm not the judge but if you don't believe what God says then who are you to believe?|`|3ZgOAUOTaa	that is the way of "christians"...  attack those you disagree with, particularly it they also claim to be christians... <br>  <br>  it comes from believing their way is the only way...|`|4OjLMQ6Yaa	Yes it is childish. But then again alot of Protestants bicker with each other too.|`|gmaCvh00aa	I dunno.  That started up about four or five hundred years ago.<br>  <br>  I was never Catholic, but the most Christian person I know as far as living like Christ did is a devout Catholic.  She's the real deal, lives her life for others.  There aren't many like that.<br>  <br>  The basic issue they seem to have is that they believe the bible is the only source of information and cannot accept that not all Christians feel that way.  The born-again/bible-is-God thing is fairly recent in Christian history.<br>  <br>  No one has the inside on exactly everything that's right to believe or not, so who cares?<br>  <br>  ****<br>  <br>  Denise T - Love that typo in your second sentence.  It's accurate in a way.  But Catholics can't really claim being the first church--I think that prize goes to what is now the Greek Orthodox Church.|`|38f15601baa14cb41ff2021454524fbbaa	It's a combination of their ignorance, arrogance, and desperation to validate their own bizarre form of Christianity. <br>  <br>  As you will no doubt see when the fundamentalists start flocking over this question like vultures.|`|ttTDiJWfaa	The claim is based on the Roman Catholic Church introducing Pagan rituals into Christianity. The rituals followed by Catholics but not other Christian denomination are Pagan in nature.|`|3GAiVmEAaa	I have no clue. I have only seen this here. It makes no sense to me at all.|`|iVU7beMuaa	I wouldn't worry too much about these folks.  They have little, if any, authority to define what Christianity is, and when they do it is in a "if you don't believe as I do then your not Christian" way.  They seem to be acutely aware of what Christian are not, but ask them to tell you what a real Christian IS and they start to draw blanks.<br>  <br>  Catholicism is the oldest Christian organization currently in the world.  Different Christian church have different doctrines and traditions, but they have a common unity in accepting Jesus of Nazareth as the Son of God and Savior of the world.|`|myjB1nWGaa	The answer is because of ignorance. I am going to try and be nice answering this question. I was raised Baptist and converted to Roman Catholicism. It is the best decision I ever made. I love being Catholic and believe everything the Church “believes, teaches and professes to be true”. I said this at my Confirmation and I repeat it without apology. Most Protestants don’t marginalize Catholics, but certain hyper-Calvinists do. These sects are extremely ignorant of Catholic teaching, indeed of the teachings or history of their own denomination. They adhere to an illogical interpretation of the bible, denying even that dinosaurs walked the Earth. There is no mention of Sola Scriptura or Sola Fide at any of the Ecumenical Councils. Do they read the Early Church Fathers? No, for them an “early church father” is Martin Luther. Martin Luther believed in Mary’s perpetual virginity; so did John Calvin, but who knew. Anti-Catholics prey on the ignorant. The Catholic Church has no one to blame, but itself. Catholic ignorance is the result of poor catechesis. Roman Catholics must learn their faith. Anti-Catholics need to learn history. "To be deep in history is to cease to be a Protestant," wrote John Henry Newman (www.envoymagazine.com... March/April 1997 - Friends in the Field). I can defend my faith, but I refuse to argue with the ignorant. I am not saved by Faith alone or Scripture alone. I am saved by grace which is a free gift. I don’t need to justify my relationship with Jesus to anyone. When Catholics begin to learn their faith, it will force these anti-Catholics to focus on their own salvation. Tend to your own garden before you weed that of your neighbor! There is no “Protestant” section at the Church of the Holy Sepulcher! An Orthodox joke; “How do you explain The Dormition to a Protestant? The answer is, “YOU DON’T”!<br>  <br>  <br>  PS. I am so glad I was not raised in an Anti-Catholic home!|`|RoYL4tyjaa	Dont talk about mein Fuhrer like that<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mein_fuhrer/3272576360/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/photos/mein_fuhrer...</a>|`|xZet9Dunaa	Believe or not Catholic were the first Christian.

ngHumYxvaa	Three CORE Members murdered in Mississippi<br>  <br>  Freedom Summer was a highly publicized campaign in the Deep South to register blacks to vote during the summer of 1964.<br>  <br>   During the summer of 1964, thousands of civil rights activists, many of them white college students from the North, descended on Mississippi and other Southern states to try to end the long-time political disenfranchisement of African Americans in the region. Although black men had won the right to vote in 1870, thanks to the Fifteenth Amendment, for the next 100 years many were unable to exercise that right. White local and state officials systematically kept blacks from voting through formal methods, such as poll taxes and literacy tests, and through cruder methods of fear and intimidation, which included beatings and lynchings. The inability to vote was only one of many problems blacks encountered in the racist society around them, but the civil-rights officials who decided to zero in on voter registration understood its crucial significance as well the white supremacists did. An African American voting bloc would be able to effect social and political change.
eybHcHz9aa	Ooh goody, a question I can answer really well!<br>  <br>  Most of the modern tarot decks you will find in the shops, be they Vampires or Clowns are based on the "Rider-Waite" deck, also published as the "Universal Waite" which is the same but shaded a little better. It was drawn by Pamela Colman Smith in 1909 (her story comes with the little booklet in the box). The symbolism is much older, and you'll also find different renderings of the cards (my "death" card is on a horse, not reaping in a field as is common). <br>  <br>  I cannot reccomend any "starter packs" because most tarot readers will tell you first to find your own meanings, then to seek out a book that works for you. I use Amber Jayanti's "Living the Tarot", which covers the major cards in detail, one by one and without any wishy washy fluffy stuff!<br>  <br>  US games systems inc are one of the bigger tarot publishers, and also make the Tarot games as well.

Since his death in police custody, he has been called a martyr of the anti-apartheid movement.[2] While living, his writings and activism attempted to empower black people, and he was famous for his slogan "black is beautiful", which he described as meaning: "man, you are okay as you are, begin to look upon yourself as a human being".[3] Despite friction between the ANC and Biko throughout the 70s[Need quotation on talk to verify] the ANC has included Biko in the pantheon of struggle heroes, going as far as using his image for campaign posters in South Africa's first non-racial elections in 1994.[4]|`|AA10985791	He stood up to the Apartheid government in place in South Africa in the 1970s, and was found dead in a police cell for his efforts.

R5UIMBvcaa	In a nutshell, Hector is more of a family man than Achilles, and he's fighting a war to defend his country from the consequences of his brother's theft of another man's wife.  The glory he achieves during the Iliad is part of the way Zeus grants Achilles' prayer to let the Trojans win for a while, but Hector himself doesn't know that and thinks he has just hit stride.  He's actually afraid of Achilles but forces himself to face him because he feels responsible for the deaths of many of his men, who were killed because he didn't take the opportunity to retreat into the city soon enough.  Achilles is a better warrior simply because he IS.  Although the Iliad doesn't say anyhing about Acillles' being invulnerable except in one spot, it does make it clear that he is the best warrior in either army.  However, he lacks Hector's compassion for others, and although he has a nearly-grown son back in Greece, we aren't even told who that boy's mother is.  He's much more out for number one than Hector is.<br>  <br>  So there's a little to get you started.  Now you need to go back through the Iliad and make a note on any passage that shows something about either of them in relation to one of the qualities you mentioned.  Note the book an dline number on each card.  Then arrange those cards in piles--one for each quality in each hero,so that you'll have twice as many piles of cards as there are qualities on which you're comparing the two.  When you write the paper, don't discuss one hero fully and then the other.  Discuss one quality as it's exhibited by one and then the other, and then go on to the next quality.  And whenever you refer to an incident in the Iliad, put the book and line number in parentheses..<br>  <br>  I agree that that's quite an assignment for tenth grade, but once you've made those notes, the job won't seem nearly so overwhelming!

Humans always hang themselves with new rope all the time. Small regrets or large regrets - humans carry huge burdens daily.

Then the mother strictly disciplines and sooths the pain - at the same time.

Now if one looks at free will in the absence of a Just and Holy God, the consequences are only in the present life.  And if one believes there is no God, then life ends at death.  <br>  <br>  God says He created us and that He created us because He loved us before we loved Him and that all He wants from us is our love.  So, if God is Holy and Just, He must by His nature reward love and punish disobedience just as our parents here on earth do or did.  However, God is eternal and if we are to be with Him, we can only be with Him because we love Him and in loving Him, we obey Him and are rewarded.  Our reward is not only His riches but eternal life and a new body.  Sin is a temptation, it isn't a condition in the sense that one can take medication for it.  A child disobeys the parent because it thinks the parent won't know or find out but the child knows that if the parent knows, there's a price to pay.  Eternal damnation (separation from God eternally) is the price of unrepented sin and disbelief in the One who created us.|`|uAMzmAwaaa	ok, so this is what you are saying.... <br>  - God tells us what the punishment for sin is.<br>  -any sane person wouldn't want that punishment.<br>  -therefore we do not chose whether or not to sin.<br>  <br>  (please tell me if i misunderstood what you were saying)<br>  <br>  if i understood you correctly then that's really bad logic...|`|xlHC8qPqaa	JESUS taught , There is no free will, period.

I can only give you what has been given me...In the heavens Jesus states that He is building a city, which has 12 gates and above these 12 gates are 12 different stones.  In the world today we have 12 different and distinct personalities, which all have their own opinions and beliefs.  I represent merely one of these...<br>    I believe in Jeremiah, the Lord states clearly that He knew Jeremiah before he was formed in the womb.<br>    Revelation states that God knows the beginning from the end...22<br>  The Bible states there are those born to everlasting life and those born to the sword<br>    Also the Bible says  not to cast your pearls(valued information) to swine(unworthy men)<br>    In Genesis, the lord said, "Behold, the man has become like one of Us, to know good and evil.  And now, lest he put out his hand and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live forever"-<br>    God placed a cherubim at the east of the garden of Eden, and a flaming sword which turned every way to guard the way to the tree of life...3:24<br>    I have studied some on whether or not our future, is free will, chance, or preordained.  In my opinion, the Lord knows who is and who is not, yet He has given everyone the opportunity to choose in whom we would rather follow.  The bible says that all of us fall short  of the Glory of God, herein lies the purpose for Jesus life and sacrifice.  <br>    God has given us choice.  He also has explained in detail, through others experiences, and parables.  He says there is nothing new under the sun, what is has been before.  This is why the Bible is such a good guide.  Written by 66 men at different stages of history.  Even the gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John may have been the same time in history but they were written at the same time many miles apart.<br>    If I were born to God and the world held more pleasure to me than He, would it not then be accounted to me as free will, to choose the wide path?  And say I was born having no roots(my parents taught me nothing of the Scriptures)and yet I met a holy man who proceeds to lead me to the path of righteousness, and I choose not to follow, which thousands do, wouldn't that also be pro-choice?<br>    I believe that God knows ahead of time who are His and who are not His. If none are perfect why would anyone worry about hell!  And if God if a merciful God, why then would He burn people forever?  If earth is hell, which is where satan and his fallen angels fell to, and Jesus said He is going to set up his kingdom, heaven, here on earth after it is made new, then why would he keep a fire burning forever????? POINT IN FACT he will not.  Forever is until the end of that person or thing.  Fire only burns while it has something to burn...I seriously doubt that while I'm walking through the streets of gold, I am going to be looking at wickedness burning forever, out my window. yuk... no way... that is a ridiculous thought.<br>    The Lord does not blame us for being weak sinners, but asks us to do our best to be strong and sin no more....fs|`|664ef7ac282ab7a5fe638caafbfb05b3aa	I like it that you have thought out your question well and expressed it clearly.<br>  <br>  Here are some things for you to consider.<br>  <br>  We can see empirically that even though there is a reward/punishment factor to be considered in our free will, it has had little effect on most people.  Because we also have desires and the lure of instant gratification that counter our spiritual reasoning and long-term (eternal) planning.<br>  <br>  Jesus tells His Apostles in Matthew 7 to expect that there will be few that find the gate to heaven.  Note: there is "finding" involved.  We control if we want to find God.  Also note that the path is difficult.  Even though we ultimately know there will be a reward "in the end," we will have many people working against us as well as our own desires.  Just look at this forum (R&S) as an example -- there are many people that could care less about peoples' spirituality and seeking God, but instead try to tear them down, making their own poor lives seem better.  Furthermore, sin itself is a very powerful lure.<br>  <br>  Furthermore, out of the few that decide to follow God, many of them will try to do it according to THEIR beliefs rather than God's will (Matthew 7:21 ....).  They trust their own logic & reasoning more than they trust God's.  In the end there will be very few that will actually enter heaven EVEN THOUGH EVERYONE HAD FREE WILL TO CHOOSE THEIR OWN ETERNAL DESTINY, BASED ON HOW THEY LIVE THEIR LIVES NOW (the all-caps are to stress the irony).<br>  <br>  So now back to your question.  Just because there is strict punishment guaranteed, it has had and will continue to have very little influence on MOST people.  Sad but true.<br>  <br>  Good luck.  Think about it.  Research & study it.  Figure it out.|`|AA10471679	Ok, let's try this on for size:  <br>  <br>  I hold a bowling ball in my hand.  I am holding it by my own free will.

The pain may be considered "severe coercion."  I choose to consider it as A Real Good Reason to not drop the ball.<br>  <br>  To be slightly less facetious:  I now set off metal detectors because of what they put in my heart just before Christmas.  I still may exercise free will and smoke my beloved cigars, cigarettes and pipes, and I may still choose to eat the same things I used to eat.<br>  <br>  But the words of Deuteronomy 30:19 still apply:  "... I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose life..."|`|jb0bgFXZaa	Respected question and a genuine logical debate persists on this issue.The standard issue response says you have free will to choose God on earth and suffer the consequences in the after-life for that decision.It appears to be a question of faith.Will I choose to believe this based on this evidence or will I choose not to believe this for whatever reason.Tough question to answer.Where does pre-destination fall in the debate as well?|`|nrXCCf76aa	This is by far one of the best, most interesting questions I have ever read. <br>  <br>  I am currently reading the book "23 Minutes In Hell" by Bill Wiese. I started it last night around 8pm b/c I've been sick so I've been going to bed like early as...I was going to say hell but I realized another point in the book about us using the word hell so casually, and I'm more than halfway through the book even though I've been at school (Yup, I got in trouble like 5-6 times about reading in class, lol). Now I feel bad for saying "hell" or even thinking it....<br>  <br>  <br>  Sorry, got carried away on stupid stuff how I ALWAYS do. I'll be talking (or in this case typing) about one thing then I slowly drift off into another subject.<br>  <br>  Well, it said about how God loves us soooo incredibly much and Him telling us about hell is not like a threat like "I'm gonna damn you to hell if you screw up!" and he used a good scenario, I guess the word is, of how a dad tells us not to play in the street. The dad can't tie us down worrying that we're gonna go play in the street, our parents<br>  are going to plead with us not to play in the street, but if we make that decision. <br>  <br>  So that, in my opinion, was a good scenario or whatever the word is, lol (What's with me and "lol"-ing?-- gosh, makes me look like a snobby tween). And you're right-- like "Wow, I wonder which one I'm gonna choose, hell or obey the church folk against my will?" if people believe in hell. <br>  I'm not a Christian against my will, but I'm sure some people feel that way. <br>  I really recommend the book to EVERYONE. My friend wanted me to tell her what was happening in the book currently, but I could tell by looking into her eyes that she didn't believe a word I was saying and we were in an arguement yesterday b/c she called me ignorant so I'm not so hesitant to be kinda rude so I flat out said "I can see it in your eyes, you don't believe me." and she said "Nope". And I'm not very gullible, but this is convincing to me, I just feel like he's telling the truth, even though I'm sure not a lot of people will. Gosh, Tyra's been a b***** lately...Once again, drifting on to other subjects. Shoot, I hope she doesn't see this....<br>  She called me crazy today (in a rude way, she said it b/c I told Dillon he was eating fiery gremlin turds b/c that's what it looked like ever since the roach on the tray incident so she told me gremlins don't exist ever so sarcastically and so I told her I know that and she said "Oh, well, if you did, you'd be retarted") Sorry about that. <br>  <br>  Do I have a.d.d or something b/c I keep drifting on to other subjects, I'm sorry. <br>  <br>  So, it was a really good point that like God is pleading with us b/c He loves us soooo much and that hell was supposed to be a place for satan (I'm really scared to capitalize the "s" in satan, lol) and his fallen angels, but b/c we sin, God gave Jesus as a sacrafice for our sins. And He wants us so badly to take Jesus as our Savior. <br>  And God had sent Bill Wiese there and then took Him out of Bill's mind b/c then he wouldn't be so afraid, and He wanted Bill to fear it to know and be able to understand how those who are tormented in hell feel, but then answered Bill's questions when He came to hell and told Bill to tell them what he had experienced. It is an AMAZING book, and it probably sounds like noise, and I'm sorry if I'm preaching, but I think you'd like the book too, even if you don't believe it, it could be a good horror book I guess? It's the same guy that made the video in which you answered the question and that's why Tyra called my ignorant, so you probably agree and also it's probably a little dissuading to read it now. <br>  <br>  I'm sorry if I went all preacher-ish today, even a little, but the question reminded me of the scenario and that's I guess what they mean by free will, Hope it helps(:<br>  <br>  -Abby(:|`|t8JlnuqFaa	Free will, or free choice is important in salvation.

We would have no individuality. We could make no choices. God could not feel proud when we triumph over sin. However despite having the gift of free will we must use it as God intended it. In order to enforce that which is right God must punish those who do wrong. One could compare God to a judge here on Earth. If no judge appointed punishments for criminals there would be chaos. People would have no reason to follow the law. This is why every civilization had a judge of some kind. You state that damnation "Compels one into behaving in an involuntary way via intimidation." Using the word involuntary implies that we have no choice but to do good because of damnation. However people can and do choose to sin daily. The only alternative to punishment of those who do wrong is to simply let people do whatever they want. No civilization has let people do whatever they want because this creates chaos. That is why civilizations create laws and enforce them to keep order. God works the same way. He uses his law and punishments to keep order. Therefore God must allow people to make mistakes (see beginning as to why) but at the same time punish people for those mistakes. Free will and damnation do not contradict each other. By the way I thought this was important to add. God does not damn people for their disbelief but for their sin. However, God knows we cannot possibly go through life without sinning. God loves us therefore he created a way to avoid judgment. We must put our faith in God with all our heart. Faith does not just mean belief but also devotion and obedience towards God.  So it is not through disbelief that we are damned but through faith that we are saved.|`|E9chZY74aa	God has told us or rather warned us that there is a day coming when He will separate Good from Evil.

Forget whether you are right or wrong...where is the connection between free will and damnation...It can only be in your idea of what God is like. He is said to be -- and is, in Jesus, the revelation of God -- just and merciful. <br>  We don't know who goes to Hell, but if God is as He says, it isn't a problem. And if He isn't, why accept Hell in the Bible and reject the rest. Stick with free will and ditch the rest.<br>  <br>  "IF you believe what you want in the Gospel and disbelieve what you want.

ae06239e62818780ae57b9ae07468d3caa	Everyone who gets discouraged about Chinese (Mandarin) always freaks out over the tones. It is a hurdle, but it is really not that difficult to get over if you really want to. I'm taking Chinese this semester and I freaked out at the beginning because I couldn't discern the tones AT ALL while so many other people in my class seemed to pick it up much more easily. I have no problem with it now, though. So it can be done. And I wouldn't be so sure about the grammar - I have heard from more advanced students that the grammar gets more complex in the future because Chinese has so many inconsistencies.<br>  <br>  As for what I suggest, I don't really have any suggestions because I don't know what your goal is. Do you want to learn other languages for business purposes? Or do you just love learning languages? If it's the latter, I would just say to find one that you like because it sounds cool or for whatever reason. Maybe pick up a language because there are a lot of good foreign films spoken in that language or there are some great books written in that language that you want to read. I think Japanese is easily one of the coolest-sounding languages I have heard (after I got used to it). Italian is beautiful and while generally I don't like Russian I met this one girl in HS who did it justice. It has the potential to sound really cool.<br>  <br>  If you're learning languages for business purposes, I would recommend Mandarin.|`|Piw6xeiKaa	Nahuatl!!!! i wanna learn that language!|`|01NUrwfYaa	Ich empfehle, dass du Deutsh sprechen lernst.

We lost all our rights and england started to change the names of our towns to english names.<br>  <br>  You can still clearly see the effect of this on our country , because a lot of people lost the language and so now lots of people dont speak welsh and towns have some english names and we still arnt independent and only get to make small decisions for ourselves.<br>  <br>  Thats why , because of how they treated us in the past.<br>  <br>  i imagen itll go on like this until we do recover fully.<br>  <br>  Credit to us for keeping the welsh language alive though , considering what they did to us.|`|HIav9sVuaa	i dont know but ive never experienced it i have a lot of welsh friends and there really friendly but you always get someone anywhere you go thats predujiced not just wales its expected<br>  <br>  <br>  ENGLAND RULES!!!|`|c9469a0c25b4c415d92edc506376c2afaa	I hear more prejudices from the English, than the Welsh. <br>  I don't know of any against the engerlsih.|`|oMF6bXCZaa	I was born in Wales and lived most of my life in England.

XUrgcOMDaa	This story is my mother's and aunt's, but they've told me this one throughout my childhood:<br>  <br>  When my mother first turned 16 (in 1976) and got her driver's license, she was very eager to drive, so she and my aunt Sue took my grandpa's truck into town.  This was September, in Michigan, and the weather was still warm.  <br>  <br>  They pulled onto the highway and about a half a mile down the road they saw this shiny black old fashioned car come racing up behind them in the rearview mirror.  My mother, being a new driver, got a little nervous at this aggressive motorist, and so slowed down the truck.  The car was very aggressive, and didn't pass them right away, instead swerving all over the lane behind them as if impatient to pass them and angry that the truck was in its way.  <br>  <br>  This, of course, made my mother even more nervous, so she slowed down even more and started to pull off the road to let the car pass.  Finally it did pass, and as it was alongside them, they looked over at this crazy driver and it was a woman with jet-black hair, chalk-white skin, and sockets for eyes.  She wasn't looking at the road at all; she was looking directly at them and was grinning terribly.<br>  <br>  When the car finished passing, it aggressively veered back over into their lane, and my mother and aunt observed that there was no license plate, and that there were icicles hanging off the back of it.|`|797JPZuKaa	A while back when I was about 13 years old, I was alone in my house talking to my friend, we were talking for a while until she had to go, I was sitting down for a bit when I heard my sisters favorite song faintly playing in the back ground, I hadn't realized she was back, so I went to her room to say hi. Well once I got to her door I knocked on it then opened it, the music instantly cut off, and I saw a large black shadow stand all the way up to the cieling, and in my sisters voice it said  "Hey, Seth." I ran downstairs and out the door to the front-yard, and I saw my sister pull-up and park the car. True story, still scares me to think about it today.|`|ybbYpD1Yaa	One of my favorites:<br>  <br>  "A man went to a hotel and walked up to the front desk to check in. The woman at the desk gave him his key and told him that on the way to his room, there was a door with no number that was locked and no one was allowed in there. Especially no one should look inside the room, under any circumstances. So he followed the instructions of the woman at the front desk, going straight to his room, and going to bed.<br>  <br>  The next night his curiosity would not leave him alone about the room with no number on the door. He walked down the hall to the door and tried the handle. Sure enough it was locked. He bent down and looked through the wide keyhole. Cold air passed through it, chilling his eye. What he saw was a hotel bedroom, like his, and in the corner was a woman whose skin was completely white. She was leaning her head against the wall, facing away from the door. He stared in confusion for a while. He almost knocked on the door, out of curiosity, but decided not to.<br>  <br>  This disinclination saved his life. He crept away from the door and walked back to his room. The next day, he returned to the door and looked through the wide keyhole. This time, all he saw was redness. He couldn't make anything out besides a distinct red color, unmoving. Perhaps the inhabitants of the room knew he was spying the night before, and had blocked the keyhole with something red.<br>  <br>  At this point he decided to consult the woman at the front desk for more information. She sighed and said, "Did you look through the keyhole?" The man told her that he had and she said, "Well, I might as well tell you the story. A long time ago, a man murdered his wife in that room, and her ghost haunts it. But these people were not ordinary. They were white all over, except for their eyes, which were red."
1ef686c0598e504e901a03134164b07faa	Ma'am. I find it to be less offensive even though I am only 17. When someone addresses me as "Hon" I feel rather violated. They may as well have walked up and said "Sweet Cheeks" or something else. I don't know why but that came to mind. Hon is something reserved for family, significant others, and that waitress at the diner. If I had the option it would be "Miss". It is respectful and age-appropriate.|`|uYz8ipcJaa	Ma'am!!  Or Miss.<br>  I'm 16. I go to college classes. I work a few jobs and two is self-run. I am a commissioned artist.  In those situations I hate being considered young and immature.  Hon sounds young, unprofessional and informal.  I feel it makes the woman sound inferior or dependent, too.<br>  I don't think Ma'am sounds so old, because a few centuries ago the wealthy addressed young women of notable status "Ma'am" also.  And Ma'am sounds more formal.|`|AA10344737	If it is a waitress in a casual diner, hon is ok.<br>  <br>  Any other circumstance, ma'am is the correct way to address a woman (unless the woman is a teenager or younger and then it is 'Miss").|`|nrXCCf76aa	Neither. Call me "Short person" b/c I know I'm short and it doesn't bother me-- it's all good.

Hon doesn't sound right from a stranger...|`|jnAAKCjHaa	Ma'am.  <br>  Hon implies endearment, and no stranger should be endeared to you.|`|oQ5oKILHaa	Ma'am for sure. Unless its at the diner :) Then I'll let it slide.|`|KjVKNjwNaa	hon..even though im 36..i still feel being called ma'am makes me older!|`|2VGu8sr8aa	I prefer Hon, but that's probably because of my age.

But really, I prefer "younger" nicknames because, I'm still fairly young.|`|uK00g16laa	Ma'am Maybe it is just because I am from the south though thats just common respect i guess.|`|3S5tpyEUaa	ma'am because being called hon by a complete stranger is just awkward and weird|`|280jfiLOaa	well i don't like to be called hon by my mom so i wood say ma'am|`|SsfnitjXaa	Never Hon!|`|25d446cf62508e0d3ad669755f76bfb8aa	Being from Texas, I get called both by complete strangers and the only time it bothers me is if it's a man calling me "Hon" and I get the impression he's a bit of a pig. Used in a nice way, I don't mind being called either and have no preference for one or the other.|`|LGidAYDwaa	Ma'am, definitely. I used to work as a vendor and spent my days in home improvement stores.  Men would come up to me and call me "sweetheart", "hon", etc. And it's worse when it's a gal. It's used as a "I'm better than you are, so I'm putting you in your place" kind of thing.|`|7gH7sgi6aa	According to the Big Book of Etiquette Ma'am is more appropriate.

Is there a decision on where a wild seed will drop to the ground to sprout? No. We have a perceived position of stars to make constellations. It's just connect the dots. But from where clusters of stars form, it's due to gravity, dark matter and dark energy. All life on Earth was done through natural processes. <br>  <br>  If people needed something, humans or hominids would invent it filling that need. As for faith healing, do you have any, scientific proof that they were actually healed?

The bottom line is that if their is a god its not the Christian god or the others gods, humans are arrogant creatures that once thought the universe revolved around them and organized religion is a testament to that arrogance in which mankind claims to know and understand the will of a supreme being that is, if real beyond our comprehension.

The stars just happen to be where they are, there is no exact positions, people just like to find shapes in them. Those "weird" looking animals aren't at all "weird," just different from what you would imagine having as a pet, no other animals matter unless you own andcontrol them, huh? No proof of souls, feelings are actually instinct pretty much, every organism has "ideas," ideas how to hunt an animal, "ideas" how to make tools, etcetera. Those "miracles" are faux. If you mean pretty little flowers, you know you just called reproducing flowers wonderful, right? They're just doing whatever they need to survive. Perhaps they're gullible twits or they felt empty inside and decided to accept a fairytale. That's proof that it's physically impossible and made up by people. I won't accept because there is not enough proof for me. Then you're an idiot. What doesn't make sense is how we're all still alive if we all came from Adam and Eve. The mutations by now probably would've killed us. Why do you think white tigers are so rare? Inbred morons. Alot of them died from mutations. From INBREEDING.|`|YLqVv7Lzaa	a) Prove that something decided to create the universe<br>  b) Simple probability.

You make so many valid points. But this is where people are lost. Has the possibility of coexistence ever came into any ones' mind? Here we have "God" People look at this "God" as one of us. That we are the mortal replica of His Holiness. Really? That doesn't strick you as fantasy? Suppose this: We "KNOW" without a doubt that there is "Energy". Its prooven. Its evidance that we can see. As we speak a lab in Sweden is trying to re-create the Big Bang theory (in my opinion not very wise, but interesting none the less) It is prooven what happens to stars when they collide. Energy and other materials are released. Now I just had this discussion with my husband last night and asked him the same questions you ask here and now. How is it that a womans' body knows exactly when it is time to birth a child. How is it that we all have exactly what we need to survuve and that our bodies know how to kick into survival mode when it is in "danger". This can not be explained by any scientist. How it works yes, but why it is what it is, no. The bible, the stories, all fables. All fantasy. Stories made up by man trying to explain the unknown. Trying to put a face to the feelings that they were feeling.  What do I believe? I believe in spiritualism. I believe that the energy within us is where the power comes from. I believe that the soul is what started all of this. And by that I mean Energy. Why is it so hard to comprehend that Energy (the very thing that makes up our souls in my oppinion because it can't be prooven) was created by stars exploding and emitting gases and toxins and energy that ultimatly created US? Why is that hard to believe, yet you can believe that a man parted the red sea? A man built an arc and survived a flood? That a man was the child of this God? Why are those believable? I'll tell you why. Because humans are creatures of habit. Humans by nature do not do well with change. small changes yes, like oh I have to change jobs...but this????...much bigger. This is history that people do not want to mess with. Its culture. Its like the Declaration of Independance and the like...who wants to change the Laws that were made up by men living in a horrifically different time then we are living in now? Who wants to be the one to stand up and change what so many have believed for so many years??? People waste so much of their lives on this, without it, those people would be lost. Its sad. They were trained to believe a certain way and now with so much technology we can learn the truth...people can not deal with that. Why does the heart know to pump blood? Why does the body know when it is being attacked? WHo knows? I do believe in a higher Power...but its not in the same manner that everyone else believes. I believe in energy and souls. I believe the truth lies within ourselves and I also believe there are very few who can tap into this area of their subconscience...a fact: People use a very small percentage of their brains...whats the other percentage for? Ever wonder why we have Deja Vu? Maybe its because we already know whats going ot happen...just like maybe this man Jesus did. I don't doubt that a man named Jesus exhisted, but I really think that everything has been misinterpretted. Misunderstood, and well....misremembered ( had to through that in there if you know why that might be funny)|`|nkzUaRr8aa	Well what gives you the evidence that a big guy in the sky suddenly popped out of nowhere and thought 'hey let's create a whole galaxy and lots of strange beings'<br>  <br>  What you must try and get your head around is that nothing is made purely of decision. There is a positive and negative 'branch' affect to each possible outcome, and of these outcomes we were created. Evolution makes more sense than somebody waving a stick and demanding for a sea to part.<br>  <br>  "If there is no God, how can you all account for the earth’s breathable air and that this is the only planet that has the exact air we need"<br>  <br>  The reason you're alive and asking that question is because the atmosphere/air and everything else that makes Earth suitable for us is because we were designed FOR the planet, ever changing and evolving to adapt to the new climates and what not. Look back a few hundred years, we were physically smaller by some inches or so.<br>  Do you really think that 'GOD' suddenly thought that we needed to grow?<br>  <br>  <br>  You have to admit sometimes, there are just too many questions for us to understand and cope with. Let the other life-forms out there explain that there is not god, only higher beings (as in intelligence wise) I'm sure that out of billions of billions of planets, stars, and solar systems, that we're not the only living creatures.|`|rcPnnfmmaa	Try asking your questions one at a time.<br>  <br>  The first one you asked is called the first cause problem. It's a very, very old problem. Before it was called first cause it was called the study of cosmogony.<br>  <br>  In most prechristian mythologies gods were the sons of other even older gods, and those gods too had a father, until you got to something that just sort of was. The Norse primal god was Búri, who was licked out of a solid block of ice by a cow of unknown origins. The Greek primal god was Gaia, who sprung from a chaotic mix of all the elements called Khaos.<br>  <br>  The Bible is odd because it does not tell this story. Where did God come from? No one knows.<br>  <br>  Where did that spark come from to start the Big Bang? No one knows that either.<br>  <br>  There are ideas that try to explain it but they really aren't better than Búri being formed out of ice by a cow. Maybe two older universes collided to ignite that spark, but when did those universes come into being? Maybe God existed outside of time forever and ever and just one day decided to do it, maybe it was the quantum uncertainty of absolute nothing, no one really knows.<br>  <br>  See also the turtles all the way down problem.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtles_all_the_way_down" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtles_all...</a>|`|pYomxgYfaa	It might not make sense to you, but it's closer to the truth than a man-written book.|`|CT265lQyaa	Don't you think that you should be asking a SCIENTIST these questions?<br>  Do I look like a f*cking scientist to you?<br>  Just because every single reasonable, non-delusional person out here doesn't know the secrets of the entire universe and every single thing that could possibly be known, does that make your f*cked up "belief" in imaginary things any more credible?<br>  I don't think so.<br>  It doesn't work that way.<br>  Better yet, why don't you ask YOURSELF these questions, and honestly seek a logical answer instead of just being lazy and stupid and saying "Oh, since I don't know the answer, then god did it".<br>  ____________________________<br>  <br>  "We make our world significant by the courage of our questions and by the depth of our answers."<br>  -Carl Sagan<br>  ____________________________<br>  <br>  "It has often and confidently been asserted, that man's origin can never be known.

d508e71226a169afed7ebfc7e78bbc5baa	The only way that I see you fixing this issue is to man up, Wait for the punk to come out to get party supplies and have a man to man talk mentioning that your not only yourself but your guns have asked to be cleaned and polished.  They are getting tired of the noise.  Maybe drop an alka seltzer in your mouth.  When he sees that you are foaming at the mouth and and you explaining the thing about your talking guns will sober a stoned person up in a heartbeat.  If all else fails, call the police when you smell the weed burning, let them know that you heard a lady upstairs screaming that he was hurting her and being to rough.  They will make up the rest when they find drugs in his apt.  They will always come to the aid of a female when they think that they are being attacked, if they come back and say they didn't find any females in the apt say that it might have been on the noise that he was playing|`|LGidAYDwaa	Gee, sounds exactly like my old neighbor!  Write a letter to the management complaining about the noise issue. Let them know it's affecting your quality of life, and you want to move to another unit. You can also mention the drug use if you want. (That is the perfect excuse they can use to kick out the tenant, if he gets caught.) Usually, when a good tenant complains and threatens to leave, they finally get the idea that you're not going to put up with that kind of behavior any more.  You may even want to send the letter certified. I guess it depends on how angry you are about being ignored.|`|7gH7sgi6aa	If calling the leasing office doesn't work everyday then go over there everyday.  And then start typing letters that you are keeping copies of, and let them know you are keeping copies of them.  After you have sent out the first letter, and you are sure they have received it, and have had time to deal with it...then simply call the police if it is so loud that is disturbing you.  Remember that people can play music up until 10pm, but it must not disturb others.  I know that is what he is going to use as an excuse.  If he is indeed getting high, and the police come, he will be busted for that too.  Doing it in the proper manner makes a big difference.  Good luck.<br>  Peace, Love & Happiness|`|DZCFD0p2aa	what I used to do was I found out where the electric panel was and I would go and trip the breaker for their apartment and then run like hell.

Hp4CMYPXaa	u probably are bi-sexual if your also attracted to men, but there really is nothing wrong with that. think of it as giving you more options.|`|WNWKDw4uaa	Does it matter? Yes, I guess you're gay.|`|WxoZrTPlaa	It sounds like you are bi-sexual; but that is beside the point.  What you're doing is cheating on your boyfriend.  All couples (straight or gay) face these issues.  We find another person attractive.  Do we act on it or remain faithful to our partner.  If you love your boyfriend and want to maintain your family, you need to stay away from this girl.  I mean think about it.  How would you feel if your boyfriend were talking to another girl, kissing another girl, touching another girl?  Same thing.  So, whether or not you're straight or bi (which is totally fine), you are cheating.  Deal with that issue first, then decide what you want to do.|`|k9gp11PMaa	Ur probably bisexual|`|MT1498npaa	You're in the confusing stage that most gay/bisexual people go through, which is finding out who you really are, as for your sexual orientation. I'm not positive, but to me, you might be bisexual. It takes time to realize, but it'll come. Don't be frustrated too much, just be patient.|`|W545hqrpaa	Take it slow because she is willing to leave her boyfriend. Are u willing to do the same. If not, u need to let her know that u like what's going on, but u can't make any promises. Understanding is the best thing in the world. And if she makes u all tingly and warm on the inside, you are probably bi. Have fun, but make sure u r both on the same page. Think about your baby and your boyfriend.
1286cbbdaec7b88444188ebc8781d6d6aa	You are confusing opportunity with tendency<br>  <br>  You put someone out in the wilderness alone and they cannot do evil against anyone else, that does not mean that the person is "good".  That means that they are isolated.  Put that person back into civilization and their old instincts will kick back in:  greed, lust, etc.<br>  <br>  It is inaccurate try to blame the problems of humanity on society since society is created by humanity.  If there are any flaws in society, it is because those flaws are in teh humans that make it up|`|FDVuAiHOaa	Sin is a Christian construct.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	But this is not true to human nature at all.<br>  <br>  Everybody has conscience. As St Augustine says : If you steal from a thief, he counts it as wrong. If you commit adultery with an adulterer's spouse, he counts it as wrong. If you kill the relative of a murderer, he counts it as wrong. <br>  <br>  Society is the result and not the cause !! Like the early monks in the Egyptian desert, the person on his own knows of sin MORE than anybody else. And Sloth and pride are often pointed out in the early solitaries !!! Read about them. Pride is what you think of yourself in your heart. It requires nobody else. Aren't Adam and Eve almost exactly what you are talking about, except it is two but only two. And that story is so natural that I've never heard anybody call it unreal. They may say something about the snake but if they have children or they know their own hearts they see themselves in the story.<br>  <br>  You are saying that people are naturally good and to sustain that crazy idea you have to say that society is bad but what came first ??????<br>  <br>  Your reasoning strikes me as insane...|`|dDMOJWxwaa	For the natural man is an enemy to God, and has been from the fall of Adam, and will be, forever and ever, unless he yields to the enticings of the Holy Spirit, and putteth off the natural man and becometh a saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord, and becometh as a child, submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love, willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon him, even as a child doth submit to his father.|`|MrLdBraoaa	You can curse god for putting you in that situation. Also, say that person builds a shelter. They would be proud and say "Look what I have done." which is pride. It was god that gave you hands, feet, energy, and the will to live.|`|uurTX7POaa	why address your rant exclusively to Christians ?|`|ridu0Rtwaa	Simple answer is they are not!!<br>  <br>  Research shows that the reason humans struggle with emotion to find equitable solutions is pinpointed the region of the brain called the insular cortex, or insula, which is also the seat of emotional reactions.<br>  <br>  The fact that the brain has such a robust response to unfairness shows that sensing unfairness is a basic evolved capacity. <br>  <br>  The emotional response to unfairness pushes people from extreme inequity and drives them to be fair. This observation shows our basic impulse to be fair isn't a complicated thing that we learn.<br>  <br>  It therefore fully illustrates that all humans have morals controlled by the brain and that Christians are entirely wrong to try and claim morals as their own!!!!<br>  <br>  So christians find a way around that!!<br>  <br>  Government statistics show that christians are vastly over represented in prisons for sexual, violent and fraudulent crime!!<br>  <br>  The Catholic church is paying millions in compensation for the sex/pedophile crimes of their priests alone!!<br>  <br>  Christians are vastly over represented in the divorce courts!!<br>  <br>  Christians invented the concept of sin and then the idea that you could sin, ask forgiveness, get pardoned and start with a clean sheet!!<br>  <br>  So no surprise that they are so expert at it is it?!!!|`|uBW5xrK1aa	on the eight day god got bored so he made people evil and created satan, just like someone who cuts themselves. LOL.<br>  <br>  What Is Cutting?<br>  <br>  Injuring yourself on purpose by making scratches or cuts on your body with a sharp object — enough to break the skin and make it bleed — is called cutting. Cutting is a type of self-injury.|`|Wn64Oxxyaa	I completely agree.|`|907eccf187a1d01eb469d6a0a106913eaa	I'm a cynic regardless of my religious affiliation.<br>  <br>  I reserve judgment on what counts as "sin" per se, but as far as good and evil I think we are all inherently conscientious, and deviate from good.  just a propensity of the human condition.<br>  <br>  <br>   <br>  "Wouldn't it make more sense that all humans are naturally good, except for when they are corrupted by society?"<br>  so how exactly did society become corrupt?  it is comprised of people after all.  this is a little bit circular.<br>  if people are naturally good, they should be able to be born into society and be good.  society wouldn't BE corrupt.  there wouldn't be racism, intolerance, hatred, jealousy, any of that in society to begin with.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  "Christianity came after society, though. Humans were not Christians as hunter-gatherers."<br>  I don't think many Christians say sin only began existing after Jesus was born... most Christians would say sin has been around since the dawn of mankind.  the actions that many Christians say are sin- murder, deceit, adultery etc. certainly have been around long before Christ.<br>  <br>  <br>  "But sin wasn't a concept considered until Christianity."<br>  (this is according to most Christians): <br>  again, most Christians would say sin has been around since the dawn of mankind.  The actions that many Christians say are sin- murder, deceit, adultery etc. certainly have been around long before Christ.<br>  The existence of sin itself is independent of whether it is recognized.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Now, "Why would sin exist even when there is no way for us to be redeemed from it (i.e. before Christ)?"<br>  I think that's a great question.
FDVuAiHOaa	Exactly.  And atheists do not assert anything.  they are merely denying your assertion, therefore the only one to shoulder the burden of proof is you.  Please study some logic before assuming that you are more logical and rational than they are.<br>  <br>  "Atheists assert that God doesn't exist."  That is not true.  Atheists just don't claim anything about deities.  I know what you're trying to get at, but it's not the same thing, no matter how much you want it to be.|`|ridu0Rtwaa	Then why do you run away from the evidence real and provable time after time?!!!<br>  <br>  In simple terms academia states that in the absence of proof of the existence of something it must be deemed not to exist until verifiable proof is found - thus god is held not to exist pending some sort of verifiable evidence.<br>  <br>  There is not one single mention of Jesus in the entire Roman record - that is right - not one!!! At the same time as he was supposed to have been around there were a number of Jews claiming to be the messiah - all of whom are well recorded!!<br>  <br>  He was supposed to have been a huge problem to the Romans and produced wonderful miracles but still not one contemporary record?<br>  <br>  Even the bible mentions of him like all other references were not written until many years after his supposed death!!<br>   <br>  Pilot is recorded in the Roman record as a somewhat lack luster man but no mention of a Jesus, a trial or crucifixion that would surely have been used to make him look brighter!!<br>  <br>  At best he was an amalgam of those others!!<br>  <br>  <br>  The Roman Emperor Constantine produced the bible and he was a pagan not god!!!   He also organized Christianity into the Holly Roman Catholic Church!!  Not in Israel or any of the countries of supposed origin but entirely Italian!!<br>  <br>  Not one word of it is contemporary with the period and was not written until many years after the period the story is set in!!<br>  <br>  What a wonder full disinformation and deception campaign he waged against his Christian enemies - so good in fact that Christians are still following the deception to this day!!!<br>  <br>  When you can face the truth please try again!!|`|EMVT2xjEaa	Yes<br>  <br>  And it lies on the person making the claim<br>  <br>  People make the claim a god exists, therefore they must prove it<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  Actually, atheists reject theists notion that a god does exist. Most atheists look at the evidence, and conclude one does not exist.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  Same way if I said I have 8 purple elephants in my garage. I have no "proof" that you find persuasive, but you must prove to me they aren't there<br>  <br>  It isn't your job to disprove they exist, it is my job to prove they exist|`|C1SOqQSkaa	Yeees?

It wouldn't be the duty of those who didn't believe me to find it.|`|YAoSgET5aa	I don't need to prove sh*t to you, because i have what many would call a belief in the non-existance of "gods" and or "deities".

The best solution is to keep your beliefs in your home and in your church...you bring all that talking snakes and virgin births and jesus is his own dad out into the public and YOU are the one who needs to prove it with more than just your flapping lips...me I simply deny your beliefs are correct simply because YOU CANNOT PROVE THEM TO BE CORRECT.<br>  <br>  Like someone else pointed out...if I say that Aliens are on earth planning to destroy humans then it is up to ME to show you proof or would you just accept my flapping lips as proof and then start telling your friends and family to watch out for the aliens followed by starting preparations for war with Aliens?<br>  <br>  But hey...you still got your faith right? Hmmmm you ever wonder why it is you need faith to begin with??? lol|`|YLqVv7Lzaa	You say god exists<br>  <br>  I say I don't believe that it does<br>  <br>  You are making the positive claim (that god exists)<br>  <br>  I am making a negative statement (that I don't think it does)<br>  <br>  Therefore the burden of proof lies with you.|`|7K2HVodhaa	Exactly. Burden of proof rests on whoever makes an assertion. You say there is a god, onus is on you.|`|LHljEdcUaa	And using logic to you means believing that women came from a rib? that a snake can talk? huh... that doesn't sound logical to me.|`|jR8mclWIaa	I don't assert anything, I just deny your assertion that god exist.|`|AA11688085	are you sure you know what atheist means?<br>  <br>  <br>  extraordinary claims need extraordinary evidence.  no child comes out of the womb believing in god- that nonsense is drilled in by adults.<br>  <br>  the same adults who cannot provide a shred of evidence for their outlandish claims<br>  <br>  <br>  edit: "We try to provide support for our claim, but many refuse to listen."<br>  <br>  are you sure you know what "support" means?  <br>  <br>  <br>  look up the word "logic" as well- your argument has more holes than a butterfly net|`|pYomxgYfaa	Religion logical?

Gw1LLzDgaa	Several things:<br>  <br>  Firstly -- NO you should not consider suicide -- if you are having suicidal ideation, you should seek help from a therapist immediately.<br>  <br>  Secondly -- If there is a deity, s/he loves you and does not judge you, nor is s/he against you.<br>  <br>  Thirdly -- Genetics, not fate or deity play a large role in who we are as people.  Beyond that, certain decisions we make can have an effect (if we feel badly so we eat too much, we have made  a decision -- the fat that follows is OUR choice, whether we really want it there or not.)<br>  <br>  Fourthly -- The plastic surgery can change your appearance, but not the person you are. None of the penis growth formulas work.  They are intended to prey on people who have low self esteem -- and that idea works for them, even as their products do not work for you.<br>  <br>  Solution:  Start by loving yourself and discarding any hateful ideas you have about deity or what deity (god [ dess ] or whatever) wants from you or expects from you.  Love yourself, love everyone else and be full of love and help.  If you are fat, lose weight until you are thin.  See a therapist, dump the depression.  Take a deep breath and make a decision about what you want to look like -- if that requires plastic surgery then have it.  Be aware that 90% of adult men have penises between 4.5 and 7 inches when erect.

IAXhu2tuaa	Belief and dis-belief are inseparable. Those who profess a belief are simply dis-believing something else, like death. They are not so much people of faith, as they are people of fear. The fear of death is the only true reason for the existence of religion.

AA11156135	perpetuating gender norms is not a problem. Anybody that says so, well then, - has a problem.<br>  <br>  But you'll hear about the fascism from the liberals. They demand that you think 'openly' and don't contradict their PC. statements. Your example above is just one more flaw in their left-leaning premise.|`|oVeGMNsLaa	Probably because we know that being gay, you can still be happy, healthy, and live a full and wonderful life, no problems.  All the pain of being gay comes from our heteronormative world, feeling different, and being harassed, alienated and even the victim of violence.  If you change the world's attitude, there is no problem with being gay.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, when you're trans, unless you are able to live your life and present your gender the way you want to, you will be miserable.  There is no way to be happy in the body and gender expectations you were born into when you're trans.  The problems from being trans DON'T come from the outside world; they come from inside you.  Transsexuality and gender dysphoria are real conditions.|`|NsLtN7oLaa	First of all, transsexuals do not hate their bodies.<br>  If you were born with some sort of an abnormality,<br>  like say a third arm that didn't work, and none of<br>  your clothes would fit, and people laughed at you,<br>  and doctors said they could remove the defective<br>  appendage, what's wrong with that ? It's a step<br>  towards a better life.<br>  <br>  Those are decisions you don't face and maybe<br>  don't understand all that well just yet. I'm sure<br>  if you think more about it, you will realize what<br>  I mean.<br>  <br>  As to comparing it to being gay, it's just not the<br>  same thing. Gay is a sexual preference. Being<br>  trans is a gender identity issue. It's quite different<br>  and I have always wondered if it was a good idea<br>  to lump us together and call us a GLBT community.<br>  Actually I like the GLB people but our issues are<br>  totally different than theirs.

It makes no more sense to describe this treatment as 'self-hate than it does to describe a diabetic taking insulin as 'self-hate'.<br>  <br>  "Gay to straight transitions" are attempts to alter a person's core identity. It's neither proven,nor effective; in fact, all the medical evidence shows it to be ineffective, and usually harmful to the person concerned.<br>  <br>  "don't transsexual persons perpetuate gender norms basing their identity in the status quo?"<br>  <br>  We don't 'base our identity' in anything; it simply is what it is.|`|65QqZBnjaa	I already answered this yesterday:<br>  <br>  You are confused and your premise is false.<br>  <br>  You premise seems to hinge on the belief that a transsexual person "changing genders". That is FALSE. Gender identity is inborn and unchangeable. Because the mind cannot be changed, transsexual people change their bodies to match their identity.<br>  <br>  Transsexual people don't change genders, that's impossible, so this comparison to conversion (reparative) therapy is FALSE.<br>  <br>  <br>  There is NO contradiction.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  To answer the question you added after the fact yesterday:<br>  <br>  The idea that gender is a 100% social construct is FALSE.  It was disproven by the Reimer case.  Dr Money's theory of people being born a "blank slate" was shattered.  Read this section on Gender Basics:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://ai.eecs.umich.edu/people/conway/TS/TS.html#anchor107763" rel="nofollow">http://ai.eecs.umich.edu/people/conway/T...</a><br>  <br>  Gender identity is inborn and unchangeable.  Socialization only builds (or clashes in the case of a transsexual person) on what has already been programmed into the brain prenatally.<br>  <br>  <br>  In the same vein sexual orientation is also prenatally imprinted.  As a result BOTH are born the way they are and there is NO contradiction!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Edit:  And why do you focus on transsexual women?  Maybe you see them as a "cure" for homosexuality like Iran?  What about transsexual men?<br>  <br>  It's not a matter of self-hate, it's a matter of GENDER IDENTITY.|`|le9ZROs5aa	Oh I don't perpetuate gender norms at all. I'm bi (prefer women) I work in a male dominated field and I am very independent and take care of myself. I love to play sports get dirty. I can't remember the last time I wore a dress. I'm anything but a stereotype of femininity. <br>  <br>  By your logic it would be wrong for someone who is born blind or deaf to receive a cure for their condition. I'm pretty sure they hate being blind or deaf too. We have a congenital birth defect same as people who are born blind or deaf.|`|aWPmvPpfaa	the comparison is silly. anyway i don't know too many gay people that go straight, unless they were straight to begin with and just experimented, or chose not to give in to their feelings becuase of religious guilt.<br>  <br>  transexuals were born transexual.|`|3OZgcntfaa	My transition is not a conforming to heteronormality... and it's sure as heck not a form of self-hate. It's probably the best example of self-love in action there is.<br>  <br>  A person who is trans is modifying their body so they can live happily in it. A person who is homosexual cannot modify their orientation to live happily, it doesn't work that way. <br>  <br>  I'm also certain I don't perpetuate any sort of gender norm by transitioning. No matter how you slice my gender, I don't fall in the binary so that blows that concept right out.<br>  <br>  Keep thinking out the issues pal, you're gonna have a hard time comparing apples to light bulbs.|`|InsBAcktaa	You are comparing apples and oranges. <br>  <br>  Homosexuality is a sexual preference and it has very little to do with outward expression.  There is not a treatment for it but self-identity therapy helps with acceptance.<br>  <br>   Transsexuality is about brain gender vs body.  It is science that a "female" brain which developes with low testosterone exists in male bodies.  Treatment cannot change the brain, but endocrinologists and plastic surgeons can alter the body to fit the mind.<br>  <br>  Biological sex, Chromasomal sex, Sexual orientation, Gender identity, Brain Gender, and Gender expression all mean different things.  Sometimes they all line up which is what society considers normal.  But more often one or more do not, and you have a variant personality.<br>  <br>  Personally I'll hang with the variants over the white bread folk any day.<br>  <br>  My world has rainbows...   society just night or day.|`|i1MbaUhUaa	I would say that they are two completely different things as one involves changing your body so that you are unrecognizble because you are unhappy with the way God has made you.  <br>  If you could answer my q it would be most appreciated<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AiDGO5Z6GiqCXmABIvd857Lsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090226132002AAFvOqW">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|LEkeqGrlaa	transgender is trying to change to what you really feel like u were meant to be.

mGfCY4Ytaa	because they realized that they didn't like the opposite sex. like i was straight in middle school and early high school but when the pressure was on for me to do more than just kissing, I realized that I was not sexually attracted to boys in the first place. so then I guess you could say I turned gay. but i didn't "turn" really I was gay all along, I just didn't realize it until I was pressured in to heterosexual sex.<br>  <br>  its like this: how do you know that you don't like a certain kind of food until you try it? you try it, then you find out you don't like it, and you never eat it again.
KqiiT1WSaa	lol<br>  <br>  To answer your question i would do (C)<br>  <br>  I would move the girl away from me, ask her "who is bothering you and WHY?" (lol) then i would go up to the people who are bothering her and ask if this situation is true (the girl will be present so that I can see if she is telling the truth or not) If she is, I will tell the people to back off and don't harass her, then once it is safe (i.e. they are gone) I will tell her to get lost. If she was lying I will make sure it is safe for her to go home alone then i will give her a telling off and then tell her to get lost)|`|ILc1XIPraa	I think a brother should do it , if she asked for help .

bjJZc4Hxaa	he was crying cause he was bored to tears by watching that crap|`|dmCyY2SKaa	Yeah, boys do cry. I know because I am a bit boy-ish when it comes to crying. I never cry in front of people and I try to avoid crying, even if I have to choke back tears. I figure, this isn't worth me crying over, I'm not going to cry, it doesn't deserve my tears. I feel pathetic when I cry. The most humiliating thing is crying in front of someone.|`|jHWEEZmCaa	i will not cry, unless you hit me hard|`|msgHpgteaa	Of course didnt you know? boys dont have tear ducts, they just piss out all of the liquid inside them or alternatively drool it out when they see a hot woman.

Do you think you can do something on your own, without the help of Jesus/ Holy Spirit?? Dont let the catholic church burden you with its paganistic non sense. Read the bible, pick up your Cross daily, and follow Christ, not the church.
16EYP0Xiaa	I think it depends on the context.<br>  <br>  For example, if you went to the funeral of someone you considered a scum-sucking dirtbag, would it help matters to tell his wife or parents that?  I wouldn't, it's not going to make anyone feel better and it doesn't 'resolve' anything [because those people didn't 'do' what the dirtbag did, they probably know well enough how he was.]<br>  <br>  However if you said something like "I know he had a pretty rough time and just did the best he could".....it might be different than what you would like to say, but considering the circumstances, it would be better than being brutally honest.|`|Xa39FlV0aa	I think it depends on the person, and the truth. My mom,,,, I lie to, because she doesn't want the truth, she just wants comfort. My sister, I alwas tell the truth, because she can take it. She knows if she doesn't want to know, she doesn't ask.
59Wg2cI3aa	In all too many cases, not soon enough.|`|AAgX0SDcaa	I have to wonder about that when I am watching videos on You Tube. I was watching the one where the man had been using the bathroom out in a pasture and a male donkey came up and was trying to get him, he was trying to hold up his pants and run every which way trying to escape and someone is holding a cam the whole time. He could have gotten killed or at least hurt badly. Seemed to me very sadistic not to have distracted the donkey away from him.|`|g0gMQUCVaa	I have always wondered the same thing and came to the conclusion that some don't.

Only then, when they are also a victim well they understand that they are beholden and no longer the beholder. Many will run and a few who possess character will assist those who also possess character.  When you build it is best to start with a new and strong foundation.<br>     The power of the media to be destructive or to create is limitless. It must be operated and controlled by people of character to be of any value.|`|Dmaahsc3aa	You got me !!!  Some accidents may happen too fast for them to do anything. . . or maybe they can't do anything. . . I think of 9/11 when the second plane hit. . . several people recorded it, but were impossible to do anything about it. . . Maybe some think of the monetary value or the fame in being able to capture something fantastic. . . I would be dropping the camera and going to the rescue if I could. . . I am not one to freeze up with fear. . .|`|XVZMXBwNaa	Are you kidding, and give up all those big bucks for recording the major tragedy!!! The have been only a few occasions that I have seen maybe on the news where a cameraman put the camera down and came to the rescue of someone in peril. The only case I could think of, is if the photographer can not get too the site but can only film what is about to happen. Just because they are recording something, does not necessarily mean they are right at the exact spot where it is happening.|`|y4SUDnpaaa	One of my pet peeves is when the media  sticks a microphone in someone's face who's just suffered a tragedy. I have heard them ask the most asinine questions like............  tell us how you feel about your son being murdered, do you think they will find your missing child alive, what were your thoughts when you were being run down by a bus. As for the cameramen why don't they call 911?  Everyone and their brother have cell phones now. Awhile back I saw on the news that a man was being attacked by another man with a chainsaw. It was in a crowed subway tunnel and everyone just kept walking. Obviously no one would interfere with a man with a chain saw, I understand that, but only one  person dialed 911.|`|b3h0ovgRaa	Sometimes the camera man has no choice depending on the situation that is happening. If he or she tries to interfere they them selves could be hurt or killed, so they just take pictures. I wonder if maybe after they get their picture if they might not be overcome with guilt. Even a little?    Poppy|`|ZCh0OHuhaa	I often wonder how someone can stand there and film some of these "funny videos" that really could have turned into a tragedy.<br>  Like these very small children on motor bikes.

tSCWgV2taa	military families,  poorer families because armed services provide scholarships, though there are exceptions of course
8OREBeRdaa	I didn't hear about this until this I read this question.  I then went to the article and read up on it. <br>  <br>  I think the parents need to be hit up side the head with an artificial arm!<br>  This is absolutely wretched. Parents need to take the time to educate their children that it's what is inside that counts. What next? We're not going to hire someone because they have 1 eye?  It's about the skills to do the job.  Children are so accepting for the most part.  If one child feels uncomfortable then parents need to exercise patience and talk to the child as to why?<br>  <br>  This is just another example of how our society is in the cesspool.  I think the parents that complain should be forced to perform some service for the War Amps kids or conduct community fundraising for amputees.  That way the entire family can learn to be more accepting.  This is so tragic.|`|1BXHUjqIaa	I saw that on the news this morning. Children are so accepting - they'd just ask why the woman had one arm and then just move on. It's the adults that are scared.<br>  <br>  And I'd like to ask those parents if they think only certain types of people should be on television. We should be inclusive and teach that to our children.|`|j2VDYbeoaa	I had not heard about that, but I have to question the ability of these people to be parents. What are they teaching their children??|`|9yJdY4s0aa	lame and uptight|`|cctkaS9qaa	she was a fool....  you shouldn't hide the whole world from the next generation.  let them immerse in it freely.  I think kids should be talking about the world, not just who won the grammys, or who wore what dress -_-|`|Jd91RxNKaa	I'm sorry but that's just not cool at all. Most people if not me especially (which I am) should be questioning the parents on their parenting abilities.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	I think it's wrong, it is short sighted and teaches the kids a very bad example of intolerance for anyone different, it is also important for those parents to realize there are many kids missing limbs and this woman is a great ideal for them, a very positive image of themselves. Those parents need a reality check.|`|kZRTekoJaa	wow. i haven't heard about this. people make me so mad.<br>  if a child is scared by someone who is different in any way that is just natural depending on the age, but the parent's should be more open minded and less rude. just b/c someone is missing an arm doesn't mean they should be hidden from all children or the general public.<br>  if my kids were scared by someone who looked different i would simply explain to them that people are different, and there's nothing to be afraid of. and i have a 1 and 3 year old so they would be more likely to be afraid then an older child. but still, i don't think they would be b/c me and their dad don't treat "different" people as something to be afraid of.<br>  <br>  i think the parents need to reevaluate the way the speak about other people and keep any rude hurtful comments to themselves.
DJMPQlFDaa	Americans are to stupid to protect ourselves. In stead of installing fire sprinkler systems inside our homes like businesses do we spend money on electronics, cars, and other wants. We insure our houses and if a fire does occur we go to red cross for assistance and our insurance carrier. Hell we get more money if the house burns down then if it stays standing. Do you understand what I am saying. Why protect ourselves when there is money to be made by donations from kind strangers and government assistance and insurance.<br>  <br>  Take is another reason we should all have guns. If there was no police if you broke into my house (in the event of no police I would have alarm systems) You'd be shot and dead. What mine is mine. I never did learn how to share well with others. Kids were mean to me. Oh well I am older now and have a few good friends.
BhzCW1rYaa	UFOs per se, have been visiting the earth since the dawn of our time, that is well documented in many ancient cultures..<br>  The big cover-up is because of mainstream religion, you don't have to be a genius to work out why they want it covered up, do you ??...<br>  The Church is the biggest money institution on the planet and the government, anyone's government will do all they can to keep a lid on it, even murder people who have absolute proof..<br>  I am an abductee and a very out spoken one at that, all the seminars I attend, I bring up this question... <br>  If you had 3 questions you could ask an ET, would one of them be about religion and God ?!?!, well you can bet that question has been asked and they didn't like the answer, so to keep all the sheep grazing in their perspective paddocks they cover it up vehemently... <br>  <br>  I will paste an answer I have already typed as it is far too long to repeat for me as I am a very slow typist...<br>  <br>  I have seen perhaps 30-40 UFOs, possibly more, as I stopped counting years ago.. I saw my first UFOs through my bedroom window when I was 8 years old, they were in formation and there were between 5-7 of them, and that night changed my world forever..<br>  When I woke up in the morning I shot straight upright in bed and felt different somehow, and I went and informed my mother that I was no longer going to Sunday School as I no longer believed in any of it..We were not a religious family and my father had died, so that was that, I had no argument from my mother..<br>  Over the next X amount of years I searched for something that I believed in, and at age 13, I discovered Wicca and that felt right to me.. I tried to join a Coven, but at my age and the year being 1970, well, I was a minor and Wicca and Witchcraft was only whispered.. By age 20 I was a 3rd degree Wiccan Priest..<br>  Back to the UFOs, I spent many years as a Diamond Driller in the outback of Australia and I saw may unexplained things, both in the air and on the ground..In 1984 I saw a UFO on the ground, and the only reason I could see it as I was 40 feet in the air, up the mast of my Drill Rig doing a minor repair on night-shift.. I have a witness to this one as my off-sider saw it too..It would take me ages to explain all of that, so I will skip a few hours..When we knocked off at 5:00 AM, I grabbed a torch and a 6 pack of beer and went to have a look for it, and my off-sider said I was mad and no way was he coming with me..The next thing I remember is waltzing back into camp at about 11:00 AM, and I still had 5 beers left, no real memory as to where I had been for the last 6 hours, but I wanted to take the Toyota and go back and have another look, but the Boss said no, so I went to bed, that was in Sth Aust...<br>  About 3 months later I was Drilling in Western Aust, and I woke up about 4 -5 miles from camp on the track that lead to the homestead.. I was stark naked, no real idea where I was, and no idea of the time..I took a guess and walked off down the dirt road, with the moon high I could see OK..<br>  I spotted our camp at almost day-light and wandered in, much to the surprise of my work mates..<br>  I would like to say this, the country I was in was desert country, quite rocky and lots of spinifex, very prickley..I was unscathed, when I began my walk back to camp, I only hurt myself on the walk back, so how did I get to where I was in the first place ?? No I don't sleep walk, no drugs or beer were involved.. You see when they abduct you, you always have what we call "missing time", and they don't always put you back from where they took you... <br>  That is only 2 of my abductions, I am a multiple abductee, and would not have any idea as to how many times they have taken me, as you don't always remember the missing time..<br>  The last time they took me was about 4 months ago, as I was driving home from the City, as I still live in the bush..<br>  This is a first for me as far as I know, I have 4 hours missing time, and I woke up in my car parked on the side of the road on the wrong highway, to get to my town, as a matter of fact I was about 45-50 Kms from where I should have been..<br>  The clock in my car, was 4 hours slow and my trip meter didn't add up when I did the calculations the next day...<br>  <br>  The above events are true, and I have many more, and there are many I would not remember as well..<br>  One day I will go under hypnosis and have the last 43 years of my abductions put on tape or CD...<br>  I am 51 and they have taken me since I was 8, and my baby sister has confided in me, she thinks she has also been taken... Please take this seriously, they are here, and for whatever reason, they take us, millions of us share this experience, and I am not afraid of them, I don't think they mean us any harm, if they did, I think we would know by now..<br>  In Light...)O(|`|VAI6MtPIaa	I do believe in Ghosts because I am sensitive to them but for aliens I don't know. I've had experiences with Ghosts but not something that I am going to write here and be criticized for in front of little kids on y/a.

I also believe in aliens. Why I believe in spirits? One night, when both the moon and clouds were "out and about", something told me to look up at the moon, and there I saw a white snake blowing black fire. A while later, I had what I call a "twitching fit", then, a voice, not of mine, but from me, said "Follow the Path". I'm still trying to find out what it means... Aliens?

BhzCW1rYaa	What we call ghosts reside in the 4th dimension, which is the spirit world and we can't see into that world unless there is a portal or the veil between worlds is thin..<br>  All dimensions have a different vibration, we are surrounded by dimensions we cannot see, but sometimes we do get a glimpse into their world and sometimes they get a glimpse into our world; also remember our dimension is the only dimension where time is measured...<br>  <br>  I recently read about a ghost scream which was recorded in England; a team of paranormal researchers were conducting an investigation into a haunting and 3 or 4 women were together in a room when they were taken by surprise by the appearance of a ghost, so they screamed...<br>  The Ghost also must have been taken by surprise as it also screamed, which was recorded on their equipment..<br>  They had the recording analysed and the result was that the scream was not of human origin; so you see we can spook the spooks just like they spook us...<br>  <br>  About 1 km up the road from me is an old manse called St Cecilia, this is in Peterborough, Sth Aust...<br>  This old manse hosts 5 ghosts, and the most prominent is the ghost of one of the old Bishops who lived there in the 1870's..<br>  A friend of mine is a psychic medium and he has been on a couple of documentaries which concern haunted places in Australia, and he has been filmed there several times...<br>  I walk past St Cecilia's 4 times a week, mostly at around the 9ish PM mark, but sometimes much later on my fitness walk..<br>  I have personally seen the Bishop 3 times, up on the porch on the far left hand side of the the building...<br>  Every time I walk past the manse all the hairs stick up on the back of my neck and I have that feeling of being watched...<br>  Every-time I have seen the Bishop, he is looking directly at me and it sends a shiver straight up my spine..<br>  He knows my energy and I know his, I just hope he stays where he is, as I honestly believe that there is something a wee bit sinister about him...<br>  <br>  I will tell you what happened to me when I first moved into my cottage in the country..<br>  One night I got outta the shower and was drying myself in the lounge room and all of a sudden I was freezing cold; I was as cold as if I were naked and out in a blizzard...<br>  I found my winter sleeping clothes(trackie daks, thermal T-shirt and a wind-cheater) and my thick woolly Pancho and I was still shivering; the temperature in my lounge room was 26C so I should have been quite comfortable in just a pair of shorts; the entity had changed my body temperature...<br>  This happened on 3 separate occasions and I contacted a psychic medium mate of mine and we sent him to the light..<br>  He was an adolescent child who was just having a bit of fun, but that fun could have killed me as it is not healthy to be all rugged up in winter clothing etc when it is in fact really quite warm inside the house....<br>  I still have one entity, and he causes me no dramas at all...<br>  In Light... )O(|`|cLGVSuFqaa	ghosts do exist<br>  im not going to share my experience

One of the revelations which came to him was the verse of stoning. We read it and understood it.<br>  <br>  "The Messenger of God stoned and we stoned after him. I am concerned that if time goes on, someone may say, 'By God, we do not find the verse of stoning in the Book of God;' thus, the Muslims will deviate by neglecting a commandment the Almighty revealed. <br>  <br>  "Stoning is in the Book of God. It is the right punishment for a person who commits adultery if the required witnesses are available, or there was pregnancy without marriage or adultery is admitted."<br>  <br>  Again, we used to read in what we found in the Book of God:<br>  <br>  "Do not deny the fatherhood of your fathers in contempt because it is disbelief on your part to be ashamed of the fatherhood of your fathers."<br>  <br>  So Nasibis, tell us where has this verse on stoning gone? <br>  <br>  Al-Muttaqi 'Ali bin Husam al-Din in his book "Mukhtasar Kanz al-'Ummal" printed on the margin of Imam Ahmad's Musnad, Volume 2, page 2, in his hadith about chapter 33, said that Ibn Mardawayh reported that Hudhayfah said:<br>  <br>  'Umar said to me 'How many verses are contained in the chapter of al-Ahzab?' I said, '72 or 73 verses.' He said it was almost as long as the chapter of the Cow, which contains 287 verses, and in it there was the verse of stoning.<br>  <br>  The revered Sunni scholar al Hafidh Jalaladeen as Suyuti writes:<br>  <br>  "Hadhrath Umar said at the Saqifa that the Qur'an has 1,027,000 letters".<br>  "Tafsir al Itqan" by as Suyuti, page 88<br>  <br>  The present Qur'an has 267,033 letters. According to Hadhrath Umar's research the Qur'an should have approximately 90 parts. We should console the Nasibis at their heavy loss - having lost 60 parts of the Qur'an! They themselves advocate that anyone that says the Qur'an has verses missing is a Kaffir thus a verdict on Hadhrath Umar in the light of the above narration will suffice as the final nail in the coffin for them. Perhaps the Nasibis should stop passing fatwas on the Shi'a and focus on Hadhrath Umar! As the saying goes "Those living in glass houses should not throw stones".<br>  <br>  <br>  Abdullah ibne Umar's similar Fatwa that the Qur'an is incomplete<br>  <br>  <br>  Suyuti also records the following:<br>  <br>  "No one can proclaim that I have found the Qur'an complete because most of the Qur'an has been lost".<br>  "Tafsir Duure Manthur" as-Suyuti Volume 1 page 104<br>  <br>  Nasibis swiftly pass kufr on the Shi'a claiming that we believe that the Qur'an is incomplete, whilst they have traditions that suggest that the belief of Hadhrath Umar and his son. If anyone states that to declare tahreef in the Qur'an makes you a Kaffir then there exist many personalities who are accredited by them as Imams who believed in tahreef.<br>  <br>  <br>  The Nasibi Scholar Maulana Anwar Shah's Fatwa, that there is Tahreef in the Qur'an<br>  <br>  <br>  The famous Hadith scholar of the Deobandis Syed Anwar Shah Kashmiri in his recognised Ahl'ul Sunnah work "Fayz ul Bari" writes:<br>  <br>  "It is my analysis based on Sahih al-Bukhari that the Qur'an has tahreef with regards to words and this was an accredited to Hadhrath Uthman's party as an unintentional or intentional mistake".<br>  "Fayz ul Bari" Anwar Shah page 395 Volume 3 under the Chapter "As Shahadath"|`|0NXdjyo2aa	The leader of this ummah is Prophet Muhammad ( peace be up on him ).|`|pRDKYYV5aa	They are who they are.

Wouldn't Daddy have loved one of them years ago!|`|kYYHw7xEaa	I tortured myself with my hair rolled around tin cans held in place with bobby pins that scratched my scalp, instead of curlers, for that full bodied look.<br>  It was nice when the style was straight, and I would just bend over by the ironing board and mom would iron it.<br>  Oh, the price of beauty.|`|q9BItD25aa	I remember short hair being in style in the 60's and then long hair ( hippie style) in the 70's. 80's gave us BIG hair.<br>  I remember going on a cruise and having to dry my hair under the bonnet hairdryer........|`|09affeac55dbe7c8b68c339feb29879faa	yes, I did.

I bought it at a yard sale and it worked like brand new. Last time I did get it out was when I was getting ready to go to a funeral and had to hurry things getting ready.<br>          I miss having my hair long. To me my long hair felt so good, so sexy and fun. As I have aged and my health taken a turn for the worse, I found having it short helps with the time I take for personal care. Living with others and sharing the bathroom (with our room mate, friend, ex husband) is sort of interesting to say the least. It really has been a good thing that the father of my six children and I remained friends after our divorce back in 1974, With  the economy and having our daughter as care giver for each of us elderly senior citizens, this arrangment has made that care  so much easier to deal with.<br>          My really long hair was so much fun, I would lay on my bed as a young girl and hang my head over the side and brush and brush. I think that is why it was so thick and healthy then. Now it has thinned so much that it won't even hold a curl.<br>          Send some of that 80 degree weather up to Northern Michigan, we would love it up here. Thanks.

I bought my husband some boxer shorts at Walmart. They clearly said "Made in the USA." That was the reason I chose this particular three-pack of boxers. He wore the first pair, and his bottom turned bright blue. The boxers were bright blue. When he got in the tub, he left a blue "print" on the bottom of the tub, and I'm still working to get it out. So, I washed the other two pairs before he wore them. I washed them with darks, and the water was blue. He wore the second pair, and they made his bottom blue. I made him take a shower that night, and I put the boxers in the rag bag. SO, rather than shop for American, I buy the best I can get for the least price. And his boxers are all light colors now.|`|q9BItD25aa	Some dog treats at the Dollar General.........I look at a lot of things now and try to buy things made in the USA.

Our laboring class, has priced itself out of the world market and made it wise for management to seek labor where they can realize a better profit margin.  Such management talent provides a more acceptable figure on the bottom line.  Management  endeavored to overcome the problems in manufacturing by producing a product that required replacement by the consumer in shorter and shorter periods of time.  This was countered by competitive foreign manufactures with the idea that they could produce a better product that would be regarded by the consumer as a product with higher value.  Most products therefor were produced elsewhere and imported into the United States. Labor and their Unionized Labor Organizations proved that the tail can wag the dog and that the cart belongs in front of the horse. Proof of their wisdom is now evident, indeed.  Have you received your latest stimulus check, yet ?  How many more weeks will you draw an unemployment check ? How many weeks has unemployment benefits been extended. How dependent will you become on the government ? How long will it be before we line up at the grocery to buy the few products that they have to offer ? American Ingenuity had better wake up and get back to work. Yes, we can, but will we ?

425ca8dc150991adaf3ef229478796cdaa	Mitchell's not like other vampires. But Seth is a Jewish name, so your hypothesis makes a lot of sense. Like a Jewish vampire wouldn't be affected by a symbol from a religion that doesn't apply to it. The show has that kind of awareness, in its worldview, it's what one thinks as much as anything else.<br>  <br>  And the writing, wow. That last eipsode.... :-)|`|GPmBB0Mvaa	Okay then that's a totally messed up question. If holy regaila worked, then yeah. it's the same|`|3tuwWidiaa	Because this is fiction, we can construct any story we want.  The traditional story involves vampires being repulsed or harmed by a crucifix, a symbol of Christianity.<br>  <br>  This updated version extends this to Judaic symbols, likely as a way to be more inclusive.<br>  <br>  However, there are some key distinctions that actually make the concept of a Star of David as a vampire defense item problematic.<br>  <br>  Specifically, the Star of David is not felt by Jews to possess any particular power.  The cross, on the other hand, is believed to actually be linked directly to Christ.  In other words, Christ's "power" could come through the cross to defeat the evil vampire.  There is no such concept in Judaism.  The Star of David is simply a symbol, and more definitely not a symbol of God (doing so would be breaking the first Commandment).  In other words, it would contain no more power than any other piece of jewelry.<br>  <br>  The makers of the particular show are trying to inclusive or trying to be "hip" by coming up with a new way to portray the old vampire story.  However, they are clearly not Talmudic scholars and (even if they happen to be Jewish themselves) have a real misunderstanding of Jewish culture, history, and law.<br>  <br>  But since this is all fiction anyway, I guess it doesn't matter.  They can makeup whatever they want.  And this, even though it's not terribly accurate, has a feel of authenticity about it that makes it work.|`|vEEeq7kYaa	Fictionally speaking of course...<br>  <br>  Since consuming blood of any form is utterly forbidden to Jews, a vampire or werewolf would certainly not be an observant Jew at all.  Eating the limbs off a living animal is also forbidden to all humans in the Torah.  Yeah, I can imagine a Jewish family would really frown upon a member who was sucking blood and tearing apart creatures in the middle of the night.<br>  <br>  IMHO..I think that some form of Kabbalistic Gematria or symbolism, ( like the name of God in Hebrew is used in the Golem stories) would be more likely to "affect" a Jewish vampire or werewolf if I were choosing to write a bit of fiction on this topic and have a Jew in it..(this is speaking strictly to a fictional account, how it might appear more congruent to what Jews know of Judaism) The symbolism of medieval mysticism could lend itself to objects or symbolism that would be more effective than the Star of David<br>  <br>  You'd have to ask the author of the piece of fiction of that show why he chose to have the actors behave that way...you really can't look to Jewish belief to rationalize it since as has already been said, the Star of David isn't viewed in the same way as the cross.

"<br>  <br>  Doesn't answer the question, but is relevant.|`|aYi8oEkJaa	not all loud people are stupid and not all quite people are smart .. <br>  so.. i would have to disagree.. <br>  <br>  what is wisdom if you don't share it .. and what is happiness if you don't spread it..|`|IEaedB5Eaa	I disagree, just because someone is outgoing doesn't mean they are stupid and there are some quiet people who are dumb as a rock. :-)|`|nS7koC7Oaa	.|`|jOiS7RpVaa	To a degree... Just cuz your a quiet person doesn't mean you full of wisdom, it could simply mean your a shy individual and hardly ever have enough self confidence to speak your mind and vice versa. However, often times those who are quiet are filled with wisdom because they know not to hang on too tightly to any one belief because they understand that ones belief systems change just as the theories produced by science are often discarded in place of newer more developed theoried backed by more scientific data. Not only that, but they also know that it's next to impossible to free a green nut from it's shell but if they wait for it to dry out all it takes is little tap. What I mean is they don't just go around shouting their ideology to whomever may be around, instead they wait to only tell the people they truly know will understand where they are coming from. The opposite often applies to those who are loud and lairy because they have such a ego it's next to impossible if not impossible for them to accept that maybe they have the wrong idea or that maybe someones elses idea is better, so they do go around shouting their mind because their ego consumes everything blindsiding them from listening to foreign knowledge.|`|hFxJ02NSaa	I believe the quiet ones may be smart and full of wisdom but that they are no more tolerant in their souls than other humans of abuse and mistreatment and so if quiet doesn't work to be treated respectfully, they can get quite loud in their protestations. More power to them!|`|ZE6RWhk4aa	No, because I have known many not-very-intelligent quiet people, and many very smart and wise loud and lairy people (who generally act that way because they aren't very comfortable around people).|`|m3YC7Jcyaa	opposites you mean?<br>  <br>  For every one good, there is 2 bad One in the Human world and One in the jinn<br>  <br>  al hamdoullah|`|pRDKYYV5aa	nO, WRONG. <br>  Everyone's smart in their own way<br>  -Meli Shabadabadingdong|`|rIvp1BToaa	not always   in some cases yes  but not always.|`|CDsLUCXUaa	well if god gave me a voice might as well use it|`|SzqeeUxgaa	well, it really differs from person to person. me and my husband shares everything same. his ideas are as same as mine. but he is very talkative and full of wisdom, my wisdom is similar to his wisdom but m not very talkative. m quite and shy, but I do think from the brain. urrrggg i dont know hehe ~!|`|7dGpL4mSaa	No. I'm not quiet, but I'm smart and full of wisdom.

5tvUXrh8aa	I'm not a fan of special events or selling items - too labor intensive and you don't get lots of money.  I would ask people one-one-one for donations, and/or do an email solicitation; and/or throw a few fundraising house parties where you get testimonials from the families of suicide victims.  Good luck.|`|q4tTabfjaa	I think you need to look closer at why people feel so desperate to consider suicide.  Not all are well enough to be busy.  If you are so depressed that you are considering suicide, a smile will not help.  Empathy is needed and not telling the person to cheer up.  In the bible they talk of someone being thrown in a pit and to get them out they had to put old clothes wrapped around the ropes to bring them back up.  This is the same, you can not pull someone out of the pits, without cushioning your efforts.  <br>  You can not expect smiles and telling someone to do something to have an effect, sorry, but it is true.  The Samaritans have answers, as do CRUSE for those who want to really help and also help those who have been the family or friend of a suicide victim.  Think of the last time you were really really crying, now imagine someone grinning at you, do you think it would have helped?  Imagine you are ill and the doctor says you are never going to get better, but worse and more painful.  Now imagine someone telling you to get out in to the community and do something useful.  Not going to work is it?  I know you mean well, but you need more research before you reach for a "Catchphrase".  Don't be put off, you said you wanted to take this very seriously, so now you have to roll your sleeves up and research thoroughly.

cd750eea4217ae61281dfe63b451de8eaa	I believe they do more good than damage.  I am an ally.  For some reason people that do not know me well sometimes offer me their negative opinions of gay people (they never make that mistake a second time).  I have noticed that these people become more worried about their ridiculous fears when there has been news of a pride event.  This means that society, whether they like it or not, is being reminded that you and your allies are here.  My fear is that if we did not continue to insist on being heard, to be out in front of society whenever there is an opportunity, then we woudl encounter an 'out of site out of mind' situation.  I also believe these events offer a wide range of people a wonderful opportunity to be themselves in a public setting.  Gay, Lesbian, Bi-sexual Transgendered, and Ally all working together for a better society.  After all, that is what people need to see and understand.  It really can be a better society when we all have an equal stake and an equal voice.<br>  <br>  Sorry about the speech.|`|ocy7FEcaaa	If people acted like they had a lick of sense at gay pride parades I would not have stopped going. I went to 2 or 3 of them in the 80's and was so disgusted by peoples behaviour that I never went again.

A lot of them cut their hair short and wore scandalous clothing.

That's just what they take pictures of.|`|2242ab75cc3bad9ab4ca7fbaf5578defaa	I'm not a great fan of making a big fuss about sexuality and lifestyle<br>  <br>  They probably do more harm than good.|`|DWwv3v9Raa	I think they're wonderful, this is the time you can walk all day into the evening showing your affection to your mate ...i.e. hugging or holding hands. Without being starred at criticized by others outside the LGBT community. Everyone in attendance is there for enjoyment not bashing.|`|IJMyRWp4aa	i think they are great for the gay community. it gives gay people a chance to face the world and say i'm gay and it gives straight people a chance to get to know gay people and see that we are just like them only we're gay.|`|d28067f1a921a90f7f3de7ed58b0e54caa	I feel like you.....These parades really dont represent myself, its a Gay-Theme Circus......You wouldnt See this kind of stuff in Straight Parades?

Its not different than if it were straight ppl acting a fool.  But I do think that there should be more rules of conduct.  It makes the outsiders think their view of homosexuality is right....that it's all about SEX and being flamboyant.|`|93y6qc2paa	no. there is not shame in being proud. i don't care how you go aobut it, what you dress like, and i am assuming this is the direction you are hoping to go with this question. <br>  <br>  pride is pride. <br>  <br>  peace!|`|WNWKDw4uaa	Yes.  I don't want to see a bunch of men in leather chaps with no undies prancing around.|`|yzgS5KiQaa	I think in a way people need gay pride parades. It's when LGBT people can be free to express themselves openly in a society that oppresses them. I think it is unfortunate that for many people who don't Desire to know more about LGBT, this gives off some pretty bad PR. Because that's all a lot of people see, an it reinforces stereotypes, like how being gay is a "lifestyle" choice, an how it's nothing more than sexuality. I would prefer if some parades where child friendly, even if the outrageous parades still continue.

3RQkgTSOaa	Obviously you share the same living spaces (as opposed to you living in one half of a duplex and him in the other)? If that were true you could always sublet (you move out and someone else moves in and pays you rent but that kind of makes you a landlord...)<br>  <br>  The situation is what it is though I'm sure trying to "move on" is a little awkward and difficult. Thing is, after a break-up you need YOUR space and YOUR time to "reset" from your past and prepare for your future. By seeing him every day that's not happening.<br>  <br>  Odd as this may sound, how does your ex feel about it? Would he rather dump the house as well so he can move on?

'Hold On I've Got It' wasn't referring to you both being unfaithful to each other during the relationship. But after. And his comment still stands. The two of you are in a mess together and you are bringing other people not involved into your mess. <br>  <br>  My boyfriend and I have broken up with each other 6 months ago too and we continued living together because we weren't in a place financially to break the lease and move out on our own. It was very wierd in the beginning but he is my best friend and I love him very much and he loves me too. Not enough to stay together but enough that we respect each other and our space together. Our lease is up in three days and this little nightmare/journey is coming to an end. Not once did I go out and meet other guys, let alone bring them back home. That is rude, that is inconsiderate of the other individual which is what Snoopy up there was saying, you obviously have NO respect for each other. Yeah you're both in a suck-*** situation, yeah you just want to move on but you both put yourselves in a situation that requires both of your attention. I hated my situation in the beginning and all I wanted to do was leave but I made a commitment from the beginning and I stuck it out till the end; I didn't feel the need of going out there getting my dick wet and throwing it in each other's faces. Which is exactly what you two are doing. Yeah it's wierd, it's extremely uncomfortable but if you both acted like adults and came up with a plan of getting out and in the mean time respecting each other during this time by not bringing guys home. You're both ok with dating other people, has it not crossed your mind on how that other person feels when you bring them into your mess. Stop thinking with your ***** and start thinking with your brains on getting out. You have options. Rent out your home if you can't sell it in this market, etc etc. But don't get on here thinking you don't have options, there are always options.|`|Z0pR9myIaa	that is sorta pathetic.|`|yeEzJ7EBaa	RUN.

What do i do?<br>  Tell a teacher. I know you will be probably thinking oh she will just bully me even more but thats wrong. It will put a stop to it and if not just ignore her and make nasty remarks back<br>  <br>  2. Is she really my friend? <br>  What do you think? Well I think no. She is a pretty bad friend if she is. Any time she needs you dont help her as she ahs never helped you. If she asks why just reply "Oh when was the last time you helped me...oh yeah...never" and just walk away<br>  <br>  3.

(think about it)<br>  <br>  4 - remember what you see in others is what you see in yourself, it took me a while to grasp this one, but its so true.  Be yourself, ignore this person, if you feel you need to complain than keep to the facts, and complain about the actions, not the person,,...because, remember, you feel sorry for her, I don't think its to do with race, more like ignorance|`|AA11070782	You should report her bullying and racism to the school and also tell your parents. Tell the teachers about the staring maybe a teacher will able to catch her doing it. The girl who is meant to be your friend doesn't sound like a friend.

What do I do? - You could ask her what her problem is.  A verbal confrontation might enlighten you as to why she is being so nasty towards you. <br>  2. Is she really my friend? Your friend(s) is no good.  Get rid of her.  You have helped her out when she needed a friend and she has not reciprocated. <br>  3. How do I cope with this horrible girl?  Maybe you will just have to stand up to her.  If you don't this will go on and on. <br>  4. Any other comments.... I went through this same thing when I was at school.  I had "friends" just like yours too, ones I would help but wouldn't help me.  I had to call the bullies bluff and let them know that I wasn't a push over.  If you cannot report the situation to your tutor at school you will just have to handle it yourself maybe be prepared for things to get very nasty (and physical). <br>  My heart goes out to you because I know exactly what you are going through.|`|177b82427498ae7807cb61bc6d21d5e7aa	Real friends should stick by you, they should not be two faced.

If that doesn't work best thing to do is ignore her.<br>  2. A true friend will defend her friend especially in a situation where you did no wrong.<br>  3. Say something back at her and tell her it's not funny whatever it is she's laughing at. Tell her it's wrong to bully others. I would tell my parents if that happened to me.|`|fYcYPyR3aa	It's really unfair on you and this bully is not worth it and she's bullying you because she knows you are affected by it and she's probably jealous of you for your looks or your brains. I think you should just ignore her completely, don't say anything about her, to her or anything. If she stares just stare right back at her and show her that you don't give a **** about her. Or you can say comebacks to her so if she laughed at your clothes you could say something  "If you want to see something really funny I've got a mirror you can look in" or something because once they realise you wont take it they might stop. Might backfire though cause she might get even nastier then.<br>  <br>  Your friends are probably scared of this girl and don't want her to start on them so they go the easy way and defend her because they know she won't turn on them then, especially as you were in the same room as the bully, they might think she or one of her friends could've heard. I think you should just act to your friends like it isn't happening because if you confront them they'll probably deny it anyway or start an argument.<br>  <br>  I'm at school so I know telling a teacher would probably make it worse right now because they could probably stop the staring but they can't stop her bitching about you to the other people but if it really is getting out of hand (like violence or  like even more then you probably should tell someone.
lys5kB9Daa	Well I only spend about $50 a week (AZ)- but it's just me. I would also spend a fortune if I had to buy for 2 teenagers too! <br>  one trick my mom taught me is to go around the store picking out your items, then when you're ready to check out go a random isle where there's not many people around and look in your cart and take out a few things you really don't need. maybe when you walked by the juice at first you grabbed some but then if you look at it later you're like well i dont need it, I have soda and water or something like that. or if you were going to buy 4 boxes of pasta-roni, be like well i guess i will be fine with just 2 boxes. It doesnt seem like much, in your head you're like "but its only a dollar" but if you do this with a few things it can add up to like $10 worth of stuff you didnt need.<br>  also buy the generic brand for most things, like cereal, granola bars. and remember just because it says organic or soy doesnt mean its healthy, some of those items are real rip-offs.|`|9g8spRvPaa	I used to spend at least $200.per week over 15 years ago but that was when we lived in Hawaii.<br>  I probably spend around $50. to $60. per week for two but often also feed my 33 year old son and his girlfriend.<br>  We live in NV.<br>  I shop at many different food stores for the best deals.<br>  I go to the international mostly Asian food store for fresh fish and greens.<br>  Another store for meats and eggs and make bread myself at home.<br>  Once every 6 weeks or so I do spend a bit more for cleaning products.|`|a0ea30926acdfeb82a6d6f9ca13bcc69aa	About $75 a week for two adults in Ohio.

The guests were playing Baccarat, a gambling game that was illegal in England but was a favourite of the Prince of Wales.  During the course of the weekend, several guests obeserved one of the players, Sir William Cumming, to be cheating.  At last a group of them got together and accused him.  He denied cheating, but agreed to sign a pledge saying he would never play cards for money again, so long as the affair was kept secret.  However, the story got out and sir william was ostracised by society.  He brought a court action and the Prince of Wales was one of those called as a witness.<br>  <br>  This is all quite true, and shows how seriously cheating at cards was taken in those days.|`|ZSOxZFLbaa	Getting some girl pregnant, of course!  <br>  <br>  "sowing his wild oats" was the expression they used.

In 1469, against the wishes of her half brother, King Enrique of Castile, she married her second cousin Ferdinand II, heir to the king of Aragon.  This secret union would prove to be one of the most important events in Spanish history, for their heir would inherit both the kingdoms of Aragon and Castile, thus forming Spain as we know it.<br>  <br>  In 1474 enrique died and Isabella became Queen of Castile.  Enrique's daughter Juana contested the claim and a civil war followed.  When it ended in 1479, Isabella was the undisputed queen.  That same year King Juan II of Aragon died, and Ferdinand became King of Aragon.  The two countries were administered seperately during the lifetimes of the couple.<br>  <br>  Following a flagrant breach of the truce between the Moors in Granada and Castile, Isabella became determined to drive the Moors from her land in a battle that lasted a decade (1482-1492).  When she was well into her fourth pregnancy and prepared to join her husband in Cordoba, she was arned that it was foolish to travel so close to the Moorish capital, but she told her advisers "Glory is not to be won without danger".  throughout the campaign, the king rode at the head of her army and Isabella became quartermaster and financier.  She also visited camps to encourage the soldiers and established field hospitalsm, and front line emergency tent hospitals.  The latter became known as Queen's Hospitals.  The truce in 1492 made Spain an all-christian nation again after 781 years.<br>  <br>  In 1486, christopher Columbus, seeking financial backing for his search for a shorter route to Asia, knew that he stood a better chance of impressing the intuitive and enthusiastic Isabella than her cautious husband.  However, although Columbus's proposition excited her imagination, all her funds were being funneled into the war with Granada.  It was not until 1496, when Santangel, Ferdinand's Keeper of the Privy Purse, reminded Isabella that her goal had been to make her country preeminent in Europe, that she summoned Columbus to return to make a contract.  During the next ten years she funded four voyages to the new world.  Isabella is remembered for her support fo rColumbus, but she also was a great patron of literature, the arts, and the Church.|`|ZSOxZFLbaa	Who's Queen Isabella?<br>  <br>  Golden age of what/where?<br>  <br>  Be specific for the best answers.|`|Yce0q14zaa	rule conquor

mVTGl6HGaa	Application process for employment-based visa<br>  <br>  Many immigrants opt for this route, which requires an employer to "sponsor" (i.e. to petition before USCIS) the immigrant (known as the alien beneficiary) through a presumed future job. The three-step process outlined above is described here in more detail for employment-based immigration applications. After the process is complete, the alien is expected to take the certified job offered by the employer to substantiate his or her immigrant status, since the application ultimately rests on the alien's employment with that company in that particular position.<br>  <br>     1. Immigrant Petition - the first step includes the pre-requisite labor certification upon which the actual petition will reside.<br>            * Labor Certification — the employer must legally prove that it has a need to hire an alien for a specific position and that there is no minimally qualified U.S. citizen or LPR available to fill that position, hence the reason for hiring the alien. Some of the requirements to prove this situation include: proof of advertising for the specific position; skill requirements particular to the job; verification of the prevailing wage for a position; and the employer's ability to pay. This is currently done through an electronic system known as PERM.[10] The date when the labor certification application is filed becomes the applicant's priority date. In some cases, for highly skilled foreign nationals (EB1 and EB2 National Interest Waiver, e.g. researchers, athletes, artists or business executives) and "Schedule A" labor[11] (nurses and physical therapists), this step is waived. This step is processed by the United States Department of Labor (DOL).<br>            * Immigrant Petition — the employer applies on the alien's behalf to obtain a visa number. The application is form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker,[12] and it is processed by the USCIS. There are several EB (employment-based) immigrant categories[13] under which the alien may apply, with progressively stricter requirements, but often shorter waiting times. Many of the applications are processed under the EB3 category.[14] Currently, this process takes up to 6 months. Many of the EB categories allow expedited processing of this stage, known as "premium processing".<br>     2. Immigrant Visa Availability. When the immigrant petition is approved by the USCIS, the petition is forwarded to the NVC for visa allocation. Currently this step centers around the priority date concept.<br>            * Priority date — the visa becomes available when the applicant's priority date is earlier than the cutoff date announced on the DOS's Visa Bulletin[15] or when the immigrant visa category the applicant is assigned to is announced as "current". A "current" designation indicates that visa numbers are available to all applicants in the corresponding immigrant category. Petitions with priority dates earlier than the cutoff date are expected to have visas available, therefore those applicants are eligible for final adjudication. When the NVC determines that a visa number could be available for a particular immigrant petition, a visa is tentatively allocated to the applicant. The NVC will send a letter stating that the applicant may be eligible for adjustment of status, and requiring the applicant to choose either to adjust status with the USCIS directly, or apply at the U.S. consulate abroad. This waiting process determines when the applicant can expect the immigration case to be adjudicated. Due to quotas imposed on EB visa categories, there are more approved immigrant petitions than visas available under INA. High demand for visas has created a backlog of approved but unadjudicated cases. In addition, due to processing inefficiencies throughout DOS and USCIS systems, not all visas available under the quota system in a given year were allocated to applicants by the DOS. Since there is no quota carry-over to the next fiscal year, for several years visa quotas have not been fully used, thus adding to the visa backlog.[16]<br>     3. Immigrant Visa Adjudication. When the NVC determines that an immigrant visa is available, the case can be adjudicated. If the alien is already in the USA, that alien has a choice to finalize the green card process via adjustment of status in the USA, or via consular processing abroad. If the alien is outside of the USA he/she can only apply for an immigrant visa at the U.S. consulate. The USCIS does not allow an alien to pursue consular processing and AOS simultaneously. Prior to filing the form I-485 (Adjustment of Status) it is required that the applicant have a medical examination performed by a USCIS-approved civil surgeon. The examination includes a blood test and specific immunizations, unless the applicant provides proof that the required immunizations were already done elsewhere. The civil surgeon hands the applicant a sealed envelope containing a completed form I-693, which must be included unopen

cMZEmpp0aa	It's a gray area in a lot of ways.<br>  <br>  Geisha in Kyoto and Tokyo are NOT prostitutes, and I seriously doubt they ever were. There were other women to perform the role of prostitute, such as the tayuu and oiran (there's not as much on them available in English, unfortunately) and there were laws separating them from geisha. <br>  <br>  Geisha who work in places like hot springs often were prostitutes to one degree or other.<br>  <br>  Ayan is right, if you do your research you'll uncover the truth, but not the truth Ayan seems to think is out there. I suggest you start with books by Liza Dalby, Lesley Downer, and Mineko Iwasaki. There's also a book with lots of pictures on the market right now. it's by and about Komomo, who works as a geisha in Kyoto right now. For internet resources, you might want to start with the Immortal Geisha forums.

XKYJk6Tcaa	A philosophy or method of inquiry based on the premise that reality consists of objects and events as they are perceived or understood in human consciousness and not of anything independent of human consciousness.<br>  A movement based on this, originated about 1905 by Edmund Husserl.<br>  Criticisms of phenomenology on the basis that its explicitly first-person approach is incompatible with the scientific third-person approach, going so far as to coin the term "autophenomenology" to emphasize this aspect and to contrast it with his own alternative, which he calls heterophenomenology. Dennett's criticism reflects a more general attitude among analytic philosophers of mind. Phenomenologists, however, are often quick to point out that the relationship between phenomenological and natural scientific methods has been a major theme in phenomenology since at least Husserl though Dennett makes no real attempt to engage with the work of phenomenologists on this issue. Many proponents of phenomenology argue that natural science can make sense only as a human activity, i.e., an activity which presupposes the fundamental structures of the 'first-person perspective.' While not hostile to the natural sciences per se, many thinkers in the Heideggerian tradition would regard criticisms such as Dennett's metaphysical rather than purely scientific claims, and thus susceptible to the usual criticisms directed at metaphysical theories of all kinds. Powerful defenses of the phenomenological approach against science-inspired reductive naturalism have been made by Hubert Dreyfus and Charles Taylor among others. <br>  As part of an ongoing debate with Hubert Dreyfus, John Searle has argued that much of the work done by phenomenologists on the philosophy of mind suffers from what he terms the 'Phenomenological Illusion Searle defines the Phenomenological Illusion as the mistake of assuming that what is not phenomenologically present is not real, and that what is phenomenologically present is an adequate description how things really are. According to Searle, this leads some phenomenologists to make mistaken claims about subjects such as meaning, social reality, functions, and causal self referentiality. Searle himself makes explicit that, defined as the examination of consciousness, he has no problem with phenomenology itself.

FY4cCjsOaa	It's out of context, and therefore I don't know what the "half" refers to, but it appears to mean half a sentence, half an argument, half of the stimulus package, or something like that.<br>  <br>  Anyway, the sentence proposes to "break down" (an idiom for examining the details) the "latter half" (that is, the half of whatever-it-was most recently mentioned), and to do it in the manner that the Guardian (a well-known publication) did, "subsequently" (that is, following) to whatever was being discussed.<br>  <br>  Because it looks like writing for publication, I tried a search and found a probable source: a discussion of a Guardian survey of attitudes toward evolution. The "latter half" were the people who did not state that they believed evolution was "true" or "probably true." The point of the breakdown was to determine how many of that group were<br>  - creationist,<br>  - "intelligent design" believers, and<br>  - uncertain what position to take.<br>  <br>  The reason for the closer examination was that the Guardian's summary of the results did not, in fact, represent the detailed results very well.<br>  <br>  This might not actually be the case you were citing. I have no doubt that the Guardian frequently misrepresents its survey results in such summaries.|`|ygGr1nX7aa	It makes sense.  <br>  <br>  "To break something down" is an idiom that means to simplify something, by splitting it up into easier sections.  It's a way of explaining or analysing.<br>  <br>  "As the Guardian subsequently did" indicates that the Guardian (perhaps the Guardian newspaper?) did the same thing (breaking the subject down) after whatever event was previously being discussed.|`|NFyQWFoGaa	Well, it doesn't make sense unless I knew where it was from. But it means, let's examine the second half, just like the guardian did.|`|jRJKDceqaa	????????|`|UYaWH7a0aa	They want you to break the second, or later half of whatever you are doing down into a simpler format just like the Guardian did himself (or herself). <br>  <br>  It would be easier if we had more idea of what this was related/in context to|`|swTjhCznaa	I think the Guardian is a news publication of some kind?

What was the sentence that preceded this one?|`|10bb153a928c9693ebec1b2660853526aa	"Let's divide this last half into smaller parts, as the Guardian did afterward."<br>  <br>  The Guardian is a British newspaper. Here's their website: <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.guardian.co.uk/</a><br>  <br>  "To break something down" means to divide it into smaller parts, or to explain something more simplistically. <br>  <br>  The "latter half" means "the last half" (you can remember "latter" by reading it as "later," that's how I learned it in elementary school). The opposite of "latter" is "former" (remember the "f" in "first" for that one).|`|YG8J5xA5aa	the latter means the secind half of something so if i say 'this is nice and this is bad, then it is talking about the bad thing. the second half of the sentance you will understand from the latter

Just be careful.|`|kavhzTXgaa	That's a tough one. I would forgive because its the right thing to do, but i wouldn't forget.

To be good you have to have the choice to do evil things.<br>  God tells us what to do with the commandments, but does not compel us to be good, he is just letting us know what the good choices are.<br>  I don't understand why our motives must be good. Just because god is good, don't mean he can't understand or replicate evil..

Wherefore, this thing must needs destroy the wisdom of God and his eternal purposes, and also the power, and the mercy, and the justice of God.<br>  <br>   And if ye shall say there is no law, ye shall also say there is no sin. If ye shall say there is no sin, ye shall also say there is no righteousness. And if there be no righteousness there be no happiness.

And if there is no God we are not, neither the earth; for there could have been no creation of things, neither to act nor to be acted upon; wherefore, all things must have vanished away.<br>  <br>    And now, I speak unto you these things for your profit and learning; for there is a God, and he hath created all things, both the heavens and the earth, and all things that in them are, both things to act and things to be acted upon.<br>  <br>   And to bring about his eternal purposes in the end of man, after he had created our first parents, and the beasts of the field and the fowls of the air, and in fine, all things which are created, it must needs be that there was an opposition; even the forbidden fruit in opposition to the tree of life; the one being sweet and the other bitter.<br>  <br>   Wherefore, the Lord God gave unto man that he should act for himself.

Look at the way we behave it's obvious.|`|3zt1PPnjaa	The fact that you realized that already means you have taken your first step towards the liberation from those primal impulses. It might just be like realizing, the only thing you know is that you don't know. It's true we have all these animal instincts because well in the end we are animals (but some people's ego won't allow them to realize anything). Many of the urges that overcome us serve a purpose, such as feeding or reproducing. Though we have a choice, we do not have to listen to these urges. Just like a person walking down the street in the city is likely to encounter people walking past him. The moment he bumps into someone and gets into a fight is like when a person falls victim to his passions. Just let the person go and walk by you, he isn't out to get you, it's all just a passing show. We have passions and we can enjoy them, but we do not have to let them control us. All of us already have the ability to master them, it's just hard for people caught in them to see a way out or for that matter even realize they are in the web of passions.<br>   Just what I think though.

I saw a talk show one time young mixed couple was on with their child who is mixed confronting both members of their family. The man was white and his wife black. I'm not a baby person but they had the cutest little girl I've ever seen. The wife's brother was being interviewed by the host and he said some very mean and cruel thing and he made comments about the child was no niece of his and he would never accept her in the family. This got me thinking. For what this is worth my parents and my siblings are all white. I have a younger sister who has a little girl from her first marrage to a white man who is a POS. I would rather see my sister with a black man or any other color or race who loves her cares for her loves my niece and would provide for them unconditionally. Than see her with a white man who beats her, drinks to extreames, does drugs or is just a piece of trash of a man. All colors have small groups that make that race look bad. If we as people especally Americans can for just a monent look past race, we could see that our differences are only skin deep. If you take and phycally cut any human they are going to bleed red blood. We don't have any off world aliens, if we did I would know because I'm the crazy nut case in every movie they contact with lol. And not to get too religious but All men and women have been created equals under the site of God. So if God is not a racest why should we be? This is not the 1800's. We are not in the 60's any more. The generations of intolerent Americans of other races are dying out. Our generation needs to step up and say, "Ok we don't agree on anything but I won't judge you because of your color or who your parents, or anstors" Anyway sorry I got a little excited.

8PA58u3kaa	Because a Homosexual person is far less likely to produce offspring than a heterosexual person, the majority of Homosexual couples that want kids adopt. If a significant percentage of the population is NOT producing offspring, this will intern contribute to the "control" of said population. But you have a point there about it generally being the same as birth control or sterilization methods, those two in a sense are contributing to the "control" on the growth of the population.|`|q7MQhS6baa	Just because we can have children, doesn't mean we want to be shagging the opposite sex to do it.|`|8OXVSoe0aa	Well gay people have no attraction to the opposite sex.

GPznIhzMaa	China has had more wars than any other country because it's one of the oldest and largest surviving ancient civilizations. <br>  <br>  Why do you feel the need to publicize your self-hatred?

Granted it's based on ancient history, and that's the keyword: ancient.  It pales into significance compared to WW1 and WW2 in terms of deaths.  I don't see how you can make any deductions about a culture from a film though ... it's supposed to be a war film.  Does an American porno film mean Americans have sex all the time?|`|Bc4RNrfwaa	lol..China is still better ina most ways..ANYWAY<br>  <br>  No, like the first answerer said you can't just generalize the ppl in the video into one country.<br>  <br>  So what if China had the most wars..at least their not in one now.....so it's not like I watch War videos with two white guys and say that their whole race is violent.
002bf792fb9490646e184e1013275676aa	Basically, yes I think your assertion is correct. Although some are self-haters and for some the hatred is directed at the country that represses them.|`|Y5S2dDkYaa	Yes, they  did.<br>  <br>  German immigrants, Italian Immigrants, Dutch Immigrants<br>  <br>  They all put a great deal of importance on learning English; back then their was much greater incentive to being "Americanized" multiculturalism was shunned and traditional values dominated the work place. There were no equal opportunity laws, or title X laws or what have you.<br>  <br>  You spoke English or you didnt work.<br>  <br>  Basically, you either fit in or you're life was miserable.<br>  <br>  The beauty of American Liberty (yes, I am libertarian) is that people can live their lives however they choose and not be hasseled - yes, America has overcome some inconsitencies in this, but their is still an importance put on national unity - "E Plurabus Unim" means "from many, come one". For unity, we need to be able to communicate and socialize with each other, not isolate ourselves in ethnic ghettos or political factions. <br>  <br>  Alot of people often rebuke me for ridiculous things I say on this site; and yes -  I do get rather upset when I see foreigners not assimilating, but in the grand scheme of things we do not need to become "Anglo" or even christians, we need to become one  -  a language doesnt determine who you are, so no, it would not make you a "self hater"|`|GPznIhzMaa	No, it's called assimilation. A lot of my relatives and friends who are 2nd- and 3rd-generation Chinese-Americans (and Chinese-Canadians) don't speak Chinese but they're not self-haters.

iHDYncuXaa	If you are pro-life, you cannot be for the death penalty. One life is just as sacred as another, no matter what. God created life. Only God should be able to take life away.|`|bfc067ab537555ada57edd464a8dfb97aa	The jury doesn't put anyone to death, the judge pronounces the verdict and the state puts the prisoner in cell to await execution. At the rate most 'death row' prisoners are put down most of the juriest would have died before the inmate.<br>  Everyone has a purpose some people execute prisoners; that is their purpose in life just like some people embalm not everyone is suited to the position.<br>  <br>  A pro lifer is all about stopping killing babies in the womb, that doesn't include vicious killers who wipe out children, or whole families on a whim, that is an entirely different situation.|`|AA11297267	I'm not pro-death penalty, and don't think I have a double standard.<br>  I believe that willful killing of a human being is wrong -- no matter how it's done.  If an individual does it, it's wrong.<br>  If the state does it, it's wrong.<br>  If it's done in war, it's still wrong.<br>  <br>  If the state wants to teach its citizens that killing is wrong, then it shouldn't kill.  Period.<br>  <br>  Yes, I know there are terrible, awful people who murder, maim, molest, and greatly harm others -- killing is still wrong, and by killing them for their crimes doesn't make it right.  <br>  <br>  My stance is also quite practical -- it's more expensive to handle all of the appeals, preparations, and execution for the death penalty than it is to keep them in prison for the rest of their lives.  So doing it my way, not only does the state not condone killing, it saves money.  Win-win.<br>  <br>  Peace.|`|wwdllMzYaa	its one of those subjects i am stuck in the middle<br>  on one hand im pro<br>  on the other very against<br>  <br>  <br>  yeah, its soemthing i hadnt considered i dont think, i dont know if i could do it or not<br>  but, it depends on the evidence agains them and what the crime is<br>  <br>  my double standard would be i kind of agree that i may not be able to do it<br>  and that im a vege ;-)|`|g0lKlQGnaa	Yes I agree.  It does nothing to promote the sanctity of life if the State is doing the same thing itself, for whatever reasons.  Killing without absolute need is just wrong on a higher level|`|d7c8ecd624fbbc0797b1502ba6682e8baa	I have taken life.|`|Ur6H8gwkaa	Of course someone had to bring abortion into this. Being pro life and pro death penalty are two different things. A child in the womb is helpless, defenseless and innocent.  I'm against abortion with the exception of rape or incest, or if the health of the mother is at risk. But against it for all other cases.<br>  <br>  Killers are usually adults that knew exactly what they were doing and should pay the ultimate price. But I'm for the death penalty because of the business side of it. Too bad it takes years, and years to kill someone. If it were more swift, the death penalty would make sense, why should we foot the 60k a year bill for 20 years to keep trash alive?<br>  <br>  That's money that doesn't go to the kids, to our roads, to our hospitals, to housing, to everything.<br>  <br>  So you asked "would you do it"<br>  <br>  On a jury, yes I could convict.<br>  <br>  If I had to do it with my own hand? Yes, if the case was clear, and ther was no doubt that the person ended another life, I would pull the trigger, or hit the switch or inject the poison.<br>  <br>  Too many people are weak, weak minded, soft and without guts. It's why the country (too many countries) are being run into the ground by criminals, and run by criminals, people don't have the stomach to do what's needed to take out the trash.|`|4d16b72ffa495ae128ab9f89679fc203aa	I have no problems with personally executing convicted criminals as the law requires.  I could throw the switch for electricity or gas.  I could lethally inject poison into someones veins.  I could even sharpen an axe blade and chop off their head.<br>  <br>  I support the death penalty.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  No, mirrors do not break when I walk by.  However, you do not want to try and mug me.|`|hj76FSKdaa	The Bible permits the death penalty, although it does not actively promote it.  And I am speaking of the New Testament.  So I cannot say that the death penalty is unbiblical.  However, my opposition is based on how the death penalty is applied.  It would require a very long essay to detail all of my concerns, but suffice it to say that the system needs fixing.|`|2567c53ea5be1f53420408d56fd5f4b4aa	What if the person convicted is actually innocent? Don't believe for a second that this cannot and has not happened. The possibility alone is enough to reject the death penalty. <br>  <br>  Mistakes cannot be reversed and the wrongly accused party will never, ever hear the apology.|`|AA11707311	If justice demanded it, I could convict for the Death Penalty, no problem.<br>  Child killers, sexual predators, and serial killers get no respect from me, having shown themselves wicked and outside of our compassion as they are despicable.|`|SoF7gxEqaa	It depends on the situation, how bad the crime was.  I am pro death penalty for murder cases and rape cases (since often a person's life is messed up after, sometimes even ruined)|`|4lHJEq5Haa	here's my problem: inmates get one of two fates. death, or living for free with 3 hots and a cot. neither of those options seem right to me. many peope on death row have been found innocent after lengthy trials or even after they have been put to death. I don't think it's up to anyone to kill anyone. If someone was driving drunk and killed my family as a human I would want them dead, but I know that's not right. <br>  <br>  so no, I couldn't take a human life. I don't think anyone should. And those who do should live out the rest of their miserable lives doing the manual labor that taxpayers pay for every year. so instead of paying 3 dollars every time I go through a toll to pay for roadwork, some criminal who beat his wife to death is doing it for free.

Islam safeguards females and raises them very high in rank like Mary(pbuh). It prevent them from being turned into tools.<br>  <br>  Also, when they take verses that were revealed in war-time out of context and say Islam is a violent religion. They never quote verses like these:<br>  <br>  "But if the enemy incline towards peace, do thou (also) incline towards peace..." (The Noble Quran, 8:61)<br>  <br>  "God does not forbid you from showing kindness and dealing justly with those(unbelievers) who have not fought you about religion and have not driven you out of your homes. God loves just dealers.  (The Noble Quran, 60:8)"<br>  <br>  "Fight in the cause of God those who fight you, but do not transgress limits; for God loveth not transgressors."

I believe that a lot of the Muslims nowadays are acting according to what they THINK is the word of god and not to the actual writings. I believe that, like Christianity, they have chose the easiest way for them. They are using religion to cover their oppression over women and to people that do not think like them and so everyone in the western world thinks that this is what religion says. Also I have met Muslims that are true to the religion and respect it as they should, so maybe there is still hope for the ones who hide their inadequacies behind taken out of the context verses of Qur'an.|`|BDSC8R3Aaa	I am not muslim, but I have the feeling that a big misconception is that some people believe it to be a religion of peace<br>  <br>  I think<br>  <br>  While we hear that muslims are blowing themselves in a group of women and children of their own people, screaming "Ala Akbar"<br>  <br>  Right, there may be christian extremists, true.

I think you'd have to change the brain to really get into altering sexualities, if they found a temporary way to change it maybe the more homophobic people could see things from our side for a bit.<br>  But then again, I guess many people don't really care about things a lot unless it directly affects them.|`|phcw1KhGaa	i would be offended if it was called a cure or if it was to be forced on people who do not want to take it especially younger people whose parents are still their legal guardians. but look at it this way we could reverse engineer it in order to un-vacinate the unwilling participants in this "cure"|`|b108de07dd9b74f1bd9ebf107e54d92caa	I wouldn't so much be offended as I would be frightened.

I think people honestly think we need to be rescued or something and 90% of the time that isn't the case. Most of us are content with our sexuality once we settle in to it. If there was a "cure" I wouldn't take it tho and I don't think you could be forced into taking something like that so I'm good. :)<br>  Maybe you shouldn't call it a "cure" that offends most people. Not me because I understand the gist of what your saying.<br>  <br>  Edit: Person above me has a good point. I hope they never come up with a "cure" because parents would pressure there children into taking it and if there not 18 they may have to. In turn they would be afraid and people would have to stay closeted and then more negative things could happen.|`|ZSlXrXsCaa	If they called it a 'cure' I would. A more appropriate name would be a reversal. If it wasn't a cure then no, people have the right to choose.|`|hZiwiboRaa	Obviously..<br>  It's like someone inventing a drug that will cure being black.<br>  There's nothing wrong with being black or white or gay or straight.<br>  I just don't get why people make it into a big deal.<br>  What you think?<br>  <br>  EDIT: We need homo-sexuals to keep the earth at a gradual population, without us earth would be EVEN MORE packed with people..|`|HQKuzxulaa	This is something that would have to be left entirely to homosexuals, the choice would be theirs. As a heterosexual I wouldn't want to change.|`|kavhzTXgaa	Good question, I think the word "cure" is offensive but other than that people can do what they want, its a option for some people might consider, not me though.|`|Ur6H8gwkaa	All of the answers here prove how brainwashed people are.<br>  <br>  They've had their logic twisted and don't even realize it.<br>  <br>  The gays will be offended. Then they will say well "you could say being black could be cured" or being 'asian' <br>  <br>  What they don't know or fail to realize is that being gay is evidence of a biological error in their genes. It's not personal, it's not an attack, just the truth. Being gay is biologically incorrect. Being black is not.<br>  <br>  Gays, and straights that have twisted minds don't realize that if there was a marker for being gay, and it could be avoided with a cure, or abortion, or something in between, they would rail against it.<br>  <br>  The truth is, there is no need for gays in the world. Do I hate them? No, but let's be honest, it's a trait that has no need or use. If all the people in the world that were gay, could be made straight, what's the harm?<br>  <br>  If all people that were color blind, deaf, or had some other genetic issue could be cured, and they marched against it, wouldn't that seem stupid? But mention the word gay, and everyone labels you a hater.<br>  <br>  Gays will then claim "what if there was a cure for being heterosexual?" again proof that they have been brainwashed. Also, it's just a childish thing to say when you don't like what's being said. Use logic, and the gays and straights that get all bent out of shape when a question like this is asked, they don't have a leg to stand on. <br>  <br>  The only thing they are good at doing is calling you a bigot, a hater or H8 ( I love that one) when they can't stand and defend their point.<br>  <br>  <br>  Name one single thing that homosexuality has given the world that's a benefit. Name one, I can't. <br>  <br>  Bottom line, this is a great question.|`|6SwaWSoyaa	This is a response to Sound Labs,<br>  <br>  There is only one thing that I agree with Sound Labs is how he said that he doesn't hate gays, but he isn't looking too much better. The reason why in the 1960's homosexuality was removed from the American Psychiatric Associations list is because scientist proved that there wasn't any defects in the brain or genetics.<br>  It sure in the hell doesn't make him look like he is to likable with gay people though saying that a cure for it could be abortion. No one can determine if their child is going to be gay or straight, so abortion has nothing to do with this subject at all.<br>  <br>  There are too need for gay people in the world. Why? Because they are people. Gay people are too indeed needed. They are a huge help to the world by keeping orphans out of the orphanages and off the streets? We don't label those who are haters, unless they make a derogatory remark.<br>  <br>  In conclusion,through your passage it has been proven that you are the one who is inadvertently hating, I have made good points of what homosexuality has done for the world and perhaps you are the brainwashed one.<br>  <br>  Now to answer the question, i think it would be just some egocentric christian or a closeted homosexual who is afraid to come out, would be the crazy scientist.|`|521978f4254c4b8f2b7244300239e951aa	That offends me and I'm not even gay.  Sexuality is part of what makes people who they are, not a disease or disability like cancer or autism.<br>  <br>  Even if there was a biological component for homosexuality, why would it be necessary to change it?  Is it any different than making brown eyes turn blue?  I personally don't think so.|`|GrhBvUEEaa	okay. yeah. AIDS is killing children in Africa. Cancer is killing women around the world, and just people in general. People are starving of malnutrition. War is ripping countries apart, But they want to find a cure for someones happiness. oh yeah. i would not only be offended, i would mostly be heated. WHAT A WASTE OF TIME!!!! Homosexuality is not a disease. i did not choose to be gay. i did not choose to be black. it is something i am born with!!!! And i love it. I am Happy. why do i need a cure!!!|`|7IogJOgBaa	I guess its just another way to make life easier, but its not cureable because its not  a disease. I guess i would be pissed, because shouldn't they be working on curing aids.|`|aHLnNrOGaa	Are not more people afflicted with heterosexuality?<br>  <br>  Should not they try to 'cure' that first?|`|eC5QIpnbaa	there are several effective cures already. why be offended about one more?|`|CvDzpQREaa	whatever keeps their pitiful minds busy from bashing me|`|u3KhqAVvaa	Guess what?

There's a translation error with the Hebrew word "erets" which can mean "earth, world, terrirtory, land, region, ground, and dirt." The whole world was affected by a possible asteroid  strike, as evidenced by the Indian Ocean Burckle crater,it would've caused torrential rains on a global scale, hence the flood myths, as well as sending tsunamis into the Middle East Basin, flooding the Land and killing everyone in the region.|`|rFlhIgJXaa	If the flood actually happened (assuming you refer to Noah's Ark) i would say after... but I personally believe that most of the Genesis is ... like a fable... it has a moral to it, cause quite frankly 2 of every animal = inbreeding and what... 10? or so people = inbreeding to the max. Same with Garden of Eden... Adam and Eve had 3 sons... no daughters... :O but thats just what i think.|`|O1xSW736aa	There was no global flood.  Most cultures have flood myths because most cultures experienced floods at some time.  THe Mesopotamian Flood that gave rise to the epic of Gilgamesh and simiar stories eventually leading to Noah, has been dated to around 2900BC|`|5tgksDp1aa	I think a true believer could simply argue that the paintings were made after the flood, right?

You either buy the bit about 100 million year old hominids making barely understandable pictographs and then say, Well couldn't  have been a Flood ...OR...you say it was after the Flood and man was created advanced and this shows it -- but the poster will say : Idiot, we know man was around for much longer and that he wasn't created.<br>  <br>  Me, I don't know. But the paintings show advanced culture so I would say you are wrong in stipulating that they are savages of a sort.<br>  <a href="http://www.memo.fr/Media/Lascaux_taureaux.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.memo.fr/Media/Lascaux_taureau...</a><br>  <br>  Somebody I admire said this :<br>  "It reminds me of a TV show I saw 30 years ago or so with Richard Leakey, standing in front of some gorgeous Paleolithic art at Lascaux or Altimira. With a straight face, he looked into the camera and asked, "Who were these people? Why would they do such things?" I suddenly had the distinct impression that he would have asked the same question standing in the Louvre. It wasn't that there was something strange about the cave painters. It was that there was something very strange about Richard Leakey. He didn't seem to really grasp that he himself was homo sapiens sapiens and that human being like to paint pictures and do art. I've never quite looked at allegedly "scientific" approaches to the human person the same way again. And I suspect something of the same thing obtains when it comes to the rest of God's critters too. There are different ways of knowing, and science is but one. "
AA11946554	LOL-I agree completely. Gee, I wonder why they never preach that story on Sunday morning? ;-)|`|s7pqFa1eaa	Dude, these thing are allegory, they are examples why the Hebrews should follow Hebrew law. There is no valid reason to try and make sense of them.|`|7d16b3b33c15681f9d53425cac12ac67aa	Abraham/ Abram is one of the patriarchs of the Bible. It is from his line that the Hebrew nation came about. In this mindset he is considered blessed and loved by God. He is also considered a prophet. Perhaps Abraham/ Abram was guided by God to tell Pharaoh that Sarai/Sarah was his sister. Abram had a reason to fear for his life as it was probably not uncommon for men to take a man's wife and slay him. And Pharaoh being the ruler of Egypt would have certainly had enough power to do so.  At any rate, because of the love God had for Abram, God punished Pharaoh because of his love and devotion to Abram.|`|e8a42257dd2b34817d2020222ee63839aa	Because that was their view of God in that specific time and that specific place:  indiscrimately punitive.<br>  <br>  Was it right?  No.  God didn't send a sickness to Pharaoh because of Sarai.  But it's a good example of how the Bible isn't a history or science book.|`|AA11703455	Sari was his half-sister, and for being in her 70s and 80s, was a knock out. Kings don't drag old ugly women in to the palace. And this happened to Abram twice. <br>  <br>  God used the sickness to notify Pharaoh some thing was wrong. (Sort of a foretaste of what would come some 500 years later!) No one died, but the warning was heeded.

Doing what God wants is not seen as the act of love which it is.  Instead, they automatically classify it as legalistic "works" so that they think, thereby, to absolve themselves from any responsibility for living up to God's Requirements.

The Church must stand...we must hold the fort, for He is coming back. Sins of all kinds must be gotten rid of...we can't do it on our own, but as a Church we can help each other to overcome those sins through the strength of Christ, empowered by the Holy Spirit. Tolerance of outsiders is fine...members must make all attempts to maintain a Christlike demeanor in both thoughts and actions. When an outsider wishes to join, it should be because they have been convicted of the Holy Spirit...not enticed by entertainment or socialization.|`|9YMLsk7Taa	No we should not be silent, was John the Baptist silent? Too many Christians are afraid of offending the people that engage in these immoral acts. Where would we be today if Peter , Paul, Luke, Matthew, or any of the other early church did this? Was Jesus silent to the people that engaged in sinful acts in that time period? YOU CANNOT BE A FRIEND OF THE WORLD AND A CHRISTIAN!!!!|`|Q4SnXeQwaa	No we should not be quiet but before we start in on the worldly situations, we need to clean up our churches and the sexual sins that are in them.<br>  <br>  It is wrong for churches to turn their back on sexual sin in their own people.

We in this world are so remote from God that we don't even perceive His existence in reality. The reason and purpose of this life is to recognize that our sensation of separateness from each other and from the Creator is unfulfilling and false as we are only concerned with our own self and to hell with everyone els. This attitude is something we are obligated to turn around. First we must connect with others positively by using our ego for bestowal and good then we reveal the benevolence of the Creator between us. The fear that a person feels eventually changes from egoistic fear of something bad happening to him to fear of not loving and not being able to give. Fear is the only thing our ego will bow down to and we utilize it only for that so we can ascend to love and revealing the Creator.<br>  <br>  Here are some videos on how to acquire the sensation of a loving and benevolent God:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2umf7LXLuyk&feature=channel" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2umf7LXLu...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.kabbalah.info/engkab/kabbalah-video-clips/human-nature" rel="nofollow">http://www.kabbalah.info/engkab/kabbalah...</a>|`|rFoKf7ieaa	Yes, it's bad; for your integrity, dignity, and intelligence.

Although, I suspect there might be some people who feel this way, I did in the past, when you read the Bible (and if at all possible do it with the leading of 'The Holy Spirit', if he's already in your life, as he can help to give you a 'clearer' understanding of the Word, in order to 'cast out that fear that you're feeling'.) ask 'Jesus' to come and reside in your heart and touch your mind for the 'clarity' that you need to get rid of that fear.<br>  While there is such a thing as 'reverential fear' for God and all that 'He' stands for in our lives, the fear that you mention here while understandable, can make you lose out on what the 'true' loving purpose is for God in your life. He loved ALL of US enough to sacrifice 'His' only begotten Son for all of mankind, even those who do not believe in Him.<br>  Please read the scriptures on fear (Psalm 19:9,10.  Psalm 27:1 'Whom shall I fear', Psalm 36:1 'There is no fear of God', Isaiah 35:4 'Be strong and do not fear', Luke 23:40, are just a few scriptures which should help you out.), and turn to the God and Lord Jesus Christ who made those Words for better understanding.<br>  If you don't have the Holy Spirit, would you be willing to ask him to come into your heart, in order for you to have better understand of the Bible?<br>  Sorry for going on and on here, and I pray that with the help of God (PLEASE don't listen to people who say He doesn't exist? They have NO idea what they're talking about, perhaps because they've never given Him the opportunity to come into their lives.) see Him in a better light and cast out your fear.  God bless you.|`|qmzJg3DMaa	I think it is fine.

There isn't anything morally wrong with marrying off a 13 year old. It's more of a culturally wrong thing.

In this first section, we will present the data from recognized Muslim sources (primarily Sunni sources) in order to see what they say in regard to Aisha’s age at the time of her marriage. . . .<br>  <br>  Narrated Aisha:<br>  The Prophet engaged me when I was a girl of six (years). We went to Medina and stayed at the home of Bani-al-Harith bin Khazraj. Then I got ill and my hair fell down. Later on my hair grew (again) and my mother, Um Ruman, came to me while I was playing in a swing with some of my girl friends. She called me, and I went to her, not knowing what she wanted to do to me. She caught me by the hand and made me stand at the door of the house. I was breathless then, and when my breathing became all right, she took some water and rubbed my face and head with it. Then she took me into the house. There in the house I saw some Ansari women who said, " . . .  I was a girl of nine years of age. (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Volume 5, Book 58, Number 234)<br>  <br>  SUNAN ABU DAWUD<br>  <br>      Aisha said: The Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) married me when I was seven years old.

2rGkuTIaaa	Let's face it, baby shower gifts are just like any other gift in that they are "gifts".  That's why they say you shouldn't look a gift horse in the mouth.<br>  <br>  Anyway, the registry is great for guidance.  It really helps people who have no clue what to get or are afraid of getting something that someone else is getting (doubling up).  I'm a firm believer that the best gift is one that is from the heart.<br>  <br>  If you can find a gift from the heart, that isn't on the registry, I say go for it!  <br>  <br>  The fact that it is cheaper isn't at all an issue.  I know that for my baby shower, I was just excited for people to be there.  I would rather them get me no gift at all if the alternative meant putting a financial burden on them.<br>  <br>  Good luck and have fun!|`|In2hruCdaa	Noooo, you are not wrong for thinking that way at all.  I just had my baby shower and I appreciated all gifts from everywhere.  Diapers, Wipes, and Onesies from Wal-Mart, Target, or Babies r Us all do the same thing.|`|oMj8WAHFaa	i think it is the joy of that person that counts and your warmth giving.|`|6uEmRe7Naa	You are not wrong for thinking that. Shopping around is a great idea. The registry is not intended to be a mandatory place to shop. It's there so the mom will get things she really needs and make the process easier for the guests. The only downfall is you might not know if those items were purchased from the registry already and future buyers won't know that you purchased the item already. I would definitely include a gift receipt for easy returns just to be on the safe side.

zNGZ2X7Maa	This is a tuffy!!<br>  <br>  You are right in that the JW church is a church full of false doctrine.  Your mother has more of the truth than you know!  I am glad in one sense that you are going to go live with your mother.  Now, the hard part is knowing what to do for now until you get to move.<br>  <br>  The word of God states that we are to honor our mothers and fathers.  Even though he does not believe the truth, has been (by your testimony) a bit of a control freak, and religiously brain washed by the JWs, he is still your father.  You need to honor him and quit causing him trouble.  You need to align yourself to the Scriptures and obey them, even if it does not feel good at the moment.  God understands what you are going through and He will bless you for your obedience to Him.<br>  <br>  Now, having said that, I believe that it would be fine for you to ask your father if he would allow you to go and live at your friends house until the time you are to move to your mother's place.  If he says that it is OK then, cool!  Go live at your friends place.  If he does not say it is OK then, you should obey his wishes and stay there for these last 4 months.  I know it will be hard to do that, but later on in life you will be able to look back and see how God brought you through this and how He ultimately blessed you in it.  <br>  <br>  You do not have to put up with the "Bible studies" that these girls put you through.  If you have to stay with your father, you do not need to subject yourself to their false doctrine studies on a weekly basis.  This is not your religion any more and you do not need to be force fed it.<br>  <br>  Do you know what being a Pentecostal believer is about?  Have you talked with your mother about what she believes?  Is this family you are considering moving in with a Pentecostal family?  I would suggest, if it is possible for you to do this, to find a Pentecostal church to attend if the one you are attending now is not Pentecostal.  I would also recommend going through some Bible studies with some people from that Pentecostal church, so that you get a fuller understanding of what it is you will be living with when you go to your mother's church.  Many of your Pentecostal churches have excellent Bible studies available to give  you a Biblical foundation on which you can stand.  Once you get rooted in the truth, nothing can shake you from that (Mat. chapter 7, "built upon the rock")!!!<br>  <br>  In short, talk to your dad and find out if he would let you live with your friend's family.  Whatever the answer is, honor your father!  You do not have to honor his false religion, but you do have to honor him.<br>  <br>  I will pray for you during this difficult time of your life.|`|35mnR8c6aa	This is what you need to do.

What does your mom think about moving in with this family?<br>  <br>  good luck, hon.. this is a hard time for kids your age who don't want to be part of the watchtower.  fortunately my husband had non-jw family who took him in.  Too bad you do not have the same.<br>  <br>  edit:  another thing you should know, JW men whose kids aren't agreeably going to meetings and out in field service reflect badly on them in the congregation.  No doubt your father is being counselled by the elders and may have his privileges suspended for not having you "in control."  No doubt this is stressing him out, as standing in the congregation is -very- important to all JWs, probably moreso than their standing with God.|`|IqPz1PZOaa	.<br>  The secret word to perhaps most of the problems that you may be facing could be contained that tiny word that you keep using "want", so how is it that nobody is yet asking you what you really want?

This is the word:<br>  <br>  Jesus has already spoken the end of the journey and that was a safe landing on the other shore.<br>  <br>  So, no matter what we are going through, the Lord will bring us through to the other side.  Also, it will work out for our good in the end, and for God's glory too.  (Romans 8:28 and Psalm 50:15).<br>  <br>  Call upon me in the day of trouble.  I will deliver you, and you shall glorify Me (Ps. 50:15).<br>  <br>  All things work together for the good of those who love God and are the called according to his purpose.

It's horrible that a parent would treat his own child this way but sadly it's like I said, they are taught to be that way.<br>  <br>  <br>  I wish you the best of luck and hope things get better for you.|`|FOzN3xwzaa	"Jehovah's Witness" rejects the truth that Jesus is God, which means "Jehovah's Witness" have a different and fake "god" that cannot save anyone. They also change the Bible. They are not Christians.|`|FjiRPKp2aa	I would put up with dad and here is why. You have a good chance to do something more spiritual than you know right now.Also the four months you have left you can use to your advantage to talk to your mom and make plans for the move.Treat your dad with biblical respect and always try to do right by him.Why the bible says so and you never want to break the father daughter tie someday you may be sorry you did.Try not to ruin a tomorrow that is not here yet today.When the girls come to share with you do a little research and ask serious that you disagree with but always be respectful and not facetious but serious about  what they tell you.It will drive the JW's nuts Work with your mom to make the move in smoother remember you two have not been able to spend much time together you are sort of acquainted strangers.|`|ZRQcM64Faa	My friend, if this does not prove the Watchtower is a cult that brainwashes its people, nothing does.   There are several red flags here too.  I know someone whose wife is a JW and he was locked out of his house one day.  This person is a born again Christian and he called her elder and asked about 1 Cor chapter 7 where it tells that if a believer and unbeliever are married and the unbeliever did not want to leave, the believer is NOT to divorce.  It did not take long for that friend to be back home. <br>  <br>  One of the signs of a real Christian is LOVE....unconditional love and I see conditional love...controlling love written all over those who trust in this organization rather then in Jesus.   Why is it that GOD can give people free will  but JW's can not?   <br>  <br>  I do believe the woman at that church has shown more of this love then your dad or step mother.  I would strongly suggest taking them up on it!  I believe they really care about YOU while your dad is showen he is well trained in that his  love is only there to keep you in line with the WT and not to help you have a relationship with the LORD. <br>  <br>  Remember...most watch towers today are intended to keep people IN....to keep them a prisoner against their will.

Personally, from a "religious" standpoint being gay is a worse sin.<br>  <br>  I personally don't think it is but I don't have my own religion that says so, or millions of followers. <br>  <br>  From a SPIRITUAL standpoint, it's worse to have hatred in your heart. Hate is like a cancer that destroys everything it touches. With hate in your heart, there is no room for spiritual growth or understanding.<br>  <br>  As far as sins, I think it all depends on who it relates to: Is a gay man who loves his neighbors and serving his community with kindness and compassion going to Hell? Or is the God fearing preacher who has hate in his heart for those whom God has created going to Hell instead?<br>  <br>  Who knows.|`|AA11008046	True Born Again Christians would not make such statements.  Actually they should check their dictionary.  there is a proper meaning for ****** and it has nothing to do with sex or a persons sexual orientation.  This has been a long standing beef of mine.  Twisting the grammar around so a word doesn't mean what it really means.  For example saying something is nice and calling it "cool"  Cool is a temperature.  Has nothing to do with nice.  Now you bring up another.  I am not going to repeat it again but it is in Websters.<br>  We need to say what we mean and mean what we say.  This nonsense of following all the TV jargon in our daily living is ridiculous.<br>  As for the worse of the two sins. In God's eye sin is sin.  There isn't any one greater than another.

I never heard Christ turn anyone away, I think that some Christians focus too much on Christ death and not enough on his life and the example that he gave to us to follow.  I live in a small town and there are not many gays that live here, I work with a gay man, he actually helped me to get my job!  He is one of my most favorite people in the whole world, he is sweet, kind, loving, he is the closest to Christlike that I have ever witnessed.  He would never hurt anything, he has the biggest heart ever, I know that Christ loves this man, I love this man.  I will not judge him or his choices in life, and I am so glad that I don't have to.  Do your best to seek out only the good in people, your life will change and you will see the world through different eyes.  All sins are equal.|`|WYk0zYdhaa	No, when done that way it is not in love and not in a way that Christ wants us to exhort our brothers and sisters.  That pastor was way out of line and even though the act of homosexuality is an abomination to God name calling is not Christ-like not to mention very unprofessional (lol really that's what he came up with?).  Not all believers act in that way.  I have many friends that are homosexual or bi-sexual and although they know where I stand I do not call them names or beat them over the head with a bible.  That is NOT what brings people to the cross.  Instead it often proves that all their misconceptions of Christians are true.

My circumstances are average, and I don't think my relationship with God necessarily affects my circumstances, if that's what you are implying. Our blessings after all, do not necessarily come now, though the Lord does take care of us if we have faith. Take Job, for example. I love that story. Any time life gets tough, I think about Job, and how I need to remain strong in God in the face of adversity.<br>  <br>  I would, however, like to improve my personal relationship with God. As a child, and even as a teenager, I spoke with God as a close friend. I felt like he was always right beside me and listening to everything I said to him. I went through some really tough times, and I lost my way for a while. I'm back on track now, have been for some time. But I still don't feel that same closeness with God, except for when I am singing worship songs. I am working on getting that back, and knocking down the wall I've built over the years completely. It is crumbling, but with God's help, I will knock it down completely and feel his presence with me again at all times.<br>  <br>  Again, really good question - it's something we all need to ask ourselves on a regular basis, in order to improve our relationship with God.|`|pbTtiPqOaa	I stand before God a sinner who has been redeemed by the merits of Jesus Christ. There is nothing I am able to do to actually merit anything by myself to be holy (righteous) before God. Simul iustus et peccator. Simultaneously justified and sinner. I still have sin in my flesh. That sin is enough for God to condemn me. He has every right to do that. I have no right to stand before God and say, "I am holy," or "I am better than that person (even if that person is bin Laden or Hitler)." I deserve to suffer in Hell for eternity. But God, who is rich in love and mercy, sent His Son to pay for my sins in my place. He is the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world. I stand before God and say, "Christ has paid for my sin. You have fulfilled Your promise. I now am worthy of heaven just because You have made it possible. You washed my sins away in Your Holy Baptism. You nourished my faith through Your Holy Supper and by the hearing of Your Holy Word." Can I improve it? No. I cannot "improve" my relationship with God. I can't do anything to merit any sort of worthiness before God. God has justified me so that I might live a sanctified (holy) life. Soli Deo Gloria!|`|ELjrNPVxaa	Well I don't know about you but God told me I have to balance my own bank account. Now if you got him to balance yours let me know and I will have a talk with him.

I have found God faithful in all His promises. The main one being He has never left me or forsaken me.<br>  <br>  From the day I first repented and was baptized in Jesus name and was filled with that marvelous joy unspeakable and power of the Holy Ghost evidenced by speaking in tongues Jesus has been too wonderful for me to express. <br>  <br>  Jesus has been deliverer, my savior, my strenght, my hope and my help in the time of trouble. <br>  <br>  Jesus is the only God I know. He has seen me through, trials, persecutions, slander, heartache, sickness, pain, and death. <br>  <br>  Jesus has been more than anyone ever told me He would be from the day I first repented. Since then I have seen and experinced the glory of God many times.<br>  <br>  He always meets with me when I pray. He has revealed His word to me and opened my understanding. His is mine and I am His and His banner over me is love. <br>  <br>  Before I knew HIm as a child I would hear Him calling my name sounding so softly kind of like of a wisper on the wind while family slept and all lights were out.<br>  <br>  God has been more than a goosebump God to me. He has answered many prayers and given many victories. <br>  <br>  My life has been full of His love and underserved mercies. <br>  <br>  My walk with Him has been miracioulous. <br>  <br>  He has laid down His life and spilled His blood for me. <br>  <br>  I have done so little yet still He continually tells me He loves me in so many ways.<br>  <br>  Many times my heart has been overwhelmed by His love and  wondered why he would love me so. <br>  <br>  You ask how I am doing. I am still fighting the fight. Ive been knocked down but not out. You might wonder if I am satisfied. I am and I am not.<br>  <br>  You asked how I intend to improve myself spiritually. <br>  <br>  The same way I started out living for Jesus. <br>  <br>  By staying with the basics of praying, reading the word, praising and worshipping Him in both Spirit and in Truth.<br>  <br>  By praying till I weep and become as a little child. <br>  By praying until there is peace. <br>  By praying till I touch Him. <br>  By praying until there is victory.<br>  By praying till I hear from heaven.<br>  By praying for my enemies<br>  By praying for those who dispitefully use me or slander me.<br>  <br>  By following Him in holiness and having peace with all men.<br>  <br>  By going to that place I know is holy.<br>  <br>  By going to that place by His side.<br>  <br>  By being obediant.<br>  <br>  By serving and giving my best.<br>  <br>  By being faithful to the house of God.<br>  <br>  By never being satisfied.<br>  <br>  By continually asking God for the right spirit and a clean heart.<br>  <br>  By striving to enter in and never thinking I stand on my own.<br>  <br>  By not standing in the way of sinners.<br>  <br>  By being careful of what I say.<br>  <br>  By being careful of what I entertain.<br>  <br>  By being careful not to look or participate in the very appearance of evil.<br>  <br>  By being holy.<br>  <br>  By walking the walk while preaching and teaching His word.<br>  <br>  By careing for the lost and encouraging the young.<br>  <br>  By doing my best to love others like Jesus would.<br>  <br>  I could go on and on. <br>  <br>  Yet none of these works will save me for try as I may sometimes I am disappointed in myself leaving me only one thing to do.<br>  <br>  Repent and get up and keep on keeping on.<br>  <br>  Jas 4:17  Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin. <br>  <br>  I know too much to give up now.

ZmdIlkpQaa	It's absolutely true that even in the United States, girls could be married as young as 13, with parental permission.  In fact, as late as the 1950's, Jerry Lee Lewis married his 13 year old Cousin.  My own Great great grandmother was married at 13 to a man nearly three times her age.  <br>  <br>  Generally, however, in European and European influenced cultures, the bride had to be of age to breed.  I am making no judgment whatsoever about Mohammad and his wife, or about ancient Arab culture and marriage customs, but to marry before a child is physically capable of producing a child seems....contrary to the ancient and traditional reason for marriage, especially in that culture.<br>  <br>  Then again, it's still socially acceptable in that culture to marry girl children off to older men, although usually they stay at home with her parents until they are of age.  Each culture has its own way to deal with such things, and judging another culture by our own culture's rules is patently foolish.|`|dFrMhJxUaa	I know that back in the old times that young women would marry at 12 - 14 (source below). Even King Tut became pharaoh at nine years old and married his sister (source below).<br>   <br>  While on the Mohammad's marriage; Marry the mother of Jesus was pregnant at age 12-14.<br>  <br>  But back then, they had a high morality rate, they younger you start have children and the more children you have, the more chances your children will live on and pass on the family name.<br>  <br>  Maybe people don't want to accept the truth, or just in denial; I don't know why people want to deny human history.

jPt4iwICaa	I never debated that, and I've been doing both and never regretted it. I don't think you should make any decisions as translating can often be done as a side activity, at least if you're a freelance translator/interpreter. So if you start as a teacher, an interesting translation job may come your way which you can always do from home. Similarly, you may start as a translator, and an opportunity presents itself to become a teacher or give someone private tuition, so why would you reject it? <br>  <br>  I think it's all a matter of preference and your willingness to spend a few extra hours working instead of relaxing. I've never considered my job an obligation and I've had the best of both worlds, both teaching and translating. <br>  <br>  I must say I didn't translate much right after I graduated, I somehow preferred teaching as it provided closer contacts with other people, and I'm a people person, not a loner. But as the time goes by, I find translating a very rewarding job too, quite different from teaching, but also rich in challenges and dynamics. <br>  <br>  When you're translating, you're in your own microcosmos, and you feel like on a quest, searching for best solutions and solving problems every step of the way.<br>  <br>  When you're teaching, you're in a two-way street in which you teach and learn at the same time and the best reward is seeing your students change and witnessing their personal growth. <br>  <br>  So unless you have to, don't choose one over the other, but try to spend some time in both professions before you decide what's best for you.|`|MceGkk3naa	Wow!  While I know on the surface language is equally important to these two professions, it is important to consider your personality and other strengths because the day to day activities are very different.

Sometime the communication in places like this, people fail to input things in the computer for the next person to realize that you were already changed for things.  Its always good in the future to keep a journal for just the Vet visits and state dates/times and the like and who you spoke to, to keep track of billings and fees and promises.

qEdhPD8Laa	I don't know the best websites to read about him, but you can find out that stuff from a Google serach. Much of what I know about Loki is from personal interaction with him. I know that's not what you're looking for, but it's a different perspective.<br>  <br>  Some sources say he was originally a minor fire deity. Since he's usually shown with red hair, this makes sense to me. In myth he was thought to be the son of a Frost giant and a witch, not even one of the Aesir gods, but he became blood-brother to Odin and was accepted amoung the Aesir as one of them. Because of his "dual citizenship", so to speak, with the Aesir and the giants, he was sometimes a messenger and deal-maker between them. In myth, he sometimes caused strife between the Aesir and the giants, but he also solved problems for the Aesir when they couldn't figure out solutions for themselves.<br>  <br>  Loki is both a Tricker diety (like Ananzi and Raven) and a traveler/messenger between the worlds (like Hermes and Legba). Deities who are associated with bounderies and passages between the worlds are often trickters and may show ambiguous gender. (Loki hates it when people mention his gender issues, but it's a well documented part of his mythology. In myth, he disguised himself as a woman on several occations and even gave birth to the 8-legged horse Sleipneir when he was in the form of a mare.) He's a classic Trickster and shape-shifter (like Coyote).<br>  <br>  I think Loki gets a bad rap for being deceitful and evil, when he's not really a bad guy. He's thoughtful and crafty, much like Odysseus. Compaired to a more action-oriented deity like Thor, he seems sneaky and deceitful. Yet, his ability to lie and trick people, giants and gods was often a trait the Aesir needed. Pagan deities are seldom all good or all bad, since they represent archetypes of nature and human nature. When Loki's craftiness was helpful, it was viewed as a good trait. When it was harmful, it was viewed as a bad trait.<br>  <br>  I don't know if this side of his character comes out in mythology or not, but Loki is always doing stuff that others wouldn't dare to do. He breaks rules and crosses boundaries. He causes trouble and gets into trouble. He teases and makes fun of authority figures, including the gods. He challenges people and makes them think outside their boxes. He's like a friend who jokes, plays pranks, tells great stories about other people, and is always getting in trouble himself.<br>  <br>  In myth, Loki is the father of Hel (goddess of Death), Fenris the wolf, and the Midgard Serpent.|`|YXGdwwTJaa	Trickster god of mischief, but also wise, if troublesome.<br>  <br>  Look up some of his antics in Norse mythology.|`|0l9YOgkBaa	Loki,the Norse god of mischief was constantly involved in the Norse gods'  life.

(Read the book of Genesis) The plan was perfect....never die, no sickness, no pain until humans (Adam and Eve) ate of the tree of which God commanded them not to and committed sin. (Once again read Genesis) Sin entered the world and God had to make a new perfect plan. The death of His Son Jesus Christ (who committed no sin) on the Cross to redeem all the people who sinned (every freakin one). <br>  Romans 5:19- Just as through the disobedience of the one man the many were made sinners, so also through the obedience of the one man the many will be made righteous.<br>  Eventually there will be a New Earth without sin once again.

1ef686c0598e504e901a03134164b07faa	Since you are the hostess this dilemma may be avoided in the future. Instead of having them serve themselves, serve the first helping. If after that some people are showing interests in seconds, politely make a request that they not take more than necessary. It is not rude on your part but on theirs if they cannot heed to your request. As a guest it is their responsibility to respect you and your home. You cannot compel a person to thank you. Just make a note of it as you have, perhaps make mention of your culture and how waste effects you. It can be useful conversation, almost fable like because in the end, there is a moral.<br>  <br>  I avoid leftovers by making enough to satisfy as a meal. If there are leftovers it is usually from a large soup, stew or pasta. All of which can be reheated an consumed again. I also have a vaccum sealer which I use for everything, soup too.I do not waste food, even when I go out.|`|08d3778f46ccb1088efa36be8edafa91aa	Yes, it would be rude. You can talk in general terms about how food should not be wasted, giving all the reasons you have given.<br>  One thing you can try at smaller parties is to serve people. Ask them what they want and take a plate and serve them smaller portions of whatever.|`|593f5a959e494d93b72266dbf2f2bd3faa	when they finnish eating, excuse yourself and take all the "waste" into the bedroom where all of their coats are laying. stuff the "waste" into their pockets, this way they take it home and it is not wasted..no need to thank me, i'm here to help.|`|1JtnI4SEaa	Why not serve them yourself? Then you can give each person an equal amount and slightly eliminate the amount that won't be tossed in the trash once the meal is done.|`|QQ8p7e1Vaa	i say, try joking around with them. it will be easier to then be more stern about it later|`|7gH7sgi6aa	Even though I can understand where you are coming from unfortunately you are now in America and that might truly offend some people.  If you do not want to have people over for dinner and let them eat in the normal American fashion then I recommend you have them over for cocktails and dessert.  It will be less stressful on you and you won't have to think about offending anyone.  As you would expect others to respect your culture in your country, you must now do so here, even if it is wrong.<br>  Even though you thoughts are wonderful, and I for one bless my food, and am very thankful, there are many greedy and unthankful people out there who would be offended if you said that.  Good luck.<br>  Peace, Love & Happiness|`|d4fdcfd497acff42297153ae1caa813eaa	I would say they are not too wise because I would jump at the chance to take home leftovers. You must be willing to put up with this if you have big dinners. I would stop having the dinners but if that is what you like to do I probably would put a sign up at the buffet line. Just make a joke about it. Also, put all their leftovers in a tupperware container and eat them or feed to the pets. Colming out and telling the guests may come off as rude. Just tell your close friends about how you notice Americans stuffing their faces, heeee. I was brought up to finish everything on my plate so I know where you are coming from.|`|nqMAUOwsaa	There's a saying: 'our eyes are bigger than our stomachs.'<br>  <br>  If you're inviting people over I really don't think you should say anything about wasted food.  But on the other hand, when you're invited out for dinner, the polite thing to do is try to minimize you're food waste.<br>  <br>  Solution:  Don't invite these people over for dinner, or at least less frequently.|`|YkseyT7zaa	We really don't appreciate how well we have it. A lot of people, not all do not understand what it's like to be without. We think it will always be there.

What you are saying doesn't translate in the US.<br>  When I was a kid I had to eat EVERYTHING on my plate... but now I just eat until full (we use to be told there are children starving in china)  Well what I eat /don't eat does not benefit ANYONE in china, Japan, Africa..etc.<br>  <br>  If it is in a restaurant then there should be someone to serve the food and they can be told you are welcome to come back for more.<br>  <br>  Yes taking too much is wrong/ not eating what you took is wrong...<br>  but I know that I have taken food that when I took the first bite ... that was all I wanted..it didn't taste good / I got full etc.<br>  <br>  AS regards manners... boy that is a topic... really hard to teach people when their own parents didn't teach them.<br>  <br>  good luck with this... it's not going to change... in your own home you can serve the food (in small portions) and then allow them 2nds if you want.  <br>  good luck|`|38f1f2503fc6c449546776a1a667e539aa	My parents come from Europe. They grew food on the farm and labored intensively. They had certain things like oranges for CHristmas and this was like heaven to them. Food is highly revere and respected.<br>  <br>  My parents taught me to only take from the tray how much I can eat on my plate. Also, save food for others who might come home late. The rest that is uneaten we will use for leftovers the next day. <br>  <br>  God bless the food, so it should not go to waste I agree.<br>  <br>  However, I would not in my own home tell people not to waste food. <br>  <br>  Let's say someone found a dish spicy, or wayyy to hot, and could NOT eat it. Or they got sick, or they simply was allergic to the meal you prepared and that's why it was left on the plate..... Who knows. But if they just overstuffed themselves and left it there, then that would be rude.<br>  <br>  Please out of grace do not say anything.<br>  <br>  I had one friend who brought over a box of chocolates to me as a gift, and then she asked if she could eat it, and so she did until the whole box was gone. Was she selfsih and rude? Yes.|`|3d2dbfe624a4971313c2e9183de21b00aa	slightly yes! <br>  but if you state that upfront prior to eating as you stated then i don't see any issues with it! <br>  more so if you pressent it as how you feel instead of pointing fingures! <br>  <br>  so if you said don't waste food that would be rude! <br>  <br>  if you said if you happen to put more on your plate than what you end up eating i have doggy bags! <br>  <br>  But as stupid as it is there are diets plans out there and other times when peoples eyes are bigger then their stomaches and they dont finish their plate! <br>  <br>  you could just start getting doggy bags for them without asking! <br>  that way if they do waste the food it's not in your home! <br>  <br>  i so feel you and i'm guilty of wasting my self!  <br>  But it;'s all in the presentation!  <br>  <br>  <br>  I guess i toss my food sometimes because there isn't enought to safe and frankly i can't get over the mental issues i have about spit touching my food if i think about it before eating i can't eat! and Left overs might have spit on it!  well if it was on my plate! -- <br>  odd  i know i would love to eat with no lights on!  and no thought in mind!  i mean i have a hard enought time drinking from the same glass as my soon to be husband! <br>  and if i have lipstick on and take a drink and see it on my cup or what not i can't drink it! <br>  i think i have issues!  man!  Oh well!!  <br>  but most the time i do save them i won't throw them out unitll there is mold on it!|`|6f812b070bb6a7494447f70abb1119fdaa	Yes, in "this" culture it would be rude.  Your parents are from a different culture and you cannot force your personal culture and customs on your guests.  It would be like telling them they have to belch to show their appreciation when we were all raised that it was rude and to do so is ghastly.  So, while I think your reasons are admirable and justified (most of us don't waste food), the culture of your guests must be respected because... they are your guests.  In the finer American culture, guests must be made to feel welcome and comfortable, not issued rules and restrictions.|`|SsfnitjXaa	In some cultures it is considered rude to finish everything on your plate,  it indicates that the person may have needed more and went away hungry.  Those places that have starving people also have governments that are fat cats (coming soon to the USA by the way).  <br>  <br>  Why not ask if your guest would like to take home their left overs, or how about setting out smaller plates to begin with.

Since I didn't know better, I stayed with it until I was 21, and had just returned from a mormon mission.<br>  I had "issues" with the mormon church (and religion in general) from about the age of 12 on, but as everyone around me was mormon and my whole life was wrapped up in it, I kept my mouth shut and just assumed I hadn't receieved enough of a "testimony" yet.  After 2 years of a mission, I came home and immediately left the church, never to return.

Yet, during my early childhood, I was indoctrinated into christianity.  Fortunately, I was also taught good principles for my education, which was to question everything.  When put into practice, I discovered through research that there was absolutely no evidence to support the existence of the christian god, and later, after more research, any gods.<br>  <br>  From that day of realization, I reverted, or rather, deconverted to being an atheist again.|`|355JLlcLaa	I became one.<br>  <br>  I realised in mid-teenage that faith was based upon nothing but itself, that science explained nature satisfactorily without needing supernatural beings, and that religious beliefs were no different to those of ancient beliefs in gods and goddesses. <br>  <br>  When I first had doubts about my faith - I was Catholic - I thought that maybe this was a test of my faith. So I made the effort to accept it even more so. But the doubts came again, and I wondered what would happen if we took faith out of the equation; the world and nature still made sense, so I saw no reason to get back into it. At the time this was difficult intellectually and emotionally (I was a teenager, after all).<br>  <br>  That was getting on for 40 years ago, and my escape from faith has freed me to embrace what science has to offer, which I consider far more plausible than belief in the supernatural, and is the nearest we can get to the truth about how nature and the universe work. I've felt a sense of freedom ever since.<br>  <br>  I still have an interest in religions, mythology and related matters, and am fascinated that people still believe in things that to me are just not true.|`|mVsWyu0yaa	I was a Christian until I started to REALLY study the bible and the scriptures of other religions; that sent me into a 20 year period of atheism.  I've mellowed a bit, over the years, and now accept the "possibility" of a universal Creator...but one who has NOTHING in common with the gods of Scripture...ANY Scripture; for no god capable of creating anything as vast, and only partly comprehensible, as the still expanding universe could be as petty, vain, and murderous of the gods presented in man's scriptures.|`|R7tr1umSaa	I guess I sort of became one. I was born into a very non-religious family, and my mom let me decide if I wanted to go to synagogue or not. I chose to, and for two or three years, I went. But I never really got the whole god belief. I mean, my dad was an agnostic and my mom was sort of a believer, so I did believe when I was little and when my mom had a stronger belief. But when I went to Hebrew School and learned more about it, I became more and more skeptic of the whole idea. So, yes, I became one.|`|7K2HVodhaa	I became one. I was never a STRONG believer to begin with but after I put a little bit of thought into, I realized that it was all bollocks. I was always interested in archeology, history, astronomy, etc. and it never fit in with religion too well.|`|41db5b486612d71aef27d2e88a94662caa	Hard to say, really.<br>  At one point, I remember actually hoping that something/someone was out there.<br>  However, the reality is that it's just very, very, very unlikely.|`|CC7G2eGGaa	I was raised Presbyterian, and became an Atheist around the time I was 6 years old. I was an Atheist for 8 years, but after I turned 14, I became Wiccan.|`|LsG95WF8aa	Im 15 and i became an atheist about 4 or 5 years ago. I never really believed in god, and the thought of him scared me. I thought of him like a dictator and ghost if anything to be honest. lol|`|Aa6XHuENaa	I was agnostic during my childhood.<br>  <br>  Then I realized that just because you can't disprove something isn't a reason to believe in it.  I mean, I can't prove that Batman doesn't exist either...|`|b94573ef3c2d94b3f4ddd867c8a6cc47aa	Everyone is born atheist.. but are brainwashed by most of our parents. =/ <br>  Hopefully the newer generations will not be as brainwashed...|`|AA11691781	That's nice.  I became a person.  I don't really care about religion, seeing as all it is is people yelling at each other that their imaginary friend or lack thereof is the best.|`|AA12380601	I was a hard-core Southern Baptist until I was about twenty.  Then I grew up.|`|CwGbxa5Aaa	I became one.  I never paid attention in church when my parents took me as a kid and I didn't see how it made any sense that there was a god.|`|P8dIznazaa	No, I'm a born-again.  I converted from (very lax) Catholicism.|`|hii5wweQaa	we are all born atheist it's are up bringing that messes with us but it's ok we got better|`|4BdLhSMPaa	i became one<br>  when you are young, you are open to the first convincing opinion that is given to you<br>  when I was about 12, I realized that it didn't make sense.|`|MFcSwTFpaa	There is no such thing as a religious child.  We all start out without beliefs.  It is only by indoctrination that we become religious.  education is the cure for the religious delusion.|`|ze6CbvCeaa	I somewhat believed in god as a child, but I became an atheist at about 13-14.|`|XoUfUl6Yaa	People are born without religion.
4nAVWEjhaa	I would not call suicide a sin but it is a cop out and a very selfish act.|`|1d6eaa16f21b08eb6d2375e33be4155caa	Everything we experience we interpret based on all of our life experiences and how we wish to see them. There is an existence that will heal and and remove all of the pain that your question reveals once you open your self to God's Love. <br>  Suicide? God gives us free will to choose what we wish to experience here and hereafter. There is no hell, there is only what we create with our unlimited Selves.|`|qmzJg3DMaa	God gives you a life and you are supposed to cherish it.  If you follow him and live a life where you make good choices, you will feel better.  God doesn't hate you.  God Gave you free will and your life is what you make of it.<br>  God has never left you, he is always with you and will never give up on you.|`|BV6Jfal5aa	What do You mean god hates you, listen i will tell you this in a muslims point of view.  I was put on this earth AllAH brought down the holy QURAN the most beautiful book ( I advise you to read it).  This life is a test and ALLAH is helping us with it by bringing down the QURAN it teaches you how to live your life in the best way possible.  He also sent the greatest man to walk this earth prophet MOHAMED PEACE AND BLESSINGS BE UPON HIM.  Why even sudjest suicide dont even put that in your head.  If ALLAH hated us then he would of made drinking, audultry, killing ok and that would suck.  ALLAH has created us in the best way has given us blessings that we can't count.  Thank AllAH for what he has given you be patient and don't question the authority of god because thats dangerous. peace be to you and may ALLAH guide you and all towards the right path.<br>  If you have any questions please email me.|`|49c1ed9541d154d45ed38796a9a07ec3aa	where did you get this information ,,god nope there is none do you know how i know ,,someone told me i choose to believe them because there is no proof of god ,,the bible a story book made up by man ,,a man that has a lot to answer for according to it most of the natural things we do are wrong ,,dirty or whatever cats dogs horses animals in general why dont they have a book they can have mastrubate in the middle of your sitting room and its nature ,why are we superior to them makes us feel less guilty when we eat and abuse them,you get me dont believe this **** if their is a god let him answer for this chaos or piss off because we have much more reason to hate him if in and i say ifin he s behind these morals made by man,,suicide i can imagine alot of senarios like being in immense pain and wanting to die ,,im gonna do it or should i suffer on with a belief that he want me to be in pain he wants me to be in pain and im sopposed to love him get my drift dont follow the sheep,,,and guys he asked a question we all think about he did nt say he was going to jump off a cliff its a good question he deserves a proper answer|`|eeQSrlG5aa	he loves you and he created a world that was perfect however the devil created sin therefore the world as a result! deal with and make the best of it! and generally if you live good then heaven awaits! duh|`|UgMyitRbaa	God loves us, he hates no one. <br>  God has created us all so he has the right to put us on earth,<br>  If you had made a card you would have the right to give it to whoever you like.|`|CMjSkDOMaa	You really want support for your belief or way you are feeling? Read "sinners in the Hands of an Angry God" by John Edwards. That'll make you wonder for sure.|`|bFLVPIkaaa	moron.God put you here to give you a chance and test if you worthy <br>  or not also it not your body you burying it from God.|`|AA11346438	you have the creator mixed up with religion, which is pretty common.|`|MDkEiaTFaa	Oh dont be silly. God is a construct of the mind. The real question is why do you hate yourself so much?|`|AIxiv9uyaa	last time i checked God loves us thats why theres a heaven if we choose Gods way of love|`|LxTfeqVpaa	I`m with you mate.I am wondering the same.....|`|ffb16e0ffc6a4152dbf3d94c25cd5995aa	If you really want to know why not go to the source(Bible). Get one and read it, then you'll know once and for all.|`|2c7869fbf2bfda8e590501ddb5545f2caa	oh dont be silly.  u just need to be strong to get through life. its not all bad.  think of good things too|`|0yTM98Odaa	I know what you mean, it's either like that and God hates us! or what Christianity says about God isn't actually true....I'm not going to go with Christian beliefs about God not being true!|`|ZNRYqss9aa	Ok being human we are like sheep (I have a strong dislike for human natural) if one person does something then others will follow. If 'God' lets say didn't put us on earth then you wouldn't even have to write that question. I think we are here for a reason but being the dumb animals we are it will take us another age till we work it out or another animal works it out.|`|4769b530e02572d6a0c84645a6d398cfaa	Ok, if you believe in God or not, this is has nothing to do with him. YOU decide how you want to live, and what you want to live for. If you're unhappy, then do something that makes you happy. Not everyone hates you, maybe you do things that people don't understand? Maybe you should travel and see the world and meet people who share your interests. And nobody forces you to live your life. If you want to live on earth miserably, that's your problem. What you should be concerned about is why you're hated and unhappy and feel forced to live & then fix it.|`|WhUV9k6Jaa	It's okay.  There is much more to the world than the things you hate.  Hating all the time is an exhausting enterprise I wouldn't recommend continuing.  I don't know your circumstances but surely there is something in this world you enjoy or love.  Begin with that and be thankful for it, then try extending that attitude.|`|jBYxEX8taa	God doesn't hate us.<br>  <br>  This world is temporary, it wasn't designed to be perfect. It's a place where we can choose to be with God or not. If you want to commit suicide, that's a choice you make. You can either face your problems and come out victorious, or you can drown in your sorrows. <br>  <br>  And the world doesn't hate you. You're just looking at the bad side of the world. There is alot of good in the world aswel.|`|XmD61yBpaa	Have you ever taken the view that maybe there is no such thing as God? If you did, your perspectives would change, believe me; stop trying to lay the blame at the feet of others.|`|UJtUpWO0aa	Andy, I think the bigger question you should be asking is, " Why do you hate life so much?"   No rallyy, when we seen someone this distraught I have to ask if something happened in the person's life that brought him or her to the point of destruction or questioning their existence.  <br>      You have to understand that many of us have suffered great pains in our lives, either early or later in life.  But there should be some type of healing process or acceptance process that allows us to move on and get past the anger, confusion and even hatred.  There should be no reason for someone just to cause someone to mention suicide unless they have had some traumatic life experience happen to them.  And then when we see this action continue, it is usually because the victim cannot or will not move on for  some reason or another.<br>       If you want to contact me Andy, I'd be happy to share experiences with you in the event that you have had some great catastrophe or trauma happen to you. It is important for you to understand that this feeling is not normal for the average abused human.|`|qkCFLgaSaa	Let me give you a little inside information about God. God likes to watch. He's a prankster. Think about it. He gives man instincts. He gives you this extraordinary gift, and then what does He do, I swear for His own amusement, his own private, cosmic gag reel, He sets the rules in opposition. It's the goof of all time. Look but don't touch. Touch, but don't taste. Taste, don't swallow. Ahaha. And while you're jumpin' from one foot to the next, what is he doing? He's laughin' His sick, f***en' azz off! He's a tight-zz! He's a SADIST! He's an absentee landlord! Worship that? NEVER!  LOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|eCp0ERSCaa	I would disagree with your claim that this place (the world? the universe?) is a place that I hate or that hates me. I love my life, even if some circumstances are undesirable. Also, gods are not real, so relax.|`|DArAz67Caa	suicide is a sin-----I do not advocate it----nor does God----|`|AA11707311	Once you figure out that God loves you, you may get around to making yourself righteous.|`|iHDYncuXaa	It doesn't sound like God hates you. It sounds more like you hate you.|`|d1CiQRNCaa	we are only toys for his satisfaction.|`|F6ENoUMkaa	Sounds like you hate yourself

o0oYsQM7aa	Many believe that your filters are lowered while using recreational narcotics. I am one of them.<br>  <br>  I've never noticed a ghost while drunk, but have seen many ghosts while on LSD. And not just me but the whole group I was with has seen these things. I grew up in N. GA. near a confederate cemetery. Without any cues from anyone in the group we have witnessed things that had to be real, for the simple fact, that everyone saw it.<br>  <br>  My wife says that they are not ghosts, but that they are angels or demons moving through our world. Ghosts, angels, demons, higher lifeforms on a different plane of existence, whatever they are, I am convinced that they are real.<br>  <br>  And at first it scared me white! Then I began to get used to such things and tried unsuccessfully to communicate.|`|yqqemaFQaa	many many times but never have been so high as to believe they are true . our minds see my friend ,not our eyes . if your mind is temporarily ****** then you can see ****** up things. what is the religious freaks excuse for their "experiences" i guess some people don't need drugs to get high they are borne high with a permanently ****** up mind<br>  my ussuall reaction would be "that is fantastic give me more"|`|JQ8DgG3baa	well, one time when i was TRYING to sleep after a night of wiggin (if thats what they still call it) the devil himself reached his arms up from my bed, wrapped them around my stomach and began pulling me down...into the bed.... yeh, i laid off the x after that one.... peace!|`|epsUr7d4aa	naw but i saw a lerchaun once and  i fell in the bath tub rofl<br>  no joke|`|LRH9Em0yaa	Uhm?

NsLtN7oLaa	Anyone in the public sector, especially dealing<br>  with kids from a cross section of society, will<br>  run into all the usual worst-case biases. The<br>  Christian parents will often be very intolerant,<br>  and the school board will usually give in to them<br>  rather than have to deal with the controversy. <br>  Then there are the low class trash and rednecks <br>  who have zero knowledge and just need someone <br>  to hate... so you'll be an easy target.<br>  <br>  The funny thing is that in ancient times we often <br>  functioned as Shamans, Priestesses, teachers <br>  and healers... and we were highly valued for that. <br>  However, when the Christians took over, they wanted <br>  those jobs for themselves, so they mass-murdered <br>  the transsexuals and to this day they continue to <br>  teach people that we are sick and evil.  That, to a<br>  large extent, is the root of our problems.<br>  <br>  I solved the work issue by starting a home business<br>  where I never meet anyone or go anywhere. That<br>  works out quite well. Nobody knows anything about<br>  me, and I avoid all prejudice.<br>  <br>  Blessings,<br>  <br>  Jean|`|GrhBvUEEaa	Why does it bother you. (don't say you don't have a problem with it or is not bothered because you are here asking a question about it) I'm not getting defensive or anything, just, i see parents get heated up over the smallest things. Like when i worked in a hair salon, this mother would not let me wash her daughters hair just because i am gay. I'm still a human being, he/she is the is a human and deserve to be given a chance than to be judged. How would you like it if you wanted to be a teacher in a homosexual community but you were rejected because all the parents did not want to have a heterosexual person teaching their children?Again, i'm sorry if it seem like i'm ranting or something, just, make sure your discrimination is based on something major like a teacher with TB teaching Lupus children. you know something that threaten your child's safety. some ones sexual preference or their sex (whether natural or not) should no be a factor to remove a teacher or a disturbance.|`|hZiwiboRaa	I don't think the teachers would mind...<br>  But may get some unwanted attention from the kids..<br>  Ask this in teaching section and see what responses you get there might be interesting to see the results.|`|MT1498npaa	I wouldn't mind.|`|ZzWQHOWWaa	No, it wouldn't bother me in the least. It would be the same as anyone else.<br>  <br>  No, but it would bother me if the school board refused to hire a teacher because that person was transsexual.<br>  <br>  No, and I don't think it should matter to anyone. People seem to believe that being transsexual is something that children can be influenced into. That's as ridiculous as "gay teachers are going to make our kids gay". I think most people are in desperate need of education when it comes to transsexual/transgender individuals.<br>  <br>  I'm so sorry about your job situation.|`|HyknijLxaa	well i think that the answers you get in this section will be positive biased towards being OK with a transsexual as a teacher because it is the LGBT section lol. Post this question in something like the Parenting section and see some different answers as well as these answers.|`|EfifnL7Taa	It's fine. I don't mind (well, I wouldn't mind if I had kids I mean). But telling them is a different matter. For high-school kids, I guess I would be ok. But for young ones, like year 1 or 3, I wouldn't want them to know until they grow up.|`|61c8oevtaa	No,I wouldn't care in the slightest.<br>  <br>  I actually wouldn't send my child to any school that refused to hire a teacher due to gender orientation.<br>  <br>  =]|`|aWPmvPpfaa	no, but i'm transexual...|`|CvDzpQREaa	no, no and no.|`|TANWVanxaa	no i wouldn't mind|`|ROVhLgH7aa	as long as my child comes home with good grades to enter college, i could care less|`|3OZgcntfaa	It would only bother me if they were a truly horrific teacher who could not educate students. I doubt that would have anything with being trans though...<br>  <br>  I think teachers who transition on the job should be given a school year (or at least a semester) medical leave so there isn't such a drama surrounding their transition. It bugs me when I read in the news people forming "think of the children" or "we are uncomfortable with this situation" opinions in regards to people who work with or around youth transitioning.<br>  <br>  I used to be a camp counselor, I didn't transition at work but there were plenty of kids who could see that I am trans long before adults could. Children aren't stupid, and they aren't shocked or afraid of people who are different. It's adults that freak out and make it into a big deal.|`|z0vkw1Wqaa	As someone wanting to get into teaching, this question seems really interesting.<br>  <br>  Personally I wouldn't mind at all, in fact it would show that the school have hired someone based on their credentials over something like that. I don't think it's an issue of age or subject, as long as they were right for the job. A lot of discrimination issues start at the younger end of the scale which can develop into really strongly held opinions later on. <br>  <br>  However, I don't have any children and might not be the best person to answer this!|`|iSvDvFneaa	I'm not having children, but I wouldn't mind at all if the teacher was transsexual : )<br>  I'd be a little scared for the teacher though, because she or he would probably get made fun of regardless of grade she or he taught.|`|HtKKcq98aa	I hate a Tran's history professor. She was pretty good at what she taught, her appearance was a bit out there but it didn't really bother me too much once i got used to her|`|xf695nUSaa	Id be kinda bothered, but i would try not to judge them. If their a good teacher then i wouldnt care.|`|oVeGMNsLaa	Nope, nope, and nope.<br>  <br>  I WOULD take issue if a teacher needed to take a long time off for surgery and recovery, especially at the younger ages, because I've seen firsthand how much it hurts children's education when their regular teacher is gone for a while and they have to make due with a substitute.  They need stability and someone who can be there for the entire year.<br>  <br>  But other than that, I have no problem with transfolk as teachers.  In fact, one of the saddest things I ever heard was that Morty Diamond- an FtM man who makes FtM porn- was possibly the victim of discrimination.  His wife, who is a teacher, had her job in jeopardy when a colleague found out he was trans and made porn. :(|`|sS1jlF2naa	It wouldn't bother me at all.
UrYYKkGoaa	Multi-purpose national organisations would include The United Way and The Red Cross as noted. Tamil Grassroots Youth is an example of grassroots youth development. Christian Youth Group is an example of a religious youth group. Shriners is an example of youth programs conducted by adult service clubs. YouthCanada is a public sector youth group.|`|94P7B7YZaa	How about the red cross unit?
WYk0zYdhaa	It is a true conundrum lol.  I don't think there is a lesser of the two.<br>  <br>  As a Christian to have biblical knowledge is essential and yet you have to be able to practice that in your own life or there is no point.  However, to have only practice meaning going and standing on the corner to evangelize and not having the knowledge you would surely lead others astray or turn them away with misunderstanding.|`|4BdLhSMPaa	practice without knowledge.<br>  for example, if you knew nothing about an extreme sport, like skiing, then you could really hurt yourself, and not learn anything from it|`|AA11346438	it depends on what the practice is|`|iJRsJUBmaa	ok  how do we practice without knowledge|`|1d6eaa16f21b08eb6d2375e33be4155caa	knowledge with practice is what we put into motion when we begin to experience the true essence of being. It leads to all answers  and ends the never ending questioning that plaque the unenlightened.|`|mggll8dRaa	No Knowledge, or Poor Knowledge....!!|`|A01w1dHqaa	What we practice we know. That is how we know we know it.
h5e62x6Kaa	My fondest memory was this date two years ago. February 26, 2007. I was in love with a friend, and we were playing basketball in the rain, and getting soaked by the pouring rain. I remember I was working on a science project and she decided to stay back with me to keep me company that day. I was a bit nervous around her and was feeling pretty jittery on the inside. Butterflies I guess. Mm, I decided to take a break from my science project, and went outside to play with the basketball that I brought to school everyday. It was cold and pouring outside, but I still went. When I got to the courts, I saw that she was right behind me and I asked her what she was doing, and I began shooting. And there were puddles everywhere when I ran after the ball that was rolling away into the water puddles. I toss her the ball and we began shooting around, and talked a bit. I got to know her a bit better, and when we got inside, we were both soaking wet. And I was a bit cold. I continued working on my project as she ate a muffin that she had with her. We talked and I walked around to get stuff for my project. It was nice... I really liked her after that day. I knew I was falling in love, and when we decided to go home, it was almost dark. Also, that same week, I won first place for my science project. lol It was a good week... And I remember how she'd mention about that day to me every once in awhile in the past. I still talk to her but not much. Like once a month maybe? She was the first girl I fell in love with. And we started to become closer friends after that day. x] Ah, love, love, love...|`|9EgipQk7aa	thats beautiful :)<br>  <br>  my fondest memory was meeting a girl that i didn't like at first, but who completely changed my life....for better or for worse, i dont really know....but it was a real eye-opener. i would not be who i am right now if it wasn't for her....not that any of you would understand :pp but still :)|`|cbY6NoHSaa	I miss having my daddy picking me up, im too big now.|`|x5nWWyylaa	My fondest memory<br>  being the brave one and making the first move kissing my first girl<br>  i miss <br>  her actually. shes fantastic.|`|SPQdFOwKaa	I miss when my parents took my sister and I to the sea and always told us not to swim at the deep waters, to always wear sunscreen and to never swim after having eaten ice-cream. Those were the greatest days ever. My family doesn't even gather for lunch on Sundays any more.
SsfnitjXaa	I don't get it.  Would not waste my time visting the mentioned site... because I don't get it.|`|VcrDOsFKaa	it doesn't make sense.....can just see a black screen with some backgroundless words and some silly man screaming.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?gl=IN&hl=en-GB&v=tRr8kI0LLRw" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?gl=IN&hl=en...</a><br>  now this is what a video should be like.|`|AA12116167	Well I really don't get the point of the video. The voice and words were well done, but the cuts where all you see is the back of a guy's head and hear something (a scream? an angry cat?) is weird. I don't get it. You should put something more interesting in there. Like is this a documentary of your life or something? put cuts of you doing different things, like of you about to get in to some sort of trouble...... Then it would be more interesting.

Some of the animals we see today are descendants of them, and have evolved and adapted to their ever-changing environment, and many of the animals we see today would never exist. For example, the polar bear and the black bear and both bears...but they have different traits to suit their environment. The polar bear has thick fur so it can survive in the cold, webbed feet so it can swim, and is white so it can camoflauge against the snow...and the black bear has its own traits to survive in the forest...but basically, the proof is there.|`|9XAqnmOQaa	Fact.

I'm a strong Christian but I don't block evolution completely out--as far as I'm concerned it's a theory, not fact, not fiction. The Bible says that God created the universe and all it's inhabitants in seven days, right? How do people--lowly humans--know how much a day is to God? For all we know it could be billions of years each! I don't know this part for sure, because I just skimmed my Bible to help with this answer, but I don't think it says what God made man out of, either. It COULD very well be from a monkey or whatever Darwin thinks we came from. No one is able to know for sure. So, now that I've rambled, to answer your question, "why do some people not believe evolution" I think it's that they were taught to think against it.|`|ede03e3f3d0f9724bf8ab35b7949daafaa	Evolution is not fact.

Evolution is a theory and a "Scientific" fact. Let me explain<br>  You said a theory is something that has proof but can not be seen with the naked eye. So since we can not live long enough to see the actual process happen it is a theory. It is a "Scientific" fact because in science it is considered a fact so we can all get on to bigger and better things. I could argue philosophically that we have not change from your mud puddle ancestors. We still kill, eat dead things, reproduce, try to make ourselves seem better than we are to get mates. I agree with the theory of evolution, but i feel in this universe there are no real facts. It's possible that this could all be just a computer simulation just for you. Or you could be a figment of my imagination and I could yours. Whats reality, whats real? I agree gravity is seen as a fact, but we have found that before the singularity (everything in the universe crammed into a size smaller than the smallest part of an atom) gravity does not apply or even exist in it's current form then. Same with other dimensions. So if gravity is not a fact it is just a marker we use so we can all have discussions and understand what the person is saying. These are all just words, the ideas behind them do not change if I call them by a different name. If this makes any sense. LOL|`|kX0T1urdaa	When I went to school a "theory" was an unproven idea. In all these years science has not provided enough facts to bring it out of the theory class.<br>  <br>  Evolution makes no sense. We evolve in how we think as we live and experience things. This has nothing to do with physical evolution and how we change to fit the environment. Animals in differenct environments survive there because it suits their physical needs. If the situation changes and their environment goes through a drastic change they die out, they do not evolve. That is called extinction. There is a lot of that going on these days.<br>  <br>  Actually we have not evolved much in our thinking since Genesis. They lived hundreds of years to take in the knowledge of the heavens, math, building and other things. Enoch was a master builder. It is only my opinion but I think he designed the pyramids.

Reptiles lay eggs and mammels generally give birth. (there are some exceptions like duckbilled platterpus) however out of reptiles and mamalls they either lay an egg or give birth. but no animal has been found that can link the two. an animal that does not lay an egg or give birth. <br>  <br>  so tell me half way through the evolution of mammals when they no longer laid eggs but had not evolved to give birth what did they do? a reptile is cold blooded but a mammel is warm blooded. so how did an animal keep warm. it can either be warm or cold blooded. so where is the link? mammals feed young from milk. but how did they feed their young before they could produce milk? <br>  <br>  there just are not the fossil evidence. that is why most links betwwen species are a theory so it can not be called fact.<br>  <br>  there is a difference between adaptation and evolution. what darwin observed was adaptaion. like the different shapped beaks of the finches he saw on the islands he visited. yes the finch had adapted different beaks for the environment. but the finch was still a finch.<br>  <br>  for example today, we have dogs. a dog could be a bulldog a spaniel or a boxer. but they are still dogs that have been adapted. this is natural. also cats, there are lions, tigers, leperads and domesticated pet cats. but evolution says a cat could become a dog! But no! no matter how much u breed a dog it can never become a cat!<br>  <br>  that is why evolution can only be called a therory. <br>  That IS true because i studied evolution for many years and we could never scietifically call it a fact. <br>  It is apealing to believe in evelotion because then there is no god to obey. but what happens when humans are left to survival of the fittest? we no longer have god given rights, and according to survival of the fittest we have the rights given to us be the alpha males. in this world it the govenments. therefore take away god and you take away our god given rights and are only left with government given rights.<br>  <br>  And the rights the government give the government can take away.|`|4OEOxOmPaa	It's a fact.

You have come to God, the judge of all men, to the spirits of righteous men made perfect, to Jesus the mediator of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood that speaks a better word than the blood of Abel.<br>  <br>  and he was also inspired to write at Romans 2:28&29; For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh: but he is a Jew who is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God.<br>  <br>  and then Peter was inspired to quote at Acts 2:21 the same thing Paul was inspired to quote at Romans 10:13... that is, what the prophet Joel was inspired to write at Joel 2:32; And it shall be that whosoever shall call upon the name of Jehovah shall be saved.<br>  <br>  Then, there is this Scripture as well: Isaiah 43:12; I have declared, and I have saved, and I have showed; and there was no strange god among you: therefore ye are my witnesses, saith Jehovah, and I am God.<br>  <br>  The evidence seems to suggest that Jehovah's Witnesses are restoring true worship. They are most likely the largest Christian organization that have removed all traces of pagan Roman traditions from their worship.|`|XCQDebdtaa	Read the book of Isaiah.

This was not strange, for, in the parable just preceding this one, he illustrated how imitation Christians in great numbers would be produced. He, like the sower of the fine wheat seed in the field, was sowing the figurative “fine seed,” the “sons of the kingdom.” However, as, in the parable, the enemy came by night when men slept and oversowed the same field with weed seed, or bearded darnel seed, so later on, when baptized professing Christians did not keep awake and on the watch against the invasion of error and pretenders, Satan the Devil would sow imitation Christians in among the true “sons of the kingdom.” This would call for a separation of the true from the false at God’s appointed time, in the “conclusion of the system of things,” where we find ourselves today<br>  Matthew 13:24-30, 36-43.|`|ZTPCOiJlaa	Fundie 4th r etc.<br>  <br>  Its a matter of history.

Don't be afraid of getting it wrong sometimes. First of all read the commandment about idols and no images and get rid of them.

da4zS4AOaa	Well statistics show African Immigrants are the smartest Immigrants followed by Asians and Indians.<br>  <br>  In an analysis of Census Bureau data by the Journal of Blacks in higher education, African immigrants to the United States were found more likely to be college educated than any other immigrant group. African immigrants to the U.S. are also more highly educated than any other native-born ethnic group including white Americans. Some 48.9 percent of all African immigrants hold a college diploma. This is slightly more than the percentage of Asian immigrants to the U.S., nearly double the rate of native-born white Americans, and nearly four times the rate of native-born African Americans.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://bluecafe669.blogtownhall.com/" rel="nofollow">http://bluecafe669.blogtownhall.com/</a><br>  <br>  African immigrants to the United States were found more likely to be college educated than any other immigrant group, which included those from Europe, North America and Asia (also see U.S. Bureau of the Census, 2000).

You're only talking about Africans straight from Africa, not the Africans already in the U.S., and have been in the U.S.<br>  <br>   Now, its true, there are many, many intelligent African Americans, though in all honesty their intelligence is covered up by their portrayal in the Media, which is true amongst most of the youth now. With in scholastic environment they appear as immature, rude, annoying punks who treat others like dogs and don't know how to talk properly, having no respect for their elders, and then put others down to make themselves look bigger and stronger amongst the others.<br>  <br>   If you try to block all the ugly things found in the world then that simply leaves you naive to the evil there really is. If you think African people are simply 'hard working and are portrayed as stupid' then you're think wrong, a lot of them make themselves look stupid because they think its cool.<br>  <br>   Now, don't be offended by what I say, I have a few African friends, as well as mixed friends. In fact, this attitude belongs to all of the ethnic groups out there, the young Hispanics/Latinos join gangs because it makes them look bad and tough, or so they think, and the young White Americans simply try to fit in with this, they themselves have nothing to cling to.

I felt the stroke a second time, but on my hand instead, and I could have sworn I heard someone say "Monkeydoodle".

LQ7rROMSaa	In Chicago, Illinois, there is a cemetery called Resurrection Mary on Archer Avenue. Many believe that it is named after the Virgin Mary, but many Chicagoans and those who live by the cemetery beg to differ. Many, many years ago, there was a dance at the Willowbrook Hall. A young lady, named Mary, attended the dance. She was alone since none of her friends could make it, but she loved dancing, so she decided to make the best of it. She met a young man, and they soon they began to dance and have a fun time. Around midnight, he offered to take her home. She agreed. They wanted to take the easiest and quickest way home: Archer Avenue. They drove by the cemetery, and talked about how spooky cemeteries were. As soon as they passed the gates, another car came towards their direction, and they were in a head collision. Mary was thrown out of the car and slammed onto the gates. Stories have it that Mary was buried by the gate, and that her hand prints are still imprinted.<br>  <br>  Another story goes on saying that Mary and her boyfriend got into a fight on prom night. He wanted to go drinking afterwards, but she didn't. He dropped her off at the cemetery, just like she asked. She said she 'wanted to be by dead people who were smart unlike living people who weren't'. She waited hours by the cemetery, saying prayers and admiring the flowers. She heard a car slowly coming down the path. She waited by the gate, hoping it was someone to pick her up. She noticed it was her boyfriend's car; and she noticed he wasn't stopping. Screaming, Mary tried running, but couldn't get the gate to open again. Her boyfriend, considerable drunk, drove the car right into her. Again, rumors say that her handprints are still on the gate, and that she is buried alongside the road. <br>  <br>  Whatever the story goes, it is indeed true a young woman named Mary died by the cemetery, and that she is buried there. The hand prints are supposedly still there, but the creepy part is that the owner of the cemetery put new gates in. Many different stories are said, but two things are always kept the same. <br>  <br>  My grandfather is buried there. The funeral director begged my grandma to use to back entrance instead of the front one, but my grandmother, who did not know the story, insisted the front one. Ever since then, my dad uses the back entrance while my grandma uses the front. When I told her of the story, she said she saw a young girl in white by the grandpa's grave, praying. Then she looked at her,waved, and said, "Everything will be okay." I never quite saw her myself, but I have seen the gates. I used to live in the townhouses down on Archer Avenue; and when I moved my parents finally told me the story. My mom has seen the young girl, too. She said she immediatly knew it was her, there was no doubt about it. My mom quietly said a prayer as she passed, and she saw the girl smiling, and almost mouthing the words, "Thank you."|`|21f607e2a108c7e5f56649beeb4de243aa	Well, I don't know if this is a famous one or not.

I have a friend named Kotori and she told me her name meant "pretty bird"..|`|Nbs6w3hLaa	Tori means bird. sorry i dont know the word for wings|`|e5KXd0Gkaa	Well I am very interested in Japanese, and I thought that I like people helping me when I need there help, so other people would probably want my help. Tori means bird, wing is the name of the mangaka of 'The law of ueki" (just trying to mess with your head, tsubasa means wing)|`|10bb153a928c9693ebec1b2660853526aa	鳥 (tori) = bird<br>  翼 (tsubasa) = wing(s)|`|AA10948829	Tori is bird.<br>  Wings is tsubasa or hane.<br>  Tsubasa is like an angel's wings while hane is like a bird's wing.
EpqSDAGyaa	Ahh we had the same issue. We moved into our apartment and a couple of months after I seen a roach, I was so mad. Anyway I went to the office and the apartment manager was all" maybe you brought them with you" anyway they sparyed at least 5 times but they keep coming back! I have a 14 month old! I hate it..Its so gross yuck. But anyway i told her that they were unfit living condidtions and she was all " as long as we are trying to get rid of them, then your case won't stand in court" after going back and forth with her, I gave up . Now we have about 2 weeks left in our lease and I can't wait to get the heck outta there but the only thing is the roaches may follow ;(. Anyway ask for a copy of your lease but mostly likely as long as they are trying to do something about it then there is nothing that can be done :/.
7q9MN1Wkaa	I have an obsession with Asian guys actually! Reason is that they have "finer" features. Much better-looking than most White guys I've seen. And less HAIRY. But that's just my own preference. They also smell nicer ; p. They are also less likely to be fat ( I like slim guys). I'm pretty small, so I don't want to be crushed by my BF.<br>  <br>  It's true that Asian guys are "smaller" down there. BUT they are much HARDER and know how to "work it" better than most White guys I've dated. Much better trade-off in my opinion. Unless you have a large or loose vagina. Hah! Sorry for being crude, but it's true.<br>  <br>  My BF is Chinese & he's GORGEOUS! Like one of those Taiwanese singers/stars. Long hair and everything!|`|GPznIhzMaa	haha I have some friends who have a preference for Korean guys because they like their baby faces, too.|`|o7AjgJZKaa	girl yes they are!<br>  <br>  look at him he is so cute!<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCTAqdDfL58&feature=channel_page" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCTAqdDfL...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXFCPUlGYEM&feature=channel_page" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXFCPUlGY...</a>|`|uLdmXx3faa	Eh, I like the manly asian guys better.<br>  I think they look hotter that way :]<br>  Baby faced sounds... well...babyish.<br>  which is something I'm not attracted to in any race.|`|IJgif2Czaa	big d: we can see the jealously seeping out of you like a flood...<br>  <br>  good job demonstrating the usual tactic of white/black guys...hate|`|denyKCABaa	You don't have weird taste.

They day you are conceived is they day you start to die.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	You know it is.|`|SDDgbtQ4aa	Every day you live, you are one day closer to your death.  Yes.  It's not rocket science.  But it's not really what one should dwell on either.  Live life and enjoy it - life's too short to waste it worrying about the inevitable.|`|nBGjPwViaa	Physically, yes.|`|YAoSgET5aa	TO LIVE IS TO DIE...|`|4OjLMQ6Yaa	yes, we die a little bit every day. Aging is part of the dying process.|`|YLqVv7Lzaa	Of course.<br>  <br>  With the standard of medicine we have now time is still a factor in determining when we will die, the average life expectancy is around 80 and no-one has lived past 120. Therefore the more time passes whilst we are a live the closer we are to death.<br>  <br>  But so what? The more time we spend thinking about dying the less time we can spend living, so you may as well enjoy it while it lasts.|`|AA11346438	NO! this is one of the many depressing phrases that people say that simply is not true. you don't start to die until the moment before you die. otherwise you're living.|`|IogJBs2Naa	Actually from the moment of conception you begin the journey towards death.|`|NmvaEmKBaa	More or less, but remember, only the good die young.<br>  <br>  So be bad, as long as possible!|`|MFcSwTFpaa	There is always a level of death in the process of life.|`|41db5b486612d71aef27d2e88a94662caa	Yes, you and I will die one day.|`|j7hxpwTdaa	i dont want to think of it that way|`|4nAVWEjhaa	yes

I hope you like them :)|`|VCz1CtiLaa	I've read a couple lesbian novels, but only one gay novel called If You Were Me, I was kinda like a far fetched romantic comedy.|`|aHLnNrOGaa	'Maurice' was good.

Bqoydq1Oaa	No meat on all Fridays of Lent, Ash Wednesday, and Good Friday for those over 14.<br>  (If you are in Canada, the no meat thing is only for Ash Wednesday and Good Friday, abstinence on the other Fridays of Lent are recommended but not required).<br>  Fasting on Ash Wednesday and Good Friday, with no meat for those over 18. 1 normal sized meals and 2 smaller meals as long as the 2 small meals don't total up to one regular sized meal.<br>  <br>  That's it. Giving up stuff like chocolate, TV, etc is optional.|`|WvzS59FKaa	Fast on the things that you really like to eat or love to do.  Such as fasting from sugar, desserts or from tv shows or music you love.  Being quiet and being more patient on situations is a form of fasting.  Or having more time and commitment for payer.<br>  <br>  The idea of fasting is a reminder of how God sacrificed for us, of carrying His cross and dying for us to redeem us from sin.  The choice to fast is to say "I believe in God and want to unite my sacrifice with Him"<br>  <br>  If you're a Vegan then how is not eating meat a fasting practice?|`|93galWG1aa	You can offer up any thing you want. It's to do with sacrifice there really is no rules. Meat is an old tradition for friday,s and for some Wednesdays.|`|AA10105819	No meat on Ash Wednesday, Good Friday, and all the Fridays of Lent. It's not a fast, just abstaining from meat, 'cause you can eat and drink anything else.|`|6JXrlnYsaa	If you're a Roman Catholic, then you know the answer to your question.<br>  If not, then stop lying and ask the question again.|`|c8d511b57b38b8ff3a19d1b90168fef3aa	everything you like - it you hate it, you can have it|`|VFWRdAH3aa	that is only on Ash Wednesday (yesterday) and all Fridays of Lent. all other days are fine.|`|AA11354028	As you've read, Ash Wednesday as well. However, You can only eat meat for the main meal of the day for every day of Lent (except for Sundays). So If dinner is your main meal, then you can have meat then. And over 21, you have to fast, which is two small meals and one main meals. <br>  God bless, have a good Lent!|`|PsN79isyaa	No meat on Fridays.<br>  <br>  That's all.  <br>  <br>  Peace.<br>  <br>  Related to this is do not change your appearance or boast that you are meditating more during Lent. Just live your life as usual, just add more focus to your faith. No one should see or know anything is different about you this time of year.|`|kX0T1urdaa	I am not a Catholic but a Catholic friend at work asked me that very question. I told her to fast the things that tempt her the most. Chocolate? Sweets? Meat? whatever your biggest weakness is in the food groups, fast that.|`|U26mmvieaa	Meat all Fridays. Anything else you give up is your choice.
Z2EzfQFvaa	Its not bad,its just stupid.Emo is just another stupid fad thing that is really popular with stupid people who can't think for themselves,and when the media and the world comes up with the next stupid thing,all the idiots will abandon it and like then new stupid thing.The first thing that pops in to their head is not that you cut yourself,the thing that comes to mind when you say your an emo,is that your a brainwashed zombie by the media,and your just a complete retard.|`|WNWKDw4uaa	No, I think Elmo is cute.|`|9O3prIUpaa	It makes you look really immature and unsure of yourself when you categorize yourself like that.<br>  "I'm a skater" works.<br>  Saying "I'm a preppy", or "I'm goth", or "I'm ghetto" makes you look dumb.<br>  Emo is just another label.<br>  You're limiting yourself.|`|wwdllMzYaa	no<br>  <br>  who cares what they think<br>  they dont know you, you do<br>  it doesnt really matter what they think about you, as scoeity and others insoceity will always judge you, even if you were perfect, beacuse soceity, doesnt like difference<br>  and we are all different<br>  so<br>  soceity doesnt liek anyone<br>  <br>  just get on with your life, be who you are, and ignore any rubbish from idiots and their judgments|`|hZiwiboRaa	I admire Emos/Scenes they like rock!<br>  Not sure about music choice but hay everyone different.<br>  But yes it really annoys me when people think they cut their wrists when they don't! (I'm not one) And i've never actually seen an Emo that<br>  actually has cut themselfs. And there is plenty at my school.|`|CvDzpQREaa	I'm not emo, yet I've cut myself a few times lol. ppl r dumb get used to it|`|73wr3Pn8aa	emo's are kl    i like them anyway   : )<br>  <br>  they are normally judge mental,    the word emo is normally refured to ppl who do cut themselfs, at are skl ppl just call us/them wanna b emo's (just look like emo's  with the hair and stuff)<br>  <br>  but there is NOTHING wrong with emo's, it is just other ppl who have the problem. <br>  <br>  i don't think you should take it to heart what they say<br>  <br>  xx|`|qGVBxZZOaa	Grawr.<br>  Okay, because emo stands for emotional. People think emotionally unstable, therefore the cutting pops into their mind. It's annoying, and people call me emo. If I say yes, they automatically look at my arms. It's stupid.|`|HtKKcq98aa	It can be kinda annoying if the person is overly emotional where they need constant attention and what not but i wouldn't mind dating a nice sensitive emo boy if he were really cute and interesting and not so needy|`|L2fN1ZUVaa	Seriously PPl the "emo" thing is getin OLD<br>  Emo is SOO last Year XD|`|MFPyyTHSaa	ya most dont i hate when people think that (my friends are emos)<br>  and nothings wrong people are just judge mental

They are not considered part of the family. For example, Muhammed married the ex-wife of his "adopted" son (this would not be allowed in Islam if he were his biological son), and then recited a verse that indicated that adoption is invalid. Therefore, since they are not part of the family, the answer to your question is yes.|`|757ce30489e7f56556925d17f1f49f76aa	I have heard that if you raise the baby as your own, and breast feed it, the child becomes like your real child, so hijab would not be necessary.|`|08d3778f46ccb1088efa36be8edafa91aa	Yes, unless they are related by blood|`|jsM8F4bLaa	I'm going to go with yes on this one.|`|6fde49610b3f23646cea05cc7f291dcbaa	Islam views adoption, and the rights of an adopted child differently to how say we do in the United Kingdom. <br>  <br>  Families can easily avoid the whole hijab issue by trying to adopt a baby and breastfeeding the baby. The baby will then be seen as a fully fledged family member with no need to wear hijab around them when they hit puberty.|`|UlzxgVMgaa	if he reached puberty ye

A very short person can be a size 0 and not be excessively thin at all. A size eight on a very tall woman can be very very slim. It is also true that sizes vary by country and designer. Sizes are meaningless, if it fits well and looks good, wear it!|`|HIav9sVuaa	im 17 and a size 8 and proud anyone who says size 8 is a horrible size your just jealous and trying to make yourself feel better i can also fit into some size 6 and its natural ive never dieted|`|2c7869fbf2bfda8e590501ddb5545f2caa	size 0 IS UNHEALTHY no think about it|`|U8RkYWb0aa	who wants to hug a stick?

The operator also goes through a rigmarole of asking your name, address, home phone, the number you are calling from....<br>  <br>  Since the call is anyway recorded, when I once had to call 999 for a genuinely time-critical emergency I gave them all the information quickly so that I could be put straight through to the police and ambulance services at once. No such luck. The girl in the office went through the whole thing, very slowly, refusing to connect me until she had done it her way.<br>  <br>  She needn't have hurried. The police did not appear for one hour and forty minutes and the ambulance (with a critically injured teenager on the pavement) never appeared at all.<br>  <br>  However I suppose some government target was met and all the right boxes ticked.

AA11755204	Masturbation is a fine pastime that is good for your health and relieves stress.<br>  <br>  Sin is an outdated concept.  Instead of just taking the spoon-fed morality that your class doles out to you, use your own brain.  Religion likes to use sex as a tool for keeping people feeling guilty.  It makes it easier to get them to fill the pews and empty their pockets.|`|avVdKiWKaa	I think it's weird and unnatural if you don't practice autoeroticism from time to time.  Let me simplify this for you:  We are all mortal, we are all "sinners" (depending on who is doing the judging), and we all die.  Now, the "depending on who is doing the judging" is the important part.  Apparently suicide bombers are "holy" and will "go to heaven" if they martyr themselves in the name of Allah.  This should give you some clue as to what the religious racket is all about.  And before you go saying, well, my god's better than your god, I would humbly point out that nobody's right if everybody's wrong.|`|bEeozqacaa	Masturbation is fine, there is nothing wrong with it.

I mean breaking any one of the ten commandments is a mortal sin.. but masturbation isn't one of those. Indeed masturbation isnt mentioned in the bible at all. Christians construe it into sinniness because masturbation involves a measure of "lust". Now you might think that this is "coveting your neighbour's wife".. and so it could be.<br>  <br>  I dont beleive in sin. Masturbation is good for a man's prostate.|`|ELjrNPVxaa	Masturbation requires thought, the more thought, the more intense the release. Soon masturbation is not enough and porn is used to acquire the same intense release. By this time the simple act of making love is so perverted it is usually unattainable and results in failed marriages or relationships. The more accepting we have become of this practice the more divorce has risen. That is the result of it, destroying the moral fabric of our lives. Sin? you tell me.|`|D8sN8gNFaa	No it's not.

But masturbation? I doubt it hurts. for me, i don't lust about anything when i do it, so it does not qualify as sin.|`|xjL6yODyaa	From a Christian standpoint, yes, masterbation is a sin. It is lust. In the Christian belief system, a sin is a sin is a sin. There is no sin higher or worse than another sin, so that is why masterbation is just as bad as murder.<br>  And to every ignorant person who answered this below, try reading the Bible before you go off saying things about it that are completely untrue.|`|bbHoF5jsaa	It is a bad habit..though, like I read in some answers, there is no such thing as hell.  <br>  <br>  Well, there are many things, that in the Bible, they put at the same level as murdering, like fornication, lying, and also being greedy.  Of course you cannot compare someone who kills to someone who lies, but in the Bible these are some of the most terrible things.<br>  <br>  Masturbation is a form of uncleanness. It can make you a ‘slave to various desires and pleasures,’ and it fosters attitudes that can be mentally corrupting. (Titus 3:3)<br>  <br>  At the same time, self-masturbation is not a form of gross sexual immorality, such as fornication. (Ephesians 4:19) Hence, if you have a problem with masturbation, you need not conclude that you have committed the unforgivable sin. The key is to resist the urge and never to give up your fight!<br>  <br>  So, in conclusion, many people have problem dealing with masturbation, but if you can conquer this urge, it is not a sin...But it is a dirty thing, we have to be clean...<br>  <br>  Feel free to contact me...and ask any other questions!!!|`|VBEMxcopaa	Being religious person, it makes me frustrated when they give you dogma with out teaching you why. Masturbation is a form of sex that is different then the ways our bodies are designed (not saying it is wrong or right) religious people believe that sex should be between a man and a woman, an other way is different then what God planned for. My personal belief is that you control it you shouldn't let your passions get the best of you because you loose desire for other things.|`|oUIGsNyBaa	that is redundant. every sin is a mortal sin because 1 sin is enough to ruin your standing with God.

r7tWe5dqaa	Where as I think that spanking with some guidelines and in some situations is fully warranted and overall a good tool for child rearing. I was a child whose parents used just that phrase to justify beating me almost to death on several occasions and tormenting me in many other more emotionally scarring ways while I was still in their care.<br>  <br>  <br>  I just as a whole have issues with people who take a phrase they like or a bible verse out of context and use it to justify every action. We always called these people BIBLE THUMPERS. If you look hard enough and you can find a piece of scripture that can SEEM to justify nearly ANY action when taken out of context and perverted to your own use.<br>  <br>  As a Christian (or the representative of any other religion) I feel it is your responsibility to educate yourself in the texts and teachings of your faith and use them in your life as a whole. Not just the bits and pieces that you can make dance to your tune.<br>  <br>  So even though this phrase really DID originate in the bible it is taken out of context and miss used way too often.|`|vOB8mJTgaa	You have an issue with paraphrasing bible verses but what do you think a preacher does every sunday when he gives his sermon.  Sure he starts off with the actual verse he is expounding upon for his 15-20 minutes but the rest of the time he is relating the verse to different things. He may be changing the words to make it more applicable today, or even changing the words to make it more understandable to those not well versed in English.  Some paraphrasing is required to interperet scripture.  Your not taking anything from it's meaning, you are just personalizing it if you will.<br>  <br>  My pastor has a saying that I am particularly fond of.  Don't major in minors.  That is what it seems you are doing. Paraphrasing Proverbs 13:24 as spare the rod, spoil the child is actually a rather nice way of paraphrasing the verse. The actual verse says hate, and to you and me that doesn't really mean much.  I don't know how many times I have been sitting in gridlock traffic and say I hate this traffic, or I hate this line or I hate insert particular irritating event here.  We are talking about a time period when hate actually meant something.  And biblical hate at that.  Worse than just spoiling ones child.  God wiped Sodom and Gomorrah off the planet in hatred. God sent the flood of Noah in hatred.  Biblical hatred was a big deal.<br>  <br>  As far as your Samuel Butler poem goes, just because she decided to paraphrase scripture in a perverse fashion doesn't mean we Christians can't take back our scripture.  Paraphrased or not it originated in our (O.K. so it actually originated in the Hebrew bible which we believe in so we inherit it) holy book.  If it has become a popular interpretation of Proverbs then it is all to the glory of god.  And I guarantee you that the double meaning of rod is not that obvious.  If you think I am wrong go out to main street wherever you live and ask 100 random people what they think that particular phrase means and I guarantee you most people would not take it in a perverse fashion. Most would relate it to disciplining ones child.|`|BH7VpjJNaa	"Sweets for the sweet" was a line from Shakespear's Ophelia where the queen is putting flowers on Ophelia's grave, but it is often used by sweethearts giving candy to their loved one.

If you read through the 81 difference references to the rod found in the King James Bible.It refers to two different concepts.  <br>  <br>  The first is the shepherd's rod, with its curved hooked end, that was used to guide, protect and rescue sheep.  No shepherd would even hit his sheep with his rod.  That was not its function.  So nothing in that concept of a "rod" indicates that a parent should beat their child.  Rather they are to guide, protect and rescue them.<br>  <br>  The rod also was used as a symbol of authority.  The Bible says that a parent is to have authority over their child until they are grown enough to become an adult.  Nothing in that concept suggest that a parent should beat the child into submission.<br>  <br>  In Proverbs 13, the Bible says there is a connection between "the rod" and "chastening" a child.  So what is "chastening"?  The first definition given for the word is "to inflict suffering upon for purposes of moral improvement".  Nothing in that insist that the "suffering" has to be a physical beating.  A "time out" for a toddler would be a "chastening".  A grounding for an older child would be a "chastening".  A making your child pay for damaging to something they deliberately damaged would be "chastening".<br>  <br>  The idea that a parent should be using "the rod" (chastening) to teach the children morals is a Bible idea.  But "the rod" is a reference to many other things beyond "spanking".

1Ad7jJgwaa	I think most people worry about things other than what pants they wear. I just buy whatever costs the least that I can throw on before I go out. I think I'd have to go out of my way to find leather pants that I actually wanted to wear. It's a matter of convenience, which creates trends.<br>  <br>  I don't think there ever was attitude. It's tough to think outside of your example now, since all I see are the 80's. We all live for wages and security, and there's no reason to have attitude unless you're spoiled and want attention. Different definition of attitude than what you suggest, I suppose.<br>  <br>  People used to want to originate and create, which is what I think you mean. What happened to that? Celebrities? Crappy movies? "Better technology" making up for substance?<br>  <br>  I think this is the best answer I can give you. The world is about money. If it's tried and true, and it can show a profit, people will invest in it. If you had to put your money in either the person who bought a suit for an interview, or the person who wore leather pants and a tuxedo shirt, who would you pick? Not you, but a responsible employer, looking to reduce their liability for picking the WRONG choice.<br>  <br>  Everyone's so afraid of being wrong that nobody's right anymore. There you go.|`|wPnJekdqaa	I think 'attitude' today means acting like a thug and being disrespectful to others at every opportunity. In that sense, it's definitely still here, unfortunately.<br>  <br>  You do still see people that stand out from the crowd and be themselves but it seems most people are quick to find a social group and blend in to that. Individuality seems to have fallen by the wayside in favour of making sure you're part of the crowd.<br>  <br>  As for the leather pants, I'm a fan and think more people should wear them. It makes me laugh how they were quite popular about ten years ago and now when they're brought up people mention those stereotypes you listed as well as the second most common one (Friends being the first) of 'OMG That's so 80s!', despite leather pants being pretty much a constant amongst those who aren't afraid to step out of the crowd since the 60s. They're about due another shot at being in fashion too, can't wait to see the majority's opinion change!

When I started actually "looking" at people, I noticed guys seemed to be infinitely more attractive than girls... which scared me until I was 14 and just accepted it.<br>  For a few months I spent all my time rationalizing it, "Why did this happen to me? Did I get a sex change as a baby? Should I be a girl? Why can't I be normal? Is something wrong? Is there a way to not be gay?"<br>  But you know what? I think all those questions just made me more sure I was gay, and now I really love who I am. At 14 I got depressed and went on the internet looking up if there was a way to not be gay, there was this one website in particular that said "Gays are wrong, don't become one Blah blah blah more stupid crap. It's a choice, you can help it, get help"<br>  When I realized how wrong those people were and just how sickening it was to insult somebody for their sexual orientation, I decided I'd accept me for who I was.|`|x5nWWyylaa	13 <br>  checked a girl out one day and just dayum haha<br>  i just knew.|`|3w1u6mQJaa	14 for me|`|FVxYIuP4aa	I was 15, when I figured it out.|`|8PA58u3kaa	about 11 or 12|`|kaPHGf4Baa	im not gay, but saw the seinfeld reference...just had to post|`|4Nf8zhDXaa	i was like 8 i've never been attracted to girls in a way i always knew i was different aww... this ? just made me think about my 2nd grade crush haha|`|lW3YtOIaaa	a year ago (when I was 13) I started having thoughts that I was bisexual, and recently I've started to accept that fact ^_^|`|14XsciiRaa	I had my first sexual experience when I was 11 and me and Eileen went all the way.

Tax policy is used to encourage some behaviors and discourage others.  As an example, note that tax breaks are now going to be given to companies who choose not to outsource work overseas.  Another example is the high tax burden carried on gasoline or the so-called "sin taxes" on cigarettes and alcohol.  <br>  <br>  In the case opf marriage, the tax breaks are used to encourage marriage as a social institution which helps stabilize the family for raising children.  It's also because married couples, especially those raising children, are incurring additional expenses.  <br>  <br>  It's not necessarily fair, but the idea of encouraging couples to marry and provide a stable environment for the next generation, as well as encouraging the preservation of some wealth from one generation for the next seems a pretty good idea to me.  <br>  <br>  By the way, I strongly support equal marriage rights for gay people, too.|`|spbqfjvbaa	Honestly, they shouldn't.  Just because some people are either waiting for the right perosn to marry or know that marriage isn't the thing for them right now, they shouldn't be penalized.

6WpIS5M6aa	" Science has proof without any certainty. Creationists have certainty without any proof". - Ashley Montague<br>  Certainty without proof is most definitely not Science.<br>  The much maligned Scientific Method requires one to form an opinion, then test that opinion against observable facts.

Science answers questions with the best evidence available.  <br>  Intelligent Design Theory is a desperate attempt to disprove the obvious, that evolution makes a lot of sense and creation and supreme beings are just outdated attempts to explain what couldn't be explained before the microscope and other advances in technology were invented.  The only reason to be so passionate about imaginary supreme beings is that there is such an extensive system of brainwashing in many cultures.  Many times people are trained to not think, calling thinking "doubt" and calling doubt a sin and taught that sinners will suffer.|`|b3477086f60752aa221dc76da30fdb43aa	Sure. If you think in terms of there being a 'force' in nature that will through chemistry, tries to form life out of available chemicals. And then every thing falls into place and makes sense. Man made from mud doesn't. Just because every living thing on earth evolved through evolution doesn't mean nothing was behind it.<br>  We seem to think in only two terms when it comes to life. Creation from a god, Poof! Or simply evolution through happenstance. Nothing is happenstance. There is a reason for everything.

These are the people who supposedly don't question the origins of their belief system or the actions of the government and therefore, for some, constitute the general attitude of the country.  While I don't think this is particularly true, it does lead to the question of just what do they contribute in the way of believing  as they do, and how they shift that belief system to accommodate todays advances in our society. At both ends of the spectrum in religion and science there has to be extremism to stimulate the advancement of both. I see here the problem that science has far surpassed the religious in that advancement.  While science is an open ended proposition, religion isn't for millions.  New Thought Spirituality is an attempt to update the religious with the use of quantum physics and the rejection of the traditional "picture of God" as it has been depicted for centuries. Extremism however, doesn't have to be crashing airplanes and such, just speculative thought.  Our race consciousness, or that which is imprinted in our belief system over generations, is partly responsible for the way we think and view things.  We believe as our parents do, our neighbors, our religion until such a time as we release that and move to extreme thought and question that which does not make sense to us. Indifference may be what Sam Harris is talking about.  We just don't want to worry about these things because we feel we have no power to change them.|`|AA11923447	I have heard this argument, and think it's bogus. I'm not a moderate; I'm a leftist.

I have done so publicly, and have no problem in addressing the media. I've spoken out on radio, television, public lectures and more. I'm not sure what else I'm really supposed to do.

Before he went on this crusade he fought very, very hard for civil rights for blacks.<br>  <br>  They are not alone in their beliefs but they are much more daring and vocal.

The fact is... there are only about 70 members or so, this is a single family and a few decieved close friends of this family. Several members of the family have law degrees and what they are attempting to do is to incite hatred and hopefully violence or to have people tell them they can not protest or speak in public so they can scream their freedom of speech is being violated or if someone gets violent towards them they can file lawsuits against the individuals or perhaps the city or state....its a money scheme, they want to cause as much problems as they can hoping to be able to file lawsuits. They are a black eye on any people of faith, it is people like this that cause alot of the misunderstandings about Christians.

Despite the name, they are not affiliated to any baptist organisation.  I saw them in a documentary, and it seems they have some disturbing beliefs about the power of their leader.  And as for the size of the church, it may seem sizeable, but remember almost all the members of the church are related to the leader, including his 50+ grandchildren!

It's hard to say why one's belief in a god would be strengthened by a tragedy like that. I guess it depends on the person. <br>  Your relatives didn't do anything wrong, they just bumped up against the reality that there is no god. They have every right to grieve about their situation, but there is no one to blame. There is no magic deity granting health to some and sickness to others. They will just have to have the courage to cope with their situation. Don't get caught in religious mind games like "If your faith is strong enough" because that's their way of blaming the victim.

787a1681b3bc0562d41e1707b178a8a5aa	Your sentence is correct, and this is what I understand from it...<br>  <br>  You had a dream 10 years ago, and after all this time, it continues to cause you pain.<br>  <br>  Is that what you meant?<br>  <br>  I find the word "only" a bit strange, as if you mean to imply that the dream could have had other effects, such as to frighten you, or to inspire you, but it does neither of those after 10 years.  I interpret your sentence to imply that there were other possibilities, but the only one in your situation after allt this time is affliction, or pain.<br>  <br>  If you meant to imply that you are the only one who suffers from this dream (even though others could have suffered), then I would write:<br>  "this dream only affects me."|`|mUK240ykaa	I would tone "afflicts" down to "affects" or "bothers".|`|dB2BRGRAaa	'Afflict' is the wrong word.  Are you saying that the dream used to affect many people but that now, after 10 years, it only gets to you?  Or are you saying that you used to be terrified by the dream but that now, 10 years later, you are only slightly affected by it?  Or are you saying that, 10 years after a specific event, you are still affected by the nightmare?<br>  <br>  If you can work out what you are trying to say, then it should be easier.|`|pfeyoZGTaa	i'm assuming by afflict you mean to 'affect negatively'. other good verbs to use would be trouble, pain, hurt, burden, distress, torment or sorrow. although all of these words (including afflict) seem a bit serious to be described as 'only'.|`|7869ca079f899653fde9ba75c3cc3134aa	yes it does!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/afflict" rel="nofollow">http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionar...</a>
AA12185428	While still in high school, back in the mid 60's I was "trotter" for a local bank. I ran errands, delivered interoffice envelopes from desk to desk, visited the local stock exchange to get timely quotes,shopped for food for the dietitian that prepared lunches, visited other financial institutions to deliver items and settle up with checks from their customers that we cashed. Did the mail, helped the tellers run totals and even filled in on the phones. The old plug in system. I was sent one day to another bank to request a "ledger stretcher". They sent me to several other places until finally the joke was told. It was just a trick to make trotters feel welcomed and known at the other institutions.  Best job I ever had.|`|kjvGggH6aa	Teaching Kindergarten!|`|fd7f7760fab598ddb7f5fd26f811c2baaa	When I taught Line Dance.|`|AAgX0SDcaa	I worked at a Senior Citizen Meal Program, it was an interesting job. Some of the people were very particular about not eating certain foods. One little lady crinkled her nose every time we served fish or tuna, and always asked me not to put it on her plate. Another man was allowed to leave the state mental (which was about 4 blocks away) hospital during the daytime, he would always ask for two plates of food, we weren't supposed to do it but when we had leftovers after serving everyone we did rather than waste it.   One of the cooks knew him from her previous job as a cook at that hospital. Found out he was in the hospital for life for murdering his wife. She said he was a volunteer and trustee in the kitchen back then, he had a key to the knife box and she didn't and she never understood it. His wife wanted to go to California and she pestered him every day. Finally he cracked and killed her, cut her up and mailed her in a trunk to California.  One time he came in with a big pillowcase over his shoulder full of something, we were so relieved when he opened it up and took out a stack of framed awards, he had been an excellent equestrian in his younger days.  Another one of the ladies would also volunteer before lunch was served, she could crack us up with her jokes.  I learned to make several of the dishes they served there and offered menu suggestions on what to do with certain commodities like gallons of canned pears, pineapple, and ketchup.That was a fun job back then, but it wasn't full-time though.|`|ozwLZwXeaa	Working as a mail room clerk for a newspaper. Up until I was injured on the job pushing an 1100 # hamper full of newspapers for my boss and ended up with three herniated disks and bone chips at the base of my spine.<br>  After that it wasn't fun anymore. Doctors, lawyers, hospitals, emergency rooms in the middle of the night.  Physiologists, psychiatrist, physical therapy and being made fun of by my employer, boss and two co-workers because I was in pain and my tens unit would give me electric shocks leaning against the labeling machine.

y1KcxJ7Oaa	To be a Satan worshipper you just need to do everything that is the opposite of what God teaches.  <br>  <br>  God says hate homosexuals.

So as a Satanist you should find someone you love, have children, live together for years but NEVER marry.<br>  <br>  God says not to lust.  So as a Satanist you should become addicted to internet porn and become a frequent masturbator.<br>  <br>  God says that we should all repent at eating of the Tree of Knowledge.

7JIhZ0R0aa	Mark 13:31 - heaven and earth will pass away, but Jesus' Word will not pass away. But Jesus never says anything about His Word being entirely committed to a book. Also, it took 400 years to compile the Bible, and another 1,000 years to invent the printing press. How was the Word of God communicated? Orally, by the bishops of the Church, with the guidance and protection of the Holy Spirit.<br>  <br>  Mark 16:15 - Jesus commands the apostles to preach the Gospel to every creature. But Jesus did not want this preaching to stop after the apostles died, and yet the Bible was not compiled until four centuries later. The word of God was transferred orally. <br>  <br>  Mark 3:14; 16:15 - Jesus commands the apostles to preach (not write) the gospel to the world. Jesus gives no commandment to the apostles to write, and gives them no indication that the oral apostolic word he commanded them to communicate would later die in the fourth century. If Jesus wanted Christianity to be limited to a book (which would be finalized four centuries later), wouldn't He have said a word about it? <br>  <br>  Luke 10:16 - He who hears you (not "who reads your writings"), hears me. The oral word passes from Jesus to the apostles to their successors by the gracious gifts of the Holy Spirit. This succession has been preserved in the Holy Catholic Church. <br>  <br>  Luke 24:47 - Jesus explains that repentance and forgiveness of sins must be preached (not written) in Christ's name to all nations. For Protestants to argue that the word of God is now limited to a book (subject to thousands of different interpretations) is to not only ignore Scripture, but introduce a radical theory about how God spreads His word which would have been unbelievable to the people at the time of Jesus. <br>  <br>  Acts 2:3-4 - the Holy Spirit came to the apostles in the form of "tongues" of fire so that they would "speak" (not just write) the Word. <br>  <br>  Acts 15:27 - Judas and Silas, successors to the apostles, were sent to bring God's infallible Word by "word of mouth." <br>  <br>  Rom. 10:8 - the Word is near you, on your lips and in your heart, which is the word of faith which is preached (not just written). <br>  <br>  Rom. 10:17 - faith comes by what is "heard" (not just read) which is the Word that is "preached" (not read). This word comes from the oral tradition of the apostles. Those in countries where the Scriptures are not available can still come to faith in Jesus Christ. <br>  <br>  1 Cor. 15:1,11 - faith comes from what is "preached" (not read). For non-Catholics to argue that oral tradition once existed but exists no longer, they must prove this from Scripture. But no where does Scripture say oral tradition died with the apostles. To the contrary, Scripture says the oral word abides forever. <br>  <br>  Gal. 1:11-12 - the Gospel which is "preached" (not read) to me is not a man's Gospel, but the Revelation of Jesus Christ. <br>  <br>  Eph. 1:13 - hearing (not reading) the Word of truth is the gospel of our salvation. This is the living word in the Church's living tradition. <br>  <br>  Col. 1:5 - of this you have "heard" (not read) before in the word of truth, the Gospel which has come to you. <br>  <br>  1 Thess. 2:13 - the Word of God is what you have "heard" (not read). The orally communicated word of God lasts forever, and this word is preserved within the Church by the Holy Spirit. <br>  <br>  2 Tim. 1:13 - oral communications are protected by the Spirit. They abide forever. Oral authority does not die with the apostles. <br>  <br>  2 Tim. 4:2,6-7 - Paul, at the end of his life, charges Timothy to preach (not write) the Word. Oral teaching does not die with Paul. <br>  <br>  Titus 1:3 - God's word is manifested "through preaching" (not writing). This "preaching" is the tradition that comes from the apostles. <br>  <br>  1 Peter 1:25 - the Word of the Lord abides forever and that Word is the good news that was "preached" (not read) to you. Because the Word is preached by the apostles and it lasts forever, it must be preserved by the apostles' successors, or this could not be possible. Also, because the oral word abides forever, oral apostolic tradition could not have died in the fourth century with all teachings being committed to Scripture. <br>  <br>  2 Peter 1:12, 15 - Peter says that he will leave a "means to recall these things in mind." But since this was his last canonical epistle, this "means to recall" must therefore be the apostolic tradition and teaching authority of his office that he left behind. <br>  <br>  2 John 1:12; 3 John 13 - John prefers to speak and not to write. Throughout history, the Word of God was always transferred orally and Jesus did not change this. To do so would have been a radical departure from the Judaic tradition. <br>  <br>  Deut. 31:9-12 - Moses had the law read only every seven years. Was the word of God absent during the seven year interval. The Word of God has always been given orally by God's appointed ones, and was never limited to Scripture.|`|Sn0CViR7aa	John 21:25 is indeed a key verse for understanding Christianity.  The Protestants seem to read it with little comprehension because they insist that all the knowledge we need about God's plans is in the Bible, available for private interpretation.  Yet this verse suggests that most of Jesus' teachings are not found in the brief biblical accounts.<br>  <br>  Historically, John 21:25 lends the proper perspective for reading the Bible.  The crucial saving event in history involves everything that Jesus, God among us, said and did. Most of his teachings were not great speeches to vast crowds, but detailed, private explanations to his inner core of disciples, whom he designated the leaders of his church.<br>  <br>  That's why we look to the rich understanding of the church established to "bind and loose" in matters of scriptural interpretation rather than to our private readings of a few documents to arrive at Jesus' full message.<br>  <br>  Cheers,<br>  Bruce|`|vAbATcTcaa	OH the plight of those who see but are blind and those who have a brain but are minus any reason .  did they ever hear of the concept of family receipies that were passed down from gramma to mama to daughter and so forth? Or did they ever hear of heirlooms? things that are passed down from one generation to the other?<br>  Oh sure they heard of it, but putting that concept together with religion, their brain takes a nose dive into the stupid factory.  <br>  lets face it, they do not want holy catholic traditions whether written or orally given.  Don't give them what they do not want.  They do not want the true Jesus in the Eucharist, they prefer a soda cracker, hea!! dont give them what they do not want.  let them have their days of glory here on earth, calling the catholic names and such because we believe the impossible the unbelievable the miraculous.  Such has always been the faith of the first christians and so it shall remain so until protestants get a revelation on truth, which, most of society today is at the point of not tolerating sound doctrine, we are in that time the bible warned about.|`|gcwgVLjraa	You would have to stretch things pretty far to get "sacred tradition" out of that.  <br>  <br>  It is saying that Jesus performed so many miracles, and did so many things, that the other stuff Christ did would not be small enough to put into books.  It means Jesus is even greater than we see him in the Bible.  There is no interpretation that leads to sacred tradition unless you presuppose it.|`|AA12048147	I think it means just what it is saying : That all the things, miracles, etc., could not be written because there were just to many....the book would be so huge it would take the world to contain it.... and MANY life times to read it.... which we do not have !!!.... all will be clear to us when we reach Glory !!!!!!

John 21: 25 does not support Sacred Tradition.<br>  <br>  Most Protestants, especially anti-Catholics, have a definition of Sacred Tradition that comes from the pits of hell, and has nothing to do with the Catholic definition.|`|1VaH8D3Raa	Well 2,009 years ago <br>  .<br>  Most all books in existence were hand written <br>  .<br>  There weren't all that many printing presses arround<br>  .<br>  And the ones that were are as slow as a snail <br>  .<br>  So back then that statement is a fact of life <br>  .<br>  Today it is a saying that is heard and think of how fast we can print out a book at a printing press today<br>  .<br>  A 1,000 to one back 2,009 years ago<br>  /.|`|r8rykCkGaa	Not everything could be written in the Bible.

But if any deny the Signs of Allah, Allah is swift in calling to account.  [3:19]<br>  <br>  Say: "Verily, my Lord hath guided me to a way that is straight,- a Religion of right,- the path (trod) by Abraham the true in Faith, and he (certainly) joined not gods with Allah."  [6:161] <br>  <br>  Who can be better in Religion than one who submits his whole self to Allah, does good, and follows the way of Abraham the true in Faith? For Allah did take Abraham for a friend.  [4:125] <br>  <br>  If anyone desires a Religion other than Islam (submission to Allah., never will it be accepted of him; and in the Hereafter He will be in the ranks of those who have lost (All spiritual good).  [3:85]<br>  <br>  “The Religion of Allah”<br>  (Deeni Allah)<br>  <br>  Do they seek for other than the Religion of Allah.-while all creatures in the heavens and on earth have, willing or unwilling, bowed to His Will (Accepted Islam), and to Him shall they all be brought back.  [3:83] Say: "We believe in God, and in what has been revealed to us and what was revealed to Abraham, Isma'il, Isaac, Jacob, and the Tribes, and in (the Books) given to Moses, Jesus, and the prophets, from their Lord: We make no distinction between one and another among them, and to God do we bow our will (in Islam)." [3:84]  If anyone desires a religion other than Islam (submission to God), never will it be accepted of him; and in the Hereafter He will be in the ranks of those who have lost (All spiritual good). [3:85]<br>  <br>  And thou dost see the people enter Allah's Religion in crowds, [110:2]  Celebrate the praises of thy Lord, and pray for His Forgiveness: For He is Oft-Returning (in Grace and Mercy). [110:3]  <br>  <br>  The woman and the man guilty of adultery or fornication,- flog each of them with a hundred stripes: Let not compassion move you in their case, in a matter prescribed by Allah, if ye believe in Allah and the Last Day: and let a party of the Believers witness their punishment. [24:2] <br>  <br>  “The Religion before Allah is Islam”<br>  (Inna alddeena AAinda Allahi alislam)<br>  <br>  The Religion before Allah is Islam (submission to His Will): Nor did the People of the Book dissent therefrom except through envy of each other, after knowledge had come to them. But if any deny the Signs of Allah, Allah is swift in calling to account.  [3:19]<br>  <br>  “The same religion has He established for you as that which He enjoined on Noah”<br>  (SharaAAa lakum mina alddeeni ma wassa bihi noohan)<br>  <br>  The same religion has He established for you as that which He enjoined on Noah - the which We have sent by inspiration to thee - and that which We enjoined on Abraham, Moses, and Jesus: Namely, that ye should remain steadfast in religion, and make no divisions therein: to those who worship other things than Allah, hard is the (way) to which thou callest them. Allah chooses to Himself those whom He pleases, and guides to Himself those who turn (to Him). [42:13]  And they became divided only after Knowledge reached them,- through selfish envy as between themselves. Had it not been for a Word that went forth before from thy Lord, (tending) to a Term appointed, the matter would have been settled between them: But truly those who have inherited the Book after them are in suspicious (disquieting) doubt concerning it.[42:15]  <br>  <br>  “The religion of Truth”<br>  (Deena alhaq)<br>  <br>  It is He Who has sent His Messenger with Guidance and the Religion of Truth, to proclaim it over all religion: and enough is Allah for a Witness. [48:28]   Muhammad is the apostle of God; and those who are with him are strong against Unbelievers, (but) compassionate amongst each other. Thou wilt see them bow and prostrate themselves (in prayer), seeking Grace from God and (His) Good Pleasure. On their faces are their marks, (being) the traces of their prostration. This is their similitude in the Taurat; and their similitude in the Gospel is: like a seed which sends forth its blade, then makes it strong; it then becomes thick, and it stands on its own stem, (filling) the sowers with wonder and delight. As a result, it fills the Unbelievers with rage at them. God has promised those among them who believe and do righteous deeds forgiveness, and a great Reward. <br>  [48:29]  <br>  <br>  It is He Who hath sent His Messenger with guidance and the Religion of Truth, to proclaim it over all religion, even though the Pagans may detest (it). [9:33] <br>  <br>  Who doth greater wrong than one who invents falsehood against God, even as he is being invited to Islam? And God guides not those who do wrong. [61:7]  Their intention is to extinguish God's Light (by blowing) with their mouths: But God will complete (the revelation of) His Light, even though the Unbelievers may detest (it).

A person reaps what they sow. Sin is a rebellion against God. You do not have to serve sin, but could repent and trust on Jesus alone. Hell is eternal because a person is paying their own fine and did not let Jesus pay their fine. Do you not realize the very God you judge of being unjust came to Earth and lived as a man.

aWPmvPpfaa	i think thats an individual thing, and the kind of relationship you had. if you had a soul mate king of thing then yes stay. if you had a role fulment type...i.e i'm the wife, you are the husband then you mat have to leave. i think you would have to be in that situation to tell for sure.<br>  <br>  remember though, that person has always been transexual, they just didn't physically change yet.|`|ka6yGZWbaa	If you truly love them then you wouldn't leave them @ all you would stay w/ them & support them no matter what.  But yes that would change your sexual identity, but @ the same time it wouldn't if you think about it 'cause a transsexual is & always has been the gender that they will be physically changing to it is just that they are making it to where mind & body are one in the same.  So that is kind of a two sided answer w/ both answers being the same but different.|`|65QqZBnjaa	No it doesn't change your orientation.  As a matter of fact this is the main reason that most marriages do not survive transition.  This would fall under "irreconcilable differences".<br>  <br>  Nobody changes genders.  Gender identity is inborn and unchangeable.  A transsexual person is born with a brain-body mismatch, it's a naturally occurring birth condition.  Because the brain can't be changed, transsexual people change their bodies to match their identity and assume gender appropriate roles in society.
dFBccLExaa	Yeah, this can go both ways. When I was a clerk at a retail store, I had one woman come up and pass out pamphlets about her religion, telling me to go to god, and be saved, etc. etc. I had done nothing to provoke it, but she seemingly felt I needed to be informed. It was really awkward, and I wasn't sure what to do as to not offend her (since I'm not of that faith). I personally don't think religion should even be a factor, and if I was a manager, I would have fired her. Usually, if you harass a customer, that's grounds for being fired, so I'm surprised she wasn't canned.|`|eLbrMleWaa	Well you said you never brought it up... but it was on your forehead...<br>  <br>  And that's reality, some people are nice and dandy while others just don't like people and are always pissed off. Enter reality honey, not everybody who believes in god is a good person.|`|55db1dbbab55471fd7e483514f53d0a4aa	Turn the other cheek. She wasn't physically harming you and words can't hurt unless you let them. You know who your God is and that is what matters most.  By your actions you teach others.<br>  <br>  Have a great day!|`|LqyOHY37aa	I answered this the last time you asked it and my answer hasn't changed. Her faith has nothing to do with it. If it upset you, complain to corporate. <br>  <br>    Questions? Call 888-607-4287 or email  customercare@cvs.com|`|VFWRdAH3aa	it was very rude of her. you need to report her to her manager immediately|`|DZCFD0p2aa	CVS has some of the biggest a-holes for employees|`|Lk4aCBACaa	Yes it was... and even more so, it doesn't make sense. Was this all because you had a couple extra items? Why did she feel the need to proclaim "I am mean"? Sounds like she's a few crayons short of a full box. :)<br>  <br>  You say the supervisor let you have the extra 2 items, so I'm assuming you already had to bring in the clerk's supervisor. She'll be reprimanded and if enough people complain, she'll probably get fired eventually.<br>  <br>  I usually found it was the exact opposite for me. When I worked in a retail environment, I had to cashier as part of my job, and the customers would make nasty comments about my religion, either to my face with the usual proselytizing or very loudly to whoever else happened to be with them. I only wear a very tiny pentacle around my neck, but it might as well have had neon lights on it! I'd simply walk away and let one of my co-workers deal with them. I have as much right to my symbol as any other religious person, and I shouldn't have to take abuse for it. Nor should you have to suffer rudeness for your ashes; sorry you had to go through that. :)|`|kQC4HX6vaa	Call the store, speak to the manager and call the Head Office of CVS.<br>  <br>  Complain that you felt attacked, mistreated, and that anti-religious remarks are NOT tolerated.  Tell them you want this person fired or that you will call CNN or ABC, or whatever other network to let them know the CVS is prejudiced against religions.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  Ha, lets calm down first.  You don't need to go that far.<br>  <br>  Do call the store back and speak to the manager, if the manager is not there, request the corporate office phone number.  It looks like someone has already given it to you.  In addition, if this was the clerk that helped you, and you have a receipt, keep the receipt.  It has the store number, the date you were there, and possibly the clerk's employee number.<br>  <br>  Report it, it's the only way to stop this kind intolerance.|`|03vbT9olaa	Boy you sound very Jesus like there.|`|BPO6roTOaa	no, what kind of freak would walk around with ashes on their head lol|`|1899aea197e9521ce9a275c00c477c75aa	Christians are rude to me all the time when they see the symbol of my faith around my neck... a pentacle... so why are you bent out of shape about someone being rude to you about yours?   Most of you think that I should either quit wearing my symbol or just ignore the rude ones so that is my advise to you... doing wear it in public or ignore it.  Doesn't make you feel any better does it?  Well the advise doesn't make ME feel any better either when I am spit on as I walk down a public street wearing my pentacle.... at least you weren't spit on.|`|pO8OzblHaa	It's rude when anybody attacks someone's religious beliefs.<br>  <br>  <br>  If that had happened to me, I probably would have gone to their supervisor and told them about the situation. If they were like that to me, they could be that way to other people, and that kind of behavior could seriously cause them to lose customers. And it's just rude.|`|806025c44dd8e27b6c1d544348b087c0aa	Sounds like she's  a nutcase and needs a reprimand from her supervisor.  But don't let it ruin your day.|`|3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	Excuse me, what was the meaning of those ashes on your forehead?  Why are they there?  Why did you ask someone to put them there?<br>  <br>  Is it because your savior died on a cross to save you?  Do you love Him?  Then why not forgive and forget.  Right now.|`|g4AAZRuxaa	Yes it is rude.|`|p6wwiQG3aa	Yes it's rude<br>  <br>  <br>  Deal with it|`|9d43ec02a222734089d9cf48ceafea47aa	yes she was
9Ur1VL9Paa	There are two sides to every story; since you admittedly cut it short. I don't believe the clerk was entirely at fault. Be honest and tell us what really happened!<br>  <br>  Oh and you should wash your face!|`|1TYZDRUqaa	IJR would complain to the manager.  That sort of behavior from one who serves the public is not correct.  If IJR let his religious feelings out at the hotel where he works, IJR would be looking for another job.  Nobody should have to take religious abuse from anyone, especially someone in customer service.|`|AA11297267	I'm still looking in your story for the part where she "attacks" you...?<br>  <br>  She was rude, no doubt.  But she didn't "attack" you.<br>  <br>  Peace.|`|AA10034051	I would have immediately asked to speak to the manager. I would not have left that store until I did. I went many places yesterday after Ash Wednesday mass and not one person said anything to me. I would call and report her|`|89MKzLl3aa	She could get fired for being rude to customers, especially if it weren't her first offense. I would just ignore it, and if she is rude the second time, then I'd mention it to management.|`|ZmdIlkpQaa	Since she is there to serve you, the customer, I would most certainly have spoken to the manager or owner of the store about her attitude.|`|BABcrdMKaa	"There is more to this story, but I cut it short."<br>  <br>  Dont be biased, tell us the whole story|`|98db094f444e5154c3fcacd3e51e23c2aa	LOL.  \So there are others that do this?<br>  I went to court on that day here, and the police woman running the property scanner thing had the ash mark on her forehead. I didn't know anything about such a practice, never heard of it before. So I thought to myself "should \I tell her she has a dirty mark on her forehead or not"............well  I did tell her. I was trying to help out, so I said "Excuse me , but you have some dark smudge thing on your forehead|" , and she said "it was for ash Wednesday". We just had a whole bunch of fires in Victoria so I figured it was for that. Some kind of remembrance thing. Now I see its a catholic thing. thanks<br>  <br>  whats it for anyway?|`|eLbrMleWaa	Get over it.<br>  She might have been having a bad day, she's human, just let her off the hook once if it happens again THEN tell the manager.<br>  <br>  Doesn't the bible have something about forgiveness in it? I pretty sure there is...|`|4d16b72ffa495ae128ab9f89679fc203aa	If you are not allowed an extra item over the limit, you are not allowed.<br>  <br>  Thank her for pointing this out to you, and leave.|`|VFWRdAH3aa	contact the manager of that store immediately. it's her job to be nice to customers and if she's not being nice to you then she's not doing her job at all.|`|xP1xmSeaaa	Your beliefs are ridiculous and worthy of mockery.<br>  <br>  Fair game|`|LqyOHY37aa	Contact a person at the corporate office and file a complaint. Be nice about it but be detailed too.|`|SoF7gxEqaa	Well, if the rule is "no extra items over the limit" she is doing her job.  What about her tone? Maybe she was trying to joke around, in which case you shouldn't be offended|`|OEhR8pssaa	yes she could get fired, it depends on the managment and company/buisness, but you should definatley notify senior managment and get her reported|`|M1u6fdZCaa	Sometimes you just have to ignore ignorant people. If she is rude to you again, tell her manager.

AA10182088	Great question, I wish I had the answer. What I do know is that there are some religions that believe they DO have the books that are believe to have been written by Christ, but must other religions reject it as ligament or reliable. I just don't know.<br>  I guess I have to ask myself...would it make a difference?<br>  good luck on your search, let me know "-}|`|AA11346514	Why would there be?  Jesus gave his word to the apostles to spread throughout the world.  He gave it to the disciples to support and assist the apostles.  His words are reported in Matthew, Mark, Luke and John.  Followed by a description of how they spread the Word, followed by a description of how Paul was converted and taught the churches how to evangelize.|`|axiA5mMoaa	Jesus is the gospel [good news] & He said let others praise you then you yourself And His word is hidden in my heart that I will not sin against Him.<br>  Amen!!!|`|RyhluHk3aa	The Lord Jesus revealed His Gospel directly to the apostle Paul (Gal. 1:11,12). It is the Gospel of the Grace of God, and it is what saves you today, in this present dispensation.<br>  The Gospel that Christ preached when on the earth was called, even by Him, the Gospel of the Kingdom, and it was for Israel, because it still taught the Law.<br>  Paul calls his Gospel the Gospel of Christ.|`|AA10637643	Jesus stated he would reveal nothing except through His prophets...<br>  <br>  Would it matter?  People saw Him raise the dead and still did not believe He was the Son of God.  Would we read it more?  Would we treat it more special?  Would having it affect our faith and/or free agency?<br>  <br>  We are given the information we need, God knows that.|`|I5av9h9naa	I'd say that's another reason to seriously question his actual being.  There's very little that can lead one to believe he was anything other than a mere book character made up from the common rumors and lore of the times.|`|iHDYncuXaa	There is.

But he himself remained silent, as if in no pain." <br>  <br>  this agrees with the expected silence of the "suffering servant" in Isaiah 53:7|`|e6t9FPUdaa	He was busy doing. He led by example. He performed miracles worthy to be written. If He wrote a gospel there could be no inclusion of the Passion or anything after. If He just sat writing about the things He could be doing if He wasn't writing it wouldn't be a book worthy of Him.|`|z7k8Jh7Aaa	Think of it this way- Jesus is God (Mark 14:60-62).

If he testifies of himself like felix manalo of iglesia ni cristo do, he is not a true son of God in the flesh. Felix manalo testified of himself as last messenger, so he is not a true messenger, it is simple as that. It should be other than yourself who will testify of you.|`|AA11502346	Jesus Himself is the Gospel.  He is the Alpha and the Omega.

A gentle, "would you like to use my perfume/cologne?" is usually enough to get the hint across. That's because I once went to work on short notice, and forgot my deodorant. Several people just looked at me strangely before someone told me I simply MUST try their new perfume. That was when I realized my mistake. I thanked her profusely and mentioned all the strange looks. We had a laugh. Honestly, though, I'd just alert my friends to please let me know, since this seems to happen to you a lot. Lift your arms, say "whew, hey, you guys could have let me know I stink!!"|`|F7HT7glPaa	I know two people at school that absolutely stink (as in, I can barely breathe around them), but I would never say anything because they are such self-conscious people. Besides, I'm not sure it would go down too well, since we aren't great friends or anything.<br>  <br>  Me and my bestfriends, however... we have a code word. One day we asked the  question to each other, "If I had really bad body odour, would you tell me?" We thought it would be too embarrassing to straight out say "You stink!" so our stinky-codeword is, "Did you remember to put out the garbage this morning?" We say it in a silly, manly voice so it's pretty funny.<br>  <br>  But it's good to know you can rely on your friends to be completely honest with you.|`|IwwqQSxlaa	If they were really your friend, they wouldn't get offended by you being honest with them...they need to know the truth! lol|`|AA10978949	happily|`|WNWKDw4uaa	No, I would probably just suffer through it silently.|`|FcZU29W6aa	Your friends are probably not saying anything because it is not every day and because it is an awkward subject.<br>  <br>  Put your deodorant by your toothbrush so that you'll remember to use it everyday.|`|dPsaYMOvaa	I'd probably hint to them subtly by spraying myself with something smelly and offering them some, or if we were walking somewhere maybe say "Can you smell that? What is it?", but I would never actually tell them "Dude, you stink."|`|km9cQNAXaa	I assume your friend is not aware that he/she may have a problem.<br>  <br>  If you've noticed it then so will others, so I say yes, but very discreetly. For certain out of earshot from anyone else. No need to embarrass your friend.<br>  <br>  Ian M|`|hZ9Awgf0aa	Yes, I would if they are one of my really close friends.. but if it was just a friend then they would probably take it in a rude way so I wouldn't say anything.|`|1c9d381b762522a9849b15cca142703eaa	yeah that stinks. get it!?!?!?!!?!? i would let them know probz
KOX2wFWwaa	i guess so so hows the after life buddy|`|Y5Qh2IVsaa	Thanks for letting me know, If I run in to you today, I'll be sure to say hello.<br>  <br>  (I would say "congrats on being a ghost" but i'm pretty sure your not to happy about...y'know...dying and everthing. Good luck, mate!)|`|RcBpbWKdaa	a few years back huh? i dont know man, 2009 and 2008 seem pretty close for it to be a "few years" back<br>  <br>  how could you have died in march and then create an account in april?|`|XMzicF0Xaa	Very tragic tsk tsk tsk,,, hows Hitler and Mussolini there ^^?|`|SX6F1oIhaa	you died and the best thing you can do is go on Yahoo?|`|8sZTc64Maa	You ain't a ghost.

So, since you're haunting your family's computer, does that mean that you're trying to prevent your wife from seeing any "Bad" movies or "love affair" e-mails? If I were you, I'd just haunt the woman that you had the affair with until she commits suicide. That way your wife won't be able to get mad.....Too much.|`|fpHblEtAaa	hmmm.. If you are one I hope u don't haunt us!

1Ad7jJgwaa	If they really wanted to help animals they wouldn't go around throwing red paint on their remains. The person will just have to go get another one. Instead, they'd be activists in programs against killing animals, and maybe influencing the standards and procedures animals go through in the process.<br>  <br>  To answer your question, they aren't being realistic, that's why.|`|ce26AOVzaa	Maybe because your fur is just killed so you can ware it. A cow is killed for meat and clothing. Why throw out the leather? <br>  <br>  animals are meant for eating and wearing in my eyes. I might be a little upset if I saw a endangered animal on your back. Like lion fur, or some rare kind of cat.<br>  <br>  In my eyes let them repopulate so we can kill them and eat them again....:/|`|70aa0db8082ddead46f656ecb978193aaa	I never really understood the whole "red paint on fur" thing...if the paint doesn't clean out, then the person will probably just go buy another one leading to the deaths of even more animals.<br>  <br>  It doesn't really solve anything other than promote lawsuits against yourself for vandalism.|`|XoUfUl6Yaa	That would constitute criminal trespassing and vandalism, as opposed to harassment and vandalism.|`|AA11146198	Leather couches (the real nice soft ones) are not real leather. The chairs in really luxurious studies and libraries are sometimes leather seats and leather bound books but chances are they are antiques and were not produced in this generation where people began the animal rights movement powerfully. As for the KFC etc, I don't know, most of those PETA ppl are very hardcore and although I do not agree with most of it, it is undeniable that animals suffer under the hands of many.|`|hnfTjH4paa	hahaha....|`|8ivnzNi5aa	Why throw anything on fur coats at all?  Fur is good.|`|Rg2ERXAtaa	heh,heh
aHLnNrOGaa	So...you're anti-feline?<br>  <br>  I wonder the same about homosexuality.  So many people misuse the word homophobe; when they mean anti-gay.|`|e0lfV7skaa	Phobia refers to both. <br>  <br>  A phobia is either 1) a fear of, or 2) an aversion to.<br>  <br>  So you do have p*ssyphobia!  ;)|`|ceQqYxtnaa	...aversion ***YEP --- same question asked 4 minutes later***|`|q7MQhS6baa	How about you 'don't like cats'?|`|XuJbFFtDaa	It's an irrational aversion, afraid or hate to someone/something. For example it's not a phobia if you just don't like cats, but if you feel sick everytime you see a cat, if you are scared of pigeons or if you hate and want to kill a person just because of his sexual orientation/race/whatev, that's phobia. If you don't like a black person because he's a bad person, that's not racist, if you don't like a person because of being black, that's racism.|`|sbaUUjhTaa	Phobias are an intense fear of something - spiders, heights etc.  If you just don't like cats then its 'dislike'.|`|zRPXczxAaa	You are entirely correct in your subtextual implication that the Greek language has been seriously warped to produce such hybrids as "homophobe" and "transphobe," whose actual meaning (if there were one) would be "one who is afraid of equals and 'trans,'" but which is now understood to be "one who hates" those things.  The proper Greek word for "hate" is "miso," as in "misandry" and "misogyny," which mean, respectively, a hatred of men, and a hatred of women.  So, instead of being an "ailurophobe," you are, properly, a "misailuros"--both of which conditions are, in my opinion, an affliction.

6aIuZZi7aa	I have never given it much thought. Perhaps it held significance for Anton LaVey, or perhaps he simply liked the name.|`|puNruxWFaa	LOL LaVeyans, Hollywood satanism. True satanists don't have a bible. Honesty, I think Anton Levay was a ******* retard.|`|ETFlWwgFaa	Like most things with LaVey: he found it amusing.|`|VhtyM9Bpaa	He was probably just doodling.

fC8OPOTkaa	some people lack confidence and don't know how to go about talking to people who approach them. like me i am relly not confident and no-one ever strikes up conversations with me.|`|dcd11iUwaa	some people build a wall and are shy and are not interested in communication.<br>  I'll talk to anybody. it never hurts to be polite.|`|0fhCbS7Daa	ok, i will tell you something. in my school, i am really popular and everyone knows me. in fact, everybody wants to be my friend. i am really difficult to talk to because i talk to only popular people and i look down on peopl who dress and behave somehow. really, it's nature. because  i am so popular, it's really difficult to talk to me. so it depends on where you are, what you are and those you hang out with.|`|AA12050428	Personality! Some people are just quiet and don't need to talk and others really enjoy a good chinwag.|`|ma7oJyuzaa	I think some people just find it so difficult to talk to some people but not others.<br>  <br>  Ross and Mike off of Friends comes to mind!|`|67EaIAvbaa	insecurity and fear.|`|1vgseyCqaa	Because liberal democrats confuse their identity with ideas and make conversation impossible.  They wear their causes like wardrobe, and if you do no approve they feel you are criticizing their hair or cloths or something as vain as that, and therefore you are immediately hated and the talk is over.|`|3se8BaJLaa	Some people just look approachable and give out the friendly vibe if you get my jist. they are always smiling and like i said its almost like you can see a "hi im friendly you can talk to me vibe" The impossible ones are because you are not approaching them either. He wants to talk and express his feelings but doesn't take the approach|`|mNkTbxrJaa	that a really good question! i have no idea i think but i think it has to do with cultures or personality or something there between the lines lol.... i personally think i would be a hard person to talk to.|`|Cfja6h4Kaa	It's just a matter of compatibility. Some people probably think you are easy to talk to, but others think it is impossible.|`|KbGP8z71aa	i think most depends on the vibe between two (or more people) as well as the mood of the said people. <br>  <br>  confidence plays a role too. but the vibes are paramont.|`|v4xIauuYaa	I think some people just don't want to get involved with others maybe they are just too busy with there own lives.|`|TXY6EAYqaa	I can talk to anyone but not about all topics.|`|v4DfbDEQaa	all to do with confidence, my confidence is always low unless i know the person really well|`|kWfGRPVQaa	I believe it depends on most peoples personalities - more open and willing to listen or just if they aren't, alot of times confidence also has alot to do with it.  Though sometimes I think if they've either experienced what you're talking about then they can relate to it and talk to you about it.  That's what I think.|`|JglGTCokaa	I guess it's because everyone is different. Some people you just can't talk to because they're just not sensible. And then there's others that are just really nice.
urs9AxiGaa	MAN, I AGREE 100%.<br>  <br>  The truth is that the media really could care less where Natalee or Elizabeth is. The main objective is to create more viewers and to sell sell sell... <br>  <br>  Most members of the media are really just hoping to find the missing girls cold decapitated body. Wishing that it will help to stimulate sales and leave their customers shocked and empty....... Except for that one burning question that always brings them back for more."WHO'S THE KILLER" <br>  : O : O : O<br>  <br>  THE MEDIA SEE IT AS A HOLLYWOOD MOVIE, AND IF YOU DON'T FIT THEIR CRITERIA. YOU BETTER BELIEVE YOUR AS# THAT YOUR NOT GOING TO GET  CASTED.|`|Y8QeBEXdaa	The answer is: because they are murdered by the people they are around - white men.<br>  <br>  I suspect that the manner in which these women disappeared would offer a clue. Usually they are jogging, partying in an exotic location, or exposed to strangers, mostly of the same race. <br>  <br>  Young, immature, wealthy white women are more likely to travel abroad and exercise lack of common sense when it comes to strangers. White people are more likely to buy life insurance as couples and therefore have the motivation to murder their spouse for it. <br>  <br>  Of course, this is all just a gross generalization. I suspect that actually you should look at this question the other way around to get your answer. Why are serial killers usually white men? Here is a study by a criminologist, which details the reasons why serial killers are more likely to be white. Look to the bottom of the article. <a href="http://www.lagriffedulion.f2s.com/serial.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.lagriffedulion.f2s.com/serial...</a>
BPO6roTOaa	Sex!|`|VncSMLMpaa	No problem, because the Lord Jesus Christ can be totally trusted by those who have faith in God and His plan and purpose for the world.<br>  <br>   I'm surprised that you're not smart enough to understand that. Maybe you haven't bothered to dust your Bible down and try to understand it. It takes time but you can do it if you get a move on.|`|3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	A person who thinks Jesus cannot be trusted is a person who doesn't know Jesus.|`|macZI2dzaa	No one finds Christ inadequate.

Jesus can be trusted. Drugs is not the answer and you know that. The problem my dear is Jesus is not doing what you want, what you think is best for you. You are suffering the consequences of your poor choices and you think maybe Jesus should just make life nice. It doesn't work that way. Life is tough even for believers. Jesus promised to walk with you through the hard times. He will be strong in your weakness, He will lead you in the path of righteouness. You may not be aware of it at the time, but when you look back over your life you will be very aware of His hand on your life. My dear trust in the Lord in the bad times. Instead of speaking negative words, start Thanking God for the joy that only He can give you. Praise is a spiritual weapon of warfare against our enemy, Satan. You fill the holes with words of Praise to God for the help only He can give you.|`|55db1dbbab55471fd7e483514f53d0a4aa	I am not sure because I have never found He cannot be trusted.

p6wwiQG3aa	Works proceed from faith, like apples proceed from an apple tree. They don't save us, but they are evidence of Salvation|`|mrzeXJ6Eaa	You answered your own question there. Allow me to attempt to clear up some confusion about this though. <br>  <br>  Jesus said to produce fruit in keeping with repentance. Jesus said to remain in Him and we are the branch and He is the vine. Apart from Jesus, we cannot produce fruit. We are dead.<br>  <br>  Imagine a dead branch trying to produce fruit in order to look alive. It's silly of course. On the other hand, a vine connected to a branch produces fruit. It's a sign of being alive.<br>  <br>  Same thing with faith. If we have a saving faith, we will be in Christ and we will do works. The works are a natural result of being saved.<br>  <br>  Ephesians 2:8-10  For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God— (9)  not by works, so that no one can boast.  (10)  For we are God's workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.|`|yHfsHp6naa	Yes, you don't have to do anything to have faith in religious nonsense.|`|g4AAZRuxaa	No|`|68lLAQnKaa	I guess that depends on what your definition of 'works' is.  In John 6:28-29-<br>  <br>  28They then said, What are we to do, that we may [habitually] be working the works of God? [What are we to do to carry out what God requires?] 29Jesus replied, This is the work (service) that God asks of you: that you believe in the One Whom He has sent [that you cleave to, trust, rely on, and have faith in His Messenger].<br>  <br>  Jesus himself said that the works of God are believing in the One who He sent! =)|`|FOzN3xwzaa	Works are for rewards in heaven, to help others, and to avoid consequences of sin in this life. <br>  <br>  Works are not to get into heaven.  Getting into heaven is only by believing in Jesus and His death and resurrection for sins. <br>  <br>  If you're doing works to get into heaven, then Galatians says that you are saying that Jesus died for nothing. <br>  <br>  You're not saying that, are you? <br>   <br>  You misunderstand James.|`|XpZumlkwaa	Example: Matthew 6:6.<br>  <br>  If you don't do the work of entering into that quiet place, your faith is dead.<br>  <br>  <br>  That first answer is based on rituals that no-one has to do.<br>  Rituals claim you are doing this to keep salvalvation. But it's the grace of God that gives us salvation through Yeshua, which His name means, YAH Saves.<br>  <br>  Bless your understanding.|`|zBkaqIWcaa	No, faith can not exist without works.  If someone "faith" does not lead that person to obey God and do what God commands His children to do, then that "faith" is not real.|`|7300b67211d400f8dc6e96e473093503aa	Faith and works go hand in hand. Faith brings us to a saving grace from God. Works is our gratitude. Only faith in Christ saves.There is nothing you can do to earn this salvation.|`|RgceFQ9Caa	No, and in the context of James it is a warning against the growing antinomianism of the early Church.|`|M8X0dIOZaa	Faith is showed by works. So without works, faith is dead or does not exist.|`|3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	I don't see how.  A person who is born again in Christ will naturally do the works of a person who is indwelt with God's spirit; it goes hand in hand.|`|332vXA6oaa	You have to have works to show that your faith is genuine. Imagine if Noah and his family only had faith and no works, all of them would have drowned in the deluge.

2059629ba703ea51b813a449b0cb4431aa	Of course they would think them true. It doesn't MATTER what the bible says, or how ludicrous it seems. If it's in the bible, they think it has to be true. End of story.|`|z7k8Jh7Aaa	If all that was in the Bible was stories, why would that be worth believing? The stories that are in the Bible exemplify God's power and how He has worked in human history. But what the Bible also contains is a hope for salvation- that God became man to suffer and die for man's sins, so that we wouldn't have to.

I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that the Bible was "breathed out" by God.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1: 11-12 tells us that the gospel was a revelation from Jesus Christ himself, which was recorded by Jesus disciples and Paul.<br>  <br>  God himself chose the disciples and the people whom He knew were going to spread His word and write the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors. The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist? Is He God? Why did He suffer on the Cross?<br>  2) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?<br>  <br>  Pasting a small part from the website.<br>  Visit the website to strengthen your faith in Jesus or to know more about Him.<br>  <br>  Jesus is God.<br>  <br>  1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus<br>  specifically.)<br>  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8<br>  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became<br>  flesh (John 1:1-14)<br>  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm<br>  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh<br>  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to<br>  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.<br>  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)<br>  8.

Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;<br>  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship<br>  is used in each place.)<br>  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John 8:58.<br>  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see<br>  Exodus 3:14.<br>  23.

9741a3f7ecd87afb6df1b22885eb0f22aa	He's still gay.  Being gay has absolutely nothing to do with who you sleep with, or whether you sleep with anyone.  It's the attractions that make one gay.  Since he claims he still has those, he is gay.  He would be what in Gay Christian circles would be "Side B", A Christian who acknowledges his homosexual attractions, but believes acting on them is against the Bible, and generally tries to lead a celibate life.

How can you "turn away" from what you are inside?  That is like saying I was born black but I really believe I am white so I am living my life as a white person. Impossible.  You are what you.

H7LZg5z0aa	While Joshua was, invariably, referring to the law that they had at the time, we should extend our meditation to include the entire Bible.  When we do as Paul told Timothy (II Timothy 2:15), we will know and understand what God wants us to do.<br>  <br>  The psalmist also had this in mind when he wrote that God's Word was hidden in his heart so that he would not sin against God.  (Psalm 119:11) This is what Joshua is telling the people.  Chances are that, if they had heeded Joshua's words, they would never had become slaves of other nations.|`|lJUyhMceaa	This specific verse refers to the books of the law (first five books of the O..T), simply because they did not have much of the O.T. when these words were pinned, and they did not have any of the N.T. yet.<br>  <br>  However, there are other verses that tell us that "all Scripture is given by inspiration of God..."  and "study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth"<br>  <br>  From these verses and others, we learn that we are to meditate, think, and study, all of the Bible, not just the law (first five books).  <br>  <br>  It would be good to mention that to understand how some of Scripture apply to us today, we must know and understand all of Scripture.  I'm sure you have seen many on this site who wants to pull one verse out of the Bible and condemn everyone with it.  This is not what the Bible is for.  It must be understood just like any other book to the extent that you have to know what the whole book says to understand one part.<br>  <br>  So yes, we are to medicate on it, but we also need to meditate on all the rest of it as well.|`|xo4iux9gaa	His Word is His Law.<br>  <br>  Obeying it always brings presperity|`|719261d758e0cebf5beeb6101b21166faa	Keep it in context and you know the answer. Traditionalists would say it refers to the Pentateuch (Five Books of Moses) only since it says clearly "7 Be strong and very courageous. Be careful to obey all the law my servant Moses gave you; do not turn from it to the right or to the left, that you may be successful wherever you go."<br>  <br>  There is little evidence that the Pentateuch was written by Moses or even existed before Ezra's time, but if the traditions hold true then Joshua 1:8 can only refer to the five books attributed to Moses. The commandments were on stone tablets, and so not a book.

Same with lesbians. So?<br>  <br>  I know it's not a scientific explanation as to why you think this way, but I can tell you now - reasoning this out starts with you, not us.

It depends on the person.  The str8 world has men who are metrosexual, & women who are pretty rugged.  They are still attracted to the opposite sex, & have relationships/married to the opposite sex.  Same is true in the LGBT world.  My girl is pretty feminine.  I am a tomboy is is more comfy in sports attire, but I will throw on my grown & sexy wear when I feel like it.  It gets annoying when we go out in mixed company, since we both get hit on by men who don't believe we're together (let alone married).<br>  <br>  In other words, people dress in the way that makes them feel the most comfortable.  People act in the way that make s them feel the most comfortable.  It's not just the LGBT community, it is dependent on the individual person.<br>  <br>  As far as what you see on TV & their depictions of LGBT?  Nothing but stereotypes.  You can't go by what the media feeds you, otherwise, all gay men are effeminate drama queens who are superfical, lesbains are so butch (ie ugly) that they can't get a man & have to settle for women.  I can't trust the medai, because they still have racial stereotypes that I, as a woman of color, have to squash EVERY DAY to the rest of the world.  I'm not even going into the double duty I have as a lesbian of color when it comes to squashing TV/Media sterotypes (the few times that black lesbians are even shown on TV, let alone in a positive light).<br>  <br>  And, I'm not offended.|`|x5nWWyylaa	personally<br>  i think your making a generalization<br>  i understand the media portrays gays and lesbians that way<br>  but they also portray blonde woman as complete bimbos.<br>  so yeah i just say<br>  down with narrow mindedness<br>  people can dress or act whatever way they want<br>  dressing boyish on a girl does not make them a lesbian<br>  and being a Feminine guy does not make them gay|`|T2h6Z6kCaa	1: Not ALL gays are like that.<br>  2: Not ALL lesbians are like that.<br>  3: I, honestly, don't have a clue either.<br>  4: I'm not offended.|`|AA12006309	You're generalizing.

I think it has little to do with sexual preference and more to do with personality, and frame of mind. I for one don't "act" feminine, but then again I don't feel comfortable wearing women's clothing, makeup, etc. It's just how they are. Just like some STRAIGHT women are more masculine then others, and i've noticed quite a few STRAIGHT men who care about their appearances just as much as anyone else. Also when you ask a question like this, and make it seem as if the general homosexual male and female act inversely to their  gender's personalities, you're bound to come across as ignorant.|`|8OXVSoe0aa	You're stereotyping an entire group of people.

And for your information, straight people are the ones wearing skinny jeans and tight polos. Not gay people.<br>  The majority of gay people don't act feminine. You just don't notice us because we act like everyone else. Are all black people thugs? Most black people on tv and movies are thugs but hat doesn't mean in the real world every black guy you see is gonna rob you.<br>  Yea and for that last part, straight guys also wear tight pants and pink shirts and will sometimes seem girly. That does not make them gay.|`|Gq8am0r5aa	My friends at school always said that if I hadn't told them, they wouldn't have guessed I was gay.  Since I came to university and gained a lot more independence (my dad was way over-protective) I have been able to be a little less subtle and dress/act how I feel comfortable dressing/acting.<br>  <br>  Because that what it's about.  We don't intend to look like girls (unless we're in drag but that's mostly for entertainment purposes lol) we just dress how we feel comfortable dressing.  I am perfectly comfortable being a man and have no intention of being mistaken for female, but I like to wear tight jeans because that is what I like to wear.  I feel comfortable in them.|`|InsBAcktaa	You are seeing stereotypes and not the real world.  As a transgender person I go to gay clubs because they are accepting of us.  I am not gay, but I can tell you the men there look like truckers and salesmen and bankers and carpenters... maybe 1 in 30 is wearing tight clothes and acting slightly more feminine.  Lesbians look like most other women who don't get dressy... sweatshirts and jeans are the norm.<br>  <br>  Now people can be both transgendered and homosexual but realize from the transgendered perspective it could be considered straight.  <br>  <br>  Just acknowledge that humans are not meant to be normal, we are meant to come in all color shapes, sizes, and identities in order to survive in any environment.|`|9frlO7pqaa	Honey! I am a little offended. For me, being gay and feminine comes naturally!|`|46rvOfL2aa	I'm not really offended, I never got the whole "feminine" thing either but I'm not gonna tell people how to live their lives. They can do what they want to do I suppose.<br>  I just know I'm not attracted to it...<br>  Just so you know I'm gay, and I don't act macho, but not feminine either. I'm kind of in between, people have asked me if I'm gay just because I don't like playing sports that much, but other than that you couldn't really tell I'm gay from a crowd of heterosexual men.<br>  For your last question though, many of us really don't make ourselves look like the opposite sex. As for the ones who do that though, are beyond me, but there's nothing wrong with them.|`|576e76ca46b6c4293f45926a8e75773caa	Hmm.. That's weird cause most gay and lesbians I know don't act like the opposite sex.<br>  Can't help you there. <br>  I'm a feminine lesbian.|`|MhfneF0xaa	This is stereotype. Not all gay guys are effeminate, not all gay girls are masculine.<br>  <br>  And when they pair up, it isn't always in contrasting styles.<br>  <br>  Masculine gay guys and feminine gay women aren't noticeable per se.
B0GujA9Aaa	Holocaust deniers piss me off. <br>  <br>  How much more proof do they need? <br>  <br>  I really hate when they say that it never happened because they are basically saying that my relatives (who died in the Holocaust) never existed or that they just some how disappeared. <br>  <br>  And I hate the look on my grandmother's face when she hears this kind of talk. She get's so worried that people will believe the Holocaust deniers and that it will just happen again.|`|isZ8eb98aa	Holocaust denial has been rampant in past decades. They don't think that it didn't happen, per se, but it didn't happen to that magnitude (i.e only 6000 were killed) But it is often used as a form of anti-semitism, by neo-nazi white supremacists, who say that the Jews made it up to get sympathy and money. <br>  People above me are saying that Middle Eastern countries, like Iran, started this. They do use it, sometimes, in Anti-Israel speeches (note: not ALL middle eastern countries), but I think it originated with Nazi groups. <br>  But no matter what they say, ELEVEN milllion people died- Jews, Poles, Romani[gypsies], Soviets, the disabled, homosexuals, etc. Eleven million people lost their lives terribly and to deny it is wrong.<br>  <br>  -Tila.|`|wTfY9AmPaa	No one says that. He is referring to a survey taken by usweek or some magazine where most of the people chose the answer that said the Holocaust never happened. But it isnt their fault.

The plans show the gas chambers, huge storage halls for corpses, and a crematorium.<br>  <br>  “It’s shocking, deeply shocking,” Tobias Prennzler, 27, a design student, told the paper, as he leant forward to decipher the signature of Heinrich Himmler, the head of the Nazi security machine. “This was 1941 and they were already drawing up plans for some kind of a death factory.

He was a very hard man, but the memory of what he witnessed with his own eyes, ears, and nose, haunted him for the remainder of his long life.<br>  <br>  If anyone so much as mentioned Belsen, Auschwitz, Buchenwald, or other of the Nazi extermination camps, he would burst into impassioned sobs as the sights, sounds, and smells of his first-hand experiences with the fruits of the Holocaust.<br>  <br>  To not believe the Holocaust took place in the face of mountains of evidence and testimonies is to refuse to admit that the sun is shining when it is burning one's face.<br>  <br>  It is, I suggest, a sure sign of mental incompetence to believe that what so many people saw and suffered through did not happen.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  QUILL

sfTPrMFpaa	Because French people do not care much about French.<br>  <br>  In Quebec, those signs say "Arrêt"<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.barraclou.com/photo/highway/arret.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.barraclou.com/photo/highway/a...</a><br>  <br>  Edit : Jane, they used to say both back in the 80', but now it's unilingual.|`|FEGtnUEcaa	Well, that's a question for French people. In Spanish speaking countries those signs (or their equivalents) say PARE. <br>  I don't know about other languages, but there is a coincidence in English and Spanish signs: PARE and STOP have both four letters. ARRETE (and maybe ARRETEZ) has many letters to fit in the same shape as PARE and STOP.|`|10bb153a928c9693ebec1b2660853526aa	English is (unfortunately, in a way) such a universal language now that many terms are just understood. Italians say "stop" quite often in spoken language, even though they should technically be saying "basta." <br>  <br>  America is just such a powerful country that a majority of the world learns English as their second language, meaning just about everyone does business in English. Not all people know (and are fluent in) English, but it's still very accepted as the common language between countries.<br>  <br>  Edit: Jane's also correct. In many European countries, they'll have their own signs. See Italian traffic signs here, for example: <a href="http://www.ideamerge.com/motoeuropa/roadsigns/#roadsigns_and_signals" rel="nofollow">http://www.ideamerge.com/motoeuropa/road...</a> But many countries have adopted the red hexagon look.|`|tQsxsuNPaa	They don't. <br>  <br>  Stop signs in Europe are red circles with a white bar horizontally across most of the middle. <br>  <br>  I believe that in Québec, they say Arrête/STOP.

As you can see, it says "STOP", but at highway tolls you will also find round signs with "Halte" written on them. <br>  <br>  There are fewer stop signs in France than in other countries. At an intersection without any stop signs, the person coming from the right has the priority. Unless you are on a major road outside cities. If you are on a priority road, a sign will tell you (it's a yellow diamond) and the other road will have a "give way" sign (an upside down red triangle).<br>  <br>  Here are all the signs that French drivers need to memorize:<br>  <a href="http://www1.securiteroutiere.gouv.fr/sig..." rel="nofollow">http://www1.securiteroutiere.gouv.fr/sig...</a><br>  They are classified into different categories: Interdictions, Obligations, Dangers, etc. Also, "pannonceaux" are the smaller signs attached to a sign which limit the obligation or interdiction to certain categories of drivers or certain times of the day, etc. For instance if you have a speed limit sign with a smaller sign underneath saying 3t, it means the speed limit applies only to trucks weighing at least 3 tons.|`|r7fz6RGPaa	As someone said, stopper is a French verb, actually the English verb adapted to French.<br>  As for the sign itself, well, even the French wikipedia doesn't really teach us why ... The weird thing is that actually France adopted the word "STOP" early (in 1954), before we started importing most of our new vocabulary from America (I'm exagerating), and at at time where the British signs said ... "HALT"!<br>  Wikipedia talks about a Geneva protocol about road signalisation in 1949 which maybe standardised the use of the word "STOP" (it says that England hadn't adopted the protocol yet, which might be why they used "HALT"), however I can't find any precise info about this protocol (besides, I don't know how many protocol were signed in Geneva during the XXth century but obviously many, so searching "Geneva protocol isn't of much help).<br>  Some talked, if I remember well about round signs with a triangle an "STOP" in it, these are the old ones which France stopped using in 1971 (although this old form is still recognised internationally: both are accepted but France just decided to use only the new ones)<br>  <br>  I've been living in France for 17 years (my whole life, actually) and I've never seen any "ARRET" sign ... (but the seem to be used in French Canada, according to wikipedia's pictures).

Denying the Holocaust means they can deny Israel's right to exist. Basically, Psalm 83 fulfills current day Islam, in terms of the words being spoken by them, most notably the president of Iran claiming Israel does not have a right to exist, and it also explains the near future situation of Islam when they will try annihilate the Jews to fulfill the Gog and Magog battle as mentioned in Ezekiel 38 and 39; however, God will overcome them and will cause them to know that He, whose name is Yahweh (not "the LORD" as written in most English versions), is the Most High. Muslims love to shout Allahu Akbar, which means Allah is the Greatest, but Yahweh will show them the He is actually the Most High.

Because, unless there's a law against them, they'll be there. In our minds, without thinking about it, we group things. Let's just say for instance there happens to be a bunch of people knitting across from a bunch of people in Army Uniforms. Now you'd naturally assume that the people knitting aren't the ones in the Army, the ones in the Army are the ones in the uniforms. <br>  However brilliant and easily accepted the thought may be, the Army Uniforms could easily be bought at any costume store, and you don't have to wear a uniform all the time so the people knitting could easily be in the Army.<br>  I don't really mind labels as long as they're general and don't mean anything insulting. What I can't stand, is when people try to pin you down into one specific and smallest possible category, which is impossible since every person's different.<br>  But we sadly can't stop people from labeling, it would be like trying to  stop time from passing on.|`|VzfloLJ9aa	im not homosexual but i have friends that are and im also not white and i hate when people discriminate against you and label you(or other people). im totally against it. i hate how prejudice people are against you guys, and how they always feel the need to call you names. im mean we're all people. it's not like calling us names and giving us labels are gonna change how we live. i wish people could just get over themselves and realize it makes no difference.|`|Gq8am0r5aa	People believe that part of knowing a person is knowing their sexuality.

As the years go on, people will start to put the Holocaust in a distant perspective, because there will be no one alive who remembered it, or who remembered people who lived through it, just like there is no one alive from the slavery years of the 1700's and 1800's. We know it happened, because it is in our history books, and part of our oral traditions and histories, but in reality, we do not know how life really was back then (because we are viewing it from hindsight) As time progresses, less and less people will see the need in trying to deny it because nobody really knows who owned slaves and who didn't. <br>  Also it has a lot to do with propaganda used in the modern wars. The Germans almost wiped out the Jewish race, and they tried to hide and cover up their operations. Although the German people probably knew what was going on, the truth came to them awfully one-sided. However, slavery was a part of everyday life for years. People knew it was going on, but didn't try to sugar coat the fact that it was occuring. Plantation owners never sought to "cover up" what they were doing.<br>  <br>  BTW Monkey Balls: You're a moron.|`|AA11280073	They are anti semites and they cannot accept that this is what happens when anti semitism is taken to its full conclusion.|`|AA10092510	The effects of slavery are still apparent, the effects of the Holocaust aren't so obvious, so it's easier to cover up the guilt feelings from the Holocaust by simply trying to deny or going as far to say it didn't happen.|`|74b388eca668facf7bdd1f57af916ab9aa	Many different reasons.  Depends on if they're the "good guys" or the "bad guys"<br>  <br>  For the bad guys: personal vendetta against the Jews or African Americans or just general hatred for whatever reason.<br>  <br>  For the good guys: historical accuracy.  A lot of academics say that the 6 million number dead Jews number is inaccurate, since the official numbers of the International Red Cross were much smaller, and a lot say that some slave owners treated their slaves as part of the family.  It is not because they don't think the Holocaust and slavery were bad, but I think it is so that things don't get blown out of proportion, and that things be accurately recalled.  If there is one exaggeration, psychos can use it to their advantage and claim that the exaggeration is there to subjugate their beliefs.|`|oMF6bXCZaa	I was in England at the time we found the camps, and let me tell you that I KNOW they existed and I saw the skeletons that were rescued, and saw the dead bodies in piles.<br>  <br>  I also know, personally very old seniors who were slaves and children of slaves, so in both instances millions of us know what is the truth.<br>  <br>  Those who do not believe either historical facts are bigots, racists and hate mongers who want THEIR troubled thoughts to go out amongst the positive people of the world, and stir up trouble, because that is what they thrive on.<br>  <br>  Very sad really, because their whole lives are one of unhappiness and hate, which means such a waste of the precious time we have on this earth.|`|wtzCUZ3eaa	Lots of reasons. Maybe because the World Almanac and every significant Jewish source in the world had their population at 15.6 million in 1939, then at 15.67 million in 1945. Maybe because higher traces of arsenic are found in the de-lousing facilities in the concentration camps than in the supposed "gas chambers". Maybe because in many countries anyone that has anything to say against the Holocaust is immediately imprisoned before their ideas can become known. Maybe because nothing was even known of the Holocaust until after the Allies had arrived in Germany and had the chance to fabricate whatever they want. Maybe because it conveniently gave the Jews an excuse to steal land from the Palestinians less than 2 years later (Not just any land, but land they held sacred. And lets not forget that Jesus was a Palestinian as well, since Judeah was renamed Palestine during Roman rule). <br>  <br>  Just a thought.<br>  <br>  Edit: Tessie, lol coming from you I would have to classify being a moron as a good thing :)  Btw if you're going to call me names at least dispute something that I said (since I can't be put in prison where I live).|`|MoUtk7cUaa	true.  i also say that gitmo doesn't exist too since they are mostly the deniers of the holocaust.|`|GoXutSkfaa	ehhh, it sounds like you worded that wrong.

God never was alone; as all of His Coordinate Deities (Trinity and Creator Sons of God and others) were with Him in all Eternity on perfect, infinite-sized Paradise. God sent His Coordinate Creator Son out in a space-time universe to start creating finite, experiential beings, including many humans.  God and Jesus and the Holy Spirit all have put Their perfect spirits within all normal humans to be able to experience growth in space-time into perfection with as as each of us !

Exodus 20:6 but showing love to a thousand generations of those who love me and keep my commandments.2) to revere His name. Exodus 20:7 You shall not misuse the name of the Lord your God, for the Lord will not hold you anyone guiltless who misuses his name. 3) To worship Him. Exodus 20: 8 Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy. On this day we gather ourselves together and worship Him. 4) To honor our parents. Exodus 20:12 Honor your father and your mother, so that you may live long in the land the Lord your God is giving you. And 5) To love one another. He wants to prove to the devil that He is still in control of this earth and man. <br>  This would be a long story but I have to tell you. Satan was an angel created by God. But he was too ambitious that he claimed to be like God. So there was war in heaven. Revelation 12:7-9 And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels. And prevailed not; neither was their place found anymore in heaven. And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him. A rebellion was staged by Satan called Lucifer. One third of God's angel joined Lucifer. God's name was blasphemed. God wanted to regain the prestige of His name and to create also a place where to put Lucifer and the rebellious angel. So God created earth. And Lucifer and his followers were sent to earth. But the earth was dark and gloomy. So God created it as it is now. But He created a special place for man, the Garden of Eden. This Garden was located in the land surrounded by four rivers. The two rivers are visible until now which are the Euphrates and the Tigris Rivers. Then He created Adam and put him there. He saw Adam was lonely so He formed Eve from Adam's ribs. The two lived in the Garden until Lucifer tempted Eve. The two disobeyed God and God drove them out from the Garden of Eden. They lived outside the garden and their seed replenished the whole earth. And Lucifer was authorized by God to do his tempting activity. Genesis 3:15 And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and he seed; it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel. Jesus was the Seed of the woman (nation) Israel. Satan bruised his heel on the cross of Calvary. But Jesus Christ will bruise his head at His second coming. Si Jesus came as a Savior of the world but many rejected him because of Satan. He was rejected even by His own people and that is why God had to cleanse the Jews over and over again. But at the end they will look upon Him the One whom they pierced. Zechariah 12:10 And I will pour the house of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and supplications: and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his only son, and shall be in bitterness for him, as on that is in bitterness for his firstborn. So Israel will finish history of mankind. Because God has chosen them to fulfill all the prophecies. They will glorify the name of God in the face of the earth to prove His power and His great might. Israel will anoint Him as the Most Holy God. With Ishmael's descendants (the Arabs and the Muslims)  they will regain the reverence for His name. Muslims, Christians and Jews will be gathered together to magnify and glorify God then Jesus will come again. God wants His Name to be revered by all His creation to shame the devil. All these things will be fulfilled as God had set to happen.|`|d8d70f3ce62baea0a8cb1a01e21e326faa	since we all have different personalities & features and we are created in his image this is his way to show case Himself!|`|p6wwiQG3aa	LOVE skippy<br>  <br>  <br>  you know that stuff that exists beyond logic?|`|oVHFz52Laa	We are here for God's reasons and for His pleasure|`|mJN6edN9aa	The theory that I have heard (and given some credence to) is that God has knowledge, but no experience.

LjsRfaskaa	The quantum physicists are saying that energy is consciousness. Thought is pure energy, and energy and matter are interchangeable.<br>  <br>  We are not an ego, not a physical body with spiritual aspirations, but the complete opposite. This is science saying this. <br>  <br>  Matter is an energy vibrating at a particular dense frequency. We can pass through water because water is vibrating at a less dense frequency than we are. And we can't pass through rock because the rock is vibrating at a much denser frequency than we are. <br>  <br>  If we want to pass through rock, we need to make our own frequency denser that the rocks. This is supposedly what happened with the Philadelphia experiment. People burst into flame, became merged with the deck and ship. It's not a good idea to play with such things. :)<br>  <br>  Practicing Shaman... quantum physics rocks.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	That is the argument of Aristotle in the Physics and in De Caelo.|`|AA11297267	huh?<br>  <br>  Matter-energy and energy-matter conversions happen all the time.

SXB3I6Vraa	I have answered this before, but it can't hurt to do it again.<br>  <br>  The problem with this question is...that evolutionists will simply equivocate on the definition of "speciation" every time they are called out on it. Essentially they'll just keep lowering the bar for themselves, to the point that even if two animals can genetically mate and produce fertile (non-sterile) offspring, they could still be classed as different species. Under many evolutionists defintions, even different breeds of dogs would have to be considered different "species" because of reproductive isolation, i.e., they simply choose not to mate with each other, or cannot (chiwawas and great danes). They also attempt to sneak the processes of plants into the equation, quite fallaciously.<br>  <br>  There is a good article here exposing many of the fallacies:<br>  <a href="http://www.national-anthems.net/forum/article/misc.immigration.canada/244362" rel="nofollow">http://www.national-anthems.net/forum/ar...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Also, this is the clever little language loophole that evolutionists use:<br>  <br>  They typically say that two creatures that are reproductively isolated are different species.<br>  <br>  reproductive isolation is a category of mechanisms that prevent two or more populations from exchanging genes...Reproductive isolation can occur either by preventing fertilization, or by the creation of a degenerate or sterile hybrid, such as the case with the common mule and the hinny.<br>  <br>  However<br>  <br>  Pre-zygotic barriers to fertilization include everything from a physical barrier (such as an ocean) formed between two populations, to ethological (behavioral) differences, to errors in cell division that cause incompatibility between populations.<br>  <br>  Yes that is right - if an animal pair simply chooses not to mate or if they are simply prevented from possibly mating by geographical barriers, then viola! speciation event for the evolutionist.<br>  <br>  It is quite easy to make science and evidence say whatever you want it to say when you control the definitions of the terms that you are using to support your own arguments.|`|7OzS3Dedaa	Tears of Oberon. Nice link -- thanks. <br>  <br>  An excellent article debunking the so-called speciation events that evolutionists use to mislead and propagandize people into believing evolution. It demonstrates these speciation events are dubious at best, and really have nothing to do with Darwinian evolution. These so-called speciation events are just hybridization, and/or the blending of 2 already existing species to produce another organism with blended characteristics. They simply involve the shuffling around or mixing of already existing genetic material. It's like if one bred a donkey + horse to produce a mule -- that is your speciation event. <br>  <br>  None of these so-called speciation events happens through the build up of mutations and natural selection, leading to new and additional genetic material with new genetic functions. Of course, evolutionists are happy to let people think they are, because they are propagandists for the cause -- promoting a belief in evolution. It is why they sell you this speciation propaganda in the first place. They're like a used car salesman -- not straight with all the facts, and leave out pertinent information in the hope that the buyer is duped. <br>  <br>  The essential problem with evolution is this: what mechanism is there to build up new genetic material with new genetic functions? In other words, how do you get from a bacterium like E. Coli with 4,800 genes, to a worm with 19,000 genes? You need at a minimum 14,200 new genes representing millions and millions of new base pairs. Evolutionists propose chance mutations with natural selection as the mechanism. Problem is, there are no examples whatsoever of chance mutations (with natural selection) building up new and additional genetic material with new genetic functions. Since evolutionists don't have the examples to demonstrate this, they throw as much mud against the wall as possible to make it look like they have real evidence for evolution.|`|7oetZ4I3aa	yo|`|LjsRfaskaa	Evolution creates new sub species. As a particular organism adapts to its local environment.<br>  <br>  Strange things can happen though, in an experiment with a salamander and a frog egg.

Scientists indeed have a funny definition of "species." It has no bearing on the biblical creation record, however, since the bible mentions "kinds" not "species."<br>  <br>  So, have scientists observed one type of animal evolve into another type? Have they observed something like, say, a dog evolve into a bear? The answser is no.<br>  <br>  The domestic dog is in fact a good case against evolution. It is the most widely varietied species on the planet, yet dog breeds can all still interbreed (the sperm can still fertilize the egg) with one another. In fact, dogs can still interbreed with wolves, their ancestors of millenia ago. So, although scientists may claim they are different "species," they are still all of the same "kind."|`|oKoABzNtaa	Yes.

If there is a God, I would like to believe that he wouldn't care about things like church and sexual preference and all the ridiculous things people who believe in religion argue about.

How can you tell the difference between Canadians vs US citizens vs Germans vs any other Caucasian based country?  Your question is trying to determin race via geographical boundries.

A former friend got a car from an organization that helps welfare mothers or jobless people get transportation.  They fix the vehicles, then sell them with a 2 yr warranty  much below market value.  The payment of 50 to 90 per month includes the insurance.  I have  only heard of this one organization in VA.  It is needed everywhere.

hj76FSKdaa	Good works are the natural result of a saving faith -- although I do not mean that we should make a naughty and nice list, to determine whether we are indeed saved.  The point is about cause and effect.  Being saved leads to (or causes) the good works.  Doing good works does not save a person.|`|RTaimrg7aa	Western thought and perhaps luxury has placed a division between what you believe and what you do.  In ancient middle east they were inseparable.  Faith (in greek pistus) and belief (pistuo) are the same thing.  What you believe is what you do, how you act and how you treat others.  <br>  Salvation is by faith, but Faith without works isn't true faith.  Works is the evidence of true faith.|`|0f6a1cdae0a3ce3617b1109a091741bdaa	Salvation is by faith alone. The works is the result of that faith...not an addition to it.<br>  <br>  To better explain: A Christian does goes works because they are a Christian and those good works are what God has asked them to do to show their love for their fellow man.<br>  <br>  A Christian does not use works to GET TO HEAVEN...but because he has already been PROMISED HEAVEN.|`|KmnbjZIdaa	I can understand why works cannot be the basis of salvation because a good fruit does not necessarily come from a good tree.  During the campaign period a lot of good works are done by politician to their constituents but it does not follow that they are being done by a good person.  On the other hand, it is an easy thing to give an assent to faith in Christ without committing to a converted life.  The catholic view is that faith like a seed has to grow and bear fruit.  This means a change of heart and a continuing transformation so that the christian faith enables a person to become like christ.|`|puNruxWFaa	"Faith without works is dead."<br>  <br>  there's your answer, man. It's in my ******* bible.|`|9zM6QFEOaa	being saved depends on who you are. <br>  if you are born parallized and can't move all you need is faith.<br>  but if you are healthy and have a lot of money, well the lord has blessed you with tools. this person has to work. faith alone can not save him. <br>  can you imagine all the good this man can do, but instead he sits around reading his bible all day doing nothing , i think that would be a sin.<br>  i think he should get up and preach and help the sick and if he has the money, build a church so everyone will have a place to go worship god. <br>  we are all indeviduels to god, and we will all be judged according to what we did. and what we didn't do.|`|e67045ea08edd6bf714e0243622a0defaa	I believe that salvation is metaphorical.

How could you ever hope to be eternally with a being of pure love when you do not even accept Him?|`|G4JHpKogaa	I read the Bible, but I also ask God to help me with answers And he does within his time. His time is the right time; his way is the right way. I will tell you the easiest way why we beleive in Jesus to enter heaven, because he deserves our love, respect and our beleif towards him because of the cruel punishment he received to save us from eternal punishment. He saved us if he did not come down from heaven, than every single soul would have gone straight to hell without God having mercy on his children. Satan was mad because he wanted all of us to eternal death.|`|B3CTEcVhaa	Because you're dumb/brainwashed to believe that there's a God or Jesus.

And then Jesus rose from the dead. <br>  <br>  Only Jesus is acceptable payment for sins.

Jesus is calling to the people, imploring them to get on His lifeboat. His is the only one that's seaworthy - all the others have holes in them, and will sink if the people get into them, and they will drown. Some of the people on the sinking Titanic say, "How DARE He say that His lifeboat is the only one that we can get saved on! There are plenty of other lifeboats!" Gradually, the Titanic completely sinks, and those who refused to get on His lifeboat and stayed on the Titanic, as well as those who got on the bad lifeboats, all drowned.

"Christ") is a monotheistic religion[1] centered on the life and teachings of Jesus as presented in the New Testament.[2]<br>  <br>  Adherents of Christianity, known as Christians,[3] believe that Jesus is the only begotten[4][5] Son of God and the Messiah (Christ) prophesied in the Hebrew Bible (the part of scripture common to Christianity and Judaism). Christian theology claims that Jesus Christ is a teacher, the model of a virtuous life, the revealer of God, as well as an incarnation of God, and most importantly the savior of humanity who suffered, died, and was resurrected to bring about salvation from sin.[6] Christians maintain that Jesus ascended into heaven, and most denominations teach that Jesus will return to judge the living and the dead, granting everlasting life to his followers. Christians call the message of Jesus Christ the Gospel ("good news") and hence label the earliest written accounts of his ministry as gospels.|`|Ex4Lv68yaa	I'm pretty certain that most christians, no offense, have interpreted this in a very limited way.  <br>  <br>  What is clearly meant, to me anyway, is that when one adheres to the "teachings" of Jesus, which is Love, kindness, gentleness, self control, patience, etc, one can experience heaven within - mind as well as body.  Everything having to do with "morality" is what Jesus taught.<br>  <br>  There have been several teachers over the centuries that were on the same page.  Gandhi, Buddha to name a couple.  However, the authors of the bible added their own personal beliefs to their writings, which in turn has thrown man kind into a chaotic religious frenzy.  :)<br>  <br>  I personally believe that healthy morals, as well as the above mentioned characteristics, and leading a healthy lifestyle for the greater good has all the ingredients for admission into heaven.  :)  <br>  <br>  Jesus never said to seek religion, he said to seek the Truth and the Truth will set you free.  In my opinion, he was speaking of one's own Personal Truth.  Because coming in to my own Truth has set me free 'indeed.'  :)  I am at peace.<br>  <br>  Labeling myself or joining an organized religion had nothing to do with it...neither one is required or necessary.|`|jxDhbE31aa	Sometimes I think that this was Gods plan for OUR benefit, not so much for His.

There will be so many you can't count them. " and so it is now and forever like the sand of the sea and stars in the heavens many, many, many, many and many......until the end of the earth. Abraham's seed is everyone that ever existed in the world, so that is the bad and the good, Hitler being one and many other. As man we think people like Hitler was bad. The fact is we are all come short,not God, of the real human being that God can choose from Abraham's family and call them His sons so He(GOD) sent Jesus to do the work for us, some don't do this because they try to do it their way. So God steps aside and lets them be free to do what they want. God never forces anyone to do good or bad. Man already knows by his nature to do good or bad.

nqMAUOwsaa	I really don't consider this to be gossiping.  If she was posting information like that on Facebook and you and another friend were just speculating she may be pregnant then I really don't think there is any harm.<br>  <br>  Gossiping would be going around telling people your friend is pregnant without confirming and/or getting her approval.<br>  <br>  However, word did make it back to your friend.  Like you said, you didn't like when your mother was telling people you were pregnant.  You apologized, that's all you can really do.|`|sy7ytm9Kaa	All gossip is horrible and yes you were gossiping.   It's a good gesture that you apologized.  I am sure things will be back to normal with her soon.   Keep you lips zipped going forward.  No one likes being talked about unless it is praise.|`|24cfb9540386b800bb43a544c412b806aa	You are a good gossip. You were right. If you were saying untrue things, then I would say you were a bad gossip.|`|WuhIoS1laa	It depends on how many people you speculated to. Talking with the one friend and wondering about the second girl's state is not gossip. <br>  <br>  Having that same thought out loud to everyone you meet who might know her is. Or posting it on your blog or facebook. That's just plain ol rumor mongering.<br>  <br>  If you only spoke about it to Friend #1, and it got back to Friend #2, then Friend #1 is the gossip. <br>  <br>  For her part, Friend #2 - if her secret was that she was pregnant - did this to herself.  How do you say "I've got a secret.." on a public web page and not expect anyone who reads it to try and guess? If it's a real secret, keep your yap shut and don't post about it. <br>  <br>  And finally, if she was known to be trying to get pregnant, why was it a secret to finally BE pregnant? <br>  <br>  The whole thing seems like drama over nothing.|`|676ffb2c003e629d54b40e0eb68860f4aa	If she didn't want anyone to know she should not have put her status as sick and tired. You were just talking to your friend I do not see that as gossip.|`|iTEf1dP3aa	That was a horrible way of gossiping! First of all you assumed she was pregnant, she never clarified that with you nor did you take the time to ask. It might have been a secret for a reason....What kinda gossip is ok? No, shes not overreacting.|`|25d446cf62508e0d3ad669755f76bfb8aa	Nobody likes to think they were the topic of someone else's conversation, especially when it involves something as personal as pregnancy. What you did is really rather normal between friends (I would worry about telling the friend you were gossiping with ANYTHING in the future), but her reaction was pretty normal, too, especially for someone that is pregnant. Just be careful in the future. We all learn these lessons the hard way, so don't beat yourself up about it, just be more selective about what you discuss, and with whom, in the future and hopefully it won't happen again.

355JLlcLaa	Moral behaviours and laws weren't instituted by religions, although religions do try to explain their origin through myth, and claim that they emanate from a deity or deities. There is some disorder now even among religious people, and despite laws, but the most successful people will be those who have most order among themselves - it's a survival factor, and is not dependent on belief in a deity.<br>  <br>  The basic "moral" behaviour of doing favours is something that developed over millions of years of natural selection. We are "programmed" to repay favours with favours in return. Those whose behaviour is faulty in this regard get less favours from others. This is the so-called golden rule, discovered by Greek philosophers and included in the sermon on the mount. Other species display this behaviour too.<br>  <br>  As our way of life became more complex, we've had to adapt rules and laws to facilitate our more complicated way of life. There are differences from culture to culture, and from time to time. <br>  <br>  In ancient times, a vengeful God would have been invoked as the source and guardian of these "laws", frightening most people into obeying them and into stoning those who didn't. It would have been considered better to kill wayward individuals than risk divine retribution on the community. This reason, perhaps watered down, is what many religious people believe make people good; but the real reason is more biological, and belief in a deity, or hell, is not needed for good behaviour.|`|TDVIb4SBaa	Morals are just that ,I was raised to adhere to morals not because I was threatened with fire and brimstone but because it was the correct thing to do.Seems to me these days we have gone to far the other way morals are not important anything goes,if it takes fear to instill morals into young people then so be it ,rather that than kiddies having babies at 12 and 13,ok maybe I am old fashioned but a strict moral upbringing did me no harm and I am afraid that is lacking in many homes today|`|b32jC7pGaa	What morals of relilgion? We have laws in a secular society which define behavior that won't be tolerated. What more do you need?|`|yHfsHp6naa	Yes, but you have to remember the religionists can't be moral without the threat of hell.|`|89MKzLl3aa	If you're American, and as long as there is separation of church and state, and freedom, then no.|`|C42YeDPuaa	Morals without religion are what we like to call 'ethics'.|`|v0BCIQpnaa	Focus on Jesus and the Father's loving embrace.<br>  <br>  The only people who fear hell are those who choose it as there destiny!<br>  <br>  Bri ; )|`|KmULmT7Baa	Yeah, it's called atheism|`|fa69e0b2d073786cb9c8d9e0436625a2aa	Why should we have morals at all if when we die, our bodies just rot in the ground?

But he who fears has not been made perfect in love.<br>  <br>  =========================<br>  THis of course means that you are wrong in your assumption.|`|3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	Truly knowing God has nothing to do with fear.  However, if you wish to avoid discussing anything about hell, do what it seems about 95% of the people do on this site:  ignore the bible.|`|AA11297267	Which "morals" are you talking about?<br>  The ones that the christian god uses when he wipes out all of humanity except a few people on a boat 'cause he decides he screwed up by making them?<br>  The ones where daughters get their father drunk and have sex with him, with god's approval?<br>  The ones where god wipes out two entire cities, including innocent children and animals, because he didn't like what they were doing with their wankers?<br>  The ones were Holy King David sees a naked bathing beauty on a rooftop, decides he must have her, so he sends her husband off to be killed then takes her for his own...and according to the bible he's the best, most moral king ever?<br>  <br>  I could go on and on, but I think you get the point.<br>  Religious morals are, for the most part, arbitrary and full of sick things that a moral atheist wouldn't do.  So no thanks -- you can take religion's morals and toss it out with the rest of religion.<br>  <br>  Peace.|`|Op81lhjuaa	People do it all the time. It is one of the oldest sins in the book. It is called idolatry. You are creating a God to suit yourself. This is only One God. Only one way of salvation (Jesus). It is simply you pay for you own sins for eternity in Hell or Jesus Paid you fine at the cross. If you choose to pay you own fine just remember you can never satisfy God yourself and this is why Hell will be eternal. Why not Repent and put your trust in Jesus Today?|`|r8rykCkGaa	Sure keep the morals, and if you're born again you have nothing to worry about as far as eternity goes.  No need to fear unless you've denied Christ.  Then you would be in trouble.|`|7ylYxklsaa	Because a good handful of them have openly admitted that they wouldn't be good people without the fear of hell. Kind of sad IMHO.

I'm beginning to think that too many people are "hoping" there's a hell just because people don't believe the same way they do.<br>  That in itself is not very christian, and inevitably, it's all up to God, anyway.  I think those seriously judgmental people have a lot more to worry about than jew, muslims, buddhists or anybody.  For crying out loud people - get over your own piety and think about your own salvation before you go condemning people - IT'S NOT YOUR JOB!|`|yc6S4iHDaa	No. Christians are supposed to believe that God is merciful. This means if someone is raised as a jew or as a muslim, they were ignorant and their judgement will be based upon their moral conscience in life and how they served their God.<br>  <br>  Let's take an example. Muslims believe in God. They call him Allah. Jesus is God, therefore, Jesus is Allah. They still believe in Jesus, and the same goes for the jews. <br>  <br>  It's not like one God doesn't exist, and that Allah is fake and that Jesus is real or vice versa, it solely has to deal with how you lived your life according to how you were raised. If you never knew Jesus, then you cannot be sent to hell.<br>  <br>  The mentality that "All you need to do is say you believe in Jesus" is crap. If that were true, I could be running around praising Jesus and killing people. It is that type of mentality that gives Christians a bad name, as that is not really the Catholic Church's teaching or Jesus' teaching as well.|`|FOzN3xwzaa	Being nice to people won't pay for your sins. <br>  <br>  We're all sinners. <br>  <br>  All the good deeds in the world done by you, won't pay for even one of your sins. Nothing else can pay for your sins, except..............<br>  <br>  Jesus already paid for our sins when He went to the cross and died. And then Jesus rose from the dead. <br>  <br>  Only Jesus is acceptable payment for sins. You must simply believe in Jesus alone for salvation, to be saved. <br>  <br>  Either you have Jesus as your payment for your sins, or you pay for your sins in eternal torment in hell. That is the choice before you.|`|7oetZ4I3aa	in reality there is no heaven and hell<br>  <br>  but what seems so peculiar to me in all three religions (christianity, islam, and judaism) are all built off each other, jews are the old testament christians are the new and muslims are a mixture of both|`|4Uyv7T5Vaa	Please read about "Religion as described by Quran" and " Islam as described by Quran" to make your own decision.<br>  <br>  What Quran Says About “Religion”<br>  (Deen)<br>  <br>  The Religion before Allah is Islam (submission to His Will): Nor did the People of the Book dissent therefrom except through envy of each other, after knowledge had come to them. But if any deny the Signs of Allah, Allah is swift in calling to account.  [3:19]<br>  <br>  Say: "Verily, my Lord hath guided me to a way that is straight,- a Religion of right,- the path (trod) by Abraham the true in Faith, and he (certainly) joined not gods with Allah."  [6:161] <br>  <br>  Who can be better in Religion than one who submits his whole self to Allah, does good, and follows the way of Abraham the true in Faith? For Allah did take Abraham for a friend.  [4:125] <br>  <br>  If anyone desires a Religion other than Islam (submission to Allah., never will it be accepted of him; and in the Hereafter He will be in the ranks of those who have lost (All spiritual good).  [3:85]<br>  <br>  “The Religion of Allah”<br>  (Deeni Allah)<br>  <br>  Do they seek for other than the Religion of Allah.-while all creatures in the heavens and on earth have, willing or unwilling, bowed to His Will (Accepted Islam), and to Him shall they all be brought back.  [3:83] Say: "We believe in God, and in what has been revealed to us and what was revealed to Abraham, Isma'il, Isaac, Jacob, and the Tribes, and in (the Books) given to Moses, Jesus, and the prophets, from their Lord: We make no distinction between one and another among them, and to God do we bow our will (in Islam)." [3:84]  If anyone desires a religion other than Islam (submission to God), never will it be accepted of him; and in the Hereafter He will be in the ranks of those who have lost (All spiritual good). [3:85]<br>  <br>  And thou dost see the people enter Allah's Religion in crowds, [110:2]  Celebrate the praises of thy Lord, and pray for His Forgiveness: For He is Oft-Returning (in Grace and Mercy). [110:3]  <br>  <br>  The woman and the man guilty of adultery or fornication,- flog each of them with a hundred stripes: Let not compassion move you in their case, in a matter prescribed by Allah, if ye believe in Allah and the Last Day: and let a party of the Believers witness their punishment.

Allah chooses to Himself those whom He pleases, and guides to Himself those who turn (to Him). [42:13]  And they became divided only after Knowledge reached them,- through selfish envy as between themselves.

IQT1BFjDaa	Deiphobus told Aeneas how he was killed. "That torch, that we thought should bring light to the dancers, was a sign for the greeks, who were waiting for it in the ships to attack the city. while the enemies were entering in Troy, I went home to sleep, unaware. Hele, my good wife, having taken all my weapons from the house and opened the door, invited Menelaus in the house, who ran in the room with his friends, holding the wepons. I, who couldn't resist them  for long, died for these wounds. Now I stay here, always with the same wounds." Said that he prayed for the greeks and above all Helen to be punished in the same manner.<br>  <br>  To tell the truth, those *** didn't help me much. And the translation is not so good, I'm afraid.

grYkoDaraa	it's very normal|`|H2IqzG12aa	More and more common, maybe.  The old idea that you were either 100% gay or 100% straight is apparently false, and anyone can have an attraction to the "wrong" sex, with the right person at the right time under the right circumstances.  The problem is with labeling ourselves.  People are just complex to be permanently pigeon-holed.  There are a lot of questions here from teenagers who swear that they're "100% straight...but there's this one guy (or girl) in my class..."  As long as there's no line they have to go stand in or some box they have to check on some form, the less time worrying about it and the more time enjoying life the better.|`|NQ3eETlYaa	Yes, definitely.|`|W4ZxbmcEaa	Lots.  And lots and lots and lots.  Really - don't worry! :)|`|3w1u6mQJaa	yes its normal|`|cx1AmMd4aa	thats like asking "do people like food?" <br>  so in other words YES|`|46rvOfL2aa	I thought I was straight too at one point too. But as for questioning their sexuality. I'd think that's pretty normal, it's when you get the amazing moments of "Wow, now I get what people are saying when they say somebody's hot!"<br>  Now if you're completely sure about your sexuality I don't want to try to influence you, you are who you are.<br>  But if you are, perhaps there's a chance you're only slightly attracted to guys?|`|ANOBEJPXaa	ABSOLUTELY. With your hormones all over the place, your teenage years aren't really the ideal time to question your sexuality, since teenagers go through sooo many changes and a lot of people tend to view that subject as taboo, but we do it anyway. There are lots of lesbians that like gay porn and vise versa. That's like asking 'Do you need to breathe?' Unless you're a vampire, the answer will always be yes.|`|9frlO7pqaa	Honey, it is completely normal. When I first found out I was gay, I was in the process of questioning. But i realized that guys are more attractive than girls.|`|Tja9u0uPaa	That is the time when most every teenager questions their sexuality.|`|RISe0UYAaa	It certanly is.

npTZTzWRaa	as a statistican, I can tell you that a little knowledge is a dangerous thing, particularly in statistics.<br>  <br>  For instance, lots of people use statistics to 'prove' blacks commit more crimes than whites. However, their argument is flawed because they only look at the crimes blacks typically commit. Not to mention it would be expected for their to be higher rates of certain crimes in black communities because they are generally poorer, this would be the case with any poorer group of people. The people who say blacks commit more crimes  also ignore white collar crime like identity theft, embezzlement, toxic dumping, corporate crimes, real estate fraud etc.<br>  <br>  The argument is bunk. In fact, when you measure the crimes by the amount of damage the crimes create (in terms of dollars lost and human suffering), the exact opposite is true. Whites are responsible for the vast majority of crimes done to society.<br>  <br>  Best defense? Learn statistics and use them correctly and fairly.|`|JOdlqhQwaa	Not you again!

vpYY46Qgaa	IS it bad if you have fantasies about one of your teachers?  NO!  Fantasies exist mostly because we know that in reality, we cannot or should not engage in the act.  Most fantasies are about TABOO sex or that which is deemed bad or wrong in reality.  <br>  <br>  If you had sex with your hs teacher, than the question would be different.  <br>  <br>  As a college professor myself, I know for a fact that many of my students have a crush on me and many have admitted that they have sexual fantasies about me.  Some of them have confessed their desires covertly in between the lines in their papers, while others straight up write it out and still, I have had some come to my office and straight up offer themselves to me.  <br>  <br>  As flattering as it is to be desired in this way by some very beautiful students, both males and females, (im not bi, but beauty is not gender bound), I know what my purpose is in their life and that is to teach them about classroom subject matter and nothing else.  <br>  <br>  I have also dated FORMER students;  students who graduated and went on to 4 year universities and then got back in touch with me years later and was told by them that they too had fantasies about me when they were my students.  <br>  <br>  I think that the most important things here is this.  Fantasy is totally healthy as it allows us to engage in taboo sex in our minds, but nobody is hurt.  Also, if you ever do approach your teacher, it is his responsiblity to enforce the boundaries and NOT engage with you.  As a hs student, you are still young and impressionalbe and as an adult and an educator it is his responsibility to impress nothing upon you except classroom subject matter.  <br>  <br>  Oh, and by the way, teachers are human too and maybe fantasizing about his students as well.  I do, but I NEVER act on it and NEVER will.  Thank God for fantasies!  <br>  <br>  Take care! And ignore the homophobic males that call you gay.  Those that are most homophobic about males that are bi or gay are often afraid of their own sexual desires because they feel "Funny, giddy and weird" about certain males.  Point? When a male has gay tendencies and tries to deny them, they manifest themselves through homophobic behavior.  Also, homophobic behavior is often mimiced behavior by those who have no thought process of their own, so they mimic their homophobic friends.  ( I had a freind in HS who was a big homophobe.  At 33, I saw him in the gay pride parade wearing a dress!) Go figure!  Anyway, when in doubt about a fantasy, ask yourself, if that which is you do can harm anyone in anyway.|`|SQ2FKKayaa	depends what kind|`|lGKq9NXbaa	as long as you don't act on those fantasies, i don't see why.

Tell him that he can pray for you and that you will let him know if you ever decide to seek God.|`|uFAoq4idaa	You know who is doing the not interested activity in you? It is Satan. He had deceived Eve and trapped Adam. The reason why God had to send Jesus into the world just because of him. Genesis 3:14-15 So the Lord God said to the serpent:Because you have done this, you are cursed more than all cattle, and more than every beast of the field; on your belly you shall go, and you shall eat dust all the days of your life. And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her Seed; He shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise His heel. So Jesus came into this world through a woman which is the nation of Israel. He is the Seed. Through Jesus as the Seed of Israel God's people will be gathered. And Satan the devil had to gather his seed also. Everyone who hears the gospel of salvation but had not believed in it are considered the seed of Satan or the devil. You are blessed to have parents who care for you. For God had promised that you and your household will be saved. So it is our responsibility as parents to tell our children the good news of salvation. Jesus Christ came to save the whole world from Satan. God sent Him to us so that at His second coming we will be with Him into everlasting life. This is the plan of God even before the creation. He knew that man would disobey Him because of Satan. And Jesus obeyed Him. Although Satan had bruised Jesus heel at the cross of Calvary but soon at His second coming He will bruise Satan head and that he and his followers will be thrown into hell.  So don't believe in Satan lies again. You have to be with your parents because this is the will of God for you and your seed. God had already set an enmity between Satan's seed and His seed. You are God's seed because of your parents so don't miss this privilege for you and your household. Good day and God Bless you.|`|AUsvrW8faa	Your parents don't want to your soul to go to hell. Many times, we can get very passionate about loved ones coming to christ.  If you can get past the religion and see the relationship they'd like you to have with christ it would be easier for you.  The going to church and all that is a desire you get AFTER you meet Christ, you just want to be in his presence - around others that love him the way you do that's why they go to church. <br>  <br>  God's sheep know his voice- make sure you're not just denying him because of your parents. When it's all over and you stand before God, you're going to have to tell him why you denied him.  Your parents bugging you and sending you scripture was supposed to help you - Don't let the enemy win. I hate to give you scripture after what you said above but I read this today in my devotion, it speaks to how you really really don't want to go to hell.  Just imagine wanting just a drop of water on your tongue....it's about a rich man who wanted to warn his brothers to repent so they didn't end up in hell.

Check it out.....<br>  <br>  God bless you<br>  <br>  The Rich Man and Lazarus   (Luke 16: 19-31)<br>   19"There was a rich man who was dressed in purple and fine linen and lived in luxury every day. 20At his gate was laid a beggar named Lazarus, covered with sores 21and longing to eat what fell from the rich man's table. Even the dogs came and licked his sores. <br>   22"The time came when the beggar died and the angels carried him to Abraham's side. The rich man also died and was buried. 23In hell,[c] where he was in torment, he looked up and saw Abraham far away, with Lazarus by his side. 24So he called to him, 'Father Abraham, have pity on me and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, because I am in agony in this fire.' <br>  <br>   25"But Abraham replied, 'Son, remember that in your lifetime you received your good things, while Lazarus received bad things, but now he is comforted here and you are in agony. 26And besides all this, between us and you a great chasm has been fixed, so that those who want to go from here to you cannot, nor can anyone cross over from there to us.' <br>  <br>   27"He answered, 'Then I beg you, father, send Lazarus to my father's house, 28for I have five brothers. Let him warn them, so that they will not also come to this place of torment.' <br>  <br>   29"Abraham replied, 'They have Moses and the Prophets; let them listen to them.' <br>  <br>   30" 'No, father Abraham,' he said, 'but if someone from the dead goes to them, they will repent.' <br>  <br>   31"He said to him, 'If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, they will not be convinced even if someone rises from the dead.'

If he's crazy-religious, you'll need to word it carefully. If he's accepting to other religions, just tell the truth.

ZmdIlkpQaa	From my standpoint:<br>  <br>  What we give out, what we do, shapes the world around us, and thus is what we get back.  I call it the Law of Returns.  If you harm others, you're creating the moral, spiritual and mundane environment in which you increase your chances of being harmed, too.  Additionally, as a mature, ethical person, one has to weigh one's responsibilities, the reasons for willing harm upon another, and the certainty that "those who live by the sword die by the sword" (or get shot by those who don't...lol).  I have had to make such a decision, and have ended up using lethal force against a person who meant me and my loved ones grave harm.  <br>  <br>  However, I only concern myself with things that create real harm to others.  Upsetting someone does not fall into the category, really.  More to the point, if the decision is a personal one, like having an abortion, I suppose an ethical person will have to weigh their own gain against the potential harm caused to other people.  <br>  <br>  Good and thoughtful question.|`|9qUnD0sBaa	The rules are clear not to harm.  If your action causes harm even emotional,it invokes a payment and the universe gets to chose, and it always isn't pleasant. These are questions only you know the answer to. No one has a right to judge you . If the reason is serious , if for example precautions were taken and they failed, the only resort is an abortion, then do it.  The only problem is the feelings afterward. Once the bell is rang you cant go back.These are weighty thoughts. There are no black and white answers.|`|wwdllMzYaa	this rule is for spells and rituals, not life in general<br>  but, a lot of wiccans do use it in their daily life, as their choice<br>  <br>  you dotn have to accept it<br>  i do spells and i dont acept the 3 fold rule<br>  i just dont intend to harm anyone, so i state that<br>  <br>  if you intend toharm soemone, thats your choice,but, i do know this about life, there are consequences to all that we do, and dont do<br>  cause and effect is the reality of the 3 fold law in my opinion<br>  so youwil always get consequences if you abuse the energy, same as you would if you abuse anything or anyon|`|UxooffHZaa	We must all choose our chains. But, tenets are like socks, they need changed every now and again, else they start to smell. This tenet smells as much as the 10 commandments when followed as a commandment. If you wish to use it as a springboard sister, do so, if you find a more springy board, or that this is actually a roof holding you back, toss it out with the trash and every other crapulous creed. (Even those created by our own brothers, like Gerald Gardner, Prince of Jerusalem)|`|hzMpdFFBaa	Wicca is a RELIGION, and religions generally tend to have moral codes. Many religions, philosophically speaking, hold the idea that harming others has retroactive effects because all things are connected in the circle of life. One's actions have a domino effect and those dominoes are lined up in circles and spirals that fall in on themselves. Therefore, mindfulness in one's actions is promoted. But beyond this idea of "behaving" oneself to avoid consequences, spiritually advanced practitioners of any system (including cut and dried post-modern magic/sorcery) cannot help but act from a higher (albeit often unconventional) moral ground because they must be at one with the source of their being --their True Self/True Will --to be who they are. This tends to be an embracing and expansive but unsentimental thing, not a tiny, misery, self-serving thing. <br>  <br>  Every event, and especially successful magical operations, have effects and consequences. If it is your "Will" to harm another, first, I say that you do not know what Will is.  Second, regardless, you must be prepared to accept the outcome, including effects, both conspicuous and subtle, that may arise that may directly effect you.<br>  <br>  Your example of having an abortion to benefit yourself is a poor one. People make life and "moral" decisions for a number of reasons--some very complex. People also act irresponsibly for a wide range of reasons, some malicious and some pitiable. In both cases, they  do so because they do not have True Will.|`|MnB35QFbaa	I think that the that this "rule" is like many others an  optimal idea of beahvior that can never be reached by any human, however it does serve the purpose of attemting to encourge ethical behavior, which in theory is good. There are, however, times that "harm to others" can not be avoided. There is,still though, something to be said about trying to behave in a manner that reduces the total sum of suffering in this world. As for doing things that benfit ones self, well i guess each of has to look at the many facets of situaltions and the possible actions/results that could be taken or could occur and decide what is ok to do, based on ones inner code and the know info. <br>  <br>  This is much like the do unto others as you would have them do to you . The pratice of this in mass would, certainly, create a better world for all, but most do not follow it ...... So the question, becomes,. Is doing something because its right, worth doing for the sake of it being right in its self,  or is it the improvement of ones personal situation all that counts and matters. <br>  <br>  Personally i think that It is not ok to preform actions that cause avoidable pain and or suffering others. So if i look at what i wish to do I must attempt to see my self in the shoes of any that may be affect by my actions and see if said action would cause me pain if i was in the receiving end, if so the action should not be performed. However there are those situations where pain can teach and encourge growth, and to deprive or prevent the oppertunitys given in these cases is wrong.<br>  <br>  Well now that ive rambled ill end with this<br>  <br>  The rule is a nice thought i think, but the concept of right and wrong is to complex to be addressed or understand with any one rule or guideline. Right and wrong is subject to change.|`|21808938a2c954ea0389683f10267c69aa	How is it restraining your will?  The Rede is permissive, not limiting.  It says what you can do freely (harmless things).  It doesn't say anything about what you can't do.<br>  <br>  Things that cause harm can be done, just not "freely."  You need to consider the consequences for all, whether the benefit outweighs the harm, and whether you're willing to take responsibility for that harm.<br>  <br>  Life is full of harm.

So, when there is someone that doesn't fall into the group that they are in, they find that unusual and usually their first idea about that person is going to be a negative one. I think it has to do with people being somewhat arrogant but not really intending to be. Because, people usually think that if someone doesn't fit in with their group that there most be something wrong with that person which, is usually not true. But, I have found this is be a somewhat reasonable answer for discrimination towards people. I don't think people  necessarily chose to think negatively, but their mind compels them to. I could be wrong though. Hope that answers your question.|`|ILcZlPfcaa	because they are stupid...ignore them
KBBonf97aa	It's normal and common for teenage girls to experience same-sex attractions that have nothing to do with what will ultimately become your sexual orientation.  It has to do with elevated hormone levels, which have caused girls to question their sexuality since the beginning of time.<br>  <br>  Television and movies have made it fashionable for girls to label themselves bisexual and "dabble" in same-sex relationships, but most girls who do this are straight.  Some are doing it because it's considered cool and others don't realize that same-sex attractions are normal during adolescence, but usually temporary.  That's why there are so many teenagers who identify as bisexual, but very few who don't identify as straight or gay by the time they're in their 20s or older.  If you attend your 10-year class reunion, you'll find that virtually all of the girls who considered themselves bisexual as teens grew up to be happily heterosexual.  And the hipness of bisexuality actually makes life harder for kids who are struggling to accept their genuine homosexuality.  For them, sexual orientation isn't something they can wear for a while and discard when it's no longer in fashion.  Very often they're used by peers who want to satisfy their curiosity or test their own boundaries without the risk of being gay.<br>  <br>  A lot of people will tell you to experiment with both guys and girls and then decide your orientation, but that will probably confuse you more.  Any person can enjoy physical stimulation from another person, male or female, and it has nothing to do with sexual orientation.  A gay man doesn't turn bisexual or straight if he has sex with a woman any more than a lesbian becomes bisexual or straight from sleeping with a man.  The acts are just acts and anyone can do them and enjoy them.  But sexual orientation is as innate to someone as eye color or musical talent.  Nobody gets to "decide" what it is, no matter how fashionable a particular orientation may be.  And sexual orientation often doesn't make itself clear until late adolescence or early adulthood.  That's why most teens who think they're bisexual realize later that they were wrong.<br>  <br>  Don't stick yourself with a label, since the odds are huge it won't apply to you in a few years.  I have a friend who announced she was bisexual at 15 because she was attracted to other girls.  By the time she entered college, she knew she was straight.  More than a decade later, there are still people who won't let her forget that she came to a very wrong conclusion when she was a confused kid fighting an epic battle with teenage hormones.  And she's the first to admit she never would have declared herself bisexual if it hadn't been considered cool to do so.<br>  <br>  Most girls had their first crushes on other girls when they were in elementary school, but that doesn't mean they're bisexual.  As much as I'm sure you don't want to hear it, you won't know your sexual orientation until you're older.  The labels kids give themselves at your age mean nothing.  Sexual orientation is something that sorts itself out over time.  Just be patient and let nature do the work for you.  In a few years, you'll know exactly who you were meant to be.|`|aCRDZrE1aa	ha wow.<br>  mmm i know it's cliche, but don't label yourself.<br>  <br>  it may just be that things are happening to you, that make one sex repulsive to you at times. such as: a fight wih your friend, a bad break up, jealousy, bad relationship with your parents.<br>  <br>  i suppose the true test is, could you last in a relationship with someone of either sex, with out finding them repulsive a little while later?|`|9gkp06QGaa	I can relate to you so much, like i go through the same thing all the time!!

I thought it might be hormones or something, -shrugs- but I wouldn't worry if I were you!|`|36f164873fb212f4be988fa1d87ec37caa	Sounds like you could either be bicurious or maybe your bisexual but go through cycles of who your attacted to?
UrYYKkGoaa	Absolutely. It's called a grant because it's granted. It's not a wage or a salary. High schools require community service as a condition of graduation, but it's still community service, even though compensation is involved. Many volunteer gigs offer various considerations, both cash and goods, but they are still volunteer gigs. Also, community service in lieu of incarceration isn't voluntary, but it's still community service.|`|tdQTZPI7aa	No you cannot.  Your received compensation that makes it a job and not voluntary.
AC3MA4IDaa	I ask myself that everyday. I hope so. I ask non-Christian friends at school often for their opinion.|`|9ae55890a5fcfea5236690724138dc1faa	If Christianity was a crime I hope I'd be on the most wanted list. I'd tell everyone that would listen that that is who I was and if I was arrested then I would plead guilty.<br>  <br>  Christianity used to be a crime back before the romans accepted it, the early christians refused to give up their faith and often faced death because of it. I hope I'd be strong enough to do the same.<br>  <br>  I dont know if I'm shining brightly as I dont preach (much) but if someone asks me about the issue I will tell them who I am and if someone tries to argue with me about it and tell me I'm wrong then I'll be more than happy to tell them why I believe what I do and to argue with them for as long as they like.<br>  <br>  Edit: 'Well travelled Prog' (and anyone who shares his attitude) do you honestly think that Christians aren't educated? Why is it that atheists like to kid themselves into thinking that they are more intelligent?<br>  I'm a straight A student in Philosophy and also in the Sciences so I know what I'm talking about. <br>  As for the logic alot of atheists dont even bother to look into the other side of the argument. I suggest that you look into the first cause theory by Saint Thomas Aquinas or William Paley's argument for intelligent design or if you are feeling a bit more cynical you could use Pascals Wager.<br>  How about looking into history, I think you'll find that history supports the Bible on virtually every issue, Jesus crucifixion was even recorded by roman scribes.<br>  If you want to look into science you would discover that minor evolution the idea that species change and adapt over time does not contradict the bible and the idea of major evolution (that we came from apes etc) has no evidence in the fossil record. You would also discover that the Big Bang theory (yes, it is just a theory) is simply the idea that the whole universe came out of one thing and was created incredibly quickly which is exactly what the Bible said (Pope Pious the 6th loved the idea of the Big Bang he thought it was God saying let there be light). I'm not saying I agree with the Big Bang, I'm not sure about it but couldn't it just be God.<br>  Maybe you could look into miracles, how else would you explain Lourdes or the Children of Fatima, or anything in the Bible for that matter. On a smaller scale I've honestly had prayers answered I've never asked for big things but when things turn out well for me I do thank God.<br>  How about you look into human nature, I think the very fact that people have a conscience and a sense of right and wrong is evidence of God.<br>  All of that is my logic ,yes I also do have that gut feeling that God exists and that he hears my prayer. I do get a sense of God when I am doing something spiritual, like when I go to church or when I visited the Vatican. Atheists love to criticise and dismiss that but think about it this way; If God is your creator surely you would be able to feel that he is there.<br>  That is the fundamentals of why I believe, think about it for a minute if as you claim you are logical then you would consider every option.|`|7300b67211d400f8dc6e96e473093503aa	If Christianity became a crime it wouldn't take much to arrest a person. Just look at the Jews in Germany in WW11. Just going to Church would be enough and that doesn't prove you are really a Christian. Or if your parents are Christian and you are not, Too bad, they would find you a Christian and off to jail you go. Our very presence in the world is shining brightly because of the Holy Spirit, not because we are so goody goody.|`|AA11346514	Perhaps.  I simply am trying to live as Christ would have me live.  I fail many times but He helps me over the bumps.  I suggest that my light shines, dims and wavers as I move through my life to the sure salvation that God and Jesus the Christ have promised.  Have you read "Pilgrim's Progress?" Does it make you nervous?|`|8Zey1ntAaa	I would fight for your right to believe what you do, but you are sick and in need of help.  You are in the clutches of a mind control cult.|`|G4JHpKogaa	It is a choice in life. Why would you think that Christianity a crime? It is not. Christians are chosen to go to heven for everlasting life.|`|b32jC7pGaa	Christianity shouldn't be a crime. It's just a waste of time as there is no credible evidence of a 'god' or a 'divine jesus'. None. It's a huge fraud.|`|kB7Wuyknaa	I would be put away.  I am not embarrassed by my faith, but I don't go around preaching it either.  I don't however shy away from talking about it.|`|VBYEE67Caa	I'll probably be put on probation for a year or two.|`|e6t9FPUdaa	I think I would be locked up.|`|47a9f147d11fee144c4019cdc8cbba87aa	I think a few people would be falsely imprisoned while some of the guilty went free.|`|SjGpbohiaa	They'd throw me in jail.|`|lRaxAWfRaa	Yes|`|oUIGsNyBaa	the problem with christians is that no one is killing us anymore for being so.|`|bFLVPIkaaa	i don't know about that but Christianity is a sin.|`|Gzhdixecaa	ok why would christianity be a crime i don't get it|`|UDAeKt7Eaa	There would not be any evidence as I am not a Christian.<br>  <br>  I get thumbs down for my beliefs?

In fact I'm never a perfect Christian.|`|89MKzLl3aa	There are many Christian charities around the world, and there have been great leaders of the Christian faith. Sure, there have been bad apples, but Christianity shouldn't be judged by the mistakes of the past. I "shine" as brightly as I humanly can.|`|AA11297267	Um, it *is*  a crime.<br>  Against reason, evidence, and logic.<br>  <br>  I find you guilty, and sentence you to 5 years of hard education.<br>  <br>  Peace.|`|yHfsHp6naa	Yes, there's plenty of evidence to convict christians of delusion and ignorance.|`|p6wwiQG3aa	Nice Question.<br>  <br>  <br>  I would like to think so.|`|AA11755204	You can't judge a person's morality by what religion they follow.<br>  <br>  If you judge someone to be a Christian by their "fruits", then I would be charged as one, and I'm an atheist.  Really, morality is determined more by society than by any religion.  Religion, in fact, tends to lag behind the morality of society by a few decades to a few centuries, depending on the issue.|`|m29eEm57aa	if?

2PZnXjZ7aa	Artemis is not specifically the moon goddess. She was the Hellenic goddess of forests and hills, child birth/virginity/fertility, etc. It seems only right for Artemis to be the moon and the twin, Apollo, to be the sun.<br>  Selene was purely a lunar deity. Yes, the two are still identified with one another.<br>  You see, the Etruscans were the first to rule Rome. As Rome progresses, they adopted Etruscan gods. As many Roman deities have Greek equivalents, it's thought that the Etruscans had Greek customs.  Diana is an example of this. Her equivalent is Artemis. Artume... Artemis...  see the spelling similarity? There's several others.<br>  Technically... Artemis, Artume, and Diana are the same goddess. You see what I'm talking 'bout? As for Selene... there's an Etruscan one for her named Losna. Selene and Artemis are sorta mixed into Diana, for she's also called Luna.<br>  There's some other Greek godd(esse)s that were associated with the moon as well, such as Hecate with the dark side of the moon.<br>  I hope I've explained it well enough. (:|`|dfjIBHe3aa	The answer is very complicated and I want to point you to one of the many wrong answers:<br>  <br>  Robert Graves, who considered the White Goddess the Creatrix of all we see, was trained in the Classics at Oxford and had a good knowledge of the Classical Sources.  He was also probably crazy.  He wrote several books of essays, including Occupation Writer and The White Goddess, and as well some historical novels, such as Hercules My Shipmate, Watch the North Wind Rise (which is Fantasy/SF/Visionary) and King Jesus.  While he gets many facts wrong he gets some right.  He also did a book called the Greek Myths.<br>  <br>  Jane  Harrison's Prologomena to the Study of the Greek Religion will give you the real deal.  It has been out of print longer than most of us have been alive (usually) but it keeps surfacing in this or that library so I know it is accessible.  Read it is all I can say.<br>  <br>  Greek Religion came from a meeting of the Indo-European Achaeans and the Minoan peoples who were already living there.  Often the gods and goddesses had complex origins.|`|4TX26viFaa	You're talking about different cultures with their own goddesses. When one conquers over another (as in Rome over Greece) the victor starts to overlay their gods and goddesses on the newly conquored people. That's how things shift.  Each of those was distinct to the one culture that originated it, but as time went on, the goddesses took on attributes from the invaders goddess.  So yes, they have blurred and shifted and all seem the same, but really they were independently different at one point in time.

Last time I heard, it was out of every four kilts made, three go to America.<br>  <br>  Scotsmen are more likely just to wear for special occasions. Americans are more likely to wear them for less special occasions, church services, weekend jaunts, mowing the yard (in a sport kilt), and just about anything.<br>  <br>  A Scotsman these days are more likely going to dress like their other European friends, and wear pants (trews) than a kilt.|`|TkPJYlaMaa	We'll aren't we not using stereotypes.

I believe that God will save me because He said He would...<br>  <br>  I don't need to DO anything else.

I then looked and searched out many religions. Every religion except Christianity had man earning their own salvation. This does not make any since. Just think about it. If you murder someone and have to go to a court of law and get judged would this work? Would you tell the judge you are a good person and do many good things and he should just let your sin go unpunished. He should just over look you sin? How would your view on being good or anything you did satisfy Justice? The simple fact is you broke the law and have to be punished. This is where Christianity makes since to me. Jesus comes into the court room and says I paid the price with my life on the cross. Jesus please justice now you can be found not guilty. Jesus said I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man comes unto the Father, but by me. This last sentence is in the Bible but my argument before this was not.|`|bfWcfCKXaa	Because Jesus is believed to be "God" in Christianity! Christians believe that Christ was God's ultimate revelation of himself personally in human form. You cannot expect a Christian to deny this central aspect of his faith just to make you feel good or others feel good. No one insists Muslims stop saying Muhammad was the last and final seal of the prophets and Islam is the only truth which is exactly what they say! I believe all religions are to a greater or lesser extent "mythic" and irrational. But this constant carping about why Christians believe Jesus is the only "way" shows a remarkable ignorance of the core tenants of the Christian faith. And, those who "carp" about it, do not hold other religions, such as Islam which make exclusive claims to truth, to the same standard!|`|fa69e0b2d073786cb9c8d9e0436625a2aa	All the religions of the world say, in effect, "If you are a good person and do this many good deeds you can earn your way into Heaven." Christianity states outright that we can never get there on our own steam because "our righteous acts are as filthy as rags."

It is the most fulfilling and beautiful relationship i have ever known. Heaven and eternal life are just a portion of what God has to offer you through Jesus Christ.

He will come in and go out, and find pasture"  And i am certainly not going to tell you that he said "I tell you the truth, the man who does not enter the sheep pen by the gate, but climbs in by some other way, is a thief and a robber." I would like to be able to use those direct quotes from the mouth of Almighty God incarnate, but i guess my testimony will have to do. :)|`|Q2qKxHONaa	All religions teach that there is something wrong between us and the higher power or powers they believe in. In every other religion, Humankind is responsible to achieve "higher consciousness," make sacrifices, do good deeds, or whatever else is necessary to restore this broken relationship. Christianity is the only belief system in the world that teaches that God is the one who bridged the gap. God is perfect and we are not so we are separated from our creator. Christ, the perfect man because he was in very nature God, took our punishment so that we could be reunited with God if we trust Him alone for our salvation. There is nothing we could ever do to earn God's favor. This is the essence of Christianity. Ether Christ is the only way, or he is not a way at all.|`|68lLAQnKaa	Christianity is the only so called 'religion' that claims to be the only way, that is a bold statement and for christians to have the balls to believe this should be a testament of how credible their faith is.

However, some of those emanations are much closer to that supreme force than we are.  They as Gods to us, as we must seem like Gods to our pets.  So by venerating these lesser emanations, you could claim it polytheistic.  But by acknowledging a supreme creative force behind EVERYTHING, you can also call it Monotheistic.

gmrYDpPVaa	Religion is believed to be vital in our society, however, it is not.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Religion creates conformity.  It creates groupings and, dare I say, cliques.  We are divided by religious beliefs, denominations, etc.  It defines our activities, our choices, our time managment, our monetary resources, even who we spend our lives with.  Rather than experiencing all lifestyles, many of us will have been born, lived, and died without ever realizing what all is out there beyond the confines of organized religion.<br>  <br>  Furthermore, religion creates controversy.  Differing belief systems between countries and people has been a determining factor in many world wars and conflicts.  Even on a smaller scale, it has grave effects:  Religious disagreement can come between friends, get in the middle of relationships, and cause drama in the best of families.  It controls people in the worst of ways.<br>  <br>  In addition, religion can often reduce progress in the world and our nations.  Abortion rights, gay rights, stem cell research, evolutionary biology, etc., have all been hindered in the past by the religious.<br>  <br>  I will admit that religion has brought great amounts of art and literature to our cultures.  Certain religious organizations have been very influential to certain causes.  However, as time goes on, positive contributions are decreasing.  At this point, I believe that the negative influences of religion far outweigh the consequences.<br>  <br>  Personally, I do not believe that religion is a bad thing.  In fact, I'm quite fond of it.  However, a vile taste is left in my mouth whenever I consider how PEOPLE react when religion becomes a factor.  Therefore, the problem itself is not religion -- it is how people interact with and use religion.  Just the same, I do not believe that religion is a necessary implement of today's societies.|`|ewWUFWyWaa	OK, give them this example of what Christianity is allowed in the Bible today, but the secular law won't let them do!<br>  <br>  When the American Founding Fathers drafted the US Constitution it was to represent AMERICAN WHITE LAND OWNERS ONLY!!! Not anybody else!!! We are reinterpreting the US Constitution today to include everybody!!! Just like Christianity reinterpret the barbaric Bible to make it more palatable today! <br>  <br>  Christians still have the option in the New Testament era which is today to buy a suitable slave and do with him/her anything that their naughty whims desire with all of God's blessings like they did in Colonial America up to the 1860s!!! Their only obstacle now is the secular government laws NOT THE BIBLE! If you had a slave you can use him/her even for the kinkiest gay, bizarre or straight sex imaginable! In spite of any Bible interpretation, there are plenty of arguments to justify ANY KIND OF KINKY SEX OR FETISH especially with slaves! Holy Moses is the Saint Protector of all the child abusers and perverts in the World! Believe it or not, pedophilia in all its extreme forms is CONDONED and totally unregulated in the Bible, Old and New Testaments nothing has changed because GOD NEVER CHANGES!!! If a man likes to have a little girl for a while for whatever pleasure HE DOESN’T NEED TO DATE HER! He can buy her as a slave from a set of some God fearing parents IN NEED OF MONEY! In fact, you don’t need to buy her you can trick her! God the Holy Ghost sent the Archangel Saint Gabriel to sweet talk the very young and naive Virgin Mary into a pregnancy without any problem. She was very horny and didn’t hesitate one moment to go along to be laid with a perfect stranger. She didn’t tell her fiancé Saint Joseph until 6 months later and only because he noticed that she was getting big around her slender belly… Secular laws, NOT BIBLE LAWS protect the innocent today!<br>  <br>  Titus 2:9 (NIV) (Saint Paul commands!) Teach slaves* (*including young little boy and girl slaves) to be subject to their masters in everything* (*EVERYTHING without restrictions no matter how kinky!), to try to please them, not to talk back to them,* (*Hallelujah! Praise the LORD! Sweet Jesus! Amen? --I’m being sarcastic here just to make a point!)<br>  <br>  Exodus 21:20-21 NIV “If a man beats his male or female slave with a rod* (*i.e. for lack of submission!) and the slave dies as a DIRECT RESULT* (*Especially if the master is into some hard core BDSM abuse!), he must be punished* (*but how? will the master get a slap on the wrist? NOWHERE in the whole crappy BIBLE says how this master ought to be punished, although it says PLENTY on how to handle the slaves!), but he is not to be punished if the slave gets up after a day or two, since the slave is “HIS PROPERTY”* (*In the Infallible KJV it says, “his money”… God says that a slave is not a human being, but money! That is why Christian America up to the 1860’s justified Bible slavery including all forms of imaginable pedophilia with the black and white slaves! We had white Irish slaves, too that no Christian talks about today!) <br>  <br>  So you can keep beating your male or female slave to a pulp every third day or so and as long as he/she recovers you are a HOLY and RIGHTEOUS person before this Loving Bible God! His law is SOOOO GOOD! The whole Bible is decisively pro-slavery of the kinkiest sort! In the New Testament, escaping slaves were ALWAYS TOLD TO RETURN to their masters and to go free only if allowed! The whole book of PHILEMON in the New Testament is dedicated to teach Christian escaped slaves anywhere in the world to return to their masters! Today Preachers are shrewd enough to ignore any unfavorable rap in the New Testament! <br>  <br>  1 Peter 2:18 (NIV) (Saint Peter, the First Pope holding the keys of Heaven commands!) Slaves* (*including young little slave girls!), submit yourselves to your masters with all respect, NOT ONLY to those who are good and considerate, BUT ALSO TO THOSE WHO ARE HARSH.* (*Hey…! hey…! hey…! how kinky can the Christians get even today? As kinky as the clergy and the militant Christians allow and the secular arm of the law won’t catch them! Smart preachers do it in their closets! Christians have no moral standards to draw from the Bible! They borrow from our real secular world that the wanking preachers brainwash Christians to hate! Spiritually speaking, of course!)<br>  <br>  Exodus 21:7-8 (NIV) "If a MAN SELLS* (*for whatever reason like for being short of money) his DAUGHTER* (*NOT HIS SON, but his daughter! Can you sense the sexual innuendos of the Bible writers?) as a SLAVE, SHE IS NOT TO GO FREE as male slaves do. IF SHE DOES NOT PLEASE THE MASTER who has selected her for himself* (*by then she must be all worn out sexually and even spiritually speaking, of course!), he must let her be redeemed. He has no right to sell her to foreigners, because he has broken faith with her* (*Praise the LORD Sweet Jesus!).<br>  <br>  Can you imagine the SLAVE GIRL’S fate if her God fearing daddy doesn't want her back and her master is a sadistic sexual pervert? Another more subtle way of getting a GIRL for a wife in the Bible is to be a predator at a PURITY BALL watching the virgin girls dancing and grab for yourself anyone that you wish to have for a wife… The Law of God allows MEN this original pleasure! No silly dating necessary! That's about how the Blessed Virgin Mary got pregnant, too! She was talked into it and she agreed on the spot! She was not kidnapped!<br>  <br>  Judges 21:23 * So that is what the Benjamites did. While the girls were dancing, each man caught one and carried her off to be his wife… (Praise the LORD! Sweet Jesus!) <br>  <br>  In the Bible days women had no noticeable rights and were worth much less than men! As long as the master follows the Bible injunctions he is always a Holy man of God, like RIGHTEOUS LOT who shortly after his wife’s death was getting drunk and was having sex with his young virgin daughters until he got them pregnant, or even the Levite Priest of God in Judges 19-21 who pleasured himself carving up his gang raped concubine in 12 pieces. He sent the chunks of her body by messengers all over Israel to get the Benjamin clan exterminated in a Holy Vendetta! (Amen? Praise the LORD!) Can you imagine the heads of the other 11 tribes in Israel getting a bloody body part of a Priest’s horny lover in the mail with a message saying that it was the Benjamites who raped and killed her? Can you still believe that this low ranking PRIEST OF GOD got ALL the tribes in Israel to agree with him on the spot to slaughter everybody in the Benjamin tribe without any question asked!? Anything like this doesn’t happen even among the most barbarian people anywhere in the world, but you can enjoy reading all about it in “God’s Holy Word the Bible!” The Bible writers were very smart to insist that they “wrote as they were led by the Spirit of God”! They didn’t know what they were writing including the Adam and Eve, Moses and all the stories until they read it and were amazed (2 Pet 1:21)! Any bit of gullibility will help you to swallow!   <br>  <br>  Luke 16:17 (NIV) (Jesus said) It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the least stroke of a pen to drop out of the Law* (*the Old Testament Bible).<br>  <br>  According to God the Son Jesus Christ the Law of God in the OT is valid even today! When some Colonies in America were ruled by the Christians a lot of innocent “witches” were hung from tree branches with a rope tied around their neck! The first criminals to be sentenced to death here in Christian America were witches (Praise the LORD!) Hundreds more were in jail on suspicion of being witches and warlocks! I am not taking ANYTHING out of any Bible or historical CONTEXT! Today Christians need to comply with our secular morality, not the way around! In due course, the validity and morality of same sex marriages everywhere will be determined by the secular law, too! The Christian clergy will still have an opportunity to make money regulating the morality of same sex couples. There is plenty of flip-flopping room in the Bible to accommodate any lifestyle and Christianity is here to stay for a long while because some humans still need a “spiritual” crutch to function in this world. Up to the 1860s Holy Bible slavery was perfectly legal here in America, but COMMON SENSE PREVAILED OVER CHURCH DOGMAS! Everything changes with time thanks to liberal non religious governments! <br>  <br>  There is hardly a page in the Bible that is not full of some compromising issues that theologians need to reinterpret so Christianity today can still promote a reasonable “God”! If you are an honest human being in spite of your Christian background how can you possibly justify the Bible immorality not mentioning that someday slavery will be outlawed by the United Nations of the World that God loves so much!? There is not a whisper of hope in the Bible that slaves will be freed at all, but all the opposite! It says that slavery will continue on to the end of the world and that nobody will be able to buy or sell unless it is branded with a “666” stamp! They never imagined in their primitive mind any form of democracy with liberty and freedom for all! Please, check your IQ and level of brainwashing and don’t hesitate to share these notes with the spiritual leader of your choice! Make them EARN your “tithe” money! Christianity is the biggest scam in history!|`|n0uMBKtJaa	What my fellow atheists tend NOT to realize when they say it is used to control people is that government does the same thing, albeit without the multitude of fallacies.<br>  <br>  Religion was once vital in society because of its control. Believing your eternal life hinges on being a good person has often been necessary in socities where he law was always able to enforce everything. Religion dictates the rules when law cannot.<br>  <br>  I would not say it is necessary to keep society going today, we have a society that is well connected, not impoverished (for the most part, assuming of course the economic collapse doesn't hurt people too bad), and secular ideals drive us as well as any religious one can. Also with advanced science we don't need religion to explain things for us as much. Just look, in France 64% of people don't even believe in a god (aka they are agnostic or atheist), France was once a strict Catholic country and they have obviously not collapsed into madness.|`|02965963da3f0165b81bd488737cfad3aa	Religion is not, in itself, vital FOR our society today, but the freedom to express Religion is of great importance.<br>  <br>  However, if religion is to be disregarded or placed into a subordinate role, then it must be accepted that the right to decide what is moral, and thus correct behaviour, is devolved to our politicians, who themselves are as incorruptable as the Medici Popes.|`|C1SOqQSkaa	No - it damages society.<br>  <br>  Read the linked paper, entitled 'Cross-National Correlations of Quantifiable Societal Health with Popular Religiosity and Secularism in the Prosperous Democracies', from the Journal of Religion & Society.<br>  <br>  It shows that societal health DECREASES according to the level of religiosity.|`|5ofS2qQYaa	most atheists will say no...yet they've only gotten so far b/c of others' beliefs in religion<br>  watch all progress stop, should we all become atheist<br>  <br>  Religion in general is not vital<br>  <br>  Truth is vital, Knowledge is vital, Faith is vital...<br>  All in Islam, a way of life more than a religion<br>  it's an individual pursuit of the above (truth, knowledge, faith)<br>  <br>  :)<br>  <br>  Peace|`|AA11935914	It's only vital for helping to keep the masters in power who preach it.  So if (mental) enslavement is the goal, than vitality abounds!|`|iI2oc4Ujaa	I would say no, the reason being that religion was basically a way of explaining things that were unexplainable in ancient society. If you look at religious mythologies from around the world, you'll see that very evident in some of the legends. In Norse myth, for example, it is said that earthquakes are caused by the god Loki thrashing about as poison drips on his face. When the Norse were around, they had no knowledge of tectonic plates, lave flow, or any of that, so they found a satisfactory answer in the supernatural.<br>  <br>  In today's society, we've explained many, many things right down to the complex world of quantum mechanics, which people are in turn explaining more and more every day. We no longer need religion to explain these things for us.<br>  <br>  That's probably the most common argument against religion's vitality in society. Good luck!|`|UJtUpWO0aa	It has been instrumental and vital in MY society as of today.  If utilized and understood YES, religion or the understanding and knowledge that God has to offer in his Holy Words, have much to bring to heel a nation.<br>       I find it odd that many want to blame Christians for the condition of the United States today, and yet more than half are non-christian, and American has ventured so far from being influenced by Christian aspects that I don't see how anyone else can view this.   Also, if you take into consideration that this great country enjoyed greater peace and success in its earlier years when religion and Christianity had more role and stronger roots in it.|`|Gn6jwmzCaa	Religion does have it's place...but not so much religion as a whole with the rituals and all that. It is vital to some humans who NEED the FEAR of god and the FEAR of an eternity of pain and suffering in their lives to keep them from acting on their animalistic tendencies.<br>  <br>  A good example are alcoholics...I know many people who struggled with addiction for many years, hit rock bottom and then "found" Jesus. Religion is the one thing that seems to keep them from hitting the bottle again because it not only keeps them in a constant state of the fear of eternal punishment but it also serves as a 24 hour distraction from the bottle calling out "drink me drink me". By sticking their noses in the bible and by praying numerous times a day and through hanging out with other christians they stay busy enough to keep them from drinking again.<br>  <br>  Of course the fear bit does not work on people who truly do not believe in eternal punishment which is why so many Christian/Catholic Priests and Pastors USE belief in god as a smokescreen to hide the fact that they enjoyed sex with children. Same with politicians and most christians in general...religion is merely a tool to be used to assert, without any physical proof, that a person is a fine upstanding good person who would never steal, lie, cheat, visit prostitutes or look at porn, or commit murder. <br>  <br>  Of course the reality is that most people do engage in some of that sort of "sinful" activity. That Ted Haggard is the perfect example of a religion user...he used religion to hide his homosexuality from his family and friends, and if questions arose it was other christians who first came to his defense saying of Haggard "I cannot believe a man who devotes his entire life to God would do something like that, the accuser must be lying in an attempt to bring a good man down."<br>  <br>  Same with the child rapers in their midst, christian parents at first demonized the children and gave the Priests immediate benefit of doubt because they could not believe a "man of god" would rape children...only to come to find out that their blind trust was misplaced and they subjected their children to years of abuse when they could have stopped it earlier.<br>  <br>  Christians also like to believe that god leads them in everything in their daily lives so when they put their trust in other people who turn out to be filled with evil it is hard for the christian when they first hear of possible sin filled activity to admit that "god" allowed them to place their trust in a demon...most times they go right into denial and defense of the accused until the proof is overwhelming or a confession comes forth.|`|wukXoRCMaa	vital if you want to destroy the world<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  religion has always been used as a means of conquest.  look at past societies.  back then, man couldn't destroy the world.  now man has the ability to do so.  and who are in charge of these weapons?  people of faith.  that's scary.<br>  <br>  if the world is to survive, religion must die aka take a back seat to logic and reason.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  wazgud makes a very good point.  if it wasn't for religion, we wouldn't be as advanced as we are today.  but!!!! that must change for today's world.  god is not real...we must stop taking lessons from a book that is 2000 years old.  if you had to take an oath on a book...why would you do so on the king james bible?  i can find more morality in an edition of reader's digest.|`|4Uyv7T5Vaa	i will recomend to understan Religion as described by Quran before going to school debate.<br>  <br>  What Quran Says About “Religion”<br>  (Deen)<br>  <br>  The Religion before Allah is Islam (submission to His Will): Nor did the People of the Book dissent therefrom except through envy of each other, after knowledge had come to them.

Allah chooses to Himself those whom He pleases, and guides to Himself those who turn (to Him).

There is however large social strife and unemployment in rural areas.<br>  <br>  There is a severe lack of human rights such as Freedom of speech, freedom of movement, the treatment of ethnic minorities, freedom of religion,  media freedom, one child policy, capital punishment.

English was further transformed by the spread of a standardised London-based dialect in government and administration and by the standardising effect of printing. By the time of William Shakespeare (mid-late 16th century), the language had become clearly recognizable as Modern English.|`|tQsxsuNPaa	Nobody "starts" a language.

These tribes, the Angles, the Saxons and the Jutes, crossed the North Sea from what today is Denmark and northern Germany. At that time the inhabitants of Britain spoke a Celtic language. But most of the Celtic speakers were pushed west and north by the invaders - mainly into what is now Wales, Scotland and Ireland. The Angles came from Englaland and their language was called Englisc - from which the words England and English are derived.|`|cHYz36ocaa	The English we know today developed out of the Germanic dialects brought over by the Anglo-Saxon tribes in the fifth century onwards. No one invented it. Languages, such as English, change naturally over time, borrowing words from other languages it comes into contact with (in the case of English: French, Scandinavian, Latin and Greek), and sometimes losing 'native' words or undergoing sound-changes and/or changes in meaning. There has been much speculation about the origin of language in general, but so far no definite answer has been found (only that language as spoken is very old; perhaps over 50000 years).

I saw my first UFOs through my bedroom window when I was 8 years old, they were in formation and there were between 5-7 of them, and that night changed my world forever..<br>  When I woke up in the morning I shot straight upright in bed and felt different somehow, and I went and informed my mother that I was no longer going to Sunday School as I no longer believed in any of it..We were not a religious family and my father had died, so that was that, I had no argument from my mother..<br>  Over the next X amount of years I searched for something that I believed in, and at age 13, I discovered Wicca and that felt right to me..

By age 20 I was a 3rd degree Wiccan Priest..<br>  Back to the UFOs, I spent many years as a Diamond Driller in the outback of Australia and I saw may unexplained things, both in the air and on the ground..In 1984 I saw a UFO on the ground, and the only reason I could see it as I was 40 feet in the air, up the mast of my Drill Rig doing a minor repair on night-shift.. I have a witness to this one as my off-sider saw it too..It would take me ages to explain all of that, so I will skip a few hours..When we knocked off at 5:00 AM, I grabbed a torch and a 6 pack of beer and went to have a look for it, and my off-sider said I was mad and no way was he coming with me..The next thing I remember is waltzing back into camp at about 11:00 AM, and I still had 5 beers left, no real memory as to where I had been for the last 6 hours, but I wanted to take the Toyota and go back and have another look, but the Boss said no, so I went to bed, that was in Sth Aust...<br>  About 3 months later I was Drilling in Western Aust, and I woke up about 4 -5 miles from camp on the track that lead to the homestead..

No I don't sleep walk, no drugs or beer were involved..

African Americans use the past as leverage for an easy way out but so does every other race. Caucasians use the leverage of not getting into a college when they have a better gpa than a minority because there is a quota for the school to have a certain amount. Same with males college admissions require a certain amount of females as well. There are many different prejudices in society. Some things you just have to accept and deal with it's very hard to change the opinions of society. I do feel like the blame on their color has gotten less of an excuse. The thing we need to worry about now is the prejudice against gays soon we will look back and see how ignorant we were just like we did with the African American suppression.|`|HLqzrBNmaa	Well a lot of immigrant communities were dirt poor but now are quite wealthy.

4sh2oRR7aa	I live in a majority black area so I say racism towards mixed black and non-black people along with black crime. Most of the black youth here are in gangs. Even as young as elementary school, teachers get assaulted by children. In middle school, it's not uncommon for them to bring knives and have policemen patrol the schools and that's sad. Many of the mixed/non-black children are assaulted simply not for being black. So those are the biggest problems in my opinion.|`|VhBW7AjAaa	Crime and gangs.<br>  <br>  Our city is getting desperate for money, so as a solution, they decide to build cheap low-income housing tracts (as well as section 8 apartments in certain areas). But the plan backfired and all the cheap housing largely attracts gang members and low-class people from Los Angeles (which is about an hour away from our city). Crime has skyrocketed since the housing boom, but the city council still seems to be oblivious to the problem. It rakes in the money, but it's destroying the city from the inside out. This place is nothing like it was 5-6 years ago. People are getting robbed and assaulted in broad daylight, and the police do nothing to stop it.

JCGtfNeTaa	Because when you study a certain topic, you must study ALL the scriptures that talk about that topic, and then you will know what the Bible teaches on that topic.<br>  <br>  For example, you cannot learn everything the Bible teaches about what happens when you die, or what the Bible teaches about the second coming of Christ, by merely reading only one book of the Bible.|`|Lc5FtItDaa	I have seen both.

I don't try to understand all the old Jewish laws for one thing.|`|6173ede5e3ea0a8b44522ccd89de7fe0aa	Usually when people start at the beginning of the Bible, intending to read it from cover-to-cover, they usually start getting bogged down in the "begats", and then they lose interest. There are certain parts that are more important for the new Christian's understanding, like the Gospels and the prophetic books like Daniel and Revelation, which deal with our time today. It is also important to understand Genesis, since it is the basis for the entire rest of the Bible. This is why you see reading plans that are created to help you understand what you are reading better, and to keep you from getting bored.|`|AA10988107	I do no tknow, that is not what I did as I want to go from book to book<br>  and know all about the book and how it is connected to the next bookand how much time is passing, Matt.1:1-17, in N.

bda465ikaa	As a monarchy you have to define the role of the royal family. Usually they are defined as representing the "head of state", so they personify the country, give the nations awards, represent the country overseas, bring attention to charities, and promote the arts.<br>  (1) What if the sovereign is a pacifist, perhaps who lost a child in a war. How would that the sovereign deal with an unpopular war? Could he/she make statements in favor of the peace movement?<br>  (2) What if the sovereign had strong personal beliefs about a technology? You can make the technology genetically modified foods, cloning, etc. What should the sovereign do about his opinion?<br>  (3) What about an embarrassing member of the royal family. Queen Elizabeth's uncle, for instance, got involved in a lot of things, He was serious drug addict, and very promiscuous. He had numerous affairs with both men and woman, and the occasional menage trois. How would your sovereign deal with these things.<br>  (4) What is the religious role of your sovereign? Most monarchies were developed long before the idea of the separation of church and state existed. Most sovereigns have a spiritual role as well as a temporal one.<br>  ==============<br>  What are your rules of succession? You can probably pick from one of following rules: (1) male preference primogeniture like the United Kingdom, (2) male only succession, like Japan, (3) absolute primogeniture like Sweden where first born is the monarch regardless of sex, (4) a system where the best candidate is chosen from a group of family members (like ancient Scotland), (5) are family members who leave the country excluded from the succession (like Denmark).<br>  What about adopted children? What about children born out of wedlock, openly acknowledged , and whose parents later married? In the UK they cannot become the sovereign. In Monaco they are permitted to become the sovereign even if the parents are only married for a year, and later divorce.<br>  ==============<br>  Congress or parliament makes the laws. However, since you have a monarchy you probably also have a peerage, a group of hereditary dukes, earls, etc. What is their role in congress? Do you have a House of Lords? How much power do they have? Do they have to be elected? Do they have term limits? Can the congress be abolished by a no confidence vote?<br>  ==============<br>  Whoever enforces the laws, do they have power over international affairs? In America there are laws regarding the FBI and the CIA. The CIA is forbidden to spy domestically. However, what about domestic terrorism? What about collaborations between domestic groups and foreign terrorist cells? What about illegal aliens? Perhaps in your country the division of power gives an opening for a terrorist group to slip in and pull off an act of terrorism.<br>  - In America, after 9/11 there was widespread concern about the security of the borders. New border controls went up. Interestingly enough, the terrorist attack had nothing to do with weak border security. The terrorists all entered the country legally.<br>  =================<br>  The group that interprets the laws is a judicial system. The standard attack against a judicial system is that they sometime go way beyond interpreting a law, and almost seem to Create laws. Who controls who is on the judiciary. In America, the president nominates a supreme court justice, and he/she is approved by congress. The term is for life. Who nominates the judge in your country? Who approves the judge? Is the term for life or for 20 years? If it's for 20 years, can the judge be re-appointed? Can the judge be impeached and removed from the bench?<br>  ====================<br>  Does your country have an ethnic enclave that has more autonomy than the rest of the country? Like Sardinia, Basque region, Scotland, etc. Who enforces the laws in the enclave? Is the autonomous regions allowed to have their own language? What are your language rules in general? (In Canada everything must legally be printed in English and French). Is your autonomous region permitted to keep their own taxes for their own use (like Puerto Rico). Puerto Rico is interesting because they are citizens of the USA, but they are denied the power to vote in the presidential election. They also have no senator and only one representative in the House.<br>  ============<br>  I think these are some of the questions you have to make about your government. You might want to attach some kind of history about how these rules have changed over the years, and if there was any conflict.|`|AA12152549	If you make it an absolute monarchy then you'll be the one making all the laws since you're the head honcho, and you are the sole interpreter of the laws you make.

Do you really believe this?  Are you married?  Does your spouse feel the same way?  Do you have children?  Do you want your children to have faith in you as a parent?  Do honor and respect the president of the USA?  Do you have faith in the president of the USA.  Or is it faith in things, outside of religion, is ok but faith in religious things are silly?|`|KmnbjZIdaa	Faith may start from simple family tradition or influence from your social circle.  But ultimately for faith to take root and grow into love of God, you will have to experience God in a personal encounter.  And start to make God an important ally in your struggles to live a moral life in this world.  In this way, God become a real and valuable part of your life and you know that God is real not just by faith.|`|VvyJ1yRUaa	this is really long<br>  <br>  i didnt read it all but I know God is real<br>  <br>  who needs evidence HONESTLY??<br>  <br>  mans word (scientists) or God's????|`|BPO6roTOaa	Say what you will about the sweet miracle of unquestioning faith, I consider a capacity for it terrifying and absolutely vile!|`|KmULmT7Baa	Christian faith is stable, no one thinks of anything ground breaking.|`|angPpFY7aa	"Faith is believing in what you know ain't so." - Mark Twain.|`|Gzhdixecaa	faith is trust  and comes from the heart.
KelWvOWGaa	To learn from Malayalam from any website or from any book is very difficult. Because the pronunciation of Malayalam is totally different from what we write in English or any other language. Only way to learn Malayalam is by listening and observing. Anyway you told that you are half white and half Indian. why can't you learn from your home. I think this is the best way to learn the Malayalam|`|pbTtq0l5aa	I don't know whether there any books that teach you malayalam ! I looked at our library and they don't have it !!! But I am a 100 % malayalee ! Was born there in kerala and speak malayalam at home. If there is anything you want help with ! I guess i can try my best ! But it is one of the hardest langauges I am not gonna lie ! Sometimes I think that, if I weren't born as a malayalee, I would NEVER pick up the language.... ! But don't wanna discourage you ! Do your best ! U can do it ! I tutor malayalam to American born Indians here ! They get frustrated at first but then they learn !!  Soo good luck !<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.languageshome.com/English-Malayalam.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.languageshome.com/English-Mal...</a><br>   Some basic stuff !|`|21898b74c3cdf0c81a7fdfcafa48e63eaa	Balaji publications, Pycrofts Road, Royapettah, Chennai has published languages learning books for several Indian languages. Learn Malayalam through English is one such book. It was costing INR 25 till recently (about 50 US cents). You can access www.anyindian.com and go to appropriate menu to get further details for buying the book.<br>  The book would give you basic vocabulary for day to day normal life situations. To get correct pronunciation of any Indian language, one has to move in the society with keen observation of the phonemes. Malayalam has adopted the Devanagari table of alphabet which is common to all other Indian languages except Tamil (which is closest to Malayalam). It hasalso adopted the short 'o' and 'e' sounds (as in English words 'pen' and 'position') as in the other three South Indian languages. It has the "Lh" alphabet as in Tamil and Kannada and also has the "Lzhh" alphabet as in Tamil (transliterated nowadays as 'zh') as well as "Rhh" as in Tamil, which contextually is also pronounced as "Trr". Thus Malayalam has the largest number of alphabets amongst Indian languages short of 300.<br>  The above is not to deter you in your quest. It is only to enable you not to waste time and energy in learning the alphabets but straightaway embark upon the task of learning the spoken language first. For this, you may get some CDs /DVDs of Malayalam films with English sub-title and try to learn some words. The you can watch Asianet and Kairali TV channels, especially news in English and then news in Malayalam. Thereafter you can watch talk shows and soap operas. Over about six months your vocabulary will be around 300 words and with the aid of the book suggested, you can perfect usage of these. Then start conversing with Malayalam knowing people and rectify the shortcomings pointed out by them. Over a period of time you can perfect your spoken language and then you may try to learn the written language.<br>  Audio CDs of Malayalam songs will also aid you.|`|rf1bltHiaa	try www.livemocha.com its free idk if they have that language or not though

lZuM2pxgaa	I appreciate the answer by Michael A and wish all gay-rights supporters were like him. He pretty much has it right.<br>  <br>  Sounds like a normal best friend; probably nothing to worry about. When he winks, tell him afterward to stop. If he bumps you, tell him to watch out.<br>  <br>  You might try asking about a certain girl or future plans (wife/children?) and see his reaction.<br>  <br>  Realize that even if he likes a girl, dating is somewhat discouraged until he's a junior. He may want to avoid girl temptations until after his mission too. So, not dating would not be a sign of being gay. There's nothing wrong with talking to him about it.|`|AyEkA6Flaa	Oh, c'mon.  There's nothing to be shocked about.  Religous upbringing has nothing to do with one's sexual orientation, which is set in the womb.<br>  <br>  Well, it might be terribly *uncomfortable* to be a gay Mormon -- or even a gay Catholic, though less so than a gay Mormon.  But you are who you are, regardless of faith.<br>  <br>  Dustin Lance Black, who just won the Oscar for Best Screenwriter for "Milk", grew up as a gay Mormon.  I knew a gay Mormon guy in high school.  There are guys who have been missionaries, but nevertheless are gay.<br>  <br>  If he is gay, he would likely have to be closeted in order to survive and be accepted in the Mormon context.<br>  <br>  So what about you?  Are you straight yourself?  If so, realize that your dear friend (if gay) no more chose to be gay than he chose to be left-handed or right-handed.  He is the same awesome person, regardless of who he crushes on.<br>  <br>  If he finds you attractive but you don't feel the same way, at some point you might have to have a gentle conversation about it, and simply explain that it's fine with you if he is gay, and you love him as a best friend and a brother, but you just don't feel romantic toward him.  But perhaps you will notice other guys who might be gay and whom he might pursue.<br>  <br>  Treat him in the same way as always to show that you still love and accept him.  If you hugged before, don't stop now.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  I am not a Mormon, but their teachings on this matter are well known.  Basically, it's okay to be, but not to do.  Gay orientation is okay, but acting on it is not.<br>  <br>  So LDS would not accept a same-sex sexual relationship.<br>  <br>  Their whole religion is based on the idea of eternal marriage between a man and a woman to attain exaltation.  A person not so married may become an angel, but not an exalted being or God.|`|3bc6709f9978822792e144f5259dd14baa	LDS members are expected to live by a moral code that includes no sexual relationships before marriage and no physical homosexual relationships.  <br>  <br>  There are gay members of the church, however, they are expected to not give in to their passions just like any other member of the church.  <br>  <br>  He may be struggling with this or he might be having an identity crisis of some sort.  Does he talk about girls much or flirt with girls?  Perhaps he's entertaining bisexuality.  Not really sure, but that's the LDS position on the issue.|`|Gq8am0r5aa	I couldn't possibly tell you whether or not your friend is gay based on what you've told me.  I can tell you that if he is, he's gonna need you more than ever.  Growing up gay in a household that condemns it is going to be hell on earth for him and he's going to need you to be there for him.|`|v4isCHzvaa	Some friend you are.|`|OLnmXeWDaa	Most Mormon families are pretty tough on gay children. Some come around, but is against everything they are taught. <br>  <br>  There are some gay Mormon support groups. Try affirmation.org, but stay away from LDS based ones like Evergreen. That's a mormon group that tries to convince gays that they can turn themselves into straights. There's a website called gaymormons.com that is good.<br>  <br>  I don't know how this works for guys, but when I was a girl learning about my sexuality I considered practicing with other girls just for the experience. I am straight. Just saying, be careful how you bring this up. But if continues to flirt, you do need to get it out in the open or it'll drive you guys apart.|`|ho2hEqo8aa	Might be gay but maybe he just got to close to the meow mix and is feeling a little frisky? Why dont u just ask him?
WBXGLS30aa	It depends on your jurisdiction. A lot of them see a birth certificate of a historical statement of what the situation was then, in which case you couldn't change it.<br>  <br>  You can certainly apply to have different people registered as your legal guardians (assuming you are under-age), but thats not quite the same thing.|`|ZmdIlkpQaa	To be honest, you can't.  A Birth certificate doesn't change when you change your name, either.  It's a legal, permanent record, and the only way it can be changed is to correct information on it which was in error at the time it was filled out.  If you were to have gender reassignment surgery, for example, your birth record still would not change.|`|a8ea9deb7ab29f8f7b54263085c0e342aa	I think this would be better in the law section.|`|f0egZ7Sdaa	How is this a GLBT issue?<br>  <br>  <br>  And to answer your question... yes and no. Your "birth mother" cannot be changed as she gave birth to you. This fact is indisputable.<br>  <br>  Your father on the other hand can be changed if, and only if, a DNA test was performed and the true identity of your father then became know.|`|EBt6Wbqpaa	your birth certificate is a legal document that  documents who your parents  and your name at the time of birth, it cannot be altered in the frivilous way that you propose.|`|DWwv3v9Raa	If you are legally adopted, then your BC would be changed to reflect your new parents.|`|L5qWHzePaa	The answer is different for each state. Also, it depends on your age. If you're under 18, you most likely will not be able to do it, period.<br>  What is the purpose of changing the biological birth parents names? Amending a birth record may not be easy because you must prove that the change you want to make is accurate and justified. Before you decide to request an amendment, think of the birth record as historical information about the birth.<br>  It doesn't make it law that the people who are listed are "parents", it just means they biologically created you.<br>  I have looked at numerous states sites and there is a process for changing fathers, but it does not seem there is a process for changing a mothers name. And the only allowable name changing is by legitimizing that the person is in fact, a biological parent.|`|d6f3f16a24596ee000a34bde13aec73caa	A birth certificate is a record of who your biological parents are, so the only way information could be changed is if it is incorrect.  So the answer is no.|`|Tja9u0uPaa	Wrong category.<br>  <br>  And you can't do that.<br>  Not even if you go to court.<br>  They have your DNA.<br>  <br>  Seriously, put your question in the right category next time.|`|ho2hEqo8aa	I think you would have to at least get something notarized and at most appoint these people as your legal guardians thru a judge.|`|MO5q6bi8aa	you cannot change the birth certificate eve people who are adopted have a birth certificater of there biological parent as long as they register the child|`|395PjPKAaa	those are your parents and even if you dont like them they r your birth parents and nothing will change that its like their little certificate.|`|Cfja6h4Kaa	No. There's no way to change the people on a birth certificate unless you could prove with DNA that they are your biological parents.|`|TyZYlRDRaa	no.  it has to be your birth parents even if they are past away or if you were abopted at birth.  sorry
8Nqq7tkwaa	tribes/nations will not accept dna tests for enrollment purposes. and there are NO reparations given to native people. thats a deliberate lie spread to make people think we are getting handouts so they will hate us.|`|5b37795563969b19352fc16bf286b0a0aa	Blood test.<br>  They can determine your race by your blood.  I remember they caught a serial rapist/murderer in New Orleans by testing his blood, they found out istead of looking for a white man, they were looking for a black man that was 1/4 Native American. <br>  <br>  The test used to be really expensive, since it started in the 90s.  I think it's around $300 now. But if you are 1/16 or more, then you should get reparations which would replace the $300 you spent. <br>  <br>  My mom is Amerindian (from Argentina, tho) and she did it to find out how much she is. But the test she got was really confusing because hers was a saliva/epidermis test.|`|7d2e1c957453fc8d4829969618e83382aa	The other person who said to get a blood test is sort-of right. The only thing about blood tests is that they only tell you what the "probable" race is, and it's not solid proof about bloodlines. Blood tests used to determine Native blood are usually used to show people that it's likely that they're mixed-blood, and that's it. The step AFTER the blood test is always to do some genealogy research, because the blood test itself proves nothing.<br>  <br>  Pretty much no matter how you cut the cards, it always comes down to genealogy research. I can give you more details, but it depends on the tribe. If you add some details and let us know what tribe your ancestry's from, I'll post some helpful links and info!  :)

g0gMQUCVaa	Not that I know of.<br>  <br>  Hahaha!  The thought makes me laugh though.  I can't imagine someone thinking I'm arrogant.<br>  <br>  Edit:  Then they're not terribly bright.  Arrogance is when you think you are better than others and talk down to people.  I have never seen you do that.  You're a sweetie.  You believe in your principals.  Don't get me wrong.  But you don't try to choke us with them either, should we on occasion disagree.|`|LcURWscBaa	Your "question" (which is really a complaint) is in itself a demonstration of arrogance. There's a fine line between confidence and arrogance, and it's variable depending on who you're talking to, not only in how they perceive you, but in how you present yourself to them.  Since you think some "misinterpret" you, then that shows that you feel defensive about it, and that is anything but confidence.  You are trying to shift the blame for poor judgement onto others-- "I'm not arrogant, just confident, and they don't understand me!"  Confident people accept responsibility for how they present themselves to others.  Arrogant ones complain that they have been wronged.|`|QgzTdZ2uaa	Yes, I think so, not only am I confident, but Im tall and statuesque in physical build so I think that intimidates some people, I have also been told I have a mean look on my face more than once, Im not aware of this but Im not one to go around smiling at everybody, but once people get to know me they realize Im a nice person.|`|IS7Xubkfaa	Maybe.  I did get into an argument with an Intern (doctor) about the pain I was experiencing in my foot when I tore the ligaments falling off a ladder.  I told him it was emanating in a certain area.

One of my supervisors once said I was too cavalier!|`|5FVyVS9vaa	I'm sure some people thought that of me.|`|2JvM6hucaa	I try to present myself in such a way that I do not appear arrogant.  It's all in the presentation and delivery of your message so that you do not come across as an arrogant person.  Arrogance diminishes wisdom regardless of who is delivering the message and what is being said.<br>  <br>  Edit:  good point Blu!|`|bf4cc388616ba9cb48357f54373c609eaa	Perhaps I have. While I am sorry that it happened, if that is indeed true, I do not, and I do not expect other people to, alter personalities to insure that every one perceives me in a totally acceptable manner. If you are constantly on guard to insure that you offend no one you live your life according to the dictates of others instead of  who you are. I yam what I yam. Living in the boonies is about as accommodating as I can  get.|`|aWcD7Ou5aa	Yes, I have.  But I did the required task with ease, so it failed to make me feel any less confident.  I think when someone mistakes your confidence for arrogance, it is their mistake.|`|a4LWildhaa	Not that I know of. If someone thought that, it's their problem, not mine.|`|Dmaahsc3aa	Confidence and arrogance. . there is a big difference between the two. I think you can always tell the confident person is the one who shows respect or treats  the ‘little people’, the ones less confident with themselves, with kindness and consideration !!!    They never look down on them or like they are trying hard to impress someone else . . . and never try to come out looking like the better person. They share their knowledge, not try to ram it down someone else's throat !!  lol  They never pick on someone or try to point out their lesser knowledge. They are open for change, and willing to admit if someone else has a better idea. . this is confidence. . . . not arrogance. . . you blu, are the confident one, I think I am too, and hope no one ever sees me as the opposite !!!|`|AAgX0SDcaa	Yes, it happened a bit around some inexperienced workers. My thoughts were that they were insecure to begin with, a person who is open-minded and willing to learn will enjoy learning from other people. Tried to stay light-hearted and cheerful so I could relate to them in other ways.|`|80lWqRFiaa	Yes I have, my take charge attitude and calm response in an emergency can sometimes lead people to believe I am trying to take over. I thought they were good traits to have, and they usually are.At least the boss tells me they are.|`|EVnlDpPUaa	It seems i must do pal,going by the amount of my questions and answers, that are reported.

Intelligence as arrogance as well.<br>  <br>  Nothing wrong with arrogance.|`|59Wg2cI3aa	Bullheadedness maybe, but never arrogance|`|ZCh0OHuhaa	I hope not. I don't want to come off as arrogant.|`|24vQ8D71aa	out grew all that , now i'm just arrogant ! LOL.

VWvI5RyBaa	Sindala, Somehow God has touched you with His Love, you are so close to the truth, keep reaching, you are truly touching it at this time.  Don't let go, it's the most beautiful gift you will receive in your lifetime.  I will never try to change anybody but if you feel the need to talk to somebody, I allow e-mails.  You will always be welcome.  Love|`|93r3nCM1aa	Nah. I was a christian for 15 years and then I flim-flammed between hinduism, buddhism, bahai, and new age before declaring that I was going to convert to judaism. After 4 years of doing that I realized none of it was real.<br>  <br>  If atheists are missing the point, I'm sure I would have picked up on "the point" sometime in the last 19 years being religious.|`|0hdo4WORaa	No, a lack of fantasy|`|OiAl6w48aa	Maybe that IS our problem - we just can't make that gigantic leap of imagination from "this is what the evidence tells us" to "this is all god's work".  Personally, I'd rather know what's behind the curtain than just take orders from a booming voice.|`|aEdkaXmtaa	The presence of truth|`|BYTrrqN6aa	Perhaps you have a lack of imagination as an individual, but that's not what atheism is about.<br>  <br>  I too am an atheist, but see myself as having quite an overactive imagination.|`|0YL8qVMsaa	There is a difference between being able to imagine something and believing what you are imagining is real.|`|Gf5nMPJXaa	I suppose it's possible but not plausible.  I find it very easy to imagine all sorts of gods.  But that does not make them real.|`|Fpi8im9taa	No, it's a lack of conforming to a being that threatens you with hell, asks ridiculous things, and finally, promises that he loves you even though your family will burn in hell even if you go to heaven.<br>  <br>  No, it's not a lack of imagination. In fact, because atheists don't adhere to an organized religion, that's just evidence for an atheist's capability to think.|`|WwCBomTMaa	Actually, I think Atheists are very creative. I doubt if you lack in the imagination department. Science itself is very creative, and most Atheists follow it. I think it is more of a different perspective, than a lack of imagination.|`|rh8szekzaa	I don't think you're missing the point. You're just a bit more rational than a believer. It's not a lack of imagination. After all why would you want to whole-heartedly believe in something that is a product of imagination?|`|kyTDQEWaaa	Faith is believing in something you know can't possibly be true.  Now does that sound like a GOOD thing?|`|XuO2rTteaa	No, well not me anyway. While I may no be the most imaginative person, it has more to do with my lack of wanting to believe my imagination. Many religions are imaginative, and the religious are willing to believe.|`|b3fcaed1380d38d593a8cb71556b4d96aa	No.  It takes no imagination to follow a religion that someone else has already made up.  Do most believers seem particuilarly imaginative to you?  Not only can they not think outside the box, they don't know there is a box.|`|G9dZN8omaa	Nah. You can use your imagination in many ways without involving God.<br>  <br>  And Religious fanaticism is simply a lack of common sense and morality.|`|CcdF4wshaa	It's not a lack of imagination. We also have imagination, but the difference is that we know how to separate reality and imagination.|`|DqtSdgtPaa	No. I'm atheist and I have a very active imagination. I just happen to have a very logical, reasoning side as well.|`|1WisnX8naa	Imagining that unicorns exist is one thing, accepting it as fact is quite another. You're OK.|`|faT4MyVkaa	No, it's irony at its best. They don't believe in something that requires a belief in an unprovable negative.|`|KmULmT7Baa	More like lack of Schizophrenia|`|a6f5efb2cbade02a525b433574402dc8aa	There is a difference between being creatively imaginative and believing the imaginary is real.|`|HEDSOHq1aa	no, it's a lack of nonsense|`|angPpFY7aa	No. It is the ability to figure out what is imaginary and what isn't.|`|tbjStusDaa	I don't think it's a lack of imagination. Atleast your thoughts about it are rational.|`|A9oWuOFBaa	No, it's a lack of delusion.  You're safe.|`|XvSJD0EFaa	Yea funny thing about reasoning, sometimes you can be staring right at a thing, but your mind just won't let you see it, the old brain just seems to be missing the point. Nicodemus had that problem in John 3, take a read.|`|3ufhBDIVaa	I am an athiest as well.  I don't think its a lack of imagination.  I think its more like finally coming to realize that everything you've been taught about god and Christianity or other religions doesn't come from one source.  It therefore can't be right.|`|t8JlnuqFaa	God Doesn't Believe In Atheists|`|3mDvjCa8aa	Absolutely not. We are the only ones free to imagine without assuming. The religious' imagination must stay confined to their belief system. Religion may be more grandiose, but it isn't original or imaginative.|`|XoUfUl6Yaa	I'd think anyone who uses the scientific method to understanding the universe has a bigger imagination than someone who believes what they are told to believe.|`|sfTPrMFpaa	No. I fantasize regularly about elves, ESP and dragons, but I do not fantasize about a god.|`|3mIHxillaa	lol Well I think atheism is just the presence of rationality...|`|jdRKZe18aa	No just a lack of faith.....|`|E71jweytaa	i think alot of people feel that way. atheism isnt lack of anything<br>  <br>  just the belief that there is no God|`|HIskrREJaa	i don't think so... it actually opens up more options to imagine instead of just saying that god made it.|`|ZNRYqss9aa	Love the whole note thing btw. <br>  No atheists i believe see the facts for what they are, people that believe in God I feel personally are only doing what another has told them. Imagination isn't concerned with this so your safe for now.|`|AA11974194	Don't confuse lack of imagination with lack of delusion|`|c0KKHMsAaa	anyone can make up a god.<br>  <br>  only a fool could believe a figment of their own imagination.
8RmazUuBaa	Most of those hit home hard with me..Although I dont relate to any of the ones involing white women cause Im not attacted to them..I also rarely have ANY other black men working in the departments Im in outside of the janators..So I dont know if the thing about the older black men are true.<br>  <br>  But going "stealth" is the best option..Id also add you should never make promises to anyone, unless you are forced. Immediately take pre-emptive action when you hear the drumbeat of the haters (usually white women in my case). Get your side of the story to you superior asap.|`|HPqCRBq8aa	Its funny and sad, but true. I like 3 too. If you are angry for whatever reason, some white people take it as a threat. Short story. I had this white guy come to our office from Nashville. We are in Md. He must have forgot where he was (B-more). He called me out in front of everybody. (I don't know what his issue was). He had a important urgent call, and was talking to some other white dude. I'm trying to interrupt to tell him about the call. He turns around and says, "yes what do you want child". You already know what happen after that. <br>  <br>  Btw-I didn't get ignorant. But he did apologize/eat his words and many black women were proud. I let any and all know who the hell he is/was talking too.|`|pfke6Jieaa	all i can say is preach it brotha. im proud to be black......lol. yeaahyaaa, i aint gonna bring no more light skinned girls to the crib. i kaint take no *** wooping from ma momma.<br>  <br>  EDIT: i agree with number 3, i had to smile the whole damn time last time when i was at this white girl's house cuz her family invited me to lunch and my mouth was hurting like a u know what. i cant smile 24/7 if they think im a bad person cuz i dont smile every second then thats too bad.|`|xUxUwloPaa	Lol, this sh*t made me laugh. It's true though.|`|qzLBY53saa	Sometimes, they think black men are a threat so to make them think differently we gotta go out of our way.|`|npTZTzWRaa	LOL....SO TRUE, I TOTALLY AGREE THAT SOME REAL SH*T<br>  <br>  especially the part about white people and keeping your thoughts to yourself ....so so true|`|92iuiuZKaa	LMAO! Good one. Some of it's true!|`|FKxrJxbPaa	LMFAOOOO<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  soo true
DArAz67Caa	my grandmother is no longer living-----nor am I an unbeliever----besides----I can manage the VCR just fine by myself----|`|TLLklriUaa	LOL- Stop using grandma's dementia as a form of entertainment.<br>  And ask her if she sent you that cake she made for you.|`|sEPjAHX4aa	mmmmmmmmm....cake.....|`|517360c1a1db979fb2f19bbb959f22eaaa	That is truly a question for philosophers and theologians.<br>  <br>  But honestly, read the "Summa Philofrates e Condilitus Magnus", Chapter 4, Section 3, sub-section 1. It's all spelled out for you.|`|1TYZDRUqaa	IJR simply tells them to wait until exactly midnight on New Year's Eve and plug it then.  Then evrything is set to the right time!!|`|ZNRYqss9aa	Lol how does that have to do with atheists ^_^<br>  <br>  I won't even this as I'm terrible with explaining to people|`|LnoyylQ7aa	actually mine know how to and aren't senile|`|AA12272543	She knows how to play a VCR and a DVD.  I would hate to say that my mother would never be able to program a VCR.  <br>  <br>  She knows how to bake a cake.  But, I would suspect that if she prays hard enough, God would change her cake into a magical self recording VCR.|`|a6eb6e311bd16dad988d64e4f060d69faa	wow, just wow|`|hXQnR2Scaa	Because it is a VCR CAKE. How else?|`|pzLDXL6gaa	Tough one. I'd probably modify the instructions to fit the cake instead of the VCR.<br>  <br>  Harriet|`|9kLiiDzVaa	what???<br>  i don't understand this|`|Dimi8By2aa	Thanks for the 2 points.|`|dFrMhJxUaa	Then ask if there will be cake if you come over, and hope she forgets the VCR.|`|XuO2rTteaa	My explanation is that she is in a retirement home for a reason. Once you become a danger to yourself and/or others, you can no longer be a member of society.<br>  <br>  By the way, THE CAKE IS A LIE!!!11!one!!<br>  It was really a cat she mistook for a baby, why was she trying to cook a baby? o you really have to ask?|`|G9dZN8omaa	I don't.  If she had one, I would go do it for her, and eat cake after.<br>  <br>  If she doesn't, then there is no point in explaining it, and I'd go over and eat cake anyway.  My Gramma makes great cake! :)|`|7sqpiGgoaa	this is different :)... i'd say grab the silver remote out of the kitchen draw, the ROUND silver remote, go to the white cupboard in the kitchen, grab the vcr and use the silver remote to poke the vcr and then lick the remote|`|DqtSdgtPaa	I don't have to. My grandmothers are the ones who tell me how to program everything. They're brilliant when it comes to technology.|`|AAAw24KOaa	Just turn on the TV, ideally news, and leave the phone lying next to the speaker.|`|Wn64Oxxyaa	Just like superbeings, they came in and out of existence without me ever understanding them.|`|DZ5jSsMvaa	You're strange....|`|70OClBEQaa	WTF?! she dont have a VCR cuz she is dead.....so i wont hate to tell her anything!|`|EXurNsB4aa	lol'd|`|CMjSkDOMaa	She does not have a cake because the cake is a lie!|`|KmULmT7Baa	Tell her to try prayer :P|`|aogwoFKJaa	Perhaps she borrowed one?|`|9onFys4baa	The same way I explain things to your grandmother. With my fist and my manhood.|`|b431fc634e0dad4a5767526148ce11f0aa	I just tell her to bring me the cake and we'll call it quits|`|gKwKxJyNaa	not an atheist but i hope i can help....get a a DVD, way easier to function.<br>  <br>  <br>  =p you get a star...feel special because i don't give those out often ;]|`|UR4mWefGaa	The sea isn't green. I love the Queen. What exactly is a dream. What exactly is a joke?|`|jN5SXl5Caa	By accepting her view of the world and that she might feel the cake is a VCR. Just because we think it is the WORD cake doesn't mean it is a cake. If i'm not there I don't know for sure she does not have a VCR. She could have just bought one, or found one, or even made one. I would just explain to her that there should be some kind of button that says menu. Press that. Now some options will come up. Find the one that closest matches the operation you want to perform. And so on and so forth. I understand what you are trying to say. How will either side (atheists and religious people) convince the other of the point. when the emotional or spiritual "VCR" is not there and trying to do it over yahoo answers is almost a fruitless quest. Clever I like to have to think.|`|790nzPyPaa	Oh crap, you made me belive.|`|8qctM0B4aa	pretty simply, the only thing you can really set is the time and all you have to do is press and hold menu and then hit forward to select the hour, tap menu once more and then press forward to select the minutes|`|6wheuZA3aa	Tell her to fax you the cake|`|QkfGYIcxaa	What's that doesn't make scene sounds like your grandmother is crazy|`|MnmNl6Hiaa	the answer to life and the universe is 42|`|gkThLcf2aa	Hahaha|`|m0KBttFtaa	put your grandmother in a burlap sack. ship her to mexico. Take Delicious Cake.|`|rGip5hMEaa	bake for 25 min. at 425|`|x3ZpztsVaa	OMG dude...<br>  <br>  I mean...sheesh...|`|zb4tj2ZZaa	lol that was unexpected.|`|3mo8vrpTaa	Tell he you have another call coming in, gotta go!|`|MTi7r9l6aa	I'd just tell her to eat the cake - she needs the blood sugar.
AA10092510	Black.|`|OZjlW5utaa	You are the human race, your ethnicity is mostly black, and your only 1/8 white, so your black.|`|qvycijbOaa	You're black, stop trying to sound mixed because society tellls you it is better than being full BLACK.|`|Dv5HiSSraa	Whatever your native language is, IMHO.|`|7d2e1c957453fc8d4829969618e83382aa	The term "biracial" means you're mixed with two races, you can't be "1/4 biracial," because that you mean that you're one-quarter of two races. If you have the blood of two races in you, you're biracial. There's no parts or fractions about it!  :)<br>  <br>  Now, because your grandmother was biracial, that means pretty much everyone after her was biracial because they have the blood of two races in them from her. Because you didn't say what her percentage was, I'm gonna assume she was half white and half something else, because you never said what the other race was, either! So I'm just gonna say non-black since you didn't specify.<br>  <br>  That being said, if she was 1/2 non-black, then your mom (or dad, whichever side of the family she's from) is 1/4 non-black, which means you're 1/8 non-black.<br>  <br>  So technically at 1/8th non-black, you're considered 7/8ths black and 1/8th whatever the non-black race is, which means your official race would be "mixed," or "biracial."<br>  <br>  Hope that helped!|`|8NZC6LsRaa	Traditionally to be considered black, you have at least one drop of black blood in you...<br>  but I hate talking about race like its so divisional...(although, I guess to most, it is..)<br>  be what you want man!|`|C9QQPROkaa	You are not black if you are not 100% black do not let people judge and tell you what you are or should be crying out loud be what you are and if that's multiracial then d@mn it itsmultiraciall!|`|7U0hQ1VPaa	A quarter horse, of course.|`|IavysDu6aa	You are black.|`|cFSpYoDfaa	Black.|`|Ad5DlqfPaa	Whatever you want to be :-)|`|CWvBu00vaa	American<br>  <br>  Human|`|2e0ctu64aa	black and human.|`|FKxrJxbPaa	Ummm that would make you 1/8 white and 7/8 Black....so you're black.<br>  <br>  In fact, that makes you BLACKER than the average African American since the aveage Black American is about 20-25% European in ancestry (assuming that nobody else in your fam is mixed....really though, genetic history is so complex that you never can tell)

rV6RLBexaa	Psh, just because I don't learn every language in the world I'm disrespecting the cultures that speak them? Chinese is hard to learn, and I speak Chinese myself. English IS much easier. <br>  <br>  She. <br>  <br>  Just. <br>  <br>  Doesn't.<br>   <br>  Want. <br>  <br>  To. <br>  <br>  Learn. <br>  <br>  It.<br>  <br>  Got it? Good that you learned English, but that was your choice. Your girlfriend is not required to learn a second language just because you did.<br>  <br>  She gets to dump you.|`|4yoND1npaa	Here's my take on this matter.<br>  <br>  She knew what she was getting herself into by deciding to date a Chinese man. By this, I mean, she must have known beforehand that learning your language or at least being able to say basic phrases in Mandarin would come in handy, mainly for the day she meets your parents. In my experience and through secondhand experience, I know that Asian parents tend to not want their children dating interracially, therefore anyone who dates an Asian person whose parents think in this traditional manner, should try to learn about the culture. I absolutely do not think it's right that some Asian parents have ridiculous restrictions on who their kids should date, but trying to learn the language or culture might let them see that interracial dating isn't so bad.|`|5b37795563969b19352fc16bf286b0a0aa	How is she disrespecting your culture because she doesn't feel the need to learn Mandarin.<br>  <br>  Dump her if you want, but you're totally lame for doing so.  <br>  <br>  Maybe one day she will try to learn, but after being around you, she'd pick up a few words here and there.|`|8NZC6LsRaa	You are disrespecting her right to not want to know your language.<br>  I hope she has enough sense to dump you first for being a jack***!|`|2e0ctu64aa	No. She just doesn't want to learn Mandarin. I hated it when I had to learn it! But now it comes in handy!|`|AA10232076	Personally, if we could already communicate in English fine, I wouldn't want to learn Mandarin, because it's too hard and what will her knowing Mandarin really do, she probably won't ever fully understand the language if she's not driven to learn it. And it's not disrespecting your culture by not wanting to learn, that's her choice, now if you want to dump her over something like that, then that's on you, but it sounds kinda petty to me.|`|AA12018110	I thought you were an ex-Chinese Canadian. Therefore, she isn't disrespecting your culture because you pretty much denounced it.|`|EXurNsB4aa	lmao, yeah right you have a "girlfriend".  Darling, your hand can't speak Mandarin no matter what.|`|uGT5d8Pdaa	she should dump you instead.|`|cFSpYoDfaa	no, she should dump you
ZmdIlkpQaa	I disagree with you, I suppose.  I'd say it's a relatively polite way of stating a fact.  Some minorities in Canada (as in the US) are not easily visually distinguishable from the majority (whatever that is).  Others, because of the shape of their eyes or the color of their skin, for example, are more easily visually identified as different from the majority.  I don't see how saying someone is a member of a minoirty group is implying they are less than other folks, let alone how it implies that race is immutable.  Some people might be in the minority beczause of their religious beliefs (I'm a member of a minority religion, as a matter of fact), or some might be members of an "auditory minority" because of their accent or the slang they use or because of a speech impediment.  In short, the term minority is certainly not racist.|`|2liwk8yKaa	Have never heard this expression before. I guess that any highlighting of a particular race whether minority or not could be called racist, but then are we not all racists in the first place if we ask these questions.I personally believe that we are all of the same race "The Human Race"

HPqCRBq8aa	I agree. The police do have a gang like mentality. As a matter of fact, all people who carry guns have this mentality. I'm starting to think guns play a big part in this mentality. I say get rid of the guns and go back to public spankings/punishment. Gangs will go away, fast.

It's not easy being a cop, and without them we'd be a country full of riots and robberies.
DvZdB66maa	Yes, of course. We all know this is true; and unfortunately, they also discriminate based on many other factors as well. Anyone who refuses to admit this is in denial.|`|9g8spRvPaa	I agree with you and it happens all over the world.<br>  Years ago during the Rodney King trails in Simi Valley, Cal.,my biker younger brother who has long hair and tats, was driving on the freeway into Simi when he was stopped and almost wasn't allowed into the city because of his looks. He showed his ID with his address etc. but it took some time for them to let him move on.

c6d95122b528aaf12d8a33c6ae3bb0e3aa	Yes and you're living in it. It's called the universe. It constantly recycles it's own energy, building galaxies, stars and solar systems and destroying older ones through white dwarfs, black holes and quasars. When the universe destroys pre-existing matter, such as stars & solar systems, it eventually spews the matter back out to reform as gases, liquids and solids which reform again into new galaxies, strs and solar systems. <br>  <br>  The universe is a thing which is the efficient cause of itself.|`|0hHw5IK7aa	No - St Thomas Aquinas considered the idea that there is an order of efficient causes, and that one thing is caused to exist by another. He states:<br>  <br>  There is no case known (neither is it, indeed, possible) in which a thing is found to be the efficient cause of itself.|`|DuyuUJNDaa	Your spirit.|`|S0QWZCQiaa	yes that would be God rather we rely on him and were created by him<br>  if u dont get what im sayin reply back|`|IBvbQG3Caa	We can't know that.. There is nothing in the current existing universe (that we know of) and we can only speculate about whether the universe "caused" itself into existance, although i do believe the answer:<br>  <br>  "yes"<br>  <br>  answers your original question ;)|`|ZNRYqss9aa	The causes argument by Thomas Aquinas makes no sense it doesn't explain anything, its actually pointless|`|n0uMBKtJaa	The universe
Kiv4D2aWaa	Present day Christianity does not allow usury. Present day dominantly Christian countries have seperation of church and state. Many Muslim countries too allow usury under the name of interest.|`|EpJafAEvaa	That's funny. A Muslimah who thinks she knows anything about Jesus. You should put down your Quran and pick up "Why I Am Not A Muslim" by Ibn Warraq. You will no longer be filled with crazy ideas about Islam and it's relationship to the world...it's beginnings or it's beliefs. You might even find an answer to your question in there (wont like it but might find it).<br>  <br>  Goodbye|`|3XWJLNUlaa	The old testament rejects usury to poor people (brothers).  It was apparently acceptable to strangers.  The only reference in the new testament appears allowable. See Mathew 25:27, Leviticus 25:36-37, others.  Excessive interest was frowned upon especially to poor people.  Remember Mohamed was born after 600 AD.  Jesus was a Jew.|`|EkOwtna8aa	Usury is not simply "the practice of charging interest". Usury is also the term used for charging unfair amounts of interest. The term "usury" denotes a rate of interest greater than that which the law allows. You can charge interest without being guilty of usury. Jews and Christians have their own laws on charging interest and so do Muslims. The only difference is that Jews and Christians simply state what is allowable while Muslims say that no interest is allowable on a loan (and then find sneaky ways to get around the fact). Usury is also against secular law in most civilized countries.<br>  <br>  Example:<br>  Muslim 1: I would like to borrow 10,000 dollars at no interest.<br>  <br>  Muslim 2: Sure, I will loan you the money at no interest as long as you sell me your watch for 1 dollar and buy it back for 2001 dollars which you may wait to pay until the end of the loan.<br>  <br>  Muslim 1: Why of course. Thank you. (We have fooed Allah quite well have we not? -snicker, snicker-)|`|H8WqMK1eaa	Christianity is not meant to be used as a political, economic, or military system.<br>  <br>  Christianity is about bringing people spiritually closer to God and allowing the Holy Spirit to work in their lives.<br>  <br>  Jesus preached that we should live in peace within our respective governmental systems...but not because it was necessary for salvation:<br>  <br>  Matthew 17:24-27<br>  Matthew 20:25-28<br>  Matthew 22:15-22<br>  <br>  Jesus was not a politician.  He was not an economist.  And he was most certainly not a military strategist.<br>  <br>  EDIT @ asker:  Sometimes usury is the only way a family can get a house.  It's called a "necessary evil."<br>  <br>  If Allah can use flames, boiling water, hooked rods of iron, choking food, etc. as a "necessary evil" to punish nonbelievers, I think utilizing a mortgage loan to buy a house isn't that big of a deal.
0835d5aaaff88c49c30c004c7854c920aa	It's a measure word, like width, depth, breadth, length, etc. It's the same thing as perimeter and similar to circumference, though it's not limited to exactly circular measures. It tends to be used with round shapes though, especially long, roundish vertical objects like people and trees.<br>  <br>  "The barrel is 3 ft. in girth." <br>  "The man was so fat his girth must have doubled his height."<br>  "Ten men could join hands around the enormous girth of the redwood."<br>  <br>  It's related to the verb "to gird", which means to encircle or wrap around, especially with a belt. Basically, it's a substantive form of gird, with the idea of its being how long something would have be to gird the object, though sometimes it refers to the act of girding itself.<br>  <br>  It's not so much archaic as it is rare ("gird" however is largely archaic). There just aren't many times when you need to talk about how big around things are. Because of that younger and less educated people may not have encountered it, but it's well within the vocabulary of literate adults and is regularly used in some industries. Like if you were working as a pipe fitter or a lumberjack and you didn't know it, people would laugh at you.|`|S5mzgunIaa	usually it refers to body size ("the measure around a man's body" according to merriam webster)<br>  I remember it because it sounds like something you would call someone who is quite large<br>  It can also mean " a band or strap that encircles the body of an animal to fasten something (as a saddle) on its back|`|mUK240ykaa	Only ironically, or maybe in a poem. It's a bit archaic. It comes from the same root as 'to gird' or 'girdle'.<br>  <br>  "He's a lu sty, jolly fellow, that lives well, at least three yards in the girth." - Addison

c67a2f77ab7471bed4b2f279ff05e2e1aa	There used to be an actual "camp". Well, not with tents on a moor, or in a field, but it was the nickname for a bunch of people who were homosexuals and their friends and sympathisers in London in the late 1950's and 60's. It was called the camp because these people "camped out" in different pubs ( quite a few of them in Chelsea, I gather ) for a few evenings in each until the police discovered them and moved them on.<br>  They had colours ( scarves, etc ) to distinguish themselves from others - they were purple and dark green, and I think black.|`|kc1IBYMRaa	Susan Sontag defined camp as "failed seriousness."

Sin in the presence of God dies and would kill the bearer along with it. Jesus had to cover our sin if we were to stand in the presence of God. Covering it does not mean it goes away in this life time, though some believe it can. I believe we continue to sin as long as we live in our sinfully cursed bodies. But Jesus promises us a new, perfect, non-sin cursed body after the resurrection (in the next life) and then we will "be like him" as he was after his resurrection... perfect, and unable any longer to sin. Paul obtains perfection, I believe, as we all will, after death. It's like a seed that has to die and go into the ground to produce a massive oak tree or other plant. We die here and are born righteous in heaven because of Christ.

However, we need to look at the words, "punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord", the word everlasting meaning ongoing and using it with destruction would mean that the destruction is an ongoing thing, so the words that you use as a perpetual state of Ruination would be correct.|`|46zwfDpNaa	"3. olethros (?λεθρο?, 3639), “ruin, destruction,” akin to A, No. 6, always translated “destruction,” is used in 1 Cor. 5:5, of the effect upon the physical condition of an erring believer for the purpose of his spiritual profit; in 1 Thess. 5:3 and 2 Thess. 1:9, of the effect of the divine judgments upon men at the ushering in of the Day of the Lord and the revelation of the Lord Jesus; in 1 Tim. 6:9, of the consequences of the indulgence of the flesh, referring to physical “ruin” and possibly that of the whole being, the following word apoleia (see No. 1) stressing the final, eternal and irrevocable character of the ruin.<br>  (Vine, W.

None really seem to be instantaneous. Therefore, when we add the qualifier, "aionios", which literally means "without end", it would seem to indicate that this process of destruction is forever ongoing.<br>  <br>  When we compare this with other verses, such as Revelation 14:11, it becomes impossible, in my opinion, to logically assert that this "destruction" is finite and temporal.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, God bless you.|`|YimkX6Tzaa	Yes.<br>  <br>  Olethros, ολεθρο?, meaning destruction, ruin, death.

We would be correct if it said " who shall be punished from the presence of the Lord. because without Jesus, we are dead.  Remember, the Bible said that we are dead in our trespasses and sin until we are given life by trusting in Christ.  We are also told that the wages of sin is eternal death since this applies to all of us while we are alive, it  must mean something other then death "as we know it"  Adam and Eve were told that the day they ate of the forbidden fruit, they would die.  They did eat yet we can see that they did not die that day at least physically.  But something did happen the moment they sinned....they were separated from God.  Keeping this in mind, what 2 Thess 1:9 is saying is that if we die without having trusted Christ for salvation, we will be separated from God for all eternity.  <br>  <br>  There is a very easy remedy to this....trust Christ now.

At the end of the hundred and fifty days the water had gone down, 4 and on the seventeenth day of the seventh month the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat. 5 The waters continued to recede until the tenth month, and on the first day of the tenth month the tops of the mountains became visible.<br>  <br>      GE 8:6 After forty days Noah opened the window he had made in the ark 7 and sent out a raven, and it kept flying back and forth until the water had dried up from the earth. 8 Then he sent out a dove to see if the water had receded from the surface of the ground. 9 But the dove could find no place to set its feet because there was water over all the surface of the earth; so it returned to Noah in the ark. He reached out his hand and took the dove and brought it back to himself in the ark. 10 He waited seven more days and again sent out the dove from the ark. 11 When the dove returned to him in the evening, there in its beak was a freshly plucked olive leaf! Then Noah knew that the water had receded from the earth. 12 He waited seven more days and sent the dove out again, but this time it did not return to him.<br>  <br>      GE 8:13 By the first day of the first month of Noah's six hundred and first year, the water had dried up from the earth.

And never again will I destroy all living creatures, as I have done.<br>  <br>    GE 8:22 "As long as the earth endures,<br>    seedtime and harvest,<br>    cold and heat,<br>    summer and winter,<br>    day and night<br>    will never cease."<br>  <br>  GE 9:1 Then God blessed Noah and his sons, saying to them, "Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the earth. 2 The fear and dread of you will fall upon all the beasts of the earth and all the birds of the air, upon every creature that moves along the ground, and upon all the fish of the sea; they are given into your hands. 3 Everything that lives and moves will be food for you.

BvHRriEyaa	I really can't stand spiders, but your friends are out of order! You don't need to go out of your way to remove him from your house completely! If I was in your friends' shoes I would be happy that you are willing to move him so I don't need to see him! <br>  My sister has a huge parrot and I have a phobia of birds, she makes sure he is in his cage if I am coming over and it's easy for me to avoid being in the same room as him most of the time and I'm happy with that. <br>  I would never expect any of my friends or family to completely remove any of their pets from their own house! As long as I know they are secured and I can't see them etc, I'm happy enough!|`|dPsaYMOvaa	It's your house, your friends need to learn to repsect your belongings, your pets and you by not being so demanding and rude. They are the ones with the problem, so why should you have to make the sacrifices?<br>  Tell them politely that you do not have the time or money to waste on fuel because of their problem, so the top floor will have to do. If they still refuse, ask if you can go around to their house or meet somewhere else instead.|`|zgBelCROaa	That is totally ridiculous. Your friends are being babies. What happens if a daddy long legs shows up in your kitchen? Will they sue you? <br>  <br>  I would just put him a closet or a hidden area and shut the door. Then when they are not looking put the spider on them. hahah|`|wyAtVqbOaa	What do they do when they arrive at your house - check under the beds, move the sofa, look behind the tv for spiders?  I don't think so.  Have you pointed out that your pet spider is not the only one in your house?  <br>  <br>  To be honest, if any of my friends have a fear of spiders and they were coming round to my house, I would put a cover over the tank and leave it at that, if they don't like it they know where the front door is.  <br>  <br>  I think you're doing more than you have to when you offer to put it upstairs - tell them if they can't accept that then you hope they get over their fear of spiders as you miss them at your house.|`|Yu7y6yfraa	Keep your pet spider at home.  All you have to do is assure them that he is confined to his little home and cannot get out.<br>  <br>  There is a good chance that all of your friends have spiders around their own homes.  If they cannot appreciate your pet when it is out of site and they do not have to go around it; I would consider it their problem and just let them stay home.<br>  <br>  I do not see how they go outside or anywhere else if they are that petrified of spiders.  Spiders are everywhere and at least your pet is probably not poisonous.|`|beec2f445a2f6c8a9e45a63f5ad1bbacaa	No it's not! <br>  <br>  They are being unreasonable. I have friends who dislike or have allergies or phobias about animals, I have nurses coming into my home every day and a Doctor visiting regularly who is terrified of dogs. One of my friends even has a phobia of frogs. <br>  What do I do when they come in, I put my very large but friendly GSD out of the room or in the garden, I make sure the cats are out or upstairs and I cover my African Dwarf frog tank with a towel! <br>  <br>  Your willingness to put the spider upstairs in a closed room should be sufficient for your friends. I'd point out to them that there are probably a dozen or more spiders in their own homes or yours that they don't know the whereabouts of. Every home as them. LOL|`|vg0iy8dBaa	Did you make them aware that you had a pet spider before hand? If not then you probably should've thought of that, it's not like they would've never noticed. If you did tell them prior to the invitation then I'd remind them of it and say that you'll be sure to keep it far away from them but that you care for him as a person would a dog or a cat and aren't about to leave it with some random stranger. If they knew what they were getting into and had a problem with it, they should not have come over.

kkO87h0Xaa	I think they need an excuse to kill INNOCENT people, but why would they feel the need to kill innocent people? Some people die unjustified deaths, but to each person, the motive is different.<br>  <br>  And, any sort of killing that makes you feel like you're doing it in the name of religion, makes you feel like it's the right thing to do, if you're brainwashed enough to think that killing innocent people in the name of religion is okay too.<br>  <br>  But, it's not. Everyone's mentality is different.<br>  <br>  I'm in no way justifying unjustified terrorism, but there are some instances where it can be justified to take defense--especially against people who have killed and taken every one you love away from you, and don't take responsibilities for their actions.|`|hCJzZ5rnaa	They think they can come onto Western soil and fly planes into our buildings, blow themselves up and kill thousands of innocent Westerners. The West retaliates, then the Middle-East blames the West for terrorism because the West is over there kicking their butts. EVEN THOUGH it was Islam and the terrorists which instigated it!<br>  <br>  Not all Muslims are terrorists, I understand this. My prayers go out to every innocent who has died in the Middle-East as a result of the Western force's presence there, but after the terrorist attack 9/11, the West had little choice but to do so.|`|757ce30489e7f56556925d17f1f49f76aa	I think it's just lack of knowledge really. Coz they think they're doing the right thing, because someone that they obviously put their trust in has told them that it is.|`|6LBJgACSaa	Hypocrisy.|`|9QBlKlFmaa	This is an excellent question.  You should first note that this is not a modern phenomenon.<br>  <br>  In the centuries after Muhammad there have been periods when the Jews were able to live in relative peace under Arabs, but their position was never secure.  They were generally viewed with contempt by their Arab neighbors, and their survival was always predicated on their abject subordination and degradation to them.  <br>  <br>  Mass murders of Jewish "protected people" started in Morocco as early as the eighth century, where Idris I wiped out whole communities.  A century later Baghdad's Caliph al-Mutawakkil designated a yellow badge for Jews (setting a precedent that would be followed centuries later in Nazi Germany), and synagogues were destroyed throughout Mesopotamia in 854-859.  In Tripolitania, Jews were considered the property of their Arab masters, who would bequeath the Jews to their heirs upon death.  In the 12th century, after anti-Jewish riots, the contemporaries commented that their population had 'greatly declined.' <br>  <br>  <br>  .|`|ZTc7rE1Haa	I think the answer is simple and obvious: Muslims think that only their religion is valid. They don't tolerate people of other faiths and want everyone to convert to their faith. I don't mind what they do in their own countries, but it offends me deeply that they come to the UK and instead of being happy to be allowed to come here they try to inflict their ways on us. We have people of just about every nationality and religion here, but only muslims try to force their religion and culture down our throats. Our country has also become a breeding ground for terrorists who were born in this country but have been brainwashed by islam.|`|Y9ruXnKcaa	Stupidity.|`|czHjKjULaa	cause theyre all a bunch of twats :/ :S<br>  Or theyre very very horny ;D|`|SaYZBTfqaa	yas, alot do die ion the name of Allah, expecially the talibans..... let me tell you my opinion... This whole thing started, after bush , commited the 9/11, and then blamed it on Osama Binladen. then out of no where, they start a war with Iraq, just to find one innocent guy, saddam hussain... Then they move into Afghanistan to fight... well, do you obviously think where jus gonna sit here and let U.S's military kill our brothers, and thats when we show them our power, look at U.S's military now, it sucks, its been 5 looong years, and they still havent defeated the taliban, and there the ones that call themselves the strongest... Now, the taliban, are trained by the worlds third ranking SSG (pakistans special forces) there is no way U.S can stop them... Infact on my opinion, I think this is gonna leed to the last war on earth....<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: well said Paki24<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit... Uhhhhh, Girls get pissed off easely dude,,, no offence to you|`|zVCNdIWkaa	You want to know Why?, just think about it. What would drive someone to blow themselves up for a cause they believe in. Take Palestine as an example. Imagine since your time of birth, you have no basic human rights, you are degraded and humiliated on a daily basis, you see your parents mistreated/beaten, made fun of on a daily basis when they go through the checkpoints to get to work/or medical treatment. No access to electricity/fresh running water. No work. The list goes on and on. I could be here all day. But just imagined you lived that existence on a daily basis. I have often asked myself what would drive someone to do such a thing, because most people in the West just really don't get it. But when I really took a closer look and understood the plight of the Palestinians, I could really understand why you would be driven to do such an act out of despair.<br>  What do you think? Do I have a point?<br>  <br>  An excellent documentary to watch is Peace, Propaganda & the Promised Land. (It expresses both Palestinian & Israeli comments on the conflict). It's a must see.|`|Rcgy1uDYaa	Because facist governments such as USA, UK and Israel go and bomb thousands of innocent civilians. So the suicide bombers would see themselves as martyrs who are defending their country, even though suicide bombing is completely haram.<br>  <br>  I am against suicide bombing but I'm all for people to defend their countries from foreign invaders. One man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter.|`|bZo5Z53Uaa	Injustice= leads to people acting in different manners. If they speak up about the injustice that is happening to the Muslims, they prob get chucked in a cell.<br>  <br>  So these days even freedom of speech is not really allowed, they want us to be puppets mimicking their way (kuffar) and it is ever so appent in today's time.<br>  <br>  Where ever you look they are attacking us, hence some people do not know what to do. Others are just ignorant, but Allah (swt) knows best what goes through their hearts and mind.

HM2pvjWmaa	should white people go back to Europe, yeah!|`|kM4D8e4Aaa	English and French are a given, seeing as they are your two official languages. Mandarin is unnecessary.|`|FKxrJxbPaa	No not at all<br>  <br>  English and french are official languages because they're spoken by roughly 75% and 25% of Canada's population as a main means of communication. Mandarin, on the other hand, is restricted to the Chinese immigrant community and even among THEM not all Chinese speak it. Over 500 million Chinese in China itself have no knowledge of Mandarin so why teach it here as a mandatory course. Its unlikely any Canadian student of non-Asian heritage will ever find themselves in dire need of deciphering a text written in Mandarin. There's no need for it in any manner so why make it compulsory?<br>  <br>  Aside from that Mandarin is only useful if you go to China. French is spoken throughout Europe, North Africa and West Africa, as well as several Caribbean Islands and parts of Oceania and Southeast Asia. English is spoken on every continent as well. The benefits of English outweigh those of Mandarin so what use is it?|`|AA10232076	No. <br>  Reason: For what? They don't make it mandatory for Americans to learn all of those languages on a federal level, doing that kinda encroaches on like freedoms of people doing what they want, plus what if a person would rather learn Spanish and they would find it more useful than Mandarin? That's not cool, it should be a choice type thing. Because, here's the thing, not everyone will ever really leave Canada, so learning all 3 would be pointless for most people.|`|O7w6XGqPaa	It is silly to lump Canada's two official tongues with a language concentrated in only one part of the world. Let Canadians choose their own third language if any.|`|EXurNsB4aa	Why should people be forced to learn Mandarin just because you have identity issues?  A good Canadian language to learn would be Inuktitut.|`|uGT5d8Pdaa	No, English and French are only Canada's principal languages.|`|8NZC6LsRaa	no
xtKEToLHaa	Yes, I agree with LexDiamonds...<br>  <br>  In fact, I think that national identity is something very very complex...<br>  <br>  Cubans, for instance, are considered as Hispanics, but a lot of Cubans are technically African origin or Native origin...It seems that the language and cultural unity there has created a national conscience that is much stronger that it is in the US, regardless of races...|`|kM4D8e4Aaa	I'm sure Nixon thought the same thing when they created the "Hispanic" categorization.|`|FKxrJxbPaa	Yes, very weird.<br>  <br>  For example: Culturally speaking, Jamaicans and Americans are VERY different, almost lightyears apart, and yet they speak the same language. On the other hand, Brazilians and Venezuelans are culturally similar, and yet they speak differing languages. So what would make a Black Jamaican and a White American the same race when they share nothing in common aside from language (which at times is very distinct to the point of loss of understanding)?|`|8vfCRg7Caa	everything you have and sometimes the only thing a person can judge you by is your appearance. What would happen if you had to go to court, go in front of a judge or somebody has to make a quick judgment call on your bail or even if its just letting you off the hook on something in life, like a loan or something. You will be surprised how far you appearance goes. And if people think your color of your skin has nothing to do with appearance think again. i even have to catch my self stereotyping all kind of people. I dont let it get the best of me, but its human.|`|VhBW7AjAaa	Sorry, but in my book, it's not any more acceptable than classifying people by color. Language changes over time as well.|`|6ac013da2dceabac6383ebdee4f828c0aa	I think personality is even more important than language.  And skin color is a non-issue to me.|`|EXurNsB4aa	You're not weird, but you are wrong.  I don't think you have a realistic worldview or view of how language works with cultures.  Please reassess your opinions.  Find examples of how you think language unites people despite other differences.|`|pfke6Jieaa	yeah in a way it can be that way. but remember with latinos. latino can be anything. puerto ricans are mulatto and mexicans are mestizo and they both speak spanish so they are the same culture.|`|tfC8BQXOaa	I don't see the chinese looking at it that way. Just walk into any of their shops and see if you see someone of your kind working there.<br>  And this isn't even China.|`|Ra9A6tcZaa	None of them are important love is what is important|`|HM2pvjWmaa	not really, but probably in society cuz white people think they own the planet.

The misery could be being brought on by other people, which is something that can't be controlled most of the time.|`|eAMq1iBWaa	In most cases we really do make our own miseries.<br>  <br>  It's an outlook on life for many|`|3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	There are people who live in perpetual poverty, and I wouldn't blame them for being miserable.

If a person has a psychiatric illness, that is of no fault of their own. The illness may make them sad, and they may have it for life. For this, they need meds that work, so that they don't feel miserable.<br>  <br>  If a person has no psychiatric illness, then I agree, being perpetually miserable is a choice.|`|AA12360579	Yes.<br>  <br>  You can either have a positive outlook on life or a negative one.<br>  <br>  Some people do have actual, clinical depression, but they can either choose to be miserable or seek help.|`|G9dZN8omaa	Yes.<br>  <br>  Being happy or sad are mental states.

You can't necessarily just "have" a positive outlook.  You can't even necessarily approach or try or even take steps, because you are already miserable.  You may lack the drive or motivation to get better, and not always by choice.|`|eb71d539c6860290e80bdaa4253a2f87aa	Not necessarily.<br>  <br>  Most people don't realize just how much control hormones have over our moods. If you have a severe hormonal imbalance, no amount of positive thinking can stimulate your brain into feeling happy. "Happiness" is a chemical interaction occurring in the brain.<br>  <br>  No Chemical Interaction in the Brain = No Happiness. <br>  <br>  It really is just that simple.|`|oMF6bXCZaa	Yes -everything in our lives is made up of the choices we have made to that point.If one is miserable, then one is choosing to think miserable thoughts.  Death bring sadness and sometimes misery, but since death comes to everyone, we have to make the choice to continue on our lives, and then make the second choice to be happy.   Whatever is going on in our head is what our lives are like.  If we are think mostly negative thoughts, then are lives will bring us negative circumstances.  If our mind is made of mostly positive thoughts, then that is what our lives will be, positive.<br>  <br>  Sometimes it is challenging to bring ourselves out of the negative and into the positive, but if we want to be happy, have a reasonably good life, and learn lessons from the mistakes we make, then we HAVE to change our way of thinking.,  <br>  <br>  IF WE CHANGE THE WAY WE LOOK AT THINGS THE THINGS WE LOOK AT CHANGE<br>  <br>  Change your thinking, change your life. .|`|c89abafddc3fb33f3a459212995e5938aa	I don't think that being miserable is a choice, but rather the consequence of previous choices.  You can't just decide to not be miserable, but you can take actions to change the circumstances of your misery, and hopefully change things.<br>  And then there's always medication...|`|ylaGS5EHaa	Yes, every time someone asks my grandfather how he is doing he replies, "I choose to do well." In the past 3 years he's had cancer removed twice and lost both of his siblings.

ce060a29a8e7cbb3f7cdc004ec90adc3aa	Look at all the answers that scream about "socialism". Well let's LOOK at the top 5 BEST nations which DO offer Universal Health care AND also have the highest standards of living. They are ALL socialist Nations. They ALL provide health care for everyone and they ALL have lower child death rates. So, explain to me HOW is that a BAD thing? You folks have confused socialism with ruthless dictatorships. <br>  <br>  Brightest Blessings,<br>  Raji the Green Witch|`|XoUfUl6Yaa	It doesn't help that most believe in "rapture".|`|JXLiZEb2aa	Republican Jesus says, "Eat the poor first."|`|408d09404066a3f4b3514273ef2131cdaa	Doesn't make much sense, does it?|`|69GgJhnWaa	Let me put it this way for you. First, being christian has nothing to do with being conservative. Second, have you every been to the DMV? You remember getting there and spending god knows how long waiting for service? That is what happens with universal health care. The government runs the health care, therefore all health-related issues must be okay-ed by the government before they will pay. Also, there is no guarantee that you will be approved to go to the hospital nearest you. You may have to travel 100miles (and I'm not joking, I researched it) to have a baby or get treated for an illness. Also, if you have a long-term illness and the government decides they don't want to pay for your treatment any longer, they don't have to because they run our health care. Research it, I mean seriously research it and how well it's worked elsewhere and how people elsewhere feel about it, then ask this question again. Because obviously, you haven't bothered.<br>  <br>  ....So basically, you want the rest of the nation to pay tax dollars and lower their standards of health care to fit your needs....and I'm the one that's selfish? Hmmm...sure. why not. Makes perfect sense to me too.|`|DhcQC9DBaa	no the reason is look at canida. they have universal health care, and they have to come to the united states to get anything done. universal health care brings down the quality of health care. its not a matter of being christians. it is a matter of looking around and seeing what works and what doesn't.|`|MoUtk7cUaa	it's not the fact that they're christians, it's about the fact that the numbers are being misreported, and that socialism doesn't work.  look at canada w/ their socialized medicine.  it takes a year to see your doctor. and everyone, even people who don't need/want health care have to pay for it.  look at your history and see for yourself. you also seem to think, as do others posting here, that there are no poor conservatives, a rediculous assumption.<br>  <br>  for the fool who posted 'suffrage of children', they never have and never will have the right to vote. dolt!<br>  <br>  also, so you live in montana and have to travel.  did you know that montana is one of the biggest states in the union?  do you know you can move if you like?  do you really believe it will get better under UHC? if so, perhaps you'd like to buy some carbon offsets too...<br>  <br>  to the fool talking about fascism.  most people don't know that almost all fascist are socialists, conservatives are not.  read your history.|`|wdBY1fWaaa	Because the health care system will be ruined by GOVERNMENT control. Do you think the government will run it efficiently? Oh yeah, they do everything else so well don't they?<br>  <br>  Health care will be rationed to people, some will not get it in time. If you don't think that will happen, you need to read up on the subject. "Hey, it took 5 months to get an MRI...but it's FREE!!!"|`|fNw4wJSGaa	Because of your mistaken notion that it would be free. It's not. It's very expensive, and would cost ALL who pay taxes a lot.<br>  <br>  I also know, that roughly 1/2 of those who aren't insured, well at least before all the economy stuff went down, chose not to be. Those who choose not to pay for insurance, are generally males in their mid 20's to their 30's, who take a gamble, as most men don't have any real health issues, or feel they need to worry about them until age 40. When most start getting more frequent tests for prostate cancer and other age related problems.<br>  <br>  I also know, that while the countries that have smaller populations do have very good nationalized health care, large countries like Canada, don't. Many in Canada, that can afford to, don't use the countries health care. They pay out of pocket for BETTER care, and/or come to the US. <br>  <br>  And with as terrible as our government is with everything else, do you really want to give them MORE money to squander?<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  Oh and just so you know, we have some of the best doctors and hospitals in the WORLD! Why do you think that is....hmmm....let's think about that....oh yeah....MONEY!<br>  <br>  With out the money, R&D suffer. <br>  <br>  Also, one of the biggest reasons health costs keep rising, is malpractice suites. The more there are, the more the malpractice insurance rises. It's made a chilling affect on my area. In Missouri, the malpractice insurance had risen so much, that many doctors close to the Kansas state line, move over to Kansas, so they could keep their practices open, and not have to raise rates because of the rise in insurance cost to them.<br>  <br>  I understand in your wide-eyed innocents, and caring heart, you have failed to research the pros and cons of this kind of system. You really should look at the details a little more closely, before endorcing such a plan.|`|yhFJzscmaa	First of all, it's not free. It just isn't. Someone has to pay. There is no system in the world that works. What you always end up with is limited health care, long waits (months) and discrimination against the elderly or special needs. Besides that, such a system does not support advances very well. The other really big issue is that it forces doctors to do things against their conscience, such as birth control or abortions. And of course we all have to pay for that.|`|gdYN39gtaa	Nothing is free. Citizens tax monies are used to pay for all<br>        these programs that Congress votes in to law. I like to pick<br>        my own insurance carrier that I can trust. Can you trust those<br>        guys in D.C."?  What do they know about Health Care and<br>        Insurance? They aren't doing very good with Social Security<br>        and Medicare. They say those programs will go broke in<br>        ten years or less. If they can't run those without going broke,<br>        how do you think they can run health care for everyone in<br>        the whole united states? That is why I don't support this.|`|0fnzDpKXaa	clboarder12: I live in Canada and don't know anyone who's ever had to go to the US to have anything done.  I'm sure it happens but it's rare.  Everyone has the right to health care, not just a select privileged few.|`|NWopkX4baa	They want to force people into poverty so they will be forced to accept Christian love and compassion when they have nothing left.|`|angPpFY7aa	Religious nuts hate the idea of modernizing anything. You don't have to look very far back in history to realize that they are against progress of any kind.|`|rcPnnfmmaa	They've been hijacked by the Republican party.|`|RUGplydtaa	the key word is conservative|`|771a46b3a001f059eb7ca678c7061fbdaa	First off nothing is free.  You meant to say there should be government provided health care that is paid for from citizens tax dollars.  The thought that it is free is a bad one because it makes it seem as if we are getting something for nothing which is a definitely not true.  Everything comes with a price.<br>  <br>  I believe that conservative Christians are very wary of government control of anything.  They see the government as a religion in and of itself and they do not want it getting to the point where people worship it.  The is one true God that should be depended upon to provide.  They see our government as trying to be just that.  Valid or not that is their view.|`|MRvwEnB0aa	Socialized medicine is very poor medicine. Those of us who have lived in the US and outside are able to say with confidence that the kind of health care envisioned by the liberal administration is much worse than what we have now. We've seen it. And some of us have lived it.The losers in our society (US citizens referred to as slackers) naturally want the government to give them something free, like health care, because they can't seem to get it for themselves.|`|MZHXUcXbaa	because most of them are rich and would be the ones paying for it|`|YX4y4vCfaa	Food and health care should not be a commodity. They should be a right. I'm glad I live in a country that at least has one of these aspects correct.<br>  <br>  In fact if it wasn't for our health care system I would have either:<br>  <br>  a) Died when I was twelve because I had to have major kidney surgery that resulted in a ten day hospital stay as well as about 20-30 very involved tests to determine my ailment that if I was american my parents would likely not have been able to afford.<br>  <br>  b) My parents would have gone completely bankrupt and lost our family farm which which would almost be as devastating as losing a young family member.<br>  <br>  But the thing about american conservatives is they don't believe in love for society. The shark ethic prevails in their philosophy. They would have rather seen me, a twelve year old child, die a long painful death from kidney failure than to even spend $100 to help me and my family. Quite pathetic really. <br>  <br>  PS. I'm not sure that this is really a religious issue although I have heard many evangelists protest against public health care and then ironically talk about how much love they have for everybody.<br>  <br>  Edit: <br>  Cleboard is half right but they did not figure out the actual cause. The only reason why canadians ever have to go to the US (which is rare anyway) is because their corrupt private healthcare system steals allot of our good doctors leaving us strained for profesional care. Like I said, america will kill the rest of the world before they kill themselves.|`|vDPn7CaUaa	That gives the government even more control than they already have. And this puts them in control of your life. What medical treatments you can get, what doctors you can see. And our national budget? That's how much  money your insurance company has for you. Theres that cap there. <br>  <br>  And also this means that ever citizen will be paying for not only his healthcare but the guy down the street, the guy across town, etc.|`|tNt2UNd5aa	it has nothing to do with religion. Universal Health Care means we have to pay for peoples health care. it means more taxes. there is no such thing as free healthcare and it will cause hospitals to go bankrupt.|`|790nzPyPaa	Because conservative christens believe in sadistic ideas, and support the suffrage of children who's parents cant afford health care.|`|vTra7n5baa	Because they're overly individualistic, uninformed, and isolated.  I mean how much global knowledge and sense of modernity would there be in the types of places many of them are from?|`|Grb85RJuaa	Conservative Christians only care about other conservative Christians.|`|xi9YtImfaa	The word "conservative" in your question says it all. This is an issue of politics, not religion.

You would want to get the best help for them. Something for their Tourette's Syndrome if that is what it is.|`|g0lKlQGnaa	Your question should read; Why do most Conservatives not support universal health care.  It is not a Christian ideology<br>  <br>  There are also downsides to UHC, such as degraded quality of care, waiting lists, etc.  I guess conservatives feel if they have the income, they should be able to purchase the highest quality of health care available.  There is also the money issue.  It is extraordinarily expensive especially in difficult economic times like now|`|LJ6vHfgoaa	People have seen how it "works" in other countries.<br>  <br>  Supreme Court of Canada admits common delays in the public system result in death and permanent disability:<br>  <br>  "Delays in the public system are widespread and have serious, sometimes grave, consequences. There was no dispute that there is a waiting list for cardiovascular surgery for life-threatening problems. Dr. Daniel Doyle, a cardiovascular surgeon who teaches and practises in Quebec City, testified that a person with coronary disease is 'sitting on a bomb' and can die at any moment. He confirmed, without challenge, that patients die while on waiting lists: A.R., at p. 461. Inevitably, where patients have life-threatening conditions, some will die because of undue delay in awaiting surgery." -- Supreme Court of Canada, Chaoulli v. Quebec, paragraph 112<br>  <br>  "Dr. Eric Lenczner, an orthopaedic surgeon, testified that the one-year delay commonly incurred by patients requiring ligament reconstruction surgery increases the risk that their injuries will become irreparable (A.R., at p. 334). Dr. Lenczner also testified that 95 percent of patients in Canada wait well over a year, and many two years, for knee replacements. While a knee replacement may seem trivial compared to the risk of death for wait-listed coronary surgery patients, which increases by 0.5 percent per month (A.R., at p. 450), the harm suffered by patients awaiting replacement knees and hips is significant. Even though death may not be an issue for them, these patients 'are in pain', 'would not go a day without discomfort' and are 'limited in their ability to get around', some being confined to wheelchairs or house bound (A.R., at pp. 327-28)." -- Supreme Court of Canada, Chaoulli v.

P544Sbmqaa	I think its fine in casual settings with just your friends.  I think its inappropriate in a more professional setting, and most certainly inappropriate to swear at public service staff (like the cashier or fast food people or other customer service people) or people of authority.

AA11982425	I read your profile, and as a result,  I think I may have found a possible source of your headaches.  If you are anything like me, your problem is caffeine consumption.  In the past, I consumed it from coffee, but it's possible you are consuming it from dark chocolate.  You are probably easily addicted to caffeine (as I am).  If you have some one day, and none the next day, your body will send you a messasge that it wants another caffeine fix by giving you a headache.  The headache is your withdrawal symptom.  <br>  <br>  Most people don't realize that, and take a headache pill.  Check the ingredients of headache pills.  You'll discover that they contain caffeine.  And the caffeine in the pills is what gets rid of your headache.  It provides you with a minimal amount of caffeine--just enough to satisfy your body's need and to get rid of the withdrawal symptom (the headache). <br>  <br>  If you want to know for sure, just indulge in dark chocolate one day, and then don't have any the next day.  If you get a headache  the next day, you're most likely suffering from what is known as caffeine withdrawal.  And, incidentally, I'm suggesting you conduct your test with dark chocolate because you indicate in your profile blurb that you enjoy it, but if you are a coffee drinker too, you may want to test that too.  That is, have your coffee one day, and don't have it on the next.  In other words, ingest caffeine containing products one day, and avoid them completely the next to see whether you get a headache.  <br>  <br>  High caffeine products such as coffee, tea, chocolate, brownies, and others will deposit a substantial quantity of caffeine in your system.  And, if like me, you are easily addicted to caffeine, and you don't have more the next day, your body will give you a headache.  And the cure is more  caffeine, or just a little bit of caffeine (such as the amount in a headache pill).  <br>  <br>  If you determine that you are easily addicted to caffeine, the best thing for you to do is to stop ingesting it.  That is, stay away from coffee, tea, chocolate, brownies, and other products that are high in caffeine.  I did so 7 years ago, and haven't had a headache since.<br>  <br>  You may think, OMG, I can't give up chocolate, but trust me hon, you can.  I did, and now I no longer like it.  Chocolate tastes  like strong black coffee now.  It holds no more appeal for me.  Getting off it just takes time.  Before you know it you'll be surprised to discover that chocolate (especially the dark chocolate) tastes bitter and you don't like it anymore.  <br>  <br>  ADDENDUM:<br>  I happened to notice that another poster indicated that he has been successful using Hydrogen Peroxide to cure a sore throat.  <br>  <br>  I'm not here to tell him or anyone else what to do.  Just want to share that I've learned that sore throats can be cured much more safely with simple salt water.  Mix a tablespoon of comon table salt in a cup of warm tap water and then gargle with the saline solution.  The salt will kill the germs and rid you of your sore throat in short order--usually within a day.  <br>  <br>  I learned about this while watching a public service announcement on TV.  The commercial showed a lab culture under the microscope.  The thing contained germs galore.  Then they dropped one grain of salt in the middle of the culture.  When the grain of salt hit the culture, all the germs ran from it.  They wanted no part of it.  My experience has been that I can get rid of a sore throat in one day or less with salt water.  Just disolve a tablespoon of salt in a cup of warm water, use a couple of mouthfulls to first rinse your mouth, then gargle with the remaining liquid except for the last mouthfull.  Just swallow the last mouthfull to coat your throat with salt all the way down into your tummy.  Repeat as often as you feel the need.  The sore throat will be gone in a day or less.  <br>  <br>  My preference to this approach, and reluctance to have anything to do with Hydrogen Peroxide (won't even keep it in the house) is that Hydrogen Peroxide can cause blindness.  It's very dangerous stuff--make sure none of it ever gets into your eyes.  To better understand its danger, click on the link provided below.  Or better yet, ask your eye doctor for his opinion.  Hydrogen Peroxide is very, very dangerous stuff.|`|ODf41iN4aa	Hot peppermint tea works for me.  Inhale it & drink it.  Yoga & breathing & opening the door & breathing are good.  Make sure the nostrils are cleared.  Salt water rinses may help clear out pollen.  Do neck rolls & massage the neck & head massage & full massage, starting with feet.  Press & release on arms & legs & down from the shoulders, with all movements toward the heart.    Be sure that swim caps aren't too tight, & shower away any smell of chlorine from pools.  The idea in all this is to improve breathing & circulation.  No guarantees.  Of course, routine blood pressure checks are a good idea.<br>  <br>  Yeah, Old Guy is right, too.  Watch out for too much caffeine & chocolate.  Likewise, cheddar cheese is suspect for migraine headaches.  Mozzarella seems to be ok for me.  Resting in a dark room may be helpful.  I won't even say to try to relax when you're just hoping for the headache to go away.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|oMF6bXCZaa	Of course it is according to what is causing the headaches.<br>  <br>  I find knowing `pressure points`on my face and head, really helps.(I found those on the internet)  Also, agree with one answer, If it is sinus pressure or a cold, steaming is wonderful.<br>  <br>  Also, Cayenne is a wonder herb that I use all the time for many reasons.|`|92a3fb7b7f1d654236cf6fd9992204d4aa	I used to have a sinus headache at least once a week and they would often last for one to 3 days.

And most people don't seem to mind. So all the people bitching about how being an atheist is more of a stigma in America should shut the **** up. Being gay or black is so much harder, and no I am not black, however my two best friends growing up were. I've heard the things people said to them, and saw the way people look at them. And as for me, I've certainly had plenty of things said to me. A black person can't walk into a store without having someone follow them half the time. And two men can't even embrace for a quick hug without someone yelling fag, or giving them a dirty look. How many times have you been followed in a store for being an atheist, or received a dirty for hugging another artiest? Nobody ******* cares, there are plenty of ******* atheist out there, stop trying to jump on the band wagon of discrimination. And to answer the question, it really depends on the area. I think it is now less socially acceptable to be open about racism in some areas, however that just breeds the closet racism. Its certainly more acceptable in society today to have a hatred for gay people.

It is all brainwashing, especially from different groups of Muslims that believe other religions are bad, why because they believe that culture is made upon what they believe and because they are other religions besides Muslims they wont be as lucky as them. Remember one, two ,three four thousand people cannot speak for the rest of the Muslim population. Islam can be peaceful it all depends the way people read it and perceive it's message.|`|I5pUxwPbaa	that's funny because I have not seen any muslim bullying anyone, and we only talk about our faith if someone asks a question or is interested. In fact we are quite polite compared to others........you are actually wrong about muslims not knowing other faiths, I have met many who are more versed in other religiouns than those who actually follow those religions.  Of course since we believe in Islam then other religions cannot all be right, what do you expect?|`|9HeeXuGuaa	As a convert into Islam, I can sense your hatred towards Muslims.<br>  <br>  Islam is the culmination of Christianity and Judaism - a rectification, a perfected way of life. In general, Muslims know more about those beliefs than the others know about Islam. That is because Christian and Jewish history IS Islamic history.  <br>  <br>  The premise of your question is false.  PS, what do you know about Islam besides the negative false stereotypes.  I know I know more about Christianity than most Christians I meet.<br>  <br>  <br>  TO FATEFINGER:  Muslims kill to push their way of life? LOL!!! Muslims are being killed in Palestine, Iraq, Afghanistan, Chechnya, Kashmir, Bosnia, and oppressed in their OWN countries.  Not a single Muslim country puts emphasis on militarism, only 1 has nukes, which is why they are being punked by the rest of the world.<br>  <br>  TO Yung Witness:  SHOW ME  where in the Quran it says ANYTHING remotely ressembling your lie.  You sir, are a horrible lying ignorant person.|`|8I9uduIiaa	The Quran is full of hatred for 'infidels' - non Muslims.  It's there in black and white; anyone can check for themselves just by getting a copy of the Quran and looking.<br>  <br>  Islam is more than just a faith. It is also a political system. 'True' Muslims work towards establishing a global 'caliphate' in which Sharia Law governs all.<br>  <br>  Islamic belief is that ONLY when the whole world is Muslim, can there be 'peace'.<br>  <br>  Yes, there are many, many decent and peace-loving Muslims - this is true.

It will allow people to understand the truth about the religion and break free from political correctness imposed notions about it.

If you read the Koran you find reference to 'people of the book' who are committed to God and hence are OK by Muslims. Some Muslims don't follow the essence of the Koran as some Christians don't follow the essence of the teachings of Christ.<br>  <br>  Bullying is in the arsenal of all fanatics – Christians have and still use it, Hindu ditto, Hebrews as well as Muslims. However I believe we should first remove the tag which identifies them with a book and group them where they belong – bullies for they do not follow the teachings they espouse.<br>  <br>  Jesus taught:<br>  <br>   [Mark 12:29] And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments is, Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord:<br>  [Mark 12:30] And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this is the first commandment.<br>  [Mark 12:31] And the second is like, namely this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these.<br>  <br>  In the Quran, sorry my copy is not running properly so I will need to rely on my Muslim brothers to help me here, after verses which seem harsh it states “But Allah is Merciful and loves the Merciful”.<br>  <br>  The Old Testament gives harsh penalties but:<br>  <br>  [Lev 19:14] Thou shalt not curse the deaf, nor put a stumblingblock before the blind, but shalt fear thy God: I am the Lord.<br>  [Lev 19:15] Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment: thou shalt not respect the person of the poor, nor honour the person of the mighty: but in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbour.<br>  [Lev 19:16] Thou shalt not go up and down as a talebearer among thy people: neither shalt thou stand against the blood of thy neighbour; I am the Lord.<br>  [Lev 19:17] Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart: thou shalt in any wise rebuke thy neighbour, and not suffer sin upon him.<br>  [Lev 19:18] Thou shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself: I am the Lord. <br>  <br>  Jesus further clarified with:<br>  <br>  [Luke 6:37] Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven:<br>  [Luke 6:38] Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again.<br>  <br>  Instead of tell each other to take the stick from your eye should we not help each other remove the log from our own.<br>  <br>  People of the Book unite against the true enemy of man – hate the tool of the deceiver.|`|cC8TamjSaa	Muslims are usually ignorant primitive people living in countries that are centuries behind the times.

But if any deny the Signs of Allah, Allah is swift in calling to account.

[6:161] <br>  <br>  Who can be better in Religion than one who submits his whole self to Allah, does good, and follows the way of Abraham the true in Faith? For Allah did take Abraham for a friend.  [4:125] <br>  <br>  If anyone desires a Religion other than Islam (submission to Allah., never will it be accepted of him; and in the Hereafter He will be in the ranks of those who have lost (All spiritual good).  [3:85]<br>  <br>  “The Religion of Allah”<br>  (Deeni Allah)<br>  <br>  Do they seek for other than the Religion of Allah.-while all creatures in the heavens and on earth have, willing or unwilling, bowed to His Will (Accepted Islam), and to Him shall they all be brought back.  [3:83] Say: "We believe in God, and in what has been revealed to us and what was revealed to Abraham, Isma'il, Isaac, Jacob, and the Tribes, and in (the Books) given to Moses, Jesus, and the prophets, from their Lord: We make no distinction between one and another among them, and to God do we bow our will (in Islam)." [3:84]  If anyone desires a religion other than Islam (submission to God), never will it be accepted of him; and in the Hereafter He will be in the ranks of those who have lost (All spiritual good). [3:85]<br>  <br>  And thou dost see the people enter Allah's Religion in crowds, [110:2]  Celebrate the praises of thy Lord, and pray for His Forgiveness: For He is Oft-Returning (in Grace and Mercy). [110:3]  <br>  <br>  The woman and the man guilty of adultery or fornication,- flog each of them with a hundred stripes: Let not compassion move you in their case, in a matter prescribed by Allah, if ye believe in Allah and the Last Day: and let a party of the Believers witness their punishment.

[3:19]<br>  <br>  “The same religion has He established for you as that which He enjoined on Noah”<br>  (SharaAAa lakum mina alddeeni ma wassa bihi noohan)<br>  <br>  The same religion has He established for you as that which He enjoined on Noah - the which We have sent by inspiration to thee - and that which We enjoined on Abraham, Moses, and Jesus: Namely, that ye should remain steadfast in religion, and make no divisions therein: to those who worship other things than Allah, hard is the (way) to which thou callest them. Allah chooses to Himself those whom He pleases, and guides to Himself those who turn (to Him). [42:13]  And they became divided only after Knowledge reached them,- through selfish envy as between themselves. Had it not been for a Word that went forth before from thy Lord, (tending) to a Term appointed, the matter would have been settled between them: But truly those who have inherited the Book after them are in suspicious (disquieting) doubt concerning it.[42:15]  <br>  <br>  “The religion of Truth”<br>  (Deena alhaq)<br>  <br>  It is He Who has sent His Messenger with Guidance and the Religion of Truth, to proclaim it over all religion: and enough is Allah for a Witness.

PS6Pjtndaa	Look ... you see atheist after atheist after atheist mocking God, mocking the threat that they will go to hell.  The Bible describes these people as being in bondage to sin, as having hard hearts, and being blind to the truth.  Every Christian was once to a greater or lesser degree the same way.  We loved our sins more than the Lord.  The Lord CALLS us to Him!  The Lord reveals to us our sin natures.  He doesn't take us in a darkened alley and threaten us in order to get us to love Him!<br>  <br>  The fear of God comes from a HEALTHY respect for His power and His glory.  When we SHOULD have been the most fearful of Him we weren't!  Now that we love Him, we see our sin nature and our evil and elsewhere we see descriptions of God's wrath.<br>  <br>  But let me assure you that NO ONE comes to the Lord first out of a fear of His wrath.  And no one loves the Lord only because of fear of His power.<br>  <br>  That's like saying that we can "love" a Mafia boss because he may break our legs.  Might might make right, but it doesn't make people love you!  God is not an enforcer, per se.|`|UR4mWefGaa	Even on a human level, is it not a bit immature to demand love, and be destroyed for not accepting love?|`|t8JlnuqFaa	scaring shouldn't be the way to salvation|`|AA10644435	Fear should never be apart of love.|`|8DBw6w8daa	It's not true love if you're just scared into it.

Gf5nMPJXaa	Gotta love that loving religion folks!|`|AA11923447	I'm a Christian, and want to be counted out of that 90 percent. I have dear friends who are atheists, and there are atheists who I'd trust with my life. Comments like this do nothing to bring people together, but only serve to cause division. There are many things that I personally have in common with atheists (a strong commitment to the separation of church and state, for one), and would rather look for similarities than differences. Telling atheists that they're going to burn in Hell doesn't exactly constitute a threat to them, anyway. Your statement about gleefully wanting to see people burn in Hell exposes you as morally bankrupt.

I am a Christian and I know that God loves the atheists just as much as He loves me, read the parable of the Prodigal Son and you'll know this to be true.  We do not have the authority to condemn anyone to hell and Christians are not supposed to judge the world.  We are supposed to love everyone in it and show all people the love of Christ, not tell them they're going to hell.  That will not bring people to God.|`|ZNRYqss9aa	Do you mean 'knows' or thinks?<br>  <br>  God has not been proved, meaning hell has not been proved.

If all that has been written about this comes true, Heaven's going to be rather quiet and the Other Place, one helluva party (every pun intended).<br>  <br>  Secondly, how come your right and I'm wrong?  You're in a win-win situation with this one; if you're right and there is a God, I get a trident up my jacksy and you get the 'I told you I was right' smug feeling, if I'm right and there is no God, you're fine because, well because there's nothing.<br>  <br>  In answer to your question, I really couldn't care less as I have better things to be getting on with - Yahoo!

Kind of like the one I just gave you.<br>  <br>  Four, also in reference to your 'statistic', there are three types of lies in this world. Lies, damn lies, and statistics. Statistics can say or show whatever you want them to for reasons ranging from purposeful manipulation to only sampling those in agreement with you.<br>  <br>  Five, you're an idiot. You embarrass yourself. <br>  <br>  Six, and finally, if there is a hell you'd be going right along with all the atheists for not following your own book by judging and participating in blasphemy.

Rather, most Christians have understood these descriptions to capture symbolically that hell is final and utter separation from God's saving grace. Some Christians, like C. S. Lewis, take hell to be a real place where sinful people make themselves miserable. Similarly, thinking of heaven as a place of hedonistic pleasures is wrongheaded as well. In fact, those who choose hell would not enjoy the pleasures of heaven since those pleasures essentially flow from a right relationship with God.|`|3mDvjCa8aa	I can't wait until you stop existing.

When you can prove that your god exists, I'll rot in hell willingly.  You do realize that your entire religion is based off forgiving others for their "sins" right.

They have found petrified trees on the Mediterranean Sea bed. Just about every culture has its flood myths :)<br>  <br>  I have no doubts about the  validity of a flood or a series of floods that destroyed previous civilizations. Noah, the Atlantis story, right down to native American and Australian myths, they are all basically saying the same things. <br>  <br>  A huge area of the middle east is only just above sea level, so I  can understand when the sea broke through at Gibraltar and flooded into the mediterranean sea that it would appear like the whole world being covered. But if it was to the extent in the Bible, where has all the water gone. If all the remaining ice melted it would raise the sea level some. But no where near enough to even reach the bottom of the high mountains, let alone cover them, so where has all the water gone. Its not locked up in ice or in the atmosphere that's for sure.

Rain gave rise to the oceans. Recent evidence suggests the oceans may have begun forming by 4.2 billion years ago.At the start of the Archaean eon, the Earth was already covered with oceans. The new atmosphere probably contained ammonia, methane, water vapor, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen, as well as smaller amounts of other gases. Any free oxygen would have been bound by hydrogen or minerals on the surface. Volcanic activity was intense and, without an ozone layer to hinder its entry, ultraviolet radiation flooded the surface.|`|KeOMT1g1aa	Here is the link: <a href="http://kelsocartography.com/print/maproom/images/003_WLDSATEL.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://kelsocartography.com/print/maproo...</a><br>  <br>  This earth is 2/3 covered in water.

Can you even compare it to the old days ???  <br>  <br>  In the 1770s over 90 percent of the education thrust was of an ethical , moral "ReligiouS" nature . <br>  <br>  The economy is now so low becase of people accepting bribes , selling drugs , unleagal earngs of money . UNETHICAL actions THAT LACK solid GROUND . Which is "Religion"<br>  <br>  Most Child molesters , Thieves , con-men / women . Prostitutes ..... etc .. <br>  DO you think they have a strong faith in God ? guess not !<br>  <br>  Atheists lack courage . An Atheist would not die for his country or the people he loves , wont die for a cause to believe in . Because of one thing ... "The fear of death" .<br>  A True Christian , Fears Nothing ... and He/She can scare the hell out of hell ! And Truly protect his loved ones !<br>  <br>  And if you have nothing to die for , you have nothing to live for ! Some day you will be put in true mans situation , that will require STRONG FAITH . STRONG WILL and STRONG DETERMINATION that can only be found in the King of Kings , Lord of Lords - Jesus Christ .<br>  <br>  Good luck my friend !|`|RedEGIfZaa	I am a much happier person now as an atheist than I was as a Christian.

But since everyone dies, it certainly doesn't scare me.  Possible re-incarnation; perhaps a simple transfer of energy to a disembodies form. Either way, I choose not to live my life in the fear that some deity will ultimately judge my life, and act according to his/her policies.  In my short 40 years on this planet, I have seen more grief caused by religion than good.  Every war ever fought was based, to some degree, on religious differences.   I choose to put trust in myself, and in those whom I choose to surround myself with.  I hope that people will take positive action to address problems, rather than pray, as I have yet to see proof that praying is a key problem-solver. To each their own, live and let live.|`|JTrWRUBiaa	First off, you can’t just “become” an atheist. You either believe in deities or you don’t. It’s not really a choice.<br>  <br>  Next, because atheists don’t share some all-reaching mindset, you’re going to get a wide variety of answers.<br>  <br>  Next, even if there is no comfort in being an atheist for you personally, that has no bearing on whether or not it’s correct. Neither does finding comfort in believing in Jesus. (Children find comfort in believing in Santa Claws too, but he doesn’t exist.)<br>  <br>  I’m a Theist (not an atheist), but I’m not a Christian.<br>  I take comfort in the fact that I have a good life. I love and am loved. I am thoroughly entertained by much of what life has to offer.<br>  I don’t know what happens when I die, but if there is non-existence, I welcome that too. Non-existence didn’t bother me for the billions of years I didn’t exist before I was conceived, so I suspect that it won’t bother me if it happens again ;)<br>  <br>  I hope this helped :)|`|pYomxgYfaa	I believe in people.

When you understand that this one life is all you've got, you realize that every day is precious, every moment spent with your loved ones is to be treasured.  You come to realize that since this is the only life you'll ever get, you'd best get off your behind and love, learn, and experience all you can while you have the chance to do so.<br>  <br>  That simple realization is much better than any false hope for an afterlife that will never come.  It's positive and fulfilling.  I personally don't see any need for "hope" -- I've got life.

Why do you need hope?  I get by fine with food, shelter, family, friends, and some entertainment.  Hope is just an emotion that comes and goes like every other emotion.  <br>  <br>  Those people who feel a need for hope are like drug addicts that want their next heroin fix.  It doesn't make them feel better about themselves or their life decisions after a while, but they keep coming back to get more.  <br>  <br>  Personally, much like with drugs, I avoided getting the addiction all together.  I accept that people have good times and bad times.  However, in the long run I have also found that just the simple act of setting personal goals and working toward them is plenty to keep me interested in living life.  I haven't wanted to surrender to despair and negative feelings yet, and I've done it all without any hope of salvation.<br>  <br>  The trick is to not get addicted to hope to start.  If you get the addiction, then like every other addiction, you have to detox, and then kick the habit.  The temptation to backslide is going to be strong, but can be broken with time. <br>  <br>  Personally, I think there are a lot of better reasons to choose to be a Christian than because you are hoping there will be a big payoff at the end.  That just seems greedy and self serving to me.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|4AxBMYpUaa	As the show "avatar: the last airbender" so eloquently put it, hope will not do anything for you in a tough situation, action will.

Overall, however, there are two major "sets" of deities. One set is called "Ishwar" and that set consists of only one deity -- it is the Ultimate. It is formless, unknowable, and the origin and resting place of all "things" -- physical, intellectual, spiritual, etc. including all other deities, Hindu and otherwise. <br>  <br>  The second set is the Hindu Triumvirate: Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh, along with their respective consorts. <br>  <br>  Brahma is Imagination, and His Consort is Saraswati (Order). <br>  Vishnu is Existence and His Consort is Laxmi (Growth). <br>  Mahesh is Destructive Energy and His Consort is Shakti (Creative Energy).<br>  <br>  People give a variety of names to each deity. There are even stories of a deity being "born". However, technically, a deity is imperishable. Anything that is born is perishable. Hence, a deity cannot actually be born, in a technical sense. Concepts such as "birth" and "point of origin" are entirely human weaknesses. We cannot understand the idea of existing yet never being born or having a point of origin any more than we can understand never, ever, being perishable. The idea of being supremely intelligent, totally indestructible and yet not all-powerful for hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of trillions of years is just horrifying to most people -- it is unreal. But these things are a given, in Hindu belief, and a source of comfort to billions of Hindus worldwide, over thousands of years.|`|df9YbPDpaa	Protestant and Catholic are branches of Christianity

5sMZrmqjaa	yes science and religion can go together....if it can be proved<br>  <br>  <br>  ASTRONOMY<br>  CREATION OF THE UNIVERSE: ‘THE BIG BANG’<br>  The creation of the universe is explained by astrophysicists as a widely accepted phenomenon, popularly known as ‘The Big Bang’. It is supported by observational and experimental data gathered by astronomers and astrophysicists for decades. According to ‘The Big Bang’, the whole universe was initially one big mass (Primary Nebula). Then there was a ‘Big Bang’ (Secondary Separation) which resulted in the formation of Galaxies. These then divided to form stars, planets, the sun, the moon, etc. The origin of the universe was unique and the probability of it happening by ‘chance’ is nil. The Qur’an contains the following verse regarding the origin of the universe:<br>  <br>  “Do not the Unbelievers see that the heavens and the earth were joined together (as one unit of Creation), before We clove them asunder?”<br>  [Al-Qu’ran 21:30]<br>  <br>  <br>  Scientists agree that before the galaxies in the universe were formed, celestial matter was initially in the form of gaseous matter. In short, huge gaseous matter or clouds were present before the formation of the galaxies. To describe initial celestial matter, the word ‘smoke’ is more appropriate than gas. The following Qur’anic verse refers to this state of the universe by the word dukhaan which means smoke.<br>  <br>  “Moreover, He Comprehended in His design the sky, and it had been (as) smoke: He said to it and to the earth: ‘Come ye together, willingly or unwillingly.’ They said: ‘We do come (together), in willing obedience.’”<br>  [Al-Qur’an 41:11]<br>  <br>  Again, this fact is a corollary to the ‘Big Bang’ and was not known to anyone before the prophetehood of Muhammad (Peace be upon him)1. What then, could have been the source of this knowledge?<br>  <br>  And the earth, moreover, hath He made egg shaped.”<br>  [Al-Qur’an 79:30]<br>  <br>  The Arabic word for egg here is dahaahaa1 which means an ostrich-egg. The shape of an ostrich-egg resembles the geo-spherical shape of the earth. Thus the Qur’an correctly describes the shape of the earth, though the prevalent notion when the Qur’an was revealed was that the earth was flat.<br>  <br>  motionless at the centre of the solar system with the planets revolving around it. In 1609, the German scientist Yohannus Keppler published the ‘Astronomia Nova’. In this he concluded that not only do the planets move in elliptical orbits around the sun, they also rotate upon their axes at irregular speeds. With this knowledge it became possible for European scientists to explain correctly many of the mechanisms of the solar system, including the sequence of night and day. After these discoveries, it was thought that the Sun was stationary and did not rotate about its axis like the Earth. I remember having studied this fallacy from Geography books during my school days. Consider the following Qur’anic verse:<br>  <br>  “It is He Who created the Night and the Day, and the sun and the moon: All (the celestial bodies) swim along, each in its rounded course.”<br>  [Al-Qur’an 21:33]<br>  <br>  The Arabic word used in the above verse is yasbahoon . This word is derived from the word sabaha. It carries with it the idea of motion that comes from any moving body. If you use this word for a person on the ground, it would not mean that he is rolling but would imply that he is walking orrunning. If you use this word for a person in water, it would not mean that he is floating but would imply that he is swimming. Similarly, if you use the word yasbah for a celestial body such as the sun, it would not only mean that it is flying through space but would also mean that it is rotating as it goes through space. Most school textbooks have now incorporated the fact that the sun rotates about its axis. The rotation of the sun about its own axis can be proved with the help of an equipment that projects the image of the sun on the top of a table, so that one can examine the image of the sun without being blinded. It is noticed that the sun has spots which complete a circular motion once every 25 days i.e. the sun takes approximately 25 days to rotate round its axis. The sun travels through space at roughly 240 km per second, and takes about 200 million years to complete one revolution around the centre of our Milky Way Galaxy.<br>  <br>  The light of the sun is due to a chemical process on its surface that has been taking place continuously for the past five billion years. It will come to an end at some point of time in the future, when the sun will be totally extinguished, leading to extinction of all life on earth. Regarding the impermanence of the sun’s existence, the Qur’an says:<br>  <br>  “And the Sun runs its coursefor a period determined for it; that is the decree of (Him) the exalted in Might, the All-Knowing.”<br>  [Al-Qur’an 36:38]1<br>  <br>  The Arabic word used here is mustaqarr, which means a place or time that is determined. Thus the Qur’an says that the sun runs towards a determined place, and will do so only up to a pre-determi|`|3mDvjCa8aa	Religion is a cause for tribal divisions, war, and exclusion.

Here is how it works.<br>  <br>  When a person thinks or talks about another person -- not an object, a concept or an animal, only about another human being -- their brain releases a hormone that spread throughout the world at lightspeed. While that hormone immediately bombards the brain of every other human being, it carries a special coding such that only the brain of the person who had been thought of or talked about will be affected. The immediate effect is to make the person sneeze.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Notice also that it doesn't work when the person speaking or talking about you is close by. Otherwise, we'd all be sneezing all the time when other people are around as obviously, they think of us when they see us or talk to us.<br>  <br>  It also doesn't work with famous people; something switches off when you become famous and this process stops working. Otherwise, of course, Paris Hilton would be sneezing all the time, and most famous actors could never finish a full line in a movie without sneezing.|`|aBqJhdufaa	No, sneezing comes from a nerve in your nasal cavity, like the size of a stamp I think, getting agitated and it causes you to sneeze.

Anyone who disobeys God and His messenger is a disbeliever (72:23). <br>  We have been commanded to follow the Quran alone (7:2-3; 17:46).<br>  The Quran contains everything that we need for guidance (16:89).<br>  God did not leave anything out of the Quran (6:38).<br>  Wisdom (hikmah) is in God's Quran; not necessarily in men's hadith (17:39; 36:2).<br>  Anything that is not commanded in the Quran, God left it up to our minds and intelligence to decide (5:101). <br>  The Prophet Abraham was the founder of Islam and a good example for us (22:78; 2:135; 60:4). <br>  Muhammad was the follower of Abraham (3:68; 16:123). <br>  All religious practices; daily prayers, obligatory charity, fasting, and pilgrimage come through Abraham (21:73; 2:43,127-128; 2:183; 3:43; 19:31-59; 20:14).<br>  We should not follow any hadith besides the Quran as the source of God's religion (45:6).<br>  There are those who use vain hadith to mislead people, without knowledge (31:6).<br>  We do not need fabricated hadith, because the Quran is fully detailed (12:111).<br>  The best hadith is the Quran (39:23).<br>  The only sunnah (law) is God's sunnah (33:38,62; 35:43).<br>  Those who decree religious laws never authorized by God, and their followers, are idol worshipers (42:21).<br>  The Quran is fully detailed, not vague (30:28; 41:3).<br>  Quran has been explained and detailed by God Himself (11:1; 75:19).<br>  God is the teacher of the Quran (55:1).<br>  The Quran is easy to understand for believers; while it is impossible for idol worshipers (54:17,22,32,40; 17:46; 18:57).<br>  The Prophet Muhammad, as a good example, did not accept and follow any other source besides the Quran (5:48-49; 6:114; 10:15).<br>  God guaranteed the preservation of the Quran, not the hadith (15:9; 36:69; 38:87; 41:42; 43:4; 56:78).<br>  God's word is perfect (6:115). Those who follow conjecture are diverted (6:112).<br>  God does not forget (19:64).<br>  God does not run out of words (18:109).<br>  Those who are not certain about the hereafter, are not satisfied with the Quran, they want to amend it with other books (10:15).<br>  Those who divide their religion into sects are not followers of Muhammad (6:159).<br>  The complaint of the messenger in the hereafter will be about the desertion of the Quran, not hadith (25:30).<br>  <br>  <br>  The same mistake <br>  The Jews had received the Torah which was complete and fully detailed like the Quran (6:154; 7:145). However, they were not satisfied with the word of God, and asked irrelevant questions. When they could not find answers to their petty questions, they started to invent. This satanic attitude led them to produce Mishnah (oral) and Gemarah (traditions).|`|FhXzlnDOaa	That part of the quran is obviously a mistake, even though it's a "miracle" and the word of allah.|`|H8WqMK1eaa	Because Islam is not just about Allah.<br>  <br>  It revolves around the "Sunnah" of the Prophet Muhammad.<br>  <br>  If Islam was merely submission to God, people would simply have faith that God would guide each one of them individually (via the conscience.)<br>  <br>  However, Allah doesn't work like that.  Allah requires that people emulate the Prophet...that is the only sure-fire way to get to heaven.  Heaven is earned by a sort-of point system.  Good deeds give you points and bad deeds take them away. <br>  <br>  Negative points means hell.  Positive points means heaven.<br>  <br>  To truly know what good and bad deeds are, a person must follow the Quran and Hadiths.  (Our innate moral compasses are obviously not good enough.  Allah made us a bit defective like that.)|`|h3gMzNS3aa	The quran explains that you need the sunnah.<br>  <br>  I can give you a dictionary that has all the needs you need to know. However in order to know how to use the words in the dictionary, you'll need a grammar and writing lesson book to know how to use them. The dictionary itself doesn't explain how you're meant to use the words.<br>  <br>  Therefore is no contradiction.|`|5vA7kkeyaa	An excepted sales technique to overcome objection is to offer a less offensive alternative so you really can not say no just yes to something less. (weak and strong hadith) if it is wrong why do any of you allow it? Since most will not try to understand the Koran it is easy to say "if it contradicts the Koran we don't follow it" but you do follow it because you do not follow what is in the Koran. If you read the Koran in a language you understand with a clear mind and clean heart you will not foolishly defend alternate scriptures to the koran.|`|Jc8rbyHXaa	Good question.<br>  The Hadiths contains commands that are never stated in the Quran.  he Hadiths goes back to traditional arabic laws long before Mohammad's time.<br>  I think Mohammad tried to rid his religion of many Traditional influence; the Hadiths does the opposite.|`|bPN9cTKqaa	As xXtiffan said, it is because certain details of living Islamically are not included in the Qur'an, such as the manner of praying. Now, while many Muslims take the "strong" hadith as being infallible, we must be careful with this, as many of the hadith were compiled/written down more than a century after the death of Muhammad. And: no matter how stringent the requirements of Al-Bukhari, Muslim, etc this is a human art and naturally susceptible to fallibility unlike the Qur'an which is believed by Muslims to be the word of God. The best way to verify the validity of a hadith? Use reasoning and refer back to the Qur'an. If there is a hadith that contradicts the Qur'an, then it is obviously not true. An example would be "Women are imperfect in intellect and religion". This hadith is nullified by the verse 33:35 in the Qur'an that states "The believing men and the believing women, the righteous men and the righteous women, the pious men and the pious women . . . For them there is a reward in heaven." So according to this verse, men and women are equally capable of being religious. There is a reward in heaven for both sexes. <br>  <br>  So the hadith can be useful, as long as we approach them intelligently, with reason. <br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|AA10375065	My dear friend if you don't understand some thing about Islam, Quran or Hadith you should consult muslims before a nasty jump!  <br>  <br>  Allah says in Quran: "We have made Quran easy for believers"... also says: "Obey Allah and Obey the Messenger..."<br>  <br>  You are not a believer therefore you could not follow the Verse " And we have sent down to thee the book explaining all things". <br>  <br>  Sent down to thee - means to Muhammad! Hence if you want to understand the Book you have to rely on Muhammad (pbuh). Therefore the Companions ( May Allah be pleased with them ) used to ask every thing directly from the prophet of Allah to follow the commandments.<br>   <br>  Accordingly we Muslims consult Hadith to follow the Word of God! <br>  <br>  Hope you understand as to why Hadith is necessary!|`|jHWEEZmCaa	sunna, may god curse it, do contradict qoran. some sunnis scholars said in feqh books that hadith can delete a statement in qoran. eg. qoran say that dead animal and blood are forbidden, hadith says that dead locust and fish, and bloody leathers and spleen are allowed. sunna is satanic.|`|ahAOjZ9Vaa	some things aren't in the quran for example sunnah prayers e.t.c therefore we must turn to hadiths which are what the prophet said, did or what he prevented people from doing.|`|qfTYgO9kaa	Hello<br>  <br>  The word in question here is ?? ??? which means everything but should not be understood to mean absolutely everything but rather those things that pertain to the spiritual needs of man. In other words, the fundamental principles which are necessary for the moral and spiritual development. If it were to mean absolutely everything then we would see that this verse doesn't make as much sense as if you look at it the Holy Quran doesn't talk about soccer or politics and etc.<br>  <br>  The Ahadith don't contain anything that "tops" the Holy Quran, if you will. There is nothing that contradicts the Holy Quran (this is a way of testing whether a hadith is accurate or not in addition to the other methods). Whatever the Holy Prophet Mohammad (saw) had said in explaining the Holy Quran falls into line with the Quranic teachings since as per the Holy Quran  the Holy Prophet (saw) was received knowledge from the same source (53:3)<br>  <br>  I hope II've in some way answered your question.<br>  <br>  PS. I would request people not to get "offended" over a question. After all you can't lean without asking a question.
9220e99cf581203dda5db0c56616ac40aa	since you're being so vague i'll give you the full answer lol<br>  <br>  Physically<br>  When they're hot they're hot, but alot of them are overweight and think they're hot anyway.  i think they look exotic (and i grew up with them, though i'm asian) but sometimes they have big noses or mustaches.  Obviously they have a nice booty, and I've never had sex with a Hispanic girl but I heard they're pretty good lol<br>  I'll briefly describe the guys too even though I'm not bi.  Their looks vary immensely, from fat to buff to skinny, from short to average height (rarely over 6 feet i think).  They have so many different styles that it's hard to generalize.<br>  <br>  Mentally<br>  lol no offense, most Hispanics I met are pretty dumb.  There are smart Hispanics, but most of them make it seem like they aren't that smart.<br>  <br>  Socially<br>  I think they're very social people.  Some "gangsta" guys might be mean to people that they aren't close with, and some hood-rat girls might start screaming at the top of their lungs and playing with their cameltoe in public.  But as I said before, when Hispanic girls are sexy they're sexy.  <br>  <br>  Cool?|`|DV8AIpjFaa	Why are you bothering asking these ignorant people?<br>  You guys have culture, a culture that these assholes dont appreciate and don't understand.

How can you generalize an entire group of people? Even within different nationalities there are several cultural differences. Not everyone from Mexico is the same. Not everyone from Puerto Rico is the same. Seriously, that is like assuming all white people are the same, regardless of whether they are French, English, American, or whatever! For those of you who stating that you don't like Mexicans or don't like South Americans (this is silly because you are generalizing an entire continent) or don't like Chicanos really need to pull your heads out of wherever they are stuck and get yourselves educated. There are great Hispanic people and there are those who I wouldn't spit on if they were on fire, just the same as people of any other race. People need to be judged on an individual basis and not on the actions of others who happen to share the same skin color or country of origin.

Winning Bingo or the lottery is just what it claims to be--luck, odds, statistics, chance, whatever you want to call it.  I feel that God largely has a "hands off" policy.  He's not up there controlling us like marionettes.  I believe we are here to be tried, tested, and to ultimately choose our own destiny.

At first they refused, pointing out to her that he hadn't said a word about her that wasn't true, but when she threatened to blight the crops, they sent the Bull of Heaven to ravish his kingdom.  When he and Enkidu killed it, the gods then reasoned that the.two of them had done an impious thing (never mind that it was in self-defense) and agreed to let one of them fall sick and die.  Since Gilgamesh was part divine himself (although mortal), they settled on Enkidu as the one to die.

In any case, Paul explains it in the New Testament, I think in Romans or Hebrews im not sure but he explains how he wants his suffering to end and just be with the Father in Heaven or something along those lines but he realizes the goal isn't to "feel better" or for selfish ambitions but to spread the Gospel of Jesus dying so that people can have everlasting life with God in Heaven. It's a matter of telling other people about Jesus and doing it even when life sucks and people are mean. Religion and practices have seeped into so much of the way that Christians are practicing their faith that they forget that it's all about love. I am Christian and I saw some of the answers saying like " i wish" to your question etc and im like ouch but thats so selfish of me if I get mad at them or anything because I am making it about me.

Like for one week it feels like you have a atomic fire ball on your tongue and you can't take it out.   I have my labre pierced. I would not recommend that one for your first peircing. Kinda scary when a guy comes toward your mouth with a big needle.  I think that getting the fat of your lip pierced is so sexy.  I dont have that one so I can't tell you how it feels or anything like that.  Eyebrows are ok but take forever to heal.  Also your body can reject it.  I'm not talking about infection Im talking the ring being push through your skin.  Noses are ok too but I keep thinking about if you get a cold. lol  The main things with piercings is keep them clean, dont take them out or change them until the time is up (cause you can't get them back in and you will waste the $40 +), and play with them alot cause the more you play pull and stretch them the better.|`|AA10148408	Belly button.<br>  <br>  It's sexy, plus you can cover it for work.

DOQ4bZQuaa	Civil disobedience: Breaking an unjust law. <br>  <br>  Just because something is law does not make it right. Laws are man-made attempts at higher law, morality. The purpose of law is to protect society from those who would violate morality. When laws are made that are themselves immoral (legal slavery, legal rape, abortion, arbitrary killing etc.) it is the duty of the rational individual to break those laws; and to move that those laws be changed. <br>  <br>  Often people hide behind the law; they say that their duty to the law is greater than any duty to morality. Essentially they believe that it is moral to obey and uphold the law at the expense of "other morals". An example of this is "catholic" politicians who believe it is more right to obey the constitution and allow abortions, than it is to uphold the basic moral principle of protecting the innocent. <br>  <br>  What is law is not always what is right. What is right, is right regardless of the law.|`|Fdo2G5BZaa	EXCEPT... if they are against The Word and Will of God for man-kind... BUT... The Word and Will of God may NOT be imposed upon any one...

Hence, you are responsible for both the formation of the laws and abiding by the laws.<br>  <br>  If you allow bad laws to form, you are responsible.

Also, we need to re-connect with nature, which would mean re-learning our basic survival skills in how to survive in with it instead of exploiting it for materialistic comforts. When this has been done, we would need to get rid of governments who thin they know best because they enforce their way of life, just as religions do, onto the public. We need to escape the monopoly of "work, eat, sleep, die" in order to find true meaning in our lives and we cannot do this when we feel we are trapped in our own lives.

There is no precedent for believers who lose their faith becoming so.  Ergo, we must assume there is neither a real nor a rationally defensible link between religion and morality and that those who can't manage their lives would simply find another crutch if they became atheistic.  However I have no desire to force that to happen.|`|rGEZup0Zaa	I actually don't believe that religion should be abolished, but this line of argument is weak.<br>  <br>  That's like saying alcohol should be illegal because some people just can't refrain from abusing it. We don't run our society like that. For the same reason, we shouldn't let religion get a pass just because "some people" can't make their own decisions.|`|n7bok7NRaa	The episode of South Park where Cartman accidentally manages to get religion abolished basically describes what would happen in my opinion.<br>  <br>  For the first few decades it would be great, but then people would start laying down laws about how to be a "good atheist" and there would be wars fought and won over atheology.<br>  <br>  Why? Because some people love to control others, and without religion, someone would just come up with another concept to guilt people into serving a false ideal.|`|RermzbWgaa	While I would be completely opposed to such legislation or goals.....<br>  How would one abolish religion?  Simply passing a law is not going to get rid of anything.  Such would require force, and is sure to be met with force in opposition (at least in the United States).<br>  <br>  It would result in hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of people dead (on both sides of said issue).....and if such were done right now at least....would likely result in the religious folks winning (accomplishing exactly the opposite result from the desired goal).|`|G9dZN8omaa	I know someone like that. <br>  <br>  And neither religion nor the military helped.<br>  <br>  I think that person will simply have to hit rock bottom to realize that if they don't take control of their lives, they won't really have one.|`|XuO2rTteaa	Most of the time the fact that they were raised in that religion was the cause of their inability to run their lives. They've been told they have no control, and they believe it.|`|NWopkX4baa	I agree, some people need religion.

AA10034051	Having been enlightened by an angel in a dream regarding her pregnancy, and perhaps further by Mary concerning the words of the archangel Gabriel to her at the Annunciation, Joseph knew that God had conducted himself as a husband in regard to Mary. She was now prohibited to him for all time, and for the sake of the Child and Mary he could only live with her in an absolutely chaste relationship.<br>  Joseph as celibate caretaker<br>  <br>  As the recipient of the great revelation that what was conceived in the womb of Mary, his betrothed, was of the Holy Spirit and that the Child to be born was destined to save His people from their sins, surely Joseph knew that he was called to take care of Mary and her Child, the Messiah, for the rest of his life, which is why the angel told him to take Mary as his wife. <br>  <br>  We may reasonable assume that Mary herself now shared with him all that the archangel Gabriel said to her. No less a Person than "the Son of God" (Lk 1:35) was to be entrusted to his care under the shelter of his humble home, now become the Holy of Holies.|`|jdRKZe18aa	I think he learned that truly with God, nothing is impossible and he learned that he is nothing without his faith in God as well.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	I have no idea...How would I know anything like that.|`|7c73d357ee89c177275de5c2d1c35fd2aa	He learned that if he lied about god impregnating Mary instead of him, they would get away with it.|`|p6wwiQG3aa	He learned that His soon to be wife would be the mother of God.<br>  <br>  <br>  Not sure what you are asking.|`|J8uhpecYaa	That Christ is actually a bastard child?|`|gdYN39gtaa	I'm appalled at most of these answers to your question.  Why do<br>    all the unbelievers go to religion category if they don't believe to<br>    begin with? God was sacred to people fifty and a hundred years<br>    ago and they would never say things like I see above. I believe in<br>    God, Jesus and the Holy Spirit and it saddens me to see such<br>    fun-making of our Savior. I bet they don't know of a single other<br>    person who arose from the dead. Hundreds of people in the area<br>    witnessed Jesus alive three days after his death. I'm afraid a lot<br>    of people will be sorry at judgment day when they see there is <br>    just two choices and they've chosen the wrong one. Enjoy life<br>    now as your afterlife will surely be a "torment".|`|vAbATcTcaa	he learned to put away all his fears about his chaste and sweet Mary and he learned that she conceived a son from the overshadowing of the holy spirit and that Mary is very special indeed to have been chosen to be the mother of God and he felt very humble at having been the one to thrived to mary and that he would be the foster father.|`|AUsvrW8faa	When the angel came and told him to continue with the wedding plans and gave him the name they were to call the child, he learned that he too was chosen.|`|NWopkX4baa	They probably agreed on the story so they wouldn't get in trouble for their premarital romp.|`|AGKOaVEkaa	He was also told by an angel|`|KmULmT7Baa	Keep an eye on god next time he leaves for work.|`|DZCFD0p2aa	that she'd probably been mucking about before he was to be married to her.|`|t8JlnuqFaa	to be self-less|`|68lLAQnKaa	Well first off Joseph had an encounter with an angel, that in itself displays the power of God so he learned of His power, he learned faith and total reliance on God, he learned patience, humility, he learned what it is like to be called and chosen, he learned what it is like to be an earthly father to the Son of God, he learned privilege, he learned alot!!|`|XoUfUl6Yaa	Never marry a virgin.
d0600880a83eef4da79264e4dc7c8f12aa	Suppose a perfect child was placed in your care and you were expected to rear him properly. What a challenge! How could any imperfect human do so? Only by accepting divine direction and applying it in everyday life.<br>  <br>  That very thing was done by Joseph, the adoptive father of Jesus, God's own Son. In contrast with detailed apocryphal lore about Joseph, the Bible says little concerning his humble role in Jesus’ early life. We know that Joseph and his wife, Mary, reared Jesus, four other sons, and daughters too.—Mark 6:3.<br>  <br>  Joseph was a descendant of Israel’s King David through the line of Solomon. He was the son of Jacob and the son-in-law of Heli. (Matthew 1:16; Luke 3:23) As a carpenter in the city of Nazareth in Galilee, Joseph had limited financial resources. (Matthew 13:55; Luke 2:4,?24; compare Leviticus 12:8.) But he was rich spiritually. (Proverbs 10:22) This certainly was because he accepted divine direction.<br>  <br>  Without doubt, Joseph was a meek and humble Jew who had faith in God and desired to do what was right. The few incidents of his life recorded in the Scriptures show that he was ever obedient to God’s commands. This was so whether these were contained in the Law or were directly received by Joseph through angels.

Have you tried to get help?|`|r3vW3zU1aa	there are such things as demons, but they don't cause things like this, when a demon possesses you, you have complete control over what you do, and what you hear. And you don't hear voices, no do they tell you bad things to do. Demons also don't affect your dreams. but when angels possess you, you lose all control of dreams, you tend to feel like you are being shocked with mass amounts of electricity, you can have seizures, amongst lots of other things. but what I think this is, is a malicious spirit that's located somewhere close to your physical location. Try finding out the history of your area, see if anything happened to anyone like a murder or and accident, then try and find out why. One thing that could help you is if you go get some bergamot oil, make sure its authentic not synthetic, and burn it in an oil diffuser. It should make you feel better, especially at night.

764563e236641925edbeefe032c813b3aa	It is possible to have a wife and kids and still be attracted to men.<br>  <br>  My husband, although isn't attraced to men, is sexually bisexual and we have two kids. I'm sexually bi too. I don't fear that he'll one day leave me or will cheat on me with a guy. From the very first real conversation we had, he told me that he likes having sex with guys and how many times he had ever been with a guy and his fantasies regarding guys. So, I know him, I trust him, and therefore have no issues with him being bi. <br>  <br>  You can have the life you want as long as you're honest. It's the secrecry regarding homosexuality that women fear. You can have children and be a great dad. You can have a wife and be a great husband.

zdu3gh8jaa	Hi Becki<br>  <br>  I believe you are not hearing things. The reason why I believe is because of the experiences I have had over the last 25 years or so. It does sound like you may have for whatever reason attracted a young spirit child. <br>  Can you think of any other reason why you should hear the noises or give you the impression/hallucination that you experienced? I am asking this so as to rule out things before you completely rule in spirit, even if it does sound the most likely reason.<br>  You have been given some good advice with regards helping this spirit move on. What I would say though is that you do not have to wait to see the child to do this. You can just ask that his mum's spirit and his spirit guardians and guides come close to him and take him back through the Light to his family. After doing this, you may sense a change in the environment of your home. It won't feel bad in any way but it should feel lighter. Smudge around your home with some white sage, go into every room and ask that any other spirits be taken to the light. Do this every few weeks/or every month just to keep the energy balanced and protected. I warn you though, many find the smell of the sage quite pungent when they first use it. Open a window in each room or an outside door if there is no window. This allows any unwanted energy to flow away.<br>  Please try not to be scared I know it is hard especially when you have never experienced anything like it before.  It would not surprise me if you don't actually 'see' the little one again although you may still experience evidence that he is still around your home. It is likely that your fear will block the spirit from manifesting fully.<br>  I do wish you good luck and hope that this helps in some way.|`|01NUrwfYaa	Your schizophrenic.|`|tnV6CJxyaa	I personally do believe in ghosts.<br>  It might be a child ghost that used to live in the house before you moved in and died there.<br>  Maybe his mother left him, or moved onto the after life and left him behind, the ghost might have taken you to be its mother or you may remind him of his mother.<br>  And he's saying he loves you I suggest you get that house blessed and send that spirit to the afterlife.<br>  Try splashing holy water around the house?|`|fMiLQnSJaa	I think it's a ghost.  Keep a journal of all the things that happen and find someone who does paranormal investigations.|`|SK5wHr5zaa	It is your conscience trying to tell you that you are over eating.|`|vn16f38naa	arg. ignore other people telling you your "schizophrenic" or whatever. Obviously, atleast what it sounds like, is that there is a young child's spirit roaming around your house, not knowing what's going on. Most young spirits are the most found spirits in "haunted" homes. But this is isn't a haunting. The spirit is reaching out for your help, because it's trapped. Next time this happens, even if it scares the living crap out of you, even if you don't SEE it, say something like "Hello...?" and if nothing was to happen, just say "I mean no harm, I'm not afraid. Do you need help finding your (in this case) mommy?" <br>  Talk to it like its a little child, and it might reappear. If not, just say that when it's ready to reveal itself again, that you will be happy to help. If it were to reappear, just try to be comforting, it is just as afraid as you are. Was there possibly a young death of that particular child in the house you are living in? Check, check check! Then help it out. However you can, HELP IT OUT.<br>  Although this seems unnatural (which to most people it is especially if they're the type to think that everything can be scientifically proven, and that there is a logical answer for everything), the faster you approach the spirit, the faster it will stop frightening you.<br>  Do not be afraid, just notice that everything is can not be explained.|`|Rd1FLoCbaa	youre as crazy as my step-mother <br>  edit- sammi that is the craziest thing iv ever heard of

Currently, most public schools only allow atheistic views to be presented.   <br>  I think free speech should be allowed.

There is a reason that the 2nd amendment follows the first amendment.|`|dFBccLExaa	I think that it's okay to wear things that show your religion, but I don't think it should be a part of the cirriculum.

This ring might well have been formerly owned by some magickian who "charged it up" for just that purpose: to be able to see spirits. Gemstones are crystalline substances, and crystalline substances hold charges of 'astral force' very well, hence the New Age fascination with rock crystals as "amulets'. There is a story about a gemstone being used for nefarious purposes ("The Scented Poppies") in the book "The Secrets of Dr. Taverner", by Dion Fortune. Dion Fortune was herself a magickal adept, and the stories are based on actual true encounters with occult forces.<br>  <br>    However, owning such a ring is not necessarily a GOOD thing; unless one knows exactly what they are about. Amateurish tinkerings with occult tools can lead to mental unbalance, hauntings, and spirit possession, and these conditions are not easily dealt with.

AA11969509	The basic problem is that the folks are experts at harassing you and making it hard to prove in court.  They are also likely to use proxies to harass you.  For instance if a low level member punches you, you are going to have a hard time locating him to prosecute him.  The police don't try as hard as you might think to find people.  If you do find him, it will be hard to prove that higher ups ordered it.  He is likely to get a suspended sentence at best.  You can sue him in civil court, but he may have no assets to take.  You can't sue the church because you can't prove they ordered it.|`|A01w1dHqaa	This was a policy put in 30 years ago. You would have to have inside information to know if it was still active.|`|mOTCr8Pxaa	Scientology corp. policy is if someone gets on that policy that that person must be completely and utterley destroyed in every way which mean their work, relationship, and their community standing and in some cases even murdered. There have been reports of people who were going to testify in court or bring out info against the corp. and then wind up dead. Lokk it up. Scientology has killed before and they will do it again.<br>  <br>  Edit: Sceintology corp. has a very good legal team. One of the best in the country. It is very difficult to bring them to court for these charges as they have millions to throw in legal action. And sometimes witnesses who were supposed to take the stand end up dead.|`|hXQnR2Scaa	Unless you represent what they consider to be a real threat, you are unlikely to be declared "Fair Game".<br>  But if you are, then any attack - no matter how despicable - might end up being used against you.<br>  <br>  And yes.

Ron Hubbard, creator of Scientology<br>  <br>  In an American fashion, they now use lawyers instead of brute force.|`|m82mu7eKaa	I see lots of anger here in some of these answers - or is it prejudice? I have worked around Scientology for decades and all through the period called "fair game".<br>   <br>  The actual policy was canceled because it was misrepresented, just as it is in some of these posts. But it had to with the question that as a new religion, how do you keep your people happy with each other? Every religion has the duty to address issues of morality and ethics with their members, and Scientology is no exception. No one claims to be perfect, and when one Scientologist felt wronged by another, there was a kind of church court one could go to. This function was open to all except those whose harmful acts were found to be so many and so destructive that they were actually kicked out of the church. Until coming back into good standing by cleaning up their acts, they were no longer able to use the Church as a recourse for any bad acts against them. The policy was, basically, "if you continually attack the Church or its members, don't ask us to protect you." If that policy were abused to any other use, even today, in any Church, redress is still available. If someone makes it out to be something else, realize you are being fed a line and ask what the grievance really is. <br>  <br>  The first policy of Scientology, laid down in 1950, is, "Maintain friendly relations with the environment and the public". Have you experienced an exception to that?

cR8UZdi1aa	Not everyone hates JW's. <br>  But you're right, many don't know about us or the truth about us. But remember, Jesus himself said that the world hated him & it would hate his followers too.<br>  John 15:17-23 "“These things I command YOU, that YOU love one another. If the world hates YOU, YOU know that it has hated me before it hated YOU. If YOU were part of the world, the world would be fond of what is its own. Now because YOU are no part of the world, but I have chosen YOU out of the world, on this account the world hates YOU. Bear in mind the word I said to YOU, A slave is not greater than his master. If they have persecuted me, they will persecute YOU also; if they have observed my word, they will observe YOURS also. But they will do all these things against YOU on account of my name, because they do not know him that sent me. If I had not come and spoken to them, they would have no sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin. He that hates me hates also my Father."<br>  <br>  Matthew 5: 11,12 “Happy are YOU when people reproach YOU and persecute YOU and lyingly say every sort of wicked thing against YOU for my sake. Rejoice and leap for joy, since YOUR reward is great in the heavens; for in that way they persecuted the prophets prior to YOU."<br>  <br>  You have 7 million brothers & sisters who love you.|`|TLLklriUaa	I do not hate Jehovah Witnesses. I do think though if you are going to ignore the "eating blood" verse when you want a hamburger (which will still have blood in it even after being "cleaned") but cling to it as justification for refusing life saving medical treatment for your child then you need to have your head examined... and  have your children put into protective custody by the state.|`|AA11923447	From your own comment: "...and i know its the truth..."<br>  <br>  It's the truth to you. My religion is the truth to me, but it's not the truth to everyone. If I went around saying that my religion was the only one, and that it was the only source of truth, I would justifiably be considered arrogant. However, having said that, I have JW friends, and have no problem with people believing whatever they wish. I do have a problem with people showing up unannounced at my home with their "truth". Pretty much every conversation I've had with a JW ends up with my religion eventually being denigrated. I don't go to the homes of random JWs trying to hustle my religious beliefs, so why do they come to mine?|`|eAMq1iBWaa	A wee bit of an imagination here I think|`|8j7FCEOraa	I work at a preschool.

But is their teaching that is being opposed.They teach from what they are told to from the Watchtower and not from the Bible.  Second, as a witness you should know that having a title is against the scriptures. Titles evaluate oneself over another and in God's eyes we are them same. <br>  It sounds like your family loves you and fear that you have strayed from God. Which you have. They just want to back. Just listen to your family.|`|kyTDQEWaaa	because its cult-like|`|eb9401df5c8ac4cc865dd2eadfe7e0acaa	I have nothing against Jehovah Witnesses as far as there belief or anything like that. However just like most other people I hate junk mail, telemarketers, and uninvited people coming to my house trying to sell me something (except kids doing fundraisers) or trying to get me to do something that I just do not want to do.  I am a 3rd shifter and when I am at home that is my time to relax and I do not want any of that.  When someone  knocks on my door and wakes me up yeah I am not going to be happy to see that it is a Jehovah Witness.  I am a Christan I go to my own Church. Our church does not go and wake people up trying to get them to come to our church.  That does not mean we don't witness to people but we don't go and wake people up to do it.  So that is why I feel most people don't like them.<br>  That being said, The ones who do wake me up from my much needed sleep there is a place for them.  Jeff Dunham's Walter said it best.  For the war on terror we could send a bunch of Jehovah Witnesses over there early in the morning to bang on there tents just to piss them off.

You sure opened a can of worms.  <br>  <br>  I grew up in the truth in the 60's in California and it was a real protection for me from everything the world was going through.  It was a scary time, so there was a special urgency among some of the friends.  The thought was that if your neighbor's house was on fire a caring person would desperately try to get them out, right?  And the Bible truths we came to share could save their lives.  Some of the friends got too pushy, and of course that put people off.  Some still do, unfortunately.<br>  <br>  I decided even at 9 yrs old that I didn't care to "cast pearls before swine" so even though I knew more about the Bible than most adults to whom I spoke, I respectfully let them reject me door after door.  I knew Jehovah read their hearts and they'd find the truth if he drew them.  Besides, the road leading to death is the broad one with the majority of people on it.  Can we force a goat onto the narrow path by arguing at their door?  No.<br>  <br>  Actually we should be happy about people being so hateful toward us.  It's an indentifying mark of the true faith.  There are some kind people who answered you and said "hey, I don't hate JW"s, they just annoy me" that's fine.  We're still glorifying Jah's name even if they don't listen.<br>  <br>  But look at how many people on these sites spew out poison against Jehovah's Witnesses.  Satan hates us, they are just his mouthpieces.  Isn't that cool?  I love thumbing my nose at Satan.  Even perfect Adam and Eve couldn't maintain integrity but we imperfect humans have a chance due to Jesus' ransom.  How amazing.  I hope your family will listen some day.  Stay strong, little sparrow.|`|865bVfl3aa	Jesus told us that we would be persecuted just like he was persecuted. We are Jehovah's people living in Satan's world and dealing with people who are bombarded with Satan's messages of false religion, patriotism, immorality, materialism, etc... in their churches, through their television and pretty much everywhere else they turn. <br>  My family basically hates me for becoming one of Jehovah's Witnesses despite not being able to provide a valid reason. Don't let the hatred get you down. Go forth and tell the good news. If anyone doesn't want to listen then shake the dust off your feet and tell the next person<br>  <br>  To the preschool teacher:<br>  While it sounds like the parents in your case may being a bit hard on their 4 year old you are missing the point as well. Witness parents (most of us at least, all religions have their oddballs) want our children to have a very happy childhood. We just don't want them getting involved in pagan activities while doing so. Why do schools still insist on spending "education" time on pagan celebrations? I don't care if you choose to involve your children in those activities. You are an adult (and presumably a smart one) and have been given by God the right to make decisions about your child's activities. Why can't you give me the same tolerance to make those decisions for my child? Of course, that is one of the many reasons I will not be sending my child to public school|`|ce060a29a8e7cbb3f7cdc004ec90adc3aa	Jenna, we don't hate Witnesses. We DO hate people showing up at our doors thrusting Watchtowers at us and making attempts to persuade us to abandon our own faith in favor of yours. You seem to know exactly when it is the most inconvenient time to arrive at our homes and you do not seem to be able to take "No thank you" for an answer. After more than 58 years of living in this world, I know what you want, where you are located, and when you'll be there. If I want to join you I am sure that I can find my way to the local Kingdom Hall, after all, it IS the third largest building in town right behind the courthouse and the jail. I think I can find it if I decide that I need you. I have read the Bible many times, cover to cover, including all of the commentaries. I have probably read it as much as YOU have. If it hasn't served to attract me, what makes you think that your 4 page Watch Tower is going to convince me any better? <br>  <br>  No it is NOT you that we hate, it's your methods of recruitment that we despise and mock many many trimes over. <br>  <br>  Brightest Blessings,<br>  Raji the Green Witch|`|Gf5nMPJXaa	It's more pity than hate usually trust me.

I hate the religion because it is pure ignorance. And, I hate even more being told that I have to respect other people's irrationalism simply because it is a "religious belief." Ignorance, illogic and irrationalism are still just that, and it doesn't become respectable simply because it is called "religion."|`|oORt62lYaa	Hi there! well i am one of Jehovah witnesses and i am glad you know its the truth.  Jehovah is so proud of you!  well i notice when i go out in service people say " i have my own religion " and they think we are wrong because we don't do holidays or vote. or when they here the title "Jehovah wittiness "  they think oh great its the people who knock at every ones door. but i believe if they just listen to gods word the bible then they can really see that this is the truth that Jehovah wants everyone to know.  just prey to Jehovah that when you go out in service the angels will guide you to someone who will listen and love the truth. hope i helped! all our love from your brothers and sisters.|`|ch8DC4z7aa	Because they try to push their religion onto other people so forcefully and as a Christian   myself I think it makes non believers annoyed and less likely to want to convert, I know it says we should spread the word of God but knocking on peoples doors at insane times of the day and forcing them to listen to you patronizingly say 'do you know God loves you?'' whilst you can feel the cold coming into your house when it's  freezing outside is  extremely annoying. There are other ways to spread the word of God .............<br>  <br>  Also the 'I don't celebrate birthdays or christmases' makes them seem like a real bore. Just loosen up a bit and get off you're high horse.

Your religion is a cult and that's quite simply dangerous and indefensible scripturally.  It sickens Christians when people twist scripture for their own purposes.  <br>  <br>  Martin Luther figured out that Catholicism had gone astray SIMPLY by comparing Catholic teaching to Bible scripture.

I personally hate fighting and always go away from the scene and it really isn't a good example to fight in front of your children. If parent's do that then sometimes children don't get much attached to their parents.|`|U5zcbHuZaa	As a child I witnessed the type of argument and fighting among parents that was not good. I watched as my mom fought against mistreatment and disrespect and abuse in her own home. The most intense fights frightened me greatly as a child, but I did learn valuable things from witnessing them. I learned how not to do a marriage, that's for sure.<br>  <br>  My child has witnessed conflict between me and her other far more wayward parent (relationship over many years ago). But she has also witnessed us not giving up trying to be friends for her sake and she has witnessed arguments that are not fights, but merely discussion that the two people work out before the conversation is over.<br>  <br>  The first type of conflict talked about above is unfortunate reality of life. As my mom demonstrated and taught me, I have demonstrated and taught my kid to hold her ground and not be walked on, as painful as it may be sometimes to do that, even if it includes ending the relationship and cutting the other person entirely out of your life (doing this for temporary periods, a few months banishment here and there, can help too). The second type is a happier reality to know that not all conflicts and disagreements have to be so harsh and to look for a person who no matter what conflicts or disagreements they have, they can talk it out to work it out.<br>  <br>  Hey, there are wars and people blowing up things all over the world, and people taking guns to the shopping malls, work, churches, and schools. I don't think it does us much good to teach our children to not deal with conflict, we don't need anger suppressed and building up in people until they explode in a bloody rampage. Too often we try to suppress conflicts and bury the issues (usually some type of injustice, large or small, or a big long string of them) and expect people to not be upset about it. Doesn't work that way, it is more likely they will become more upset at the increased injustice of being asked to accept whatever the first injustice was and to shut up about it. We need to go ahead and have our arguments and work out our differences instead, this is much better than suppressing anger to enduce passive agressiveness and sudden explosive bloody rampages. It is also much better than letting injustice reign.|`|a8c3721d218891d4a3fb70f51dc29b23aa	yes my parents did fight in front of me a lot of times but they don't anymore..the first time i was like 5 or something so i just started to cry..but then later i was like 9 so i prayed to allah and asked them to stop fighting. and i guess they never fought after that.|`|sna0p2djaa	Yeah, my parents, when they fight, they do fight infront of us cuz we aren't confined to our rooms, involved in our own lives... we pay attention to our family and care for them :P<br>  <br>  Well, whenever i see my parents fight.. even if it's a stupid issue.. i just wish they would stop... :(<br>  <br>  I don't say anything to them cuz i know they'll blow at me..which will make me angry and make me wanna cry :(|`|4oQyDdvdaa	my parents dont fight and my friend ( a thearpist) said that if they dont argue every once in a while that means they r leaving all there emotions inside and that their marriage is based on a lie|`|KqiiT1WSaa	nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo...<br>  <br>  YO SCHIZO HOPE, WAZGUD HAS NOT ANSWERED YOUR QUESTION YET<br>  <br>  HAHAHHAHAAAAAAAAAAAAAA|`|6LBJgACSaa	ya many times I've seen my parents fight.

Faith promotes one of the most unfortunate bad habits of human beings:  wishful thinking.  I believe that if mankind had taken the route of logic and pragmatism a few thousand years ago, we would have learned to live together, enjoying our differences rather than fighting about them.  Perhaps we would have discovered cures for every disease by now.  Maybe by now we would have explored a lot more of outer space than we have.  <br>  Instead we fell into the trap of religion and "faith" and bickering about it.

Pick up the item, and feel your energy enter the item. As your energy merged with the item, visualize what you want to have happen. Do this for a few moments until you think you've done it long enough And that's it.|`|sEPjAHX4aa	just get the ouija board. its so much easier and fun. they really do work. :)|`|24H5tznkaa	Here, this site has a great explanation on it:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://elswet.50megs.com/essence/charging.html" rel="nofollow">http://elswet.50megs.com/essence/chargin...</a><br>  <br>  *edit*<br>  <br>  What helps me to visualize is to remember what it feels like to daydream. When we daydream, we see what we are imagining/thinking, if you can tap into that, you will be visualizing.<br>  <br>  When I charge objects, I tend to get into a meditative state, hold the object in my hand and sort of commune with it. <br>  <br>  However, most times the things that I use already have their specific purposes...so I don't have to charge them, I just have to keep them cleansed.<br>  <br>  I think the only time that I charge something with a particular intent is when I am working with clear crystal quartz...these stones are programmable. <br>  <br>  As far as spirit communication, the stone iolite is great for opening your third eye and spirit communication. Celestite also works...to an extent but that is more for Angelic communication.
ce060a29a8e7cbb3f7cdc004ec90adc3aa	There you have it, Ms Crone. Most of the so-called GOOD Christians who answered this Question have NO sympathy for the sick, injured, aged and infirm. They're just a bunch of "slackers" looking for a handout instead of working for their needs. And ONE seems to think that universal health care is found in the Bible. Well, I READ those passages from the Bible (or had ReadPlease read it FOR me) and guess what? I'm STILL freaking blind. That really worked well. There's a wonderful example of GREAT fundamentalist compassion for those who NEED care. <br>  <br>  You know what? I sincerely HOPE that YOUR Rapture IS about to happen so I can witness your Jesus slapping you folks around before you take YOUR long slide off into Hell. If you think Jesus is going to have compassion on you compassionless people you are in for one heck of an enormous surprise. I have seen more love and compassion shown by a rock than I have from the likes of you people.

There was no dispute that there is a waiting list for cardiovascular surgery for life-threatening problems. Dr. Daniel Doyle, a cardiovascular surgeon who teaches and practises in Quebec City, testified that a person with coronary disease is 'sitting on a bomb' and can die at any moment. He confirmed, without challenge, that patients die while on waiting lists: A.R., at p. 461. Inevitably, where patients have life-threatening conditions, some will die because of undue delay in awaiting surgery." -- Supreme Court of Canada, Chaoulli v. Quebec, paragraph 112<br>  <br>  "Dr. Eric Lenczner, an orthopaedic surgeon, testified that the one-year delay commonly incurred by patients requiring ligament reconstruction surgery increases the risk that their injuries will become irreparable (A.R., at p. 334). Dr. Lenczner also testified that 95 percent of patients in Canada wait well over a year, and many two years, for knee replacements. While a knee replacement may seem trivial compared to the risk of death for wait-listed coronary surgery patients, which increases by 0.5 percent per month (A.R., at p. 450), the harm suffered by patients awaiting replacement knees and hips is significant. Even though death may not be an issue for them, these patients 'are in pain', 'would not go a day without discomfort' and are 'limited in their ability to get around', some being confined to wheelchairs or house bound (A.R., at pp. 327-28)." -- Supreme Court of Canada, Chaoulli v.

Love is love, and should be encouraged.

It's possible to be homosexual and want to be part of a Christian community.|`|spbqfjvbaa	It's my LIFE, not a lifestyle.  I don't think you are living a heterosexual & Christian lifestyle.  You are living a LIFE.  It is no different from your life, even if you disagree with a small portion of how I live it.  Who I love does not make me any less of a Christian, a friend, diminish my character, or how I treat my fellow man,  thank you.<br>  <br>  We don't want acceptance from the Church.  And you do realize that there are Christian churches that do accept/have members who are gay, right?  My wife is Catholic, & they accept gay/lesbian members.  They just want them to remain celebate,  not have gay relationships or be married in the Church.<br>  <br>  In addition, there are christian churches who fully accept gays in their church, including celebrating their gay parishoners getting married.<br>  <br>  Personally, I don't want my life (NOT lifestyle) accepted by a church.  I want the same benefits of marriage that any other couple would have through the state & federal government (i.e., the STATE).  It is up to the church to recognize our lives or not & up to me to be a member of that church.  I don't care about acceptance from the church.  I care about acceptance from God.  And as you & I both know, the church is not all knowing, infallable, nor mistake proof.  The church makes no difference to me.  WHat matters is God.<br>  <br>  God loves all of us the same.  It is for Him to decide which is the greater sin: pointing out & passing judgment of the sin of others & alienating that person, or being gay & hiding who you are to live life as a lie & destroying the lives of the spouse, children, & in-laws you acquire through marriage.<br>  <br>  I'll take my chances & live a truthful life while still being good to my fellow man.  Being gay doesn't automatically make you a bad person, just like being a Christian doesn't automatically make you a good person.  The main thing to determine the goodness of a person is THE PERSON.

It can change during your lifetime.<br>  <br>  It may be easy to count your actual homo/heterosexual encounters,<br>  but that doesn't define your actual orientation.<br>  <br>  Labels like "straight", "gay", and "bisexual" need not be the only three options available to us.<br>  <br>  Check this out<br>  The Klein Sexual Orientation Grid<br>  <a href="http://www.youthnetsouthampton.org.uk/breakout/kleingrid.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.youthnetsouthampton.org.uk/br...</a>
w8uUWK03aa	Put simply, you have a sexual identity crisis going on in your head and you would be ill-advised to listen to any pseudo psychoanalysts on this website.  Instead seek the help of a professional counsellor who will help you through the minefield of conflicting thoughts.  <br>  <br>  There's not just a simple two sentence answer to your predicament.  If you contact a Gay & Lesbian Centre in your city, they should be able to give you the names of some sympathetic professionals who can help you sort things out.  <br>  <br>  As a preliminary exercise, you might like to look at this UK website for Youth Sexuality, there are several tests which can give you some ideas of where you are at, but you should still consult a counsellor if it is giving you grief.

ew7nQKXSaa	"Prick" can refer to the penis.<br>  <br>  Normally, it means that somebody is a jerk. That person is not a nice person.<br>  <br>  Example:<br>  <br>  "I hate Bob. He is such a prick!"
10bb153a928c9693ebec1b2660853526aa	"Focal vocabulary" is just a certain set of words a group of people use. So for example, tribes of Native Americans in Alaska will have specialized words for snow. In English, we just have one word, "snow." According to the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis, that shows that we see "snow" as just one big white fluffy thing, whereas that tribe in Alaska will see "snow" as many different kinds of snow with different attributes, texture (and maybe even color, I don't know).|`|512c6d0ae442707f9f6382691e2b0b48aa	I can help you if you please explain the question further, I studied this theory last term
mGfCY4Ytaa	well im not male, so this might not be the perpective you are looking for, but I am a lesbian and I can tell you that girl on girl porn is NOTHING like real lesbian sex. the porn is highly exaggerated and stereotyped to cater to the desires of straight men. I don't have any lesbian friends who watch girl on girl porn because we all know how ridiculous it is. I find it offensive and it just encourages men to objectify lesbians.<br>  <br>  although i will admit that i watched porn a lot when I was in middle school and thats how I figured out i was a lesbian. at first I noticed that I was only interested in the girls, not the guys, and eventually I noticed that straight sex didn't do anything for me, i just waited around for some girl on girl to happen, but now that I've had sex with girls, I doubt even that would do anything for me because I know how ridiculous it is.

u8CFwtyMaa	I'm bi, and I don't remember ever thinking I wanted to be this way.<br>  When I started primary school, I was interested in the boys more than the girls, but thought nothing of it.<br>  When puberty approached, and I started to notice girls, I found I was still attracted to boys, and as life went on, I had relationships with both sexes. It just happened that the relationship that became permanent was with a girl, and we're now married, with 2 great kids. But I still see hot guys, and feel attracted to them.<br>  It was never a choice, it just happened that way, right from the beginning.<br>  Hope this helps|`|GGf3XRBCaa	Not a choice.<br>  <br>  .

DrY7Volbaa	If you mean it as a rude way of telling someone to go away (as I suppose you don't need it literally), the Romanian equivalents would be:<br>  "Du-te dracu'!" or "Du-te naibii!". They're maybe slightly softer in meaning than the English expression (slightly closer to "go to hell!"), but, nevertheless, the reaction of the person you're saying it to is the same. The direct translation is never used.|`|I2amoo6Kaa	du-te im romanian so i know|`|XS8XRwpnaa	What Rico said is right, but it's not the direct translation. It means more like "go to hell" what he said.<br>  This words translated directly in Romanian would sound very rude, so I'm not going to write them here, but if you really want to know you can email me and I'll tell you.

Or you can go to the interview with the stud, and obviously don't show in any way that a nose stud will compromise your skills for that position(be professional etc) and i dont think you will have any problems.
