But i guess you can find out on a website or something.|`|CQXGO1M5aa	No, you cannot add anything to a disc.|`|AA11052521	nope, you are stuck, bring your Wii unit over to a friends apt/house that has one, then you can logon and download all night, then when you bring it home you will have those songs to play forever.|`|CRxQKlqWaa	Ok there are three simple things that you can do.    1. Use an ethernet cable and connect it from the computer to your Wii.    2. Buy a Nintendo Wi-Fi USB connector (about $30.00) and it will permit you to connect to the internet for the Wii.    3. Bring your Wii system and game to someone who has their internet connection and use theirs.    Hope this helps and Good Luck!

Kddjmy4Aaa	Ofcourse It's possible, (Only on the PSP FAT)  Look up "Pandora's battery Tutorial" On google.  You'll find millions of tutorials on how to do it succsesfully.    You'll probably have to buy a PSP psp Fat Battery and Hard MOD it into a Pandora's battery unless you wanna buy one off ebay.   Then Try to find a tutorial on how to Turn a 512MB Memory stick into a magic memory stick.
UE1evlTlaa	At Universal Studios, people may disagree, but I really like the NASCAR cafe. I had one of the best burgers I had ever had there! Also, Margaritaville is a fun change from everything else. They have great music, good food, and fabulous drinks. It is also fun for kids because it is colorful and the music is fun.    At Disney's MGM Studios (now Disney's Hollywood Studios), I would have to agree with the Sci Fi Diner. Make sure you get a reservation early in the day because spots DO fill up here for reservations. Another cool experience is the 50's Prime Time Cafe Dine In experience. You will feel like you are on the set of "Leave It To Beaver" in an old 50's cafe/kitchen. It is a really cool experience with fun diner food, not to mention GREAT milkshakes! Also, another great one is the Brown Derby! It is had Old Hollywood style and the cobb salad is DELICIOUS!|`|9NpXU7D2aa	i agree with april.   hard rock cafe for IOA   and sci-fi is awesome at MGM (now called hollywood studios)|`|ajnGHNr8aa	Good sit down at Universal is Hard Rock, expensive and usually a ridiculous wait to sit but good food. Nascar cafe is not too bad either.    At Disney MGM the Sci-Fi theatre is a neat experience and there is a cool pizza place. The new Dinosaur restaraunt is open at Downtown Disney and is based on the Rainforest Cafe, probably a long wait but looks really cool. Downtown Disney has lots of places to eat with different types of food to chose from.|`|AA11615216	are you wanting a table service type meal or a quick service?      If its a table service, I'd go to the Hard Rock Cafe' at IOA    and at MGM i'd go to the Sci Fi Diner|`|H2qEN27daa	I havent been to Disney in so long so I cant help there, but at Universal-- Latin Quarter has really good food. I would say eat there or Margaritaville. You can eat at Hard Rock anywhere, so go somewhere else! Enjoy your trip =)

JxJbKOGPaa	hers a list of games that i would find good.<br>  1.little big planet- this game is fun, but it is rather to complete.the online is good+u can make anything you want:)<br>  <br>  2.GTA IV- the story to this game is really good i think, and decent missions and its the best outta the series. the graphics have really improved from other gta games, the online can get pretty boring. id give it a 7/10<br>  <br>  3.Metal Gear Solid 4-this game is very good, good story although you may have to own the others mgs games to get the full story, the graphics are amazing, just great and the weapons are great aswell. online is great fun, you can do so many different matches like deathmatch, team deathmatch team sneak, and so on.<br>  <br>  thesse are 3 best games that i hav.|`|TZUwKuonaa	well Little Big Planet is pretty funny<br>  but well err.. i think my favorite Ps3 game is "Lair".<br>  It has a nice Graphic and a great story good control,nice features<br>  and it actually not so easy which guarantees many hours of playing.|`|asbPP2psaa	Gta 4. It was awesome.|`|X7ig5Hjvaa	assasins creed... good game ;)|`|oZ6B4xkOaa	Hm....<br>  Metal Gear Solid 4 - Great story, great gameplay<br>  LittleBigPlanet - Really innovative<br>  Mirror's Edge - Looks and plays beautiful<br>  Soul Calibur IV - Fast game, great custom character creation<br>  ... That's all I can think of at the moment.|`|VouIeBzmaa	i like GTA 4 its really coold one.<br>  <br>  Thanks|`|s6hhRtQuaa	Call of Duty: World at War<br>  <br>  The campaign is great. WW2 gameplay at it's best. Going through it is amazing. You have all sorts of weapons to use in it including a flamethrower! It keeps you busy for hours.<br>  Then, you can go through it on Veteran! The hardest difficulty! This is insanely hard. You only need to get shot 2-3 times and then your dead. Plus, they throw granades everywhere. You can't escape from them. It's really fun. This took me around 4x as long as going through it on normal difficulty.<br>  <br>  The multiplayer is amazing as well. You go up in ranks and the highest rank is 65. As your going a long you unlock more weapons. And at LV.65 you can use the flamethrower online! LOL it's great using that when there's a lot of enemies in a small building. Now, you might think it sounds boring after being LV.65 for a while. Well, don't worry! When you reach LV.65 and have got enough EXP you can Prestiege. This means you get a new badge and you start from level 1 again and work your way back up. You can prestiege a total of 10 times.<br>  <br>  So, i'd really recommend it. If your not a fan of WW2 gameplay though try Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. It's basically exactly the same except it's Modern gameplay.|`|7nz5Cp6waa	GTA4, Same reason as everyone else that said GTA4, its awesome

y02PZj22aa	Wow, you brought back memories!  Those looms were really popular in the 1960s and 1970s.  One woman I knew back then had her husband to make her one that was big enough for rugs:  It was rectangular and had wooden pegs rather than finishing nails.      Here's a web site I found with pictures of the looms and instructions for weaving, tying, and finishing your project.  http://www.lapweaving.info/    Here's a web site with a video demonstrating a person weaving, tying, and taking the project off a hexagon loom.  http://video.aol.com/video-detail/weavin...    I also ran across a set of commercially made looms called "Love and Money."  They seem to be the same principle.      I didn't find instructions for making the looms themselves, but it should be simple enough for someone who knows how to use a miter saw.  There are an uneven number of nails on each side and they're about an inch apart.  Good luck with finding what you're looking for.|`|PXWVGQyAaa	This is a link for a hexagon loom but if you look at your local public library. there are lots of books on the craft.  You should also visit the seniors on yahoo, there are a lot of knowledgable people there. click on cultures and groups , then senior citizens.

8PTII10Maa	Its tru there should be a flying type eevee... i think I deserve best answer :P|`|vZYVwM7Jaa	I agree but you would need nintendo to make an air stone or something like that. Or it could just evolve into a flying type without using an item|`|ffQcCWHqaa	Agree<br>  <br>  That would be absolutely brilliant.<br>  Its wings could be its ears =]|`|LwYt5eNMaa	Disagree.<br>  <br>  There should be one more evolution and if there ever is another one it will be dragon. That would mean all the evolutions will be of special type pokemon, not physical eg rock, fighting etc. It wouldn't make sense adding a flying type but a final dragon type would be a great idea as it could be the most powerful.
QGImaXfIaa	Chaning the tire size on our rc cars is just like putting bigger rims on a 1:1; you will change the cars speed. And often not in a good way, you would have to change your cars gearing to accommodate the 1/10 tires. So i'd atleast try to hold out for tires that will fit you 1/8 scale, you can check towerhobbies.com and amainhobbies.com if you havent already.

Cities are bustling with other players who are anxious to make new friends. The bars are teeming with drunkards (you can buy food and drink/wine), you can get a haircut, you can purchase mounts to ride on like Mammoth/Elephants, Tigers, Raptors, and Horses.  Explore deep dungeons like the Black Temple and the Caverns of Time. Encounter monstrous enemies like Forest Spiders, Desert Dust Devils, and huge Dragonkin.<br>  The time is precise, whenever it is morning on the East Coast, the East Coast realm/server will have the sun rising.<br>  Adventure through the intricate world as you do thousands of unique quests, from Bounty Hunting, to farming, to collecting sacred talismans. You can also create a character with unique stats, like an Orc Warrior, or a Human Mage, so on and so forth, their are millions of combinations and BILLIONS of things to do in this huge game called World of Warcraft!<br>  <br>  And what does Warhammer have?

THe odds in this game arent as good for you as blackjack but youll lose less have fun and you could win huge.<br>  The game i think you should play is called LET IT RIDE<br>   This is a very simple game to play and i will explain to you below.<br>  Once you sit at the table you will see the other players and pick it up quick. Basics are<br>  1 You have to put three bets out onto the table, if the minimum is 10$ then youll have 30$ that you are betting, now dont get scared at this number just keep reading<br>  2 You are dealt three cards- If in these three cards you recieve a pair f tens or better you automatically win all three bets. IF you do not have apair of tens or better you can pull one bet back.<br>  <br>  3 Ok next the dealer has 2 cards and flips up a card, this is your card too. If this card makes u a pair of tens or better youll stay and win at least 20$.  If you dont make at least a oair of tens youll pull back your scond bet leaving you with only 10$ at risk <br>  4 the dealer then flips his last card and again a pair of tens or better wins. even if the dealers two cards are a pair of ten or better u win.<br>  <br>  NOw this game also pays odds so say your dealt three 5s u automatically win 3 to one on all your bets a big payday. if you happen to hit a royal flush youll make at leat a hundred grand<br>  <br>  You can go to pogo.com or really just type let it ride into your browser and you can play for free to get the hang of it.|`|W7BZcdynaa	Blackjack. It's fairly simple to play. There is a card on the right memorize it.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://wizardofodds.com/blackjack" rel="nofollow">http://wizardofodds.com/blackjack</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Craps is a little harder, but if you know what you doing you can win. It is also the most fun.<br>  <br>  Roulette is also reallly easy but it's pure luck. I just play "outside the box"|`|d39f3dbe21f2274aab83dceb86482ed2aa	Play craps.  A bet on the pass line gives the casino a 1.41% advantage, don't pass is 1.38%.  These bets allow you to bet additional money on what is called an "odds" bet, and you are paid at the true mathematical odds (no casino advantage) on this bet.  Usually the maximum odds bet allowed is between 2 and 5 times your original bet on the pass line.  You can also get more action by making come/don't come bets and taking odds on these bets also.  These are basically the same as the pass/don't pass bets, but you are making your bet after the point is established (in the middle of the "round").<br>  <br>  There are a lot of other available bets on the table, but they are all worse than the pass/don't pass bets.  Some of these are really bad bets.  If the dealers see that you are a new player and suggest these bets to you, don't do it.  The dealers work for the casino and aren't going to give you the best advice.<br>  <br>  Once you take a few minutes to learn the basics, the game is simple, and there is really no thinking needed other than deciding what to bet on and how much.  Blackjack is a better game as far as a lower casino advantage (usually), but more work is required in learning basic strategy.  With craps, you really just need to learn the basic rules so you know how to bet and what to root for.  There is no strategy or decision making needed once you place your bet, it is all the luck of the dice.|`|sbMQDiTiaa	Well, if you're looking for a game where you can win big, than you're talking about games with jackpots. Jackpots are usually given on slots or videopoker. Slots are luck games that do not involve strategy, and are easy to learn, while videopoker is more complicated and requires skill.<br>  <br>  If you're looking for a game with a smaller house edge, where you have bigger chances to win (but harder to win big), then you should go for baccarat (it has the smallest house edge).|`|8e8c3993d0193a64d5c270f4d370080baa	Blackjack is the game that has the best return for the punter as there is some skill/judgment by you but all games are in favour of the house. <br>  Whenever i've been at the casino, i've only taken what i would normally spend on a decent night out anyway so you don't lose too big. <br>  The longer you play on the night, the more likely you are to lose on the tables, so if you get a fair amount of cash up then leave the tables and hit the bar.<br>  Enjoy.|`|zUmJ8ZFZaa	No such game exists.  The only way to increase the odds in a casino (which are horribly stacked against the player) is to play a more skill based game such as poker.|`|574eb859c301df997d80bbd93890321faa	Roulette is supposed to have the best odds (I think), but remember NO game at a casino is a guaranteed pay-off and there's a big chance you will lose money... so be careful!

mT5srUKHaa	Everyone knows that the probability of winning the lottery is a pretty big long shot. How long, however, you probably never really thought about. Your actual odds of winning the lottery depend on where you play, but single state lotteries usually have odds of about 18 million to 1 while multiple state lotteries have odds as high as 120 million to 1.<br>  <br>  If you have ever thought you'd win the lottery, you're not alone. About one out of every three people in the United States think that winning the lottery is the only way to become financially secure in their life. This is a frightening statistic when you sit down and consider what the above odds really mean.<br>  <br>  It's time to take a long hard look at the chances of you winning the lottery. While winning the lottery may be something that you want, to show you your chances we'll take a look at a number of remote occurrences that you probably wouldn't like to have happen to you - and probably don't think will ever happen to you - but are still much more likely to happen to you than winning the lottery.<br>  <br>  How about the classic odds of being struck by lightning? The actual probability of this happening varies from year to year, but as a good estimate, the National Safety Council says between 70 and 120 people a year die in the US by lightning - so let's take 100 as our base. With the US population being approximately 265 million people, that means that the chances of being killed by lightning are roughly 2,650,000 to 1. Not very likely. However you are still 6 to 45 times more likely to die from a lightning strike than you would be to win the lottery.|`|4d39e7dd6b413fbd46444cffe2149c0baa	Here's the basic formula: If it's lotto with 45 numbers and you get to pick 6 numbers without repeating any, it's 45 * 44 * 43 * 42 * 41 * 40 = 5,864,443,200 possible number of combinations so yes, the first answer was right, you get to have higher chances in being hit by lightning than winning the lottery.|`|EZyHOht7aa	You have a better chance of being struck by lightening.|`|pQVHGrRZaa	less than the chance that one will be stroked by lightening.

asbPP2psaa	Dont move your xbox while the game is inside. Dont play your xbox for long periods otherwise it will break. Make sure you put your xbox horizontally. Follow these procedures and you should be fine|`|AA10232254	These people above me have obviously never owned an Xbox...<br>  <br>  "Don't play it for more than 3 hours"? Give me a break. All you have to do is make sure your 360 is in a well-ventilated area. You won't need cooling things that'll break on you or whatnot.  <br>  <br>  I do second the person who says that you shouldn't move your console while a disc is spinning; that's extremely bad. At the very least, it will destroy your disc. <br>  <br>  Unless your mother is somehow buying you an Xbox 360 from 4 years ago, you can pretty much treat it like your PS3 and it'll be fine. The Jasper chipset (which you're most likely to get) and its predecessor the Falcon chipset both are extremely reliable, especially in the aforementioned heat issues.<br>  <br>  Happy gaming!|`|EeOnO2U7aa	Some people say buy a cooler thing for your Xbox 360, but DON'T! It will overheat it even more.<br>  Another thing is put it on it's side not standing up it will keep your games in better condition as the laser that reads the game will not be damaging on the ring where all the info for the game is stored and the game will be readable.<br>  <br>  Also don't accidently put your PS3 games in your 360. : )|`|EhBTfBhraa	Don't play it for more than 3 hours at any one time as it will cause the 360 to overheat, take 30-45 minute breaks between playing times. Every so often remove all cables from the 360 and blow into the sockets to remove any trapped dust etc. and also just keep the dust off the 360, hope this helps and enjoy your xbox dude =]|`|ffQcCWHqaa	Pretty easy:<br>  <br>  Dont play for long periods of time or else u get the RROD (Red Ring of Death) and its a ***** when you have to send it off to get fixed/replaced or whatever, play for 4-5 hours max to be safe. Also sit it laying down or else if its standing up the Fan inside sucks up dust and all that bad crap.<br>  <br>  Dont move it around with a game inside, if you move it around with a disc inside it gets screwed over with scratches.

These give the advantage of saving games even if the game or the system did not support such a feature. This is done by means of a RAM dump, which saves all the RAM data of the emulated console into a computer file for later use. <br>  <br>  These kind of saved games are usually called "saved states." "Save state hacking" is the practice of modifying the data in these saved states to achieve various effects, some of which would be otherwise impossible.

Yours is one of the missing at the moment but once you come out of hiding with it then you will know how many more are in hiding.  You might even get some offers.|`|AORcLwTNaa	maybe. see if you can find a buyer. if your buyer says that its not worth  4500 , only 5 dollars or so, just  reject the offer. the reason is, he's not stupid and hes not gona buy a coin for that much money if he can trick you into taking it for MUCH much less

You want to see a fair amount of smoke when the car is being driven, also if your idling is cool and acceleration is ok then i would adjsut your high speed needleto lean out more. if it dies when you are running full throttle then i would guess you need to change the end point adjustment on your servo running the throttle on the car, turn the EPA down, i run mine down to 74% so the engine throttle doesn't open completely. if you think the car is running funny after the EPA adjustment, tune the carb as needed.<br>  <br>  <br>  as for air filter oil, it helps, go to auto zone and get a small bottle from them, just ask them they can grab it.

Find a job or find some place you can volunteer.  Senior homes always need volunteers.  ALso libraries to help kids with reading.  Or learn a craft for donating like crocheting squares for afghan for the homeless.  You can make hats for children with cancer.  You can sew baby blanket for the babies born premature in local hospitals.  And hats.  So much out there.  <br>  You could join a club at school... chess?  or Future Leaders of America, Student Council, etc. They are always busy.  <br>  Do you get A's in school?  If not....STUDY!<br>  Good Luck|`|rYNM67oyaa	Learn to play an instrument like a guitar or harmonica.

This is only a guess as it comes out in the UK in April so I thought USA would have it in stock before.|`|QzD3rJtMaa	I believe I saw this somewhere yesterday.  I think it said around April 1st or so.

0brkUyGgaa	Currently, no word exists on whether Capcom is developing any Street Fighter games for the Nintendo DS nor whether it plan to do so anytime in the future, unfortunately so. I can only imagine it would be a terrific idea, but we just have to wait and see.|`|ffQcCWHqaa	Im pretty sure they is gonna be Street Fighter IV on ds,<br>  <br>  just google Street Fighter DS
MdyHKQRGaa	Sort of.<br>  <br>  NTSC versions of games cannot be played on PAL consoles, and vice versa.
FQdE11IBaa	On animal crossing wild world your facial appearance is determined by the start of game questions. You cant change that after that point.<br>  You can change clothes (or design your own) by purchasing them at  the able sisters shop.<br>  To get a new hairstyle, Nook must have upgraded his store to "Nookingtons" where there is a hair salon including the harirdresser "Harriet" will change it depending on a series of questions.<br>  Good luck! :D
381e3207230460fe8521d523304a91a6aa	Bushido Blade.|`|a6FK5F5Oaa	Most likely, You are talking about Dynasty Warriors. It was available on the Playstation, it featured traditional 1v1 combat, and was one of the most advanced fighting games of its time because of the complex weapon system. It's cover art is loaded with bombastic kanji and it's a pretty old game, as all psx games are. I can't think of any other fighting game that uses the phrase "dynasty warriors".|`|yUkphPkiaa	Hmmm. It might be Soul Calibre or perhaps Mortal Kombat. King of Fighters perhaps?
VqJrKA8caa	Click the first link, then look for the corresponding picture.. and it should explain where it is on RS.

ffQcCWHqaa	Well first off you need to get 2000 points in total then a sacrfice of your spouse between the hours of 12:00am - 1:00 am and then you recieve The Maelstrom. It is a long sword with 58 damage and augmented with Scourge. Its not the best weapon out there but it looks pretty cool.
o7qKEHpkaa	1) well, your use of Rylai is not well, you should learn frost nova first, then frostbite, and learn first Brilliance Aura than Stats, like this:<br>  1. Frost Nova<br>  2. Frost Bite<br>  3. Frost Nova<br>  4. Frost Bite<br>  5. Frost Nova<br>  6. Freezing Field<br>  7. Frost Bite<br>  8. Frost Nova<br>  9. Frost Nova<br>  10. Stats<br>  11. Freezing Field<br>  12. Brilliance Aura<br>  13. Brilliance Aura<br>  14. Brilliance Aura<br>  15. Brilliance Aura<br>  16. Freezing Field<br>  17. Stats<br>  18. Stats<br>  19. Stats<br>  20. Stats<br>  21. Stats<br>  22. Stats<br>  23. Stats<br>  24. Stats<br>  25. Stats<br>  2) your build is ALMOST correct, BUY BOOTS OF SPEED FIRST.<br>  3) in using rylai:<br>  (please take note that rylai is not armored enough, so be careful!)<br>  use timing (attack the enemy with the lowest hp)<br>  if your opponent (hero) is low on HP, Use Frost Nova! (First Blood!)<br>  Use Frost Bite if your enemy is escaping<br>  Use Freezing Field if there are many creeps<br>  4) about the melee characters, you should pick banehallow (The Lycanthrope) Awoooooooooo!<br>  Lycanthrope early build: boots of speed (always) 5 Bracers<br>  Mid and late game: Heart of tarrasque, boots of travel, Divine Rapier, Hood of Defiance, Bottle, VanGuard<br>  Well, Lycanthrope is an easy char. just be patient when killing a hero because he has the weakest dmg if compared w/ you classm8's "specialty" (thats why i recommend Divine Rapier) w/ 52-56 level 1 dmg well, here's a tip, when escaping, use Summon Wolves to distract your enemy, giving you a BIG opportunity to escape.<br>  well, im tired of typing, (sorry about the 5th question about the ranged char,) Bye|`|ryFl7CIWaa	try using Razor or Sniper. their skills are not bad and they have 600 range. Sniper can make his range more with one of his skills and razor has a skill that damages nearby enemies. i use them and they are not bad.

qrDYcctfaa	Im not sure of what kind of game your looking for but if your looking for a MMORPG.   ""Shaiya"" is an excellent MMORPG and its free. You can choose from the light or the fury. You can fight pvp in certain areas. For help playing I suggest you join a guild like "Blessed Knights" you can ask questions while playing or ask for help defeating a creature or just help leveling. You can find shaiya on www.aeriagames.com Good Luck|`|RTCKiu03aa	why dont you go to pogo.com|`|PcbAISY6aa	raceyourduck com|`|9bqMRlp2aa	yes there is......u can find lot's of cool game on <a href="http://www.caiman.us/" rel="nofollow">http://www.caiman.us/</a><br>  I download Tribe-x and it is cool game that u can play on lan and online...|`|88HquT6Raa	Hey, check this out: <a href="http://womengames.co.uk" rel="nofollow">http://womengames.co.uk</a> Nice games there...|`|EOzxtPrSaa	why not try guild wars

In The Millions<br>  <br>  Hope This Helps|`|GAf3BSKAaa	Fighting is probably the best way to earn money. The key is to fight someone with a lot of property and few weapons. I once fought a mogul who had only a Glock, but had four strip malls and earned $1,200,000.<br>  <br>  If this doesn't work for you, buy property. This will earn you money even while you are not playing the game. If you choose this route, be sure to pick mogul, because they generate money faster than workaholics and brawlers.

78bcbS7haa	Did you make sure to download the mesh as well? You put the mesh in the downloads folder as well as the hairstyle. Usually the creator adds a link where you can get the mesh?

ApZ0qS88aa	Safest bet would be to have it professionally repaired, however being that it's a PS2 that would probably cost more than replacing it. The only way that I know of (and I know it's going to seem counter intuitive) is to open it up and clean it well using DISTILLED water then dry it thoroughly.|`|7yZksOlRaa	try taking the cover off and use a hairdryer to dry inside.if water has got into the laser then its probebly capoot!only thing you can do is dry it....good luck.

Actually for unlimited deals, there has been a study done and 82 to 91% of the games could be solved.  However, this was also with the locations of all cards known.  See the link below if you are interested.<br>  <br>  With 3 deals, and not knowing all locations of cards, however, it must be much much lower than this.  I would say somewhere between 5 and 10%|`|divHOiLWaa	well, Solitaire involves luck, skill and smarts so it depends.

the07WyGaa	Usually any model/hobby store will have small bottles of lacquer that you can airbrush on, or hand paint with a soft bristle artists brush. This stuff goes on clear and some are available as a glossy or a flat coat. As for the acrylic paint rubbing off, it could be also surface cleanliness. Using rubbing alcohol to 'degrease' fingerprints and the like might help also.|`|3149d8c79c2c2fd573c8fb1acb44e350aa	PermEnamel paint is for glass,tile and ceremic.

I have around 8 of them but have played plenty more. Sounds to me like you enjoy the first person shooters so yes Halo 3 and COD are at the top of the game then but another GREAT choice is Rainbow Six V2. It's very realistic and you can play online as well through XBox Live. Another one of my favorite games for 360 is Assassin's Creed. AC is definitely one of my all time favorites regardless of the console. If you want a sports game Madden is always a great choice too.|`|9PJsetmZaa	Gears Of War is a really good game online. Gears of War 2 has a really weak shotgun in online gaming so you might find some discomfort playing but Gears of War 1 is awesome. Both are good anyway.

qUuafpuwaa	The first guy is right, there is a glitch on the ps3. There's no point in selling your game though. What I recommend you do is first complete the "vampire cure" quest(must become vampire first). Then go to the local gamestop or eb games and look for the Shivering Isles expansion game. I got mine for about 19 bucks, if not, you can buy the expansion on the playstation network for 29.99. This gives you everything.    The glitch caused me to start a new character after forgetting that I was a vampire and fast traveled during the day.|`|jRkv495Raa	If you wants this extra **** then yeh defo!    From IGN:    The special edition includes the entire original game plus the expansions Shivering Isles and Knights of the Nine.

Overall its about doing your best with something you really don't have much control of.|`|TcyuVk8Qaa	Poker is one of those games that has something for everyone. Gamblers like it because it is one of their beloved casino games. Aggressive people like it because they can bully people at the poker table. Intellectuals like it because it is a thinking man's game that requires knowledge of math and probabilities. It is also the people person's game because so much of poker is psychology and knowing your opponent. Hustlers like it because it is one of the rare games of skill that is played for money almost anywhere. Also, if you are referring to Hold'em, the game is very versatile in that it can be played with as few as two people or as many as twenty two with just one deck of cards. Playing the game well is a real challenge. You may play well against some playing styles and think you have the game figured out but then someone with a different style sits at the table and the next thing you know you are being owned. You could play poker everyday for twenty years and still would not have learned everything there is to know about the game. If you have a mind to get into games of strategy, it is truly a fascinating game.|`|UetuwbYnaa	people enjoy poker because its betting money and its easy money. and poker is just a game of making the right choice.
iF1ZCcYEaa	Well, first you must travel long and far back in time to the lush Methopotaniman jungle and search for the castle of Reshkor, inside you will find a crystal staircase with thirteen steps. Count them carefully. On the sixth step, clap sixty times and you will be whisked away to the magical mustard mountain. You must saunder up the slippery summit and find the Mystical Master of Mustard. The Mystical Master of Mustard does not waste time, so he will give you three tasks, which you must complete in six days. If you fail, you may start completely over and try again. If you succeed, he will give you the majestic mustard of methopotanima. Apply this majestic condiment on a bologna sub sandwich bought from Quiznos(mmm tasty) NOT SUBWAY!!!

I used unspun wool (has to be real wool, and very soft twist) and knit it very loosely into a small bag.  Then I took it to the sink and hot soapy water, and really gave it a good wash.  I squeezed, and squished, and pulled a little, and more squishing.  Suddenly, it took shape, and it all came together!  It all nicely felted, you can't even see the stitches, and it's nicely solid.  By accident I think, it was just the right size, and the phone slid in perfectly!  It was a fun thing to do... a little scary, but really fun.  I've felted a few things since then.<br>  <br>  Knitting a bag is really simple.  Make a long rectangle twice as long as the phone, plus a bit for the flap, if you want one.  Sew up the sides, and give it a bit of a steam, or misting with water, lay flat to dry.  You can make it bigger if you want to put more than just a phone in it.
qQqC2cHIaa	The one on e-bay is wayyyyyyyy over priced, and the ad is false, a tiptronic is not industrial or industrial strength or heavy duty in the least. That term "industrial strength" is a sign the auction is a scam.  Tiptronics are are good quality general purpose domestic household sewing machines.  It Will sew a wide variety of fabrics from light silks to denim and garment weight leathers.  it won't handle upholstery fabric, luggage weight leather belts, dog collar leather, handbag leather or some of the other heavy fabrics in the e-bay ad, and it's not for industrial use, but it's excellent for home use.  These sold for about 300 dollars back in the day, so paying more than the original list price is foolish. 75-150$ is a good price, i think the sewing machine blue book has it in that range.   The tiptronics and tipmatics are still in production today and they range from 300 to 800$ depending on the dealer and location and they haven't changed much from the older one.  Spending over 300 on an older one when the new ones aren't much more expensive is not a good idea.<br>  <br>  Here's an e-bay guide on older Pfaff machines being sold for outrageous prices: <a href="http://reviews.ebay.com/WANT-INDUSTRIAL-STRENGTH-OR-HEAVY-DUTY-SEWING-MACHINE_W0QQugidZ10000000000765178" rel="nofollow">http://reviews.ebay.com/WANT-INDUSTRIAL-...</a> <br>  and this: <a href="http://reviews.ebay.com/false-information-on-true-industrial-sewing-machines_W0QQugidZ10000000004850718" rel="nofollow">http://reviews.ebay.com/false-informatio...</a><br>  <br>  Pfaff supports older machines selling feet and bobbins for the older machines.  It takes standard household needles, which are available everywhere,  It's good solid machine, nothing overly special, and if you keep it oiled and maintained it should still have many years of life left in it. Just don't pay too much for what is basically nothing more than old used home sewing machine.|`|q5fqP31taa	There is one for sale on Ebay - <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/PFAFF-INDUSTRIAL-STRENGTH-HEAVY-DUTY-SEWING-MACHINE_W0QQitemZ330307364072QQcmdZViewItemQQptZBI_Sewing_Machines?hash=item330307364072" rel="nofollow">http://cgi.ebay.com/PFAFF-INDUSTRIAL-STR...</a><br>  <br>  The ad is really pushing this machine - maybe too much.<br>  <br>  I would get the "warranty" in writing, signed and witnessed - it has to be a personal warranty as the machine is too old to have a valid manufactures warranty.

8hbm4uiPaa	Kyren Sniper's ability occurs during every upkeep of yours, so assuming it remains in play, it 'may' do 1 damage to your opponent at the beginning of each of your turns.  <br>  <br>  It's a 'may' ability though, so if you go into your draw phase by drawing your card for your turn, by rule, you are not allowed to go back and deal that 1-point of damage.<br>  <br>  If you would like to play 2-on-2, I would suggest Two-Headed Giant.  It's actually a competitive format that allows two players to compete against two opponents.  The rules are too detailed to go into here, but you can search the Internet for 'MTG Two Headed Giant' or go to www.magicthegathering.com.<br>  <br>  In 2HG, each player has their own deck, you do not share mana resources, and you attack as individuals, but you share 30-life and you share blocking assignments.  You are also allowed to share as much game information and strategy as you like.|`|CQJukAKBaa	Answering your second question-<br>  Off the top my head, there is no card that will deal damage to the enchanted creature every turn and Gatherer (Magic's official card database) doesn't like me. However, Stuffy Doll is fun with Shivan Meteor (Deals 13 damage to target creature), target Stuffy and the chosen player will take 13 damage. Stuffy gets insane when you enchant it with Guilty Conscience. When you tap Stuffy for it's ability it creates an infinite loop.<br>  Here is how it works:<br>  -Tap Stuffy for ability, it takes 1 damage.<br>  -Stuffy activates, chosen player takes 1 damage.<br>  -Guilty activates, Stuffy takes 1 damage.<br>  -Stuffy activates, chosen player takes 1 damage.<br>  -Guilty activates, Stuffy takes 1 damage.<br>  -Stuffy activates, chosen player takes 1 damage.<br>  -Guilty activates, Stuffy takes 1 damage.<br>  -Etc.<br>  I'm not sure if you need to break the loop to win or not (since the loop keeps going without you doing anything, and if the opponent does not lose immediately, the game will never end) so find a local judge or just play cards that will prevent damage to Stuffy.

c231bbpTaa	If you like puzzel games then professor layton and the curious village is a really good game. It's a good game in general not just for the puzzle genre. It has a story line that is great to follow and the puzzles get quite challenging.     Also I would go for anything mario. Mario Kart, New Super Mario Bros (if you like the old mario games then that's a good choice), Super Mario 64 (seems you missed out on that one), mario party and Yoshi's Island DS (if you had yoshi's island for super nintendo it's the same idea).    Animal Crossings is also a good game and Zelda Phantom Hour Glass (I didn't find it too be too challenging. I beat the game. Yes you want some challenge so it's not too easy to get through).|`|ncCWnApDaa	My personal favorite is Zelda Phantom Hourglass, others I like are the Final Fantasy titles all of them are good also New Super Mario Bros, Sonic and Puzzle Quest, depends on what genre's you like though.|`|jYjiBAQdaa	Animal crossing wild world, any Final fantasy(dont know if ur interested in tht.), new super mario bros.|`|MWTzRUuQaa	Great question.

I surpose you could, if you have the space, 3 360's, and 3 TVs. But apart from HALO I can't think of any games that would even support that many players offline. Your better off playing online.    Can't think of any way on the PS3.  (Additional Information) You can connect 8 PS3 controllers to PS3, which is the most of any console atm, however one has to be done with a cable as you can only do up to 7  on wireless at a time.

AA10942007	Depends if you're going to be playing 4th or 5th edition rules; Both these factions have been downgraded in the 5th, mostly from making the Gauss weapons less effective, and restricting Tyranids to running moves. <br>  <br>   However, the Necrons are capable of moving troops on and off the battlefield very unpredictably and are a good force against Eldar and IG particularly due to strong firepower and Fear-inducing units; Tyranids once in contact with vehicles and troops are very likely to win through simple assault moves, but will die in waves if you face up to any force with artillery such as the IG or the Tau. <br>  <br>   Your choice . . . But in the hands of a a skilled and/or lucky player, almost any force can win on the day. :)|`|XnuW7Vsvaa	Well it really depends on how you feel your play style is going to be. Tyranids are more of a horde army, and require lots of models which means they are more expensive to start. Necron are very tough and typically slow. They dont have any variety really, their only troop choice is a warrior squad, but any necrons that died during your enemys turn can get back up on a roll of 4 or higher so its really up to your play preferance

CKpPpK0saa	I would like to say that, you are going to have a ton of fun! :)<br>  <br>  I would like to recommend you to buy your five day park tickets this moment because they are 174.00 each ticket. they are having a ticket sale that the park hopper tickets are children's price. i wouldn't worry about the tickets getting out dated because they last until january 4, 2010. that sums up to about 870.00 in all for tickets.<br>  <br>  If you are bringing your stroller for the twins, they have stroller parking to make it easier for you guys. but if you guys aren't bringing a stroller, they have strollers with two seater strollers are 18.00 a day and one stroller seats are 10.00 a day.<br>  <br>  rides in disneyland are suitable for all your children. i would reccomend to not go on space mountain, splash mountain, big thunder mountain or indiana jones with your 2 year old twins. it is very scary for young children. but if your six year old daughter loves fast and adventure rides, id say go for it! one of you, your husband or you could go with your six year old daughter and hang out with your twins while they go on the ride. just wait outside. your 2 year olds will totally enjoy disneyland!! there is the dumbo ride, train rides, small world, snow white ride etc. they could also meet mickey minnie and all their pals! it will be really fun for your two year olds!<br>  <br>  food is a little expensive at disneyland, i would say 20.00 each meal per person. but in disneyland, they have some cheap restaurants there. they have a fabulous buffets and some little sit downs where you can have hamburgers, salads, etc. (ask a disneyland worker what and where they have the kind of foods you are in the mood for that isn't so expensive) that would be a thousand dollars for food.<br>  <br>  air i would reccomend finding the tickets now because they are much cheaper. find a cheap airline for round way tickets. i would say about 200.00 each ticket. that would be a thousand in total.<br>  <br>  if you guys are planning on buying souvenears for the children, i would give them a certain price for shopping. for example, 35.00 in total. they could buy a nice mickey mouse plush toy, stuffed animal or a shirt or a nice pin necklace (where they could collect pins!)<br>  <br>  rooms in disneyland can be farely cheep. they can be 100$ a night or even 200$. it depends on what room you want to get. but i would love to say, there is a special disney princess room or mickey mouse where your children have a very cute disney princess or mickey mouse room that are decorated full of disney princesses of mickey mouse. call disneyland for more info on that. your room will be connected to theirs.<br>  <br>  i would say you are going to reach your 5k limit.<br>  <br>  <br>  i hope you have a nice time in disneyland and if you have any other questions feel free to email me! i will answer ASAP!

The 2 year olds will get in free, so you just need one child ticket and two adult tickets.<br>  Here are the ticket prices: <a href="http://disneyland.disney.go.com/disneyland/en_US/reserve/ticketListing?name=TicketListingPage" rel="nofollow">http://disneyland.disney.go.com/disneyla...</a><br>  <br>  The food in the park is around $8 per person per meal. That's about the cheapest you will find. The prices go up from there. You can spend $30 a person at a place like the Blue Bayou. You can leave the park if you want and drive to get food, but restaurants are about 2 miles a way and it would probably take you about 2 hours at least to gather up the kids, walk to the tram, go back to the parking lot, then drive, eat, and do all that again in reverse. If you don't mind leaving the park for a few hours you can save some money.<br>  <br>  There are package deals also. <br>  6 nights at Disneyland Paradise Pier Hotel with 2 day park hopper will be around $2000<br>  Same thing at Disneyland Hotel will be about $2500<br>  Same thing at Grand California Hotel will be about $3000<br>  <br>  I'd probably do a 3 day at minimum. During June it's starting to get busy there and the lines will be longer. Should be able to do everything in 3 days.|`|cCAGstnpaa	That is about how much it costs, and no the twins aren't too young for Disneyland.|`|5YYDE0SEaa	if you wanna save money check disneyland secrets - <a href="http://www.disneylandsecrets.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.disneylandsecrets.com/</a>

AA11084698	Yes. all you need to do is to install the official custom firmware. And If that isn't enough, you can system default it just to be safe.|`|lQGDV7MEaa	No. If you do that, you'll brick your PSP.<br>  Go to System Settings > Restore Default Settings and select "Yes." It'll be as if you never had the custom firmware.|`|evaZJkekaa	Restoring default settings will NOT work. That simply restores usernames and default backgrounds etc. This is because the custom firmware is in the PSP's flash memory, and there isn't any backup to restore to. Still, I'm guessing this is somehow related to PSN store? Dark_AleX has made a plugin that can fake your firmware version, and if you want to make it look like you're on official firmware, Red_Squirrel made a plugin to change your system information (until he left :().<br>    <br>  Still, if not, either use Despertar del Cementerio to put your PSP back on official firmware, but that's a bit complicated getting the Pandora back to normal. Maybe just wait foir the next Sony update and upgrade to that.|`|eylltobiaa	hi mate i got a psp aswell<br>  <br>  all u need to do is go "system setting----->restore default settings ------> ok then it should work but sometimes it cant work because u could brick ur psp then u hav to go some electric shop to unbrick it <br>  <br>  <br>  hope this helped|`|8TttaNc3aa	lol, no it wont. i have cfw and did that and i still had it. i just pushed it to c is i could fix my wifi tho.

In the Pokeball is Rock Climb. ;D there ya go!|`|w4qS66aqaa	rock climb, Rock Climb can be found on the way to Snowpoint City. Try to find a house in the route in which there is a huge blizzard.

HxC7uvAPaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  This sounds like a fun project/assignment!<br>  <br>  Maybe you could do a version of Monopoly, but use your favorite street names (for instance: instead of Park Place, use 'Jessica Place'); or instead of hotels, etc., sell your favorite stores or something.  Your fake money can have your picture on it (or, to save paper, make a fake credit card); the game pieces can be little objects that you like or maybe charms or something that has your style.<br>  <br>  There are probably newer boardgames, but I'm Old Skool, and Monopoly, Life, and Candy Land are all I can think of at the moment. LOL :)<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I know you don't want to copy a board game, but I think if you put your own personal twist or style into a popular or commonly known game, it could showcase your creativity, and end up being really fun!|`|UVUYG5jaaa	in the simpsons, homer invented "scrabbleship" a combination of scrabble and battleship...i laughed for days. anyway, be creative|`|r3dBnGYdaa	Like put in like a space called mystery space where you draw a card and some cards are like you failed a test go back 5 spaces or a good card like you graduated from elementary school go ahead 6 spaces. <br>  <br>  I do like a game where theres a hundred spaces and you have to reach the end GOOD LUCK!
U9iTDxspaa	Nope but it will eventually slow your game to the point of unplayability.|`|6rAXlNrIaa	There is no max because I own every single spell in the game. And I have create about 60 of my own spells. So you can have as many spells as you want.

3KBlWS7kaa	Well you shouldn't be quitting, but if you really insist on leaving all you need to do is open up the menu and go to dashboard and then restart the game|`|j0vE91afaa	The best way is to unplug the Ethernet cable, plug it back in and sign-in|`|UYEuqEp7aa	Smash a hand grenade in the disk tray and run away.

QoaaqNbQaa	i think WEP is the only way, unless you can find a MAC input on the wii. sorry bro.
wyNvKrQmaa	Yeah, you can play splitscreen, and also system link (connecting two Xbox's together).    It also depends on what game, some games will let you play co-op story, others will let you play against each other. Check the back of the box to see, before you buy it.|`|qUuafpuwaa	You can't unless you but the mulitplayer addition for the 360, that'll set you back $50.00, but it'll let you play up to 4 players.|`|6mG9nLjgaa	The only thing you can do if you don't wanna do online is split screen in games or full screen in games such as smack down vs raw 2009 split screen would be like halo and stuff|`|nuCXcLUIaa	Depending on the game.  Some have offline co-op or versus.|`|aZ9CGbYoaa	only split screen with poeple who are physically with you|`|PNxk3aR6aa	If the game supports offline multiplayer then yes, or playing co-op. It all depends on the game. You can also do system link.|`|6STxgw9laa	You will not be able to play other people in different places, but if you have more than one controller you can do offline co-operation with your friends in most games (split screen).      You can also do System Link, which allows you to connect with other Xbox's within a 100m radius of yours.    Hope I helped!
CWUb6eTWaa	Star Trek Online is probably going to be similar to World of Warcraft with a monthly fee attached. I would of preferred it to be free rather than to pay like $30 or so a month. I am not too sure on how there going have the gameplay with who does what and everything. I am wondering about that part myself. It is going to be interesting how they are going to have the gameplay and how its going to be structured.
q6OAn4UAaa	Listen, that's a great team. But you see, I don't think you should have a grass guy in there. They're weak to so much, I think that they are very tough to train. My neighbors and i kind of made a system. we each took our favorite type of pokemon and made "Gyms". I had the electric gym, so whenever somebdoy would challenge me, I'd have all Electric pokemon, and i had a few other types too. We even printed out our own badges and stuff too. We trained them all from level one. Except the legendaries. Basically, if you do this, you'll realize that battling through all of these people will give you a good idea of what a cooperative team is. My pokemon for the electric gym were.....<br>  <br>  1. Ampharos.<br>  I don't remember their moves, but Ampharos was always my best. <br>  <br>  2. Raiku.<br>  He's a beast, but he's too slow.<br>  <br>  3. Jolteon.<br>  He's very fast, and has a good set of moves.<br>  <br>  4. Zapdos.<br>  He gets raped by rock moves, but flying moves really come in handy.<br>  <br>  5. Manectric.<br>  He looks pretty average, but if you buy the calciums and stuff, INSANE.<br>  <br>  6. Electrive.<br>  He has a great ability, but he's too slow for my taste.<br>  <br>  <br>  I really hope this helps, and it'll give you some ideas if you get bored. e-mail me if you wanna battle. i restarted a few months ago, so im not as strong. but i really wanna find a good friend, that doesnt suck. thanks.|`|AKZUkU0xaa	i would switch out gyarados for weavile since weavile is fast and pretty cool.(not that i like ou pokemon) pretty good team but i would be able to rate better if you pu on the items. another thing is skarmory completely walls torterra and i don't think it was a good idea to make a physical crobat you should get rid of brave bird and give it sludge bomb since it doesn't have that great of an attack stat. the natures arent that great either though. a jolly gyarados wouldnt really help because it has sorta low speed anyhow. and leafeon would need to be something with a high attack stat like adamant because swords dance leaf blade, baton pass, and another attack of your choice is evil|`|pTg18froaa	10 out of 10 very impressive!|`|0IEzZUXbaa	Get red of crobat<br>  <br>  put in empoleon for more ice/water<br>  <br>  <br>  I also recommend a flygon or dragonite|`|jenujl8waa	well remove your torterra because you have already a ground there the garchomp there torterra and garchomp are super effective with ice gyarados is super effective with electric attack and you have already 2 flying type so get rid of one of the flying type well remove gyarados and if you want to build a nice team more again then go to this site and check there your current team <a href="http://pokemon.marriland.com/diamond_pearl/team_builder/" rel="nofollow">http://pokemon.marriland.com/diamond_pea...</a>

Rd9QMpZLaa	the obvious choice has to be tentacruel. its has more uses than golduck, Tentacruel is great in Diamond because posion moves like sludgebomb are now special and tentacruel's  Sp atk is higher than its attack. its got better speed, special defense and the same hp as golduck but its also got a great typing that only gives it 3 weaknesses against golduck2s 2 but it has more resistances.|`|SOxdyWQOaa	golduck|`|bMOZR3lIaa	choose golduck  its a speedy pokemon that can land a good hit|`|jK7pklCKaa	I prefer tentacruel and i actually have one in my hail team and he helps a lot.|`|gfOTV4UMaa	the better one to have is a golduck! it has psychic powers and water powers, it is awesome! Tentacruel is not open to as many attacks and its stats are lower than golducks|`|exedgfjbaa	Golduck because you need Dig,Psychic,Ice beam(Unless there a better ICE move) and a water move Which can KO Tentacruel,Flying,poison,rock,etc of the 4 type combinations and if you want Golduck to be the best than train it very well(Don't use any rare candy is a ripe off stat booster every time your pokemon level up) I learned that if you use strength  (One of the HM moves) than that will really help your pokemon stats go up higher than usually pokemon.   I have a level 100 pikachu with 265 hp the defense and special attack is higher than resister pokemon and the one's who use rare candy|`|GRzcARU8aa	Both are appropriate to Surf on, but a Golduck has more HP and takes less EXP to train.
