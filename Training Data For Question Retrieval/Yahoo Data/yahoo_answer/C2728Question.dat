20090309175444AAqkCcW	Pets;Dogs	What should I name my new pup?	my mom brought a puppy that came to our doorstep yesterday to the groomers and vet, then went to the animal control in my town. my moms friend works for them and she told her that basically, the dog we had found was NOT a stray. but it was being abused by its owner (who has five other dogs. he lets them roam around the streets freely and is really mean and hurtful to the. they know who the guy is) and then, she proceeded to tell her that, if in fact this owner does NOT reclaim this puppy within 10 days, we can keep her! and they said they highly doubt he will go looking for her, because he doesn't really care about his pets. :(      so, all in all, i most likely have an awesome new puppy =] but -- i don't know what to name her! she's a 2 yr old golden shih tzu. this is her:    http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c93/ha...       these are my name options:   Hazel   Bella   Thai   Ohana   Apple   Karma   Delilah   Sherbert         please vote?!

20090309175508AA9v4lx	Pets;Dogs	I was petting my dog while my boyfriend was holding him and all the sudden he growled at me and almost bit me!?	I told my boyfriend to put him down and I told my dog for being bad! And my boyfriend just said "no Tigger no." So then I told my boyfriend don't pick him up he needs to know he was bad! But he thinks that I should praise him since he stopped and can be picked up and I said no he's not learning from what he did! So who right? By the way our dog is almost 3 years old and he is a Jack Russell and I don't pick him up like a poodle like my boyfriend does plus he's 20lbs.    And yes I love my dog but I don't baby him and carry him around the house but I do play with him and take him for walks.

20090309180319AAo2C54	Pets;Birds	Is it safe for my parakeet...?	to fly around my room? He's not completely tame yet so he's still getting used to being on my finger, when he gets scared he kinda flies off and around my room. I noticed though he can't really get to where he's aiming. He runs into my TV or the cage or my bed, things like that, like he can't fly high enough or something but he hits them semi hard. It worries me because it seems like that could hurt him. Can it? Is it normal for them to do that? I want to let him fly around my room so he can get his exercise, but not if there is a good chance he can get hurt.

Yesterday I noticed a bare patch of skin on my cat's neck and a deep sore about the size of a nickel right in the middle of the hairless patch that looked like it went through to his throat.  The soar was open without a scab and it appeared to have a sticky yellow pus layer over it.  He's an adult male outdoor cat - 3 years old.  he also had two other bare patches on him, but no other sores.  Anyone have any idea what this could be?  Thanks for your time, God bless!
20090309180512AAtEjQq	Pets;Dogs	Is it just me, or do dogs just smell bad all the time?	Okay, another freaky question! So, dogs, to me they stink. Horribly.   I want to know if it's just me. Even when a dog is all clean, they still stink. Is it some weird natural thing or if it just the scent emitted by dogs. My cats don't smell bad, they have a whole diffrent smell entirely!     And also, is it just me, or do people have their own smell? Like I'll go   to my friend's house, and it'll smell diffrent then my own.    Thanks!   ~Megan

20090309180921AA3EvrY	Pets;Dogs	My 12 year old golden retreiver.?	My golden retreiver was 12 years old when she was diagnosed with a lipoma.  Since the lipoma was located in her neck, I didn't want to remove it.  But it grew fast and became infected.  I took her to the vet and he said I should remove it.  When she came out of her surgery, she was bleeding alot through her tubes.  The vet told me that it was normal and if I was concerned to take her to ER.  My husband and I got her home and decided to take her to ER.  Her vital signs were good, so we brought her home at 2am. The next morning I woke up around 4:40am and found her unresponsive with her mouth open a little.  We took her back to ER and they were shocked because she died.  She had a small amount of electrical signal. I'm so upset and haven't sleep in a week.  I feel guilty for not leaving her at the ER.  I hope she did not suffer.  The vet told me that she probably didn't suffer because she was on pain meds and anesthia.  It turned out from the biopsy report that her tumor was a subcantaneious hemangioma sarcoma.  How could this happen?  I miss her so much that it so hard for me to describe.  Do you think that dogs die in their sleep?

So my 4 month old dog is going to be doing cani-cross (this is when they run in front of you in training for dog sledding) and I would be running her on snow/grass. If I did run her on the side, she would be running a bit on pavement the other on hard dirt. If I ran her on the pavement/dirt could she get dysplasia or would it hurt her in ANY way? If I ran her on the grass/snow would she be great, like she was a grown dog on pavement?      I don't want her at ANY risk of anything as much as I physically can, so grass/snow or pavement/dirt be ok too?      I know this is alot of q's, but I don't want to hurt her.

I am immensely worried about her health. When the intestines get clogged, waste accumulates, expands the intestines, and can cause death. Could the plastic wrap get stuck there? Do you know of any symptoms as to this? She is resting more than usual, and her breathing is more shallow, not as deep as it usually is. This could be a dangerous matter if I don't figure this out. Should I check her into an animal hospital just to be on the safe side?    Greatly appreciated!!!

I want a dog that can be good in a house, I have a back yard so if I   cannot walk it because of whatever reasons I can just play with it in my   yard.   It needs to be able to withstand weather conditions of hot and cold.   And i will be leaving it home alone a few hours when i go to work    so i need a dog who is fine with that.      thanks for reading all those, please find an answer if you can   Thanks!

20090309182832AARScZy	Pets;Cats	Cats attitude toward the other after vet visit? Please help?	Okay, so, I have two cats who are brother and sister, Chip and Sasha. So, Chip had to go to the vets office on friday because he had been throwing up. He ended up having to get surgery to remove a plant he had eaten. So, he had to have that done. We were supposed to pick him up on Saturday, but he was running a fever. The vets allowed us to bring Sasha in to see him, but she hissed and was very mean, so we brought her home. When we brought Chip home on Monday, after he had been cleaned and he was all better then, we let him out to see Sasha. Sasha hissed at him some more. Every time Chip comes near her she growls or hisses. Does she not remember him? Or is it because she's scared? Why is she being mean to him? Please, please help??

So are puggles ( i know i said it) prone to getting attached and if not got any tips to get it attached. lol  I know sounds kind of weird but i just want a dog of my own iv never  had the expirence  before.

20090309192740AAc6nVO	Pets;Fish	My fish makes a lot of mess in the tank!?	I have a fish that eats the algae in the tank.  I really have no idea what kind of fish he is, but he's black with spots and he's about 4-5 inches long.  He does an excellent job of keeping the tank algae-free.  He's constantly sucking on the plants or the side of the glass.  But he really poops a LOT!!!  It's pretty gross to clean and I need to vacuum/siphon the gravel out quite often (like every 1-2 weeks).  I have two other smaller fish in there too, one harlequin and one goldfish.  Am I feeding them too much and the big guy just eats a lot, or maybe because he is so large, this is normal?  Any ideas?  Thanks!!
20090309194203AAUw83x	Pets;Dogs	I am looking for a specific breed of dog?	The other day I was at the beach, and I saw the most adorable dog. It was white with a little black tail. The owner said that it probably won't get any bigger than around 12 pounds. She told me the breed of the dog, and I remember it started with an "O." Unfortunately, I don't remember the full name. In a way it kind of looks like a terrier. It's very cute, and I would love to know the breed so I can get one. Any input would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.
20090309201635AABnoUr	Pets;Dogs	Any suggestions on what kind of dog I should get?	I am considering (key word) getting a dog right now. I live in a one bedroom apartment with my fiance. I work night shifts; I can be home during the day, and I stay up late because I get off late. Obviously, I would need a relatively small dog. I would also like one who trains easily. For instance, I don't want a dog I have to lock up. Recently, I have been looking at the Havanese breed. What do you guys think, and what experiences have you had?      Note: Please don't tell me to go to the pound. The only thing I have found there are very large dogs, and our apartment is not even close to big enough.

I was looking around at a few different breeder's pages, ads, etc. why are so many dogs that are retired show dogs not housebroken? if the dog is a part of the family like they claim and not just used as breeding stock, how can it not be? a responsible owner won't breed a male until it's about 1 and a female until it's about 2. but they have retired show/breeding dogs ranging from 3+ years of age that aren't house broken..i'd be going out of my mind if my dog wasn't housebroken by then
20070630234946AAvuGwk	Pets;Dogs	Debarking a dog?	i went online to review my state and county laws since i own a pit i always have to keep current to protect my boy. one of my state laws says if you get a pit debarked the dog will be taken away, put to sleep the the owner would get a felony charge.      organisations have strongly opposed debarking. Those who have the procedure done claim their dogs are non-responsive to other therapies. There have been no demonstrated psychological impacts on debarked dogs. The procedure is illegal in the UK      now i don't want to debark my dogs. none of my dogs bark much but that has been a bit of training on my part for some of them. there is a debate going about whether it's cruel or not as no one seems to have any real proof on the subject. has anyone debarked their dog? would any of you consider debarking?

My wife and I have been contemplating for three or four months now about getting a puppy (dachshund) and have finally decided we're ready for the responsibility.  Here's my question...is it a bad idea to buy a puppy that is unpapered? I have seen both parents (on site) and both look purebred, but I know that could mean nothing. Now, I will NEVER breed the puppy, and WILL NEUTER the little guy as soon as is safe WITHOUT QUESTION!!!  So help me out here please. Are the papers a neccesity? We're looking for a house pet, nothing more. I've heard alot of conflicting information so I'm hoping someone can clear it up for me.
