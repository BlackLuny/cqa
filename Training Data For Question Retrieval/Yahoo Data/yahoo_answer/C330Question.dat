20080928183820AAGyC23	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	Is it possible to pick the greatest guitar player of all time?	There are so many different styles of guitar playing that it is nearly impossible to pick just one that would be qualified as the best ever.  There is Jimmy Page (Led Zeppelin), Jimmy Hendrix, Eddie Van Halen (Van Halen), Slash (Guns n' Roses), David Gilmour (Pink Floyd) hell about one hundred that could be on the list.  My question, is it even possible to pick one guitarist over another or are you picking your favorite style of playing.  For example, Eddie has a pretty unique style of different affects mixed in with a whole mess of stuff, Slash shreds and mixes some melody in, and Jimmy Page takes a whole different road and does mostly melody.      MQ: Can you pick one guitar god over another just because of your personal preference?      BQ: Name your top 5 favorite guitarists?

If you like the R&P (or other) user, then give them a thumbs up.   If you dislike them, give them a thumbs down.       to be perfectly clear - do NOT judge them on the musician they put. Judge them on whether or not you like the person who posts it.
20081006165926AACdMkF	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Is it too much to ask for your help?	I'm a freshman, and I really didn't know anyone when I stated school. The thing is, I think I made friends with the wrong people. Not that they aren't nice, they just aren't good influences. Their language is almost always vulgar, they use God's name in a way I don't like, they talk about sex as if it's no big deal, and they smoke.      Should I stay friends with them? I really don't want to hurt them, especially when they are among my only friends. But I think that they aren't good for me to be around with. If you don't think I should still be friends with them, how do I stop without being mean?

20081013131007AAlmnw7	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	R&P,can we stop using the "S" word?	This is random, but do you think that maybe it's time we stopped saying that bands suck, and we could just say that we don't like them? It really is very rude and annoying to hear people say that your bands suck. It would really just be a lot better to respect other people's opinions and just say that you don't like them. Saying they're overrated is alright, though.

20081013150016AAyE7aU	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	Is there a certain song that helps pull you through a tough time?	I just listened to "Running on Empty" by Jackson Browne, and I could relate pretty much every line to the situation I seem to be stuck in.  Especially with my three best friends leaving for college, the line "I look around for the friends I used to turn to to pull me though, looking into thier eyes I see them running too" really hit me. Taken kind of literally, we are all track runners and they were basically my family. Sorry to ramble but do you have a song that kinda pulls you through?

20081015041917AAWUPo8	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	Bands With Strong/Memorable Personalities?	Very often in your "average" band, the front man is the face & personality of the band.       Can you think of any bands where all or most of the *other* members had almost as much, if not as much press & face time as the front man?      Most obvious one in my book would be The Fab 4. I mean, who *didn't* know John, Paul George *and* Ringo?? Eventually, fans even assigned them their now well known personas. (eg: The Smart One, the Quiet One, etc)      The Who & Zeppelin I think are others.          BQ:       Best rock sidemen? These are the unsung musicians, singers in a band who are invaluable to the band, but rarely get mentioned.        
20081019003117AA4TBoV	Entertainment & Music;Radio	What was the title of that episode?	Years ago, there was a radio show called "CBS Mystery Theatre", and it was hosted by E.G. Marshall.

Later, the police come upon the old woman and ask her about the 3 fugitives and she claims not to have seen them. One police officer notices movement in one of her terrariums, she claims that sometimes she picks up all sorts of bugs and things when she digs up the soil.

20081014061801AA8IkOe	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	Your favorite 3 Queen albums and your least favorite? For you Queen fans?	I personally favor, in no order, (as that would be impossible,)   1: A Day At The Races   The first album I bought, I just fell in love with it.   2: A Night At The Opera   Who can fault it? Not just Bo Rap, what about "You're My Best Friend"   3: Sheer Heart Attack   Come on people. "Killer Queen". Must be given some credit, and the awesom Brighton Rock.      My worst, though, has to be Hot Space. Sure, I loved "Life Is Real", but that'd be it. I've always disliked under pressure.      And please people, not being abusive. I am a true Queen fan, and these are simply my opinions.   The simple thing is, Queen are the most beautiful 4 people ever to walk the earth. Simple.
20081016043315AA8YWB7	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	Queen Fans: Would John Deacon have made much of a different on The Cosmos Rocks had he been invovled in it?	John Deacon, Queen's "quiet man" has wrote quite a few songs for Queen, was always just doing his thing, and he made some excellent bass lines, such as that the one in Breakthru and Crazy Little Thing Called Love, but would his influence have made much of a difference on the new Queen album?      I think it could have been justified MORE as a Queen album, since alot of it is really just Paul Rodgers with half of Queen a backing band, and I think alot of the songs would have been alot more like they used to be, though never completely so with the absence of Freddie.   I personally adore "Say It's Not True" off the album, it's balladic and everything Queen was.      Your opinions on if Deacon WOULD have made an impact, if you please.

20081007184026AAKCf7q	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	Ahhhh, WHICH GUITAR!!?	I am torn between a Fender American Standard Sunburst and an Ibanez RG 1570.  I have always wanted a Fender just because they do sound good and no collection is complete without a strat.  But on the other hand, that Ibanez sounds nice and I like its tremelo.  I play stuff like Green Day, Blink 182, The Offspring, CKY, Avenged Sevenfold, System of a Down, Audioslave, and Breaking Benjamin.  I have a distortion pedal, so the distortion sound shouldn't be an issue.  Which one should I get for Christmas?

We had our own machines at the last complex we lived in but this time we have a laundry room. I thought I couldn't live without our own machines but it turns out this is a great way to do it. Not having a dishwasher and washer and dryer is going to cut down on the water and electric bills! Lol.

20081107164437AAVUgNZ	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Should the The Shining be remade?	The original with Jack Nicholson is one of the most overrated horror movies of all time. The acting is atrocious. Jack Nicholson was way too over the top too soon, and Shelley Duvall's acting was unbearable. Plus the movie barely resembled the essence of the book. (only 30 percent of the content in the movie was in the book).      I think it would be neat to have Christian Bale as Jack Torrence, Naomi Watts as Wendy, and Morgan Freeman as Dick Hollorann.    David Fincher should direct it (Zodiac, Seven, Big Fish), and Howard Shore should do the music.      What do you think? Would it be better than the original?

20081104214113AACQcGH	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	Why didn't Nightranger make it bigger?	I know they have more than one good song, but a lot of people consider them a one hit wonder because of Sister Christian.      Just listening to that song, I wonder why they weren't bigger.  The vocals are very good in my opinion, and the guitar was good.  I don't know a whole lot about them, so I was just wondering if any of you guys knew?
20081021211158AAcMboS	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	OK, the year is 1978.  Ann Wilson, Nancy Wilson, or Stevie Nicks?	Whose number are you trying to get?      MQ: Favorite Bad Company song?

Blige    Aaliyah    Amy Lee - Evanescence   Christina Aguilera    Bryan Adams    Steve Wonder    Morrissey - The Smiths   Rick Astley    Mike Patton - Faith No More   Perry Farrell - Jane's Addiction   Phil Anselmo - Pantera   Anthony Kiedis - Red Hot Chilli Peppers   Robert Plant - Led Zeppelin   Bj?rk   Bono - U2   Bruce Dickinson - Iron Maiden   Sebastian Bach - Skid Row   Lynae Stanley    Ronnie James Dio - Dio   Lenny Kravitz   Ian Gillan - Deep Purple   Axl Rose - Guns N Roses   Roger Daltrey - The Who   Paul McCartney - The Beatles   Michael Jackson    Paul Rodgers - Bad Company   Brad Delp - Boston   Lou Gramm - Foreigner   Mick Jagger - The Rolling Stones   David Bowie    Steven Tyler - Aerosmith   Jim Morrison - The Doors   Brian Johnson - AC/DC   Ozzy Osbourne - Black Sabbath   Kurt Cobain - Nirvana   Sting - The Police   Dee Snyder - Twisted Sister   Gene Simmons - Kiss

I know, I left out a lot of good singers, but Ann is one of my favorites.      ALSO, I deleted round 4 to avoid confusion with this new round and also I didn't want to pick a best anymore lol.
20081028152105AAusXGz	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	Best Singer Debate. Round 3.?	I'm speeding up the process a bit, there are a lot of singers to weed out still, so I will do one more round today.      Same rules apply, pick the FIVE singers you feel SHOULD NOT move on.      Freddie Mercury   Steve Perry   Amy Lee   Bryan Adams   Stevie Wonder   Morrissey   Mike Patton   Perry Farrell   Phil Anselmo   Anthony Kiedis   Robert Plant   Bruce Dickinson   Sebastian Bach   Lynae Stanley   Ronnie James Dio   Lenny Kravitz   Ian Gillan   Axl Rose   Roger Daltrey   Paul McCartney   Paul Rodgers   Brad Delp   Lou Gramm   Mick Jagger   David Bowie   Steven Tyler   Jim Morrison   Brian Johnson   Ozzy Osbourne   Kurt Cobain   Sting   Thom Yorke   Liam Gallagher   Elton John   Chris Cornell   Roger Waters      Last round we lost:   Christina Aguilera   Aaliyah   Bono   Mary J.

20081027235456AAcZFRb	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	Let's try and settle an age old debate.  Best singer ever.?	OK, let's do it like this.      You guys give me your pick for best singer/front man of all time.  I will use these names to form a list, and every day we will weed out certain singers by means of voting.      If someone already put down your favorite, then give a thumbs up so I can gauge it a little easier.  Keep the thumbs down out of play too.      Let's see if we can't come to a general conclusion here.
20081101141955AATaLoO	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	Best Singer Ever. RESULTS!!!?	Wow, when I started this, I really underestimated the hassle it would be lol.  We went from 46 singers of all diffent areas (Vanilla Ice) down to one.      So who did the people of R&P pick as the greatest singer of all time?      None other than....      Freddie Mercury of Queen.      Thanks again to everyone who participated, and now we can rest the debate!      MQ: Favorite song that Freddie Mercury sang?
20081030194535AAES82j	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	Queen vs Queen.  A Night at The Opera vs A Day at The Races?	I'm not going to bother asking which one is better, because A Night at the Opera is probably Queen's best album ever.        I want to know which one you personally prefer.

20081025211401AAOnWtH	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	Have you ever listened to a song and just....wanted whoever was making that noise...?

Same goes for Freddie Mercury...  : )
20081025173917AAFRCSE	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	Debut Albums VS Last Albums?	Correct me if I made a mistake on any of these, but do you prefer these band's debut albums or their final work?         Led Zeppelin or In Throught The Out Door   High Voltage or Black Ice (ACDC)   Aerosmith or Honkin' on Bobo    Queen I or Made In Heaven   Please Please Me or Let It Be   Rush or Snakes and Arrows   Bob Dylan or Modern Times   Greetings From Asbury Park, NJ or Magic  (Bruce Springsteen)   Fresh Cream or Goodbye   Journey or Trial By Fire (It's the last with Steve Perry)   David Bowie or Reality   On Through the Night or Songs from The Sparkle Lounge (Def Leppard)   The Piper At The Gates Of Dawn or The Division Bell   Their Satanic Majesties Request or Bridges To Babylon (Rolling Stones)   Appetite For Destruction or Chinese Democracy (LMAO)         Honestly, I pretty much like everyone's earlier work....

20081020170145AAkCxoY	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Twilight fans: what would you do if...?	Let's play pretend now (I'm bored). Okay, pretend that right now, at this very moment, while you're on Y!A, the doorbell rings, but you're busy answering a question so you let your mom get it. The door opens, and you hear your mom's voice, and a voice that is so velvety, seductive, and irresistible that it could only belong to ONE person in the entire universe, so you stop what you're doing, and run to the front door. Sure enough, standing there, on the other side of the threshold, is Edward Cullen in all his glory. Now what? What do you say/do?      Me, I would shove Mom aside and throw myself at him and kiss him (never mind the fact that Mom's watching). Kiss first, ask questions later ;)   For those of you who have morals and ethical values and all that stuff, Bella is OUT of the equation! No Bella! Edward came here because he wants YOU!

I just watched an episode for the first time, (actually I could only take 7 minutes of it) All those bratty kids did was scream, cry, whine and fight with each other. They are petulant, demanding and insolent. I imagine that they are cute when asleep.    The parents sit there and rehash what we have just seen, their comments to each other are anything but loving. I saw her smack him on the face, and at one point he snarled at her " You don't know what you're talking about". Anyone else find this show annoying, useless and boring? I mean what is the point, and what is up with her hair-do?

20090309223008AAyzRua	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Little johnny learns "interaction" (really funny!)?	One day, little Johnny asked his mom what sex was.    "Tonight, go into your sister’s room, hide behind the curtain, and watch what    she and her boyfriend do.    The following morning, Johnny’s mom asked what happened.    Little Johnny explained "well at first, they were just kinda talking and    laughing, but after a while they started kissing and hugging, sister got a fever,    cuz she said she was feeling hot.    So sister’s boyfriend put his hand under her shirt to find her heart, just    like the doctor would.    Except he’s not so smart because both of them got sick and they started    panting and getting all out of breath.    His other hand must have been cold because he put it under her skirt.    About this time sis got worse and began to moan and sigh, and squirm around    and slide to the end of her bed. then i finally found out what was making them    sick - a big eel had gotten inside her boyfriend’s pants somehow.    It just jumped out of his pants and stood there, about 10 inches long!    anyways he gripped it in one hand to keep it from getting away.    When sis saw it, she got really scared - her eyes got big, and her mouth fell    open, and she started calling to God and stuff like that.    She said it was the biggest one she had ever seen, I should tell her about    the ones by the lake, anyway sis got brave and tried to kill the eel by biting    its head off.    All of a sudden she grabbed it with both hands and tried to keep it from    biting again.    Sis lay back and spread her legs so she could get a scissor-lock on it, and    the boyfriend helped by lying on top of the eel.    The eel put on a heck of a fight. Sis started moaning and squealing and her    boyfriend almost upset the couch. I guess they wanted to kill the eel by    squishing it between them.    After a while, they both stopped moving and gave a great sigh. Her boyfriend    got up, and sure enough they had killed the eel!    I knew because it just hung there and also because some of its insides were    dripping out.    Sis and her boyfriend were a little tired from the battle, but they went back    to the bed anyway!    He started hugging and kissing her again! by golly, the eel wasn’t dead! It    jumped straight up and started to fight again.    I guess eels are like cats-they have nine lives or something like that. this    time, sis jumped up and tried to kill it by sitting on it.    After a 35 minute struggle they finally killed the eel. I knew it was dead    because I saw sis boyfriend peel it’s skin off and flush it down the toilet!"    Little Johnny’s mom fainted

20070628165139AAkedxu	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Se vi piace questa su Pierino accendetemi una stellina se vi va!?	Nella scuola elementare una maestra della prima elementare ha dei problemi con uno dei suoi allievi.   La maestra domanda, "Pierino, qual'e' il problema?"   Pierino risponde "Sono troppo intelligente per stare in prima. Mia Sorella fa la terza ed io sono piu' intelligente di lei ! Credo che dovrei andare anche io in terza !"   La maestra ne ha abbastanza. Porta pierino nell'ufficio del direttore.   Mentre Pierino aspetta nel corridoio la maestra spiega la situazione al direttore.   Il direttore dice alla maestra che mettera' il ragazzo alla prova: gli fara' una serie di domande, se lui sbaglia una qualsiasi delle risposte dovra' tornare in prima e comportarsi bene.   La maestra e' d'accordo. Pierino viene fatto entrare, gli vengono spiegate le condizioni e lui accetta di sottoporsi alla prova.   Direttore "Quanto fa 3 x 3 ?"   Pierino: "9"   Direttore "Quanto fa 6 x 6 ?"   Pierino: "36"   E cosi' via con ogni domanda che il direttore presuppone che un allievo della terza debba conoscere.      Il direttore guarda la maestra e le dice : "credo che Pierino possa andare in terza."   La maestra dice al direttore : "Posso fargli io qualche domanda ?"      Il direttore e Pierino acconsentono.      Maestra "Una mucca ne ha quattro ma io ne ho solo due, che cosa sono?"   Pierino: "Le gambe"   Maestra "Cosa c'e' nei tuoi pantaloni ma non c'e' nei miei ?"   Il direttore si domanda come mai la maestra faccia una simile domanda!   Pierino: "Le tasche"   Maestra "Che cos'e' che inizia per 'C', finisce per 'O', e' peloso, saporito e contiene un liquido biancastro ?" Gli occhi del direttore si spalancano prima che lui possa fermare la risposta...   Pierino: "il cocco"   Maestra "Che cos'e' che entra duro e rosato ed esce molle ed appiccicoso?"   Pierino: "la gomma da masticare"   Maestra "Che cos'e' che un uomo fa in piedi, una donna da seduta ed un cane su tre gambe ?"   Gli occhi del direttore si spalancano ancora di piu' prima che lui possa fermare la risposta...   Pierino: "stringere la mano"   Maestra "Ora ti faro' alcune domande del tipo 'Chi sono io', d'accordo?"   Pierino: "D'accordo !"   Maestra "Infili dei paletti dentro di me. Mi leghi a terra prima di montarmi. Sono bagnata prima che tu abbia finito."   Pierino: "la tenda"   Maestra "Un dito entra dentro di me. Giochi con me quando ti annoi. Rimango con te per tutta la vita."   Il direttore guarda irrequieto e teso ma...   Pierino: "l'anello nuziale"   Maestra "Esisto in diverse misure. Quando non sto bene sgocciolo. Quando mi togli il liquido ti senti bene."   Pierino: "il naso"   Maestra "Ho un corpo affusolato e rigido. La mia punta e' penetrante. Sto spesso in un astuccio."   Pierino: "la freccia"   Maestra "Quale parola inzia con 'SC', finisce con 'E' e significa un sacco di divertimento?"   Pierino: "scherzare"   Il direttore tira un sospiro di sollievo e dice alla maestra: "Sbattilo in quinta : le ultime dieci risposte le ho sbagliate persino io!"

Bonjour à tous,      Je ne sais pas si vous avez remarqué mais on regarde un programme "normal" à la télé (les infos, la météo, une série, un film...) et qu'arrive le moment de la publicité, le volume est alors beaucoup plus fort...   Alors je me disais : c'est quoi l'intérêt ?   Si c'est pour que les gens écoutent les publicités c'est pas gagné car au contraire les gens ont le réflexe de couper le son, ou de le baisser, et généralement ?a énerve de devoir faire ?a à chaque fois qu'il y a de la publicité.   Donc je me demandais vraiment quel intérêt ?a avait puisqu'on baisse ou qu'on coupe le son car il est trop fort, ou alors ?a nous énerve.

It used to play on my local radio often and I've been trying to remember what the lyrics were entirely and who sang it for years now. It... is not going so well, as one may imagine.      It was sung by a woman, just of a deeper voice. Was a rock song. I think the chorus lyrics had something to do with rocks? Maybe being drug under water or something? And I think the verses maybe mentioned cereal or something in it somewhere? Perhaps not, but I'm just entirely unware of this song after five years at least. I just want to know what it was.      I can't really provide anymore hints than those, so I'm really sorry. It was popular in the late 90's, perhaps early 2000's? Maybe even before? Please help?

20081027130719AAe7aVC	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	My R&P guitarist friends: a guitar question?	I've been playing guitar for a little while now, and I thought it was time to buy one. I went to the Guitar Center yesterday to check some out. Being loyal to Fender (my bass is a '51 Precision reissue; it's incredible) I stuck mainly to their products. I tried a Telecaster, which I didn't really like, a Strat which was pretty good, and a Jaguar which I loved. It really felt like MY guitar, you know? But I digress. Anyway, the problem is that while you can find a cheap Strat, the cheapest jaguar I found (looking online) was around $600. So, do any of you know any guitars that have a similar sound and feel that I could get cheaper?      MQ: Do you ever long for the days of the vinyl record?   BQ: Do you watch/enjoy Family Guy? I already asked this as a BQ, but only one person (thanks, Gibbersish) answered the question.      Feel free just to answer the MQ and BQ.

Given this prognosis, Ralph asks his wife for sex. Naturally, she agrees, and they make love.    About six hours later, the husband goes to his wife and says, 'Honey, you know I now have only 18 hours to live. Could we please do it one more time?' Of course, the wife agrees and they do it again.    Later, as the man gets into bed, he looks at his watch and realizes he now has only 8 hours left. He touches his wife's shoulder and asks, 'Honey, please - just one more time before I die ?'    She says, 'Of course, dear.' And they make love for the third time.    After this session, the wife rolls over & falls asleep. Ralph, however, worried about his impending death, tosses &    turns until he's down to 4 more hours. He taps his wife, who rouses. 'Honey, I have only 4 more hours. Do you think we could....?'    At this point the wife rolls over and says, 'Listen Ralph, I have to get up in the morning... you don't.

20081025214308AAYGBMk	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	A whole different perspective on Guitar Hero.  (Not actually about video games)?	Maybe I'm alone on this, but maybe instead of saying Guitar Hero is horrible and a downfall for music, did you ever think it may actually inspire some people to take up real guitar?      Granted, there will always be those who think they can play guitar just because they can play the game, but my thinking is it may actually inspire some younger kids to pick up the real thing and shred like the rest of us.      Am I wrong in this?

I think it is about time we include him in our ever popular "best guitarists" questions.      What do you think of him?

20090309172637AAAN4Gx	Entertainment & Music;Horoscopes	Psychic help about a possible spirit?	Hi psychics. I would just like the know if I'm being haunted, in simple terms. Is there a pirit in my house? If so, who is it? What does it want? How can I help it?      There have been many strange occurances in my house, but the most recent one is a little bizzare.      Yesterday my family and I were eating Chinese food when, all of the sudden, Spanish music starts playing REALLY loudly. My dad and I go upstairs, and I find that the music is coming from my sister's room. I go to her clock radio that I gave to her earlier that week, and try to find out why is started playing the music. It wasn't set to an alarm, but it was still playing the radio! Then, all I did was touch the front part of it, not even pushing a button, and then it just stopped. It stopped just like that.      Also, the other day I confronted the spirit, asking if it was here or what they wanted. For the rest of the day I was seeing shadows from people who weren't there!!      And now my mom just told me that her show [Guiding Light] wasn't taping. She said that she had it set before she left for work [7:30 AM] but it didn't tape, and she's the last to leave the house.       Here are some other instances in my past questions. Here are the links to previous questions:       http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...       and       http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...       Thank you!!

20081001165600AAkstVy	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	I just learned that the lead singer of one of my favorite rock bands, Boston, passed away last year. Why?	Brad Delp was not your run of the mill rock star. He cared about the fans and was a great guy. He didn't live in a mansion. He didn't throw his success in peoples faces. He was involved in many charity organizations. Anybody who met him always had a kind word to say. What was troubling him so much that he felt there was no choice but to take his own life? I don't understand.

20070810015946AAl6XQG	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Nine words women use...  and belive to be true?	1.) Fine : This is the word women use to end an argument when they are    right and you need to shut up.       2.) Five Minutes : If she is getting dressed, this means a half an hour.    Five minutes is only five minutes if you have just been given five more    minutes to watch the game before helping around the house.       3.) Nothing : This is the calm before the storm. This means something,    and you should be on your toes. Arguments that begin with nothing    usually end in fine.       4.) Go Ahead : This is a dare, not permission. Don't Do It!       5.) Loud Sigh : This is actually a word, but is a non-verbal statement    often misunderstood by men. A loud sigh means she thinks you are an    idiot and wonders why she is wasting her time standing here and arguing    with you about nothing. (Refer back to #3 for the meaning of nothing.)       6.) That's Okay : This is one of the most dangerous statements a wom a n    can make to a man. That's okay means she wants to think long and hard    before deciding how and when you will pay for your mistake.       7.) Thanks : A woman is thanking you, do not question, or Faint. Just say    you're welcome.       8.) Whatever : Is a women's way of saying F@!K YOU!       9.)

20090309213448AAFPqUA	Entertainment & Music;Music;Classical	"Disturbing/eerie" classical music titles/composers?	This is a question that's mainly for seasoned classical-music listeners (it's in there somewhere...):      I've always loved Camille Saint-Saens' piece of music called "Danse Macabre" (if you haven't heard it I'm sure you could "youtube" it).  I still consider it to be just as eerie now as the first time I'd heard it.        Apparently it was pretty eerie when it was first performed as well:  the Wiki page for Saint-Saens' "Danse Macabre" says, "When [it] first premiered, it was not received well. Audiences were quite unsettled by the disturbing, yet innovative, sounds that Saint-Sa?ns elicited."      I assume listening to classical music enough allows one to have an ear for knowing what musical works were more or less mainstream or inventive comparatively.        Question: Are there any other classical works that were considered disturbing/eerie like this, at the time they were first performed publicly?  In other words, do you know of any works which stood out against their contemporaries as being disturbing/eerie?      I guess it doesn't REALLY have to be disturbing, maybe simply surreal or weird.  It's just that I DO tend to have a taste for the darker things within the realm of the arts, hehe...      Thanks a lot!

20090309214137AAp2S9I	Entertainment & Music;Movies	The Watchmen: did you find any messages?	I found the little messages in the movie to be quite interesting. There's a Rockefeller military complex in the movie. The Batman looking guy's dad was a corporate banker and the Batman looking guy is friends with the guy who sets nukes at major population centers, blames it on an outside threat, and unites the world. It really puts me in mind of the conspiracy theories I read about.      The middle name of the comedian is Morgan, another major banker. The last name of the batman dude (i think it was him) is Mason. Freemasons are often in conspiracy theory, although Freemasons are generally good people. Another thing with Freemasons is the symbol of the pyramid and ancient Egypt, which also play a role in the movie with the guy that set off the nukes.

I texted him and said I was sorry if I made him embarrassed but he said that I did not.       Is he lying to me? I have never held any other guy's head before while I was kissing him. I wonder if he got scared or afraid. I have not talked to him. Do Virgo guys get scared if a girl kisses them?       What should I do? Was it wrong for me kissing him?

I  anothappointmentment for sunday to see picture and discuss about her marketing tools and some other stuff.    in my initial interview i told the guy to tell me total of expenses, he said it will be under $1000($850-photoshoot, $45 negatives $4.50 -digital composition card), . but i see other people were asked to pay for another  $800 for the a membership with . GIGACOMPS?.com(they told me in initial interview that i will be able to see the composition card online, never  mention any fee for . GIGACOMPS?.com.)      well give me your opinion and advise i will appreciate it.       if u or ur child were scammed by this people or any other model agency let me know. i would like to report this to the authority and see if aspiring models and talents don't get take advantage. It is very difficult to make it on the entertainment business,  let's fight together to make it a little easy to at least get a fair chance.      Good luck to all models and talents!

20090309215106AAmyfb0	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Trying to find a old, possibly Sci-fi movie.?	details are sketchy, but i saw this movie when i was in the second grade, at least 12 years ago. and then oddly enough next grade, 3rd, i had a dream about it and then have been blank ever since.      This is all i remember.      This guy is in a factory of some sort trying to operate some type of little crane or something in a furnace or something from a control booth. He cant operate it right so he goes down to get the thing out manually. he ends up getting locked in the room, and he sees some1 in the control booth and says "get me out" and they leave. The thing that he was trying to get out then overheats or something and basically explodes. then hes brought back to life somehow via some gold NASA looking suit and then is transformed almost into a Robocop type character. He communicates with his wife or ex or someone via her stereo and he sounds like a computer on it. Then when hes chasin the bad guys, one guy stops him and says.      "i have a letter from her. ill leave it right here" he drops it on the center of floor, where he falls through in some kinda liquid and is then frozen in a block of ice. After the bad guys think they got him, he starts to break the ice from within.      Last bit i remember. There were 2 bad guys trying to transform into the type of superobo dude that he was by getting into those gold NASA looking suits, and he ends up killing them by pulling a plug on their suits, while they are transforming, because they are immobile, like hibernating, and their face mask, that they have is then filled with like a white liquid, and they are killed. and then more happens but idk what.         ok any ideas?

Hit pause at 19:22 minutes into the episode. Christina wrote Karev,A across from Res on the surgical board. At 32:37 it says only Karev and it is across from staff. Clearly not what Christina wrote.I know they must have to change the board a lot when shooting different scenes. I have no idea about how real hospitals work now but I can't see why the same name would be rewritten and even in the wrong place. I guess it could have been changed then changed but it was her decision and it definitely seemed final. It was probably second thoughts by the writers but it they should have wrote down the same thing. I know its no big deal, but still, I believe they should have seen this.

I can only think of some of the words/lines, it's a male voice, and some of the words/lines from the song are;  "lately i'm thinking -- the world seems upside down.........or am i dreaming.........lovely lady.............crazy..........all you need". These are just parts of the song, it's an older song, maybe within the past 10 years, for some reason I thought it was the Dave Matthews Band, any help is appreciated.

20090309231718AAMYW9u	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Have you ever ALMOST hit a deer?	Today me and my other two friends were driving out on the country roads. We were going like 100 mph becuase we were chasing these people and passing them (long story) and then they didnt follow us when we turned around so we went back into town. My friend's lights weren't working either, only the brights did (it was night). We were going about 60 mph when my friend shouts out DEER! My friend slams on the brakes and two deer cross RIGHT in front of the car. It was so scary that they almost hit us. Then about a minute later it was really funny.    Have any of you guys had a close call with deer or other animals like this? Was it scary or did you just laugh?

Song is called Railroad Tracks   Quickly turning, to a faded shade of grey   Was just white, only the other day   Hands shaking and grasped, the fear slowly dies   A shadow remains inside      Tied down to the rail road tracks   A frail scream pleads from the mouth   Tied down to the rail road tracks   The lies slowly fade, pleasures merge with pain   Tied down to the rail road tracks   So tight, you can't go back      Time keeps going by, but nothing seems to change   Fraligle words have been broken, actions provoken   A web of life, entangled as pray   Just let the life, the betrayers, the enmines, the friends, all fade away   In a cage, a cage some can't see   In a cage, no one but me   Some stop and stare   Others pretend not to notice, crouched up in their high chair   Some stop and spit, others with more pain to share   Walls tumble down, but still no way out of here      Tied down to the railroad tracks   A grasp of the big picture isn't seen   Tied down to the railroad tracks   Even with someone else beside me   Tied down to the railroad tracks   So tight you can't go back      Some share the pain   Some bear the pain   Others pretend there is none at all   Political ends have fallen, shadows only remain   Of what once was, of what could be   A man so strong, brought to his knees   The day is young, and so are you   No place to hide, left to drown in the great wide blue      Tied down to the railroad tracks   The train approaching at full speed   Tied down to the railroad tracks   Tied down, and holding the rope yourself   Tied down to the railroad tracks   And you won't let go
