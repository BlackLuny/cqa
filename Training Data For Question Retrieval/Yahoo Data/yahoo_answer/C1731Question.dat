With all the love between Hollywood and Obama I will not be amazed if they managed to think up a reason to give him an award. Perhaps it will be for the biggest move to break the bank of the United States but that should go to Pelosi and Reid because all Obama did was sign it into law without reading it like the members of congress did.

20090222164438AA610OP	News & Events;Current Events	Why is it that between friday and sunday this appointment has changed twice?	On whose recommendation are the appointments made and what was wrong with the original replacement?   There has been a lot of activity in the past few days in the insurance sector. Is it prudent to make this appointment at this time to this person? Considering this man's trade union expertise and experience at the electricity board he seems better qualified to hold a different post.     http://www.colombopage.com/archive_09/Fe...    He is by all indicators in the wrong department.Perhaps the vacancy should remain so until the proper candidate is vetted for the post.    http://www.sundaytimes.lk/080601/Financi...    Mr Kariyawasam said alternative energy solutions such as solar, wave, wind, mini hydro, biomass and tidal are extremely costly. The investment cost for 1 MW of installed capacity of solar power is US$10 million. Wave power costs US$4 million per 1 MW, biomass US$3 million, wind US$3 million, mini hydro US$1.5 million and tidal US$4 million. In comparison, diesel and natural gas in internal combustion engines cost US$0.9 million per 1 MW while central generation using fossil fuel costs US$1 million per MW.   I am well aware that the interchangeable Minister Murkherjee is in Colombo this week as I am well aware of the Sampath project which remains unapproved, I am also well aware of Namaste as I am well aware that Murkhejee is not Prime Minister. I understand the world view is skewed at 4'6" but small mindedness and short perception do not have to operate in conjunction with dimunitive stature.  I am also well aware of the recruitment of ex-cons into the US alternative energy sector as it was on the news today, Mr. Murkherjee- the US was so looking forward to having its young, non-criminal proponents of alternative energy working on these federally mandated projects, much more so than building mafias.It is also wise for an external minister of one country to stay out of the internal affairs of its neighbor especially when there are verfiable links of cross border terrorism that span 30 years.  In Sri Lanka we have experienced the devolution of "former terrorists" to mafia elements that still carry on terrorist acts. To that end Mr. Murkherjee I pose the question - What is your involvement with Namaste and was your participation and/or "expertise" requested? For your "expertise",per your designation, in Sri Lanka's internal affairs, foreign policy and national security are not requisite or a pre-requisite to our sovreignity.  Senator McCain, please have a conversation with Vice-president Biden regarding this matter. I had also asked him to pass along information regarding certain Arizona residents that were at 8/27 to your attention.
20090222163648AAvLGHd	News & Events;Media & Journalism	Most memorable world/news events of the 90s ?	your own please, try your best not to use google but if u must then go ahead - to jog your memories.  If you're a prissy little pre-teen born in 1997 avoid this question like the plague, this is aimed at those who are in their late 20s early 30s and beyond.      here are some that sprung to mind.      Pete Sampras and all his grand slam wins.   Death of Princess Diana    Texas Waco incident   Oklahoma bombings   Omagh bombing   World Cup Italia 1990 and Gazza's tears    Gareth Southgate's missed pen vs Germany :-|   Tupac vs Bigge , West Coast vs East Coast, Death Row vs Bad Boy    The Lion King   Wet Wet Wet - Love is All around   Serb-Bosnian War   OJ Simpson killing his wife and kids (did he kill the kids ??)   LA Riots   Florida Floods of 92   Jamie Bulger (RIP sweetheart)      thats top off my head.
20090222161513AAR2jtW	News & Events;Current Events	Why is the terrorist in the news lately so happy as he prepares to go blow himself up on a suicide mission?	I am in shock that this guy is such a happy, good looking young man.   And they taped this & the blowing up of his vehicle...      So I asked God & believe that he was high on drugs. (How else can he be so happy?) But since he is actually being the devils messenger, ends up waking up in hell.      It is so sad that he was so tricked to do this.      Jesus said that hell was prepared for the devil & his messengers.

20090222165020AAJRyKp	News & Events;Current Events	What should be done about marijuana smokers?	I personally think they should be punished as severely as possible. They are more deserving of jail or the death sentence than anyone else because they are hurting themselves, which I believe is worse than hurting another person. Pot smokers are a bunch of yellow-bellied, spineless, laid-back, unmotivated pansy scumbags who have to break the law and ruin their health just to have fun and feel good. Marijuana has been proven to cause lung cancer and brain damage, yet these fools don't care they're messing themselves up. I'm sick of all of these stoners acting all smug and arrogant about how they love to smoke weed and how it should be legal. I also hate how they're sticking up for Michael Phelps and using him as an example of pot being okay to do and how they're boycotting Kellogg's because they're so butthurt about how they dropped his spokesman deal. You know what? **** Phelps! (Or should I say Phelch?) **** the Olympics! Mark Spitz will always be better than him. But getting back to general stoners... I truly believe all non-stoners want to see these walking cesspools thrown in jail or executed. You never hear non-stoners say on TV or anywhere else that pot should be legalized because no such person exists. I also truly believe the world would be a better place if all marijuana users were done away with.

20090222174945AAupjQq	News & Events;Current Events	Should Omar Khadr Be Released?	Should Omar Khadr Be Released   this is a question that is particularily important in question   if you want backround info on Omar Khadr and what he did look here...       http://davidakin.blogware.com/blog/_arch...       basically he was born in Canada, he joined a terroist group and grenaded US soilders in Afghanistan      he was captured and was sent to Guantanimo      now that Obama is closing Guantanimo down the Canadaian government does not know what to do with him      the reason being is because Canada signed a UN protocal which basically states that anyone under the age of 18 no matter if they are in a terroist group or not are considered victoms      so what should Canada do, should they realse Omar Khadr with nothing at all      or should Canada too should punish Omar Khadr      arguments on release include    1. he was only 15 when he was sent to guantanimo   2. he has been punished enough   3. It was canada's fault in the beginning for allowing the United States deal with Omar Khadr and not dealing with the problem themselves      arguments against his release include   1.what he did was wrong therefore he should be punished   2.There is too much evidence against Khadr to release him   3.Canada looks soft, and should exercise its power to prove that Canada does have restrictions and is not so soft   4.Need to keep good relations with allies (United States)   5.We need to respect the legitament concearns of the citizens of Canada and protect their rights      i know i know these arguments are pretty lame   i just have to make a speech on this at school and would like to hear what people have to say      do you believe that Omar Khadr should be released or not   please give a neutral prespective      if you can add on to any of the arguments i have written plese do.      Thx :)!!!!!!!!!!!
