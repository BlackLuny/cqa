I guess that made them mad or whatever and they went to the principal telling him lies saying I tried to sell them drugs over a text message (i didnt even have a phone at the time) and they never came up with proof. then 2 weeks later or so my boyfriend gets a call from a friend asking if I knew where these 2 girls were, my boyfriend obviously said no because I was with him all day. He asked why and his friend told him that one of the girls' mother called him asking where they were and said she was told that they were with me. she then told them if it was me she was going to call the cops on me which we said let them because I knew once again i was not in the wrong.       This all being said I have been falsely accused 2 times now and I dont think its going to end if i dont say something to someone. should i bring this to the attention of my principal? isnt it the schools responsiblity to keep me from being harrassed at school?

20090305072432AAUZITv	Politics & Government;Politics	I personally would never own a slave? But If you want to?	I would never have an abortion personally but if you want to have one that is your choice, who am I to judge you      hmmmmm so       Such people — Thomas Jefferson was one — reasoned that, given the world as it was, with slavery woven into the fabric of society just as it had often been throughout history, the economic consequences of abolition for society as a whole and for owners of plantations and other businesses that relied on slave labor would be dire. Many people who argued in this way were not monsters but honest and sincere, albeit profoundly mistaken. Some (though not Jefferson) showed their personal opposition to slavery by declining to own slaves themselves or freeing slaves whom they had purchased or inherited. They certainly didn't think anyone should be forced to own slaves. Still, they maintained that slavery should remain a legally permitted option and be given constitutional protection.       Would we describe such people, not as pro-slavery, but as 'pro-choice'?

20090305061848AAU9nzS	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Honey-pot (setting a trap) is it the same as spying?	First, let me explain what a honey-pot is, for those of you who don't know.       In computing, a honey-pot can be a separate, isolated segment of a network that appears to be a legitimate and protected network that is designed so that hackers(crackers) will be fooled into attacking so that their activities can be monitored and the important part of the network is left alone.      On the smaller end of the spectrum, a honey-pot can be a single file in a restricted or prohibited access portion of any information technology infrastructure that is monitored for unauthorized use.       For instance, if I place a file into a user's directory, and then check it later to see if it had been accessed by other users who are not supposed to have access, or to see if it is being accessed by external or unexpected IP addresses (perhaps other users obtained the victim user's log in credentials), then this can also be considered a honey-pot.      So my question is, if I suspect an individual has been accessing some of my private, personal files, is it not also morally wrong, or at least morally ambiguous, for me to set a trap to capture this person's trespasses by employing methods of subterfuge? If it is, is it excused by said person's alleged behavior? Do two wrongs make a right? Keep in mind that the so called honey-pot is NOT present on any of the suspects computers, or any of the IT infrastructure that he utilizes, such as email, or file storage, or social networking, so I'm not committing any computer crimes, but perhaps an ethical injustice.       So, to sum it up, is it still spying if I'm spying on my own stuff?       It's kind of like setting up a security camera in my garage to see who keeps stealing my paint cans.

"the defendant recklessly drove his vehicle racing at speeds of 80mph trying to catch micheal curry.  Curry stole money from levine after he staged a drug deal.  During the chase curry and levine did intentionally ram each others vehicles repeatedly the vehicles collided causing an accident.  they spun out of control almost striking several vehicles operated by citizens thus recklessly creating a substantial risk of serious physical injury to the citizens and themselves.  One of the vehicles that were almost struck had a 3 year old child passenger along with her mother"      the swerving out of control and 3 year old child(along with other cars almost hit) is ridiculous, no one was almost hit in the chase.      The only defense i can think of is i was young and stupid and involved in some things i shouldn't have been involved in      Id appreciate any information on these charges, if you have a link that would be great   also i was wonderig; if i do get a sentence would it be unrealistic to ask to begin the time after may 15th, when the semester ends?

20090305083320AAzPojQ	Politics & Government;Politics	Why did I get this letter from my boss?	As the CEO of this organization, I have resigned myself to the fact that Barrack Obama is our President and that our taxes and government fees will increase in a BIG way. To compensate for these increases, our prices would have to increase by about 10%.      But since we cannot increase our prices right now due to the dismal state of the economy, we will have to lay off six of our employees instead. This has really been bothering me, since I believe we are family here and I didn't know how to choose who would have to go.      So, this is what I did. I walked through our parking lot and found six   "Obama" bumper stickers on our employees' cars and have decided these folkswill be the ones to let go. I can't think of a more fair way to approach this problem. They voted for change; I gave it to them.       I will see the rest of you at the annual company picnic.      Is this how CEO's are deciding who gets laid off?

The Catholic Church Encourages Illegal Immigration        by Dave Gibson (6/21/08)       http://newsbyus.com/index.php/article/82...             As countless child sex abuse scandals have rocked the Catholic Church over the last several years, American families have been leaving the church in droves. As American men and women whisk away their children from the potential risk of molestation in the Catholic church, they also take their much needed money. The coffers of U.S. Catholic churches have been running on empty and the church sees the pocketbooks of illegal immigrants as its only hope.             During Pope Benedict XVI?s recent visit to the United States, he gave many speeches and sermons. Among other things, the Pope admonished Americans to adopt a welcoming attitude towards those who break our laws by entering this country illegally. Benedict said: ?I want to encourage you and your communities to continue to welcome the immigrants who join your ranks today, to share their joys and hopes, to support them in their sorrows and trials and to help them flourish in their new home.?             It was recently discovered that the Pontifical Commission for Latin America, a Vatican-based group which answers directly to the Pope has made a large donation to help build a shelter for Central Americans on their illegal journey to the United States. The money was given to the Brothers On The Path refuge, located in the Mexican city of Ixtepec.

20090305082706AAtlXAK	Politics & Government;Politics	Why do republicans believe in legislating morality?	Im a libertarian for one reason, and it has nothing to do with money. I can honestly care less what the government does with my money because well frankly I have more than enough to live on and have never cared for money too much.       But the main reason Im a libertarian is because republicans want me to follow their morals, and frankly I don't hold the same morals that you do.       We all agree that murder and rape and things of that nature are wrong, but when it comes to things that only hurt you morally, well that's where we disagree.       I think its fine if people do drugs, I don't think anyone should get arrested for it. Just keep it away from me and don't beg me to help you.       I think anyone should be able to get married. In fact I think the government should have nothing to do with marriage (or anything else!)      I think things like prostitution and gambling should be legal because its going to happen anyways and we might as well tax it.       I am also against any form of censorship what so-ever!

20090305082141AAcoCQ6	Politics & Government;Politics	American Corporations pay the HIGHEST TAXES in the world...liberals, how is that "Corporate Welfare"?	 http://www.americanthinker.com/printpage...    It may come as a surprise that US companies pay the highest taxes in the world. Yes, you read that right. American businesses, large and small and across all industries pay from 35% to 41.6% of their income in combined state and federal taxes. The 41.6% maximum rate is scheduled to rise to 46.2% in 2010 when President Obama's promised tax increases are implemented. Compare that to socialist France where companies pay only 34.4% in taxes, to China where the rate is 25%, or Russia which levies a mere 24%. Corporations in Ireland, Europe's fastest growing economy for the    last 18 years, pay just 12.5% in taxes.

In my mother's will, she left our childhood home to be divided up among the three of us.  However, my unscrupulous brother convinced my mom to sell her house before she died and to buy he and his family a new house.  He got my mom to sell her house by promising to take care of her in her old age.  Two years later, as my mom started to get sick, he threw her into a nursing home.  My mom's old house sold for over $300,000, which means that each of the kids would have gotten at least $100,000.  However, my brother told me that once my mom sold her house to buy him his new house, that old will became null and void.  He basically told me that me and my sister would get nothing.  Is he right?  Am I screwed here?  Do I have any legal legs to stand on?  Any lawyers reading this, please help!

20090305083805AA4HwdK	Politics & Government;Elections	Why does Obama SEEM INTENT on INCREASING the SIZE of government when six out of ten AMERICANS DON'T WANT IT?	In the president's effort to push for the most expansive federal role since Lyndon Johnson, his obstacle may not be convincing Republicans but convincing the public.      About six out of 10 Americans still agree with Reagan, according to Rasmussen national polls taken in late February and early October.      Reagan's line struck a chord a quarter of a century ago because Americans' view of government had changed. Gallup asked in 1937 and 1981: "Which theory of government do you favor -- concentration of power in the federal government or concentration of power in the state government?" In Reagan's day, a majority of Americans favored power being concentrated in the states. During FDR's presidency, 1937, just a third of Americans held the same view. Even then only a plurality of Americans, 46 percent, favored concentrating power in Washington.
20090305085657AAMwday	Politics & Government;Elections	Is Obama NOT who MODERATES thought he was?	There is evidence of a party swept up in its own revolutionary fervor — caught up in the self-flattering belief that history has called upon it to solve all problems at once.      So programs are piled on top of each other and we wind up with a gargantuan $3.6 trillion budget. We end up with deficits that, when considered realistically, are $1 trillion a year and stretch as far as the eye can see. We end up with an agenda that is unexceptional in its parts but that, when taken as a whole, represents a social-engineering experiment that is entirely new.      The U.S. has never been a society riven by class resentment. Yet the Obama budget is predicated on a class divide. The president issued a read-my-lips pledge that no new burdens will fall on 95 percent of the American people. All the costs will be borne by the rich and all benefits redistributed downward.

Of course he could have done some stuff better but he has indeed set the country on the right path. Target is opening 21 new stores, Walmart made 5.1% profit more than twice the estimated figure initially. Lots of people got laid off but things are probably gonna get worst yet this does offer if not a shed of hope that at least we are seeing action rather than Republicans who complain an have no alternative as Ed Rollins Republican strategist said today.

I am now 18 and thought this citation would be locked away in a separate file since I turned 18 but when the officer came back he mentioned it.

Why is it still there if not? Do I need to go talk to someone about it?

Bush’s policies, he was always a gentleman who displayed good humor, and who did not disparage his political enemies, no matter how unfairly or violently they attacked him. But to liberals (and the media, but I repeat myself), one of his greatest offenses was that he was an adult in the White House. He honored it’s traditions, respected the office, and demanded that all who worked there behaved as equally respectful adults. He did, in fact, reach out to Democrats, who accepted his honors with one hand and spat on him as soon as his back was turned, yet he did not respond in kind. That’s class.      Compare that to the juveniles who inhabited the White House before and after him. Not class.       http://pajamasmedia.com/victordavishanso...

These households are wealthy, yes; but they don’t own or even fly on $50 million private jets or host private Super Bowl parties.

20090305090707AA5weKq	Politics & Government;Military	BAH Question when my husband leaves for BMT?	I have read that it may or may not be illegal to receive BAH if you do not have a lease agreement or pay rent. I definitely do NOT want to do anything that would get us into trouble. I can't seem to find out if you are required to have a lease agreement to legally receive bah. I am moving in with my parents, and I absolutely WILL be paying something to them each month, but they are not considering it "rent" and we won't have a legal "lease". We owe my parents money for a loan and also a car that I purchased from them and am making payments on to them. Plus I will be paying something for food and utilities too. Are we entitled to BAH under these circumstances? I have read some places that you will receive BAH no matter how much you pay for your house or if you pay no rent, and I have read other places that you will receive BAH if you can provide a lease agreement. Some people suggested writing up a lease agreement with my parents but I don't want them to have to deal with that on their taxes since I am paying them back for cash they had given us. If it is illegal to receive bah without a rental agreement pleas let me know so that we will not file for it! If it is okay to do, I certainly can use this money for our living expenses and to pay off debts.

I talked to the police department and all they told me was to talk to an attorney. So I talked to my attorney, and according to him, I shouldn't worry about it. He said if they try putting me in jail he'll sue the pants off them. He also said don't go to court, etc. But this raises other questions, like shouldn't she be punished? What if she keeps using my name? I could go to the Police Department and get a background check, but I don't want to be put in jail.

20090305094852AAMpSuq	Politics & Government;Politics	Why do supporters of Civil Unions (but not marriage) think "separate but equal" is constitutional?	"Separate but equal" was ruled unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme court in Brown v. Board of Education (1964).            To those of you who respond, "It doesn't apply to everything; men and women have separate but equal restrooms":    My rebuttle to you is:      Separate restrooms ensure "The Right to Privacy."     The Supreme Court has found that, although the right to privacy is not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution, it can be found in what is called the "penumbra" of other constitutional protections. This means that these rights by necessity create other rights. This was first set forth in Griswold v Connecticut (1965).

20090305100618AArzvpI	Politics & Government;Politics	Are you puzzled over why AIG has gotten $170 billion in your money for a bailout?	AIG took advantage of a regulatory loophole. For over a decade they sold derivatives ( insurance policies against financial loss) to European banks toward their "toxic assets."   They did so knowing full well that they could never cover the liability in the event of a mortgage crisis. Hundreds of millions of dollars collected from these derivatives was used to pay bonuses to top executives.   Under any other circumstance, this is a Ponzi scheme. Because these derivatives covered losses in European banks, the Federal Reserve decided to step in with cash so that Europe wouldn't suffer a total banking failure.   The loophole in the regulations is that AIG was selling these derivatives internationally and not in a domestic market. Otherwise the whole crew at AIG would be in jail right now.   It is estimated that AIG will need another $1 trillion to cover the liabilities for these international derivatives.   Are you ready to fork out that much dough?   When is the criminal investigation going to start. This AIG thing is worst than Watergate.

20090305100924AA2tL20	Politics & Government;Elections	Can we blame Obama for anything?	We can't expect Obama to clean up Bush's mess in a mere 4 years. It will take at least two terms. I don't care if at the end of Obama's presidency the economy is 10x as bad as it ever was with the great depression, the blame ultimately belongs to Bush and we all know it. Maybe in 50 years we can do a documentary that explores Obama's presidency and policies, but for at least the next 40 years all blame has to go to Bush for everything.       I still blame Bush for my D in my biology class last semester. And I have gained 5 pounds in the last year thanks to Bush. And I noticed my gold swing was off last week. I couldn't figure out why. Then it hit me who was responsible. Nice try Bush.       To make matters worse, last week gas prices in my area actually went down and I was like "thank you Obama." Then they went back up a little this week and I was like "why does Bush keep ruining my life." And then to top it all off I ran into this hot girl who I asked out and she rejected me. I couldn't be more angry with Bush for screwing up that one. I can forgive him for the other things, but why did he have to screw that up?

All they have to offer are burnt out talk show hosts, who offer nothing more credible than having gained the support of their corporate bosses (Hannitt, Limbaugh and O'Reilly)...      Has the leadership of the GOP conceded their ineffectiveness to lead?   Have they accepted their own rising irrelevancy?   Are their constituents even aware of the inadequacy of their leadership?      I always get deleted when I ask this question, and never get a chance to pick a "best answer."

I was told all police information is public if you ask... I hear sometimes you have to get pushy but as long as its not involing an ongoing trial or putting something at risk then its all public information.  I had a cop tell me years ago to get out of a speeding ticket (or traffic violation)... you call the station find out when he has a scheduled vacation... then try and reschedule your court date on his vacation time.  He won't be there hence the case would be dropped.  Were also assuming he/she went to court originally and pleaded not guilty at the initial hearing... and the rescheduled court date is when their actual going to hear your case so yes if the cop is not there the case is getting dismissed... assume you've already went to court and pleaded not guilty.  I guess the only quesiton here is the issue of police vacation time... since police information is public could I call and request this information?  I would imagine they would say like oh you'll have to call Srg at a later time but if you push the issue hard enough will they have to give up the officers vacation time?

20090305093303AA20SpW	Politics & Government;Elections	Does New Health Czar Challenges Obama's Ethics Reforms?	Nancy-Ann Min DeParle, who President Obama appointed as director of the White House Office of Health Care Reform on Monday, took home at least $2.4 million in 2006 and 2007 from serving on the corporate boards of health-care companies whose businesses she would be in a position to affect in her new position.      Since leaving the Clinton administration in 2001, DeParle has made a fortune by serving on 10 boards in the health-care industry in addition to her lucrative career as a managing director at private equity firm CCMP Capital and a senior adviser at JP Morgan Partners. Her journey from the public sector to the private sector and back again would seem to represent the type of revolving door relationship between Washington and corporate America that President Obama pledged to put an end to during the campaign and in an executive order.      Tom Daschle, who was originally supposed to hold the same "health czar" position in addition to serving as Secretary of Health and Human Services, came under fire after it was revealed that he received $220,000 for giving speeches to health groups over two years. But DeParle's ties to the health-care industry run much deeper.      In just 2006 and 2007 alone, DeParle earned $376,140 in cash and stock from Cerner Corp., according to a TAS analysis of the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Cerner is a leader in the field of health information technology, which the Obama administration has made a key part of its health-care agenda. During the same time, she also was awarded $377,319 by DaVita Corp., which specializes in kidney dialysis, and $224,749 from medical device maker Boston Scientific Corp.      In addition, she served on the board of Triad Hospitals from 2001 through its merger with Community Health Systems in 2007. When the $54-per share deal was approved, she was paid $1,059,205 for the stock options she held in Triad and she sold an additional $349,164 in common stock, for a windfall of $1,408,369.      This analysis only scratches the surface on her overall earnings from corporate boards since 2001. The reason is that some corporations did not specify how much each individual board member received in compensation in their filings in a given year.      Philip Klein

20090305092816AAlkANW	Politics & Government;Politics	Republicans, how does this quote find you?	Oh, and guess who said it?       "Owners of capital will stimulate the working class to buy more and more of expensive goods, houses and technology, pushing them to take more and more expensive credits, until their debt becomes unbearable. The unpaid debt will lead to bankruptcy of banks, which will have to be nationalized, and the State will have to take the road which will eventually lead to communism". -Karl Marx      You know, sometimes it hurts, but you just have to look deep within yourself and realize the things your government demonizes for close to a hundred years are not nearly as bad as they seem and in fact could probably help us with the mess that free market capitalism has vaulted us into.

20090227071835AAQcK3k	Politics & Government;Politics	Do you get the feeling that Obama's agenda is a communist one?	Make rich people the subject of ridicule and scorn, and sieze their assets.  Round up the guns with gun control using fear as an excuse.  Nationalize the banking industry.  Control the oil industry using "cap n trade" credits.  Make friends with our communist enemies, and threaten our allies with trade restrictions.  Use the census to control elections, give money to private organizations like ACORN to rig democracy.  Allow judges to give property to squatters.  Democracy is dying before our very eyes, people.  This is exactly what happened after the Bolsheviks took control of Russia in 1917.

In order for the States to receive the bailout money, they have to make permanent changes to their laws regarding unemployment - yet the unemployment aid they will be getting is only temporary.

20090227065950AAUBL23	Politics & Government;Politics	Is creating dependency to government a result of ignorance, cruelty, or just unavoidable?	I want to make it clear that I'm not asking if dependency happens or how often. I'm asking if, the times that it does happen, few or many, does it happen because of:      Ignorance- Meaning people don't know about it so the government program, or whatever, doesn't get restructured or fixed.      Cruelty- Meaning politicians know that it creates dependency and want it to so that people will keep voting for them because they don't want to loose the program.      Or just unavoidable- Meaning that dependency is just something that happens with government programs sometimes and can't really be fixed.

20090305084436AAg8qGt	Politics & Government;Elections	Why Wasn't T. Boone Pickens chosen by Obama?	---I would like to see some good informative inputs---      As we know, Obama has chosen Dr. Steven Chu to be the Minister of Energy in the administration. I've noticed that Chu is big on Nuclear Power, something that John McCain was a supporter of; but, Obama was not supportive of. Obama as we all know was a big pusher for Wind, Solar, and bio-fuels. Also we know that T. Boone Pickens is also a big pusher for these Alternative Energies. Boone Pickens is working to create wind farms and solar farms and to make them competitive and profitable.      My question is, why didn't Obama choose a man who was more in touch with Obama's aspirations and is a prominent businessman to be the one in charge of "selling" alternative energies to the American public. Instead of a physicist who, although is instrumental in developing cleaner energy sources, is not a businessman and may have difficulty making Alternative energies cost-effective and profitable to export.

Almost all countries use deficit financing (or simply printing currency) to constantly provide more employment and a feeling of well being. Inflation goes up naturally but I find country like India with big deficits does not seem to have any problem as the inflation is compensated by rise in wages. In USA the only way to solve the housing problem is deficit financing or creating more money as this will raise the home prices and eventually clean up banks. Hence what is the problem with President's plan?
