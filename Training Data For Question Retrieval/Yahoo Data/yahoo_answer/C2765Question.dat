20081102184124AAP6pXu	Dining Out;Fast Food	Anyone playing McDonalds Monopoly?	I just spent 4 hours looking through almost every Craigslist in every state in every city looking for Mcdonalds peices. And I have come to a conclusion that this is a SCAM. Mcdonalds doesnt even make the winning peices. They make the same peices so they can make people think "I might have a chance!" when really you have no way in hell of winning. This is a scam...      Anyone agree?

20090203013801AAfeYTz	Dining Out;Other - Dining Out	Question for RESTAURANT SERVERS: If you share a table with another server, who gets the tip?	There have been plenty of times where I have dined and my main server just so coincidentally is going on his or her break time.  Therefore, we are given a "replacement" server.  Many times the replacement server is better than the main server is, because we usually stay long enough for the main server to come back from his or her break - so we get to experience both.    This happens to be quite often, and I've always wondered who gets the tip left on the table?  Do they split it, or does it go to the main server since it was his/her table in the first place?  Usually, since the replacement server does a better job, I'd like to tip him/her - but not the main one.    Does anyone know how this works?

Seriously no offense to anyone of any culture.   Jared is a big white dude.   Only people from India or Pakistan or Bangledesh etc work at the subways in NJ.      I find the commercials to be racist and not representative of the people who own Subway.      BTW, I'm a white dude.
