e1d737ecf0f11ed65f51b189ae2f0b03aa	wow, speculation is fun isn't it?  <br>  <br>  When we aren't hampered by imperfection or time constraints hmmm.......<br>  <br>  I imagine we will need to go back to basics at first. Food and clean water and sanitation would be a primary concern.  Jehovah could provide it miraculously but I think we'll need to work instead.  A cast iron skillet on a campfire surrounded by rocks might be a luxury at first.<br>  <br>  Who knows what kind of destruction will need cleaned up.  We'll need to operate heavy equipment so I'm sure we'll make use of the stockpiles of natural resources like oil and gas and we know many around the world stockpile food :).  <br>  <br>  I think we'll use solar and hydra energy a lot.  <br>  <br>  There will be building being done to provide for the resurrected ones and then there will be the training program.  I suspect the grand new inventions will wait until after the millenium.<br>  <br>  BTW, why do you think we will speak one language?  With perfect brains why can't we just learn our brother's language?  It's a unique part of them and many of the languages are quite beautiful.  I think Jehovah would not want us to meld into a great crowd of robots, all the same.<br>  <br>  Thanks for starting my day by daydreaming of paradise :)<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Ouchimoo made some good points about what man has done by himself, and while Satan is still here.  He misses the point and thinks man will accomplish everything alone.  Imagine when Satan is gone and we have Jehovah's blessing and direction.  And think of all the brilliant people who have ever lived who come back.  Yes, we'll have amazing advancements.  Of course, those who choose to live simply still may I'm sure.|`|ChpuwEP8aa	I would say Definitely. If you look back 50 years ago the computer was something entirely inconceivable. We are now looking at parts of a DNA to determine what it does and causes. There are infinite amount of things we don't understand right now. The exact details of quantum physics, why we dream, how the brain processes information, why we age and how to prolong it, how to accurately predict volcanoes and earthquakes, how to make our own gravity for space flight, how to travel farther in space using less power, etc. etc.<br>  For perfecting man, we now have the ability to have 2% of farmers feed most of the USA, we are finding new cures for diseases and disabilities all the time. We are also looking through the groundwork of weeding out bad or damaged DNA that is making people sick. Recently a girl born with brain damage because she didn't get enough oxygen at birth was treated using stem cells from her own umbilical cord. After the operation the 4 year old was for the first time starting to speak in sentences and was able to play like a normal child. <br>  <br>  Tower of Babble is the story I remember the best from my old Bible class|`|wRBfUgI2aa	Most of the things a perfect human would think of, we can't guess as imperfect minds.  We can be reliably certain it will be in harmony with the earth and not against it.<br>  <br>  We remember in Genesis, Jehovah gave perfect man the purpose of being caretaker of the earth and all things on it.  The same command was NOT given to Noah, as an imperfect human.  So as we attain to perfection, we will probably get that job again, as we will be able to handle it once more.<br>  <br>  As far as other things, I hope so.  I plan on devoting a few thousand years to developing different ideas.<br>  <br>  Another thing I just remembered.  Then we will not have to worry about diverging products.  27 kinds of light bulbs doing the same thing.  Branded parts that only work on one brand and are not compatible with anything else.  Such strife will be over as what is good for all will be the main goal.  Accomplishing the job at hand.|`|AA11135281	Personally, I think it was pretty crappy of the god of Genesis 11 to interfere with man's accomplishments.  Was he afraid humans would build their tower up through the clouds, climb up, and steal his golden-egg-laying hen?

h6vqu7mjaa	To clear up a few things. First we do not worship "gods" there is one God alone . Secondly it is not barbaric> I am a muslim woman living in the west. I could dress like the rest of western women, I make the choice not to . It is not forced by some man . I just chose to follow the sunna. It is a blessing and a protection because of our natures.<br>  I have met, in my life some very devout christian women as well . Not conforming to the traditions of the world today but take what has been prescribed in the bible for women concerning modesty , seriously. <br>  Some chose to conform to the worlds standards which are far from God's . I think it is a trick of the devil to make us assume that it is such a small matter. Dressing modest and being modest in the way you behave may not get you the praises of man but God will see the heart and intention of this and later we reap the rewards.|`|058c0a6721fd75ea37d3898781c14da8aa	There was a saying APPEARANCES CAN BE DECEIVING.

Are you sure all muslim woman follow quran? <br>  <br>  Marriages aren't arranged... Obviously you don't know what are you saying. Try to go in the middle east and you will see clearly..|`|rIvp1BToaa	I think it is  they are  more  controlled or brain washed .  their culture  does not allow them to think and generally they even have their marriage arranged for them  because the men  will not let them think  for themselves.|`|SzybqjFxaa	That's a very brash generalization!

First, you can't say Christians aren't devout for not obeying a Muslim tradtion- that's like saying Sikh men are more devout because Muslim men cut their hair and don't all wear turbans.  Second, that rule is maintained by fear of censure, rather than devoutness, in many Muslim societies.  It's a choice in the western world, and that's fine, even admirable.  But in places where everyone does it and you would be ostracised for doing anything else, it's not so much of a choice.<br>  <br>  ---<br>  Dogma,<br>  <br>  The Bible also says that we should not eat shrimp, nor get to close to a menstruating woman.  Quite simply, Christians do not follow *all* of it.  The idea that women should be ashamed just for being women is not a part of modern mainstream Christianity; therefore, the comparison to a commonplace and widely-practiced Muslim tradition is not valid.  You are still applying Muslim standards to Christian behaviour... you're not going to tell me that there's abslolutely nothing like that in the Quran, that not all devout Muslims interpret literally?<br>  <br>  Basically, there's rather more to faith, virtue and modesty than just strict adherence to the rules in the books.  I'm sure a woman can be provocative in any amount of modest clothing if she wants to, and likewise a woman with jewelery and dressed hair can also be reserved and sober.<br>  <br>  Spiderhedron has it right- you can't judge whole groups of people like that.|`|AA11297267	It could also be that muslim women have little or no choice in the matter -- if they *don't* do what they're told to do by their religion (and by the males who run it), they're ostracized, beaten, jailed, or killed.<br>  <br>  Ever consider that?<br>  <br>  Peace.|`|UDXp2d8Zaa	they also  ignore these verses  1corinthians 14:34-35 Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience as also saith the law.<br>  <br>  35 And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church.?|`|ZaSiPFvtaa	Some Muslim women are more devout than some Christian women, and the reverse is also true:  some Christian women are more devout that some Muslimahs.  Both religions have tremendous variation within their respective memberships.  That's why I try to figure out people as individuals, rather than simply members of larger groups.  It's very hard to make generalized statements (true ones, anyway) about such large groups of people.<br>  <br>  If you look at a person simply as a member of a religion, and try to figure out things about them based only on that, you will probably be wrong.  People are too complex and varied for that.|`|2WnbP80Taa	Jeremiah 2:32, Isaiah 61:10, Ezekial 16:11-13<br>  <br>  God obviously did not have a problem with people/women wearing jewelry/ornaments, if God does not have a problem, then why would man?|`|PBNPWPbVaa	who knows?<br>  Everyone lives a different life.<br>  You can't compare the two.<br>  There's hos in every religion by the way....|`|TMb076n6aa	My My this is right up 1 cor 14 alley! since he likes to be sexist and controlling to women.

The Bible is one way that He's expressed himself to us.  The founders understood that.<br>  <br>  When this country was founded, 99% of its citizens were Christians.  Despite very poor current thinking, Christianity is very tolerant and inclusive of those of other faiths.|`|44cd283169fb972cb9a8006a9ecce2d1aa	Shank,<br>  This country was not "founded on the Bible" but many came from Europe and brought their religious views with them.  There were also settlers who came from other areas and brought their beliefs at later times.  The wonderful thing about our Founding Fathers was they allowed for people from all over and many different views to be welcomed here without prejudice.  Many of the settlers later began to form their own prejudices and hatred became rampant.  I feel that freedom of religion is important and whether one believes in a creator or not we are all welcome to our own beliefs here.  Have a great week.<br>  Thank You,<br>  Eds<br>  ------<br>  <br>  .|`|6354f9b17eeb910a803f8ef20a4505afaa	Our founding fathers only sanctioned one religion and that was Christ Jesus and the Holy Bible.  Many of our founding fathers knew that America would only survive if her leadership remained Christian.  The Constitution and the laws were established on sound Biblical principles.  Every state constitution has strong Biblical wording.  It was less than 10 years ago that Texas' Sodomy Law was challenged and the Supreme Court was wrong in not leaving it in Texas Law.  Christians follow God's Law and when man's law contradicts God's Law then Christians are in serious trouble from man, but overcomers in the sight of God.  Christians fear God and not man.  If God be for me, who can be against me?  Certainly not mere little man!

I am more familiar with Goth, and only know emo by reputation and what I have gleaned from some of these sites.  I am a mature woman, Who has worn black since the 80's,who dresses somewhat Goth, but not because I am into vampires but into death metal music-one group in particular.  Emo gets more into a cross of punk and grunge, they wear their hair in their face(sometimes with color streaks) trying to hide their depression/sadness.  For emo it's-don't look at me I'm depressed,  for Goth it's-don't look at me or I might scratch your eyes out. Just my thoughts.|`|sDZqabbxaa	Emo people are more of a cheap imitation of Goth. for instance, goth people might wear black lipstick and black makeup, but emo wouldnt wear THAT much makeup.<br>  <br>  Emo stereotypically cuts themselves, which goth do not.<br>  <br>  Tara|`|k2EsaGywaa	From my understanding, emo is short for emotional.

They express themselves through their clothing, or perhaps some form of art or music. NOT ALL EMOS CUT THEMSELVES!!!!! I wanna make that clear. Their hair tends to be a lot shorter then goth's, but not like short and spiky, about down to their necks is a common length. Snakebite lip piercings are very common in emo boys and girls.

R6YQOKitaa	People like people who show interest in them.<br>  You can show interest in them by asking them things about their life, job, love life, (just don't get too personal or nosy).<br>  People love a good listener, pay attention to what they say and take things that they say and talk more about that. Find out their hobbies and interest and talk about that.  There is nothing wrong with a silent pause now or then but don't let it go on for too long. If nothing else comes to mind, talk about the weather! That's always acceptable.<br>  Good luck.|`|aC9dBaNqaa	the more you converse the easier it will get for you it depends on who you are talking to if friends it shouldn't be too hard but ask questions get the other person to talk everyone loves talking about themselves and what interest them talk about what you like and the conversation should start to flow freely.
YaMdGqxlaa	Here is an answer I lifted from a blog:<br>  <br>  The short answer is that the different American accents are partly due to settlers from different parts of England (yes, and the rest of the world). The British Isles has a huge range of very distinct, very strong accents (even dialects in some parts).<br>  <br>  So you have a bit of London mixed in with a bit of East Anglia, mixed in with some West country, etc and scattered across the US.<br>  <br>  But, these accents were exported several hundred years ago. So, the sounds on both sides of the ocean have diverged, and the accents are no longer a neat match.|`|8Nqq7tkwaa	i noticed when i was in london that their accent is similar in some ways to the typical new england accent. they too drop the ending r's and such. <br>  <br>  the different ethnic groups that setled in the states tended to group together and so their english took on the accent of the people who spoke it as a 2nd language. so the area in minnesota i would expect has some remnants of a scandinavian accent etc.<br>  <br>  in the south, many families during the slavery era had black women taking care of their children. these children most likely learned to speak with the accent of their nannies. the southern accent sounds a lot like the accent of the slaves that lived there. some white southerners will deny that i am sure but...think about it.|`|3uiIrxojaa	Ok.. you know the Brittish accent right?

But the disciples felt this was a waste of Jesus’ time. They began rebuking those bringing their children. Apparently the disciples had already forgotten what Jesus said earlier about the worth of children and the seriousness of causing them to fall (cf. 18:1-14). Jesus rebuked the disciples, telling them to let the little children come and not hinder them. The kingdom of heaven is not limited to adults who might be considered to be worth more than children. Anyone who comes to the Lord in faith is a worthy subject for the kingdom. This implies (19:15) that Jesus had time for all the children, for He did not depart from the region till He had blessed them all.|`|pnZssBg9aa	Exactly as you have said yourself.|`|TMb076n6aa	The innocent individuals with a pure heart and humble|`|iyLDTvsTaa	Sounds like you answered your own question :)|`|AA10196281	Children totally trust their parents to feed and clothe them, to provide everything they need.

AA11135281	Yes, absolutely.  It's important to understand how our neighbors think.  Ignorance is the enemy of civilization.<br>  <br>  Kudos to people like the Rev. Don VanDyke Colby, who has instituted "religious road trips" for students at the traditionally Methodist Shenandoah University in Virginia.  He and his wife take students along to different Christian denominations to experience their services first hand. This fall they plan to expand the idea to include visits to places of worship outside of the Christian faith.<br>  <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1862453,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.time.com/time/magazine/articl...</a><br>  <br>  I have no sympathy for those who remain ignorant out of fear of their faith being shaken.  That's just plain gutlessness to me.  Rev. Colby has more faith in his students: "A rigorous faith is going to serve them well.  A rigid one is going to break when the first strong wind comes along."|`|6354f9b17eeb910a803f8ef20a4505afaa	Christians are more informed about false religions than any other religious group.  The Holy Bible speaks of all false religions from the beginning of time.<br>  <br>  As for Islam, I know Allah is not my God.  Allah was picked as the crescent moon god from 360 idols by Muhammad.  Gabriel would not speak to Muhammad and say anything different than the Holy Bible.<br>  Archangel Gabriel would know that Almighty God is more than capable of keeping His Word unchanged.  Even in today's society with the many translations of the Bible, only the King James Bible is not under copyright law and is not bound.  God said that His Word is not bound.  If you have the King James Bible, you have the Word of God in English.<br>  <br>  From Genesis to Revelation the Bible is about Jesus the Christ, God in human flesh and the Salvation of mankind.<br>  <br>  Wouldn't it be wonderful if Islamic muslims were allowed to read the Holy Bible?

Christian I am too dumb and not taught being me much.<br>  <br>  I find it interesting that you perceive that the only religion that requires education is Christianity. This strongly indicates that you know very little about other religions.|`|PS6Pjtndaa	Honestly?  I think in general that it's important to learn from your own mistakes and the mistakes of others as a process of continuiing to improve.  For example, you might hear a baker say that she has figured out a new "trick" in her baking.  She explains: "Some people will tell you to do [fill in the blank], but I've figured out that it's better to do [fill in the better blank]."  They will usually go on to explain WHY the new way is better than the old way.<br>  <br>  Every religion is a story of sorts.  It's been said by some that "It doesn't matter what you believe, as long as you believe in something."  It's also been said that "The man who stands for nothing will fall for anything."  These two sayings seem to emphasize belief, but they don't emphasize accuracy.  I hope we agree that they are stupid sayings!  IF religion, faith, and these stories just were then one might not be any better or worse than the next.  Like ... who cares if you like Of Mice And Men better than For Whom The Bell Tolls?  They're just stories!  Who cares if you "believe" it's smarter to buy used vehicles over new?  One might save you a little money or cost you a little money, but we're not talking salvation here!  The same with the baker that I talked about earlier.  Okay, great, she's figured out what she believes to be a better way to do it.  WHO CARES?!  So, the old way makes the muffins a little less light.  We'll live either way!  <br>  <br>  Christianity offers you a story of eternal salvation.  It's a promise!  It is unwaivering in its claims!  For the most part, that's all we need to know.  But Christianity is attacked on all sides.  I believe to a degree that it's wise to know thy enemy!  <br>  <br>  If I was mentoriing a young Christian, I would first and foremost emphasize the accuracy of the Bible, the reliability of God's word, the importance of a personal relationship with God, the role Jesus plays in our salvation, etc.  It's important for ANYONE to know ...<br>  <br>  A) WHAT you believe and<br>  B) WHY you believe it<br>  <br>  But over time, I'm pretty sure that the question of other religions and their teachings would come up.  I absolutely compare and contrast NOT ONLY Christianity with Islam, Buddism, Taoism, and such, but I ALSO contrast Christianity (and its SPECIFIC teachings on salvation) with Catholicism and Mormonism which teach very differently.  <br>  <br>  My question to you is this:<br>  <br>  If a Muslim for instance has devoted his entire life to the study of Islam and a Christian has devoted his entire life to the study of Christianity then WHERE is their time to fully study both your own faith AND the faiths of others?  I mean ... seriously!  You want a Christian to be scholarly in Islam, Taoism, Buddhism, Mormonism, Catholicism, and every other religion and denomination out there?  That's simply not possible!  <br>  <br>  So, we try to cut to the chase!  We look for big picture concepts!  Examples:<br>  <br>  1. Christianity teaches that Jesus is at once God made man, 1/3 of the trinity, and in Jesus' own words: "THE truth, THE life, and THE way" (to heaven).  <br>  <br>      Mormonism teaches that there are many gods.  Mormonism teaches that when they die that each of them becomes of god.  Mormonism teaches that the trinity is not what Christianity teaches it to be.  Mormonism teaches that you play a role in your own salvation through works and such.  Mormonism is a cult!  Do I need to know EVERY nuance of Mormonismic teaching to say that?  No!<br>  <br>        Islam teaches that Jesus is an important prophet of God's.  C.S. Lewis talked about the problematic issue of Jesus.  EVERY sane person KNOWS that a man named Jesus walked the earth, performed miracles, spoke great words that have inspired generations, and so much more.  Lewis clarified the gauntlet tossed down by Jesus.  Lewis said that there's ONLY one of three conclusions to be drawn about Jesus.  Either you believe that ...<br>  <br>  A) Jesus was a liar; i.e., He never really believed that He was the son of God, but claimed to be God's son anyway.<br>  <br>  B) Jesus was a lunatic; i.e., He REALLY believed that He was the son of God, but since you don't believe it, you must think He was crazy!<br>  <br>  C) Jesus was Lord, just as He claimed.<br>  <br>  Islam?  It ignores the gauntlet.  It ignores C.S. Lewis.  It ignores the Bible as the authoritative word of God.  It tries to sidestep the issue of Jesus by saying that He was an important prophet of God.<br>  <br>  Here's the problem: Even Muslims say that God is all knowing and all powerful.  Why in the name of God would God Himself choose a liar or a lunatic to be AN IMPORTANT prophet of His?  It's insanity to say that Jesus isn't Lord, but is an important prophet!  As Lord, Jesus' existence makes perfect sense!  Jesus completes the trinity.  Jesus fulfilled the law.  As a lying, lunatical prophet with a God complex Jesus makes a mockery of God!  That fact alone allows me to dismiss Islam as a sham religion.<br>  <br>  You really want me to devote my life study to these other religions?<br>  <br>  Comparisions between Chr|`|uurTX7POaa	wow...ALL Christians are uninformed about other religions ? and ALL criticize them ?

There's no reason why you shouldn't be allowed to go to the prom as a couple except that somebody (the principal? the school board? the school superintendent?) is personally uncomfortable with gay people and doesn't like it. Their personal discomfort is NOT sufficient reason for you and your boyfriend to be treated differently from all the other students -- especially if you're already out at school and the other students don't have a problem with you being gay.<br>  <br>  I would question the source of this rule.  Who says you and your boyfriend can't go as a couple, and what's their excuse for not allowing it?  <br>  <br>  If your boyfriend is a senior, can't he just buy 2 tickets -- one for himself and one for you  -- without having to say who he's bringing as his date? And if they won't sell him the second ticket without interrogating him about who he's bringing, what's to stop him from lying and saying he's bringing a girl ("you don't know her, she doesn't go to this school") to the prom? How are they going to check?  And if the two of you arrived at the prom together, each with a valid ticket but without female escorts, would they actually turn you away at the door? <br>  <br>  Even if you can't walk together in the Grand March, who cares, as long as you get to sit together, dance together and enjoy the evening? <br>  <br>  You can take it to court, but you probably won't get your case heard and get a decision from the judge in time for it to do you and your boyfriend any good.  However, if you can get the school policy changed so that other, younger gay and lesbian students don't have to face the same discrimination you're facing, that would be a very good thing :-) <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|JVPwpwYlaa	Good luck...it should be allowed.|`|cIvFOzoiaa	Take it to court if you need to, your school has no right to discriminate.|`|TVUstrw0aa	this tidbit won't help you, but I thought that you'd like to know that my school (Canada) actually has a Prideprom for all of the gay and lesbian couples (because we have quite a few).... now I haven't attended it, but I plan to if I can go without my parents knowing...<br>  <br>  but I definitely think that is terrible of your principle!

(God forbid that blacks should be with their own kind, they should be diverse) You SHOULD take this to your principal, it is very wrong. If he doesn't budge then tell him you will take this very homophobic issue to court. I'm sure he wants to avoid any public attention in this situation. It would give his school a very bad name.|`|7zZCCxC5aa	Schools shouldn't be allowed to pick and choose who you can and cannot go to a dance with. Their policy is dated and prejudice. <br>  <br>  Try to get in any way you can. Then they'll see you two dancing together and that will really get them pissed. hahahaha<br>  what a-holes.|`|RuOTJLyvaa	I'm straight but me and my buddy both went together to prom as dates. We got a lot of gay jokes that night but mostly from smug girls who had a date. We just danced with all the girls who didnt have prom dates or whose prom dates were crap.|`|2ogimlBxaa	Had gay couples at my prom, no problem. <br>  <br>  What on earth does your school think is going to happen if they allow it? That they're going to split a hole in the fabric of space/time?<br>  <br>  I'd raise hell if I were you.|`|Rt02nQ7yaa	sue the school for discrimination. sounds pritty cool to me may get a few not so nice comments like.|`|364f2af929520dfb5f9cb218e970ddaeaa	Thats awful that they wont let you go as a couple.... And thats a good plan but how are ye gonna find them?? I dunno what you could do...but thats definately wrong|`|iembGsl9aa	Wow I'm a bit slow didn't realize that you were a guy. <br>  Who cares?<br>  I'm pretty sure there is some sort of law that states that you can't discriminate based on sexual preference. Especially for something like a prom. This is supposed to be a special day of celebration and everything. What they are stating is ludicrous. <br>  Hey if you can find two lesbians, that's a good way to get in. But it's just a shame that they are so discriminate in your school. <br>  <br>  And Boy did is ever occur to you that your preachy bull$hit wasn't asked for here? You didn't even answer the question you narrowminded dick.|`|mwW4zIwIaa	Personally, I wouldn't mind at all.<br>  And for the prom, I think it's really stupid that they don't allow you guys to go just because you guys are a gay couple. So what?<br>  <br>  We all have our likes and dislikes. The only thing different about straight people and gay/lesbian/bisexual people is what gender we like. Same as some people hate squid, and some people love squid.<br>  <br>  Pretty much the only reason to why some people can't accept gay/lesbian/bisexuals is because...<br>  They don't have an open mind, and they can't accept people different from them.<br>  Some/most religions are against gay/lesbian/bisexuals.<br>  Some people believe that our purpose as a human being is to have sex with the opposite gender to have babies.<br>  Some people cannot think for themselves and rely on the O Mighty Bible for everything.<br>  A lot of people are brought up to think that being gay/lesbian/bisexual is just "wrong" and "not normal".<br>  <br>  I think you're in a public school?<br>  Public schools are supposed to allow you to express yourself freely. They cannot chain you to their own stupid thoughts about one thing.<br>  <br>  Then again, maybe they want to prevent you form going to the prom because kids might tell their parents, and the school might have to deal with some complaints.<br>  <br>  Although, I still think it's pretty stupid because they should understand everyone is different in all kinds of ways. That's what they teach you, so why can't they themselves understand?|`|w2zlb5r0aa	The school cannot deny your bringing a date to prom regardless if its a male so long as he is not old (I think 21 is generally the limit for prom dates) or a convicted felon (this is generally a statute in most areas).<br>  <br>  If you live in America or Canada, you can bring your boyfriend to prom.  Even in certain instances, you can bring a boy to prom if you go to a private, Christian school.<br>  <br>  I went to a Christian school in IL and during my junior prom, there was a huge lawsuit going on up in Canada at a catholic h.s. and my school was terrified that I would try to sue them for discrimination that they preemptively authorized me to bring a guy to my prom. <br>  <br>  It was awesome; but, as class president, they knew that I could get the student body to turn against the admin. on a dime.  IMHO, I don't think they wanted to incur financial ruin, bad publicity, and lack of student support for the admin. at a time when private schools are being increasingly passed-over for public alternatives.<br>  <br>  Just get your argument together man; the school doesn't want bad publicity or a lawsuit.  <br>  <br>  Email me if you need more advice; I am well-versed in law.|`|PUsUnoT1aa	The school can't stop you or your bf from attending prom because you are gay.  Do they have any reason to stop you from attending, if not they could get into legal trouble.  If you both are attending the same school they don't need names unless someone is bringing an older date.  I think your school is scared of what could happen.  Your boyfriend could get the tickets and ask if you want to come and come separate and dance together and walk the Grand March together.|`|Wl900e6baa	No problem from me.  If people gawk and make comments that's their problem, not yours.  You state that the school won't let you go as a couple; it's more than not fair, it's probably illegal. You probably have some legal rights to do so.  I urge you to check with Lambda Legal to see what those rights are.  They will represent you legally if the school is denying your rights.|`|9bc4491ca7a7445dabd4d62a3996b7d2aa	Raise hell mate.<br>  <br>  Contact local news stations about discrimination etc.<br>  <br>  You can make your school's administration look like real assholes in the public eye for the discrimination and prejudice they're showing - and when that happens you can get them to do alot of things :)<br>  <br>  Goodluck!|`|ZP7jpR6gaa	speak to the principal, this is not right. Your relationship is as valid as anyone else. Become vocal about it, I think most students and well educated staff in this day and age accept homosexuality. So my answer? raise some hell|`|DG3lYbkfaa	I think you can do what you've been thinking to do. Just get inside, and enjoy yourself with your bf. Just remember to always stay together with the other lesbian couple just in case sth unfair happens.|`|MWkwRrCYaa	the honest answer is what he is doing is discriminating, tell your parents he has no right to do this and in fact could loss his job by denying you.|`|xefF5dSIaa	I'm fine with it because I absolutely have no problem with gay people.  I mean I believe that you should be able to go with the person you love.  That's what's freedom is for!|`|lmtusbb7aa	Completly normal. if 2 guys can get married why cant 2 guys go prom together? xx|`|ZrzAC8JJaa	hoonestly? i hope you and him are going on a double date with 2 girls|`|4ab8439e5bb68131be2c8b6ff9ed3557aa	That is atrocious.<br>  <br>  There is absolutely NO reasons why you shouldn't be able to go as a couple. You ARE a couple, and a legit one no matter WHAT the school might think. What they are doing is overt discrimination and they need to be called on it-- all people should be allowed to go with the people they love, gay, straight and everyone in between.<br>  <br>  Fight it. Approach the principal first... then the superintendent if needed... and if that doesn't work? Take their asses to court, because if YOU don't fight it, it's only going to show the school that they can get away with being bigots and it's going to keep that wall there for future gay couples. Even if you don't win-- which I'm sure you will, civil rights people eat this sort of crap for breakfast-- you'll have paved the way for students in the future.<br>  <br>  Don't you dare just accept this. There IS time to fight it, it IS worth it and SOMEONE needs to stand up and tell them that what they're doing isn't right.|`|6IooffjFaa	I think it's a great idea, and if they don't let you then that's discrimination on the basis of gender, but taking a copy of this won't do you any good either with the principal or in court.  This is just a bunch of people's opinions.  Gay couples have in the past sued in court and won (as far back as 30 years ago!), but it's too late to get that started now if your prom is next month.  I think you should find a lesbian couple in the same situation (ahead of time), arrive together, and switch partners at the beginning of the Grand March.  Best of luck, and have fun!|`|FZDUHFoyaa	don't listen to that idiot Boy underneath Mr. Peter.  the bible shouldn't have control over who people fall in love with, an neither should you're school.  if you ask me its nothing more than discrimination.  you and your boyfriend going to prom together isn't going to hurt anyone! i think you should definitely try to take it to court because all the school is doing is being racist!  why should you have to miss out on prom just because some people are so close minded that they can't imagine two men being together?|`|HQaIVOhtaa	Homosexuality is unfortunately a highly touchy subject in our White Anglo-Saxon Protestant nation... even people who immigrated here two months ago want to say it's not right. But I believe that the only result in gays doing what they want is that GAYS WILL DO WHAT THEY WANT - no nuclear holocaust, no riots in the streets. The sanctity of marriage, as they call it, is based upon a fallacious religious text which has little to no historical basis and is still being translated with heavy bias. Our entire nation is based upon this text. Until people can see beyond the Biblical veil, they'll still be lost in a blind panic whenever you and your love decide to do something public.<br>  <br>  The best idea I can think of would be to state your case to your lawyer friend in a very level-headed and factual manner - ask him if as a gay couple you have any legal rights over and above those already awarded to you as American citizens, if there's anything in the school code that can be bent or attacked to your advantage. You can also accuse the school of intolerance and set the media ablaze with sympathy - but you have to choose your audience wisely. Sympathy can become derision in the span of a sentence. <br>  <br>  All that aside, I think the lesbian idea is great. Then when you're on the March, break into your true couples and scandalize everyone. Then post pictures of the ensuing mayhem. :D|`|NHfmg7TNaa	fight it, you have as much right to go to prom with the person you love as anyone else<br>  <br>  saying that you cannot go to prom together is discrimination, and that is wrong. there are grounds to fight this, and i dont see any reason why you would lose.<br>  <br>  i would love to go to prom with my girlfriend, but seeing as it is the Year 13 prom, and I am in Year 12, I am not allowed a date this year :(<br>  <br>  good luck though :)|`|8LX4XM4Jaa	I think someone coming out of the closet is a big deal. I don't think people should be encouraging it at all in schools. They should allow themselves the innocence of their childhood, without definitivly (And publicly) deciding they are homosexual.<br>  <br>  Its just a sexual orientation, it shouldn't change the person at all. And anything to do with sex (Or sexual orientation) should not be allow anywhere near a school. (Except for sex education of course!)|`|nWNHa9yIaa	i think that you should talk with ur bf and try to find a girl to go to prom and the march nd once u r inside u can do w.e but taking it to court would also b a good idea.|`|CoiDVKrgaa	if this is what they want to do leave them alone let them have fun and be their self they are people too and let them be happy .|`|DsDlgqRbaa	OMG..I'm 20 now, and I would have loved to go to PROM with a Boyfriend!....aww that's SO special..but anyway 1st of all how dare the school say you cant come to prom as a couple WTF where is the law in that? Im SO sick of people and there "opinions" on how things should/need be like get a clue...mind YOUR Business..if two men are happy then so be it REGARDLESS to your opinion because its just that..we all have one so move on..I wish a school would tell me, me and my guy cant come I would raise hell write anyone, call your local news stations make a big stiff about raise hell.I would sue for discrimination how can they deny two "able body humans" to go to prom..I know my school had it where it was cheaper to go as a couple and i know a lot of "single" people that said they were a couple to get the discounted price...o and why is it there Business who is dating who..shouldn't they be focused on the PRom or how about getting seniors graduated or how why there so many more PROMINENT issues aside a gay couple...let me guess they don't want to offend people? I wouldn't go to that school anymore or dare accept a diploma from them bitches!. and for all the people that are "uncomfortable" seeing gay or etc..if your SO straight why the hell does it matter what ANYONE else is doing..If im a man and I know I only like ***** I can see two dudes damn near *******, now I may not choose to watch but I will NEVER deny someone happiness or the right to live..if gay is a sin just like lying is a sin and no 1 sin is greater than the other..and people who judge straight and THROW the bible so toff GET A CLUE  throw it at yourself...bottom line we all are on this sinful planet and have to answer for something to ONE person who has yet to see us individually face to face so until then REGARDLESS to how ANYONE chooses to live there life that's THERE decision to make!!!!!!!!!

vmv1rP76aa	I think all this "saved" bullshit is really too much. There's no such thing as being "saved". People who sit and wait around for a dead man to come are just kidding themselves. He was an exemplar on how to better your own life, not a sacrificial tool in the works.|`|TPPJEHjsaa	What are you rambling about? I happen to be a divorced woman. I divorced my husband because he was a drunk, he neglected me, and he was violent. I am now remarried to a gentle loving man who treats me with kindness and respect.  You've got some issues, and I don't think they can be solved by your crazy rants on a website.|`|FOzN3xwzaa	All sins past, present, and future, are forgiven when a person believes in Jesus alone for salvation. This includes divorce and remarrying, forgiven completely like all other sins.  <br>  <br>  Jesus died to pay for all sins.  <br>  <br>  And all saved believers are still sinners.  If anyone could be sinless, then Jesus would not have needed to die on the cross.|`|aRh4FKUaaa	Jesus is always ready to forgive you. God is generous.|`|3ccd31e0b38f18f3123974ce88fcb948aa	No, you are wrong.  Most people do not marry over and over and over.<br>  Ever heard of wife abuse or adultery?<br>  <br>  God would never expect someone to stay in a marriage where there was abuse.<br>  <br>  People make mistakes.  God forgives.<br>  <br>  God does not make you ask over and over, every day of your life, for forgiveness.  He forgives and forgets the first time you ask.<br>  <br>  You know, it looks to me as if you are trying to criticize and condemn us all.<br>  <br>  Your mind is made up.<br>  <br>  Why even ask?<br>  <br>  Holly G said it well.<br>  <br>  Surely you are not so moronic as to suggest that a woman ought to stay married to a drunk, a wife beater, or a man who is unfaithful!|`|bVJDV6QPaa	We are sinners and if we are repentant then God is merciful and will forgive our sin(s).  What is not apparent is that God forgives us but there will always be that little devil that reminds us of our past sin and tries to use it as a stumbling block.  Perhaps, it is the way with the adultress, that the men were going to stone, Jesus said to him who is without sin throw the first stone.  Then he turned to the women and said, their is no one here to condemn you and your sins are forgiven.  Did Christ have to keep forgiving her of her sin. No! But we get a little voice inside of us telling us that our sin is this or remember when you did that, that is unforgiveable or your are going to have to bear the task of keeping on asking God for forgiveness for the rest of your life.  That is lies, that is false.  The truth is God wants us to be set free.  He wants us to experience this life on his terms not on the devils terms.  The devil wants to kill and destroy our relationship with God and our very being.  If I focus on God and say that He is unable to forgive my sin, that is just like me trying to take sin and judgement upon myself and that is taking away from who God is and why Christ came, it is simply impossible for us to do this.  So if I sin, it is not up to me to continually ask for forgiveness, it is for me to have faith that God is who He says He is and give Him the glory for setting me free so that now I have an opportunity to praise and worship in holiness and righteousness given to me through Christ Jesus.  And I agree, this is very generous of our Lord and Saviour.|`|SzybqjFxaa	Oh, it's okay. The only unforgivable sin is blasphemy.  But they are all PUNISHABLE, so don't misinterpret my words.
6TuyXuJRaa	There are those that think they do. You notice I say "think". I myself am an unfinished Christian. It means I try, real hard, but I know that I have many flaws that I have yet to overcome. Some sins I do unconsciously and some consciously. The conscious ones bother me the most. Because I "choose" to do these. But it doesn't keep me from trying. I just don't lie to myself or God. But your right, John was speaking to this very thing. Like when James asked, how can you call yourself a follower of Christ without good works. Faith without works is nothing.|`|KUehcrofaa	This is simply saying that we should strive to follow Jesus example.  This is the whole point of the Christian walk - that the more we walk with God everyday, He makes us more and more like His Son, Jesus.  True that we still have a sin nature in the flesh which makes it impossible for us to achieve the same standards as Christ, and God knows this - which is why He makes available to us an abundant supply of His grace which is sufficient for all our weakness.  Walking like Jesus does not mean being perfect - rather striving always toward perfection.  It means having the same spirit of love and forgiveness, gentleness, and meekness, as well as boldness and conviction.  Jesus is the ultimate example of sacrificial love and in like manner we also take up our cross and follow Him as the Bible says.  So think not that you must be perfect, for none of us are, but rather that you always strive unto perfection, being conformed more closely to the image of Christ day by day.  God Bless.|`|AA10196281	The closer we get to Jesus, the more we pray, the more we study the bible, the more we become like.|`|fjidmhxsaa	Note that the truth is not only something we should believe and teach, but also something we should do.|`|a313ff9e6012b101c7dcfaf5dc9c579caa	The Holy Spirit will give us the power to walk as he walked if we submit to his leading but that means giving up control not an easy thing to do by us humans.

For salvation, it is only by one's personal FAITH in Jesus and HIS SACRIFICE and SHED BLOOD that<br>  actually PAYS for ALL of our sins that brings eternal forgiveness and<br>  brings one from spiritual death into spiritual LIFE....Read Jn. 5:24.<br>  <br>  One good way to help in our walk with Jesus is through reading 1 Cor.13, and in Galatians 5 about the fruit of the Spirit...as well as the sermon on the mount...and I was just thinking about this yesterday actually...It would be a good<br>  guideline, so to speak....and as we do our best to walk in the LOVE of God, we will not FEED our flesh when tempted by satan to answer back when someone is rude to us or hurts us<br>  or just does something that annoys us...no big deal...If we can<br>  just let it go without making a big issue of it...like doing stuff around the house when others don't care and leave the mess to you to pick up or whatever...Don't say anything to them and throw it up in their face to let them know that you picked up after them....just do it....and keep the peace, as best you can, in everyday life.....It's not always easy.....I know that...especi-ally when someone goes out of their way to be condascend-<br>  ing and snotty for no reason....Your flesh wants to rise up and tell them what they can do with their "garbage"....but the more<br>  we can say NO and just not answer back to that person....It will send a message to satan that his little tricks aren't working..and we are also being a good witness to that person<br>  if they need to know Jesus....and so I am REALLY trying the best I can....You don't have to deny your feelings of being hurt or angry....and stuff it down...but if we can, out of love and ob-edience to God, get past it, give our hurts to God, and just do the best we can to be kind to the people who are not always very kind to us, because they have their issues...obviously.....<br>  and if they want to be like that, it will be their responsibility be-fore God, not ours.....<br>  <br>  BLESSED ARE THE MEEK..... <br>  <br>  Jesus spoke of Himself as being MEEK AND LOWLY....He said...that those who exalt themselves shall be abased....and THE FIRST SHALL BE LAST AND THE LAST SHALL BE FIRST....The world - satan's kingdom - has an over-developed sense of entitle-ment and arrogance and elitism towards those that they con-sider to be beneath them in society. those who don't "fit in" or<br>  follow the crowd, so to speak....They act like they deserve the best and forget everyone else!!! Well, one day, they will find out that they are NOT better or more ENTITLED than anyone else in this world....<br>  <br>  BLESSED ARE THE PEACEMAKERS.....<br>  <br>   Paul wrote that to the best of our ability that we should keep the peace w/others<br>  <br>  One verse that helps me alot in everyday life is....<br>  <br>  "So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God." --  1 Cor.10:31.<br>  <br>  Also Colossans 3;23 is similar......So both of these just about<br>  cover EVERYTHING....<br>  <br>  And from the MESSAGE BIBLE, which I want to get -- <br>  <br>  "Take your everyday, ordinary life - your sleeping, eating, going to work, walking around life -- and place it before God as an offering." -- It is a paraphrase of Romans 12:1 -- and I got this out of THE PURPOSE DRIVEN LIFE.... I just LOVE these verses!!! :-)

It is like having  say a $100 millon  in yr account. U are free to spend it as long as the money lasts. As soon as the balance is gone , u cannot draw on the account any more and have to start redepositing money (by good deeds) on earth or elsewere.<br>  There is a stage beyond heaven however which is far more <br>  harder to reach from where there is no return un less it is volunrary. That stage is known in Buddhism as Nirvana or Moksha in Hinduism.<br>  In short good deeds done on earth with an idea to enjoy heaven  gets u heaven. Good deeds done to simply please God with no  desire for rewards  in ur heart takes you further than heaven. <br>  Sorry- normaly do not bother to comment as it draws much abuse from bigots with tunnel vision.<br>  Not asking any one to believe it if they do not want to.<br>  <br>  There is much talk these days of interfaith discussions and hence my 2 pennies.

The guys above have answered well I think - one of our coven is very Norse and rune oriented and sometimes we pull one rune out of his rune bag to give us guidance on a particular matter.....the runes can, apparently, be very "deep", and the more you study the Futhark, the more you see, and the wider your skill in divination becomes - a bit like tarot, the skill comes from knowledge and then intuition. <br>  <br>  Runes aren't my "thing" though I have to say when I have used them they've been most interesting.  Whatever means you prefer of accessing the subconscious or the collective unconscious is fine so long as it's right for you!! <br>  <br>  Are you enjoying making them? <br>  <br>  Have a look at these sites - they might help a bit too....<br>  <a href="http://www.runemaker.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.runemaker.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.tarahill.com/runes/runediv.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.tarahill.com/runes/runediv.ht...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.sunnyway.com/runes/index_divination.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sunnyway.com/runes/index_divi...</a>|`|8UTwY1bOaa	shake them and throw on floor|`|ixFM4v4maa	Hey, Hi, when You are done with making You Runes, bless then by saying a prayer over them saying You never use them to harm anyone or anything, which You wont of course as the Runes are only for help with questions and feelings,  i use the Viking Runes, a book by Ralph Blum, can give You all you need to enjoy these  ancient gifts, the symbol's similar as with Egyptian hieroglyphs, type of writing, where drawn on the vikings armour and their swords, as well as other items, for protection and balance in their lives, even on their ships and homes, when casting the Runes , say a prayer before You do so, i say the Hale Mary, as i am very close to her loving ways in life, i draw one at a time while inside my favorite bag, that carries them, allow Your fingers to chose one that"calls" to You, being careful to bring it out slowly as the readings have different meaning weather upside down or not, meaning reversed, also Ralph Blum, books say how to pronouce them,  You can look on line , going to Search looking up The Viking Runes, they will give You the meanings, it helps to have a printer, i think Borders books has the book, also try Amazon.com sometimes You get used books for a better price, be sure You ask simple questions,You can draw one or three or five, i like simple asnwers usually, ask perhaps~ why am i feeling do down about a certain matter, or perhaps like, why must we move or why have i or someone i care about are going thru such problems in life, so, your answes will guide You on your path to a Spiritual life, free from anxiety to outcomes in Your life, i love helping my friends with my Runes, and they love the help.

4SF4KGu4aa	My guess is that none of those original Europeans were around when the films were made since they were all dead by then. So, not likely to hear a wide variety of accents that may be hard to understand for an American audience.<br>  <br>  Got to sell the product to the audience. I doubt many Chinese films use English language in them. They are dubbed with what is current for their country.<br>  <br>  However, originally many settlers did have accents and also got nicknames for an additional identifier when talking about " Sven, the Dutchman" Sven probably wasn't Dutch but that's the name he got. The colonies were mostly British subjects and much of what you might call Southern US accents can be traced to British Cockney language<br>  <br>  I like realism in movies also but I don't think a movie using period language would hold a viewer nowadays and probably wouldn't have 80 years ago. Trying to do so now would make the movie appears as though they were " stereotyping" a group or people. It just wouldn't sell.

HQaIVOhtaa	Funny, I always thought it was polyamory, but I guess I just heard wrong.<br>  <br>  I'm married and I think this is a great idea, so  long as the proper precautions have been taken against spawning and disease. Sex is supposed to feel good, and if reproduction is not your aim then it shouldn't matter what kind of specimens you're sexing, or even what gender they are. <br>  <br>  You shouldn't let religion stand in the way of happiness - on the contrary, our love affair with God should make us ecstatic and crazy with devotion. However, the Bible has always been translated with a heavy bias - if you want a translation where the bias is spread instead of concentrated, try NRSV. They got translators from all walks of life, and you can tell.<br>  <br>  But I digress. So long as everyone in the group is of your like opinion, then your solution ought to work - but be careful who you tell. You don't want to get attacked just because you judged someone's moral fiber wrongly. Sex is fun and natural, and should be with whoever you want - with precautions, like I said. <br>  <br>  Have fun!|`|8LX4XM4Jaa	But thats saying it does not take a certain kind of person to dislocate themselves from the emotional or psychological side of sex.<br>  Ugly cultural side effects are universal, in all cultures, in all histories. The oddity is the culture that does not pair one man and one woman (Or two or three). But the relationship between the man and the woman has always been the focus.<br>  <br>  We live in an age of such hedonism, yet so advanced. To take a page from the "Animals handbook" and to start replicating them in thier sexual conduct doesn't strike me as the next step in civilisation.<br>  <br>  Look at the most of the women who try to live such a life. Unless we can give everybody severe paternal issues, I doubt anyone would be able to live life like that.
h6vqu7mjaa	Making the decision to conceal most parts of the body for a woman who is created to be the epitome of beauty is not easy. It takes allot of soul searching , . It also takes allot allot of courage and perseverance to appear plain where visibly beautiful women are coveted and heavily commercialized. <br>  The Islamic dress code , for one teaches that women's beauty and sexual allure is not for everybody to see but rather to be protected and treasured by the individual. <br>  The word for the Islamic veil is Hijab which comes from hiaba, meaning to conceal or hide from view. it encompasses not only the covering of the body but behavior , manners and speech. <br>  the feminist movement have always made the veil to be synonymous with oppression. They are viewed as oppressed for the reasons of the west but cannot offer anything better in the way of manner, or appropriate dress. In past civilizations women of honorable position in society wore long and loose clothing and covered their hair. <br>  I am a woman that wears a veil, I may not be the same religion as you but I do not find that it makes me unequal to the men . I feel that it is a protection and an honorable thing. Men and women are equal but we are different . Men are also required to lower their gaze, not to stare at women for reasons of their nature.

Start asking questions like.. If there is a Spirit in the house please show its self, make a loud noise or knock that our human ears can here. Stuff like that.. asking it to show its self, make sure you tell it that you mean no harm and they can do no harm to you... at the end of the night let your friend reclaim her house back tell the Spirit that you own the house and that it will not be disrupting your lives anymore.Make sure you are very stern in doing this or the Spirit will walk all over you.<br>  <br>  Hope i Helped and Be careful :)|`|aQPporYZaa	Just open your eyes.

8zelZj3Aaa	Because we have faith that what we believe is true. Faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not see. Believers believe in more than just what can be seen. Do you believe only what you see? I think not. There is much that surrounds us that we cannot see. Example: Can you see the wind? Can you see your mind, not your brain, your mind? How about emotion, can you see that? You can see the physical effects of emotion but you cannot see emotion. How about will, can you see your will? We are all made in His image. It's His Mind, His Will and His Emotion that constitutes The Image. It's all here with us and much more.

As soon as they hear it, Satan comes and takes away the word that was sown in them. 16Others, like seed sown on rocky places, hear the word and at once receive it with joy. 17But since they have no root, they last only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, they quickly fall away. 18Still others, like seed sown among thorns, hear the word; 19but the worries of this life, the deceitfulness of wealth and the desires for other things come in and choke the word, making it unfruitful. 20Others, like seed sown on good soil, hear the word, accept it, and produce a crop—thirty, sixty or even a hundred times what was sown."<br>  <br>  This explains it in Jesus' Words.<br>  Have a great week.<br>  Thanks,<br>  Eds<br>  ------<br>  <br>  .|`|aw4CYsLAaa	The condition of the ground represents the different conditions of people's hearts when they hear the word.|`|fjidmhxsaa	Matt 13:19<br>  <br>  "The god of this world" (Satan) blinds the minds of unbelievers (2 Corinthians 4:3,4).<br>  <br>  Matt 13:20<br>  <br>  The hearer's response is emotional, rather than knowledgeably volitional.

OPnjPaDKaa	St. Gregory used what is often called "sermo rusticus" meaning "rural language" or maybe better "people's language". Some sources say he was not able to write "correct" Latin anymore others believe that he used it for better readability - so his books got more popular. The "Historia Francorum" (and other books by him)  are nevertheless one of the most important historic works.<br>  The 6th century, when St. Gregory lived, is the period which marks the end of classical latin not only in spoken but also in written (theological) language, especially in Italy and Gallia (France).<br>  <br>  So when looking for correct grammar maybe go a little bit back in time. Augustinus is said to have used classical speech (both in grammar and rhetoric). St. Grgory's works are much more important because of their historic value than because of his use of Latin.

He is just as unsure of his identity as you are and will probably only bring you pain. Been there, done that. <br>  <br>  Second, you're of the age where everyone goes through a bit of sexual ambiguity. Things in your body are changing, and you have no idea what you want. Not only that, but you don't even know what kissing feels like (trust me, make sure your first knows what he's doing - mine had coffee breath and kissed like a dog). <br>  <br>  So here's what I say: keep your mind completely open. High school, aside from the learning part, is all about experimentation and experiencing new things. The only way to find out if you're really bi or just confused is to try kissing a girl and see if you like it.<br>  <br>  Now, people will have a problem with this. They will try to tell you that it's morally wrong for you to have these feelings. They will try to force you to not ever figure out if you're bi - which could lead to you becoming repressed and unhappy. These people are not bad people, they just believe in something different, and they don't hate you as a person - they hate the idea of what you're doing. This makes it easier for you to tell them to go **** themselves, since you're going to keep doing what you're doing and they don't even know you.<br>  <br>  Wow. I tend to get off on tangents. But you get what I mean, right? Do what you feel like you want, and if you discover you don't like it, don't do it. <br>  <br>  One last warning: if you get into a relationship with a girl and you discover you're not really bi, please be truthful with her. Trying to stay in the relationship when you're not feeling it will only hurt both of you.

If you want to jail someone then why not jail McDonalds?  Jail those that have the nerve to sell unhealthy products.  Why not jail them?

ijLewIjnaa	I've had  A LOT of my friends ask me what to get their friends for their birthday and to tell them what I would do.  There are two main solutions that can be applied to all friends.  The first advice is to get something he actually wants or needs.  It may sound stupid and obvious but there are so many out there who make bad decisions such as buying books for athletes or skateboards for artists.  If your friend is a heavy gamer, get him several top of the market games.  If he is a bookworm, find out the latest best sellers.  If he is the kind of boy that goes out to the movie theater to watch every newly released movie that comes out, get him those movie cards that lets him see whatever he wants (like a gift card.)  Do you get my point?  As a friend, you probably know what he is interested in.  However, if this really does not work (I'm not sure how), the next best solution is to just give him money.  Money is the simplest solution considering he will have the freedom to buy whatever he wants whenever he wants and you do not have to concern yourself with whether he likes your gift or not.  The only problem is determining how much money to give and here's my suggestion.

aSoCKVJ3aa	Not true. I think the average American male makes his choice because of his own personal preferences. In my experience I've seen a wide range of choices from chubby to thin from not so attractive to very attractive.  You watch too many American movies & tv where the woman is usually thin and/or pretty.  : )<br>  <br>  No, that isn't what I meant at all! That is how the movies portray women.|`|GrKiEDb1aa	WE DO? What American men have YOU been talking to, bubba?<br>  Only morons like skinny minny, bony moroni women!  Women need some MEAT on them: some boobs, hips, thights, butts.

I'm not fat, I'm not skinny, but I do understand what you're saying.  I feel as though American men are brainwashed by the images in the media and think that it makes them look bad if their girlfriend is not some uber skinny model looking girl.   It's like they don't have a mind of their own, they want to impress their friends with a girl, maybe.  They think maybe their friends think this look is good, who knows?  They make it a competition almost, it seems.|`|wh3BAc4taa	Skinny women are not unhealthy or anorexic. Some are born skinny. Some clothes don't fit for skinny women and they get judge constantly about their weight. Don't judge unless you've been in their shoes. <br>  <br>  Every man has his own preference. Why does size matter? If you truly love someone, then size shouldn't matter at all.|`|dQCZDAqgaa	that woudn't be stereotyping and bias, now would it?

jnHwmvSkaa	I certainly don't. The Secret is just as stupid as any religion. Any atheist who does buy into is being being extremely hypocritical.|`|rkhXCiIBaa	I have had experiences that would probably be described as "paranormal," but that just means that the explanation hasn't been figured out yet. I'm open to the idea of the universe being a lot weirder than we give it credit for, but I need to see some evidence before I start believing stuff.<br>  <br>  As for "the secret," I suppose most people's attitude towards it is sort of religious, but has anyone done a controlled double-blind study? I'm not suggesting that we believe in it until it's been disproved, but it seems like it would actually be a fairly straightforward idea to test, provided its proponents could compose it into a reasonably verifiable theory. Who knows, maybe we atheists have been closing our eyes to something just because its supporters don't know how to present it in rational terms? Again, not saying that I think this is really true, but why not check? It may actually coincide with a study I want to run next year, so maybe I'll test "the secret" at the same time.|`|kFpFU97zaa	1. You're confusing positive thinking with faith.<br>  2.

It is a small fluid filled sack that sits on top of your spinal column in the centre of our brains. It contains rods and cones like our eyes and in some animals it even has a lens and cornea, which is why it is called a third eye.<br>  <br>  In appearance it looks exactly like a small pine cone with clusters of crystalline structures on the outside surface. The crystalline structures work in exactly the same way as a wireless modem does, receiving and decoding frequencies. <br>  <br>  It is the organ than receives all sensory input and decodes them into our reality. It is the organ that makes it possible to visualize and recreate reality when we have our eyes closed and when we dream.<br>  <br>  It is why there is a giant statue of a pine cone in the Vatican and why the Pope's staff is a rod with a pine cone on top. <br>  <br>  If you want to experience spirituality, activate your pineal gland, it is the key. :) <br>  <br>  Practicing Shaman... quantum physics rocks.|`|wwdllMzYaa	never heard any secrets desiree<br>  <br>  but i beleive in pelnty things spiritual, weird,paranormal and supernatural being possible<br>  <br>  im a non religious pagan, so no matter what, im just not religious, in any way<br>  any spells or communciation i do with the uiniverse and energy is completely unreligious<br>  <br>  an atheist simply doesnt beleive in a god or creator<br>  evyerthing else is veyr possible for an atheist to beleive or consider possible|`|GeoiGjbCaa	What in hell is "the secret"?<br>  <br>  It sounds like an ad for a miracle weight loss program or a guide to making millions on the internet.<br>  <br>  In any event, no, I don't believe in anything that would be marketed as "the secret", and I don't even have to know what it is.<br>  <br>  ADD: Jesus CHRIST!!!!!!!!!

I had saved for years so that I had money for care if I needed it when I am elderly and wouldn't need to depend on anybody to help me out...well...that money is nearly gone.  What is a person to do?

I am not saying that my life is wrapped up in needing material possessions only that, how are we going to care for the needs we have, medical, dentists and eye care.

Try wearing something conservative, hold your posture correctly, create some poise, and your sure to find someone worth while.<br>  Try to learn another language as well, just not the poverty stricken ones like Mexican or anything even remotely arabian. Italian perhaps? <br>  And for God's sake, make sure the clothes are labelled. men say they don't care, but any woman who doesn't take pride in Brands is not destined for great things. Just great in the generic-everybody wins fashion, like having a child.

Firstly your question is flawed on many levels and secondly we are being with emotions, shocker!<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT<br>  Really "This comes from promise made to suicide bombers,<br>  no brag just fact, i grew up in Saudi."<br>  Well I am a Muslim and no where in the Quran does it state any such thing. I dont care where you "claim" to have grown up show me one statement in Islam that makes that promise, just one...I wont hold my breath...|`|DzGKfdKnaa	I was told that 72 was the classic number used to mean "enough" as in the English phrase "If I've told you once I've told you a thousand times!" You weren't actually told a literal thousand times, you have been told a sufficiant number of times. And so I think this means and sufficient, plenty, enough virgins to make the person in question happy.|`|yHfsHp6naa	The fact is, that stems from a mistranslation of the quran. It's actually 72 raisins.|`|tx4bRDrXaa	It's ridiculous|`|NQnOw4Qbaa	Not virgins, raisins.|`|wtg8vtzBaa	It sounds like another story made up to quell fear of death and the unknown.  I've heard weirder.|`|h6vqu7mjaa	Ask the average person what they know about Islam, they might say, "It is the religion of the Arabs" or "Jihad means holy war."<br>  <br>  Some would even say that the Quran, Islam's revealed text, "promises terrorists 72 virgins when they die."<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, there are many myths and stereotypes about Islam. The "72 virgins" belief is probably the most misused and abused stereotype.<br>  <br>  Add the misperceptions of Jihad and you'll have an accumulation of myths and fears that will inevitably lead to Islam being marginalized and stigmatized. <br>  <br>  Today, negative opinions about Islam are unfortunately escalating.<br>  <br>  The Pew Research Center and the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life released a survey last year indicating that 45 percent of Americans said Islam is more likely than other faiths to encourage violence among its believers.<br>  <br>  Let me set the record straight: suicide is forbidden in Islam.<br>  <br>  In fact, suicide is forbidden in the Quran and in the sayings and example, Hadith, of the Prophet Muhammad(PBUH). The Quran and authentic Hadith are very clear and explicit about what happens to anyone who commits suicide.<br>  <br>  Prophet Muhammad (PBUH)said, "A man was inflicted with wounds and he committed suicide, and so God said: My slave has caused death on himself hurriedly, so I forbid Paradise for him."<br>  <br>  A few years ago, the Fiqh Council of North America reaffirmed Islam's condemnation of terrorism and religious extremism by issuing the following fatwa, or formal religious ruling: "We have consistently condemned terrorism and extremism in all forms and under all circumstances, and we reiterate this unequivocal position. Islam strictly condemns religious extremism and the use of violence against innocent lives.<br>  <br>  "There is no justification in Islam for extremism or terrorism. Targeting civilians' life and property through suicide bombings or any other method of attack is haram - prohibited in Islam - and those who commit these barbaric acts are criminals, not 'martyrs.'"<br>  <br>  The Quran states: "Whoever kills a person unjustly, it is as though he has killed all mankind. And whoever saves a life, it is as though he had saved all mankind."<br>  <br>  The closest reference to "72 virgins" comes from a saying of the Prophet Muhammad(PBUH), "The smallest reward for the people of Paradise is an abode where there are 80,000 servants and 72 companions, over which stands a dome decorated with pearls, aquamarine, and ruby, as wide as the distance from Al-Jabiyyah [a Damascus suburb] to Sana'a [Yemen]."<br>  <br>  Even if it is an authentic saying of Prophet Muhammad(PBUH), there is no reference to suggest that if someone commits acts of terrorism they would be rewarded with 72 virgins in Paradise.<br>  <br>  The reference "terrorists are rewarded with 72 virgins in paradise" goes against the nature and true essence of the teachings of Islam. One cannot achieve paradise by committing acts of injustice.<br>  <br>  Islam is a faith that adheres to peace and justice.<br>  <br>  Yes, there are some who are misguided and commit acts of violence, but one cannot hold an entire faith of 1.5 billion people accountable for the actions of some.<br>  <br>  In Islam, people who commit good deeds are rewarded and those who commit evil deeds are punished.<br>  <br>  Terrorists, all terrorists regardless of race, ethnicity or religion, will be and should be punished not rewarded.<br>  <br>  Nowhere in the Quran will one find, "Terrorists will receive 72 virgins when they die."<br>  <br>  This stereotype about Islam and Muslims needs to be put to rest once and for all.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  BTW.. these 72 companions are like Nun's .|`|ATPPWOpWaa	After getting nailed by a Daisy Cutter, Osama made his way to the pearly gates. There, he is greeted by George Washington. "How dare you attack the nation I helped conceive!" yells Mr. Washington, slapping Osama in the face.<br>  <br>  Patrick Henry comes up from behind. "You wanted to end the Americans' liberty, so they gave you death!" Henry punches Osama on the nose.<br>  <br>  James Madison comes up next, and says "This is why I allowed the Federal government to provide for the common defense!" He drops a large weight on Osama's knee.<br>  <br>  Osama is subject to similar beatings from John Randolph of Roanoke, James Monroe, and 65 other people who have the same love for liberty and America.<br>  <br>  As he writhes on the ground, Thomas Jefferson picks him up to hurl him back toward the gate where he is to be judged.<br>  <br>  As Osama awaits his journey to his final very hot destination, he screams "This is not what I was promised!"<br>  <br>  An angel replies "I told you there would be 72 Virginians waiting for you, idiot. What did you think I said?"|`|YzArBxQFaa	OK, calm down- this is a rendition of heaven just like hell is a place where you can burn forever.  These are just thoughts and philosophies.<br>  Obviously, there is no physical body.

Using "earthly examples" is the only way to entice us as human into working for paradise.  <br>  <br>  However, men, women or anything is completely nothing like it is here on earth.

hvNqywbBaa	If we ask ourselves what is the leading cause of death in the United States, we usually think of heart disease, cancer, and other serious illnesses. <br>  <br>  Actually the leading cause of death in the United States is abortion. <br>  <br>   The truth is that the law and the Constitution only recognize or fail to recognize rights that are given to us by God Himself. <br>  <br>  <br>  The American people are not in favor of abortion on demand, partial birth abortion, or allowing babies who have survived an abortion to die. <br>  If we had the opportunity to vote as a nation, there would certainly be limitations imposed on the abortion industry that destroys not just the lives of the babies but also the lives of all involved.<br>  <br>  You will receive many different answers on abortion.<br>  As a Catholic, I am only giving my answer and some may agree and others not.<br>  I'm not going to go through the answers and give a thumbs down to those who think differently than me. It's their opinion....and this is mine.<br>  I also might add that I have the same opinion on life with  in-vitro fertilization. <br>  Here in  California, we have the woman who gave birth to octuplets..........  questions are being raised about the family's ability to support them. <br>  The problem was creating all these embryos to begin with. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  'Human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the first moment of conception. From the first moment of his existence, a human being must be recognized as having the rights of a person among which is the inviolable right of every innocent being to life' <br>  -Catechism of the Catholic Church-|`|muHctmaGaa	The Bible doesn't recognize the fetus as equivalent to living humans, so it cannot be murder. Roman law permitted abortion (probably from herbal abortifacients), so the Bible had adequate time to address the procedure specifically.<br>  <br>  Ecclesiastes 6:3-6 -- "A man may have a hundred children and live many years; yet no matter how long he lives, if he cannot enjoy his prosperity and does not receive proper burial, I say that a stillborn child is better off than he. It comes without meaning, it departs in darkness, and in darkness its name is shrouded. Though it never saw the sun or knew anything, it has more rest than does that man - even if he lives a thousand years twice over but fails to enjoy his prosperity. Do not all go to the same place?"<br>  <br>  Ecclesiastes 4:3 -- But better off than both of them is the one who has never existed, who has never seen the evil activity that is done under the sun." <br>  <br>  Job 10:18-19 -- "Why then hast Thou brought me out of the womb? Would that I had died and no eye had seen me! I should have been as though I had not been, carried from womb to tomb." <br>  <br>  Exodus 21:22-25 -- "And if men struggle and strike a woman with child so that she has a miscarriage, yet there is no further injury, he shall be fined as the woman's husband may demand of him, and he shall pay as the judges decide. But if there is any further injury, then you shall appoint as a penalty life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, burn for burn, wound for wound, bruise for bruise."|`|faceb0da83e7b433b86d3ae6836703f3aa	Gods purpose in the beginning was for Adam & Eve to have many babies.<br>  So?

Lets worry about those on earth now first, and teach them not to have children if they are not ready etc etc. I think its outrageous that we allow such stupidity, carelessness and recklessness of the people to go on like this and its a problem that is stemming from bad parenting as well as not educating the kids. We can blame only ourselves for this however. As an agnostic myself I find it a bit discouraging to see such vehement argument over both sides, when there is little work bieng done to fix the problem.

But no, he doesn't give us the right to take an innocent life. What He gave us was freewill and the mother carrying the child has the freewill to "dispose" of or abort the "parasite" as to phrase it politically correct. Now she's aborting but that doesn't give her the right to take away an innocent life--even though she has the freewill, she doesn't have the right to take the life of the baby. Think of it this way if somebody had a gun and went down the street or park and shot somebody--God forbid--that person has no right to shoot that person except it was in self-defense, but that person has the freewill  to do it eventhough it's absolutely wrong! Same thing applies to the mother--she has the freewill to do it (abort) but she doesn't have the right to do it b/c that child is a human being and that would be taking away the life of an innocent person ie shedding innocent blood. The Bible says in Jer 1:5.  Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee. And God says that we should not harm the defenseless ie children or conceived.. Isaiah 49:1 reinforces this idea. Psalm 82:2-4, Proverbs 6:16-19, Proverbs 17:5, Proverbs 12:6, Deuteronomy 27:25, Deuteronomy 19:10, Luke 17:2, Jeremiah 22:17, Isaiah 59:2-3 are scriptures that reinforce the truth that it is wrong to harm the defenseless and the innocent. So even though the mother has the freewill, she doesn't have the right to take away an innocent and defenseless life.<br>  <br>  <br>  additional info for reading:<br>  The Hebrew word yeled is usually used to refer to children - a child, a boy, etc. But in Exodus 21:22, it is used of a child in the womb.<br>  <br>  In Genesis 25:22, the word yeladim (children) is used in reference to Rebecca's children struggling while still in her womb.<br>  <br>  In Job 3:3, the word geber is used to describe the conception of Job as "a man child is conceived." That word, geber, is a Hebrew noun that is usually translated as a man, male or husband.<br>  <br>  In Job 3:11-16, Job equates the pre-born child with kings, counselors and princes.<br>  <br>  hope this helped.|`|fghgwE2waa	Hi.

Life is in the blood, therefore life begins at conception.  Abortion is an abomination to America.  Abortion is cursing our land.  The blood of these unborn babies are crying out to God from the ground.<br>  <br>  All sins including the sin of abortion can be forgiven.  For the mothers who have aborted their children, ask the Lord for forgiveness and fight against abortion in every way that you can.  Make the government of America listen.<br>  <br>  Genesis 38:8-10  God slew Onan's brother<br>  "And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother's wife, and marry her, and raise up seed to thy brother.  And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to pass, when he went in unto his brother's wife, that he spilled it on the ground, lest that he should give seed to his brother.  And the thing which he did displeased the Lord: wherefore he slew him also."  <br>  <br>  Judah's first-born was Er and Er was wicked in the sight of the Lord; and the Lord slew him.  Er was Onan's brother that God slew also just for spilling his seed on the ground while having sex.<br>  <br>  If God will kill a man for spilling his seed on the ground, then how much more does God cherish that seed that is placed inside of a woman?  Life is in that seed because there is life in the blood and life begins at conception.<br>  <br>  Abortion is an abomination to God.|`|6ELSwKKvaa	God gives us the right to have free will. Therefore he has given us the right to do as we think is right. (Even if he disagrees) <br>  <br>  Also, there is a time when an abortion is allowed according to the Bible. Obviously there was no abortion back then but there is a passage that talks about a fetus being harmed during an argument between two men. If the fetus miscarried the man was to pay whatever the husband wanted but if the mother died, then it was a life for a life. The man was to be killed. This shows that in the case of the mothers life versus the babies, that the mother has more value. This does not reduce the value of the baby but it just goes to show that the mothers life is more valuable than the babies life.<br>  <br>  Exodus 21:22|`|9XAqnmOQaa	Your basic premise is false.

Science really does not know what life is, how if happens, or when it begins.<br>  <br>  Religion can answer this question, possibly, but few are willing to hear the answer.  My belief, based on my own experience with healing, is that the spirit enters the zygote somewhere between the 3rd to the 10th day after the sexual act that produces the conception.  My information is that a human spirit does have mass (albeit tiny), and needs a certain amount of "room" to exist.  <br>  <br>  For me then, abortion is clearly murder, as the human spirit exists in the foetus - life, the gift of God, is present long before the birth itself.  Thus, we have no "right" for abortions, quite the reverse in fact.<br>  <br>  However, I could not scientifically "prove" to anyone's satisfaction my ideas on when the spirit enters the person to be, and neither can anyone else.

dCewrtXaaa	Rand was talking about egoism, not egotism. Here are some more quotes that may make the meaning clearer:<br>  <br>  Men have been taught that it is a virtue to agree with others. But the creator is the man who disagrees. Men have been taught that it is a virtue to swim with the current. But the creator is the man who goes against the current. Men have been taught that it is a virtue to stand together. But the creator is the man who stands alone.-- Ayn Rand<br>  <br>  Men have been taught that the ego is the synonym of evil, and selflessness the ideal of virtue. But the creator is the egoist in the absolute sense, and the selfless man is the one who does not think, feel, judge or act. These are functions of the self.---- Ayn Rand<br>  <br>  Men have been taught that the highest virtue is not to achieve, but to give. Yet one cannot give that which has not been created. Creation comes before distribution- or there will be nothing to distribute. The need of the creator comes before the need of any possible beneficiary. Yet we are taught to admire the second-hander who dispenses gifts he has not produced above the man who made the gifts possible. We praise an act of charity. We shrug at an act of achievement.---- Ayn Rand|`|M2CQHli0aa	Basically, it is stating the an egotist does not need other people.  The sentence is taken out of context.

"is the absolute sense" should be "in the absolute sense". The correct quote : "The egotist in the absolute sense is not the man who sacrifices others. He is the man who stands above the need of using others in any manner. He does not function through them. He is not concerned with them in any primary matter. Not in his aim, not in his motive, not in his thinking, not in his desires, not in the source of his energy. He does not exist for any other man--and he asks no other man to exist for him. This is the only form of brotherhood and mutual respect possible between men."<br>  <br>  Summary : 'An egotist really doesn't sacrifices others, he just doesn't need anybody else.'

So Palestinians can, and are, both.<br>  <br>  Here are what some Muslim and Arab leaders have said publicly on this topic:<br>  <br>  "There is no such country [as Palestine]! 'Palestine' is a term the Zionists invented! There is no Palestine in the Bible. Our country was for centuries part of Syria."<br>  - Auni Bey Abdul-Hadi, a local Arab leader, to the Peel Commission, 1937<br>  <br>  <br>  "Palestine was part of the Province of Syria... politically, the Arabs of Palestine were not independent in the sense of forming a separate political entity."<br>  - The representative of the Arab Higher Committee to the United Nations submitted this in a statement to the General Assembly in May 1947<br>  <br>  "It is common knowledge that Palestine is nothing but southern Syria."<br>  - Ahmed Shuqeiri, later the chairman of the PLO, to the UN Security Council<br>  <br>  "You do not represent Palestine as much as we do. Never forget this one point: There is no such thing as a Palestinian People, there is no Palestinian entity, there is only Syria. You are an integral part of the Syrian people, Palestine is an integral part of Syria. Therefore it is we, the Syrian authorities, who are the true representatives of the Palestinian people."<br>  - Syrian President Hafez Assad to PLO leader Yassir Arafat.<br>  <br>  "There are no differences between Jordanians, Palestinians, Syrians and Lebanese. We are all part of one nation. It is only for political reasons that we carefully underline our Palestinian identity.... yes, the existence of a separate Palestinian identity serves only tactical purposes. The founding of a Palestinian state is a new tool in the continuing battle against Israel."<br>  - Zuheir Muhsin, late Military Department head of the PLO and member of its Executive Council (Dutch daily Trouw, March 1977)<br>  <br>  "The interesting thing about "Palestinians" is that so few of the West Bank Arabs thought of themselves as such before 1967. It post-dates the founding of the PLO: Palestine had a national liberation movement before it had a nationality. Likewise, because the Arab League designated Yasser Arafat as a head of state, we've spent 30 years trying to create a state for him to be head of. Most Arab nationalities -- "Jordanian," "Iraqi" -- were invented by the British Colonial Office in the Twenties, and, although those languid Etonians came up with some evocative and colourful names for their hastily concocted jurisdictions, for the most part they're comprehensive failures as nation states. It hardly seems worth adding another bogus polity to the list."<br>  - Mark Steyn, National Post, April 4, 2002<br>  <br>  "The Oslo accords were a Trojan Horse; the strategic goal is the liberation of Palestine from the [Jordan] river to the [Mediterranean] sea"<br>  - Faysal Al-Husseini, Palestinian Authority Minister for Jerusalem Affairs, in his last interview, 'Al-Arabi' daily newspaper (Egypt), June 24, 2001<br>  <br>  <br>  "The Land of Muslim Palestine is a single unit which cannot be divided. There is no difference between Haifa and Shechem (Nablus), between Lod and Ramallah, and between Jerusalem and Nazareth . . . the land of Palestine is sacred waqf land for the benefit of all Muslims, east and west. No one has the right to divide it or give up any of it. The liberation of Palestine is obligatory for all the Islamic nations and not only for the Palestinian nation."<br>  - Prayer sermon broadcast live on the PA radio station, April 30, 1999<br>  <br>  "According to the Phased Plan, we will establish a Palestinian state on any part of Palestine that the enemy will retreat from. The Palestinian state will be a stage in our prolonged struggle for the liberation of Palestine on all of its territories."<br>  - Abu Iyad, Arafat' s second-in-command, 1988<br>  <br>  "The people are in great need of a 'myth' to fill their consciousness and imagination...."<br>  - Musa Alami, 1948<br>  <br>  "Since 1948 it is we who demanded the return of the refugees... while it is we who made them leave.... We brought disaster upon ... Arab refugees, by inviting them and bringing pressure to bear upon them to leave.... We have rendered them dispossessed.... We have accustomed them to begging.... We have participated in lowering their moral and social level.... Then we exploited them in executing crimes of murder, arson, and throwing bombs upon ... men, women and children--all this in the service of political purposes...."<br>  - Khaled Al-Azm, Syria's Prime Minister after the 1948 war<br>  <br>  "Since 1948 Arab leaders have approached the Palestine problem in an irresponsible manner.... they have used the Palestine people for selfish political purposes. This is ridiculous and, I could say, even criminal."<br>  - King Hussein of Jordan, 1960<br>  <br>  "Have no mercy on the Jews, no matter where they are, in any country. Wherever you meet them, kill them. Wherever you are, kill those Americans who are like them."<br>  - Dr. Ahmad Abu Halabiya, member of the Palestinian Fatwa Council<br>  <br>  "Palestine has never existed... as an autonomous entity. There is no language known as Palestinian. There is no distinct Palestinian culture.... There has never been a land known as Palestine governed by Palestinians.... Palestinians are Arabs, indistinguishable from Jordanians (another recent invention), Syrians, Lebanese, Iraqis, etc.... Keep in mind that the Arabs control 99.9 percent of the Middle East lands. Israel represents one-tenth of one percent of the landmass. But that's too much for the Arabs. They want it all. And that is ultimately what the fighting in Israel is about today.... No matter how many land concessions the Israelis make, it will never be enough."<br>  - from "Myths of the Middle East", Joseph Farah, Arab-American editor and journalist, WorldNetDaily.Com, 11 October 2000|`|UlzxgVMgaa	Are you racist ,that's shamefull

onfTqFe4aa	I completely feel you on this! Omg i went through the very, same, exact situation. I tell you a bit about it and I hope it helps. I also feel for one of my friends. At first it was a casual friendship through work but then we hung out a lot more and I relaized I liked her more than a friend after about a year I hated seeing her with guys (and she would go through the worst realtionships ever, so that made it even worst I knew she deserved much better). Sometimes when we'd go out and run into her guy "friends" I'd start acting really wierd and find some excuse to leave just cause i couldn't stomach it. I'd act real different around her and she started to notice one day and told she felt like we had some heavy tension between us. I wanted to tell her why so bad. I even told her I had a good reason but I said there was no way I could tell her, cause I thought she'd hate me for it. <br>  Anyway, we ended up having a very long and awkward break from our friendship because of it. What I did was gave her some space and time cause if she really is your friend and are really close, time will show it. So, I backed off for a while (and I don't mean a day or two - more like a month or two). And eventually I explained half the truth to her - i just told her I care so much for her and I apologized for acting weird. And day by day things got better. In all this my advice is give her some time to herself, cause 9 times out 10 she knows you like her if you and I acted alike, so no need to rush and tell her everything, but let her know something was up with you and it wasn't her fault.

None of which would be good reasons if true. <br>  <br>  You see, Christians are not PERFECT people.

It is so strong that it can alter a person's thinking and emotions.  It can harden the heart and move us to irrational and sinful decisions.  God has created sex for the marriage bed and for there alone.  He wants you to be pure in mind and body, reserving the sexual union for the proper context of marriage so that you might properly honor God and your spouse.  Failure to do this is to commit grievous sin.  But all is not lost.<br>  <br>  There is forgiveness in Christ<br>  All of your sexual sin can be forgiven.  The blood of Christ is too great to be defeated by your sin.  Jesus paid a great price on the cross (1 Pet. 2:24).  He shed His blood and gave His life and if you are a Christian, then you have been bought with a great price.  You are not your own and the Lord always longs to fellowship with you (1 Cor. 1:9).  All you need to know is that you must confess your sin to God and repent of it.  This means you stop doing it.  You are called by God to purity, not to sexual immorality.<br>  <br>  1 Cor. 6:18, "Flee immorality. Every other sin that a man commits is outside the body, but the immoral man sins against his own body." <br>  Eph. 5:3, "But do not let immorality or any impurity or greed even be named among you, as is proper among saints." <br>  Col. 3:5, "Therefore consider the members of your earthly body as dead to immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire, and greed, which amounts to idolatry." <br>  1 Thess. 4:2, "For you know what commandments we gave you by the authority of the Lord Jesus. 3 For this is the will of God, your sanctification; that is, that you abstain from sexual immorality; 4 that each of you know how to possess his own vessel in sanctification and honor, 5 not in lustful passion, like the Gentiles who do not know God." <br>  The Greek word for "immorality" is porneia which means illicit sexual intercourse, i.e., fornication, homosexuality, lesbianism, bestiality, etc.  The English word "pornography" is derived from this Greek word.  So, you can see that God desires your holiness.  After all, this is why you are a Christian, to honor God, glorify Him, and live for Him.<br>  <br>  To repeat, if you are in sexual sin, stop it, confess it, break off tempting relationships and situations, and seek the Lord.  If you fall again, then go to the cross again.  Never give up going to Jesus and receiving the forgiveness that you need.  Never think that the Lord Jesus will stop loving you.  Never doubt Him.  He loves you and knows your struggle.<br>  <br>  Then, after you have repented, see if you can find someone to be accountable to.  Find someone trustworthy and have them pray with you regularly.  It is so true that sometimes beating sexual sin cannot be done alone.  Sometimes we need the strength of the body of Christ.<br>  <br>  What if I don't repent of my sin?<br>  If you are a Christian involved in sexual sin then you know that the Holy Spirit has been convicting you.  If you feel no conviction then you are either not really saved or are so hardened by the sin you've been committing that you are close to God taking your life.  This is the case in 1 Cor. 5:5 where a man was having sex with his father's wife and he would not repent.  Paul said, "I have decided to deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of his flesh, that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus." Rest assured that God takes this seriously.  He will take your life to essentially save your soul.  This is a loving  move on God's part.<br>  <br>  If you are reading this, then the Lord has directed you here because He wants you to know about this issue.  If you are in such sin, you know what the Lord requires of you.  If you are not in this sin, then thank the Lord for His mercy and continue to seek the Holiness of the Lord.|`|9ARNK0Bzaa	she's divorced too, so maybe there's certain aspects on Christianity which she doesn't conform to.

sohnrZDcaa	You need to pray "according to His will" and you will have 100% of your prayers answered!<br>  <br>  Hosea 9:14-16 (NIV) (this prophet of God is improvising a prayer to the LORD about one of the tribes in Israel that he hates!!!...) Give them, O LORD— what will you give them? Give them wombs that miscarry* (*THIS IS THE MOST DESPICABLE PRO-CHOICE EXAMPLE IN THE BIBLE! The Prophet Hosea and God conniving together on performing abortions and killing children!) and breasts that are dry. (The heck with any suckling baby consideration! By the future blood of Jesus Christ on the Holy Cross of Calvary God rushes to answer this prayer on the spot!) "Because of all their wickedness in Gilgal, I HATED them there * (*the loving God HATES one WHOLE tribe in Israel just for the heck of it!). Because of their sinful deeds, I will drive them out of my house. I will no longer love them* (*God won’t love this tribe of Israel anymore at all for the most ridiculous reasons!); all their leaders are rebellious. Ephraim is blighted, their root is withered, they yield no fruit* (*I, God Almighty won’t help!!!). EVEN IF THEY BEAR CHILDREN* (*these are innocent children of a God’s chosen but rejected tribe of Israelites that are slated for a big gory slaughter. God usually takes it on the innocent children in the Bible… not necessarily on the smart adults! Praise THE LORD! Sweet Jesus! Amen?) I WILL SLAY THEIR CHERISHED OFFSPRING."* (*Yeah... the kids!!! The wanking Bible writers are saying that this God will have the kids killed! Hey nothing beats some Mafia talk in the Bible to call the attention of religious people!)<br>  <br>  God always answers your prayer even before you open your eyes, but you must ask “according to his will”…!  You get an immediate answer especially when you pray for the slaughter of Christians of the wrong brand including their babies that YOU AND GOD hate! And the Christians make such a big deal against the PRO-CHOICE people who really NEED an abortion! Christianity is the biggest scam of historical proportions and people are still dedicating their lives to serve this crappy God!    <br>   <br>  Jeremiah 16:3-4 (NIV) For this is what the LORD says about the sons and daughters* (*Jewish babies) born in this land* (*not in cursed Egypt, but in the PROMISED HOLY LAND) and about the women who are their mothers and the men who are their fathers: "They will die of deadly diseases. They will not be mourned or buried but will be like refuse lying on the ground. They will perish by sword and famine, and their dead bodies will become food for the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth."* (*According to the Bible writers the only problem that the Jews had in Egypt was that they had to work for a living. They had plenty of food there!) <br>   <br>  It is funny that prayers requesting the destruction of anybody especially children have an immediate and enthusiastic response from the Bible God, but prayers on behalf of a sick person like an innocent baby born out of an adulterous tryst may never be answered!  Even when IT IS KNOWN FOR SURE that God is the author of ALL THE EVIL in the life of the baby!<br>  <br>  2 Samuel 12:13-18 (NIV)  Then King David said to Nathan, “I have sinned against the Lord.” Nathan replied, “The Lord has taken away your sin. You are not going to die.* (*Isn’t God so sweet? King David had sex with a married woman and had to kill her husband before he would find out that his wife is cheating on him and now she is pregnant, but…!) But because by doing this you have made the enemies of the Lord show utter contempt* (*Yeah the morality of the Heathen far exceeds the morality of the Bible God’s people”), THE SON BORN TO YOU WILL DIE.”* (*Yeah… the Bible God in his “infinite love” always picks on the innocent and defenseless babies for a bloody slaughter, not on the adulterous parents… Praise The LORD… Sweet Jesus!) After Nathan had gone home, the Lord* (*NOT SATAN, but God!) struck the child that Uriah's wife* (*how specific can anybody get? Spiritually speaking, of course!) had borne to David* (*The Bible writers say that King David  is ”a man after God’s own heart!”), and he became ill* (*God in his INFINITE WISDOM is slaughtering the baby so his enemies won’t laugh at him! God’s IQ can be measure with the fingers of one hand!). DAVID PLEADED WITH GOD FOR THE CHILD. He fasted and went into his house and spent the nights lying on the ground* (*Hardly any Christian today prays like that!). The elders of his household stood beside him to get him up from the ground, but he* (*King David) refused, and he would not eat any food with them* (*what else can a decent guy do? Benny Hinn was not around yet to be of any help!). ON THE SEVENTH DAY THE CHILD DIED… (The Bible writers were a bunch of wanking perverts! They have God answering Hosea’s hateful prayer involving the killing of children on the spot, but no such an answer is written on behalf of a dying child! And Christians swallow all this crap in the Bible as their daily bread!)<br>  <br>  YES! The Bible God, NOT SATAN had the poor baby dying on a slow tormenting death for 7 long days so King David and “the enemies of God” may learn a lesson. Nobody beats God’s mafia talk to teach anybody a lesson.  “WHATSOEVER” is written in the Old Testament is intended for the Christian of today, too! (Romans 15:4)<br>  <br>  God the Son Jesus Christ is not less of a baby killer, either! Under God’s leadership in Bible times, babies and children were God’s primary target. The fetuses in abortion clinics today are decently disposed of before they are born! In spit of Christian denials the Bible God is in the children killing business!    <br>  <br>  Revelation 2:23 (NIV) (Jesus says) I WILL STRIKE HER CHILDREN DEAD* (*Sweet Jesus Christ himself is the one having the pleasure of doing the killing of children so he can teach everybody a lesson on who is the BOSS! That is the theme throughout the Bible! The wise Clergy is earning millions of Dollars printing books about Jesus’ love for the little children of the world without telling anybody about Jesus’ vicious children killing craze. In our society today, Jesus would be in jail for promoting even BY EXAMPLE the killing of children to favor a particular religion!!!). Then ALL THE CHURCHES WILL KNOW that I am he who searches hearts and minds, and I will repay each of you according to your deeds.* (*YEAH…! Praise the LORD! Sweet Jesus…! He is such a great teacher and he must have learned all that from the Mafia! Or is it the way around?)<br>  <br>  Psalm 137:8-9 - O Daughter of Babylon, doomed to destruction, happy is he who repays you for what you have done to us- he who seizes your infants and dashes them against the rocks.<br>  <br>  The Bible God’s down to Earth strategy is very simplistic! The Bible writers teach that the enemies of God or Israel for that matter ought to be killed in their infancy when it is easier to get rid of them!<br>  <br>  So good luck in your prayer life…|`|9YMLsk7Taa	God is not your personal Holy vending machine to answer your prayers in the exact way you want every time.|`|GrKiEDb1aa	God is not  a genie in a bottle to grant you wishes.<br>  God answers ALL believers' prayers in HIS time, in HIS way, not ours.<br>  God always answers: YES, NO, WAIT.|`|25qUTYLEaa	You can't "get God" to do ANYTHING.

Do you feel fiscally and mature enough to handle a relationship, a marriage and possibly a family?  How much do know about her?  Do you want to get to know her?  Do you love God?  Do you believe that God blessed you with her and her with you?  Are you ready for a commitment?  Do you honor her?  How do you honor her and your relationship?  Are you willing to learn about what honoring her means?|`|yluVQqcRaa	The Bible says that to lust/dream of sex other than to the one you ARE married to is sin.

bi3XdkMEaa	There is no reason to fear, but the question is irrelevant.<br>  relavation 22:18-19 applies only to the book of relevation, not to the whole bible. Do you really know, that the relevation is not the last written book?<br>  Moses said just the same in Deut 4: 2 ( <a href="http://scriptures.lds.org/deut/4/2#2" rel="nofollow">http://scriptures.lds.org/deut/4/2#2</a> ). When it is to understand as you claim, what is with the rest of the bible?<br>  <br>  Noted Biblical scholar Bart Ehrman wrote:<br>  The very real danger that [New Testament] texts could be modified at will, by scribes who did not approve of their wording, is evident in other ways as well. We need always to remember that the copyists of the early Christian writings were reproducing their texts in a world in which there were not only no printing presses or publishing houses but also no such thing as copyright law. How could authors guarantee that their texts were not modified once put into circulation? The short answer is that they could not. That explains why authors would sometimes call curses down on any copyists who modified their texts without permission. We find this kind of imprecation already in one early Christian writing that made it into the New Testament, the book of Revelation, whose author, near the end of his text, utters a dire warning [quotes Revelation 22:18–19].<br>  <br>  This is not a threat that the reader has to accept or believe everything written in this book of prophecy, as it is sometimes interpreted; rather, it is a typical threat to copyists of the book, that they are not to add to or remove any of its words. Similar imprecations can be found scattered throughout the range of early Christian writings.<br>  <br>  BTW: There is already much taken away from the Bible, because nobody is really able to translate correctly Hebrew to any other language. By the missing vowels there were several meanings, which all had been correct. And all these doble meanings are lost by any translation. <br>  The Bible is restored. And now people claim it would be added by the Book of Mormon.<br>  <br>  Isn't it boring to ask the same question again and again?<br>  The Book of Mormon is the word of God.|`|kG9oI68eaa	no it does not because the book of mormon is the word of god.  It means if any person adds to his scripture they will be plagued but he can add as much as he desires, he is god.|`|3bc6709f9978822792e144f5259dd14baa	There are a couple of ironies here. <br>  <br>  First of all, if that is the way you interpret that scripture, then you can't believe in anything like a trinitarian creed that has been "added to the Bible."<br>  <br>  However, that's a poor interpretation of that scripture.  Chronologically, it was not the last book to be written.  Those who were canonizing the Bible just thought it fit nicely at the end.  <br>  <br>  Additionally, Moses wrote the same thing in Deuteronomy 4:2<br>  <br>  "Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye diminish ought from it, that ye may keep the commandments of the Lord your God which I command you."<br>  <br>  So, if you interpret Revelations that way, you'd have to interpret Deuteronomy the same way....which would mean that most of the Books of the Old Testament and all of the New Testament would be false. <br>  <br>  Clearly Moses and John were referring to their own words and not to the words of other Prophets.|`|Bi1W5U35aa	That would include Mathew Mark Luke and John, etc. because they are all added to the Book of John's revelations. This question has been answered over, and over, and over again. Scripture is scripture whenever or wherever the Lord speaks to His Prophets. The Book of Mormon is a thousand year history of what the Lord (the one who spoke to Moses) revealed to his other sheep on this continent 600 BC to 400 AD. The Doctrine and Covenants is what the Lord has revealed to His Prophet in our day. The two Prophets who will lie dead in Jerusalem will also prophesy and all will come together in the day of the Lord. (mormon.org).|`|CTxGUFZOaa	In Revelation 22:18-19, each verse says, "if any man shall."  You surely must agree that only God can add to His own word.  This He has done, including not only the Bible, but the Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants, and Pearl of Great Price.  God also continues to give continuing revelation to living prophets and apostles in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and personal revelation through the Holy Ghost to individual members of the Church according to their needs and righteous desires.  We do not add to the word of God ourselves, but are eternally grateful that He does, and invite all mankind to gain this same testimony and benefit.|`|AlybkawCaa	I am a Jesusonian Christian Theologian/Evangelist who is very familiar with the Bible, Book of Mormon, Epochal Revelation continuing, etc.<br>  <br>  Our real, loving Father God does not ever add "plagues; that is only old, obsolete, pre-Christian beliefs.  <br>  <br>  Rev 22:18-19 was written by a human; and is not the "word of God".<br>  You should now go into the Old Testament at Deut. 4:2 and 12:32 and read similar warnings, from another unspiritual human author. <br>  <br>  To think that God Revealed His will only in the dim. uncertain past, is to attempt to greatly limit our unchanging, timeless, Eternal, loving Universal Father God !   Even the Bible has many verses that confirm the Truth that God speaks to us from above (Transcendent) and also within - the spirit Essence will of God within every normal human no matter what their mere intellectual religious or secular beliefs are. God is no respecter of persons; and He continues to enter, elevate and transform all Truth-lovers in all countries and at all times !<br>  <br>  He the Spirit of Truth (Who is Jesus) is fully here, worldwide and universe-wide, freely outpouring His Spirit of God upon all humans !<br>  This is the All-Truth of/as God here !   See John 16:7-16<br>  <br>  As long as Mormons and Jesusonians and many other religions accept continuing Revelation, they are being led by God and not by just a book or church human doctrines. God is Spirit ! Our Father God is here leading us into All Truth !   As mankind evolves in intellect and spiritual wisdom, ever higher continuing Revelations will certainly appear.   Let us all hear now what He the Spirit of God has to say to us !<br>  <br>  We Jesusonians fully accept all Catholics, Mormons, Protestants, etc as fully True Christians in the worldwide Family of God in Jesus Christ, and One in Spirit !  Yes, our intellectual doctrines are different; but that never changes Jesus desire and Deity Ability to really seek and really save all humans ! See and believe now John 12:31-32   ! Amen ! <br>  <br>  Peace and progress in Spirit and in Truth !|`|AA12365543	If that's the case then why did Christians add the New Testament?|`|JtdpImWjaa	If your interpretation were correct the bible would end after deuteronomy. <br>  <br>  The book of revelation warns of adding to or taking away from what had been said - changing interpretations and what the prophets have said. God clearly knew that many would misinterpret was was originally revealed. <br>  <br>  We kow that the bible is not a complete record. Much was changed lost and added to it and THATS what the prophecy refers to.|`|1e86a17cf7d3d6bd5f1d1eb0376ee828aa	Considering it was God who told Joseph Smith to translate the Book of Mormon, and it was God that gave him the ability to translate it, no I'm not worried in the slightest. <br>  That passage does not say anything about restricting God from giving us more scripture, it just warns man about messing with God's Book. I guess you could look at it as God's copyright on the Bible.|`|8ubAwaGCaa	Not original at all, and not remotely frightening, either.<br>  <br>  The Bible did not exist at the time that passage was written.  Or do you conveniently ignore a similar curse in Deuteronomy, which by your logic would have to be applied to the New Testament?<br>  <br>  It cannot logically apply to the Bible, only to the Revelation.  And since we're not in the habit of changing scriptures to suit our beliefs (that's the job of other Christian churches), it really doesn't apply to us.<br>  <br>  Fight against us if you want.  That's your choice.  I won't love people, including you, any less if you do.  But ask yourself why it matters to you.  Are we really that threatening to your sense of security?  If so, why?  Are you built on a sandy foundation, or do you fear that we might actually have something precious to share?|`|yTAXDL5Jaa	if we are going to go wih the arguement that deu, adn revelations are the only tw books that have this warning then the Joseph smith footnotes in the mormon KJV bible still violates the warning in both books by adding footnotes to both books.|`|QGLKOIlBaa	There's actually an apostle in the "Mormon" church who talked about this very topic. You might find it interesting. I've provided the link below.|`|jnHwmvSkaa	I don't see why Mormons should be any more concerned than the 3rd and 4th century Christians who decided what was considered "the Bible".|`|dqZrq7Zeaa	that could be bad news hey?|`|f16e83e5ece08e271bbb4cdb0d855ee3aa	Revelation 22:18<br>  For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book:<br>  <br>  The Book of Revelation is a BOOK. Not the Bible, which is full of separate books, but all put together for us to learn. Why fear something when they never added on to the Book Revelations?|`|fLpzKulAaa	Doesn't it also say something like that in the Old Testament, in Deuteronomy or somewhere.

Religion was materialized to satisfy the fear that people have about the inevitability of death and to make them feel more secure to know that they have some "grand purpose" that we cannot fully understand until death.|`|sohnrZDcaa	They'll never find out! <br>  <br>  Ecclesiastes 9:5,10 (NIV) For the living know that they will die, but the dead know nothing; they have no further reward* (*The grave is the final reward!), and even the memory of them is forgotten* (*Not true in all cases, but what the heck this is God’s word!). [10]   WHATEVER your hand finds to do, DO IT WITH ALL YOUR MIGHT* (*without any restriction just be wise!), for in the grave, where you are going, there is neither working nor planning nor knowledge nor wisdom.<br>  <br>  Ecclesiastes 3:19 (NIV) Man's fate is like that of the animals; the same fate awaits them both: As one dies, so dies the other. All have the same breath; man has no advantage over the animal. Everything is vanity.<br>  <br>  The writers of the Book of Job admitted the same destiny for humankind… <br>  <br>  Job 7:9 (NIV) As a cloud vanishes and is gone, so he who goes down to the grave does not return.|`|fjidmhxsaa	Absolutely NOT POSSIBLE.<br>  Nice try... try another line or angle<br>  <br>  Genesis 1:1 In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.<br>  <br>  This opening verse of the Bible is unique, the foundation of foundations, probably the first words ever written down, either revealed to Adam, or even written directly by God Himself. One who really believes Genesis 1:1 will have no difficulty believing the rest of Scripture. God (Elohim) is eternal, existing before the universe, and is omnipotent, having created the universe. Therefore, nothing is impossible with God, and He alone gives meaning to everything. No attempt is made in this verse to prove God; it was recorded in the beginning when no one doubted God.<br>  <br>  No other cosmogony, whether in ancient paganism or modern naturalism, even mentions the absolute origin of the universe. All begin with the space/time/matter universe, already existing in a primeval state of chaos, then attempt to speculate how it might have "evolved" into its present form. Modern evolutionism begins with elementary particles of matter evolving out of nothing in a "big bang" and then developing through natural forces into complex systems. Pagan pantheism also begins with elementary matter in various forms evolving into complex systems by the forces of nature personified as different gods and goddesses. But, very significantly, the concept of the special creation of the universe of space and time itself is found nowhere in all religion or philosophy, ancient or modern, except here in Genesis 1:1. Appropriately, therefore, this verse records the creation of space ("the heaven"), of time ("in the beginning") and of matter ("the earth"), the tri-universe, the space/time/matter continuum which constitutes our physical cosmos. The Creator of this tri-universe is the triune God, Elohim, the uni-plural Old Testament name for the divine "Godhead," a name which is plural in form (with its Hebrew "im" ending) but commonly singular in meaning. The existence of a transcendent Creator and the necessity of a primeval special creation of the universe is confirmed by the most basic principles of nature discovered by scientists: (1) The law of causality, that no effect can be greater than its cause, is basic in all scientific investigation and human experience. A universe comprising an array of intelligible and complex effects, including living systems and conscious personalities, is itself proof of an intelligent, complex, living, conscious Person as its Cause. (2) The laws of thermodynamics are the most universal and best-proved generalizations of science, applicable to every process and system of any kind,<br>  <br>  John 1:1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.<br>  <br>  This is a very strong assertion that Jesus is God. The eternal Word, who was to be made man (John 1:14), is God (not merely "a god" as some have alleged) and is the same God who created heaven and earth in the beginning. In fact, He is the only "true God" (1 John 5:20) who was there "in the beginning."|`|058c0a6721fd75ea37d3898781c14da8aa	It is better to believe than not to believe....<br>  <br>  If God doest exist will no big deal at all.....<br>  <br>  But what if God exist? what will you do then? are you ready to face that if it is real and in the hour of your dead are you ready to face him?|`|0lwGsRNqaa	I would just stop existing because without God there is no other explanation how we could be here.

One of the reasons for homosexual population having higher incidences of diseases is the significantly higher incidences of promiscuity in the homosexual population. Given the many diseases associated with homosexuality, the Bible prohibition against homosexuality is arguably one of the many examples where the Bible exhibited knowledge that was ahead of its time.(cut & paste) <a href="http://www.conservapedia.com/Homosexuality_and_Health" rel="nofollow">http://www.conservapedia.com/Homosexuali...</a><br>  <br>  What most religious people don't accept is the latter. The Bible treats homosexuality in Leviticus in a similar fashion as it does ham or shrimp. Both at the time were health warnings in a manner of speaking. And as it is used in the rest of the Bible it is referring to promiscuity and not the act of love between two people. <br>  <br>  But today we have identified the health concerns and it is safe to have ham and shrimp. As long as we don't become gluttons.|`|2zd9OjeMaa	There aren't any. Anyone claiming AIDS or STDs needs to realize that heterosexuals get diseases as well and that lesbians actually have the lowest rate of them.|`|ZjSgawcpaa	No. There is nothing wrong with people who are gay.|`|HSaVBaiaaa	It's not wrong. It's completely natural, and there's more animals that have homosexuals too. <br>  For my opinion, I think it may help humanity out at the moment more than heterosexual couples. Homosexual couples can adopt kids, which can help the huge population in the world. Heterosexual couples just repopulating and repopulating, giving the world as many humans as we have now. If we continue like this, we will have to go through some huge drastic changes.|`|tqQIcLb5aa	Homosexuality isn't wrong. Homosexual sexual relationships are. It stands to reason.<br>  <br>  It is an act of purposely producing pleasure by inserting one man's penis into another man's rectum.<br>  <br>  Think of it in terms of that and let it sink in. Then ask the question again. It's not civilised it's hedonistic.|`|muHctmaGaa	There is no reason in the Bible, or at least, not one that's currently relevant (like past admonishments against rape victims). Scripture should not be taken out of context. Leviticus also advocates domestic violence and slavery. Other abominations include lying, wearing garments of the opposite sex or mixed/synthetic fabrics, sex while menstruating, remarrying a divorced spouse, and the oft-quoted eating pork, birds, and shellfish. The word translated as abomination originally just meant unclean and wasn't as harsh in condemnation. And the word used about "man lying with man" was the same used for rape in several other passages relating to heterosexuals. Sodom and Gomorrah was not about homosexuality at all, but corruption and inhospitality, and can be disproved just by the fact Lot tried to stall the crowd after the angels by offering the use of his daughters. What good would that be to gay men? And how holy was Lot to sacrifice his daughters (who later got him drunk and raped him anyway)? Deuteronomy said not to bring sodomites into the house of the lord, but has at least three crazy ideas on how to handle rape, 22:23-24 actually suggesting that abuser and victim be stoned outside the city together and another that they should be married after she's been defiled through violence.<br>  <br>  The fact that homosexuality is found among animals in both sexual activity and pair-bonding shows that it's natural, and thus acceptable if not intended. Biologically speaking, you need every being capable of producing and raising young, but to spread resources cannot have everyone doing so. Jesus didn't mention homosexuality at all among other deviances like adultery and prostitution, suggesting that he probably doesn't mind. You have to remember that marriage was not originally a religious (or specifically Christian) ceremony but a civil contract where only the lucky few married for love. Gay marriage is a state decision, but it shouldn't be inconsistent with the evolution of Christian doctrine. I don't see how Christians can so vehemently oppose love and family; Jesus wouldn't.|`|ef7b5627ea09eab595bfe61385dabaefaa	That is like asking, is there any other reason outside the Driver's Manual as to why it is wise to leave space between your car and the car in front of you on a highway?<br>  <br>  Well, this simple statement/rule/instruction/direction is there for our benefit. If we get too close and the vehicle in front of us stops short, we have a rear-end collision. An unnecessary exchange of insurance info and because of ignorance, your insurace goes up. However, if you applied that principle, that collision would have never happened.<br>  <br>  Question is, how many different places do you need to see that leaving space between you and the next car while riding on the highway is safe. Remember, that Manual is designed to protect you and if you abide by it, you will have many years of driving.<br>  <br>  Similarly, how many reasons do you need other than the Bible that shows that homosexuality is wrong. We live in an era where people want a written law for everything. Such people look for loopholes so as to get away with anything. How sad?<br>  <br>  Just as that Manual is provided for our benefit and protection, so too the Word of God (the Bible) is designed to benefit and protect us so that we have a righteous standing with Jehovah God.<br>  <br>  we read at Romans 1:26, 27 (New Testament in Modern English by J.B. Phillips:<br>  <br>  “God therefore handed them over to disgraceful passions. Their women exchanged the normal practices of sexual intercourse for something, which is abnormal and unnatural. Similarly the men, turning from natural intercourse with women, were swept into lustful passions for one another." But thereafter, most importantly, it accurately details the effects of homosexuality:<br>  <br>  "Men with men performed these shameful horrors, receiving, of course, in their own personalities the consequences of sexual perversity."<br>  <br>  The Bible accurately depicts the results of this practice. However, why do these adverse traits appear in “their own personalities?” The apostle Paul says it is because they engage in that which is “abnormal and unnatural.” Advocates of homosexuality say that what makes something “natural” or “unnatural” is purely subjective, and is a matter that must be decided by each person for himself. However, is that really the case? <br>  <br>  Read this part carefully. Is it not obvious to virtually all persons that male and female are counterparts, opposites sexually? Is it not apparent that their sex organs were designed to “fit” together? Here are more scriptures to support your question:<br>  <br>  Leviticus 18:22: “And you must not lie down with a male the same as you lie down with a woman. It is a detestable thing.”<br>  <br>  Rom. 1:26-28: “That is why God gave them up to disgraceful sexual appetites, for both their females changed the natural use of themselves into one contrary to nature; and likewise even the males left the natural use of the female and became violently inflamed in their lust toward one another, males with males, working what is obscene and receiving in themselves the full recompense, which was due for their error.”<br>  <br>  1 Corinthians 6:9: “What! Do YOU not know that unrighteous persons will not inherit God's kingdom? Do not be misled. Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men kept for unnatural purposes, nor men who lie with men.”<br>  <br>  Jude 7: “So too Sod′om and Go?mor′rah and the cities about them, after they in the same manner as the foregoing ones had committed fornication excessively and gone out after flesh for unnatural use, are placed before [us] as a [warning] example by undergoing the judicial punishment of everlasting fire.”<br>  <br>  Two Words: Sodom and Gomorrah. That city was gorged with homosexuality. Jehovah God destroyed that city with fire and sulphur, indicating his righteous anger upon that city and its inhabitants who engaged in that practice. As you know, sulphur stinks. Imagine a disaster like that now. I am sure that you are aware of the term "Sodomy." It does come from the activities that took place there.<br>  Something to think about.<br>  <br>  Part of Ancient Rome's downfall was due to homosexuality. Remember the expression: "Decadent Rome." I wonder why?<br>  <br>  It is vital that we not let the society dictate what is good and bad. At one time, homosexuality to many was disgusting. Now, it is the norm. Will that be the case with pedophilia? Bestiality? We cannot even direct our own steps. (Jeremiah 10:23) Yet, we need to rely on Jehovah God, live by his righteous principles every day of our lives and not be guided by this world, which is ruled under the evil influence of Satan the Devil. (1 John 5:19; Revelation 12:9)|`|rcPnnfmmaa	There are plenty of reasons but no good ones.<br>  <br>  The person who said AIDS should know that you can spread it just as well through heterosexuality.

It was ground-breaking.<br>  <br>  This reason assumes that habitual misuse, abuse, or weird use of biological functions is "wrong"... something like inducing the "natural" reaction of vomitting because you feel fat... and, well... because birds and cats and things regularly vomit, so it must be natural.<br>  <br>  Then again, the human male's brain that for whatever reason tells him to be sexually attracted to another man is clearly malfunctioning -- or, in other words, there is no argument that can show that such a brain is functioning rightly, while all our biological knowledge implies that a "properly" functioning human brain would not so function.<br>  <br>  This reason, then, assumes that developmental defects, being caused by mutagenic environments and delivered haplessly by our genes, are "wrong" and should be corrected or managed, if we know how.  Obviously, some defects screw us up more than others.  A sixth finger might not really hurt us, while a malformed mouth or nose can potentially be a serious problem.  Mental deformities bring a wide range of consequences, and certainly, most of us have some degree of mental defectivity in some form.  Probably those defects in most urgent need of corrective attention are those that threaten lives, while those that have little observable or foreseeable effect on life can perhaps be ignored.  Where does homosexuality, or the compulsive desire not to reproduce, a condition that apparently "nobody would choose" if they had the choice, fall in that scale?<br>  <br>  But what do we do, since we're such good and intelligent people, following common sense instead of a God who we presume doesn't actually know right from wrong?  Out of compassion, we chant over and over and over again phrases like "there's nothing wrong with it" until we utterly believe them, so that those afflicted with anti-reproductive conditions won't feel bad about themselves.  Out of pity, we refuse to address substantially life-altering mental problems, insist that they cannot be addressed, and try to build up legal walls against the very possibility of addressing the problems in the future.  And then, out of charity, because we're such good people, we turn and insult all those who still claim that the problem exists at all, call them "haters" and "bigots", boycott their businesses, hold demonstrations to defame them, sue them in court wherever possible, and thumbs-down them en masse on Yahoo Answers.  Yes, we are such good people...<br>  <br>  Hm.  Maybe homosexuality isn't the only mental defect we should be concerned with.  We perhaps should also consider the "wrongness" of homophilia.|`|naI5hGjHaa	It's not wrong, it occurs in nature too.|`|tmfhieP7aa	nope, I couldn't find anything.|`|DDYIrSKOaa	AIDS

From apostates the faithful have received the severest persecutions. Judas was rebuked and immediately betrayed his Lord into the hands of His enemies, because Satan entered into him.<br>  <br>  There is a superior intelligence bestowed upon such as obey the Gospel with full purpose of heart, which, if sinned against, the apostate is left naked and destitute of the Spirit of God, and he is, in truth, nigh unto cursing, and his end is to be burned. When once that light which was in them is taken from them they become as much darkened as they were previously enlightened, and then, no marvel, if all their power should be enlisted against the truth, and they, Judas-like, seek the destruction of those who were their greatest benefactors.<br>  <br>  What nearer friend on earth, or in heaven, had Judas than the Savior? And his first object was to destroy Him. Who, among all the Saints in these last days, can consider himself as good as our Lord? Who is as perfect? Who is as pure? Who is as holy as He was? Are they to be found? He never transgressed or broke a commandment or law of heaven—no deceit was in His mouth, neither was guile found in His heart. And yet one that ate with Him, who had often drunk of the same cup, was the first to lift up his heel against Him. Where is one like Christ? He cannot be found on earth. Then why should His followers complain, if from those whom they once called brethren, and considered as standing in the nearest relation in the everlasting covenant, they should receive persecution?<br>  <br>  From what source emanated the principle which has ever been manifested by apostates from the true Church to persecute with double diligence, and seek with double perseverance, to destroy those whom they once professed to love, with whom they once communed, and with whom they once covenanted to strive with every power in righteousness to obtain the rest of God? Perhaps our brethren will say the same that caused Satan to seek to overthrow the kingdom of God, because he himself was evil, and God’s kingdom is holy.”|`|AA10975334	You have a point, BUT why should we encourage people to read anti Mormon literature? It speaks out against the church and spreads rumors and this and that. It is pretty vile stuff. <br>  <br>  One thing I can say is there are people out there that were completely against the LDS church until they actually attended and started learning the principles that we TRULY teach. They begin to realize that the LDS church teaches wonderful principles. These are principles that are based on love and service as well as our own safety and health.

The Holy Ghost's "job" is to testify of truth and I know the Holy Ghost is part of the Godhead.  So, I know this information also comes from God.<br>  <br>  OK.<br>  <br>  Now, having this knowledge, when I see the words of MEN who make claims that are contrary to what I have already been told by the Holy Ghost... I refer back to my Heavenly Father.  He can't lie, and He won't.  I don't understand why people would trust men rather than God.<br>  <br>  Think of an absolute truth you know.  Something you KNOW is 100% true.  Now, imagine people telling you the opposite, even presenting some compelling evidence.  Do you trust them or do you trust what you already know?|`|dqZrq7Zeaa	I got sick of muslims saying that to me about the Koran so I read it. And the Hadiths.

It was public record.<br>  People who rely on belief only just choose what they want to believe.<br>  With something as weighty an issue as this, I would not believe anything unless God showed me and I had my own personal witness.<br>  I do believe only God can tell us the truth personally by revelation of the Spirit.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I was raised Mormon. <br>  I was always taught that I needed to find out for myself the truth. <br>  I have done that and am satisfied.|`|66bb11f746dab3f91de4830e79c7f479aa	It should, but not all books are worth your time.

Anyone that says "we have a Bible and we don't need more than that" do not understand God. He teaches line upon line to the pure in heart. The Koran stems from Mohammad's teachings from the Angel Gabriel. One teaching he later denied. How credible are these teachings which are so easy to define as hate teachings? No prophet can save anyone but themselves ("for even Daniel, Noah, and Job can only save themselves") These were good prophets who did their best. Moses sinned - could not go into promised land. Abraham sinned - lied to Prince received Hagoth did polygamy and gave us the Muslims that hate all Christian Infidels. Hinckley sinned when he said "All is Well In Zion" Gen. Conf. 1996. See 2 Nephi 28.<br>  The Mormons are a condemned church due to their belief in polygamy (an "abomination" never of God: Jacob 2:23-24 with D&C 132 embellished & added in later), masonry (satanic blood oaths in temples), taking away priesthood from women and African Americans as given in early years, and Altering the Book of Mormon. The "plain and precious truth" were taken out of the "Book of the Lamb" with the second printing in 1837 as prophesied would occur from "the great and abominable church." Jesus Is the Only God and Is the Eternal Father!<br>  See original Book of Mormon, 2 Nephi 28, D&C 64:40, D&C:112, D&C 124 = condemnation of the church and need for a cleansing.|`|fxp8qIsIaa	how can a person pass judgement on any book without reading it first.

I wish I had.<br>  <br>  While there's made up and distorted information on Mormonism, most of what I now read is credible and completely ignored by the faithful.  They are told to do so.  Once you open your eyes to credible evidences, you find false prophecies, hidden history that matters a great deal, a priesthood restoration that was made up, and almost no evidence to support the First Vision and many other truth claims.  That's why I'm pleased to have left Mormonism for something much better.|`|2ZO7vFC1aa	Of course.  <br>  <br>  Not that you're saying this, but I disagree that reading anti-Mormon literature is necessary to form an opinion of the Book of Mormon.  As far as passing judgment on the anti-mormon literature itself...yeah, if you haven't read it, you can't really pass judgment on it.|`|1e86a17cf7d3d6bd5f1d1eb0376ee828aa	With the anti-Mormon literature I do not pass judgment on what I haven't read but I am cautious about reading something from someone who has made it their career to hate everything I stand for and know to be true.

The authors of Genesis would not have been concerned with details such as where other people came from. The stories of Adam and Eve and Cain and Abel were probably entirely separate before the Genesis authors contrived to join them up.<br>  <br>  Adam and Eve didn't exist. The story is a myth that seems to be a way of explaining why hardships came into the world, and - like the Greek Pandora myth - women are blamed. The cultures that devised these myths considered men as godlike and women as inherently sinful, and were punished by being cursed to bear children. <br>  <br>  Part of the punishment was to toil with the land. So there's an element of explaining the change from nomads to farming, which then led to villages and towns illustrated in the myth of Cain and Abel.<br>  <br>  The serpent bit seems to explain why snakes crawl on their bellies.<br>  <br>  Cain offered crops and Abel offered livestock. Neolithic man my have farmed livestock before planting crops, and there may been conflict between those who grew crops and those who kept livestock about the use of land. The myth may have reflected this conflict.<br>  <br>  But civilisation developed from crop farming. And Cain built a city, naming it after his son Enoch. The land of Nod probably referred to wilderness.<br>  <br>  So the description of God favouring one brother's sacrifice over the other, and the consequential killing (perhaps a symbol of war), and the building of a city, might originally have been a symbolic rendering of how civilisation developed in the Middle East.|`|AlybkawCaa	The problem is that Adam and Eve were not the first humans on earth. The first humans were created here almost one million years ago.  When the physical and mental development of humans about 38,000 years ago started to peak; God then sent two biologically uplifting material Sons of God, named Adam and Eve, to this planet.  Adam and Eve did have many highly perfected children who did go out and mate with the best of many millions of humans living on earth back then.  Cain killed Abel and then Cain went out into the land of Nod (Nodities, Nephilim) and selected a superior stock human wife.  This biological uplifting of Adam and Eve, 38,000 years ago, is the start of "modern man" that our scientists today have discovered.  Yes, Adam and Eve partly defaulted; but some of their dominant genes are carried in many humans worldwide today. This will slowly improve the average man and woman to be about 8 ft tall, maybe 300 plus IQ, and they will have about a 300 to 500 year lifespan here.<br>  <br>  The Bible does mention that these (Adam and Eve) Sons of God mated with humans; and there were some giant-sized humans.|`|kX0T1urdaa	Adam and Eve had many daughters too. <br>  <br>  Gen 5:4  And the days of Adam after he had begotten Seth were eight hundred years: and he begat sons and daughters:|`|14b43c5bae3d09bf80336812c8aece34aa	according to texts "not included" in the Bible both cain and abel had twin sisters.<br>  <br>  These also tell me that after the birth of their third son Seth, God removed the sin of lust from their eyes and they had no more children.|`|ATPPWOpWaa	Genesis 3:20<br>  Adam named his wife Eve, because she would become the mother of all the living.|`|muHctmaGaa	One of the excluded texts Goldar mentioned, that would answer your question, is the Book of Jubilees.|`|5beb7432151cb15beb08a71c97dde6e2aa	Adam and Eve... they had other children (probably hundreds) than just Cain and Able

FkVMOTZtaa	we as a species learn to hate much easier than we learn to love. (from what iv come to know as the truth)Sadly some will never learn, but that must never make us stop trying. <br>  <br>  That being said, and you say this happens at your school? Maybe if thier were more activities that ALL the kids could do together and help one another to achieve the same goal would help. Studying each culture to a T. (i know they say they do this already but they become fixated on certain groups which can actually make others not in that group angry)|`|Lcr9FGS1aa	the question is thousands of years old,and the answer is the same...some people just hate,and always will,but you cannot sink to that level,you must learn tolerance ,even if they cannot..|`|a457e9a42af7d95c857ddbcfefd4f337aa	That's a tricky one.  You might talk to a counselor or teacher about starting an interracial council with like minded kids.  Maybe if you all meet, you could come up with some ideas.  Keep in mind that most racists are insecure about themselves and race is an easy thing to pick on to make themselves feel good.  I think probably the best thing you could do is be an example.  Also, does your school have an anti-bullying policy?  If it does, racial taunts probably fall into that category and you could perhaps approach it from that angle.   Good luck.|`|E1qJY3Zcaa	Mind your own business.The only way to change peoples minds are to exhibit a behavior that is not consistent with their belief.In other words be a good person and don't promote your heritage as being different.It's ok to be proud of your heritage but keep it to yourself.|`|dUglyCKDaa	Just tell them that to pick on people because of their race, thats picking on their identity, who they are, and that is the rudest disrespectful thing you can ever do to a person.|`|f180924fa608a1843cfd44f843639824aa	Report this bad behaviour to the Principle of your school.|`|8la1kUh3aa	If you can stand up for others, you should be willing to stand up for yourself.

Like the old adage says, "the more complex a person is, the more complex their toys will be." While that's not universally true, it is a good template for long-term Dungeons & Dragons players, especially those who have been playing the game since the early days of the seventies and early eighties. Some of these long-term campaigns have given rise to authors such as Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman (authors of the original Dragonlance saga) and R.A. Salvatore (creator of the dark elf, Drizzt Do'Urden). The game draws heavily from influences such as Tolkien, and many movies of the Eighties such as Dragonslayer, Willow, The Dark Crystal, Labyrinth, etc. all show heavy influence from the game in turn.<br>  The 4th Edition of the game is out, but "it's not your father's Dungeons & Dragons" to turn a phrase. It has gotten much more polished, and has more in common with the game structure of a computer MMORG than it does the old Dungeons & Dragons.|`|UOIcXs7Haa	Yes i know a few people who play it, not my cup of tea but i suppose it's good fun for people that don't like computers games and prefer using more of their imagination.|`|T38lIQ8Gaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  Apparently yes, it's still going strong; the Deluxe 4th Edition rule-set was released in October last year.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|8jK33jK1aa	Yes, they do.

XLXncQu9aa	Two reasons.  The first is because of the past harms our leadership has done unto many other countries abroad.  Many of our past leaders have created a republic that was so bent upon global diplomacy.  It wasn't so much that the leadership we had wanted to dominate all countries, but when you look at it in perspective that is what we have done in the past.  We have always tried to leave our footprints wherever we have been.  For example, Teddy Roosevelt was the one who implemented a foreign policy that involved using force to keep peace and to harbor global diplomacy.  He was sort of the "global police" in his time.  Also remember the atomic bomb?  That incident caused the U.S. to be looked at fearfully rather than respected.  It was something that we still deal with today.  We have broken foreign relations because of past leaders that have failed at true foreign policy.  <br>  <br>  The second reason is because of what America stands for.  America symbolizes freedom.  Many countries abroad do not allow their citizens to vote for leaders, or to live how they choose.  We have most basic freedoms that others don't.  We don't have a dictatorship but a democracy.  A great example is that of Al Quad-ea.   The terrorist group lamented their hatred for our customs.  They hate us and want to fight us because we support freedom while they don't.  They hate our way of life.  Our way is taboo to them.  Basically to sum this up.  We are hated because of past harms done and our way of life.  Many cannot accept that we have religious freedom or that we have a society that supports all walks of life that is normal to humans.  I don't want to fight with anyone else anymore than you do, but a price is always paid for freedom.|`|QP8LdPLeaa	some want to bring down america either because:<br>  <br>  our freedom of religious belief<br>  or just the fact that we are smart enough to allow freedom'<br>  maybe supplies<br>  power<br>  or maybe even our brutal ignorant history (read the history books)<br>  <br>  dude we're always not going to like each other. we will always find a reason to fight, we will always find a reason to send innocent soldiers into war and die for nothing. just way this pathetic human race is. kill kill kill.|`|596ba0725523b654ae88f9a7d31dae51aa	Right now the USA is the most powerful nation on Earth. Not like we once were, but we're still hanging in there. Many people simply resent us for our power-- even though we have a long history of saving the world, like in World War I, and WWII, and others. (And in the process we never keep the lands we conquer, unlike every other nation in the world.) They also resent us for the high standard of living we have, which they wish they could have. We achieved these things due to our freedoms, especially the individual freedoms that allowed people to do the work they wanted to, own land, and say what we want. <br>  Still others resent us for our freedoms. Especially radical muslims. They see the religious freedom we have, they see that women get education, they see that we can drink alcohol, they see that women can drive and don't cover themselves from head to toe, and they HATE us. They don't just hate the immoral actions we choose to take, they hate that the government does not take these free choices away from us. Their culture enforces behaviors on people. They see that ours does not, and they think we are literally evil. they hate your freedoms. They are in the minority in their culture, but they are a strong and dangerous force. We can't say "sorry" to them. They hate the ideals our country was founded upon, the ideals that have made us so successful.|`|UxJMk38aaa	The US has did a lot of bad sh*t, that's why.

sfTPrMFpaa	One classical example can be Corneille's:<br>  <br>  Va, je ne te hais point.<br>  Go, I hate you not.<br>  <br>  This type of figure of speech (the litote) is a kind of understatement which is often used in French. Here the girl is saying she loves a man pretty much, but not in those words.<br>  <br>  Often people will use this figure of speech in French, but most strangers do not understand the real meaning when they hear it.|`|f582421fab21195960a57126a91727beaa	well, i really don't think this fits the question very well, but it's the only one i could think of...<br>  <br>  If you say ''  I'm going to take you to Paris/restaurant/any place " and translate it into french it comes out as " I'll have sex with you in Paris" (if you said it to a stranger it would imply rape)|`|FYR9nQjdaa	My first language is Spanish so I know many words to say I love you. In english I just know "I love you" or "I like you" but in Spanish there are many words to say you love someone like "Te quiero", "Te amo" or "Te adoro" but my uncle felt those words weren't strong enough so he developed "Almatura". That might be the strongest word to say "I love you".|`|h7CvumEmaa	i think that you are mistaken a little bit.  the reason why slumdog millionaire did so good in the united states and won so many american movie awards is because we could understand that all he wanted was the girl, and this really touched our hearts.  and i think that love is pursued more heavily in the us than in other parts of the world.  because we basically only have love marriages and not arranged marriages here. <br>  <br>  that being said, i think one example of a romantic word that loses its meaning in english is the spanish word "negrita".  it literally means a little black girl.  it sounds horrible in english but really cute in spanish.

Ltx89w04aa	Well, heterosexuals are encouraged to marry to promote stable and long-lasting unions, right?  Why would that be any different for a gay couple?<br>  <br>  Theoretically, if you're married, you're more likely to work on problems and stay together, rather than up and leave if, say, you were just living together.  Theoretically as well, a two-parent household provides more structure and stability for the family unit - and yes, gay couples DO have children.  They adopt, use surrogates or donated sperm, etc.<br>  <br>  Allowing gays to marry would give them rights they do not currently have, such as being in the hospital with their loved one, being covered under their spouse's insurance, custody of the children, etc.<br>  <br>  Many gay couples have been together longer than hetero couples have been married.  Many children have been raised in gay households - they didn't necessarily turn out gay themselves, but they did just as well as anyone raised in a heterosexual household.<br>  <br>  There is no reason why gay couples shouldn't be allowed to marry other than personal prejudice.<br>  <br>  Edit - Punctuation is what is throwing you answerers off.  It should be "real, rather than simply passing, commitments."|`|rUgC7SPsaa	A lot of gay couples have "real" commitments to one another.  Gay Marriage is a way that they can affirm their commitment to one another as a recognized and legal union; to have a "real" ceremony, a "real" anniversary, a "real" marriage certificate....  the same way that heterosexuals do.|`|ygxM1Zkaaa	i don't understand your question. couples that take on "real". take on real what? huh?|`|7f8a3e83576852c330a34f1d06267fecaa	ditto in agreement with ello, what are you asking??

AA11232725	Obviously you are assuming that one could know that a baby would end up getting punched. But I'll answer your question with a pertinent question.<br>  <br>  If you knew that you were going to be punched when you were a baby would you rather be killed before you were born? Or would you rather face one of many hardships that we all face in different forms in this life and have a chance to move on and see what the rest of your life had to offer you?|`|9d43ec02a222734089d9cf48ceafea47aa	your mind baffles me. hypothetically of course|`|eO2rnf7yaa	The problem with the pro-abortion folks is that they think about  only death and evil as choices.   Your "question" presents an utterly false choice.   The correct thing to do toward any human creature - at any stage of development, is to protect that person.   That includes babies and mothers.|`|6173ede5e3ea0a8b44522ccd89de7fe0aa	What do you mean by "punched"? <br>  My decision NOT to abort my baby has nothing to do with what other people choose to do to their own babies after their born.

THAT'S the question, not whether anyone condones punching live babies.|`|MEny7pBHaa	if the 100 babies survived, then it would have been well worth saving the one life. if 100 babies have to suffer brain damage to procure one embryonic person who for all we know will defeat diseases in our time or gain some serious ground in our warfare then the sacrifice won't be in vain. the sick thing is that same logic is used by people to justify killing. all that matters is life, and where it ends up, not what it goes through in order to get there.|`|2C8U7Itqaa	I hate the name pro-life, because a majority of pro-lifers are for the death penalty.

AA12383652	Do you really think that changing the dynamics of the family unit in the US wont have an impact on society?<br>  <br>  Look what the glamorization of single parenthood has done for our society.<br>  Look what the treatment of just marriage in general as something that can be tossed out whenever has done to the family unit and our society.<br>  Look at the impact of blended families and people having new kids with new spouses has done to society.<br>  <br>  Do you not think that society now saying, once again, that a mother and a father just isnt that important to the children or the family unit in society is going to have zero impact?<br>  <br>  I am so tired of the political correctness BS.  We should all be worried that kids no longer are raised with a concept that raising their families in a loving home with both parents (mother and father) is important or the most desired arrangement.  EVERYTHING in our society that tells the next generation that this arrangement is no longer necessary or ideal is a problem because you can link soooo many of society's problems on the fact that this family unit is no longer considered sacred or precious or important.<br>  <br>  I dont care if you think you can be the best single parent or the best gay couple or the best parent of a child even though you are having kids with multiple partners or forcing that kid to accept a mixed family, the combination of all of these factors are taking the concept of the traditional family, mother and father in a loving home raising kids together, and stomping it out of our society.  And this is having a very negative affect on our society.<br>  <br>  It is NOT about the parents.  It is NOT about just the "love."  We come together as a society to figure out what is best for that society to function.  Upholding, preserving and encouraging traditional families are whats best for our society to function.  Raising kids with both their mothers and fathers is the best way for society to function.<br>  <br>  I am tired of people acting like if you want this ideal upheld and preserved then you are some kind of bigoted monster.<br>  <br>  How scary and sad it is and has become that those that fight to want to keep the concepts of mothers and fathers in our childrens lives important in our society, are the ones that are bashed.<br>  There was a time when that concept was actually considered important and good and the fact that if you want that unit to stay important then you are the one reviled proves my point that gay marriage is having a negative impact on the family unit and the roles of mother and father in our society right now!<br>  <br>  <br>  I am not going to apologize because I want the mother and father raising their kids together to remain important and ideal in our society and if people want to claim I am a hateful bigot for that, well sobeit.<br>  It just proves my point.|`|DqtSdgtPaa	There's a gay couple that live next door to my grandfather in Cairo and they ruined the sanctity of any future marriage I could have.

Most churches would suffer a great loss to be without the faithful and hard working women of the congregation!<br>  <br>  As for the role in the church, read 1 Timothy 2:8-15.<br>  <br>  1 Corinthians 11:3 says, "But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God. "<br>  <br>  Properly understood, this is not demeaning to women, any more than it is demeaning for Christ to submit to God.<br>  <br>  In fact, husbands are to love their wives as Christ loved the church AND GAVE HIMSELF UP FOR IT, and husbands and wives are told to "be subject to one another"! (Ephesians 5:21-25)<br>  <br>  Only when there is an abuse of these roles is there a situation that tries to make women inferior.<br>  <br>  As for importance in the church, "There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus." (Galatians 3:28)<br>  <br>  Some say the role of women in the church is just Paul's opinion or a cultural thing.<br>  <br>  Paul, however, said that the reasons for the women's roles he outlined was because of the order of creation and that the woman was deceived first. (1 Timothy 2: 13-14) This takes it out of a cultural realm by going all the way back to creation.<br>  <br>  Also, in the context of discussing the role of women, Paul says in 1 Corinthians 14:37, "If anyone thinks himself to be a prophet or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things which I write to you are the commandments of the Lord."<br>  <br>  Here Paul said the things he taught were "the commandments of the Lord". This is not just Paul's opinion, but even if it were, whose opinion should you trust -- modern preachers or an INSPIRED APOSTLE?|`|WcuU7IZ7aa	that is VERY touchy subject isn't it.

kK4GG6Z2aa	I agree with others. You hear the word of God in church or even by speaking it out in faith. i.e. if you are feeling low or even happy you can use the psalms to speak out your feelings and praises. Eventually these words get right into your soul and can lift your spirit.  Also as someone said - in those days there were very few who could read I suspect and don't forget the New Testament wasn't written in print immediately.  Paul of course sent letters but other than that things were not written as a book-many years after Christs death everything was heard by word of mouth.<br>  <br>  I have particular uplifting verses that I read out loud when things are tough which let's me know how God feels about me and gives me faith.Also when I am particularly happy I also sing praises to him about his goodness etc...mind you singing praises happy or sad always brings about faith and a sense of well being.<br>  <br>  Someone once told me that the Bible is just words - which in essence it is.  They said - before you open it for study - ask the Holy Spirit to reveal what Truths God wants you to know or learn today.  It is quite amazing when one reads a passage and something literally jumps out of the page at you for a particular situation in your life.  When you may well have read that passage over and over and seen nothing particularly relevant at the time.  That to me is hearing and by the nature of the revelation ones faith is increased.  So even to those who perhaps are not in a church at the moment there are many ways to hear the word of God.  Also on radio stations and tapes.  Peace and Blessings to all.|`|qcEzJDY6aa	In those days books are not yet in public as we do now, Reading the word of God now and understanding it by yourself is the best, because you won't be able to receive any uncertain commentaries by professing ministers of Christ.<br>  Let the spirit of God speak to you personally, just do some serious understanding of the word.<br>  Matthew 10:20 For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you.|`|Rn4GXoJAaa	I don't think it has to be taken in such a technical sense, but I have heard several times that the idea of "silent reading" is a very recent phenomenon.

Also, most people were illiterate.<br>  <br>  Just thoughts.|`|Rlvo5P9maa	Hearing, as in knowing. Since most things were spread by mouth back then and not written down on a mass scale, like today's holy texts.|`|P0WyZU8Uaa	Birdy,  No question is silly if you want an answer to it.  Romans 10:16-21 are referring to Israel rejecting the prophets.<br>  <br>  v. 17  So then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God. <br>  <br>  It is literally the spoken word of the prophets in this case.  You may want to check out the following Scripture references to enhance your understanding.<br>  <br>  v. 16 ... Isa. 53:1; John 12:38<br>  v. 18 ... Ps. 19:4; I Kings 18:10<br>  v. 19 ... Deut. 32:21<br>  v. 20 ... Isa. 65:1<br>  v. 21 ... Isa. 65:2|`|0a35bd8efe64caf91fcf1e0cf5d79e07aa	It is not a silly question. I have heard a pastor preach a sermon on this very thing. His take was that if we will read the word aloud we will get more out of it. Sometimes I do read aloud and it is true that there are less distractions from my reading at those times. I think that spiritual hearing is more important for growth than physical hearing but that physical hearing can promote spiritual hearing. Have you ever read instructions for a recipe or something silently, and it did not make sense, then read it aloud with a 'Let me get this straight,' attitude? It is pretty much the same thing. God bless.|`|wRsSodTAaa	Yes, it is great to read it aloud.  But for individuals who are deaf, "hearing" for them would simply mean to read and understand it.  But there is power in the spoken word.  <br>  Faith comes by hearing the Word of God.<br>  When you hear it, you remember it and can hide it in your heart.  When you need a scripture, it is just a heartbeat away.<br>  God Bless. <><|`|7FPvEWb4aa	The emphasis of this verse is meant to be not on 'hearing' as you have suggested but rather 'the Word of God'. And there are 2 Greek words for "Word".  One is Logos and is used more often.  The other, used here in Romans 10, is 'Rhema'....and both have their place....but Rhema, used here proves to be the heart of the verse.  If you don't know what 'rhema' is then you will not understand this verse.<br>  <br>  Rhema is a personal and specific word from someone.  It is the heart-to-heart, personal word...the close stuff.<br>  <br>  You see, your faith grows when you see God work in your life personally and specifically.  When God demonstrates Himself to you in ways that are undeniable.  I can gladly say I have had 20 or more clear Rhema's in my life that make it clear God is who He says He is....kind of a miracle in a way but more personal....and as a result my faith has grown.<br>  <br>  "Faith comes from hearing the personal and specific word of God".<br>  <br>  iamnotbut....I know I AM.|`|gHSarVD1aa	Those who have ears, let them hear.<br>  <br>  It is to understand the words.

By hearing with our physical ears, it means going to church to hear messages, listen to encouragement such as your friends or music - just listening to anything that helps you feel closer to the Lord. <br>  <br>  Also, it's nice sometimes to just sit in a quiet place and say, "God, I'm listening." and from there just sit quietly to hear what He speaks to your heart. Sometimes you might see an image, or just get a warm and comforting feeling. Other times you might literally hear something in your mind - almost like a thought. Just sitting and listening to God is an act of hearing Him, and that is definitely important when it comes to growing faith.<br>  <br>  Reading the Bible is another way to hear His word of course, but you don't have to read it out loud to yourself unless you feel that it's what you need to do.<br>  <br>  Aww, no, this question isn't silly at all, it's actually quite common! I hope my answer was able to help you understand better.<br>  <br>  Take care!!!|`|yhFJzscmaa	Probably both, but I think that many people totally ignore the physically hearing part. You will find no instructions in the Bible to read the Word. Certainly, in the early life of the Church, like the first 1500 years, this was the predominant way of taking in the Word of God.|`|c99jycZIaa	The Word of God is the message of the Gospel. It is the Words contained within the Bible.

I have not always understood why, until later, if at all.<br>  What about it?  I talk to myself all day long.  I know God hears me.  I can and do read out loud.  It helps me comprehend it better.

I would risk dying myself. And if the baby dies, once again I would not be accountable for his/her death.

The trend over the last several decades is towards more acceptance of gays.  There can be backlashes but the trend is irreversible.<br>  <br>  Are you old enough to remember the campaign in Dade County, Florida, about 30 years ago, to ban gays as teachers in the public school system?  Anita Bryant became the chief spokesmen of Christians and political conservatives.  Her argument was that gays were all pedophiles. Gays couldn't reproduce, the argument went, so they depended on recruitment to perpetuate their lifestyle.  This argument sounds outrageous today, even comical, and even Christians have (wisely) left it behind, but back in the 70s there were campaigns and ballot initiatives all across the country with the basic message that if we allowed the gay lifestyle to exist, some gay was going to molest your kid.<br>  <br>  We've come a long way towards accepting gays!  No matter what you or I think about it, that progress is going to continue.  You can slow it down but not stop it.  Whether or not Prop 8 survives a constitutional test, it won't make much of a difference in the long run.|`|VLv3Vzjnaa	I'm praying that Prop. 8 is overturned.  However, slow down a moment.  We law-abiding, taxpaying, gay Americans will never accept being treated unequally under the law or as second class citizens.  If Prop. 8 stands, we will place a measure on the ballot to allow same sex marriage.  If that fails, we will do another.<br>  <br>  In 2000, the pro-homophobia vote was 61% against gay marriage.  In 2008, it was 52%.  That's a loss of support for homophobia of about 1% a year.  This means we will reach 50% support around 2010.  Time is on our side and we will never give up till we achieve complete equality.  Enjoy your time gloating over taking away other Americans' civil rights while you can.  We shall overcome.<br>  <br>  Yesterday in San Francisco, huge crowds gathered outside the Supreme Court for the oral arguments on Prop. 8. The hatred shown by "Christians" was unbelievable, shocking and heart breaking. One poster stated, "Dan White was right, he killed a f*g!"  (But they really "love" us....)|`|r8rykCkGaa	Sure and glad that gay marriage will be outlawed as this has been an unfair thing with the voters voting against gay marriage twice and yet the gay protesters insisted on going against the law to get rights they didn't deserve.

It doesn't make sense except that they want all the rights they are not supposed to have.|`|23033d499769542e5e7910234a60e4f7aa	The war is not over...  Prop 8 is but a skirmish...

Perhaps when the US is comparable to many third world countries, in regards to how they treat a sizable chink of their own citizens, then you will realize how disgusting your behaviour and attitude is. Marriage was around long before the "bible", your god, or your religion had anything to say about it. It was a business contract then, and still is today. Perhaps you should picket divorce court proceedings, if you really want to uphold the sanctity of marriage.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  *Serendipity: You are a truly disgusting human being. I think you should find your own term, as I am not comfortable sharing the title Human, with the likes of you. Marriage is not about procreation, Its about love, and sharing your life with the partner of your choosing. Perhaps you should rethink your opinions on people using a sperm bank or adoption....as many of your "straight" counter parts do the same.

Not all cause disturbance. Some are very attached to certain places or people and want to be around that place or person.<br>  Ghost as we call them. Are beings who just do not have a gross material body as we do. They have a subtle material body made of mind, intelligence and false ego, but have the desire to enjoy as we do with our material gross bodies, but they cannot. They are very mentally strong and can have the tendency to effect us folks with the gross bodies. But not all ghost are of that nature.<br>  Ghosts generally live alone and have no contact with other ghosts, so another reason for their wanting attention and some relationship with someone. <br>  Some just want to be in places such as churches as they feel some solace there.<br>  It is said in Eastern literatures, that some of the reasons for getting a ghosts body is.

73f37851c35d22949c704d293473d5cbaa	No.  Like most topics, you can find Biblical support for either side if you look hard enough.<br>  <br>  Shakespeare once wrote, “the devil can cite Scripture for his purpose.”<br>  <br>  That said, there are many passages in the Old Testament that support capital punishment, often for relatively mild offenses:<br>  <br>  - Adultery (Leviticus 20:10)<br>  - Blasphemy (Leviticus 24:16)<br>  - Breaking the Sabbath (Exodus 31:14 & 15)<br>  - Disobedient children (Exodus 21:15 & 17; Leviticus 20:9)<br>  - Homosexuality (Leviticus 20:13)<br>  - Not being a virgin on your wedding night (but only if you're a woman - Deuteronomy 22:20-21)<br>  <br>  Some people cite Romans 13:1-7, which states that all governments are sanctioned by God, and if the government dictates something – like capital punishment – then it is God’s will (one could also use this passage to legitimize abortion).  However, I have yet to see a coherent reconciliation of this passage with governments like Hitler’s Germany, or Stalin’s Russia, or Pol Pot’s Cambodia, or any of the hundreds of others that were responsible for horrible atrocities throughout history.  Governments are run by people, who are – inherently – imperfect.  This is why the U.S. has a system of checks and balances, and why our laws are constantly changing (remember, there was a time when slavery was legal, when women couldn’t vote, when there were no child labor laws, etc.).  This argument simply does not fly.<br>  <br>  The New Testament (starring Jesus) is primarily ANTI-death penalty. For example, in the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus praises mercy (Matthew 5:7) and rejects “an eye for an eye” (Matthew 5:38-39).  James 4:12 says that GOD is the only one who can take a life in the name of justice.  Romans 12:17-21 warns us against answering evil with evil, and assures us that God will see to justice in the afterlife.  In John 8:7, Jesus says, "let he who is without sin cast the first stone."<br>  <br>  There are many, many practical problems with capital punishment (that I won't get into here), but purely from a moral standpoint, it is pretty clear that Jesus did not support it. True Christians shouldn't, either.|`|9BeUbORtaa	No. Even leaving spirituality aside - morally, legally, practically, financially - it is very hard to justify capital punishment. Most Western nations have acknowledged this. <br>  <br>  Then, of course, for Christians there is the small matter that our Saviour was publicly put to death by the state.|`|AA11232725	I don't "support" the death penalty in that I'm all for it. I have serious misgivings about taking the life of a person when sometimes innocent people are executed and their innocence is only discovered after it's too late.<br>  <br>  However, from a Biblical standpoint I see that even though fallible men are called to maintain law and order here on earth, the death penalty is a penalty that God has ordained.<br>  <br>  Genesis 9:6  "Whoever sheds man's blood, By man his blood shall be shed; For in the image of God He made man.<br>  <br>  Romans 13:3  For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to evil. Do you want to be unafraid of the authority? Do what is good, and you will have praise from the same.  4  For he is God's minister to you for good. But if you do evil, be afraid; for he does not bear the sword in vain; for he is God's minister, an avenger to execute wrath on him who practices evil.<br>  <br>  There is also the deterrent factor involved.<br>  <br>  Ecclesiastes 8:11  Because the sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.|`|e74d7fb53114fa13fe69e5302e1bf0c4aa	No I don't. No one has the right to take another person's life.|`|c1d312af4250951e942d357ba46d734caa	No because I don't think its our right to take anyone's life.  Its up to a higher authority to judge someone that far.  Just because someone murdered someone (or lots of someones) doesn't make the judge, jury, jailer or anyone else involved innocent of committing the murder of that murderer.  In my eyes its the same crime and the so called "rightful" murder of the murderer does not cancel the other out.  Its still another murder.  Thats just what I think.  Then again I don't think jails should be run like third rate motels with tvs and all kinds of privileges that out do the standard of living of some of our poor.  Jail is supposed to be a punishment.|`|KgYIYXEtaa	Yes, I do support it. Many people don't deserve life. Some people deserve death.<br>  <br>  Murder is the most damaging of all crimes. Only when a murderer is dead can their family and their victim(s) family(s) move on.|`|l1ctIW7eaa	no, there is not a single valid argument in favor of the death penalty.<br>  <br>  It is emotional revenge.  NOT justice.|`|OBid7Ozsaa	No. Love one another as Christ loves you...|`|39rXZUeQaa	Spiritually speaking, I don't believe that a government who can't be sure that who they convict is guilty should be in the business of executing criminals in the first place.

But you can't blot out blood with blood.|`|jg5Ii27Vaa	...The authorities that exist have been established by God. <br>  2 Consequently, he who rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves.<br>  ....4 For he is God's servant to do you good.

The justice system is not perfect, and people are sometimes wrongfully convicted.  It is also abused by governments (i.e. used to punish crimes much less severe than murder).  It is possible to protect society from criminals without killing them. It also costs more to execute a criminal (in America) than to keep him or her in jail for life, considering the cost of the appeals process, and considering many criminals are poor and require public defenders.|`|VHa5PIfpaa	I do NOT support the Death Penalty.<br>  <br>  In the old testament, the law as it was given to Moses was in essence, "an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth".  Meaning, if one man gets in a fight with another man and irreparably damages the other man's eye, he is to offer his own eye in compensation.  Furthermore, and this is the ultimate extreme of this old Jewish Law... if one man killed another man, he himself was killed to pay for the life he took.<br>  <br>  Jesus came along later and gave us Matthew 5:38-39:  "38"You have heard that it was said, 'Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth.'[a] 39But I tell you, Do not resist an evil person. If someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also."<br>  <br>  This has been a hard lesson for me in the past, but one I think I have at least reasonably learned.|`|91XGHfSaaa	Yeah, for capital crimes. These criminals tend to be repeat offenders and will never be rehabilitated. Prison is neither a deterrent nor a cure. We can't release them into society again, and why should the taxpayer have to pay to keep these "people" confined indefinitely?<br>  <br>  Here in New Zealand we're repeatedly seeing capital offenders paroled and committing further capital crimes. It's ridiculous. A dead rapist won't be raping anybody.<br>  <br>  When these people commit rape or murder and are found guilty beyond reasonable doubt, they should no longer have rights. They ignored the rights of their victims - why should they have any?<br>  <br>  Atheist, by the way. Ironically, I seem to be agreeing with a lot of Christians on this one.|`|7lmtBhdMaa	Yes I do support the death penalty. Here in Ct we had 2 guys do a "home invasion". They thought they killed the Father, (threw him down the cellar stairs), took the Mother and two daughters (One 11 and one 18) raped them after tying them to their beds and set fire to the house. Meanwhile the Father had gotten out and called the police. The Police caught them just as they were making their getaway. Both had just gotten out of jail weeks before. Now you tell me those S.O.B.'s deserve to live. If I had the say so they would already be dead, not waiting around for an appeal.

P5Iq6nufaa	Well, I am not so sure that you have the beliefs of our Protestant brothers and sisters entirely correct. Protestants believe that you are saved by faith, alone, in Christ but that faith naturally generates good works. It is a bit of a logical problem, as, logically, there is no authoritative manner on which to base your assurance of salvation, however Protestants tend to believe they are assured salvation, nonetheless.<br>  <br>  Now to the other hand. Protestants believe these things, but we know they are wrong. The attempt to justify that works naturally follow faith doctrine using any part of James 2 is feeble at best and a blatant twisting of the plain meaning of the words at worse. There is no Scriptural basis for "sola fide" or "sola scriptura", the typical Protestant refrains (John 3:16 and 2 Timothy 3:16-17) are clearly misinterpretations of the verse and intentionally ignore other verses that show that "sola" in both cases is simply wrong. <br>  <br>  But this is the inherent problem with Protestant doctrine. Every Protestant has been told that he or she is an inerrant interpreter of Scripture. There is no logic to this belief nor is it supported by Scripture. The road of Protestantism is littered with the likes of David Koresh and Tony Alamo due to this tragic doctrine. And if it were true, why are there over 30,000 different Protestant sects? That would seem to indicate a rather schizophrenic Holy Spirit one would think?|`|IIxy6ATwaa	Well, in all my honesty, Christianity was diluted as much as there were the splinter groups which had their own interpretation of scriptures. As for the Catholic church all teachings have been preserved in their fullness and entirety as there is only one teaching authority, that is the Magisterium and its interpretation is the closest to what the scripture really means and so we believe what the Catholic church teaches that Just accepting Christ is not enough. <br>  <br>  Accepting Christ is like accepting a wrapped gift, but then you will also need to open the gift, read the manual if it is a mechanical one and learn to use it, similarly accepting Christ is one thing and reading the Manual (The Holy Bible) and putting it into practice is another. So the one thing has to lead you to another. Works and Faith are two sides of the same coin. If one doesn't exist, it loses its value.|`|fOfJz9OMaa	"The devils also believe and tremble", is what is written; if you′re going to make mention of something, you had better mention it as it is, and not as you wish to portray it.  For when we see it as it is, then the understanding thereof is also made plain.|`|rIvp1BToaa	you are so  wrong  what  James was saying is  if you are saved   through the  blood  of christ  you will do God's will  those who claim  to be saved and are  not following God's plan  are lying.  it is only  through the blood of Jesus we can be saved  and I agree satan  knows God and Jesus are real  be living it alone  can not save  you  but only  accepting the blood of Christ and giving your life  to him  can.|`|90b77bbefba2eb318173c23604ffe4d2aa	Good point. We are to follow Jesus, be transformed into the image of Christ. This is true for all of us. Even those outside of Christianity can be transformed without even knowing Jesus. <br>  <br>  Oh... I think I see someone starting to light the fire...  is that a stake I see??  lol.|`|AA11824333	To believe Jesus exist is one thing, to believe in Jesus for salvation is another. You can believe that there is a god, but it's not the same as trusting in Him.|`|CugCzH9iaa	There is a huge difference in accepting Christ as your personal savior and knowing that  Father exists.  Satan knows he exist and shutters but he does not accept God as his God.|`|2hX0tLzIaa	They got it all wrong.<br>  <br>  You cant call Jesus your saviour without calling him you lord.<br>  <br>  But then again the catholics are wrong too cause you cant get to heaven by blindly following a bunch of rituals|`|PgWkqjeZaa	Expsoition reveals that Satan knows... he doesn't need faith, because he has seen.<br>  <br>  Humans, on the other hand, have never seen, so we require faith.<br>  <br>  You are also referring to one of the more difficult passages regarding faith versus works. James is not suggesting that works supercede faith, but in fact that we are justified by faith and this faith naturally results in works which have been fore-ordained for us by God.<br>  <br>  Even more to the point, since our works have been fore-ordained by God, it is not us working, but God working through us to achieve his ends. <br>  <br>  Faith does not give license to be lazy or uncaring; Rather, faith gives us the ability to see who we are in Christ and the need for continual struggling with exactly those concepts.<br>  <br>  Grace and peace to you!<br>  - Isaac|`|lXDAhSL4aa	True  or living faith results in salvation.  <br>  <br>  Roman Catholics believe Faith + works = salvation<br>  <br>  Protestants and Eastern Orthodox believe<br>  Faith = salvation + works<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.orthodoxconvert.info/1tim1_12-17.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.orthodoxconvert.info/1tim1_12...</a>|`|Z1dLsDdtaa	It is through faith not believing even the demons believe however its not through works either Buddha did good things but only faith in Jesus the son of the true God can save you.

Well what James was saying was Satan knows there is god (probably he knows better than us), but he won't get along with Jesus. <br>  <br>  So we need to SUBMIT OURSELVES before God, and worship him.<br>  <br>  I appreciate your question though.|`|mVSC9aKoaa	Follow the commandments..<br>  Submit to God|`|AA11648578	It is through faith that we are made new. You are made new through your heart  changed by the blood of Jesus not by the law..if the law had made man new there would be no need for the atonement of Jesus Christ. The law did not perfect one man but all can become new through Jesus Christ. You are clearly not understanding the process of salvation it is not through works you are saved but through grace you can produce works.<br>  <br>  As the verse says it's not simply believing in Christ but in accepting the atonement for your sin.|`|dYQUQGflaa	Protestantism is a lazy religion?<br>  <br>  Do you realize that there are CATHOLICS that claim to do the same as you are and do the opposite or don't do anything at all?<br>  <br>  Analyze yourself before others.|`|NWnOTkwCaa	Protestants believe what Jesus taught: "You must be born again" of the spirit.

Tell a Christian the Jews are right, or a Baptist vs. Hindu. Do you think any argument will make them convert?<br>  <br>  Well, I see with all the thumbs down, logic is the ultimate enemy of Christians. I say you're beliefs are based on faith & I'm marked "wrong". So, if it isn't faith, tell me the scientific proof.<br>  <br>  Trish, you make a good point, but I don't see any way to "debate" religion because of faith. I do believe we should be able to discuss the issue so we can understand each other better. I don't believe I can ever convince you to be an atheist & I would never try. I do like having intelligent conversations. One of my coworkers is very orthodox Jew. We had many discussions about our views. He thought I was hopeless, but we got along very well & I liked learning his views (even if I never agreed).
fYcYPyR3aa	A lot people are agnostic but say they are atheist because they don't understand what agnostic is. In one of my classes, we were asked what we believed, 4 were theists, 3 were agnostic (myself included) and 26 were athist. At the end once we had had explanations as to what each were there were 4 theists, 27 agnostics and 2 atheists.<br>  <br>  There are also people who say they are atheist because they think it's cool. I would say most people on here who say they are atheist know what they are talking about and are actually atheist though.|`|muHctmaGaa	Sounds like a case of I'm-spiritual-but-not-religious.

It sounds like this person is an agnostic theist as opposed to atheist. There are so many different classifications that sometimes it's just easier to call yourself an atheist. Some people might not even be aware of the different subgroups. I'm technically an agnostic atheist (I don't believe it's possible to know whether there is or isn't a god, but it's probably irrelevant.) but just call myself an atheist most of the time to reduce confusion.|`|31M2IDw2aa	It is very 'trendy' to be an atheist in today's modern world.  Many, many atheists join the herd to be in vogue.  They read a little Dawkins or Hitchens and take this dung hook-line-and sinker.  Hopefully life will teach these trendy fools a lesson or two and open their eye's to the fact that God IS.
xPeIvywdaa	i guess some see it as ok, while others see it as sin<br>  <br>  personally i wouldnt reccomend a tattoo..|`|bd861129d3433f1d5311b4b620b0955eaa	You need to read the Old Testament through a "New Testament filter" as I like to call it, especially the laws.  There are some laws that the New Testament did away with, like the dietary laws and ceremonial laws, but it did not do away with the Moral laws, the 10 commandments.  <br>  <br>  Things to consider about the verse that you quoted is that back then the other people in the land that the Israelites where in used the tattoos and what not as part of their religious practices.  That is one huge reason why God forbid them to get tattoos.  The other reason why such laws where given to them was so that they would stand apart from the other nations there.  <br>  <br>  As for yourself, idk if you plan on getting a tattoo or not, but do know that the New Testament really is silent on the issue.  However, if you listen to your conscience and it tells you that getting a tattoo would be a sin, then for you it is indeed a sin, because it is a sin to go against what your conscience tells you.  <br>  <br>  Finally, if it is a decision that you are pondering to make, then here is some practical advice on making a godly decision.  First pray about it, make sure it isn't a fleshly desire that you are pursuing.  Read the Bible like no ones business and see what God has to say about such matters.  Also, seek godly counsel, someone who is defiantly a Christian who may have been is a similar situation as you are right now.<br>  <br>  I hope that helps you out.|`|JTf3mptdaa	That's the old testament, otherwise known as the old covenant. The new covenant says next to nothing about tattoos. I only say next because i don't have it memorized by heart, so i could be wrong if I say nothing.

Many other non-Catholic Christians may disagree with me, but the Lord did say do not cut your bodies (Like Emos) or get tattoos.|`|Yfgf47lBaa	It depends.<br>  it does say to treat your body like a temple, and not cut, tattoo pierce etc.<br>  i am a christian, and i have a butterfly tattoo on my foot.<br>  <br>  and i know a lot of catholics and christians with tattoos.<br>  my friend, her sister passed away at the age of 21, and she got a tattoo for her sister, a dove on her back with her sisters full name on it...<br>  <br>  it also says in the bible that God put a jewel in the noses of the women as a sign of beauty...

His purpose was to create in himself one new man out of the two, thus making peace,<br>  <br>  The old laws regarding what you do with your body do not apply since Jesus came to bring the one truth, thus what he said on the subject goes. But he said squat on such things because they are not really important so long as you follow the two important commandments, to love the Lord above all and to love your neighbor as you love yourself. If you want to know what Christians have to say on the matter refer to <br>  1 Corinthians 10:31 (NIV)<br>  31 So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God.<br>  and ask yourself if you glorify God in what tattoo you get as well as<br>  1 Corinthians 6:19–20 (NIV)<br>  19 Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own; 20 you were bought at a price. Therefore honor God with your body.<br>  and<br>  1 Timothy 2:9 (NIV)<br>  9 I also want women to dress modestly, with decency and propriety, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or expensive clothes,<br>  remind you that bringing attention to your body may displease God. Ultimately it is up to you to decide whether or not the tattoo you are going to get is in line with your religious beliefs and I encourage you to find your own path.

I believe that is in 1 Corinthians chp 6<br>  <br>  God judges the heart. I think tattoos are fine as long as they aren't being dedicated to a demon god or some anti-god agenda.

65QqZBnjaa	Unusual questions, but I will answer:<br>  <br>  "Can a man who has had a sex change and became a woman have real orgasms?"<br>  <br>  No, but a transsexual woman can.  Calling us "men" is disrespectful, please don't do it.  I was NEVER a man.  If I was I never would have transitioned.  Yes, I can orgasm.  But it's not the same as before, the quality is that of other women.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  "Does the hormones change the voice or is it something that has to be practiced?"<br>  <br>  I find this question a strange one for someone who's just curious.  Anywho, estrogen does NOTHING for our voices.  We basically need to learn to speak all over again.  The process can take years.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  "And finally what about the scent of a woman?"<br>  <br>  This question has two parts really.  Hormones determine your body odor (masculine or feminine).  Once on hormone replacement therapy the body odor changes over time.  And after bottom surgery our vagina's eventually DO produce the same odor that other women have.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  However a word of warning to you:<br>  <br>  Estrogen does many other things too. Like...<br>  <br>  Kills your male sex drive<br>  <br>  Shrinks your penis and testicles<br>  <br>  Greatly reduces upper body strength<br>  <br>  Lead to increased emotional libidity<br>  <br>  Increased risk of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, both of which can be fatal<br>  <br>  and more.<br>  <br>  <br>  I warn you because I've heard many other men who THOUGHT estrogen was some kind of play thing or toy.  If that's what you're thinking DON'T DO IT.|`|oVeGMNsLaa	Yes, assuming she had a good surgeon, a transwoman can have real orgasms.  The new vagina is made out of the penis, so all the nerve endings are still intact.<br>  <br>  Hormones do not affect the voices of male-to-female transsexuals (it does deepen the voices of female-to-male transsexuals, though).  Transwomen have to simply train their voices, or take the less-traveled route of vocal chord surgery (which usually isn't necessary).  A good resource for you might be this:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciWIzpW_X20" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciWIzpW_X...</a><br>  <br>  I actually don't know about the scent of a transwoman.  I do know that transmen's genitals are often reported to have the faintest scent of bleach, which has always struck me as very interesting.

I don't know if you are in high school, but it seems to me most adults are pretty nice, or at least more civilized.

Other days if the person looks approachable I have actually stopped and had a conversation with 2 old ladies when I was walking home from school one day. They were very lovely.

We cannot help them, and they cannot hurt us. (Psalm 146:4; Ecclesiastes 9:5, 10) The soul dies; it does not live on after death. (Ezekiel 18:4) But sometimes wicked angels, called demons, pretend to be the spirits of the dead. Any customs that have to do with fear of or worship of the dead are wrong.—Isaiah 8:19. <br>  <br>  Eternal Happiness—In Heaven or on Earth?<br>  DOES your happiness depend primarily on where you live? Most people would readily acknowledge that happiness depends more on factors like good health, a purpose in life, and fine relationships with others. A Bible proverb puts it this way: "Better is a dish of vegetables where there is love than a manger-fed bull and hatred along with it."—Proverbs 15:17.<br>  <br>  Sadly, however, our earthly home has a long history of hatred, violence, and other forms of wickedness. But what about heaven, or the spirit realm, where many people hope to go after they die? Has it always been a place of blissful peace and tranquillity, without disturbance of any kind, as is commonly supposed?<br>  <br>  The Bible teaches that God resides in heaven along with millions of spirit creatures called angels. (Matthew 18:10; Revelation 5:11) These are described as spirit "sons of God." (Job 38:4, 7) Like humans, the angels also have free moral agency; they are not robots. It follows, therefore, that they too can choose to do right or to do wrong. Would angels choose to do wrong? It may come as a surprise to some to learn that thousands of years ago, a considerable number of angels did, in fact, sin against God—they rebelled against him!—Jude 6.<br>  <br>  Why Some Do Go to Heaven<br>  Many readers of the Bible, however, are aware of Jesus' words: "In the house of my Father there are many abodes. . . . I am going my way to prepare a place for you." (John 14:2, 3) Does this not contradict the idea of life everlasting on a paradise earth?<br>  <br>  These teachings are not contradictory. In fact, one supports the other. To begin with, the Bible states that only a limited number of faithful Christians—namely, 144,000 of them—are raised as spirit creatures to live in heaven. Why are they given this wonderful reward? Because they make up the group that John saw in a vision who "came to life and ruled as kings with the Christ for a thousand years." (Revelation 14:1, 3; 20:4-6) Compared with the billions on earth, the 144,000 truly are a "little flock." (Luke 12:32) Moreover, having experienced the problems common to humankind, like Jesus they will be able to "sympathize with our weaknesses" as they supervise the rehabilitation of mankind and of the earth.—Hebrews 4:15.<br>  <br>  Earth—Mankind's Eternal Home<br>  By providing the ransom sacrifice of Jesus Christ, God began gathering the 144,000 almost 2,000 years ago, and indications are that this group is now complete. (Acts 2:1-4; Galatians 4:4-7) However, Jesus' sacrifice was not for the sins of the 144,000 only, "but also for the whole world's." (1 John 2:2) Hence, all who exercise faith in Jesus have the prospect of eternal life. (John 3:16) Those asleep in the grave but who are in God's memory will be resurrected, not to heaven, but to life on a cleansed earth. (Ecclesiastes 9:5; John 11:11-13, 25; Acts 24:15) What will await them there?<br>  <br>  Revelation 21:1-4 answers, saying: "Look! The tent of God is with mankind . . . And he will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore. The former things have passed away." Imagine—humans being released from death, and the pain and outcry it causes gone forever! At last, Jehovah's original purpose for the earth and humankind will reach its glorious fulfillment.—Genesis 1:27, 28.|`|zmVCqh7Daa	READ:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://mylordandmylife.aforumfree.com/general-bible-discussions-f3/the-state-of-the-dead-part-1-what-we-are-t82.htm" rel="nofollow">http://mylordandmylife.aforumfree.com/ge...</a>|`|uTxIo22taa	I would say that maroon would be the best choice for your apartment.

The NWO / Satan’s Secret Society with its many branches have distributed occult paraphernalia into society in the form of games and occult practices. Some of the games include Ouija boards, tarot cards (divination), magic art (which is precursor to Transcendental meditation and the secret ceremony which I will discuss), Dungeons and Dragons and similar "fantasy games” just to name a few. Through the distribution of such practices the NWO / Satan’s Secret Society has placed many souls into spiritual bondage to witchcraft / demonic forces. <br>  Many people are not aware that they are held in spiritual captivity. Those that find out are in for an evil surprise! Is this the method that Hitler used to spiritually enslave the Nazi into committing genocide? The Mafia 666, seduces many people to participate in occult practices by there distribution into society. These so called games and practices have been distributed throughout society to cause spiritual bondage Rev 13 10. The NWO is fully aware that by this distribution they are able to enslave souls by methods of witchcraft Nahum 3, 4. If this causes a unholy baptism or the manifestation of the spirit of sin, I’m not quite sure. What I am sure of is that witchcraft works against those who have fallen into spiritual bondage / captivity Rev 13, 10. This is the method by which people are taken spiritually captive Rev.13, 10! <br>  I was forced with witchcraft / demonic forces to go through a transcendental meditation ceremony. The way it is done is quite amazing and almost unbelievable; but, by this spiritual bondage I was forced to go through three T.M. ceremonies consecutively. I was torcherd with mind control, sleep deprivation, Voodoo, witchcraft dreams, heart manipulation / palpitations, and many other forms of witchcraft. It sounds quite unbelievable but such is witchcraft. <br>  The three ceremonies I was forced to go through were performed in what appeared to be three different sections of the brain. I was assisted through the ceremonies by witchcraft. While in one of these ceremonies I was instructed to except the worship of one of their many "Gods" these were no gods but demonic entities one including Satan another they named Jesus. What better way to join all religions of the world under one banner of 666. "The powerful delusion"' / New World Order. When they said Jesus name I was tired, scared, and confused. I just said "yes Jesus". After said ceremony they knew my faith was strong and that they wouldn't control me and take me captive. They new I wouldn’t shut up and that I would try and warn everyone!!! They tortured me with witchcraft and continue to try to this day. They try to stop me from informing people how this NWO is distributing the “spiritual mark of the beast”. Yes, to the beast of my knowledge the mark of the Beast is a Spiritual Mark and it is received through the method I have stated.<br>  I had delivered a warning to what I understood to be the Mafia 666 prior to Desert Storm. After this is when the New World Order showed me Hell on earth. I guess their really is a Nazi reign in the U.S. and it is spreading like a cancer through out society. This is how they try and control / enslave souls and take captive Rev 13. 10. These are a few scriptures giving insight. “If anyone is to go into captivity into captivity they will go” Rev 13, 10. “They overcame by the blood of the lamb and the WORD of their testimony”. “They didn’t love their lives so much as to shrink form death”. “This calls for patience and endurance on the part of the saints” Rev. 12, 11. Have they been using drug dealers to terrorize your neighborhood? Are their many "Free" Masons and shiners in your Government? Have you received your spiritual mark? They are in the "Christian" Church.|`|zmVCqh7Daa	Are these really your reasons that you won't BELIEVE? Phooey! <br>  Come on that's wrong. <br>  <br>  #1 Satan makes all counterfeit religions to confuse people.<br>  <br>  #2 Retardation comes from inbreeding after there is too much inbreeding. That is when the diseases and mutations come. God ordered all incest to be stop during the time of Moses. Leviticus 18:6.<br>  <br>  #3 Just because "religious leaders" do it doesn't mean its right. Remember this: NOT EVERYONE THAT CALLS THEMSELVES CHRISTIAN IS CHRISTIAN. <br>  <br>  #4 Why? Because God does not punish. He is not responsible for sickness, suffering, or death. These come from sin, which originated with the devil. God is making a point in this great controversy by letting all see the results of Satan's rule. Satan claims to be able to run things better than God. <br>  <br>  #5 For me not to say he was always there is YOU saying that you don't want the answer. God is SELF-EXISTENT. Don't worry.

The further back the purer. You are just wrong there.<br>  <br>  3) Bibles are very reasonably priced. My father said, What you don't pay anything for, you don't value.

UPC is an Apostolic church. They believe in the Oneness of God, Acts 2:38 as the plan of salvation, and have a strict dress code.<br>  Assemblies of God, in the past, had more in common with UPC than they do today. Assemblies of God are Pentecostal, but no longer teach the basic Pentecostal doctrines their founders held to. They tend to fit in better with modern Christianity, telling people to accept Jesus, and that water baptism and receiving the Holy Ghost are not necessary for salvation.<br>  <br>  Edit for Granny: A classical Pentecostal church is one that still worships and believes like the Pentecostals in the early 20th century. This is in contrast to more modern churches that are more Charismatic than Pentecostal.<br>  Most UPC churches are classical, and some Assemblies of God are as well.|`|luwBPdE8aa	Most of the difference is over the doctrine of the Trinity; "UPC" believes in God the Father, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit, but does not believe these are three distinct "persons," and baptizes in the name of Jesus as it says in Acts 2:38, Acts chapters 8, 10, and 19.  Both believe that the "Spirit baptism" is for everyone.<br>  Chris is wrong; the UPC does not teach water baptismal regeneration.

0835d5aaaff88c49c30c004c7854c920aa	It's basically grammatical gender. "En" is for what used to be masculine and feminine nouns ("common gender") and "ett" is for neuter. As with most languages, there isn't any systematic way of telling which type a noun is so you mostly have to memorize it, but certain nouns follow predictable patterns, especially based on regular suffixes like -het and -ing. Virtually all of those regularly derived nouns in Swedish are en nouns The only one my dictionary lists as neuter is -eri (like tryckeri). Also, Latin-derived nouns with -um and Greek derived nouns with -on are usually neuter, like studium and lexikon. If you know German or some related language, you can often guess with related words, like German Haus and Swedish hus are both neuter, though this is not a perfectly reliable rule (German Apfel is masculine but Swedish ?pple (the fruit) is neuter, I would assume because the Swedish version picked up a diminuitive suffix since they also have the word apel for the tree, and diminuitives tend to be neuter in Germanic languages). Generally, in European languages with common and neuter genders, the neuters are less common (by 3 to 1 in Swedish apparently), so the easiest thing to do is assume everything is common gender by default and to just learn the unpredictable neuters.|`|T5DbLLgQaa	A thumb rule: If the word ends to a vowel => ett (ett ?pple/an apple), if it ends to a consonant => en (en bok/a book).|`|sGoEj6qsaa	en/ett till" means "one more"<br>  Ett till hus = One more house<br>  <br>  "annan/annat" means other/another<br>  En annan pojke=Another boy/One other boy
DtlQawvgaa	I have been working in the field of cults for many years and know many, many current and ex-JW. All Jw's will feed you the same load of bull that they do study the Bible without Watchtower material but they do not. They will say they have diffrent Bibles including the NWT but they generally do not!  Owning diffrent Bibles and studying apart from the Watchtower will get you kicked out of the cult. I know 5 Ex Jw who got disfellowshipped for simply using a King James Bible at Bible study.<br>  <br>  The cult teaches its members to lie to non Jw and mislead them away from anything negative concerning the cult.  They will deni or down play all negative aspects in order to make themselves look normal. Here is what the cult says about Bible study.<br>  <br>  All who want to understand the Bible should appreciate that the "greatly diversified wisdom of God" can become known only through Jehovah's channel of communication, the faithful and discreet slave." (The Watchtower; Oct. 1, 1994; p. 8).<br>  <br>  <br>  "We have the opportunity to show love for our brothers who take the lead in the congregation or in connection with Jehovah's visible organization worldwide. This includes being loyal to "the faithful and discreet slave." (Matthew 24:45-47) Let us face the fact that no matter how much Bible reading we have done, we would never have learned the truth on our own." (The Watchtower, December 1, 1990, p. 19).<br>  <br>  <br>  "No matter where we may live on earth, God's Word continues to serve as a light to our path and a lamp to our roadway as to our conduct and beliefs. (Ps. 119:105) But Jehovah God has also provided his visible organization, his "faithful and discreet slave," made up of spirit anointed ones, to help Christians in all nations to understand and apply properly the Bible in their lives. Unless we are in touch with this channel of communication that God is using, we will not progress along the road to life, no matter how much Bible reading we do." (The Watchtower; December 1, 1981, p. 27).<br>  <br>  <br>  "They say that it is sufficient to read the Bible exclusively, either alone or in small groups at home. But, strangely, through such 'Bible reading,' they have reverted right back to the apostate doctrines that commentaries by Christendom's clergy were teaching 100 years ago,..." (Watchtower; Aug. 15, 1981; p. 29).<br>  <br>  <br>  God Bless!|`|AA10671142	I read the bible everyday without anything else. we should read it everyday|`|f5IcUlXTaa	My husband has a witness man come to our house now for almost 4 years.  He confessed that he has never read the entire bible.  I don't think they have enough time to read it since they are kept so busy reading all the publications put out by the watchtower.  I would be worn out too.|`|AA10024451	Jehovah's Witnesses are constantly encouraged to read God's Word the Bible (by itself or with Bible aids) on a daily basis. <br>  <br>  Just like the Bible example of the Boreans who "examined the scriptures daily" to make sure their teachings were solidly based on the scriptures......Jehovah's Witnesses do the same.<br>  <br>  (We prefer to use the New World Translation. The King James Version is unreliable. Changes have been made to it to fit false religious doctrine. Things have been taken away from it or added to it that shouldn't be there......making it not at all a reliable translation.)<br>  <br>  - Part of using and accepting the Bible aids published is in an attempt to better grasp the Bible. It is what one who recognizes the "faithful and discreet slave" as Jehovah's channel on earth for dispensing spiritual food to all of us around the world (which keeps our unity intact) does. The last sentence of JC's comment is pure garbage and an outright lie. It's what those in his cult tend to do......twist and distort the truth in order to continue to slander Jehovah's Witnesses.<br>  <br>  - Also, Kip's answer is a complete lie. If he were really some kind of "expert on cults", he'd be able to see that Jehovah's Witnesses in no way fit that bill.|`|fxHEZGcCaa	Greetings,<br>  <br>  Witnesses are REQUIRED to read the Bible on their own. We also read and use standard reference works, lexicons and dictionaries from all types of authors. I personally have over 2000 books in my personal library, most of them reference works on the Bible or history.<br>  <br>  Logically, there are some which I have come to trust as being accurate and honest and others which I always double check because of their being less accurate or inconsistent. It is the same with the literature from the Watchtower Society. Through extensive study individual Jehovah’s Witnesses have come to trust the accuracy of the information the Watchtower presents. Through experience they have proven that all True Christians are associated with Jehovah’s Witnesses and this organization is the only one which gives solid evidence of being God’s congregation. So, we do not blindly follow any organization but we also recognize those who give evidence of accurate teaching and are obedient to them (Heb.13:17,24; 1 Thes. 5:12; 1Cor.16:16)<br>  <br>  <br>  We do not believe individuals can place their *own* interpretations on the Bible, which is what Christendom does. The Bible interprets itself (2Pet.1:20, 21; 3:15-16). And any personal interpretative efforts to get the sense out of Scripture will agree with the overall teaching of the Scriptures as well as with true Christian doctrine.<br>  <br>  We do believe individuals can understand the Bible on their own. Our magazines have given many examples of individuals who accurately understood Bible teachings without contact with Witnesses. Can they come to a *complete* knowledge of *every* doctrine on their own? The Scriptures and practical experience prove otherwise (we believe that where individuals are isolated, God will judge them by what they do know).<br>  <br>  The Ethiopian eunuch is just one example showing that mere access to the Word of God and personally reading it is not enough to gain a complete knowledge that leads to salvation. Only after Philip the evangelizer explained the prophecy to him was he was ready to be baptized as a disciple of Christ (Acts 8:27-38). That more is needed than merely reading the Bible by oneself can also be seen from Eph.4:11-13 (Cf. Mat.22:29, Jn.17:17). Another example is the resolution of the circumcision issue in Ac.15 (esp. 15:2,22-29; 16:4).<br>  <br>  However, God has always used an organized teaching method to disseminate his Truth i.e., Patriarchs, Prophets, Priests, and Apostles. The current method is the True Christian Congregation. Paul identified this channel to the Ephesian Christians when he wrote that "there might be made known *through the congregation* the greatly diversified wisdom of God, according to the eternal purpose that he formed in connection with the Christ, Jesus our Lord." (Eph.3:10, 11, Jn.6:67,68, Heb.13:17)<br>  <br>  Jehovah's Witnesses give evidence that they are that present day organization by their strictly following Scriptural truth and by their fruitage (Mat.7:16-19; Jn.13:34,35).<br>  <br>  (Prov 1:5,6; 3:4-7; 9:12; 11:14; 12:15; 13:10; Mat 13:36; Acts 8:30,31).<br>  <br>  Yours,<br>  <br>  Ron Rhoades|`|BzrUWCsDaa	Of course we are encouraged to read the bible by itself. It's God's word & guidance to us. How else would we be so well versed in the scriptures? <br>  <br>  These negative answers make me laugh. I dont think that you're gullible enough to believe them<br>  <br>  I have a few translations of the bible that I like to read & compare<br>  They all have the same message|`|97031ab5ff9bcf387a9d1278f60ddafeaa	Not just "allowed" but encouraged to read the Bible every day.|`|AA10407603	Of course they are... but the main reason people go to the faithful and discreet slave for help is because they read the Bible 1000 times and had difficulties understanding it. The witnesses are the greatest example of a group that has managed to eliminate 1 verse doctrines....so in order for them to take a scriptural thought seriously it must be backed up by at least 2 scriptural verses, usually allot more.<br>  <br>  When i first started studying with them i used my King James Bible. Even today i still use it sometimes. Its funny when i hear people saying that their Bible, The New World Translation" is corrupted because all their studies i did with other Bibles and they still taught me the same thing...they were just allot harder to understand.|`|0986bc76a0c64849cd314d95d205ad54aa	They believe if you read the bible alone, you  would go in to darkness.<br>  <br>  "If the 6 volumes of 'Scripture Studies' are practically the Bible topically arranged, with Bible proof-texts given, we might not improperly name the volumes- 'The Bible' in an arranged form. That is to say, they are not merely comments on the Bible, but they are practically the Bible itself...Furthermore, not only do we find that people cannot see the divine plan in studying the Bible itself, but we see also that if anyone lays the 'Scripture Studies' ... after he has read them for 10 years-if he then lays them aside and ignores them and goes to the Bible alone...out experience shows that within 2 years he goes into darkness. On the other hand, if he has merely read the 'S.S.' with their references, and had not read a page of the Bible, as such, he would be in the light at the end of the two years." (Watchtower, Sept 15, 1910)|`|mrMkKFqNaa	Yes, JWs are allowed to read the Bible by itself.  But, after reading the Bible, they are not permitted to express any interpretations that differ from what the "Faithful & Discreet Slave" (Watchtower leadership) is teaching.<br>  <br>  The fact that JWs may not adopt or express an interpretation of scripture that differs from the Watchtower is shown clearly in the 4/1/1986 Watchtower, pages 30-31.  <br>  <br>  The gist of the article is best summarized by one sentence from page 31: "Approved association with Jehovah's Witnesses requires accepting the entire range of the true teachings of the Bible, including those Scriptural beliefs that are unique to Jehovah's Witnesses."<br>  <br>  So, if a Witness reads the Bible on its own and comes to a conclusion that is different from one of the Watchtower's "unique" teachings, then this article gives the authority to expel this Witness from the congregation.|`|MSHxYrLEaa	Absolutely!<br>  <br>  we are real bible students, we don't just use the NWT (i prefer it because it is a 'literal' translation rather then a 'dynamic') in fact, most the answers i give on here come from the KJV.<br>  (and my grandad has over 30 translations in his library)<br>  <br>  the WT encourages us to read it by ourselves.<br>  <br>  in fact, the society 'assigns' (if that's the word you want to use) a section of the bible every week, normally a few chapters. and at our meetings we discuss things we found that was interesting within these scriptures.<br>  <br>  by doing this every week, we can normally get through the whole bible in about a year|`|uuQkTMiSaa	Unsilenced liones - If you were really one of Jehovah's Witnesses for 22 years, you would have known that we are encouraged to read the bible daily on our own and to keep testing that we are in fact, in the truth. But I wonder,... because you seem to know nothing of truth regarding the witnesses, your statement might actually be true!  Perhaps that is what happened to you...... that your satanic and occult ways have blinded you to the true facts about God!!|`|RPLsG63caa	where r u getting your info?

Every time someone exposes Watchtower history, theology or practices you call them a liar or biblically ignorant! You must really be deep in that cult boy! <br>  <br>  Rev.Kip is not a liar. All you got to do is due a little research for your self and see he is telling the truth!<br>  <br>  I myself know 2 Jw who was almost kicked out of the cult for asking an elder to conduct Bible study without Watchtower publications.  They wanted to change things up a bit from the same old read and repeat stuff they do.|`|xnYGZPSjaa	got_air<br>  <br>  You took the the article out of context. It doesn't say anything about not reading the bible without the help of the Watchtower, it only states you will not understand the bible without the help of the faithful and discreet slave.<br>  <br>  <br>  Answer to the persons question:<br>  <br>  If anyone says that Jehovah's Witnesses aren't allowed to read the Bible without the help of a watchtower magazine or publication are either ignorant or a total liar.<br>  <br>  Edit: I stand corrected. What you're saying is not in that quote. That quote talks about being helped by the faithful and discreet slave and not the watchtower publication.<br>  <br>  Edit: got_air<br>  You're making no sense now. On your previous statement, you stated that we cannot understand the bible without the help of a watchtower publication, that is not true. Nothing of which you quoted says that. All it states that we cannot receive the spiritual guidance outside of the faithful and discreet slave.<br>  <br>  Now if you were a bible reader, you will know this. The faithful and discreet slave is made up of anointed followers of Jesus Christ, and they helped the Christian congregation in their early stages.<br>  <br>  Why do you think the apostles and some of the other anointed Christians needed to guide the flock? Do you think Paul's teachings were not that important, because they had the scriptures at home? No. If you use this logic against the us then you can use it against them too.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Edit: I do not deny anything. Its just that you're interpretation based off of poor reading comprehension is making you believe otherwise.<br>  <br>  First of all, I never denied that the Faithful and Discreet Slave was the only channel through God, because this has been proven through the years of Christianity. <br>  <br>  <br>  You offered a quote from the Watchtower of 9/15/1910, yet you just prove to me that you haven't actually read that article. You based your own interpretation based off someone else, which is poor at that.<br>  <br>  Now, if you tried reading a little further into that article, you will notice something different. <br>  <br>  I quote:<br>  <br>  "Our thought, therefore, is that these SCRIPTURE STUDIES are a great assistance, a very valuable help, in the understanding of God's Word. If these books are to be of any value to us it must be because we see in them loyalty to the Word of God, and as far as our judgment goes, see them to be in full harmony with the Word and not antagonistic to it. Therefore, in reading them the first time, and perhaps the second time, and before we would accept anything as being our own personal faith and conviction, we should say, "I will not take it because these studies say so; I wish to see what the Bible says." And so we would study the Scriptures in the light of these SCRIPTURE STUDIES; we would prove every point, or disprove it, as the case might be. We would be satisfied with nothing less than a thorough investigation of the Bible from this standpoint.<br>  <br>  If, after doing that, we should find the books to be in accord with the Bible, then we would think we were logical in saying, "I will not need to go through that process now every time that I read the SCRIPTURE STUDIES, for I have looked up those texts of Scripture and know certainly that the New Testament proves all those points." If, at the same time, in any future reading, we should come to a place where something did not seem clear to us and we thought of some Scripture which seemed not as harmonious with it as we had previously thought, we would think it our duty to refer at once to the Scriptures, because the Scriptures are the standard, and in that reference to the Scripture it would be with a view to discerning whether or not we had been mistaken in our previous examinations."<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Its a fact that you haven't read this article, because this part of the article here disproves your point. The part of falling into spiritual darkness was based off their research, and it clearly states that they will not look into a publication if one doesn't want to.<br>  <br>  So unless you take the article into its intended context, you're going to be spreading false information, like you're doing right now.

All Catholics should (but don't) believe and follow the same teachings of the Church. We all receive Christ in the Eucharist and this unites us as one, to the Body of Christ. <br>  <br>  But, this doesn't mean that Mass is a big family get-together of warm fuzzies and hugs...it's not. In fact, Catholics are often accused of not being warm and friendly. But we don't need to be that way at Mass, we are there to worship, to receive Christ and it is a very individual thing. We do our group get-togethers during our activities outside of Mass.|`|FjiRPKp2aa	Part of the reason I became Catholic is that as an overall view and experience in my life we are more willing to actually lend a hand than other faiths that I have run across.

Believe it or not there are also words that blacks can say that whites can't and blacks can slam whites and that's okay, but if a white person mentions something bad or derogatory and  that a person is black in the same sentence, they are racist. Blacks can refer to a white, 30 year old male as 'boy' but a 13 year old black child is a man. Somehow or other this is called 'equality'.

Besides, what kind of world would it be if the hand of God stepped in every single time a child would have been abused or murdered. Think of the catastrophe that would cause.  There would be no faith in the world (because faith requires believing without seeing) and people would become evil and take it for granted that they would be protected from all harms.  There would be no reason to be cautious, nice to others or strive to be a better person because you'd expect God to fix things for you every time.  Besides, the devil has as much a hand in the world as God does and there needs to be a balance.  You can't have all evil or all good, it just doesn't work.  The person below me has a really good answer.|`|UinOWcMUaa	God doesn't make people do evil things.. they choose this for themselves !!|`|8ubAwaGCaa	I don't think that he allows it.  It's more like he can't interfere.  However, he is taking notes on who could have prevented it, and on who let our society decline this far, and on who actually does something to prevent things like this from happening.  You don't interrupt an experiment or a final exam just because you catch one of your students cheating.

That large headline appeared on the front page of a widely circulated newspaper after a devastating earthquake in Asia Minor. An accompanying picture showed a distraught father carrying his injured daughter out of their collapsed home.<br>  <br>  Wars, famines, epidemics, and natural disasters have caused immeasurable pain, innumerable tears, and countless deaths. Add to this the suffering of victims of rape, child abuse, and other crimes. Consider the huge number of injuries and deaths resulting from accidents. And there is the anguish experienced by billions of people because of sickness, old age, and the death of loved ones.<br>  <br>  The 20th century saw the worst suffering ever. From 1914 to 1918, World War I killed nearly ten million soldiers. Some historians say that it brought death to just as many civilians. In World War II, about 50 million combatants and civilians were killed, including millions of defenseless women, children, and elderly men. Throughout the last century, millions more were the victims of genocide, revolution, ethnic violence, hunger, and poverty. The Historical Atlas of the Twentieth Century estimates that over 180 million people died because of such "mass unpleasantness."<br>  <br>  The Spanish influenza of 1918/19 killed 20 million people. In the last two decades, about 19 million died from AIDS, and some 35 million now have the virus that causes it. Millions of children are left without parents—they died from AIDS. And untold numbers of babies are dying from AIDS, passed on to them when they were still in the womb.<br>  <br>  More suffering is being inflicted on children in other ways. Citing information provided by the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), at the end of 1995, England's Manchester Guardian Weekly stated: "In the wars of the past decade, 2 million children have been killed, 4-5 million disabled, 12 million made homeless, more than 1 million orphaned or separated from their parents and 10 million psychologically traumatised." Add to this an estimated 40 to 50 million abortions worldwide—every year!<br>  <br>  What of the Future?<br>  <br>  Many view the future with foreboding. A group of scientists stated: "Human activities . . . may so alter the living world that it will be unable to sustain life in the manner that we know." They added: "Even at this moment, one person in five lives in absolute poverty without enough to eat, and one in ten suffers serious malnutrition." The scientists took the occasion to "warn all humanity of what lies ahead" and said: "A great change in our stewardship of the earth and the life on it is required, if vast human misery is to be avoided and our global home on this planet is not to be irretrievably mutilated."<br>  <br>  Why has God allowed so much suffering and wickedness? How does he purpose to remedy the situation? When?<br>  <br>  God's Permission of Suffering<br>  Nears Its End<br>  <br>  <br>  EVERYWHERE you look, there is suffering. Some people bring it on themselves. They contract sexually transmitted diseases or experience the effects of drug or alcohol abuse or of smoking. Or they may encounter health problems because of poor eating habits. However, much suffering results from factors or events beyond the control of the average person: war, ethnic violence, crime, poverty, famine, disease. Something else that humans basically cannot control is suffering related to aging and death.<br>  <br>  The Bible assures us that "God is love." (1 John 4:8) Why, then, has a loving God allowed all this suffering to continue for so many centuries? When will he remedy the situation? To answer such questions, we need to examine God's purpose with regard to humans. This will help us to understand why God has allowed suffering and what he will do about it.<br>  <br>  The Gift of Free Will<br>  <br>  When God created the first human, he produced more than just a body with a brain. Further, God did not create Adam and Eve to be mindless robots. He implanted in them the faculty of free will. And that was a fine gift, for "God saw everything he had made and, look! it was very good." (Genesis 1:31) Yes, "perfect is his activity." (Deuteronomy 32:4) All of us appreciate this gift of free will because we do not want all our thoughts and actions dictated to us without ever having a choice in anything.<br>  <br>  However, was the fine gift of free will to be used without limits? In directions given to early Christians, God's Word answers: "Be as free people, and yet holding your freedom, not as a blind for badness, but as slaves of God." (1 Peter 2:16) For the common good, there must be boundaries. Hence, free will was to be regulated by the rule of law. Otherwise, anarchy would result<br>  <br>  A Marvelous New World<br>  <br>  Under the rulership of God's Kingdom, survivors of the end of the present system of things will be ushered into an earth cleansed of wickedness and suffering.|`|m07KvKBsaa	watching from the sidelines|`|GowsmaOAaa	That's why God created free will.

38vza5Gxaa	answer: only if they're interested in studying Kabbalah.  All Rabbis are familiar with Kabbalah, the background and basics but being proficient in it is another matter.  It's a personal field of study for Rabbis and non-rabbi Jews.<br>  <br>  No, there aren't levels of Rabbis.  There are some rabbis that are recognized as scholars in Talmud or especially versed in Torah but there aren't bishops, priests, cardinals, etc.  A rabbi is required to study the Torah and Talmud, Hebrew and other studies before being certified as a rabbi (which includes a year in Israel).  <br>  <br>  Kabbalah isn't a required study. Some are interested in studying it, non-Rabbis and rabbis alike. Most aren't.<br>  <br>  It was traditional that no one under age 35 and single could study the Kabbalah because of the maturity the very lengthy study required.|`|e1da218fa360d619acec56b3218b6e6caa	The kabbalah is a man made book.

4WqvTAfmaa	Consensual sex between adults of consenting age is no one's bloody business. <br>  <br>  I had two old maid aunts who lived together until death. They were not sexually involved, but they made a household as solid and constant as any married couple. Yet, when one was dying she did not have the rights of a spouse, and was treated as if she came in from out of town. <br>  <br>  As for adopting a child, I am adopted, and let me tell you something that is not in your Bible, old or new testament. What a child needs is love, caring, boundaries, clean clothes, hot food, and love. Did I mention love? Why in the world would you think a gay man or woman would give any less love than anyone else? Love. It is all about love.|`|iJzlRCkOaa	I'm not a Christian, so I'm not qualified to answer your question geared towards them.  I could give my opinion on the matter, but that's just based on a general knowledge of Christianity.  I don't know every Christian personally.<br>  <br>  So for the atheist question, I am 100% for gay marriage.  I don't even understand why the court can accept the appeals against it, because they're all related to religion.<br>  <br>  And yes, gays should be able to adopt children.  They can be very loving parents.  My best friend is gay and there is nothing he wants more than a family.  He will make a great father someday.  Plus, a child living with gay parents is way better off than a child living in an orphanage, regardless of your views on gay marriage.|`|AA11124121	Let's see..it's a sin.<br>  <br>  <br>  that's the only polite thing I can say..sorry.|`|8ubAwaGCaa	A different type of relationship requires a different recognition, silly.  I do try to stop people from cheating and getting divorces.  Twice my life was in danger because of the marriage I'm in now (I was a walking heart attack looking for a comfortable place to lie down), and yet I cannot bring myself to get a divorce.<br>  <br>  If I didn't care about harm people do to themselves, then I wouldn't be much of a Christian.  I also oppose adultery and fornication on similar grounds.  I wouldn't want two people who are already and currently married to other people to be able to marry each other (bigamy).|`|AA11096726	It surprises me that no one seeks to know or cares about the stats and the impact on all of us in society. There is a direct connection with the breakup of the family by divorce and homosexuality. The family has always been the bedrock of society and as it deteriorates so does society. Look around its easy to see. Why do many more children have problems today? Every study shows children need a dad and a mom for proper training and upbringing so that they have the best opportunity to be a benefit to society and not harmful. It seems to me that those who are pushing for gay marriage (never accepted in any civilization) don't care about anyone but themselves. Certainly not about children or society.|`|vrcxxRr8aa	I am not against gay marriage. I can see how much it upsets the religious, so I propose a compromise. Don't call it marriage, then. Call it a civil partnership or something, and let them have the same legal rights that married couples have. I know homosexuals deserve more than the isolation that that proposes, but at least they would get their rights, and hopefully the religious wouldn't have such a hissy fit over it. <br>   However, if it's possible, I fully support gay marriage rather than a civil partnership. <br>   Yes, I think they should be able to adopt children. Single parents seem to be able to raise their children just fine, so why not two mommies or two daddies? As long as they are sincere and have good parenting skills, I don't see why they shouldn't be able to adopt.|`|naI5hGjHaa	As a gay person, the government either needs to stay out of marriage all together (both for straights and gays) and leave it to the churches to decide.<br>  <br>  OR<br>  <br>  it needs to allow gay people to marry other consenting gay adults, just as it allow straights.<br>  <br>  it's called equality, and supposedly we are supposed to have a seperation of church and state.  but we don't.|`|7MPa7bxDaa	i don't think gay people should be able to get married in churches or in a christian way if the priest refuses.<br>  i respect christians and i don't think you should force anyone to go against their religion.<br>  <br>  yeah i think they should be able to adopt|`|8qctM0B4aa	i dont see anything wrong with gay marriage, what do people care about unless they are in the closet about something. i dont see how a gay marriage can affect anyones life but the two people that were married
MDgVPwU3aa	I'm confused|`|AnRTn8yAaa	If there's no sin, then there's no need for Jesus to redeem the sins that we made....<br>  <br>  Jesus said,"Only sick people need doctor... I come for the sick not for the healthy..."<br>  <br>  So everytime we see sin in ourselves we have to ask for forgiveness, that Jesus is more than willing to forgive...why..?

It doesn't abolish sins...|`|AA10748878	Sin is a condition by definition. Not an act. The acts of sin result from the condition.<br>  The word sin means to "fall short of a standard". In this case the standard is perfection. So we all fall short. <br>  That is why the "savior" concept is so important. You could never live up to Gods standard. That is why the gospel (good spiel) is good news.  The formula of new testament salvation reads something like ... All sin was paid for by Christ for the whole world but our part is acting in faith in that event so that the covering applies to you. And it is a gift.<br>  Could it be that easy? Sounds like a great deal to me.|`|lgYnTXDmaa	jesus took all of our sin upon his shoulders when he died on the cross. now instead of sacrificing animals to be forgiven, we can pray 2 god and ask for forgivness. everyone sins because we are human. so, jesus died so he could forgive our sins and not so he could make there be no sin.|`|Nk8jnyu8aa	Gladly.

By everyone that includes all the people who had lived and died before his time, all people of his time and all people who would come after him.  So now, babies are no longer born with Original Sin.  They are born innocent, with a clean start.  You can look up Original Sin, but basically the gist of it is that before Original Sin, there was no death.  So Jesus died for our sins to save you from death.  If you repent and believe you will live forever is the idea.  Obviously it doesn't mean that you won't die a mortal death, it means that you won't die a spiritual death so that while you're body will decay into nothingness, your spirit will live on forever on another level.  If you accept the gift and repent that is.

wB3AbJyLaa	You see, God makes sense of the resurrection. If Jesus of Nazareth really did come back from the dead, then we have a divine miracle on our hands, and a pretty powerful evidence for the existence of God. Without assuming the New Testament is inspired by the word of God. Personally, I think the very best explanation is the same one provided by eyewitnesses: That God raised Jesus from the dead. Here are the following four facts: Firstly, the location of Jesus' burial was widely known and agreed on. No competing stories contradict what the Bible says about this, and it's reported in very early information that came too soon for it to be based on legend. Secondly, the Sunday after the crucifixion, Jesus' tomb was found empty. Both Jesus' followers and those who denied that Jesus could be raised, like Jewish leaders and the Roman soldiers guarding the tomb, agree on the fact that the tomb was empty. Thirdly, on multiple occasions and under various circumstances, different individuals and groups of people experienced appearances of Jesus alive again, after the tomb was found empty. Lastly, the original disciples suddenly and sincerely came to believe that Jesus was risen from the dead. Sincerely enough to be will to die for that belief.|`|3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	Even before I ever opened a bible, I was aware of His presence.

Someone once did the math of 500 things being correct---an astronomical number in chance.<br>  <br>  Because no one has ever proved to the world that the bible has a provable lie or something wrong, and brother they have tried, then I really have to believe God is real.<br>  <br>  Show the Christian world one wrong thing:  And it will destroy the validity of the bible, and God, and Jesus.

How kinki.|`|73W7ReR9aa	Stats are stats and even if u use a condom during anal sex, there's about a 50% chance it will break and gays are a high ridk group for Hep C and AIDS.<br>  <br>  You're making a "collision decision" when u decide to have anal sex:(|`|n0WyMoX5aa	thats crap.. ive donated twice this year|`|tOz0CgDCaa	it's because statistics show that a large percentage of hiv infected blood originates from the gay population (this is a fact and not idealogy).  if you refuse to believe this fact then you're just being ignorant. i am gay by the way...<br>  <br>  you are correct that they test "the blood" , but they dont test your blood individually..they test the enitre  "pool" of blood donations from that day or even week..so obviously they would be "upset" if your blood happens to be infected with hiv and ends up tainting the entire "pool" of donations. <br>  <br>  it's not prejudice, it's simply a matter of statistics and "risk management".   obviously the blood supply is low.  dont you think they would accept blood from gays if it was prudent to d oso?<br>  <br>  they have to "throw away" the entire "pool" of blood...basically throw away all their donations of blood from that entire day, if one sample turns out to be hiv-infected.<br>  <br>  and sure some straight people have hiv, but to answer your original question "it's a matter of statistics."<br>  <br>  this is the truth whether you want to beleive it or not. it's a fact.|`|vaoH0FW5aa	are you canadian? because i know that they don't let gay men donate here in canada. look, i got offended too when i read the questionnaire, mind you that i am a gay woman and has never slept with a man, but still, it was offensive. but truthfully, if you feel the need to lie on the questionnaire, don't donate blood because they can't respect you and you shouldn't have to lie. that is just my opinion though. <br>  <br>  but back on the topic of the actual questionnaire, they need to realize that HIV/AIDS does not discriminate, and if there is a waiting time for the virus to be apparent in the blood, all of the donated blood should be screened at that time because anyone could have it.|`|TvTg82wyaa	It is a little bit offensive, but it's a "safety precaution" because... well... STDs do exist.<br>  <br>  It's offensive, but this one makes sense.|`|R7smL5mQaa	I suppose its more along the lines of safety precautions more than anything but I find it a bit unfair aswell..<br>  <br>  The reason I can't give blood is because I don't weigh enough and I'm trying so hard to put on weight but its just not working argh!!|`|VeXDGn62aa	The tests are not 100% accurate, but I still think it's unnecessary that they completely refuse our blood. I think you're overreacting in some parts of your question. If they don't want our blood, that's fine. We'll just keep it. It's no skin off my back. It irritates me though that the blood bank is always whining about how there's a blood shortage and for people to donate, yet they refuse blood from homosexuals, some of which WANT to help alleviate the shortage.

wTmNCQhcaa	If you look at Mesopotamia back then you will realize that every city-state had it's own god. Israel had "Jehovah" whereas Babylon had "Baal" etc. I think it's VERY possible that early on they believed that the other gods were real, but followed their patron god, Jehovah.<br>  <br>  Try reading the Torah without the concept that they were monotheistic... you won't find any evidence they believe their god is the only one that exists, simply that he is preferable to the other gods.|`|UWKF7x4faa	He has a Baal complex.

Yes He said there are other Gods beside Himself. The Bible also speaks of a well in the New Testament where they cast two Gods down because they had broken the laws of the lands. In the New Testament again Paul talks about Mercury and in the Old Testament they talk about Apollo. These are both gods. I believe that the Christian God is very adamant in that He will have no one worship another God other than Him. He even says He is a jealous God.

bi3XdkMEaa	Why do you ask us? You do not believe us nevertheless. The best way to find an answer is asking God for yourself<br>  BTW: Hubbard never stated having talked with God. He was angry that nobody was interested in his sience fiction book. So he made a religion of his book. Why? To earn money and to get honor of men.<br>  Joseph Smith was never interested in earning money. His bountiful manner buying land economically and selling without profit woke the enviousness  of the brokers and venturers and they started a lot of myths about Joseph. All money he gained by the members donating were spent in the work of God, of building a temple. <br>  Now! What has Hubbard done with his treasures?<br>  <br>  And if you believe or not! If you choose an anti-Joseph-answer or not:<br>  Behold, Joseph was a prophet, who got revelations by God.|`|CLB32006aa	L Ron Hubbard, he was already a science fiction writer before he started the religion...are you serious?|`|bEeozqacaa	L.

He lost children, family, friends, was beaten, tared, feathered, and was eventually murdered.  <br>  <br>  You could throw Jesus Christ on your list and argue that he was a con man for the same reasons.

It was finally decided that Christian, not being Jews, did not have to follow many of the things like dietary laws that the Jews did. That was decided for two reasons.

They were ancient equivalent of health codes.<br>  <br>  Besides, didn't Jesus warn against being overly legalistic?|`|49c07573b2ef8b7f4c512a10de7d7febaa	The law was meant for us, the Jewish people.

There are more important things in life than having a boyfriend/girlfriend.  It sounds like you have your priorities in order.  People today are just so obsessed with the relationship thing.  No one wants to be single for more than 2 seconds, and if you ask me it takes the specialness out of having a relationship with someone.  Does that make sense?  I think when people come across someone who waits they get defensive about their own relationship jumping and take it out on you.

The concept of God and a power we cannot control requires humility in the sense that you are not entirely in control of your life and that everyday things are more consequential then they seem.  So it seems to me that the concept of God is more terrifying then the Devil in that sense.  The devil you can blame your problems on and write off that way if you choose, God is is a more subtle and more difficult concept to accept, and rather then dive into the mysteries and possibilities of this world, Atheists choose to refuse the existence of such possibilities and deny that there is a God, Devil and anything connected to that that they cannot see or touch for themselves.|`|6a29fa9432cd11f6628b8d1ef1265ca6aa	No, I laugh at both of these fairy tales. <br>  <br>  People -- what have you done --<br>  Locked him in his golden cage.<br>  Made him bend to your religion --<br>  Him resurrected from the grave.<br>  He is the God of nothing --<br>  If thats all that you can see.<br>  You are the God of everything --<br>  Hes inside you and me.<br>  So lean upon him gently<br>  And dont call on him to save you<br>  From your social graces<br>  And the sins you used to waive.<br>  The bloody church of england --<br>  In chains of history --<br>  Requests your earthly presence at<br>  The vicarage for tea.<br>  And the graven image you-know-who --<br>  With his plastic crucifix --<br>  Hes got him fixed --<br>  Confuses me as to who and where and why --<br>  As to how he gets his kicks.<br>  Confessing to the endless sin --<br>  The endless whining sounds.<br>  Youll be praying till next thursday to<br>  All the gods that you can count.<br>  <br>  -Jethro Tull|`|AA11297267	No, dear.<br>  We don't have any belief in god because there's no evidence of any kind to even suggest that there's any such thing.<br>  That goes for the devil, too.

Most people don't choose their beliefs based on what they feel most comfortable with, its really what they believe to be true.  We live in a rational society based on science and pragmatism, so the fact that many people do not believe in God is not so shocking.  Anyone who chooses to be an atheist due to fear of the devil is in denial, because you cannot fear the devil without believing in it.|`|nhGIZE71aa	The Christian god seems scarier to me than the devil.

Believing in satan is believing in a second god, albeit an evil one.  The christian god would be most unhappy with those pretend christians that also profess to believe in satan.  How can you believe in a god that is all powerful and omniscient yet at the same time fear some fake god satan.  And worse, not see the incongruity of this belief.<br>  <br>  I don't believe that there is any god even remotely like the god of christianity.  I sure as heck do not believe in a second, weaker god called satatn (oh, ya, call him a fallen angel but he is supernatural and that is god to me).<br>  <br>  The whole thing is pretty childish.|`|WqVawp0Kaa	No.|`|vbjgMBdVaa	Atheists don't believe in either.

I do not belive in god or the devil. I belive that you make ur own decisions in life. If you mess up in life there is no one to blame. i'm not going to blame the devil for me breaking a limb and i'm not going to thank god for me getting a raise because both things are factors in my life that I control. I am not afraid of the devil nor am  I afraid of God. I need to base my life on real things. If you belive in god on just faith and you can't ever see him and never know he's there, then you could say you belive in the spagetti monster ( in a south park episode) because you don't know if a spagetti monster is real, you never saw him you have no proof that he is real so it must be right. Just like god. I need proof and don't say the Bible because it was written centuries later.<br>  <br>  so that's my opnion on your question.|`|bGsXsDhBaa	I honestly can't believe any intelligent adult would believe in the existence of a devil<br>  <br>  lmao<br>  <br>  It's hysterical|`|MF9YknDYaa	No,there is no evidence for any god.do you think ALL gods are real?No?,why not?|`|DeF8Ir5naa	What a dumb question.

I think it is because that it would be easier to be clean than to do what God expects which is be thou holy for I am holy. This would seem to be a lot more difficult than being tidy.<br>  <br>  To believe that God exists would mean that one has to believe the whole truth and not bits and pieces. In order to believe it all one's life would have to change and that's whene there is the problem.<br>  <br>  I had this same issue once upon a time. There was this well known girl at my school (oh soooo many years ago) and she dressed better than anyone there because of the wealth of her parents and what the girl was doing on the side. Well, when she accepted the Lord as her personal savior she came to school and the rest of the class just stared at her because she gave up all of her wordly possessions. She was happier than I have ever seen her come to think of it now but back then when wordly possessions meant something to me too, I wasn't having anything to do with her Lord and Savior. Infact when I went to visit a church and saw that she attended there too I had already made up my mind when they were going to ask me. My answer to them was, "I like me the way I am." They including her looked so sad for me. I didn't care I was not going to go from rags to being raggedier.<br>  <br>  Since then I have realized those clothes and things had her and that's why she had to relinguish them for awhile. Her issue was not mine and it took some time for me to get that. It will more than likely take the same kind of time for others to realize that they aren't losing anything in receiving Jesus as their Lord and Savior but gaining so much more.|`|ZXGRJuI9aa	oh yes yes *sniff sniff* you got me...i'm affraid i will spend eternity in a made up place being whipped and tortured a by a big ugly red monster with horns, goat legs and a pitch fork AHHHH *cries uncontrollably*|`|vyXvOaUvaa	You are a perfect candidate to become an archaeologist.We could use this perfectly balanced question.

According to the Bible writers as soon as God created Heaven with all the angels 1/3 of them were not one bit impressed with “God’s beauty and holiness.” They rebelled against him on the SPOT and became demons along with Lucifer* (*Light Bearer who became know as Satan, The Devil, The Old Serpent, The Son of the Morning Star, and so on) who was the most beautiful angel ever created! IMHO this is a major glitch in God’s Creation story that Christians refuse to discuss! God was very busy creating the rest of the Universe and Hell to do anything about this rebellion right away during the "Creation Week" so he scheduled to have all the rebellious angels evicted from Heaven and cast down to Earth along with Lucifer during the “Tribulation Period” after the Rapture? Most Preachers follow this primitive Bible script and claim that this event will take place any time soon! NOWHERE in this humongous UNIVERSE of billions if not trillions of stars some much bigger than the Sun there is going to be a single demon stranded anywhere in any other planet, but they will all be here on this microscopic speck of dust that we call Earth before going to Hell to be tormented with “fire and sulfur” for ever and ever along with all sinners and those who never got to hear about “Jesus”! Hallelujah! Praise the LORD! Sweet Jesus! Amen...!? Nowadays, they commute back and forth to Earth…! (Please forgive my Christian hangover...!!! I can't stop “praising the LORD,” yet...)<br>  <br>  Revelation 12:9-10 (KJV) And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which DECEIVETH the whole world he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him. And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ: for THE ACCUSER OF OUR BRETHREN IS CAST DOWN, WHICH ACCUSED THEM BEFORE OUR GOD DAY AND NIGHT<br>  <br>  So up to the end of the World SATAN and all DEMONS are busy DAY AND NIGHT blowing the whistle before God on the misbehaving Christians, especially on cheating Christian spouses and naughty teenagers! God is eagerly collecting information on their input DAY AND NIGHT!!! And he is never bored to do it to this day!!! You can tell that Heaven is run by very low IQ aliens!!! Satan is very much respected in Heaven, too! (Jude 1:9)...<br>  <br>  It is a shame that not even one single “Guardian Angel” wa s available to watch over and protect Eve from committing an UNKNOWN EVIL like eating from the fruit of the KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD AND EVIL. Considering that God Loves humankind so much and Eve was so innocent and ignorant about any evil issue like eating of a forbidden fruit that if left hanging on the tree will eventualy fall on its own and rot! God was very negligent not to provide a "Guardian Angel" like we see in so many cartoons trying to wise up the person undergoing the “Devil's temptation.” The Bible writers claim that this fruit has the potential of sending the bulk of humanity that God loves so much to Hell “prepared for Satan and his angels” (Mat. 25:41). The Bible God let the fate of the whole human race at the hands of an ignorant and FULLY INNOCENT woman! It was a set up! Eve learned that it was evil to eat the forbidden fruit of knowledge ONLY when her “eyes were opened!” It takes an all wise guy or GOD setting up Eve like that so the bulk of humanity ends up in Hell! The Bible writers say that God planned it to be that way “before the foundation of the world” because God's pleasure was to sacrifice his "only begotten Son Jesus Christ" to fix his own screw up!<br>  <br>  1 Peter 1:19-20 (KJV) But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot:  WHO VERILY WAS FOREORDAINED BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD!* (*for “God’s sake” how moron do you need to be to be a Christian?!!! I am sure that the wanking perverts who wrote the Bible never imagined the success that their work was going to have on the bulk of humanity!) <br>  <br>  Later on after the “Creation Week” more angels banded together to quit Heaven in the days of Noah when they noticed that the girls from around here were "BEAUTIFUL" so they had sex and family with them (Gen 6:1-2) – This is a clue in the Bible that the male angels were created with well hung sexual organs, and that sex in Heaven must be either very lousy or the female angels very ugly and prudish so they had to look elsewhere to satisfy their GOD ENDOWED sexual cravings. GOD is not capable to keep all the angels happy in Heaven hardly 1,000 Bible years after the first rebellion...!  So the male angels had to look elsewhere to satisfy their Gopd created sexual cravings… and Christians pretend to be happy for all eternity in Heaven worshipping this same make believe God put together by the Bible writers! The Bible writers even say that without gullibility or rather FAITH it is impossible to please God! (Heb 11:6) They insist that they wrote the Bible “as they were led by God the Holy Ghost”! In fact they claimed that they didn’t know what they were writing until they read what they wrote and were amazed! (2 Pet 1:21)  There ought to be some higher schooling teaching how religions function in real life environment, especially Christianity! I imagine that Islam is easier to explain, but I was not a Muslim! Most Christians hardly read the Bible and stop to think what they are reading! They let their favorite preacher tell them what Christianity is all about like the Muslims expect their mullahs to tell them all about Allah and Mohammed! The classical “When we get to Heaven God will tell us all that we need to know” is what makes Christianity so thriving! As far as learning or finding out where or how we came about to be religious people have it all figured out! I went to Christian College and I honestly read and taught the Bible in my Christian ministry for many years without paying much attention to what I had to discard of the Bible, but I slowly went over the whole Bible again and it got me to the point that I had to shout, “HOLY CRAP!” It is amazing all the human excrement* (*sh*t) that a low IQ Christian, Mormon, JW, Muslim or what have you must believe to go to a place that doesn’t exist outside of the Bible or the Koran!|`|9Ur1VL9Paa	Well, let me put it this way; I do not believe in gods; I view "The Devil" as a type of god; in which I believe doesn't exist.

We have theories, like the Primordial soup you mentioned.  Others state that life was carried here from some distant planet on an asteroid that collided with the Earth many Milena ago.  But, the truth is no one really knows for sure.  We may never know.  But scietists keep trying.  But an important thing to remember is that evolution does not deal with the start of life on Earth, only on how that life evolved.|`|KgYIYXEtaa	That's abiogenesis you're talking about, not evolution, and I've probably been beaten to that point by several other answerers. Still, I'll try to be polite about this.<br>  <br>  The fact remains that modern species arose from much simpler life forms. Probably the first life was below even the bacteria and virus stage, although as nothing that small would leave a fossil we'll never know for sure. To say that before all that happened, there was just one being of immense complexity (God), just doesn't make logical sense.<br>  <br>  Those involved in the research of this have put forward the theory that life may have begun from amino acids that replicated themselves by chemical (not biological) reactions, eventually becoming more complex by replication much as a growing crystal does. Living things cannot come directly from non-living things, but there is a wide grey area in between 'living' and 'non-living'. Even today, some argue whether viruses are alive or not. How complex would these reactions have to become before they would fall under the definition of 'life'? You cannot compare such a thing to the spontaneous appearance of a wriggly maggot.|`|MV6pc1omaa	"I am told".<br>  <br>  Evolution deals with the history of living organisms.<br>  <br>  Abiogenesis is a different area of biology and there is no hypothesis among many that has been accepted.

Evolution doesn't have anything to do with either.|`|XuO2rTteaa	Spontaneous generation is the arisle of complex life out of nothing, this is not what biochemistry says about the beginning of life, nor does it have to do with evolution.<br>  The main theory for the formation of life is called Abiogenisis. Here is a short explanation of it. Life is filled with replicating compounds (ribonucleic acid, tRNA, mRNA, deoxyribonucleic acid, etc.). A replicating system, such as RNA, is a compound that can reconstruct itself naturally. The DNA molecules are made up of four different types of, what are known as, nucleotide bases (adenine, guanine, thymine, and cytosine). So the first question is, where did the first nucleotide bases come from? In 1961 an experiment was conducted by Juan Oro. He took two chemicals that were common on the primordial earth (hydrogen cyanide and ammonia) and left them in an aqueous solution under environmental conditions similar to the primordial earth. Left alone, they naturally formed one of the four nucleotide bases, adenine. Along with adenine, amino acids also naturally formed without interference, and long chains of these amino acids called polypeptides. Because the criteria for the tests mirrored the environment of the primordial earth in which it happened, this is substantial evidence that it did, in fact, occur. It is important to note that for a nucleotide base to be a nucleotide it must have one ribose sugar and one phosphate attaches in order to connect to other nucleotides. We know how the phosphate is attached, but we don’t know how the ribose sugar is attached. Further study is being done to find this out. Long before the discussion of life occurring from natural origins, it was accepted by most scientists that the earth was several billion years in age. Some of the chemicals that existed during that time also were known. In 1952 it was discovered that compounds such as serum lipids were absorbed from the surrounding area by a substance extremely common to the early earth called montmorillonite [(Na, Ca) (Al, Mg) 6 (Si4O10) 3 (OH) 6], making it an more formidable substance in a chemical rich environment. In the 1980s, the compound was found to be a breeding ground for all sorts of complex organic compounds when reacted to water. This allows several different chemical reactions to occurred under different circumstances. Montmorillonite is a perfect catalyst for turning the nucleotides into long polymer chains called Polynucleotide. Some of these Polynucleotides could replicate themselves; this is how the first RNA compound formed. No replicating system ever replicates itself perfectly, and errors creped in. Some errors were bad for the compound, the ones with this mutation would likely break apart. Some had no effect at all; the compounds that this occurred in would continue replicating happily with no difference. Some also made beneficial errors; this could have been a faster replication, a tendency to take a certain shape, among many others. With beneficial traits the new, better RNA compounds would be better suited for further replication, and the traits would carry on through replication. Illustrated in modern cells, they are covered in a membrane of lipid compounds. Lipids, quite happily, form on their own in montmorillonite, as mentioned before. Lipids have always been a fascination for chemists. In nature, when lipids clump together they form hollow, spherical structures called Micelles (pronounced “My Cell”). Any DNA compound that could attract lipids (as in modern cells) would find themselves instantly protected in a micelle membrane. This would allow the DNA to replicate freely without interaction with the outside environment. Lipids that form empty micelles typically had small holes in them, allowing for matter to freely enter the membrane if small enough. The DNA would use these small partials to replicate themselves. There you have the first protocells. Eventually, an RNA compound mutated to the point in which a double strand formed, allowing for more stored information and further stability, this is when the first DNA compounds formed. DNA, unlike RNA, requires protein compounds to replicate. These proteins are made of amino acids, and as stated before, amino acids formed naturally during the formation of the first nucleotide bases. With more information, DNA can be better adapted for certain tasks. These protocells were little more than small DNA producing factories covered in a thin, stretchy wall of lipids. They looked like small blobs of matter that grew. They were far from modern day cells, and for good reason. The protocells also reproduce far differently than modern ones. As mentioned before they grow. The lipid membrane that they’re covered in can only expand to a certain size, even if new lipids are accumulated. After it gets too big to contain itself the membrane begins to rupture. The protocell is divided and a line starts to form in the middle of it, effectively splitting it in half. Then the lipids pull apart, creating two new smaller protocells out of one. The lipids still naturally form a micelle, so the spot where the split occurred is instantly repaired. Mutation still happened strictly within an individual protocell, but this splitting allowed for more opportunity. Over the next billion years the protocells developed into cells, then into bacteria, slowly getting more and more complex as the population retained itself. This is when abiogenisis ends and evolution begins to take total control of the destiny of life on earth. The protocells are believed to be the first life to form on earth. All that was needed was a little chemistry, and a lot of time. The process happened over about 1 billion years, and it all has been proven time and time again to happen naturally, no need for god or gods, no need for divine intervention, no need for anything other than the earth itself. We are far from a complete answer, but research is being done.We haven't triggered the formation of life completely by natural processes, though, the Celera Corporation is working to change this.|`|f79a4e31211ec881cdd7df7de85a9262aa	i direct you to this graphic.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://darwiniana.org/whatevolutionis.gif" rel="nofollow">http://darwiniana.org/whatevolutionis.gi...</a><br>  <br>  spontaneous generation was the notion that modern life (like mice and flies) could spontaneously emerge from rotting meat or flour that was left out.  abiogenesis does not propose this.<br>  <br>  Evolution has nothing to do with the initial formation of life on this planet and is not dependent on abiogenesis to occur.  evolution deals with the development of life on this planet, how that life got here is irrelevant to the development once it was here.<br>  <br>  if that is what you were taught about evolution then you were taught wrong.

Pasteur wrote little on the subject of evolution or creation. He was apparently skeptical of the popularity of Darwin's theory, but he accepted evolution. Along with most French scientists of his time, he probably did not accept natural selection as its cause. Cuny (1965, 122) quotes him:<br>  <br>  Virulence appears in a new light which cannot but be alarming to humanity; unless nature, in her evolution down the ages (an evolution which, as we now know, has been going on for millions, nay, hundreds of millions of years), has finally exhausted all the possibilities of producing virulent or contagious diseases -- which does not seem very likely.<br>  <br>  2.  The spontaneous generation that Pasteur and others disproved was the idea that life forms such as mice, maggots, and bacteria can appear fully formed. They disproved a form of creationism. There is no law of biogenesis saying that very primitive life cannot form from increasingly complex molecules.|`|rM6gBb2baa	And I always thought that Pasteur used swan neck flasks and boiled broth to disprove the idea of spontaneous generation (he was actually pretty lucky that he didn't have some bacillus spores in the broth).  I also thought that's where Pasteurization came from.  I guess I was wrong, all he did was cover some meat.  That was apparently enough to overturn the idea of spontaneous generation.<br>  <br>  You didn't even bother to look into Pasteur's actual experiment or the definition of spontaneous generation and the difference between it and abiogenesis.  Your opinion is essentially worthless because you're obviously either 12 years old or to lazy to read.
X9txA1GVaa	You can't just believe Jesus is your Lord. He has to actually BE your Lord. James says "Oh you believe there is a god? Good! Even the demons believe that- and shutter." So basically, "believing" in God isn't what He wants. You've got to give your life to Him. As far as the sin thing goes though, God forgives all sins. However, if you continue in a sin and don't care, it's a pretty good sign God isn't your Lord. You can't just say you believe or say God is Lord and then do your own thing.
9p2wQ21Aaa	This is a universe. Of that we feel very sure. Is there then any universal principle? Is there anything which space and matter and time have in common, beside the fact that they are in the same universe? We need not speak now of their relationship to each other. That is a profound and subtle question. We are asking rather the simpler question, Is there anything which these three,—space, matter and time,—have in common? Is there anything like a universal structure in all three?<br>  <br>  To this there is an immediate answer. There is one thing which these basic realities have in common. It suggests itself at once. It is, that each one of these elemental things of the physical universe is threefold.<br>  <br>  It is length, breadth and height, in one Space.<br>  <br>  It is energy, motion and phenomena, in one Substance.<br>  <br>  It is past, present and future, in one Time. That is truly a vast coincidence.<br>  <br>  As a space universe, as a substance universe, and as a time universe, it is in each case three things in one. This is at once the most obvious and the most striking thing about this structure of space, of matter and of time. Different as these three elements are, they have this in common. Each is three things in one. The riddle of the universe now takes this form:—Why is the physical universe, in each of its basic elements, three things in one?<br>  <br>  Where is the answer? How far in the universe does this vast coincidence extend? Does it include man, who is so much a vital part of the universe? Does it include God, who is the ground of the universe? Does it reach as deep and as high as that? Is the answer to the riddle of the threefold universe to be found in God?<br>  <br>  We make no apology for speaking of God. A universe without God is meaningless now. For the day of the blind soul in a black universe has gone by. The stars and the atoms have taught us to see. The deepest instinct of one who lives in the modern universe reasons irresistibly. "The fool," it may be, has always "said in his heart 'There is no God.'" But the modern universe leaves scant footing for such a dance of the morons. Even when the mind does not analyze, the heart reasons, and that is the deepest reasoning.<br>  <br>  We gain, too, when we do not overstate that reasoning.

Good luck, dear.<br>  Auntie Kookoo|`|157c840c4459e57440637f3fe001106caa	I think you should not hesitate in asking him out if you want to go out with him.<br>  What is the problem in doing that?
FqsEliv9aa	Hell no. It means that you take pride in knowing what is happening around you. Knowledge is the key to hammering down fear. Not completely obliterating it but supressing it enough to not really notice it.|`|uWZw4ZK6aa	Basically, yes.
ivH8tRtsaa	If you believe in Santa Claus and the tooth fairy, then maybe you should believe in ghosts too. No they are not real. If someone could show me one, I would give them a million dollars. I'm sure I will be hanging on to my money. There's always a physical explanation even if we can't figure out what it is. There are many things to be scared of in this world, but ghosts aren't one of them. Pure fairytale. Sleep sound. Don't worry.|`|qJXSTtTfaa	Dude, there real.  I was just talking to my sister and mom about our ghost experience in our victorian house. My mom thought there was a party going on and when she started yelling for her sister everything stopped. I was tugged on my Pj's and now putting the pieces together it's that little girl that my brother see's every time he runs up the stairs (he no longer see's her anymore because he's probably older) Just today my next door neighbor saw a women wandering outside that fit the same exact descriptions of other sightings people saw. Eveytime I'm around 3:00 weird **** start to happen.  We hear footsteps constantly....I could go on and on.  <br>  <br>  But I'm still waiting on seeing one of these spirits, I find it not fair that other people get to see them and I don't. haha.

Just because you find yourself interested in guys/girls now doesn't mean you will be interested in just guys or just girls in future.<br>  <br>  And everyone knows everything depends on the person you end up falling in love with for sure ;p but that's probably a long way down the line if you're still pretty young.<br>  <br>  Your friend's statement was actually really insightful so think of it more like a gift, let yourself think that stage you're in is more exciting than stressful ^^<br>  <br>  Lots of luck.|`|sTbUR32haa	I think I know how you feel.. I mean I know i was bi when i was like 8 years or younger, but i never really know what bi meant; i was just attracted to both girls and boys. But now, especially this year, it feels like my meter is swinging over to the girls and i guess my attraction to boys are fading. it's still there, but it's really fading. I never met someone bi or lesbian before too. I mean, at least i dont know if they are les or bi. This i why i go to Y!A and to this section. It feels like home lol.

The days pass and I think the sweet world of lesbianism is calling my humble name. Goodbye lives of bisexuality, goodbye lands of heterosexuality.<br>  I welcome it with open arms, I actually see myself settling down with a girl when I grow up.<br>  Don't let it bug you.

Doing bad things does not get you into hell, we all do bad things. What gets you into hell is that you refuse to accept Christ as payment for the sins that you have commented. Did you realize that God is the one the created hell, as eternal separation from Him.  Eventually Satan will be sent to the lake of fire to burn as well.  Satan knows his future, so he is trying to do anything to keep people from coming to know Jesus, so they can join him, in the place of eternal destruction.

The final death after the judgement of mankind.<br>  <br>  John 5:26-29<br>  Do not marvel at this, because the hour is coming in which all those in the memorial tombs will hear his voice and come out, those who did good things to a resurrection of life, those who practiced vile things to a resurrection of judgment.<br>  <br>  Nobody is judged until Judgement Day arrives.<br>  <br>  In hell you are just dead.<br>  Ecclesiastes 9:5<br>  5?For the living are conscious that they will die; but as for the dead, they are conscious of nothing at all, neither do they anymore have wages, because the remembrance of them has been forgotten.<br>  <br>  Jesus himself was in hell for 3 days.

sfCRwcRCaa	No.<br>  Martyring yourself means that you are ending your life to fulfill a greater good than yourself. A just, loving, and reasonable god would see such an act of selflessness and sacrifice as quite noble, and likely look kindly upon it.<br>  Suicide means ending your life for selfish reasons, which I guess would be like slapping God in the face. God would probably not take kindly to someone throwing away the ultimate gift; the gift of life.<br>  Of course, that's just my personal take on it.|`|8ubAwaGCaa	If a martyr makes such a pain in the butt of himself hoping for an easy path to heaven (as some early "Christians" did), then you might have a point.  Otherwise, most of them didn't really intend to become martyrs.  It just sort of happened.|`|x3RAaLfNaa	No, they are not considered the same because martyrdom is considered dying because you are defending your religion like Jesus did. Suicide it dying becaus you can't deal with life anymore so yo kill yourself.|`|HbCWNCQzaa	i don't think so.....JESUS did it for us|`|rHqe7oMoaa	With regards to Islam, dying during Jihad gains you instant entrance into Jannat (paradise) whilst suicide is haraam (illegal) and gets you hellfire.<br>  <br>  So it seems that suicide, with the express and selfish purpose of ending your life, in Islam, is not allowed, but Jihad, where you may end up dying, is done for the cause of Allah (to spread Islam, fight the infidel etc...) and is allowed.<br>  <br>  <br>  So it depends on your motivations as to whether or not suicide is halal (legal) or haraam (illegal).|`|D9lMg7A2aa	Not true at all. Have you ever read one account of a martyr's death. It is the opposite of what you say !! They willingly die for the sake of God, and God alone. And Jesus warned not to court death (when they come flee to another town) nor to avoid it by denial of your faith. In the early Church they taught that if anyone thrust himself into martyrdom God would withdraw His help. Pride is the very last reason, or self-will. <br>  <br>  You are just wrong.|`|NWnOTkwCaa	I think if a soldier in combat falls on a grenade to save four friends that is significantly different from some emo kid slicing his/her wrists because the world isn't the rose garden they'd like it to be.

First, just because a few Catholic priests get accused of whatever, you assume that ALL are the same way. Second, you assume that just because he is a priest, he is a CATHOLIC priest, even though he doesn't live in a rectory (which is on the grounds of the church at which he is the priest). Third, you've obviously made NO attempt at getting to know the guy. <br>  <br>  If he is one of the rare Catholic priests who lives in a home of their own instead of in a rectory because of the teeny tiny size of the parish and no other parish rectory nearby or some other equally valid reason (if he's a bishop or cardinal, he'll be in a house of his own, most likely), then you need to get to know him even more, because your average Catholic priest is always willing to talk to anyone who wants or needs to do so, or just to listen, or anything else that's needed that is within their abilities.|`|wxBFZ41Taa	Are you in danger of what?

Can you work on your parents? Teens beg their parents to take them to concerts and other places, I can't believe your parents won't take you to church? I impressed with your desire to learn about God. The reason we go to church is to take Holy Communion and to praise God. Some will say you don't need to go to church that you will be saved without it, which is true but we need to continue to grow in knowledge and faith. Pray about your desire to go to church. Pray to God that your parents come to faith as well.

It's a shame your parents do not go to Church, or live the Catholic faith. Parents are the first and most important teachers of faith to their children. Even though you were not catechized properly, this does not mean you cannot find out all you need to know. <br>  <br>  I'm a convert to Catholicism, and only wish I had come to know and understand the Catholic faith sooner.

You can be moral without attending these weekly rituals. There's also the line, "I'm spiritual but not religious" which should show your friends you believe in God but not the politics.<br>  <br>  It sounds like you really wish to know more of your faith than wanting to sit on a wooden pew every Sunday. Maybe you should research some local youth groups to get acquainted with Catholicism, to see if you truly believe church dogma or have a different understanding of God.|`|45UTKuamaa	I went to church for a long time but i think it taught me that there are a lot of people go to church just to prove something to others. and not so much for the religious aspect. I have a firm belief in God but not much use for organized religion|`|FOzN3xwzaa	Going to a building won't save you.  <br>  <br>  And catholicism cannot save a single person, because catholicism teaches a false gospel (Galatians 1:6-9). <br>  <br>  Only you believing in Jesus alone for salvation, is what saves you  :) <br>  <br>  You can be saved right now. <br>  <br>  Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation (John 6:39-40, 1 John 5:13). <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what! <br>  <br>  Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|OBid7Ozsaa	Yes it is bad. Church attendance is essential. Very important.|`|JXMpZiwxaa	You can always go to church with a friend, or walk if possible.  Catholics have Masses on Saturday afternoon or evening, as well as Sunday morning.  There is also daily Mass.  If you've been baptized Catholic but never made your first communion or been confirmed, you  may wish to call a local Catholic Church about enrolling in their RCIA program.  You will learn about your religion and can eventually receive sacraments.<br>  <br>  You can also pray the rosary often.<br>  <br>  The rosary is explained here:<br>  <a href="http://www.ewtn.com/Devotionals/prayers/rosary/how_to.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ewtn.com/Devotionals/prayers/...</a><br>  <br>  The fifteen promises of Mary to Christians who recite the rosary:<br>  1. Whoever shall faithfully serve me by the recitation of the Rosary shall receive signal graces.<br>  2. I promise my special protection and the greatest graces to all those who shall recite the Rosary.<br>  3. The Rosary shall be a powerful armor against Hell, it will destroy vice, decrease sin, and defeat heresies.<br>  4. It will cause virtue and good works to flourish; it will obtain for souls the abundant mercy of God; it will withdraw the hearts of men from the love of the world and its vanities and will lift them to the desire of eternal things. Oh, that souls would sanctify themselves by this means.<br>  5. The soul which recommends itself to me by the recitation of the Rosary, shall not perish.<br>  6. Whoever shall recite the Rosary devoutly, applying himself to the consideration of its sacred mysteries, shall never be conquered by misfortune. God will not chastise him in His justice, he shall not perish by an unprovided death; if he be just, he shall remain in the grace of God and become worthy of eternal life.<br>  7. Whoever shall have a true devotion for the Rosary shall not die without the Sacraments of the Church.<br>  8. Those who are faithful to recite the Rosary shall have during their life and at their death the light of God and the plenitude of His graces; at the moment of death, they shall participate in the merits of the saints in Paradise.<br>  9. I shall deliver from Purgatory those who have been devoted to the Rosary.<br>  10. The faithful children of the Rosary shall merit a high degree of glory in Heaven.<br>  11. You shall obtain all you ask of me by the recitation of the Rosary.<br>  12. All those who propagate the Holy Rosary shall be aided by me in their necessities.<br>  13. I have obtained from my Divine Son that all the advocates of the Rosary shall have for intercessors the entire Celestial Court during their life and at the hour of death.<br>  14. All who recite the Rosary are my sons, and brothers of my only Son, Jesus Christ.<br>  15. Devotion to my Rosary is a great sign of predestination.<br>  <br>  God bless!<br>  Dave|`|ptIIkqq0aa	First off, please do not listen to people like Chris/CJ/Jesus is Lord<br>  <br>  <br>  You're not 'bad' because you don't go to Church. I don't believe it solely makes you heaven bound if you do go, either. Building your own relationship with Christ is what is important. Church is the form of Worship. Not going to church doesn't make you a non-believer, either.<br>  Being a Catholic too, I find it so disappointing when people find church boring or just go because they have to. I was once in the exact same place as you.  I guess you can say that I had this 'epiphany' find out more about Catholicism, and it has changed my life. I enjoy going to Church every Sunday.<br>  Anyways, I'm glad that you are taking a step into finding out about your faith. First off, it would help to know if you have been Baptized, received the Eucharist, or been Confirmed-which doesn't seem to be the case. To start learning about Catholicism, you can sign up for a religious education class or an RCIA (Rite of Christian Initiation for Adults) which is a great way to learn about Catholicism, and eventually be Baptized, receive Communion, etc. Reading the Bible and the Catechism of the Catholic Faith also will help guide you. Don't be afraid to ask trusted Catholics your questions either. I would recommend that you find the nearest possible Catholic Parish, and if you cannot in any way get any rides from your parents, see if there is anyone else you know (friends, maybe?) who can take you. <br>  But most importantly, have faith and pray to God for guidance. Welcome Home!<br>  <br>  Please, feel free to e-mail me if you have any questions, and let me know how things are going.<br>  <br>  You are in my prayers ?<br>  <br>  Sorry for such a long response!|`|LfLJtSTxaa	I, too, was baptized a Catholic and the only church services I've ever attended were a few Easter Sunday masses to please my grandmother, at an age when I was far too young to appreciate what was going on. So no. It's not bad. You do not have to attend a church service in order to lead a moral life. As for your problem, why does it matter if they think you're a non-believer? What are they going to do about it? They can't force you to believe. It's physically impossible.<br>  <br>  If you spend all your time worrying about the next life, you won't have time to enjoy this one. Where you go after you die is between you and God - or whatever deity, or lack thereof, that you choose to believe in.|`|ivZK3MK9aa	first of all you have to find your higher power.. or creator as you may know him or her.. in other words god... then you pray for guidance. maybe your parents are R.C. doesn't you you have to be. my parents where R.C. but I'm a Spiritual believer not of religion.

I like this question. I can actually answer it and speak from experience. <br>  <br>  Its okay not to know everything about religion and not everyone goes to church. I'm a christian and I have been for year and a half. I was raised in a christian home and was always taught that if I didn't attend church I wasn't a real christian. This turned me against Christianity. I'm 26 now and I've only really knew what it meant to be a christian just after I turned 25. <br>  <br>  God has a very strange way of molding our life. I was a believer my whole life but I was so overwhelmed with details about God and what I needed to do that I just didn't bother to learn. <br>  <br>  The very best thing you can do is just talk to God and believe that when you make mistakes Jesus is there to forgive you and help you along. That's all...it's that easy. Whatever God wants you to know, you'll know. I've learned so many things about God since I've been a 'real' christian and being a member of the church is not what makes someone a christian. You can stay at home and worship God. Personally, I don't like church...not because it's a place of worship or that it's boring...but because peoples attitudes drive me nuts. If you walk in with tattoos and piercings...you don't belong there. God doesn't see your outside, he sees your inside and if you desire to know him and feel bad that you don't he's waiting for you to talk to him and help you out. <br>  <br>  I've been there so many times and back. Never believe anyone who tells you that you're not a christian because you don't go to church or whatever. If you trust in Jesus he will teach you everything you need to know. I'm a much better person now :)<br>  <br>  All the best to you and if you have any other questions at all, send me an email. I'll gladly help out :)<br>  <br>  Research Brian Welsh from Korn. He has an AMAZING story to hear.

PzSI7EPEaa	Hinduism did not come about in a competitive political environment like Christianity and Islam. It does not have a concept of punishment for Apostacy. In a way it is more spiritual because it is not a political ideology but human's true contemplation about the idea of God and what or who is the creator and various ideas and philosophies are put forth by different people. Gradually over time Vedas came to be known as the most holy books in Hinduism. It does not say this is God and this is what you must do or you go to hell. Hinduism never had a my way or the highway kind of approach. Infact they did not even have a word for their set of beliefs as such. The only thing codified is duties in society or karma. Infact in many Historical records when "Hindus" came across other people they often wondered what Karma should they perform in society. They did not worry about their religious beliefs. Their was no concept of Us Vs. them. There were lots of Invasions into India and most early invasions in due time adopted the ways of India. Wars between Hindu Rajas were always fought to extend their boundaries and this happened regularly back and forth as it was the duty of the Kshatriya. A religious identity was only understood when they faced the Islamic Enemy. Until then wars had never been fought for a religion in India. Hindus espoused very secular values and their are various advices to be found in even in the "Artha Shastra" where the Brahmin Adviser Chanakya the Prime minister of Emperor Chandragupta advises the king to walk a secular path in administering justice and to not favour one "Panth"(The word closest to religion) over the other and to rule with "Dharma"(The word actually means righteousness).Today religion is called Dharma but that is not the word for it. Hinduism is a set of values, a way of life distinctly Indian. It is ever evolving with some basic values. That is why it is called Sanatan or Eternal. It does not contain religious Dogma or a sense of the other. It has always said, Truth is one, various people call it by many names. So the Hindu would worship with equal spirituality at a Sikh shrine, a Sufi Dargah or a Church. To the Hindu he is still praying to God. He does not see the need to convert. One can appreciate the good values and philosophy in all religions without being identified as a man of one religion who is opposed to the other.<br>  Jews, Parsis, Bahai's and various other minorities found a home in India when they were being oppressed elsewhere. Some have lived in India for over 2500 years. In India in some places you will find adjacent houses, one with a Star of David outside the house and another with a Swastika.|`|56f857adccfe97c5b5197529fd3759b6aa	Why should an Atheist (if your lable shows what you are) worry about a Believer..! Or are you the proxy question shooter for other Faiths looking at this religion as a challenge to theirs?!<br>  <br>  The vedas don't just talk of the nameless and the formless - the Nirguna Brahman - from which embodied forms (Saguna forms with name and various divine attributes) did emerge.. that is why there are songs for various Deities like Narayana, Rudra, Durga ...etc (the sukthaas)..<br>  <br>  There were many great saints who did favour the formless, like for example, the Arul Prakasar Ramalinga Vallalar (of Vadalur, Tamilnadu) who lamented that people did not buy his ideas.. and realized that for the lower levels of seekers the attention on a formless one was difficult and started singing praise of the various deities like Siva and Shanmuga..!<br>  <br>  So every concept has its merits and application for special contexts.. for advanced seeker, the one with form is not necessary.. like Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa but still he worshipped the Durga as well for the sake of keeping the lay people bound to a divine force..<br>  <br>  Why do you worry about all these.. Any amount of my clarification is not going to help you.. nor the people who are worshipping the Deities in the forms of their choices going to give up the practice to satisfy you..!<br>  <br>  A famous Tamil song reads, "with and without form, as whatever exists and those not in existence (at a time), as bud and the flower, gems and (diverse forms of) lights, as the embryo and the life, as hope and destiny.. as the Guide do Thou come and bless oh, Guha (Shanmuga)!"<br>  <br>  The HIndus worship the forms of Deities that appeared at various times as well as the symbols like the Lingam (an elliptical stone mounted on a pedestal - representing endlessness of creative cycle as a symbolism) and the Saligram (a seed from a tree) as well.. They not only see the Creator in the statues but in the rivers, trees birds and animals.. that is, the beautiful nature that serves us.. for it sustains us like the cosmic Divine mother .. <br>  <br>  The philosophies of Godhood discussed in the hindu scriptures send the true seekers into raptures.. for their depth of wisdom and Truth.. verily it has the essence of all known religions of the world. That is why the enlightened followers of the religion never decry any other religion..<br>  <br>  God bless.|`|5b6e62fbefdc1d5cc61a98468c918dd5aa	A formless God can not talk or hear or see .the existence of a formless being with potentials higher than the humans is unscientific and illogical as an atheist should know.<br>  A simple truth that any one , particularly an atheist , should know is that sound can never be produced without matter -some substance.Sound can never be produced or transmitted in vacuum.So if  the God could talk to some one , He should have had some lungs and  some lips and tongue within a set of teeth  to modulate his sound and should be using air to produce sound and transmit it ..So that God should necessarily have been and be made of some substance  Anything made of some substance should necessarily have some shape described by its circmscription. <br>                         So, that God can not be anything without substance or shape .Such a God should be breathing and shoud be living with the heip of air .That is why the Hindus worship vayu Bhagavan also (Vayu) Without this no life exists even for a few seconds .The God who talked to Moses and Mohamed shoud be Having all organs necessary to produce sound and be breathing as He had blown into the nostrils of the man He created ( Vide ;Genesis ). And that God should have lived with the help fo air and would have died but for the air He was breathing in. .Certainly God who has created a scientific world and a logical being like the humans ,is not an illogical and unscientific being .<br>  The energy centers you speak of are  located in the human bodies .You agree with that .Human bodies have shapes .the nergy centers are not made of human bodies .The human bodies themselves are made of and sustained by the enegies that are located in the human bodies .the battery cells that work some gadgets are not made of the gadgets .It is the power in the batteries that work the gadgets!

I quote again the first few verses of Chapter 12, from a translation done by the same person of the BG. Instead of Arjuna and Krishna, feel free to replace with words "Human" and "God"<br>  <br>  Arjuna:<br>  1 Krishna! Who is more perfected in yoga? Those who earnestly worship you ever as personal God with form and attributes or those who worship you as the imperishable, impersonal, and formless God.<br>  Krishna:<br>  2-5 Those who constantly worship me as the personal God with form and attributes, more readily attain<br>  perfection. On the other hand, greater is the anguish for those who contemplate on the formless. Nevertheless,<br>  those who worship the formless, the imperishable, the all-pervading, the indefinable, the inconceivable, the<br>  changeless, the immovable, and the constant, with all their senses restrained, even-minded in all situations, and<br>  rejoicing in the welfare of all beings; they also reach Me! However, only through much pain, the embodied<br>  beings succeed in the path to the formless God.<br>  6,7 But know Arjuna that I speedily liberate from the deadly ocean of worldly life those who worship me, giving<br>  up all their actions unto me, regarding me as the supreme goal, and meditating on me with single-minded yoga.|`|EDB3Q0Yyaa	Many do....It is just a stereotype that ALL Hindus worship idols....Look at the Arya Samaj sect of Hinduism  - they are totally against idol worship of any kind.|`|dec96041a9328ba9706ab620e51d3697aa	I do agree with you, friend.<br>  Your question is <br>  Why an average Hindu does not consider the formless, .....?<br>  Let me answer it in one word,<br>  IGNORANCE|`|wnWOx2S8aa	WHY ARE YOU BOTHERED ABOUT PRACTICES OF WORSHIP OF OTHER PEOPLE?

My God is a merciful God and would not visit that on any human being.|`|b3h0ovgRaa	Every woman who ever met me was jealous. I was a dark eyed beauty with a figure to die for. Not only that, I had beautiful skin and amazing hair! I was also very intelligent and men hungered after me. I did my best to deal with all this envy and held my head up high. It was not my fault I was born beautiful. And smart. And got all the men's attention. And got the best jobs. I do hate to brag but you did ask.   Poppy|`|vOYyFqxRaa	This will be hard to explain and not sound conceded but I do know someone who has said to me that they are jealous of me. The truth is they are jealous of what they presume my life to be not the reality. I hate it this because I genuinely care for this person but feel terribly uncomfortable around them. They seem to invent reasons to create strife with me and it has affected my hubby. Sadly this is his sister. I would like nothing better than to have her as a friend and she refuses for reasons unknown. The issues are hers not mine though. I am a patient person and perhaps someday she will decide otherwise. I will wait for that day.|`|xL6zc0bOaa	I know someone who is jealous of anyone who has a house, a car, children, and grand-children a<br>  lovely husband. <br>  <br>  Especially if they have plenty of money, and don't owe a penny to anyone, and have a few bob, that drives some people mad. <br>  <br>  I also know a woman, who tells you she had a good education, and a good job, was stupid with her money, and is now living from hand to mouth.<br>  <br>  So it does not pay to put on airs and graces, as only God, knows where you will end up in this world, many are well educated and hated at the same time.|`|ozwLZwXeaa	Actually many people have told me that very thing.  The reason given for the jealousy was the close connection I have and have always had with my 6 children. After my husband,(their father) left us, the kids and I worked as a team to keep the house warm, clean and everyone fed. They learned from me and respected me for the hard work I did to keep our family together for so many years up until they married or found their own homes. Still today that unique and wonderful closeness is with us and always will be.  All it took was love and I respected my children too.|`|G4vFjh0yaa	Have to go with Paul on this one.

L76NCybXaa	I know just where you are coming from. I felt the same way, kinda except I didn't think I could "do better", but I felt smothered.<br>  I made the mistake of acting on it  just once. (there were extenuating circumstances that I cannot divulge . Anyone might have done the same in my position...believe me!)<br>  I told my BF after it happened. I broke his heart. It killed me that I hurt him so. Nothing is worth that. I was lucky enough to have such a great guy that he gave me another chance.

I also agree with one of the other people who answered your question - it's your ego, and that you must be bored a little. Try doing something fun with him; go traveling, go on dates, see a movie, take walks so you'll learn more about each other.<br>  <br>  What still bugs me is why do you want to cheat ?! I'm sure you have a loyal boyfriend who wants YOU to be loyal to HIM, and loves you very much.

Sorry if I haven't worded that in the friendliest way, I feel cranky today!|`|MgMsMExPaa	Why do you feel smothered?  If you are so shallow and superficial that you think that you are superior to him then you should be the guy in the sling at the spa . So that you can have everyone .

VLv3Vzjnaa	In a lot of cases you are correct.  My favorite is when some Christians try to justify using God to promote the anti-gay agenda.  They do everything to justify their sin of homophobia and when you tell them that homophobia is a sin like lying, stealing and murder, they call you "intolerant."  They can't stand to hear the truth.  I'm not the one who said, "Treat others as you want to be treated."  Christ is so they should direct their anger at Him when they start feeling guilty from the homophobia in their hearts.|`|uFAoq4idaa	Keep it up. Do write as many books you can write.

This is why they use scripture. <br>  <br>  But the beauty of scripture is that someone can make their own conclusions.  Years ago the populace could not read.  It was because the church did not want you to come to your own conclusions,   Its the same reason why the catholic mass was in latin for so long.

I was just into it with this minister of some sorts who called me evil for some of the knowledge and understanding that God has given to me. <br>  <br>  What I have realized is that a lot of people who think they are of God only pretend to be. The would rather cover it up to look like they are walking in truth instead of actually being in truth..... <br>  <br>  What they don't understand is that there is an evolution in Christianity. They cannot accept the fact that young people desire more than what they put out. What they do is blame you and point the finger at you instead of reaching out.... Most of them ARE conformed to the ways of another man and don't even know it.... <br>  <br>  Remember that it was Satan who pretended to be God when he tested Job. Satan still pretends to be God today. The difference between REAL Christians and those who just want to look like Christians is that REAL Christians are not afraid to be proven wrong while the others run as soon as they see that they are losing ground in a conversation....|`|L1EnPN67aa	Yeah, but there are all types of Christians. All are not taught the same doctrine. You have the same Bible, but aren't Catholic's Christians too? That's up for discussion too. I might post that.<br>  <br>  Anyways, I like the comment about gays. I watched that movie on Lifetime where the boy's mom who was Christian drove her son to self hatred and stuff when he was trying to get help. That issue is so debatable. You can't help what you're turned on by, you're a human being...a sexual being. I think you can choose what you do about it though. <br>  <br>  <br>  There's a lot of unclear things regarding the Bible anyways. I think it's because of the history of the Bible. I went to a Christian college and I learned that the translation of the Bible to English had a lot of issues with that (like adding verses about slaves being loyal to masters and stuff). I think the Bible is best applied when it is put in context. <br>  <br>  But as for excuses...we're human. Something people have to just work on.|`|lTspNQsQaa	I'm sorry to hear you think of christians like that...I understand what you mean though. I'm a Christian myself just to let you know. I don't find everything HAS to be backed up and all that. If I'm wrong...I'll admit it...all you have to do is prove me wrong. <br>  <br>  I know it is a bit off topic but I thought I'll let you think about something. I obviously don't know if you believe in anything so I'm just asking this question so that you can have a think. I find it quite interesting.<br>  <br>  What would be harder?<br>  Proving there is a god, any god! or proving there is no god.<br>  <br>  my theory is that it would be harder to prove there is no god because then you have to go through everything on the whole planet/whatever to prove there certainly is NO god. But if you want to prove there IS a god...all you have to do is find one.<br>  <br>  anyway....I understand your point...and I'm open to any discussion..I don't act like the criminal ALL the time...I admit I sometimes do.<br>  I want to thank you also for making that point about the whole example of the criminal because now I will be more careful about what I say when people ask me questions.<br>  so thanks! :)<br>  <br>  have a nice day :)|`|VUfT35UQaa	No, I ask straightforward questions, and get 70% straightforward answers and 30% atheists telling me Christianity is wrong.

I don't want to, but trolls are probably going to push me that way. I'll have some people's email address, the ones that I will keep in touch with. I already have the few that I would stay in touch with if I ever leave, so I guess I'm good. But as long as this account is here, I'll probably stick around till then. It all depends on how much the clone trolls love reporting me. <br>  <br>  I come here because I like to interact with the Users here. Like I said, if we all migrated somewhere else, or if I had the emails of the users here, I probably wouldn't be here.<br>  <br>  Do I plan on it? I'm not sure. I guess whatever happens, happens. I've grown attached to the users, that's why I'm here all the time.|`|TV3rTMKFaa	Why don't you receive Email?<br>  Why do so many not receive Email?<br>  Sometimes I want to respond to someone personally but...<br>  <br>  Will I be doing this in a few years?<br>  If this "down turn" in the economy doesn't continue to spiral downward until there are so many people unemployed that civil unrest becomes a major threat to the safety of the whole country with riots and violence, making it necessary for Obama to call for a police state.

TO4bRflyaa	What are you talking about?|`|d05b366085d8773ec7654e3ad2b991cdaa	It is impossible from the construction of your question to determine exactly what you are asking about?<br>  <br>  Christ did not warn 'US' about 'Jews,' although he did warn his disciples not to become like Pharisees whose extra rules - 'hedges about the Law' - made life more difficult for observers than it is intended to be.  He commanded his followers not to partake of the leaven of the Pharisees, a reference to the corruption that yeast spreads inside dough when it activates and spreads throughout the whole batch.<br>  <br>  That being so, Jesus was warning Christians about letting corruption into their souls, minds, and hearts, because inner corruption, distortions, requiring more than God asks for, etc, swiftly leads to false religion.  <br>  <br>  Jesus is not anti-Semitic, although John's writing does make it seem that way when he refers to 'Jews,' frequently blaming them - Jews - for this or that problem.  <br>  <br>  But it is not a difficult matter to separate in the mind those who were actively against Jesus, and those who were either indifferent or else thought he ought to be left alone to get on with whatever he was doing.<br>  <br>  Neither Jesus or the Beloved Apostle said anything about law-abiding religious Jews that shunned the 'leaven of the Pharisees,' they drew their readers' attention only to the Parush that had adopted a fundamentalist approach to the proto-Judaism of the time, and added frills and fences to what the Law of God required.  <br>  <br>  The Vatican has had little to do with the redaction of the bible over the past two millennia.  If it had, the evidence would be readily available.  That such evidence is not presented in support of your question is proof sufficient to determine that your hostility to the Vatican on this issue is not well founded.|`|AA10641825	Warning about Jews?

As the catholic church has substituted Mary as redemptress instead of Christ our Lord and Saviour. I think they borrowed from the egyptians who also had a goddess named Isis.|`|FjiRPKp2aa	You do seem to be a bit paranoid for a thing that will not happen.You have no understanding of the Catholic faith at all.|`|cfusEJPFaa	Huh?<br>  <br>  Christ words warned us about the Pharisees and the high priests who had co-opted the words of God for their own gain.<br>  <br>  Christ was a jew.  Three of the four writers of the gospels were jews.  All twelve apostles were jews.<br>  <br>  The Jews don't accept the new Testament.  Why should they care?|`|b2bMy1EAaa	Funny that. Jesus was a Jew, his family were Jews, his friends were Jews, the Jews are gods people. John the baptist was Jew ffs and when he 'baptised' Jesus it had nothing to with Christianity! You'd have to wipe most of the Bible out lol. <br>  <br>  Do you know why Jews don't accept Jesus as the savior? He doesn't fulfill the criteria. The scripture has been edited from the original Jewish story so he fits. Without the Vatican the Christian faith would collapse.|`|ccf1380d8076cbe37300f50ef722bbf2aa	Huh? What do you mean?

God disgraced and told him to get out of the heaven he asked for god s permission to let him go till the final day..... and that he will decieve this fabulous creation of his....God said then you and your followers will go to hell... but my people will never follow you.... and so God sent the humans down to test them we have our free will we can deny God and defy God if we want to only cause we cant see Him.... on the day of judgement when people will blame satan/ iblees . iblees will say you are lying... im afraid of God ... all i could do was suggest to you .. you followed cause you wanted to.....    and whats with the kiiling dont you atleast kill plants to eat them??? or you dont think they are living.... we can only kill animals for eating.... not pleasure|`|CxhH2xSQaa	Read Nietzsche's Beyond Good and Evil, he writes on some of the things you are trying to say, and does so way better than you. <br>  <br>  <br>  "But he who is wisest among you is but a discord and hybrid of plant and of ghost."

I don′t know if you know about philosophy or not but if you don't know philosophy you almost arrived at the Catholic philosophic explanation of evil. The Catholic philosophy defines  evil as the "absence of good" so God really did not create the Devil, father of all evil. God create Lucifer and he revolted against God and the consequence of this revolt was that he lost the grace of God, he lost the light of God and became the angel of darkness. The consequence of this is that the Devil want to destroy himself and all the creation of God. The Devil is an angel, created in the eternal life, he cannot destroy himself and god did not created him to be destroyed. <br>      Your analyzes about the destruction being done to this beautiful place that God created for us- mankind- is also almost there to a close and logic conclusion, because we - mankind - became more associated with evil, so more and more the good in us disappear and we become more like darkness. The Catholic Church teaches that only one think in the world is responsible for all sorts of evil on the face of the earth: Sin.|`|5PAP1hpSaa	God is what keeps you from making the wrong decisions and also helps you making the right ones.We all know right from wrong but we need a higher power to guide us in the right direction.Sometimes we listen sometimes we dont.<br>  <br>  So is there a god?<br>  <br>  Yes i believe so and im glad i do.<br>  Sometimes i dont make the right decisions but gods always there to guide me back to the right path<br>  <br>  <a href="http://swagbucks.com/?cmd=sb-register&rb=374732" rel="nofollow">http://swagbucks.com/?cmd=sb-register&rb...</a>|`|DVMZsri0aa	It doesn't make since. but if you are looking for an answer simply god did not create evil man did. yes god created man but this does not make god evil. just as your parents created you it is not there fault you turn out the way you do it is simply a choice. <br>  <br>  to say god loves everyone is also false for he loved Adam and Eve as your parents love you but this does not mean he loves your children.<br>  <br>  PS: Im an atheist|`|chcTruKDaa	Wow, u should stop thinking too much....you'll do damage to your brain function...there are signs off it already.<br>  i take it you believe in the biblical accounts ...?...God & the devel did/do in fact interact...consider the account involving the faithful 'Job' before the devil tested him.<br>  Also, how would you know what is 'good' if there was no bad...you need one to balance the other.....so you can make a choice......remember 'freedom of choice'..?|`|pbyw2EYZaa	God isn't a judge. People are. God loves and thats all god does. Well, aside from creates. Sin is a useful concept but our lives are so much more than a good/bad edict. What happens is every human being is connected to one another. So when you harm another, you harm yourself. God doesn't create karma though, people naturally find balancing situations. Its part of what makes us human. When we die we go through a process in which we experience our lives in a 3 dimensional way. We live through situations from other perspectives, until we truly see and feel how we could have gotten it right. Then we go through a healing... after that I don't really know. At this point do you see what sin really represents? It represents a moral code that attempts to help people do the right thing the first time around, so that we don't have to agonize later. But no book can tell us what sin is. All we can do is be kind to one another and try our best to truly love others.<br>  <br>  Want to know what god is? Go somewhere quiet.

But even in this position, Lucifer was not content. He took inordinate pride in his own angelic nature - he was overly pleased with his supernatural gifts, his immortality, his closeness to God. And eventually, his pride became so great that he was angered at having a master of any kind, even God.<br>  <br>  He wanted to control his own destiny and so he rebelled against God and all of Heaven. He threw up his banner, recruited his army of equally discontented angels and waged war against God for supremacy.<br>  <br>  To lead his own troops, God appointed the archangel Michael as his field commander:<br>  <br>  Thus having fallen from Heaven, Lucifer was no more — he had a new name, Satan (the Hebrew word for “adversary”) and his new domain was Hell.<br>  <br>  The angels who had fallen with him became his Demons.<br>  <br>  Accursed by God and doomed to eternal torment themselves, Satan and his legions found a new vocation in the temptation and corruption of man. With nothing better to occupy their time, they resolved to take out their “great wrath” on those mortals too foolish or sinful to resist their lures and temptations.<br>  <br>  When Lucifer was cast from heaven, EVIL WAS BORN.<br>  <br>  how then heck are you going to compare killing animals to killing humans?

g7bQ9zSvaa	Well, welcome to the family ;-).  It's natural at your age to have crushes on guys - even be infatuated, and we can even talk ourselves into justifying our lust with "he's a christian, so we must be made for each other".  However, you are right to be considering this when you're thinking of a potential partner.  The bible says to "seek first the kingdom of God and then all these things shall be added to you".  First and foremost, your focus should be on God, and if your crush distracts you from that, then you need to submit it to God.  You also need to trust God - you don't have to force anything with this guy.  Pray about it, and leave it in God's hands.  Ask for his very best for you, and trust that He will provide for you.  I know it's sooooo much easier said than done, but sometimes God has someone better for us just round the corner.  It's true that we can pick a suitable partner who we could be happy with etc, but God would choose someone better than us.  Trust me, I've been in your situation at your age, and even though they were good Christian guys, I realise looking back that had I dated them, it would have driven me offcourse for a while, from the wonderful plans God had for me.  <br>  <br>  And don't forget that as Christians, our views on relationships do differ from the more popular worldy view also.  Rather than seeing dating as some sort of pick and taste bar, God wants us to guard our hearts, so that when we meet that perfect person for us, we can give them our hearts unbroken.  We don't date just for a bit of fun, but with the view towards life-long relationships (which is fun too).<br>  <br>  <br>  My advice would be to first and foremost pray, and leave these feelings at God's feet.  We're human, and you're at an age where you're gonna have crushes, but don't let them steer you from God's path (yes, even 'Godly' relationships can become false gods in our lives).  I think you should stay friends with him without trying to make anything happen, possibly discuss it with a more mature Christian at church.  Treat him like the brother that he is to you, and see where things go from there.<br>  <br>  EDIT: I just re-read your qu.  If you're a recently born again, I would hold off at least for a little while, as this is  great time to get to know your heavenly Father and learn about what he desires for you.  I also forgot to mention that there are lots of good books out there for Christian teens on singleness and dating.  Oh, and one more thing - as well as focussing on God, please don't let this boy distract you from your schoolwork either! Please pray - wishing you all the best with it.|`|YZ8umCJXaa	Talking in tongues isn't the way you determine that u have the Holy spirit.

Christians need to have a different attitude toward dating. However, even among Christians there are differences as to whether you should or should not date. The choice is up to your and your parents, but Christian teens should still know God’s perspective on dating.<br>  <br>  Non-Christians have a different perspective on dating. You see the magazines, TV shows, and movies that tell you how you’re young, and you should date a lot of people before you get married. You see certain “role models” jumping from one dating relationship to another.<br>  <br>  Yet God has more in store for you than just jumping from one relationship to another. He is clear on whom you should date and why you should date. When it comes to Christian dating, you live according to a different standard – God’s. Yet it’s not just about following the rules. There are some solid reasons why God asks us to live a certain way, and dating is no different.<br>  <br>  While most people have differing opinions about dating, it is one area of the Bible where there is not a lot of information. However, Christian teens can get some idea of God’s expectations from certain scripture verses:<br>  <br>  Genesis 2:24: “For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and they will become one flesh.” (NIV)<br>  Proverbs 4:23: “Above all else, guard your heart, for it is the wellspring of life.” (NIV)<br>  1 Corinthians 13:4-7: “Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.” (NIV)<br>  These three scriptures give insight into the dating life of a Christian. We need to realize that God means for us to meet the ONE person that we are meant to marry. According to Genesis, a man will leave home to marry one women to become one flesh. You do not need to date a lot of people – just the right one.<br>  <br>  Also, Christian teens need to guard their hearts. The word “love” is thrown around with little thought. Yet, we often live for love. We live for God’s love first and foremost, but we also live for the love of others. While there are many definitions of love, 1Corinthians tells us how God defines love.<br>  <br>  It is love that should drive Christian teens to date, but it should not be the shallow version of love. When you date it should be taken seriously. You should know the person you are dating and know their beliefs. <br>  <br>  You should check your potential boyfriend against the values listed in 1 Corinthians. Ask yourself if the two of you are patient and kind to one another. Are you envious of one another? Do you boast about one another or to each other? Go through the characteristics to measure your relationship.|`|qA0VCdn5aa	It is perfectly fine to have 'crushes'.

pnZssBg9aa	It doesn't seem necessary at the moment. There will be a lot of disagreements if a comon language is instituted. Firstly, Germany is the most dominant EU country, so it is argued German could be the common language. Others may argue English or French.<br>  At this stage the European language that seems to unite many Europeans of different countries (Czech, Polish, etc) is Esperanto, an artificial language. But it isn't widely used today.<br>  <br>  The EU today seems more like a dud and gimmick because many of its members have disagreements and some countries seem to be more dominant (like France and Germany) compared to weaker European countries (like the new members from Eastern Europe). It does not ncessary represent the needs of all its European members.|`|jbD6SRM9aa	They already do- English.|`|AA10866651	And.....who gets to decide what the common language is going to be?|`|Qt3Zqfviaa	You know they have English.
LFTkpjGnaa	If you define magic as anything that violates the natural laws of physics, then yes miracles are magic.  Christians (and most other deists for that matter) believe that God ordained the laws of the universe and as their creator is not bound by them.  Therefore, when he causes something to happen which is not consistent with these laws it is not a violation in the same sense as when others attempt to violate these laws.<br>  <br>  Note to Tom:  The church did not kill Galleo.<br>  Galileo's championing of Copernicanism was controversial within his lifetime. The geocentric view had been dominant since the time of Aristotle, and the controversy engendered by Galileo's presentation of heliocentrism as proven fact resulted in the Catholic Church's prohibiting its advocacy as empirically proven fact, because it was not empirically proven at the time and was contrary to the literal meaning of Scripture.[7] Galileo was eventually forced to recant his heliocentrism and spent the last years of his life under house arrest on orders of the Roman Inquisition.|`|qanaIfW9aa	then I suppose you would have gone hungry if you had been on that hill with the 5000 other folk.<br>  and actually, it wasn't 12 - it was one packet of 2 dried fish and 5 small buns. the Apostles collected 12 baskets of leftovers after the meal was done. ;)<br>  <br>  no really - I think there is a difference between the two (magic and miracles), but maybe that's not relevant to this question. Maybe a person has to see a miracle to truly appreciate it's relevance? The bible teaches that the whole earth and everything in it (including us) is a miracle. <br>  there are many stories documented of unexplained phenomena in the history of the world. They are not hard to find - just google them. Not believing them makes you a sceptic. Believing them may cause you to question and explore them more, and perhaps grow your faith.|`|xxEhpytpaa	Miracles are not magic. God produced those fishes and loaves. Didn't you know that God can do anything. He can move a mountain if He wants to. It's not magic, He can just do it. Magic is done by those who want you to believe that miracles are magic. They aren't, they just happen if God wants them too. God bless you.|`|clgc86Voaa	You dont believe in miracles well for starters how about the Miracle on Ice when the USA upset the Soviet Union at the time. Or how about the people who mysteriously got healed of their cancer. Or how about a baby being born.

Or how about the countless people who almost died whether<br>  it be from a fall from a skyscraper, hit by a car, hit by a bullet in the head, have a 12-inch pipe go through your body and barely missing your heart, have a knife sticking out of your head, etc, etc. I guess you havent read the many stories in medical history that miracles have occured.

Christians say miracles, pagans believe it to be magic, it is also your take on the Deity that you serve, or if you serve one. You have one thing right it does take divine power, or energy to make it happen no matter what you believe. As far as the fish and bread goes, I believe it was a little bit of both, a divine magic trick that worked to prove to the people that Jesus was who he said he was. A very powerful person that to this day we are still talking and fighting about.|`|AA11654482	Any sufficiently advanced technology can be called a miracle. Try switching on a tv with a remote, in front of a stone-age man.

Magic existed in the old testament. The first magic that was taught to humans was when 200 angels from heaven decided to come to earth and sleep with beautiful daughters of men before the days of Noah. Genesis 6:1-8. They then taught many charms and enchantments to humans because they had heavenly wisdom.|`|U7sBZKUuaa	I personally believe that God, being the architect of the universe and the author of it's laws, does not stoop to magic to get things done. Why should He even have to? "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic." The secret to God's power it simply knowledge. He knows more than we do, so He can do more than we can. As we gain knowledge of the physical order, we also grow in power. God created light, and now, so do we, with the flip of a switch. God sees the whole world at once, and so do we, with the internet. We have flown to the moon, we exterminate diseases, and we alter the earth to suit our needs. In Genesis three God predicted that we would one day be as gods. With all of this knowledge around, who needs magic? Certainly not God.<br>  <br>  By the way, if I knew how He did the fish thing, I'd be stamping out world hunger.|`|Bi1W5U35aa	The Lord created the earth and all in it. everything is made up of atoms and molecules. If the lord can control molecules to make an earth, I am sure he could control them to make wine or anything else he wanted.

Otherwise you will have to take the word of someone who has done that.|`|ORFXYTj6aa	Hi buddy.That's 5 fish and 5 loafs of bread not 12 baskets.Wow there are atleast 11 very smart people to answer you question.Lets not forget the first miracle Jesus did "water into wine".Magic or miracle?You decide.Have a good one my friend.|`|f8mLpPXlaa	"magic" is for stage performers. Miracles are God manipulating His own laws.
rTmYpDTPaa	The answer to your question can be very different from person to person. Freemasonry can be a very individual kind of thing that way. Freemasons are all men of faith, (although the specifics of faith are not defined by the fraternity, but wholly the choice of the individual)believing themselves to be part of Creation, and held accountable for their actions not only among men but ultimately by their Creator. To that end a Freemason should be acutely aware of the value that lies in being a man of integrity, honesty and morality, which in turn should Transcend into his everyday life and reflected in his personal and business dealings with others. <br>  Outside of the individual, group efforts by Freemasons reflect this in the various charitable and humanitarian efforts that are funded and supported by the fraternity. <br>  The building of actual tangible structures has been left to the skilled builders known as operative masons. What Freemasons endeavor to build is a better self, without promise or expectation of reward or salvation, but because of desire to do so for ourselves and for the benefit of others.|`|UQTAN7cgaa	they are a social fraternity that study morality and provide more charity than any other group on the planet.<br>  <br>  there are still many who build things, although that is no longer a requirement to joining (it hasn't been a requirement in over 300 years.|`|k52tKYVPaa	freemasonry's history is one derived from trade unions but many many years ago was opened to let non masons join and it turned more in to a private social organization. there is no truth to the conspiracy theories about the masons.

You're both sort of in the wrong.  He just didn't understand that you needed to be walked to your car. Honestly, guys aren't always going to be perfect, so sometimes you have to do little things to "remind" him.  Just mention every now and then.  Things such as "I'm really glad I have you to protect me" --something like that.  I know it sounds stupid, but it should work.  It'll make him feel more appreciated for his "male role" in the relationship, therefore he should be a little more considerate of your feelings.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.

JTu1cLkYaa	Saul was one of the earliest anti-Christ's, he was responsible for the deaths of many Christians. After his encounter with the Lord on the way to Damascus and his conversion and subsequent taking on the name of Paul, he became fervent in his ministry for Christ. The Gospel of Paul is included to show that Christ's salvation is for all. Of course, that's just my opinion<br>  <br>  Bishop Athanasius of Alexandria, who selected the manuscripts which make up the books of our Bible, probably felt the message conveyed in Paul's Gospel was of great merit and belonged with the other manuscripts.  There is no evidence available as to what criteria Anthanasius used to determine which manuscripts made it into the Bible, and which didn't.|`|2Hot9EJiaa	Jesus met Paul on the road to Damascus and told him to go preach salvation to the gentiles.  The disciples preached the good news to the Jews.  Paul was in the bible to show that the greatest of sinners can become someone God uses for His glory. Paul, himself, admits that he was the chief of sinners, that was saved by God's amazing grace. Joseph Smith said that he physically saw Jesus appear before him, and that he told him to write an entirely different gospel. Paul was blinded on the road and heard from the Lord.  Paul's message was not a different gospel.|`|tI1NHwfBaa	Because Paul was called by Jesus Christ himself on the road to Damascus.<br>  <br>  As for the so-called Gospel of Thomas, this is a recently discovered book (1946 or so), that was disregarded as heresy and certainly was not written by Thomas.  The books of the New Testament were considered scripture by the early church and were copied repeatedly and shared from church to church.  Books that were heretical and did not have apostolic authorship were rejected by the early church and not copied. <br>  <br>  We have over 5,000 copies and fragments of the New Testament books from very early in their history.

However, if his son doesn't return within a specific amount of time then he will donate that property to the police academy.

XLXncQu9aa	I think we need a greater explanation of your question.  If you are talking about in terms of loyalty to one's country, then there are a few things to consider.  An example would be, if your government treats you as a citizen poorly yet we have the freedoms we do, should we riot, or remain faithful to our country?  <br>  <br>  I believe that in this aspect of government interference that causes citizens to suffer, we as citizens should not remain faithful, but I also believe rioting is out of the question.  The reason why both are bad ideas in this context is because, if you believe in your rights you need to first find peaceful measures to get your ideas across.  If the government won't listen to you, then you have to take swift action which is forming some sort of consensus amongst citizens like yourself. <br>  <br>   Its similar to how our country came to be.  Before the Declaration of Independence was written, Great Britain had control of all of the 13 colonies. Many colonists were upset at the taxation done by the British so they revolted.  The difference is that the colonist each had leaders within their assembly and they created a structure which lead to a war, and eventually the end of the British reign.  I say all of this to say, if you feel injustice there should be order.  Without order you have nothing to show for your efforts and you end up with more chaos.|`|2xmW4eo0aa	Faithfulness...........that u belive some one in deep......or in a good manner

Secondly whites hold a large percentage of economic and political power.|`|5SSchdIIaa	It's just demographics. Like in the U.S. almost %80 of citizens are Caucasian, so they are the majority. So any race that isn't white would technically be considered a minority. But it also depends on the country. For instance if you went to Barbados around %80 of the citizens there are black, so in that case whites would be a minority. So it just depends on a region's demographics.|`|oYVxMmbQaa	Because Whites make up the majority of the U.S. population.

qjzd4agiaa	Yes.  Beliefs in things like the Trinity is one.  You will find many in Europe and elsewhere who believe in it, but do not make it a doctrine of salvation like many in America do.  From the one's in Europe that I've talked to, even those who are Christian and feel very strongly about their faith, do not try to pass religious laws onto their society at the magnitude American Christians do.  I have noticed that many of them don't believe in a Rapture either.  It seems that many of them have a very basic belief of follow Jesus' example, rather than try to get everyone else to follow what they think is a good example for Jesus (which is quite often what goes on in America).<br>  <br>  A good way to find out... go to the UK version of Yahoo! Answers and ask some basic questions about belief in Christianity.  I think you'll be surprised at the differences.|`|2b257fb7862b2d3c44b77cb0b6f4c2b9aa	In everything, your difference with others is influenced by your background (culture etc). In spite of the common bible, my impression is that the American Christian is likely to be more liissez-faire in matters of faith, more promiscous, careless about matters of fornication, adultery and other vices even if they are anti-Christianity and still claim that his Xtianity is d best. <br>  This is because of his unique concept of "freedom".<br>  N.B.

He died for our sins so we would not have to suffer in going to hell.  However, we show how ungrateful we are of this by continuing to sin anyway.  It's like this.  If you took a bullet so someone that you loved would not have to suffer this injury and they turned around and shot themself anyway, wouldn't you not feel disappointed in how careless they were after your actions????|`|GJS3hTK5aa	The reason is, he loves everyone. A sinful act or thought is always against another person. Directly or indirectly, each sinful act and thought is against another person. God loves him or her and hence, whatever you do or think against him or her becomes against God himself.

You and your soul are held accountable for the sin  that you commit,You have not done anything to God, nothing you do will effect or irritate God in the least bet.<br>  <br>  Remember "God dose not need us, we need  God". By following the laws set by God, you are praised by the angles and God and believe it or not; Out of nowhere good thing start to happen to you. and if God is irritated it is only because God is merciful to us  and dose not like to see us following the wrong path.|`|yNNdHDKvaa	Because no sin is allowed in heaven, and God wishes that no one should perish,...but God having given man free-will ,...some of his creation has chosen to go against His Will ,and have fallen into sin, and this grieves God that some of those that he created have chosen to leave his Kingdom where there is no sin and no sin is allowed to enter .|`|SkgJYDaCaa	God is "bothered" by sin because it is everything that goes against Him. God is Holy and Righteous and because of this He can't have any part in sin. "Love the Lord your God with all your heart, your soul, your mind, and strength" When we sin, we are choosing to worship idols instead of God. It is telling God that our ways are better than his ways. God gave humans free will to choose whether or not we love Him; however, he says "...I have set before you life and death, blessings and curses. Now choose life" (Deut. 30:19).  Sin leads to death. God tells us it's our choice but he's saying choose life! You answered your own question when you wrote "sin goes against the nature of God." You wonder why this irritates Him. I think the answer is because when we sin we are choosing something separates us from Him.  We make our own rules and in a way we are making up our own version of God. We are telling God his ways don't matter and his plan doesn't matter to us. Jesus didn't die on a cross so that we can continue to keep sinning. That is such a sad way to treat a God of mercy and grace who loves us enough to sacrifice His only Son for our salvation. God is all powerful and all knowledgeable, it bothers him that we sin because he wants a relationship with humans but sin seperates us from Him because when we sin, we are not serving Him.|`|B36hpSCsaa	this may sound stupid, but never meant the man...   i think that the only thing bothering anyone is their own conscious, now come on, i am not an atheist nor a member of any religious group...just a believer in the faith and fate of mankind...on whose conscious may lay the definition of the word irritation...|`|FOZGMadaaa	Sin is banishment.

I think if we feel like we have done wrong in the eyes of "god" then we become weak and repent, the weakness builds our strength in the religion, it's like a cycle of degradation and building rather than learning from mistakes and moving on.<br>  <br>  There are a lot of intense contradictions in Christianity, Catholicism and so on, when you look at it from a different perspective, you'll realize it stops making sense.<br>  <br>  Check out the documentary "religulous" many biblical and other religious (many religions too) contradictions are pointed out.

He is that little voice in their heads.|`|pbyw2EYZaa	God isn't a judge.  People are.  God loves and thats all god does.  Well, aside from creates.  Sin is a useful concept but it is more than a good/bad edict.  What happens is every human being is connected to one another.  So when you harm another, you harm yourself.  God doesn't create karma though, people naturally find balancing situations.  Its part of what makes us human.  When we die we go through a process in which we experience our lives in a 3 dimensional way.  We live through situations from other perspectives, until we truly see and feel how we could have gotten it right.  Then we go through a healing... after that I don't really know.  At this point do you see what sin really represents?  It represents a moral code that attempts to help people do the right thing the first time around, so that we don't have to agonize later.  But no book can tell us what sin is.  All we can do is be kind to one another and try our best to truly love others.|`|25u9sxfsaa	god is forgiving and all if u dont repeat ur sins and u learn from ur mistakes.<br>  but if u continue doing things that u know u shouldnt be doing and u know its wrong but dont bother stopping causes him displeasure because it shows ur not being all that you can.|`|PgWkqjeZaa	It divides man from being with God which is His ultimate purpose (Romans 8).

You'll need to give him a complete makeover, a long curly blonde wig, manicure & pedicure in bright red, shave his legs, chest, underarms, go all out. You need to dress him in a corset, breast forms, garter belt, suntan stockings, padded pantie girdle, a pair of yellow 5" high heels with ankle straps. And when he's all dressed up, take him to your mom's house & let him model the dress & petticoat for her. You should have him practice square dancing in his costume & high heels before the party.

AA10530949	I'm sort of guessing sort of not on this one:<br>  <br>  There are 300,000,000 people in America (as of earlier this year).  If an adult is anybody over 18, and the average life span is around 80, then (80-18) / 80 is the percent of adults in any given population = 77.5%  I'm gonna round down to 75% since it makes sense that the child to adult ratio is getting bigger,  so take .75 * 300,000,000 and you get 225,000,000 adults.  Now multiply by .04 to get 9 million adults.|`|31e3e41e921ac26f4d4f04e1526526d4aa	.04 x 300,000,000 = 12 million.|`|AA12289772	Straight?

EkOwtna8aa	Before Islam, circling a sanctuary was very common among the Arabs as were stone idols...some simple stones and some shaped in human or other forms (the black stone at kaaba is itself a meteorite, was worshipped prior to Islam by the followers of Hubal a.k.a. Al-Ilah or the deity whose 3 daughter-goddesses appear in the Quran and undoubtedly owes it's power to the fact that it "fell from heaven" in the remote past). The person circling very often either kissed or caressed the idol during his circling (in circling the Kaaba the Muslim touches a stone and kisses a stone on each circle don't forget). Some think that the circling of the Kaaba was emblematic of the circling of the planets and some go as far to say that the seven circuits of the kaaba (3 fast and 4 slow) are in imitation of the inner and outer planets. In any event, this ritual is based in pre-Islamic paganism (as are the other rituals of the hajj and the hajj itself along with many other aspects of Islam). Pagan Arabs performed what is now called the hajj and worshipped at Mecca long before Muhommad or Islam were thought of. Islam was never what may be considered a "innovative" religion...every aspect is borrowed from other religions and traditions contemporary to the time of Muhommad (if there ever actually was a Muhommad) or before. Look at the 5 daily prayers for instance. Originally, Muhommad prescribed 2 daily prayers. After more exposure to the Jews he raised the requirement to 3 (to coincide with Judaisms shakharith, minkah and arbith prayers) as recorded in the Quran. After Islam came into contact with the Zoroastrian Persians the Muslims adopted 5 daily prayers to coincide with the 5 gahs (prayers) of the Persians. There is still disagreement til this day with regards to the number of prayers between Shia and Shia and Shia and Sunni for instance. Some Shia simply pray 3 prayers a day and some pray 2 prayers at once 2 of the 3 times to reach 5 prayers a day and some pray 5 times a day while Sunnis usually pray 5 prayers a day at 5 different times. Confusing.... and not exactly perfect.|`|SzqeeUxgaa	This is not the first time you asking this question. so put in lil efforts, search and you will find your answer~!<br>  <br>  <br>  No, I don't like banging my head against the wall.

bZo5Z53Uaa	Do not be sad, because the true span of life is measured by the number of days in which you are content. Do not then spend your days in grief, do not waste your nights in sorrow, and do not be extravagant in squandering your time; for truly, Allah loves not those who are extravagant and wasteful.<br>  <br>  Do not be sad, for in truth, your Lord forgives sins and accepts repentance.<br>  <br>  When you read the following verse, does not your heart feel peaceful, are not your worries driven away, and does not happiness permeate your whole being?<br>   <br>  Say: `O' my slaves who have transgressed against themselves [by committing evil deeds and sins]! Despair not of the Mercy of Allah, verily Allah forgives all sins. Truly, He is Of-Forgiving, Most Merciful.  (Qur'an 39: 53)<br>  <br>  He addressed them with, `O' my slaves,' to tame their hearts and souls. He specifically mentioned those who transgress, since they are more disposed than others to perpetrate evil deeds on a continual basis. How much greater then will be the Mercy of Allah for others! Thus He forbade them from despairing and from losing hope of attaining forgiveness. And He informed them that He forgives all sins of the one who repents, whether they are big or small, important or unimportant.<br>  <br>  Do you not then rejoice upon reading the following verses?<br>  <br>  And those who, when they have committed Fahishah [illegal sexual intercourse etc.] or wronged themselves with evil, remember Allah and ask forgiveness for their sins -- and none can forgive sins but Allah - And do not persist in what [wrong] they have done, while they know.

Not sure what her religious beliefs are and what methods she would find acceptable.  But it wouldn't hurt to try something that may help to ease her mind as well as yours.<br>  <br>  A native american practice called smudging could be tried in the room - burning a sage smudge stick (or sage incense) - the smoke of sage is believed to cleanse a room of any negative energies.  <br>  <a href="http://www.crystalinks.com/smudging.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.crystalinks.com/smudging.html</a>|`|cyh8uhAnaa	Wow...I think your grandmother has gone through something recently or experienced something that she was scared of, therefore making her paranoid.

The priests allow you to take holy water from church, as long as they know you will not do anything bad with it.  We wanted to bless our house, so we wanted to get a priest over.  They said that anyone can bless their house, and he let us take some holy water.

I do think I have seen a real Ghost once, but I am not sure to this day. <br>  <br>  It was after my 2nd daughter was born. It was really late and I was awake doing the dishes while the rest of the house slept. it was quiet and I was immersed in my own thoughts when I felt a pull for me to turn around an look and I saw sort of an outline of a man with a cowboy hat walking through my living room and I remember thinking he looked a lot like my husband, only taller. <br>  <br>  I went and woke my husband and told him and he sort of smiled through his bleary-eyed expression and said oh, that just my Uncle Dale coming to see the new baby.  creeeeeepy. <br>  <br>  I called my mother in-law and  said everyone in the family sees Dale every now and then. <br>  She told me several other stories about when Dale appears but they are too personal to share on this forum.|`|90eM5tMaaa	ghosts are real you are a ghost your self but have a body ghosts are energy spirit all living radiates energy so when you die your energy lives your body some energy may get lost and wonder  around,you want to see ghosts go to the cementery late at night start messing around with the tombstone,if nothing happens you might die from something later on tried it if you dont believe me|`|d3VV4b6vaa	go to a psychic or a medium and ask to talk to a dead relative, or someone you knew....you'll be amazed. then you will see how foolish you are for being skeptical about ghosts|`|PXfUyd5aaa	The burden of proof lies not with the skeptic.<br>  <br>  You don't have to prove that they're not real.

I find some of the ghost hunter shows to be a crock.  Most of them go out for the dramatic.  I watch Ghost Hunters with Jason and Grant and have been to their lectures.  They go in to debunk the happenings and try to recreate them. However, there are times when they just cannot do it. Try watching them and not those thrill ones with the guys in there with their exorcism stuff, etc.  <br>  <br>  I don't know of anyone proving beyond a shadow of a doubt that they do exist but also no one has proven that they don't either.<br>  <br>  Why not take a trip to say the Eastern State Penitentary in Philadelphia and spend the night. See what you say then. It would be a personal experience for you.<br>  <br>  To each his own on whether or not to believe in ghosts.

What do you think happens to the energy that runs through your body once your organs stop working and your body no longer functions?  It just disappates into nothing?  My opinion, it has to go somewhere.  I believe the spirit is the energy that holds our soul, even if our physical body dies.  Upon death, we are supposed to cross over to another plane of existence, call it the spirit world, heaven, whatever you like.  However, as we lived with free will, so do we have it in death, and a spirit may choose not to "cross over", for whatever its reason, and remain earthbound.  It is these earthbound spirits that we refer to as ghosts.<br>  <br>  No, there is no "concrete" proof about the existence or non-existence of ghosts that is generally agreed upon by science.  Science doesn't have "the answers" yet, but that doesn't mean it won't some day.  There are tons of paranormal research organizations out there that are seeking these answers and developing new technology all the time.  Such as The Atlantic Paranormal Society - which is featured on Sci-Fi's "Ghost Hunters"  The Sci-Fi show's purpose isn't so much to "prove ghosts exist" as it is to present a reality show about what a credible paganormal research organization does, how they work, etc.  It is a subject that interests many people.  (And keep in mind that we don't see everything involved in a complete investigation - there just wouldn't be enough time - the episodes give us an extremely summarized version of the basics and some highlights.)<br>  <br>  The Atlantic Paranormal Society is a real group - based not far from where I reside. <br>  <br>  I've had my own experiences with paranormal activity, a couple of which I attribute to ghosts.  I can't give you an article written by someone I don't know as tangible evidence, because then I have no proof or absolute knowledge that it is.  But The Atlantic Paranormal Society has a rather good selection of articles on their website - and having met the co-founders personally, I can recommend them.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.the-atlantic-paranormal-society.com/articles/articles.html#general" rel="nofollow">http://www.the-atlantic-paranormal-socie...</a><br>  <br>  But, you will probably be like most skeptics, and continue to disbelieve until you have an experience of your own - and that's fine.|`|tYqUutidaa	Ghosts are real. The following is condensed from my second book, Voyage Beyond Doubt<br>  <br>  "Several times a year I get calls from someone concerned about a ghostly presence they're aware of, usually in their home. Some callers are frantic, worried the ghost might do them harm. Others are more concerned for the welfare of a ghost. There are some simple things anyone can do to permanently move a ghost out of their house. Before getting to them, let's cover some basics and hopefully clear up a few misconceptions.<br>  <br>  First, the most important thing to know is that ghosts are just human beings not living in physical bodies. These are people just like you and me. Like people everywhere, ghosts can be friendly, scary, smart, stupid and everything in between, but they're just people.<br>  <br>  Second, at its most basic, the reason you can be aware of a ghost is because its attention is focused at the level of physical world reality. There can be many reasons why ghosts do this. They may be unaware they're dead and staying close to familiar surroundings or people. They may be aware of their death, but confused about what they're supposed to do. Some ghosts may have a message they want to give someone still living in the physical world. There are lots of reasons why a ghost's attention may be focused at the level of physical world reality, but that focus of attention is what brings them to your awareness and keeps them here.<br>  <br>  Third, you have nothing to fear from a ghost. Despite what Hollywood horror films would have us believe, such a person is not a threat to you. Projecting your own fear onto a ghost can certainly appear to give evidence to the contrary. Too many people I work with bought into Hollywood's fear-inducing images, and are scared out of their wits, thus adding to their problem.<br>  <br>  Fourth, there are Helpers living in the nonphysical world who will gladly assist you in your attempt to move a ghost along. All you have to do is ask. Often the Helper is someone actively trying to assist the ghost, but unable to reach him. Sometimes there's a Helper waiting to move a specific ghost. The Afterlife abounds with Helpers willing to volunteer their assistance wherever such an opportunity presents itself."<br>  <br>  So again, yes, ghosts are real. They're just human beings stuck in Focus 23 close enough to physical world reality that some of us are able to perceive them.<br>  <br>  Editor's Note: Bruce's books contain accounts of encounters with ghosts and his removal of them from people's homes, as well as tips for amateur ghost busters.|`|2ZS0qyKWaa	Ghost are real (im a shaman I see them live with them just like you and I hang out with humans in this world) but you didn't ask for personal stuff.<br>  Its hard to explain but if you know a  little about dimensions and stuff you could follow this.<br>  We live in the 4th dimension (space(2) + time(2)), Ghosts are in the 5th dimension (space(2)+Time(2)+multiply time-lines(1)).<br>  But your asking my to proof a dimension without any proof.

XLXncQu9aa	For some reason I feel compelled to say Barrack Obama.  I think what he did was extraordinary.  The reason why I believe Obama was and is a brave individual is because he ran for office in a time when many weren't sure if America was ready for an African American president.  He was the first to jump over the barrier that had been in our country for so long.  He defied the odds that were set before him based on what history said.  I'm sure he may have had a few lingering doubts about running and if he would win, but the fact was that he ran, he faced the old stereotypes that our country generated, and he stood in the face of racism, and not only ran but won.  He was courageous because he went through with running when there were many that said it would never happen.  Secondly, he was courageous because he took on a huge responsibility.  Being president is a large responsibility in itself, but it makes it ten times harder when you have a national debt to deal with, two wars (Iraq, Afghanistan), terrorist threats looming over us as a country, our economic situation continuing to worsen, and a whole host of other issues.  He has a lot on his plate to deal with, and he stood in the face of all of these issues.  For those two reasons I gave, he is very courageous.|`|48b84a8f546ab32d894f3370f4eca47faa	Anyone who does what's right regardless of opinion or personal sacrifice.|`|jinAwMGNaa	Not just one, but the multitude of Military Personnel that have lost limbs and are recuperating at Walter Reed.

Usually it is ethnic discrimination. It is one of the many problems that black people need to overcome as an effect of slavery but we should be responsible now, no excuses involved. As black people range from many different skin tones, discrimination is destined to be an issue. Racist, stereotypical views being perpetrated by someone of your own race is much more hurtful than it being spoken by someone of another race. It feels as though you have been betrayed. Ironically, the black people doing this will be the people quickest to call someone "white" because they are clever.|`|hQWucH5uaa	Good gravy I've been mentioning white-on-white racisms for the past 15 years.<br>  <br>  NO IRISH NEED APPLY, predjudice against Catholics, Jews, and Mormons in the USA all by the WASP (White Anglo-Saxon Protestant).<br>  <br>  If you are a so-called 'white' person, and you are not of the proper pedigree, try applying for a job at a top insurance company, finance company, or the senior ranks of the military officer corp - and you will experience white-on-white racism.  Poor whites are treated like trash or second class citizens.  In fact, a poor white person is invisible and has nothing going for them as opposed to a poor black person who has affirmative action, minority quotas, forced busing and civil rights protections - not the poor white.  <br>  <br>  White liberals hate white conservatives and white Jews hate white Christians.<br>  <br>  So yes, there is definately an active amount of white-on-white racism throughout American history, particularly against the 'ethnics': Italians, Polish, Irish, Germans, Lithuanians, etc. etc.|`|yiBSvLf8aa	A couple of note-worthy quotes:<br>  <br>  "People need to develop identities that make them feel distinct and valuable.  <br>  We also need to celebrate the values we share with those different from ourselves." - Susan V.

Realmente é sempre bom fazermos uma reflex?o sobre os assuntos divinos. Normalmente isso pode nos escapar. E é algo muito importante. A convivência com Deus. Confesso que ultimamente estou um pouquinho relapso quanto a isso e normalmente n?o sou assim. Dou estudos Bílibos e trabalho na obra de Deus. <br>  <br>  Sexta a noite eu quase quebrei minha m?o fazendo um treinamento de artes marciais, o qual sou professor, mas gra?as a Deus n?o fraturei (apesar de uma médica que n?o sabia direito o que estava fazendo te dito que eu tinha fraturado um osso). Bom! Como sou enfermeiro também, sabia que n?o tinha fraturado e fui num ortopedista amigo meu. No momento que ele viu minha m?o e a radiografia teve certeza que n?o se tratava de uma fratura. <br>  <br>  Eu dei gra?as a Deus, pois já estava ficando muito triste por achar que iria ficar de molho mais ou menos uns 21 dias com gesso. Além de ter que parar com todas as minhas atividades e trabalhos. <br>  <br>  Gra?as a Deus, Ele me mostrou que as coisas sempre s?o do jeito que Ele quer e n?o da forma que nós queremos...<br>  <br>  Aprendi uma li??o essa semana.

Sendo assim acho muito mais fácil colocar em dúvida o que os cientistas fazem que a Fé que há tanto anima nossa existência. Um exemplo que considero clássico nas controvérsias da ciência é a transmiss?o de caracteres secundários, ela existe ou n?o? A história da ciência está nas m?os do homem e por isso é um produto de suas a??es, é modificada e trabalhada por ele de acordo com suas conveniências.

MgMsMExPaa	Why don't you start looking for a support group for gay teenagers in your area. Most large cities have these . This will give you an outlet to date people other than at school and may avoid some confrontations. <br>  This would also allow a larger dating pool of people that would be from other schools and allow for a larger circle of friends. <br>  After you have spent some time in high school then you can make an assessment of the risk of coming out to everyone there. <br>  As for as girls go if they ask you out just say, Do you have a brother? and let them figure it out themselves. If you are not dating them,they do not need to know. Good luck and have fun in high school .|`|YQA3FHGVaa	No.  I wouldn't say anything.  It's none of people's business. However, if they ask you, then you should admit it and then move on.  Act like it doesn't bother you.  <br>  <br>  Unless you go to a good high school, I HIGHLY recommend against making it known to everyone that you're gay.  Been there done that....|`|oZE510pGaa	my advice from experience is not to tell at the beginning of high school<br>  people are still immature and nearly every guys sexuality is questioned by others so there anger would turn on to you<br>  besides its no ones business to know<br>  if you feel you really want to tell then think about telling your closest friends|`|aYqCb3olaa	us teens can be mean,<br>  its not their business.|`|9BFyrI0waa	That is a great strategy that you came up with!

If people start hating on you in the hallways when your alone you need to be able to stand up for yourself.<br>  <br>  And highschoolers aren't focusing on college, they will care - of course a lot of them won't but many of them will. Be ready for anything and good luck :)|`|nBkHjCFQaa	you think high schoolers really plan on getting their lives started and planning for college, thats funny. <br>  i think that telling people your gay should matter on where your at. If your at a city that is open and diverse then sure. but there still are gay bashers in high school and gay people are picked on a lot. <br>  <br>  the one thing that irritates me is when people ask if someone is gay and then they say thats cool, one of my cousins friends is gay.|`|6w7FKrlfaa	i went through hell in high school..  but i'm 28 now.. so it was quite a while ago..  i agree with u though.. be proud.. there is nothing wrong with being gay.. is someone asks you or what ever say that u are.. but be prepared for some closed minded people to call u names etc..  good luck|`|0121db3d89fa7258a5d230763048afc9aa	high school kids = immature punks<br>  <br>  DO NOT COME OUT IN HIGH SCHOOL<br>  <br>  It's not worth it dude. Really. If someone asks you out, just tell them you aren't interested (a girl). You don't have to say you are gay.|`|kfjZJ83kaa	ok, LISTEN TO ME! This is IMPORTANT/VALUABLE info that I'm telling you. You WONT regret it if you listen to me, it will save you from a lot of grief and trouble if you do.  thank you.<br>  <br>  Dude, you're in 8th grade, which is actually really young to be coming out to just anyone in your high school.  I would advise that if you really feel like you need to come out to some ppl or you feel like you can't keep it a secret any more, ONLY come out to a close group of friends.  And if you do have a group of friends to come out to, you can also tell people if they ask you, but i would only do so if they are trustworthy people and you know they are not homophobic.  Otherwise, DONT come out in high school.  Trust me, people are NOT any more mature in high school.  What you are thinking is wrong.  I thought the same thing when i was going from elementary school to middle school (but i did not know i was gay at that time), and people were not any more mature.  Just trust me.   <br>  <br>  So to summarize, DONT come out in high school unless you have a close group of friends that will accept you and then you can also tell ppl that ask you if you trust them.  <br>  <br>  If you don't listen to my advice, your entire high school life could literally be ruined and miserable. I am NOT joking.

One guy was oddly serious and guarded during the day, yet look like a well behaved little boy while he slept.<br>  <br>  Idk, it's just - arrgh - guys looks so cute when they sleep. It's weird. It's probably the nurturing instinct. Both cultures raise girls to see motherhood as part of their natural identities. They've been specially socialized to care for others.

I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that the Bible was "breathed out" by God.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1: 11-12 tells us that the gospel was a revelation from Jesus Christ himself, which was recorded by Jesus disciples and Paul.<br>  <br>  God himself chose the disciples and the people whom He knew were going to spread His word and write the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors. The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist? Is He God? Why did He suffer on the Cross?<br>  2) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet?

The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6.

tRcO5uyiaa	While the technology had been developed since 1940, it wasn't until 1971 that AT&T submitted a request to the FCC for cellular service. It took more than 10 years for an approval and in 1982,  Mobile Phone Service arrived. Digital came online as of 1990. So basically, teens have had cell phones since 1990. I don't believe that they should be allowed to have a cell phone at all. <br>  <br>  1. Teenagers already have enough going on in their lives to distract them.<br>  <br>  2. Teenagers are still growing technically, and it has been proven that cell phones give off potentially harmful radiation to brain cells.<br>  <br>  3. During school, it is extremely disruptive for a student (or many) to have their phones ringing during class.<br>  <br>  4. Teens distance themselves from more people using the cell phone. Friends tend to hang out far apart just so they can call each other. "Face time" has become somewhat of a thing of the past.<br>  <br>  5. Taking a cell phone to school does not "lessen" the teen's chances of getting into trouble or requiring assistance.<br>  <br>  You may use any or all of this information.|`|xRUZkFU9aa	No generally. Why in the world does a teen or any kid deserve some phone that they can't afford and didn't earn. Even if they can afford it...who the hell do they need to be talking to during a school week?<br>  <br>  When I have children, I will get them those limited trac phones..for EMERGENCY use only. I think there should be a rule that all cell phones are turned off during school hours and put in a basket. If a child is caught with one there should be consequences and a fine sent to their parents. THEY ARE THERE TO LEARN!|`|UOIcXs7Haa	Yes but they should keep them off during class.<br>  Also it means that parents can easily be contacted in an emergency.<br>  <br>  Edit: I see most people have just said it's a distraction, yes it is if it's on during class time. When i was in school i would bring mine with me, just in case i would need it and the odd time i did need to use it.|`|0c44c557b5bc5a2df5e3cbbcf028239baa	I don't think they should even be allowed inside the school, because the temptation of someone using them and because of the distraction they cause. Every day some will not turn it off and it will ring in class.|`|peEgWlTDaa	No, they are a distraction and unnecessary. Feel free to use my statement, short and succinct!|`|4xOXiZcNaa	NO.. they are a DISTRACTION to EVERYONE because the student needs to study and everyone else doesn't need to listen to their stupid, childish phone calls|`|db9f4e17f5a919d6fbcc6f293a58f828aa	NO, they have enough distractions. They can call friends later.|`|fHpPgMlZaa	No. <br>  <br>  ok to use.|`|OUBuIKDMaa	I agree with the idea that they should be kept off and out of sight during school hours, because even if the phones are off they still have voice mail that can be checked after school. The simple fact of the matter is that, although there are exceptions, most teenagers are far too immature and irresponsible to be trusted to only use the cell phone at appropriate times so if they want to bring them to school they should be required to hand them in to their teachers during class and then they can get them back after the period is over.|`|171a80e252b822a9deb861297f623e51aa	I think they should be allowed to bring them, but the phones must be OFF during class.  No vibrating, no texting, no mosquito tones (which many of us old folks can hear, by the way).  The phones should be used only during lunch break or other breaks longer than those for just getting to and from classes.  If there's an emergency during class, that can always be handled the old-fashioned way -- with a call to the office.|`|j1reoYyYaa	No. Even in the office because cellphone can divide your attention. So, students are not advised to bring it. To have more attention on the things around them and to be able for them to participate in class with undivided attention.|`|rRVzWFYZaa	If they have them at school, they should be turned off and kept out of sight.  They're a huge distraction, can be used to bully people, and also can be used to cheat on tests.|`|lh0aN8Rfaa	I had one...I think it's all right as long as they keep them turned off during class.  Like everyone else, cell phones are always good for emergencies, and emergencies do occasionally happen in high school.|`|BdVNsbPraa	Yes they should. In case of an emergency anything can happen they need to reach their families or their families may want to reach the its a matter of life or death|`|liLKDQu3aa	"Yes."<br>  <br>  you can use my statement.|`|GBnj1lo1aa	yes helps them keep track of time if they don't have a watch and also it reassures parents if the child can contact them if they have any problems|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	Absolutely NOT. They can BRING them to school but there should be a zero tolerance for bringing them into any classroom or using them during school hours. No exceptions. Anyone caught using a cell phone or texting in class has their phone confiscated.|`|AA11312653	Yes, with the restriction that parents sign agreement that if that device is seen or heard during school hours or on school property, it will be confiscated. I would consider having designated "phone zones" to be used during designated times or in an authorized emergency situation, like "Mom, I left my medication in the car. Please turn around and bring it to me."<br>  <br>  My thought is banning them completely means that the students could not bring them to school at all, and thus would not be able to use them to contact parents AFTER school unless they made a special trip home to retrieve the device. This would create an undue hardship in many families or for students who have after school jobs.|`|dvQYaRNDaa	Yes they should be allowed to. Here's why:<br>  <br>  My nephew is in 8th grade and while they've banned cell phone use the school also refuses to send out important notices to students from the office. Say I call the school with a message for my nephew not to pick his niece up they don't give him the message because 'thats disrupting class time.'<br>  <br>  At the same time however if my nephew were to answer a call or text in class he's be reprimanded and punished with his cell phone being taken away so he'd never get the message in the end.<br>  <br>  If cell phone use was allowed things would run a lot smoother and there wouldn't be confusion.|`|ADP9swbMaa	They should be turned off during school hours. If a kid needs to contact a parent after school hours, that's fine and a reason why they should be brought to school. <br>  However, texting and playing games during class is not only rude, but it inhibits your learning. If I were a teacher, I would enforce a strict "If I see it, I take it" rule regarding phones.|`|IB2V5t1Oaa	Yes they should. God forbid but what if there's another Columbine incident. I think your parents would want to be able to get in touch with  you ASAP.|`|26c154b69baa8aa4faf85a634112c1aeaa	no<br>  <br>  bullying <br>  <br>  stolen <br>  <br>  damaged etc

Not to mention the fact that he was being followed around by twelve men who were telling everyone that he was the Savior, I am sure that he didn't have to deal with the whole sex on demand thing, it was more then likely being thrown at him, literally.

YxQRC8q0aa	No, having lived in both I can tell you what would happen. The blacks and latinos would become as boring as the whites. Why? Because even though their race adds a cultural aspect to a neighborhood, suburbs are slow in general. Population density is low, therefore its hard for lots of interesting things too happen. Besides suburbs are mostly comprised of parents who want to raise kids in a "safe" environment. They are kept slow intentionally, and they successfully achieve that purpose.<br>  <br>  Yes the suburbs are ****** up now, but they wouldn't become much different. Don't get me wrong, Latinos always add flavor to a neighborhood. I used to hit up block parties with dancing and music. Black guys always seem to have a pick-up game of something going. But these cultural aspects die in suburbs.<br>  <br>  Most white people have never seen both sides. I have; I guess thats lucky.|`|GTuoRorFaa	No, the whites would just move away just like they did in the 70's. Back then it was called white flight. People want a living area that is safe to raise their kids. It is not in a place where blacks live. Hispanics are not so bad. When I see them say, in a restaurant, they are together as a family, with a father present, and most of them go to church....and they smile at me. Blacks don't smile back at white people. If blacks smiled sincerely at white people, and showed them that they do not hate them, racism would end.|`|V7rA5yxjaa	There are plenty of places where there are mostly latinos and blacks, only most people aim not to live there. I'll take boring anyday if it means I can have peace of mind even if I forget to lock my door.|`|GahpE5U2aa	Here in Sweden the majority of non-whites live in suburbs.<br>  <br>  And no, the suburbs are still boring. It's actually one reason why there's a lot of crime here (in the suburbs). It's very common for bored kids to create havoc just for the hell of it. :/|`|LIyqb5Rwaa	The people paying the bills (the adults) LIKE the suburbs to be boring.  In fact they don't call it boring, they call it peaceful and quite.<br>  <br>  It's only teens who describe suburbs a boring and wish for the excitement of city life.  But you know what?  City teens are bored out of their skulls too.

njrKjJVwaa	You'll find them with LIDL but try do make them yourself, its easy: <br>  Here is a basic recipe for German, pan-fried, meat patties "Frikadellen":<br>  Prep Time: 15 minutes<br>  Cook Time: 15 minutes<br>  Ingredients:<br>  <br>      * 1 c. chopped onion (about 1/2 of a large onion)<br>      * 1 tsp. oil<br>      * 1 day-old roll (about 2 oz.), softened in hot milk or water and squeezed dry.<br>      * 1 lb. ground meat (half and half; pork and beef)<br>      * 2 eggs<br>      * 1 tsp. salt<br>      * 1/4 tsp. fresh ground pepper<br>      * 3 T. chopped, fresh parsley or 1 T. dried parsley<br>      * 1 T. chopped, fresh marjoram or 1 tsp. dried marjoram<br>      * 1 T. butter<br>      * 1 T. olive oil<br>  <br>  Preparation:<br>  <br>  Place chopped onion in a small bowl, drizzle with 1 teaspoon oil, cover with plastic wrap and microwave on high 2-3 minutes, or until translucent. Cool slightly.<br>  <br>  Break softened roll into little pieces in a bowl, add meat and the rest of the ingredients and the cooked onion and mix well.<br>  <br>  Heat butter and olive oil together in a frying pan. Form 4 patties and fry over medium high heat until browned on both sides. Place the patties on a baking sheet and place in a 350°F oven for 15 minutes, or until done. You may also continue frying them until they are no longer pink inside.<br>  <br>  Serve on a lettuce leaf with a side of potato salad and some mustard. A cold beer goes well with this small meal.<br>  <br>  Tip 1: You may want to roll your patties in dried, seasoned bread crumbs before frying for a really nice, crispy exterior.<br>  <br>  Tip 2: If you have German relatives, they might tell you to add some Maggi or Fondor to the meat mixture. These are two, related products. One is liquid, the other a powder. They contain salt, gluten, glutamate, starch and a proprietary herb and spice mixture, and have a distinct taste of lovage (related to celery). You can add a teaspoon or two to almost any savory dish you make, and some people use Maggi as a table side condiment, like soy sauce or steak sauce.<br>  <br>   Frikadellen mit Kümmel (Meat Patties with caraway), Berlin-Style. Substitute 1 teaspoon caraway and 2 teaspoons prepared mustard for the parsley and marjoram. Fry as directed. Serve with Bratkartoffeln and mustard, or with a hard roll.|`|Jr5YZ8Qbaa	Lidl sometimes sells them.|`|7d3a1d40f650c7d8ae357af55b97ff96aa	Definitely get them in Lidls, I buy them all the time.|`|246kxprqaa	try aldi/lidl.....they not as good as the ones you get in the nederlands but hey

It depicts a nude male figure in two superimposed positions with his arms and legs apart and simultaneously inscribed in a circle and square. The drawing and text are sometimes called the Canon of Proportions or, less often, Proportions of Man. It is stored in the Gallerie dell'Accademia in Venice, Italy, but is only displayed on special occasions.<br>  <br>  The drawing is based on the correlations of ideal human proportions with geometry described by the ancient Roman architect Vitruvius in Book III of his treatise De Architectura. The drawing is named in honour of the architect. Vitruvius described the human figure as being the principal source of proportion among the Classical orders of architecture. Other artists had attempted to depict the concept, with less success.|`|Dujw71Muaa	I know what you're talking about. I've seen this picture before.

But I'm not likely to waste my time romancing someone who would never have any romantic interest in me.|`|16EYP0Xiaa	I have no problem at all with lesbians, unless they are of the "man-hating variety" [a term told to me by a lesbian co-worker]. Nor do I have a problem with bisexual women.|`|NBXY35zPaa	There are some who are VERY attractive, and some who aren't... they look just like everyone else. My girlfriend's sister is a lesbian and she's gorgeous and so is her girlfriend. They also have very good looking lesbian friends, and some who look like men. Whenever I see one that's very attractive and find out she's a lesbian I just think "man, I have no chance in hell..." haha|`|eqhqnaogaa	A lot of guys seem to get turned on a little more, because they think of the beauty of girl on girl porn. I think it's because there's almost a double helping of women in them. <br>  <br>  I feel the same way about bi or gay boys. <br>  <br>  If they're appalled, maybe they can't get what they want from that girl or maybe 'butch' lesbians are unattractive.|`|283tO9j9aa	According to my boyfriend and male friends, they're good in that it's four boobs instead of two, and bad because you know you won't get anywhere near those boobs.<br>  <br>  I think what someone else said about the relationship to the girls is true- most guys would be upset if their girlfriend suggested a threesome with another girl and then spent all her time with the second girl instead of with him- it wouldn't be fun and unless he was into watching her with other people anyway he'd feel kind of like she'd taken advantage of him wanting to try that.

I find women who self-identify as lesbian, but who also occasionally find certain men attractive, as highly intriguing.  I have had numerous female friends who are lesbian.  We have served as "wingmen" for each other on a number of nights out.  I have never fantasized about them as being into me (in any self-gratification scenario) because they were so not into men I overcame that nearly immediately.  From that point on we could talk about girls freely in a manner that did not make her uncomfortable.  Although the cliche may say differently, I have never found people so apt to just talk about and compare women as my lesbian friends.  I believe when certain homosexual females find a guy who accepts them and does not try to hit on them, they relax and can just kick it about chicks.|`|B7WIZdglaa	I think it depends. Alot of guys that I know would not let another girl in their bed w/their girlfriend (even if the gf wanted it). Alot of the guys say that its really no different from another guy being in bed w/them- its the point of someone else being sexual with someone you love. NOW, if its just 2 random girls that the guy doesnt care about..  im sure he'd be all about it.|`|1yJWrccXaa	It depends on each individual woman.  Stereotypes just don't work.

But exactly what will come to an end?<br>  <br>  Jesus Christ contrasted "this age" with "the age to come" (Matthew 12:32). The word translated "age" in this passage is the Greek word aion (from which we derive the English word eon), signifying "a period of indefinite duration . . . marked by spiritual or moral characteristics" (Vine's Complete Expository Dictionary of Old and New Testament Words, 1985, "Age").<br>  <br>  Paul contrasted the age "which is to come" (Ephesians 1:21) with the world we know, which he called "this present evil age" (Galatians 1:4). Spiritually and morally, this age and the age to come are opposites.<br>  <br>  To properly understand the two, we must realize that this is not God's world. God is not the author of the broken homes, shattered marriages, violence, racial and ethnic hatred, governmental corruption, greed, pollution, depression, disease and persecution and the resultant suffering we see around us. Paul pinpoints the cause of these sorrows: "the god of this age" (2 Corinthians 4:4), none other than Satan the devil.<br>  <br>  How great is the influence of this being? The apostle John tells us that "the whole world lies under the sway of the wicked one" (1 John 5:19). All of humanity is influenced by the thinking, attitudes and actions of this wicked being and his evil cohorts, the demons. John further warns that Satan's deceptive power is so great that he "deceives the whole world" (Revelation 12:9).<br>  <br>  Satan's influence is as immense as it is pervasive. Odd as it may sound, one of Satan's greatest areas of influence is religion, where his ideas—not God's —dominate. Paul warns Christians of Satan's deceptive power even within Christianity: Just as "Satan himself transforms himself into an angel of light," so do his representatives masquerade as "ministers of righteousness" and "apostles of Christ" (2 Corinthians 11:13-15).<br>  <br>  Paul warns those who would live godly lives that they must constantly struggle against unseen spiritual influences dominating the world around them. "For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this age, against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places" (Ephesians 6:12).<br>  <br>  Under Satan's influence, the world has its own "wisdom" (1 Corinthians 1:20-29), a way of thinking that considers the God of the Bible and His way of life as "foolishness" (1 Corinthians 2:14). As a result, mankind does not recognize that it is man's collective rejection of God and His ways that has brought the suffering and sorrow that permeate the world.<br>  <br>  When Scripture mentions "the time of the end" or "the end of the age," it is referring to the coming end of the present evil age. This age—in reality the age of Satan—will draw to an end, replaced by the age of God's rule over and guidance of all of humanity.<br>  <br>  This age to come—often referred to in the Bible as the time the Kingdom of God will govern the earth—will be ushered in by Jesus Christ at His return.

It's worthwhile to note that it's only 1.4% Black by population. It also has a high median income.
423b37222c9aecc6d4e09218cb231a06aa	The Verse of Guardianship:<br>  <br>  "O you who believe! Obey Allah, and obey the Messenger, and those vested with authority over you ('Ul ul-'amr minkum). And if you quarrel about something, then refer it to Allah and the Messenger." <br>  <br>  By the explanation from the Prophet Muhammad, this verse is also one of the Quranic references to the leadership of Imam Ali after the Prophet, and it necessitates the obedience of the faithful to Allah, the Prophet, and those vested with authority over them. When this verse was revealed to the Prophet, one of his great companions, Jabir ibn 'Abdullah al-Ansari asked:<br>  <br>  O Prophet of Allah! We know Allah and His Messenger, but who are 'those vested with authority over you' ('Ul ul-'amr) whose obedience Allah considers equal to that of Allah and the Prophet? The Prophet replied that those are my successors and the leaders of the Muslims after me. The first of them is Ali ibn Abi Talib, then al-Hassan and al-Husayn, then Ali ibn al-Husayn, then Muhammad ibn Ali, who is known as al-Baqir. You, Jabir will see him and when you see him, give him my salam. Then al-Sadiq Ja'far ibn Muhammad, then Musa ibn Ja'far, then Ali ibn Musa, then Muhammad ibn Ali, then Ali ibn Muhammad, then al-Hassan ibn Ali, then the one who bears my name, Muhammad. And he will be the proof (hujjah) of Allah on the earth.|`|nS7koC7Oaa	Are you on drugs again?<br>  <br>  "Rasoolallah (saww) descendants only from Imam Ali (as)"!!<br>  <br>  how did you get this info? have you done too much research to get this result?|`|mOWyzwubaa	for sunnis abdul wahab is !!

AA10198024	well the dream books I have looked at might say something like you have something you have to get done but you donnot have the resources to get it done. You are worried so myou try to get it any way you know how, but you end up in trouble, so the book might say be careful to keep going in the right direction and stay honest so you don't end up in a life of crime....could mean anything to me....but psychologists say something like look at what is going on in your life and you could probably come up with why you had this dream....like maybe you watched a movie about a cheating husband while you were hungry and wanted mcdonalds, but your car was in the shop....see what I mean...good luck and don't worry dreams are mainly outlets for over stimulation during the day...like to much tv...okay later melissa|`|dfa9368d3a7a82f7ea9f26d1a35db02daa	That is funny.

jinAwMGNaa	NONE AT ALL!!  Just one incident, Concerning the massacre in VA.  CAMPUS SECURITY WAS THE PROBLEM THERE, and CAMPUS SECURITY IS THE PROBLEM NATION WIDE! Proactive action and planning would, most of the time, prevent and/or greatly reduce Campus crime. Campus Crime Prevention Programs would keep students acutely aware of potentially dangerous situations and current scams. It would also develop CP attitudes and techniques that would become habitual. Administrators and Faculty could initiate programs within the classrooms to maintain a physical security level that would offer students protection during crisis situations. Covert CCTV cameras should be placed in both inside and outside public areas, entryways and hallways, and in each classroom. The system should be able to be monitored from both the school's Intranet and the standard Internet using existing secure and pass worded software. This would allow selected Faculty and Administrative personnel, and most importantly, Campus Police to routinely check the Campus and public/classroom areas within the facility's buildings 24/7 from their homes or any other computer with the correct software and connected to the Internet. (Most police departments now have computers in their vehicles that would have that monitoring capability) This is a common and proven technique at a reasonable cost. By utilizing this system and software, one can provide a substantial increase in both a psychological and physical deterrent for any criminal acts, and drastically reduce response time for any criminal act in progress|`|khdFNlJ7aa	Give sympathy to bullies?

Sometimes those thoughts consume me, if it is a situation I can't change. Lately though, when it used to be something I didn't give much thought to, I've actually become very aware of it. And by being aware my anger has reached a level I'm thinking things I shouldn't think, I'm better able to control myself, and make sure the words aren't even formed in my mind. I'm able to instead think rationally, instead out of anger.<br>  <br>  I don't know if being angry at those who deserve it is necessarily haraam, but I know it isn't good to allow anger to consume us, and while controlling it is not easy it has helped me. Both in the way I see myself, as well as the way I view others and the situations we are in.<br>  <br>  Actually, though I hate to admit it, I've found that I get angry more often than I used to think as well. Or, I make snide comments in my mind when it really isn't necessary or beneficial in any way. Those too are slowly being morphed into more rational thoughts.<br>  <br>  I have started to think about all of it in this way. When it comes to those who have earned my dislike or anger... I try to keep in mind that I am flawed as well, and if I can't learn to look past the flaws of others, I really have little right to ask God that I be forgiven for mine.<br>  <br>  If I look at it from that perspective, it is easier to start to change.|`|K5nwQfnjaa	I need to stop doing a lot of things, I am currently working on it.|`|QvF8dR7Taa	getting a speeding ticket,and yes it was hard to not go fast

I'm sure you'll give some booty any ways after all that.|`|8m6fJ6cXaa	Something special...  What is his favorite thing that he likes to do but you don't necessary like to do.  Maybe showing him interest in what that is will just do the trick...|`|w6vGajYjaa	Cook his favorite meal? I know that would do it for me.|`|88bDvyiwaa	I wish I had a wife like you.|`|DvZdB66maa	I'm not a man, but I just did something for my hubby a couple weeks ago that he really appreciated!<br>  <br>  I got a hotel suite with a kitchen and sitting area. And, first, I cooked him a nice man-friendly meal, and I played some nice music while we ate by candlelight. I gave him a love letter that I wrote about my feelings for him. Men like to be complimented and get ego-boosts, so that always helps. Then, I told him to go lay down while I prepared some stuff. I have this really good recipe for a therapeutic facial that I got on the Internet, and I gave him a facial. (Men, you may think this sounds too "girly," but if you actually had a facial, it is soooo relaxing, and my husband LOVED it). I had soft candlelights and I was playing this CD with sounds of beach waves and soft music while I gave him his facial... and then I gave him a massage with nice-smelling Indian oils, still playing that same CD. Needless to say, he fell asleep during the facial and massage. That's how relaxed he was.<br>  <br>  But he woke up like 10 minutes later. I put on another CD with some romantic R&B songs like R. Kelly, Joe, and others. I put on some lingerie, and took it from there. Basically, I just made the whole night about pampering him. Of course, you can add your own variations, like some others said... like watching a good movie together, getting him a nice gift that you know he will appreciate, or giving him a break from his hectic life by taking care of something for him that would normally be a burden on him. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.<br>  <br>  Edit: I had planned for us to lounge in a hot tub with wine and chocolate dipped strawberries after the massage, but the room didn't end up having the hot tub like I thought it would. We still drank the wine and ate the chocolate dipped strawberries though. (I made them myself... melt chocolate chips in a small saucer with a Tbsp. of oil. Immediately dip the end of the strawberries in and then refrigerate. The chocolate doesn't take long to harden).|`|TrmGBloHaa	if you really wana have soem fun.<br>  <br>   Invite some of your close friends and throw a suprise party for him,, ,there have to be no reason, you cna say just a friends re union.<br>  <br>   order some good food and have soem drinks with a good music will work. it will stress him out <br>  <br>  ------- and u will get rewarded in bed ..

I am South Indian"<br>  <br>  I didn't bother asking what he meant by it because he seemed a little offended after that.<br>  <br>  But I believe they have some sort of connection.<br>  <br>  PS Can I also mention the fact that all south Asians "Indians, Bengalis, Sri Lankans, Pakistanis" etc have Aboriginal ancestry.<br>  Aboriginals are originally from Australia but within time a part of Australia got detached and it was floating on the sea.. then within time it hit Asia causing there to be a big mountain which we now call mt Everest.<br>  <br>  Just a piece of info I thought may be useful :-)|`|238ca7113ff45c9c845ea02e21b7356faa	I have seen some ppl made a question like this long time ago. there are  good links on that topic showing  east indian ppl are the relatives of the east african ppl. take a look at aishwarya rai.

My close kith and kin are together fairly often and we do put forth an effort to make it this way. My Dad was very conscious of family and always welcomed everyone. I suppose his example and that of many in my family in the past generation has been adopted by my generation.  We hope to pass this feeling down to the next generation and instill the importance of family to future generations.

They have.|`|XEbrGfZuaa	I haven't seen our son and his oldest son, in about 17 years. And that's<br>  the way he wants it. I also have never met his youngest son, and I<br>  never will. He's distanced himself, due to being in the JW's. <br>     I also haven't seen any of my aunts' children since my mothers'<br>  funeral, and probably won't again. I am the oldest in the extended<br>  family. And I doubt they'll even hear about my passing. They've been<br>  out of touch so long, that there are no addresses for them. When my<br>  aunts were still alive, they were in contact often, and told the news<br>  in their immediate family. Without their news, I wouldn't have learned<br>  things from long ago. The cousins always lived great distances, so<br>  we rarely saw each other. And the same goes today. I understand,<br>  that two sisters, don't see their brother, due to his wife. And his mom<br>  witheld him from her will, due to his wife. She tried to act better than<br>  members of his family. So she's always been resented by them.<br>     I haven't seen one of my sisters since my mothers funeral in the<br>  early 90's. But the other sister, her twin, I saw last September, when<br>  she took me to dinner for my birthday. But before that, it had been<br>  six years, since I'd seen her.<br>     I envy families that were raised to be close to each other. As in<br>  old age, every family member begins to count, just a little bit more.<br>  And it can be a lonely life, without family in it.
PmDyqmMBaa	Major doesn't exist in Spanish. Mayor means "Older"..<br>  <br>  Tomar : " take"  in some cases it's a synonym of BEBER<br>  <br>  Example:<br>  <br>  **Voy a tomarme un vaso con agua porque tengo Hipo<br>  I'm going to drink a glass of  water because I have Hiccups<br>  <br>  +Tomaré un vaso con agua para curar el hipo que tengo<br>  I will drink a glass of water to cure Hiccups that I got<br>  <br>  <br>  Comer : EAT|`|JIG9QXBeaa	There is not a word in spanish called major,only mayor,and thats right,means older<br>  About tomar,it can be an object,food or drinks<br>  Toma esto - Take this<br>  Tomare una bebida - I′ll take a drink<br>  <br>  And... comer is for food,beber for drinks|`|Q8qL3m3eaa	As far as im aware major doesnt mean older. You might be thinking of mejor, which means better.<br>  <br>  And as for tomar, tomar only means to take, and in some cases, to drink. Not really to eat.

YYwy9MQraa	Boy are you confused!<br>  <br>  People born transsexual can be straight, gay/lesbian, bi or asexual just like everyone else.<br>  <br>  Contrary to what you believe there are men who are secure enough in their identity to appreciate my womanhood, even if you can't.  And other than giving birth I have the same "abilities" as other women. :sticks tongue out:<br>  <br>  I've seen a lot of your questions and how you like to spread misinformation.  Well I'm here to tell you that you are wrong AGAIN.|`|OsY0lmTCaa	Untrue. A woman is a woman no matter what an accident of birth made her look like. Whether cisgendered or transgendered, she's still a girl and worthy of the life that she wants for herself.<br>  <br>  A mind is a terrible thing to close<br>  <br>  EDIT: Diane, one correction. A straight woman might still be interested in a gay man. It happens. Other than that, I think you did one hell of a good job breaking down simple math for the first graders reading our answers!|`|V5lxDoIRaa	Lets See I think this is the third or is it the fourth time this week this has been asked. <br>  <br>  A TRANSWOMAN IS A WOMAN<br>  HE IS STRAIGHT <br>  <br>  <br>  I am a woman who was also born a transsexual|`|jgupC7oMaa	Holy Crap!

That is first thing you should probably look up because it's obvious looking at your question.<br>  <br>  A heterosexual man, or straight man in lay man terms, is not homosexual, or gay in lay man terms, if he is attracted to women. Transwomen who are post-op, meaning they have had Sex Reassignment Surgery (SRS), are considered women in many eyes.<br>  <br>  However there are those who are transphobic and homophobic and still think lowly of transwomen.<br>  <br>  Let me put it in your terms: If a straight guy likes a woman but that woman is actually a transwoman, he's still straight. The straight guy liked the woman because she appeared to be a woman.|`|Vrc13ExVaa	They don't necessarily like or dislike transfemales.<br>  <br>  The truth is, being transgendered has to be looked at as separate from your orientation or preferences.<br>  <br>  A transgendered male-to-female person shouldn't really be thought as just a transgendered person-- from birth, their mind has been psychologically that of a woman. They are a woman, their body was/is not. From there, they are either gay or bi or straight, or perhaps not clearly any of those things (some people don't identify clearly with specific gender or orientation). <br>  <br>  For example, a male-to-female transgendered person who likes men is, basically, straight.<br>  <br>  A male-to-female transgendered person who likes women is, basically, gay. Perhaps not physically, but still, the gender they are psychologically is what you base the orientation off of because they truly /are/ that gender.<br>  <br>  They may have been intersexed from birth or just born with, essentially, the wrong body, but a transfemale will say, "I am a woman." Why? Because they are!<br>  <br>  So no, you're not right. A transfemale (man-to-woman) /is/ a woman, but her body was not when /she/ was born. <br>  <br>  So really, it depends. You don't necessarily have to be transgendered or even gay to like transgendered people, although you might call yourself "queer" (sort of a vague term pertaining to anything that's not the norm). A straight guy, for example, can think a transfemale is sexy without being gay, as a transfemale is /actually a woman/.<br>  <br>  It's a preference, that's what it comes down to. Some people even like transfemales who look like women, but still have male reproductive parts.<br>  <br>  So you can't generalize and say "so-and-so is gay because he likes transgendered women"-- that's not what transgendered even means.<br>  <br>  I hope you understand what I'm saying. If you need clarification, you should click around on wikipedia to learn the basics.<br>  <br>  <br>  And transgendered people don't have an illness or traumatic incident that made them this way. My transgendered friend, for example, was hit by a car in his teens and there's a rumor that this caused him to be transgendered. But that's rumor, hearsay, they fail to understand that he's been transgendered for his entire life, and got cause/effect mixed up, as well as the timeline... pathetic logic if you ask me, born from lack of understanding. A lot of people genuinely /do not know/. <br>  <br>  It's not a delusion, or a phase.|`|KnTrvQd6aa	My word, how original.<br>  <br>  For reference; a trans woman is a WOMAN.<br>  <br>   A straight man would be interested in her because she's a WOMAN, and he's straight; he likes WOMEN,and not MEN.<br>  <br>  A transwoman would be interested in a straight man because she's a WOMAN, and she likes MEN (Unless she's lesbian, in which case she would be interested in a WOMAN).<br>  <br>  A gay man would NOT be interested in a trans woman because she's a WOMAN, and he's gay;he likes MEN and not WOMEN.<br>  <br>  A transwoman would not be interested in a gay man because she's a WOMAN, and not a MAN.<br>  <br>  Clear enough for you?|`|le9ZROs5aa	Oma Gosh!

0a0df8302296db03c2c6cf8fadc13928aa	Hola Solci!<br>  Pues... no cabe duda que en nuestra sociedad actual estamos condenados a ser un poco "salmones", es decir, a nadar contracorriente, con todo lo que ello implica. En algunos medios,la solidaridad, la tolerancia y el respeto están en "vía de extinción" para darle paso a la implantación de la "ley del mas fuerte" o del mas poderoso. Así que muy probablemente se nos vea como bichos raros. Pero sabes? pienso que la verdadera misión de cada uno como persona en este sentido empieza cuando decidimos responsable y libremente ser padres o madres (lo cual no quiere decir que no debamos ya desde antes trabajar duro para crecer interiormente). He ahí un buen comienzo, porque quieras que no, el tener hijos nos exige un ejercicio de coherencia diario, porque no podemos pretender una mejor sociedad para nuestros hij@s si no inculcamos en ellos los valores necesarios para producir ese cambio de pensamiento. Porque bien que se dice: "La palabra EDUCA, pero el ejemplo ARRASTRA".<br>  Saludos y... gracias por hacernos reflexionar con tu pregunta =D|`|c7bda04f18bbd655fb12a982db964707aa	Tratando de mirar mas allá de nuestras narices y ayudar al prójimo no ser egoísta y no jugar al que me importa  ----|`|0ab6eb494d82c7f03321765acb97ba3faa	siendo unidos todos..TODOS.. sin desigualdad para nadie|`|34e8bee156d5a249cc4280e49dd2d522aa	Respetandote primero a ti misma y luego a tus semejantes.Seria un gran inicio hacia el mejoramiento de todos.<br>  saluditos|`|9e93f79fab4edaec6f6c8764d986a9d9aa	Muy sencillo: No estorbes.|`|b1278547da41c5fd1e135989cb56153baa	procurando  pensar, que nada nos pertenece, que la vida  que vivimos es una sola,y debemos hacer un buen uso de ese regalo "divino" con que fuimos obsequiados....tratando de conocernos a nosotros mismos,corrigiendo nuestras faltas cada día, pensar en EL que esta al lado nuestro,regalar afecto, sonrisas, ayudar al necesitado, a nuestros amigos y parientes,decirle a nuestros seres queridos !cuanto los amamos! y lo felices que somos de tenerlos con nosotros, pensando , que de nada sirve nuestra VIDA !si no  la ponemos al servicio de los demás!|`|0e20e217469760bb959d2b6530d2bc5aaa	Ayudando lo mas que se pueda a la gente que lo necesita... yo creo que la mejor ayuda es la espiritual...!<br>  Aquí te mando una parte de una de mis canciones que me gusta decicársela a toda esa gente que se siente triste y abatida:|`|22f404958bb94fe71588ab71f9bb8a38aa	Proponiendonoslo y recuperando los valores perdídos ,empezando por nosotros mismos ,teniendo la voluntad de hacerlo y no decaer ,el amor es mas fuerte.<br>  Lo que pasa es que la bondad no cotiza en bolsa ,pero es lo que todos quisieran tener a su lado,nada mas siguen las reglas de mercado,donde el materialismo y la sofistiquería ,les venden la panacéa de la felicidad,sin darse cuenta que desarrollan un egoísmo a ultranza,superlativo,lo que las convierte ,en peores personas.|`|69b61a0f1abc63561667af7ee18819c3aa	dejando el egoismo,amando a las personas como si fueran nuestros hermanos y dominar nuestro genio para que haya paz <br>  en cada momento|`|6abbbdb2ab0f82a9299c493e975b6f88aa	La biblia nos da consejo de esto.

So no worries. =)|`|aRaMjnQ1aa	When they were married, the Prophet was 25 years old, and Khadijah was 40. Yet, that did not bother the Prophet one bit. He loved her so deeply, and she loved him as deeply. They were married for 25 years, and she bore him seven children: 3 sons and 4 daughters. All of the sons died in young age. Khadijah was a source of immense love, strength, and comfort for the Prophet Muhammad, and he leaned heavily on this love and support on the most important night of his life. <br>  <br>  While he was meditating in cave of Hira, the Angel Gabriel came to the Prophet Muhammad and revealed to him the first verses of the Qur'an and declared to him that he was to be a Prophet. The experience terrified the Prophet Muhammad, and he ran home, jumping into Khadijah's arms crying, "Cover me! Cover me!" She was startled by his terror, and after soothing and comforting him for a while, the Prophet was able to calm down and relate to her his experience.<br>  <br>  The Prophet feared he was losing his mind or being possessed. <br>  <br>  Khadijah put all his fears to rest: "Do not worry," she said, "for by Him who has dominion over Khadijah's soul, I hope that you are the Prophet of this nation. Allah would never humiliate you, for you are good to your relatives, you are true to your word, you help those who are in need, you support the weak, you feed the guest and you answer the call of those who are in distress." She then took him to her cousin, Waraqah ibn Nawfal - a scholar well-versed in the Judeo-Christian scripture - and he confirmed to the Prophet that his experience was Divine and he was to be the Last Prophet. <br>  <br>  After his ministry began, and the opposition of his people became harsh and brutal, Khadijah was always there to support the Prophet Muhammad, sacrificing all of her wealth to support the cause of Islam. When the Prophet and his family were banished to the hills outside of Mecca, she went there with him, and the three years of hardship and deprivation eventually led to her death. The Prophet Muhammad mourned her deeply, and even after her death, the Prophet would send food and support to Khadijah's friends and relatives, out of love for his first wife. <br>  <br>  Once, years after Khadijah died, he came across a necklace that she once wore. When he saw it, he remembered her and began to cry and mourn. His love for her never died, so much so, that his later wife A'isha became jealous of her. Once she asked the Prophet if Khadijah had been the only woman worthy of his love. The Prophet replied: "She believed in me when no one else did; she accepted Islam when people rejected me; and she helped and comforted me when there was no one else to lend me a helping hand." <br>  <br>  Much has been made and said about Prophet Muhammad's multiple marriages. There are many who smear the Prophet as a womanizing philanderer, citing his multiple marriages. This is absolute propaganda. As a response to those who malign the Prophet, as if the Prophet were anything of the sort, he would have taken advantage of his youth to do such a thing. But he did not! At a time when it was a common custom to have multiple wives, the Prophet did not marry anyone else while he was with Khadijah.<br>  It was only after Khadijah died, may God be pleased with her, that he married other women. Most of these wives were widows, whom the Prophet married to care after them, or they were the daughters of prominent Arab chieftains, so that the Prophet could form a cohesive Muslim society out of a fiercely tribalistic (and barbaric) Arab culture. The smears against the Prophet fall flat on their faces once the light of truth shines brightly upon them|`|QxtdyNvgaa	whatever your question is i hope your not making fun of islam and muslims.<br>  i am a muslim and i do not wish to be insulted.<br>  peace...............

And as you desire that men should do to you, you do also to them likewise. For if you love those who love you, what thanks do you have? For sinners also love those who love them. And if you do good to those who do good to you, what thanks do you have? For sinners also do the same. And if you lend to those of whom you hope to receive, what thanks do you have? For sinners also lend to sinners, to receive as much again. But love your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing in return. And your reward shall be great, and you shall be the sons of the Highest. For He is kind to the unthankful and to the evil. Therefore be merciful, even as your Father is merciful.

The children would go out in costume to your house and by their scary presence would scare away the imps so they would not harrass your house, as a fee you give them food(dried meats,breads,etc.,) or coin. which the poor used to carry through the winter. <br>  So the evil costumes of today have nothing to do with the devil and more with scarying away evil spirits.<br>  <br>  And remember Halloween is a "Christian holiday" as Sacred as any other Catholic holiday and not a evil one.|`|1d4b6bea29e89b5ef8f904278d4c19f0aa	I remember a Little House on the Prarie episode where the ne'er do-well Trick or Treaters soaped up the windows of some poor, unsuspecting homeowners.

They were located in what is now the United Kingdom, much of Western Europe and an isolated enclave in what is now Turkey. They held a major celebration near the end of our month of October, which they called called "Samhain", a festival to recognize the end of summer.  <br>  <br>  (The story that "Samhain" was a Celtic God of the Dead is a myth. However, it has been repeated so often by conservative Christian and secular sources that it has taken on a life of its own.)<br>  <br>  The Celts believed that the veil between this world and the next was thinnest at this time of year. Friends and relatives who had died would often return, with their souls inhabiting an animal - often a black cat. Black cats have remained a symbol of Halloween down to the present time. <br>  I<br>  n celebration of the recently completed harvest, Celts would give offerings of food to the Gods. **They often went from door to door to collect food to donate to their deities. Also, young Celts would ask the townspeople for kindling and wood, and take it to top of the hill for the Samhain bonfire. These are two of the possible origins of present day "trick or treating." **<br>  <br>  Samhain was a fire festival. Sacred bonfires were lit on the tops of hills in honor of the Gods. The townspeople would take an ember from the bonfire to their home and re-light the fire in their family hearth. The ember would usually be carried in a holder - often a turnip or gourd. They felt nervous about walking home in the dark; they were afraid of evil spirits. So they dressed up in costumes and carved scary faces in their ember holders. They hoped that the spirits would be frightened and not bother them. <br>  <br>  Children continue to dress up today in various costumes. Pumpkins are now the objects of choice to carve faces into. <br>  <br>  Wiccans and some other Neopagans base their religious faith on the religion of the Celts. They continue to celebrate Samhain today.<br>  <br>  ______________________________________...<br>  <br>  To most people, Halloween is a fun holiday to dress up and eat candy. Well, even Pagans like to eat candy on Halloween, but we consider it to be a very important holiday in a more spiritual sense as well. <br>  <br>  The proper name for the occassion is Samhain (pronounced Sow-en or Sow-een). It's sometimes referred to as the Witches New Year, because our religious year starts/ends with Samhain. <br>  <br>  The holiday began being called "Halloween" because the Catholic church created All Saints Day (or All Hallows Day) on November 1st, in an attempt to turn people away from the original Pagan holiday. The night before became known as "All Hallows Eve", which then got shortened up to Halloween. <br>  If you are concerned about the Pagan nature of October 31st, then you should probably stop celebrating Christmas and Easter, too. <br>  <br>  Though those holidays have been thoroughly adopted by the Christian religion, they were both originally Pagan celebrations (Yule and Ostara). Halloween is the only holiday that has kept most of its Pagan meanings, without the Christian overtones. <br>  Many fundamentalist Christian groups stand against the celebration of Halloween because they feel it is associated with demons and Satan. Unfortunately, most (if not all) of their 'facts' are incorrect. <br>  <br>  The most common error, is that Halloween is celebrated to honour the Celtic God of the Dead, Samhain. The Celts had no such God. The word "Samhain" more likely came from "samhuinn", which is the Gaelic word for "summer's end". A fitting name, since that is precisely what this holiday is celebrating. <br>  <br>  There is nothing Satanic about Halloween, either in modern times, or in the early history of the festival. Of course, there is nothing Satanic about any aspects of Wicca, witchcraft or Paganism, but that's another story altogether. <br>  <br>  We don't celebrate black masses, conduct sacrifices or cast hexes on Halloween (or any other day!) <br>  <br>  So now you know what Halloween isn't, but what does Halloween mean? Well, to Pagans who celebrate Samhain, it is the third and last of the year's harvest festivals. The crops are in, and it's time to relax and prepare for the long winter ahead. Samhain is a time to reflect on the events of the past year, and to remember those who have passed away. It's at this time of the year that spirits travel from this world to the next. Both good and evil spirits. <br>  <br>  Part of the mythology of the holiday is that the God dies at Samhain, and the Goddess mourns Him until His rebirth at Yule. It is Her mourning that brings about the shorter, cold days of winter. After His birth at Yule, the days begin to get longer again. <br>  Many of the symbols and traditions that we see around Halloween today can be traced to earlier times.<br>  <br>   Carving of jack-o-lanterns probably started with turnips rather than pumpkins, but the idea is the same either way. With the spirits of the dead travelling on this day, people would carve faces into turnips (or gourds or whatever) in order to scare away any evil spirits. The dressing up in costumes was also done to scare off bad spirits. <br>  <br>  ***The idea of playing tricks was not done maliciously, but just as a way of having a bit of fun before the long dark winter settled in. The original gathering of treats was done to provide offerings to the Gods, in thanks for the harvest. ***<br>  <br>  Personally, I leave a candle lit in the window along with a food offering for the spirits that might pass my way. <br>  <br>  One last word. Many fundamentalist Christian groups have a strong negative bias towards any religion that is different from their own. Please keep this in mind when reading their websites for more 'truth' about Halloween.|`|cd7e49f4114515df35fa01170c3030c3aa	It started as a threat, give me a treat or I will do something (a trick) to you.

So people gave them treats (candy and cookies,fruit,sometimes even money) to go away and not do any harm.
AA10007676	One of the condition that Quran allows more than wife is that you treat them equally. These verse were originally revealed regarding orphans, when there were many in the society and polygamy was required to have these girls to get a married life.<br>  "If you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly with the orphans, Marry women of your choice, Two or three or four; but if you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly (with them), then only one" Quran 4: 3. <br>  <br>  But Quran also states in another place that it is very difficult to treat equally<br>  "You are never able to be fair and just as between wives, even if it is your ardent desire: " Quran 4:129. <br>  <br>  So there is an indirect reference to have only one wife but in rare circumstances more than one can be married. Sometimes when male population in a society is less than females, polygamy may be required to have all the women lead a family life.|`|49777b2169ba51a12afcba3cb37dd161aa	YOUR AVATAR IS BLACK&WHITE .. <br>  BUT ..

When the earth was young and under-populated, polygamy was one way of populating it and bringing in the human beings needed to carry out God's plan. By the time the Quran was revealed, the world had been sufficiently populated, and the Quran put down the first limitations against polygamy. In the Bible on te other hand polyagamy has no restrictions and being equitable to ones wife is not necessary (2 Samuel 5:13, 1 Kings 11:3,Genesis 4:19, Deuteronomy 21:15, Exodus 21:10 etc)<br>  Polygamy is permitted in the Quran, but under strictly observed circumstances. Any abuse of this divine permission incurs severe retribution. Thus, although polygamy is permitted by God, it behooves us to examine our circumstances carefully before saying that a particular polygamous relationship is permissible. Iti s only allowed in war for orphans.<br>  Polygamy is dicouraged in the Qur'an, it is only allowed in very restricted situations....if God had banned polygamy at once there would be mass poverty and homelessness would result as the 2nd,third, 4th, 5th, 6th etc wives were turned out of their homes.<br>  But the Qur'an reveals that God very strongly does not want polygamy in general....<br>  "If you fear lest you may not be perfectly equitable in <br>  treating more than one wife, then you shall be content with one." BUT...<br>  (4:3) "You cannot be equitable in a polygamous relationship, no matter how hard you try." (4:129)<br>  In todays world generally any polygamous marriage would be against the Qur'an and Islam as they are not marriages purely for a man who just wants another wife or thinks he can handle one...for this reason in most countries, such as the one I'm from (Australia), polygamy should be illegal as it is not needed and therefore not Qur'anic.|`|7c0b8d463941e2e4efdf88578930d8edaa	that's a good point. keep up the good work in dispelling religious ideas from people's heads.|`|AA10610643	throughout human history warfare has led to greater male casualties which explains why certain populations at certain times have become numerically female biased. these were the exact conditions which characterized the early days of islam when islam was under attack (and i dare say in iraq these days) so to rebuild the population and to allow a family life to all the extra women - this permission was given. but only if exactly equal treatment was given to each wife and no favouritism shown... yeh and no one ever forces the the women to marry...you can only have a max of four wives if wife number 2,3 and 4 wish it (and more importantly ALLOW it)...<br>  in other religions, if ever such a discrepancy in numbers arises, large numbers of women have to go celibate their entire lives, which are often marked with hardship.....in fact a drastic rise in prostitution and and begging is seen in most warzones by the female membners of the population left without suport after theiur male family members have perished in the fighting...(bosnia, sierra leone)<br>  the male orphans created are adopted, rehabilitated and married off and start their own families instead of multiple men marrying the same women...which would be unwieldy & become drain on resources by becoming the consumers instead of th prociders.....as men are primarily designed to provide...... whereas the female invests heavily in offspring production and care... i wudnt have expected you in all your mush-headed glory to possibly have worked that out fopr urself homo boy...|`|AA10867271	Keyser, you should have had 4 wives when you lived in Turkey.

Jews are 14,424 thousands which is 0.24% of the total.<br>  <br>  Muslim population is growing at the fastest rate  due to high birth rate among them  in Afro-Asian region and polygamy as allowed in the Quran.

Vou te passar uma sugest?o que já ouvi ter funcionado, no mesmo caso (namorado ca?ando tatu e namorada inconformada). Fa?a também. Quando você o ver fazendo, fa?a na mesma hora. Inclusive pode ser assim: comece a limpar o sal?o e pergunte alguma coisa que ele só pode responder te olhando nos olhos. Costuma ser tiro e queda. Se ele reclamar, retruque que se ele faz você também pode, e se ele acha horrível que você fa?a perto dele, diga que o reverso também é verdade. Geralmente acaba num acordo em que ele vai permitir que você o fiscalize e o reprima delicadamente. Agora se isso n?o der certo, há dois caminhos: desencane, assuma que n?o tem como mudar e o cara vai ser assim para sempre, ou mande o sujeito catar casquinha em outro lugar. Só n?o dá para ficar ali se remoendo sem falar nada, porque quem vai sofrer é você e pode até vir a desenvolver alguma doen?a estranha em idade mais avan?ada (tem muito caso de doen?a tipo cancer que pode ter origem psicológica, culpas e mágoas mal resolvidas, pelo menos assim ouvi falar).|`|93279987ebe8b592316465c4f682c196aa	Qnd ele enfiar o dedo no nariz da um tap?o com toda a for?a no cotovelo dele, assim, o dedo vai entrar o máximo possível e vai causar uma dor do k.cete, faz isso todas as vezes que pega-lo fazendo essa nojeira...acho q da 3a vez num passa...rs<br>  <br>  OBS.: Ele n?o p?e o dedo na boca depois né????<br>  <br>  cx|`|c52e9a832d7197715eae7e75334b47bbaa	Converse seriamente com ele.

3e34f165ad30f58bf7f1417310ff9c96aa	Most people have heard of Old Father Thames, but you may be wondering what Isis, the Egyptian goddess of magic, has to do with a river in England.<br>  <br>  The Thames is an ancient river and the origins of its name are lost in antiquity, but may derive from the Celtic words tam, meaning wide-spreading, and isa, meaning running water. The Celtic word for the Thames was Tamesis. However, as Peter Ackroyd suggests, the name could possibly be far older in origin, from the time of the primordial mesolithic tribes that wandered far and wide. The Sanskrit word tamasa means dark, in the sense of holy or sacred, and there are other rivers of the world with similar names, including the Tamasa, which is a tributary of the Ganges, the Temes in Hungary, the Tamese in Italy and also the Tamar in the UK.<br>  <br>  The Thames' has a well-known deity - Old Father Thames. He has long hair and a beard and is often depicted carrying a trident. He is a classic river god.<br>  <br>  However, the Eyptian goddess Isis has also been associated with the Thames.This is partly due to the old name for the Thames - Tamesis - and because a 14th century monk, Ranulphus Higden, described the river as being a combination of two tributaries, Thama and Ysa. Although this was probably just a version of the Celtic words mentioned earlier, historian John Leland in his Itinerary (1546) translated Ysa as Isis, and the connection with the Egyptian goddess grew from there.<br>  <br>  So, in myth and legend, the river Thames is governed by the union of the male and female deities Thames and Isis. It seems appropriate. Isis is a mother goddess and the benefactress of rivers. She is also a goddess of fertility. Roman effigies of her have been dredged from the waters near London Bridge.<br>  <br>  If modern pagans, who honour both male and female aspects in rituals, want to call upon the deities of London's ancient river, then Old Father Thames and Isis do seem appropriate.|`|dwfKo9rgaa	The Thames through Oxford was always called the Isis especially in victorian times from its source to Dorchester-on-Thames where the Isis met the Thame - over time by the 20th century this was shortened to Thames after being called Thame-Isis|`|YYbVDcw8aa	That's what they call it at Oxford. J.R.R.Tolkien and C.S.Lewis were known for calling it that.

Some people go without banana's at all, and they seem to be fine with it.  <br>  <br>  Also, I think it was Sigmund Froid that said "Sometimes a banana is just a banana."  OK, I made up the last bit...but you get the point.|`|tV5cBE0Waa	I've been wondering why God intelligently designed the banana to resemble the human penis.  Did we need more encouragement to eat it?

So instead of addressing it with her he ignored it.<br>  <br>  It would have been nice had he made her something or just wrote her a note telling her how he felt about her. But many guys, especially young guys probably feel intimidated by writing about their feelings.<br>  <br>  The real question here is. Has her boyfriends behavior changed recently? Is he still attentive and caring, or does it seem his interest in her is straying?<br>  <br>  If he is still attentive and caring then I am sure there is another reason for him not giving her a gift on Valentines Day.<br>  <br>  <br>  L|`|hyYWX82Eaa	I agree that (s)he needs to talk to him about it, in any relationship there are different levels of intimacy and romance, he may not realize that his partner was hurt by the lack of valentine presents.

While honesty with open communication is often the best route to go ... in this case, it might just be a little petty to blow it out of proportion. <br>  <br>  So an alternative might be for her to suggest that they plan a romantic date together, maybe with the casual but fleeting reference, "you know, since we didn't get to do anything special for Valentine's, I'm feeling a little bad I didn't make the day more special for you and us... how about this weekend we plan something together to make up for it?"<br>  <br>  It's a little game playing, but it's a little more polite than making a big deal of or holding resentment for.

JWjq5iaXaa	Very simply, The Angel of death is the personification of death... there is no one "Angel of Death", as it differs from culture to culture, the most popular being "The Grim Reaper".<br>  <br>  <br>  Germanic<br>  <a href="http://deusexeverriculum.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/odin-and-puppies.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://deusexeverriculum.files.wordpress...</a><br>  In Germanic folklore Death was a guise of Odin. The 'Grim' of Grim Reaper being derived from Grimnir, a name for Odin.<br>  <br>  Celtic<br>  <a href="http://nosferatuttiquanti.n.o.pic.centerblog.net/ookj3dd0.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://nosferatuttiquanti.n.o.pic.center...</a><br>  To the Welsh he is Angeu and Ankou to Bretons. He is regarded as a man in a hooded robe (invariably black) sometimes carrying a scythe.<br>  <br>  Slavic<br>  <br>  Old Slavic tribes viewed Death as a woman in white clothes, with a never-fading green sprout in her hand. The touch of the sprout would put a human to an everlasting sleep.<br>  <br>  This image survived well into the Middle Ages, only being replaced by the more traditional Western European image of a walking skeleton as late as in the 15th century.<br>  <br>  Baltic<br>  <br>  Lithuanians named Death Giltin?, deriving from word "gelti" (to sting). Giltin? was viewed as an old ugly woman with long blue nose and deadly poisonous tongue. The legend tells that Giltin? was young, pretty and communicative until she was trapped in a coffin for seven years. The goddess of Death was a sister of the goddess of Life and Destiny, Laima, symbolising the relationship between beginning and end.<br>  <br>  Later, Lithuanians adopted the classic Grim Reaper with a scythe and black robe.|`|GdXOjRNmaa	According to the Book of Revelations, the Angel of Death is a dark figure riding on a pale horse. He's meant to be dreadful.|`|t6sDVUI4aa	I have heard stories of him as either a dark figure on a pale horse. I have also heard of him as a gentle old man. So it really depends on what culture you are talking about.|`|GPmBB0Mvaa	Black angel. Black wings and everything.

8yaYafBAaa	Salamualaycom,<br>  At yesterdays jummah khutba the grand mufti was talking about mulid al nabi, He said contrary to belief the prophet Muhammad pbuh did celebrate his mulid, The prophet pbuh type of celebration was through worship, the prophet pbuh stayed up reading Qu'ran and prayed all night as a thanks for Allah swt for the blessing of his birth. The mufti also quoted several bukari hadiths supporting this.|`|Wn0nwNFjaa	Why is there no fun allowed in Islam? The Prophet's birthday is a public holiday in Islamic countries and is a day of celebration. Basing hard line Islam on hadiths that may or may not be correct is not fair. Islam should be based entirely on the Koran. In the Gulf States and Iran there are many holidays and celebrations. Islam must be fun for children, if not the fear of hell alone is not enough to keep them in the faith, especially those who are immigrants in western countries.|`|dAcNaajsaa	To celebrate the birthday of the Prophet by taking one day and making it as an act of worship etc has been clearly shown to be against the way of the Prophet, his sahaba/companions and the salaf and the righteous muslims and the respected scholars of islam throughout islamic history.<br>  <br>  These people from whom we learn islam did NOT celebrate the birthday of the prophet in the innovated ways nowadays.<br>  <br>  If the Prophet did not celebrate his own birthday ion such innovated ways nor did his sahaba, then who are we to start doing that ??<br>  <br>  islam came from them, not us.<br>  <br>  I suggest you reseacrh this issue. Try islamqa.com or a general search on yahoo etc looking for proofs and setting aside your desires. <br>  <br>  If you mislead others, like the good people at the islamic school, YOU will be held responsible by ALLAAH for leading them into such innovated practices and you will be punished by Allaah.<br>  <br>  Cosider my advice seriously now, because it will be too late on the Day of Judgement when you would have wished you had taken this advice and researched this issue and done what Allaah loved best, not what we think is right.<br>  <br>  The Prophet came to teach us the Qur'aan and purify us and teach us how to live etc, and that is what we should do if we love Allaah and if we love the prophet !!! Not make up some days and celebrate his birthday and so on !!!<br>  <br>  If you love Allaah, follow what the Prophet did !!! Simple. Whatever the prophet did not do, stay away from that !! whatever is haraam, stay away from that.<br>  <br>  Wassalaamu alaykum<br>  <br>  EDITED<br>  <br>  AT MRS BEWISK BELOW ME,<br>  <br>  Islam comes from Allaah, not from you. If you have a problem with it, take it up with Allaah. We are only simple people who have been created from sperm by Allaah and so we humbly try to follow what our Lord has revealed. if you think you know what is better than our Lord, then i suggest you consider your position on the day when you stand before him and answer to him why you decided to try to challenge the truth God revealed.<br>  <br>  Islam comes from him, not from you. If you don't like this, it is your problem.

DfDss68haa	It is not so much about the watermelons as the idea that black people STOLE the watermelons.

JWjq5iaXaa	The very reason zombies are considered zombies is the fact that they were once human, they once had the ability to do everything we can do as living humans. Due to disease and destruction of key parts of the brain, the "zombie" is unable to think logically and has the attention span of a starving, rabies-infested wolf. It does whatever it can do to attack its prey without the use of strategical or logical thinking... meaning sprinting, biting, arm-flailing at, and tackling its prey, but nothing more logical than that.<br>  <br>  *edit*<br>  buffywaldie, chill.

JWjq5iaXaa	Oh, #3 no question... well actually, it depends on the situation.<br>  <br>  To be simple, let's take 4 things into consideration...<br>  <br>  -Number of Zombies<br>  -Weapons available<br>  -Position<br>  -State of Mind<br>  <br>  The number of zombies plays a huge role... If there were thousands and the whole world were taken by them, #1 means we're screwed. #2 means we're screwed unless we've got an army. #3 means we've got a chance, if we take re-occupation slow and let the masses die of starvation.<br>  <br>  If you've got loaded APCs w/ manned railguns at hand, you can deal with #2 and #3 easily, and maybe even #1 with ease. But if you're dealing with a rusty shaving-razor-on-a-stick, #3 will pose as a threat, #2 will be pretty hard, #1 will pwn and rape.<br>  <br>  Where you have made base is a huge factor, as well. With a proper base, you can deal with any of the three.... unless you're planning on fighting back. Then, you could only take on #2 and #3. With a minor little base, good luck with defending yourself against #2. With no base whatsoever, you're lucky if you could survive #3 for longer than a week.<br>  <br>  However you react to the zombies could influence the outcome of your situation. If you're completely freaking out, you're screwed, no matter which kind you fought. If you're freaking out, but prepared, you could probably take #1 or #2, #3 would be too fast to shoot with a shaky hand. If you're calm, but not prepared, you're only good against #3... If you're calm AND prepared, you're ready to take #1, #2, and #3. Let's just see how successful you are...   :)<br>  <br>  So it all really depends... but I'd most likely say #1 is the hardest, #3 is the easiest, but it really depends. #1 could be the easiest if you're not fighting back... #2 could be easier than #3 if you had a strong enough weapon, considering they move slower. #3's the easiest if you're not prepared but calm.|`|tL5vlITcaa	2>3>1|`|dzfArr3daa	Number 2 is my first choice they seem more realistic it could be caused by some disease it may be treatable and be able to be wiped out.<br>  <br>  <br>  Number 1 is the least realistic these zombie would have to be caused by magic or something ,there would be no cure but maybe an incantation could stop them.<br>  <br>  the zombies from left for dead would be hard to escape i'd rather not go up against these even though there easier to kill.|`|QVWwls11aa	Why do you ALWAYS ask about zombies?????????????????????

g6Z1CZr7aa	Salam. There is no Muslim culture, there are Muslims from all over the world, they don't all live like we do over here, I guess you mean Arab culture. We don't have to cover our eyes and faces, in Islam thats not compulsory, but some people choose to... people argue about whether the hijab is compulsory or not, according to the Qur'an, but we (Muslims) do all agree that the face veil isn't, and neither is covering the hands. How do we speak through a screen to guests...? Sorry I didn't get that part, but as for the guests thing... usually when its men coming over, females don't sit with them or eat with them.. usually men and women are separated but that depends on the family, and how strict they are. Muslim men can see other female family members.. but they're not going to sit around with them, plus the females stay with the other women, like I said. When there are male relatives who aren't our brothers or our father and grandfathers, we must cover infront of them (as in wear the veil) but its not like we don't ever see them or talk to them. This is how we're suppose to be modest and be respectful to our family guests, yeah. Over here, we don't tend to mix alot, its not seen as right - its not a sin or anything lol, its just us wanting to appear respectful. Modesty is very important to us as Muslims so, you know. Most people are like that like at lunch or something, men don't sit with women, but this isn't something you can say happens in every household. We do sit and chat with our families, male and female together but we do have limits where we want to not go too far, and later the men would leave to another part of the house and chat, while women stay together with other women and the children. A Muslim man, when infront of his brothers wife, usually here they greet each other and chat, but not when they're alone, and they don't touch or anything, and yes she must be covered too. Also Muslim men, when they are with extended cousins who are female, the females would usually be covered too. Like I said, Muslim women usually only uncover infront of very close male relatives, like the fathers, husbands and brothers. She can uncover infront of any female relative and children who have not yet reached puberty. Thats how it usually is here anyway, I don't think its like that with every other Muslim in other parts of the world. Anyway I think i made my point :p Salam :)|`|pnZssBg9aa	I'm not Muslim, but I have read and heard about some Muslim practices. Apparently the women are covered heavily because men might be tempted with lust if they are exposed, even if it was their thigh or leg or face.<br>  Muslim men can have as many as four wives but it is not obligatory. After marriage, a Muslim woman is automatically a part of the man's household (I don't want to use the word 'property'). It is a duty of the Muslim man to be in charge and protective of his household. The screen is to keep the woman from revealing herself to guests because this may induce an inappropriate relationship with the guests if they saw her (even if it was just a glance at her face or figure) because they don't want the guests to be tempted sexually.<br>  All these practices are to maintain faithfulness and loyalty of the Muslim woman to her husband.<br>  Yes, close relatives can see them but not to the extent of revealing unncessary body parts. That is why close male relatives are allowed to accompany the women when going out to certain public places like a bank.|`|K3TQT2rNaa	I'm not entirely sure, but when I was in kindergarten my best friend had moved from somewhere over there (I don't remember where because we were 6) and she told me that she had never seen a man other than her father before they came here.  <br>  Also, if anyone knows the answer to his question, can women be unveiled if they are alone with other women who are not related to them?

Punjabis and pakistanis - Man and woman dress are looks same, In southern India woman - saree - man dhoti , Arabs - same man - full dress with scarf like in their head - woman same full cover and scarf ( the reason behind is whenever there is sand strom then they can very easily cover their faces) like that only. In islam it never ever says to cover woman face. saudi arabia means it's saudi culture and don't take it as a muslim culture.<br>  About 4 wifes - every one is understanding in wrong ways . Islam never say to marry 4 wifes - it's restricted to marry maximum 4 wifes. again , the quran came to us nearly 1500 yrs before and no civilizations act at that time.only welthy or healty ( strong) man were crab the woman and others fighting to get. so some one had many wifes ( even the marriage also streamed in islam only ) and many had nothing. so the Islam restrict to have maximum of 4 wifes and also all should have equal rights.that's all don't think islam teach us to marry 4 .<br>  islam protects the woman and minimized the illegal relations by what u are all discussed about women - men separate meetings etc etc.

I have decided to use information from tsroadmap.com but many things need to be changed around for me because I have different plans in life than the author did.<br>  <br>  I suggest using that site. If you're still curious, I personally would start with HRT (Hormone Replacement Therapy). You eventually need to start it; either right after or right before SRS (Sex Reassignment Surgery), or very early in order to see if your breast development is suited to your desire. If it isn't suited to your desire, you then know you need to do some breast implants. Facial hair removal (FHR) is usually followed up with HRT or before SRS. However I have heard of very few cases that have FHR after SRS. I don't suggest that though. SRS is the last thing many transwomen (I can't say so for transmen) do. It's irreversible so you have to be sure after going through all of the previous steps (HRT, FHR, breast implants if needed, living as a woman (and as a transwoman in our world)).|`|KnTrvQd6aa	Well, wherever you are, you start with your GP/family doctor.<br>  Tell him that you think you might be transsexual, and ask him to refer you to a psychiatrist.<br>  If the psychiatrist agrees that you are, or may be, transsexual, he will refer you to a Gender specialist, who can help you obtain counselling, hormone therapy, and surgery, as appropriate.<br>  <br>  If you can't find a support group near you, you might want to consider an online support group; there are a few good ones on Yahoo Groups.|`|V5lxDoIRaa	You would be wise to listen to Radgal and use the links she has provided for you.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  A Woman Who Was Born Transsexual|`|2anFE839aa	I don't know but i'm thinking about having it done

WPratgUYaa	As Belie said, you really should use formal spoken Japanese with your sensei / 先生. Anyone who is your senpai / 先輩 (superior/senior) should be addressed formally at all times. Only with close friends on an equal level should you use informal Japanese and the plain form.<br>  <br>  However, I do know that in some classroom situations (when teaching Japanese to "gaijin" / 外人 ("foreigners"), to practice plain form or for a less "Japanese" and more "casual" classroom setting, the informal plain form would be used.<br>  <br>  The only thing to go by is listen to a question or how you are addressed by your sensei. If he/she uses the polite form, you should always use the polite form back. If they speak in the plain form, you should speak in the plain form.<br>  <br>  Play it safe and use the polite form, even if others are using the plain form.

f02c05c20a32eef69459d1df6e529db3aa	I think some of the answers confirm your argument. There seems to be ignorance of the difference between the theory of evolution and the fact of evolution. That evolutionary change in species occurs is definitely not in question-there is no doubt whatsoever based on the extensive fossil record and physiological similarities between species-so those who make a blanket statement about evolution not being a fact are talking rubbish. Only the theory-the mechanisms involved are subject to any conjecture although there is no competing theory to challenge natural selection so that is accepted as fact by 99% of biologists. Creationism has nothing to contribute to science. It can be dismissed out of hand as irrelevant.|`|0fa7a57282521e79beb8d78571a64f9eaa	This dude above me ^^^^ is another example of a christian who doesn't even know what evolution teaches.  <br>  <br>  It doesn't say we came from monkeys.

Well, it couldn't 'evolve'. So, it HAD to be created, by a superior being that could create life. That superior being is God. And that Superior Being, God, told us His story, in a book called The Bible. And He sent His Son, Jesus, to die for our sins.<br>  <br>  See, your so-called theory/guess, falls apart because it can't take into account how life started, but our faith can.|`|543d9800859cd571453b217b91116744aa	What do you think about the Christian writings of Teilhard de Chardin, who allows for the possibility that God works through evolution?|`|AA10585946	I have been studying Science for the last 10 years <br>  and as for the Theory of Evolution, it is Just that a Theory.<br>  it is basiically like trying to guess what a picture is by only looking at less than one percent of the whole picture.<br>  There are millions of species alive today, and many more species have gone extinct over the history of this planet. also out of the billions of single life forms that have lived on this planet very few Fossils have actually been discovered.(this is the <1%)<br>  these fossils that have been discovered have been used to map out a Theory of Evolution composed of Plateus (rungs of a ladder or steps on a staircase, but with nothing connecting the steps or rungs together) of species. but there are no fossils that have been found that are between these Plateus. for the Theory to ever become a Fact what is reqired is to find fossils that clearly show the change of one species into another (rope, rope-ladder(rungs), or chain of fossil evidence, when graphed will show a slope with horizontal flat sections) or for some currently living animal to give birth to something that is unable to reproduce with the Mother species but is able to reproduce with one that is identical to it. <br>  <br>  An Evolutionary-Mutation would be fertile,but would have a completely different Genome from the Parent Species, unlike a normal mutation which damages the genetic code leaving the child infertile or with severe birth defects that ussually end in death, example is a mule which is the cross between a donkey and a horse. though it is similar to the parent species it is unable to reproduce with either species or with other crosses. it is there fore infertile and there for it is a mutation and is not considered a new species.<br>  <br>  Many people have tried to claim that the Finches of Galapagos Island and other areas of the world are able to evolve. this is not the case all it is is a case of special specialization. it is simply a case of rececive genes taking dominance through variences in food availability. (the differences noticed in the Finches have been beak sizes and shapes).<br>  <br>  As food availability changes the finches that have the genes which will enable them to make the best use of the available foods will gain dominance over those finches whose beak genes are specialized toward the food that is out of season or no longer available. there fore the average shape of the beaks will change over time in acordance to what food is readily available. <br>  <br>  The finches have not changed species thay have just become specialized within their species. this can also cause some Genes to become extinct within a Species or Race. this is why "Race" could even be concidered to exist. Can make the Species Stronger or weaker based on what genes are lost over time.<br>  <br>  On the other hand if the finches were no longer able to reproduce with the parent species but were only able to reproduce with other finches with the same beak size and shape then that Would mean that they had undergone Evolutionary-Mutation.<br>  But this could only be tested in a Labratory under Precice Conditions.|`|a937d2a07b4e33ee20c61ba4864ad6ffaa	How can you who accepts evolution not accept creation?

I know what evolution states, first thing, Natural Selection only weeds our genetically weak individuals leaving, creatures with good genes. It can NEVER add any base pairs or nucleotides to the genetic sequence of an organism. Also do you know about microevolution, and how evolutions have just used misleading terminology, for the term variation.<br>  <br>  Also through thousands of experiments on fruit flies and other species, (E. Coli), no one has been able to produce a "Positive Mutation".<br>  <br>  Also how evolutionists use their imagination, to say that selection drift, would create a new species?<br>  <br>  Even if a species ended up being spread apart over millions of years, they would only be able to reproduce of their own species, no matter how many times they mated they would create that same organism. How could the genetic information of the organism ever be added too?<br>  <br>  Maybe morphology should be abandoned the genetic basis of evolution re-examined.<br>  <br>  Also on the Origin of Life, Biology has yet to explain how a single cell came into existence.|`|46e820e9ba704c6776305bf6a1b991efaa	Definition: Organic evolution is the theory that the first living organism developed from lifeless matter. Then, as it reproduced, it is said, it changed into different kinds of living things, ultimately producing all forms of plant and animal life that have ever existed on this earth. All of this is said to have been accomplished without the supernatural intervention of a Creator. Some persons endeavor to blend belief in God with evolution, saying that God created by means of evolution, that he brought into existence the first primitive life forms and that then higher life forms, including man, were produced by means of evolution. <br>  <br>  Is evolution really scientific?<br>  <br>  The “scientific method” is as follows: Observe what happens; based on those observations, form a theory as to what may be true; test the theory by further observations and by experiments; and watch to see if the predictions based on the theory are fulfilled. Is this the method followed by those who believe in and teach evolution?<br>  <br>  Astronomer Robert Jastrow says: “To their chagrin [scientists] have no clear-cut answer, because chemists have never succeeded in reproducing nature’s experiments on the creation of life out of nonliving matter. Scientists do not know how that happened.”—The Enchanted Loom: Mind in the Universe (New York, 1981), p. 19.<br>  <br>  Evolutionist Loren Eiseley acknowledged: “After having chided the theologian for his reliance on myth and miracle, science found itself in the unenviable position of having to create a mythology of its own: namely, the assumption that what, after long effort, could not be proved to take place today had, in truth, taken place in the primeval past.”—The Immense Journey (New York, 1957), p. 199.<br>  <br>  According to New Scientist: “An increasing number of scientists, most particularly a growing number of evolutionists .?.?. argue that Darwinian evolutionary theory is no genuine scientific theory at all. .?.?. Many of the critics have the highest intellectual credentials.”—June?25, 1981, p. 828.<br>  <br>  Physicist H. S. Lipson said: “The only acceptable explanation is creation. I know that this is anathema to physicists, as indeed it is to me, but we must not reject a theory that we do not like if the experimental evidence supports it.” (Italics added.)—Physics Bulletin, 1980, Vol. 31, p. 138.|`|496f7b348ceaee5adf0278f8984c7a69aa	I think most of the religious don't have a clue what it means and it makes me wonder about the state of education these days.|`|AA10004735	I do not acknowledge Evolution as fact,  however I do believe it is a sound working theory.

HbA/Malaria, and HIV immunity anyone?).<br>  <br>  Then there's the quote-mining (New Scientist?

Zero.<br>  <br>  Now if you want to argue God put evolution into motion, then stood back and watched for the last 4 billion years that's another question.  But evolution is the most widely verified and acknowledged theroy in science.  Anyone who refuses evolution, simply put, has no idea what they are talking about.  <br>  <br>  They aren't worth anyone's time.

So you are half right.  The two rules is also the reason why he taught.  See below.<br>  <br>  What's the whole point of salvation?  Check this: God at the<br>  beginning of time sets up laws, scientific laws, gravity, <br>  etc.  He also sets up a basic law of obedience: love God and<br>  love your neighbor.  Man broke these two laws (the core of <br>  the Ten Commandments).  All of us break these laws.  God has<br>  already said if you don't follow these laws you will be put <br>  to death.  But since He loves His creation, He doesn't want <br>  to destroy them.  He wants a way to save them.  But how?  <br>  Sacrifice.  Executing the consequence but on someone else.  <br>  But who could be worthy enough to be sacrified for billions <br>  of people since the beginning of time?  God.  So He went to <br>  earth, and died for the sins of man.  <br>  <br>  All He asks now is for you to accept that.  That is <br>  salvation.  He doesn't want you to pull up a list of things <br>  so you can be 'Christian'.  He just wants you to accept that<br>  He died for you and that your sins are forgiven when you ask <br>  of it to be.<br>  <br>  Now how about attitudes and following laws and <br>  regulations and all this jazz.  You have to see God as a <br>  friend rather than a cop.  Just for an example, if you <br>  hang out with friends that smoke all the time, you are <br>  influenced to do so yourself and might take up smoking.  <br>  In the same way, if you hang out with God and people that <br>  believe in Him, you will be influenced to live that kind of <br>  life.  The change is progressive, and to some people<br>  instant.  But it all starts out with befriending God.|`|f73c3365fa47926a560bc633d74ac58eaa	Is that diarrhea coming from you mouth now.

The only South Africans I have met here in South Florida are all white.  They have all been very nice and they were all sad to have to leave their beloved South Africa.

Women tend to be more open to feelings then men, and of course many men that I know feel the need to have a strong dignity. So I think a woman will be more open to it. I'm sure men can be very open if they want to however. :)|`|819c9b150e0bfed8fc5deb31a2eae7dcaa	probably, because a girl can openly say another girl's pretty but dudes can never admit when another dude's hot. it's so wierd.|`|AA12057892	Nope; it is easier for a gay person to be gay.|`|FUWlfNQxaa	I don't think there is a true answers here.

qSBMlfBAaa	Well! people came to know about "gays&lesbians" from past few years.so, these(gays/lesbians) people r new for them which makes them uncomfortable & due to this they try to use every method to stop them. But as we all know that::Time is great heeler. So,slowly these people will b accepted by society.As some govts. r planning to allow   gay/lesbian marriages.SO,keep patience & see that how gays& lesbians will b accepted by society(which r against them, right now!)|`|AA12218781	People don't like homosexuals because they remind them of things of themselves that they don't like. They are ignorant fools. Gays must be granted all the same rights as heterosexuals soon! Or else I'm moving to the moon!|`|uJi45Rnwaa	Because (1) people understand that it is abnormal, not normal and (2) the acceptance of it as "normal" as signalled the end of every great civilization. <br>  <br>  That is according the real, factual history of the world, not the Revised Liberal Version promoted by The Homosexual Agenda.<br>  <br>  1 Man + 1 Woman = Marriage<br>  <br>  P.S. I see that we have some whiners below. Homosexuals ALREADY HAVE the same rights as everyone else, including the right to marry. We're not, however, going to grant them a special right to marry according to what a marriage is NOT, nor are we going to allow necrophiliacs a ridiculous special right to marry a corpse.|`|52fb2021e111643af1c4345e80a62f3eaa	well..first off...I only support gay marriage if the two chicks are HOT.  B.  I would call myself a HOMOPHOBIC....I have to many gay guys HITTING on me.  Which makes me sicks.  It turns my stomach when I see other gay guys doing there thing in public.  Cause it just reminds me what the last gay guy wanted to do to me when he hit on me.  EEWWW.  Do  I hate the gay people in the world who dance with the rainbow.  No....actually I don't.  I just hate there ways.  But in respect.  I have meet SEVERAL gay guys who have been polite and courteous.  I just don't like the ones who flaunt that they are TOTALLY gay and sexually harass guys trying to find out if they are gay or not.|`|AA11964218	its homophobia...guys are scared they could "catch it" and girls are mad they have less of us to pick from....I am proud to be a gay man...if I were straight...I probably would have killed myself a long time ago...Im very grateful to have friends that are cool with me being a homosexual and to meet people who arent scared of me hiting on them or trying to steal their boyfriend...<br>  <br>  hopefully in the next 5-10 yrs homophobia will be a thing of the past and more and more gays/lesbians can come out without fear or discrimination...|`|Wdsk9bneaa	The desire to make sure no body else has an orgasm better than theirs.|`|AA11551750	Because from our point of view, anal sex is unnatural.

Sorry.|`|AA11728964	The first of all thing beside the religion forbid it, that is, gay marriage, homosexual, won't give offspring, which means, it violates the law of nature. Female lesbians are not better than gays. If we compromise this, soon humanity will be extinct because of this kind of stupid sin that we could actually avoid easily by put our faith in God and know that we must obey His words, not to be a gay.<br>  <br>  To 'Alibaba', who says that it isn't in the bible,<br>  Genesis 1 : 22 - And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth. <br>  how the heck will gay or lesbian be multiplied??? sperm + sperm = dead sperm.|`|dci9SYy2aa	This changes all the time. Considering all the parts of each person's life, what are all the possibilities for what's causing the friction?<br>  <br>  There's a fair amount of networking in homosexual culture. This networking means lots of personal comments about people as a way of finding people you "get along with." With so much gossip going on, why do people wonder about where the bad vibes are coming from? They say talk is cheap and that words hurt. Then they say that they don't. In fact, they don't, so stop complaining. Nobody said life was going to be easy.|`|tfZT2jK7aa	This is only my opinion- not a testament to humanity nor should be considered FACT.<br>  <br>  As James Brown stated "it's a Man's World" - Most men being fallible as we are have an innate dislike and discomfort of being attracted to another man. Other reasons could be simple as: <br>  <br>  Since this country was founded on Religion and the right to practice what you choose, most practiced Christianity and raised upon that tradition for generations.<br>  <br>  It's an unnatural act that serves no purpose than pleasure.<br>  <br>  It's an unnatural relationship that bears no 'fruit' (children)<br>  <br>  The majority sets the rules, the minority makes the loudest noise when they don't want to obey rules. <br>  <br>  I feel Homophobia was a word most likely created by a gay to give straight people a feeling that 'they' are afflicted with something - disease, mental defect or something otherwise when it is an innate discomfort of gays and the thought of the act. Maybe this does not happen in the gay mind so they cannot understand it. <br>  <br>  Lesbians don't matter to men primarily because <br>  1: they have no interest in the relationship. <br>  2: it don't affect them either way.<br>  3: the fantasy of two women seems more pleasurable to them than the act between two men.<br>  4: Male and Female brains are 'wired' differently, but they are expected to accept what MAN tells them (re:psychologically)<br>  <br>  <br>  Conversely- male homosexuality does not affect women as female homosexuality affects men.  The male, clinical, mental health, governmental and colliegate societies sets standards upon citizens (THE BOX) that if something does not meet the standards it is 'shut down'.  <br>  <br>  A gay person cannot should not simply think that a straight person will ever accept, understand or care for what they (straight people) abhor. The same goes with child molestors, sexual diviantes and the whole gamut that wants to be accepted though flawed in thought and logic.<br>  <br>  And for the gay's to equate their struggle with the Afro-American past and struggle for civil/human rights pissed off the Afro-American community as a whole. It is simply not the same. A Black person has no choice in public but to be Black a gay person chooses to 'flaunt' their lifestyle in places where it is not accepted/wanted or liked. A Black person in America was brought here against their will, and acts committed upon them that even White man today cannot apologize to 350  years later. And still try to lessen any stories of what really happened. <br>  <br>  Civil Unions are not the same as marriages, I feel they should not have the same benefits. It will still carry the same stigma. <br>  Primarily it creates a set of 'special categories'  when by law it already affords -equal protection under the law- Civil Unions by design is separate but equal and a violation of the 14th Amendment section 2.<br>  <br>  Many cry for justice, but fail to look at what justice is.  It is not only the fairness of the scales, but the actions of the swift sword (punishment/retribution).  <br>  <br>  Everybody looks at the left hand of justice without looking at the right.|`|xzTPaE2raa	I personally think that a lot of people think that it actually states in the Bible that being gay is a sin.  Every time I hear someone complain about gay people they refer to the Bible.  A lot of people in a lot of cultures are not ready to accept gay people let alone gay marriage.  The crazy thing is that no one has found anything in the Bible that states being gay is a sin.\<br>  <br>  Lesbian is a big thing in the pop culture because it is basically what men want.  Men control/run the entertainment industry.  The entertainment industry promotes lesbian specifically lesbian sex because men say that turns them on.  I guess we are really not ready for people to accept men making love nor gay marriage.  Hope that helps.

AA11708208	You're jealous of bisexual women? Perhaps you wish you were bisexual, or you wish you had the strength to ADMIT that you're bisexual. Other than that, there would be no reason to be jealous, so it's probably that. You want what they have. You might also be jealous of their writing skills.|`|fvjuamIqaa	why ARE  you jealous? maybe  you're bisexual and don't realize it or won't admit it. otherwise,you shouldn't be jealous. we don't know why|`|1a53e475282b9dc554b55138e1e8daf1aa	what?|`|1mQd0Ua9aa	may be Ur bisexual too|`|AA12021955	i seriously dont know what your saying|`|ni9lZ9bCaa	you are an adult and perfectly capable of exploring your sexuality. try sleeping with a girl, see if it turns you on. if it does, then you are either bi or lesbian, if not, then you are straight. don't worry about it so much.

Remember just remain confident!|`|d951b41ca1425def37d166fdcf64e28eaa	I work for a large retail chain and am well versed in group interviews. Let me tell you what I look for in a group interview...The one or two people that stand out the most and make themselves heard without being rude to the other applicants. High Energy and of course fashionable. Be sure you are early, wear something nice, NO JEANS!!!, don't chew gum, keep a smile on your face and just jump right in. Even if you don't have the same amount experience as someone else a great look and attitude can get you in the door! Good luck. Oh and to help you not be nervous, keep a pen in your hand. Not a click pen, use something like a bic. You can roll it in your fingers to keep your hands busy and I find that when I concentrate on a small task, like rolling the pen, I don't get as nervous. Oh, and they will have personality test or questions so just answer honestly. They may ask the same question more than once.|`|pI9frarlaa	Well first u should try to relax...If u can.  I know its easy for someone like me not involved to say that, and it's hard for someone like u whos totally involved to do it, but try.<br>  <br>  U think better relaxed.  And I wouldn't know what the interview would be like.  Interviews differ a lot from place to place and from boss to boss.  But since it says its a GROUP interview, I could guess there will be other people there.<br>  <br>  They always say to "dress for success" so u might wanna look your best.  Smell good too.  And always be attentive like u are interested in all that goes on.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps some.  And i hope u get the job.  And i hope its a great job for u too.  Good luck from me.<br>  <br>  AND RELAX.
