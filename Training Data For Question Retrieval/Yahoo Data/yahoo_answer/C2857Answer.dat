ZDYgzYzxaa	You have to try ph? ( it's pronounced "fuh")<br>  It's a traditional Vietnamese noodle soup dish, consisting of rice noodles in a clear beef broth. Slivers of meat are usually placed on top at the last minute (cooking in the broth) and the soup is accompanied by a large plate of fresh ingredients (such as green onions, cilantro, peppers, basil, mint, lime, and bean sprouts). Many people also add sauces such as hoisin or Sriracha. It's delicious.|`|CKPMkfvfaa	You can  try Pho; it's basically noddle soup with pork and cow meat. A little spicy. It's the only dish I like in a Vietnamese Restaurant. Give it a try.|`|hg8ExtsNaa	I prefer the cat in the orange honey mustard sauce|`|q3tIt6htaa	I am vietnamese and i love the rice dishes you should try bbq pork with eggrolls, grilled porkchop with shredded pork and egg, and my favorite it is called banh xeo it looks like an egg omelet but it is coconut flour on the outside with lots of pork and shrimp and veggies on the inside MMmmmM i think i will go eat some right now and oh yea pho is good too!! its a vietnames soup you have to try it|`|elLDrkNiaa	Ask the waiter/waitress what is good there.

L0R92wWeaa	I would have to go with Papa Johns. They have specialty pizza's like "papa whites", "Spicy Italian", "Garden Fresh", etc. Another signature thing they do, is the "butter sauce" that comes with each pizza. That alone improves Papa Johns standard. They also have good deserts, and even cater to events. Better quality in my opinion.|`|YuYSL0A2aa	Papa John's for overall taste and quality. My only thing against Papa John's is they don't have a stuffed crust pizza so sometimes I get one of those from Pizza Hut.  <br>  If you are going to go out and sit down for pizza... there is a chain called Mellow Mushroom (based in Atlanta,GA) and they are super good!! I like them better than either Papa John's or Pizza Hut. The downside is they are a smaller chain and they don't deliver, but if there is one close to you check them out.|`|T55YPfXUaa	pizza hut is the best one|`|VXcp8hvHaa	pj's|`|z8s6xNLCaa	Papa John's!<br>  <br>  Papa John's not only has better service but their pizza tastes SO much better.

nzWux9Meaa	First dress casual and I would try not to wear jeans. Next when you get there smile and great yourself with a handshake. You should also arrive a few minutes early. During the interview keep eye contact and always smile. Next sound very confident even if you are not. At my interview I was very nervous and I am very shy normally, but at the interview I tried to make show that I was outgoing. Some questions they can ask may be why do you want this job, give me an example of when you solved a problem, and how would you deal with an upset customer or an upset fellow employee? At the end of the interview the manager will ask you if you have any questions. What you should do here is sound interested in the job. I asked what the training consisted of and if it was acceptable to arrive at a shift early. Finally just be yourself and try not to be too nervous. Good Luck!|`|rVbY5qBsaa	It's just Mcdonalds, they hire everyone. Just be nice.|`|s5LtTRbtaa	Treat the interview as casual as possible. Obviously if you want the job you shouldn't act inappropriate or out of bounds in any way, but feel free to be yourself (just on your very best behavior, of course :-)).<br>  <br>  As for your clothes, try to dress as nice as you can *without* over-doing it. Don't wear a suit, but don't wear jeans and a t-shirt. If you have a nice jacket or something seasonally fit, wear it.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|aQZA1EXraa	Yeah, jeans are fine.

WT0dGgoMaa	Definitely tell them you like that the buffet style service allows for good customer service and interaction. Let them know you are both friendly and hardworking.<br>  If you're looking to work back-of-the-house, express an interest to learn Cold choice (salad bar), Hot Cook (the hot entree section) and the Brass Bell Bakery (dessert bar). People who are willing to do this, what is referred to as cross-training, are an asset to any company, because you are helpful in multiple areas, especially when there is a call-off (and there will be many). Knowing the areas and showing brand knowledge always helps.<br>  Many GC's have Cold choice, where they prepare salads, fruits and vegetables, also sometimes a little taco and potato bar. The Hot choice menu changes a lot, they almost always serve pot roast and vegetables, mashed potatoes, cornbread stuffing, etc. The Brass Bell Bakery is called that because each time they refill an item, they are supposed to ring their bell, to alert customers that they've filled or put out a new item. The bake and decorate the cakes, make cobblers, fruit crisps, and an array or bar cookies/desserts.<br>  <br>  Have you eaten there? Mention your favorite items and why you enjoy them to show you know the company. Mention positives about your visit and how you'd like to be a part of their wonderful service.|`|QJmGo5fFaa	Tell them your looking for a fast paced people oriented atmosphere where you can develop your skills and seek advancement opportunities.  Sweet talk them by talking about how this is your favorite place to eat and it's such a great company.|`|8c7f32d052d097a7718edc9c6a056b56aa	You could say that it seems like a friendly place to work, fast-paced, good atmosphere.
AfP9Vs7Daa	The Games really doesn't cost anything. If you will play at their arcade, they will give you a game card of your choice.

Could you not even think of a question to throw in?|`|f9sL3WgQaa	Its because of the cutter they use..it is shaped in six or 8.|`|q1LhYjv1aa	I think they should cut it the way you ask.  It is common courtesy and hopefully they want you back as a customer.  It doesn't seem that hard to take a knife or a regular pizza cutter and cut it the way THE CUSTOMER wants.  What ever happen to the customer is always right slogan.|`|c13261f58d48f2f1acf21bbee37c0bbbaa	they can cut in half i use to ask for them not to cut it at all i don't eat pork an didn't want them using the same tool to cut mine at all and they always left it whole lol|`|bqizZDykaa	2 big pieces is the same as 6 small pieces...|`|Ip6ecgtUaa	I could eat it all LOL|`|EPPb5pRBaa	Sorry it will ok..|`|7N3eZAVoaa	your totely rong you lire i LOVE PApa johns|`|CrBVpvrQaa	wow....|`|AA12235978	Is this supposed to be funny?|`|mIj958p1aa	they only have certain size pizza cutters. i mean why does it matter how it's slice anyways slice your getting the same amount of pizza anyways?

AA10975447	YMMV.<br>  <br>  I've lived in Alhambra for the last 5 years. My apartment has been burglarized 3 times. With that said, after the landlord fixed my windows, it wasn't a problem anymore, and I live in a very nice location.<br>  <br>  El Monte is less affluent than Alhambra. I have friends there, but it's not a place I'd want to live (this coming from a repeat crime victim).<br>  <br>  San Gabriel is okay. About the same as Alhambra, but the traffic gets a lot worse along the 10 and the 60 once you go east of Garfield, so that short distance between the two cities can add up to a difference of an extra 15 minutes on the freeway.<br>  <br>  Demographically, both Alhambra and San Gabriel have populations that are ~48% Asian and about 30-35% Latino. In contrast, El Monte is 72% Latino and about 20% Asian.<br>  <br>  Of the 3 communities, Alhambra has the best school districts.<br>  <br>  btw, what I've noticed in the past two years is that a lot of 20-something hipsters are being priced out of Pasadena, and they are starting to move to Alhambra because it's close to both Pasadena and LA.

AA11044780	Hello- I'd like to suggest "The Grand Finale" in Glendale.  Its got a great atmosphere, and as the name hints, while their meals are quite good, they are best known for their desserts.  One of their desserts is Bananas Foster.  I'd say its moderately priced- not as high as The Precinct, not as cheap as Fridays.

There are a couple near me that are actually quite good, probably because the clientele will complain if it isn't, and business in restaurants is really down, so quality has gone up to keep the few who still eat out. I notice it has a fresher, less over-sauced taste lately.<br>  <br>  Pei Wei is another quick chinese restaurant, but the food is better overall than Panda Express.  <a href="http://www.peiwei.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.peiwei.com/</a><br>  <br>  Enjoy!|`|pueeMH6gaa	I went there once and would never go back.  The food was fried in rancid grease and covered in this sickening syrupy sauce.  The waiter had oozing pimples and I saw him in the back picking his nose when he thought no one could see him.  I left a small tip and the guy starts screaming at us in Chinese so loud I thought his zits were going to explode.  Totally bad experience.|`|kArEdAaTaa	Save yourself the stress PANDA EXPRESS IS nasty. Their servers have very little education it was a bad experience for me all around. They didn't have any of the main courses out on the buffet. Get this when we were walking out after we were finished with our meals our server came running out the door after us for a larger tip as our bill was $40 so we left a $4 tip 10% of the bill. He wanted more.
aKEK24o4aa	it really depends where you work and time of day you work, your tips are much higher at a high-end restaurant versus other low end restaurants.<br>  <br>  All pay minimum wage ($8) + tip.<br>  <br>  My friend who worked at a higher end italian restaurant averaged 200-500 per evening shift|`|VXcp8hvHaa	27.75 an hour ( about 1100.00 a week), plus about 200 a night tips|`|OiUxoqcPaa	If you're counting on tips, don't count on more than 10% these days, with the tough economic times ahead, more people are eating out less and leaving much smaller tips -- and it's not going to end any time soon.

Sometimes they'll throw you a math problem or interesting question like, "If you were a super hero and could have one power, what would it be?"  If they ask that, DO NOT say flying.  That is a horrible choice.  Teleportation is always better than flying.<br>  <br>  <br>  2.  Most places won't hire you on the spot, but it really depends on the manager and how badly they need help.  <br>  <br>  3.  The saying is: "Dress for the job you want, not the job you have."  In your case, since this is McDonald's, you should be fine with a polo shirt and some khakis.  Overdressing can't hurt, but they might think you are a goon if you show up in a really nice business suit.  Go for a happy medium.  Don't show up in baggy jeans and a t-shirt with your du-rag on.<br>  <br>  4.  This probably depends on your state's laws.  Where I live, you need to be 16 to go near the hot stuff (fries, grill, etc)<br>  <br>  General tips:<br>  1. be yourself<br>  2. try to look comfortable and mature<br>  3. explain where you want this job to get you.  you'd like to move up in the time you spend with McDonald's to show a positive career path from the start.|`|7oC5tO9kaa	<a href="http://boards.ign.com/teh_vestibule/b5296/177542797/p1/?2" rel="nofollow">http://boards.ign.com/teh_vestibule/b529...</a><br>  <br>  (that is link to a message board that has this question)|`|MKyvcxmiaa	Hello, fellow yahooligan Justos! I will have been working at my local McDonald's for 11 years this March. I was extremely nervous the morning of my interview. I had to take a drug test, and by the way, I have never taken a single drug in my life, other than Advil of course!! Some of the questions they asked me were about my life habits, and what I would do with co-workers in certain risky situations. If you are a purely good person, you should fly through the initial phase of the grueling interview. Once done with the initial part, they could ask you a couple math questions, in case you ever worked the till, and of course to check and make sure you are up to par with the rest of the workers! I remember that the questions vary from extremely easy, such as:<br>  <br>  4 + x = 13<br>  <br>  and also very hard ones such as:<br>  <br>  If 1/2x +1/2(1/2x + 1/2(1/2x +1/2(1/2x + ... = y,<br>  then x = ? <br>  <br>  I am not quite sure of what they will fully expect of you, but you might want to study up on your basic math formulas the night before.<br>  <br>  They will not directly hire you at the interview, but they will give you major signs. The lady that interviewed me was extremely nice. After the whole thing was over, we went for a drive in my vehicle to a hot spot at the big barn right out of town. We proceeded to make sweet love, but that is entirely off the subject. The interview obviously went very well.<br>  <br>  I think that wearing what you stated would be sufficient, but would wearing a 120 thread count suit kill you? I wore a 140 thread, but not to brag. Your friend has a low chance of being hired because they usually aim for employees over the age of 24, but if your resume shines out over all the others, you will have a huge advantage.<br>  <br>  Working at McDonald's has been one of the greatest experiences of my life, and I wouldn't change anything, ever. I truly wish you luck, I and hope you nail the job! I would like to hear back from you, good or bad news. My e-mail address is nateyboy_7@hotmail.com. I look forward to hearing back from you! <br>  <br>  Goodluck!<br>  <br>  PS. Burger King is better.|`|VvbOSbRnaa	Well, first of all good luck! :)<br>  <br>  A lot of times now places will ask you situation questions. (ie: The customer said they ordered cheese and no mayo but they got no cheese and mayo - what do you do?)<br>  <br>  Make sure to shake hands w/ the interviewer. Defiantly wear what your friends are telling you. Dress to impress. Even though it's McDonald's and your first job.... you want them to take you seriously <br>  <br>  Good luck and try to show up early! I recommend 15 mins.|`|pueeMH6gaa	Good luck in the interview.  The delay probably wasn't caused by the manager not having time to read your application, let's face it, the guy probably isn't Stephen Hawking, he's probably too stupid to know how to read and had to find someone to look it over for him.  Some important interview tips.  When he the interviewer enters the room, put out your cigarette.  Only curse to make a positive point such as "I really want to work at this f***ing place!"  Don't call the interviewer by their first name, use the last name.  Example: "Hey Smith, I'm glad you asked me that question..."
hHC2oCqDaa	Cool Bro!  We were born around the same day.  <br>  <br>  Reviews say 9th Avenue Saloon in NYC is good but has some gay themes on some days.  You probably have to go check it out yourself.<br>  click on website in source.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.
A95WFH8waa	at my macdonalds in north carolina we can get sweet tea from the time they open 2 the time they close|`|m5N8Ur6Daa	Its a drink so I think you can get it whenever<br>  But it tastes like chemicals!!|`|uuREdiceaa	you can get sweet tea at any time during the day.|`|c13261f58d48f2f1acf21bbee37c0bbbaa	you can get sweet tea at anytime just like a soda|`|GfwjOVGdaa	I used to get one everyday at 7 in the morning.|`|Ip6ecgtUaa	All day long Sweet tea is off the hook!!!|`|VvbOSbRnaa	Drinks are part of a normal menu. There is no time limit in which you can order beverages! :)|`|pueeMH6gaa	The last time I ordered this, it really smelled like urine.  The employees were all laughing and pointing my way so I didn't drink it.|`|a2134372f454ba425d7b423ac42d1ed2aa	Mon-Sat 10:30am<br>  Sun 11am<br>  <br>  Sweet tea any time. You can order ANY drink at any time.|`|Yltl6hcXaa	you can get a sweet tea whenever<br>  <br>  thats the only drink i get from there|`|OlEnfCo3aa	i think its all day|`|WfQf2wBNaa	yeahh,,
tzrLDbHWaa	Well, all depends on when you want to eat.  Generally the lunch and dinner buffets are very similar, you might get a few additional items on the dinner buffet, but if you time it right and want to save some money, you can go there for lunch and be there when they bring out all the dinner stuff.  I rarely ever do lunch buffets though, its too early for me, I'd rather pay the extra and eat for dinner instead of being huungry again come nighttime.<br>  <br>  As for breakfast, I love it.  If you think about how much you would pay at a regular restaurant for what you can get, its worth it.  I mean the omelettes would usually run ya at least 6 bucks, and if you're a fan of breakfast meats, with as much as restaurants usually charge, its a great deal.  The other great thing about breakfast buffets is you'll be full enough that you wont need to eat lunch usually.<br>  <br>  My favorite was Planet Hollywood (was Alladdin when I last went) and Mandalay Bay.  If you're gonna go for breakfast, don't go all pricey.  I mean yeah, places like Planet Hollywood, Mandalay Bay, Bellagio will be good, but you can't really f**k up an egg, and there's not many things you can really do to make an egg taste better.  An egg is an egg.  As long as they have an omelette station, one is as good as another.  I'd personally reccomend Excalibur or Luxor, since they were fairly on the cheaper side, and again, its breakfast.|`|FisVYasvaa	The Riviera has a pretty cool buffet, not too expensive. If their sorbet machine is still working... haven't been there in a while.
YnNhr3eIaa	packets have a shorter life than products in bottles if they are in plastic. Because plastic is pourous. They will normally have a 6 month expiration.|`|mIj958p1aa	well ketchup kept in a bottle can last a few months to a year so i don't see why it would be different for a packet since it's the same condiment. i know mayo wouldn't last long since that has egg in it and would spoil quickly. mustard & bbq sauce would follow the same concept as ketchup|`|Ip6ecgtUaa	Usually a pretty long time.|`|1dHe0Hfdaa	Hmm...I'd say 3 months
