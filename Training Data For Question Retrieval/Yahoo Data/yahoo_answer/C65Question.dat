20090304091524AA7qWyc	Politics & Government;Elections	Will Obama and Napolitano support the law?	If Napolitano is not interested in enforcing all of the laws of the land, and specifically excluding the laws related to illegal immigration, we need to find out how President Obama stands on the law also, and fast.  If Washington is going to become, again, elietist dolts picking and choosing the law they will enforce, we need to mount serious opposition to this President.  Because I don't believe Napolitano would make this effort to stifle the Immigration Officers of our country without the support of Mr. Obama, we need to find out wh is what now.

20090304091745AAxrmHP	Politics & Government;Immigration	What are our options for my wife to stay in the US for longer than her I-94 states?	It seems I have a bit of a problem. I’m an American citizen and my wife is a Canadian citizen and we’ve been married for over three years. Our ultimate goal is to file for permanent residence for myself in Canada while staying temporarily in the US while my application is being processed. During that time, I would be working and supporting my wife and also paying the rest of my credit card debt which is why we cannot immediately move to Canada.    However, after visiting Canada last month, upon re-entry to the US is where we ran into our problem. The woman at the Niagara Falls port of entry told us that we’ve “been married since 2005 and have done nothing”. She was very unwilling to hear us explain how we’ve been trying and I was eventually told that my wife can only stay in the US for one month which is definitely not enough time for us to do what it is we need to do and my wife and I would much rather not spend any time living apart from one another.    My first thought was that we could maybe file for an extension for her stay but we need to make sure the extension will be good for as long as we need it-which could be up to a year, but it could also be as short as a few months. My other thought was that we could go ahead and file for her permanent residence to last while we’re here in the US but, since we will be living permanently in Canada in the near future, it seems ridiculous to me to pay the fourteen-hundred dollars it takes to get that done.   So I guess my question is: Is there an option I have overlooked? If not, what would seem to be the best course?

20090304092609AAbFiO6	Politics & Government;Politics	Why would anyone call Obama pro-abortion? how is that acurate in anyway?	Doesnt Obama Claim to be Christian (not that other religions are not against abortion, I am just pointing out which he professes or claims)?       So if he is Christian which means Christ-like then that means one would naturally be opposed to the sheding of innocent blood see the books of Isiah, Jeremiah and Matthew amongst others, so I was like lets look at this CLAIM that he is pro-abortion?       Facts:    Post-Election / Pre-Inauguration   ? November 5, 2008 - Obama selects pro-abortion Rep. Rahm Emanuel as his White House Chief of Staff. Emanuel has a 0% pro-life voting record according to National Right to Life.   ? November 19, 2008 - Obama picks pro-abortion former Sen. Tom Daschle as his Health and Human Services Secretary. Daschle has a long pro-abortion voting record according to National Right to Life.   ? November 20, 2008 - Obama chooses former NARAL legal director Dawn Johnsen to serve as a member of his Department of Justice Review Team. Later, he finalizes her appointment as the Assistant Attorney General for the Office of the Legal Counsel in the Obama administration.   ? November 24, 2008 - Obama appoints Ellen Moran, the former director of the pro-abortion group Emily's List as his White House communications director. Emily's List only supported candidates who favored taxpayer funded abortions and opposed a partial-birth abortion ban.   ? November 24, 2008 - Obama puts former Emily's List board member Melody Barnes in place as his director of the Domestic Policy Council.   ? November 30, 2008 - Obama named pro-abortion Sen. Hillary Clinton as the Secretary of State. Clinton has an unblemished pro-abortion voting record and has supported making unlimited abortions an international right.   ? December 10, 2008 - Obama selects pro-abortion former Clinton administration official Jeanne Lambrew to become the deputy director of the White House Office of Health Reform. Planned Parenthood is "excited" about the selection.   ? December 10, 2008 - Obama transition team publishes memo from dozens of pro-abortion groups listing their laundry list of pro-abortions actions they want him to take.      Pro-Abortion Presidential Record - 2009   ? January 5, 2009 - Obama picks pro-abortion Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine as the chairman of the Democratic Party.   ? January 6, 2009 - Obama chooses Thomas Perrelli, the lawyer who represented Terri Schiavo’s husband Michael in his efforts to kill his disabled wife, as the third highest attorney in the Justice Department.   ? January 22, 2009 - Releases statement restating support for Roe v. Wade decision that allowed virtually unlimited abortions and has resulted in at least 50 million abortions since 1973.   ? January 23, 2009 - Forces taxpayers to fund pro-abortion groups that either promote or perform abortions in other nations. Decison to overturn Mexico City Policy sends part of $457 million to pro-abortion organizations.   ? January 26, 2009 - Obama nominee for Deputy Secretary of State, James B. Steinberg, tells members of the Senate that taxpayers should be forced to fund abortions. Nominee erroneously says limits on abortion funding are unconstitutional.   ? January 29, 2009 - President Obama nominates pro-abortion David Ogden as Deputy Attorney General.   ? February 12, 2009 - Obama nominates pro-abortion Elena Kagan to serve as Solicitor General.       February 27, 2009 - Starts the process of overturning pro-life conscience protections President Bush put in place to make sure medical staff and centers are not forced to do abortions.      February 28, 2009 - Barack Obama nominates pro-abortion Kathleen Sebelius to become Secretary of Health and Human Services.         so is the Claim he is pro-abortion unfounded?

20090304093326AApeKlD	Politics & Government;Government	Can somebody please explain how taxing the rich is a good idea?	Obama is trying to raise the taxes on the rich.      Now, mind you (these are facts that were derived from IRS reports      the top 1% of tax paying Americans earned 1.79 Trillion Dollars (22.06% of total) yet they paid as a whole (the entire 1%) 408.4 Billion Dollars      The Bottom 95% of tax paying Americans earned 5.14 Trillion Dollars (63.34% of total) yet they paid as a whole (the entire 95%) 408.1 Billion Dollars      That means. 95% of Americans (the poor that Obama is not going to tax) supplied less than the 1% of Americans Obama is going to try and tax.      I have some questions      How can a group that earns 2.87 times less money than the other group, yet still pay more in taxes?      Seems to me, like the 95% need to have their taxes increased by 287% so that it is even across the board, right?      Also, mind you. That 95%, if their taxes increase and worst comes to it, they leave the country. Lets do some math      95% of the US Population = 288633408 people   1% of the US Population = 3038246.4 people      Now, if obama taxes the 1% and they leave, and avoid paying taxes the government loses ~408 billion dollars      Based on the # of americans in the 95% range, and the amount paid by that entire group you get $1413.9 per person      If obama increased the taxes on them instead, and the same # of americans left the country (1% of total = 3038246.4 people) the government loses 4.3 billion dollars      4.3 billion dollars >> 408.4 billion dollars      and mind you the 1% already pays 2.87 times more in taxes than the 95% as a whole.      I know the what 95% of the population voting for a man is going to overwhelm the 1% voting for the other, so obviously the 95% wont care, because they aren't getting the short end of the stick      but what if them voting for obama, causes the percentage of Americans that actually mean something to the country leaves, or lays of workers to cover the taxes..         Somebody make this make sense to me please.   Is it really just the poor overwhelming the rich in votes, so now the rich have to pay even more? Since when did it become ok to pick on the minority? Give the minority scholarships yet take away from another minority so long as its accepted by the majority?   What if the minority says screw it, and leaves for a prospering country? We all know they have hte money and power to do it?      Will America remain free, if it watched the only group of Americans that could actually affect the country leave? Or will the military force them to stay, just like Germany did to Fritz Haber. Who mind you, became a war criminal because he was forced by Germany to make poisonous gas.      How can increasing the taxes on the group that already pays more in taxes fair?      I say increase the taxes on the other 95% by 287% and then go from there. Enough with the "I am poor its not fair i didn't go to Harvard and I'm not smart"

20090304095716AA6nxRN	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	16, Legal to move out, but any consequences?	I turning 16 in a few months and have decided I am going to move out, i dont do well at home. You might think this is an immature decision, although my home life for as far as I can remember isn't something that anyone would want. I've decided that I am going to stay with a friend and his family. They treat me like their own daughter, although my mother doesn't like this family because they let him have friends over to drink in the basement. I do understand in my mother's view that this isn't ideal parenting, but we do drink and they would rather we do it indoors where they know we are safe then outside in some alleyway. My question is that when I am 16 it is legal to move out but, if my mother finds out where I am staying can she charge this family or anything like that? Can she call the police and make me move out?    Thank you :D

The slip-up happened on CNN when anchorwoman Zain Verjee was reporting about Northwest Airlines now selling peanuts on flights.      Verjee mentioned the word "penis" three times instead of "peanuts."      "Northwest began serving penis this month as its merger partner Atlanta-based Delta airlines has done for years," Verjee said.      "Georgia is the top penis producing state in the country."      The footage has been uploaded to YouTube in many different versions and has become an internet sensation with more than 700,000 views today.

20090227061621AADw7K0	Politics & Government;Politics	Does Obama want civil unrest or does he truly believe he is helping?	I think he wants civil unrest and here is why. He can not effectively "change" anything without it being dismantled and destroyed and then rebuilt. The economic crisis is a perfect example of this.      Step 1: Pass legislation that increases government power with the so -called good intention of helping the economy. Some parts of this legislation actually circumvents the constitution and state rights.      Step 2: When this legislation passes and fails then this will cause an upset because the economy will crash, high taxes will be implemented on all classes and those who can't pay, their property will be confiscated by the government      Step 3: The mass confiscating of private property will cause massive riots and civil unrest. Obama will have no choice but to enact martial law (which basically removes the the rights of police and states from controling citizens while using the military or a military type force to enforce curfews and detain people who are perceived as a threat to the public and the government. This also does away with habeas corpus-protection from unlawful imprisonment)      Step 4: Once Martial Law is enacted then the constitution can easlity be dismantled or re-written. This has actually been used in other countries just for that purpose and also it has been used to quiet political opposition.      I feel sorry for those who keep burying their heads in the sand because they have no clue that our rights can be gone in a blink of an eye with some well placed government strategies and by the time these people figure it out, it will be too late.

The Administration’s projected budget deficit of $1.75 trillion is higher than the last five years of deficits combined, and under this plan, we will see three consecutive trillion dollar deficits between now and FY 2012.      2. While it was purported to cut the budget deficit in half – from $1.75 trillion in 2009 to $533 billion by 2013 – this budget projects higher deficits in 2014 ($570 billion), 2015 ($583 billion), and 2016 ($637 billion). In 2019, the final year in the budget, the deficit is projected to be $712 billion.      3. Including the recently-enacted trillion-dollar “stimulus” spending bill, discretionary spending will soar by 24 percent this year under this budget.      4. The budget projects that the national debt will increase from $8.4 trillion in 2009 to $15.4 trillion in 2019.      5. The Administration’s budget contains $1.4 trillion in tax increases – tax hikes that will impact everyone, from small businesses, charities, and seniors to everyone who owns a 401(k) and anyone who flips on a light switch.       6. After promising that he will reduce taxes on 95 percent of Americans, the Administration’s budget establishes a $646 billion energy tax hike that will impact anyone who uses electricity, drives a car, or relies on energy in any way.      7. This budget forecasts more than $1.5 trillion in new health care spending, including a 10-year, $634 billion a health care “reserve fund.” The budget also calls for seven percent annual growth in Medicare and more than six percent annual growth in Medicaid over the next 10 years.      8. The budget includes a $750 billion placeholder for a second round of spending under the Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP), even though the first round of TARP spending is not yet finished, nor is there a clear explanation of how funds under the initial round was spent.      9. The Administration’s budget claims that reducing the number of troops in Iraq over the next 10 years will cut the deficit by $1.6 trillion; however, that is only because the budget allocates the same amount of funds for the Iraq war each year over the next decade, even though most combat troops may be withdrawn during the next 19 months. The savings are, at best, deceptive.      10. The budget provides a scant 2.9 percent pay raise for military personnel as required by law, less than a week after Democrats in Congress provided the necessary funding to implement District of Columbia locality pay for overseas Foreign Service officers, which would constitute an 18 percent   pay increase.

20090304075624AAOVSu5	Politics & Government;Politics	Why does each party- when in power- define patriotism as supporting their agendas?	Now the Democrats are calling the Republicans unpatriotic and unsupportive. The Republicans are merely doing the same squawking as the Democrats during the Bush years.       This same squawking was ironically labeled "unpatriotic" when the Democrats did it during Bush's reign.      1. Why do Republicans see their minority dissent now as patriotic but for 6-8 years when the Democrats did it, it was labeled akin to supporting terrorism?      2. Why do Democrats try to hard sell Republican dissent as sinking the country when they did much the same thing (with less effectiveness) for six years, before becoming the Congressional majority by a hair?      Aren't both being hypocritical? Sure, there will be short or long arguments about the spirit of the times- citing war or economic disaster. But I'm talking about the bare nuts and bolts. Isn't this exactly what windy politicians always do?

20090304073819AATRtpa	Politics & Government;Other - Politics & Government	Do americans understand that we cannot sustain the current Bush and Reagan tax cuts for much longer?	How many people realize that when Reagan took the top marginal tax rate down from 70% to about 55% that it was the first time it had gone below 70% since 1936?...that for 45 years, some of the greatest economic years of our country...when budget deficits were minimal, the top tax rates...meaning the top incremental federal income tax charged to the highest of highest income earners for the top tiered dollars earned had not gone below 70%?  Today of course that top tax rate is roughly half of that.   If you go back all the way to 1913, you will also find that most of the time since then the top tax rates were actually even higher than 70% as high as 81%, 84%, 92%, etc....      It should be common sense and obvious that even if you believe we need to stimulate the economy and bail out companies and spend trillions of dollars doing so and fight wars, etc..that we cannot just keep running up the national debt.  Common sense says...ok, we need to spend the money, fine, but we have to have a source for it called revenue......and not simply keep running up the current 14 trillion dollar national debt.      The thing with this country, the USA, is we seem to have lost our common sense as a country.   I like Obama and think he is a super improvement over Bush, but I even have problems with some of his views.  For example he said yesterday that globalization is the solution to our problems..a ludicrous statement.  If he is talking like trade with france and england etc..like there has always been...I am good witht that globalization.  But if he means globalization as in our trade with china india, mexico and all the super cheap labor countries..then he is flat wrong.  Thats what I mean by common sense. You cannot have a society that does not make anything or one that if you go to its stores that you find that 80% of manufactured goods are made in other countries. Its a spiral downwards....the end result to this cannot be good for the citizens, ie, labor force of the country.      and why is Obama talking about not raising taxes on the wealthy untill 2011 while he is increasing spending...and piling on the national debt.  The stimulus I understand, but have got to get away from the mentality of spending without the revenue being budgeted.

20090304080934AAuamDR	Politics & Government;Other - Politics & Government	Mm, mm, that's good Kool-Aid! Conspiracy or no conspiracy?	KOOL-AID FLAVOR DISCLAIMER: Now that I have posted several questions in this section, the necessity to identify my persuasion finally sinks through my thick skull because evidently, my style is too ambiguous. PLEASE BE ADVISED: This is not anti-Obama / anti-‘liberal’ Patriot-Berry-Blue or Dollar-Vine-Green flavored Kool-Aid - This is bright juicy succulent Hammer&Sickle-Red anti-capitalism / pro-collectivism flavored Kool-Aid. PLEASE APPRECIATE THAT CONTEXT AS YOU READ, AND RESPOND ACCORDINGLY. (This advisory will accompany all my postings from now on.)      The foundation of 'modern' economics is subjectivity. The foundation of modern cosmology is relativity. In the 'relative' universe, nothing is 'universal', space and time are elastic and always occur in unique qualities that always apply only to you based on your individual interpretive perspective - The universe emerges from nothing for no reason, commences then concludes, occurs once and never occurs again. In modern economics, everything is intrinsically worthless, 'value' is something you individually determine by unique criteria based on your individual interpretive perspective and it never means anything to anyone but you. The common theme here is self-centric ‘interpretive’ ‘perspective’. When we embrace these sophisticated ‘modern’ concepts, we practice subjective relativity, which leads us to the obvious conclusion that nothing I ever think or feel means anything to anybody else, and so just as obviously, nothing anybody else ever thinks or feels means anything to me. This is the perfect mentality for a civilization of disorganized and demoralized, easy-to-control isolated individual victims. We can’t organize, coordinate, plan or prepare anything collectively because after all, we each reside in our own little isolated individualized subjective interpretive relative personal universes that mean absolutely nothing to anybody else. Even if it’s not a conspiracy, it is at least coincidentally, the perfect global religion for the advancement and perpetuation of ‘modern’ economics… the New World Order, One True Religion… Nihilism! The universe is pointless and meaningless, life is pointless and meaningless, it all began for no reason, it will all end with absolute finality, it happens once for no reason then never happens again, and in the overwhelming vastness of nothingness for eternity, this one brief little anomaly we call the universe is utterly insignificant and totally forgettable… Oh well, we might as well just give up. What’s the point? Nobody cares what I think or feel. Nobody understands me but me. We have nothing in common.      Maybe it’s a bit of a stretch… but I’m pretty creeped out and suspicious of it all. What do you think? Conspiracy or no conspiracy?

Seems to me too many people are just believing in the President, they hear he's giving their state $x,xxx,xxx,xxx and that their Governor won't take some of it and they get all ticked off, they don't understand that with the money come terms our Governor's can't agree too, and it's best for the state if they turn the money away.          Take the unemployment money, if the Governor takes it and in 3 years we have to abide by the terms set by the President and don't have the money, we go into a deficit spiral once again, then the people will start clamoring about how the Governor sold them out.  Free Money, doesn't happen.          I do think that there needs to be a better way for the states to budget and the people to actually see where the money is going.  Not just this amount went to road construction, but this amount went to tar, this amount went to Caterpillar for this piece of equipment, this amount went to train more workers, this amount to pay the road crew.

These are jobs at all levels, mfg, customer service, R & D, cpu programming, everything.      I know in theory we can get things cheaper, like shoes.  But take the model of many car mfg's, they set up production where there are customers.  This is not only for shipping reasons, but has also been to  help the economy in which they sell to.

If you were locked in a vault and you could keep every dollar bill you initialled, (we're assuming that you initial one bill every second and that you don't need to eat, sleep or take comfort breaks!) do you know how long it would take you to make a million dollars?   Twelve days of non-stop effort would earn you a million dollars.    120 days would give you $10 million.   1200 days - $100 million. That's over three years to get a paltry $100 million ... Still a long way to go ...   After 31.7 years, you'd be a billionaire.   After initialling a dollar bill every second without stopping, it would take you 31,709.8 years to get to your first trillion!

It seems to me if the Republican Party was so “Conservative”, we might have seen some of their so-called outrage when Bush was spending my grandchildren’s tax moneys like a drunken liberal on spring break.      There are a lot of so called conservatives crying about President Obama’s stimulus package that contains regulations on how the money is to be spent, who said absolutely nothing when Bush literally gave away $800 billion to the banks to spend as they wish.  (We see how that is working out)      I’m sorry, but in my way of thinking, that’s not “Conservative”, that’s Partisan Politics – the same “game” that lost them the last two major elections in this country.

If it is already known that these pedophiles that viciously rape young children can't be rehabilitated, why are they let back into society?  Stiles may never be up for parole in his case, but some are.  What are your thoughts?  Should we, the taxpayers, have to pay for the cost to jail these people that will always be predators to our children?  My personal opinion is that they should face the death penalty in cases such as this, whether or not a murder has been committed.  And some may argue that some are wrongly accused, but let's just stick with the cases where the accused are guilty beyond a shadow of a doubt.

Top Democrats believe they have struck political gold by depicting Rush Limbaugh as the new face of the Republican Party, a full-scale effort first hatched by some of the most familiar names in politics and now being guided in part from inside the White House.      The strategy took shape after Democrats included Limbaugh’s name in an October poll and learned their longtime tormentor was deeply unpopular with many Americans. Then the conservative talk-radio host emerged as an unapologetic critic of Barack Obama shortly before his inauguration, when even many Republicans were showering him with praise.      Soon it clicked: Democrats realized they could roll out a new GOP bogeyman for the post-Bush era by turning to an old one in Limbaugh, a polarizing figure since he rose to prominence in the 1990s.

I finally had a supression hearing in which my lawyer didn't bring up a or mention anything about what he told me was the basis of my case(the police used a key they received from another party to enter into my house). I dont have the results from the supression yet, but it went terrible. Throughout my case my lawyer has never returned any of my phone calls or letters. I have even showed up for court to be told I didn't have to be there even though he could have contacted me beforehand.   Here is my worry: If I dont fire him and I lose the supression and ultimately get convicted, I will have no grounds for an appeal. I am really confused on what to do. I know that without knowing the full details of the case it may be hard to answer this but hopefully I can get some advise. I paid him money and I dislike feeling like I am a burden or a nuisance.      Thanks

Ok, so me and my girlfriend signed a year lease on a place. After the year was up my landlord never made us sign another lease so I assume we are just on a month to month now. Well we broke up and she moved out. She took all of her stuff out of the house but I recently discovered that she is going there with her new boyfriend while i'm at work and messing with my stuff. I want to change the locks so she can't get into the house anymore. I know my landlord would not have a problem with it as she is pretty laid back. My question is, if my ex tries to go over there and sees I've changed the locks and throws a fit about it, legally are there any repercussions i could face by locking her out?

20090227062450AAFwxeH	Politics & Government;Immigration	Is this a chargeable crime only if committed by an illegal?	Woman gave birth in shower, put baby in a bag, police say      by Tyler Lockman - Feb. 27, 2009 12:00 AM   The Arizona Republic      A Scottsdale resident attending the University of Arizona has been charged with attempted first-degree murder after she put her newborn child in a bag of dirty clothes, according to court documents.   Sarah Elizabeth Tatum, 19, a Chaparral graduate, was arrested early Wednesday in connection with an incident on Monday in which she tried to dispose of the infant after giving birth in a university residence hall, police said.   She told University of Arizona Police that she had a miscarriage in the shower and the baby was in a bag tied shut at the end of her bed, the complaint said.   Attempts to reach her court-appointed attorney, Laura Udall, or family members in the Valley were not successful.   Police cut the bag open and found a full-term male baby gasping for air. The baby was taken to a local hospital.   Doctors said the baby was suffering from hypoxia, a lack of oxygen, and believe he was in the bag for at least two hours.   Tatum told police in an interview that the baby was dead when she delivered it.   Police noted that in the interview that Tatum used the phrase "after the baby died" when describing her actions in the shower.   Tatum hid her pregnancy and did not seek prenatal care, according to the court document.   Jamie Perez, 19, who lives in the same dormitory, said Tatum would not admit to anyone that she was pregnant.   "We all thought she was pregnant, and when we would walk into the room she would turn and not face us," Perez said. "When people confronted her, she said that it was a thyroid problem."   Tatum was arrested Wednesday following release from University Medical Center. She was released from jail hours later.   Arizona Child Protective Services Spokeswoman Liz Barker Alvarez said the child was still being treated and that CPS has an "open investigation with UAPD" regarding the case.   Under the conditions of Tatum's release, she cannot have contact with the baby; must show proof of a mental-health evaluation at her next court date, March 17; and she must surrender her passport within 48 hours of her release. She also cannot leave the jurisdiction of the court without permission of Pima County Superior Court.   Arizona has a Safe Haven law that allows a mother to abandon a newborn anonymously with no legal penalties.   The baby can be surrendered at a fire station or hospital, to an emergency medical technician in uniform, an adoption agency or to a church bearing the Safe Haven logo.   Tatum was placed on interim suspension from the UA, and is not permitted on campus until it is lifted.      Anyone know why she isn't locked up or being charged with attempted murder? IF this crime was committed by an illegal would you be reading riots posts, would they be released hours after being arrested allowed to go anywhere freely except on campus until the interim suspension is lifted.

Obama has 12 Pro-abortionists on his Cabinet          who is at fault now?       We now have the highest office in the nation following after the likes of Margaret Sanger, Why is this genocide allowed to continue?      According to the standard argument for Obama’s thinking “nobody is pro-abortion. Everybody would prefer a world without abortions. After all, what woman would deliberately get pregnant just to have an abortion? But given the world as it is, sometimes women find themselves with unplanned pregnancies at times in their lives when having a baby would present significant problems for them. So even if abortion is not medically required, it should be permitted, made as widely available as possible and, when necessary, paid for with taxpayers' money. As, feel good and fair as that position might sound, may we reason together a moment? The is a serious defect in the argument can been seen if we shift the morality of this question to earlier generations, Let us take slavery: Many people at the time of the American founding would have preferred a world without slavery but nonetheless opposed abolition. Such people — Thomas Jefferson was one — reasoned that, given the world as it was, with slavery woven into the fabric of society just as it had often been throughout history, the economic consequences of abolition for society as a whole and for owners of plantations and other businesses that relied on slave labor would be dire. Many people who argued in this way were not monsters but honest and sincere, albeit profoundly mistaken. Some (though not Jefferson) showed their personal opposition to slavery by declining to own slaves themselves or freeing slaves whom they had purchased or inherited. They certainly didn't think anyone should be forced to own slaves. Still, they maintained that slavery should remain a legally permitted option and be given constitutional protection.    Would we describe such people, not as pro-slavery, but as 'pro-choice'?

He bagan pushing a large boulder at the edge of the cliff. Others said "Don't push it. It could fall and crush the house." He stopped, confused that his actions could cause a problem.      His friend Dick came up and said "Come on George, don't be a weenie. Let's push this boulder over the cliff."      So George and Dick pushed and pushed until finally the boulder went rolling down the cliff. They walked away laughing.      As the boulder roared down the cliff, another boy named Barry rushed out and tried to stop the boulder, but George and Dick just continued laughing saying "That's not how to do it."      Barry did everthing he could to stop the boulder, but it was too late and the boulder crushed the house.      All of the friends of George and Dick started pointing at Barry saying "It's his fault...he didn't stop the boulder."      Whose fault was it?

They said, "Privatize Social Security!"   They said, "Privatize Education!"      If we did privatize all of these things, would those just be two more things that Obama would have to bail out and fix.  Thank god my Social Security, whatever is left of it, is not in the market.  I cannot afford to lose both my 401K and my social security!      After all, the private sector has health care, and look how much that costs us!  Health care keeps getting more expensive while we send tax dollars to subsidize them!! Why the corporate welfare??  Why listen to the GOP?
20090304084544AAaoSsY	Politics & Government;Politics	Why do Neo-Cons blame everything on the Dems from 2006-2008?	The small majority of democratic congressmen from 2006 - 2008 were stymied by a Republican side that filibustered more than any other congress in the history of the USA.      So, when Pelosi tried to get meaningful legislation across the isle, the Republicans just filibustered so nothing would get done, then blame the Democrats.  (Crybaby politics)   Then, when a miracle happened and they actually didn't filibuster, GW Bush would just veto it.  (It is funny, that he only found his veto pen after 2006.)      That's right, if nothing got done by Pelosi and the Democrats, it is the fault of the Republicans for shutting down congress,  FACT!!!      So, now, why do all you Republicans blame Democrats for anything from 2006 - 2008?  It makes no sense to do so, because your own party got high on the filibuster and Bush went on a Veto frenzy, after 6 years of blank checks and secret meetings for the GOP.

20090304085332AAYjOKJ	Politics & Government;Politics	I have asked this question many times on here?	As well as to many libbies who want the rich to be taxed more. I use the following analogy to to explain in easy to understand language. Where am I going wrong?      A man owns a bakery. He employs 4 people. He is able to produce a loaf of bread for $.75. He then turns around and sells that loaf for $1.00. He has a big consumer base.    Now, the government steps in and taxes him $.25 a loaf. That means that it will take a $1.00 to produce a loaf of bread. He cannot sell that loaf of bread for a dollar because he will not make any profit, so he must start selling it for $1.25. His consumer base goes down.    Well, the government then goes on to put another $.25 tax on his product. This now means it costs a buck and a quarter to produce that loaf of bread. Well in order to make a profit he must raise the price of bread to $1.50.    Well, his customers see that they used to be able to buy some inexpensive bread at his bakery. Now that bread's price has gone up. They stop going to buy bread from him.     He starts losing business because people are not buying his product so he cannot keep 4 employees on so he has to let 2 of them go. That means 2 more people unemployed because of tax increases on him.    The moral is that businesses do not pay taxes, you do. Tax the hell out of them they will just raise the price of their product to cover the tax increases.

20090304093247AAolBqV	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Can a person get arrested for dumpster diving & stealing other people's garbage?	My mother couldn't find her phone & she thought maybe it got knocked into the little garbage can right next to her computer desk. She called it & some man answered & said he would give it back for $50.00 & to meet him at the store across the street. My sister took the neighbors' with her, who said they knew who this guy was & got the phone back & didn't pay the $50.00.      This got me thinking about what we throw in our garbage, so I've been trying to remember to tear up anything with personal information. So the other day, I see this car pull up right next to the dumpster & I see him jump in & he is taking full bags of garbage & putting them in his trunk. I had just thrown my garbage & my bag had a blue tint & I had torn up Dr. Pepper & Mountain Dew boxes which I could see through the blue tint, so one of the bags he took was definitely mine. I figured he took my bag because he figured there would be a lot of cans to recycle in it.       It all happened so fast, even if I would have called the police they wouldn't have got there in time & I sure wasn't going to go out there by myself & confront him. I've already been through a big ordeal with identity theft & someone even used my social security number for employment, so it's frustrating to have to worry about what I throw away now.       So what would you do if you saw someone stealing your garbage? What precautions do you take or how do you prevent it?

My fine was reduced, and the judge explained that this was NOT a misdemeanor, just a citation. Just like a speeding ticket.      So would I have to list the trespassing fine under this question?

I watched the local news a few nights ago, and it showed a protest against a gay preacher. They had rainbow signs that said, "God hates f*gs," and stuff like that, and then out of nowhere, "God hates Obama?" "Obama AntiChrist?" What does Obama have to do with a gay preacher? Why do these people feel that just because they hate everything, that God hates everything along with them?
20090304085722AAoLyQ9	Politics & Government;Politics	How important was Michelle Obama's position at the UC Medical Center?	Some employees are simply irreplaceable. Take Michelle Obama, for example. The University of Chicago Medical Center hired her in 2002 to run “programs for community relations, neighborhood outreach, volunteer recruitment, staff diversity, and minority contracting.” In 2005 the hospital raised her salary from $120,000 to $317,000 — nearly twice what her husband made as a U.S. senator. Oh, did we mention that he had just become a U.S. senator? He sure had. Requested a $1 million earmark for the UC Medical Center, in fact. Way to network, Michelle! But now that Mrs. Obama has resigned, the hospital says her position will remain unfilled. How can that be, if the work she did was vital enough to be worth $317,000?

20090304083306AANJ0DO	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	I am getting harassed by ebay?  What should I do?	Uhhh. . . Since the idiots have a monopoly I am forced to use them. Well, ebay recently lowered my seller rating because they say I have 4.5 out of 5 stars in one of my categories and if you fall to 4 stars you can have your account suspended. This infuriates me, because when buyers rate a seller how many of them are actually going to think 4.5 stars is a bad rating. You'd think a lot of buyers would leave even a 4/5 thinking they had a pretty good transaction.       The other day I was also trying to list a couple items for $0.99 and ebay kept charging me $18 listing fees, but refuse to overturn the fees. I also paid and extra $20 to have feature listing and they double charged me, but never made the listings featured as promised. As if that was bad enough, I went to the discussions forum to ask other sellers if there is anything I can do and ebay permanently restricted me from the boards, because I "used hateful language." All I said is, "is there a safe alternative to ebay if I can't work this out?" This makes me more angry because no hateful language was used what so ever.       Next, I listed a huge lot of "like new" baby clothes and many of them still had the original tag, and ebay removed my listing because they say by putting "like new" it violates their policies. I just don't get it, they are like new! and many of them are new! I have 100% feedback and I have 5 stars in all categories except the shipping category, which is 4.5 out of 5 stars. Even more irritating is the more often than not I ship for free. What is going on? How do they allow sellers with fake gold, counterfeit handbags from china, and 90% feedback to sell, yet I'm being singled out and attacked out of nowhere?      My id is missarie253 if you even want to look me up and tell me to verify that I am a trusted ebayer. What the heck am I doing wrong for them to attack me like this?

Are we gonna be able to ask for supervised visits?  We have kept a detailed record of her actions and misdoings.  There will be four attorneys present one for me, one for my hubby, one for her, and then one for the state.  Also there will be a guardian ad litum speaking on behalf of the children.

Bush admin encouraged home ownership but followed directly opposite plan of  tax credits with business done with labour abroad. The result was slowly jobs vanished in USA. If the lowering of taxes done primarily with jobs in USA, I am sure the housing problem would not have cropped up. And we would not have heard of recession now. Unless GOP chanes this policy, any amount of tax cuts will not benefit common man in USA. Finally such a situation will raise civil disorders here.

20090227063604AApjPQn	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Iran/Muslims leading in medical research/stem cell research. Will supercede USA. T or F?	Iran investing in stem cells      Thirty years after the toppling of the Shah in Iran, the nation is undergoing another revolution of sorts. Iran is investing heavily in stem cell research, and despite researchers working with limited access to laboratory equipment and resources, the country may emerge as a scientific force to be reckoned with in the stem cell field.         Even with their limited infrastructure, Iranian scientists have managed to isolate six human and eight mouse embryonic stem cell (ESC) lines over the past decade, and then successfully turn these cells into functional pancreatic, heart, splenic, and liver cells. "It's remarkable that they were able to do what they've done," Konrad Hochedlinger of the Harvard Stem Cell Institute and Massachusetts General Hospital told The Scientist. "They are clearly catching up."      Unlike many western countries, where religious wranglings have hindered the progress of ESC research, in Iran and other Islamic countries research involving embryos is relatively uncontroversial. Islamic law states that full human life begins only after the "ensoulment" of the fetus, which is defined in the Quran as 120 days after conception. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's supreme leader, even publicly endorsed human embryo research in 2002.      -The Scientist Magazine

Driving down a main road I was suddenly shaken with what was an unexpected puddle in the street. A puddle the size of a lake that subsequently caused my car to die. I researched the puddle that caused this and it seems to have been the result of some recent construction being done. It appeared to me that the drainage from the site was leading entirely into the road and must have caused sewer blockage. I am very familiar with this road and until recently have never seen any major build up of water there before. I am quite upset over this and am simply interested in finding out what, if any, action there is that I can take in order to get compensation from the party responsible for causing the water buildup?

Strategy to overcome it: Following the outbreak, hold special events (such as the Rolling Stones concert) to show the world that the outbreak is over and canada is safe from disease.   Now here are are my five reasons that need strategies:   1.Lingering fears from 911   2.Conflict in Iraq   3.High Canadian dollar   4.Increased border security   5.High gas prices

I have an interesting situation and I am not sure if I have any legal rights and if so what are they?       I share my fence with the neighbor behind me. Starting in January, my neighbor’s dog has been burrowing into our yard, spends a little time and then burrows out, continuously! My yard is covered in large mounds of dog feces, there are large 2 ft holes, damage to my gate and all along the back fence. I realize that the back fence would be considered shared property, but enough is enough. I’ve sent the owner a formal letter in January and even spoken with them directly this past weekend. They acted as if I was wasting their time and pretty much told me that since they were never home, they just didn’t have the time or money to make the repairs.       We currently have our home on the market and are not living there and only make it out every couple of weeks. What can I do? I am so frustrated. Do I have an legal grounds that would warrant a call to the police to force them to correct the problem? I am trying to sell my home, but my backyard now looks awful and it is costing me dearly!

People are going to by weed regardless of wether or not it is illegal. This could save all kinds of money and lives. Less people will be in jail. Instead of having to buy your weed off of a drug dealer , you can buy it from a legitimate business. People get killed in drug transactions sometimes, and this would also be a big step in getting rid of the street thug dearlers. Now I have smoked weed before when I was younger, but I don't smoke anymore. I just see only good coming out of this proposition. Cali could use the money.

20090304100611AAWnkCp	Politics & Government;Other - Politics & Government	Do Republicans realize why Obama is spending so much?	Many Republicans try to make the case that Obama is spending so much just because he's a liberal. Really?!? Bush authorized TARP for $750 billion - remember? Our last Democratic president left us a budget surplus - remember?      Obama's hand has been forced - the only reason we're seeing such big numbers is because of the mess left behind by the Bush administration.      If Bush had left us a stable economy we would see stable spending levels. But he didn't.      Why do so many Republicans try to portray the stimulus bill as typical liberal spending when it obviously isn't?

20090304100926AA3wxmF	Politics & Government;Other - Politics & Government	So, is Barack still the greatest ever?  Even at lying?	Promise #5: Sunlight Before Signing      What he said:      “Too often bills are rushed through Congress and to the president before the public has the opportunity to review them. As president, Obama will not sign any non-emergency bill without giving the American public an opportunity to review and comment on the White House website for five days.” (BarackObama.com campaign Web site)      What he did:      Obama signed the Lily Ledbetter bill, the SCHIP/cigarette tax hike, and the stimulus bill all with far less than a five-day waiting period that he promised–and continues to promise–on his campaign Web site.      Promise #4: Lobbyist Revolving Door      What he said:      “No political appointees in an Obama-Biden administration will be permitted to work on regulations or contracts directly and substantially related to their prior employer for two years. And no political appointee will be able to lobby the executive branch after leaving government service during the remainder of the administration.” (BarackObama.com campaign Web site)      What he did:      Obama appointed Goldman Sachs lobbyists Mark Patterson chief of staff at the Treasury Department, where he directly oversees his former employer, a recipient of $10 billion of taxpayer funds from the TARP. Obama also appointed Raytheon lobbyist William Lynn to be an undersecretary of Defense.      Promise #3: No Tax Hikes on the Poor      What he said first:      “I can make a firm pledge. Under my plan, no family making less than $250,000 a year will see any form of tax increase. Not your income tax, not your payroll tax, not your capital gains taxes, not any of your taxes.” (September 12, 2008, Dover, N.H.)      What he did first:      By signing H.R. 2 into law, Obama happily signed onto the idea that smokers should pay for a $35 billion expansion of the State Children’s Health Insurance Plan (SCHIP). Cigarette taxes are going up 61 cents a pack starting April 1. Obama signed this bill knowing that the majority of smokers in the United States are working poor, and one in four lives below the federal poverty line.      What he said next:      “If your family earns less than $250,000 a year, you will not see your taxes increased a single dime. I repeat: not one single dime.” (February 24th, 2009, Address to a Joint Session of Congress)      What he did next:      Ignored the already-hiked cigarette tax at the time of the statement and then this restated promise was broken just two days later, when the Obama’s budget proposal was released. His new budget raises 45 percent of its revenue from energy taxes that will be paid by everyone who fills a gas tank, pays an electric bill, or buys anything that was grown, shipped, or manufactured.      Promise #2: Pork Barrel Earmark Reform      What he said:      “The system is broken. We can no longer accept a process that doles out earmarks based on a member of Congress’ seniority, rather than the merit of the project. We can no longer accept an earmarks process that has become so complicated to navigate that a municipality or non-profit group has to hire high-priced D.C. lobbyists to do it. And we can no longer accept an earmarks process in which many of the projects being funded fail to address the real needs of our country.”      (Statement on Earmarks, March 10, 2008)      What he is expected to do:      The White House has signaled that it intends to sign the $410 billion Omnibus Appropriations bill, which according to Taxpayers for Common Sense, contains 8,570 earmarks totaling $7.7 billion, including dozens of wasteful pork-barrel projects. These earmarks were awarded based on seniority, not on merit, and were mostly the result of high-priced lobbying, precisely the process that Obama promised to end. When the omnibus reaches his desk later this week or next week, we’ll find out if this is one more broken promise.      Promise #1: Big Government      OK, so this one is more of a statement than a promise, but it’s the biggest whopper of all.      What he said:      “Not because I believe in bigger government — I don’t.” (February 24, 2009, Joint Address to Congress)      What he did:      Obama proposed a budget that is breathtaking in scope, a blueprint for the biggest permanent expansion of government in history right on the heels of a sweeping trillion dollar stimulus plan. The budget lays the foundation for a government takeover of the health care and energy sectors and dramatically increasing spending across the board, other than defense weapons programs. Spending as a percentage of the economy under this budget will reach the historic level of 27.7 percent this year. The deficit as a percent of the economy, at 12.3 percent, is set to be the biggest in the entire history of the country outside of the four peak years of World War II. Anyone who offers such a budget can only fairly be described as a believer in bigger government.

20090304095230AADbFiP	Politics & Government;Politics	Is Obama destroying the retirements of most Americans with his Wall Street-demolishing agenda?	 http://www.usnews.com/usnews/politics/bu...       Critics Blame Obama For Stocks' Plunge      On its front page, the Washington Post also says that "more than any individual development, the continuing collapse in financial markets around the globe reflected an absence of faith that the trillions of dollars that governments have deployed to try to contain the damage will do the trick." Under the headline "The Obama Economy," the Wall Street Journal editorializes that "From punishing business to squandering scarce national public resources, Team Obama is creating more uncertainty and less confidence -- and thus a longer period of recession or subpar growth." Similarly, CNBC's Jim Cramer said last night, "Until the Obama administration starts listening, until they start paying attention to what you're watching, to the stock market, until they realize that their agenda is destroying the life savings of millions of Americans, then all I can give you is caution. ... I just want some sign that Obama realizes the market is totally falling apart. And that his agenda has a big hand in that happening."      ABC World News, in its lead story, reported that the Dow Jones Industrial Average "finished the day at levels not seen since 1997." The Wall Street Journal reports on its front page that "US investors joined a world-wide selloff that began in Asia and rippled through industries from financials to consumer durables to technology. The Dow dropped 4.2% to 6763.29, its lowest close since April 1997. It has lost almost one-quarter of its value this year and more than half since its high in October 2007." The Los Angeles Times notes "the broader Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 34.27 points, or 4.7%, to 700.82, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq shed 54.99 points, or 4%, to close at 1,322.85." On its front page, the Financial Times notes "stock markets around the world fell to their lowest levels of the economic crisis on Monday as a spate of dividend cuts and faltering financial companies shook investor confidence," and the Wall Street Journal says "Asian shares fell again Tuesday with worries about the continued bleeding at large financial companies around the globe sending bank shares lower."      On its front page, the New York Times says "hopes that the American economy, which led the world into recession, might lead it back out this year have been fading." The AP says that "with each new hard-times headline, most recently an alarming economic contraction of 6.2 percent in the fourth quarter, it seems more likely that the next depression is on its way." Another AP article reports that the Commerce Department "said consumer spending rose 0.6 percent in January, the first increase after a record six straight monthly declines." However, the Institute for Supply Management's "gauge of manufacturing activity showed contraction for a 13th straight month in February. And "construction spending plunged more than twice as much as expected in January."

20090304103336AAmQLKj	Politics & Government;Other - Politics & Government	Why didn't President Bush do much to stop the mess with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac?	It apparently started in 1977 with President Carter passing the Community Redevelopment Act. Then it continued in the 1990's under President Clinton.      According to the New York Times, in September 1999, "Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stockholders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits."       Bush tried to do something major in September 1993 to control the problems with Fannie and Freddie, but Republican Congress stopped it. Thereafter, during his administration, he did not do much after to get this mess under control.  He did not as a leader, "pull the bulls by the horns."  To add insult to injury, politicans like Barney Frank claimed there were no problems with Fannie and Freddie.      Shouldn't Bush played a bigger role to stop this mess?  What do you think? I am trying to better understand this problem.

President Barack Obama on Wednesday ordered an overhaul of the way the U.S. government awards contracts for private sector work, reversing a Bush administration policy that in some cases led to federal investigations of procurement practices and no-bid contracts.      Obama joined Republican Sen. John McCain, his presidential campaign rival, and other congressional figures to announce an executive memorandum that commits his administration to a new set of marching orders for awarding contracts. Obama said "the days of giving government contractors a blank check are over" and said changes could save up to $40 billion a year.

It is intended to deliberately influence public opinions or perceptions. This includes advertising.      I hate the way corporations mislead people about what a healthy diet is. For example "milk is good food" is believed by most people, but it is total hog wash. Research shows that milk is unnecessary and often harmful. We are dealing with human allergies and a product that contains cow protein, animal fats, genetically modified bovine growth hormones, antibiotics, and other contaminants. Too much milk drinking/cheese/dairy can leach calcium from bones rather than build strong bones. Milk is not a good source of calcium and it is not required for a healthy diet, contrary to the US Food pyramid recommendations (best government corporations can buy).

20090304104549AAnFiN4	Politics & Government;Elections	Where will taxes come from since the taxpayers are going "Galt" to rebel agt. paying for O's big government?	Barack Obama is pouring billions more down those sinkholes. It isn't just the camel's back that's broken. His neck and four legs have all snapped, too.       Enough. While they take to the streets politically, untold numbers of America's wealth producers are going on strike financially. Dr. Helen Smith, a Tennessee forensic psychologist and political blogger, dubbed the phenomenon "Going Galt" last fall. It's a reference to the famed Ayn Rand novel "Atlas Shrugged," in which protagonist John Galt leads the entrepreneurial class to cease productive activities in order to starve the government of revenue. (Not coincidentally, Rand's novel sales are up and John Galt references punctuated many of the Tea Party demonstrations.) Dr. Smith was inundated with stories like these:          "I have frozen hiring in my firm. ? No investments will be made in taxable accounts — only 401k/IRAs. I am buying silver and gold instead of CDs or stocks with non-qualified money and savings. I have stopped taking new clients, thus freezing my income. I barter more and more. Spend less. I stopped leveraging assets (don't borrow)."          "I have cut WAY back — I'm no longer buying retail, driving out of a 10-mile radius, spending money on eating out or putting my money in a savings account. I am using the money to pay off all of our debt. It has made our family closer, more appreciative."          Another blogger wrote: "Last year my family paid nearly $1,000 a month in federal taxes, and we are not by any stretch of the imagination rich. I'm going to make it my business to cut that amount in half, using every legal means possible and reducing my income so there is less to tax."          Enough. Those business owners are not alone. This week, ABC News spotlighted upper-income earners going Galt in response to Obama's proposed tax hikes on families with incomes of $250,000 or more. A Lafayette, La., attorney told the reporter she was cutting back on her business to avoid the tax threshold: "Why kill yourself working if you're going to give it all away to people who aren't working as hard?" Tax hikes have consequences. Incentives matter. Only self-deluded wealth redistributors living in la-la land believe otherwise.          Another business owner, Dr. Sharon Poczatek, explained: "The motivation for a lot of people like me — dentists, entrepreneurs, lawyers — is that the more you work the more money you make," said Poczatek. "But if I'm going to be working just to give it back to the government — it's de-motivating and demoralizing."          The perpetual Borrow-Spend-Panic-Repeat machine in Washington depends on the capitulation of the wealth producers. There's only one monkey wrench that can stop the redistributionist thieves' engine. It's engraved with the word: Enough.       M. Malkin
20090304101404AAmVxN3	Politics & Government;Elections	Agree? Obama Lied; The Economy Died.  Obama told a whopper when he claimed that he is not for bigger governmen?	As he said last week: "As soon as I took office, I asked this Congress to send me a recovery plan by Presidents Day that would put people back to work and put money in their pockets, not because I believe in bigger government — I don't."       But lamentably, a few days later, The Washington Post reported: "A senior administration official acknowledged yesterday that the budget does not contain $2 trillion in spending cuts over the next decade. Instead, the figure represents Obama's total efforts at deficit reduction, including tax hikes (of more than $1 trillion) on families making over $250,000 a year. It also includes hundreds of billions of dollars 'saved' by not continuing to spend $170 billion a year in Iraq."       Only a big-government man would think of calling a trillion-dollar tax increase a spending cut or "saving." Technically, of course, it is true. A trillion-dollar tax increase would reduce spending by $1 trillion for those private citizens who were taxed. And from the perspective of the federal government, a trillion dollars taxed is a trillion dollars saved from the greed of the taxpayers who produced the wealth and might well want to spend or invest it in nongovernmental activities.

20090304100706AADxdYE	Politics & Government;Elections	Why put a Saudis' man in the White House? O appoints as Chair of inner group that gives him intelligence?	estimates  as well as the overall intelligence community.   It's none other than Charles "Chas" Freeman, the former U.S, diplomat and pro-Arab lobbyist who is openly and loudly hostile to the Jewish state of Israel, is a defender of CHINESE oppression.       Freeman was U.S. Ambassador to the desert kingdom of Saudi Arabia during the first Gulf War. More to the point, since 1997 he has been president of the Middle East Policy Council, the Arab world lobbying group that used to be called the "American Arab Affairs Council". Not surprisingly, the MEPC owes it very healthy endowment to those internationally renowned lovers of peace, civil rights and democratic process, the Saudi Royal Family.          Freeman's lack of enthusiasm for democracy is not limited to the Middle East. Without a sign of shame, he has steadfastly defended China's brutality towards those brave enough to fight for Chinese freedom of political thought. Indeed, the only criticism Freeman had of the Chinese government for its bloody 1989 massacre at Tiananmen Square was the timing! In a 2006 posting on ChinaSec, a confidential internet discussion group of China specialists, recently reprinted in The Wall Street Journal, Freeman wrote: "The truly unforgivable mistake of the Chinese authorities was the failure to intervene on a timely basis to nip the demonstrations in the bud."          As Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic Monthly says it is obviously inappropriate to hire "a well known advocate for the interests of Middle Eastern autocracies to produce national intelligence assessments for the Obama administration."

An abortion clinic owner is accused of delivering a live baby during a botched procedure and then throwing the infant away.      Belkis Gonzalez, 42, was arrested Tuesday and charged with practicing medicine without a license and tampering with evidence, both felonies, said Ed Griffith, a spokesman for the Miami-Dade State Attorney's office. If found guilty, Gonzalez would face at least a year in prison and up to 15 years.      The teenage mother, Sycloria Williams, has filed a lawsuit alleging that Gonzalez knocked the infant off the chair where she had given birth, and then scooped the baby, placenta and afterbirth into a red plastic biohazard bag, and threw it out.      The clinic's doctor, Dr. Pierre Jean-Jacque Renelique, had been scheduled to perform the procedure, but Williams went into labor after being given drugs to dilate her cervix and waiting for hours for Renelique to arrive, the suit said.

20090304114511AA8KlWO	Politics & Government;Politics	Socialism based on wealth envy?	I've been reading in the news lately how many top earners (those making over $250,000 per year) have decided to cut back on the number of hours they work, etc. in order to protect themselves from tax increases imposed by the Obama administration.  Those interviewed said "why work so hard just to have it taken away by the government?"  In the case of small business owners, if they make less, they can't afford to hire more people (even laying some people off).  How can this be good for the economy?      What I want to know is, are those that support this kind of forced wealth redistribution resentful of the successful?  Do they feel that they can't achieve wealth of their own so they want to rob others of theirs?  What do you think are the reasons behind the socialist mindset?

I am just hoping the blood test is more accurate and shows that i really didn't have a lot of alcohol in my system. I did not fee intoxicated, and I am just waiting for to hear the results of the blood test which they said could take a couple weeks.

She has given her employee notice but because she hasn't been well some on the notice has been the day before. she got a letter this morning asking her to Attend a disciplinary hearing for tomorrow! They say on the letter that the reason for the hearing is because of attendance and notice given. They also say the matter is so serious it may lead to dismissal. they have asked her to Attend the hearing however tomorrow she has a funeral to go to so she cant Attend. she was going to leave the job anyway because she didn't like it there. they have said they hearing will proceed without her there. If she doesn't Attend the hearing and doesn't go to work on friday is there anything else they can do like take her to court or anything? or make her pay for anything? she hasn't got a contract with them or anything!

Although political leaders and all claiming know-it-all scientists don't engage in this subject it is the most important issue above all. Unless we start to organize international body( not UN - not efficient ). We will run into huge problem of global warming refuges in 30 years. OIl will be depleted by then, economy collapses everywhere. Oil dependent food tranfer system halted. Lands became useless mostly due to errosion. Just calculate what it takes to feed one person and the speed with which land is eroded now. Look like we have perfect disaster scenario for conflict, dear goverment members?

20090304111943AACra4y	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	I want to see if anyone knows if in IL there are laws that prevent a mother to take a child out of state?	Okay here goes. I have a 12 year old daughter. About a year ago we moved from IL to TX. Her father had not been in the picture till March of 07. He decided that he wanted a paternity test and we got one off the internet. We took it and it came back as he was the father. (thing that I have always known and told him) We talked and he paid child support only when he wanted and saw her every weekend or every other weekend and sometimes during the week. Since we moved here she went to see him for a month in the summer. I filed for child support here in TX because he has not paid anything since he found out we were moving here. I am having some issues since he has said that he can make me move back to IL. I have read that if there was no court order than he cannot but since I am taking him to court now does that matter? I have been hearing conflicting stuff so if there is anyone that has been through this or might have some information that might help I would appreciate any help. I just need to know if there is any chance that he can make my family move back to IL and what I can do about the whole situation.

20090304112400AADwYJB	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Ongoing trial, no money to pay lawyer, what to do?	The trial is in county supreme court with jury and everything. My father is suing someone for the money this guy owes (71k). My father already paid our lawyer 13k prior to trial. Trial opens this week, Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and concludes on Friday. Half way through the trial, on Tuesday, our lawyer pulled out a new bill of 14k want my father to pay up front. My father told him that he do not have the money now, but will pay him like next week. The lawyer said that he's taking too much risk with 14k and maybe another 10k attorney fee owing, so he's gonna pull the case if we dont pay him right away. They argued that day, and my father has not have contact with the lawyer since. Another trial is tomorrow (Thursday). It seems like no time to fire our lawyer. And I doubt the judge will let the lawyer pull the case too. What is going to happen? What should my father do? Please answer this emergency if you can ~~~

20090304114216AAIYDdZ	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Why is child support for the 2nd child lower than it is for the first?	I have a child and receive $60 a month in child support for him. My ex had a daughter before we had met. He pays $150 a week for her. So because of the first child taken all of his income, my child gets the shaft. I don't even receive enough to help with daycare, or diapers, or clothes! I thought child support was to "support" your child, not your ex wife so she doesn't have to work. while I'm working hard to keep me and my son afloat. Why can't the system treat his children as equals and give the same support to both?
