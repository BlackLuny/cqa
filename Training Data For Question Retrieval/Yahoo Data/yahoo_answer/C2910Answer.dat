KfCJDp0Laa	decadal variations in the surface temperature? i wonder what might be causing them.....  http://jisao.washington.edu/pdo/    nice link dana, thanks.|`|uFQFRdczaa	Maybe it's a resonance of the MIlankovich cycle?    If you look at the ice cores, the global temperature was subject to violent swings of sometimes 3-4 degrees C over a relatively short timescale (less than 50 years) up until this current interglaciation.  There are warm years, even warm decades, within the glacial periods.  There are decades that do not fit the trend.  This 10-year cooling may be just another part of temperatures variability.    To my mind the biggest anomaly in the ice cores is the last 6,000 years of relatively stable (all within just over 1 degree C of the norm) temperatures where, if the previous pattern had held, we would have gone back into a glaciation at 4,000 B.C..      Since then, we have the Medieval Warm Period of about a degree over, the Little Ice Age of about a degree below--and all the disaster those changes wrought, but that's nothing next to a decade that's 3C warmer followed by the next that's 2C cooler.  There were people around for that, hunter-gatherers and cave men.  Civilization could not, and did not emerge, until the temperature stabilized.    My biggest environmental concern is not warming per se, but that we'll reintroduce the kind of temperature instability that existed over the past 60 million years (with the exception of the last several thousand).  I can live with a few degrees warmer, I can just plant a garden based on two temp zones warmer.  It'll be harder to deal with dramatic variability.|`|RW0Ik6Oraa	Good point Dana! Unfortunately, the deniers are already rolling downhill and are unable to stop denying.|`|1fee420808aabf67636dc09772eb45cfaa	For a periodic cooling every decade to be true, there has to be both supporting data and an underlying cause, so there should be solid scientific evidence supporting the existence of any regular cooling.  Unfortunately NASA's data doesn't support your question's premise of cooling since 2002.    On the causal side, if we look at other temperatuer influences that might have played a role in the past, there are minor cycles to the sun's radiation that run about 11 years.  There are also cool years mainly in the Northern Hemisphere due to the La Nina cold phase of the El Nino Southern Oscillation ocean current cycle.  Other ocean oscullations such as the Arctic Oscillation (AO) and Pacific Decadal oscillation can have an influence.    "The Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) is a pattern of Pacific climate variability that shifts phases on at least inter-decadal time scale, usually about 20 to 30 years."  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_dec...    If these various influences a happen to occur at once they can periodically have a measurable cumulative effect, but it's only temporary.  No cooling has halted the gradual temperature rise over the past 100 years.  In fact, over the past 30 years  the warming rate has accelerated.      Scientists don't claim that global warming is the only climate influence operating on global temperatures, they simply observe, as noted in the excerpt below, that the other influences now happen in the broader context of overpowering global warming.     It's funny to see people grasp onto the illogic presented by the professional denial propaganda, arguing that climate change happened in the past, as if that proved that the earth's response to CO2 couldn't be anthropogenic now.  Unfotunately the past record supports greenhouse gas theory, and the evidence jsut keeps getting stronger.  That's why the American Geophysical Union has strengthened their warning about global climate change.    NASA Sees Arctic Ocean Circulation Do an About-Face  http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?re...  A team of NASA and university scientists has detected an ongoing reversal in Arctic Ocean circulation triggered by atmospheric circulation changes that vary on decade-long time scales. The results suggest not all the large changes seen in Arctic climate in recent years are a result of long-term trends associated with global warming.    The Arctic Oscillation was fairly stable until about 1970, but then varied on more or less decadal time scales, with signs of an underlying upward trend, until the late 1990s, when it again stabilized. During its strong counterclockwise phase in the 1990s, the Arctic environment changed markedly, with the upper Arctic Ocean undergoing major changes that persisted into this century. Many scientists viewed the changes as evidence of an ongoing climate shift, raising concerns about the effects of global warming on the Arctic.     Morison said data gathered by Grace and the bottom pressure gauges since publication of the paper earlier this year highlight how short-lived the ocean circulation changes can be. The newer data indicate the bottom pressure has increased back toward its 2002 level. "The winter of 2006-2007 was another high Arctic Oscillation year and summer sea ice extent reached a new minimum," he said. "It is too early to say, but it looks as though the Arctic Ocean is ready to start swinging back to the counterclockwise circulation pattern of the 1990s again."     Morison cautioned that while the recent decadal-scale changes in the circulation of the Arctic Ocean may not appear to be directly tied to global warming, most climate models predict the Arctic Oscillation will become even more strongly counterclockwise in the future. "The events of the 1990s may well be a preview of how the Arctic will respond over longer periods of time in a warming world," he said.|`|NqGkbDetaa	If the temperature data used as the basis for AGW was not corrupted to the point that artificial warming has been reported, the Earth could possibly REALLY be in a Cooling period.

In fact, 1934 is in the top 3 or 4 hottest years globally, but according to this blogger, it was relatively cold.

One can see that there is a similarity between the early century warming trend to the late century one.  Since the early century warming was due to natural causes, lets discount that.  Then you have mid century cooling, which on its own puts a doubt to the global warming hypothesis, since temperatures dropped over a period of thirty years just as greenhouse gases started to take off, so we will ignore that part as well.  (Unless you believe that we can have a similar cooling trend and not put a doubt to the hypothesis, but no serious scientist would say so.)    Then you left with the late century warming.  Yes that graph does show cooling trends, but that was only for a year or two.  Where does it show a seven year cooling trend?      What is even more damming is that this cooling trend started at a time when methane levels increased after being flat, and co2 rising faster than forecasted due to China.|`|pZi3HXdnaa	No it does not happen every decade, it is often said by certain people that the last thirty years of global warming are proof of AGW because it cannot be explained by other mechanism. Find 7  years of cooling  on the following graph that is not associated with volcanic SO2 emissions. Global cooling happens every 60 years, just like global warming happens every 60 years. And they don't cancel each other out as certain other one dimensional thinking people often say.    http://icecap.us/images/uploads/oftheMay...

boZVHPfgaa	First of all, I'm warning you that posting this kind of question in Yahoo Answers is going to attract a lot of attention from deniers. Seriously, don't pay any attention to them. They're in the overwhelming minority, but they flock to sites like this and YouTube to have a rant about how it's all a hoax or whatever. If you look at a few of their comments you'll see that they actually don't even agree with each other about why global warming isn't real. If you find yourself even half convinced by their rubbish then just send me a message and I'll be happy to explain further.    To answer your question, I guess it depends on how much you're planning to put into it. For a simple answer I'll say become a vegetarian. Meat takes a startling amount of feed and water to raise. The larger the animal, the worse the ratio looks. The only meat that's carbon neutral is locally hunted meat.    Now I'm going to tell you about a more comprehensive, and very exciting solution that's catching on extremely fast, and that you can be a part of:    Transition Towns is a movement that began in Totnes, England in late 2005, and since then has been spreading across Britain at a startling rate, and even to other countries including parts of the US. There are already 126 officially recognised Transition Towns, and a great many more which haven't yet gained official status! That's unbelievable for a movement less than 3 years old.    Me and some friends started the Cambridge (England) branch of the Transition movement less than a year ago, and already it has over 500 members, over 50 of whom are actively working on making our vision a reality. We won an award for environmental achievement and also the support of our local council.    We were inspired by other transition towns in England, and in turn we inspire more towns. The more the movement grows, the more it grows in publicity and respect. It has already spread to other countries including the US. The Scottish authorities have made 250,000 available in funding for transition towns in Scotland.    That's why I believe it's the answer, because it has the power to inspire more people to action than any other environmental initiative before it. A common approach is to scare people with horror stories about how terrible the future will look if we -don't- take drastic action to prevent global warming, prepare for peak oil etc, which causes a lot of people to despair, switch off or go into denial. What's special about the Transition Towns movement is that it motivates people to get involved by showing them how great the future can be if we -do- take action.    The solutions not only help us to reduce our impact on the planet, but also prepare us on a local level to be reliliant against the effects of climate change, peak oil (global oil supplies are officially predicted to plateu in 2020 and subsequently decline, see this video for details: http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2008/... ) and economic recession. They also bring communities together and are a lot of fun! In other words, people are also motivated by feeling that they have much to gain on a personal and community level, even if they doubt that the rest of the world can change. The solutions even make sense if you don't believe in climate change or peak oil.    A couple of examples are: community gardens/orchards to produce our own food so we needn't rely on imports, and community renewable energy projects.     Transition Towns is so easy to get involved in. People can contribute as much or as little as they feel ready to if there's a transition group in their area. If there isn't a transition group in your area, all it takes is a small group of committed people to start one. To do so, just visit http://www.transitiontowns.org for all the necessary info to get started, together with the contact details of people who can help you.    Together we can make this happen!|`|jNEI1Hfqaa	Stop farting and plug all the volcanoes.

Please do a little research on the history of this planet and all the ice ages and cyclical warming that has taken place over the eons.

And even if you believed people were so wise and powerful why would you want to? The Earth has been taking care of itself for a long time. It doesn't need a bunch of carbon credit taxes and slogans that the inspire man cows to follow each other in the direction of disaster.    You are going to read a lot of boilerplate talking points from the global warming zealots talking about how the scientists say so so it must be true. Scientists say stupid things that don't pan out every day and have done so since the inception of science. In fact, if you take every scientific statement ever made in the last 1000 years I'm betting the bulk of them were wrong. I only mention 1000 years because the latest news is that scientists have just told us that the effects of global warming won't go away for 1000 years. Imagine that, how smart they all are.

All that matters is the reality that global warming is a political movement that has very little validity.  They rely on computer models where they could tweak a few parameters and get cooling if that were called for.  The physics of infrared absorption of CO2 was understood 30 years when anyone who claimed that CO2 was going to prevent an ice age was ridiculed by mainstream science.  Any further warming is going to require a whole lot more CO2.  The problem with that is that the higher the concentration, the further the equilibrium shifts and the more the oceans absorb.  The oceans already hold more that 50 times as much as the air and could easily accommodate 5 times as much.    It isn't even remotely likely given the known deposits of fossil fuels to have a significant impact on that.  We might get a degree of warming above what it would have been which is unknowable.  It is hardly worth surrendering our prosperity to a bunch of socialists who might reduce the temperature a 1/10 of a degree if you call that improvement.  It is more likely to be beneficial in the first place so surrendering our money to them is a lose lose proposition.|`|84b16d97e7d42ff125bb26b44375be86aa	Why should we worry about what alarmists tell us.  <br>  <br>  We'd all be living in bunkers waiting for a hundred different doomsday scenarios if we did.|`|c8tyG5z3aa	I just want to reply to someone here and set the record straight... the end of the world is not in 1212.

ehgLIx2Raa	yea, i know what you mean. im 17 and america makes smoking out to be such a sin, when in fact most of the world smokes. my sister lives in spain, and EVERYONE smokes there, and people live longer there than americans, same with the french. idk, its a pretty expensive habit tho|`|ETHhnhLxaa	quite stupid|`|MGOFjVnVaa	teens and youngster always loved to provoke grown-ups by<br>  doing "forbidden things". i did that also, the more protest i<br>  would arouse, the better.<br>  nowadays the us-americans have created a new public enemy -<br>  the smoker. that was easy to do and divert attention from much<br>  more important and serious matters. apparently people need<br>  to hate someone - the smoker was served to them on a plate.<br>  we do so many things nowadays which are bad for us and other<br>  people, but nobody talks about that. inhaling all the exhaust<br>  from industry and traffic is a lot worse that inhaling the smoke<br>  of a cigarette smoked by your neighbour. but, of course,<br>  nobody touches cars - that would be unpopular, not to mention<br>  alcohol.|`|Uxe1GjP0aa	I think smoking doesn't make you a good or a bad person. It decides a lot of things for you but it doesn't make you any worse than anybody that doesn't smoke. Let's get that clear.<br>  <br>  I guess you are learning that the decisions you make now are going to follow you around for a long time, so no matter who smokes around you, you need to think for yourself and in your own best interest:<br>  1. Can you support your habit? Do you want to? Or are you happy bumming ciggies from others who can?<br>  2. Are you ready to face the consequences of taking up smoking? It is a full time addiction that will dictate when you take a break at work, for example.<br>  3. Don't you have other hobbies you can release your stress to without hurting yourself?<br>  4. Your friends and older brother are not the ones living your life.<br>  <br>  Number 4 is very important. Nobody will live for you and you seem to be realizing nobody will stop you if you make some unwise decisions where only you will lose.  It's your call.<br>  If you and your mother don't get along, avoid talking to her at all. It will save you being constantly irritated. Start setting some grown-up boundaries with the adults in your life and silence will do more to stop all the yelling than any cigarrete will help you cope with.<br>  Reacting should be put under control.<br>  Good luck.|`|ulYTAfXtaa	i always think "man they must have something not going right for them to wanna light up a smoke", and your little spill just supported my theory. hahaha<br>  but seriously though, every teen i know that smokes is stressed as heck. coincidence? not at all.|`|vgsK2fr5aa	k when ever i see people smoking i thinkewww they might look handsome/beautiful but then they pull a cig out and they just turn ugly to me<br>  their teeth go yellow and they smell like a smoker and it is really off putting|`|NiRFYhVDaa	its curiousity but if make it a habit thats a no no..|`|7U8nhijRaa	I think kids who snoke are a joke<br>  theyre just ruining there future|`|UaHZH9ifaa	I think they are weak people who easily fold to peer pressure....guess im right|`|N0EEYQUnaa	Your not the only one that gets stress at home. Others don't smoke. You must not be very good at handling stress if you cant help but smoke.<br>  My view being a teen myself. Its gross for girls to do it and guys that do it don't worry me at unless its near me then it pisses me off because i don't want that sh*t near me.|`|QXcbS8C1aa	try spaces like paragraphs, people will usually read it all if its spaced out so it doesn't look so big. anyways,<br>  i'm 15 i smoked since i was in like 7th grade? but looking back, then i smoked to be 'cool' but now, when i try and quit its just like, i get pissed off way easy and i just continue to do it.<br>  my ipression on seeing middle schoolers smoking- to be cool.<br>  highschoolers- to be cool or they got some deep **** going on and thats their  way of revealing it.|`|lb8FBhWnaa	Personally, i think its nasty, and my first impression is that they are irresponsible and don't take care of their body. I would not judge you in a mean way though, but i do not understand why people even START when they know its so bad for you and addicting, its like they are asking for an addiction problem. I am not trying to be mean, and you are probably a wonderful person, i just really hate cigarettes. My best friend who i love to death smokes, and it kills me to watch him hurt himself like that, because i know in the long run it can kill him. My aunt died at a young age from lung cancer from smoking. Lung cancer was terrible and she died a painful death, that could have easily been prevented. Please stop, if not for your health, but for the people around you who love you.|`|b56zHKF9aa	well, it is certainly not right to do so, but some do it cause of peer pressure, some just thought it was cool and wanted to try it out, some, well, just wanted to try things cool, maybe. My impression is that first, he is probably not very good at study, second, he is not good at sports. But that dosn't mean that he isn't smart, so just quit and you will start over.|`|QqoWRuLZaa	I'm 14. <br>  I smoked cigarettes when I was 13 and I quit smoking cigarettes after I started smoking weed a lot more. Cigarettes are a disgusting horrible habbit to get into. It makes your teeth yellow, gives you cancer, may relive stress, but for only what 10mins, and you smell like **** for 10hrs after. Its a hella ghetto *** thing to do. I smoke weed every other day still and that sh*ts fun. Thizz is pretty fun to maybe once or twice a month.|`|diLZQRUNaa	i've had a lot of **** in my life + all my family smoke. I'm not sure how I'm the only one out of my family that dorset smoke. I'm 18 now and theirs nothing really that can stop me from taking up a bad habit. But i guess i've found ways to distract myself from getting stuck. <br>  also remember there are always people out there you can talk to.|`|h2MkHC25aa	not to sure why you wrote your lifes story since it has practically nothing to do with your question, anyway im 15 and i think its disgusting that teenagers smoke . I would NEVER!! my mums smokes that wouldnt stop me, and the excuss that ur having a tough ime is **** people are much worst of then you. And is your life is **** why would u add to it with health issue all that will ever do is hurt eveyone who cares about you when the side effects of smoking kick in.|`|Rlm7VjeEaa	They're idiots. I yell at teens who smoke. This one girl I knew got pregnant and smoked during her pregnancy. I think her baby should have been taken from her. I got so mad.

wzM5WB8Xaa	Follow the 3 R's (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle), car pool, walk, or cycle instead of driving, conserve energy by turning down the heat when they aren't home and when they are sleeping, turn off appliances that have a standby mode, replace their lightbulbs with CFL's, and plant trees. Hope that helps!|`|5tpV7Jdcaa	We dont need to be eco friendly.  We need to be eco-forceful.  Cap CO2 immediately.  In 2012 the ice will melt and make oceans rise 10 feet killing millions and hurt polar bears and penguins.  The coral reefs will all be wiped out too!!!!!!!!!|`|aahbhllNaa	people can use potato starch and re-plant trees when they take them up and only drive if you have to and use the bus and walk and recycle. People shouldnt put polution in rivers or **** in the streets.|`|H66RHumIaa	Maybe stop making money... they use so many chemicals and trees to make money...|`|AA11722830	On a positive note, the Global recession will help reduce the world demand for - Oil and Gas for the next 2 years at least.    I believe most people will seriously take eco-friendly issues to heart, and be more careful and thoughtful of saving energy etc.
