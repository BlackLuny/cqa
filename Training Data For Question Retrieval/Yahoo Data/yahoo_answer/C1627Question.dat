20090304123822AANmDtf	Travel;United States;Orlando	Wil my 2001 Mazda Tribute blow up driving from PA to FL this summer?	I have a 2001 Mazda Tribute with about 66000 miles on it. It is in good shape is fully function. I do have a warranty on it until 2010.      I was planning a trip to florida with the 2 kids (12 and 14). There are a couple of places that I would like to stop like the Biltmore Estate in NC.      I am just a little nervous about driving an 8 year old car that far.      I could book a flight to FL for about $450 + FEES and then rent a car for another 300-400, but I like roadtrips.      It is about an 18 hour/ 1000 mile drive from where I am at (mostly on I-95).      I did drive it to Chicago (12.5 hour 750 mile) last year and back without problems.      It gets good gas mileage too at 27mpg (for an SUV).      I figure that once I factor in getting to the airport, waiting for take off, departing to the hotel, the 3 hour trip will be 5-6 anyways compared to just hopping in the car and going, but I won't have to worry about losing luggage.         I would start around 8pm on a Thursday night if that makes any difference heat wise

20090304130845AAUBcIC	Travel;Air Travel	Do you like Air Canada better, WestJet better, or both the same?	For me, I prefer WestJet because the crews are nice and friendly and they have in seat TVs plus they get the job done and have fun, also they have a good safety record for the period of time they have been around. But I like Air Canada too because they have nice cabins and they have TVs, the crews get the job done, and they have a good safety record for the time they have been around, plus they have more destinations. So it is a 50/50 thing there, but I usually choose the air line with the cheapest fares, I'm really cheap. Just Kidding! So what is your favourite? and why?

20090304151137AAqVR8O	Travel;Cruise Travel	Upcoming cruise - Santo Tomas De Castilla, Guatemala port?	I am going on a seven day cruise next month. One of the ports is Santo Tomas De Castilla, Guatemala. To be honest none of the planned excursions look that great to me. I'm considering the San Felipe Fortress. Has anyone been to this port, or even this particular excursion? Any recommendations of what to do, or better yet - what NOT to do? I certainly want to stay with a group, I'm too nervous to venture out on my own. Anywhere else, maybe - but not there. Too many reports of tourists being robbed.

I Came across this website a few days ago.  myairfaresecrets.com      I Did some searching to see if it's bogus, and can't find much that's current.        I noticed some typos in the site, and it says that the "special price" will expire soon, but it seems to have been at the special price since 2007.        The LARGE amount of information on the site seems like a bunch of hype.  The wild promises (free air travel/travel anywhere for $7) make me  think .... SCAM!       I'm wondering if anyone has actually bought and used this information to receive deep discounts or free air travel?      Is it just an elaborate scam to grab your $25 bucks?

20090304114310AA2UvIp	Travel;Europe (Continental);Other - Europe	Where do we go on holiday?	I am 17 years old, my friends and I are in our first year of sixth form college and have decided that instead of buying each other 18th birthday presents next year, we'll all save up and go on holiday with each other in June 2010! Only problem is, we don't know where to go!   There are 16 of us and this is obviously a large number of people to book in one go! We have criteria, but we don't know where the best place to go is that fits them all!      * Cheap. We have a budget of approx. ￡250-300 each   * Hot. We want somewhere that will have nice weather. No point paying for rain when we've got that here in England!   * Europe. We obviously can't afford longer flights with our budget.   * Beaches. We'll be 18 by then, and a beach is a neccesity for us!   * Sports. Even if it's just banana boats and stuff, we need something exciting!   * Food. We have one nut allergy, 4/5 veggies, one fish hater etc. we need somewhere with a fair bit of variety so we can all eat at the same place rather than everyone choosing different restaurants and eating on our todds.   * Accomodation. This can't be too expensive, we are on low budgets.   * Pool. Wherever it is the accomodation needs a swimming pool! A very important requirement!   * No camping, skiing, snowboarding.      I think thats everything! If you can help it would really be appreciated! We are totally and utterly stuck, none of us have ever organised a holiday before!

20090304113435AAzM74W	Travel;United States;Orlando	Orlando, FL. Honeymoon Location- HELP!?	My fiance' and I are getting married Jan 2010 and immediately going to Orlando, Florida for our honeymoon. We are debating on 2 places and cannot decide but the hotels need booked by this weekend!      The first place, Bonnet Creek, is a GORGEOUS resort near Disney. Most of the reviews recommend it for a honeymoon and/or young couples, which we are. There are pools and jacuzzis and just gorgeous. HOWEVER - there will be construction going on from here til june 2010 and we would have to rent a car because its not near downtown orlando.      The second place - Cypress Palms is in downtown orlando and is a gorgeous resort as well. It had several reviews saying it was a fun family resort. The resort is in walking distance of several restaurants, stores, and has shuttles that go to sea world and universal studios, so we may not have to rent a car. However - many of the reviews say they did not recommend it as a honeymoon spot.      HELP PLEASE!      and one more thing, Please dont provide me with other locations. I just need your advice on the 2 listed. Thanks

20090304132656AAuJ4Cx	Travel;United States;Houston	Anyone able to advise on direct flight from Dublin to Houston with Continental?	Posted this question under the "air travel" section but someone here may also be able to shed some light on this....      Would be interested in visiting Houston in September, especially as Continental Airlines offer direct flight CO23 daily from Dublin with an equipment change in Newark.      As this is a direct flight, can the Newark-Houston leg leave without the passengers from the Dublin-Newark leg if there are delays along the way or is there a dependancy on leg 1? Is there less of a chance of them losing your luggage than would be the case on a standard connecting flight?       Ireland is the only EU country that has US pre-customs clearance onsite in it's airports so should be fine in this respect but in any case would the checks only happen in Houston or would it be in Newark while you are waiting for the equipment change to complete?      Anyone who has experience of Continental's other direct flights to non-US cities who can advise would help greatly. Can you also confirm if all their Boeing 757's have personal AVOD on every seat?      Thanks!      Brian.

(He will meet me on a Thursday night around 6 or so and return to his car Sunday afternoon.)      He is driving up from Virginia, probably taking 95 to DC and then we're not too sure about his route to Philly from there. 95 to the 1 probably, but neither of us are familiar with Philadelphia.      Which route would you suggest?      Also, our biggest question: Which Septa station will be furthest out or easiest for him to get to (from which he'll be traveling to Camden to the Susquehanna Bank Center venue)? (And what station is closest to this venue?)      Is there overnight parking there? / If there isn't, which is the next easiest station to get to where there is overnight parking?      Also, will his car be safe there for 3 nights?      Thanks so much... I know that's a lot of questions...
