20090307170448AAYyie0	Consumer Electronics;Cell Phones & Plans	Selling a phone and don't want to get ripped off...?	Well, I'm a college students trying to making a few extra bucks. So, I'm selling some of the things I don't need. One of the things is a new Sidekick LX on Craigslist. When you sell something or try to sell something they say be careful of people that want to buy things from you that live far away.      So these two people have contacted me...one from I don't know where but wants to give her penpal a phone for her birthday that lives in South Africa. Sounds a bit fishy to me. Offering $110.00 more then I wanted and the other one lives in Canada. A little more believable.      The first one...I'm not so sure if I can trust and the second one sounds honest. What do you think?

Which of these phones should I get:      LG Dare   LG Voyager Titanium   Samsung Omnia   LG EnV2   Samsung Alias      I cannot decide between these phones.  If anyone can supply any information on which phone is best, it would be very helpful.  If anyone actually has any of these phones, please tell me why or why not I should get that phone.  I am going to be mostly texting more than talking.  And I also love a phone to have many features, so I can play with them when I'm bored.  Please supply as much information as possible. Thanks.

I have looked on cheat sheet web sites and have not found the answer to my question. Hoping someone here has the answer. My granddaughter is playing Lego Indiana Jones PS2 and when she gets down under the library she can only find four skeletons: 1 in a casket in first room, 1 in a pull out casket, 1 hanging from statue, and the last past the snake/bug trench on the right behind the wooden barrier. We have blown cob webs up, destroyed everything we can find but still can not find the fifth skeleton. Is it further in the maze? I really don't think it is. please help 10 points to first correct answer.
20090307221129AAGzjzg	Consumer Electronics;Cameras	I have a broken Sony super steady shot DSC-H2. Sony says they will repair it for $150. Is there another way?	Bascially what they call the shutter... Its actually the button you press to take a pic broke off when a spring came out. So now, I am missing the small spring and the actual shutter.      Are there other places that can fix this. I have found the camera is only worth about the price of what it would cost to get fixed. But, with today's economy we really want to get it fixed.      We called Wolf Camera today and they said they could fix it for $250. Any advice will be appreciated.!!!!      Charley

20090307223943AA0QwcI	Consumer Electronics;Cameras	Considering: which brand offers the cheapest lenses?	Canon-Nikon-Sony.      I'm aware, you see, that Sony has in built IS. So, that's good. It also uses Minolta lenses.      But currently, I don't have any lenses except an 18-250mm Tamron.      Is IS/VR offered on Macro lenses? Telephoto lenses? Wide Angle lenses?      I stick around the semi-pro stage, at most, and I doubt I'll go to full frame DSLRs, so I'm trying to decide which brand is best for investing in.       I'd probably only ever get a twin kit lens, a telephoto, macro and wide angle, maybe fish eye.      But I still would like to know if they are offered in IS/VR, and whether it is much more expensive than the Sony lenses.

I was recently on a plan with someone else but switched to my own plan. I just ended my first cycle on March 4 and I just go my bill for $165. I looked at almost everything and still can not figure out how this is possible and why it is so expensive. I have no data charges and I only used 119 minute out of the 900. There is tax of $13 but I expected that. I also get a 19% discount from where I work.       My boyfriend is having the same problem he has the 350 minute plan for 59.99 a month. His first bill was $135 and his 2nd was $169. He also has not gone over his minutes or used any data.       Why are our bills so expensive? What can we do?

20090307225319AAlwp1P	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;PlayStation	Questions About 80GB PS3?	Im thinking of getting one but i want to find some things out first.      1. What resolution are most PS3 games in? e.g. 720p/1080p      2. Does the standard 80GB PS3 come with an HDMI cable included? Or do i need to buy it separate—and if so can it be any HDMI cable or are they specifically/custom made for PS3?      3. Is it free to play online? e.g. with killzone 2, call of duty 5      4. What can you do with the online feature? e.g. can you browse the internet, stream videos, use msn? etc.      probably bout it for now. thanks!!

20090227122600AA1taHw	Consumer Electronics;TiVO & DVRs	Comcast Bill Question?	I got my Comcast bill and I see a $175 installation charge because they hooked up 2 HDTV's, 2 SDTV's and internet on one computer. The installation was terrible and their was cable everywhere. I had to call them the evening they installed to come out again because they did not install the television in our kitchen which was to be installed the first day.      Should I call Comcast and complain? Will they give me a credit back? Is it worth my time waiting on hold and then just being denied?      Thank you,

20070519073151AAXgwTx	Consumer Electronics;Cell Phones & Plans	How to Hard-format the 6670 ?	I tried to switch OFF and ON the phone, to remove several programs, to remove the memory card, to reconfigure connections, to "clean" memory, but nothing worked. Then I decided to format the 6670. I first performed a Soft-format by entering the code *#7370#. But it did not help. I then tried a Hard-format using the method reccomended for the 6600: With the 6670 OFF, I kept pressed the 3 buttons [CALL/ANSWER + * + 3] while switching it ON. All I had is that the 6670 was switched ON normally. No Hard-format.   Questions:   1. How to Hard-format the 6670?   2. Should I try some other solution instead?   3. What is the difference between a Soft and a Hard-format?   4. Shouls I keep the memory card in the phone during any of the formats? (it was removed for the Soft-format)   Any help will be very apreciated, believe me.

Since I'm a relatively new photography student (I'm still in high school) I'm still reliant on the light meter. The battery definitely works, because the light on the front lights up when I switch it to battery check.    Why doesn't the light meter work and how much is it to fix it?    Is it even fixable?    should I just get an external LM?       Any tips are greatly appreciated. Thanks.

(V3X IS NOT the magenta razr everyone knows) the pink choco has a bad reputation, and i am hesitant to buy it even though it is pretty. the maxx razr has a VERY good reputation, but i have heard bad reviews about motorola. the pink razr is pretty, but i am not sure about it, and don't know much about it, either. it is also motorola. please help me figure out which one i should get, or give me another option. i do not want anything too big, such as a blackberry or a sidekick. (i have no need for a PDA). i would like something with a camera on both sides. (like the pink razr and the maxx.) an MP3 would be nice but i already have an iPod so it doesn't really matter. it needs to be tmobile or have a GSM version. i want something with web-browsing.   please help, and thank you!!!
