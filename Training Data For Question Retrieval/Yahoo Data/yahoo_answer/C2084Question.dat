The old Yahoo browser had a little button at the top of the screen which allowed you to quickly switch between our whole family's email addresses.  The "new" version doesn't seem to let me.

I used to work for a tattoo studio, and another studio in the area has a public website, I don't know what hap pend or how it hap pend, but the guy from the other studio claims that I was emailing him all this nasty stuff, and he mentions my FULL name numerous times in his blog.  I have tried to reason with the guy but he just freaks out at me, and acts immature and says "I'm obviously under your skin".  I have since stopped working for my studio, and this other guy is STILL writing stuff about me that doesn't make any sense, and he says that he's going to take me to the police, for harassment, etc.  This man is crazy and I don't know what the hell he is talking about?!?!  Is there a way I can get my name removed from his website, I feel that it is defamation of character.  I haven't done anything wrong, and he doesn't have the right to put my name out in public like that.  The thing is im not happy with the studio I used to work with, and so why would I do them any favors?...this doesn't make sense, I will be working at another shop in June and I don't need  people seeing my name on some jerk's website claiming all these things.

I have a brand new very powerful Vista 64bit PC with plenty of RAM and plenty of storage.  For some reason whenever I open a new tab in explorer (7.0), the browser software freezes up.  While its' frozen I can use other apps and go to the desktop but the explorer software is completely unresponsive.  After a about 15 seconds it clears up but it is terribly annoying.        I am certain it’s mot my hardware since, when I use Firefox, I can open 10-20 tabs with no problem and no freezing but I prefer to use explorer.       Can anyone help?      Also, assume that I am pretty computer savvy i.e. please don’t tell me to run CCleaner or clear my cache, since I have already tried most of the basic remedies including reinstalling the software.      Thanks!

20090223082056AAcaES6	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Answers	Just a random question...?	how can you tell if its real love or not?   i mean with the guy.. how can you tell he says what he means.      ive been in a lot of relationships where the guys have said i love you, and BAM a month or two after, theyre history.       the guy im with now, i can tell its real love no doubt about it. i thought i was in love before, once. turns out, a few months after we broke up, i was like, whatever. if it was real love, the grieving and upset over the loss woulda lasted longer, i think.       he says he loves me sooo much, and im pretty confident he means it. but one of my friends said to me a while back, if he hasnt been in a serious relationship before (and he hasnt... only tons of not so serious gfs that dumped him...) then you cant really know whether its love or not.      he said to me last night that if we ever broke up, it wouldnt be on bad terms. wed either stay good friends for life, or hed be my lover (exact words). he said he would be even happier to be my lover for the rest of my life.      thoughts...?

Hi,       I have only recently signed up to Yahoo answers,      I thought it was a knowledge exchange thing rather than a social site, but having read some recent questions, and answers, I have even found some well established members giving 'silly' or unhelpful answers.      Please dont get me wrong, I think the site is great, and the format works really well. but it seems that if you ask a question and it has some potentially funny responses all you get are jokes. It's only very thecnical or boring questions which get sensible answers.      What is your opinion on - How seriously should the Yahoo Answers site be taken?      Thanks in advance for any serious answers/opinions, and of course any less than serious answers ! :-)
